cº Cº. our walnuts and sipping our claret,” as the present Leader of HER MAJESTY's Opposition is said to
have begun the first leading article in the first number of the “Representative ’’ newspaper (only for “cracking”
and “walnuts,” read “smashing” and “strawberries”), We, PUNCH the First and Last, were pondering over our own
virtues, and many other less palpable things, when ToBY, frightened for the only time in his life, dashed frantically into
the presence-chamber, and got under a chair. -
“Why this excitement, dog of our soul?” demanded MR.PUNCH.
Toby signified in canine Latin, a trifle purer than that which it is thought certain hierarchs of the SHAFTESBURY
creation would indite, if hurried, that a dreadful Deputation was coming up.
“Quid immerentes hospites veras, canis f" said his master. “Thou hast seen Deputations before—wild Sab-
batarians, loud Irishry, maddened Spanish bond-holders, frantic Bank-victims, rabid Chartists—what is this strange Terror
that has come upon thee? Speak, dog!”
“Gorillus, gorilla, gorillum,” stammered Toby, in the excess of his fright.
And truly, as the animal spoke, the door opened widely, and a group of Gorillas entered. Entered noisily, and
with some of the effrontery which belongs to the simious race both in Europe and Africa, . But not more speedily was the
clownish CYMoN awed, first, into reverence, and, next, into qualifying i. for Competitive Examination, by the sight of
the young beauty of IPHIGENIA, than were these African travellers astounded, and educated into the proprieties, by The
Presence. Foremost came their chief—
“The Fool of Nature stood with stupid eyes,
And gaping mouth that testified surprise,
Long mute he stood, then, turning to his staff,
His wonder witnessed with an idiot laugh.
Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering sense
First found his want of words, and feared offence.”
The Great Teacher permitted the lesson to saturate the whole being of his guests, and gazed benignly while they toned
themselves down to a becoming modesty and stillness. Then, taking pity on their dumb, inarticulate helplessness, and
remembering that, like the wise QUEEN ELIZABETH, he knew the i; of every Ambassador that approached the
throne, he said, affably,–
“Bob choddery hairyopagus snick bungjungle hippocampo mi chowder gum benjamin 2"
Tears came into the eyes of the poor Gorillas as they heard their native tongue, spoken with sweetness and purity.
“Slabbito gastly nebuchadnezzar”—began the spokesman, but his feelings overpowered him, and he broke down
under the weight of emotion.
“Take your time,” said MR. PUNCH, still speaking in the Gorilla tongue. He, however, translates the rest of the
dialogue, for all his readers are not Gorillas.
“O, MR. PUNCH,” said the Gorilla Ambassador, “I come from Africa.”

iv PREFACE. [JUNE 29, 1861.
“I have heard of that place,” said the Great Geographer, proudly. “It is one of the five quarters of the world.”
“Your information is unexceptionable, Sir,” replied the Gorilla, rapidly civilising into polysyllables. “May I
venture to hope that one who has bestowed so much study upon our poor country, will deign to add to our weight of
gratitude, and grant the boon which I am come to implore?”
“Name it; and in the meantime don't scratch the carpet,” replied the Lord of a Million Monkeys.
“Sir,” said the Gorilla, and a unanimous and confirmatory howl (echoed by a protestant growl from under the
throne) proceeded from his suite, “we are a great nation, we Gorillas, and we are not understood by travellers.”
“I have heard that self-assertion from one or two other nationalities,” said M.R. Punch, smiling.
“It is true, Sir, nevertheless. We are misrepresented.”
“Ah! and we, too, have a House of Commons,” sighed MR. PUNCH.
“Travellers, Sir, do not stay long enough with us to comprehend us.”
“You are said to detain them with some little impetuosity,” replied MR. PUNCH.
“O, Sir, such may be the practice among our canaille. }. not judge us by our inferior orders. Would you desire
that England should be judged by the persons who pay ten shillings to see BLoNDIN, or threepence to see a dog-fight?
No traveller or missionary has yet been admitted to good Gorilla society.”
“Is it so very good?” demanded MR. Punch.
“Sir, I may say with pride that it is. We are very desirous to imitate our non-hirsute fellow-creatures. We have
instituted exclusive castes, and no blue-tailed Gorilla grins to a low-born monkey with a brown tail. No lady Gorilla ever
nurses her young monkeys. A Gorilla who has lost his store of cocoa-nuts is at once bitten to death. We have
certain trees which are considered fashionable, and any Gorilla who does not live in them is regarded as a snob-monkey.
The larger the hoard of nuts which a Gorilla can steal, the more he is honoured; but we have also much respect for the
monkey who has torn many other monkeys to pieces in fighting; and a Gorilla of either class may take as mate the
prettiest young lady monkey he can find. When two of us quarrel they are set to fight, and the backers share with the
umpire the nuts of the combatants. We never trouble ourselves about the low-class monkeys, unless they grow too
troublesome, and then we strangle them, to encourage the others. You see, Sir, that we are trying to do our best for
ourselves, and that we are not what has been supposed.”
“I am sorry to hear it,” said MR. PUNch, sternly. “I had thought better of you, from the statements of my
friend PAUL du CHAILLu. What do you want from me?”
“We wish to be Recognised, Sir, at your Court. We wish you to send an Ambassador to us—if I dared to
designate the honourable Toby x -
But a storm of growls from under the chair indicated the unwillingness of the proposed representative to accept office.
“And we desire to place a Gorilla in London, as our Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary. He will be solitary,
but—”
“Not so solitary as you imagine,” replied MR. PUNCH. “Listen to me, ambitious but imperfect gentlemen. Can
you read P’’
“Certainly, Sir,” exclaimed all the Gorillas.
“Then take this Book. Go home to your forests, read, study, learn its lessons. It is the physic which I administer
to the British variety of Gorilla, and it may be equally beneficial to you. Come back six months hence, and let me see how
the medicine has worked. Begone, but take with you my
frid; tılm.

THIs planet was not visited by man until
º: 1882, when Mn. Asºka Amar, son
of venerable Professor, succeeded in
reaching it by being shot thither in a
wadded shell from an Arm-
strong gun fitted into Lond Rossk's icle-
scope. It was expected that Mercury would
be exceedingly hot from its proximity to
the sun, but MR. Army found that the rays
of that luminary pass over it, and the
planet is a lump of green ice, intersected
with rivers of quicksilver. The only inha-
bitants are owls, who are very civil to
visitors, and who speak a language resem-
bling Welsh. º expressed a great de-
sire to have a bishop sent to them, and
also some fat mice, and professed readiness
to pay allegiance to the Star of Brunswick.
The owls seemed very happy, and had
never heard of MR. Turpkk.

The planet Venus is composed of ivory
of the finest quality. It was first visited by
Sin BUFFAlo Humpk, the celebrated astro-
nomer, in 1900, when he succeeded in |
landing his aerial ship on Cape Cupid, the
southernmost point. It is inhabited by a
race of Lilliputians, who worship a great
blue monkey, and never speak at all. The
climate is delightful, and amethysts, -
nets, and rubies grow out of the soil in
the shape of flowers. The people have no
literature, but are very fond of oysters, and
once a-year they stand on their heads for
forty-eight hours together in honour of
Quadratic Equations. They take no notice
of strangers, unless when trodden upon by
the latter, when they emit squeals of a ||
dissonant character, and scratch, but are
very forgiving. They dip their babies, at ||
two years old, into bees-wax to give them
an ear for music.

Less was known of this planet than of
any other until it was examined by the
hilosopher DARwin, a few years ago.
He reports that the inhabitants are nothing
at all, and never were anything, and will
be the same for about two billions of years,
when they will all turn into ducks with
long green tails, having eyes at the end
thereof...They will then commence a strug-
gle for life, in the course of which their
tails will come off, and they will have two
wooden legs between three of them, and
all will talk oolitic sessile pachydermatous
Semitic. He do s not speak with perfect
certainty as to the next change, but believes
that they will probably become lobsters,
unless łº electricity be too great, in
which case the planet will be inhabited b

bursts.

“BRICKS AND BEANS.”
These terms are very respectable slang.
They are of masonic origin. Both “Brick”
and “Bean” signify a good fellow. A Brick
is the individual constituent of a Lodge,
which consists of Bricks cemented together
by the mortar of good fellowship. PyTHA-
goras, the Royal Arch Mason, forbade his
followers to eat Beans.
This prohibition
meant that masons were not, by usury
and extortion, to devour one another.

but do not eat him—not, at least, that we
know ; for some of us sometimes dine at an

no objection to a saddle of mutton, but as
to horse, extreme hunger alone would induce
an Englishman to touch the least bit.
GHOSTS WE NEWER WISH TO SEE.

And still less, should we like to see
every day of our lives, the Ghost of a leg

MARs was first reached by the
EARL of MARch and his stellar
explorative expedition in 1916, and
a very noble colony was added to
the British Monarchical Republic.
The planet is inhabited by a fine
race of Anthropophagi, most of
them eleven feet high, and ex-
tremely affable. The Earl, on
landing, presented them with a few
Irish, which he had taken for the
purpose, and which were at once
eaten, and the Marsites fired off
sixteen hundred wind-bags, which
they use as bells, in honour of their
visitors. The planet is at first
awkward for strangers, owing to
the ground being composed of red-
hot iron, but with acclimatisation
and clogs this is got over, and the
boiling springs furnish an agree-
able drink. The people have no
particular religion, except that on
the First of March they beat their
wives severely, and their industry
is limited to snoring and scratching
their heads. They have no govern-
ment, and get on very well with-
out one,
Homoeopathy.—Like cures like.
One irritation relieves another.
That is the reason why, from a
natural curative instinct, people
scratch themselves when they itch.

shine of a smiling face will gild

Toss the baby to Pantaloon, crying “Catchee, catchee!”
Snatch it away from him and hit him with it over the shins,
knocking him down. Squat upon the ground with the baby
in your lap, and begin feeding it out of a large pan with a
great dripping-ladle. Ram the ladle into the mouth of the

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1861.
ASTRONOMICAL INFORMATION.
From Punck's Almanack for 1963.
3upiter.
THE highest expectations were formed of this planet, and
when it was announced by the Milky Way Brpress, in August,
1914, that it had been reachcd by SIR, AustEN LAYARD, excite-
ment knew no bounds, and a Jupiter Land Coupany was
instantly got up. Unfortunately all these hopes were bughted.
The planet turns out to be a white pulpy mass, tasting like
blancmange. The first man who jumped ashore plunged head
over ears into the opaque matter, and went through, as it is
conjectured, into infinite space, as he has never since been
heard of. Various efforts were made to find a footing, but in
vain, and after several ships had been swallowed up, Parlia-
ment interfered, ADMIRAL BRooks was ordered to blow out the
four moons, which he did in the most gallant manner, and
notice was given that J º was to be ignored for the future.
A ſº." º crystallising the planet by galvanism has lately been
ta of.
NEGATIVE ADVICE.
NEven “for form's sake” write your name across a bill
unless you are prepared to meet the certain consequences.
Never expect to touch a street musician by your story of
there being sickness in your house, except you emphasise it
pointedly with a hearty kick.
Never flirt with a young widow who º: by your
Christian name the second time you meet her, unless you have
quite made your mind up to the worst.

THE INCONVENIENCES OF A HANSOM.
1. In getting in, you knock your hat in.
2. In getting out, you knock your hat off.
3. In getting in or out, the rubs are about 100 to 1 in avour
of your coat-tail taking a proof impression of the wheel.
4. If two of you get in, the vehicle is so small that you have
to sit almost in each other's lap.
5. That if you wish to speak to the driver, you have to throw
your head back, and nearly dislocate your neck, before you can
communicate with him through that miserable little trap-door
in the roof.
6. That if you direct the cabman to lower the glass-blind, it
is advisable to hold yourself far back, for fear the descending
should fall on the bridge of your nose and do it
serious damage.
7. That it is also expedient to take the same precaution
when the blind is being pulled up, or else you will infallibly
receive such a slap in the face, as no vindictive woman, in her
angriest mood, could possibly inflict.
8. That when the window is down, though it may be some
slight protection against rain, it is none whatever against suf-
focation. -
9. Should the Hansom be spinning along at anything like
its ordinary speed, you are seized with a panic at the sight of
every old woman or child who is crossing the road, that you
are inevitably going to run over them.
10. That if you pay your right fare, the Hansom-driver
looks upon himself as personally insulted because you have not
paid him half as much again—it being a standing rule with
these upper Ten Thousand of the cabstand, that if anyone is
on the Derby.
allowed to get into a Hansom cab, he should look upon it, not
as a right, but rather as a favour.
There are various other inconveniences to be found inside a

This locality is hardly entitled
to the dignity of a planet, since the
Lunar Caustic Railway was laid to
it from Hanwell, and the Moon
was laid out as an Evening Park
for the People under the Act 1 Edw.
VII., 1899. The discovery that our
forefathers were right in supposing
the Moon to be made of green
cheese has been a severe shock to
the Sciolists, and vast quantities of
that article are now imported from
the Moon to London. Some interest
was excited when the railway was
made, by the claim of the aged
ALDEaxian Moon to be the sove-
reign of Lunaria; but his ridi-
culous pretensions were finally
quashed by the appearance of the
rightful Man in the Moon, who
was dug out of a hole by the nav-
vies, instructed by Bishop SPUR-
grox, and appointed curator of
the district. The established reli-

Wray little is known of this

age like this. Bishop Livingston E

Women who infest the coast carried
off all the sailors and missionaries
into the interior, married them,
and kept them in nests on the tops

Science has no heart, and says,
“Shoot these preposterous birds; ”
but they are so beautiful, that no-
body but a blind man would take
aim at them, and he would not
hit. It has been sought to stupify
the creatures with opiates, but they
laugh at the trick, and knock over
the glasses with their wings. Un-
til they can be propitiated there is
no chance of exploring the planet;
but we think that Parliament ought
to take the matter up.

ALTHough Way's Light has long
since rendered this luminary obso-
lete, it is entitled to rank in an
Astronomical Catalogue, as there
can be no doubt that it was useful
in its day, and from the ardent
terms in which it is spoken of b
the poets, it must have been muc
admired when science was in her
infancy. The Sun is a phosphoric
body, upon which sheets of oil are
constantly pouring from the so-
called Milky Way (the Via Oleagina
of astronomers) and the “spots,”
as they were .."; called, were
the drains down which the sur-
plus oil falls into the sea, and
makes whales. It is inhabited by
salamanders, who have six legs
and profess themselves Sweden-
| borgians. Like the extinct Niagara
of credulous historians, the sun
will repay one visit, and the oil,
which is extremely valuable as a
depilatory, is imported now that
science has taught us the ab-
surdity of wearing any kind of
hair on our frames.

AT a Spiritualist Soirée which was held in town last summer
as many as six professed teetotallers averred that they felt
under the influence of spirits.
Of twelve hundred young gentlemen who last year travelled
on the Continent, no fewer than a dozen did not seize the
opportunity to try and get up a moustache.
One hundred and eleven members of the Peace Society have
since last April discontinued dealing with their pastry.cook, on
the ground that they believed he dealt in warlike stores, be-
cause of the inscription in his window, “Balls Supplied.”
Proofs are extant, in the shape of linendraper's bills, that
since Michaelmas ten thousand so-thought strong-minded
women have been weak enough to purchase things they had
no use for, simply because that they were ticketed “Great
Bargains.”
Of a hundred single men who last season received cards
for what the genteel call “At homos,” and the vulgar “tea-

THIs planet is a remarkable one.
It is simply a lake of water, of the
most crystalline character, and any
attempt to sound it is futile, as the
lead drops right through and falls
into the Zodiac. The lake is in-
habited by mermaids of a very
fascinating kind, but there has
been no successful attempt made
to capture them, though the hand-
somest officers have in the hand-
somest manner been plac, d, as
bait, at the command of exploring
expeditions. Music has been tried
with no better effect, the creatures
stopping their ears, and striking
up tunes of their own in the rudest
manner. This is all that is known
of Neptune, except that the water
mixes exceedingly well with any
spirituous fluid, and one touch of
toddy makes the whole world kin.

Well, you
just tell him you are a Friend of MINE.”
WHY I LOVE THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
I Loyº, I love the Isle of Wight, ... .
But 'tis not because its skies are bright,
Nor yet for its Undercliff so fair,
Nor the pretty girls who in crowds repair
To its sheltered strand and its balmy air,
Though in height of the fashion º trip about,
And under each piquant jº. hat,
The bright eyes glance, and the red lips pout,
And the netted tresses the breezes flout,
And pretty Balmorals, shapely though stout,
From blazing linsey-woolseys peep out—
Oh, no, it isn’t for that.
'Tis not for its fowl, and ’tis not for its fish,
For by trial I’ve learnt that to get a dish
Of whitings or flounders, of turbot or sole,
In Freshwater, Ventnor, Cowes, or Ryde
Is a harder and costlier thing on the whole—
Though you’re planted close by the blue sea's side,-
Than in any inland town I e'er tried.
'Tis not for its inns—though the Bonchurch Hotel,
And eke the Royal at Ventnor as well
Have good plain cooks and capital cellars,
And though from their windows the sea you may smell,
And command the Undercliff, dingle and dell,
And the landlords of both are capital fellars,
Their bills not too heavy, their ale not too flat,
But yet it isn't for that.
Nor isºt for the beauty the isle that crowns—
Its smiling fields and its snug little towns,
Its white chalk cliffs and its swelling downs:
Nor its Undercliff, that picturesquest of jumbles,
Where cottage ornée, rock and creeper and tree,
Each over the other deliciously tumbles,
In a way that gladdens the eye to see—
Nor its Chines, be their banks all golden and green,
With a dancing streamlet at play between,
Or as bare as my hand and as black as my hat-–
Oh, no, it isn't for that.
‘It is, because the Isle of Wight,

It still presents to my wondering gaze,

Yes—the real, original, Four-horse Coach—
To which what carriage could ever approach
With its perch in front, where you jam your knees,"
Audits perch behind, whereon four must squeeze,
In a space where two can scarce sit at ease;
And its inside, licensed to carry four,
Where you crush your hat, as you enter the door,
And where the sole way to dispose of your legs,
Is to sandwich your opposite neighbour's pegs:
And where if your next fellow-passenger’s pretty,
It’s all very nice—but if not, more’s the pity;
For, do what you will, you’re obliged to squeeze her,
And 'tis vain to call out either “Stopher!” or “Ease her!”
Who does not remember that Four-horse Coach,
With its driver sans peur if not sans reproche :
Who was great in mirth, and still greater in wrath,
And swore down all that crossed his path,
Who, let who would go astray, ne'er was knowd,

Who cut round corners, and tore down hill,

'Twas inconvenient, to tell the truth.
'Twas costly and crazy, and snailishly slow,
Now railways have taught us the pace to go;
'Twas cold outside, and cramping within,
And the driver was apt to be giv'n to gin;
A curser, a cringer, extortionate too,
One who measured respect by your purse, not you;
But spite of all this and more beside,
'Tis a pleasure of mem'ry again to ride
In that ven’rable vehicle—out- or inside;
And therefore I love the Isle of Wight,
For that it i. me this delight,
And sets old recollections abroach,

SELF-MOWING FURNITURE.
We really cannot understand how it is that when so many folks
have turned their minds to table-turning, they have none of them
attempted to turn out something useful by it. We do not speak so
much now of the regular séance-holding professors of the art, who make
money by their tricks just the same as other conjurors, and gull people
who go to them at so much charge per head. These persons doubtless
think it best to let well alone, and to go on pouching quietly the pro-
ceeds of their exhibitions, without running any risk by endeavouring
to introduce the element of usefulness. Enough for them to do their
tricks and do their patrons; to dupe the weak and foolish who out-
number the wise; to trade on the most sacred feelings of our nature,
by imposing their vile shams upon bereaved and grieving parents; to
pretend to have the power of summoning the spirits of the loved and
lost, and thus, ghoule-like, get a living by bringing up the dead.
But besides these shameless humbugs, whom we count with the
sham prophets and sham doctors of our time, there are amateur
professors of the spiritualist faith, who ought certainly to º to de-
velope its resources, and if possible, conduct it to some really useful
end. If there be an unknown power which can move our chairs and
tables, make our ottomans dance hornpipes and our wardrobes evince
signs of the liveliest emotion when approached, after, an absence, b
the mistress of the house, surely this mysterious influence is worth
turning to account, and the more we truly know of it the better. We
cannot see why we should go on paying men to move our furniture,
when for aught we know, our furniture is gifted with the capability to
move itself. Who can tell but that a latent power exists in chairs and
tables, in bedsteads and in book-cases, carefully to move themselves
from house to house at our mere bidding; to take themselves to pieces,
if need be, at their exit, and to put themselves again together on their
entrance? Certainly when next we have occasion to change house
§. but for the requirements of our dear (i.e. costly) wife and
amily, we should assuredly not do within the present century,) we

shall be tempted to go through a scientific course of table-moving, with
the view of seeing how far it night help us in our work. Before we
honour our upholsterer with instructions for the purpose, we shall
adopt a most exhaustive system of experiments, and do our best to
ascertain if furniture is capable of flitting automatically from Brompton
(say) to Bayswater, and arranging itself nicely in the rooms that are
prepared for it. just conceive what a saving of trouble, time and
temper, not to make allusion to money, there would be, if instead of
having to order vans and light spring carts, and, for fear of fire or
lunder, to take command in person of a whole army of workmen, who
in the usual course of things expect such liberal “allowance” as will
allow them to get tipsy not less than twice per diem,--if instead of all
the jobbery and robbery, and bobbery which invariably attends the
task of entering a new residence, one need only tell one’s loo-table,
“Come, there you be off, and mind your claws don't come so!” or
address one's º four-poster, “Now then, sharp's the word: unscrew
yourself directly, and move to Spirit Terrace, and take care not to chip
yourself in going up the staircase!”
Were some such really useful end as this arrived at, we should be
among the last to sneer at spirit-moving, and perhaps among the very
first to take advantage of it. But while the sole result obtained is
needlessly to move about our sofas, chairs, and tables, and to rap out
of the latter a lot of stupid, senseless, lying, useless and not seldom
blasphemous replies to what are at the best entirely needless inter-
rogatories, we must beg to be excused from giving our adhesion to
the spiritualist faith. If table-movers be not capable of doing some-
thing really useful by their art, the sooner they desist from their ab-
surdities the better. There is no earthly good as yet in anything they
do, and things which have not good in them have usually evil.
SERVANTGALISM VERSUS SCHOOLING.
Y no one shall we be ac-
cused of any wish to take
our reader's breath away
by advancing an extrava-
gant and startling suppo-
sition, if we venture to
assume that there are some
of them who are not quite
contented with their house-
maids, and are sometimes
to be heard even complain-
ing of their cooks. ith-
out going so far as to as-
sert that servants are “the
greatest plagues in life"
(which in the presence of
street-organists and Income-
Tax collectors it would
scarcely be compatible with
- -** honest truth to do), we
, is - &\s may yet presume to state
º: sº y that many a young house-
keeper has found they are
“great worries,” and many
an old one would declare
if she might speak her mind
about them, that the minxes
would exhaust the pocket of a Choesus and the patience of a JoB.
Smashed crockery, chipped ſurniture, spoilt cookery, and cheap finery,
are enough to sour the feelings of the sweetest-tempered “Missus,”
and when to these failings is added a weakness for life-guardsmen
and for reading penny novels, and a demand to be allowed to practise
the piano, and to be excused from doing any needlework but crochet,
we cannot wonder that complaints should now and then be heard that
servants nowadays know neither their station nor their work.
With an ear to these complaints, and an eye to the instruction of
º
Zºº
girls in humble life, not merely in the knowledge of how to read and
write but in the useful arts of sewing, cookery, and house-keeping,
which are no more learnt by instinct than anatomy or algebra, geo-
graphy or Greek, a lady four years since established a training-school
at Norwich, where the object was, she tells us—
“To give the opportunity for gaining a good education, with the addition of plain
sewing, mending, and cutting out; and also (what every mother was to understand
on putting her girl to school) such practical acquaintance with cookery and house-
work, under my excellent housekeeper, that every girl might know how a house
should be kept, and should acquire habits which would hereafter make all the
difference between a tidy and happy home or the reverse.”
Surely children, one would think, would like a school like this,
where as a relief from their arithmetic and spelling, some mornings in, of “wandering from the record.”
|
their daughters grow up handy, useful, clever girls, who would make
good servants and good housekeepers when wives. But no, poverty
and pride go often hand-in-hand, until they drag each other down into
the dirt. After a trial of four years, the lady is compelled to own her
scheme a failure, solely because she found the girls too proud to do
the housework, and the parents so absurd as to encourage their refusal.
In a letter to the Norwich Mercury she says:–
“I was not prepared to find the class of parents I had to do with would appa-
rently accept the education, but make every excuse to evade the industrial work, or
keep their daughters away when it was to be done, and threaten to remove them if
the household duties were required of them. In corroboration of this latter fact, I
may observe that twenty-three girls have been taken away from the school expressly
because they would not do the housework. Whether in the present-day girls are
allowed to determine for themselves what they shall or shall not do, or whether the
parents are too proud to recognise such industrial work as a duty belonging to their
children, it is not for meto decide. I can only act on the result, and close my school.
1 repeat, I should willingly have continued the plan, had I not met with discou-
ragement and opposition from the parents.”
Proper deference to parents is not the chiefest virtue of the rising
generation, but that this, perhaps, is more the fault of parents than
of children, the case which we have cited seems abundantly to prove.
How far it may be true that poor people spoil their children because
richer people do so, we think that it may possibly he worthwhile to
inquire. It is fashionable nowadays to let one's children, as a rule, do
exactly as they please, for mothers ºften are too lazy to pay much heed
to their family, and so long as toys or lollipops will keep things quiet
in the nursery, all attempts at propertraining are parentally postponed.
What wonder, then, that children are so, often now such self-willed,
pert, and stuck-up little creatures; and who can doubt that the
example is, to some extent at any rate, followed by the poor? What
great folks do, the less will prattle of and imitate; and while young
ladies are allowed to think it ungenteel to make a shirt or mend a
stocking, and to consider they lose easte by even entering the kitchen
we may depend that their inferiors will give themselves like airs, an
prefer to starve as sempstresses than to grow fat in service. -
Commenting upon the letter we have quoted, which should find its
way to every cottage in the kingdom, a writer in the 4thenæum.
sensibly observes:-
“Is there not something out of joint in a society in which competent cooks,
dairymaids, and laundrymaids are hardly to be got, while incompetent governesses
and female artists are a drug? Is there not something alarming in a society where
the superticial and false refinement of the girls of the lower classes unfits them for
domestic life, and gives them tastes habits, wants, which a large proportion of them
can never satisfy in the safe but humble regions of virtuous labour? While this
fatal misdirection is given to their training, we may confidently predict that the
recruits to the ranks of vice will far more than fill the places made vacant by the
efforts of reformers.”
Out of joints, as well as out of joint, will be society, if cooks, as we
seem threatened, are no longer to be got. “Every lady her own ser-
vant,” will become the general motto, and the sooner we prepare
ourselves for this new state of things the better. If girls in humble
life refuse to learn to cook and to keep house, schools for cookery and
housekeeping must be opened for young ladies, and parents of the
highest rank will have to send their daughters to them. Instead of
bringing home rewards for drawing or deportment, our girls will charm
our eyes by showing us their prizes for plumpuddings. ANGELINA
will be “honourably º for her pancakes, and AGNEs be
“commended” for the genius she displayed in boiling a potato. If
this plan be carried out, and “Servants' Schools for Ladies” be gene-
rally established, we think, in order to ensure a home being made
happy, every bride should be obliged, on the morning of her marriage,
to produce before the clergyman her first-class cook's certificate
without which document, the ceremony should not be performed, an
the engagement of the bridegroom should be legally annulled.
Affection in Man and Woman.
Women are said to have stronger attachments than men. It is not so.
Strength of attachment is evinced in little things. A man is often
attached to an old hat; but did you ever know of a woman having an
attachment for an old bonnet?
A Cheer for Elgin.
He has done his work featly, adroitly, completely,
So saith Mr. Punch, unaccustomed to flatter;
And except that the welkin don’t rhyme to Lond ELGIN,
The former should ring with the praise of the latter.

“My tooth-brush has for a long time been frozen night and day,

my shaving-brush, and my bodily ablution or scrubbing-brush are in
the same state. Not only is the water in my bed-room jug con-
gealed; but the jug itself is frozen into my washing-basin, by means
of water which the domestics spill over its mouth. My breath
freezes, on the inside of my bed-room window in beautiful crys-

the frosted panes, but anxiety to get up as fast as possible debars me
from that amusement.
“Everybody’s *::::::: are all frozen, of course; and I observe
that the plumbers are all in high spirits, evincing a degree of exhila-

“Not only are the ornamental lakes in the Parks frozen over, which
is all very well, but so likewise is the slush about on the pavements
whereupon the street-boys, in defiance, or with the connivance, of the

PUNCH'S ENGLISH EXERCISES.
A NEw idea in education has been suggested to us by the late pasto-
rals of CARDINAL Wiseman, Dr. Culles, and other Popish prelates;
indeed also by the allocutions, excommunications, and epistles of the
Pope himself. Boys used to be taught orthography by being set to
rectify some pages of bad spelling. . In like manner, youth might have
placed before them the verbiage of the Pope, the Cardinal, and the
illicit ARCHBishop of DUBLIN, being charged with the task of turning
it into English. It would be interesting to see how much shorter
these pompous addresses would be, if they were weeded of their rank
luxuriance of needless adjectives. There would be no fear that the
youthful mind would be perverted by the study of writings proposed
as examples to be carefully avoided; but no doubt their authors would
hope that they would have the effect of imbuing lads with popery, and
therefore would be quite willing to have them used as models of redun-
dance, turgidity, affectation, and every peculiarity of style that ought
to be shunned.
Together with the compositions of his Eminence, his Holiness, and
the archiepiscopal Irish firebrand, quack advertisements, such as are
not noisome, and the circulars of puffing tradesmen, might be advan-
tageously combined for the use of schools. The intellect would be
equally well exercised in reducing either a pastoral or a puff to its
lowest denomination. It is ... how like the language of in-
fallible-specific-mongers is to that of the preachers of papal infallibility.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMPACT LETTER-WRITER.
FINE letter-writing could not survive the establishment of the penny
post, but if elegant periods and a neat form of arriving at a conclusion
could have endured into the days when we have ten deliveries between
breakfast and dinner, the coup de grace would now have been given.
The Government offices, beginning with the Horse Guards, announce
that in future “the purport of every letter sent to them is to be
briefly explained on the top left-hand corner.” How much more of
the letters will be read? -
Letters are confessedly among the great nuisances of the day, except
to people in love and other fools. Everybody in his senses would
rather not have a letter than have one, unless it contains a cheque.
But as people will scribble, Mr. Punch earnestly recommends, that the
rule of the Government be adopted in private life. It will save so
much time and the expenditure of so much bad temper. For instance,
at Christmas time, when impositions are tolerated, Mother-in-law sends
a rigmarole of eight pages, with every other word underlined, and a
whole cataract of expressions of affection. About two-thirds through
the bottle of hay is the needle, which is an appeal to tolerably
prosperous son-in-law to lend idle brother-in-law twenty pounds. Now,
the old lady adds insult to injury by the torrent of words which
involve her petition. Does she know how tolerably prosperºus son-in-
law (who puts away and keeps letters, in order, tº meet the certain
accusation, one of these days, of not, doing much for his family), en-
dorses such an epistle. Mr. Punch will tell her:-
“Old girl, humbugging for £20
for that ass Tom ; sent it, like
another ass as I am.”
How much more decorous it will be, when tolerably prosperous son-
in-law has been taken to Norwood, and his papers are overhauled, to
find, instead of such a mote as the above, a few meat words at the upper
left-hand corner:-
Mamma petitions dearest Charles
for a little loan to kind, good, but
rather improvident Tommy.
Sent £20,
C. SOFT.
An author, too, Mr. Punch has heard, has occasionally written to
an editor, requesting the latter to give a favourable review of the
former's book. The way, Mr. Punch has heard, is to say something
to the effect that, though author is the last man to think much of
his own literary efforts, or to desire any notoriety, yet there have
been so many admirable articles in editor's widely-circulated and
influential journal, bearing upon the very subject on which author has
been writing, that perhaps, in the interest of the public and of the
good cause which both of them have at heart, a notice of author’s work
might be opportune and acceptable. This is all very nice; but the
*: in the upper left-hand corner, and the endorsement, should run
thus:–

Managers are much beset for Boxes at Christmas-time, especially by
rich people, who very properly say, that new pieces should be seen
while the dresses and decorations are fresh, and also while the children
(bless 'em) are home for the holidays, and therefore they beg the
Manager to give them the places that he can, just now, sell to great
advantage. Generally, the coolness of the note in which the demand
is made by a Clapham or Bayswater demi-millionaire is suited to the
coolness of the request; or if the lady of the house writes, it is evi-
dently with the idea that she is doing the Manager a favour in bringing
her children to see a gratis sight. #. sometimes she condescends to
be civil, and writes thus:–
“DEAR MR. SPANGLETON,
- “I see by the papers, and I am delighted for your sake to see
it, that your new piece, the Mountebank of Madagascar, has been so
splendidly got up that it is sure to bring you crowded audiences for
many a night. You will, I am sure, remember me from having sat next
to me at our good friend, MR. BADPort's, when you were so very kind
as to say that I º to come and see your theatre. I will now take
advantage of your kind offer, and as all my dear children are at home
for the holidays, I should like to give them the treat of coming to your
theatre on Saturday night, if you will be good enough to give me a
ox. As we are a good many, and some young friends are staying
with us, I should like a double box, and please let it be near the centre
of the house, because I do get so nervous about the little ones leaning

Mr. Punch, highly commending the compact corner-note, hereby

A SPECIAL WERDICT.
THE admiration of mankind is challenged for the subjoined verdict
of a British jury:—
“We find for the plaintiff, but with this remark, that DR. CLARRE acted perfectly
bond ſide; and that upon the result of the evidence there was sufficient to justify
the course he pursued. Therefore we lay the damages at £10.”
This wonderful decision, if that is the correct word to apply to such
a finding as the above, raises (instead of settling) a legal question, of
which one view was naturally expressed by the defendant's counseſ:—
“MR. AsPLAND.. I submit that is a verdict for the defendant.”
whilst another was logically delivered from a higher authority:-
“The LoRD CHIEF JUSTIce. I am of a contrary opinion.”
This case was an action for assault and false imprisonment, brought
by a woman who had been the defendant’s cook-maid, against her
former master, because he, a physician at Staines, had caused her to
be sent to the union workhouse, and confined there three weeks as a
lunatic. It was tried in the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster,
before LoRD CHIEF-Justice ERLE and a Special Jury. The speciality
of a special jury is supposed to consist in a degree of rationality and
intelligence superior to that with which common juries are endowed,
and likewise in a peculiar freedom from vulgar partiality and prejudice.
Here we have a special jury, finding, in the first place, that a physician
acted with good faith and sufficient justification, in giving his servant
into custody as a madwoman, and next that, in so doing, he had in-
curred £10 damages. . If this is the verdict of a special jury in a case
wherein a gentleman is sued by a social inferior, what is to be expected
by anybody in the higher or middle orders, who may be so unfortunate
as to get involved in a lawsuit with another person in the lower Of
course that the case will be decided against him—the jury adding the
expression of their opinion, that the better educated and richer party was
in the right so far as law and evidence were concerned, but that they,
as sympathising with the masses, felt bound to give their verdict in
favour of the poorer and more ignorant. Common juries must not only
return verdicts at variance with reason and justice, but they must also
assign their motive for so doing, if they are to exhibit, in the discharge
of their duties, any intellectual as well as moral inferiority to special
juries, such as special juries may be judged to be if the ..".
verdict above quoted is to be taken as an example of their wisdom an
righteousness.
A Likely Reform in the Law.
AMoNG the contemplated Law Reforms of 1861, is an Act enabling
persons to establish their own sanity during their lifetime, in order
that, after death, they may not have their wills disputed on the ground
that when they made them they were out of their minds.

Where she should sky a copper, flies a kite.
CHRISTMAS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
WE were told the other day of a Frenchman who had brought his
wife and family to England that they might spend their Christmas at
the Crystal Palace. The notion at first struck us as being rather curious,
but on afterthought we deemed it a most sensible idea. We doubt if
France, with all her forests, could show a Christmas-tree full sixty feet
in height; and we feel quite sure that France, with all its skill in
cookery, could not boast of such roast beef and mince-pies and plum-
puddings as it is the privilege of England to produce. %. remember
to have heard of an unlucky fellow-countrymen who, being doomed to
pass a Christmas-day in Paris, devoted all his emergies to make sure of
a plum-pudding; and who, having himself purchased all the requisite
ingredients, felt tolerably easy in his mind for the result. Well, Christmas
Day arrived, and after a first course of cow beef cut in strips, up came
the plum-pudding, served in a tureen; for the cook, not being told to
boil it in a cloth, had omitted so to do, and thereby turned it into
Soup.
We can fancy then, the French have but a vague idea of Christmas,
and we ought clearly not to laugh at them for coming over here to
et a proper knowledge of it. Nor is the Crystal Palace a bad place
or the purpose; supposing that the foreigner have no fireside to go to
where he can learn the meaning of the words “an English home.” To
see the troops of happy children who annually flock there, is not the
least of all the visual attractions of the place. And besides the mile
and a half of toys which are displayed upon the counters (children
now-a-days are much more blest in º: respect than they were when
we were young and GeoRGE THE THIRD was º and besides the
comic singers, and the conjurors, and Punch-and-Judys, who alternately
present themselves to please the infant mind, there is, actually, this
year a veritable pantomime, which thoroughly perfects the Christmas
aspect of the Palace, and renders the enjoyment of the juveniles
complete.
Remembering the pleasant words of SYDNEY SMITH, we may quote
them as an extra stimulus, if any such be needed, to induce Pater-
familias to take his children to the Christmas Fete:–
“Mankind are always happier for having been happy; so that if you make them
happy now, you make them happy twenty years hence by the memory of it.”
With this ringing in his ears, what father could refuse to let JIMMY
and JEMIMA, CAROLINE and CHARLEY, enjoy a Christmas hour or two
at the Crystal Palace? Summoned by the wand of the fairy-like
Bowley, toys and playthings of all sorts, and suited to all ages, crowd
the Nave as thickly as the jewel-fruit which dazzled Aladdin in the
garden where he went in search of the wonderful lamp. For visitors
who have cut and not yet lost all their sweet teeth, mines of lollipops
and rock are freshly excavated daily; while, as a meet contrast to the
Shadow Pantomime, there is no lack of more substantial Christmas
cheer for all who seek it.
POISONED TOYS.
Of all people the doctors must the most delight in Christmas. At
no season in the year is there so much good iº and as children, as
a rule, will over-eat themselves whenever they have the chance, pills
follow plum-puddings in the natural course of things, and the doctor
reaps a harvest from the seed sown by the cook.
But it is not only the surfeiting and stuffing that makes Christmas a
professionally profitable season. At no time in the year are there
more new toys distributed, and how provocative of sickness may these
#. be in our nurseries is shown by a late writer in the Chemical News.
His suspicions being excited by the brightness of the green with which
some playthings in a shop that he was passing had [. painted, he
analysed the colour, and found it was composed of arsenite of copper,
a F. not less deadly than arsenic itself. Now playthings, we
all know, are not meant to eat, but children, as a rule, are very apt at
times to put them in their mouths, and the brighter the colour the
more likely is the child to wish to find out how it tastes. . Unless a
father, therefore have a mind to be a thorough Borgia to his babies, we
should advise him when green toys are sent as birthday presents, to
put them in the fire as quickly as may be, or the chances are that he
will have to pay a doctor's bill much longer than the mince-pies and
plum-puddings would have caused, however great had been the juvenile
indulgence in them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SLANG OF THE STAGE.
E think for curiosities of ad-
vertising literature, next to
the second column in the first
page of the Times, the best
column is the last in the first
page of the Era. To readers
who are not versed in the
slang of the Green-room the
following may appear a curi-
ous requirement:-
NEW THEATRE ROYAL, CORN
EXCEIANGE, SHORTHORN-
FORD.
ANTED, immediately, a
Good WALKING GENTLE-
MAN, and a Walking Lady (one
who can sing preferred); also, a
Steady Property man and Bill
Deliverer. Other Theatres.-ad-
dress the Manager.
From the wording of this
notice, the ignorant might
fancy that pedestrianism be-
longed to the theatrical pro-
fession, and that theatres
were sometimes the scene of
walking feats. But we fear
- that were the ignorant to
inquire of any “call boy” if such really were the case, an answer more or less impertinent
(and rather more than less) would be immediately returned, the reply perhaps consisting of
the mere word “Walker!” It will be noticed that the male walker is wanted to be “good,”
whereas this quality is not thought an essential for the female. But without dwelling on
this, we pass on to another puzzle in the same day's sheet:-
FOOLWICH.--THEATRE ROYAL.
W ANTED, a good Juvenile Lady; also, Juvenile Gent, Heavy Man, and one or two
good Utility People. A fair salary given for talent. Apply.
Here we find the lady is required to be “good” and likewise to be “juvenile;” to which
latter qualification every lady under sixty would of course consider herself entitled to lay
claim. How far the coming census will be allowed to throw the light of truth on ladies’
ages, it is not our pleasure just now to inquire. But we think that to apply for a “ |.
lady,” is almost as superfluous as to require a “female woman; ” and just as needless was
! it to ask during the Cattle Show for a “heavy man,” seeing there were none else to be seen
then in the streets. - -
The next announcement introduces to our notice a Stage personage whom we have no
desire to know in real life:—
THEATRE LOYAL, SCREAMINGTON.
WAN TED, a first class S IN G IN G CHAMBER MAID.
Waits are bad enough, and so are cats and sweeps. But of all the most unmusical, most
melancholy nuisances where with the ears of sleepy sufferer could be nocturnally afflicted,
commend us—or, no, don't commend us—to a “Singing Chambermaid.” We can conceive no
greater torment that to hear the “Power of Love” squalled nightly on the staircase as we
turned into bed, while “Sally Come Up /* squealed through the keyhole would wake us out
of our first sleep. Banjoed, bonesed, and barrel-organed as we are throughout the day, we
should go stark staring mad–fanatico per la musica in pitiable truth—if when we retired at
night we were conducted to our room by a Singing Chambermaid, whose lullaby would
most effectually prevent our going to rest. As it is, we often spend a night at an hotel (say
the Star and Garter, Richmond, or the Bedford by the Sea) merely for the purpose of
escaping the sleep-murderers, who with trombones in their hands infest the London streets.
But we could no more hope to take our ease at our inn, if the dramatic “Singing Chamber-
maid” had a place in real life.
All these specimens of Stage slang wetake from the same sheet, and we copy them verbatim
merely altering the names, as we have not been paid to print them in our paper. With one
more startling sample we must conclude our list –
HALL OF HARMONY, BAWLBOROUGH.
WANTEP, to open on Monday, Dec. the 24th, Two good NIGGERS that can dance well,
a Lady Character Singer, and a Lady Sentimental; also, a Pianist that can read well.—Address.
To inquire in this way for a Pianist “who can read well” seems like asking for a gardener
who is a dab at painting, or begging for a butcher who can play the flute. If reading be the
thing required, why not seek an elocutionist? But this is not half so strange a request as
the preceding one; that for the good niggers and the brace of ladies who are “wanted to
open” on the day which is there mentioned. Wanted to open!. In the name of LINDLEY
URRAY, wanted to open what? Is it oysters, or box-doors, or “Wonderful Cabinets,” that
these fair ladies and dark gentlemen are “wanted to open?” ...Is it—stay—a horrid thought
*:: in our frightened brain. “To open” is a neuter verb as well as active. Can it be
that these four persons are wanted to be passive actors in the opening, and that for the
sake of producing a sensation, some tragedy is going to be played “with real stabs . . .”
There is no saying what dodge next will be tried to fill our theatres, and for aught we
know, there may be a good opening for persons who would every other might, say, undergo
that operation; the salary of course varying according as the opening were made with a
bare bodkin or with a Shylock's knife.
ITALY'S CHRISTMAS WAITS.
YES!-Christmas comes but once a year—
The happier for their fates,
Who dread the ills of Christmas bills,
And don't approve of “Waits.” "
There’s frost upon the window-panes,
There’s snow-storm in the sky,
While underneath the blankets
In vain to sleep I try.
For worse than saws a-setting,
Ordogs that bay the moon,
Those horrid Waits with wheezy flute,
Crack'd cornet and basoon!
Butlet me hug this comfort still,
There are worse fates than mine:
'Tis but 'gainst single household's peace,
Our Christmas Waits combine !
But there are Waits across the sea,
That work more wide annoy,
Whole nations keep on the qui vice,
And kingdoms’ peace destroy.
There’s Bombalino—while her flag
Dark France to shield him throws—
A Christmas Wait at Gaëta,
Breaks Italy’s repose.
His drum ecclesiastical
The Pope, that holy man,
A Christmas Wait, keeps beating
From out the Watican.
While ANTONELLI fills with breath
His brazen serpents’ round,
And rattles loud the begging-box
Where Peter's Pence resound.
Poor Italy may toss and turn,
And bid these Waits begone;
But still they breed their discord loud,
And won't move off or on.
And, last, as if such Waits as these,
Weren't of themselves enough
To break the rest of Italy
With rude alarms and rough—
Comes he, who darkling discord still
Can find the means to make,
Who keeps not only Italy,
But Europe wide awake.
No Christmas Wait like him who plants
At Rome his red-legged band,
Whose tricolor at Gaëta
Helps Bombalino's stand.
COMPARATIVE PHYSIOGNOMY.
SUBJoINED is part of an announcement copied
from a newspaper:—
"MADAME TUSSAUD's Exhibition.—New addition.-A
full-length PontRAIT MoDEL of the murderer WILLIAM
GoDFREY YoUNGMAN is now added to the chamber of com-
parative physiognomy.”
The Chamber of Comparative Physiognomy
was formerly the Chamber of Horrors. The
alteration is an improvement. People have
supped full of horrors, and, it may be hoped,
have got sick of them. Comparative Anatomy is
the anatomy of brutes in relation to that of man.
Comparative Physiognomy is the physiognomy
of such brutes as the murderer YoUNGMAN in
contrast with our noble selves. It is a pleasing
study at least to those whose physiognomy
derer YouNGMAN. To profit fully by the oppor-
tunities of study afforded by the Chamber of
Comparative Physiognomy, visitors should take
pocket looking-glasses to that exhibition, and,
instead of comparing each other with MessRs.
Rush, MANNING & Co., attentively study, their
own features in order to compare them with the
lineaments of those celebrities.

PAUPER HUNTING.
DURING hard frost and deep snow, there is nothing to be done in
the way of field-sports except ſº. which is a puerile amuse-
ment, and practicable only where the tops of the greens peep through
the snow, there being elsewhere no larks. Wild ducks may be shot;
but wild duck-shooting is rather an aquatic and marine amusement
than a field sport in this weather, all very well for those who, like it,
but rather too cold work for most people. , The only sports that can
well be enjoyed at present, are of a social character, such as hunt-the-
slipper; but there is a species of hunting better than that, and capable
of affording capital pastime. It is the game of Hunt the Pauper.
Your best § is to take a clergyman out with you as the keeper of
the parish which you propose to beat for paupers. His Reverence
will also do the work of pointer and setter. Two or three stout
fellows can follow you with loads of ammunition in the shape of cold
meat, bread and cheese, and other comestibles, and you may also have
a vehicle at i. heels conveying blankets and warm apparel. Pro.
vided with these essential requisites, you go and beat the Paupers up
in their covers, if they have any, for some of them will be found lying
about in the streets. Whenever the parson makes a point, you walk
up, and as soon as the Paupers get up, pitch in the grub, and wrap
them over with the flannel. In special cases, under the keeper's
advice, let fly some of the shot in your locker, making sure of your
object. You may as well carry a pocket-pistol loaded with the regular
Anti-Forbes-Mackenzie charge, to administer to Paupers on the ground
knocked up with the cold.
After a good long day's Pauper Hunting you will eat your dinner
with a zest which could not be imparted by the King of Oude's Sauce,
and you will sleep beneath your own warm blankets as sound as a top,
and better than if you had taken opium enough to narcotise a Chinaman.
There is very good Pauper Hunting to be had in town as well as in
the country. ...Out about Shoreditch, and all that way, there are lots of
Paupers in the slums, besides the preserves called Workhouses, in
which a little poaching on the sly may be practised with great
propriety.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TESTAToRs ALL ALIVE ol
HE amiable and decorous
habit in which certain jour-
mals indulge, of sending a
penny-a-liner to rummage
out the Wills of persons
recently deceased, in order
to the publication of the
contents of such documents,
is now gaining ground so
fast, that Mr. Punch, ever
anxious to be a-head of his
age, has made his own ar-
rangements for adding a
new feature to journalism.
He proposes to leave it to
his inferiors to visit Doc-
tors' Commons, and to take,
furtively, forbidden notes
when the jealous clerks
are not looking, nor has he
any idea of making surrep-
titious arrangements with
needy officials to sell information which they have no right to part
with. e, according to his custom, takes a bolder course. He
intends to furnish to an eager public particulars concerning Wills
while the Testators are still alive. For this purpose he has organised
a staff of reporters, whom he means to call the Paul Pry Brigade, and he
flatters himself that their researches into private papers will, enable
him to gratify the world, in the same way as, but in a much more
exciting degree than his Will-publishing, contemporaries do. He
submits a few specimens of what the Paul Pry Brigade has already
accomplished. it be objected that this is an unwarrantable imperti.
nence, and a vulgar meddling with the affairs with which the public
has nothing to do, he begs to leave the defence of the system to his
contemporaries, who originated it.
WILLS.
We are happy to announce that JEREMIAH Humble JUMBI.E, º:
of the Regent's Park, has at last been induced to make his Will. It
was executed on Tuesday, in the presence of his maid-servant, and
Jº" SMITH, greengrocer and occasional waiter at private parties. We
think he ought to have done more for MRs. HUMBLE JUMBLE, who may
have her faults, and whose teeth are certainly false (we do not believe
that she paints), but who ought to have had the bulk of his property.
He gives her only £800 a year, and adds the cowardly, condition, that
if she remarries, she is to have but £400. The rest of his estate goes
to his so-called nephew, WoRBI.Eton, WILRs, of the War Office, who
may be said to be in luck, and who will now, we hope, pay his unfor-
tunate tailors (we use the plural advisedly), and take his grandmother's
watch out of pawn. There are a few legacies, but MR. HUMBLE
JUMBLE does not appear to us to have one of those hands described
by our immortal Bard, we refer to the sweet Swan of Avon, as open
to melting charity, for his cousin the tallow-chandler gets nothing, and
though he is in the habit of talking a good deal about the poor, we have
reason to believe that there are few bequests to the excellent institutions
with which our noble Metropolis is so plentifully studded. He leaves
£50 to the Zoological Gardens, perhaps from his admiration of the
manners of the bears, and £50 to the Society for Relief of Complaints
of the Ear, which his friends playfully say is but right, considering
what an awful bore he is. On the whole, we cannot think that this
Will does the testator much credit, but he has yet time to amend it
by a codicil. Werbum sap.
MRs. Lushington BLAck Both ERBy’s Will has been made more
than two years, but owing to the unfortunate incorruptibility of her
lady's maid, we regret to say that we have not yet been able to obtain
a sight of it, though we know that it is kept in the lid of her dressing-
case. . But we have secondary evidence of its contents, and shall not
be a hundred miles from the fact, if we say that a certain handsome
Captain in a crack regiment will not be so grateful to the “old girl.”
as he gives his brother officers reason to think he ought to be.
MRs B. has been lending a favouring ear to the unctuous addresses of
an elegant divine whose chapel is within easy reach of her heuse at
Peckham, and though we all know that the clergy scorn personal
bequests, the Rºv, ORIGEN BANG may not be displeased to know that
if he likes to rebuild St. Vitus’s, he will in due time be able to do so,
and if not, he may apply £5000 according to his own discretion. The
lady does not intend to “die and endow a college or a cat,” but she
presents a handsome sum to a retired housekeeper, who is to take charge
of a favourite parrot (we hope that we do not intrude into private
matters in stating that its name is “Bobby”) and is to hear it say,
“Twinkle, º little star,” every Sunday, and we may also add,
that the respectable tradesman, who supplies MRs. B. with her false
hair will findsomething beyond the amount of his bill set down for him.
LIEUTENANT BLARER BLAzes, R.N., Ramsgate, has long been in
such a state of brandy-and-water that his friends who know his gouty
tendencies have been affectionately anxious that he should make his
Will. But his confirmed habit of shying the boiling tea-kettle at any-
body who makes him a suggestion has somewhat interfered with their
Fº this consideration upon him. However, on Wednesday last
e had a bad touch, and his Doctor having put every missile out of
reach of the gallant and crippled Lieutenant, told him what his friends
thought. As soon as the torrent of sea-eloquence which burst out in
full flow had subsided, LIEUT. Blazes relieved his mind with a few
supplementary execrations, and, addressing his medical attendant by
the affectionate title of a slimy old lubber, ordered him to note down
heads for a Will. It was brief, and gave everything to the Royal
Naval College, except £100 to the Doctor, and £500 to a lady of Ports-
mouth, whose alias it might be imprudent to disclose. The Will was
duly made, and the Lieutenant has sat upon it ever since; but as it
does not exactly harmonise with the views of the testator's next of
kin, we believe that “fforts will be made to withdraw it from under
him. Should these succeed, our readers shall be informed. There are
whispers of a duplicate Wii. in which case the exertions of the
relatives may not meet with the reward they deserve.
MRs. SAMUEL Softhead, widow, formerly MADEMoiselle ALICAM-
PANE, of the theatres, has just made her Will, which she had long,
from !". motives, refused to do, but to which she has been
driven by the unmistakeable commands of some Spirit-Rapping with
which she has lately been much troubled. Her numerous bequests
would occupy too large a space in our columns for us to give them at
length, but the public has a right to know that one who formerly
earned her living on the boards has not been quite unmindful of the
companions of her youth. To MR.SPLUTTER, the celebrated tragedian,
she gives a ring, and the same to MR. SINNews, the well-known
harlequin. She bequeathes £100 to the Epicurean Club, to buy a
picture, in memory of the fact that standing on its steps, out of the

his umbrella that day and his heart the next. She gives three
dozen of her best brandy to an eminent dramatic author, with
her French dictionary, and a complete edition of the Théâtre

fully calls “My Toads,” and for whom she says she will find holes
during the rest of their lives. We do not know, and therefore cannot
say, whether the fashionable DR. Bough CRouchER will like being
included in this list, but a plaster of £500, may reconcile that worthy

self would say. She gives all her physic bottles, many hundreds in
number, to her maid, PHOEBE Jones, and her wigs to Miss Ogleton,
of the Royal Amethyst Theatre. We are º y to add, for the
information of the public, that MRs. S., is very well, that her signature
is distinct, and that the only orthographic error in a codicil, in her own
hand, is that in naming MR. Scraper, her corn-cutter, she calls him
that palarvering old cheer-up-odist.

So from the Union straight withdraw,
And play the Free Soil game.

And who'll resign to your cowhide
The fugitives again? -
Absquotilate, then, slick as grease,
And break up Unity, .
Or take your PRESIDENT in peace,
And eat your humble pie.
But if your stomachs proud disdain,
That salutary meal, -
And you, in passion worse than vain.
Must rend the Commonweal,
Then all mankind will jest and scoff
At people in the case,
Of him that hastily cut off
His nose to spite his face.

SAXON LAW IN CANADA.
WHAT a pity it is that magnetic, connection between England and
North America remains to be established. It is much to be wished
that the wire destined to unite the Mother. Country and her American
Colonies were at the bottom of the sea, in its new coat of SILVER's
India-rubber, and in working order; for then the Canadian, Govern-
ment might be rescued from the imminent peril of undertaking
a load of infamy, as heavy and as noisome as that which crushes
and befouls the Court of Saxony. It is a fact that two British
American Judges, CHIEF Justice Robinson and Justice BuBNs,
Judges of the Čanadian Court of Queen's Bench, have actually
decided for the extradition of ANDERson, the man of colour who
stabbed a fellow named SENECA. T. P. Digges pursuing and trying
to capture him as a fugitive slave, in Missouri, more than seven years
ago. ANDERson killed this villain in self-defence, and Robinson
and BURNs would surrender him as a murderer! These men—at
present two of HER MAJESTY's Judges—virtually recognise the
legality of slavery in º the º of an escaped slave to
defend his liberty. They have decided for delivering up this mulatto
to miscreants who, if they get him, will probably burn him alive with
green wood. -
Justice M'LEAN has kept his ermine sweet and clean. He dissented
from the monstrous opinion of his colleagues, on the ground that the
evidence against the accused was insufficient. An appeal was applied
for by ANDERson's Counsel; and the case may ultimately be brought
before the Privy Council in England, which, it is enough to say, among
its members includes LoRD BRough AM. The Colonial Government
may thus be saved from defiling itself with the abomination of Saxony,
But then, on the other hand, the application for an appeal may fail, and
ANDERson may be soon writhing and roasting in a slow fire, whilst
issourian savages are yelling and dancing around the stake.
Were the submarine wire now extending between the Home and
Canadian Governments, the unhappy man might, by a flash of tele-
graphic lightning, be saved from the clutches of the infuriated fiends
to whom he may be consigned by the sentence of CHIEF JUSTICE
Robinson and the other Justice, ominously named BURNs. In one of
its senses the word Tradition means treason. If anything in the
Treaty of Extradition with the United States warrants the doom which
those judges have pronounced on ANDERson, then is extradition, in so
far, a word that means extraordinary treason, and the diplomatists who
conceded it were traitors of the deepest dye.

as shown by this provision, and by hundreds of other acts of Your
Honour’s, not to speak of Your Honour's Lady, and the Young
Ladies (all of whom he humbly wishes a ãº. New Year, if he
may be so bold), takes the liberty to believe that Your Honour cannot
know that Your Petitioner's cottage, on Your Honour's estate,

A LAMENT OF THE SEASON.
By AN OLD Boy.
I’M sick of Transformation scenes,
old and silver foil,
Blue fire and clustered ballet-girls,
And sinks and flies and toil;
I’m sick of trees that open
And temples that expand,
And flowers as big as warming-pans—
I’m sick of fairy-land!
I used to think when I was young,
That fairy-land was fair;
But now I know ’tis tinsel all,
With red-fire fumes for air;
A land of traps and pit-falls—
A land of sloats and stays,
And scruto-work and profiling,
And shivering coryphées.
Where are the joys of Pantomime
I knew in days of yore?
The poker-hot-the butter-slide—
The Clown laid at the door
That shopmen bland and affable
Might o'er him tumble down—
The murdered babe, whose body
Was sat on by the Clown?
Then Columbine was something
Surpassing mortal grace;
And Harlequin bore mystery,
Writ on his vizored face.
Clown's pockets had no bottom;
grin passed humour's bounds;
For mirth and wit, his “Here we are 1"
Was first of human sounds!
How.changed is all! The mystic four,
With scared and shrunken mien,
Limp lamely in to justify
A formation scene.
The down-trod Clown some slaps and cuffs,
Still timidly essays,
But sins and steals and slays no more,
As in the early days.
The magic's gone from Columbine,
A dancer takes her place;
The mystery of Harlequin
Is fled—he shows his face,
And, oh could BARNEs's ghost reseek
The glimpses of the moon,
What would it say to what we see
By way of Pantaloon?
That weary introduction,
Half ballet, half burlesque,
Those monster masks, those painful puns,
Most grave, when most grotesque;
That crowd o ſ: short-coated girls,
That feeble fairy queen,
And worst of all inflictions,
That Transformation scene!
Oh, scene-painters—oh, carpenters—
Oh, managers, forbear!
I've seen your flowers, your fountains,
Your castles in the air,
Your slowly opening aloes,
Your widely-spreading trees—
Your girls in all positions—
Excepting “stand at ease.”
Your gold and silver tinsel,
Your foil and whirling wheels,
Your fires of hue red green or blue,
Till my poor brain-pan reels,
One transformation trick alone
Is left, and that, Iween,
Is to transform, by leaving out,
Your Transformation scene.

“By the treaty of Tien-tsin the Chinese Indemnity is fixed at eightmillion taels."
Now, will it be believed that, on reading this, the Wiscount imagined
that these taels were actually pigtails, and, with true commercial mind,

which they would have when thrown upon the hair market.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LA GLOIRE AND LA CRINOLINE.
In the Times' account of the launch of The Warrior there occurs the
subjoined passage relative to her rival, La Gloire:-
“The speed of La Gloire has been stated to be twelve knots. Now, if the state-
ment of one of her officers is to be believed (an officer, too, thoroughly acquainted
with her engines), the utmost speed that has been obtained from her has been short
of eleven knots, and at this speed the vibration of the stern was so considerable,
that it was evident the armour plates would all work loose if it was long maintained:
Nine and a half to ten knots an hour is stated to be her utmost average speed, and | Riº
this must be considered as a high rate for a ship of such size and weight. None
attempt to deny the fact that in a sea-way La Gloire rolls almost dangerously. ..In
fact, all iron-clad frigates must roll slowly and deeply, if in their construction
especial pains are not taken to guard against such a defect.”
La Gloire ought to be a caution, as our American friends say, to all
iron-clad frigates; and especially to La Crinoline. The speed of La
Crinoline is seriously diminished by the extensive ribs of metal which
constitute the framework of her iron-bound sides. Especial pains must
be taken with the construction of her iron clothing, to prevent her from
i. in a dangerous manner, or at least to counteract her disposition
to rolſ as she floats along. Otherwise we shall certainly have her, one
of these fine days, wriggling all her iron-works loose, to the derision of
the beholders, in consequence of the vibration for which she is as
remarkable as La Gloire.
ANOTHER SHADOW PANTOMIME.
IN reward for having been an exceedingly good boy, and especially
for having shown such virtuous self-denial as to decline on Christmas
Day a fourth helping of plum-pudding, MASTER SM-TH (the name may
be familiar to our readers, but still we do not, feel ourselves at liberty
to publish it) was last week taken as a treat % his benevolent Papa to
see the Shadow Pantomime at the Crystal Palace. Being strongly
impressed with the wonders he beheld there, and having like most boys
an imitative disposition, MASTER SM-TH, on coming hºme, determined
to get up a shadow pantomime himself, and to exhibit it upon the
boards, or walls, of his own nursery. Appointing MASTER J-N-s his
machinist and stage carpenter, and MAstER BR-WN his gasfitter, pro-
perty-man and prompter (which three offices, there being neither gas
nor prompting, and but very little property, that young gentleman was
deemed fully competent to fill), MAstER SM-TH reserved the heavier
hº to himself, and undertook, with the assistance of his sister and
the baby
piece. The pen-work being considered quite a secondary matter, it
will of course be left to be knocked off at the last, moment, in the
manner now adopted on the modern stage; the usual plan requiring,
for the guidance of the dresser, the author to sketch roughly two or
three of the chief characters, having a due eye to the state of the
wardrobe, so as not to put the management to unnecessary expense.
The piece not being yet enough advanced for a rehearsal, we are
unable of course to give an accurate account of it. So far as we
can learn, the Introduction, in accordance with the fashion of late years,
.*. less of pure pantomime than of
broad burlesque. One of the scenes, we
hear, will be laid on Ramsgate pier, where
Miss SM-TH was last season, nearly carried
out to sea, owing to a stiff, Sou. Wester
- which was blowing, and which inflated her
stiff petticoat like the top of a balloon., A
small º terrier that was with her had
his hair blown over his eyes so that he could
not see, and had not his mistress taken him
in her arms, there is reason to believe he
would have walked over, the side, and come
; what a farce-writer has termed a watery
ler.
The unities of time and place will apparently
be set quite at defiance by the author, for in the
Hººft following scene a shadow-slide is shown upon
y nearly '' the pavement, and from Ramsgate in the
dog-days we find ourselves transported to Londonin mid-winter. A great
effect is here expected to be caused by the sudden apparition of an awful
Beadle, (father of Columbine, and
º to Pantaloon), who, emerging
round a corner, puts, to flight the
sliders, but being far too fat to run
can only strike a tragic attitude, an
bid the boys “behoff!”
The harlequinade of course will be
full of life and bustle, and will contain
the usual hits at passing follies and
events. One of the scenes, we under-
stand, will represent a juvenile º
where the guests, although they
come like shadows, and even so depart,
will apparently be feasted with a most
to do the *...i and managing, and to write the
e
and be, stuffed with sickening sweet things as they
The silly fashion too of treating them to actual
champagne will be shadowed forth in all its
darkest, colours; and a doctor with, a Brob-
dignaglike black dose, in his hand will rise by
M. of warning, in the middle of the banquet,
unfolding as a scroll, the label to the bottle,
“Coming, events, cast their shadows before.” An
= attempt too, will be made to take off the pre-
posterous absurdities of dress wherewith, when
they go visiting, children often now are tortured:
for MASTER SM-TH declares that what with short
Hºº frocks and with Crinoline the little girls at his
****** last soirée looked so much like teetotums that
he scarcely could restrain himself from giving them a twizzle.
Another scene is laid in a photographic studio, where Clown gets his
so-called likeness taken, and as it is not a bit like him he declares, by
pantºmime, that he will not, pay, for it. The
“artist,” as he calls himself, threatens by dumb
show that he will send for a policeman, whereat
Clown appears, alarmed, intimates that artist
may make another trial, and be paid for both.
Artist hides his head in his camera obscura,
and no sooner has he done so than Clown
gives him a “bonneter", and bolts out of the
studio, while Pantaloon who, has been pouching
all the “portraits” in the place, hoists them on
a gibbet, and proclaims they are “HIGH ART.”
The silhouettes which, TER SM-TH has per-
mitted us to publish, will afford the world, some
notion of his shadow pantomime, which with the
modesty of authors, he quite expects will throw all rivals in the shade.
These silhouettes, he tells us, are all done by
his own hand, but we believe that it was
guided by that of his big sister. We reserve
the boldest of them for the last, and as the
sketch speaks for, itself, we need only say
this more for it. that it represents a street
scene towards the finish of the pantomime,
and pictures the occurrence of a small do-
mestic incident which will at once be recog:
mised as being true to life, detection and
the usual street scrimmage will ensue: and
as a bonneted policeman is generally sure to
make a gº succeed, we doubt not
MASTER SM-TH's will be abundantly success-
ful, and when all the shadow characters have
danced their final shadow-dance, the curtain
will descend upon a blaze of triumph, and
the pantomime will be pronounced (by him) the “best of the season.”

Jocose Fiend. “Ah, Sir, you was wery nearly down that time."
FRANCE AND THE FASHIONS.
We wonder whether, now that one can go to France without a pass-
port, Edwin will more often be asked by ANGELINA to take her over
to Paris to see what the new fashions are, whether bonnets are worn
spoon-shaped or 3 l'écaille d’huitre, whether Crinoline shows any symp-
tom of decay, and whether flounces may be added to hide creases in
the skirts, the Queen of Fashion clearly holds her Court in Paris,
and thither must her votaries month by month repair to learn what
it may please her to order them to wear. How omnipotent her sway
is everybody knows, but we own we had not learnt until a recent
writer taught us that sentiment and fashion go sometimes hand in
hand, and friendship is displayed with the show of a new toilet. This
at least we take for granted from this interesting passage in the Illus-
trated News, and we so much value the knowledge it imparts that we
will not censure the mild pun with which it opens:-
“Of all the Paris fashions the most Parisian is the custom of wishing a ‘Happy
New Year, a ... which trenches far upon the month of January, and renders
that month remarkable for demonstrations of toilet and friendly sentiment."
The compliments of the season are doubtless different in France to
what they are with us. In England one is satisfied with wishing you
a “Merry Christmas and a º New Year;” whereas in Paris
doubtless the proper thing to do when one makes a morning call upon
the First of January is to forge some well-turned compliment upon the
sit of one's friend's dress, or to say that her new bonnet most charm-
ingly becomes her. As ladies go to church to show of their new
fineries, so in France they call on friends for a purpose not dissimilar.
Such visits are no doubt productive of some pleasure, or they would
not be persisted in. Indeed the female mind delights in giving cause
for envy, and if MADAME GRos De NAPLes can but feel that her new
plumage has left a pang of jealousy in some few of her bosom friends,
she would doubtless view her morning as by no means an ill-
spent one.
It is, however, somewhat curious to note with what precision the
writers on the fashions know what is right to wear, and how imperious
on the point are the mandates of the miliners. We suppose that no
one even in the first society would ever dare to dress herself except by
their advice, or in any way to act against the regulations following:-
“The New Year's visits of 1861 are to be paid in neat and quiet costume, both as
regards dresses and bonnets. The former must be new and the latter fresh. The
stuffs now generally adopted for winter wear are robes de fantasie, plain or brocaded :
the superior qualities of poplin are also in favour. Merinos are almost entirely dis-
carded for the present season, on account of their flaccidity."
Ladies with scant pin-money or parsimonious husbands, and who
may not have a “new” dress and “fresh” bonnet in their wardrobes,
must not dream this season of paying New Year's calls, but must sit
and sigh at home in unfashionable wretchedness. With regard, how-
ever to bonnets we are not sorry to learn that:—
“The fashions for bonnets are just now sufficiently irregular to allow room for the
we have conceived that ladies dressed entirely by the dictates of their
milliners, and were not allowed to exercise their private taste and
judgment. The proper thing to do was to walk into a shop, and
having there learnt what was worn, unquestioning to order it. No
matter if the fashion were suitable or not to her peculiar person, every
lady, we supposed, was held bound to conform to it. Upon no other
ground at least could we comprehend the fact of the wondrously ill-
chosen and ill-suiting dresses seen here. But now we joy to learn, as
far as bonnets are concerned, ladies will be suffered to display their
own good taste, and we may depend that they will soon look all the
prettier for it. We have long considered it an insult to their intellect
that they should submit to the caprices of their dressmakers. And as
for their requiring to be told what are the “most important require-
ments for a chapeau,” (why can't the man say “bonnet?”) trust a
woman for insisting that her bonnet should sit well, and not make her
look older one whit than she can help it.
One other brief extract, and we have done for the present with this
interesting subject:-
“We must briefly allude to the new petticoat, the jupon multiple as it is very pro-
perly called, for it may be made to take the dimensions of two, three, four, or five
petticoats, as occasion may require, although but one article of dress. For this it is
only necessary to add or take away so many layers of muslin, which can be attached
or abstracted with the greatest facility.”
A petticoat which is capable of expansion to the size of four or even
five, must be viewed as an alarming article of dress. Who knows but
that ladies before going to a party might conspire with one another to
enter somewhat limp, and gradually to swell out as the evenin
advanced? Conceive the consternation of the male people assemble
on finding themselves more and more squeezed up and blockaded, with-
out any perceptible addition to the company. º jupon multiple be
patronised in England (and, if popular in Paris, it is pretty sure to he
so) we shall expect to hear that ladies when they issue invitations will
specify precisely the exact amount of Crinoline they wish their guests
to wear, so as to fill their rooms and not to overcram them. If this result
be gained we shall certainly be tempted to give praise to this new pet-
ticoat, and every soirée that we go to, we shall bless its kind inventress.
People who declare the days of Crinoline are numbered may not be
encouraged much by what we have just told them. If jupons can be
made to multiply five-fold, the shadow of wide skirts does not seem
likely to grow less. But at any rate there will be some slight conso-
lation in the thought that their wearers will be able to contract them-
selves at pleasure, or as “occasion” (justly personated by their
husbands or their parents) may sensibly “require.”

intend the distribution of his New Year's Gifts. Among the fortunate

his Lordship's hospitalities. -

To the EMPEROR or THE FREnch was sent apicture of The Warrior,
that he might have it framed as a companion to La Gloire. -
To his Holiness the Pope, Mr. Punek sent his last Volume, which,
being the mouthpiece of the English nation, would show the sympathy
existing in the English mind.
To Wiscount WILLIAMs was presented an article on Cheeseparing,
composed for the Economist, but *; by that print.
To GENERAL GARIBALDI Mr. Punch despatched a sword for the
ºmies campaign, with “Freedom of Italy” engraved upon the
acle.
To MR. BRIGHT was given a pair of rose-coloured spectacles, to

A very meat Present for the Young Mother of a Large Family of Small

NEW Al RS FOR VOLUNTEER BUGLES.
MR. Punch, as the sworn º of the trite and common-place,
suffers sadly—in common with all England-under the wearisome
repetition and*...; sameness of the speeches with which his darlings,
the Ladies of England, grace the bugles they present to the Rifle
Volunteers of their respective neighbourhoods. He is never tired of
the fair presenters of these martial instruments. There is no sameness
about them / From MRs. CAPTAIN SLAsher's sloe-black eyes and
raven locks, to MRs. Col. Gushington's violet orbs and golden
tresses, he revels in all the delicate shades of the Beautiful that lie
between the bewildering brunette and the bewitching blonde. Happy
fellow ! Has he not Roman noses and retroussés, chiselled Grecian
profiles and provocative gipsy loveliness, slim, slender, fawn-like
graces, and ripe, round, melting embonpoint-to disport among, as the
butterfly sips at will through all the delicious varieties of conservatory
and flower-garden?
No! Mr. Punch wishes for no change in the ladies; but he sadly
desiderates a little change in their speeches. Who does not know the
stereotyped form:—The hope that this bugle, which, &c., may never
sound except in, &c., &c, but that if ever, &c., &c., then we feel sure
that, &c., &c., &c. . . .
Mr. Punch, always thinking of the dear ladies, begs to suggest a few
variations on this eternal Wolunteer Bugle air, as, for example:—
“Wolunteers of the Fourth Beefshire, The ladies of the neighbour-
hood having got up a subscription to present you with a set of silver
bugles (because it is the fashion to present silver bugles, and the
ladies of Beefshire are determined not to be hehind the fashion), have
requested me to make a speech on the occasion. It is a horrid bore;
but as I'm your Commanding Officer's wife, I can't refuse,_and, after
all, it’s pleasant to have a good reason for insisting on a pretty new
bonnet. "I am sure you are very smart fellows, and look uncommonl
well in your uniforms. You shoot very fairly, I'm told, and go throu {
your company and battalion movements quite as steadily as can be
expected. I've no doubt you will behave like Englishmen if ever you
are required to fight, though I don’t think there's the least chance of
it—or I shouldn't have been quite so ready to allow my husband to take
the command of the corps. I'm afraid not many of you know the
bugle-calls, even when they are sounded on {'. light infantry drill
parades. If it ever came to actual "... don't think, from all I
can find out, that there's the least probability of bugle-calls being
either understood or attended to; and I should recommend you, in
such an event, by all means to leave these silver bugles at home, and
you are likely to run away, but you might. I only hope that if you do,
3 your *: will magnanimously refuse to sound "the retreat’ on this
ugle; though I’m afraid, if he should, he’ll be liable to be shot by
the Articles of War.”
Or this:–
“Blowing one's own trumpet is a highly offensive practice. Perhaps,
in this matter of Volunteering, we have indulged a little too much in
that style of performance. So, without saying what I hope or what '.
feel sure of, I beg to hand you the bugle we’ve subscribed for, and
I trust you'll make a good use of it.”
SOMETHING LIKE A PEER.
MR. Sidney HERBERT is created a Peer. Nobody deserves the
honour better than the able, indefatigable, eloquent, and courteous
WAk-Secretary, to whom Mr. Punch hereby liquors, and will be
happy to see his fordship to wet his coronet, whenever he likes to call
at No. 85. Mr. Punch has heard, that, in playful, allusion to the title
civilly given to MR. Her BERT by an ill-conditioned M.P., his Lordship
thought of being called Lord ſº. but that the vicious pronun-
ciation of a territorial aristocracy might have confounded him with
Lord MUNster, which would have been awkward. Unluckily, there
is a Lord Wiiton, unhappily known by his muffish patronage of
street-organs, or that would have been the befitting name for MR.
Herbert. However, he must mind and take a title which Mr. Punch
can rhyme to, as the latter and elder nobleman hopes to have several
civil things to say of the later and younger one.

THESE THINGS ARE AN ALLEGORY.
We have waited patiently for some of our contempo-
raries to point the moral of the launch of The Warrior,
but without effect, Mr. Punch therefore takes up his own
É. to point out the delicate compliment, and ingenious
istorical suggestion, which the Admiralty authorities
contrived to combine in the ceremonial which accompanied
the introduction of the first of England's fleet of Ironsides
to Father Thames. It is not often that His Grace the
DUKE OF SomeRSET condescends to be complimentary,
and J/r. Punch values the tribute to himself which he is
about to record all the more because there are so few of
the same kind where that came from.
When the dog-shores were knocked away from The
Warrior, she obstinately refused to move for a con-
siderable time. Hydraulic presses and jack-screws were
applied without effect. She treated with contempt the
coercion both of water and iron. Who was she, that she
should yield to the very elements which she had been built
to defy P But at last, hawsers were laid out to a couple
of tugs, and when we mention that the one tug was
“The Napoleon,” and the other tug “The Punch,” need
we say that The Warrior complied with the solicitations of
the latter, and showed her sense of the influences of the
former, by gracefully and grandly gliding into the bosom
of the Thames.
Yes, it was a pretty thought of their Lordships and
shows a nice perception of the national sentiment. It
is NApoleon and Punch together that have launched The
h'arrior. If the former had not led the way with La Gloire,
we should have had no Marrior. If the latter had not
blown up the zeal of their Lordships, and kept alive the
determination of the public, The Warrior, might never have
got beyond the stage of designs and specifications. As it
is, “NAPoleon impellente, et jubente Punch,” The Warrior
is afloat at last. The facts must have reinained, whether
their Lordships had recognised them or not ; but, we
repeat, it was a graceful act of their lordships to christen
the two tugs which brought The Warrior into the water,
“The Napoleon” and “The Punch.” It is not oſten that
these two Potentates can meet pleasantly, but in this
operation of floating The Warrior, Punch was for once
delighted to find himself alongside NATOLEON.
CAN HAVE,
MECHANICAL BAB|E.S.
The French, we know, are eminently a new-year's-giſt-presenting
3. and we therefore cannot wonder that advertisements of articles
eemed suitable for presents should at this season be found in great
numbers in their newspapers. Some of the things, however, are such
preposterous absurdities that we cannot well conceive that any one
would purchase them, especially if purposed for gifts du Jour de l’An.
For instance, we see notice of “un baby mécanique,” which some in-
ventive genius has ingeniously constructed, and which is warranted to
crawl and walk and fight, and to be as great a nuisance as a real living
baby very often is. We are informed by the advertisement that if we
heard it cry on being put to bed we certainly should call it “wn
petit diablotin,” and doubtless, in addition to its other charming quali-
ties this “baby mécanique” can scream and squeal and squall as loudly as
an infant of actual flesh and blood. Very clever certainly, but cui bonof
we must ask. real babies getting so extremely scarce in Paris
that mechanical contrivances are required to act as proxies? or are
babies there esteemed such angels in a house, that husbands wish to
have them perpetually in it, and therefore fill their place by deputy
when the real things are absent? But, wonder upon wonders, why are
babies mécaniques expressly advertised as being suitable for presents?
Is a baby such a luxury that nobody of prudence would go to the
expense of it, any more than one would purchase the costly inutilities
wherewith, as wedding presents, one's drawing-room is decorated? Or
can it be that these toy-babies are intended to be given out of spite by
married people to their bachelor acquaintances, of whose freedom from
annoyance they may possibly be envious?
However this may be, we think that the invention is quite worthy of
our notice, and if it succeeds in a pecuniary point, we doubt not that
competitors will speedily spring up. If the motion be worked out upon
a rather larger scale, mechanical º and girls perhaps may be con-
structed, mature enough to play sorts of pleasant pranks, from
burning all the knots in all the floors with the bright poker, to
ºratºhing names upon the windows, and waylaying the sweetſ between
tº store room and the supper one, in the manner of the living enfants
9átés et terribles who infest society at the present day. Meanwhile,
we shall expect to hear that a mechanical prize baby show is started,
where these advertising Frankensteins will exhibit all their monsters:
and we would hint in all humility that the first Fº should be given
to the “baby mécanique” which shows itself the most unlike the
average of life models. A baby that should never squeal on being
looked at, nor squall on being washed, that, should eat without a
slobber and sleep without the constant surveillance of its nurse, that
should take its auiseed as calmly as its pap, and never make its father
get out of bed to rock it, or to dandle it about, that should cut its
teeth without becoming, fractious, and show no signs of tetchiness
when handed round to kiss, that should not attempt to throw its
mother into fits by choking itself daily with rapidity of suction, or, by
endeavouring to swallow its coral or its rattle or the watch that its big
brother has been holding to its ear, or whatever other article, not
meant for digestion, it can contrive to grasp.--such a baby.clearly is
not to be expected in the natural course of things, and if made by
mechanism would only serve to show how wide a gulf there is between
man's nature and his art.
COUGH No MORE 1"
A GREAT mistake is very often made in the treatment of coughs,
which at seasons such as the present are *: troublesome in families.
The medicines prescribed for the relief of these distracting affections
are generally sweetened, with a view to render them palatable. This
is a great mistake. Instead of that, a cough mixture, especially, if
intended for children, ought to be rendered as nauseous as possible.
Take of Compound Decoction of Aloes, Infusion of Gentian, Infusion
of Senna, Winegar of Squills, and Tincture of Assafoetida equal parts.
Mix. A teaspoonful or less, according to age, to be taken, whenever
the cough is troublesome such is the influence of the mind over the
body, that if this compound isº and rigorously administered,
the most troublesome cough will, in many instances, very soon cease
from troubling.

CRUELTY OF MAMMON.
THE Bank of England has again suddenly raised its rate of discount, and we deeply regret
to state that this palpitation of the heart of Commerce, as we may call it, has caused the
#. and most widely spread inconvenience throughout the social system of the country.
four own knowledge we can speak of several distressing cases that have occurred in the
Metropolis, in consequence of this ill-considered operation in the Bank Parlour. MR,GUSHER,
of Gray's Inn, had made an appointment with his laundress to go through her book, make a
rest, and take steps towards liquidation of the debt, but on hearing the news from the
Bank, he was compelled to cut off in a Hansom, an hour before the time, and depart for his
holiday without the intended interview., M.R. WoBBLEs, of Alfred Place, Tottenham Court
Road, met the financial crisis in a bolder manner, for he at once wrote to his tailor, and
informed him that he had a choice between himself taking up an acceptance of MR. WoRBLE's,
due that day, or permitting it to receive the notarial label indicative of absence of provision
for the transaction. MR. SLAMMER, of the Adelphi Terrace, who had promised his nephews a
box at the theatre opposite him, was compelled to send them, instead, some orders for an
Orrery lecture at º and he himself gone to Paris. Nor did the hardship confine
itself to the sterner sex, but as usual, helpless woman was the sufferer. MRs. TIDDycombe,
wife of a promising solicitor at Islington, was informed that she could not have the Droguet
on which her eyes and heart had been so long set, and MR. PLASTERBY, of Brixton, apprised
his amiable wife that if she insisted (which she did) on having a christening breakfast after
the baptism of PETER JAMEs, the last .# no dearer wine than Marsala would appear on
the semi-sacred board, and we need hardly add that MRs. PLASTERBY had spirit enough to
defer the entire ceremonial until better times
should arrive. Such are the consequences of
ill-judged financial measures on the part of an
irresponsible executive in the city.

Each moment growing stronger,
Proclaim a break-up imminent–

Locked, all in stagnant sleep, so long,

Floats alſ adrift, and melting slow,
About the Roman see. -

And aye the higher show it makes
Above the wave it darkens,
The louder those sun-hammers sound,
At work for him that hearkens;
God speed the light! the thick ribbed bonds
Drip, drip, in silvery tinkles;
The huge and hoary fronts of frost
Gape into yawning wrinkles—
here’s a great thaw coming, boys, &c.
Ułº the Arctic Circle,
his thaw will have its way;
E’en Russia's huge º:
Shows symptoms of decay. -
That throne uplift—you’ll find a rift:
Rip up those barrack-floors,
To right and left run crack and cleft,
Defying props and shores. .
There's a great thaw coming, boys, &c.
The palace fronts show white and fair,
The palace-walls seem strong,
But in the sun they'll melt and run
Their gorgeous guests among.
The Neva sleeps, a frost-bound slave,
Held down with pile and pin:
But there's a beam can loose the stream,
And send it roaring in-
There’s a great thaw coming, boys, &c.
See, ’tis the Kaiser, driving
is iron-runnered sleigh— -
The horses spring, the sleigh-bells ring,
His escort clears the way;
The Kaiser's ear is dull to hear,
His eye is dull to see-
As on his road, that seems so broad
And smooth, he gallops free.
There’s a great thaw coming, boys, &c.
Yet sure he sees the yawning cracks,
That shoot their net-work fine,
And all about him and athwart
The treacherous surface mine.
And sure he hears the growl and groan,
Sharp crash and grinding sounds,
That tell the ice has broken up, I-
The streams have burst their bounds!
There’s a great thaw coming, boys, &c.
Nor e'en the Atlantic Ocean,
This wide débâcle bars,
It rends the Stripes, like bursting pipes,
And scattereth the Stars.
The Union heaves and shuts and cleaves,
...And none is bold to say
If it will hold together still,
Or melt in shards away.
There’s a great thaw coming, boys, &c.

But far above the awful stir
Of re-awakened life
Stands England, watchful, hand on hilt,
Seeking nor shunning strife.
She fears no thaw, as linked by law,
Her oak's deep roots unto-
Let drift who will, she standeth still,
Her destined work to do. .
There’s a great thaw coming, boys,
Its signs are ever stronger,
There's a great thaw coming, boys,
Wait a little longer!
A PAYING LINE.
PERsons desirous of making a handsome addition to their incomes
by a light and gentlemanly, if not elegant employment, at least one
involving very little physical or mental exertion, and only requiring a
considerable amount of moral ºf: will perhaps discern, from the
subjoined paragraph picked out of the North British Mail, that there
is an opening through which they may easily realise some money:-
“Execution ERs' FEEs.—Calcraft, the well-known hangman, has informed the
Magistrates of Dumbarton that his fee for coming to Dumbarton on the 18th
current, to execute Lunnay, would be £21, and travelling and personal expenses
paid."
Twenty-one pounds is a ºf: sum for hanging a man, and if the man
is a bad one, it is more than he is worth, unless able to earn as much
over and above his keep, in which case it would be cheaper to work
him than to hang him. A surgeon, for performing an operation and
thereby saving a life, would under ordinary circumstances be very well
paid by the fee of £21, which Jack Ketch obtains for destroying his
patient. For cutting off a bad member of Society by a process, asking
no knowledge of anatomy, and only the simplest manual skill, J. K.
receives no less than M.R.C.S. does for amputating a limb; and more
indeed: travelling and personal expenses paid into the bargain. To be
sure, the doctor sometimes charges for expenses of travelling, booked
under the head of "Iter,” which the other practitioner would perhaps
enter as “Gurny.” But he makes no claim for those of a personal
nature, such as MR. CALCRAFT's; namely, perhaps, the cost of first-rate
accommodation at the best hotel, inclusive of dinner consisting of three
courses and dessert, with plenty of excellent claret and champagne.
One would like to ascertain the number of cigars comprised in CAL-
cRAPT's personal expenses, and their quality; indeed to know, whose
and what cigars CALGRAPT smokes. Of course MR. CALCRAFT is quite
right in demanding these terms if he can get them; but they are cer.
tainly high, and can only be maintained in the absence of competition.
Jack Ketch is naturally opposed to the doctrine of Live and Let Live;
but hanging is no º;
The field of the º orm is open to average ability, and all may
compete for the office of executioner. The contest for that distin-
guished employment does not as yet, however, impose on candidates
the necessity of a competitive examination. In good time it will come
to that, no doubt. The competitors for the hangman's place will have
to answerquestions in mathematics, as touching right lines for instance;
in geography, astronomy, and history; particularly the history of
England, so implicated with the block. The manufacture of hemp
the process of rope-making, the growth and preparation of timber, wi
also be subjects wherein their proficiency will be tested. Then the
position of Finisher of the Law will be the reward of talent and indus:
try; at present it is º: * to the lowest bidder who is *::::::
to ſº satisfactory proof of his competency to execute its functions
and those whom they concern. -
The remuneration of º *.*. rise again when the
standard of their education shall have been raised by the application of
the competitive principle. Therefore gentlemen of moderate abilities
and, acquirements should take the opportunity, whilst it remains, of
º by tender to the right quarter, for employment in the capacity
of Jack Ketch. Let them write, irrespectively of grammar, to the
High Sheriff of the County, who has that piece of preferment at his
disposal. He is bound to hang, condemned criminals with his own
hands, or find a substitute for the performance of the exalted duty
which the law assigns to English country gentlemen in appointing
High Sheriffs to finish itself.
UNCERTAIN CURE OF SOULS.
The advertisement which, reference excepted, we annex from the
Times will be perused by a portion of our national clergy with a
painful interest:-
Nº. PRESENTATION for SALE to a RECTORY in the County
of Norfolk. Average income, £640. Population, 500. Age of incumbent, 90.
For further particulars the anxious reader is referred to certain
solicitors. The particulars, however, which it most imports him to
know are such as the legal gentleman may not be enabled to com:
municate. A confidential medical man is the only person who could
afford the querist satisfactory assurance on the point which it would
be his serious object to ascertain. Age of incumbent Ninety!, Ninety
years old! it is º a º: age, but when a man has lived so long
as that, there is a considerable chance that he may go on living a good
deal longer. “Oh, the uncertainty of human life! He who has reached
ninety may attain to a hundred. Ten years;-how short in retrospect,
in prospect how long and weary'. The nonagenarian may become a
centenarian. Is it well or ill with this aged pastor? Is his heart
right with regard to the valves and the vessels?—or hardened by ossi-
fication? o knoweth? No man but his medical. But will the
doctor reveal the desired ºf: Dare I ask him for such infor-
mation? Will hemot deem me a huckster in the cure of souls? Yea,
eradventure he may rebuke me as a hireling, and revile me to my
ace, calling me a simoniacal humbug and seeker after the unrighteous
mammon. Average income £640, and population only 500. The
vineyard is one that would be just the thing for such a labourer as me.
The very sphere of usefulness that I should like! But then the day
of entrance, of induction, of incumbency—it might be distant, it might
be at hand. Which?—Ah, which? Seventy would be better than
ninety. Three score and ten is man's º: time; but if anybody
is so strong as to reach threescore and twenty—if he once gets over
fourscore, confound it, there is no saying how long such an old fellow
as that may last. At ninety he has a chance of existing to the age of
Qld PARR, and it would be a deuced bore to fork out a lot of tin for a
living, and have to stand kicking one's heels a quarter of a century
lº. a dead man's shoes. One would hardly like to purchase
the crabshells without having some idea of when one might expect to
rejoice in them.”
Such are the reflections which, some or all of them, the above
advertisement is calculated to excite in a certain class of clerical
minds—including those of fast young divines, who purchase not only
their preferment but also their sermons; the latter said to be chiefly
composed by an inspired carpenter in Holborn.
A NEW GENTLEMAN.
SoMEwBERE in South Wales (wherever that is) there is a place
called Merthyr, and in that place lives an individual who has discovered
a new form of gentleman. The individual is the proprietor of a hotel,
and on his card is the following remark:-
* Incidental as well as Commercial Gentlemen are assured it is the desire as it is
the duty of the Proprietor to promote the comfort of his Patrons on Temperance
Principles.”
“Incidental Gentlemen.” Those are the new articles which have
been discovered in South Wales. Ever anxious to obtain information,
Mr. Punch begs to demand what is an incidental gentleman. Of course
he knows something about the word incidental, and that it is derived
from a Latin word meaning “falling in,” but this only increases the
confusion. Gentlemen who have been at a tavern have had the mis-
fortune of falling in, when trying to pass ditches or canals, but at a
Temperance tavern the requisite preparation can hardly have been gone
through. And then the apposition of “incidental” with “commercial”
is another mystification. "We have heard of incidents of commerce,
but the connectionis repudiated by our Welsh friend, who thinks a bag-
man cannot be incidental. Is the word a Welsh ornamentation of
Dental, and is the card an invitation to the Jew dentists who travel
about with dog-carts full of teeth, and whose advertisements scandalise
educated and legitimate odontologists * We have exhausted our
guesses, and once more demand an explanation, which must bein, some
£ivilised language, and therefore not in Welsh. What’s an incidental
gentleman?

“SIR, “Pharisee Villa.
“I HAVE made the discovery that women are not the kindly
and charitable ºf: which it is the fashion of poets, novelists, and
penny-a-liners to call them.
“There are a great number of claims made on behalf of benevolent
societies at this period of the year, I have frequently read such
appeals, at breakfast, to my wife and the girls.
“I had promised to set apart last Saturday evening for dining at
home with them, and then taking them to a private box at Covent
Garden Theatre.
“While taking a warm jelly, and some other trifles, for my lunch, at
FARRANCE's, my eye fell upon a very strong letter in the Times, asking
contributions to one of these excellent funds.
“My heart was touched, my dear Mr. Punch, and I telegraphed to
Camberwell that we would fº up the proposed pleasuring, and on
the following Tuesday I had the happiness of reading to my family,
from the newspaper, this acknowledgment, which will show you, also,
how I employed the money I had designed to throw away:—
“A Camberwell Father, being the price of a box he had intended to take at a
playhouse, (less the necessary expense, £1 5s. 6d. of his dinner that day
at the Club) - - £0 17s.
“Sir, will you believe it, neither my wife nor the girls, whom I had
really supposed full of kindheartedness, are pleased with this arrange-
ment, and, to speak plainly, they are actually sulky.

“DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW YOU ’RE OUTP ‘’
In the second column of the Times for some days lately there ap-
: the following more than usually mysterious and affecting
appeal:—
Diz. implores you to WRITE. Think of your Mother.
That Diz means the leader of the Conservative Opposition in the
House of Commons must be assumed of course; but who can be the
Pºrty to whom MR. Disraeli can address such an exhortation as
‘Think of your mother?” ...We discard the idea that the question can
have any social bearing, whether for good or evil. . It is fd.
Fº one, in our opinion. After the declaration in favour of Church
tes which the Ex-ChanceLLoR of the Exchequer made the other
day, it may most reasonably be surmised that the mother above referred
to is Mother Church, and that the anonymous individual addressed is
a parson who has run away, and, it is feared, means to go over to
Rome. This clerical fugitive we suppose it is that Diz. implores to
write, and begs him to think of his mother.
Ingenious Idea.
We know a Paterfamilias, who being disappointed of his Christmas
§: went furtively into his wife's bed-room, and brought down her
Sunday Crinoline, which he cleverly hung up in the middle of the
room, and made it do duty for a tree. Ornamented with drums, crackers,
wooden apples and pears, and the usual Noah's, Ark variety of zoolo-
gical bonbon-cases, and illumined with hundreds of little wax tapers,
the effect was quite a bit of fairy-land, and certainly no Crinoline ever
looked lighter. Unlike other Crinolines, it was not in any one's wa
either, though it shared ultimately the fate of all Crinolines, inasmuc
. every one's hand was raised against it until it was regularly picked

THE FACE OF NATURE.
ºr
EcENTLY, we have not
been out of town,
and therefore cannot
form avery accurate
opinion, but we think
the “face of Na-
ture” must be get-
ting rather, dirty,
seeing it is four
weeks since the frost
set in, and during all
that time she can't
have had it washed.
It is true there was
a thaw for some few
hours a , fortnight
since, but judging
from the filthy dirty
mess this made in
London, we cannot
think the face of
Nature can have
been much cleaned
by it. Snow has
falleninsomeplaces,
and there the face
of Nature must
undoubtedly look
white; but this is no
more a sure proof
that her face is reall
clean, than the chal
upon Clown's cheeks
is an indication that
they are so. Per-
haps the washing
that she had during
- the past year may
make Nature well dispense with any more at present, and while the
thermometer falls nightly down to zero, we cannot of course expect
that she will take her usual shower-bath.

OLD Holywell Street be called Booksellers' Row?
A very good dodge, but you'll find it no go,

For years so obnoxious to gods and to men.
Respectable parties, who're justly ashamed
To hear yourselves Holyweil denizens named,
The º way to get rid of †.
Is to pack up your stock and come out of the place.
For the doom has gone out, and the dens will go down,
Too long a vile scandal on Łondon's renown;
An Architect’s waving a potent right hand
Devoted to sweep of the pest of the Strand.
Ho! dealers in fusty and musty O Clo!
Be off with your bundles to Petticoat Row;
And }. others, a vile and unnameable crew,
The Devil must find other lodgment for you.
Proud Authors arrayed in your ranks on the stall,
The tidings are dearer to you than to all,
To free you Posterity registers vow,
From the loathsome companionship forced on you now.
Through a street where through noses men talk of old coats,
And on garbage the elderly Fº gloats,
The broad healthy stream of our traffic be rolled,
As Hercules cleansed the foul stable of old.
So, out of the dens which to parsons belong,
Yet which free-spoken Punch dare not name in a song,
Qut, all, good and bad, from the poisoned domain!
Ånd out Sid Holy Well shall be holy again.
CHARITY FOR COVENTRY.
A CHIEF cause of the distress which is suffered now at Coventry is
said to be that ladies have taken to wear hats of late in the lieu of
bonnets; and as ribands are but seldom used as trimmings for these
hats, the trade in them of course has seriously decreased. Now, no
one but a brute would dream of asking Lovely Woman to dress out of
the fashion, and while hats remain in vogue we cannot of course hope
to see young ladies buying bonnets. It is however possible to wear
ribands with a hat, as well as with a bonnet; and it would really be a
feather in any lady's cap, if instead of wearing feathers, she would
wear a bunch of ribands in it. The fashion if once set would speedily
be followed; for ladies are like sheep in the matter of their fashions,
and when once a step is taken, nearly every one will tread in it. We
are sure that pretty hats would none the less become their wearers
were they trimmed with pretty ribands, bought to help a poor distressed
half-starving fellow-creature; and we have quite sufficient faith in the
good sense as well as the good nature of our ladies to believe that when
their friend Punch gives them a kind hint to do a kindly deed they
will lose no time in setting to and doing it. Let them flock in crowds
then to their dressmakers and drapers, and lay out their spare pin-
money in purchasing new hat-ribands, Nay, if need be, let them ask
their husbands, or their fathers, or whoever else supplies them with
that necessary article, for an extra five pound note or two to spend
upon such finery, for finery and charity in this case are synonymous.
Although we hate extravagance, especially in dress, we should not in
this instance be the least disposed to grumble at it; and we really
think that anybody would deservedly be called º old curmudgeon
who would deny his wife or offspring the chance of being charitable,
by buying all the ribands she might like to set her heart upon. If she
chose indeed to wear a fresh one every day, surely no one with the
least bump of benevolence in his head would feel at all inclined to
º with her; and it would sufficiently justify her conduct were
she to explain the cause of it in some such strain as this:—
“All round my hat I wear a new riband,
All round my hat a new riband every day:
And if any one should ask of methereason why I wear it,
"Tis to help the poor of Coventry, who are wanting work, I'll say."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHRISTMAS WISITOR.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“You know everything, and you know everybody: everybody
knows that. But, Sir, among all your various acquaintances do you
know such a person as an independent critic? Doubtless, at the first
}.} you will say of course you do; and you will instance your
friend SLEDGE HAMMER and WITRioLToMAHAwk. Well, these are edu-
cated gentlemen, and no doubt are independent, as far, that is, as
men who are attached to any newspaper possibly can be. But are they
not exceptions to the literary rule, and do you not allow that really
conscientious critics apparent rari nantes in the whirlpool of the press?
Mind, I do not mean to hint that men like Sledgeham Mek and
ToMAHAwk are ever likely to be swamped in the gurgite vasto. They
have talents that well ma º: keep their heads above water, and they
will never have to struggle as their weaker brethren must. It is this
struggle for existence that leads into temptation and to sacrifice of
conscience, and oh! how hard it is bravely to withstand it.
“But the critics you have named, Punch, are literary critics, and it is
not of books but theatres that I now wish to speak. And here I
apprehend the independent critic is an even rarer bird than in the
other walk. The race may have existed, like the Dodo, I dare say;
but such strange birds are such strangers that one naturally fears they
are becoming quite extinct. I will not bore you with recounting the
many causes which have helped to extirpate the breed. Enough that
it has ceased, with few exceptions, to exist; and that you and I are
living to lament it. From what one hears too, as one may if one only
keeps one's ears open, this lamentation is by no means peculiar to us
two, but is shared by an †: large number of the public. As
far as I can judge from what is talked at clubs and dinner-tables, and
in coffee-rooms and railways, the public is beginning to have less faith
in the newspapers, so far. as their opinion on the drama is con-
cerned. Whether the public really doubts the independence of the
press in a theatrical respect, or whether, it be sickened by the rose-
water and honey with which, in lieu of criticism, it has far too long
been surfeited, I will not waste your space at F. in inquiring.
Enough to chronicle the fact of the public want of confidence in those
whose aim should be to keep it au courant with the stage, and who
should º: advise it where to go and what to see, having by
matured and conscientious criticism made the theatres they recommend
fit Places tº amuse it.
Now, this is, I conceive, a really public want; and therefore Mr.
Punch, with your polite permission, I think myself of coming forward
as an independent critic. By your leave, I will now and then, but at
no stated intervals, let your readers know what Fº I have been to
see, and whether I was pleased with them, or glad to get away from
them. I may not have the practised critical sharpsightedness which
enables its possessor by seeing half a scene to go home and write a
column on the merits of five acts; but I have a F. of tolerably clear
eyes, and with an opera-glass to help them, I believe can see as well
as most members of the public. And after all, Sir, what the public,
as it seems to me, requires is a someone who can see for it with some-
what its own vision, and whose eyes are not so vastly superior to its
own that they scorn to look at half the little points that please it.
TO OBLIGE BENSON.
SIR John Benson, of Cork, enjoys the deserved repu-
tation of being not only an excellent Architect but a Brick
in other lines. Evidently, too, he has no tee-total humbug
about him, as may be seen from the following observation
which he made at a recent meeting of the Cork Town
Council. There is a fountain on the Parade in that :
and a gentleman named Keller demanded what wo d
be the expense of gilding the letters cut round the said
fountain:—
“SIR. J. BENson did not know what the expense would be, but
there had been considerable expen-e incurred with regard to the
fountain already. He did not think there was a necessity for a railing,
as the young people would avoid the fountain when they became used to it."
Well spoken, SIR John, in the name of a hospitable city,
where the absurd habit of sticking up a bottle of whiskey
to throw stones at it is happily unknown. The young
people may occasionally take the laste taste in loiſe of the
water, just to see what the tap is, but they know better
things, and will soon learn to avoid such mean tipple.
Cork thinks, with Mr. Punch, that water was made to wash
in, and to float ships about, not to be drunk, unadulterated,
and Mr. Punch, is happy “to oblige BEnson” by pro-
mulgating to the world the excellent Knight's testimony
in favour of the good sense of his fellow-citizens.
A FRIENDLY CRITIC (an eartremely rare specimen). One
who helps you over the Style.
“The Arctic weather we have had has not been very tempting to
theatrical excursions. However ‘thoroughly well warmed', a house is
advertised to be, it can hardly be so cosy as one's own old house at
home; and however anxious the children are to go to it, Paterſamilias
wisely thinks the pantomime will keep until the temperature changes,
and one may make the trip without the risk of being frost-bitten.
Being of this opinion I have not yet seen a hot poker, except in my
own grate: nor, save my hopeful son and heir, has any person in my
presence tried to stuff himself with sausages, or to make an acrobatic
plaything of the baby. Of the pantomimes 'I therefore cannot speak
at present, because I have not seen them: it is not every critic who
would feel this a deterrent. Before Christmas I enjoyed an hour or two
with Rºy Blas such as I had not passed in a playhouse for many a long
day. The expressive eye and gesture, the well-selected attitudes
natural though full of art (instance, where he stands with his swor
like to a headsman, at the words, “I was your ºi behold in me
your executioner!') the clear articulation, never mumbling nor mouth:
ing as too many actors do; the graceſul ease of carriage, and above all
things the freshness and unstagy quiet ſervour which he threw into the
art, will remain with me, I hope, for long agreeable memories, . Nor
ave I less pleasure in remembering Handy Andy, and his well-inten:
tioned clumsinesses. Like that of Rºy Blas, this also was a piece of
genuine good acting. There was nothing forced or strained in it, to
make a mock effect and win a º clap. The humour was through-
out quiet and subdued, as true humour ought to be; and was never
violently thrust into one's face, as though demanding of one."your
laughter or your life.” . A stage Irishman in general is Hibernior
Hibernis, and much too far from nature to make one naturally º:
But such is not the Handy Andy as º; by MR. DREw: and if
people like good acting, MR. DREw should draw.
“I remain, Mr. Punch, under fear or favour of no newspaper or
manager, one who likes to see plays comfortably, and therefore
"PAYS HIS MONEY.”
The Sympathy of Holiness.
On New Year's Day the Pope received the French officers, and
made some remarks to them which are of no consequence. But a
letter from Rome informs us that—
“His Holiness also said that in defending Gaëta, the French fleet serves a just
and holy cause.”
The Pope's Holiness has heretofore always been regarded as some-
thing peculiar; but now by his own showing it is of pretty much the
same nature as the Holiness of the Bourbon dynasty of Naples. All
right!, The Holiness of the Inquisition does well to own its identity
with the Holiness of the torture-chamber.
LIFE IN THE BUSH.
THE Mistletoe for me! Grateful Erclamation of Mr. Punch, with
the Christmas fever upon him, after having been exposed for several
howrs to the fire of the “Volunteer Movement.” (Wide Almanack, 1861,

SAVAGES ON SKATES.
O cut a figure on the ice
is frequently the aim o
skaters, but there are some
of them who are not quite
sufficiently regardful what
sort of a figure it is that
they cut. hen a man
sprawls on his back while
doing the spread eagle, the
figure that he cuts is much
more ludicrous than grace-
ful; nor does it much im-
prove the elegance of his
position if a lot of flounder-
ing sliders fall between his
legs.
§at a far more ugly figure
was cut the other day by
some skaters on the Ser-
ntine and other waters
in our Parks, of whose per-
formances, the Times gives
the following account:-
“A great number of persons,
including several ies, were
tripped up by the skaters, and
severely injured. * * Many
rsons were thrown down and
very seriously hurt by skaters who were making what is called an "Express train,'
following º other as fast as they could go, and apparently without caring whom
they might upset. *...* Two brothers, named Nºvillº, of Knightsbridge Green,
were tripped up by the skaters. One had his thigh broken; the other, was so
seriously cut and otherwise injured that, after having his wounds dressed at the
Receiving House, he became delirious. The other boy was removed to St. George's
Hospital" - * * A lad named C. MARTIN, of 6, Park Street, Dorset Square, was
j treated by a fellow, who, while skating, gave him a blow on the mouth and
knocked several of his teeth out. Search was made for the man who inflicted the
injuries upon the sufferer, but he could not be found.”
Skating must soon cease to be called a manly sport, if such outrages
as these are to be looked for from its votaries. To knock down little
boys and ladies is a cruel recreation, and as cowardly as cruel. If such
injuries were perpetrated elsewhere than on the ice they would be
treated as police cases, and be reported in the newspapers as “brutal
assaults.” If it become the fashion to cut heads upon the ice instead
of cutting figures, we think that the police should be empowered to
interfere and to take up the offenders who knock the helpless down.
There is a Cruelty Prevention, Society, we know, for protecting our
dumb animals from savage and inhuman usage; and a similar Society
must in winter time be officered to protect our wives and children, and
other not dumb creatures, from the savages on skates who take pleasure
in assaulting them.
ENGLISH MURDERED BY THE FRENCEI.
The French clubs have imported into their festive Cercles our odious
word “blackball.”. They have made, so says the Globe, a verb of it,
“Blackballer.” We would give something if we could hear a pur sang
Parisian pronounce it. e are curious to know what broken, and
clipped, and disſigured form it would assume when recoined by his
lips. Should we he able to recognise it as the same word? Fancy a
thoroughbred dandy leaning over the balcony of the café Anglais, and
saying to a French copy of an English swell, “Oui, j'irai au club dans
mon tilbury, et sacré SNoB, je le blackballerai—oui, aussi sãr que JAck
Robinson, il sera blackballé.” We do not think it would have a
retty effect—would it Mons. JULes JANIN, or Mons. Théophile
AUTIER, or any other scholastic Frenchman, who prides himself
upon speaking pure French f—it would not sound very euphoniously,
we say, to hear one of the young heroes of the Boulevards exclaiming,
“Now, il est tellement Snob, il faut ... qué je le., black-
ballásse/* What with Frenchified-English and Englishified-French,
the two countries in a short time won't be able to understand each
other a bit. Why not make an :*: of languages, before they
both become so corrupt that there will be no recognising either the
one or the other?

GLADSTONE'S PET.
We do not wish to alarm. the ladies, but we have been told, by one
f|who has admission into all the secrets of the Cabinet, that it is the
intention of the CHANGELLOR or THE Excheques, next Session, to
propose a new tax, which is expected to give universal satisfaction—to
the gentlemen, at least. There are, also, great expectations that the
tax in question will be (barring the Income-Tax) one of the most pro-
ductive out of the thousand-and-one taxes that help to swell the
British Revenue up to its present colossal amount. Calculations have
been made, and the returns, it is said, will be so enormous that hopes
are entertained the CHANGELLOR OF THE Excheques, will be able to
. not only with the Paper-Duty, but several other duties
810ies,
A new tax is always looked upon as a fresh imposition, and yet we
have but little doubt that the #. one will be hailed as a great
boon by every one excepting the ladies, though it has been specially
instituted for their physical benefit and personal improvement. Not
to keep our female subscribers any longer in suspense, we may as well
tell them at once that this additional feather on MR. BULL's back, or
rather MRs. BuLL's back (though ladies do not generally Fº feathers
on their backs), is to be in the shape of a CRINoLINE-TAx! There,
the awful secret is out; and we fancy we see thousands upon thousands
of silk, moiré antique, and cotton skirts at the present moment quaking
violently from fear over this announcement. The sum put down (on
aper, we mean) as the probable return of this new contribution to the
Öxchequer is not less than £3,000,000. Every lady is to pay a Pound
licence annually for the privilege of wearing Crinoline; and if found
walking in one, without her certificate about her, she will be liable,
to an information precisely the same as a sportsman who cannot
produce his shooting licence.
The penalties are to be very severe. Servants and housemaids are
to be let off for five shillings. Frenchwomen and foreigners are to be
charged double, inasmuch as they areF. greater sinners in this
respect than even English ladies; and, besides, they were the first to
introduce the contagion into this country.
MR. GLADston E is in high glee over his pet notion, which he is sure
—unless female influence is brought to bear very strongly against it—
of passing through the House, without a single dissentient voice. If
passed, it may possibly have the good effect of inducing the ladies to
contract a little their present extravagant habits.
FEWERS UPON WHEELS.
ReADER, are you afraid of fever, and do you ride in cabs?
If you answer both these points in the affirmative, it is as well that
you should know that fever patients have at times been put into these
vehicles, and the chances of infection have thereby been produced. It
is as well that you should know too, not to frighten you too much, that
steps are º; taken at several of the hospitals to put a stop to this
alarming and disagreeable practice; and it may ſº tend to lessen
the qualms and apprehensions we may perhaps have raised, if we tell
you that the surgeons to the London Fever Hospital have given, their
advice to have a carriage fund got up, by which it will be feasible to
have fevers moved about in specially kept vehicles, instead of being
placed in any cab that comes to hand. Of course this cannot be done
without considerable expense; for with all our social science we have
not yet acquired the art of keeping carriages for nothing. So, reader
should it ease your mind to learn that #. are being started
for i. safety, in common with that of other healthy members of the
public, we think that the intelligence should ease your pocket too, for
if you share the benefit you ought to share the cost of it. A hint ſrom
Punch of course will be sufficient on this head, and will set the hand
of every apprehensive reader º at his purse-strings, every tug
whereat will lessen his chances of infection when he takes a cab. Give
your orders, gentlemen (Post Office orders we now mean) to the trea-
surer of the Carriage Fund, London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road,
N.; by whom bequests and cheques and any odd sums won at cards,
or any other conscience moneys, will be thankfully received.

sNARING PEASANTs.
The Game Laws give occasion to some prett
one for instance that was played the other day
{}. games. Here is
at Cirencester:—
fore the Magistrates
“At the Cirencester Petty Sessions, on Monday—the Magistrates Fº being
the Rev. HENRY CRIPPs (Chairman), and Mrs.Rs. CRIPPs, MoRRIs, and HARTLAND–
Thomas Hall, a simple-looking countryman, who appeared bordering on starvation,
and whose clothes hung about him in was brought up in custody, charged
with being out in pursuit of game in the preserves of EARL BATHURST.
“The information was laid by KING, head gamekeeper to Lord BATHURST, and
he called a witness who deposed that he met the prisoner at twelve o'clock at night,
and went with him through the woods in search of pheasants, saw him shoot at a
bird which was roosting in a tree; he struck it, but did not kill it; he had several
shots at it, but with the same result.
“Prisoner, on being called on for his defence, said he was in bed in his own
cottage on the night in question; that the last witness came and knocked him up,
and asked him to go with him and shoot a pheasant, adding that he was very “hard
up," and that he had shot a hare the evening before, and sold it for 2s. 6d. in Ciren-
cester, and if prisoner would come and shoot him; a pheasant he should be very
glad. Witness was a stranger to him, and he had never seen him before. He
(prisoner) had no gun: but the witness produced a gun, and loaded it, and as they
were going along the witness pointed to a pheasant in one of the trees, and asked
him to shoot it. He shot, but did not hit it, and the witness loaded the gun three
or four times for him (prisoner) to fire, but he killed nothing. He should not have
thought of going out, if the witness had not called him up, and brought the gun
and loaded it for him.
“The Chairman said the Bench considered the case, proved. The prisoner
admitted that he shot at the pheasants. He had been convicted for poaching in
1858; and the sentence now was that he be committed to prison for three months,
and, at the expiration of that time, find sureties for his good behaviour for a further
period of six months.” -
A very proper sentence, some readers may remark. But wait, a bit:
another charge was brought against the prisoner, and proved by the
same witness, who alone had given evidence, and supported the first
charge. Being questioned, this deponent confessed ; he was paid
by the head keeper of LoBD BATHURST to tempt and trap the prisoner
to commit the crime. , Whereupon an honest lawyer (such creatures.
are still extant) named—

“The º minister had also a narrow escape, for
as he was lyin

visit of around shot, which smashed the washing-stand
opposite.”
Don PUNCH has no knowledge of the lavatory
habits of this particular Spaniard; but from a
general acquaintance with the customs of the
nation to which the Minister belongs, Don
Punch may venture to congratulate him on the
damage in question having occurred to the yery
article whose loss would occasion him the least
inconvenience. If it had been the mirror, or the
pot of black stuff for anointing the hair and
moustaches, Don Punch's sympathy should
have been as freely proffered as his congratula-

“Ma. BooDLE then formally applied for an information against the witness.
“After what had passed, the magistrates refused to convict in the second case,
and so great was the excitement against the witness by the tarties in court; that he
had to be taken under the protection of the police, and let out through a side
ceful proceedings in his
door.
Ma. Boodle said he had never witnessed such º
whole life, and he pledged himself to bring the case under the notice of the Secre-
tary of State, with a view to obtain the prisoner's liberation;
ºf The proceedings caused intense excitement, and MR. BooDºº's remarks were
received with bursts of cheering, which it was impossible to repress.".
“Bravo, BooDLEl" doubtless was among the cries in Court, and
one which Mr. Punch feels strongly urged to echo. And Mr. Jºnº.
although a sportsman, and therefore no friend to poachers, would wish
his strongest influence to back up MR. BooDLE in his attempt to get
the sentence on the prisoner reversed. . Albeit perhaps no crime in the
eyesight of the law, smaring peasants is a greater in the eyes of Mr.
unch than even snaring pheasants; and could lord BATIlyasi's
precious keeper and his still more precious witness be sentenced, each
io twice the punishment inflicted on their victim, no one would,b
better pleased than Mr. Punch, or feel more inclined to testify that it
served them jolly right.

SENTIMENT IN THE SHERIFF'S COURT.
At the Sheriff's Court, Red Lion Square, MR. MoUN-
TAIN, who appears, to have, succeeded, our old friend
HEMP, having made a number of proclamations of out-
lawry at the suit of gentlemen whose names were, as usual,
chiefly Semitic; according to the Law Report:-
“The Court was closed with the usual formalities until St. Valen-
tine's Day."
The fact that the Sheriff's Court opens, on Valentine's
Day is one of those things which have hitherto been not
generally known. . Now that it is made known universall
by its publication in these pages, the Sheriff's Court *
acquire a sentimental interest in the eyes of many who
were always accustomed to regard it with unmitigated
disgust. suit in the Sheriff's Court has usually sug-
gested the idea of a beggarly action on a dishonest accom-
modation bill, brought by a usurer against a scamp. On
the first day of Term in that tribunal, however, being
Valentine's Day, the suitors may be expected to consist
of gay young bachelors, and the parties sued of spinsters
to match; the suits not being suits at law but, suits at
love. Paring the skin, then, off the bones of a debtor, will
not in the Sheriff’s Court, be the order of the day which
birds devote to pairing; but happy pairs will pair of thence
like the sparrows in the neighbouring grove of Red Lion
Square. -
Billing will take the place of those transactions which
arise out of bill-discounting; billets will come before the
Court instead of bills; and the dove or pigeon, instead
of screaming in the talons of the pecuniary kite, will coo
for a mate. Hearts will be transfixed by the arrows of
little Cupid instead of being sliced by little Shylocks; and
we have authority for stating that the authorities of the
Sheriff's Court, namely, of course, the Sheriffs, intend to
put Mr. Mountain and all the bumbailiffs on Valentine's
Day into pink fleshings, and lend their shoulders wings
for the day; the gauze wings which are proper, to the little
Loves, and properties which will readily be lent by MR.
NATHAN, of Titchbourne Street. -
The Sheriff's Court does not try breach of promise cases,
which are the only actions whereof cognisance.ought to
be taken by a Court which opens on Valentine's day.

he begs to say that with all the errors of the Scarlet Lady,

CHAPEL, BRYANSTON SQUARE.
“The Rev. C. H. Spungeon preached at this Chapel on Wednesday
morning to an audience occupying every portion of the edifice. His
object was to collect money for the building fund of the Metropolitan
Tabernacle."
We need not trouble our readers with the details of his
sermon, but will merely say that he preached the red-hottest
of doctrines.
“MR Spurgeon then spoke of the great effects of the revival, and
said that at least 500 out of his 1,600 members were a few rs ago
traviatas (he used an uglier word), drunkards, &c. MR. Spºngeos
then alluded to his tabernacle, and said the cºst of it was £30,000.
towards which he had received £26,000, leaving £4,000 to be raised
by 31st March next: how he did not know, but, &c. &c."
Suppose he tries Hush-Money. A good many people
might like to stand a trifle towards his hideous new taber-
nacle, rather than be labelled in this manner. Decidedly
the priests, of Rome behave more like gentlemen and
Christians than the anything but particular Baptists.
Birds of a Feather.
THE Manchester Guardian, as a proof of the severity
of the late weather, relates the capture of a finejack-snipe
“in the very heart of Manchester;” within the warehouse
of Messrs. BANNERMAN & Sons, York Street. Most people
would take care to eat every snipe they could get; but our
Manchester contemporary says that the captor of this one,
instead of appropriating it to stuff himself withal, intends
to have it stuffed, “in order to commemorate the fact of
the intense frost.” He will then perhaps make a present o
it to some society; and as the snipe that settled in a Man-
chester warehouse, must be an oddity in its way, he may
robably be disposed to tender this strange bird to the
dd Fellows of the Manchester Unity.
PUBLICANS AND SINNERS.
At first thought, the connection, between sewerage, and beer will
doubtless be regarded as anything but obvious; and the reader may
be puzzled by learning from the Times that the Commissioners of
Sewers held a meeting the other day, whereat, after other business had
been brought before them, DR. Lethbby introduced his º
report, containing information of much interest, to the public, an
among it the following, relating to the “publics:”—
“In some cases of adulteration the practice of it has a far more extensive relation
to the affairs of the community than at first sight appears. To take the sophistica-
tion of beer and porter as an instance, it is well known that the publicans, almost
without exception, reduce their liquors with water after they are received from the
brewer. The proportion in which this is added to the beer at the better class of
houses is nine gallons Fºr puncheon, and in second-rate establishments the quan-
tity of water is doubled. This must be compensated for by the addition of ingre-
dients which give the appearance of strength, and a mixture is º: sold for the
purpose. The composition of it varies in different cases; for each expert has his
own particular nostrum. The chief ingredients, however, are a saccharine body, as
foots and liquorice to sweeten it; a bitter principle, as gentian, quassia, sumach,
and terra japonica, to give astringency; a thickening material, as linseed, to give
body: a colouring matter, as burnt sugar, to darken it; cocculus indicus, to give a
false strength; and common salt, capsicum, copperas, and Dantzic §. to pro-
duce a head, as well as to impart certain refinements of flavour. In the case of ale,
its apparent strength is restored with bitters and sugar-candy."
This somewhat explains the *::: we began with. When we find
that beer is doctored with such beastliness, we can scarcely feel sur-
prised at its being viewed as something to be brought before the nose
of the Commissioners of Sewers. A mixture of quassia, sumach, lin-
seed, capsicum, copperas, and cocculus indicus, is much more fit to
flow down drains than down the human throat, and far more deserves
the name of sewerage than stimulant.
With such evidence as DR. LETHERY brings before us, we seem to
understand a bit of slang one hears where cabmen mostly congregate,
and apostrophise their chums with, “Now then, BILL, let’s ’ave a
Drain l’” It is .# enough to make one turn teetotaller when one
hears what noxious stuff is sold to one as beer, and how the publicans
conspire to make a cesspool of one's stomach. Surely converts to the
water faith might easily be gained by any lecturer who chose to travel
through the country, and to illustrate lecture with some water-
º: drawings showing the horrors that are drinkable in a drop of
r.
But besides injuring, one's person, as capsicum and copperas cer.
tainly must do, it is easily made clear that they must hurt one's pocket,
unless indeed one lives without having to pay taxes, which few readers
of Punch, we fear, are so favoured as to do. Says DR. Letheby on this
point:—
“Apart from the question of how much injury is done to the health of the con-
sumer by this practice, or how large is the fraud on the ket of the purchaser, it
is a matter of interest to know what is the effect of it on the revenue. There
are, I believe, about 6,200 publicans and beer retailers in this metropolis. Supposing
that each, on an average, has a sale for only six barrels of beer and porter per week,
and that the degree of dilution is but to the extent of five gallons of water per barrel,
in the gate there would have been used 186,000 gallons of water per week.
This, if properly and honestly brewed into beer, would have required it. 1,722
uarters of malt; and as each quarter of malt pays a duty of 22s. 6d. to the revenue,
there is a fraud of rather more than £1,937 sterling per week, or nearly £100,800
per annum."
So, besides swindling their customers and half-poisoning them to
boot, by giving them bad doctor's stuff when they ask for beer, the
adulterating publicans cheat the F. into paying above £100,000 per
annum more taxes than they ought to pay. ell, now we know that
selling beer is such a fraudulent transaction, we shall abstain as much
as possible from giving it encouragement. We have no wish to assist
the trade of inland smuggling in which so many of our innkeepers, it
seems, are now engaged; and as we don't want to commit suicide, we
shall rigidly observe a total abstinence from beer, excepting when we
get it from the brewery direct.

order to imply a stan-
dard of good shooting
with the rifle. -
“H. R. H. has just
published, very pro-
perly, an account of
the shooting which our
soldiershaveperformed
during the past year,
and has shown the re-
spective merit of each
regiment. I am not
going to say who are at
the top of the class,
and who are at the
bottom, but I do want
to ask a question.
“I perceive no men-
tion of any of our
regular Riflemen (I
mean the old dark
green boys who were
supposed to be such wonderful shots, and who have been practising all the days of their

mark; and ever so far down again I see another.
*Please, Sir, how is this?
Were the old Rifles a sham, or have the officers neglected
their duties, or is the new system of teaching so good that in a short time twenty-eight
regiments can learn to , shoot better than, a
twenty-ninth, which has been shooting at marks
all its life?

our national amusements, but something, like a taste for cruelty j
lingers in our mobs, as the following description of a night-scene on
the Serpentine last week will amply testify:—
“The scene was altogether of a most exciting character. An immense number
of serpents were ignited and thrown upon the banks among the public, and as they
exploded and the sparks flew about, especially among the women, the scene became
fearful, and upwards of twenty women were more or less burnt. The sham fight
was carried on, one party firing from the north shore, another from the south ; but,
eventually, both parties commenced the medley attack, and fireworks were thrown
indiscriminately about, and many persons were injured. A woman named PHOEBE
HoPE had her clothes set on fire, and she was so badly injured that she was taken
to her residence in Carlton Street, Wauxhall.”
Of course people may say, what business have women to go out after
dark, and mix in a night-mob of chimney-sweeps and costermongers'
But were chimney-sweeps and costermongers the only roughs, there
present? Did not gents and counter-jumpers play a part too in the
farce, which we fancy must have nearly been turned into a tragedy ?
Were there mone of the so-reckoned “educated classes” who let off
squibs and roman candles without looking who were near them, or if
they looked, º: picked out a place for the discharge where Crino-
line did mostly congregate?. Of course their plea would be, that they
did it “for a lark,” and had no intention to injure an body. But is
this plea, do you think, a reasonable excuse for frightening women
into fits, and burning upwards of a score of them? And if persons
don’t know better how they should conduct themselves when there are
women present, don't you think it reasonable that they ought to be
taught, albeit they belong to the “educated classes”?
The Ribbon Conspiracy.
We never like to be rude to good folk, but just now we should feel
inclined to send all charitable souls to Coventry; and although a firm
friend of “peace, law, and order,” we should not object to see Rib-
bonism in the ascendency in England. Hats off, Ladies, and bonnets
to the rescue !

FROST AND THAW.
It was hard KING FRosT and soft QUEEN THAw,
Came º to a tussle, - - -
Where the King he prevailed, with his hands ice-mailed,
And his iron strength of muscle.
And with scornful mien, he bespake the Queen,
Who strove to invade his dominions,
With her languid sighs, and her weeping eyes,
And her soft and drooping pinions—
Quoth he, “Begone to the snivelling South,
Where the mist hangs hot and heavy:
There bid parched air from steaming earth
Its toll of moisture #. -
Go, slacken the hold of the slight Spring-cold,
And melt the April rime,
But leave to me ... Januarie,
And the bitter New Year time.
“I crack the tire, I rive the rail,
I mock the might of iron,
Make brittle the bone, and shatter the stone,
And the mountains with ice environ.
A touch—the mattock and spade are still,
The trowel and hod go down-. . .
The board is bare and the hearth is chill,
And hunger holds the town.
“And is it thou, poor puling Queen,
Woulds’t tame a might like mine?
Woulds’t lift the brand of º; scathing hand,
And loose where I confine
Go, do thy worst—bid the rivers burst
My fetters, an if they may, -
Bid earth rejoice, give the birds a voice,
And make men's spirits gay.”
Then soft QUEEN THAw to her side 'gan draw,
Her gracious ministile;
She summoned the warm airs from the South,
The soft rains from the sea.
And sore she stroye by the might of love,
KING FRost's hard rule to quell,
But the airs in her train came shivering again,
And her rains they froze as they ſell!
Then sudden this thought to her heart was brought,
“Fool, to waste sun and shower—
'Tis not. KING FRost, whose path I've crost,
But Nature's guiding power .
Beneath His law stand Frost and Thaw;
We work but as He wills;
KING FRost's keen knife clears way for life,
When he makes boast it kills.
“In earth and air I'll strife forbear:
Leave them to Nature's law,
But Frost shall see, though strong he be,
There’s a triumph still for Thaw.
On human hearts I'll turn º arts,
Love's fount therein unseaſ,
Till the hard shall give, and the dead shall live,
And the slow to pity feel.”

REAL CONSCIENCE MONEY.
MR. Punch begs to express the extreme pleasure with which he:
reads every day the lists of charitable donations which the hard season
has set flowing into the poor-boxes and other treasuries of benevolence.
He begs to assure the kind-hearted world, that he carefully peruses
every item in every one of the lists, and not a name escapes him, from
that of the Countess who sends her £25 to that of the Little Śchool
Girl, who sends her Shilling for the poor...And he also notes all the
Fancy. Signatures, blows a kiss to “Pet,” “Rosebud,” “Little Maria,”
and ºil the rest of the charitable fairies, and shakes hands with “Crib,”
"Blobbs,” “Two Uglies,” and all the other good fellows who give
their money and not their names.
But it rs to him that there is an absence of what is rather
foolishly called “Conscience, Money.” He does not mean that the
hypocrites oridiots who stealthily inclose bank-notes to MR.GLADstons
could be expected to remit money for any sensible or laudable object.
They merely try to Fº up holes in their old tin-kettle consciences,
and, having cheated other people, are now endeavouring to cheat
themselves; but there must be a great many small offences committed
about this time, and if people would only fine themselves (or, which is
leasanter, fine others) for these things, and send the fines to the
agistrates, a very large addition would be made to the collection for
the wretched.

NOTICES FOR THE COMING SESSION.
The following Notices have been given for the approaching Session
of Parliament:— -
MR. Roxbuck.--To ask MR. GILPIN whether he is a descendant of
John Gilpin, and otherwise to insinuate to the remarkable Minister,
that when humble people are suddenly elevated to the backs of herses,
they are very likely to ride in an objectionable direction.
MR. Edwin JAMEs.--To move an Address to the Crown for leave to
him to wear his Blouse and Pistols (as delineated in the Illustrated
London Neurs) the first time he moves the Address in the House of
Commons.
MR. W. WILLIAMs.--To move an Address to the Crown ſor leave
to him, when he receives his coronet of Wiscount, to have the same
electroplated, as more in accordance, with the economical principles
of the day than gold or silver-gilt. Also to ask the Crown when it is
likely the Hon. Member will have the said distinction.
Colonel North–To move that Mr. SPEAKER be instructed to
issue his warrant to the Serjeant-at-Arms to arrest any Member who,
not holding a commission in the Army, shall presume to speak or ask a
question upon any military subject whatsoever.
Sir FRÄncis BARING.--To ask Wiscount PALMERsron the reason
why he, SIR FRANÇis, is not a member of the present Ministry, and to
assure the noble Wiscount that the nation can have no confidence in
teCabinet which has not the official co-operation of the honourable
ronet.
MR. BRIGHT-To move that the Warrior be immediately completed,
and presented by the House of Commons to the EMPERon or this
FREnch as an assurance of the belief of England that his Majesty will
never do any harm with that vessel or any other.
Civil.
SIR FRANCIs BARING thinks that a very small measure of Reform
will do, and that he ought to come into the Cabinet. Mr. Punch is a
moderate reformer, but does not think that the country will be satisfied
with so very small an improvement as that. -

posal, and lynch the proposer.
That Slavery, is the most humane Institution in the world; for, inas-
much as half the sorrows of white persons arise from the sorrows
of their husbands, wives, or children in forbidding a race to have
any husbands, wives, or children to call their own, we deprive
that race of one-half the suffering we undergo.
That England has no right to say a word in the matter, while in
Ireland there is a Protestant Church, and all persons are hanged
who do not attend it; while Welsh is strictly forbidden to be used
in the Debates of the English Parliament; while Scotchmen are
forbidden to keep Unicorns; and while, close to London itself
she keeps the natives of a wretched, island in such a state o
demoralisation and misery that it is called the Isle of Dogs.
That having thus º: from, Scripture, from philosophy, from phil-
anthropy, and from ethnology, that Slavery is the noblest Insti-
tution in existence, and that patriotism and self-respect alike
forbid us to bring it into jeopardy,
We hereby declare—
That we shall have great pleasure in handing 50,000 dollars
to any one who will bring us the head of one ABRAHAM
LINcoLN, and with still greater pleasure will we hand
100,000 dollars to any one who will deliver us the said
ABRAHAM LIN coln alive.

Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, the Piedmontese
managed to keep up a good fire for KING FRANCIs at Gaëta. In fact,
so intense was the fire, that on more occasions than one the place was
almost too hot to hold him. After the 19th, it is expected Wigton
r MMANUEL's º: will subscribe together to give the “Last of the
BouhBons” a little bit more fire. Such liberality, when the cold has
been severe enough almost to freeze the milk of human kindness in
every one's breast, cannot be too highly applauded.

This story reminds us of the Hanoverian Rats, as the

LEGAL SWEATERS.
To find low charges in the law is so uncommon an occurrence that
"when ſound” we really think we ought to “make a note” of them.
The note we make, however, is not one of admiration: and if it par-
take rather of the nature of a query, it is because we hold the matter
#. º questionable, although about its evil tendency we have very little
oubt.
A custom has obtained of late among law stationers and printers of
sending circulars to the profession by whom they are employed, statin
at what prices work will be received by them and punctually executed.
The custom has obtained doubtless with the object of obtaining cus-
tom, and every stationer pretends to cut out his compeers in the celerity
and care with which the work he gets is done, and in the exceeding
cheapness of his charges for it. , Now, competition is a benefit, econo.
mists agree; but when carried to extremes there is far more harm
than good in it. The sweating system, as pursued by advertising
tailors, produces many far from satisfactory results: and the same
system, transplanted from the º to the desk, can hardly be
inseparable from the like effects. hen, we read of Messrs. GRIND.
EMDown charging only eighteenpence for every score of folios they

the other half a crown, we cannot help considering what manner of
clerk it is that Messrs. GRIN DEMDown employs, and what resemblance
he must bear to the starving needle-drivers whom the sweating tailors
gradually wear out. But Messrs. GRIN DEMDown, we find from the
Circular before us (and, nomine mutato, we doubt not there are many
GRIN DEMDowns in town) offer still more tempting terms to lawyers
who have work to give, and who wish to get, their writing done as
cheaply as they can, although they may not charge their clients one
halfpenny less dearly for it. For engrossing deeds and wills and other
instruments on paper, MEssRs. GRIN DEMDown will charge but two
shillings for every twenty folios entrusted to them, three and four-
pence being the ordinary price; moreover in this case, and in the
others we have cited, Messrs. GRINDEMDown inform us that they
make no charge for paper, of which they kindly make a present to
the person who employs them, however unprofessional it may be so
0.
Add to this that MessRs. GRINDEMDown guarantee attendance
gratis at the stamp office, and therefore like some envelope makers,
make no charge for stamping; that for the money they disburse
there they allow you a month's credit, except for stamps of large
amount; and that as, a climax to their wondrous *::::::::: on all

But stop a bit. Before you try to unveil them from our alias and
hand them in your briefs, consider for a moment the question we have
put, and think what manner of man it is that Messks. GRIN DEMDown
employ, to do the cheap and n-not nice work of which they are in
quest. Out of the prices they have named their profits have to come,
and how much of the residue is left for the machines—can you think
they look like men?—who drive the weary pen for them? Even in an
arm-chair, and by the side of a good fire, it is not pleasant, we know,
to have to write much this cold weather; but how much do you think
the slaves of MEssRs. GRINDEMDown, the law-sweaters, must write, in
order to earn enough to keep themselves from starving?
A BIT OF WEST-INDIA PICKLE.
TRINIDAD is a very meritorious island, and its productions, such as
sugar, ladies, cocoa, and other delicacies, are in deserved repute. But
Mr. Punch is sorry to see by the last mail, that however refined may be
the saccharine products of Trinidad, its language is by no means of the
same graceful character. The last message from the island appeared
in Saturday's Times, and ran thus:–
“The ATToRNEY-GENERAL's bill for consolidating cur run ordinances was read a
first time."
“Our rum ordinances” is not a phrase by which a journalist should
indicate the laws of his island, however much he may deprecate the
edicts in question. “Our singular legislation,” or “our incongruous
statutes,” or “our eccentric decrees” would have been worthier of a
gelicate, writer. We are very happy to admit the word Rum from
Trinidad as a Noun, and also to admit into our cellar as much of the
celebrated article itself as we can; but we decline to admit Rum as an
Adjective, and West Indian friends at a distance will please accept all
these notifications.

THE NEW LADY GODIWA,
FOREIGN TRAPS FOR ENGLISH FLATS.
Fools and flats read the newspapers as well as other people. Else we should not see so
often such advertisements as this:-
A Large ForTUNE may be realised for ONE POUND only—For particulars apply to
Mr. , Banker, of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, or letters addressed to him, London.
Now, every one except the fools, and flats aforesaid, knows, well enough what sort of
trap this lure is meant to bait. But because only the fools and flats are likely, to be º
by it, we do not think we ought to tolerate its presence in our press., Lotteries are for-
bidden by the English law, and the law, to be consistent, should put a stop to the announce-
ment of them. Until this be done, however, we hold the editors of newspapers responsible
for all the gambling that ensues, in consequence of the advertisements to fools which they
admit. We have as a rule, we own, small º with our flats; but we must say that
we hate to see them duped by foreign knaves, and losing their good English money in bad
continental company. º: is in the penny newspapers that the traps are mostly set; and as
perhaps with the proprietors of the penny press the argumentum ad pocketºn is the most
werful to use, we would hint that every sovereign which in quest of a "large fortune”

any wish to swell their circulation they will not cede insertion to the snares of foreign
A CHANCE FOR A NEW GODIVA.
WHO has not read the idyll sweet
Of our own ALFRED TENNrson,
How fair GoDiva, ages since,
Earned Coventry's best benison:
When to repeal stern Godwin's tax
Imposed upon the borough,
Unclothed, save with her chastity,
She rode the city thorough?
The Poet tells us how the c
Of starving babes and mothers
Struck deep in that sweet lady's heart,
Wherein all men were brothers.
How the grim Earl, among his dogs,
Received her soft petition,
And little deemed Godiva's ruth
Would brook his hard condition.
Who calls not up, the while he reads,
That picture, bright and tender–
Those rippled ringlets to the knee
Showered in their golden splendour—
The naked loveliness that steals
From pillar unto pillar—
The silence of those empty streets
That her steed's tread makes stiller f
Again the plaint of hungry babe,
The wail of desp'rate mother,
The awful cry of agony
Not e'en strong men can smother,
More loudly sound in Coventry
Than in that olden day,
When grim EARL Godwin laid the tax
His good dame took away!
A grimmer Lord than Godwin lays
is hard hand on the town:
A heavier weight than Godwin's tax,
Presses the people down.
Gaunt, Hunger lords it o'er the place
With Plague, his henchman true;
The looms are still-shut up the mill-
There is no work to do!
Oh, where is the GoDiva now
This grim Lord to assuage?
Needs not that she ride naked
As in the ruder age.
Needs not with rippled ringlets' veil,
Her snowy limbs she hide;
With ribbons decked from head to heel,
Behoves her but to ride.
So saying to our English dames
“Go all and do like me,
To set the idle loom to work,
The silent shuttle free.
E’en as of old GoDivA rode,
Clad in her golden hair,
Ride, English ladies, gaily decked
In ribbons' rainbow-wear.
“And as GoDiva's name throughout
Our England is renowned,
So shall your names with blessing
In Coventry be crowned.
Naked she went, and not ashamed,
For ruth her heart did move;
So in your ribbons men shall read
Not vanity, but love.”

OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, -
“THE severity of the late weather, which had nearly frozen up
my energies as well as the contents of my inkstand, is past, and I take
º: of the thaw, when one's ideas seem, to flow more º to
drop you a few lines, which I will preface with a hope that you have
enjoyed your Christmas. - - - -
§. my part I always await that festive season with feelings of
pleasure not altogether unalloyed. I am not thinking now of those
provoking results of simple addition with which my bootmaker and tailor
I am not alluding to the playful eccen-
tricities of my nephew Tom (act. 7) in whose company I was condemned
to dine on the 25th of last month, who, in the exuberance of boyish
spirits, is wont to treat my hair as a practicable bell-pull, and acting on
this ingenious hypothesis proceeds to unbutton my waistcoat by way
of a street-door. I forgive, the “Waits, although they played ‘Oh,
Willie, we have missed you” under my bedroom window"to such an
awful extent during the Christmas week that I was half inclined to
wish that that erratic gentleman had deferred his return until the
morning... But apart from these private, and individual grievances, I
have another in common with most brothers and he-cousins, viz., the
duty of escorting some of my female relatives on their shopping excur-
sions. They belong, Sir, to what I call the dorematic, or present-giving
species—never forget birth-days, wedding-days, red-letter days, or any
other occasion, for indulging in their harmless propensity. Thus it
comes to pass that I have, at this moment, eleven pairs of Berlin wool
slippers which I could have ‘made up' at any time (as I am assured
by a respectable bootmaker in Oxford Street) for about five guineas
seven smoking caps innocent of the noxious weed, and lying wrapped
in silver paper in my bureau. Thirteen knives and pencil-cases at an
average value of 8s. 9d., each. Eight porte-monnaies apparently con-
structed for the deposit of fourpenny bits. Two potichomanie jars,
decorated with an elaborate pattern, the simplest element of which is
the alternate representation of a blue rose and a mandarin in convul-
sions, an embroidered waistcoat (in which I would as soon appear as in
a philibeg), and twenty-three tea-kettle holders lined with moire
antique, white satin, and other appropriate material.
“All this, however, by the way, the main drift and º of this
letter being to call your attention to the disagreeables which invariably
attend that pursuit known in the domestic world as shopping. And
observe in th. first place that I exclude from º remarks at the outset
all those supereminently swell establishments whose hereditary prestige
#. beyond the º of practising the great Touting Art.
f for instance 1 *: HERR Won STULTzMEISTER or MR. BUcks to
Adorn my...person at the rate of two guineas per limb, I am quite sure
that it will be done in the best possible manner with the least possible
trouble to myself. Then again PIVERGANT's gloves at four and nine-
pence per pair are first-rate of their kind, and the young lady who
disposes of them receives my cash with dignified composure, and allows
me to leave her odoriferous counter unmolested. But suppose with
my moderate income of say £ "" per annum I am unable to deal with
those eminent firms; suppose I am selecting a pair of gloves at a shop
in one of our great thoroughfares why am I to be told if they (the
gloves). Are too small, that they will stretch; if they are too large that
they will collapse with the eat of the 'and, or some such nonsense;
why iſ...I prefer drab am I to be informed that “green is mostly worn
nºw, Sir;’ or if I ask for green that “nothing is so genteel as drab;’
why if f complain that the kid is of indifferent quality, does Mſ.
SMIRKER, from behind the counter, say, ‘Sir?” in a deferentially im
pudent manner, and pretend that he did not hear me? Why when 1
do repeat the observation does he meet it with the remark, that it is
very extraordinary, but that it is the first complaint he has ever heard ol
them, and that so far from their being dear at three-and-six, that they
ought to be four shillings a pair; ought to be indeed, then why aren’t
they, I should like to knowſ Finally, why when he has wrapt up my
gloves, doesn't he give them, to me at once, instead of putting them
aside, and saying, ‘What will be the next article?” in a tone which
seems to imply, that if I don't lay out a pound or two .# custom is not
worth having!...I reply, “nothing else, thank you,' as politely as I can,
and he immediately inquires again, "Anything in shirts, collars
pocket-'andkerchiefs, braces, draw—?” (in short, etcetera). When f
shake my head he lifts down a great wooden tray, and taking up an
elaborate sort of running noose composed of silk and flannel informs
me that it is ‘termed' the Californian cravat, and that he (SMIRKER)
considers it a very gentlemanly thing in ties. I sternly ask him for
change, when shouting out “Cash!” (which he pronounces Kesh) he
bangs my sovereign down on the counter, partly I suppose to see if it
is a good one, and partly to impress me with an idea that he is a
º business-like man, who gets through his work before you
can say Jack Robinson. In this last respect, however, his extraor-
dinary energy defeats itself, for the money drops on the floor, and he
loses ten, minutes in looking for it. While Kesh, who is a bilious
looking little boy in a round jacket, and horribly precocious at accounts,
is gone for the change to his den (which suggests the idea of a regiment
of cricket stumps escalading a family pew), SMIRKER_thinks I had
better let him put me up the Californian cravat, but as I don't concur
in that opinion, I am allowed to depart in a great rage, while SMIRKER
keeps his temper admirably, and bows me out.
“Now, my dear Mr. Punch, I appeal to you, is not this sort of thing a
dreadful nuisance, and haven't I a right to complain of it * Why can't
I go into a shop and buy a pair of gloves without being subject to an
inquisition respecting the rest of my wardrobe. Good Heavens, can’t
a man ask for what he wants! If I were to go over to my baker's, and
invest in an Abernethy biscuit, do º suppose MRs. BAKER would say
‘Want anything in rusks, hot rolls, muffins, tops and bottoms?’ or,
‘This is a sweet thing in tea-cakes, Sir! Better let me put you up
that quartern loaf. This is what we term the Bohemian bun, &c.”
course not, and why should touting be tolerated in one case more than
another. And if MESSRs, SMIRKER AND FLAM keep a shop, why the
deuce can't they call it a shop instead of a mart or an emporium! Am I
to be dazzled by these high-sounding, titles or their gaudy shop front?
Do they think to impose upon me with their gilded cornices P Do they
suppose I cannot see through their plate glass. Oh, MDLLEs. Lucy,
LAURA, Louis A, BEATRICE, Bessie, and BLANCHE, who read these
words in these truly ‘hard times,” have a care how you “shop’ and
beware of wondrous bargains. Every good bonnet, muff, or shawl that
you buy is worth its fair price, neither more nor less, and if you find
MEssRs. SMIRKER AND FLAM underselling their neighbours, depend on it
something is wrong somewhere, either the goods are inferior or some
Qor needlewoman is underpaid. Don't believe in “Bankrupt Sales’ and
Tremendous Sacrifices.” When you see “Must be Sold this day,”
remember that the words may apply to you more than to what you see
ticketed. . As for the sacrifice, you yourself may be the innocent lamb
ready for immolation. Sacrifice, indeed! if MR, SMIRKER were really
making a sacrifice, do you suppose he would go to the expense of red
and yellow printed posters to tell you so? My dear girls, bargains are
bosh, and ‘Alarming sacrifices” a delusion and a snare. If you want
good things, go to a good shop, and pay a fair price for it.
“Such, my dear Punch, is my advice to the opposite or crinolined
sex who may be just now making, their numerous New Year's pur-
ghases. As for myself, I am not likely to make any, but if MEssRs.
SMIRKER AND FLAM should ask me ‘What will be the next article?' I
shall refer them to your number for this week. In which, I also wish
you the compliments of the season, and remain,
“Yours faithfully,

EFFECTS OF THE THAW-" POOR FROZE OUT ICEMEN.”
- Chorus. “We’ve got no Work to do-oo-oooo !"
MIRACULOUS HAIR-CUTTING.
The beard movement is making some progress in the Church, but
we doubt whether the hirsute cultivation of our clergymen is attended
with such ease and certainty of growth as appears to be attained in the
Church of the Carmine, whereof we have these details from a Naples
correspondent of the Morning Post:-
“This morning I have witnessed a very singular religious ceremony. I was
struck by the passing along the street of a huge old rumbling gilt coach, resemblin
that which Louis the ThihTEENTH had made for himself. On inquiry I learne
that it was for conveying the Gonfalouiere of Naples, with his secretaries, his sub-
stitutes, his councillors, in fact, his whole official train, to the Church of the Carmine,
there to assist at the solemn rite of cutting the hair of a celebrated crucifix in that
temple. I trust your readers will not smile with incredulity at the mention of this
fact, which recurs annually on the 26th of December in the church aforesaid. The
church contains a large crucifix, with the head inclined over the right shoulder.
and the face almost covered by clustering locks of hair. The friars of the church
and the superstitious people affirm that this hair grows every year. Woe to the
man who in the neighbourhood of the Carmine should venture to express the
slightest doubt respecting the annual growth of this miraculous scratch-wig. He
would be torn limb from limb by the fanatical and infuriated mob. The officers of
the municipality give their public sanction to this mummery by repairing in all
state to the church, attending during the proceedings, and attaching their signatures
to the minutes of the rite thus annually performed on the 26th of December. At
the moment when the hair is cut by one of the friars a signal is given outside the
church, and thousands upon thousands of crackers proclaim by their explosion this
uniracle and triumph of the faith."
Such a “cracker” as the story of hair annually sprouting from a figure
on a crucifix is fitly published by the firing of a lot of children's crackers,
whose every bang proclaims the childish nature of the bounce. How
the great Gonſaloniere contrives to keep his countenance, when he
lends it to so barefaced and impudent a trick, is more than, with our
present means of knowledge, we can guess. He must really be pos-
sessed of no common self-command to prevent, himself from laughing
at the miserable imposture; and were it not that he is backed up by
his secretaries and councillors, we question very much if he could go
through with the business. Although, by a strong effort he might
perhaps suppress all facial signs of his hilarity, we think that he must
shake so with internal cachinnation that he must find it yastly difficult
to put his signature, as stated, to the minutes of the rite; and if in
these same minutes he be required to make a note as to the number of
the moments which it took to cut the hair, we fear the humour of the
joke would completely get the better of him, and the explosion of the
* would be drowned in the explosion of his laughter at the
r10k.
But may we not suggest that while the priesthood are about it, they
might turn their so-called “miracle” to a more practical account, and
reap a still more bounteous harvest from their crop?, Why should
they not stick a barber's pole outside the church, and publicly an-
nounce that the hair cut from their crucifix was grown entirely through
the means of some miraculous manure, for which they were possessed
of the original recipe? An advertisement like this would be certain
to attract, for the promise of a head of hair to persons who are bald is
a capillary attraction, that few men could resist. We will wager were
a priest or two to walk about in front of the Church of the Carmine,
with placards stating that the hair-oil which yearly worked the miracle
might be had within, a considerable revenue would be added to their
coffers. When trade grew dull a picture, might be added to the
posters, representing j crucifix before the hair was cut from it,
exhibiting of course a most prolific crop, which, a scroll might state
beneath it, was of only one year's growth.
“Do you want LuxURIANT Love-Locks? If so, TRY OUR SAINTED
HAIR-oil,” might be a taking head-line in the Naples newspapers;
and the well-known brace of figures might be borrowed from our
prints, and parodied to puff the produce of the priests: the one picture
portraying a man with a bald head and a very rueful countenance
and the other representing him with a most splendid crop of hair, an
holding up to notice a small bottle in his hand, while from his mouth
the motto issued—“Ha! ha / Grown in a twelvemonth /*

WANTED A SPONSOR,
Lord P. “What AGAIN, Mrs. RUssell? REALLY-"
THE REALITY OF CLOUD-LAND. .
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“SoME time ago you made some observations on the deformed
skulls lately found at Wroxeter, representing them as probably being
the skulls of ogres, like CoRMoRAN, and BLUNDERBORE, and the other
monsters exterminated by JACK THE GIANT KILLER.
“You will be grieved to hear that those remarks of yours have
incurred the severe condemnation of a local genius, a MR. PEAcock, who
on account of them, has denounced you in a Guide Book to “The Wom.
derful City of Uriconium,’ as a “ º and ignorant writer,” who
has made “a gratuitous attack upon what is serious and scientific,” and
that ‘in language equally absurd and indelicate.’ You may be alive
after all his invective; but, j". read it, you will be very ill for some
time. The effect, Mr. Punch, of the squall of PEAcock will be a
squeak for you.
“Never mind. You have a mind which is conscious of being always
in the right. Allow me to call your attention to a fact which strongly
corroborates the view propounded by you that nursery romance, so
called, is real history. I allude to the coloured rain which fell at
Sienna, on the 28th of December last, and whereon M. GiovaNNI
CAMPANI has just published a letter, addressed to the celebrated PRO.
FºssoR MATTEucci. An account of the phenomenon is given in the
Times. On the day and at the place above-named, three distinct
showers of red rain fell; the first of them lººf two hours. Again
on the 31st of December, and once more on the 1st of January, it
rained a species of red ink. You are, no doubt, aware that the same
thing has often occurred before...The nature of the red stuff in the
rain varies. At Blankenburg, in 1819, it is stated to have been chloride
of cobalt. In this instance the water has been ascertained by PRO-
Fessors GABRIELLI and CAMPANI to contain no cobalt at all. It must,
however, be a, chemical, solution, of something, for, it deposits no
º which it would do if the redness consisted of animalcules
or lungi.
“Now, Sir, you know likewise that there are such things as meteoric
stones, and also that frogs and fish are credibly related to have fallen

clerks are not above availing themselves of the said pri-
vilege rather frequently during the course of the day. A
disappointed old gentleman, who has been in the habit for
the last six months of waiting on business at most of
the Government offices, and by this time, is rather tired
of his fruitless occupation, says that this habit of periodical
drinking may account for the conduct of most of the young
clerks being so extremely overbeering. It only proves
what savage things the absence of a little common civility
tion to be accused of, on the part of those whose vindic-
tiveness is all the more deeply embittered by their igno-
somewhat apt to be a little vindictive after he has been
kept waiting uselessly for half an hour. However, gentle-
men clerks of the Government offices, we ask you whether
this charge, which seems to take its bitterness from the
beer that is said to be dispensed, be true or not? Not
true, of course! We fully expected as much from gentle-
men of your recognised abilities and notoriously high
standing; and, to exonerate ourselves from any participa-
tion, in the above wicked scandal can only say that we
shall be most happy to give up the name and address of
the elderly gentleman who has furnished us with the above
information to any one, who, from the altitude of a Govern-
ment stool, applies for the same.

PUNCIT, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ASS AND HIS RIDER.
ANTED a considerable
number of spirited and
wealthy young gentle-
men as Cornets to
serve in HER MAJEs-
ty's Cavalry Regi-
ments. Each young
gentleman must either
be entitled to immense
wealth, or else be the
son of a father who
will draw a cheque for
any amount to pay for
his outfit, find }. in
chargers at from £100
each, and defray his
mess-bills and all the
other expenses which
the usages of his regi-
ment may require him
to contract.
Such is the form of
handbill which, duly
framed and glazed, it
will soon become me-
cessary to suspend in
the iš. and boxes
of the operas and thea-
tres, in the principal
--
-ºil
Fºlſº club-rooms, and all
- º other fashionable
places; and also about
the City and in the
Stock Exchange.
The fact is, that to
enter a Cavalry Regi-
ment a youth must be
either actually or pro-
Spectively and potentially a millionnaire; that is, if he means to be comfortable in his corps.
Notwithstanding the sumptuary memorandum which the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE has addressed
to Colonels of Cavalry Regiments, expense and extravagance in those corps continue to be
the order of the day. Young officers unable to keep pace in prodigality with their com-
rades are considered mean; and the regiment soon becomes, not indeed too hot, but too cold,
which is just as bad, and, at any rate, too unpleasant to hold them.
Wanted, therefore, sons of opulent usurers and other wealthy City men to accept Cornetcies
in crack Cavalry Regiments. Wanted also Cavalry Regiments, which young men will enter
principally with the view of serving their country, and not that of faring sumptuously, and
dressing magnificently, and indulging in wasteful debauchery to its honour and glory.
It is a wonder how there can be any light dragoons; for a horse worth £150 odd must
carry a load of wealth on his back: . His rider should be a heavy pecuniary swell. Intrin-
sically he may be worth less than his horse. If his purse, pride and expensive vanity are
injuring the Army in one of its chief branches, he is worth less than nothing to anybody but
himself. His Fº position would be that of officer in a regiment of neither cavalry nor
infantry—not of ſoot, but a modification of horse. Cavalry is named from equus caballus; but
the equus asinus is the animal on which the dandy dragoon would be most suitably mounted.
To coin a popularly intelligible word exactly corresponding to cavalry, would perhaps be
difficult, but the troops in question, donkey-regiments, might be conveniently named the
Mokery. ...Your dashing young spendthrifts would be just the right men in the right places,
§ : they would distinguish themselves, if the seat of every one of them were the haunch
01 a Jackass.
THE WARIATION HUMBUG.
THERE is perhaps more Humbug talked, printed, and practised in reference, to Music
than to anything else in the world, except Politics. And of all the musical humbugs
extant it occurs to Mr. Punch that the Wariation Humbug is the greatest. This party has
not eyen the sense to invent a tune for himself, but takes somebody else's, and starting
therefrom, as an acrobat leaps from a spring board, jumps himself into a musical reputation
on the strength of the other party's ideas. Mr. Punch wonders what would be thought of a
poet who should try to make himself renown by this kind of thing—taking a well-known
poem of a predecessor's and doing Wariations on it after this fashion:-
BUGGINS'S WARIATIONS ON THE BUSY BEE.
How doth the Little Busy Bee
Improve each shining hour,
And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower,
From every opening flower, flower, flower,
That sparkles in a breezy bower,
And gives its sweetness to the shower,
Exhaling scent of fº. power,
That lasts on kerchief many an hour,
And is a lady's graceful dower,
Endeared alike to cot and tower,
Round which the little Busy Bee
Improves each shining hour,
And gathers honey all the day
From every opening flower,
From every opening flower, flower, flower,
From every opening flower.
How skilfully she builds her cell,
How neat she spreads her whacks,
And labours hard to store it well,
With the sweet food she makes,
With the sweet food she makes
With the sweet food she makes, makes,
makes,
When rising just as morning breaks,
The dew-drop from the leaf she shakes,
And oft the sleeping moth she wakes
And diving through the flower she takes,
The honey with her fairy rakes,
And in her cell the same she cakes,
Or sports across the silver lakes,
Besides her children, for whose sakes,
How skilfully she builds her cell,
How neat she spreads her wax,
And labours hard to store it well
With the sweet food she makes.
In works of labour or of skill,
I would be busy too,
For Satan finds some mischief still
For idle hands to do,
For idle hands to do,
For idle hands to do, do, do,
Things which thereafter they will rue,
When Justice fiercely doth pursue,
Or conscience raises Cry and Hue,
And evil-doers look quite blue,
When Peelers run with loud halloo,
And Magistrates put on the screw,
And then the wretch exclaims, Boo-hoo,
In works of labour or of skill
I wish I’d busied too,
For Satan's found much mischief still,
For my two hands to do.
There ! Would a Poet get much reputation
for these Wariations, which are much better in
their way than most of those built upon tunes.
Would the poetical critics come out, as the
musical critics do, with “Upon WATTs's marble
foundation BUGGINs has raised a sparkling ala-
baster palace; ” or, “The old-fashioned WATTs
has been brought into new honour by the
&tincellant BugGINs ; ” or “We love the old
tune, but we have room in our hearts for the
fairy-like fountains of bird-song which BugGINs
has bid start from it.” Mr. Punch has an idea
that BUGGINs would have no such luck; the moral
to be deduced from which fact is, that a Musical
Prig is luckier than a Poetical Prig.
Wanted, a Garibaldi for Cottonopolis.
MANchestER Gaol for Debtors, is, (according
to an elaborate and apparently trustworthy report
which has just appeared) a worthy rival of the
prison dens at Naples and elsewhere, recently
thrown open. The unfortunate debtors are stated
to be treated with a brutality—especially as re-
gards, the sick—which makes us quite proud of
Manchester. The system of espionage, harsh-
ness, , insult, and tyranny, as described } the
complainants, is trul creditable to a city that is
always clamorous about reforms. , Mr. Punch
has no evidence on the subject but the state-
ments in the papers, but if one quarter of what
is there charged be true, the sooner a Manchester
.." appears the better for the unhappy
ebtors.
AN ODD º: often been com-
pared to a Boot; but, what is still more odd, it
is a Boot that is not without its Gaëta.

I thought—those strong and skilful skates What if this master-figurant, What royal hands, of all around
Are like a flying ferry Who nothing seems to stick at, That he first took, then dropped them,
O'er crack and pool, yet drags are far,
Froze up each punt and wherry,
Darksome and deep the water's sleep,
And the ice dangerous—very.
For whom no wheel too sudden is,
No labyrinth too intricate,
Broke in or slipped, where under-streams
The ice's edge run quick at 2
Would rescue him, that in the hole
So oft has left or popped them?

MARONITES AND MARTYRS.
By way of *f; aC-
counts with the . Druse
tribes, , the . Maronite
Bishops have united in de-
manding of the Turkish
and French forces in Syria,
the slaughter of four thou-
sand Druses, to balance
the massacres which those
other barbarians committed
last summer on the Maro-
nites. It appears, however,
that the Druses slew the
Maronites in self-defence,
or at least under bodily
fear, into which they had
been thrown by a pastoral
of the Itight REVEREND
SEPhRoNIUS, , Bishop. of
Tyre and Sidon, inviting
his flock, on a day ap-
pointed, to rise upon the
Druses, and, with a view
to plundering their pro-
perty, to slay them. ...To
enforce this exhortation,
the Bishop chiefly insisted on the argument, that the Drusº were *
race neither warlike nor numerous, and therefore might be robbed and
murdered with great facility. - - - -
SephroNIUs, and his brothers of the Druse episcopacy, rejoice in
communion with the Roman See. The Holy Father was moaning the
other day over the woes of his Maronite children, at the same time
much more loudly bewailing his own. Those victims seem not tº have
been quite such meek martyrs as they were painted by his Holiness.
The massacre of the Maronites, apparently, was quite a different thing
from the massacre of the Innocents. Bishop SEPHRONIUs and his
mitred colleagues at any rate evidently understand Christian forgive;
ness to mean the return of injuries with usurious interest. If, all that
we are told of Sephronius is true, that worthy is simply a brigand.
What does the Pope think of such a Prelate? That he would make a
good Premier, perhaps, if anything happened to ANTQNRELI.
Otherwise, his Hoſiness might be disposed to think that SEPHRONIUs
might do better than rule the Church of Tyre and Sidon. He might
conceive that such an ornament of the Catholic hierarchy might be
advantageously translated. In that case he would perhaps constitute
SEPhRosius the Archbishop of Dahomey in partibus, and his brethren
who demand the death of four thousand Druses his suffragan bishops.
Whenever King BADAHUNG wanted to fill a blood-pond, he would, no

PARLIAMENTARY REHEARSALS.
(By our Theatrical Reporter.)
The Rehearsals for the approaching Parliamentary Performance are
now regularly proceeding, and we are happy, to be able to say that the
actors are very forward in their parts, indeed almost letter-perfect.
We have been privileged to pay visits to the stage while these
interesting preparations were going on, but it would be manifestly
unfair to the Theatre to forestall the interest of startling novelties
by any premature disclosure of the character of the performances. We
would rather excite than satisfy the curiosity of the public by men-
tioning that MR. Dizzy has a very good part, of an entirely novel kind,
in which he has some splendid declamation about the Church of his
Fathers, and some fine samples of Rating for his antagonists. MR.
Russell is once more fitted with an historical character, with truly
British appeals to Magna Charta, and other patriotic sentiments; but
we are almost afraid that the day for this kind of thing has gone by.
MR. PAMMY has a part in which his genial, light-hearted style will be
well exemplified; and the way in which he will suddenly turn the
tables upon an Italian adventurer, who is supposed to hold the key of
the situation of the drama in question, will bring down, or we mistake,
a burst of applause from all sides. MR. DERby is, we are happy to
say, quite recovered from his illness, and is rehearsing an excellent
sarcastic and declamatory part, in which his unmatched elocution will
be very effective. MR. GLADSTONE, so far as we could make out, does
not seem at ease with what he will have to do, and complains
that there is “something wanting,” and that he shall tax the
endurance of the audience; but we make no doubt that when he
warms to his work, he will acquit himself with his accustomed
brilliancy. MR. Beth ELL has a tremendous part, perhaps one of the
longest that a performer ever had to study. It is in a piece called
The Bankrupt, or, the Augean Stable, partially rehearsed last session,
and we are certain that this artist will build himself a permanent
reputation from one Act. MR. ARGILL will sustain his favourite part of
the Young Duke, and report says that he has toned down a good deal
of its flippancy. Of the ladies' characters we must speak with more
reticence, but we shall, we believe, be again delighted with MRs.
Roebuck in the Shrew, and those excellent old women, MRs. Roden,
MRs. PLAINJOHN CAMPBELL, and MRs. Montº AGLE, will, in the course
of the season, sustain their respective parts of Mrs. Cantwell, Mrs.
Mumblebumble, and Mrs. Bore. Before concluding this brief notice we
must in all friendliness caution the management to throw more
energy into their business. The waits between the acts are a
great deal too long, the performances conclude at far too late
an hour, and the refreshments are not very good and are dear.
Public conſidence is only to be got by desert. We also hope
that steps will be taken to put an end to the scandalous practice
of paying extra for seats—in fact, , bribing those who have the
power to put people in. No respectable theatre now permits this, and
it is contrary to the habit of the age. We also protest against the
slovenly appearance of the Bills, some of which are full of blunders,
and others of holes, and this.really must be attended to. . Subject to
these remarks, we wish the Westminster Theatre a successful season.
CHILDREN IN CRINOLINE.
It is an old saying, that the child is father of the man; and if this
be so, we fancy it can hardly be less true that, when feminine, the child
is mother of the woman. On this account we grieve to see the rage
there is at present for dressing little girls in Crinoline on every state
occasion, if indeed they are not so costumed in ordinary life. At a
juvenile party, where we lately danced attendance, we computed that
the belle of the evening (aged four) was fully six times and a half as
broad as she was long; and many of the other little ladies who were
resent were in their magnitude of petticoat almost equally as great.
ow, if the love of a large flounce be implanted in a child, the chances
are, we think, that it will grow with the child's growth, and will every
year become increasingly developed. They who look therefore for
Crinoline to be diminished and discarded, can scarcely see much hope
for this in seeing children wear it. On the contrary, the chances are
that when our little girls grow up, they will be found far more exten-
sive in their dress than were their mothers; and if their descendants
increase in the like fashion, there will really be no guessing how pre-
posterous a petticoat will be displayed by our (with emphasis we may
regard them as) great granddaughters.
Dinner and Tea Traits.
You never hear one woman invite another woman out to dinner, any
more than you ever hear one man ask another to come and take tea
with him. No 1 it would seem that women's hearts melted and
softened over the tea-cup, and that men's souls flew open_to each
other with the table-cloth. Who is there to explain it? . It takes
several knives and forks to dig into a man's secret nature, whereas the
simple key of the tea-caddy will unlock a woman's breast at any time.<

chaussure of another, mostly goes on a bootless errand.

THE MODERN GOVERNESS.
A. YoUNG LADY's IDEA OF THE USE of CRINOLINE |
THE ONLY CURE.
A STRONG MINDED Lady says that the only possible way
of curing gentlemen of the filthy habit of smoking is for
the ladies to enter into a solemn compact to adopt the same
practice themselves. The gentlemen would then see how
disgusting as well as senseless the custom was, and, out
of their respect to decency, if not to reason, they would
be compelled to abandon it. The lady in question (we are
at liberty to state that she occupies a very high rank in the
First Belgravian Blues) authorises us to state that she
does not mind being the first, herself to set the noble
example. She is perfectly ready and willing to immolate
herself on the ashes of a cigar, or even a pipe, for the
benefit of her suffering sisters. Anything to shame the
gentlemen out of their selfishness, and to ridicule them
into a sense of the proper respect that ought to be paid to
the Superior Sex. Other incense than that of tobacco-
smoke, she maintains, is Lovely Woman's duel
FASHION FOR THE FIREPLACE.
We have seen a sweet thing in muslin for mornin
dress. It is a light and beautiful fabric, admirably j
for expansion on the most extensive Crinoline. But the
pattern of it is that which is so very pretty. It is figured
all over with flames and little grotesque figures, constitu-
ting, in fact, a charming imitation of the vestment in which
the Spanish Inquisition used to adorn the victims about to
be sacrificed at an auto da fé. Indeed, in the vocabulary
of fashion, this...elegant and ladylike garment has been
christened the “Samarra.” The idea of it has been
suggested by the numerous cases wherein ladies have
lately been burnt alive in consequence of their delightfully
wide skirts catching fire.

A HOOT FROM A NEW FOREST OWL.
* DEAR MR. PUNCH -
* I Am a new Forest Owl ... an old bird—too old to learn
new fashions, or to take comfortably to new quarters. I was happy
in the venerable yew, which shadowed the graves over which I, and
my fore-owls have meditated through many a still warm midsummer
afternoon, and many a nipping winter's brief daylight, when shallow
mankind deemed us sleeping. They little know what thoughts occupy
us owls, at times when, to men's eyes, we seem to be blinking and
dozing, and waiting for the dark. HARVEY's Meditations among the
Tombs used to be a favourite book when I was a fledgling. I suppose
it is Å. out of fashion long ago. I had thoughts of submitting my
‘Meditations among the Tombs' to HATCHARDs for publication, but I am
quite out of heart about it now. I had hoped to end my days in the
venerable family yew-to close my eyes on the old grey family church
tower. But all such hopes have been suddenly knocked on the head.
The sad fact is that, even in this remote nook of England, we have had
our BRYAN KING on a small scale. A Puseyite young man, in a
pygostole and high waistcoat, has come down upon us, with his appa-
ratus of bran new and intensely old notions on the subject of ritual
and architecture. . He has made, a clean sweep of the yew, and the
old church, round whose foundations its roots were twisted. I
suppose I ought to be grateful that he has left the graves.
* It is not often that we owls wax poetical. We are not usually
admitted to take rank among ‘singing-birds.' But I hope you will
consider that the feeling which stimulated JUVENAL, may be allowed
to urge even an Owl into rhyme—
“Facit indignatio versum."
“Don’t be surprised at my quoting from a classical poet. We Owls
are well-educated birds-as far as the dead languages go. There are
few of us—especially of the families connected with the Church, as
mine has been for many generations—who don't know Latin. I there-
fore enclose you the first and last Rhymes of an Evicted Old Owl.
“The Goths have demolished my sacred old yew,
Have shattered the gravestone, and levelled the pew.
But their new-fangled church stranger changes environ,
For the preacher’s of wood and the pulpit's of iron;
The benches and doctrines so fearfully narrow,
That frost-bitten Christians are numbed to the marrow ;
No token of heaven appears, but its breezes,
And the sermon's coughed down, or half stifled by sneezes;
These censures perhaps may seem nauseous and silly, but
So are the freaks of the High Priests of Lilliput.”
CONSCIENCE-MONEY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
OF course, nobody expects that persons who send Conscience-money
to the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequeB are possessed of their right
senses, and know how they ought to act: but we really think that measures
should, if possible, be taken to prevent their using signatures which
may mislead the public, as to who are the weak simpletons by whom
the money has been sent. We rarely now take up the Times without
finding in its columns some such paragraph as this, which was there
inserted on Friday, the 25th ult.:--
“THE CHANcellor of THE Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of bill-stamps
to the amount of £4 la. 8d., on account of Income-Tax from F.C. B.W.; also of the
first half of a bank-uote for £100, on account of Income-Tax, from A. S."
“F. C. B. W.” perhaps may be excused, for such a junction of
initials, can scarce be very common. But, how many hundreds of
“A. S.”s there are extant here among us, it would puzzle the most
calculating boy of us to guess. Imagination shrinks from fancyin
what numbers of innocent individuals have been tortured this last wee
through the use of these initials. - - - -
If a person have a wish to play the fool in this way, for the credit of
his country let him be anonymous, and not throw out any clue whereby
he may be recognised. “A Maniac,” “A Would-be Bedlamite,” or
“One who should Wear a Strait-jacket,” would be signatures well
suited to the act they would endorse. But to use merely initials
is surely wanton cruelty, and in justice to humanity the practice must
be stopped.

which the former elements are allowed some chance. It is not my
purpose to say anything, just now, of the Pantomimes—beyond a good
word, en passant, for #. enuine old Pantomimic humours that have
been brought into play in Robinson Crusoe at the Princess's, for which
I am truly grateful. I wish to tell you this week of the pleasure I
have received from Endymion at the St. James's. - -
“After the gratification of seeing MR. ALFRED WIGAN die of poison
through two acts—and if toxicology has any right to a place among the
“fine arts,’ it must be when such an artist as MR. ALFRED WIGAN is
made the subject of its operation—I was naturally in the mood to
relish an hour of graceful pleasantry, such as MR.W. BROUGH has
provided for me in his Endymion. Now that the Greek Heroes are
dished up in nursery stories, Diana and her shepherd lover of Latmos
have no right to be indignant at being pressed into the service of
Christmas burlesque. But apart from the question of dignity, the
Lady of the Crescent has really no good ground of complaint when she
is presented in the graceful figure of Miss HERBERT-as the central
personage of a group of attendant huntresses, quite worthy to play the
part of gillies to such a mistress.
“I do not remember, after a longish experience of Christmas classi-
oalities, from the good old days of the Olympic Revels downwards,-
to have seen a classical subject more pleasantly treated than the loves
of Endymion and Diana, the jealousy of Pan, the distresses of Actaeon,
and Alpheus's pursuit of Arethusa under difficulties, are in this little
iece at the St. James's. But, besides the general merits of the piece
in the way of construction, dialogue, and acting, it exhibits one par-
ticular piece of courage which it is a special duty in your Correspondent,
above all others, to point out. Diana has absolutely had the courage
and good taste to abjure Crinoline / Yes; incredible, as the assertion
may appear, it is a positive fact. Everyone who wishes to renew his
recollection of what woman is like when reduced to her natural
dimensions,—to study the movements of the human form divine instead
of the undulations of a muslin bell, expanded over a steel cage, ought
to make a point of seeing Diana at the St. James's. I really don’t
know where else the sight is to be enjoyed at this moment.
“Such an apparition ought to be a death-blow to Crinoline. There
have been few more poetical pictures exhibited on any stage than that
in which the Goddess descends in her silver car to kiss the lips of the
sleeping shepherd, and that which concludes the piece, with so com-
mendable a substitution of a simple and beautiful group for those bewil-
dering accumulations of carpentry, pyrotechnics, and corps, de ballet
which are generally considered the indispensable finale of this sort of
entertainment.
“In short, I have quite a pleasant recollection of this Endymion, for
the unpretentiousness, gracefulness, and good taste which have been
combined both in its planning and its production. And the sensation
is so rare with me now-a-days, at Christmas, that I have thought
it worthy of this somewhat emphatic record from
“ONE WHO PAYs.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SLANG OF THE SHOPS.
OF a truth the English language is in a terribly sad way. What with
the fever for French phrases that rages with some writers, and the
rash of Greek and Latin that keeps breaking out in others, there will
soon be very little, of pure healthy English left; and of that little a
portion will speedily be swamped in the flood of German compounds
which is annually swelling here. Then besides this German Ocean, the
tide of Hindostanee is rising in this country, and threatening the “well
of English undefiled.” From this source it is said that the word
“loot” is derived, and the cant term “that's the cheese,” corrupte
from the Hindostamee “cheez,” which means the “thing.” Add to
this the coarse vulgarities that BROTHER JONATHAN has sent us, and
the eruption of slang phrases where with we are infected, thanks
mainly to the efforts of the authors of burlesques, and it will surely be
acknowledged that the tongue of MR. BULL is in a most unhealthy
state.
Of all the evils that affect the health of his vocabulary, perhaps mone
are more injurious than the slang terms used in trade; for it is obvious
that, as we are a nation of shopkeepers, words so used must soon be
in everybody’s mouth. Whatever phrase be coined for purposes of
trade will speedily pass current in all commercial circles; and though
it be as tasteless and uncouth as the bronze penny, few critics will
care to raise their voice against it. Accustomed as we are to read of
pig iron being “quiet,” and breadstuffs, being “dull,” of tallow being
“firm at rather stiffer rates,” or pork “moving off slowly at previous
quotations,” we are tempted by mere habit to incorporate these
phrases among our purer English terms, and to use them in a while
without a shudder at their vileness. Thus becomes our language more
and more corrupted, and the work of purging it more loathsome and
appalling. Even Punch, the modern 1. might shrink from the
endeavour to cleanse the English tongue from the fouler than Augean
filth which has been heaped on it.
As a sample of how slang is gradually supplanting the pure English
of our Dictionaries, we submit to public notice a few extracts from a
circular by a “Cove,” as he would doubtless call himself, who shall be
nameless, but who states that as a “Slap-up Tog and Out-and-Out
Kicksies Builder,” he is “well known throughout the world by
working-men:”—
“MR. NAMELEss nabs the chance of putting his customers awake, that he has
just made his escape from India, not forgetting to clap his mawley's upon some of
the right sort of stuff, when on his return home he was stunned to find one of the
top Manufacturers of Manchester had cut his lucky, and stepped off to the Swan
Stream, leaving behind him a valuable stock of Moleskins, Cords, Velveteens, Box
Cloths, Plushes, Doe Skins, Pilots, &c., and having some ready in his kick-grabbed
the chance—stepped home with the swag—and is now safely landed at his crib. He
i. º: 3.19%ry very slap at the following low prices for Ready Gilt—Tick
ling No Go.
What sort of “working-men” are they to whom such slang as this
is commonly intelligible, we think that any ragged schoolboy would be
found able to guess. Men who work with “jemmies,” and such slang:
christened implements, one might expect to talk of “mawleys,” and
gº - - xx -
º: homeward with the swag;” but that an English tradesman
should apparently court custom from housebreakers and thieves by
putting forth a circular in their peculiar phraseology, we own we
should not have considered it in reason to suppose. . .
Here, however, is another sample of shop-slang, which tends strongly
to confirm the guess for whom it is intended:–
"Upper Benjamins, built on a downy plan, a monarch to half-a-finnuff. Fishing
or Shooting Togs, cut slap, l pound, l quarter and a peg. A Fancy Sleeve Blue
Plush or Pilot ditto, made very saucy, a couter. Pair of Bath or Worsted Cords,
cut to drop down on the trotters, a quid. Pair of out and out Cords, built very
serious, 9 bob and a kick. Pair of stout Broad Cords, built in the Melton
Mowbray style, half a sov. Pair of Moleskins, built with a double fakement down
the sides and artful buttons at bottom, half a monarch.
Mud pipes, knee caps, and trotter cases built very low.
N.B.-Gentlemen finding their own Broady can be accommodated.
The “Artful Dodger” and his pals may find this comprehensible;
but readers who have had a merely common education would be
uzzled to translate it into ordinary English. . Far be it from us to
H. that MR. NAMELEss § deals with pickpockets and house-
breakers, and therefore suits his language to the customers he seeks;
but really such a thought would fairly be excusable, for, on no other
rounds can we explain the fact of his writing in Thieves' Latin while
É. business is in London, and might surely be transacted in the
language of the land.
“O, &c., my Uncle!”
THE Irish have blundered to the last about Italy. They begged to
give LAMoRICIERE a Sword of Honour. He writes to them, saying,
truthfully enough, that, he has won no honour in Italy, and therefore
the Sword would be a Bull. But though the weapon is not to go to
Rome, funds must be raised to pay the maker, and the Sword is ve
likely to be sent into Lombardy, which is near enough for Iris
topography.
THE SYMPATHETIC SLAWE-OWNERS.
(As Sung by the Pope in Secret Consistory.)
OWENERABLE Brothers, we should sympathise with others,
We have fellows in misfortune o'er the broad Atlantic waves,
Though they’re not in our communion, for the South States of the Union
Are suffering impairment of their property in slaves.
Rights of Nature not a word of ! An atrocity unheard of
Is all subjects' self-assertion against constituted powers,
d|No matter what the case is, and whatever are the races,
And whether those enslaved are the Americans' or ours.
The offence is most prodigious, to be sure, when irreligious,
Like the horrible rebellion which assails this Holy See,
Adding sacrilege to treason, as is manifest to reason,
Well aware that Lord Lieutenant of all Christendom are We,
The detestable opinion that our temporal dominion
Stands not on right divine, we altogether do condemn.
It was settled on St. Peter and on Us that in his seat are,
Which if any shall gainsay, a curse on him or her or them.
With heresy infected are the States that hold subjected
Four million human beings, it is lamentably true,
But they keep them in subjection by sach laudable correction,
That we hope they may exchange their false persuasion for the true.
Oh the salutary rigours which they practise on their niggers,
Whom by wholesome flagellation to their work the planters drive.
And with zealous fury storming, mobs, an act of faith performing,
Often give their slaves a warming, roasting wicked ones alive
We P. our condemnation on the monstrous innovation
Of wretches whose audacity to such a pitch has grown,
That, the Rulers’ right denying—without fear of endless frying—
They maintain the souls and bodies of our slaves are not our own.
Oh, nefarious proposition! May their doom be swift perdition!
May they suffer every kind of ail, calamity, and ill:
Whilst they wait their final sentence, in default of their repentance,
Who hold We may not wollop Our own niggers when we will
BULL’S-EYE BRACELETS.
As any novelty in finery is pretty certain to attract the eyes of the
fair sex, who even at church can hardly º their looks off a new
bonnet, we take it quite for granted that every lady who reads this is aware
that a new bracelet has been lately introduced, which combines cheapness
with elegance in a remarkable degree. It consists simply of rifle-caps,
discharged and then electro-gilt; and is in reality a º, pretty orna-
ment, with the additional advantage of being very cheap. So being,
it deserves to be held in high esteem, perhaps higher than its value
may intrinsically justify. To add therefore to its worth, we would
suggest that every cap whereof each bracelet is composed should be
a cap whereby a bullet has been fired into the bull's-eye, the value of
course varying according to the range at which the shot has been dis.
charged. Thus ladies might do much to assist the rifle movement,
more even than by giving balls and bugles to those moving in it, were
they to stimulate the taste for practice at the butts by requirin buli's.
§. bracelets of their husbands or their lovers, or whomever else they
chanced to hold in their control. Were ANGELINA to tell Edwin that
he must not dare to hope for the honour of her hand, until he clasped
her arm with a bracelet made of caps whose shots had struck the .#.
eye, a powerful incentive would be given to his shooting, and his skill
in marksmanship would certainly improve. The requirement might
vary according to caprice, and a lady of unusually cruel disposition or
who was unnaturally careless about marriage, might insist upon the
bull's-eyes being scored at no less distance than a thousand yards, or
an even greater range might in some instances be named. Of course
precautions would be taken to have the caps all certified as being bull's-
eye caps, and a stamp should be affixed by the captain of the corps, as
a warranty that there was no ... in the matter, and that Edwin
was as good a marksman as they showed. This indeed seems needful
not merely because men have been “deceivers ever;” and, as they hold
all fair in love, there is no saying of what foul tricks they might possibly
be capable; but also because, judging from our own private experience,
or experience as a private, there are many marksmen among our Volun.

THE AMERICAN MARKET.
(The Last Yarn of the Atlantic Telegraph.)
CowHIDEs were a little heavy, but in goodsteady demand.
Holders very firm. The exchange by no means so striking
as it has been known to be, and receivers to a large extent
were complaining. Backers very scarce, and extremely
cautious. Down South, however, cowhides were falling in
all directions.
Bowie-KNIves were not to be had for love or money.
The last one was swopped to a Negro-merchant from
Sºuth Carolina, for a meerschaum pipe, a corkscrew, a
silver quid-case, half a pig, a pair of braces, an ounce of
ld-dust, a box of paper collars, two dozen of Eye-
peners, and fifty-two Pennsylvanian Shin-plasters.
Knuckle-DustBRs remain on hand very firmly, though
a large order for the Senate at Washington has given them
a somewhat forward tendency that may have the favourable
effect of making them hit the fancy of the American
public, a little more kindly than they have hitherto done.
The Rowdies and Negro-owners seem to fight rather shy
of these knuckle-dusters, though it was expected at first
that they would . carry everything before them.
Their effect is undoubted, as all unbiassed persons are
unanimous in testifying who have had an opportunity of
feeling the weight of them.
Revolvers go off very briskly. All the reports are
loud in favour of Colt's. Every one of the Southern
Members has had a handsome brace of revolvers presented
to him by his constituents. On a silver plate there is this
touching inscription:-"To be discharged on the smallest
suspicion.” The number of barrels vary from the days of
the week up to nearly the days of the month. The object,
as with Guy Faux in the cellars under Parliament, seems
to be to cram in as many barrels as possible. We saw a
beautiful specimen in Wall Street, the other day, that con-
tained not less than twenty-four separate chambers. It
was a perfect gem in the tubular way, and the mere look
9f the thing gave one quite a strong inclination for a row,
just to try, the effect of it. With its potent aid, a child
might easily kill his man a second. It is quite impossible

Q. WBAT is the Schleswig-Holstein question, Papa?
A. Well, my dear boy, I am pleased to see that you have an
inquiring mind, and take notice of what is said in your presence, and I
ji endeavour to make you understand. Schleswig-Holstein is in
Denmark,+that is, it is not exactly in Denmark, at least Schleswig
may be called so, but not Holstein, -no, it is Holstein that may be
considered Danish, or, if you like a long word better, Scandinavian.
Let me see, what did I say,+O yes, Holstein is the German division
of the territory, and Schleswig is an ancient fief (you know what a
fief is) of the Crown, and was ceded in 1816; that is to say, Holstein was
ceded, not Schleswig, Holstein having been an ancient fief of Germany,
and therefore you see Prussia takes an interest in the question, as part
of the German Confederation; but LoBD John Russell is only in
the matter as a mutual friend, and he thinks that the proposals of
Prussia—no, I mean Denmark, yes, of course Denmark, that concessions
shall be made to Holstein-no. Holstein does not want concessions,
but a veto (that is Latin for, I forbid) upon taxation and other things,
and Schleswig to be allowed to speak German—well, Lord John
thinks this fair, but the Prussian minister does not think that, Prussia
-at least Denmark, has any right to impose conditions of this sort,
because there was a promise of a Constitution to Schleswig or Hol.
stein, I forget which, but the principle is the same, and there are some
other points mixed up with it which you might not be able to under-
stand so easily as the simple outline of the case which I have given
you. Pass my cup to your Mamma.
The Wrong Man for the Work.
A WoRK is announced by DR.TICK, called, “Memory, and How to

far as we have seen, those who have had most to do with TICK are
decidedly the people of shortest memory.
ROMILLY AND THE BIGOTS.
ExETER Hall hath prevailed, it seems, and hath compelled MR.
TURNBULL, of the Record Office (we mean the National Record Office,
not that of the offensive newspaper) to resign. He is driven out
because he is a Catholic, and the Exeter Hall Protestants entertain
some extraordinary conviction that he might do something dreadful
with the records of the realm. What this could be Mr. Punch is still
as much at a loss to comprehend as he was when the agitation against
MR. TURNBULL, first excited Mr. Punch's ridicule. But, when old
women are once terrified, no argument will persuade them that a stick
is not a gun, or that a gun cannot load and fire itself. The Exeter
Hall old women have gone on howling until it was impossible for MR.
TURNBULL to retain his P. He goes, but not for a dozen such
victories would, Mr. Punch have been one of “the body of so-called
Christians,” whom SIR John Romilly, Master of the Rolls, indig-
nantly rebukes for this act of “persecution.”. To be branded by a
RoMILLY is not a fate to be desired by any good man, and MR. TuRN-
BULL is amply avenged. The sooner the lying pretence of “brotherl

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GHOST OF A GUY
ERUsing the penulti-
mate number of the
Spiritual Magazine,
we found a remark-
able ghost-story. It is
related by a corre-
spondent naming her-
self SARAH WELTON,
at second hand, from
the memoranda of “a
friend J. D., who has
been for several years
a writing medium.”
Under such circum-
stances of course we
are expected to be-
lieve it. -
MR. J. D. told his
friend SARAH WEL-
TON that the best
time for his hand
being used as a me-
dium is in the morn-
ing on waking. Spi-
rits do not eat chest-
nuts, or one would
have imagined that
- their best time for
using his hand was in the evening after dinner, when he happened to
have some roasting in the grate. On May 15, 1859, as J. D. was lying
awake, after the spirits had written several sentences of "what
appeared incoherency,” and probably was not very intelligible, through
his hand, presently he felt a new sensation in his arm, and held out his
hand to be used again; whereupon came the following communication,
“What was written was by several spirits.”
“Do not mix your spirits, if you can help it,” was the moral appa-
rently meant to be conveyed. “Otherwise the result will be inco-
herency.” So it would seem. J. D. proceeds—
“At the same moment there appeared to me a figure, small, as if in perspective,
of a man of above middle age, in ordinary garb, but dusty and faded; his hat looked
out of shape and as if unbrushed for years, his boots rusty brown, down at heel and
turned up at the toes; one hand was carelessly stuck in his pocket, and with the
other he held a bully wrmbrella, the ribs of which were kept together by a ring, aſter the
fashion of ſorty years ago. I saw this figure with such minuteness, that I observed
his front teeth to be wanting as he spoke the above words—which were not, how-
ever audible, but expressed telegraphically through my right forefinger on to my left
hand. In this way I received answers, from this apparent person, to questions."
The italics are our own; meant, only to indicate the points of the
narrative likely to interest the public. It is not often, that you get a
comic ghost-story. A spirit certainly must be an odd immortal to
appear in a shocking, bad hat, a Gamp, umbrella, and seedy boots.
“Who's your hatter?” is the question which one would be naturally
disposed to put to such a spirit. The º'. for the appearance
of inis spiritual ragamuffin seems to have been the desire to show him-
self—a strange one considering the figure he cut. Telegraphically,
through J. D.'s right forefinger on to, his left hand, whatever that
means, this slovenly ghost returned the subjoined answers...to that
jº inquiries. The manifestations are those of cool indifference.
. D. said—
“‘Well, have you anything to say?”—“Nothing particularly,” was the answer
expressed and communicated, as just mentioned.
** What brings you, then º'—“We come about you mediums so as to get to know
what is going on in the old world.”
“‘Did you know me?”—“No."
“‘I don't remember you; were you a Londoner?"—“No, I belonged to one of
the Northern Counties.”
“"When did you leave here?'—"About 1830."
“‘Well, but what do you want with that umbrella P'—‘Oh, I used always to
carry it: it was a habit."
“" But don't you cast aside a useless habit like that; it must be troublesome
now 7"—"No ; it seems natural. The things we wear according to our taste are as
much parts of ourselves as our bodies; old tastes and habits leave us as we get new
thoughts. At present I feel comfortable in my old.'"
It thus appears that this ghost was clothed by his own thoughts,
There is many a sloyen in this world who would be a dandy if he had
as cheap a tailor. But this ghost was peculiarly heedless of personal
appearance. He º: no doubt have been his own dentist as easily
as his own tailor, and yet he chose to appear without his front teeth.
They might not have been useful to a ghost, but they would have been
ornamental. The dialogue thus concludes:–
* “How do you occupy yourself?'—‘I go about looking at things, and making
observations,”
“‘What, alone?”—“I don't care for company.’
“"I have been told that spirits have guides who look after them, and seek to
elevate them?'—"Yes, and they come and talk to me sometimes; but they say
things that I don't agree with."
“To the next question I put, I received no answer: the figure disappeared, and
the writing ceased." p p
The things which the guardian spirits said to this unsocial ghost, and
which he did not agree with, were probably observations on the sub-
ject of personal appearance. Everyone, however, to his taste...If
ghosts appear at : they probably would appear in some attire. This
one carried a Gamp umbrella. It was his habit. Well, certainly, this
reminds us of
“My father in his habit as he lived."
Why shouldn’t a ghost carry an umbrella as well as a truncheon;
why not wear shabby clothes as well as complete mail, if the shabby
clothes were his favourite habit? These questions are certainly un-
answerable; but, before attempting to answer them, most people would
like to be perfectly sure, that, J. D., when he heard through his left
hand, did not see behind his closed eyelids, if not with his eye and his
elbow over the left.
GREATNESS SINGING SMALL.
It is not often that we find so delicious an º of the “pride
that apes humility,” as was the other day afforded by the Mayor and
Corporation of the town of Cambridge, before the ceremony ; matri-
culation of the PRINCE or WALEs. The Vice-Chancellor, attended,
we are told, “by the Esquire Bedells” (Beadledom should know that
there are beadles who are Squires), and “accompanied by the heads of
§: and Proctors,” (whose bodies, we may hope, were also ir
attendance) having first had the honour of introduction to the PRINCs,
the Times informs us that the Mayor, with the Town Clerk at his heels,
and followed by a part of the borough Corporation, was admitted to
the presence, and presented an Address, whereof to serve by way of
model, we copy the first paragraph:—
“To His Royal HighNESS ALBERT PRINCE or Wales.
“May it please your Royal Highness, We, HER MAJESTY's loyal and faithful
subjects, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the borough of Cambridge, hum-
bly crave leave to be permitted to offer to your Royal Highness our congratulation
upon your admission as a member of the University of Cambridge.”
The notion of a Mayor “humbly craving leave to be permitted” to
congratulate, presents a more ºf picture of humility than we
should have thought it possible for fiction to invent. % will be
noticed that the Mayor does not venture to crave leave directly to con-
gratulate. All he dares aspire to is “humbly to crave leave for per-
mission” so to do; the roundabout phrase symbolising, as it seems to
us, that he wished to make an extra deep obeisance to the PRINCs,
and if need be was prepared to bob, his head down to the dust. Yet
with all this aped humility we doubt not had the Mayor been let to
make a speech he would have called that present moment the proudest
of his life, and we wager that before he stepped into the presence he
stalked along the streets with somewhat in addition to his ordinary
strut. , Who, with the magnificent Mayoral robes around him, and
entrusted with the mission of presenting an address in person to a
Prince, could feel otherwise than proud of the position which he occu-
pied, having the knowledge of how much he would be talked of in the
town, and envied by at any rate all the ladies in it? And why could
not the Mayor have said as much in his Address, and adopted the
“large utterance of the early Mayors,” instead of cringing before
royalty and humbly craving leave for permission to congratulate *
There was nothing mean or sneaking in what he craved to do. A man
is hardly less a man for being made a Mayor; and surely might still
speak in a Fº manly manner. Presenting an address is a respect-
ful act, and as honourable and lawful as it is respectful. Why then
should not our Mayors (whose language is in general akin to that of
Cambridge) adopt a different form of phrase for saying how-de-do to
§ than that which has by custom, but not by sense, been sanc-
tiºned?” May it please your Royal Highness, we are proud to see
you,” or “We congratulate ourselves on being able to congratulate
you..” would be phrases far more fitting, because far nearer to the
truth, than any fawning flunkeyism or absurd circumlocution like
“humbly craving leave for permission to congratulate.”
A Beggarly Empire.
IF Austria ever studied finance in any particular school, we should
say it must have been the Ragged School; for not only is she pauper-
ised, and beggared almost to her last kreutzer, but her very bank-notes
are, what a cook would call, “done to rags.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
QN Monday last, being the day before that appointed for the Meeting
of Parliament, Mr. Punch, who had just returned from, an interview
with his Royal Mistress, was informed by one of his trembling footmen
that a Deputation humbly solicited the honour of admission to his
resence.
“A Deputation of what?” demanded Mr. Punch, in his usual mild and
affable manner. -
“There are Ministers, and Members of Parliament, and all that sort,”
respºnded the vassal, apologetically. -
*I am not fond of receiving the lower orders in my sanctum, as you
know,” returned his master. "“They make it smell of wood-violets
and millefleurs, and Bouquet de Bunkum, and destroy the perfume of
my cigars. However, let them in.” -

rieties of the two Houses.
“Now then, what's up?” demanded Mr. Punch., “Don’t all speak
at once,” added the right honourable gentleman, lighting a weed.
“The fact is, Mr. Punch,” said LoRD PALMERston, "some of the
parties whom you see before you, have a petition to make to you.”
“Let’s see the Beggars' É. said Mr. Punch, blandly.
“Well,” said the PREMIER, “it is to be made verbally.”
... But not verbosely, I trust,” said Mr. Punch. “Go it.”.
“I am not in it, mind,” said PAM, “but I am asked to introduce
the others.”
... Several of us are not in it,” cried divers voices.
“Settle it among yourselves, gentlemen,” said Mr. Punch, “and
when you are quite º fire away. I shan’t offer you Seats, because,
ha! ha! haſ you have a ! seats of your own.”
When the convulsions of laughter which of course rewarded this
epigram had subsided,
LoRD PALMERsroN said. “The fact is, my dear Mr. Punch, they
want you not to publish your world-famous Essence of Parliament
this session.”
“By Jovel" was all that Mr. Punch permitted to escape him, but
the fire in his eye would have eclipsed a raging volcano.
. “I told 'em that it was rather carrying assurance to the point of
impudence,” continued the PREMIER, “to come and ask you such a
thing; but knowing you to be a good-natured party, I said that they
might rely on a civil hearing.”
“Let them speak,” growled Mr. Punch.
"It appears to me, my dear Mr. Punch,” said MR. GLApstone,
“that there are three ways open to me—”
“One is the door, one is the window, and one is up the chimney,”
returned Mr. Punch, furiously. “Perhaps you’d better take the last,
as most likely to soot you.”.
The shout that followed this sally alarmed the guards on duty at
Buckingham Palace.
. “Don’t begin prosing,” said Mr. Punch, appeased by this demonstra.
tion..."Tell me in a few words what it is you all object to.”
. why; said the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer, “in the first
place—
* Ha! would you,” said Mr. Punch, menacingly.
“But I have two complaints,” pleaded MR. &nwosz.
“What are they—corns and the toothacher"—demanded the Inex-
orable. “Take CoCKLE's Pills, I’m told they cure both, and hams
and smoky chimneys into the bargain.”
| Another burst of laughter that set St. Bride's bells jangling, and
brought down eight º: from the upper sky.
| “Listen, Mr. Punch,” said MR. DisrAELI. “I am diametrically
opposed to the prayer of your petitioners, and therefore I can state it
with more candour than if it were my own. They say that you spoil
|all their oratory by your merciless succinctness, that nobody reads any
reports but yours, and that the label which you stick upon a speaker
whom you don't like º: like the shirt of Nessus, and burns like
the circlet of fire placed by Orcus, in the Epicurean, upon the brow of
the priestess.”
“Walker, Dizzy l’” said Mr. Punch. “Half of 'em never heard of
Nessus or Orcus either. Favour me by drawing it mild.”
. “Well, I have put it elegantly for them,” said MR. DisrAELI; “but
in the language of the vulgar, the way you show up a Parliament man
makes his life not worth having.”
“Was I ever unkind to you?” demanded Mr. Punch.
“Never,” said MR. DishAELI, impetuously, “and I am your debtor
for ever for the way you preserve my Attic salt.”
“Do I ever do injustice to any of you? If a man has got anything
fº to say and says his say sensibly, do I ever fail to recognise the
... But we can't all be sensible,” cried several voices.
“Then, don't be sensitive,”, returned Mr. Punch, with the prompt-
ness of lightning. “I comprehend you all, my bloaters... It does not
suit your books to be set down in mine for what you are.”
“We must live,” said a chorus of voices.
“Je ne vois pasla mécessité,” returned Mr. Punch.
i. Mr. Punch,” said LORD Bragg, “you and I do not always think
alike—”
... That is becauseº sometimes think wrongly, my dear Lord.”
“Soil,” said the Earl, laughing. “But I do not join in this petition.
For myself, for my friend DISRAELI, and I believe I may say for
PALMERston, and any others (if there are any) who are really Out-and-
Quters, I am proud to state that I consider your Essence of Parliament
the noblest invention of modern times. With the interest of a novel
and the sparkle of a comedy, it combines the fidelity of a daguerreotype,
and the permanence of a diamond, to which I may add that its impar-
tiality is equalled but by its lucidity, and if its elegance can be paral-
leled it is only by its indispensability. This is an inadequate
tribute—”
“It is,” said Mr. Punch, “but it approximates to Veracity. And
this is the Institution which you would abolish?”
“Only the Pumps among us,” exclaimed the PREMIER, MR. Dis-
RAELI, LoRD DERby, and a few more.
“Ha!” said Mr. Punch, rising, while the assembly trembled,
“And the pauses amid his speech
Were as awful as the sound.”
“I continue,” said Mr. Punch, “to receive from thousands of cor-
respondents (and some of them don't pay the postage, and be hanged
to them!) the most solemn and earnest assurances that the Essence of
Parliament is the Palladium of English liberties, and the air that
Britons breathe, that its unsparing revelations of the proceedings in
your Houses save the Constitution about eleven times a week, an
that if I should at any time discontinue it, the Queen's subjects would
lose not only the most important element in their happiness, but the
foundation of their confidence in existing institutions. While I am
watching, all is well. If I close my eye, O my eye!”
Subdued murmurs, and some sobbings were heard, and then Mr.
Punch resumed, in a mild but firm tone, - "..
“Next week, being that following the meeting of Parliament, the
EssRNck will be resumed. All I shall add is, Look out—and get out.”
The Deputation was about to withdraw with some precipitation,
when Mr. Punch said— - -
“Nay, be good boys, and you have nothing to fear. A bridle for
the horse, a whip for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. Them's
my sentiments, and now all of you stop and liquor.” -
All powerful indeed is eloquence. Every man present instantly burst
into a rapturous cheer for the new instalment of
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Nancio. We have maturely considered the question referred to us by
your Majesty—of the course to be taken in the presence of the con-
tinually increasing force of sacrilegious assailants, the diabolical accu-
racy of their fire, the impediment to the passage of supplies and rein-
forcements by sea interposed by that fleet, the greater part of which
they have feloniously stolen from your Majesty. We are unanimously
of †. that resistance is hopeless, that the capture of the fortress
by the excommunicated enemies of the Church, the fiendish brood of
the Revolution, within a few days or weeks, is certain—that what their
fire cannot accomplish, famine will speedily and surely complete. We are
therefore unanimously of opinion that your Majesty should carry out
to the last his example of heroic devotedness to the great cause of the
Altar and the Throne; that he should remain where he is, to resist till
the last biscuit is eaten and the last cartridge expended; and that he
should then fall a martyr on the breach, by which the excommunicated
rebels enter the fortress as conquerors, but only over the body of your
Majesty. (Prolonged sensation among the Corps Diplomatique. BoM.
BALINo does not seem to see it.) Such, it appears to us, is the duty
clearly marked out for your Majesty by circumstances, by that Royal
dignity which your Majesty has so nobly vindicated, and that Faith in
Holy Church, of which your Majesty is the chief defender and most
devoted son. With the blessing of that Church, I humbly take my

aim.”
EFFECTS OF THE FROST.
A Frve weeks' settled frost, and the thermometer at intervals falling
below zero, are happily in England not every-year occurrences; and we
may surely be excused if, for the benefit of posterity, we recur to them
once more, and note a few of their effects. Having organised a staff
of special weatherproof reporters, who could poke their noses anywhere
without a fear of being frost-bitten, we have gathered a great number
of most interesting statistics, showing the results of the intensity of
cold; and from them we now 3. the following selection, with
which our scientific readers will doubtless be delighted:—
The frost was so severe on Christmas Eve that as Mr. Punch was
brewing a bowl of his hot namesake, the spirit froze into big brandy-
balls the while he poured it out; and though, the water had been
boiling not two minutes before, it came out of the kettle in the form
of a long icicle. .
The same evening Miss SPRIGHTLYE being caught beneath the mis-
tletoe, received a chaste salute from the lips of her adorer, which in
the act of printing it were frozen to her cheek so hard that, till her
aunt came up, she could not break away from them.
Down at Muddleditch in Suffolk, a wretched guest who being single
was sentenced to a garret, found, his shaving-water ice every mornin
when he wanted it, and as he had unluckily brought ivory-handle
hair-brushes, his hands were daily frostbitten in parting his back hair,
nor could he once succeed in doing it exactly in the middle.
. The streams of lº le going to the play during the holidays were, it
is presumed, mostly frozen on the way, for very few were found to
reach their destination.
..MR. Closerist in the Christmas week having asked a friend to dine
with him, gave him such a cold reception that he took a sudden chill at
the moment of his entrance, and there being nothing stronger than
claret after dinner, the poor man returned home with an attack of
influenza, from which till the thaw came his sufferings were intense.
Miss QUALLER, being asked to sing during the frost, and having
what the critics call a “liquid” voice, found her articulation so im:
peded by the cold that she was unable to get out a single note.
Qne of the most facetious contributors to Punch, on sitting down to
write his usual supply, discovered that although his nose and knees
were in the fire, and his inkstand in a saucepan of hot water on the
hob, the ink froze in his pen the instant, he had dipped it, and as the
wit flowed from his brains it congealed into dry humour, and could
scarcely be º out. -
Two young Clergymen, in Kent, in defiance of their bishop, left eff
shaving, on the ground of its being in such weather cruelty to animals.
But such, it is supposed, was the effect of the frost, that {j a hair
succeeded in sprouting on their cheeks, and their chins and upper lips
were equally left barren. -
At upwards of a thousand new, and therefore ill-built houses during
Christmas, the soup that left the kitchen in an almost boiling state
was, through the cold draughts in the ſº served out as savoury
jelly; while the custards were solidified into hard ice-creams, and the
only things that came to table hot were the cayenne pepper and the
temper of the master.
To keep itself from freezing a snipe flew down the shaft, of a glass
furnace in the North, and the frost was so intense, that though, the
bird went through the very hottest of the fire, it came out quite alive,
and was scarcely even singed by it. --- - - - -
A hirsute volunteer, who lives in terror of bronchitis, having in his
usual manner buttoned his beard beneath his tunic as a protection, to
his chest, had it frozen during drill so firmly to his shirt front, that
when ordered to move “Eyes Right!” he found he could not turn his
head, and so he had to go through drill with his “eyes front” in every
movement.
So severe was the frost in some parts of the country that hundreds of
old hares were found turned white with terror at it.
An extremely striking proof of the intensity of cold was afforded at
the house of a gentleman at Peckham, whose butler when, examining
the plate after a dinner party, found that in the A. of the washing
up, all the salvers, forks, and spoons were turned to frosted silver.
But of all the marvellous effects of the late frost, we have heard of
mone to equal a fact for which a gentleman named SM-TH is our
authority. We learn from this observer, that a street organ perform-
ing opposite his doorstep, while ºjº. of HANDEL's—or more
correctly HANDLE's—delicious Water Music had its pipes all frozen
hard, but a change to Drops of Brandy gradually thawed them.
SALUTING A CAPTAIN.
ALMost as soon as CAPTAIN DoD's invaluable Parliamentary Com.
panion reached us, we learned that MR.TITUs SALT, M.P. for Bradford,
had malevolently resolved in defacing one item in the manual. What
does TITUs mean by retiring? His namesake, the delight of mankind,
never retired, until he went off for good and all. he mean to
imply that the House of Commons is not worth its Salt P. Does he
forget that in the nautical debates likely to come on, there could not
be a better adviser than an Old Salt? Does he think that Punch could
not make about a thousand more epigrams upon him? Does he think
Panch will? Because if he does he thinks a great mull, Mr. Punch's
only object in this paragraph being to puff CAPTAIN Doo's invaluable
Parliamentary Companion, because it needs no puffing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CONVIVIALITY AND SCIENCE.
OME people, while it
lasted, grumbled sadly
at the frost, but we
suspect º
of them, in spite of
their ºf umust
have had a jo ly time
of it. We think, if
fair statistics could be
ſurnished on the sub-
ject, it would be found
that the consumption
of the good things of
this life has been in
the last six weeks very
much above the ave-
rage. To men in
health “fine bracing
weather,” with the
temperature at zero,
is known to have a
marvellous effect upon
the appetite, and when there is anything unusual in the way of
cold without, an extra dose, of warm within is pretty sure to be
prescribed for it. With a hungry Gnaw-Gnaw-Easter daily bitin
one to bits, one need, have something extra in the way of vita
sustenance, and stimulants seem needful to keep up one's vital
heat, and to protect the inner man from any risk of being frostbitten.
It is true that this is really an erroneous idea, and your medical man
will tell you that the influence of alcohol is to increase your chance
of frostbite, as in reality it makes you more susceptible of cold. Still,
unless you are possessed of a remarkably strong mind, you will continue
to place credit in the pleasant old delusion, and if there be any spirits
present where you are, you will not hesitate to try if they have power
to keep the cold out. -
But besides the extra feasting occasioned by the temperature, and
the extra nightly glass or, two medicinally swallowed, the frost has
found excuse for a good deal of joviality, enjoyed under the plea of
purely scientific purposes. e don't know how many of our friends,
so long as the cold lasted, considered it incumbent on themselves to
watch its progress, and to sit up half the night with a guest or two for
company, that they might make a record of the coldest time. That
this was not peculiar merely to our friends, the columns of the news-
papers afforded ample proof. Scarcely a Times passed without, the
printing of a letter from some vigilant observer, who besides telling
the Universe that his thermometer at Boggleditch marked on the
morning of his writing thirty-nine degrees of frost, stated that the
coldest period was after three A.M., up to which hour he was conscious
of having watched the glass. Upon statements such as this, cruel
people might of course indulge in cruel comments, and hint at the
observer's being carried up to bed, as a reason why his observations of
the temperature were not carried down to a later hour than three.
But without inclining to such savage .." of looking at it, we think
that science is compatible with no small amount of jollity, and that
when men take to watching their wet bulbs they are not unapt to make
at times a wettish night of it. Although the glass may certify the
weather is “set fair,” other moisture may be present than that which
is in the atmosphere; and when glasses, not, thermometers, have
sparkled on the board before a meeting of savants, “much haze” may
be the record noted in their journals, while the readings of their night
tubes should be taken with some caution, as their powers of observa-
lion may chance to have been double.
Railway Remembrancers.
When a Railway train stops at a Station you hear the porters
running by and shouting something which, if you know where you
are, you understand to be the name of the place. At the same time,
newspaper boys also run by bawling, "Times, Punch, Once a Meek,” &c.
Now there is another cry which, if heard at the same time, might
prove a salutary warning. Young, lawyers’, clerks might be usefully
employed in trotting along, the platform close to the carriages, and
crying, “Make your wills, ladies and gentlemen; make your wills l’’
Much intestacy would be thus prevented.
A Man Called out of his Name.
We can't conceive a greater misnomer than that of the Plaintiff in
the great case of PATERson v. BUoNAPARTE now being tried in Paris.
To think of a man being called PATER-son, when the very question
at issue is, whether he is to be allowed to be the lawfully-begotten son
of his own Pater—and the chances are a hundred to one against it!
MEDICAL MAGPIES.
WHAT fools there are in the world!. This, we are aware is not a
novel observation; in spite, however, of its staleness, we cannot but
§: it to the following intelligence, which we copy from the Daily
ews of Tuesday in last week;-
“Saxon SUPERSTITION.—The following request was, in an open letter, made to
the first Chamber of Deputies at Dresden on the 19th of December last: “Dresden,
December 17, 1860. The Sisters' Establishment of this place prepares and sells a
powder against epilepsy, with the permission of the Government. For this purpose
magpies are u who (l) must be shot in the time between the 24th of December
and the 18th of January, and who (!) must be deficient in neither claws nor feathers.
Innumerable º: have been cured by these powders; but unfortunately these
magpies are so difficult to obtain, that the strong demand for these powders cannot
be satisfied. The undersigned therefore humbly requests the honourable gently
and nobility of the Chamber, for the sake of the charitable purpose, to shoot as
many magpies as ible during the abovementioned time, and to send tten to
the Sisters' Establishment of this place. (Signed) Orto Von Eadwan NspoR.F.' An
complying with this request, some of the first noblemen in Saxony have put their
names to the letter.”
“Innumerable people have been cured by these powders!”. Have
they, indeed?., Pray what number is intended by the adjective “innu-
merable?” Does it mean two or three, or even half a dozen? Before
the noblemen of Saxony went magpie-shooting for the Sisters, we trust
their minds were satisfied upon this not unimportant point.
If the Sisters be “of Charity,” as we presume they are, of course
they won't object to let the secret they possess be transmitted over
here to us for charitable purposes. Epilepsy is, unhappily, not unknown
In Fº and there are many of our countrymen who would gladly
add their names to the “innumerable” persons whom the Sisters'
charm has cured. If they will send us the prescription, and any one
of our physicians will attest its efficacy, we promise to go out in person
next December, and shoot as many magpies as we can get near. We
will also do our utmost to get up a Magpie Hospital for Epileptic
Patients, and we will advertise the Magpie Powders against Epilepsy
as widely as professors of quack medicines puff their i.
While we write, a little bird comes flying, flying West; and informs
us that a magpie has been taken up in Dresden, and formally arraigned
before the Chamber of Deputies for the heinous crime of singing in the
streets the following song?—
AIR-"The Perfect Cure.”
Good º: all, although I’m small,
Great things, when dead, l’ll do ’em:
You’ve only got to get a pot,
Wherein my bones you’ll stew 'em :
When done, me to a powder grind,
And then, of this l’m sure,
For Epilepsy you will find
I am a Perfect Cure!
But see my claws are whole, because
I’m useless else, remember,
M {...". too; and mind that you
on't boil me till December.
Then grind me up, and you will see,
As sure as eggs are sure
For ;º Sihº'ſ hel
I am a Perfect Cure!
Now pray don't laugh, or try to chaff,
Or think my fun f 'm poking,
I’ve but averred the truths I’ve heard
From men too grand for joking:
The noble swells of Saxony
Have made assurance sure,
And signed a note to certify
That I'm a Perfect Cure!
Chorus.
A Cure! a Cure! a Cure! a Cure!
For Epilepsy sure:
The nobs, he ſhe have said of me,
“Yes, he's a Perfect Cure!”
Cam a Chattel be a Criminal 2
In the eyes of the Slaveholders a Slave is deemed a thing, a bit of
property, a chattel, Granting this, be so, there comes just now the
question, Can a thing do wrong? Can a chattel commit murder? If
not—and common sense appears to justify the negative—on what ground
is the charge made against ANDERson the fugitive P He, a chattel
slew a slaveholder who hindered his escape. If this be reckone
murder, then, as things can do no murder, must slaves be counted men,
and be no longer viewed and sold as being merely chattels. Utrumne
horum velis, Carolina f Choose which view you will, but excepting you
see double, you cannot well see both.

FERocroUs DEALER. “Now, if any man wrill tell me that that's a Copy, I'll—
I'll knock him down /– What's your Candid Opinion ?”
AN UN SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT.
Attestics is really due to the suijºined extract from the Times'
money-article:–
“It is ul.derstood that Mr. Gr. At stox F has abandºned his attempt to extract
double Incouie Tax from the hºlders of Indian securities. Among the commercial
public there has from the first been but one p 1, on as to the character of the pro-
ceeding, and it has always teen reported that SIR CHARLEs Wood and the Indian
‘...; were equally cºnvinced of its in prºpriety. The holders, however, were
forced to the annoyance and expense ºf taking measures to assert their rights, and
it was only then that the Government found it Lecessary to ascertain their legal
standing.”
“Hang a man first, and ºry him aferwards” is a maxim which, with
analogical exacºness, MR GLAosios e i as observed in dealing with the
lndian Stºck no Jers. “ Ex' ract your tax from people first, and then
ascertain iſ they are liable to pay it." The parallel runs closely on all
fours li turns out that ind an Stockholders are not liable to pay double
Income. Tax; so that nose who have had to pay it have heen—we won't
say what. We do not wish to use a hard word. The Times goes on to
announce that:—
“According to a notice from the Inland Revenue Office, it now appears that the
opinion both of the Attorney and Solicitor General is, that the double tax cannot be
enforced, and the claim has been accordingly given up. The amounts already
deducted will, of course, have to be refunded.”
We have often remarked that, whereas the CHANCELLOR of THE
Fxchequer is continually acknowledging the receipt of Conscience
Money from “X, Y, Z.,” “Neddy Bray,” “A. S.S,” and other simple-
tons, you never find anybody who has been overcharged for Income-Tax
or assessed, or other taxes, acknowledging the receipt of any conscience-
money from the CHANCELLOR of The ExcaequER. Now at last, how-
ever, he is forced to refund. The amount to be returned will not be
conscience-money, !". The CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequen
disgorges; but only under pressure...What sort of an example is that
to set HER MAJESTY's subjects? Will the queasiest of consciences
of the most scrupulous people give up any more conscience-money to
such a performer of restitution?

TWO FEATURES ROLLED INTO ONE.
A City Gent, praising a lady for her beauty, said, in
a burst of rapture, “Oh! she's got such a nasal eye l’”
Every one was astonished, and upon questions bein
asked as to what a “nasal rye’ was like, our friend poin
to a lady present, who, he said, had eyes something like
his beauty in question. The tru: h then flashed out. It
was "a hazel eye” the City Gent had meant to say. For
the life of him, he could not see what there was to laugh
at, because he had said a lady had “a nasal eye.” He got
quite angry, and left the room, which was a great relief to
every one present, as his absence enabled all the guests to
join in one unanimous loud guffaw.
Serve Them Right.
We learn that three young gentlemen of most respect-
able connections have, as we hºus, deservedly been cut by
their best friends, for the heinous sin of having when the
snow was lying on it, tried to uake out that the Isle of
Dogs was like the Isle of White.
CHANCE Llor of THE Exch Equr R. For, although, in the former of
those ministerial capacities, he would not exactly have it in his power
to cause the execution of prisoners to precede their trial, he might,
nevertheless, in the case of a petition to the Crown against a question-
able conviction and sentence of death, advise his Sovereign first to
order the sentence to be carried out, and then to examine the grounds
of the appeal.
Wasting Powder.
OUR Edinburgh friends have decided on letting a cannon be fired
from the Castle every day at. XII, in order that Auld Reekie may be
aware of the exact time. This seems to us needless, we had an idea
that a Scotsman always “knows what's o'clock.”
& IN our Number of November 10, 1860, and under the heading.
“Type or 1 h E M EDICAL Rogue,” we quoted a few lines from a letter
which appeared in the columns of our estimable contemporary the
Morning Post, and used them as a text upon which to make some
general observations of our own. In the Morning Post, and therefore
necessarily in Punch, a blank was left for the name of the individual
referred to.
In a communication which we have received since our last Number
went to press, we are for the first time assured authoritatively on
behalf of a gentleman who insists that the blank left by our contem-
porary was intended for his name, that he has contradicted in the
Morwing Post the statement which we quoted. We are also informed
that the Lancet has repeatedly, in articles on the subject, established
the honourable character of is conduct in the matter. We think it,
due to the gentleman who complains of our article to give the
same publicity to the contradiction that we gave to the quotation
and to add that, as our observations were ap É. to the conduct
described in the contradicted statement, they fall with the statement,
so far as he is concerned. We printed no name at the time, and
abstain from doing so now. It can answer no purpose to give the
name to those who have not identified the blank with an individual,
and to those who have, if there are any, our remarks will be as
for the University of Oxford is not HoME SecretaRY instead of 1 intelligible as if we gave the name at length.

MAKING THE MOST OF IT.
In common, he supposes, with most rightminded people, Mr. Punch
has seen with pleasure the columns upon columns of alms-giving an-
nouncements with which, for the last two months, the Times has daily
furnished us. , Mr. Punch has no intention to check the flow of charity,
even though the frost which started it has ended. But certain of the
donors whose names have been announced have occupied a space so
disproportioned to their gifts, that a gentle hint seems needful to
prevent this needless waste of our contemporary's space. In too many
subscription lists which lately have been advertised half a dozen lines
or more have been taken up by what should have been put in only one.
If for instance MR. Jones, with his family and servants subscribed a
five pound note, the gift has been paraded to the universe as follows:—

Total £5 0 0
A few sovereigns in this way may be hammered out to cover much
valuable space, and as charitable advertisements of course have to be
paid for, this process of gold-beating becomes a rather costly one, and
entrenches somewhat heavily upon the funds that are in hand. Mr.
Punch, who has no sympathy with snobbism or E.; would suggest
that in a case like that of MR. Jones publicity should merely be allowed
to the sum total, and that the items of subscription should, as needless,
be tºº. True Charity, we are told, vaunteth not itself, is not
puffed up; and when charity is given with a great flourish of trumpets,
it ceases to be charity, and becomes a mere advertisement.

WOL. XL, H
ANGLO-ITALIAN COPYRIGHT.
The treaty between England and Sardinia, referred, to in the
QUEEN's Speech, provides for the reciprocal security, in both countries,
of “copyright on !. dramatic works, musical compositions, draw-
ings, paintings, sculpture, engravings, lithography, and any other
works whatsoever of literature and the fine arts.” This new inter-
national treaty is a most important arrangement, especially if Sardinia
is to involve United Italy. #. Italians, if good care were not taken
to restrain their piratical propensities, would very soon plagiarise our
works of art, and particularly our sculptures. As regards the latter,
the mischief, probably, has already been done; and we are now only
shutting the stable-door after the steed has been stolen. This obser-
vation especially relates to our “...i. statues of GeoRGE THE THIRD
with his pigtail, GeoRGE THE FourTH riding his horse to drink, and
the Duke of WeLLINGTON on the º of BURton's Arch. In all these
cases not only the horses, but also the riders, have most likely been
stolen by Italian copiers of British ideas. The fine statue of JENNER
sitting in his sheet, going to be shaved, and the contiguous sculpture
which represents SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, the conqueror of Scinde, with
a ramrod seemingly driven down his back, as well as that other work
of truly high art, NELson on the top of the column hard by, have
doubtless been seized upon by some of the imitative countrymen of
Michael Angelo and BENyENUTQ CELLINI, and put forth as designs
of their own. Of course they will appropriate, the Crimean trophy,
cannons and all. We should not be at all surprised to...hear, that the
Pope has got Gog and MAGog at the Vatican; fac-similes, that is to
say, of Gog and MAgog, but which his Holiness verily believes to be
the originals of our City Giants. - -
There is another great work of ours, which the Italians are endea-
vouring to imitate, and are welcome to do so, if they can. That is the
British Constitution. We shall not claim copyright in that conception;
though, if the Italian people succeed in constructing areal resemblance
to our form of Government, we expect they will standsomething hand-
some. Like their own Rome, our grand political edifice was not built
in a day; but now the Italian architects have got our model tº work
from, it is to be hoped that they will be able to run up the building in
a few months.

Victoria ascended her
throne and delivered her Speech. This will be known in history as the
Colloquial Speech. It was so termed by the EARL of DERBY in the sub-
sequent debate on the Address; but what would that classical peer and
translator of HoRace have said, if he had seen the original draught of the
document, as prepared by the Bottleholder. This was colloquial, if
you like. The PRINCE Consort was kind enough to send it, on to
Mr. Punch, simply in order to amuse the latter Field, Marshal; but it
is really such a specimen of PAIMERSTON's free-and-easy-ism that it
must be embalmed for the Ages. This was PALMERSTON's composition:

My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
Here we all are again; and how do you do to-morrow?
All is serene, as far as I can see, and I hope the moderation of foreign
parties will keep things so. Talking of moderation, what a bore those
moderator lamps are to make burn properly. I wish somebody would
invent a good lamp.
The Italians are going it, are they not ? However, that’s neither
your business nor mine. Let them settle their affairs their own way.
If you want to see what John NY Russell has been writing about it,
he has my orders to give you the papers.
It was necessary, of course, to stop that shocking work in Syria, and
as Louis NAPOLEoN happened to have soldiers handy (he always has)
I and the other four Powers agreed that he should send some of them
to help the Sultan to put down the savages. The French troops, you
understand, represent all of us. I hope that all will be set straight.
We have given it to the Chinese, and taken Pekin, so that b isiness
is done. There's a Blue Book for you full of the particulars, but I
fancy you know all about them already.
India is improving, except in the £ s. d. line, but we’ll trust that
will come right in time.
Those tattooed parties, the New Zealanders, have been making a
shindy, but it is to be hoped that they will be put down and kept down.
I am sorry to say that stars are falling from the flag of America. The
Yankees are our cousins and our customers, and I do trust that they will
make up matters somehow. They were so very kind to my eldest boy
when he went over the Union, that I am doubly vexed at their being
in trouble. -
The Canadians and the other North Americans were also remarkably
attentive to Edward, and his papa and myself are exceedingly obliged
to them. Let me call your attention to the elegant beard of the DUKE
or NewcasTLE, grown by that nobleman in compliment to his charge,
my Heir.
MR. CoBDEN has been settling the schedules of the French Treaty,
and is I hope all the better for his trip to Algiers.
I don't suppose my friend VICTOR EMMANUEL often opens a book,
which makes it the more civil in him to have executed a copyright
treaty with me. So my poets must not “annex” the libretti of Italian
operas any more, but must invent nonsense for themselves, a task to
which I am happy to think them quite adequate.
GENTLEMEN OF THE House of CoMMONs,
The Estimates have been framed with—what are you laughing
at P Well, MR. GLADSTONE says they have, and he and “my dear
MR. CRAUFURD” must settle it between them.
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
There will be laid before you measures for the consolidation of
the Criminal Law, for improving the Law of Bankruptcy, for making
it easier to sell your Land, and for making a system of uniform Rating,
whatever that is, and also measures for Reform of — (what is John
Russell crying about?) for Reform of several things requiring it.
I am sure you will do what is right, and I leave matters in your
hands with perfect confidence, I’m sure. &c., &c.
Now this was a speech which Lord DERBy might well have called
Colloquial. Of course it would not do, and a steadier hand with a
little more of the penny-a-lining faculty, had to put the above topics
into decorous language, which was delivered by HER MAJESTY with
her accustomed grace of diction. The only other point which marked
the opening of the Session was, that the Crinolines of the Peeresses and
their girls nearly broke the heart of the respected official who had to
make room for six ladies where there was really space for only two, and
to see the pretty occupants in possession smile in the kindest way at
his prayers, but never attempt to stir, was delightful. Mr. Punch, who
has always defended Crinoline, asks with indignation why the House
of Lords is not made larger?.. But as it is coming down, having been
built, it seems, of the wrong Dolomite, he suggests that the new house
be made of vulcanised India-rubber, so that it may be stretched out to
decent proportions when ladies are “ſº and allowed to collapse
when wanted for ordinary purposes. He hopes that there is nothing
nt to the Constitution, and indeed he thinks the pro-
pºsal, strict { in conformity, with, Magna Charta, which , says that
‘justice shall be denied to nobody,” and it is clearly denying justice
§ * when you do not give her room to do justice to her beautiful
Clotiles.
Both Houses, of course, held debates on the Address. A couple of
Lords Lieutenant, LoRD SEFTON, formerly a fº. and LoRD
LISMORE, an O'Callaghan of Shanbally, moved and seconded. The
exºgrenadier's maiden speech was neat enough, but the Shanbally party
could not be heard., Then the LoRD or DERby made a long, smart
oration, in which he called the Speech, “unexceptionable,” and of
course proceeded to pick it to pieces, terming it colloquial, as aforesaid,
and otherwise faulty, praising it, however, for its want of “ambition,”
which meant its omission of mention of a Reform Bill. He was sorry
that the QUEEN had not been asked to say something about the recent
distresses, and of the charity they had evoked, and while compassion-
ating such of the working class as could not save money, rebuked those
wh9, earning more than, clerks and others in a higher station, spent
their wages in drink and idleness and had nothing for a rainy day. He
wished to hear something about finance, but his chief demand was for
an exposition of our real relations with NAPOLEON. Also he thought
that FRANCIs THE Second had had hard measure dealt out to him.
He was not opposed to Italian unity, if it could be effected, but he
wished to hear Ministers on the subject. After some sarcasms directed
at LoRD John RussBLL for his despatches on the Italian question,
and a fairer scoff at the murky mystification of the speech of the
EMPEROR OF THE FREnch, LoRD DERBY, was happy to announce
that he did not mean to move any amendment to the Address in
answer to the unexceptionable and colloquial Speech. LoRD GRAN-
ville in reply was equally happy to perceive from, LoRD, DERBY's
vigour and humour that he had quite recovered from the gout, assured
the other Earl that the Speech said everything that it...ought to say,
and no more, and by way of reply to the invitation to dilate on foreign
§: delivered a graceful eulogium on the late, Lord ABERDEEN,
he Peers, having had chaff enough, voted the Address, and departed
exactly in comfortable time to get home to eight o'clock dinners.
In the Commons the Address was moved and seconded by Deputy
Lieutenants SIR THoMAs Cole BRooke and MR. Charles PAGEt,
hereby immortalised, sans phrase. Then, MR. JAMES WHITE, of
Brighton, thought it necessary to make a display of cackling patriotism.
He complained that the QUEEN had not been made to scold the Lords
for refusing, last year, to abolish the paper duty, he complained that
the national expenditure was extravagant, and he complained that
there was no mention of a Reform Bill. On the last point he moved
an amendment to the address. Another shining light of the same
order, MR. DIGBY SEYMoUR, seconded him, and next day had his
pocket picked and his watch taken in Westminster Hall, which trial
may we hope be blessed to him. MR. DisBAELI then had a good deal
to say, approved the omission of Reform, but declared that the mind
of the country was much “bewildered” in reference to the condition

of affairs and the policy of the Government. He predicted that the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, would make an alliance with Italy and
come forth as the Head of the Latin Race: . And he walked into LoRD
John about his despatches, and accused him of misquoting WATTEL.
It seems that the Leaders of Opposition do not agree about Italy,
LoRD DERBy seeing no objection to the Unity, and MR. DISRAELI
seeing a very great objection to it, in the shape of Louis NAPOLEON
at the head of a Million of Armed Men. LoRD John RusseIL recom-
mended MR. DisRAELI to get rid of his own personal bewilderment by
reading the º on the table, defended himself and his despatches,
declaring that his first had not been intended for publication, and as
to Unity, said that it was not a scheme of the Government's, but that
the Italians must do as they liked...As for Reform, he did not believe
that he could carry any, but a trifling measure until public opinion
should demand a larger bill. . The Country was Quite Dead on the
subject. MR. BRIGHT utterly denied this, mourned over the back-
slidings of the Cabinet, and having shown in a very lucid manner that
almost any decent person could by industry and resolution acquire the
franchise, denounced those who declined to *: up a disturbance in
order to confer the vote on those who would not take the pains to
deserve it. And, by way of a novelty, the amendment was pressed to
a division,
And JIMMY WHITE and Johnny BRIGHT took what low folk call nir,
By a motion on a motion which was shared by Forty-Six,
hile all the Whigs and Tories went together, hand-in-hand,
And “One-Two-Nine for Ministers” out-shouted HENRY BRAND.
So ended the first night of the Session of 1861.
Wednesday. MR. SEYMoUR FitzGERALD made a smart speech on
Foreign Affairs, pitching into LoRD, John Russell, and the latter
made a still smarter one in reply, ending with the expression of his
Lordship's belief that we are not on the eve of dangers, a truly satis-
factory assurance.
Thursday. The Address was presented, and this was HER MAJESTY's
Reply:—
I think your Address is both loyal and dutiful,
Its syntax correct, and its sentiments beautiful;
And I’m sure you’ll all give the best con-si-de-ra-tion
To the Bills you discuss for the good of the nation.
In the Commons, MR. MILNER GIBson said that Government had
considered the frequency of Railway. Accidents, and meant to let the

alterations in the way the Old Lady in Threadneedle Street deals with
our money; and SIR. G.C.L.Ewis, introduced the Rating Bill, which
is not a Rating Bill at all, but a Bill for improving the mode in which
assessments are made and collected—evidently PAM, in writing the
Speech, had not the slighest idea of what he was promising. He was
much more at home in his Speech, to-night, for a Committee to inquire
whether the House would not get º: business better by omit-

of subjects were brought up, but the only point Mr. Punch intends to
mention was LORD JoHN Russell's statement, in reference to the

Bishops in Syria, how many of the 8000 adult males in the district of
the atrocities #. to be put to death in revenge for the slaughter,
the Christian Bishops unanimously demanded the lives of 4,600 men,
and it was as much as the Mahommedans could do to get the
Christians to consent to be satisfied with the blood of 1,200 men, which
was the lowest terms they would take. A Select Committee on the
Poor Laws was granted—a natural result of the exhibitions of blun-
dering by Relieving Officers, and the like, during the recent distresses.

prayer of the petition above quoted, be able to sue that departed nobleman. It will be impos-
sible for them to bring him to book, unless they bring him to a primer, and, by the inter-
yention of a medium and help of a table, get him to rap out his answer to the charge of
fraud by the alphabet. But even if they should succeed in inducing him to rap out, they
will never manage to compel him to fork out. They will, therefore, have to grin and bear
the loss of property which the petition seeks to have inflicted on them by the Legislature.

PUNC1L, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“HAVE you seen Timour the Tartar * or TIMUR the Tatar, as
we have lately learned to call him, though it hardly sounds respect
to s of the great Khan of Tartary merely as a Tatar Khan. I
you have not, take my advice and a fourwheel cab, and go; it won't do
these windy nights to ride about in Hansoms. I spent a pleasant hour
and a quarter at his court the other evening, after an agreeable prelude
of Old Trusty. (By the way, what has come to MR. Appison of late?
I used to fancy him at one time only fit for “heavy fathers,” and the
like conventionalities. But every time I see him now, he shows me
something new and fresh, and anything but stagy. His acting in this
piece has a quiet truth about it which I the more commend, as the
part is badly written and tempts to over-acting.)
“Sportsmen when well mounted hope for a long run, and if Tºnour
ails to have one it is no fault of the mounting. The piece is as well put
on the stage as an author can desire, and leaves nothing to be wished
for in the way of decoration. If the ballet guards were trained to
march a little, more in time, the public, would perhaps be more
applausive of their movements. At present when at drill they are a
rather awkward squad, although their looks and legs are by nature not
ungainly. But this is a slight blot, and in general the “effects’ cannot
well be more effective. The last scene is as pretty as any I have seen;
and, unlike the tedious "Tranformation’ businesses, has to me the
eat advantage that it does not tire one's patience by a bit-by-bit
evelopment.
“You may fancy, from my mention of these scenic merits first, that
the authorship and acting are but secondary matters. This I know has
been the ſashion at some theatres of late, but I am glad to say has not
now proved the case at the Olympic. ... I don’t think Timour was knocked
off in a couple of nights’ work, with the assistance of strong tea, and
may be something a whit stronger. I have heard of burlesques being
rattled off in this way, a rough sketch being first made for the guidance
of the scene-painters, and the ‘words” served out perhaps on the morn-
ing of performance. But I don’t think Timour bears the stamp of this
fast school, for it seems written with more care than can be given at
such high-pressure. The plot is, certainly not interesting, nor yet the
most intelligible. But after all, who looks for skilful plot in a burlesque f
One might as well expect the taste of port in a potato. There are lots
of pleasant puns and pleasant parodies in Timour, but the writing
is not so “smart’, as to become, a painful matter to you. , That
new kind of verbal torture whereby a string of senseless words are
made to sound like one, is to my old-fashioned mind a most excruciating
torment; and I confess that I hate pieces which are stuffed so full of
puns that one's ears are sure to ache with being stretched to catch them.
“The acting is generally speaking good; but I must, say that Miss
KEELEY_deserves a special word of praise for her distinct articu-
lation. , I never heard her Mother's equal for making a joke tell, and I
am glad to find the daughter echo, that clear utterance. Her singing,
too, is nice (though not always in tune), and there is a lively sprightli-
ness about her which makes you fancy that her work is more a pleasure
than a labour to her, and that she herself enjoys the fun as much as
you do. I like to see good humour have fair vent upon the stage, pro-
vided that it does not assume the form of "gagging.” Gags I hold in
horror and detestation, and I honestly confess I am surprised that
Timour should have stooped to them. I can understand that actors
who can’t play without applause, and who know they have not clever-
ness enough to win it fairly, should have recourse to claptrap as a
means to get a clap, and should try to make buffoonery pass current
for good acting; but Timour is º by one who is ranked as our
best actor of burlesque, and who should feel ashamed to descend to
gagging. Had Tºnour been a dull and heavily-written part, there might
perhaps have been some shadow of excuse for him; but this is not the
case. In all other respects Tºmour is admirably played by MR. Robson.
“I have been working hard in the dramatic way this week, and have
looked in at both the Operas, besides my glance at the Olympic.
BALFe was the composer who catered in each case, and I had the
opportunity of comparing with his most recent one of his earliest pro-
ductions. But that Bianca does not seem of such good promise for
the barrel-organs, I should incline to rank it below the other work.
There is, however, certainly great virtue in this, but.'. There is
nothing in Bianca that I need fear will haunt me, like the “dreaming
that I dwelt,” in the ballady Bohémienne. By the bye, the last libretto
is not a vast advance upon the poetry of BUNN. I could point out
many a passage nearly equal in absurdity to the "hollow hearts” that
‘wear a mask,” in the old piece.
“The Pantomimes at these great houses are worthy of small notice.
Anomalous as it may sound, I must confess that, PAYNE is always sure
to give me pleasure, and Í have this year had much entertainment
from Remorse. I rejoice to see the son treading pantomimically on his
father's heels; and if spirits, be permitted, as some say, to walk the
earth, I hope I never may be haunted by a less facetious demon. But,
with these exceptions. the Pantomime in Bow Street was as dull as
f|Pantaloon to chalk
the Police Court, and, spite of the new-fangled introduction of three
clowns (all good), the so-called ‘comic business’ was insufferably dreary

IMPERIAL ASSURANCE.
In politics-to say it much I grieve—
The world, albeit in the face of facts'
Inexorable logic, won't believe
In totally disinterested acts.
All I can : is, that Savoy and Nice
Irrevocably are rejoined to France; ,
So now let Commerce calculate on peace, \
Take a new start, assured no war will chance.
To aid a just cause, France may draw the sword
Quite without thought—save afterthought-of gain,
Whereof events occasion may afford; .
New provinces, for instance, to obtain.
To vindicate her honour, if 'tis hurt
France too may fight, but not with farther aim,
Except her will and pleasure to assert,
And generous ideas to proclaim.
With forty millions, France can threats despise,
Armed to the teeth by sea as well as land,
Yet she inspires mistrust, to my surprise
Suspicion, which I cannot understand!
Her army is invincible, all know,
Invulnerable is her iron fleet.
Then who to war with her will idly go,
With the dead certainty of being beat P
Come, therefore, drooping Confidence, revive,
Cheer up dull Business; clear thy cloudy brow.
Now languid Speculation, look alive.
Take courage Capital, and fear no row.
Secure in strength, France feels herself at ease,
For none her enmity will dare provoke;
Europe must let her do what she may please:
Then European concord won't be broke.
A HOP AT THE HOLY SEE.
According to the Roman Correspondent of the Post:—
“In Rome the last novelty was the English Bachelor's Ball, which brilliant event
took place last night in the club rooms, and was attended by the flower of the
British and Foreign Society here, as well as GENERAL DE Goyon, the Duke of
GRAMont, and the principal part of the corps diplomatique."
Rome must be just the place for a Bachelors' Ball. It abounds in
priests, who are all necessarily bachelors. The only defect that could
vitiate such a ball would be the absence of the fair sex; for the Roman
Clergy are vowed to single blessedness, and few ladies will willingly
dance with men whom they cannot possibly marry. But there would
be no want of petticoats at a bachelors' ball attended by numerous
members of the Priesthood, if those reverend gentlemen appeared in
full pontificals. The flower of society might be partly composed of
members of monastic societies, some of whom might choose to be wall-
flowers. Would not the Cardinals, as many as might be present, make
a brilliant display of millinery and, muslin? §§ all the girls who
chanced to be in the ball-room would be charmed with their Eminences'
pretty red round hats! They would also admire the display of scarlet
stockings, which might be rendered the more effective by the judicious
employment of Crinoline., DE, MERODE. might serve ANToNELll as
partner in a polka. The Pope himself, if he wears white satin shoes,
might as º, and might lead off the Ball in a quadrille, such as
would be sanctioned by M.R., SPURGEON, except that our popular
Protestant preacher would probably wish all the gentlemento appear in
male costume, and none of them attired like females. Dancing might
benefit his Holiness, who is said to be too fat, by reducing his
corpulence.

home dress this winter, and it is now made in such rich
and elegant designs, that it may rank next to velvet.”

droguet is the fashionable word for drugget,
which material, howsoever unaccustomed they
may be to housekeeping, they will at least know
to be commonly used for the saving of carpets.
| The idea that, drugget is in great request for
home dress will diminish the horror with which
- they contemplate the danger of incurring milli-
→ ners' bills, inseparable, from matrimony. They

it will soon become in equally great request for
evening dress; for that, being made in such rich
and varied designs that it may rank next to vel-

and be adopted by ladies as a substitute for that

pensive. have a whole family of grown-up
daughters, and their collective dresses amount

AN AMERICAN CABINET MINISTER.
(PAINTED BY HIMSELF.)
MR. John BRIGHT tells us to take United States institutions for our
model. Does he extend the recommendation to United States Cabinet
Ministers ?. Ought LoRD HERBERT of LEA, for instance, to accept as
his model MR. Floyd, the late Secretary of War in MR. Buchan AN's
administration?
MR, FLOYD has seceded from that administration, and has given to
his fellow-citizens in Virginia an account of his stewardship. His
speech is a remarkable document, as showing us how far American
statesmen have gone in improving upon our old-fashioned notions of
truth, honour and patriotism.
He began his discourse with an eulogium on that great and blessed
thing—Slavery:—
“God in his commandments wrote with his own fingers upon Mount Sinai, ‘Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's slave;" and if these fanatics will deal with this sub-
i. in a religious aspect, I would have them remember that the first slave-catcher
n the history of the world was an angel of God, sent by God to take a runaway
slave-a negro-and bring him back to his master.”
The allusion we presume (in º: of the gender) is to the case of
HAGAR, as recorded in the 16th Chapter of Genesis, though we cannot
find anything there of the angel taking the runaway; nor were we
aware till now, that HAgaR was a negress.
The contemplation of the subject of slavery is almost too much for
MR. FLOYD. Lifted into enthusiasm he continues:—
“Oh 1 it is a hallowed institution, and it seems that in the Providence of God it
came down through the new dispensation to be preserved and perpetuated in con-
formity with the will of Divine Providence.”
But MR. Floyd is at least consistent with himself. , Having dis-
covered that slavery is a “hallowed institution,” it is not to be
wondered at that he should have made the discovery that “treason” is
synonymous with º
He is a modest man, however, and owns that he only rose to his con-
ception of duty by degrees. When he ſound himself Secretary at War
“by accident—beyond either his merits, wishes, or aspirations,” he
laboured, he tells us, “to understand the power of the position and its
responsibilities.”
* I soon found that it was full of significance, that it was an armed power for good,
and armed with immense power for evil Whilst your men were aspiring for the
Presidency, and whilst I was the subject of vituperation and abuse which I never
answered, I undertook so to dispose of the power in my bands that when the tor-
ific hour came, you, and all of you, and of you, should say this man has done
his duty.”
And, what was MR. Floyd's duty, according to his latest light on
the subject? Simply to transfer the arms and ammunition of the
Federal Government to the forts and arsenals of the States he knew to
be on the verge of secession—in order that they might be armed for
resistance to the Federal forces. -
MR. Floyd asks pardon for “the egotism” of his avowal. He saw
what was at hand:—
“I saw a fissure in the iceberg coming. I knew there was no power between
heaven and earth that could divert it. I understood as I understand this moment,
that as it had split everything in its path, it was destined to split the administration
of the United States. I .#
Even the PRESIDENT—easy man as he is—suspected what MR.
FLOYD's strong sense of duty was leading him to:—
“The PRESIDENT said to me—and I thought I never saw him in my life look so
much like what comes up to my idea of a PREsident of the United States as he
looked that evening—he said, “Mr. Floyd, are you going to send recruits to
Charleston to strengthen the forts? What about sending reinforcements to Charles-
ton "I was taken very much by surprise to find the PRESIDENT making this inquiry,
indicating, to my mind, a change of policy on his part. I said, "Mr. PREs, DENT,
nothing about sending recruits to Charleston.’ ‘Don't you," said he, “intend to
strengthen the forts at Charleston ?’ ‘I do not intend to strengthen the forts at
Charleston." Says he, “Mr. Floyd, I would rather be in the bottom of the Potomac
to-morrow than that these forts should fall into the hands of those who intend to take
them. It will destroy me, Sir.’ And, said he, “Mr. Floyd, if that thing occurs it
will cover your name—and it is an honourable name, Sir-with an infamy that all
time can never efface, because it is in vain that you will attempt to show that you
have not some complicity in handing over these forts to those who take them.'"
It seems, therefore, that at this time the PREsident's notions of
“duty” slightly differed from MR. Floyd's. The act that MR, Flord
is so proud of is one, according to MR. BUCHANAN, “that will cover
his name with an infamy that all time can never efface.”
GENERAL CAss, too, took the same perverted view of “duty” as the
PRESIDENT. He was for strengthening the Southern Forts.
“He said there must be force, and there shall be force.”
In the interval between his first and second interview with Mr.
FLOYD, however, the PRESIDENT seems to come round, rather, to the
Floyd view of "duty.” “ He never looked so like a President” as
when he told MR. Fioyd that “his conduct would cover his name with
everlasting infamy;” but after he had changed his mind on this point,
it was—
“With a beautifu. countenance and with a heroic decision that I shall never
forget[that he replied to GENERAL Cass] in the Council Chamber, “I have considered
this question. I am sorry to differ from the Secretary of STATE-I have made up
my mind. The interests of the country do not demand a reinforcement of the forces in
Charleston. I cannot do it—I will not do it—and I take the responsibility of it
upon myself.' That is what he said, and the next day this glorious old PREMIER
sent in his resignation. Then gentlemen, I clapped my hands again. I was sorry
to part from him, God knows, because he had done what has seldom been done, he
has inspired during four years a feeling of affection in my heart; but when he left,
. not help cocking my eye and saying, “God speed you, old man, to the
orth.’”
To have inspired a feeling of affection in MR. Florid's heart for

four years, was, indeed, no common feat, and well deserved the compli-
ment which it extorted from Mr. Floyd of a "cock of his eye,” and a
* God speed to the North.” - -
We have taken no liberties with MR. Floyd's noble revelation. We
have ventured on no comment. Such virtue deserves, surely, if ever
virtue did, to be “its own reward.” -
And this is a Cabinet Minister of the United States! Let LORD
PALMERston and LoRD John Russell, the DUKE of SoMERSET and
LoRD HERBERT look on this picture and blush for their own miserable
inferiority. -
Let the benighted Britisher learn from MR FLQYD what slavery is,
and what duty is, and store up the lesson against the time when John
BULL acknowledges JonATHAN as an example, exports and wollops his
own, nigger, repudiates his debts, betrays his public trust, and after a
touch of pardonable egotism in proclaiming what he has done, lies down
with the proud consciousness that, whatever comes of it, “ thank God,
he has done his duty!”
THE CLASSICS OF THE COUNTER.
“My DEAR MR. PUNCH, “Chrysanthemum Cottage, Friday.
“As CHARLEs has always taken in your interesting paper, and
we regularly read every single word of it, of course I saw your article
the other day upon Shop-Slang, which, I really thought most capital,
only Imust confess there was a good deal in it that I didn't understand;
but I’m sure you would have liked to see how CHARLEs enjoyed it,
though I don't think that he need have laughed at me so much for not
knowing what a “slap-up kicksies builder’ is, and for asking him to
tell me the meaning of such words as ‘trotter case” and ‘maroleys.”
However, he has promised that “some time or other, when he has
nothing better to do' (now, do you think SIR CREsswell would allow
such #º, implying as it does that CHARLEs actually thinks he
can have something better to do than attend to the behests of me, his
lawful wedded wife? because if * do, I think that there's no use in
the Divorce Court 1) CHARLEs, I say, has promised to instruct me in
thieves' Latin, in which he says the words that puzzled me are written,
and to help me to translate it into proper ladies’ English.
“But what I wanted to say was (and as I’m a constant reader please
to let me say it publicly, for # do so long to see myself in ...} that
there’s a most enormous deal of ºf talked in the ºf: besides
what you have shown to be occasionally written there. declare i
never go into a dressmaker's or draper's without hearing an immense

positively dreadful what bad language they use, .# as #: do
whether one would like to ‘ave the pints just taken horſ,' and telling
their assistants to “go and eat them hirons. But this is merely mis:
pronouncing, more than actual slang, and after all is not so odious and
offensive in my ears as the “any other harticle’ of the obsequious
shopman, and the thousand other vulgarisms which equally are current,
One º hears the word “thing” nowadays in shops, unless indeed
it have an adjective before it. A “sweet thing in muslins, Mem,” is
no uncommon phrase, but generally º the word used is always
“harticle.” Then, as your Correspondent,...MR. EASEL, justly noticed,
nowadays a shop is never called a shop. The young men in it always
term it their “establishment.” “Wimporium' and “mart’ are also
synonyms in vogue, but art ... used in speaking so much as in
advertisements.
“This fashion of declining vo. ca 1 a spade a spade, or to term a
business by any briefer phrase than ‘commercial undertaking,' has run
riot in a number of ridiculous respects, whereof the slang words in
shop-Latin are some of the most ludicrous. Do you think a shirt sells
better because christened an “Eureka,” or are boots more bought if
advertised as being ‘Antigropelos?' I wonder how many men who
purchase an ‘aquascutum' overcoat are tempted so to do because of
the queer name of it, or have the least notion what that queer name
really means. As for myself, of course a lady is not expected to know
Latin, and I remember when CHARLEs took me to see the Westminster
Play, and I asked what made him laugh so, he shook his head and put
his finger to his lips, and whispered something about ancient jokes not
being meant for ladies, and I heard him tell, old ToMKINs what a good
thing it was women didn't understand the classics. So of course
whenever now I see a long hard, Latin word, and Charles seems
puzzled to translate it for me, I can't help fancying it means something
dreadfully improper. There, the other day I showed him an advertise-
ment I saw of an “Idrotobolic” hat which some rare genius had in-
vented; and as he seemed to hesitate in saying that it merely nic art a
nice light sort of hat that wouldn't give aheadache, of course I naturally
suspected it meant, nothing of the kind, and of course I shan't rest
satisfied until I find out what it does mean.
“Now, maybe words like these are well enough for men (though
I'll bet a pair of gloves that not a quarter of you scholars really under-
stand them); but it really is, too had that we poor women should be
bothered with them, just as if we hadn't enough other things to worry
us. and I’m sure that what with bad cooks, shirt-buttons, and bachelor
acquaintances, who are always certain to º in upon cold mutton
days, the life of a young “Missus,’ as one's called, is full of troubles,
and the married state is much more of a bed of thorns than roses.
“I have plenty more to say about the classics of the counter, for I’ve
no patience with the creatures, and haven't yet half done with their
ridiculous absurdities; but Čiaries has just sent up to say the
dioropha's at the door, and we are going to the Pantechnicon to look at
some Kamptulicon, and after that he wants to get himself a new bit of

he means to ask whether so classical a cognomen is likely to impart a
Grecian flavour to potatoes!

A FEW SIMPLE REASONS AGAINST SMOKING.
(Principally addressed to SIR BENJAMIN BRODIE, in answer to his Letter
on that abominable practice.)
By THE MOTHER of A LARGE FAMILY, AND THE widow of THREE
HUSBANDs, who ALL smoked.
1. Because it injures the curtains.
2. Because it is injurious to the furniture generally.
3. Because it is not agreeable to breakfast in #. room when the
gentlemen have been smoking overnight.
4. Because no man's temper is the better for it the next morning.
5. Because it keeps persons up to late hours, when every respectable
person ought to be in bed.
6. Because the smell haunts a man's clothes, and his beard, and his
hair, and his whiskers, and his whole body, for days afterwards—so
much so that it is positively uncomfortable sometimes to go near him.
7. Because it is a selfish gratification that not only injures those
who partake of it, but has the further effect of driving the ladies out
of the room. . .
. 8. Because it is, also, an expensive habit which the ladies, not par-
ticipating in its so called enjoyments, cannot possibly have the smallest
sympathy with or appreciation for.
9. Because it has the further effect of making gentlemen drink a
º deal more than they otherwise would, and so weakens their purses
esides ruining their constitutions, to say nothing of the many comforts
and new dresses that their dear wives and children may have been un-
justly deprived of, supposing the same amount of money had only
een judiciously laid out at home.
10. Because it gives extra trouble to the servants who have to clean
and to ventilate the room the next morning.
ll. Because how are one's daughters to get married, if the gentlemen
are always locked up in a separate room paying court to their filthy pipes
and cigars? .
12. Because it unfits a young man, who is wedded to it, for the
refining influences of female society.
13. Because it puts a stop to music, singing, flirting, and all rational
"º". - -
4. Because it is a custom originally imported from the savages.
15. Because we see the nations that smoke the most are mostly the
stupidest, heaviest, laziest, dreariest, dreamiest, most senseless, and
worthless beings that encumber-like so many weeds, only capable of
emitting so much smoke—the face of the earth. -
16. Because when a man says he is going out to smoke a cigar,
there’s no knowing what mischief he is bent upon, or the harm the
monster may be likely to get into.
17. Because it is not allowed in the Palace, or Windsor Castle, or
in any respectable establishment.
18. Because the majority of husbands only do it because they know
it is offensive to their wives.
And a thousand other good reasons, if one only had the patience to
enumerate them all. Pray did ADAM smoke P

PARLIAMENTARY ENTERTAINMENTS.
In addition to the banquets of LORDs PALMRRSTON and GRANVILLE,
and of the leaders of the Opposition, on the Opening of the Session,
several entertainments on a minor scale º: which somehow
have escaped being noticed by the press. We have therefore been
requested to supply the following details, with which we have been
furnished through a most authentic source:–
Wiscount WILLIAMs gave a grand tea and turn-out at his residence,
to which the chief of his Constituents had the honour of receiving
cards. The repast, we understand, was of a strictly frugal character;
as being in accordance with those economic principles of which the
noble Wiscount has long been the acknowledged champion in, the
House. After the refection, the guests were entertained with a long
speech from their host, setting forth his views on a variety of matters,
and : that he would not shrink from upsetting the Government,
and himself assuming office as Prime Minister, if LORD PALMERSTON
persisted in refusing to retrench.
MR. BRIGHT gave a full dress banquet the same evening, to which
the “ardent reformers” in the House were all invited. Covers were
laid for some three hundred or more, but, through some mischance or
other, the company who assembled did not exceed a dozen.
MR. AYRTON had a dinner-party at his private residence, for the
purpose of making a short speech on the occasion, that he might prove
whether his tongue was in proper working order..MR. AYRTON said
at starting that he feared so long a rest had made his powers of speech
grow rusty, but as the “few remarks” he promised extended over
nearly five hours and a half, the fears he entertained were shown to be
quite groundless.
MR. Spoon ER had invited a select circle of friends to renew his
yearly promise to make his usual fiery attack upon Maynooth, when
the Grant for it should come before the notice of the House. But it
unfortunately happened that the guests whom he invited were all
“previously engaged,” and so the worthy Member had to make his
speech in the form of a soliloquy, and to supply the “cheers” and
“hear! hears!” of an audience himself. - -
LoRD John Russellen ined a large party at his residence with
a description of how he meant to make away with his Reform baby,
and how John BRIGHT, he expected, would accuse him of the murder
of it. His Lordship said, he hoped the country would it him of
unnatural desertion, for it was mainly to oblige them he had played
the part of Brutus, and sacrificed his child, because he clearly saw the
country did not care for it. -
LAYARD, as in duty bound, gave a splendid banquet to his friend
Mr. Punch, in recognition of his services in returning LAYARD to
a seat in Parliament. -
We learn, too, that LoRD CowLEY gave a full-dress, entertainment
at his residence in Paris, to celebrate the opening of the French and
English Sessions. The hospitalities were on a more than usually grand
scale, covers being laid for no less than three persons.

THE CAMBRIDGE PRIZE POEM. -
LAst Friday was the Anniversary of the birth of GEORGE WASHINGTON, founder
of the Union which the New York Herald declares to exist no longer. PRINCE
ALBERT, as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, has given, as subject, for
the Prize Poem, The Prince of Males at the Tomb of hashington, the incident
of the 5th October last. Punch does not know whether his young friend, H. R. H.
Edward, who has just gone to Cambridge, means himself to compete for the prize,
though, as he is likely to know what his emotions upon that occasion were better
than anybody else, there seems no reason against his trying his hand. Meantime
the selection of such a subject has given great satisfaction to the Americans, an
the Herald says,
“A more graceful compliment to the United States than is here conveyed by the father of the
hoir apparent could not have been chosen. It shows that the Royal Family and people of
England look back with feelings of pleasure upon that memorable event in the New World tour of
his Royal Highness, and it must be extremely gratifying to ourselves to know that the youth and
intellect of our mother country are making it a labour of love to honour and emblazon it in song.
And it is to be hoped that under the auspices of Alma Mater something will be produced
worthy of a theme so richly teeming with the poetry of tradition and the gems of history, and
allowing such limitless scope for the glowing pictures of poetical genius."
It is to be hoped so. We shall see. Mr. Punch has no child at Cambridge,
at present, or the prize would be already on view in the window of 85, Fleet
Street, for no one would be foolish enough to contend against a son of the House
of Punch. The utmost fair play will, therefore, be given.
But Mr. Punch hardly knows whether to rejoice or to be sad that the Poet
CUPPER (author of Provertial Imbecility, &c.), although disqualified from entering
the race with younger bards, has stepped forth to show them how the thing ought
to be done. It is matter for joy that such a Poem as CUPPER's should be given
to the world; but on the other hand, its extreme .." and all but perfection
must tend to discourage all other competitors. However, here is an “early copy,”

VOLUNTEER PRIZE POEM,
PRINCE EDWARD OF WALES AT THE TOMB
OF WASHINGTON.
Auspicious moment. Banish every gloom.
No Tears to-day, although I sing a Tomb;
A Tomb on which the honour was conferred
Of homage from a child of GeoRGE THE THIRD,
I call him child, although he’s no such thing,
And the great grandson of the Farmer King.
A happy omen for VICTORIA’s son,
W begins both WALEs and WashingtoN,
And similar may both their courses be,
I overs of all that’s grand and great and free,
Yet here I would not be misunderstood,
Good are republics, monarchy is good,
And truly sorry I should be to plan
Schemes for my Prince to turn republican:
Ungrateful, surely, were such thought in me
Whose works amuse the Royal Family,
And in their gilded bindings often lie
Where they may catch the QUEEN's or Consort's eye.
I only mean this golden hope to forge: -
May EDWARD be as good a man as GEORGE |
Mount Vermon is the F. to which they brought
The Prince to show the honour which he ought.
'Twas in October that it met his view,
And that’s the month in which I always brew,
Not that I’d willingly intrude my ales
Into a poem on the PRINCE OF WALEs,
But playful º: §. from the poet’s tongue
Like those same liquids when you liſt the bung,
Drinking and thinking thus suggest the line—
That bier is Washington's and this is mine.
What Vernon is, or why it’s called a Mount,
I know not, and the fact’s of small account:
The name is dear to us, (Columbia's kith)
Who idolise the name of WERNoN SMITH ;
Then we’ve the Vernon Gallery; for my part
I love that choice collection of fine art,
And often wish that it were nearer town—
{\; Royal Prince and Consort, never frown,
know it’s only thrippence by the bus,
And did not mean the least disloyal fuss)
I love to sit and rest each weary leg,
And gaze on STANFIELD, Roberts, CREswick, EGG,
Or stand enchanted in the Vernon room
As stood the Prince before the Vernon tomb.
Upon that scene how oft must he look back,
As rapt he stood beside the Potomac,
And heard arising o'er that river's surge,
The music of the Trovatore dirge,
Played on the steamer, which as it appeared
From the reports, his Royal hand had steered,
T }. of the time, O! may the time be latel
{} en he shall steer the vessel of the State.
Nobly he spoke, as well beseemed his birth,
Then picked horse-chesnuts from the hallowed earth,
Intending, as he frankly told the folks,
To sow them here, among fair Windsor’s oaks.
And let us hope that getting back on board
In sport he shied them at no Duke or Lord,
But that the trees will spring where, every hour,
He’ll see them from the Lancasterian Tower.
Here, Muse, break off, and loyal ardour check,
Nor sing the dancing on the vessel's deck,
How Alexandria met him with a smile
É. Alexandria, reader, near the Nile),
ow Washington (the place) with salvoes rang,
Bid fly her bunting and her cannon bang, .
And tens of thousands sent up plaudits wild
In honour of Victoria’s princely child.
My strain is o'er, but oh, if I might dare,
Mid themes like these to thrust a private prayer,
'Twould be that when my Prince next voyages, he

Frederick (who, we are sorry to say, is rather fond of chaffing his Brother-in-Law) “Oh Look here, Robert, will You have this with
YoU IN THE CARRIAGE, on shALL I put IT IN to Tue WAN ?”
A BEGG-AR’S PETITION.
We are glad to hear that Glasgow has some thoughts of backsliding
in its Sabbatarian Fº and is preparing a Police. Bill by which
some necessaries of life, which have been hitherto prohibited, in future
will be suffered to be sold upon a Sunday. Ready-made provisions,
bread, and milk, and medicine; these are the sole articles to which the
suffrance is extended, and it will be provided that the sale of them be
stopped between the hours of 10 A.M. and 5 in the afternoon.
This is, after all, no such wonderful concession. But trifling as it
may be, great objections have been made to it... A leading Free Kirk
Doctor, whose name is DR. Begg, has given notice of a motion in the
Edinburgh Presbytery for a petition against the Sunday sale of food
and physic, which is sought to be obtained. A Scotch contemporary
reports of him that—
“In giving notice of his motion, Doctor Braq said that the evil [i. e of buying
necessary food] was increasing to an alarming extent in Glasgow. He was glad to
learn that the Sabbath Alliance in Edinburgh were taking action on the subject,
and had appointed a secretary, and he hoped something would be done to call
attention to the matter."
Certainly, DR. Begg. Since you beg us so to do, we willingly will
call attention to the matter. We may not do so in a manner that you
would yourself approve, for it is not our custom to write like canting
hypocrites, and to—
“Compound for sins we feel inclined to,
By damning those we have no mind to.”
But such as it is, you are quite welcome to our notice of the subject.
By the bye, Doctor, were not you the pious party who not long since
inveighed against the heinous “Sin of walking on the Sabbath,” and
petitioned that the crime might be put down by the police?. If so, we
can conceive, without much stretch of fancy, that you should loºk
upon milk selling on the Sunday as a sin. A mind that thinks it sinful
to go and take a walk, of course must see offence in the business of a
milk-walk. Nor, if buying needful food upon a Sunday be an “evil,”
can there be much less ill in buying necessary, physic: Better lose
your health than your chances of salvation. Better suffer in the flesh
than run the slightest risk of torment in the spirit. Better have sick
bodies than have sickness in our souls. Yes, assuredly, dear Doctor;
we quite agree to that. But before you hope to make us converts to
|. you must, thoroughly convince us that buying food and
physic upon Sundays is forbidden us, in the pages of that Book wherein
our duties are described.
| If we are not mistaken, there are many men in Scotland of DR,
BEGG's persuasion, who call Sunday “the Sabbath,” and think sinful
|all out-door employment on that day. Now, why, instead of troubling
the police with their petitions, could they not themselves in person
start an anti-food-and-physic-purchasing crusade, and do what the
think needful to prohibit Sunday trading. Whatever be the case wit
other purchaseable condiments, the sale of milk would specially be easy
to be checked. Were DR. Begg and some few score of his ascetic
brethren to patrol the streets of Glasgow in gangs upon a Sunday, we
feel chemically certain, that without police assistance, the mere sight of
their sour faces would suffice to spoil the milk.
SLAVERY AND MORMONISM.
“The Patriarchs of old had slaves,”
The Planter cries, “’Tis written.
Fact being so my conscience saves,
Which therefore can't be smitten.”

Come to my arms, my brother!”

TWO ENTRANCES AND TWO ExITS.
THE ENTRANCES.
THERE were two Kings, where of Italy's boot,
The foot the leg is tacked to,
The one he was a de jure King,
The other a King de facto.
Without taking count of KING WIctor,
That blade so cool and keen, oh–
GARIBALDI was this de facto King,
The de jure was BoMBALINo.
KING GARIBALDI to never a crown
Or royal robe was born,
He marched to his throne in an old red shirt,
And a pair of trousers torn.
No priest at his coronation stood,
"Twixt him and the Power above,
His sceptre was a sharp steel sword,
And his chrism was the people's love.
In a }. of rickety steamers he faced
A fleet that scoured the sea,
And landed with one thousand men,
'Gainst thousands thirty-three.
KING BoMBALINo was palace-born
And swaddled in purple and gold; -
There were bishops to bless him, wº to dress him,
And a queen his papspoon to hold :
And when KING BoMBA, the Pious,
Was numbered with the dead,
And BoMBALINo by right divine,
Reigned in his father's stead, -
He was solemnly crowned and sceptred and oiled,
º the Cardinals duly appointed,
And joy-bells were rung, and Te Deums were sung,
Round the throne of the Lord's anointed.
Hard by that throne, you might hear the groan,
Of those that lay in chains,
In Little-Ease, where the sea-damps freeze,
Or the sun-scorch boils the brains.
But stifled still,—for groans too shrill,
Or tongues that dare to wag,
There was CARAFA's silence-cap,
And MANIscAlco's gag.
So Liberty's poison with fetter and lash
From the people's heart he purges, -
And where KING BoMBA scourged with whips,
Boyſ BALINo with scorpions scourges.
And where was KING GARIBALDI then?
He was sailing the Tuscan Sea,
In a merchant-vessel of sixty tons,
For a merchant-captain's fee;
Or his shirt rolled up to the elbows,
And his hands in the mutton-fat,
He was moulding the dips and twisting the wicks,
At a New York chandler's wat—
Or planting early potatoes, -
And tending his goats the while,
Where sheer to the deep runs the barren steep
Of Caprera's little isle.
So enter our Kings—on Sicily's stage—
Be warned, Utopian dreamers,
The one he hath a navy complete,
The other two merchant-steamers;
This leads a rabble a thousand strong,
That, troops by thousands thirty.
The one wears royal purple,
The other a red shirt, dirty;
Let the crack-brained fool, an if he may,
Caprera scuttle back to-
The odds they run a thousand to one,
For de jure against de facto /
Strongly Recommended before Dinner.
(By a Vulgar Illiterate Cockney.)
Why is a lucky sixpence like Absinthe 2–Because it’s a happy-tizer
(appetizer)!!!
THE EXITS.
I see a crowd acclaiming loud,
In Naples' sunlit splendour,
Not women alone, but bearded men
Are tearful of look and tender.
Their throats rain blessings, their hands rain flowers,
And both in showers unsparing;
As they crowd about a worn grey man,
In a red shirt, the worse for wearing.
They clasp his hands, they clutch his flees,
They line his road in masses;
They bring their babes that he may lay
His hands on them, as he passes,
And this is the man that a few months since,
At Marsala dared a landing,
In the face of odds that had never been faced
By a man of the least understanding.
Unscathed by sword, untouched by shot,
. As if o'er his life a charm is,
KING BOMBALINo's navies are his,
And KING BoMBALINo's armies!
And now his foot's on the base of a throne,
And his hand is on a crown—
And behold he takes his hand away,
And from that throne steps down.
And simple and shabby as he came,
So shabby and simple goes;
Back to Caprera's cabbage beds,
And early potato-rows.
No pomp and state on his exit wait,
But that no power can buy
The love that glows in every heart,
And the tear in every eye.
A word, a will—this crown was his,
And his this Kingdom fair,
But better he loves Caprera's isle,
And his old felt hat to wear!
I see a rock-based fortress town,
With batteries girdled round;
There’s a sulphurous reek in the stifling air,
And corpses strew the ground.
The kennels run blood, through the trampled mud,
Crush'd gabion and rent fascine,
Where the cannons lour from the embrasure,
And the gunners shrink and screen :
And heard high o'er the great guns’ roar,
The crack of the fusillade,
Is blent with the fall of shattered wall,
Or bastion prostrate laid.
For months and months the leagured town,
Hath sat in want and woe—
With fear within and fire without,
And Death on-creeping slow;
Till food is spent, and Fever comes,
And strikes its victims down;
And strong men's curses dog the King,
For whom they hold the town; .
And starving mothers at his door
Fling down their babies dead;
And orphaned children lay the blood
Of fathers on his head.
And mutiny folds stubborn arms,
Nor gives back blow for blow;
And so perforce he strikes the flag
Dishonoured long ago:
And through the blood and through the wreck,
His young Queen at his side,
The last Italian Bourbon goes
In sullen scowling pride—
Unblessed, unloved, no hand grasps his,
No heart laments his fall!—
Sic Erit BoMBALINo!
Sic Ereant Tyrants all !
LICENSED WITTLERs.-The Yankees.

Such, we º will be the H.” appeal addressed to passers-
by in Bedford Row and Chancery ſane by gangs of hungry-looking
#ſº with empty blue bags in their hands, and may be a troop of
half-starved clerks and children at their heels. This at least we gather
from the following sad statement, which was put forth the other morn-
ing by the Master of the Rolls:-
“State of BUSINEss IN THE Equity Counts.—His Honour said that he thought
it was proper that he should inform the gentlemen at the bar that he had taken
some pains to ascertain the state of his paper, and he believed that, beyond the
causes set down in that day's paper, there were only nine that were ripe for hearing:
nºr did he see any prospect of the Court being fully employed during the remainder
of the sittings, although hitherto this had been the most laborious portion of the
year. The state of the cause list of the Vice-Chancellors was such that there was
no more business before them than they could dispose of; and he therefore could
nºt properly ask for any transfer of causes. He thought it was desirable to make
this communication as soon as he became acquainted with the state of business. It
was certainly the first time that this had happened since he had had the honour of
§ the present seat. It would be more agreeable to himself and to the bar
to be fully employed during the present sittings. The fact that one of the courts
had not sufficient business to keep it in motion denoted the wholesome state of the
Court of Chancery.”
Yes, certainly, it must be “more agreeable” to the . to find
their webs full of fat blue-bottles, and themselves “fully employed”
with the labour of devouring them. But we fancy had the blue-bottles
a voice in the matter, they would sing out Obe joyfull to see the webs
so empty, and the spiders' occupation so very nearly gone. On the
whole we think the public won’t be sorry to discover that the Chancery

state”, of things when their devourers find some difficulty in blowing
their blue bags out.
A Qompany.THAT REALLY should be. “LIMITED.”—A Company

THE DEFENCE OF AGAR TOWN.
THE noble sentiment of patriotism may inflame the inhabitants of a
district as vehemently as those of a country at large, and combustible
hearts may burn as ardently with zeal for local as for national honour.
MR. WATson, who was stated to be a publican, was, on Wednesday
night last week, unanimously voted into the chair of a meeting which
tookFº at the Talbot Arms, in Cambridge Street, Agar Town, con-
vened to consider what steps should be taken to resent an unfavour-
able description of that suburb, which lately appeared in the Post.
Our fashionable contemporary's topography of Agar Town contained
several statements which tremendously excited the disinterested indig-
nation of the public-spirited inhabitants. For example :-
“The CHAIRMAN said the first statement in the precious article he wished to
notice was, that St. Giles-in-the-Fields had been removed to Agar Town—the
clearing of human rats from one district to another. (Laughter.) He did not think
they deserved that term. This libeller and traducer had no right to call them
human rats. (Cheers.)”
Certainly not. He had no right to call them rats, and when MR.
WATson said he did not think they deserved that term, of course
he did not mean, to imply the admission, that whether they deserved
it or not might be matter of opinion, like the dirt or cleanliness
of Agar Town; he meant to signify, with modest irony, that he rather
flattered himself that the Agar Townsmen were considerably the
reverse of creatures that dwell in filthy places. -
Then the traducer of Agar Town had inaccurately asserted, that it
had been paved by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. This inexactitude
seems to have enraged the sensitive MR. WATson as much as though
the writer had alleged MR. WATson himself to have received parochial
relief. He declared that—
“It was a palpable falsehood to say that tho town was paved by the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, because they did all they could to prevent the parish doing it, on
the ground of its being an iſ. encroachment on private property. This precious
article in the Morning Post, which circulated among the higher classes and clergy of
England, therefore told a deliberate lie. (Cheers.)”
Having thus rectified a misstatement in strong language, the eloquent
Chairman of this select but impassioned meeting then read another
extract from the objectionable article, which had outraged their
| tenderest feelings:–
“The inhabitants of this district are chiefly poor labourers and the poorest class
of costermongers, or men, as they are called, “who follow the markets.” . The
women, if not laundresses, of which there are a t number, are nothing at all,
and a “Mother's Society' strives hard to teach them the commonest home duties.
It is doubtful if they know how to cook the simplest eatable, or wash a child, and
the public soup kitchen finds full employment in making up for their domestic
short-comings."
“Now,” demanded MR, WATson, with a sense of insulted man-
hood:—
“Now, how did they like to hear their wives, sisters, daughters, and mothers
*::::: of in that manner? A greater disgrace could not be thrown on the women
of the neighbourhood, and it was a direct libel."
The REv. R. P. CLEMENGER, the clergyman of the parish, follow-
ing the Chairman, entered into a defence of his conduct in the matter,
which he proved simply to have consisted in showing the correspondent
of the Post round the place, and thus enabling him to make that sketch
# it which the i.º. complained of as being not a flattering
eness.
MR. NoDEs, a vestryman of St. Pancras, then spoke. He said he
was the landlord of twenty houses in Agar Town. Dignus vindice
NoDUs. MR. NoDEs windicated his own position in a manner worthy
of himself and the fine and flourishing town in whose prosperity he has
so large a stake.
An eloquent oration was next delivered by a MR. STEPHEnson, “the
º of a laundry business,” who moved a resolution contradictory
of the statements in the Post article. The commencement may suffice
to indicate the style, which will be recognised as characteristic:—
“Gentlemen all, I have been 16 or 17 years in Agar Town, and I believe I have
held up myself, and my wife, and my children, with the best integrity which they
could be held up in the working classes. I give you to understand, gentlemen, I
am not a gentleman, but a working man, although I hold a certain establishment,
which I have brought up to a great extent by my own and my wife's industry.”
Several other passages, however, are gems also. As this:-
“There is a certain house in King's Square, Bayswater, which I does for. Well,
when they saw this article, they remarked on it, and I asked them to come and see
my place. In a short time I received a party from that family, and they were
greatly deceived by the investigation of my premises. (Loud cheers.)"
“Undeceived,” perhaps MR. Stephenson meant, although, of course,
he said “deceived.” The reporter, however, is probably incorrect in
making him say—‘‘When they ‘saw' this article.” For “
suspect we should read “see.” “When they see this article, &c.”
Admire, too, the following homely utterance of reproachful pathos:–
“I did feel it to my heart when a gentleman stated in the public press that a
mother here has not the knowledge to wash her children's clothes.”
The domestic feelings of the speaker were evidently wounded, as
well as the interests which he had in what he called “our pretty little

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
town.” And doubtless a pretty town it is. But it was requisite that
sentiment should be succeeded by facetiousness; so-
** MR. BARNEs seconded the resolution. He thought, as a young man working in
the town, what his friends at a distance would say when they read the article in
the Morning Post. His mother, in going to bed, would say to his father, "Oh, my
son is in that dog-kennel ! Oh, that I had ... that I could fly to him 1" and his
father would reply he was. Now, it was very hard on him, who tried to please his
parents, that this scandal should be uttered. He did intend to have said more, but
as the time was so short, he would cut it for the night."
When MR. BARNEs, who is clearly a good and funny but not an
intelligible young man, had cut it, MR. EDMONDs moved a resolution
reflecting on the Rev. M.R. CLEMENGER for not having taken steps to
repudiate the imputations that had been cast on Agar Town, and to
vindicate the character of his parishioners:–
** He said, in addressing himself to the resolution, you can't expect much from
costermongers or rats, because you know they have not received a first-class edu-
cation (laughter); but, I ask, why didn't MR. CLEMENGER send a contradiction when
he first saw the article? I do not say he is the author, but he took the individual
round the neighbourhood. We all here belong to the class costermonger or rats.
I'm a very fat one (laughter), but I'd like to bite more if I could.”
A MR. MILLER, another costermonger, then made a speech in the
same strain as that of the preceding ; a strain of very peculiar humour.
The conclusion of it is all that need be quoted:–
“Gentlemen, a costermonger is a man, not a rat, and I never heard of a rat that
lived on blansh-mange. (Roars of laughter.)"
“Blansh-mange” will probably be deemed conclusive as to the cha-
racter of the speech, and the peculiarity of the humour with which it as
well as that of the other costermonger was imbued. Thathumour was un-
mistakeably a humour which may be called dry, but is indeed, generally,
a manifestation of copious moisture. We should like to know how
much beer the two costermongers had had, and indeed what quantity
had been imbibed by the rest of the speakers, all except the clergy:
man, who had very likely taken too little, in order that he might spend
the value of the liquor on his poor parishioners. The resolution con-
demnatory of that Reverend Gentleman having been carried, thanks were
voted to the Chairman, and the meeting, like the facetious young man
who talked nonsense, “cut it.”. How many were there among them
of the wretched classes inhabiting that considerable portion of Agar
Town which, though the settlement as a whole may be “a yºu, little
town,” undoubtedly deserves to be denominated the Slums

Now, supposing this
really a true statement of
a fact, I think it would be
well if we inquire upon
what basis the popularity
of this ‘consummate artist’
rests. If he be really gifted
with the genius ascribed to
him, clearly his excellin
talents should be studie
by all who would perfect
themselves in the dramatic
art. On the contrary, if the

tainly must be to the

that, to stop such imitation, the idol be displaced.
“It humiliates one rather to confess one's ignorance, but will you
please inform me—What is a dramatic critic? Is he one to whom the
public looks for guidance in its pleasures, and whom we expect by his
mature and practised judgment to point out imperfections and to, cul-
tivate our taste? Or is it his business to scatter out puffs broadcast
without discrimination. If this be the case, certain critics have
nobly done their duty: only, I submit,that, to make their meaning
manifest, their writings should be printed with the heading of ‘ADyer-

but the public is most likely, not so well informed, and has a fair

we are not therefore entitled to set him on a pedestal for the ignorant
to gape at, and for posterity to imitate. As a manager, I own that he
commanded my respect, and in some degree I grant that he has gained
it as an actor. His Cardinal Wolsey is, I think, a good conception, and

most skilfully presents.
“MR. KEAN then is, I grant, a most painstaking actor, and in a
certain sort of melodrama he is clever and artistic, and works out his
conceptions with finish and good taste: . But, to call him, as some
critics do, a, “great tragedian;' to term him “this, consummate artist,’
when he plays in Shakspeare parts: to describe his Hamlet as a
masterpiece of art,” performed ‘under the influence of a continued
inspiration,’ and to say, this “vivid, soulful, and expressive” persona-
tion “must be admitted to rank as high in the list of histrionic triumphs
as any personation that was ever achieved in this or any other country’
—such phrases, Sir, as these I consider to be clearly a burlesque of
criticism, which should provoke our laughter only, less than our
regret. Actors are not usually troubled with weak stomachs, but it
must tax the powers of a not ordinary digestion to swallow down such
fulsome stuff as I have quoted, and one would fancy MR, KEAN must
feel both sickened and disgusted by it. To call him a "consummate
actor’ of high tragedy is just about as truthful as to point with admi-
ration to his altitude of stature, to say he stands not less than six feet
seven in his stockings, has the presence of Hyperion and a sweeter
voice than Orpheus, and is more favoured in his person than any mortal
man. Such a statement has indeed been well nighyentured by some
writers, one of whom commends him for his "graceful bearing,’ while
another, (who wrote doubtless with his tongue thrust in his cheek)
says of him in his Hamlet, that he showed all the proficiency of the
i. elocutionist.' Now, I hope I am not snob enough to
ridicule a person for his physical defects ; but I cannot consent to view
as an “accomplished elocutionist” a man from whose mouth the word
‘money” comes with more the sound of ‘putty,” and whose most
emphatic utterance in deeply tragic passages is a tone that alternates
between a gurgle and a gasp.
“As we don't get a “great tragedian” to amuseus often nowadays,
I may possibly next week add a postscript to this letter. In the interim

PERsons who believe that there is something in a name may be
strengthened in their faith by the following intelligence, which was
brought from Trinidad by the last West Indian Mail:—
“The Governor experienced very great difficulty in procuring the services of
gentlemen to assume the responsibilities of office, and was on the point of appealing
to the country in the usual manner, when MR. SMITH, one of the members for St.
Elizabeth, agreed to take office. He secured the services of the Hon. Grohor
Solomon in the Assembly, and of BARon KETTElBoldt in the Legislative Council,
as colleagues.”

in two French papers:–
“We have received communications from several friends of GARIBALDI, stating
that he has not entered into engagements to act—at least in Hungary."

anywhere else, it is pretty sure that the chief actor on the stage of
Italy will appear at the Theatre of War.

HOW TO DRAW OUT A PERSON'S GRATITUDE.
At the last meeting of the London and South-Western, a gentleman
stated that he was one of the passengers who had providentially escaped
being killed in the accident of the 28th ult, “having been drawn out
from the bottom of a smashed carriage.” The gentleman did not
attend to remonstrate, to blow up the company generally, to ask for
damages, but “to thank the servants for their great care and attention.”
Well, gratitude does dwell at times, when it has any dwelling at all, in
some of the strangest places !
If this enthusiast was so grateful for, having, escaped only with his
life, we .."; that his gratitude would have known no bounds if he
had been killed outright. We do not think, if we had been dragged
“through the bottom of a smashed carriage,” that our first impulse
would have been to thank the servants of the company for “their great
care and attention.” Such kindness would be all the more appreciated on
our parts, if it were a trifle less killing. In fact, the attention is of that
overpowering nature that it knocks one completely over, and we do not
think the best time to return thanks is when the breath has been all
but taken out of your suffering body. We hope that the above enthu-
siastic gentleman (whom we almost feel inclined to call “buffer” from
the very affectionate way in which he clings to the railway that has
done him an injury) is, for his own sake, not a frequent traveller on our
iron highways, or else we have our misgivings that his gratitude will
often have occasion to be very severely put to the test. We confess
that the first accident would about exhaust all the gratitude we should
have in our offended corpus, so that we are afraid we should have little
or none left for the second trial.

WHAT OUR FRIENCH FRIENDS THINK OF US.
THE assertion has been hazarded by rash and daring writers, that
Frenchmen as a rule know little about England: that, in spite of the
increasing means of cheap and rapid intercourse, they do not take the
trouble to inform themselves about us; that they still believe we live
on raw beef steaks and “portare-bier,” never trust ourselves abroad
without a bulldog at our heels, and take our wives to Smithfield with
halters round their necks, to dispose of them as slaves to the men who
will bid highest for them. A guide to London, which was published
for the use of the Orphéonistes, and which was honoured by Mr. Punch
with a notice in his columns, helped somewhat to support the bold
assertion we have mentioned, and further confirmation has been recently
afforded by a treatise on Les Anglais, Londres, et l’Angleterre, written
% a Frenchman of whom we never heard, but who gets another
renchman, whose name as a press-writer is thoroughly well known to
us, to verify the truth of the statements in the book. As a reason for
so doing, and as a recommendation of the work he thus endorses, M.
EMILE DE GIRARDIN in introducing it observes—
“The English language not being very familiar in France, my countrymen may
amuse, and at the same time instruct, themselves by studying England and the
English in these pages, to which I give my cordial approval."
Amusement, certainly there may be in the statements which are
furnished; but as to their instructiveness, the less said perhaps the
better. For instance, the French teacher who is patted on the back
by Monsiega DE GIRARDIN, informs his countrymen, that more than
half the British population is compelled to live by begging of the other
half, an assertion which the columns of relief that have been advertised
will be held no doubt to prove. And not less truthful is the statement,
that the English as a rule know nothing of Fine Art; because their
diet and their climate prohibit all such knowledge. As the author
naively tells us:—
“The English are by nature averse to contemplation; they only care for roast
beef, porter, and spirits; whereas it is essential to have that je ne sais quoi which we
call grace, feeling, of which an Englishman has not the remotest conception: his
climate, his coarse food, and black drink are utterly opposed to any mental refine-
ment. In fact, to possess taste, it is necessary to possess soul, and a large soul;
and the English possess nothing but appetite."
... Without inquiring whether Frenchmen have in general large souls
it cannot be denied that they have most of them large stomachs; an
if possession of these properties be incompatible with due appreciation
of the Arts, it may be doubted if our neighbours be much better off
than we are in this last respect. With regard to the coarse food
wherewith we satiate our appetite, perhaps it may be this which so
º: our taste. The raw beef steaks on which our gluttons gorge
and gloat have a brutalising influence upon their dispositions, and
incline them to a relish for the most disgusting sights. Bullbaitin
and cockfighting are more than ever now our national amusements, an
in the opinion of the author whom we cite, the time, is not far distant
:*º Dying Gladiator will be added to the Astleyan attraction of
wi asts:–
“An Englishman requires to see his fellow creatures in danger in order to expe-
rience any emotion. The young girl who was devoured in presence of a full house
at Astley's Theatre obtained a great success. During a whole fortnight she was the
sole object of conversation in social circles and at the clubs. Those who had been
so fortunate as to witness this extraordinary scene were heartily envied by their less
fortunate brethren. To hear the bones of a poor girl crunched by a tigerl what a
delicious excitement 1 I am certain that the day is not far distant when this aris-
tocracy, worn out with ennui, will need such representations'as men combating
with wild beasts."
This return to Roman customs will doubtless find much favour in
the eyes of our fair sex—if, at least this be a truthful picture of their
habits:—
“At a dinner-party the ladies retire into another room, after having partaken
very moderately of wine; and while the gentlemen are left to empty bottles of
Port, Madeira, Claret, and Champagne (!), it is a constant habit among the ladies to
empty bottles of brandy.”
Indeed, now ! Is it really We thank you, good Monsieur, for
teaching us that fact. Often and often have we wondered what on
earth the ladies do when they retire from the dessert table, and, but
that we hate eavesdropping, and have no wish to get our ears boxed,
we should long ere this have followed them, and stooped down to the
keyhole of the sanctum where they sit. Well, we several times have
wondered what made their tongues so glib, and their general conver-
sation so spirituel when we rejoined them. We more than once,
poor fools! have imagined that their spirits were raised on our account,
and have fancied, them intoxicated by the pleasure of our presence.
|Alas! such vain delusions are no more to be indulged in. We now
know on good authority that when the ladies leave the room, it is to
hold a spirit-séance; and that if their bright eyes sparkle at the sight
of our approach, the cause is not a love for us, but an affection for the
brandy-bottle.

THE ITALIAN BOOT.
AN AWKWARD FIX.
FROM the Springfield Journal, the President Elect's
organ, we learn with a certain dismay that—
“Mr. LINcoln stands immovably on the Chicago platform, and
he will neither acquiesce in, nor consult his friends to acquiesce
in, any compromise that surrenders one iota of it."
This is an embarrassing attitude for any statesman
to take. If MR. LINcolN will not remove from the
platform, we suppose the only way will be to carry him
and the platform into the Capitol together. It will
he rather awkward, though, if the floor of the House
is not la:ge enough to take in the platform | We have
heard of merubers having such an attachment for their
seats (like MR. HoRsMAN, for instance,) that they can-
not be made, or persuaded, to give them up; but for
a senator openly to declare that his affection for a cer-
tain platform is so strong that nothing shall induce him
to tear himself fron, it, is quite a new locus standi in
the political world. The bl; possible compromise we
see, when MR. LIN colN and his platform are carried in
triumph to Washington, is, to get the latter incor-
porated instantly with the Board of Administration,
and then ABRAHAM can “stump ’’ away as much as he
likes on both.
There can be but little difficulty in this operation in
a country where they move houses more easily than
spiritualists move chairs or tables, so that an invalid,
who is ordered a change of air, can be carried twenty
miles into the country simply by giving his orders
over-night, and without a single baby in the establish-
ment being in the least disturbed by the arrangement,
or as much as a creditor being cognisant of the move.
If it is so, easy there to transport an entire house
without spilling even a drop of ink, it cannot surely
require the power of a second Aladdin to carry a
simple platform through the country, and to do it so
sº effectively that MR. LINcoLN, on his arrival
at the White House, shall be as immovable as ever,
having traversed the United States, without having
* in the smallest way either to the north or the
south.
WHY are the Game Laws the jolliest, laws we
have? Because their express object is to “keep the

A Chest PROTECTOR.—One of Chubb's locks.
INSTEAD OF WHICH AND NOT ONLY.
EveRYBody, of course, knows the story of the old country Justice,
who addressed to a juvenile goose-stealer, in pronouncing sentence
upon him, this remonstrance:–“Here, Sir, Providence has blessed
you with talents and opportunities, instead of which you go stealing
geese off a common'."
Was this celebrated magistrate a WILLIERs or a Montagu EP
The reason for this question will be discerned in a certain letter on
the subject of Essays and Reviews, lately written by the Bishop of
DURHAM, in reply to an address concerning those writings from the
Archdeaconry of Lindisfarne. “It will,” writes the Bishop, in that
pastoral epistle, “be in great measure, by our Christian earnestness,
and by our Scriptural teaching, that we should guard the unwary from
being led into the paths of such dangerous speculations, and show our
abhorrence of opinions which I from my heart consider not only to be
detrimental to the best interests of morality, and derogatory to,” here
he Bishop uses words equivalent to scriptural revelation—“but which
are so manifestly opposed to the truth as it is in"—here his Lordship
names the Author of Christianity.
The orthodoxy or heterodoxy of Essays and Reviews is not now in
question, and of course we are not going into theology, but, may be
i. to express the supposition that the revelation which the
Ishop of DURHAM mentions, and the truth which he names, are
generally regarded amongst us as one and the same thing. If so, then
that which is derogatory to the teaching must be opposed to the truth,
and the Bishop's “not only ” has a strong family likeness to the
Justice’s “instead of which.” Save that “not only,” in the above
connection, beats “instead of which.” For “instead of which " is
merely a rather gaping ellipsis. “Instead of º: and exerting
which,” was what his Worship meaut to say. But “not only” can
# no stretch of rhetorical licence be forced into harmony with the laws
O
thought and language.
If, indeed, the Bishop of DURHAM intended to contradistinguish
the truth from the revelation, then the “not only” by which he
indicated that intention was not only right but also requisite. But
if he did not intend that, then the Bishop is referred to DR. BLAIR.
He probably has read BLAIR's Sermons; but BLAIR not only wrote
sermons: he also wrote certain lectures on style. These the Bishop
of DURhAM should read, and not only read them, but endeavour to
comprehend them, and observe the instructions which they contain.
His “not only,” as it stands above, unexplained, is a caution
to sinners, that is to say, a caution to writers who sin not only
against the precepts of *hº also against the truth as it is in
LiNDLEY MURRAY. It is likewise a caution to saints–to those
saints who are accustomed to use evangelical phraseology not only
without understanding what it means, but without even considering
what they themselves imagine it to mean. Such saints may be admo-
nished by the example of the Bishop of DURHAM to mind how they
employ serious forms of speech, lest they should unawares, make a
i. mistake, and a mistake which is not only serious but also
tloll Culous.

Chichester Spire, Reading Abbey, Lambeth Church, and sundry
other ecclesiastical edifices have suffered by the extraordinary gale of

have obeyed the permission to—
“ Untie the winds, and let them fight

Our private opinion is, that our Correspondent is a Pump.

PAPAL ZOUAVES AND PETTICOATS.
LETTER, from , Rome, thus
recounts an exploit performed
the other day, by a detach-
ment of Papal Zouaves, whilst
those warriors, on their way
to invade the territory of
Victor EMMANUEL were
voyagun from . Nazzano
across the Tiber in a ferry-
boat:—
“The Zouaves on crossing fired
a volley at some poor country-
women who were labouring in a
field at some distance, and who
took to flight in great terror, but
fortunately uninjured, with the
exception of one who had an ear
shot off."
What terrible fellows are
these Pontifical Zouaves!
The females at whom they
fired were probably most of
them old women; the heroes
no doubt would have pre-
ferred to take º, girls
alive. The Pope's braves
spare neither age nor sex;
no, not even when age and
sex combine to deprecate
their º,
Having knocked off a
woman's ear at a long shot
the gallant Zouaves attacked
and took possession of a mill
of the mill near the Tiber by the Papal Zouaves,
conspicuous by its absence. If these soldiers
are ordered to fire at women, their officers may
be supposed to be desirous to acquire the repu.
tation, of lady-killers. We should like to know
how they are getting on at the mill. Perhaps,
however, they have got off by this time, as many
as were able to º from a body of assailants
whom the fire which they had ventured to open
on the countrywomen at work very likely drew
down upon them. . Those poor old women ran
away; but probably their retreat was speedily
followed by the advance of a troop of youthful
and vigorous peasant lasses, armed with pitch-
forks, scissors, and other rural and domestic
implements.
. What then happened we may safely con-
jecture; The enraged Amazons precipitated
themselves on the men who had fired at their
grandmothers, stormed their position, and sent
them flying—the one who shot a woman's
ear off, perhaps, with a flea in his own. The
Zouaves of the Pope who, on that occasion, had
the, honour of bleeding in the cause of his
Holiness, carry, no doubt, the marks of the
wounds they then received on that aspect of the
body which they necessarily opposed to the
prongs, forks, and skewers wherewith they were
pursued by the girls they left behind them.

ross—as embroidered on the Pope's shoes—was worthy of such crusaders. . Their
descent on the mill may remind the reader of a similar achievement performed by the famous
Knight of La Mancha. Both the one affair and the other are illustrations of chivalry. The
chivalry conspicuously manifest in Don Quirote's assault on the windmill, was, in the seizure
you are at liberty to disprove, if you can—that,
when Venus rose from the Sea, the rising took
place the very first thing in the morning, or
alºne never would have been the Beauty she

THE MYSTERIES OF TRADE.
In the intelligence from the Brazils, last week, we meet in one of
the papers with the following curious paragraph:—
“Dry Germans opened at 59% reals, but declined to 58 for half ox half cow, and
60 fºr ox, this quotation being merely nominal.”
The above is a complete mystification. Of course, in our travelling
experiences, we have met with many. “dry Germans,” but we little
suspected that they ever formed an article of commerce. Besides, who
would care about purchasing a “dry German”? Then the question
arises, how do you dry a German * or does he dry himself in his own
tobacco-smoke?. After this comes the further mystery of his being
“opened.” It is rather undignified to talk in this way of a “dry
German,” as if he were no better than a dried haddock, or a cured
herring, or a Teutonic mummy, that had had the accumulated dust and
cobwebs of centuries upon him. . However, we are so far F. as to
notice that “dry Germans” fetch so good a price in the dry-goods
market. It is more than we should feel inclined to give for such a
specimen of dried metaphysics and transcendentalistic Kantism.
Another puzzle that bewilders us still more is the revelation that
ur “dry German ... is “half ox, half cow.”. We have heard of an
#. bull, and of a Wache espagnole, and of other curiosities belonging
to the animal kingdom; but we must confess that such an ethnological
specimen as a “dry German,” that had the head of an ox and the tail
of a cow, never, fortunately for us, crossed our scientific path before.
We are so mystified that we must write to PROFEssoR Owen on the
subject, though it looks very suspiciously as though BARNUM, under a
strong attack of animal spirits, had had a hand in stitching this new
; together for the enrichment of his New York Museum. We sup:
se that the “half ox” is a delicate compliment to the obstinacy of
russia, and the “half cow” a graceful allusion to the calf-like attributes
of Austria. However, our Foreign Office, that always evinces such a
strong sympathy for German interests, should take the matter ºp. If
slavery is abolished, why, we want to know, are “dry Germans” thus
offered publicly for sale?

A PROPHECY OF MERLIN.
AMONG the curious black-letter prophecies which have been collected
under the name of the famous Celtic Wizard MERLIN, is one which, in
the opinion of many, strangely lº. events which are passing
under our own eyes in the Church of England. The prophecy runs:-
“ºiljammt that a route of 33ishoppts shall be bount
Co liftem uppt a bookt by puttinge botunt :
*Wilbannt that this &nglombt sets a man turn bullr,
Cht tubicht a Coopert bp gº tailc shall pulle,
2nd 3&ttorut out of 33ttoruts thrustem fullt,
Channt look for gricuous minuts . . . ant pragtm alle
Cijat &nglombe's Church ste mat but mabts to fallt.”
This prophecy has, we believe, been repeatedly brought to the notice
of both our Episcopal and Cathedral º but, of course, without
attracting any attention. The last line has been laid hold of, by
credulous º as prophetic of the fall of Chichester Cathedral, the
spire of which has come down upon the nave, while, in the earlier
couplets, fanciful imaginations make out allusions to recent proceedings
in relation to the Essays and Reviews, and the expulsion of an offensive
pervert from a public office.
It would be well if the Church authorities, when they fall on any-
body, would follow the example of the Church buildings, and come
down on knaves only.
THE REAL EDITOR OF “NOTES AND QUERIES.”
IF asked, we should say it was not MR. TIMBs, nor MR. Thoms, but
MR. MULLENs, who is the Solicitor to an Association of Bankers for
the Prevention of Forgery, inasmuch as when there is the smallest
doubt about a Note, it is always sent to him to be Queried. There is
this peculiarity, too, in MR, MULLENs, that he does not take the
slightest interest in the circulation of the curious documents that, as
the recognised head of that difficult branch of literature, are placed in
his hands every year for him to adjudicate whether they have the true
stamp of genius ''. them, or do not exactly come up to the mark.

OUR DRAMATIC coRRESPONDENT.
EAR PUNch,
. “I venturED
in my last to say
word, or two of
compliment to MR.
KEAN in certain
characters, and of
censure to the critics
- who persist in over-
raising him. No good and much harm, as I imagine, will result
rom the use of overstrained, and indiscriminating eulogy. It is
the business of a critic carefully to criticise, and not to blow the
trumpet without having a good reason for it. I suppose we may pre-
sume that actors in some measure are guided by the press, and cer-
tainly the public is believed to put some trust in it. Now when an
actor is so *::: as MR. KEAN has been, other actors, must be
tempted to take him for their model; and as * find his acting indis-
criminately lauded, of course the chances are, that they will copy his
defects. The public it is true may correct them for so doing, but the
ublic is in general a race moutonnière, and apt to follow any one who
ikes to take the lead.
“I have º: that CHARLEs, KEAN is a good actor of some parts.
But while I praise his Louis the Eleventh, I can see no reason to
eulogise his Hamlet. It is I admit a painstaking performance, and
shows clearly that great care and thought have been bestowed on it.
But I am not therefore, entitled to speak of it in raptures as a
‘masterly conception,' and demanding all the genius of a great artist
to work out.’ A portion of the press has had the sense, I’m glad to
see, to stand aloof from its contemporaries, and to abstain from joinin
in their constant cries of ‘bravo!’ and unvarying handclapping, an
chorus of ‘well done!” . The Eraminer jº. between the good
and bad, and while giving the palm freely knows where to hold its
hand. So too the Athenæum, gives MR. KEAN due credit for his acting
in a melodrama, but denies that he is capable of acting in high tragedy,
or wherever there is aught of the poetic in his part. This surely is
more truthful and in better sense and taste, than to smear him over
with butter as a savage might his idol, and to put him on a pedestal
as one above all praise. Dramatic art is injured and its prospects I
think darkened, when an actor so confessedly imperfect as CHARLEs
KEAN is set before Qur eyes as a pattern of Fº and puffed as a
‘consummate artist’ in high art. You may fancy 1 misquote, and deny
that any critic can have used such fulsome phrases. But, with the
exception of your own and the two that I have noticed, show me any
ºf: that exposes his least fault; and is the inference not fair that he
is held to be quite blameless, and nearer to perfection than mortal man
can be? “Lay it on thick, and some will surely stick!’ This seems to
have been the rule of late adopted by the critics, who have stupidly
forgotten another sage old precept which should have cautioned them,
“Lest men believe #. tale untrue,
Keep probability in view.”
“It is not in nature that actors, any more than other people, should
be perfect, and when a critic fails to point out their imperfections, we
may properly account him to be unfit for his work. The influence of
the press of course is weakened by such writers, for mobody of sense
can put belief in their opinions. Such laudation as has º been
poured on MR. KEAN cannot long continue to be swallowed § the
public; and one fancies that press praises are sarcasms disguised, and
that its superlatives, so far from bidding us admire, are simply meant
to make us laugh.
“Old Drury being the largest theatre in London, by way-of contrast
I have paid a visit to the smallest (in saying which, however, I should
by rights except the Bijou, lately opened for French Plays for the first
time in my memory, and now presenting to the public what is called
|an ‘Entertainment,’ of which I have my doubts if it be entertaining).
I, went there on the evening of Miss WILTON's return, and was
pleasantly surprised by her acting in Court Favour. Many times she
has amused me by her naïveté in burlesque, but I had never, before
seen her play a lady’s part, and I can but give her credit for the way
in which she did it. There are not too many ladies at present on the
stage who can assume the graceful manner one looks for in a drawing-
room; and I think, that this young actress would do wisely to direct
her, studies to this end, instead of lowering herself by playing in
burlesques, which have a tendency to º: all who have to do with
them. I need not tell you what relief I found in the neat writing and
construction of Court Favour, after seeing the coarse stupid farce which
had preceded it. Have authors lost the art of , writing these neat
pieces? for, judging by the appetite evinced the other evening, I don't
think that the public at all has lost its relish for them. And, by the
way, ...MR. Swan Bohough, why have you withdrawn the Silver
Wedding from your play-bilſ? A pretty little piece it was, despite its
somewhat prosy dialogue, and should have won some golden opinions
were more people of my mind. - -
“There is a burlesque now at this theatre (as when, pray, is there
not?), which the audience seemed to enjoy and laugh at more than I
did, though I can hardly say exactly why it was I was not pleased.
The piece is not ill played, and is written with such smartness that
one's ears throughout are tingling with the bad jokes which are cracked
at them. But perhaps the name of PLANCHé, which I had just before
been reading in the play-bill, had recalled some pleasant memories
of earlier burlesques, and on his rare model I think no one has
improved.
“I must, however, own that I laughed more at Cinderella than I did
at Peter hilkins, for although the latter is called a ‘comic' panto-
mime, it disposed me rather to despondency than mirth. Not that I
am grown too old to laugh at a good pantomime—I hope and trust
sincerely I never may be that; but I have not yet learned con-
formity with what appears to be the fashion of preferring gas and
glitter to good foolery and fun.
“Next week I intend to see MR. FechTER (rhymes with ‘wretch
stir, MR. Tupper, and not with “nectar,” or with ‘lectur’), and from
what I hear of him in Don Caesar de Bazan, I am given to believe that
I shall have a treat. . Meantime, Sir, you and he may depend on the
assurance of the marked consideration of

apprised of the removal of M. EugèN & Scribe from the sublunary
scene. The Lord CHAMBERLAIN therefore suggests that British Dra-
matic Authors do forth with put their Boy ER's iº. into decent
mourning. Gentlemen who have annexed the entire plot and dialogue
of any of M. Schlbe's pieces will have their Dictionaries re-bound in
black, while for authors who have simply “adapted,” a temporary
cover of black calico will suffice. Appropriators of fragments and
epigrams from the same source will insert black bookmarks or strips
of black ribbon. Half mourning to commence on Easter Monday with
the holiday spectacles, and on Shakspeake's birthday the authors will
go out of mourning.
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Husbands.
In cold winter, when a horse's bit is full of frost, never put it
(we are told) into his mouth without previously warming it. You
shouldn't treat your husband with less kindness than you would your
horse. Therefore, during the winter, put none but warm bits into the
dear creature's mouth. Not to do so is very cruel, as it is very well
known that the husband's mouth is much more sensitive in cold
weather than at any other period of the year. It only makes him restive,
and snappish, and spoils his temper, so much so that it is almost
dangerous, at times, to go near him. Hence, whatever you do, avoid
cold mutton.—A Future Benedick.

completely the better. But surely it is the last building to make a
glass house of, considering the stones that are daily thrown at it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IF NOT A DONKEY, CERTAINLY A DUELLIST.
CT- HE Americans and the
English somewhat
differ in their notions
of the nature of a
joke; else we should
not see reported a
remark such as the
following, which was
made the other even-
ing in the House of
Representatives by
MR. CLEMENs, of
Wirginia:—
w
“He perceived from the
official report that his
is reported to have ex-
pressed a wish that he
(CLEMENs) should go on
with his traitorous re-
marks. He understood
that his colleague made
some other observation
which did not reach his
ear. It was now for him
to say at first, as well as
at last, the position which
he conceived it his duty
to take in this national
colleague (MR. MARTIN)
great shame that his noble figure has not been introduced. There
would have been room for him at the back, amongst that bouquet of
uns. In truth, the effect might have been materially heightened by the
arl being made to look into the mouth of one of the cannons. It
would be a touching reminiscence of Balaklava.
We do not altogether like the look of Wictory. She is not so bright
and smiling as we should wish to have seen her. She looks as if she
had been rubbed all over with black lead. Has she been mourning in
ashes for the few results that have grown out of the Crimean War?
or has it been the fierceness of the fire that has given her that dingy,
smoke-dried look?
The drapery is remarkably good; in truth, for the last few months
we have been thinking that there was a great deal too much drapery
about her, for it completely concealed the figure. The statue looks
much better since it has thrown off that remarkably dirty duster,
boxes the last thing at night in a theatre. As we are inside a play-
house, we may as well state, that we think Victory is stretching her
arms out a little too much in the style of a theatrical king, muttering
in Ellistonian pompousness, “Bless ye, my people!”
All things considered, we fancy the Guards' Memorial has made
rather a happy débât. if not a great success, it is far from being a
failure. It is no worse, and perhaps it is a trifle better, than the
many statuesque caricatures that, in the name of art, are supposed to
adorn our much-abused London. The truth is, that the English
| sculptors have always displayed such a cruel affection for the Metropolis,
that it has been quite a spoilt child with them.
reminding us of those immense wrappers that they hang in front of the ,
emergency was taken de-
liberately and, with the “ART NOT THOU WILLIERS AND A MONTAGUE 7"
expectation that he would
be subject to personal defamation. If his colleague's remark was intended to give
offence he pardoned him, for the reason he was now labouring under a physical
infirmity with a reeking wound received in a personal encounter. If his colleague
had a like fracture in his thigh bone, and had been crippled for two-and-a-half
years, he would find a bullet not a comfortable sensation. (Laughter.) He did not
desire to be ". in a caricature in Punch or Vanity Fair, as leaniug on a came with
one hand and holding a pistol in the other. (Laughter.)"
The Vanity Fair here mentioned is a New York, publication, and
may, for aught we know, be capable of cutting such a joke as MR.
CLEMENs deprecates. But that MR. C. should fancy Mr. Punch would
stoop to do so, clearly shows in MR. C. a painful ignorance of Puuch.
If MR. C. desire enlightenment on this, and who shall say how many
million other subjects? we recommend him to enrich his library forth-
with by buying all the nine and thirty valuable volumes, which are
about to be reissued from Mr. Punch's priceless press. By attentively
perusing their world-benefiting contents, MR. CleMENs may arrive at
a more correct idea of what in Mr. Punch's judgment constitutes a
joke; and he will find good ground for thinking that to make fun of a
cripple, even though he be a duellist, would be a notion not at all
to the taste of Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch reflects with pride, that it was mainly by his efforts that
duelling in England languished and died out. To achieve its wished-
for end, he had recourse to many methods of attack: and when strong
words and sarcasm were found at all to fail, he opened fire with ridi-
cule, and dealt it its death-blow. From being pardoned, if not praised,
as a fashionable failing, it came to be detested as a vulgar vice, and so
went out of favour and ere long became extinct. But in all the laughs
he raised against the notion of a duel being needful to one's “honour,”
Punch never caricatured the misfortune of a cripple, albeit every
duellist he held to be a goose.
THE DébùT OF A NEW STATUE.
We have been able to catch a glimpse of Victory at last. The
Guards' Memorial has made its first appearance in public. It had
been so often announced, and had so often disappointed us, that we
had begun to look upon it as a base impostor, or rather as a capital
one. It is really a statue after all, and no Bottle-Conjuror; it is a
sitive substantiality, and no impossible cram. There you have three
uardsmen as big as life, and every one of them a man of metal that
has already stood fire, and would not mind doing it again. Whilst we
are about it, we may as well state, that the metal in question is BELL-
metal, which will account for the composition taking so much higher a
tone than Metropolitan statues generally do.
Above these soldiers stands the figure of Victory; and, in point of
execution, she is fairly entitled to carry of the palm-though, to speak
literally, some one (but certainly not the Duke of York, for he never
came within a finger’s touch of Victory) has carried it off for her; for,
though we looked into both her hands, we could not see a palm in
either. On the contrary, she is carrying four crowns, like the
immortelles that are sold outside a French cemetery. As there are
only three soldiers below, we are puzzled to know for whom the fourth
crown is intended. Is it for the É. of CARDIGAN ? If so, it is a
The Living of Haughton-le-Skerne has a population of 1000, an income of £1,300.
It borders on Darlington, with a population of 15,000, and an ecclesiastical income
of £600, tout compris. The Bishop of Durham, (late the Rºv. Montague Williers)
was respectfully prayed by the Churchwardens of the Darlington parishes to
take out of the superfuity of Haughton wherewithal to help satisfy the hunger of
Darlington. The Bishop declared he had already given the fat rectory to his son-
in-law, the Rev. M.R. CHEEse, who has been three years in orders.-The Journals,

Was it for this that Shaftesbury plucked you

Was't that the first fat living which fell
Into those well-bred hands immaculate,
Your stripling son-in-law's luck should swell
And cause the churchwardens to ejaculate—
As this twenty-eight-year-old's name they spell–
“Our Bishop's really too anxious to please:
When we ask him for bread, he gives us CHEESE!”
Cheese! The mention of Cheese excites,
As a general rule, the notion of mites;
But in Durham henceforth—say the Church's backbiters—
Folks will never see Cheese without thinking of mitres.

CRINOLINE AND ITS VICTIMS.
NotwitHSTANDING, all that Punch has said upon the subject, the
accidents from Grinoline are, it would seem, upon the increase. Half
a score at least have occurred through fire since Christmas, and several
others we could cite have taken place from other causes. One of the
last we saw reported was occasioned by a dress being caught up by a
cabwheel, while the wearer was crossing a street at the West End.
Here the victim was so fortunate as to escape with merely a bad frac-
ture of her leg; but in most cases the sufferers have lost their life by
their absurdity in wearing the wide dresses which are now accounted
fashionable.
Now, unless there be a wish to decrease the population, it clearly is
high time that such mishaps should be prevented. We cannot as a
Christian people allow our wives and daughters to sacrifice themselves
before the 'i. of Fashion, without labouring our utmost that
the idol be displaced. As Parliament has no other Reform Bill on
its hands, we think it would do well to pass, a measure for ...i
the wide dresses of the ladies, and for reducing their extravagant an
º proportions. Dangerous they are, not merely to their wearers,
ut to any one who chances to come in contiguity. We ourselves
being º of genteel and slender stature, have more than once
been brushed, like a cobweb, off the pavement, by the passing of a pet:
ticoat P. in width; and how many accidents have happened
in ball-rooms and in boats, it would tire out all the wranglers in
Cambridge to sum up.
“Excess of :* is no new thing to preach against. Plenty of
homilies have, we know, been delivered on the subject, and Acts of
Parliament have oftentimes been passed for the like end. A hundred
and fifty years ago there was nearly the same outcry against hoops as
there is now, and the Punches of the period—the Spectator and the
Tatler—did good service in assisting to put the nuisance down.
Whether Crinoline was worn in Classic ages we know not, but OVID
tells us that—
“Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,”
and this seems strongly to confirm the supposition, that it was. At
any rate the nuisance, we have shown, is not a novel one; and we are
aware that in reverting to so old and stale a subject, we shall probably
incur the wrath of many readers, who will sneeringly allege that we
are hard up for a joke. But Crinoline is getting far too serious for
oking. Broken legs and burning dresses are anything to our mind
ut provocative of jests. To petticoat government in moderation we
submit, but we cannot go on suffering ourselves to be thrown down and
trampled on, and run the risk of º run over whenever we walk out.
We therefore hope that something will be done this session to §:
us on a safer footing than we have been, and to prevent our being
swept about like rubbish in the streets. If there be any independent
member in the House—we mean one who has neither wife nor family
to fear—he would do the State some service by moving for a select
committee on the subject, with the view of getting Government to
take the matter up. As LoRD PALMERSTON has long been a favourite
with the ladies,J. his powers of persuasion would incline their
ears to reason, although we are aware it is the last thing in the world
that a woman likes to listen to, and one that few men have the art to
make her really heed.
An Interlocutory Decision.
The RE's a frantic dispute
And no end of a suit,
As to who shall have charge of the MARQUIs of BUTE:
The deduction from which
Is that BUTE must be rich,
And the lawyers are sure to get plenty of Loot.
The Political Atmosphere in America.
The latest intelligence from New York tells us, that “a thick fog
prevails.” We fancy this “thick fog” prevails more or less all over
the country. It is very clear, and it is the only thing that is clear,
that politicians do not exactly see their way. Hoº, let us hope,
when the fog has cleared off, that the ground will be taken up by a
speedy settlement of the Blacks.

ALLIGATORS IN TEARS.
*~~~
E see that Louisiana
has seceded from
the American Union
in a manner equally
disgusting º ridi-
culous. Despatches
from Baton Rouge
contain the particu-
lars of this absurd
roceeding. The de-
§. in the Conven-
tion on the question
of secession having
closed, we are told,
a vote was ordered,
and :—
“The Galleries and
lobbies were intensely
crowded, and a death-
like silence prevailed.
On the call of the roll,
* many members were in
tears.”
Who were the
weepers? A nume-
rous minority in the
Louisiana Conven-
tion, bewailing the
folly which the ma-
jority was about to
erpetrate? Not so;
or the vote having
been announced, the
– Ayes turned out to
Tº be 113, and the Nays
iž. The weeping
members were there-
fore Secessionists—
Slaveowners, Slave-
drivers—and about
what then were these ruffians blubbering f We can
only suppose either that their tears were those of
maudlin mournfulness, or drunkenness, or proceeded
from the fountain of doleful hypocrisy. That the
latter was the source of these crocodiles' or alligators'
tears, is very decidedly indicated by what follows:–
“CAPT. ALLEN then entered the Convention with a Pelican flag, accompanied by Gover Nok
MooRE and staff, and put the flag in the hands of the President, amid tremendous excitement.
“A solemn prayer was then offered, and a hundred guns fired."
Having agreed in an act of treason towards their common country, in pursuance
of a brutal determination to persist in oppressing their fellow-men ; having
renounced their allegiance to the American Union, to the intent of persevering in
the violation of their duty towards their neighbour, these snivelling professors of a
rascally piety go down on their knees and pray. Hideous devotion! Praying and
lºf as they were, surely every drop that trickled from their turned-up eyes
down their snuffling noses, must have looked black in the light of Heaven. Angelic
chemistry has perhaps turned those tears to jet, and keeps them for a curiosity.
Unpleasant humbugs. The odour of their sanctimony grievously offends the moral
nose.
The finishing touch to the character of these brutes is supplied by the following
account of an atrocity narrated in a despatch dated at Washington:-
“Information was received by the Government this morning, from the Collector at New Orleans,
stating that the barracks about two miles below New Orleans, now occupied as a Marine Hospital,
were taken possession of on the 11th instant by CAPTAIN BRADFord, of the State Infantry, in the
name of the State of Louisiana. There were 216 invalids and convalescent patients in the hospital
at the time it was seized. The collector of customs was required to immediately remove the
F. who were convalescent, and those who were confined to their beds, as soon as practicable.
his action is regarded by the Government as most outrageous and inhuman."
The hospital was seized, and the patients were turned out of it in order that it
might be occupied as a barrack by the State troops of Louisiana, levied on behalf
of slavery and rebellion. SECRETARY Dix denounces this deed as “an act of out-
rageous barbarity, disgraceful to any age or country.” . But what are the savage
secessionist slaveowners of Louisiana but barbarians?. Inhumanity after all is
inhumanity, and º with benevolence knows no distinction of colour. Merci-
lessness tº black slaves is simply consistent with cruelty to white sufferers. The
expulsion of the patients from the Marine Hospital is an achievement worthy of
such soldiers as the troops of Louisiana. We hope it will prove their crowning
exploit; for it is meet to be, and they are not very likely to distinguish themselves
much by performing any other more creditable.
In one of the above extracts, a CAPTAIN ALLEN is described as doing a bit of
pantomime with a “Pelican flag.” The pelican depicted on this flag was perhaps
what heralds call a “Pelican in her Piety;” a pelican pecking her breast to feed
her young with the contents of her own veins and arteries. The piety of the
pelican, however, has no resemblance to that of the pietists
of the Louisiana Convention. The pelican does not howl
and cry, and pray for Fº and preservation in injustice
and wickedness. The pelican is said to bleed her own
bosom; but the only blood ever shed by such fellows as
those whose standard is the “Pelican flag,” is that which
is spilt in murderous brawls, or that with is drawn by
cowhides from the lacerated human back.
HUBBARD’S APPEAL.
O GLADSTONE, born to affluence,
Hadst thou thy bread to earn,
Of rents from earnings, how immense
The difference thou wouldst learn'
Wert thou compelled by industry
To win each daily meal,
That which thy conscience fails to see,
Thy consciousness would feel.
With wife and children to support,
All beggared shouldst thou die;
Should thy employment e'er fall short,
The Workhouse in thine eye;
Thou wouldst perceive the truth, ignored,
By thee, a wealthy man,
Precarious income can't afford
What certain income can.
The tax that takes from both alike
Would move thy own disgust.
Thee, when it wronged thyself, 'twould strike
As monstrously unjust.
The difference thou wouldst comprehend,
Denied by fool and knave,
Between the means a man may spend,
And those he ought to save.
Great, when the savings, which should make
Provision for thine age,
The tax-collector came to take,
Would be thy manly rage |
Injustice, thou would'st then discern,
}. craft defied to flee;
And what would be thine own return,
Then, under Schedule Dº
ECCLESIASTICAL SWAINS.

hese little taxes appear to be quite an element in rural
felicity. The fondness, for them manifested º: Rural
Deans invests them with aPºiº rurality. e connect
them with flocks and herds. There are flocks of sheep,
and there are flocks of geese. Sheep are sheared; geese
are plucked : and the operations of sheepshearing and
oose-plucking are naturally associated with the levy of
É. There are herds of cattle, which suffer them-
selves to be milked, and their milk affords cream, out of
which is , made butter, where with, the bread of fat
pluralists is buttered on both sides. There are also herds
of swine, that grunt and grumble, and may be supposed by
Rural Deans to express dissent, but such dissenters repre-
sent rather a class of farmers who dissent from any and
every doctrine which demands their money. these
rural ideas are associated with Church-Rates by reason
that the cudgel has been so generally taken up for them
by Rural Deans. If the Rural Deans were only Rural
Bishops, the RIGHT REVEREND C91.IN, and LUBIN, and
CoRydon, and other *: might not only wield an
oaken staff with a hook for crosier, by hook and crook,
as it were, to maintain those ecclesiastical demands, but
also sing the necessity of them in genuine pastorals. The
Rural Deans should provide themselves with Pandean pipes,
on which, if Church-Rates are abolished, they may suitably
whistle for them.

misprint. We suspect it was originally “a bottle of Ai,” meaning the celebrated Champagne
of that name; and that by some desperate Cockney continually bawling out, “Here, waiter,
bring me another Bottle of Hai,” the term gradually got corrupted into its present use. It
is simply used in the form of chaff.

it is consumed, rise again like a Phoenix from its
own ashes!

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
February 18, Monday. The Roll of the Lords has been made up, for
the present Session, and it shows that our Upper Chamber contains, or
rather qught to contain, 1 Prince, 1 King, 27 Dukes, 35 Marquises,
170 Earls, 31 Wiscounts, and 162 Barons, altogether 457 Nobles. But
it seems that, strong as the noble company is, it is “unfashionable to
attend the House of Lords,” and when the LoRD CHANcellon took
his seat to-night there were.7 Peers present. At no time were there
more than 39 noble Articles furnishing the chamber. LoRD Punch may
take occasion to attend, one of these nights, and * have something
to say about, the absentees...The Select 'vestry ad nothing very
interesting before it, except a little discussion on the short-comings of
the other Select Westry called the Board of Works, which Rex
Thwaites defended, in a letter of regal hauteur.
The Commons went to work in Committee on the Bankruptcy Bill,
which was also discussed on other nights. Much progress was made.
The grand feature of the Bill, the abolishing the difference in the
position of the Trader and the Non-Trader, fills the world of non-
traders with a non-unreasonable terror. A whole phalanx of lawyers
declares that as the Bill stands, a man has but to shut up his house
and be off for a tour to Switzerland, without paying up his tailor (an
who, Mr. Punch, indignantly asks, pays his Aft: in August, or at any
other time, if he can help it?), and when that Swiss traveller
returns. home he, will find himself a Bankrupt. The law must
be a little modified, so as to prevent any such catastrophes.
Mr. Punch suggests that if , a Sweli affixes an accurately spelt
notice, on his street-door, after the fashion in the Temple and
other law colonies, saying—“Gone to the Pyramids. Return one
of these days,” such notice shall bar all proceedings under the new
Act, and this practical .." is hereby placed at the disposal of
SIR. Rich ARD. The Parochial Assessments }. was read a Second
Time, and MR. HENLEY said that the measure was beginning to excite
some attention in the country. By the time it has passed, therefore,
the country will, it is hoped, have awakened to a consideration of the
question whether the Bill was wanted or not. MR. HENLEY seemed
alarmed at the power the Bill ſº to county boards to order maps,
because some counties might like their maps made on a very large
scale indeed. But as, by the new Electro-Block process, Mr. Punch
understands that an object no larger than Wiscount WILLIAMs's views
can be expanded with the utmost facility until it is almost as É. as
Mr. Punch's own reputation, the cost of maps need not frighten
MR. HENLEY.
Tuesday. This was a dies notanda cretá albá, or, at least, a large
chalk-mark was made all down Mk. GLADsTone's back. MR. John
GELLIBRAND HUBBARD, Member for Buckingham, and a Conservative,
boiled over about the Income-Tax. He brought forward a motion for
a Select Committee to sit in judgment upon the Tax, and to inquire
whether it could not be more equitably levied. ..MR. GLADSTONE, of
course, being “a pot that is soon hot,” also boiled over, on his own
account, and resisted the motion, and was especially indignant at Mk.
HUBBARD's supporting the view that precarious incomes ought not
to be taxed in the same way as those derived from fixed sources. MR.
WHALLEY º proposed to assimilate the Tax to the Poor-
Rate; but as we shall all be upon the Poor-Rate if taxation on the
Gladstonian principle proceeds much further, this suggestion seems a
mockery. Mik, GELLIBRAND HUBBARD was not to be put dow and,
on division, he beat the Ministers by 131 to 127; and MR. John BULL,
like a sensible commercial man, resolves to make his clerk GLADstone
take a holiday, and meantime MR. BULL means to examine his own
books for himself. The Tax will be gellibranded with the mark of
infamy, and whether M.R. GELLIBRAND likes jelly, brandy, or both
together, he is hereby authorised to go and treat himself at the expense
of Mr. Punch.
The Lords treated themselves to a China debate, originated by
EARL GREY, who proved, to his own satisfaction, that everything,
pacific or bellicose, which we have done in China, has been done
i..', and LoRD ELLENBoRough was much of the same opinion.
LoRd Wodehouse did the defensive for Government.
In the Commons, MR. Locke KING was allowed to introduce a Bill

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
for lowering the county franchise to £10, and MR. BAINEs was allowed
to bring in another #. for lowering the borough franchise to £6.
Now these two measures together make rather a large Reform Bill,
and the conduct of Parliament in declining to have one whole Reform
Bill, but taking it in two pieces, reminds A/r. Punch of a celebrated
story by the late lamented REVEREND MR STERNE. That clergyman
(who, by the way, wrote better English than DR. WILLIERs, and other
priests of the present day), relates that two holy nuns were driving a
mule that ought to have drawn their vehicle from the convent to a
certain shrine. But the mule, finding that he had only two gentle
ladies behind him instead of a slashing swearing driver, basely stuck
fast, and would not move. The young ladies tried every means to get
him on in vain. At last it occurred to them that the beast had been
in the habit of being urged on by bad language, and would not
move unless a naughty word were used to him. Somehow, convent-
bred though, they were, the pretty creatures happened to know one
naughty word, Mr. Punch does not know one, but it is suggested to him
that it may have been “Devil.” But of course the girls were not going
to commit the sin of saying this, and a bright thought struck them.
“Let us divide the word,” said the holy Constantia to the holy EMILIA,
“and then there will be no sin, as neither will have said the word.”
So “De” cried the sweet voice of EMILIA, “Wil,” cried the sweet
voice of ConstantiA, and on, let us hope, went the mule. Divide the
word, says Parliament, let MR. KING say “Re,” and let MR. BAINEs
say “Form,” and on we go. However, though neither LQRD PAl-
MERSION nor MR. DisRAELI showed fight, they gave no promise not to
fight hereafter, and the PREMIER declared that this was not a time for
action, but for “waiting.” Perhaps he is right, and if we wait for the
waggon we shall all have a ride.
SIR MoRTON PETo brought in a Bill for providing for the better
interment of Dissenters. It was not opposed, and indeed we believe
that in the excess of his liberality, MR. Newpºre said that he
should be happy to see them all buried, SIR, M. PETo is building
largely at Southend, which looks as if he had a design for burying his
co-religionists alive.
Wednesday. Divers people in Southwark, sent by MR. Locke, a
º for Reform. Mr. Punch ...!
9me, and make their own district decent before they begin to complain
of other people. He had the misfortune to be in Southwark twice
this week, and the foul state of the streets made him regret that he had
permitted his friend MR. LAYARD to stand for a place where you stand
ancle-deep in mud. And apropos of this, Mr. Punch observes that
the REveREND MR. SPURGEoN has been alluding to Mr. P., and
thanking him, respectfully enough, for putting in MR. LAYARD. This
is all very well, but if Southwark thinks that because she did her duty
on one occasion, she may neglect it afterwards, she is as much mistaken
as ever was a slatternly maid-servant, who, because she is kind to the
children, thinks that she may be saucy to her mistress, and take five-
and-twenty minutes in fetching the supper beer. To-day MR, HAD-
FIELD moved the Second Reading of a Bill for getting rid of the declara-
tion which office-holders under the Crown lave to make, namely that
they will do nothing to injure the Church of England. Mr. Nºwog.
GATE thought that this was a safeguard of the Church, but SIR. G.
Lewis, who is not troubled with too much faith in superstitions, said
that such a safe-guard was ideal and fanciful. Battle was given, and
the Bill read a Second Time by 93 to 80. Who will move its strangula-
tion in the Lords? The Dissenters are winning the tricks at the
beginning of the i. Bill for letting them in to manage schools
that were endowed before Dissent was invented, was read a Second Time,
by 164 to 157. MR. DiLlwyn seemed to think that all such arrange.
ments should follow the changes of opinion. “The blasphemy of one
age is the religion of another,” wrote a philosopher.
Thursday. LoRD STRATHEDEN.son of the Chancellor, made a meat
little reform speech, and a neat little intin quotation, which has been
heard of once or twice before, like his Papa's historical blunders.
In the Commons, a Catholic nobleman, who some time ago did
society the good service of saving a rich heiress from a gang of greedy
priests, did a less wise thing in asking_LORD John Russell to inter.
º with the KING or ITALY, in behalf of the scoundrels, who, hired
y Rome, are still committing crimes in the South. Loºp John,
with becoming indignation, told LoRD Edward HowARD that it was
not the Sardinians who had practised cruelties in the late war, but that
when ruffians were taken in arms, the best way to deal with them is the
shortest. The rancour of the priest-party, just now, against Italian
freedom, would be amusing were it not pitiable. But Italy may say
to that crawling venomous party, in SHELLEY's words:—
“Well, if thou wilt—as 'tis the destiny
Oftrodden worms to writhe till they be dead,
Put forth thy might.”
Friday, LoRD HERBERT made a clean breast of it about the Tippe-
rary Artillery. The fact was that he had seen some 800 fine fellows
and wanted to grab them for the Service. In his eagerness, he offere
them what it was not in his power to #. and as soon as he found
out the state of the case, he put an end to the bargain. How much
recommends them to look at
better this sort of frankness is than the usual military mystification
and bluster... No doubt the toadies, at the Horse Guards, are quite
indignant with the Secretary and the Duke for not telling some
rigmarole story, with a bit of the Army List, and a quotation frºm the
Duke of WELLINGton in it, and winding up with a wish that, if
noblemen are expected to do the work of the country, they might at
least be freed from the impertinent control of civilians and anonymous
writers in journals.
Heaps of small matters came up in the Commons, but Mr. Punch,
on boiling them down, finds very little at the bottom of his saucepan.
MR. Monckton MILNEs obtained leave to bring in a Bill for allowing
Edwin to marry the sister of his departed ANGELINA, and as the
arsons have crotchets on the subject, it is proposed that a marriage
§. a registrar shall answer the purpose. MR.WALPole promised to
oppose the Bill on rational grounds, and not with texts, which is some-
thing gained; and MR. Scully said that having obtained the opinion
of the ladies of Ireland, which was against the Bill, he would, before
the next reading, descend among the lower classes, and ascertain what
they thought of the measure, an undertaking which gave great satis-
faction to the House.
A GLUT OF HEROES.
HIPwREcks caused by the
violent gales and storms that
have been prevailing ever
since the commencement of
the year, afford too much
confirmation to the proverb
which says, that misfortunes
never come single. But
whilst those calamities have
been coming in a crowd
they have been accompanie
by a corresponding multitude
of compensating facts. On
the one hand, you cannot
open a newspaper without
being harrowed by an ac-
count of a shipwreck; on the
other, without being gratified
by the notice of an act of
heroism, consisting in the
rescue of shipwrecked suf-
erers, and performed in the
face of imminent danger, by
the crew of a life-boat.
Great rogues turn up with a
frequency which explains
the popular comparison, “as
- # as thieves.” But
gallant fellows come out in greater numbers both simultaneously and
in succession. “HEROIsM” is even a commoner heading in the
journals than “EMBezzleMENT’ or “DEFALCATION.” These remarks
are intended to redound to the honour of the brave seamen who have
ſurnished such ample occasion for them, and also to the credit of the
National Life-boat Institution, which, in consideration of those tre-
mendous gues of wind that the tight little vessels constructed by it
are capable of weathering, must be acknowledged to deserve the
utmost advantage it can derive from the most favourable puff.

A RATTLING GAME.
The Americans con...ue pleasure with business in an admirable way.
They appear completely to make a game of politics. With them,
public life is a beautiful mixture of work and play. This is the way
they have been amusing themselves lately in California:—
“California was strong, for the Union. Their Assembly bad failed to elect a
President after 72 ballots.”
If they had been playing a game of backgammon, these Californian
M.P.s could not have rattled the box more merrily. The Assembly
does not seem, however, to have gained much by its play, for the only
result as yet of all its throwing for a President has simply been to
throw him over. We have heard of the “Hero of a Hundred Fights;”
but we think the above President, when he is elected—and he promises
in time to be the “Hero of a Hundred Ballots”—will be even a
greater Hero than he; for it is very clear, before he has gone safe
through the fire, that he will have been exposed to an infinitely greater
number of balls.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARY 25. Monday. The Census of the Lords states that there
were seven of them present when John LoRD CAMEBELL took his seat,
but Mr. Punch's threat has terrified the Peers, for at one time there
were sixty-seven. This is better, but where were the others? LoRD
Srrat Ford DE REDCLIFFE entered into the Syrian question, on which
he wanted information, but LoRD Wodehouse declined to give him
any, on the ground that a Conference on the question was being held
in Paris. , He was, however, happy to say that the Turkish Govern-
ment had been very energetic in punishing the Druses, though the
Christians had shown themselves a little unworthy of the protection
they had received, for as soon as the presence of troops had made them
safe, they had massacred 136 persons, of whom 25 were women and
86 children. But the lay Christians were milk-and-water people, com-
pared to the º: the bishops having demanded the execution of
4,500 out of 11,000 Druses, and upon being requested to revise their
little butcher's bill, had sent in a new claim for 1,200 lives. LoRD
Wodehouse urged, therefore, that it was difficult to meet the views
of Oriental Christianity.
The Commons worked away at the Bankruptcy Bill, and some very
sensible things were said by various people. The Attorney-General
strongly condemned the conduct of rascals who give unlimited credit
to young men, and lead them into extravagance and profligacy, because
one day they will come into property, Nº. explained that #. had no
idea of doing anything for such creditors. The merciful principle that
when a man has given up all that he has to his creditors, he shall be
free for a fresh start in life, unmolested by old claims, was strongly
insisted on. The Committee had knocked off nearly 200 clauses before
rising. The Bill for bestowing the forfeited seats was read a Second
Time, MR. Baxter claiming a Member for the Scottish Universities,
Mr. Bestinck protesting against there being any more Metropolitan
Members, who were an Inconvenience to the House, MR. Peacock
proposing that the new Members should be elected by the working
classes, MR. Blackburn ridiculing Chelsea and Kensington as places
where they grew only cauliflowers and asparagus, and various other Mem-
bers contradicting and abusing one another. The carrying the Second
Reading did not commit the House to the appropriation of the seats.
Tuesday. The Bishop of OxFord moved the Second Readings of two
Bills, designed for the protection of female purity among the humbler
classes; but both Bills were pººl. out of the House by the
LoRD CHANGELLQR, Keeper of the Queen's conscience, and by LoRD
GRANville, President of the Council.

Sir W. Goodenough Hayter, M.P.
The Right Man in the Right Place.
APROPOs of the “Patronage Secretary,” ob-
served a scrupulous M.P. to BERNAL Osborne,
“I can't understand how you contrive to fill up
the place. One would think everybody would be
either too good, or too bad for it.”
“Exactly,” said BERNAL. “That’s precisely
the reason. HAyreſ, was the one man for the
work. He was “good enough.”
MR. ToM DUNCOMBE gave notice, that when the Census shall have
been taken, he shall move the House upon the question of Reform.
Had not the Numerators better be told to append to the Census papers
this question for the Head of the Family—“What is the opinion of
yourself, MRs CAPUT, ARAMINTA, JULIA, CHARLEs, ToMMy, and BABY
upon the British Constitution ?” SIR. C. Wood being asked, when the
Delhi and Lucknow prize-money would be distributed, replied, “As
soon as the Rolls have been sent from India.” A very proper answer,
as many of the poor soldiers are really in want of bread.
Cavalry and Artillery officers object to feed their horses, or rather
want to saddle the country with the expense of feeding their chargers.
The swell officers in the House of course severally intimated in the
most throaty manner that it was a cust inf- something sham.e to make
ſellahs pay-a-a-eight-pence ha'peny a day for their horses; but MR.
FREDERIck PEEL was unconvinced by throatiness, and reminded the
gallant parties that they had been good enough to accept their com-
missions and pay upon the understanding that this deduction was to
be made, .# MR. BERNAL Osborn E made some good ſun at the
expense of the poor Cavalry officers who wanted “relief” out of the
. of . tax-payers. The House eliminated the horsey proposition
y 213 to 56.
MR. Hodgkinson brought in a Bill for preventing Frivolous De-
fences to Actions for recovery of small debts. The SolicitoR-GENE-
RAI, promised to see whether the measure were harmless. It seems
rather foolish, for it proposes that a debtor shall not defend until he
has made an affidavit that he has a good defence. . A man who will
make a fraudulent defence will generally make a false affidavit, and
besides, if he happens to have any conscience, his attorney will remove
his scruples by assuring him that the affidavit is mere matter of form,
and indeed, more reasonably, by asking him how he knows, whether a
defence is or is not good in law. hy, judges defend the plea of
“Not Guilty,” on the ground that an ignorant criminal does not know
whether, he is properly charged., The measure, seems to Mr. Punch
as calculated to increase attorney's costs, and when he hears of a Bill
of that kind he involuntarily bursts out into exquisite song, with words
that MADAME WEsthis as Giovanni used to deliver so brilliantly
some years ago. Mr. Punch remembers the words, because in those
days singers sang words, instead of making noises in imitation of
musical instruments:–
“I saw by the * that so greasefully curled,
All down their lank cheeks, that they wanted a Fee,
And I said, if I had but a pound in the world,
Those demons of lawyers would take it from me.”

failure of our endeavours to put it down, and urging that we ought to
promote free immigration, especially from China, into the West India
Colonies. LoRDs John Russel L and PALMERSTON were animated in
their replies, and denounced , both the American and the Spanish
Government, LoRD John stating that in answer to the petulance of
the former, he had assured Mr. Buchanan that no diplomatic imper-
tinences should prevent the English minister from protesting against
humbug in the matter, and the PREMIER, characterising the conduct of
Spain as profigate (cheers), shameless (cheers), and disgraceful bad
faith (cheers). #. did not think immigration was a matter for Govern-
ment interference.
Wednesday is the Sunday of the House of Commons. That is, at
this Morning Sitting questions of a religious character, or connected
with ecclesiastical matters, are usually discussed. To-day came on the
and Church-Rate battle. Both sides had whipped uncommonly hard,
ut “the wisdom of kindness” was strongly illustrated. Mr. Punch,
and very likely many millions of his readers, may have seen in the win-
dows a print of two sweeps mounted on two jackasses, and racing.
The loser is simply flogging, but the winner holds a few inches before
his donkey's nose a bunch of º: carrots, after which the creature
struggles with an energy that defeats his coerced colleague. Well,
the new Conservative Whip did his duty like a man, and brought up his
rank and file º well; but the Liberal Whip had got the ques-
tion fixed for a day in the evening of which 365 of his party were going
to dine in honour of SIR WILLIAM HAYTER. . So the carrots did the
business, and after a short, smart debate, the best bits of which were
an utterly irrelevant speech of Mr. Bright's against the selling the
livings .# live Parsons, and some curious discussions about the famous
Essays and Reviews, Sir John TRELAwNY carried the Second Reading
of the Abolition Bill by 281 to 266, ...'. 15. Fifty more Members
voted than came up to the same scratch last year; the Church party
(GLADstone and FRED. PEEL voting with them) had thirty-two more
votes than last year; ten Tories voted for the Bill, and ten Liberals
against it, and the majority for the Bill, last year, was 9. These are
the Morning Star's statistics, and anybody who likes to boil them up
with the aforesaid carrots is welcome to the result.
The subsequent dinner to the ex-whip of nine years, SIR WILLIAM
HAYTER, deserves to be mentioned in Parliamentary history. . PAM
took the Chair; there was present a Member for every day, in the
year; a splendid testimonial was given to the genial ex-political Secre-
tary, who, it used to be said, looked, in the House, like NAPOLEON
with a tight boot upon his mind; and the PREMIER made a capital
speech, in which he attributed to Sm WILLIAM nearly all the virtues
that, according to Pope, belonged to a divine of his days:-
“To Berkeley, every virtue under heaven.”
Thursday. SANDYs—SANDys? LoRD PUNCH seems to remember
the name. Q–ts—ts—why, to be sure, MARcus HILL! How are you,
MARCUs? Show him where to sit, Foley—or you, SMITH-our boy,
MR. CAVE made an excellent speech on the Slave Trade, showing the
Lyveden, we mean, as you have introduced him. Glad to see you,
MARCUs! You’ll have to learn to be bored, but not to-night, for
DERBY's up.
A long speech from LoRD DERBY, in which he dwelt, eloquently of
course, upon the hardship inflicted on the labouring classes, by the
perpetual cutting up of “low districts” in London, for the sake of
making improvements. The wholesale demolitions contemplated by
several railway companies furnished the immediate text. He also
adverted to the way in which yaluable public buildings were sacrificed
for the same object, and specially mentioned the London. Institution,
which had been established by Act of Parliament, at a cost of £30,000
and contained a magnificent library, theatre, and reading-rooms, and
had been for many years an invaluable boon to the inhabitants of
Finsbury. This, with the pleasant circus, it was º: to remove
for the sake of a railway that was to come from places where nobody
lived to places where nobody wanted to go. ord Shaft ESBURY
took the same side, and gave painful pictures of the odious and
demoralising overcrowding of the dwellings of the poor, in consequence
of the destruction of so many of their homes. LoRD GRANVILLE made
the usual stereotype answer, that the matter must be left to public
opinion, that spending money did the poor good, that workmen ought
to live out of town and come in by trains, but anyhow, Government
could not, interfere. , Mr. Punch is, of course, with his Lordship,
and will shortly introduce to the public a plan for making St. Paul's
the central terminus of a railway system, whereby the rotunda and
dome will be utilised. WELLINGroN, NEison, and others deposited
there may still remain as–hal ha i–Šleepers: and, the building being
consecrated, victims of accidents may at once receive interment with-
out extra charge or trouble.
In the Qommons, MR. CAIRD urged that as the last harvest had not
been good, Ministers ought to be very economical, and in a Syrian
debate MR, LAYARD made his first speech, since his return, ſ.
pointing out the impolicy of the mode in which Turkey is being treated,
and the one-sided view which, for French purposes, Europe had been
taught to take of the Lebanon disasters:
To-night and next night were held debates of real importance on our
Admiralty system, which does not appear to have much mended since
the day when Perys, recorded his having, assisted, at a Board, and
added, “But, Lord, to see how like Fools we talked!” A Select
Committee is to consider the whole system.
Friday.,Lond Norm ANBy delivered a long and feeble speech, full of
gossip and chatter, against the new régime in Italy, and he proved two
things; first, that his opinions on the subject are not worth a baiocco,
and secondly, that the old ſribble is immeasurably disgusted with a
change which has transformed into a land of freemen and soldiers
“A land of singing and of dancing slaves.”
The Commons. Conversazione was very miscellaneous, but the only
thing worth mention was a sort of comfortable impression gathered by
Mr. Punch, rather than derived from any specific statement, that some-
thing really will be done some day towards Embanking the Thames.
CONFEDERATES AND UNITED STATESMEN.
HE Convention of the
six seceding Southern
States, South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Ala-
bama, Mississippi, and
Louisiana, assembled
at Montgomery, Ala-
bama, on the 9th ult,
adopted a constitution
of their own, which
they have named “The
Constitution for the
Provisional Govern-
ment of the Confede-
rate States of America.”
The Southern Seces.
| signists must be ad-
mitted to be blest with
at least the philosophi-
cal virtue of self-know-
ledge. They term their
new league the “Con-
federate States of Ame:
- rica.” . Thus they call
themselves by what they doubtiess feel to be their right, name. They
are confederates in the crime of upholding Slavery...A correct esti.
mate of their moral position is manifest in that distinctive denomi-
nation of theirs, “Confederate. States.” This title is a beautiful
antithesis to that of the United States of America. The more
doggedly confederate slavemongers combine, the more firmly good
republicans should unite.
“CORRUPT PRACTICES.”
The wife of an M.P. wishes devoutly that, “amongst the Parlia-
mentary. Corrupt Practices’ that are to be reformed this Session,
the practice of keeping such very late hours may be slightly modified.”
It is abominable, she contends, to see a Legislator, who should set a
proper example to others, coming home, with the milk, just as the
children are getting up. As they meet him, on the staircase, going
ºp to bed, what can the little dears possibly think of their Papa?
The first government of a man, who professes to be a good patriot,
should be his own home; but how can he govern his home when he is
absent from it both night and day? At the time that all other houses
are closed, the House of Commons is the only one that keeps open;
and she maintains that it isn't respectable. It ought never to close
later than ten minutes after the Opera, and then a Member's wife
could call for her husband and take him home.
A Good Licking.
THE height, or depth, of profane adulation was surely arrived at by
the French Senate in the antithesis presented by the following extract
from their address to their Imperial master:—
“It was a fine day that on which, in the centre of the restored Cathedral, were
heard the Te Deum for the Lord, and the Domine Salvum for the EMPERoR.”

A SHAVE FOR THE SOLDIER.
UBJoINED is an an-
nouncement which has
been made on the best
authority:—
“THE GUARDS.—We hear
it mentioned as most pro-
bable that MAJoa-GENERAL
CRAUFURD, late of the Gre-
nadier Guards, will succeed
to the command of the Bri-
fade of Guards which will
e vacated by Lord RoxEBY
on the 1st of April next.”
The First of April is
a day on, which unsus-
pecting juvenile inno-
cence is wont to be de-
spatched, by the prac-
ticaljocularity of school-
fellows, on errands for
the purchase of those
imaginary commodities,
“strap-oil”, and “pi-
geon’s milk.” . It may
be feared that the
above-quoted paragraph
is the invention of reck-
less waggery; and, with
the wisdom which has
been purchased by ex-
perience, the serious
portion of the British
Army will no doubt
hesitate in accepting a
statement representing

REFORMING THE REFORMER.
(Improved from “Original Poems for Infant Minds.”)
O, WHO'LL come and play Agitation with me,
My CoBDEN has left me alone?
Industrious Working men, won't you be Free ?
Let us get up a row of our own.
O no, MR. BRIGHT, Sir, we can't come indeed,
We’ve no time to idle away;
We’ve got all our dear little children to feed,
And can do it, we’re happy to say.
Small Tradesmen, don't stick to beef, candles, and flour,
But kick up a row with me, do;
Those grubs will not fight for political power,
But say, thinking men, will not you?
O no, MR. BRIGHT, Sir, for do you not see
By our shops we’re enabled to thrive ;
The way to get on is to work like a bee,
And always be storing the hive.
Intelligent Middle-class, rise at the blast
Of the trumpet of Freedom I play:
I hope I shall find a disciple at last,
You are not so busy as they.
O no, MR. BRIGHT, Sir, we shan’t come to you,
We’re not made to cry but to labour;
We always have something or other to do—
If not for oneself, for a neighbour.
What then, they’re all busy and happy but me,
And I’m bawling here like a dunce:
O then I'll be off to where Members should be,
And attend to my business at once.
[And, my dears, being a strong and clever boy, he
ran down to his place of business, and helped
to move and carry several things that were
wanted in the House,
NOSE AND EAR IN HARMONY.
THE following paragraph appears in a contemporary:—
‘A NovKLTY IN IMITATIve HARMony.—After having introduced the Champagne
Galop, the Kisses Polka, the Cattle Show Quadrille, and other descriptive dance
music, accompanied with appropriate sounds, M. MusARD produced on Wednesday
last, at St. James's Hall, a Floral Valse, called “Sweet Briar,” during which MR.
Rixtº EL, the well-known perfumer of the Strand, diffused the scent of that flower
H means of the new process ho has already employed for perfuming the Lyceum
eatre.”
Thus, whilst the ears are regaled by M. MusARD, MR. RIMMEL,
administers a corresponding treat to the nose. This is a great advance
in dance music. BEETHoven might perhaps have indicated a particular
perfume by some exquisite movement which would have inspired the
same serenity and joy, or other delightful state, as that which the per-
fume induces on sensitive minds. But Beethoven himself never, with
all his genius, could have composed music simultaneously breathing the
odour of sweet briar, and constituting a measure for the multitude to
dance to. Beethoven could never thus have mingled sweet briar with
capers. Neither, probably, could even M: MusARD without the aid of
MR. RIMMEL. But if, wiilst a waltz is being played, a scent-pot is
opened, then by that means the connection of sound with sense is fully
established, and we know precisely what the composition means besides
tiddy-tum-tum, or whatever else it might signify expressed in speech.
A Sweet Briar Waltz, illustrated by the disengagement of real sweet
briar, º: been successfully produced, every species of scent apper-
taining to the toilet will soon be fitted with a dance-musical repre-
sentative. Not to mention the necessary rose and the indispensable
violet, we shall shortly recognise in every ball-room the aroma of the
hop, and be made distinctly aware that youth and beauty are toe-and-
heeling it to heliotrope.
However, dance music is not the only music that might be appro-
priately and advantageously perfumed. There are many popular airs
that might be thereby rendered very gratifying to the olfactory nerves.
For instance, there is “Drops of Brandy,” there is the “Roast Beef of
0ll. England.” Culinary, fragrance, and the bouquet of wines, and
spirits, please some nostrils more highly than the emanations of the
sweetest flowers. Alimentary and Terpsichorean music might be com-
bined. The Irish Stew Waltz would doubtless be a t, success—
the performance of the waltz being accompanied by the liberation of
the ſumes of the stew. It has long been objected to the lighter kinds
of music, that they merely captivate the public ear. Now, being per-
fumed whilst they are played, they will also lead people by the nose.
Since writing the above observations 't has occurred to us, that the
accompaniment to hunting songs might be so scented as to savour of
the stable, to which many are partial. Also that when M. MusARD at
St. James's Hall introduced the Cattle Show, MR, RIMMEL might have
assisted him in expressing the idea of it., The breath of the cow is
proverbially sweet. A useful caution, might be conveyed in the odour
of a quadrille, which might be called “The Crinoline,” and whereof the
olfactory illustration might be the smell of fire.

1T seems from the Police Reports that not less than 300 burglars
and ticket-of-leave men are enjoying themselves in Manchester at this
particular moment. That industrious town, with its azure sky and
sweet pastoral walks, always, struck us as the most charming spot in
the world for a residence, and just now that it is so full of company, it
must have still greater attractions than ever, We did think of going to
Hastings, or Brighton, at this dull time of the year, just for ºf:
of air and scene for three or four weeks, but shall decidedly give the
preference now to Manchester.
Imperial Reverses.
WHEN Louis NApoleoN put down the Red Republic, he was,
according to the priest party, the “Saviour of Society.”. Now the
Bishop of Poitiers calls him PontiUS PILATE. According to that
Prelate he is the Pilate of the Creed; whereas only the other day
the French clergy regarded him as the pilot who weathered the
torm.

F=
THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF JOSEPH HUME,
I SING, I sing, of good times over,
When we lived in peace, if not in clover,
Were free from alarm as to what the French meant,
And the popular cry was for Retrenchment;
en, instead of !. for new defences,
We tried to cut down all such expenses,
And, in the estimates’ construction,
Economists compelled Reduction.
Sing hey, sing ho, in sorrow and gloom,
For the good old days of Joseph HUMe!
When France was not than England stronger,
And we thought that war would be no longer;
When the Millennium we expected,
And our Army and Navy alike neglected;
Talked of swords into ploughshares turning,
And gunpowder only for pastime burning,
In fireworks, or on stubble or heather,
And lions and lambs lying down together.
Sing hey, sing ho! &c.
When young men thought they acted wise in
Cultivating Arts, and Arms despising;
When--ah, how much folks were mistaken 1–
Martial studies were forsaken.
But swords and bayonets in these days are
Furbished, sharp as needle and razor,
Soldiers and sailors all hard drilling
For practice in the art of killing,
Sing hey, sing ho! &c.
When old Brown Bess her purpose suited,
The Queen of Weapons then reputed,
The Rifles were a mere Brigade then,
Because we thought of little but trade then;
But now each man has his Enfield, Rifle,
And that, alone, doesn’t cost a trifle;
Then Armstrong guns, and shells, and mortars
We must provide to guard all quarters.
Sing hey, sing ho! &c.
When men would have been accounted dreamers
Who talked of a fleet of war screw-steamers,
When we, by wooden walls defended,
Against attack, on wood depended.
But now we find we must environ
Our isle with vessels cased in iron,
With iron walls must be surrounded,
That iron costing tin unbounded.
Sing hey, sing ho! &c.
When self-protection asked but flannel;
But now that steam has bridged the Channel,
Each freeborn Briton has occasion
To hold his own against invasion;
So Wolunteers have formed, are forming,
Like bees—with stings about them—swarming:
That is the cheapest way to do it;
But times are changed, and how we rue it!
Sing hey, sing ho! &c.
Naval Etiquette,
THE stern of the Black Prince, the new iron-cased screw frigate just
launched, is unprotected by armour. . It is almost as the heel of
Achilles; but not quite. The Black, Prince is vulnerable in the
stern. Unfortunately she is also vulnerable in the stem. She has no
helmet, which is worse than being undefended about the helm. There,
indeed, a British frigate is no more in need of fortification than a
British soldier or sailor. Our gallant fellows have their hearts in the
right places, and never would require to wear, breastplates on the
wrong. What if the Black Prince is bare behind? vessel of the
British navy never shows an enemy her stern.
AN OLD OFFENDER.
At a late meeting of the Geological Society a valuable paper was
read on “Flints in the Drift.”. An old gentleman who was present on
that occasion remarked, that he did not see the drift of the learned
lecturer's observations.
“A CIRCULAR Note.”—The first Circular Note, we should think,
must have been a Round Robin.
A REDUCED HIGHNESS.
º: Journal de Monaco publishes the subjoined imposing announce
ment, :-
“On the 2nd of February a treaty was signed at Paris, by which his Most Serene
Highness the PRINCE of Monaco cedes the communes of Mentone and Roquebrune
to his Majesty the EMPEROR of The FRENch.”
Even before the cession of the abovenamed communes, which the
potentate of whose dominions they formed part has sold to Louis
NAPOLEQN for £160,000, and a consideration of certain private pro-
perty, in land, the rincedon of Monaco was about the smallest in the
world. It is now beautifully less than ever it was, and its Prince has
become a sovereign of significance smaller than that very limited
amount that he had been previously invested with. It does therefore
seem cruelly ironical to describe such a Princelet as his Most Serene
Highness. Serene, to be sure, he may be, even in the superlative
degree, and his habitual serenity may have been much increased by the
Sum of money which has made him so much richer than he was before.
The diminution of his domain will perhaps have enabled him to see now
right over the whole of it from one spot, and to reflect, with stricter
truth and more heartfelt complacency, that he is monarch of all he
surveys. But to give this little Prince the title of Highness is to
mock the lowness of his princely stature. So diminutive a Royal per-
sonage had better be styled his Most Serene Exiguity. He was already
the ToM THUMB of European Royalty, and he now comes out as a
mannikin who has decreased from the standard of a dwarf. The
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH will soon, perhaps, present him with a
pair of Napoleon boots, into one of which he will get, and sink out of
sight, in that manner hiding his diminished head.
PREVENTION BETTER THAN PUNISBHMENT.
THE country is warmly to be congratulated on the great decrease of
criminal convictions which late years have exhibited, particularly in
the North of England. Owing to the praiseworthy economy of
Government, the allowance to witnesses attending Assizes has *
reduced to a sum which is about three times less than the wages which
a workman in tolerably good employment at Manchester, for example,
would earn by his labour. By waiting a week, perhaps, about a Court
to give evidence when his case came on, he would lose the difference,
amounting, for him, to a tremendous sacrifice. Prosecutions, as well as
convictions, are consequently diminishing at a fast rate, to the no small
saving of charge upon the County rates. Individuals may suffer from
depredations committed in the belief that crime will go unpunished,
but other individuals, in declining to subserve the ends of justice,
secure themselves from suffering severe pecuniary imposition. Injustice
being thus avoided, answers the purpose of economy. Some people
are not robbed if other people are. hen the insufficiency with which
witnesses deprived of their work are, paid, is compared with the ex-
travagance wherewith “compensation” is granted to legal practitioners
reformed out of business, it is obvious that the frugality exercised
towards the witnesses must have a peculiar object. This, doubtless,
is the prevention of overcrowding in our gaols and hulks, and the means
adopted to secure that end are proving very effectual. Let us hope
that the impunity of offenders who defy prosecution will never occasion
the ordinary courts of assize to be superseded by the tribunal of MR.
Justice LYNCH.
A TAKING FASHION.
It is extraordinary what thieves owe to the fashions. This is their
last debt, and one that they are never likely to repay, unless made to
do so by the strong hand of justice:—
“A noted French pickpocket, upon his arrest, declared his opinion that Crinoline
aſhords better opportunities for practising thefts on the unwary than any style of
dress previously worn. Being worn loosely away from the lady, ample opportunity
is afforded to cut the dress and get at the purse without detection.”
We are not surprised, however, at its favouring the propensity of
thieves, when we know that Crinoline itself is, in the #. of
cases, strongly attached to steel. It may be called the perfect pick of
the fashion.
Two French Idols.
The Senate NApoleoN exalts on a line, - -
Where if two names could stand, they would both be divine;
And a Bishop, affecting famatical alrs,
To Pontius PILATE the EMPEROR compares.
The abuse and the incense alike are profane,
But wisdom the Toadies alone would restrain,
And give the Fanatic abundance of rope:

PROPOSED NEW STYLE OF WHISK-AR.
our DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DeAR PUNCH, -
“The question What is a Pantomime? the other day was
mooted in one of the Police Courts; and though authors, actors, and
managers were summoned, nobody seemed to know exactly how to
answer it. One experienced witness stated that a pantomime should
properly have “something of a plot; and being pressed for explana-
tion of this perplexing phrase, he said that if two persons fell in love
and then jumped into the Serpentine, their case would constitute the
“something’ that was needſul for a ‘plot. Another thought that
Pantomimes ‘should have a simple plot, lovers thwarted. first by
demons and then rescued by good fairies;’ in which opinion, Mr. Punch,
I thoroughly concur; only I would add that, when the rescuing takes
place, the change of harlequin and columbine should be the work of
the good fairy, while that of pantaloon and clown should be effected by
the É. one: the latter couple being sent to plague the lovers in their
progress to the Beauteous Bowers of Bliss.
*But whatever were their notions as to what might be held pro-
perly to constitute a plot, all the witnesses agreed, that in the Panto-
mimes this season the writing has been quite a secondary matter, the
stage effects and scenery being deemed by far the first. Now, without
boring the ears of your intelligent readers with sighs and groans about
the good old Pantomimic times, I must just state my firm conviction,
that the Public like to laugh when they go to see a Pantomime, and
relish foolery and fun far more than finery and flare. If half the
money that is lavished on the Transformation Scene were devoted to
procuring better authorship and acting, I think the public would be
vastly gainers by the change, and that the Managers in like measure
would profit by it. However gorgeous it may be, of course, a scene
remains the same, and I think, that as a rule, one only cares to see it
once: whereas Ifancy one would go a dozen times or more to see the
ever varying fun of a Grimaldi. But while, a Pantomime is treated
merely as a peg whereon to hang some splendid scenery, both the
author and the actor are slighted and discouraged. The blaze of gas
eclipses the sparkle of their wit, and their invention is destroyed by
the thought that no one cares for it.
“Having done my duty by seeing our “great tragedian,’. I have
since been taking my pleasure by going where I pleased. . But before
I give you an account of my late rambles, I must congratulate you and
the British nation generally on the fact, that MR. KEAN has deferred
his trip to Yankeeland, and will appear in town next winter for a few
more final nights. Old Drury is announced as the scene of his restrée »
that is, if Old Drury have not tumbled down betweenwhiles. Of this
mishap, however, I confess I have some fear; for, according to the
critics, the foundations of the house are getting sadly shaky. One of
them remarked at the performance of the Gamester that his (the Grea
Tragedian’s) “intensity of passion caused the audience to thrill with
sympathy, and the house fairly shook with the applause which he
called forth’. Now if a part so flat and heavy as the Gamester could
do this, what must have been the effect of such a ranting roaring
character as Colley CIBBER's Richardſ and how thankful º the
renters of the theatre all feel that its already shaken walls were not
brought down about their ears!
“Without the slightest wish to make anodious comparison, may Inot
just venture the auricular confession of how my ears delighted, in the
sweet voice of Miss Pyne, after what had been poured into them at
the house so nearly opposite? And without giving offence to my goo
friend MR. Bull, or being thought to hint a sneer at the advance of
British art, may Inot also own that Außen is to my mind not quite
yet excelled by BALPe, and that, pleasant as Bianca undoubtedly may
be, the charms of the Black Domino to my taste are more palatable?
Such light creamy sparkling music cheers one up as briskly as a glass
of good champagne, and gives one no more fear that one will get a
headache by it. It will be the public's fault if the opera should not
draw; for I think that, on the whole, it is put better on the stage than
I have ever yet here seen it., I may add, the English Version fits the
music well enough; though I don't think, MR. Chorley, that a
Housekeeper “of the period’ need have been made to talk of some fair
girl as ‘that young party.”
“Another ramble that I made was into the Lyceum, where Iſound
myself exported to the Porte St. Martin. Clever they are, no doubt,
but I own I don't enjoy these blood and thunder pieces. When I go
to a theatre I like to be amused, and I don't want to see extracts from
the Newgate Calendar. Moreover, probability is always sacrificed to
stage effect, in a way that to a practical plain English mind is most
distressing. In the House by Notre Dame lawyer's clerks and mur-
derers clamber over garden walls with needless hurry and agility, when
unlocked garden-gates invitingly lie open to them. Whatever it may
be, the comic waiting-maid is º mistress of the situation, and is
not merely the confidante but mistress of her mistress. It is by her
permission only that her ‘young lady” makes love, and either encou-
rages to hope, or drives her lover to distraction. Norought any one
stare to see the waiting-maid turn flowerseller without a syllable of
notice, and then again be servant with no word of explanation, or
cause for re-appearance, except to rush into the arms of the comic
lawyer's clerk, and when the curtain falls to drop a curtsey at the
footlights.
“With regard to the burlesque, you remember ByRoN's criticism:-
“I saw the Crystabel:
Very well.”
“To this I need add nothing further, unless that the last scene (a
placid lake of looking-glass, with lilies cropping out of it) was in the
blending of colours, really very pretty, and appealed by way of novelty
to more senses than one, the nose as well as the eyes being assailed for
admiration.
“I have not space this week to speak of MR. FºcutºR (I beg your
pardon, MR. Turper, the name does not rhyme with," wretch stir;”
in fact, there’s no word in our language with which it really does
rhyme). I can only say Don Cesar was never looked and acted so well
as he is now, and folks who are not fools will not miss the chance of
seeing him.
“Yours, until the middle of next week,
“ONE who Pays.”
“P.S. Since writing the above, I find that I am censured by one of
your contemporaries for describing a new farce as being “coarse.and
stupid,” and for praising as a contrast the neatness of an older piece.
The writer grants me his confession that the farce may be a stupidone,
but he denies that (in his opinion) it is coarse, that being, he says, a
matter of ‘fact,’ and not of ‘taste;’ as though a critic and a coster-
monger saw with the same eyes, and coarseness were a thing viewed in
the same light by them both. The farce, moreover, he defends because
it is “original, whereas the other piece he thinks is quite unworthy ºf
one's praise, simply from the fact of its translation from the French.
Well, I don't intend to squabble, but I'm not disposed to grant that
original vulgarity is more to be commended than second-hand good
taste.
Acoustic Philanthropy.
MR. Charles KEAN announces that circumstances induce him to
forego his visit to America. This does much, honour to his goºd
feeling, as in the present condition of the Republic nothing could be
more undesirable there than a voice of discord.
ART IN ITALY.
We read that Gaëta is reduced almost to a mass of stones...The
next grand work, by St. Mark! may be a new edition of the “Stones
of Venice.” It is not improbable that GARIBALDI may have a hand in
the execution of such a work.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SMASH FOR THE ENCORE
-
SWINDLEA
E were never more inclined
to cryout Bravo! to a singer
than when, in the notice of
the first night of the Amber
Hitch, the pen of the Times
Critic, among other things,
informed us that—
“The house was enthusiastic in
its demonstrations of approval :
the applause was incessant, and
many pieces were re-demanded:
but the singers, in emulation of
the example recently set by
MR. SIMs REEves, invariably
and respectfully declined the
honour.”
Oſten as Mr. Punch has
inveighed against the
swindle of extorting an
enco, e, it delights him to
discover that his words, as
usual, are bearing goodly
fruit, and that the evil he
has denounced is beginning
to be extirpated. If singers
will but follow the lead of
MR. Reeves, and “invari-
ably decline the honour (!)”
of encores, there will soon
be an end put to the practice
of demanding them. It is
as unfair to require the
and “Angcore!” are not such good musicians
as BEEThoven or BALFE; and even if they
were, they have no right to disturb the works
of those composers, by getting certain passages
repeated at their pleasure, when others of the
audience may be annoyed by hearing them.
However, from what passed the other evening
at Her Majesty's, it is clear to Mr. Panch that
the encore days are numbered, and that another
year or two will see them at an end. If singers
will but set their faces against the custom, it
will be useless for claqueurs to try to give it
countenance. ... When it ceases to succeed, the
swindle will die out, and nobody of sense will
regret that it has done so. Seſfish snobs may
still go on insisting on encores, and second-rate
performers may take such calls for compliments
and stupidly comply with them; but Mr. Punch
feels sure that no true gentleman or artist will
long, uphold a practice, which all thoughtful
minds condemn, and, which is clearly not less
unjust than it is injurious.
A Species of Lion that is Extremely
Scarce.
The new sculpture-room at the National
Gallery is to be about four times the size of the
old one. Let us hope that its proportions will
be able to show off to the best advantage those
four lions of SIR EDWIN LANDSEER, which are
intended to decorate the base of the Nelson
- repetition of a piece as it
would be to ask twice for the change of a bank-note, or, after receiving a shillingsworth of buns,
to demand another dozen because they were such good ones. Moreover, music suffers by

to injure the effect that he intended. Now SMITH and BR.own, who bawl out, “Brayvo!”

so to do. As a step in the right direction, the step of the direction of
the long-blamed Eastern Counties appears to Mr. Punch to be worthy
of his praise; and with the stimulus of this reward before their eyes,
surely other boards will lose no time in following this course.
BRAVO ! EASTERN COUNTIES 1
FOR the interests of º: Punch has so otten found it necessary
to pitch into the directors of the Eastern Counties Railway, that he
the more delighted to award to them the kudos which by the
statement following he is justified in giving:—
“EastERN Counties.—It appears that the directors of this Company, at their last
meeting, determined to adopt a system of communication between the guard and
engine-driver of a train. This will, in the first instance, be applied to express and
fast trains, with a viow however to its extension to ordinary trains."
A REGULAR FOX CLUB DINNER.
At the Testimonial Banquet which, with a Table Ornament, was
iven the other day to SIR. W. G. HAYTER, the toast of the evening
ſº been proposed by the Noble. PREMIER, who occupied the chair
an honourable gentleman º: in the absence of any professional
vocalist, volunteered to oblige the company with a song appropriate to
the occasion, unaccountably not reported. The parliamentary enthu-
siast broke out in the good old hunting-strain:-
“You all knew Tom Moody, the whipper-in, well 1"
The idea of a “fast” train upon the Eastern Counties Railway is a
notion which has never yet occurred to Mr. Punch, who is accustomed
to submit, when he travels by that line, to an “Express” that stops
five times in less than forty miles, and is therefore to his mind a very
“ordinary train. . How long the parliamentary is doing the like
distance, Mr. Punch has never taken the trouble to inquire; but,
judging by comparison with other lines he knows, it can hardly be far
short of some six hours on the road. But though it, cannot be “the
pace that kills” upon the Eastern Counties, the accidents that happen
there have now and then proved fatal; and perhaps nothing will tend
to decrease their chance of frequency, so much as the extremely simple
course which is proposed. Mr. Punch, who is a not infrequent tra-
weller on the line, must feel of course a personal interest in the matter;
and although his precious person is abundantly insured, he cannot but
rejoice that his corporeal risk is lessened, and that his Judy may feel
easier in her mind than she has done, whenever he trusts his carcase
to the Eastern Counties' care. - - -
Mr. Punch would therefore in the fulness of his Joy, and in his desire
to give full credit where the same is fairly due, commend to other
rds the example he has quoted, and advise them in the like manner
19 earn his thanks and praise. As ninety-nine per cent. of the accidents
that happen might be prevented were more labour and more vigilance
employed, and were there not too often a cheese-paring of expense, it
tlearly is high time to call a spade a spade, and speak of RAIlway
Masslaughten by its only proper name. , Were there no endanger-
ment of human life and limb, directors might be justified in counting
up the costs and chances of an accident, and proving that it paid them
to incur the risk, rather than to take expensive measures to diminish
it. This would clearly be excusable, were loss of property the only
lºss that could ensue; but it ceases to be pardonable when there is
chance of loss of life. Mr. Punch would j."directors responsible in
Verson for the persons of all passengers entrusted to their care; and if
It was expected that the roof which covered the assembly would
have come down upon their heads, so violently was it shaken by the
laughter and shouts of “Yoicks!” and “Tally-ho!” and “Hear,
hear!” where with the honourable Member's performance was accom-
panied by the political foxhunters.

THE BERKELEY PE ERACE.
JUDGMeNT.
The Law Lords have given judgment in this case, which Mr.
Punch has taken under his especial patronage, on account of the ſunny
§: on which his friend the Old Sailor of Berkeley demanded a
eerage.
The LoRD Ch AN cellor said that SIR MAURice BERKELEY, brother
of the late exemplary lord Fitzli ARDINGE, and as brave and dashing
a sailor as ever lived, had taken into his old head, that because he had
got Berkeley Castle, he ought to be a Peer, having some notion that
castles and coronets went together. He, the Lord Chancellon, was
not going to enter into an historical essay upon the BERRELEys, for by
some accident or other, his historical efforts were not generally thought
so valuable as he himself knew them to be. ... But he would proceed to
the painful duty of informing the Old Sailor, that if he particularly
wanted a coronet, he must try after it in some other way. It was not
for the LoRD CHANCELLOR to point out that way, though he him-
self, having professed the most democratic principles, and nevertheless
having got two coronets into his family, might be supposed an
authority upon the subject. He had only to apprise SIR MAURIce
that his endeavour to “cut out” a peerage as he cut out the enemy's
schooner in 1830— ?
SIR MAURICE BERKELEY requested the noble Lord and lubber to
avast there. It was 1803.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR thought that it was hardly worth while to
interrupt him on a trifling misarrangement of figures. The Old Sailor
must be content with his laurels, and with having been publicly thanked
by the DUKE of MARLBoRough—MARLBorough was it?—no, WEL-
LiNGTON. Besides, he had been a sort of Lord, a Lord of the Admi-
ralty, which was a good deal better than nothing. The judgment was,
that SIR MAURICE had not made out his claim.
LoRD St. LeoNARDs concurred, for once, with the CHANCELLOR,
though of course the reasons which the latter had given for his judg-
ment, if reasons they might be called, were, as usual, utterly ſutile. #.
legal reason why the claim of SIR MAURIge must be rejected was, that he
had failed to show the discontinuance of the outstanding term contin-
gent upon the enſedffment of the non-entailed cessio bonorum pourautre
vie after the conveyance de droit under the charter-party of EDWARD
The THIRD had merged the laches in a general tenancy by the courtesy
with cross remainders over.
SIR MAURIce BERKELEY said that it made a fellow's lee-scuppers
run over, to hear a cove coil and belay such High Dutch lingo.
LoRD CRAN worth said that he did not suppose his learned friends
cared very much whether he concurred with them or not, but he was
entirely of their opinion, and thought that it would be a bad precedent
to conſer a peerage upon a gentleman merely because he possessed an
old house in which one of the British sovereigns had been killed.
SIR MAURice BERKELEY said, that if that lubber meant to insinuate
that he who had eat his sovereign's junk—
The Lord CHANcelloR must interpose. Eat a junk. Come, come–
they could not swallow that. He had himself seen a junk in the river
Thames, and though he did not profess to understand nautical matters,
if a man asserted that he could eat such a thing as that, he, the CHAN-
CELLOR, must reluctantly classify him among those who did not attach
due value to accurate representation of circumstances.
SIR MAURIce BERKELEY said that the ChanceLLOR was a sea-
lawyer, and he only wished he had had him on board the Thunderer.
What he meant to say was, that he had been in the QUEEN’s service, or
the King's, which was all the same, leastways different, all his life, and
he should like to hear anybody say he wasn’t loyal. His dear eyes!
LoRD WENSLEYDALE had had such a squeak for his own coronet
that he felt natural pity for an unsuccessful claimant. He had not heard
the arguments in the case, but quite concurred with his learned friends.
SIR MAURIce BERKELEY intimated his irremovable conviction that
they were all a pack of humbugs, and he should speak to the Queen,
bless her! on the subject. He then departed, furiously sending a quid
of tobacco into the left eye of the CHANCELLOR, as a valediction.

SIR. G. BOWYER'S GAMMON.
“As to GARIBALDI, he was a gallant soldier, and throughout
these transactions had shown himself single-minded, having at
lºst returned to Caprera, as poor as when he left it.”—(Sir G.
Bowyer–Gammon f Laughter.}–Debate in the house of Commons,
Thursday, March 7.
A FoEMAN of the Pope scorn pelf,
And turn his back on Mammon :
Not plunder to enrich himself —
Well Bowyer may cry “Gammon l’’
That faithful son of Holy Church,
O'er Papal wrongs still grieving,
Has other matters to employ
His rare powers of believing.
He can believe the rule of Rome
In Temporal things a blessing:
He can believe it’s good for sheep,
To welcome wolves' caressing:
Believe that Pio Nono's wise,
That ANTONELLI’s truthful;
That Naples sighs to welcome back
Her FRANcis, meek and ruthful;
That Roman freedom is a fact,
And Naples' fetters fiction:
That being gagged and caged and whacked,
Is Papal benediction;
Beliefs like these—not taking count
Of feats by saints and martyrs,
Wrought to force faith on Heretics,
Jews, Infidels, and Tartars:
Saint Januarius's blood,
Loretto's flying mansion—
Must needs tax gullet of belief
Whatever its expansion
That a poor gullet so abused,
Such mouthfuls forced to swallow,
Should close ’gainst simple truth is what
We might expect to follow.)
Th; i. who bolts swords may well
sore throat be complaining—
Nothing like swallowing camels,
At gnats to set one straining.
A FELLOW FOR A PHOTOGRAPH.
A PHOTOGRAPHER might have obtained a fine portrait of a hypocrite
by taking the likeness of the author of the subjoined letter as he
appeared in the act of writing it:—
“To the Editor of the “Morning Post.’”
“SIR,-It may be doubtful whether it is expedient to take legal steps against the
essayists, considering the delays, difficulties, and expense of such proceedings; but
there can be no doubt at all that, as one of the authors of this book, which has been
condemned by the unanimous voice of all the Bishops as opposed to the doctrines of
the Church of England, is one of HER MAJEsty's Chaplains, that it is the duty of
the responsible Ministers of the Crown to recommend HER MAJESTY, as head of the
Church, to remove this author, DR. Temple, from that office and dignity.
“I am, Sir, yours obediently,
--
“ University Club, March 4.” A LAY CHRISTIAN.”
There can be no doubt that DR. TEMPLE is the author of a very
objectionable article. His Essay on The Education of the World is at
once imaginative and prosy. What worse could be said of any sermon?
Indeed this Essay was originally a sermon. As such, says the Saturday
Review, “it was actually Fºl. without giving the slightest offence,
before the University o Öxford.”"The University of Oxford can
stand, a speculative discourse of no practical tendency and no theo-
retical importance. So, of course that learned body could see no offence
in the sermon which DR. TEMPLE preached, and has since published,
on the education of the world. There was no offence whatever in it
beyond the demerits of immateriality, prolixity, and dryness. It con-
tains no poison-except somewhat which partakes of the nature of
gpium, but is nºt so strong—say, as it were, syrup of poppies. Gentle
dulness would have admired it had it been j in a separate
form; gentle dulness would have liked this serious treatise just as,
conversely, gentle dulness ever loves, a joke. Doubtless many, a
Christian Young Man's Association, taking the abovenamed Essay by
itself, would have listened to it as a lecture, or read it amongst them.
selves, for mutual improvement, with great delight," and a sense at
least of considerable edification. - - -
How then can “A Lay Christian,” or any other Christian, request
the Government, to dismiss DR. TEMPLE from the post of HER
MAJESTY's Chaplain? It seems impossible to say. Private and per-
sonal motive, vindictive feeling, might prompt such a request on the
part of an enemy of DR, TEMPLE's; somebody who is no Christian at
all... Irate hypocrisy might inspire a contemptible snob with the sug.
gestion of º;', cashiering the victim of an accusation which it
is impossible legally to sustain. Actuated by these sentiments, a mean
malignant fellow might be capable of sneaking into, a corner of the
University Club, and there writing the letter to which these observa-
tions are annexed. As that letter is anonymous, it is the greater pity
that a photograph was not taken of its author whilst engaged in its
composition. For a photograph of that individual could possibly have
been taken, although the despicable humbug was working to injure
DR. TEMPLE in the dark.
A Rash Assertion.
THE Tablet says that the KING OF NAPLEs is suffering punishment
for the sins committed by his ancestors in contending with the Jesuits
and withstanding the Pope. Of course the Tablet knows that, appa-
rently FRANCIs THE Second lost his crown in consequence of having
ursued a policy too extremely the reverse of anti-Jesuitical, and anti-
}. The proximate cause of his deposition was his subservience
to the priesthood and the papacy. The successors of heretical sove-
reigns are not likely to be encouraged by the example of the KING OF
NAPLEs to return to obedience to the Holy See. It would be wise, to
be quite certain that FRANCIs is suffering for the sins which he has
renounced before making the assertion that such is the case, an
assertion which if incorrect is also injudicious.

[MARCH 16, 1861.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
~- HE 4th of March, Monday.
-- - A deceased Member of the
House of Lords, we refer to
BARON ByRoN, observes—
“We learn from HoracE, Horſe R
sometimes nods,
We know without him “MUL-
GRAVE." sometimes wakes,”
and when BARON PUNCH in:
serts “MULGRAVE''. instead
of the name rather flippantly
introduced by the author of
Don Juan, he does so because
* the dactyl Noºney would
mull the line. To-night the
peer whose second title is
thus poetically used, departed
from his usual habit of being
unwise, and brought the case
of MR. TURNBULL before the
Lords. He complained of
LoRD PALMERSTON, for not
having supported this Gov.
ernment officer, when perse-
cuted. Now everybody knows
that throwing overboard (we
- - - beg any yachting Lord's par-
don for using the word) a subordinate is the last fault with which the
gallant PAM is chargeable, but he is thought to have what he called at
the HAYTER dinner an Outside Conscience in matters of theology, and
this Outside Conscience is known as LoRD SHAFTESBURY, bishop-
manufacturer, Exeter Hall, W.C. In the TURNBULL matter, the
PREMIER seems to have been guided by his O. C., who is connected
with something called the Protestant Alliance. The O. C. defended
his Protestants for distrusting MR.TURNBULL (who, as a convert to
Popery is a good deal more Popish than most born-Catholics), but it is
also due to the Q. C. to add, that he spoke like a gentleman touching
MR. TURNBULL's scholarship and general character. But it seems to
be thought that it would be impossible for him to avoid trying to give
an anti-Protestant colour to his summaries of the Records. LoRD
DERBY could not resist the pleasure of making some smart sarcasms
at LoRD PALMERSTON's expense, and moreover adverted to the pro-
verbially irritable, character of Literary Men. It is possible that
literary men may be irritable, when their whole lives are passed in
examining either ancient or modern history, and in perpetually, dis-
covering that the most important interests of millions, have been
entrusted to and mismanaged by pert aristocrats or shallow demagogues.
LoRD LANSDown E thought that MR. TURNBULL was wrong to resign
and the Lords by 41 to 15 voted that they would not be further bored
with the subject.
Some persons who call themselves the Ballot Society made a com-
plaint, through MR. ToM DUN.com BE, that a lot of circulars which
they alleged they had posted to the electors of Ripon had not been
delivered, and they implied that the papers had been suppressed. But
as they were unable to mention the name of a single person to whom
a paper had been sent, and who had not received it, MR. FREDERICK
Pºintimated his disbelief in the story.
MR. GLADSTONE explained an invention of his for giving Exchequer
Bills a character of steadiness, by assimilating them to Bank-notes.
Mr. Punch would like to test the value of this º and GLADSTONE
had better call and leave a thousand or two of his Bills at 85, Fleet
Street. He then proposed to go into Committee of Supply, where-
upon
An Italian debate began, and raged to-night and on Thursday. MR.
Pope HENNEssy abused the Government for having favoured Piedmont
and he deplored the helpless position of England, who had alienated
herself from the Austrians and Russians, and therefore would be with-
out their aid in case of an invasion by the EMPEROR of THE FRENCH.
MR. LAYARD, made a spirited speech on the other side, and dashed,
like a Nineveh Bull with a steam-engine inside him, upon the advo.
cates of the Ultramontanists. He drew an elaborate picture of the
wicked misgovernment of the Pope, and told appalling stories of the
cruelties of the Austrians in Italy. SIR GEORGE Bowyer said exactly
what CARDINAL WISEMAN would have liked him to say, and the debate
was adjourned... It was resumed on the Thursday by MR. Edwin
JAMES, who walked severely into MR. HENNEssy, and paid a glowing
tribute to GARIBALDI. SIR Robert PEEL exulted in the freedom of
Italy; but the speech of the night was MR. GLADSTONE's, who vehe-
mently attacked the “execrable” system of the Papal Government,
and thought that it required less courage to stand under a bombard.
ment than to rise in a free assembly and advocate the tyrannies that
had been put down in Italy: the cheering at this declaration made his
concluding words inaudible. MR. MAGUIRE stated of his own know-
ledge that Providence was watching over the Pope, and MR. RoeBuck
—yes, MR. John ARTHUR Roebuck—took an Austrian view of the
question, and thought that we ought to cultivate the friendship of
Austria, in order to repress France. LoRD John RussBLL did not
believe that there had ever been a Government so “abominable” as
that of the Ex-KING OF NAPLEs, and expressed his belief that his
OWn W. had been a national one, and was *ś by the country.
MR. WHITE made his usual noises, and added that MR. RQEBUCK had
been won over by converse with Archduchesses in the “gilded
saloons” of Vienna, and also had returned thence with a lucrative
contract in his pocket. With this bit of petty personality closed the
English debate on the most magnificent events of modern history.
Tuesday. LoRD CAMPBELL moved the Second Reading of a very tiny
Bill for extending the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty. Apropos
of the word Admiralty—rather an offensive word just now—there has
been a curious nautical drama, or rather farce, played during the week.
A Committee on the Admiralty system was appointed, and one of the
principal witnesses would have been SIR BALDw1N WALKER, who,
when surveyor of the Navy, is supposed to have learned an immense
quantity of things which it might be highly advantageous to the public,
and highly inconvenient to officials i others, to bring out in exami-
nation. SIR BALDw1N is found to have bolted, in a very fast ship, and
the Government, urged by Members to catch him, sent the slowest
old tub in the Navy, for that purpose. Whereat people laugh, and
when Lord CLARENCE PAGET lays his hand on his heart, and like
Clown in the pantomimes declares that upon his honour it’s all correct,
people laugh again, which is exceedingly rude.
KossuTH is having Hungarian bank-notes engraven here, and the -
Austrian Ambassador desires to prevent a process which betides no
good to the Empire. SIR. RICHARD BETHELL says that the act is
illegal, but that there is no hope of obtaining a conviction, so LoRD
John will not interfere, but politely intimates to the Austrians that
our Court of Chancery is heartily at their service. So they apply to
WICE-CHANCELLOR STUART for an injunction against the printer of
the notes, MR. DAY.
The Hop people made a determined effort to get rid of the duty on
hops, but º *. declined to aid in any attempt to remove a
duty until the Commons had asserted their dignity and caused the
paper tax to be remitted; MR. GLADSTONE allowed that the Ho
Duty system was bad, but so were a great many other things, an
why, he wanted to know, was the Hop interest to be holpen first, and
MR. DisBAELI objected to any sacrifice of revenue, while we are in our
present state, that of a deficiency, supplied by a “temporary” impo-
sition. It is pleasant to hear the phrase applied to the abominable
Income-Tax, but though there is no doubt of its being an imposition,
its temporary character is not so clear. The Hop men were beaten by
202 to 110, and did not seem much consoled by Mr. Punch's mentioning
to them, when the numbers were announced, that he had just had a
despatch from Warsaw, and though the Hops were down, the Poles
Were up.
SIR $ons ELPHINSTONE then beat the Government, by 102 to 97 on
a motion for a Committee to inquire into the system, of promotion and
pay in the Navy. The authorities growled, and said that such things
encouraged naval officers to come bothering with their grievances, but
the House did not seem to see it in that light. We should like, to
examine JACK himself as to the whole Navy system, and ask him .
in his judgment our Fleet costs so much, only we fear that he wo d
be disrespectful and say that it wasn't us fightin' beggars but them
thinkin’ tºº, that cost the money, or some such i.
Wednesday—The House's Sunday—was devoted to a rather mild
§: the Church Rate Abolition Bill, which went through
Onlullûtee.
Thursday. LoRD BATH wanted to know something about the Syrian
occupation, and what Government thought of the evident concert
between Russia, and France in the matter. LoRD Wonkhouse de-
clined to say anything. LoRD DERby elicited the fact that in a treaty
we are making with France for handing over prisoners who escape
from Cayenne into British Guiana, we except political prisoners, and
as few others are sent to Cayenne, one does not see the particular use
of the treaty. Suppose, however, that a political prisoner, trying to
escape, polished off a gendarme—should we apply the rule sought to be
set up in the case of ANDERs.9N, the negro, who by the way has been
liberated in Canada, on a technical error in the writ of commitment?
MAJoR GAVIN, formerly in the Lancers, seems to think that MAJOR
YELVERTON, bigamist, is not the sort of person who should hold Her
Majesty's commission. CAPTAIN ARCHDALI, formerly an Enniskillen
Dragoon, thinks that nothing should be said on the subject at present;
The authorities suspend MAJOR YElverton from military duties until
the case shall be completely disposed of.
Friday. The Church-Rate Bill is to stand over till June. MR.
SHERIDAN wanted to abolish the duty on fire-insurance, . This was a
far less patriotic course than that which was adopted by his illustrious
ancestor, who refused to assent to the adjournment of the House

when his theatre, Drury Lane, was on fire. The proposal was rejected
by 138 to 49. But MR. GLADSTONE had no great cause for exultation,
for the next thing the House did was to appoint MR. GELLIBRAND
HUBBARD's Committee on the Income-Tax.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
T the risk of losing caste, dear
Punch, by being seen in
Islington, I the other even-
ing visited a place which in
my younger days was known
to people as the Eagle, and
by its habitués was called
more familiarly the Bird.
But as the *. is an
age for nominal development,
the house is now more
grandly named the Royal
Grecian. Theatre; a title
which might lead one to ex-
pect to see a tragedy of
AEscHYLUs presented, or to
hear the songs of the Birds
of ARISTophanes (birds of
what ill omen to how many
lazy students!) sung in all
the purity of the ancient
Greek. The only bird, how-
ever, that was brought be-
fore my notice was in a pan-
tomime entitled The Blue
Bird of Paradise, which, to
myself and , other visitors
arriving at half-price (this
privilege is here extended only to the stalls) constituted all the enter-
tainment of the night. Had I but entered somewhat earlier—but that
dry port of old BEeswing's is sadly hard to leave—I could have penned
you a description of Orlando the Outlaw, or the Orphanless Qutcast, or
whatever else were the name of the first piece. This, the bill informed
me, began at half-past six, yet I am bound to own, the audience did not
seem at all fatigued by it. Qn the contrary, indeed, the house showed,
like the Commons, great ability for sitting; and when finally it rose, a
few minutes before midnight, there was not that haste to get away, as
though from something tiresome, which I have often lately noticed in
more fashionable theatres. - -
“I am aware that I may possibly be charged with vulgar tastes, but
I must own that I laughed more at the Royal Grecian pantomime than
I have done at those performed at many another royal house. I was
however sorry to find that the opening partook largely of the nature of
burlesque (I can’t tell you how I hate these pantomimic hybrids
which to my mind spoil both *...) and it saddened me still more to
have to gape at a magnificent Transformation Scene, which taxed one's
º: terribly while being bit by bit revealed... I think the audience
ike myself felt it rather a relief when the Clown's business began, and
their long strained staring ended. The Clown too was as good a one
as I have seen this year, and did not, like too many, let the acrobatic
element quite supersede the comic. The way he did his stealing was
much more ludicrous and artful than I have lately witnessed, and de-
serves my hearty thanks for the hearty laughs, he won from me.
Clowns too often steal a thing as though it were their own, and they
had lawful right to take it... They forget too that a Clown, however
clever he may be, is essentially a fool; and has notwit enough to know
that a hot poker will burn him when he tries to pocket it. The
audience at the Eagle—I beg pardon, MR. CoNQUEST, I mean the
Royal Grecian—seemed quite alive to this. The loudest laughter won
from them was when the Clown, after endeavouring to pouch a mon:
strous codfish, strutted, away unconscious of having left the head and
shoulders sticking out, thereby attracting Nemesis in the shape of a
policeman. - -
“As an additional attraction to the City Road just now, there is the
fattest harlequinſ think fever saw. As I am myself somewhat
approaching to his size, and know what are the pangs of losing a good
figure, I scarce can tell if he more moved me to pity or, applause by
his corpulent, gyrations. , Moreover, worthy of no small, admiration
was Prince Pigmy, “once known as Hampdy Dumpdy,” the bill politely
| tells me; thus correcting the cacography I oftentimes have practised,
of spelling those two last names with a ‘ty’ instead of “dy.’ The way
|in which this gentleman, whose legs were doubled under him, hopped
and skipped about, and sang that wondrous song The Cure with all its
acrobat accompaniment, was, as a voice behind me said, ‘as good as
seein asparrer,' by which last noun the bird was meant and not the pupil
of a prizefighter. I must add that there was much less vulgar slang
in this Blue Bird than in most of the more Western burlesques that l
have witnessed: and with only one exception, so far as I remained to
see (I mean where Clown lifts up his petticoat and says something to
Pantaloon, who as Jack in the Green, is standing underneath him),
there is in word or gesture nought unsavoury or coarse. Considering
that the Gallery is nightly filled at fourpence each, and that only six-
pence is demanded at the Pit, I think this is a noticeable feature of the
theatre, and might be copied with advantage at houses higher-priced.
“The bringing out of a new comedy, with a new actress for the first
time seen in a new part, deserves a better place for notice than the fag.
end of a letter: but I must just state my firm conviction, that the
Duke in Difficulties certainly will draw, although the plot is partly second-
hand, nor is the writing quite first-rate. There is, however, plenty of
amusement in the piece, and it affords a pleasant means for MRs.
|STIRLING to appear in concert with her daughter, preserving. that
|relation in the part which she presents. The audience highly relished
the allusions to this fact, which indeed supplied a novel interest to the
piece. Miss STIRLING has bright eyes, and a pleasing voice and
manner, and will I think become a favourite with persons of good
taste.ºlt is a rare pleasure to see something fresh upon the stage, and
this her girlish artlessness agreeably supplies. I hope soon to see her
again, and say the word of praise her mother's acting merits, although
I think the play affords her hardly enough scope.
* ONE WHO PAYS,”
A WORD OF ADVICE TO THE BISHOPS.
DENounce Essayists and Reviewers,
Hang, quarter, gag or shoot them–
Excellent plans—provided that
You first of all refute them.
By all means let the Hangman burn
Their awful book to ashes,
But don’t expect to settle thus
Their heterodox hashes.
Some heresies are so ingrained,
E’en burning won’t remove them,
A shorter and an easier way
You’ll find it—to disprove them.
Be this, right reverends, your revenge,
For souls the best of cure—
Essay Essayists to upset,
And to review Reviewers.
PRAY PITY THE POOR POPE.
A Journal, with a name which we had rather write than endeavour
to pronounce, we mean the Oesterreichische Zeitung, has informed us
that—
“FRANors. The Second is determined to stay at Rome as long as the Pope
remains there."
Misfortune, we are told, acquaints men with strange bedfellows, and
some of them are not less strange than they are unpleasant. The Pope
has long been on a bed of anything but roses, but surely Boyſ BALINQ's
advent must add another thorn to it. It is the last feather that breaks
the camel's back, and his Holiness must find his weight of troubles
uite unbearable, now that he is burthened with the presence of young
}. We own we have not yet felt much compassion for the
Pope, but this last blow is, so terrible that it commands our deepest
sympathy. The absence of the French, who keep his Holiness upon
his throne, could hardly be more painful than the presence of his visitor.
Certainly if anything can drive the Pope from Rome it must be, the
sight of the juvenile ex-tyrant; and we shall not be surprised to hear
his Holiness is packing up, and that a three-pair back near, Leicester
Square is ready for him. Why, it would, almost be enough to drive
Punch out of Fleet Street to know he had that brute, young BoMBA,
for a neighbour.
The Music of Parliament.
The County of Cork has returned MR. LEADER, Protestant Tory
landlord, by the large majority of 3,400. SIR GEORGE Bowy ER has
hitherto led the Pope's Brass Band alone, but now his duties, appa-
rently, are to be shared by a Protestant leader.

CLERICAL REFORM AND ECONOMY.
IN an article recommending an increase of the English Episcopate, a
contemporary asks:—
“Whether, it is desirable to improve the tone and powers as well as increase the
numbers of these working clergy?”
As there exists a society for providing the clerical poor with cast-off
| clothes, the labour-market of the Church must, one would think, be
rather overstocked. , Apparently there is a sad want of employment for
Curates, who might chant, “We’ve got no work to do;” and the fat
pluralists might re-echo the burden of their song by way of antiphon,
in a major key. It seems hardly, therefore, desirable to increase the
numbers of the Working Clergy, unless by setting idle Deans and
Cathedral Canons to work. -
The powers of the Working Clergy might be advantageously increased
by the supply of the necessitous portion of them with sufficient food
and drink, which could perhaps be derived from the larders and cellars
of those round and reverend gentlemen who hold what SIDNEY SMITH
used to call the prizes of the Church—a sort of prize which the
...! to a shovel hat, of course, regards as the prize of his high
Calling.
The tone of too many of the Working Clergy, in preaching and
reading, is so objectionable that its improvement is very much to be
desired indeed. It is not to be distinguished from that of the lower
order of Methodist parsons—a melancholy mouthing, and moaning
aggravated sometimes by a snuffle. If this tone could be exchanged
for the natural and unaffected accents of serious thought and earnest
argument, therein would be effected a great ecclesiastical reform.
n the following remarks, from the same pen as the foregoing, an
undeniable truth is stated:—
“The question of funds is no doubt difficult. But it is not necessary that the new
bishops should have £5,000 a year until they are called to the House of Lords. Half
that income would amply suffice as long as the bishop was out of Parliament.”
It is certainly by no means necessary that a simple bishop should
have £5000 a year. There is much doubt whether the primitive bishops
ad so much in the world,—that is, this world: their wealth being
...” to have been chiefly invested in the other. A bishop not
obliged to maintain the dignity of a peerage, could, doubtless, very
well contrive to rough it on £2500 a year. Enjoying such an income,
indeed, a prelate of moderate hunger, thirst, and other wants, might
be very well i. to be a jolly bishop. Half of that sum, as the
stipend of a bishopric, would perhaps be sufficient to make many a
poor and meritorious clergyman, with his wife and family, happy.
FINE OLD GIRLS.
The moralising wet blankets who try to make young persons of both
sexes uncomfortable by continual lamentation on the fugitive character
of feminine charms, will find a refutation of their melancholyphilosophy
in the subjoined extract from the “Fashions for March” in Le Follet:-
“Welvet, though very effective, is only deemed suitable for elderly ladies.”
The proof of the pudding is in the eating; the proof of the velvet
must lie in the wearing. As velvet is only deemed suitable for
elderly ladies, the presumption is, that velvet is worn by elderly
ladies only. Then the appearance which elderly ladies present in
velvet is the only proof of its effectiveness. But velvet is very
effective. Here, then, are elderly ladies wearing dresses which
are very effective, notwithstanding the wearers’ time of life. Effec-
tive, in the serious language of milliners, means having the power
of attracting admiration, and not that of exciting mirth. We are
to understand, that elderly ladies, in velvet create the same sort of
sensation as that which their juniors dress with a view to creating.
In short, according to the Follet, elderly ladies in velvet look pretty, or
at least handsome. This consideration may encourage the younger
portion of the softer sex to dismiss all unpleasant suggestions as to the
ravages of time, and indulge the pleasing confidence that Loveliness,
in future, will outgrow muslin only to bloom perennially in velvet.

A SKETCH FROM NATURE.
(MoRE's THE PITY.)
PRELATES AT PLAY, OR PROLUSIONES
EPISCOPALES.
THE Upper House of Convocation was waiting the other day for the
commencement of business. Waiting for business is almost as dull as
waiting for dinner. “What shall we do to beguile this horrid pause?”
inquired saponaceous Oxon of mellifluous CANTERBURY. -
*Suppose,” exclaimed the mild wisdom of CANTERBURy, “we tried
our hands at around of episcopal epigrams?”
The Bench stood aghast. They were not prepared for so playful a
pro from so grave and elevated a quarter.
“Epigrams?” doubtfully faltered evangelical RIPON, “Does your
Grace think that form of composition quite compatible with our
functions?”
“Strictly—strictly,” broke in scholastic LQNDON, York, and LICH-
FIELp, in a breath. “There are the BRown's medals for Epigrams at
Cambridge,” continued London, “WAUGHAN won them in his second
and third years. Oh-not the least objection to Epigrams.” -
“No more than to editing Greek plays,” muttered paedagogic
MaxchestER. -
“Or to writing histories of Greece and translating Schleier-
Magººn,” murmured modest St. DAVID's. . . .
“At least it will keep our hands out of mischief,” suggested ortho-
dox HEREpoRD. -
* Epigrams! by all means,” chorussed the Episcopal
cnoir.
“Only give us a subject!” exclaimed ambitious SoDoR AND MAN,
anxious to distinguish himself in an entirely new field. -
“What do you say to our brother of DURHAM, and his latest exercise
of his episcopalpatronage?” playfully suggested the venerable Primate,
jºins awaggish poke in the ribs to smooth-visaged MonTAGUE
UNELM.
M. DuNELM coloured, coughed, but seeing that the proposal was
hailed with acclamations, refrained from objection-merely interpo-
lating—“Of course—any little family jokes on such a subject will go
no further.” - - - -
“Oh! Honour bright!” exclaimed with one voice the Right
Reverend Fathers.
But alas, they reckoned without their Punch.
His little bird, who is fond of flying about the Jerusalem Chamber
when Convocation is sitting, had winged his saucy way thither, and
sat perched above the chair of CANTERBURY while the Epigrams were
concocting.
Hardly had saponaceous Oxford, who was appointed Prælector,
completed his task of collecting the crumbs of wit which had dropped
from the Episcopal Bench, when Punch's little bird, swooping down,
bore off the batch from SAMUEL's slippery fingers, amidst a general
howl of Episcopal disappointment. The Bishops were baulked of
their laugh, but the public are the gainers by it...It is not often that
Bishops trifle-except on serious subjects; still seldomer that they
deign to exchange the dark dredging }. from which they besprinkle
Essayists and Reviewers with pungent and bitter Odium. Theologicum,
for the Classic cyathus flavoured with Attic salt. In this case it is
hardly necessary to add, that their wit is all the keener, as it is exer-
cised at the expense of a Brother on the Bench.
But now to examine the Episcopal performances.
LoNGLEy—as befits, an ex-master of Harrow—is classical.
heads his double-barrelled effort with classical mottoes:—
“Pinguiset ingratae premeretur caseus urbi.”—Virgil.
“Prophetic VIRGIL–thus may DURHAM groan–
I’ve pressed my cheese upon a thankless town.”
“Tupos 5 of Aeºret u' otºr evdépes obt' evörépp
'ov xetuºvos &ºpe—.”—Theocritus.
To the Churchwardens of Haughton.
My friends, you’re blessed like the Sicilian swain,
You’ve got a cheese, you ne'er will lose again.
Nº. “Wires acquirens eundo,” he dashes off a Latin version of
O. ll.
He
“Quale fuit Siculo juveniest tibi munus, amice,
Casews in tempus, caseus, omne tibi est.”
Bishop THIRLWALL, our little bird remarked, seemed to suffer a
good deal in the throes of production. It is lamentable to think that
after covering nearly a quire of foolscap with abortive efforts, that
mountain of erudition produced nothing better, or more elaborate
than the following “ridiculus mus:”—
“Complain, indeed! what lucky men are these !
They asked a mite, and they have got a cheese!”
Bishop PHILPQTT. (not Potts), says our little bird, long protested
against entering the lists in any such profane competition...But at last,
evil communications corrupting his good manners, even WoRCESTER’s
immaculate and anti-jocular spirit seems to have been infected with
playfulness. He has struckoff the following:—
“Apollos was mighty in doctrine we’re told,
hen doctrine was sound in the good days of old—
But there’s doctrine more mitey in SHAFTESBURY's sees,
For it’s bred by Corruption and comes from a Cheese.”
It is perhaps lucky, considering to whom WoRCESTER owes his pre:
ferment to the Bench, and the peculiar fervour of his Evangelical
opinions, that this epigram did not get wind at the meeting. It might
have compromised him, politically and theologically. Under the wing
of Punch, he is safe from the Record and LoRD SHAFTESBURY.
SAMUEL of Oxford has hit off the following meat brace of quatrains.
They read as if written currente calamo, with characteristic glibness:-
“The Churchwarden’s Petition.
“Prithee, my Lord, from your new Cheese,
Some scanty parings take -
And our poor Pastor's bread therewith
More palatable make.”
“The Bishop's Reply.
“Said WILLIERs, nothing can be spared
For these three pious men:
The Cheese that’s with my daughter paired,
Must not be pared again.”
Who would have divined the calm and apparently costive GRAHAME
in the following Tom-Moorish effusion?
“”Twixt a dealer in Stilton and WILLIERs prelatic,
One might think a comparison ne'er could be made;
The one is pure, pious and aristocratic,
The other’s a grocer, and lives by his trade.
But lately at Durham, that fattest of sees,
To say which is the grosser some trouble is giving:
The first, º a living may get out of cheese
While the last, as we see, gets cheese into a living.”
Not bad for a Bishop, we must say, though somewhat crabbed. But
“Nemo repente fuit lepidissimus,” Gºre may be expected to im:
prove. e are almost ashamed to print the last of these Episcopal
prolusions. We regret to say it is from the pen, of the newly-
appointed Bishop of CARLisle, from whom very different things
might have been expected:-
“The fear of famine sure hath seized
The richest of our English sees,

Accumulating Dams-on Cheese.”
It is fortunate for Bishop WALDEGRAve's chances of future prefer-
ment that this profane joke was not actually cracked in the ears of the
precise Primate. Besides, what would LoRD SHAFTESBURY have said!
As we have already observed, he doesn't read Punch, so there is no
fear of his seeing the unseemly joke in our pages, and we do not make
a practice of denouncing, like the Record's Correspondent. But we
would recommend WALDEGRAVE to be cautious.

A DIP in THE LUCKY BAG.
THE CRY OF POLAND.
OUR sympathy with the oppressed Poles, and our admiration for the
boldness of the patriotic petition, which they have presented to the
EMPEROR of Russia, must not blind us to the oddity of an expression
occurring in a passage of that document, which, § stated the
. and described the unhappy condition of Poland, thus con-
cludes :-
“All this state of things has forcibly reduced this people only to make its voice
heard by the cry of its victims, and thus it never ceases to offer up a holocaust."
So remarkable a word as “holocaust” can hardly be supposed to
have been meant for a translation of “sacrifice;” must be taken as
having been transferred derivatively from the original. The appeal of
a noble people ought not to suggest a conundrum; yet who, reading
the above extract, can fail to § struck with the perception, that a
people, in making its voice heard by crying out, offers not a holocaust,
but only a holloing? In the exclamations of a nation the “holo” may
be heard, but no one can possibly distinguish the “caust.”

RENASCENTUR.
(From the Saturday Purview.)
No legitimate amusement should be denied even to an Irish rabble,
and Zeus forbid that we should ask an Irish Chief Justice to be decent
enough to restrain a mob from yelling at witnesses whose careful evi-
dence or gentlemanly exterior displeases the conscientious and refined
dwellers by the Poddle. Nor, when a man who is unhappy enough to
be entitled to write himself “Honourable” comes under the unfavour-
able notice of the gentlemen and scholars of our Penny Press, would
we suggest to those Aristarchs an abstinence from a single jibe, a
sacrifice to a single rule of grammar. The Hox. MAJoR SILVERTON is
lawful prey to the Dublin gallery and the London literary man. It
would be impertinent to point out that the same Dublin audience
which made the Common Pleas resound with virtuous indignation at
the avowals of the aristocratic Lovelace probably adjourned to the
galleries of the Dublin theatre, and bestowed equally discriminating
and valuable applause upon the Archer, or Wildair, who in the
evening, vaunted, in far more objectionable language, far worse deeds
than those of the Avonmore cadet. It would be equally impertinent to
inquire into the family histories of such of the Penny Critics as have
known a grandfather; or to ask them whether their ownhousehold stories
enable them to supply examples of the virtue which they vehemently
demand from the haughty aristocrat. But inasmuch as we regret to
observe that, in treating this foolish SILVERTON case, certain writers
who have not acquired their views of English life from studies among
the shirtless rabble of a gallery, or from the teachings of the swipey
Gamaliels of the slap-bang shop, are inclined to join in the anti-SILVER-
ToN clamour, might we deferentially ask those gentlemen, before they
again put pen into ink, to listen calmly, and even tolerantly, to the con-
versation which they hear in society, and then, instead of penning con-
ventional strictures upon this impassioned Major, to consider whether
there is anything in the trial that really calls for animadversion. Never
mind virtuous platitudes and democratic howls, all very proper in their
places, but look at the facts in the light of common sense. Major
SILVERTON finds, or thinks, that thanks to the laws of his country, he
can repudiate an alliance with a poor lady, of whom he is tired, and
can contract an alliance with a rich lady, of whom he supposes he shall
not get tired. Is it not better for society º use the cant of the day)
that two persons who like one another, and have the means of making
their entourage happy, should be united, than that two persons of whom
one at least is distasteful to the other, and neither of whom have a
shilling, should remain, not in wedlock, but in juxta-position? As for
the remarks of the badgered defendant, made under the incessant and
irritating fire of a set of Irish bullies, judge them as severely as you
will, but judge them fairly. He was indiscreet enough to avow that
in the absence of “gentle” blood, he did not consider a social
injury to a female so severe as it would be if her º: like
his own, bore Renascentur on its shield. Dreadfully feudal, no
doubt, Paterfamilias. But when your interesting son, flashy young
Bobby, entangles himself in a love affair, and promises to marry
somebody whom you have not in your eye for him, let us hear how you
or your attorney will talk when the match is to be broken off. Is the
lady Miss. CAROLINE CRINoLINE, of Bedford Row? You will, dear
Paterfamilias, be as respectful and considerate as possible, and strive
to get back the letters and the pearl ring, rather on the ground that
the boy is wild and not good enough for her, than because you object
to the lady. ...Or is, the female, Miss SARsNET, his sister's milliner?
Well, you will not be very harsh, but MR. TAPEs will go to her with
£100, and order her to set up in Edinburgh or Dublin, unless she
wishes her landlord, to whom fe has mortgaged the house, to do on
the 25th *::::::: what will be rather disagreeable. But, O Paterfa-
milias, red with indignation at the SILVERTon avowal, is the woman
pretty Polly HoFKINs, your lady's lady's maid? Is it she who has
tried to entice your Bobby into a mesalliance? How soon will you
have her boxes in a cab at the door, and herself sobbing in the hall as
she kisses Baby for the last time? Yet you want to hang Major
SILVERTON for seeing a difference between gentle and Manchester
blood. Are you a humbug, Paterfamilias: We defend nobody, we
never defend anything, but despite a howling Dublin gallery and a
virtuous London press, let us say judicium parium, autler terroe.
Nothing like Learning.

households, and avoid
them, as one may there
- will always be mistakes.
Moreover, some ladies are apt, by the mere weakness of their sex, to let their inclinations
get the better of their actions, so that their hands are often guided by their hearts,
instead of being biassed by the judgment of their heads. . Thus it happens when a Census
sheet is set before her, Lovely Woman makes (unconsciously, of º a wrong return, and
states what she would wish to be instead of what she is. We have known jaiº in this way
so completely lose their natural control over their limbs, as to let themselves record the
somewhat startling information that they are several years younger than they were ten years
ago; while many a “little sister,” who, when
the Census was, last taken, was reported as
eighteen, has only reached in the past decade
the ripe age of twenty-one. Nay, in a case
which we can vouch for as having come under
our notice, a lady called herself but two years
only older than her daughter, and such was her
bewilderment at being asked her age, she
could not be persuaded she had made any
mistake.
Arising, as they do, from causes which are
quite beyond all feminine control, we would not
class these errors as intentional deceptions, nor
say too harsh a word to the fair ones who commit
them. ...On the contrary, we hold that to ask
ladies their ages is a most unmanly act, which
no woman of spirit for an instant should submit
to... As for censuring the fair sex for not
making fair returns, the idea is too preposterous
for anyone to cherish. When attacked on her
weak point, a woman becomes powerless, and
does she knows not what to escape the blow that
threatens her. Aim a Census paper at her, and
she sinks at once, half paralysed with fear lest
her true age should be revealed by it. In a
state almost insensible, she enters her return;
but, as its absurdity very often shows, she has
clearly not the right use of her senses in so
doing. One can hardly, therefore, blame her
for the folly she commits—which, indeed, is
the more foolish inasmuch as it is futile. As
every º the kingdom is annually
registered, it simply is not possible to hide one’s
real age, so as to be clear of the danger of
detection; and how foolish one would look if one
were found out, and then fined, (which one is
liable to be), we leave to ladies who read Punch,
and would not like to see their names there, to
endeavour to imagine.

THE SLAWE TRADE AND THE STATES.
THE questions, Who supports the Slave Trade?, and How is it that
England has failed as yet to crush it? being brought the other evening
before the House of Commons, LoRD PALMERstox proceeded, with his
usual outspokenness when foreign matters are concerned, to clap the
saddle of opprobrium on the back of the right horse. According to
the evidence he briefly cited and summed up, the Spaniards are the
ºhief delinquents, in the matter, though BROTHER JóNATHAN is very
far from being held quite guiltless. On the former of the culprits his
Lordship passed his sentence in the following severe terms:—
“When we come to speak of Spain it is impossible to express too strongly one's
sense of indignation at the profligate, shameless, and disgraceful bad faith with
which the Spanish nation have acted in reference to the treaties concluded with
England on this matter. (Hear, hear.) As far back as 1817, the Spanish Government
bound themselves to put an end to the slave trade, and received £400,000 as com-
pensation to those who might be sufferers by this change of policy. In 1835, after
the Government of England had mainly contributed by its assistance and protection
to the establishment of a free Constitution in Spain, we asked as the only acknow-
ledgment of our services, that Spain would conclude with us a treaty by which
machi should be established by mutual right of search, mixed commissions, and
the #. which the engagement of 1817 might be rendered fully applicable, and
an effectual end put to that slave trade which Spain still carried on, and which she
was bound to abolish. We obtained our request. The memory of the services we
had rendered her being still fresh in the recollection of Spain, she consented to
make such a treaty, and, if it had been fairly carried out, the Spanish slave trade
would have been as much abolished as that of Brazil. (Hear, hear.)”
“Profligate, shameless, and disgraceful,”—these are not very palat-
able adjectives, to swallow, especially, when coupled with the sub-
stantive noun “liar,” which is implied by the expression “violation
of º: faith.” The Don can hardly be a man of such proud stomach
as he was, if he digests without a qualm the hard words which are here
hurled at him. But that we know he owes us far too much to quarrel
with us, we might really almost fear that our giving him the lie might
le a casus belli. -
. Having polished off the Don, the PREMIER next proceeded to pitch
into BROTHER JONATHAN; tempering his chastisement with an expres-
§iºn of “regret,” as one who paused between his blows to make them
felt more poignantly:-
“I t to say that the people of this country have not received from the Govern-
ment of the United States that assistance which we were entitled to expect from a
They are bound by treaty to co-operate with England
Government of free men.
for the suppression of the slave trade by stationing a certain amount of naval force
"Pon the Coast of Africa. That engagement has been more or less fulfilled from
-
time to time, but the American Government have prevented British cruisers from
meddling with ships sailing under the American flag, except at their risk and peril.”
Another piece of his fraternal mind his Lordship thus gave BROTHER
JonATHAN:-
“My noble friend made not long ago a proposal to the American Government
which, if they had really been disposed to co-operate with us in the suppression of
the slave trade, I think they ought to have accepted. We and the American Govern-
ment stand upon a different footing in one important respect. By the Act of 1845 a
British cruiser taking a vessel engaged in the slave trade without papers and with:
out any indication of nationality is entitled to have it condemned by a British Court
of Admiralty. . The Americans have not that power by their laws, and therefore
when an American cruiser meets a ship even laden with slaves, but without any
proof of nationality, she is unable to do anything, because if she were to take the
slaver into an American port there is no American law by which a ship not American
could be condemned for the crime of en gin the slave trade. , What happened
on the coast of Cuba? When a slaver filled with slaves met an American cruiser
she threw her papers overboard, destroyed all proof of her nationality, and so foiled
and baffled the enemy. When she met a British cruiser she became an American
ship, produced her papers, and, though filled with slaves, defied our people to touch
her. Well, my noble friend proposed to the American Government that British and
American cruisers should always sail in couples, so that when they met a slaver,
if she had destroyed the proofs of her nationality, the British cruiser might take
her, while, on the other É. if she showed American papers and colours, she
might be seized by the American cruiser. (Hear, hear, and a laugh.), Our proposal
was declined, and therefore, as far as that method of putting down the slave trade
in Cuba is concerned, we have been defeated.”
On hearing this, we calculate, the thoughts of BROTHER JONATHAN
may take somewhat of this shape;—“Wal, stranger, guess as heow
yar PREMIER have a smooth edge toº his tongue, and haeve given us a
lick on it as smarts more nor than the rough 'un. By sayin' as we

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 11, Monday. LoRD CLANRicarde wished to know a good
deal about Indian affairs, but the Government declined to oblige him.
Mr. Punch fears that we shall soon hear a little more about Indian
affairs than is pleasant, and ºl. the Government think that suffi-
cient for the day is the weevil thereof, as the sailors say knocking their
biscuits. The Chancellor obtained a Committee to consider who are
really entitled to come before SIR CREsswell. CREsswell, about
which there is much doubt, SiR CREsswell, for instance, having in-
continently walked the Yelve Rtons out of his court, declaring that he
had nothing to say to them. This was unlucky, as we might have had all
that remarkable trial performed at Westminster, and MR. Edwin
JAMEs might have received the cheers with which the House of Com-
mons greeted the victorious WHITEsi DE on his resuming his seat.
Lond DERby sticks to his text about the houses of the working
classes, and insisted on its being made an instruction to the Lords'
Railway Committee to report how many people any new scheme would
turn out of house and home, and whether provision ought not to be
made for the accommodation of the expelled.

Mr. Punch begs to put the matter uncommonly short. If BRITANNIA
wants to rule the waves, she must pay for the honour. The Balance

The above lucid statement shows the entire case at a glance. There

A BLOW FROM ACROSS THE
WATER.
In the speech that ABE LINcoln made at
Washington from the balcony of PILLARD's
| Hotel (we call it PILLARD, for we had our
portmanteau broken open there, and innu-
merable º extracted therefrom), he
told the multitude that the Government did
not “intend to split hairs to deprive them of
their rights.” Was this allusion to “splitting
hairs” a sarcastic blow aimed at GLADstone,
who has a kind of copyright in that par.
ticular way of dividing his arguments? "We
should say that “splitting rails” was much
more in ABRAHAM's line. JUDGE Douglas
says that LINCOLN is so clever at that kind
of handiwork, that it was he who first intro-
duced the split into the Union. Of course,
this isn't true, and JUDGE Douglas knows it
isn't true; but it only proves how far the
mºlence of partisanship will carry some
people.

money wanted for the Navy was £12,029,475, being a decrease of
£ from last year's estimate; and the money wanted for the
Army was £14,606,751, being a decrease of £185,000 from last year's
estimate. The state of Army and Navy was explained to be highly
satisfactory; MR. BRight abused the House and the Ministers, and
the Services; and LoRD PALMeRStoN declared, point blank, that
France's policy had for some time been to increase her strength, so as
to be a match for us, and the only way to keep peace with her was to
make ourselves as strong as possible. Well, if PAM says this about
his friend the EMPERoR, we must accept the situation, and the better
educated among us must comfort ourselves by quoting Latin about si
vis pacem—which, Wiscount, does not mean a Peaceful Citizen, though
that is a very good shot ſor you.
Tuesday. MR. Tom DuNcoMBE moved a little resolution to the effect
that we ought to have a Reform Bill. Him and his clap-trap did SIR
George lºw is demolish; and MR. BRIGHT, the type of the Unrefined
Radical, having somewhat curtly explained to MR. ToM, the type of
the Refined Radical, that the proposition was perfectly useless, MR.
DUN combe withdrew the motion. Next did SiR GEORGE put down
MR. Slaney, who wanted a Committee to consider how to improve
the dwellings of the working classes. Then did MR. GIBson squash
MR. BENtinck, who wants the Government to interfere for the pre-
vention of railway accidents. . Fourthly, did LoRD John Russell set
upon Colonel Sykes, who had grievances about the Chinese War. LoRD
PALMERston obliterated SIRJAMEs ELPHINstone, absorbing that party's
little Navy Promotion Committee into the big Admiralty Committee, and
there was a smart debate upon the names of Members to be appointed
on the latter. The Government were quite victorious to-night.
MR. Lygon brought in a Bill for the Voluntary Disgavelling of
lands. The Wiscount, hearing the announcement, very naturally
asked, why a person couldn't take gravel off his lands without an Act
of Parliament, but it was courteously explained to him that the word
was not dis-gravelling, but dis-gavelling, and that Gavelkind, was a
tenure of Anglo-Saxon origin, and that lands so held by a man who dies
without a will go to all the sons equally, and if there are, luckily, no
bothering boys, to all the girls. He was further told, that all ſands
in Kent are “presumed” to be of this tenure until the ‘. 18
proved, and that disgavelling means the arranging that the lands shall
descend according to the ordinary rule of law. The Wiscount was
delighted at this acquisition of legal lore, whereupon his instructor
was foolish enough to confuse his mind by telling him all about

another queer tenure called Borough-English, and its history, the
result .# which was, that in informing ; riend MR. WHITE, of
Brighton, of his discoveries, the unfortunate nobleman stated that when
a man bequeathed lands in Kent his youngest son was divided into
equal parts, and buried in a gravel pit. So much for tasting only,
instead of drinking deep of the Pierian Spring.
Wednesday. The Opposition was, quite victorious to-day. MR.
Locke King moved the Second Reading of his Bill for reducing the
County Franchise to £10, and a long debate followed. Government
did not want the Bill to pass, but, being, of course, Reformers by pro-
fession, were obliged to speak and vote for it, a state of things which
was pointed out rather clearly than civilly by MR. BERNAL Osborn;
Lord John Russell indulged himself in an historical essay on all
Reforms that had ever been heard of, described the Chandos clause
(the £50 franchise) to have been “a subtle poison introduced into the
blood of the Constitution,” and pitched rather awkwardly into a detail
of Lord DeRBy’s Reform Bill. MR. DisrAELI was all alive, and of
course pounced upon the weak part of his antagonist's speech, and
complimented him upon his “extremely delicate reticence” in having
never before revealed the secret of his objection to the Conservative
Reform Bill. The “previous question” was moved, and MR. Lºcke
KING and his reluctant allies, the Ministers, were defeated by 248 to
220. Checkmate to KING. -- -
The House then began a little fight upon a Bill for allowing all
persons who object to Oaths to make affirmations instead, but six
o'clock stopped the strife.
Thursday. LoRD Lyttelton has a Bill for making it easier to split
up dioceses, and set up new Bishops, and the Lords Spiritual and
T. mporal had a couple of hours talk over it, and it was read a Second
Time by 27 to 23. - -
This was the Army night, as aforesaid. For particulars, see above
A CASEOUS NOTION OF COMFORT.
Ncommon is the
pleasure with
which we ex-
tract, the sub-
joined announce-
ment from the
Express:–
* The REv. ED-
WARD CHEESE, son-
in-law of the Bishop
of DURHAM, was in-
ducted into the rec-
tory of Haughton-
le-Skerne on Frida
night. The REv. J.
D. EADE, vicar of
Aycliffe, and about
twenty parishioners
were present. The
rector, after the
ceremony of induc-
tion, went round
and shook hands
with his new
friends, expressing
his conviction that
‘he should find the
parish a very com-
fortable one.’”
No doubt a
sufficiently rea-
sonable convic-
tion. Moderate
work and ample pay are material elements or comfort. A parish which
combines those advantages must be very unhealthy or barbarous to be
uncomfortable. A contented mind is a continual feast, and the income
of Haughton-le-Skerne ought at least to be capable of insuring that
blessing, unless ague or typhus or some other form of zymotic disease
is endemic there, or the inhabitants are savages who annoy their mis-
sionary. If the parish is salubrious, and the people are civilised, the
Rector must be very unhappily constituted to be otherwise than com-
fortable. , MR CHEEse would be ill-tempered indeed to quarrel with
his bread and butter, the butter being spread so thick as it is at
Haughton-le-Skerne. Cheese and butter are natural allies; and MR.
Cheese's preferment may be considered as their re-union. Let us
hope that the spiritual richness of the Durham Cheese will warrant
the high price that has been put thereon, and justify a Bishop's
patronage. , Why should not this Cheese become a caseous monument
of piety and preaching as well as of preferment?. In that case we shall
rejoice to hear that the reverend incumbent of Haughton-le-Skerne has
discovered himself to have been a ſº het in expressing the not un-
likely conviction that he should fin t sphere of usefulness a very
balance sheet. No Errors Excepted, as Mr. Punch never makes
any. -
Government introduced a Bill about the City Coal and Wine-Tax. It
is proposed that both taxes, altogether Thirteen Pence, shall be con-
tinued for ten years, but Ninepence of them to be É. into a fund for
metropolitan improvements, including Thames Embankment. The
tax at present extends twenty miles; Éat it is in future to be confined
to the police district. The arrangement is better, than the existing
swindle, but inasmuch as the improvement of London, and especially
of the river, is a boon to all England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and the
Isle of Man, Punch does not see why London, is to bear all the ex-
pense. It is like painting, cleaning, glazing, and oilclothing the hall
of a lodging-house, and then charging the entire expense on the parlour-
floor lodgers, as if the drawing-rooms, and even the stingy gentleman
in the two-pair back did not gain respectability by the outlay.
Friday. LoRp Wodehouse said that the account of the Polish dis-
turbances, as published, was tolerably correct. Mr. Punch is happy to
read that the Serf-Emancipating Emperor is too wise and too humane
to let loose his soldiers upon the Poles, and appears inclined to act
generously. LoRD CRANworTH has moved the Second Reading of thr
smallest Law Reform Bill ever heard of. It enacts that in certain cases,
an attorney's clerk, or law stationer, need not take his scissors and
make the usual fancy scollop called “an indenture.” LoRD CAMPBell
scoffed ...; at such bosh, but let it pass. . The Lords rose very
early, probably to go away and read the last volume of Loan
MACAULAY's History, just issued. If so, they acted more wisely than
is their wont. -
The Budget is fixed for the llth of April. The Miscellany of
to-night was various, but not interesting. MR. GIBSON brought in a
Bill for improving Harbours, which ALDERMAN SIDNEY said was much
wanted, for the last time he took tea in a harbour the spiders fell into
his cup uncommon.
comfortable one. We recommend MR. CHEEse to preserve all the

is expense. - - -
his successful ministry, he will then be enabled to look those attacks
over occasionally after dinner, whilst sipping his glass of sound old
port, and the recollection, of them will enhance the comfort of the
parish which he so naturally expects to find very comfortable.
YOICKS, YOUR REVERENCE I
JUST now that ecclesiastical hypocrisy is uncommonly rampant, it is
quite pleasing to be able to quote any evidence of straightforwardness
existing amongst the clerical body. There, is, doubtless, among our
English divines a party, however small, to whom the subjoined d-
bill will appeal as persons, or parsons, whom it may concern:-

CLEAR YEARLY INCOME ABOUT £200.
For further Particulars, and to treat for the purchase, apply to
MESSRs. , &c. &c.
The above may be abused for a simoniacal advertisement. If it is
such, the simony is all above board. It is not a sneaking simony. It
does not cant about the cure of souls, and a sphere of usefulness; it
does not mention souls at all; says, only “Population 300;” a popu:

WALKER'S
THE BALLAD OF ADMIRAL WALKER.
Now all you bold reformers of the Admiral-i-tie,
And all you gallant Admirals come listen unto me,
It's of a doleful history I am about to tell, -
About bold ADMIRAL WALKER and the fate that him befell.
'Twas in Admiralty dry-dock bold WALKER he did lie,
All at his red tape moorings a-stranded high and dry,
With a quill at É. mast head, a flag of foolscap at his fore,
And my Lords a firin' minute-guns outside his office-door.
“Now clear your ship for action,”, my Lords their signal flew—
And WALKER he looked bounceable as he’d been lookin' blue,
*Up anchor, lads, and load your guns, my hearts of oak,” says he,
“My Lords they have giv'n orders to face the enemie.”
But soon bold WALKER looked more blue than he had looked afore
When the Dockyard Committee down on his quarter bore,
A pepperin' of his topsides with questions hot, and hot,
And their sea-lawyer-questions a-pourin'in, like shot.
They raked him and they hulled him, and hit 'twixt wind and tide:
His tiller-ropes was shot away, his helm went yawin' wide;
And down come his top-hamper, and deadened so his way,
That damaged and disabled a sheer hulk there he lay.
Then up and spoke bold WALKER, “I’m blest,” he says, says he,
“If in a game o' bowls like this again they ketches me.
I’d face the French and Rooshians, if they was one to ten,
But the shot of a Committee I’ll never face again.”
“Refit your ship for action!” again the signal flew,
“Two more Committees bearin’ down upon my Lords and you!
It’s DunconſBE that bold pirate, and ELPHINstone also;
Spite of my Lords they’ve sworn to take the Admiraltie in tow.”
Then it’s up and spoke bold WALKER, “Blow'd if I do!” says he.
** Pozº fight, your ships ashore,” he says, “I’ll fight your ships at
And down to Portsmouth Dockyard he takes a special train,
And aboard o’ the Narcissus his flag hoists at the main.
“Now catch me, if you can,” says he, “the wind great guns it
lows;
But I’d rather brave the tempest—the worst o' that I knows—
Than face Committee's broadsides, the figures and the jaw,
Paid out by them sea-lawyers, with their lingo and their law.”
Bold DUN.com BE stood upon the deck, his spy-glass to his eye,
“Now, where's stout ADMIRAL WALKER 2–I cannot him espy.”
And Elphinstone looked larboard, and starboard too looked he,
But nothing of bold WALKER could either of them see.
And “WALKER! WALKER! WALKER!” my Lords began to cry,
But those sons of guns of Echoes only "WALKER” did reply.
They telegraphed to Portsmouth, but telegraphs was vain, .
They sent slow steamers arter, which they all came back again
And nobody has clapp'd an eye on WALKER since the day
That out o' Portsmouth Dockyard the Narcissus steamed away. "
The wind it blew a gale ahead, but WALKER didn't mind,
Along o' them Committees that was kickin’ him behind.
And still he’s somewhere cruisin' in the Channel chops we know—
Like the Flyin' Dutchman, stunsails set, aloft and eke alow:
But blest if into Portsmouth bold WALKER steams again,
While there's Committees to be met, and figures to explain.
LOUD CRIES OF “WALKER.”
On the “Railway Accidents.” Debate, MR. Jackson surprised us
by stating:—
“The fact is, the whole railway world is at sea."
Well, we should have thought the sea was about the last place the
railway world would have thought of going to.

THE CRUISE OF THE ADMIRAL.
BY AN ADMIRALTY POET.
How gallantly, how pleasantly, he boundeth o'er the sea!
From fears of close Committee rooms our Admiral is free:
You see he knows a thing or two we wish kept snugly dark,
So we’ve started off the Admiral, and cry God speed his bark
'Tis terrible to think from him what awkward truths might come,
What tongues he might untie which now are fortunately dumb ;
I would not speak with levity, yet own I feel a doubt
If even the Big Ship would hold the cats he could let out.
Tis he can tell what jobs are done beneath the naval rose,
Can tell how 'tis the men don't come, and how the money goes:
'Tis he can say of all our fleet what ships are bad or good,
And how, though iron's proved the thing, we still keep using wood.
'Tis he knows all our dockyards, and the cost of their delays:
ow bran new ships are turned to hulks, and rot in Hamoaze:
How clever schemes get pooh-poohed by some pert official pup,
And trial ships so oft break down, and then get broken up.
He knows how many millions in repairs we yearly waste,
And how old tubs are tinkered up with most expensive haste:
He knows of all our gunboat fleet how few there are of use,
How many paddles now won't work, how many screws are loose.
Were he before Committee brought, what tales he might unfold!
How articles just paid for, as “old stores” are daily sold;
The failures of our architects, and what their cost he'd tell,
And how a ship that ought to sail too often proves a sell.
He'd tell how in our dockyards, when there’s urgent work on hand,
There’d come one day a telegram the job to countermand:
Next week would bring an order to destroy what had been done,
And ere the month was out the work would be anew begun.
They'd ask why ships are fitted out, and when in perfect trim
Recalled, and all their hands paid off, for merest Whitehall whim;
Such questions might give rise perhaps to some unpleasant talk,
So we said–-His name is WALKER, and away he’d better walk!
We manned our fastest ship for him, the fleetest of the fleet:
Then came the cry to call him back: with cheers the cry we greet.
“Oh yes, be sure we’ll fetch him here—What ho! for sea prepare!”
And forth the tardy tortoise starts to catch the flying hare.
So gallantly and gaily may the good ship onward fly
That bears away our Admiral from the House its hue and cry:
And when the storm of rude remarks that threatens now is o'er,
We'll welcome our brave Admiral home to his native shore.
“Walker is one who Walks.”—Johnson.
SIR BALDwiN WALKER, says the Times, “has been Surveyor of the
Navy ever since SIR Robert PEEL's time.”.. Now, “Surveyor,” says
the Dictionary, is a synonym for “overseer,” and of this word John.
son gives the meaning “one who overlooks.” Referring to WALKER
—the writer not the admiral—we find this definition of the substantive
confirmed : and we doubt not that SIR BALDwiN, were he brought
before Committee (of which there seems to be not the slightest chance
at present) would show that it had been his business not so much
quite to look over as to overlook.
What Affectation 1
HERE's the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA_making a tremendous fuss
because some one has been forging 100,000,000 notes on his Imperial
Treasury | We have no patience with such affected nonsense. Just
as if so small a number as 100,000,000 Austrian bank-notes could be of
the slightest value at any time to anybody!. The Emperor has more
humour in him than we gave him credit for, and that is about the

from ancient Rome to Modern Athens, and, later, have not allowed the

. “I had just sold my first historical picture (you will find it described
in the Royal 4..."; Catalogue {No. 5099), -viz., Conon
rebuilding the Long Malls at Athens, B. c. 393,-when my old friend
Dick Dewbehay, of Trin. Coll., Cam., looked me up at my humble
studio in Soho.
“Dick, after having been twice plucked (and bearing that calamity
on each occasion with wonderful resignation), had been up for his
degree a third time, and had just pulled through. So, before entering
on his legal studies at the Temple, the youth had urged on his Papa,
MR. D. t that well-known firm few sºnº, DUMPs & DEwBERRY),
the experience of a little foreign travel. . The old gentleman, who has
a great notion of the benefits to be derived from ‘seeing the world,'
“expanding the intellect,’ &c., &c, assented to the proposition with his
usual -nature, and out of his own library ſº Dick, ALIson's
History ºf Europe (large edition); GIBBon's Decline and Fall of the
Roman Rºmpire (do, do. complete); Forsyth's Italy; SMITH's Greek

invaluable) Dictionary: without which celebrated works, as MR.
ReyBERRY, SEN. (himself an old Carthusian, and Honorary Fourth at
Oxford) justly remarked, no one possessing an average stock of intelli-
gence can possibly enjoy travelling in Italy.

about the sale of my picture, and having worked very ºff; for three
to join him—and, over a modest little dinner at the Chanticleer, we
agreed to start on the following Monday, and after staying a few weeks
at Porto Franco, to make straight for Rome, where I intended to paint

Interest.
. “To you, my dear Punch, who have no doubt made the very same
journey yourself. I will not recount all the various little incidents which
happened, on the road. Novel writers and lady journalists have
chronicled such from time immemorial, and to my mind the frequent
recurrence of the same species of anecdote has become rather a bore.
To SAM-SAUNTER, or PEREGRINE SMITH, who read these Fº over
their coffee at the º: Divan, or after dinner at the Pallas Minerva
Club—wha', boots it, I say, to these gentlemen, to be told how rough
the weather was in crossing the Channe
pressions on landing at Boulogne P Old CAPsicombe sipping his claret
at the ‘Wanderers’ could tell you a host of anecdotes more entertaining
than that stupid one which, D.D. repeats to this day, about the tipsy
Irishman going into the lady's cabin on board the Baron Nosey, or the
#.f mistake which the steward made in consequence of LADY
PRIsM's bad French; Those blasé old clubsters have experienced such
passages, and gone through similar scenes a hundred times, and take
no more notice of them in print than of a country cousin in Pall Mall,
or a charity sermon at St. Grimes's., So we will, if you please, make
short work of the journey, and indeed .# anything happened in it
worth recording, save that at Boulogne that scapegrace, MasTER
Dick, confided to the care of the chef garçon at the Hôtel de l'Europe,
(until his return) most of the calf bound tomes which his fond father
had recommended to his attention, in order to make room for some
ingenious French Romances more suited to his taste; and that an un:
Fº little affair occurred at the well-known Botanical and Natural
istory Gardens of Mabille in Paris (after Dick's second bottle of
Qhablis), when some, gens d'armes officiously interfered, and thus
delayed us a few days longer than we had intended to remain in that
famous city. -

forgot to ask for the celebrated mustard, which my old French master
BárheuB (he has never forgiven me) so particularly charged me to

sketch and an enormous dinner, we went down the Soane and Rhone
very pleasantly to Marseilles, and the next day embarked on board the
Crache-feu (CAPTAIN Bowles) for Porto Franco, having paid our fare
in the “aft,” including dinner, with as much of that quality of wine,
very properly called ordinary, as we could drink at a sitting. Enough,

it as a hoax. -
By the bye, LoRD John wanted a breeze for the Reform Bill, and it
strikes us that he has come in for it himself; and such an unnatural
parent deserved blowing up a little for abandoning his offspring.
Painful Imprudence.
ONE of the declarations relative to Essays and Reviews which, signed
by numerous Clergymen, have appeared in the papers, actually contains
paginal references to those parts of that volume which the gentlemen
whose signatures are attached to the manifesto condemn as heterodox.
We abstain from quoting the numbers of the pages indicated by the
reverend gentlemen. If Essays and Reviews contain sceptical passages,
Mr. Pwnch at least will not furnish them with an index.

A CHOKER FOR HIGH CHURCHMEN.
Cons|DERABLE ability is shown, by the religious newspapers, so
called, in catering for the theological palate of their respective readers.
It is possible, however, to cut hypocritical humbug too fat. For
example, take the subjoined slice from the Union, mockpopish organ:-
“PRAYERs For THE Pope.—We are surprised that the clergy have not publicly
asked the prayers of their congregations for the suffering church in Italy, and for
Porz Pius NixTH, so sorely tried just now. Surely, whatever may be the different
shades of §§ prevailing in the Church of England with regard to the Roman
branch of the Church catholic, and the Bishop of Rome, its earthly head, no High
churchman at least can refuse to supplicate the Divine Head of the one holy catho-
lic and apostolic church, that it may please Him to comfort and relieve our afflicted
sister Church according to her several necessities, giving her patience under her
sufferings, and a happy issue out of all her afflictions.
This lump of gammon is a little more than big enough for the widest
*Anglo Catholic” swallow. The most gullible frequenter of “S.”
Barnabas would choke in the attempt to gulp “the suffering church in
Italy,” and the Pork, “sorely tried;” supposed to be tried and suf.
fering as undergoing persecution and martyrdom. The very incumbent
of St. $º. t, if he has not altogether gone over to Rome,
can hardly hold, and be prepared to pray for, the temporal sovereignty
of the Rºman Pontiff. The Union, moreover, rates the understanding
of its subscribers ridiculously low in inviting them to offer prayers for
the Bishop of Rome, regarded as the head of one branch of the
Church Catholic, whilst they acknowledge the ARchbishop of CAN-
TERBURY as the head of another. As if every high Churchman did not
very well know himself to be disowned by the Pope as a heretic and a
schismatic, and was not aware that the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY
has been solemnly abolished by a Papal edict ...” that prelate by
an ARchbishop or WesTMINSTER. As though eyery fool, the greatest
in Pimlico, required to be informed that even if DR, Pusey himself
were to die in his Puseyism, his very remains would be denied burial
in a Roman Catholic cemetery. Pray for the Pope?—very proper;

yes, to be sure; along with Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics; and
§ will reciprocate the charity which the earthly head of the Roman

towards yourselves. The Union seems to suppose its party ignorant
of the fact that the Pops no more º: them than he does the
Recordites, and that he anathematises the "Anglo-Catholic". Church
head, body, and limbs. The Record, indeed, might consistently advise
its readers to pray for the Pors, without insulting their intellects.
Pray for those who curse you, would perhaps be the suggestion of our
evangelical contemporary. ...But the Union, in affecting to make
common cause politically with Pio NoNo, betrays, or rather parades,
a ridiculous contempt for the minds to whose prejudices its business
is to purvey. As a commercial speculation dealing, with educated
men, the pseudo-papistical journal should beware of laying it on too
thick."wº bº the Union's pardon if it is genuinely papistical, and

ATTRACTIVE NOWELTY.
A New invention, which promises to revolutionise the system of
naval warfare, is hereby proposed to the notice of the Admiralty. The
idea in which it consists is that of constructing an immense iron screw-
steamer, considerably bigger than the Great Eastern, to contain a huge
magnet, maintained in action by means of a galvanic arrangement
carried on board. The superior swiftness of so large and powerful a
vessel would enable her easily to overtake one of much smaller size.
In case, therefore, the Gloire, or any other of the iron-clad frigates
which our allies are building, threatened to be troublesome, the mag-
netic monster ship would have simply to run after her, and get within
hail of her, , when the force of attraction, would terminate the
chace. The big vessel would attract, the little one as a child with a
toy-magnet draws a little boat to the edge of a wash-hand basin. The
enemy might thus be quietly towed into port; for her fire would be
i.f against her gigantic, adversary, from whose deck shells
might be dropped, and prussic acid, cacodyle, and melted iron poured
into her, if necessary. She might, however, be safely suffered to blaze
away, offering her captor a resistance similar to, the kicks and cuffs
wherewith ºft. jº: struggles against the policeman who is
dragging him along. The expense of this addition to the Navy would
not be small; but in for a penny in for a pound: in for a great deal
more than tempence in the pound. What it cost us in electro-mag:
netism we should save in gunpowder, for there would be small need

CHARIVARI. 125
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
O, dear Punch, these
letters of mine are
making a sensation.
After what I have
both heard and read,
it would be affected in
me to deny it. Nor
can I conceal the fact
that what I write is
not very pleasing to
the press, however
welcome and agree-
able it may be to the
public. From the
tone in which some
few of your contempo-
raries have talked of
it, one would think
dramatic criticism
now were a close
borough, and that a
free and independent
suffered in it. It is
as though a cuckoo
had crept into a spar-
row's nest, and had
set the family party
all chattering and
chirping. One writer accuses me of paying very readily and writing very ill,
while another talks about, my ‘inexperienced prejudice,” and says my “gentle
dulness” has no discrimination, and only can defame. -
“I find these latter compliments in a paragraph which calls you “our satirical
hebdomadal,” and thus comments on your presence not long since at Drury lane:-
* The press has well nigh unanimously passed their veto on MR. KEAN as a great actor: the
public have endorsed this decision with a forest of hands, and resounding peals of applause. How
comes it Mr. Punch must needs creep up in a corner, and with one or two congenial spirits, hiss
when nobody else does?”
“I would that what this writer states were literally true, and that the press
had really “passed their veto on MR. KEAN.” But unhappily the press, with one or
two exceptions, has done just the reverse, and has “werry much applauded” what
it ought to have decried. In thus misleading the public to form a wrong conception,
the yress, as I conceive, has done itself no good, and has done the public harm:
and when the latter learns how it has been misled, it will cancel all its confidence
in those who have misguided it. The duty of a critic is to point out imperfections,
and to praise what is well done. But his standard of excellence should by his
judgment and experience be higher than his readers', and his remarks should tend
to elevate and correct the public taste. When he cracks up MR. KEAN as a “most
consummate artist,” he betrays a faulty judgment, or states what he knows is
false. The public for a while may ‘endorse his decision,” but depend on it ere
long they will use their own discernment, and refuse to be misled. Why I chiefly
blame such writers is, that the course they are pursuing is degrading to the
press, which must cease to be looked up to for integrity or taste. To applaud
without, a word of censure such a Hamlet as Charles Kean's, is to show a
thorough lack of judgment and experience, such as clearly must unfit a critic for
his post. Of course the public may º Bravo! without thinking much about it,
but a critic is responsible, and should be careful where he claps. It may seem
snobbish to quote Latin in answer to a writer who doesn't know what the word
“veto' means, but if any British playgoer asked me how to recognise the Hamlet
of Charles Kean, 1 would tell him, in the words of HoRACE (slightly altered)–
“Si quid novisti vilius isto,
Candidus imperti : sinon, hiss utere mecum."
“I have not yet seen the Chimney Corner, of which I hear good tidings; but
if people want a contrast to that quiet piece, I should advise their taking a seat
at º; Lane and a sight at the Savannah. They who like to sup on horrors
may here have quite a surfeit ; but they had better put some cotton in their ears
before they go, or they may run a risk of being deafened by the firing. “Pop goes
the Rifle’ is the tune throughout the piece; and when the curtain falls there is a
regular double-barrelled rattling fusillade, with the addition of some big guns
banging in the distance. However much one wants to emigrate, one would not
like to live in Mexico, if what one sees in the Savannah be a true picture of
existence. The scenery, indeed, must be worth going to look at, if it be only
half as beautiful as MR. Beverley has painted it; but a nervous man would
hardly appreciate its loveliness, beset as his each step would be with robbers,
tigers, rifle-bullets, poisoned flowers, and boa-constrictors. By the way, I never
saw a boa-constrictor on the stage before, and I must notice its débât as quite a
“startling novelty?” It wriggled through its part with all the ease of an old
stºgºr, and the effect which it produced was literally screaming. .
“As for attempting a description of the plot of this new drama, it would puzzle
a Machiavel to give the merest outline of it. Enough that MR. RYDER is recog-
mised at once as a hoarse and ...? villain, and MRs. Charles J. MATHEws as
his interesting victim: her husband being fitted with a harum-skarum character,
voice could not be |d
which enables him to turn up whenever he is wanted to
act as a relief to the horrors of the piece. Those who saw
MR. MATHEws in the Overland Mail may have some notion
of his power of adapting himself to circumstances, and
will hardly stare to see him emerge from swamp and
jungle, as cool and self-possessed as though from Bond
Street or Cheapside, arrayed in ‘zephyr coat” untorn and
a pair of spotless boots. Nor, after the first act or two,
will they much wonder at the other miracles they witness;
as, for instance, troops of ballet-girls appearing in full fig
in the middle of a prairie: both ruffians and rescuers
again alive and kicking, whom they a while ago beheld,
‘before their very eyes,” shot, drowned, poisoned, thrown
down, torrents, tied upon wild horses, brained with mas-
siye (saw-dust) boulders, or hurled headlong into chasms
of unfathomable depth. It may seem strange, and not
quite natural, that a score of well-armed ruffians should
wait for night to lie in ambush for a couple of Cockney
tºurists, whose only weapons were a pistol and a Post.
Q/ice Directory; but nature in these cases must give way
to stage effect; and when four men, dodge round tree-
trunks in the Yankee style of duelling, we must not
wonder to see one of them rush out of his hiding-place,
make full. A minute's speech of most unbearable abuse,
and not, till then be shot at (and missed at three yards
istance) when he had quite finished it. This quadrangular
combat, which comes by way of climax to the comic
situations, gave me a new insight into backwood fighting.
I was not aware before that, in ‘primeval forests,’ rifles,
ready-loaded, grew behind the trees; yet that such must
be the case was clearly shown in the Savannah, for at
least a dozen shots were fired by the four duellists, and
I am quite certain that not one of them re-loaded.
“Altogether I must own that I relished the Savannah
much more than I did Hamlet, as seen lately at this theatre,
although some parts of the latter were vastly entertaining,
and I think, too, the subordinates engaged at Drury Lane
are seen to more advantage in such pieces than in Shaks-
PEARE.
“To close the evening's entertainment, which was over
very rationally soon after eleven—(I wish that every cur-
tain would drop as the clock strikes) there was some
pleasant dancing by MADLLE. Di RHoNA, who is both quick
and graceful in what she undertakes. It is not often that
these epithets can with truth be coupled, and when I say
that this young dancer can use her tongue well-nigh as
neatly as she can her legs, I am giving her more praise than
most of her profession are likely to deserve. I may add
Le Roi des Pierrots is quite worth staying to see, and does
credit to the comic powers of Monsieur KNAAck, who
besides the talent for arranging pretty groups, has himself
decidedly a knaack of comic dancing.
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
ASTONISHING BLUNDER.
Bishop TRoweR, in introducing the clerical deputation
which waited upon the ARchbishop of CANTERBURY the
other day to deliver their protest, against Essays and
Reviews, observed that the address they had assembled to
present had been signed by “nearly 8000 of the clergy,
including. Deans, Archdeacons, and . Professors at the
Universities of every shade of opinion.” . The Bishop
might as well have said nothing about the different shades
of opinion prevalent amongst his associates. To so many
various shades what is the addition of one more shade,
lighter or darker? It is difficult to see how a body of
every shade of opinion can unite in condemning any shade
of opinion; and if they do, one would feel disposed to

A New Point of View.
We have often heard persons say, “Oh! I saw it at
once with half an eye.” Now we never could make out
what “half an eye” was; for though, we have seen all
kinds of eyes, yet we never recollect having seen half a
one, unless rººf. it was what children call a bull's-eye.

GLANCING at the Era, the other day at breakfast, we found that our
digestion was considerably disturbed by this startling bit of news:–

attended to.—P.S. Engagement in Scotland or Ireland preferred.

HOW TO
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 18, Monday. The Schleswig-Holstein question is making
LoRD ELLENBoRough uncomfortable, and he thinks that the Prussians
are disposed to begin a war with Denmark, that in this case France
will take part with the latter, and so a general disturbance will be
brought on. LoRD Wodehouse endeavoured to calm the elephantine
mind by informing, its owner that the KING OF DENMARK made an
important concession as to the taxation grievance in Holstein, and
there were hopes of a pacific termination of the affair.
In both Houses to-night Addresses of Condolence were
voted to HER MAJesty, who, on the preceding Saturday,
had been deprived of her admirable parent, the Duchess
of KENT. LoRD GRANVILLE and LoRD DERby, in the
House of Lords, and LoRD PALMERston and MR. Dis-
RAELI, in the House of Commons, gave graceful expression
to the ſºlº with which the sorrows of the QUEEN are
regarded by her people.
The Commons worked at the Bankruptcy Bill, which, aſter a great
deal of discussion, went through Committee, but with reservations of
important clauses. Later in the week these came in again, and SIR
Hugh CAIRNs compelled the abandonment of the proposed provisions
for dealing with the insolvent estates of deceased persons, which bits of
the Bill were melodramatically called the Dead Man's clauses. There
is still great uneasiness felt lest the Bill should give a tradesman
power to turn a gentleman into a bankrupt while he is away at Baden
or on the moors, and in the course of one of the debates Sir Richard
BETHELL told MR. Roebuck that there was no more danger of such
a thing than there was of MR. Roebuck's being made bankrupt while
he was away in Austria, being petted by archduchesses in gilded
saloons, a poke which amused the House. Finally, after various
divisions, it was arranged that the Bill should be re-printed, and the
Third Reading taken directly after Easter. Such is the progress of the
real measure of the session.
Tuesday... One for the Dissenting Nob. The Second Reading of a
Bill for making people on their taking certain offices (not chambers
Wiscount, but situations) take also vows not to injure the Church o
England, was moved by Lord TAUNTON, and opposed by LoRD
Chelmsford, who insisted that the time when Dissenters were doing
their hardest to upset the Church, was not the time to make con-
cessions to them;. A majority of the lords, 49 to 38, took the same
view, and the Bill was sent flying.
When the Afghanistan business had to be discussed, years ago, the
despatches of SiR ALExANDER BURNEs were published for the use of
Parliament. But the editors of the work, being ministers, and much
more concerned to vindicate themselves than to save the reputation of
SIR ALEXANDER, cut down his matter with exceeding freedom. The
excised portions of the correspondence are stated to place SIR. A. B.'s
character in a yery different light from that in which it stood at the
time, and his friends are naturally anxious to have the subject investi-
ated. Mr. DUNLOP brought the question up, and some very strong
anguage was used on both sides. RD PALMERston defending the
mutilation, and being much abused, therefore, by MR. BRIGHT, who
declared that a felonious offence had been committed. MR DISRAELI
came to the rescue after his peculiar fashion, and demanded why M.R.
BRIGHT, if he thought LoRD PALMERSTON a F. to felony, had voted
confidence in him a couple of years ago? Two divisions were taken,
but 158 to 61, and 159 to 49 are numbers that show how little the
House is induced to rake up old grievances.
Wednesday. SIR, John TRELAwNY desires to introduce reforms
into the system of County Rating, and to give the rate-payers some
little control over the magistrates. SIR John PAKINGTON, for the
county gentlemen, has no idea of any such impertinence, and the
second baronet beat the first, and the Bill by which it was proposed to
effect the purpose was rejected on Second Reading. A MR. BEST
seems to have given, PAKINGTON and, the Worcester magnates vast
offence by alleging that they govern by means of a clique, to which
the other justices are subservient, and SIR John declared that...MR.
Best's allegation was a falsehood, and that he was a baffled candidate
for office. The second part of the proposition may be true, and yet the
first may not be; but there is nothing like imputing motives, the

generous British public likes personal charges, and usually interests
itself º times more about them than about the principles involved in
a quarrel.
Thursday. Those disreputable islanders, the Ionians, have been
making another demonstration, insulting British rule, and clamouring
about being annexed to Greece. The Lord High Commissioner, SIR
HENRY STORKs, has very properly shut them * by shutting up the
Assembly in which their antics are performed. It is difficult to make
the Ionian idiots understand that England would as soon wash her
hands of them as not, but that she keeps the islands, by the particular
desire of certain persons of distinction, in order to be ready to protect
the Mediterranean against certain other persons of distinction, and b
therefore all the capering and vapouring of the Ionians is beside the
uestion. The Duke of Newcastle ãi not say this, in answer to
of D NoFMANBy, but had better have done so, and hereby receives
Mr. Punch's permission to say it the next time NormanBy talks non-
sense—a date by no means resembling the Greek kalends. -
The Lords, by a majority of 33 to 25, threw out a useful Bill for
demolishing Holywell Street and widening the Strand. LoRD REDEs-
DALE opposed the measure, saying that private persons ought not to
have compulsory powers to take the property of other persons. Con;
sidering that this is exactly what every railway company is empowered
to do, the objection seems futile; but what is the use of reasoning
with a Lord who can command a majority. Two Cabinet Ministers
spoke for the measure, which it may be supposed is merely postponed,
as the foulness for which REDESDALE made fight is becoming intoler-
able. That night Holywell Street was illuminated, LORD REDESDALE's
health was drunk in flowing kevarterns of gin, several shovels of
potatoe-parings were given away to the poor, and the utmost enthusiasm
prevailed until the Police arrived.
MR. BERKELEY asked SIR. G. C. Lewis why theatres are closed
when Royal deaths occur, and music-halls and casinoes are left open?
SIR GEORGE explained that the authorities had power to interfere only
with the more reputable places of entertainment; but he had an idea
of legislating. While he is about it, could he do anything in favour of
the unfortunate actors and actresses, who are the only people in
London who have real and personal, cause to mourn such events; for
they have their salaries cut off on the night of the demise and on that
of the funeral. As Managers profit hugely by the visits of Royalty to
the theatres, and the fashion thereby set, a brief clause, hinting that
fair play might be shown to the actors when Royalty departs this life,
would be extremely popular in the Green Room.
MR. SPOONER announced that he should not bring in a Maynooth
Bill, for the reason that his eyesight was not good enough to enable
him to read the documents by which he must enforce his arguments.

Bills, The Consolidated Fund, £4,000,000, the Enclosure, the Bank

CHANCELLOR did not ask the SPEAKER to take a seat on the Woolsack,
the Hon. Gentleman returned to his own easy-chair in the House of
Commons. EARL DE GREY snubbed ELLENBöRough, who asked for
some inconvenient papers, and several petitions on the subject of the
Church Rates were put into the waste-paper basket. LoRD STRAT-
FoRD DE REDCLIFFE was told to wait till after Easter, for some
information he required about the occupation of Syria. . After a little

FASHIONS FOR FESTIVALS.
THE subjoined announcement, mutatis mutandis, that is to say with
change only of names, lately appeared in the advertising columns of
the English Churchman:—
URPLICES.–SURPLICEs. For EASTER.—MEssRs. FALDERAL & SoN
*) have prepared their usuallarge supply of SURPlices of superior form and quality,
so much admired.
There are supposed to be some old women, among the Clergy; but
the above advertisement seems to indicate that there are also many
young ladies. Here we have linendrapers announcing themselves as
having prepared for Easter their usual large supply of surplices, and
describing those surplices in just the very terms which the trade applies
to silks and muslins. What is the material which forms the fabric of
these surplices of “superior” form and quality, “so much admired.”
Is it chintz? Fancy a lot of young parsons collected together and
staring in at MEssRs. FALDERAL & Son's window, or being taken by
female friends to the establishment of that enterprising concern,
shopping. Imagine the assistants behind the counter saying, “Any
other article to-day, Sir?—allow me to tempt you with an alb. Sweet
things in stoles, Sir! Neat dalmatics, Sir; very chaste! Pretty
atterns for chasubles, Sir; charming copes; last Spring fashions from
aris and novelties from Rome.” Now that we see surplices adver-
tised in the regular slang of milliners, we can quite understand the
feeling with which a certain rector whose bishop had compelled him to
relinquish his pretty robes, pathetically observed that he should never
wear those beautiful vestments again. We suppose we shall soon
have divines of this class sporting flounces on their frocks, and eccle:
siastical emporiums and depôts puffing their “Crinoline for Cassocks.”
AN EQUIWOCAL COMPLIMENT.
THE EARL of SHELBURNE, in moving the second reading of the
Metropolitan Central Hotel Company Bill, (which we are extremely
sorry was thrown out, inasmuch as "..."; would have been better
than two large tainted blocks of buildings that are a disgrace to any
moral city) remarked that-
“It would be a benefit on the public by opening up the wretched neighbourhood
of Wych Street and Holywell Street, with which their Lordships were no doubt well
acquainted.”
Were their Lordships flattered with this delicate allusion? Shall
we be ill-natured and say that their Lordships must have been “well
acquainted” with them, inasmuch as they refused, from the force of |
long association, or the spirit of friendship inspired by the acquaintance
of many years, to part with a single brick, of them? That incubus of
pollution is still to remain. Who would have thought that Holywell
Street and Wych Street would have had grateful reason to exclaim:—
“Thank Heaven! we have a House of Lords.” Where, might we
ask, were the Bishops on the above occasion?
DOTAGE AND DOTATION.
On the Qxford Circuit, at Stafford, the other day, occurred a case of
Breach of Promise of Marriage, the issue whereof is a signal example
of the generous sympathies of British Jurymen considered as husbands
and fathers. MR., SERJEANT Piggott appeared for the interesting
plaintiff, and according to report—
“In opening the plaintiff's case, the learned Serjeant stated that the plaintiff,
MARLAN HANLEY, was about twenty-one years of age, and the daughter of JAMEs
HANLEY, a farmer, under the EARL of BRADroRD, at Brancote, in Staffordshire.
Defendant occupied an adjoining farm of 180 or 200 acres, was about 75 years of age,
and had been all his life a Bachelor.”
Young SMITH, the defendant, had trifled with the affections of the
confiding girl who sued him for £500 damage done to her tenderest
feelings by the inconstancy of this boy of 75. The fickle youth acknow-
ledged fifty pounds' worth of damages, and paid that sum into Court.
The Jury, however, estimated the blighted hopes and lacerated heart
of the deserted one at a higher figure, and gave her a verdict for an
additional hundred pounds. Henceforth let thoughtless youngsters
like MR. SMITH take care how they flurt with maidens of 21, and raise
expectations which are destined never to be realised.
This case was tried before MR. BARON WILDE, and the report
whence the above particulars are taken informs us that—
“The Judge, in summing up, remarked upon the fact that the counsel on both
sides had made fun of the defendant; one with the idea of increasing, and the other
with the idea of decreasing the damages. . It appeared, however, to be a regular
straightforward affair, and he did not think there was any justification for accusing
the parents of any mercenary feeling."
Certainly not. Of course the learned Baron was thinking of MARINo
FALIERo and his juvenile wife. Why should not an English girl as
well as a Venetian, be inspired with a passion regardless of disparity of
years? ... So, no doubt, his Lordship reasoned, and supposed the disin-
terested parents of Miss HANLEY to have reasoned also when they
consented to their child's union with a gentleman of between seventy
and eighty. He believed that they purely consulted their daughter's
happiness in sanctioning her romantic attachment.
It is possible that the Jury took another view of the case, although
they arrived at the same practical conclusion as that indicated by the
|Judge. Very likely they considered that a man of 75 has overlived the
appointed time of man's life by five years, so that if he breaks a
promise of marriage, involving, as it did in this instance, a promise of
settlement, he inflicts a two-fold disappointment upon a young woman.
He has already one foot in the grave; he must soon draw in the other.
He disappoints the fond creature, whom he jilts, of being his young
wife, and he likewise disappoints her of being his young widow.
THE COMMINUTED STATES.
Who can say where Secession will stop? That is, a question which
is raised by Mr. LINcoLN, in a part of his inaugural address, directed
to enforce upon fools and madmen the necessity of acquiescence by
minorities in the decision of majorities. The President tells the frantic
portion of his fellow countrymen that:-
“There is no alternative for continuing the Government but acquiescence on one
side or the other. If a minority in such a case will secede rather than acquiesce,
they make a precedent which in turn will ruin and divide them, for a minority of
their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by
such a minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy, a
ear or two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present
{. now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now
being educated to the exact temper of doing this.”
The force of this simple reasoning will be seen by the lunatics to
whom it is addressed, during their lucid intervals, if they have any. It
may even be hoped that some of them may recover the use of their
reflecting faculties so far as to be enabled to follow out PRESIDENT
LINcoLN's argument, and their own folly, into ultimate consequences
and conclusions. Then they will see what is likely to be the end of
Secession, for it is not quite true that there is no end to Secession
and the end of Secession will be for the Secessionists an end o
everything. Seceders will go on seceding and subseceding, until at
last every citizen will secede from every other citizen, and each indi-
vidual will be a sovereign state in himself, self-government personified
a walking autonomy, alone star, doing business and supporting itself
off its own hook.
Here Be Truths.
M. GUILLAUMIN, in the French Chamber, intending to be severe
upon England, said England makes her propaganda with the Bible in
one hand and a piece of calico in the other, but France bears her banner
in one hand and the Cross in the other. }. gander yourself, M.
GUILLAUMIN, for you have just hit it. England proffers enlightenment
and the comforts of life, France comes with superstition and “glory.”
It strikes us that such orators should be choked off by their priests.

AFORE YOU DRA. W. YoURSELF off P*
THE NEW ARRIVAL.
(Kingdom of Italy constituted, Monday, March 18; GARIBALDI's Birthday, Tuesday, March 19.)
QUoTH Monsieur la France to his Lady,
“Let’s issue our cards for a rout!”
'Twas done, and the crowned heads invited
To a nice little tea and turn-out.
The Hôtel de l'Europe with excitement
From area to attics was stirred;
The corridors gorgeous with flunkeys,
And ablaze with state liv'ries absurd.
The courtyard with carriages crowded,
On every panel a crown, -
And extremely big-wigs for their drivers,
In dignified line, setting down.
The pavement was thronged with its gazers
Of the class which such sights always draw—
Sardonic, and seedy, and sneering,
And not too good friends with the law.
The heart of the chivalrous JENKINs
Had been chilled to its innermost core,
To hear their remarks as the cargoes
Of Royalty drove to the door.
The cry of “What shocking bad crowns!”
Saluted the jingling approach
Of Naples and three small Grand-Dukes
In an antediluvian coach.
Its gilding all tarnished and battered,
Its heraldry faded and dim,
Springs spliced, lining mildewed and tattered,
And a team of mad mules—gaunt and grim.
But conceive the crowd's shout of derision
As these crest-fallen Kings, when set down,
Were refused, one and all, an admission,
As not one could fork out a crown'
'Twas in vain that they sent up their names,
Tried to borrow the requisite rhino;
In the lack of one de facto crown,
What are four crowns de jure divino?
“Does Old Mother-Church know you’re out?”
Was the cry that encountered the Pope,
As the old Cross-keys drag lumbered up,
And for harness—a great deal of rope.
Well might poor Pio NoNo look scared,
'Twas long odds 'gainst his safely arriving;
Those red-hatted Jehus will take
Such very bad roads for their driving.
The triple tiara popped out,
While cross-keys and crook made a clatter,
And the Pope scuttled into the house,
To the chorus profane, “Who’s your
hatter?”
Till at last one exceptional cheer
Was bestowed on a coach in the line:
The coach—need I add—was Old England's;
The cheer—need I say it—was mine!
Inside all was hot hurry-skurry,
Cordons, crachats, embroid’ry, gold-keys,
Gold- and silver-sticks humbly kootooing,
Drones a-cluster round King- and Queen-
CS,
There was Monsieur la France—all endeavours
To look as if meaning no harm—
With Madame la France—not more faithful
Than av'rage French wives—on his arm.
Half-aloof, buttoned up in his bear-skin,
And º the scene, haut en bas,
Stood Russia, bent on not giving,
Yet fearful of taking, the pas.
While with bearing half-cheeky, half coward,
Young Austria yawned and haw-hawed,
Like a man who's uneasy at home,
And by no means more easy abroad.
Now sidling tow'rds Prussia, as minded
His tediousness there to bestow:
Then making advances to Russia—
Then stopping—as if 'twere no go.
Poor Turkey was slunk in a corner,
On an ottoman all in a heap—
Looking like a decrepit old clothesman,
On his stock-in-trade fallen asleep.
While Russia and France moved about him
w With an eye to his purse and his shawl—
Though each, through respect for the other,
Abstained from attempting a haul.
That the Royal assemblage was hearty,
Or pleasant, or genial, or gay,
Is what, as a truthful narrator,
I fear I can't honestly say.

And faces the feelings can state,
The guests’ thought was, “Look to your
fº
The host's, “Keep an eye on the plate.”
Old England, the only one present,
# no arrière ;: oppressed,
With Britannia tuck'd 'neath his arm,
Moved, a contrast complete to the rest.
Tºº I’m bound to confess that I saw,
As he stooped to help France to some trifle,
Peeping out from the skirt of his coat,
The butt of a long Enfield rifle.
But wherefore this sudden confusion,
This crowding of Kings in a clutter?
Each separate bristle in flutter?
On his boot-heels indignantly turning?
Why Prussia's embarrassed attempt
At once to look sulky and civil f
Why the Pope's disposition to swear,
Winding up, after all, in a snivel?
Who’s this that our host is preparing,
To give a reception so bland to,
Though Madame la France in the sulks,
Monsieur's protégée won't stretch a hand to ?
Who advances, in spite of cold looks,
And backs that refuse to do duty P
'Tis ITALY, glorious in youth,
And radiant with renovate beauty!
Like a helm shows the crown on her brow—
For a sceptre, her sword’s in her hand;
And firm is her stepping, I trow,
As proudly she takes up her stand.
“Wretch!” “Parvenue !” “Minx 1" “Up-
start | * “Thief!”—
Such the epithets whispered about;
d never a tongue bids her welcome,
And never a hand is held out.
Yes, one! through the crowd of crowned heads
To snub the new-comer agreed,
Old England is forcing his way,
To wish the fair stranger God speedſ
His honest red face in a glow,
His two brawny hands spreading wide;
Let who will turn their backs, she shall
know
Here’s England to stand at her side :
And thinking at once of Caprera
And Turin, the old boy’s heard to say,
“Dear ITALY! happy to see you,”
And “many returns of the day!”
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“WHEN these lines are made public there will be no theatre
in all London left open, except to those who are attracted by what
for me, why am
swells would call an ‘Orwewy,” or who can sit out a slow concert of
indifferently done music. Of course this is quite proper, and I have
no mind to awaken the just wrath of the Record by expressing any
wish to have Passion Week profaned by dramatic entertainments. But
I cannot comprehend, upon what principle of logic, other places of
amusement are allowed to throw their doors open, when theatres are
rigidly obliged to keep them shut. Who is it that draws the line
between the stage of the Princess's and the stage of the Alhambra,
and says that the trapeze is proper to be seen, while the tragedy of
Hamlet must be Fº out of our sight? If amusement be not proper
- allowed to go to Music Halls, and Song Saloons, to
Cider Caves, and Coal Holes; and hear fragments of the operas not
elsewhere deemed permissible, and see conjurors and acrobats, ballet
girls and ‘rocky wonders,’ and so-called, ‘comic' vocalists in their
most facetious parts Are sham niggers thought provocative of pious
meditation, or will the Cure effect the cure of any thirsty soul who
listens to it? I am debarred from MR. FechTER, and enjoyment of his
Hamlet; but am allowed to take my fill (if I so º of MR. PUD.
DING, and to laugh (if I so can) at his protean transformations. If
Old Bob Ridley be deemed proper for my ears to hear in Passion
Week, one would have thought ‘To be or not to be’ would not have
done much harm to them; and while the moral ‘Judge and Jury’
keeps open court to Londoners, there can be no great hurt in witnessing
the Trial Scene of Shylock.
“Quite conscious as I am that ‘Comparisons are odorous,” I make
no attempt to pit the pit of opera or theatre against the supper-box of
a Singing Room, or stall at the Alhambra. Each has its habitués, and
whatever be my own private taste in the matter, I have no wish to
obtrude it just at present on the public.
“The English law, I am informed, is choke full of anomalies; but
there are few of them I fancy more ridiculous than this, that entertain-
ments which are licensed by the Magistrates keep open, when those
which have the sanction of the Government are shut. As Punch bids
fair to be perennial, you, Sir, perhaps may live to see the end of such
absurdity, and it will do us the more credit the sooner that end comes.
eanwhile, as a proof that other minds have sense enough to see that
this anomaly is unjust as well as foolish, MR. GERMAN Reed, I notice,
announces that his Gallery will be closed throughout the week, whereas
the other ‘entertainers’ all continue playing. This course of MR.
REED I consider to his credit, and it sº win due commendation
for him from the pious public.
“The other night, not being proud, I visited the Standard, and there
a shillingsworth of Janet Pride. (Your West End readers may
not know that this theatre is in Shoreditch, and that full price to the
stalls is the modest sum I've mentioned.) They who saw this piece
when it was played at the Adelphi need not be told how admirably
MA.W.2BSTER acts in it. His sottish drunkenness is well nigh painful
for its life-like personation, and presented as it was to an appreciative
audience there seemed fair ground for hoping it might produce some
I am bound to add, however, that they did not seem in any
aste to go and take the pledge; indeed they swigged the porter that
was served, between the acts, as open-mouthed and greedily as they
had Arunk in MR. W.E.BSTER’s declamations against drink.
Not being an habitué, I cannot tell if farces are in general much
relished at this theatre: but if they be, the night I went was certainly
an exception, for when the curtain fell on Janet, pit and stalls became
* desert, and the boxes showed a vacuum such as it is the nature of a
-
lessee to abhor. By the way, the jokes that raise a laugh at East End
theatres are of a nature quite distinct from those we laugh, at in the
West. When the comic man rushed in with horror on his counte-
nance and informed his lady-love that “the taturs have biled over, the
simple news was welcomed with a general guffaw: and a still louder
burst of laughter was won by the intelligence that he'd “taken hoff
the taturs, and they’re werry much relieved.” Of all good jokes,
however, there seemed nothing like a hugging bout for bringing down
the house. It would have done a cynic good to see what hearty
unchecked merriment was caused simply by the comic party falling on
his knees and kissing Janet who was in a similar position. The oscu:
lation this young lady had to bear was quite appalling, but by dint of
nightly practice she bore it most sheroically, and did not seem a whit
alarmed by it. Certainly, if I am asked to write a ‘heavy’ for a
“minor’ (readers of the Era will understand this slang), I shall take
good care to lug in a good quantity of hugging. I fancy if an author
wished to make a certain hit, he could not well do better than make
his heroine sing a song with obligato osculation, each bar ending with
a kiss; while, as a relief from the horrors of the piece, there should be
a general hugging when Virtue is Triumphant, and a congratulatory
kiss all round when Vice is Punished. - -
“I must lay aside this levity when I next write of this theatre: for
on the night of Easter Monday the ‘Great Tragedian,' I find, will
tread these classic boards, and as Monday is Mark Lane day, and the
Standard is just opposite the Eastern Counties Railway, no doubt the
Suffolk farmers will improve their minds by hearing him... I am told
by a Scotch critic that “for the perſect pronunciation of the English
language” (of which this Scottish gentleman is of course a thorough
judge), MR. KEAN may really be ‘accepted as a model.” So if our
Suffolk farmers wish to improve their rustic utterance, they had better
take a course of lessons at the Standard from one considered the most
perfect English speaker of the day.
“I remain, Sir, Yours, &c. (whatever that may mean),
‘ONE who PAYs.”
ENGLAND v. CHINA.
The rebels in China, we read, go by the name of Taepings. We
have obstructionists, if not rebels, in England—who impede the march
of events, who throw every obstruction they can in the way of public
progress, who are relentless, implacable, oppressive, obstinate, and
very difficult indeed to be subdued. They lurk in dark corners, and
evince the greatest reluctance in showing themselves, and then only at
distant intervals, and always to retire immediately the moment after
you have seen them. Their only instrument is a bit of string, but they
manage to do a deal of execution with it. We allude to the Red
TAEPINGs, who infest in such large numbers our government offices.
They have been warring against the interests of the public for a long
time—feeding upon the best of the land all the while—filling up their
leisure, of which they have plenty, by plundering the country to the
reatest extent; and we must say it will be a happy day indeed for
2ngland when she succeeds in putting down this rebellious race 1–4

Seasonable Intelligence.
Several of the Drinking Fountains about the metropolis have had
their wooden paletóts removed, and their winter padlocks taken off
from them, and are now, as though rejoicing at their release after
their long captivity, in full play again. This is refreshing, in every
sense, for we look upon it as the first real opening of Spring.

HELPING HIM ON .
Cruel Fair One (to silent Partner). “PRAY 1 HAve You NO Conversation ?"
THE REVENUE CUTTER
AND PATENT BUDGET SIFTER COMPANY (LIMITED).
THIS morning a Deputation, composed of illiberal Members of the
House of Commons, waited upon LoRD PALMERSTON at his official
Chambers in Downing Street.
The º was introduced by MR. CRAwford, who shortly
explained the object which the gentlemen present had in view. It was
to solicit his Lordship's patronage for a Machine invented by an
Association called “The Revenue Cutter and Patent Budget Sifter
Company (Limited),” of which MR. WILLIAMs, M.P., was Chairman
and responsible Manager.
MR. CRAwford having been requested by LoRD PALMERSTON to
describe, the Patent Budget Siſter, produced a working model, and
informed his Lordship that on a very low estimate the machine was
calculated to effect a saving in Exchequer cuttings of £10,000,000 per
annum.
LoRD PALMeRSTON. You employ a punch, I suppose?
MR. CRAwford could not speak positively on that point, though he
was aware that Punch had produced some very striking cuts.
LoRD, PALMERston, (smiling). The largest holes in our Budgets
have hitherto, I suspect, been made by a punch. How is your machine
set in motion ?
MR. CRAWFORD. By a combination of screws.
LoRD PALMERSTON. Can you point out the screws to me?
MR. CRAWFORD signed to MR, BAINEs and MR. Buxton, and made
rapid telegraphic overtures to MR. WHITE, MR. Roupell, MR. C. S
BUTLER, and several other gentlemen, but with what object did not
clearly appear.
MR. BAINEs earnestly entreated his Lordship not to slight the
“Revenue, Cutter.” . It was urgently needed in Government
offices, embracing as it did, a soap-slice, applicable to a commodity
: which large and wasteful consumption was almost hourly taking
place.
..MR. CRAwroRD observed that his friend MR. Edwin JAMEs, during
his recent visit to Italy, and while engaged in military pursuits, had

THOUGH with the North we sympathise,
It must not be forgotten
That with the South we’ve stronger ties,
Which are composed of cotton,
Whereof our imports mount unto

And where would be our calico
Without the toil of niggers?
The South enslaves those fellow men,
Whom we love all so dearly;
The North keeps Commerce tºund again,
Which touches us more nearly.
Thus a divided duty we
Perceive in this hard matter.

Oh won’t we choose the latter!

INDIGESTION FROM IRISH STEW.
THE disruption of the once United States was at first
wholly attributed to difference of opinion on the subject
of Slavery, and next in part ascribed to diversity of views
and interests respecting commercial legislation. ... Another
and more powerful cause may also have contributed to
produce a result so much to be deplored and blushed for
by all the friends of representative government. -
many years, a great, emigration of disaffected Irishmen
had been continually increasing the population of the
American Republic. For a long time America digested
them. Perhaps, however, the nutriment which she has
gone on deriving from ireland so long, may have at last
disagreed with her, occasioning constitutional disturbance
which is, in a great measure, nothing more than an out-
break of a suppressed Irish malady, the fever which, with a

Mr. CRAwForp replied that, having once more become a civilian,
the Honourable Member had made a financial conversion of all his
equipments, except his Damascus blade, which formed one of the most
powerful choppers in the machine. -
LoRD PALMERston was gratified to hear it. Some alarm had been
felt lest his friend's spirited charger should carry him over the bar. .
MR. BRight, interrupting his Lordship, had no hesitation in saying
that the machine was worse than useless, unless it could be used as a
paper-cutter. (Loud cries ºf “Hear'.) The Company was seeking for
Ministerial patronage. Now he (MR. B.) knew what Government
contracts were; in fact the Government was indebted to him for some
beautiful trimmings. - -
LoRD PALMERstoN. Yes; you told us we might have a piece at any
price. (Laughter.) - - - - -
MR. BRIGHT strongly deprecated the use of irritating language.
When would Ministers learn that soft answer which turns away
wrath P. No wonder that Continental powers were alarmed and
incensed, when, instead of speaking with “bated breath and, whis-
pering humbleness,” we delighted in assuming, a truculent attitude
and an exasperating tone! England, if she studied her true interest,
would be found, like a dove, billing and cooing with France and every
other nation; instead of that, we see her most powerful and most
reckless statesman volunteering to set a trained bull-dog at an
inoffensive neighbour. (Murmurs.)
MR. BRIGHT. A trained bull-dog I repeat, that ought to be shot on
the premises, which have become a nuisance by its yelp.
LoRD PALMERston winced and drank off a large tumbler of water,
with a flushed face.
MR. BRIGHT. Britannia! Who is Britannia? Is she a meek-eyed
Sister of Charity ? No. Who then? Why a red-armed Beldame—

MR. BRIGHT. What (continued, the indomitable speaker) does
Britannia want with a Lion?...Does he pay for his keep?...No. Then

LoRD PALMERston observed that he thought it very desirable to
cultivate amicable relations, but he did not think we ought to cotton
to people whose principles were diametrically opposed to our own—he
wished to know, what had become of the Honourable Member's self-
acting paper-cutter?
MR. BRIGHT vehemently replied that it had been notched by the
stupid handling of an Aristocracy which wallowed in the slime of
corruption.
MR. CRAwford and several other gentlemen deplored the cruel
necessity of listening to such sentiments from a Man and a Brother.
LoRD PALMERston. My dear MR. CRAwford, had you not better
employ some competent person to take “The Revenue Cutter” in hand

candidly confess, it appears only suitable for the cutting of chaff.

Withdrew.
CONCENTRATED ESSENCE OF THE MILK OF HUMAN
RINDNESS.
(AN INGENUoUs APPEAL.)
O the Aged, and Persons
about to die, or tired
º of Life.— Many who
are on the point of
leaving this world, or
have lost their relish
for its pleasures, are
nevertheless blest
with the means of
conferring on others
that º happi-
ness which they them-
selves must soon re-
linquish, or are in-
capable of enjoying.
Such are too often in
the habit of seeking
unattainable gratifi-
cation in the exercise
of benevolence by dis-
tributing large sums
of money in small
donations amongst
the poor. The muni-
ficence which is thus
spread over a multi-
tude of objects is so
attenuated that by
each of its recipients it is scarcely felt. The charitable donor
thus fails to obtain the exquisite satisfaction of reflecting that he has
ſº the heart of a fellow-creature. His bounty is as it were a
oaf, vainly i. in crumbs among a famishing crowd, instead of
being effectually applied to relieve the hunger of one starving sufferer.
Those who are desirous really to taste the luxury of doing good should
concentrate their generosity on particular persons. An opportunity is
now offered to all who are anxious to secure the genuine article. A
healthy young man, with a large appetite of every kind, is well nigh
destitute of the means of procuring any one pleasure. In order to
subsist, it is necessary for him to work hard, which he very much
dislikes, and to earn a precarious and scanty living by anxious labour.
He is, in short, in want of a large and independent income. Oh, if he
only had that how happy he would be and though at present neces.
sarily an unmarried man, he would very soon have a wife and perhaps
ten children, whom, as well as himself, a certain affluence would render
happy.
Fº the wealthy who derive no enjoyment from their own riches,
only think of the bliss which it is in their power to confer on this
young man. Let them consider how much more sensible an amount
of blessing they would impart by bestowing all their charity on him,
than they can dispense by frittering it away upon a host of others.
How much better to give him a large sum of money than to squander
it on Schools and Institutions ! It is in the power of every one, how-
ever humble, to contribute to his felicity, and thus be enabled to
cherish the F. assurance of having performed an act of efficacious
kindness. The smallest contributions will be thankfully received; for
a sufficient number of farthings would insure the object so earnestly
sought by this young man. Subscriptions, legacies, &c., to be sent to
the Office,85, Fleet Street; at which application may be made by any
Party or Parties desiring to adopt an Heir.
OUR ADMIRALTY TINKERS.
No doubt the sketch would be considered a most farcical conception,
were any one to make a drawing of the First Lord of the Admiralty
going about the dockyards as a travelling tinker, and crying, “Any
Šid three deckers or new frigates to mend?” But absurd as it may
seem, the #." is not far from being a most truthful one. Of the
twelve millions a year which we have lately been expending on our
wooden walls and iron ones, it may be doubted if three-fourths have
not been spent—or rather wasted—in tinkering old tubs, and in re-
pairing worn-out vessels of no good to us when mended. How much
more of the twelve millions has been thrown away in needless naval
operations, such as stripping bran-new ships on their return from their
first cruise, and refitting them in Portsmouth for a sail as far as Ply-
mouth, goodness only knows, unless SIR, BALDWIN shares the know-
ledge, and as he is now some hundred miles away, we cannot hope at
present to extract much information from him.
Now that iron men-of-war are rapidly supplanting wooden ones (as
rapidly, that is, as the “system” of delaying all improvements will
permit), the cost of pulling ships to pieces and putting them together
again will be even more expensive than it hitherto has proved. It is
therefore the more needful to keep a watchful eye upon our Admiralty
tinkers, and prevent them, if we can, from doing needless work. We
are well aware that this will be difficult to do, for habit is at all times
hard to be withstood; and when a man has ever turned his hand to
tinkering, it is not an easy matter to keep him from odd jobs. How-
ever, there’s a cherub that sits up o' nights in Fleet Street, keeping
watch not only on the welfare of poor Jack, but on the ill deeds of the
lubbers who waste the country's money, and so prevent it entering
Jack's pocket as it might do. Let # tinkers, then, look out; for
Punch will keep his eye upon them, and will not scruple to advise their
being sent to pot. -
A WAY WITH HUSBANDS.
“WHAT is the meaning (inquired a lady, pointing to a little shoe-
black, who belonged to the Saint-Vincent Paul brigade) of those three
letters S. W. P. marked, you see, on his shoulder?”
“Why, my dear, (answered her wag of a husband) they mean either
one of two things; or it may be both. You can either look upon them
as an indication of the boy’s price, or as a polite entreaty on his part.
They are open to two readings, and you can take whichever you *.
my little dear. Now, don't get impatient, or else I won't tell you.
Wºli then, you must know, my pet, that S.V.P. mean either “Sil’Ver
Penny,'—that’s his price; or else, “s'il vous plait,'—and that’s the
boy's politeness.”
ł. was a great shame! They had been married only six weeks, and
the brute was already beginning to deceive his wife
“The Sick Man.”
AN infinity has been said and written about the wonders of the
Turkish Bath. The most enfeebled constitution, we are told, will
profit by it. We propose, therefore, that the experiment be tried upon
the Sultan himself. In his desperate state, it cannot possibly do him
much harm, and the chances are that it may do him some good. Who
knows but he might come out of the purifying trial a cleaner, and a
better, and a stronger man?'. In fact, if the whole of Turkey were put
into a Turkish Bath, it might be all the better for that weak power.
Its constitution, severely drained as it has been by the Sultan, and
profusely sweated also by Monsieur MIREs and others, could not fail
to gain by the invigorating process.
Spanish Honour to be Avenged.
The Cabinet of Her Most Catholic Majesty has determined to evince
its resentment of the imputation which LORD PALMERstoN has cast
on the honour of Spaniards. º the noble Premier, in
charging Spain with dishonesty, º to have expressed the feeling
of her §. creditors, the Spanish Government has fully made up
its mind to pay all those impertinent fellows out.
Change of NAME.-Since his yelping advocacy of Austrian policy,
MR. Roebuck is no longer the “Dog Tear'em.” He is now quite an
Autre-Chien.

CAPITAL LARE OF BODGER AND LITTLE PIPPS AT THE EXPENSE OF MISS MINERVA COCHLELON'S SEMINARY
DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE.
WHAT wonderful people there are in the world! Who could have
supposed that in this sharp-sighted age, any person could be flat
enough to write such an advertisement as this we find inserted in the
Times of the 9th ult.:—
WANTEP, the SUM of £300, on security of the lender having £500
out of a share in a certain will, about which reasonable satisfaction can be given.
The testator, whose chief property consists in a large life policy, but now upheld º
small payments, would not object. The bequest is not payable till after the deat
of two persons, one of whom is about 52, and is now and has long been very dan-
gerously ill, and the other about 60, and far from strong. The advertiser also
wishes *Fº to pay it off at any time by paying also 5 per cent. compound
interest. All jº, expenses to be paid § the lender #. sum lent must not be
liable to be called in at any time whatever. The money is required for the further-
ance of a literary work of such a character as will, it is believed, cause a far
mightier and happier era in human history than has ever yet been seen. Address
MERRY ANDREw, Grimaldi Terrace, Green Street.
We have had a rather blowing time of it of late, but that is no reason
why people should give themselves such airs as the , writer of this
notice. The impudence of his proposal is only equalled by its dignity,
and we really hardly know which of the two we should most laugh at.
The motion of his fancying that any one would lend him three hundred
ounds, on “security” ſº of pocketing a possible five hundred,
equeathed under the will of a still living testator, who may of course
to morrow cancel the bequest, is an idea which would in summer be
delicious for its coolness; and when we further find the lender is to
ay all law expenses, and is not to have the power to call in the sum
łº, we can't help thinking that the writer for the moment quite forgot
himself, and, when penning
head that he was writing a
his advertisement, somehow had it in his
broad farce. How weli Mr. Charles
MATHEws would go through such a scene as might be worked out of b
the call of some one caught by the advertisement! With what delicious
self-possession would he clear up any doubt respecting his “testator,”
and show that .# living he was just as good as dead, and that as
for altering or cancelling his will, such a notion was—ha! ha!—a joke
quite irresistible. What a funny dog you are, he might proceed to say,
giving an appreciative poke in the short ribs. But you’re quite right
to be cautious—there are lots of rogues about, and one everywhere
by William Bradbury, of No. 13. Upper Wobu.
in the parish of St. Pancras, ºn the county of Middlesex, and Frederick Mullett Ryans, of No. 11, Bouverie street,
sees stuck up “Take care of your pockets.” Still, the notion of my
gulling such a clever chap as you, is—ha! hal—you'll excuse me, a little
too ridiculous. Why here you see yourself what good security I offer.
Five hundred sterling pounds, lawful English money, and as as
down, for you see it’s to be paid on the deaths of these two persons
who are as good as dead—one “dangerously ill,” and the other “far
from strong.”, True, I haven't told you the age of the testator, or if
his health is shattered; and you business men may think this a point
quite as important. But waiving this for just one moment, consider,
my dear Sir, the stupendously magnificent results that are in prospect.
By lending me the paltry sum that I require, you will become one of
the greatest benefactors of your species. You will further the
advancement of a literary, work, that will make the , whole world
ºil. and happier than it has been. My dear, Sir, think of that!
and at once out with your cheque-book! When such gigantic good may
be secured to all the Universe, don't be stopped by such a trifle as a
doubt of the security; Hand me over the three hundred, and imagine
yourself reverenced down to all posterity as the man who introduced
this º: happy era. Mind, I’m not to be held liable to pay the
money back, but you see you’ll have a chance of the Five hundred
secured to you, and of course you may rely upon my wish that you
may get it!
Postal Arrangements.
LETTERs posted at Hammersmith after half-past nine at night, or at
the earliest hour next morning, arrive in Fleet Street on that day at
about 2 p.m. - -
Letters posted in the same suburb on the middle of Sunday arrive at
Southampton on Tuesday morning.
The expedition with which the mails are despatched from the subur-
an post-offices is wonderful, and deserves the notice of the authorities
of St. Martin's-le-Grand.
THE SCARCITY ACCOUNTED FOR.
We are told by nurses, and other moral-mongers, that the Truth must
not be told at all times. This may be one of the reasons why the Truth
is so rarely told at all.

“HOORAY—THE STREETS UP AGAIN 1..?"
“THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THEIR OFFENDING.”
THE Musical Morld, talking of a new piece that has been brought
out at the Wariétés, in Paris, says:—
“The title of the piece, Les Ramoneurs, will sound obscurely to most of our
readers. It alludes to the practice of certain persons who would conceal the fact
that old Time has been shaving their heads with his scythe, by drawing the still
flowing locks, which he as yet has only ‘thinned,” back over the denuded portion
of their craniums. A very bold subject, we should say, for even the flimsiest farce.”
Qur harmonious contemporary, instead of “bold,” might have said,
and probably did intend to say, “bald.” For, the life of us, we cannot
see the great crop of fun that could have been reaped from the above
barren subject. We agree with our critical friend, that the notion is
decidedly, as a smart Frenchman would say, “Un peu tiré par les
cheveuz.” Our Parisian farceurs may as well take all the human
infirmities, and turn them, one by one, into ridicule. Blindness has
been already operated upon in the form of Les Deua Aveugles. Deaf-
mess has also been treated ſarcically, whilst the gout has been handled
so roughly and frequently on the stage, that it almost fails now to
excite a laugh. However, we think, the Man With a hooden Leg would
present a good handle for fun. The wife might in her jealousy take it
away from her husband so as to keep him at home—or she might light
the fire with it, in order to cook her beloved Arthur's dinner, whilst her
one-legged, partner sat writhing on a chair, incapable of moving a
peg; besides a thousand other little pleasantries that would be
sure to command public laughter: for no fun is so irresistible
as that which is based on the distress of another, more especially
(with Frenchmen) when that other happens to be a husband.
Dame qui porte une perruque would be another fruitful subject for
a hair-brained vaudevilliste to P". humorously with. The dénoîment,
when her hypocrisy was laid bare, might be made almost tragic
in the very intensity of its fun, the parting between the Sub:
lime, and the Ridiculous being so extremely small, that it would
require a very clever coiffeur indeed to be able to draw the line
of demarcation precisely between, the two. The CLAIRVILLEs of
the Parisian stage must be at a sad loss for heads of subjects to joke
upon, when º compelled to cover the nakedness of their humour

out, when it needs to be lighted afresh with a mêche de cheveur.
Hence the necessity, perhaps, of sending for Les Ramoneurs to give it
a thorough good sweeping after so bad a fire.
SPIRITUAL BELL-RINGING.
The attention of the Editor of the Spiritual Magazine is invited to
the subjoined extract from the letter of a Correspondent in Notes and
Queries:–
“CURious Coincidence.—On Wednesday night, or rather on Thursday morning,
at 3 o'clock, the inhabitants of the metropolis were roused by repeated strokes of
the new great bell at Westminster, and most persons supposed it was for a death in
the Royal Family. There might have been about 20 slow strokes, when it ceased.
It proved, however, to be due to some derangement of the clock, for at 4 and 5
o'clock 10 or 12 strokes were struck instead of the proper number. On mentioning
this in the morning to a friend, who is deep in London antiquities, he observed,
that there is an opinion in the city that anything the matter with St. Paul's great
bell is an omen of ill to the Royal Family; and he added, “I hope the opinion
will not extend to the Westminster bell.’”
The mysterious phenomenon above described occurred some days
ago, when subsequent events sufficiently prove it to have been ominous.
There can be no doubt whatever that it was supernatural.
“And the great bell has toll'd, unrung, untouch'd.”
It is very true that, the kitchen clock of a writer in these columns
strikes all manner of hours, but even this is a spiritual fact, for that
individual's habits are irregular, and the clock is deranged by the
influence of our untidy contributor. The rule in all cases of this kind
74 is to consider whether the marvellous occurrence can be accounted for
on supernatural principles, because, if it can, the truly philosophical
mind will reject the natural solution of the mystery, and adopt the
other.
And Quite Right Too.
What makes Cavour cry out so loudly for Rome? Why, don't

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SLIPSLOP OF THE SHOPS.
“Chrysanthemum Cottage, Tuesday.
H, I am, so
much obliged
to you, m
dear Punch,
for putting in
my letter a-
bout the Clas-
sics of the
Counter. I
felt so proud
when I saw it
actually in

CHARLEs posi-
tively read it
through, not
knowing it
was mine, un-
til he came to
where I spoke
of going out
in our new dio-
- - ropha to buy
him some rypophagon, and to
inquire what was the price of
the anheidrohepseterion, which
we had recently seen advertised
somewhere in the newspapers,
where we spied the emmenathoon
hair-dye for Mamma. The man
who served us at this shop-I
beg his pardon, this establish-
ment, sadly wanted CHARLEs to
try a bottle of his famous cele-
brated hydroh ſon curlin
fluid, and when CHARLEs refuse
and endeavoured to escape, he
thing called a podapalagon,
which I believe has been de-
scribed as a “warranted eradi:
cator of cutaneous callosities;”
that is, in simpler language, a
thing to take out corns. . ...
But besides the classicalities
now current at the counter,
there are other forms of slang
in which our tradesmen take de-
light, for to speak in plain pure
English seems quite foreign to
their taste. French is pressed
into their service quite as much
as Greek, and Latin, and by ill-educated tongues which talk of
‘hany other harticle” you can fancy how la langue Française is
mispronounced. I hardly ever now take up a newspaper without
seeing an advertisement of some “recherché stock of goods’ which
are to be disposed of forthwith "sans reserve.’ A hair-dresser now
styles himself in general an “artiste,’ and announces to the universe
his famed ‘esprit de violette’ or “bouquet de Thames. One enter-
prising draper, whose name I lately noticed, has had the courage
to combine, his classics, with his French, and to advertise for
sale a lot of ‘broché madapolums,' which must be something rather
curious if they at all be really like their name, Corset and chapeau
have T. supplanted such old English words as ‘stays’ and “bonnet;’
and of course no West End dressmaker would ever dream of naming
petticoats by any other term than jupes. Why this is so I really can't
pretend to say; nor can I guess why in a newspaper professedly
intended for British circulation “Le sommier élastique portatif' should
be announced, when ‘Portable spring mattress’ is vastly more intel-
ligible, and by British tongues in general far more easily pronounced.
.." Of course I need not say the French is bad French very often, and
like the ‘broché madapolums’ a sort of mongrel slipslop which none
but a vulgarian would venture to construct. stances of this are as
plentiful as polkas in the windows of the music shops, and as absurd
as the new love ballads whereof each hour brings a fresh batch. It
will suffice that as a sample I call to your attention the ‘berceau-nettes
for babies,” which are advertised extensively throughout the London
press. Now that berceau means a cradle º bº knows, but in the
name of grammar what is meant by ‘nettes?” Of course you know
the English of the French word net is “clean;” but how can ‘nettes,'
the plural feminine be affixable to ‘berceas,” which is singular and
was pressed to purchase some-.
masculine? And just as if a mother would ever dream of buying a
berceau for her baby that was otherwise than net/ -
“But oh! this mention of one's poppet reminds me of a horrible adver-
tisement I’ve seen, which is headed in big type ‘Pistol GRAMs or
BABIEs.” gracious, Mr. Punch / pray what ever is a F.
Is it some new-fangled fire-arm, like an Armstrong breech propeller,
and can it be intended really to go off P If so, I’m sure infanticide
will be alarmingly increased, and it will be a mercy if but one out of a
dozen of one's babies is not shot. I know I’ve thought a pop-gun a
sadly ºf . thing, and as for those toy rifles one now sees in eve
nursery, I’m quite sure that it’s not safe for children to be left wit
them, for though Charles says they can't be loaded, they’ve got great
bayonets stuck on to them, such as seem made expressly to poke one's
ba #: eyes out. But what destructive implement a ‘pistolgram” may
be, I confess I º have not courage to inquire; only I feel convinced
that if it be one-half as terrible as its name seems to imply, our infant
population will be dreadfully decreased. I know I'll take care
that nobody shall buy myittle tiddleums a pistolgram, unless I see
quite clearly that it can't do any harm: and for my part I can’t think
why people can't use common English when they want to name, a
thing; instead of puzzling one with gibberish that no one understands.
“Cradle” surely is as pretty a word as ‘berceau-nette,’ and while
English folk speak English why on earth should tradesmen address
them in bad French P
“Yours abruptly, Mr. Punch, for itile tiddleums is crying,
“ARABELLA ARAMINTA ANGELINA SMITH.”
“P.S. CHARLEs says he’d like to catch me asking him to get up in
the night to rock the herceau.nette, or get baby its ‘bouillie,' which he
supposes will ere long be the substitute for “pap.””
THE SPOILT CHILDREN OF THE ADMIRALTY.
FROM the way in which affairs are managed in our dockyards, one
would really think “my Lords” were in a state of second childhood,
and were playing at ship-building as a means of killing time. No
sooner is a vessel put in thoroughly good trim, and her crew by careful
training brought to quite a model state, than an order comes to strip
her and turn all hands adrift; as though “my Lords” had suddenly
grown tired of their plaything, and wanted to get rid of it. The
wanton * in which new ships are soon neglected, and left to rot as
hulks in the mud, of Hamoaze, is quite unparalleled except by the
caprices of spoilt children, who, for no cause, take a violent dislike to
i. new toy, and never handle it except to consign it to the dust-
Ole.
Now, three-deckers and º: are a costly sort of plaything, and
we think that MR. BULL would be thoroughly well justified if he for:
bade their being wasted and misused as they have been. If our old
naval enfants gaités must have some toy to play with, let, them yearly
be supplied with an old gunboat or two, which º may be at liberty
to tinker as they please. More than this they really have no right to
expect, and it is high time that their organs of destructiveness should
not have such development as has been hitherto permitted them. If
all else fails to stop them, a cry of “Here’s Punch coming!” will
doubtless do great good; and Punch promises to look into the nursery
ere long, to see if any amendment has resulted from this threat.
THE POPE'S LAST.
SoME years ago a drama was produced at Drury Lane, in which
MR, ANDERson, acting as a Red Indian, made a great sensation by
repeating expressions of violent hatred and contempt for “Civili-
sation l’’. The Pope has just published an Allocution, wherein he
appears to have taken a leaf out of the book of the author of the
drama which MR. ANDERson used to distinguish himself in... His
Holiness, in several places, denounces “Contemporary Civilisation,”
which, he says, “has given rise to many facts never to be sufficiently
deplored.”. The most deplorable of these facts, of course, is the deter-
mination of the Roman States to exchange constitutional government
for Popery. Let his Holiness, and the Cardinals put on their war-
paint, dance their war-dance, brandish their tomahawks, and shout
their war-whoop against “Contemporary Civilisation!”
A Circular Note.
WE are told that Rome is wanted as the future centre of United
Italy... It is true that Count Cavour admits that to obtain possession
of it, the consent of France must be had. Under these circumstances,
it strikes us possibly that it is not Rome so much as Louis NAPOLEON
that is first wanted as a-ssenter. Given: the EMPEROR or THE FREnch
as a centre, and Wictor EMMANUEL would not belong before describing
the magic circle he wants of Italian liberty.

YAHOOS AMONG THE YANKEES.
Who would not be the wife of a President, and be sketched in pen
and ink in this way for the public?—
“MRs. LINcoLN is a middle-aged lady of—well, say 40 or perhaps 38 years of age.
On the top of her head, the place where the hair ought to grow, the hair does grow,
and very luxuriantly too, of a dark brown colour and elastic fibre. Her head is
large and well-developed, presenting the organs of firmness and language in a highly
developed and well-matured condition. Her forehead is broad, her eye clear and
intelligent and rather blue than grey : her nose is—well, not to put too fine a point
on it—is not Grecian; her mouth is large, well-shaped, and capable of great expan-
sion, while her chin rounds gracefully, balances properly," and goes in a quiet way
towards the endorsing of our opinion that she is a decided, not obstinate, woman.
Her form inclines to stoutness, but is well-fashioned and comely; while her hands
and feet are really beautiful, indicating, as does the well-shaped ear, that she has
come from a race of people who were well born. Her carriage is good, her manners
are pleasant, her greetings are affable, and without doubt her intentions are correct.
. . . MRs. LINcolN does not chew, nor snuff; does not dress in outré style,
does not walk a la Zouave, does not use profane language, nor does she on any
occasion, public or private, kick up shindies. These negatives are necessary,
:*.* affirmative of these propositions has been sent broadcast throughout
the land.”
As a pendant to these latter statements, we may mention that the
writers for the New York newspapers are, generally speaking, Yankees,
not Yahoos, and gentlemen and not gorill. This statement may be
necessary, because persons at a distance might, from passages like the
above, imagine that wild beasts wrote for the papers in *. and
that anything like gentlemanly language was extinct. What would be
thought in # if the wives of leading statesmen were criticised in
this way; if LADY PALMERSTON, for instance, were said to have red
hair, and the wiſe of Wiscount Williams were to be scribbled about
as having a big mouth and a snub nose? Would not people of all
creeds, Tory, Liberal, and Radical, concur in crying shame! upon so
monstrous an intrusion upon family concerns?
A public man is public property; granted, gentlemen, of course; but
only as regards his public acts and bearing. No writer has a right to
cross the private threshold, and to parade in public print what he may
behold there. Criticise the President, and his policy and speeches;
but if you claim the title of “gentlemen of the press,” take care not
to push your criticism further. With his wife and family you have
nought to do, any more than with what he had served yesterday for
tlinner. And the penny-a-liner who would stoop to earn some coppers
by such impudence is worthy of more kickings than he is of half-

A CRINOLINE HOSPITAL WANTED.
Quousque tandem utere Crinolind, Miss? Here is another sample of
the dangers you incur by it:—
“Another CRINotine. AccIDENT:-Yesterday morning, as a lady was endeavour-
ing to enter an omnibus in the Euston ...'. had stopped at her request, the
folds of her voluminous, dress were caught by the wheel of a passing cab, and she
was carried a considerable distance by the vehicle before she could be extricated
from her perilous position. On being conveyed to a surgeon's it was ascertained
that the poor lady had received a fracture of her leg in addition to several severe
contusions, and she was conveyed to her home in a most pitiable condition."
Among the many schemes *:::::: for the outlet of benevolence,
we wonder nobody has set on foot a hospital for patients who have
been either maimed or burnt through the wearing of wide petticoats.
So largely have the accidents from this cause of late increased, that
were a Crinoline Wing added to Guy's or St., Bartholomew's it would
not long suffice to meet the exigencies of the case. Scarcely a day
passes without qur hearing of some score or two of mishaps that have
occurred through this, fruitful source of accident, and we think it is
high time that special steps be, taken, to provide the sufferers with
adequate relief. Litters should be kept at all the crowded ;
to be ready to convey the patients to the hospital, which should
erected in some central spot; and for the relief of the severer cases
there should be reception rooms provided in each thoroughfare, where
sufferers might be sheltered and receive the care they need. Whether
*..." could be provided for ladies who catch fire through their
amplitude of dress, is a point which MR. BRAIDwood perhaps, may
ascertain; but we should certainly advise there being plenty of lint and
flour and other remedies for burns kept at hand in every drawing-
room where Crinoline is tolerated, so as to afford relief until the
surgeon can arrive. - - - -
ere we inclined to make a classical comparison, we might liken
the entangling folds of a wide dress to the deadly serpent’s. ſolds
wherewith Laocoön was strangled, or compare them for combustion to
the shirt of Nessus. But as we hope that what we write will be read
as much by ladies as by schoolboys and M.P.'s, we will not let out the
quotations which we have at our pen's tip. Suicide by Crinoline, has
been quite long enough a fashionable failing, and we think it is high
time that there should be an end to it. Ridicule apparently has failed
to give much check, and it must now be seen what frightening may do
for us. If º Woman is not to be laughed out of her folly
perhaps it may be found that she can be made nervous through it; and
when once her nerves are touched she will submit to what is asked of
her. , Were wide dresses marked “Dangerous!" as they hang up in
the shops, ladies i. in some measure be deterred from buying them:
and their fears might very likely with advantage be enhanced, were

ude of skirt.

perhaps have the insolence to urge him to try something warranted to
reproduce it. If you tell them that you never use any unctuous appli-

odoriferous filth, then they will Fº you with suggestions of some
specific for shaving, and will not e no for an answer, and be quiet

THE GREAT DIWORCE (NOW DUE).
DAYs of Divorce are these: SIRCREsswell CREsswell—
.AFacus, Minos, Rhadamanth in one—
Sits, saying sternly, to all wedded sinners,
“Divide!” and it is done!
Spite of both Rome and Oxford–Bowy ER's howlings
And SAMUEL's struggles, sly and saponaceous,
John BULI's coarse common-sense has given the lie
To Theologues pugnacious—
And said that marriage is a mutual compact
With two parts, whereof either rudely broken,
Dissolves the other, though upon the banns
A priest have blessing spoken.
So come you down into the severing court,
You ill-matched ancient Kº: whose wedlock's scandal,
Ages ago, to DANTE's awful scorn
Gave a tremendous handle.
Come Roman Church and State—pair foully linked,
Worse fate—by ConstanTINE and CHARLEMAGNI.'
From Union which has wrought the curse of both,
Be separate again!
Poor Church—which ere that fatal wedding rite,
Wert still a ºil. pure and true:
Poor State, that with a soldier's faults hadst then
A soldier's virtues too!
Now tainted each with other's special sins,
Church as State stupid, sensual, and self-seeking;
State as Church cowardly, persecuting, proud,
Subtle and sneaking.
Come—long enough the world has blushed or bled,
For crimes which from your union took their source-
Let Rome that, sorrowing, saw your wedlock, see
Rejoicing, your divorce!
“Whom God hath joined let not man put asunder:”
The word is good. Part not whom God unites:
But whom the Fiend has joined, God bless the hand
That, swift, asunder smites.

OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH,
“CERVANTEs has scarcely depicted a more amusing episode
in Sancho Panza's official life than when that humble hero, seated at
the dinner-table, is prevented from satisfying his appetite by the
officious zeal of his medical adviser. Dainty after dainty appears, but
the physician is inexorable, and dishes vanish, one by one, under his
potent wand. . There are passages in my liſe when I have been forcibly
reminded of the scene. allude to º: on the briny sea. The
feast is spread, the guests assembled, the Captain smiles and begins to
carve, when lo! up rises Neptune with that awful trident, the table
Jurches at his touch, and away we stagger to our cabins. Perhaps we
do not lose much by the interdiction. The viands on board the Baron
Nosey are not always of a first-rate description, and on the occasion
when we were bound for Porto. Franco would certainly not have
tempted me under a favourable wind. I am not much given to the
pleasures of the table, even when the pleasures of the table are given to
me; but this I will say, that I prefer a hot dinner to a tepid one, and
as the latter was the condition in which the dishes were served, and a
strong atmospheric evidence of engine-room was now and then wafted
across the cabin—after vainly winking at DEwBERRY, who was dividing
his attention very fairly between Miss EMILY Spicºn (MAJOR SPICER's
second daughter) and a § pie, and ſailing to draw him off, I went
on deck to console myself with a weed.
“There, as it happened, I came suddenly on a select party of three,
who were making a meagre pic-nic under the shelter of the paddle-box—
an Englishman, his wife, and a sort of ‘young person, who, not
appearing #: in the character of a companion or of a servant,
seemed to discharge the duties of both. As I walked forward, quite
innocently, to my surprise, there was a great confusion, and a sudden
making away with papers of sandwiches and hiding a suspicious
looking bottle in the folds of an umbrella. The gentleman aforesaid,
who was making convulsive efforts to swallow a mouthful of ham, pre-
tended to be earnestly engaged in contemplating the engine-room,
while his worthy lady suddenly became immersed in MURRAY's Hand.
book, by which I have no doubt she must have been extremely edified,
seeing that it was, as I subsequently discovered, upside down.
* Well, I puffed away in silence (being, of course, forbidden under
heavy penalties to speak to the man at the wheel), and was presently
joined by Dick, his fair charmer having left him in order to accom-
any her Mamma, who had freely partaken of lobster salad, into the
adies' cabin, as it was getting rather rough.
“Dick, on hearing of the pic-nic business, burst into a roar of
laughter. "Don't you know who that is?” said he; “that's M“Tinsel,
of Skifflint Hall, Ayrshire, and that's his wife. They bring their own
lunch on board to save a few francs below; but they always take
places in the saloon of a boat, for the sake of appearances. knew
them in Paris, where they had swell apartments in the Faubourg St.
G., and dined on a leg of mutton all the week. Old MT. is always
talking of the magnificent establishment which he left at Skifflint; and
he may speak the truth, for aught I know, as the place is let twelve
months in the year. They are pretty well off in the world, if they
would only live quietly; but as they will attempt to “astonish the
Browns,” they are put to all sorts of mean little shifts at home.
Where did you say they stowed the bottle? Wait a bit. I must pay
my respects, you know.'. And here the deceitful wretch, under cover
of this object, went up to them, and a minute afterwards I saw him
offering his assistance to MRs. M'T., who was moving off laden with
the remains of the banquet. "Oh! thank you, MR, DEwBERRY, never
mind,” said that lady, as Dick was po itely taking the umbrelia;
"Never mind—I can—at least—oh, take care, please!” And at this
juncture the umbrella fell wide open, and disclosed a black bottle, from
which issued (according to Dick) a strong odour of Jamaica rum.

“‘It’s—it's only the-the claret,” said MRs. M*T., getting very pink.
*You know the wine is so shockingly bad on board, and MoRGAN can't
get on without his—ahem—Bordequa.” And she put up such a piteous
mean little face that I couldn't help pitying her.
“‘To be sure—an excellent plan,’ said Dick, looking across to me.
And here M*T, who had retired from the scene, hoping to escape
notice, now, seeing the umbrella opened, and the murder out, came up
rather sulkily, ...; seizing the unfortunate gingham, they both went
below, looking very warm and uncomfortable.
“Dick and I had both secured sofas to sleep on at night, which, by
the way, are infinitely preferable to those rickety shelves called berths.
Before retiring to rest, we were pacing the deck, talking of old East-
minster days and future prospects, when, whom should we come upon
but Miss ARMsTRong, the celebrated American painter (we used to
meet her at MRs. WIMPole's converzationes)—yes, by Jove! Miss
ARMsTRoxg reading CARLYLE by the light of her cigarette. “Hullo!
is that you?” said the damsel, with an extra puff, and nothing taken
aback. “How d'ye do, Easel? Pleasant night, ain't it?’ (puff).
Where are you off to? (puff, pu Rome, I guess-so am I. Lots
of work waiting for me (puff). The Dook or MacKINTosh will be
there this winter. Know him? Not a bad feller, I can tell you.’
And after a few other remarks, the young lady went on with her book.
“‘Who the doose is that?” said Dick (who thinks he knows every-
one), as we walked away, and I told him. ‘By Jove, she’s a clipper,
and will make her way in the world in spite of her snub nose,” said he,
and indeed I thought so too. -
“We were up the next morning early, to look at the sunrise, and I
who have not seen many, I am ashamed to say since I left school, was
delighted with the marvellous effect of colour. The sky was—
“But stop. I am not going to be tempted into any descriptions of
scenery—I know the fate of such in a hundred º which I have
skipped in my novel-reading days. What, after all, is the good of
using hackneyed expressions and threadbare adjectives to describe in
crooked letters what the most skilful pencil can but suggest? So we
will stand out of the light, with your permission, and only uncover our
heads before the Majesty of Dawn.
“The day passed away very pleasantly, and that rogue Dick, had
been sojudiciously attentive to MAMMA SPICER, that the old Major
(who is always grateful to anyone who will relieve guard in attendance
on his partner) shook him heartily by the hand as we approached
Porto Franco, and said “Happy to have made your acquaintance, MR.
Dewberry, hope we shalſ meet again in Rome. You may always
hear of me at Pellegrini's—you know.’
“Dick immediately took down the address in his pocket-book, and
looking pathetically at Miss EMILY, said he should certainly do him-
self the pleasure of calling. I smiled to think how much such compli-
ments usually mean betwixt men, and recalled the time when I fondly
believed people would be glad to see me when they said so. A similar
invitation when I was a youngster induced me to visit a celebrated
R.A.'s studio; and a pretty reception I got there. Well! well! thank
Heaven, all men are not alike. Let us give the honest Major the
benefit of the doubt, and wish MASTER Dick success of his siege in
the Eternal City.
“It was already dusk, and we had got our small collection of traps
together, when a boat came alongside to take of all passengers for
Porto Franco. We jumped in with some fellow-travellers, and were
soon floating over the deep waters of the Bay. A Neapolitan merchant
vessel was moored off the quay, and the sailors were chaunting some
dreamy ditty at their work; else, all was quiet. Two men, red-capped
and bronze-armed, punted our boat along.
** When the deuce are these buffers going to !". said Dick.
‘What on earth is the good of backing water all the way?” For the
graduate was as yet unacquainted with the style of rowing prevalent in
This part of the world, and, which at first sight naturally excited
indignation in one who had pulled bow in the University Eight.

“Ay, I see, a regular sack of carats,” said a promising young

MANSION HOUSE MARBLES.
Ast among the
various purposes
subserved by the
civic General
Purposes Com-
mittee, is the
adornment of the
Mansion House.
For this purpose,
by order of the
Court of Com-
mon Council, they
have within nine
years ordered di-
vers sculptures
to be executed
by sundry artists.
Among these
works of art, all
in marble, is a
statue of SAR-
DANAPALUS, now
nearly completed.
They are to be
placed in the
Egyptian Hall;
where SARDANA-
PALUs will find
himself in every
way except no-
minally at home.
The image of the
Assyrian monarch and voluptuary will be a suitable ornament for that
hall which is consecrated to the orgies of the City King. It will be
considerably more in keeping with the character of the apartment in
question than that of a very different sovereign about to be placed
there—ALFRED THE GREAT. Another neighbour of SARDANAPALUs
is to be a statuette named DRYDEN's Alexander's Feast. It is diffi-
cult to imagine how a statuette can be made out of such a subject,
unless we suppose it to represent ALEXANDER in the act of feasting,
in which case it would certainly form a most suitable embellishment
of the Mansion House. But ALFRED will be quite out of place there,
and, if as yet only ordered, should by all means be countermanded for
a becoming substitute. As one that would harmonise completely
with the genius loci, and admirably match SARDANAPALus and
Alexander's Feast, we earnestly recommend the Roman Emperor
WITELLlus, who was so excessively addicted to eating and drinking,
and thus, as his name would be said in the City to signify, sitch a
beggar for wittles.
PALMERSTON AT HOME.
LoRD PALMERston, on Maunday Thursday, delivered an At Home
before his Tiverton constituents in the shape of an Easter Entertain-
ment. The occasion of this performance was his Lordship's appoint-
ment to the Office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, which five
orts, however, the Right Hon. Wiscount, to the satisfaction of his
learers, showed to be little better than five empty bottles. The ob-
servations of the noble PREMIER related to affairs in general, aud, as
usual, blended instruction with amusement, being heard with rapt
attention and interrupted by roars of laughter. The latter were more
particularly elicited . the remarks which he made in answer to a
volley of absurd and vulgar abuse which was fired at him by a friend
of the people, whom he shut perfectly up, concluding with these
words:– “I believe I have answered most of the questions put by
MR. Rowcliffe.”
WHAT is hypocrite derived from ? We are not classical enough to
say, and have no time to write to DeAN TRENch, but we should say
that it came originally from Hippocrates, and means, one who is a
quack, who prescribes falsely, and deals in deleterious things. Such a
man is a hypocrite, as contradistinguished from a true disciple of
Hiprocrates, or one who is a genuine professor of the healing Truth.

It is said that HER MAJEsty has been advised to do the House of

tinguished a º of the medical profession among the Peers
would add much to their Lordships' intellectual dignity, of which at
present the most eminent examples are the law lords. But a profession
grounded on knowledge of the laws of nature is infinitely nobler than
one which merely demands acquaintance with the statutes and usages
of the realm, and the first surgeon in England is, as such, fitter to be
ennobled than the first lawyer;, that is to say, if the surgeon, who
should be a philosopher, cares about, a title. Moreover, the medical
profession is infinitely more respectable than the legal; for whereas
the former involves nothing that is morally dirty, the practice of the
latter largely consists in abetting extortion, defending scoundrels,
defeating the ends of justice, and, for these purposes, employing a
venal sophistry, and bullying witnesses with the intent, of ºf
them and tricking their mouths into telling #. a lie. Than all
which mercenary and fraudulent operations, lithotomy, amputation, |
the taking up and tying of arteries, and all other proceedings tending
to the cure of disease, the salvation of life, and the relief of F. even
bleeding and tooth-drawing, are infinitely more honourable. Therefore,

MARRIAGE FOR THE MASSES.
CAN a man marry on £200 a year? is a question which some little time, ago was much
discussed. It would appear, from, the subjoined newspaper paragraph, that marriage is
ible under circumstances considerably narrower than those of a couple whose annual
income amounts to £200 :-
* Gaaruitous Maaalages.—The Rev. J. W. Laughlin, incumbent of St. Peter's, Great Saffron Hill, lately
announced that during Easter week marriages at that Church would be performed free of all charges, and
yesterday about twenty couples attended the Church for the º: of being married on these terms, and
more, whose banns have been published, will avail themselves of the offer of the reverend gentleman within
the next few days. Most of the parties appeared to be of the poorer classes residing in the densely-populated
and poverty-stricken neighbourhood of the ruins of the new street near Holborn Hill, to whom the usual
marriage fees have been a great obsºle to their getting married.”
- - - - - -
Twenty couples in a church make a respectable congregation-respectable that is in point
of magnitude; for of course, Respectability in the social scale could never get married for
nothing. They were doubtless all united at once, and the spectacle of one half of a congre.
gation marrying the other half would have seemed
very extraordinary to persons moving in Society
if Society had extended to Saffron Hill an
looked in at St. Peter's. St. Peter of Saffron
Hill and St. George of Hanover Square may have
found some amusement in comparing notes on
the occasion. St. George probably in his own
church never saw so many couples married at a
time during the whole course of his beatitude.
He must have been very much struck with the
fact that all those º were joined"together
in holy matrimony by the Rev. J. W. Laughlin
proprio, Hymene, so to speak, and off his own
[...". The Saint of Hanover Square has
een accustomed to see it take two clergymen,
and often a bishop in addition to an eminent
parson, to marry one single couple of the superior
classes.
There was a time when the sight of so many
poor people contracting marriage in a crowd
would have suggested to a member of Society
the analogy of an º wholesale hanging.
The latter destiny he would perhaps have been
inclined to foresee as the probable termination
of the career of most of those whom he beheld
devoting themselves to the former apparently
with the prospect of having to choose between
begging and stealing. Even now the idea of a
| multitude contracting such imprudent marriages
as those in which future happiness is not se-
cured by proper settlements, will be regarded
in Tyburnia and Belgravia, and even in Blooms.
|bury and Russell Square generally with horror.
Numerous marriages on so much less than £200
a year as the probable means of the twenty
couples above described as having been made
husbands and wives, are calculated to appal
overseers and other parochial authorities with
a F. of increased poors’ rates, and politi-
cal economists may shake their heads at unions
which seem likely to result in the district Union.
Society has reason to call such marriages im-
º but without them how would Society
e provided with servants, soldiers, and sailors?
Society rests on the shoulders of those who
marry upon next to nothing, if not, as in the
cases above cited, in formſ: pauperis; and Bel
gravia and Tyburnia are sustained by the slums.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
EAR PUNCH,-I have often
heard it stated that the
Drama is declining, and that
as a rule the British nation
has ceased to take an in-
terest in theatrical amuse-
ments. The truth of tº:
assertion is convincing
made manifest by the fact
that every theatre in London
is now open, and that at
two of the first houses (the
Adelphiand Sº, James's) the
bills remai - d
from Christmas until Easter,
clearly showing that the
public had supported what
had pleased it. People
reedy after novelty may
fº. to be informed that the
fare is altered now; for that
pleasant, piquant dish, En-
dymion, is removed, and for
a month the Colleen Bawn
has migrated to Dublin.
How it used to make me
shiver during the cold
weather to see daily side by
side with the first leader in
the Times, the stereotyped account of how the dauntless MR. Bouci:
CAULF was pightly .#. his "tremendous header' in the lake: a feat
ths, when the temperature was somewhere below zero, demanded, one
would think, no ordinary coolness. No fewer than a hundred and
sixty-seven times did the intrepid Miles na-Coppaleen take his daring
plunge, and gome up nightly covered with cold water and applause,
and #. º the unabated rush there was to see him, the chances
are, I think, that when his Dublin trip is over, he will have to take in
Lºndºn as many headers more.
Meanwhile, his place is filled—as is the house-by, MA: Wººl
who does a skiſtal bit of conjuring by changing himself into a Wizar
of the South, since it is from Paris that Magloire le.Prestigiateur has
recently arrived. Those who may remember M.R. Wººstºk, in Bel-
phegor, need not be recommended to see him in Magloire, because,
without such commendation, they are pretty sure to do sº. I cannot
º the lauer piece is equal to the former, and it has the disadvantage
of the want of utter novelty, although it clearly cannot be regarded as
a copy. But, as French pieces go, it is very well worth seeing; and
it does not leave a nasty flavour in one's mind, as, in spite of MR.
Wigan's admirable acting, the Isle of St. Tropes, I must acknºwledge,
does. Physicking and poisoning are not things to my taste, however
relished they may be by the palates of Parisians. I prefer the healthier
condiment of comedy and farce, for my appetite is not so jaded and
used up as to require such stinging stimulants as gros wel and winned
pepper. • . . .
*:::ter would by some eyes scarce be looked upon as Easter with:
ºut the column in the papers headed ‘EastER ENTERTAINMENTS:
The critics who at such times have to be ubiquitous had comparatively
quite an easy time of it this year, for at three only of the theatres
were there new pieces to notice. I do not count that at the Hay-
market there was the Miller and his Men (which I hope next week to make
myself a boy again by witnessing); because, you see, one can't exactly
call this a new piece, albeit I think plays which are full half a century
old may be as welcome to the public as novelties much newer. It is
remarkable that there was only one burlesque produced this Easter,
and this, I scarce need say, was at the Bandbox. Theatre. This house,
º are aware, is christened otherwise the Strand, and may more fitly
: called ‘īlsº than the theatre in the Haymarket. Aladdin, you
will find, is quite up to the Strand mark, and the make-up of his
mother is alone well worth a visit. If MR. Rogers be correct in his
notions of costume, the ladies of our Court will find it hard to keep
from º when the Embassy from China present their wives and
pigtails here.
“As usual, the burlesque is brimful of bad puns, and of those queer
twisted word-stringings which with some writers pass for jokes.
**! one sighs in vain now for the neat wit of a PLANchk, and the
really cultured, taste and voice of a Miss HoRTON, which once were
ºended in burlesques with such excellent effect. Miss HoRTON, in
Yer time, was the º of fairy songstresses, and in burlesque reigned
facile princeps, as witness the Isvisible and half-a-dozen other Princes.
Was it from thinking of her, I wonder, that I thought of MRs. REED,
and went to see her once again in an Easter Entertainment? Yes,
there was the rich voice, mellowed and matured, but not yet robbed by
Time of its brilliancy or sweetness; and there was the same careful
and artistic personation, º: to byeplay, and skilful touch and
finish. Better comedy than the Will scene has seldom won my smiles;
and I scarce know which I enjoyed more, her bustling charity-huntress
or lazy novel-reading servant. #. I own I could have wished to hear
her sing me one good solid song—a bit of real music, and not mere
jingle-jangle. This she is the only ‘Entertainer' who can do; and not
many concert-singers, I think, can do it better.
“I may pay another visit to the gallery ere long, and say the word of
praise that the two gentlemen deserve; but with so t a man as
you are, Mr. Punch, the maxim place ass dames of course must be
{|imperative. For the present, I may mention that MR. REED is show-
ing himself more and more an actor, while both his music and his
playing are the work of a musician. With regard to Mr. PARRY, his
genius is really breaking out in a new place. I know of no one on the
º who could have done his Major Popley better than he did, with
such gentlemanly bearing and artistic working out. The character is
slight, and the scene in other hands might have descended to broad
farce; but MR. PARRY kept it free from stagy old conventionalism
while infusing quite enough of humour to the part. As for his song of
Paterfamilias and his ğ. at a Pantomime, of course eyery pater-
familias will take his family to hear it. In this line, MR. PARRY
stands, as he stood ever, unapproachably alone; and, snobbish as it
may be to pun upon a name—
“None but himself can be his Parry-lel.”
“The opera is not the drama, it is true; but, as being the highest
form of entertainment, on the stage, I surely now and then may be
allowed to notice it... So well mounted as Le Prophète is, it must have
a good run; and to judge by how the house was filled the other night,
I think the public take advantage of the treat that, is provided them.
To say the band is as nearly perfect as can be, is but another way of
saying that MR. Costa is conductor; and though I still, retain a
memory of MARIo and GARCIA, I have little to find fault with in
TAMBERLIK and Czillag.

MUSICAL MARAUDERS.
“WHISTLE, and I'll come to you, my lad!” appears to be the
maxim with some of the police; for at Bow Street the other morning a
gentleman was charged with the offence of having whistled in the
public streets, and was fined twenty shillings for disturbance of the
peace. In passing sentence the worthy Magistrate remarked:—
“It could not be tolerated that the inhabitants of a quiet neighbourhood should
be disturbed late at night by persons who had a peculiar gift of making a particu-
larly disagreeable noise."
We hope this legal maxim will be acted on next Christmas time,
and in full force carried out against those nuisances the Waits, who
yearly “make night hideous” with their bellowings and blarings, just
as would-be-quiet people are falling into their first sleep. As persons
who are gifted with a most “peculiar gift of making a particularly
disagreeable noise,” they clearly can no longer be “tolerated” among
us, if MR.HENRY's dictum be impartially enforced. Spouting clubs
are fond of arguing that there is one law for the rich and another for
the poor; and this would seem to be the case if gentlemen are fined
for making ugly noises, while pot-house-haunting flute-blowers may
squeal their worst, scot-free. there be equity in law, a penalty or
prison must await the Waits; and the sentence lately passed at the
police-office in Bow-street must be visited on all those musical
marauders who infest the town in bands at the dead hours of the
night, and robus of our comfort if they cannot of our cash.
IDon't Believe it was Ever Said.
THEATRICAL anecdotes are generally very stupid—so are most other
anecdotes—and one hates to see a Party getting into his anecdotage.
What is the good, for instance, of telling this story. An actress who
is a very great favourite with the gallery, was being complimented in
the green-room upon the blackness of her hair. “Why, it’s dyed,”
she replied, with the amiable frankness of the true artist. “Dyed,”
repeated the other 8 er, “why, favourite as you are, you are uot
yet five-and-twenty.” “ No.” said the lady, “but you know-
“Whom the Gods love, dye young.”

THE SCHOOLMISTRESS ABROAD-RATHER
We have heard that by certain ultra-fashionable people to write a
good hand is thought a !!!” accomplishment, only fit for lawyers'
clerks and—aw—that sort of persons. Perhaps, if this be so, it may
be thought no less outré to write intelligible English; and bad grammar
may be viewed as a sure sign, of good breeding. Upon no other |
assumption can we account for the bad writing in the following adver-
tisement, which was placed on Easter Tuesday before the elegant
subscribers to the Morning Post:— |
IF a Nice Lady, of High Family, having a House too large for herself,
and wishing for the occasional society of another, would LET a Pretty SITTING-
ROOM and ONE BED-ROOM (or º to a Young Lady. A sunny aspect desired,
and the room, if not large, must be lofty. Must be in the best neighbourhood,
either of Grosvenor or Belgrave Squares, or Kensington. The rooms need only be
half furnished. Best references given and required.—Address (strictly in accord-
ance with the above)"Arno,” Post office, Chapel Street, Belgrave Square (to be
called for).
To scholars who are studying the art of composition, the first sentence
in this extract is a yaluable specimen of the jº which by schoolmen
is termed aposiopesis. Aposiopesis is a terribly hard word, but ladies
who have husbands, brothers, lovers, or other masculine attendants,
may without much difficulty find out what it means. To those who
are not blessed with any male companionship, we may say that what is
known as aposiopesis is something like a skein of silk or worsted,
where you cannot find an end, and sentences so formed are quite as
troubling to unravel. -
But passing by the fact that this first sentence, like the Nelson
column, stands unfinished, there are many other puzzles which perplex
us in the text, and which, we think, the writer ought clearly to explain,
before she can expect a fair reply to her advertisement. In the first
place, she should mention what she means by "nice,” for this is an
extremely doubtful sort of epithet, and may be misconstrued and
received in a wrong sense. A lady with inked fingers, shayed fore-
head, and male voice might by some people perhaps be deemed a
“nice” acquaintance; and the need of explanation is the more acutely
felt, since the converse of the adjective is so completely inadmissible,
for it is obvious that no lady could be spoken of as nasty. Then,
º Miss Advertiser, pray what is your meaning when '. speak
of a “high family P" How high do you wish the family to be? And
do you use the term in reference to the stature of the family, or in
allusion to its altitude in what is called the “Social Scale f". Do you
require that its male members should stand six feet in their stockings?
j will # content you to know they are looked up to in a moral point
on view
But, supposing that the question as to altitude besettled, there next
presents itself the even more perplexing interrogative-How on earth
can a nice lady, having a house too large for herself, wish “for the
occasional society of another f". We have heard that walls have ears,
and in this spirit-rapping age they may possibly have tongues. Still
we can’t think bricks and mortar can be pleasant things to talk to, and
we doubt if any medium could extract much information from them.
And as for any lady having any wish for the society of a house while
there are so many “bricks” of fellows she can talk to, the thought is
as ridiculous as the style of this advertisement; which must have been
inserted merely as a joke, and with the view, no doubt, to gain
admission to our columns.

THE POPE AT BAY.
The Pope has drawn what he may call the Sword of Peter, and
thrown away, the scabbard. His Holiness stands at bay with his back
to the Infallible Church and his face to the foe, which is Contempo-
rary or Modern Civilisation...With this enemy he openly declares war,
and proclaims his casus belli in uncompromising and unmistakeable
terms. “It’—modern civilisation—“favours non-Catholic religions.”
It “ jº, access to public offices, even to infidels.” It “throws
Catholic schools open to their children.” And further, as his Allo-
cution stands translated in the Tablet, thus saith the Pope;—
“Finally, while it gives full liberty to all speeches and writings which attack the
Church and all those who at heart are devoted to her, while it excites, nurses, and
encourages licence, it shows itself full of prudence and moderation when it has to
reprove the severity and violence displayed towards those who publish excellent
works, while if these appear to transgress in the least the bounds of moderation, it
punishes them with the last severity.”
“What a whopper!” as the schoolboys say—will be the exclama-
tion of many on reading the above statement, not considering how
completely it is justified by notorious facts. £verybody knows how
LoRD PALMERSton's Government, inspired by modern civilisation,
has prosecuted DR. M'HALE and DR. CULLEN for publishing excellent
works which did in the least possible degree transgress, the bounds of
moderation, and that those two ornaments of the Irish Roman Catholic
iscopacy have been heavily fined, and are now undergoing a sentence
of imprisonment. Equally notorious is the fact that the Bishop of
ORIEANs and his brother of PortIERs are in chains; their offence
having simply consisted in rather too free a protest, against the
foreign policy of the Imperial Government; whilst M. WEJILLOT,

Eº Essaying and Reviewing.
.The most successful combination of Essays, and Re-
views was produced on Easter Monday at Wimbledon and
Brighton. The Essays of the Wolunteers were thoroughly
Reviewed, and the spirit they evinced was pronounced by
the best judges as quite orthodox and proper. The volum-
tary system was put fairly to the test, and from the credit
that was given it, there was no dissenting. On the whole,
it was pronounced that these Essays and Reviews were
the best that have as yet been issued from the press—the
press, that is to say, of the public who attended them.

rance, and as asserting civil and religious liberty. This is open and
above board anyhow. But why does Heaven's Vicar object to modern
civilisation for throwing Catholic schools open to the children of
| infidels? If the infidels choose to send their children to Catholic
schools, one would think that the Pope should be very glad of the
opportunity thus offered to Catholic teachers of making converts.
#. schoolmasters probably would not object, to receive as many
children of Catholic parents as those parents might choose to confide
to them for instruction. If the Holy Father only flourished, his
weapon as skilfully as he does manfully, he would do tremendous
execution upon his adversary; but he hits right and left with blind
vehemence, and not only misses his blows, but loses his balance, and
throws himself head over heels. , Popery cutting away at modern
civilisation would furnish a fine subject for an allegorical picture to be
executed for the adornment of a vacant space on the walls, of the
interior of the Vatican, by a suitable artist, whom Pius could afford
to remunerate handsomely out of the Peter's É. which are tossed
into the triple hat now going round. Qr the Pope might be depicted
by the same artist cursing modern civilisation and blessing mediaeval
civilisation; modern civilisation opening public offices to persons of
all religious opinions; mediaeval civilisation burning heretics alive.

THE PRICE OF A PARTRIDGE.
We doubt whether the nation is sufficiently aware what its precious Game-Laws cost it.
Perhaps it, may be helped in making a rough guess by basing calculation on the following
account, which we copy from the Times of Wednesday in last week:-
“The Poach ER and the Partridge.—A singular case, taken under a new Act of Parliament, was heard
before the South Shropshire magistrates, at Bridgenorth, on Saturday. FREDERick PERRy, a notorious
her and a returned convict (who is at present undergoing a sentence of six months' imprisonment in
§º. gaol for a murderous assault on a gamekeeper at Kinlet Hall), was summoned for having on the
15th of January, at Claverly, killed a partridge, without having taken out a licence. The name of the defend-
ant having been called three times at the court-house door, and he not answering, MR. Barrº, who appeared
to prosecute on behalf of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, said the case was taken under an Act
during the last Session of Parliament, and he believed was the first of the kind that had come under its
operation. The Act in question empowered the Excise to prosecute any person who used a gun or any
other instrument for the purpose of taking game without taking out a licence, and the magistrates could
inflict a penalty of £20, but it could be mitigated one-fourth. The present defendant had long been a
scourge to the neighbourhood, and he (M.R. Barre) thought the magistrates should inflict the full
penalty. . There was no term of imprisonment mentioned, so that if the defendant could not pay the
ty, he would remain in prison during the pleasure of the Excise Commissioners. The case having
n proved, MR. Westcott, supervisor of the Excise, deposed to delivering a copy of the information to
the Governor of Shrewsbury Gaol, and to afterwards serving the prisoner personally with a copy of the sum-
mons. The presiding magistrate inflicted the full penalty of £20 on the defendant, and said the Excise
might keep him in gaol as long as they liked."
Partridges, we know, were extremely dear last season, but we had no idea they would
become such costly birds as the case here cited proves them. Twenty pounds is a large
sum for the friends of a poor man to contrive to scrape together; and, as he may be kept in
prison until the fine be paid, there is no saying for how long a time he may be maintained out
of the pockets of his country. Even on gaol fare a man can hardly live for less than
Forty pounds, a-year; and as the Excise Commissioners may keep a man in gaol as long
as ever they like, the pounds for keeping him may be increased to a good many times
forty. In fact from this case it would seem that the value of a partridge may be put at such
a sum as would º: an annuity of Forty pounds per annum, determinable by death, or
by ºnent of the penalty, or by the “pleasure” of the Excise to let the prisoner be
released.
Well, the moral of this is, as we are very fond of shooting, that we should try to kill next
season all the partridges we can; for every bird we leave alive may make a man for life a
gaol-bird.

ADWERTISED ABSURDITIES.
Of all the curiosities of advertising literature,
there are few more singular than those which
may be met with in the Era. When we say
that they are singular, we do not mean to use
the word in the sense which it assumes as the
antithesis to plural; for these curiosities abound
in every number of the paper, and, if we wished
to give a sample, the embarrassment of riches
would puzzle us to know on which of them to
pounce. Here, for instance, are a couple that
(with other names affixed to them) the other day
amused us, and it is really hard to say which of
the two is the more curious:-
THEATRE ROYAL, BEERTOWN.
WANTED, immediately, a SCENE PAINTER
(one who can act preferred); a Property Man, and
to assist in bill delivering. Both must be sober.
Address, –, stating lowest terms.
ROYAL ALHAMBRA. BLANKTown.
ANTED, A WIOLONCELLO PLAYER,
to play a brass instrument, Bombardon preferred;
or a good Trombone, to play in string and brass. Address
as above, to MR. Gnanochasm, Leader.
The reflection which the former of these
singular advertisements appears to throw upon
the character of Property-Men and Scene-
Painters we trust is not borne out by their ordi-
nary habits. To require a sober character is a
temperate request, but we really should have
fancied that cela wa sans dire, as we scarcely
can imagine that any person living could desire
to have a drunken one.
But still more are we perplexed by the purport
of the second of these curious advertisements.
To ask for a good violoncello player “to play
a brass instrument,” appears to us, we own, the
very acme of absurdity; and we should as soon
have thought of hearing that a clergyman was
wanted to sing a comic song, or a one-legged
Chelsea pensioner to dance a hornpipe or cachuca.
The notion, too, that the performer is required
to be a “good” one on the violoncello, when he
is wanted for the bombardon or some other brass
instrument, really seems to our mind a refinement
of the folly. owever perfect knowledge he
might have of the one instrument, it would
avail but little towards acquaintance with the
other. One might play a merveille on the bones
or on the bagpipes, without having any know-
ledge of the trombone or the organ; and to
require that a musician, whom one wanted for
the bombardon should be able to play well on
the violoncello, appears to our mind as prepos-
trous as to elect"a Member of Parliament for
having thrown a double summersault, or to
choose for the position of musketry instructor
an artist who was well up in the drawing of a
cork.
A “CANARD.”
(From the Boulogne Gazette.)
“Our pretty little town of Boulogne has been
invaded by crowds of English visitors. The
steamers on Saturday and Sunday last brought
each their hundreds of passengers, and the hotels
and boarding-houses were crammed to inconve-
nience. Dining-tables and sofas let atten francs
a night, and chairs were readily occupied at two
francs each, the tenancy extending from 11 at
night until 7 in the ºf: This friendly in-
vasion would have been less remarkable (as
Boulogne is the most delightful holiday place on
the face of the globe) had the visitors not been
exclusively ladies whom even flattery could not
call very young. -
“We stop the Press to explain the mystery.
The Census was taken in England on Monday,
the 8th of April, and Ten Thousand British
females were mean enough to evade it.”

MAWWORMS IN A MILK-WALK.
THE Russians use lemon in their tea instead of milk, and we think
the Glasgow people had best learn to do the same, if they would take
that drink on Sunday, without making wry faces at it.—Anyhow, if
what we lately heard be acted on, the luxury of milk will soon no
longer be allowed them, unless they drink it stale and sour, in which
case we think lemon would certainly be º: At a meeting of
the dairymen, convened the other day in the Nelson Street Conventicle,
the following motion was proposed and unanimously passed:—
“That feeling convinced that it is the right and duty of all classes of the Com-
munity to observe as far as possible, the §º rest, and to participate in its
blessings and advantages, knowing besides that the present indiscriminate retail
traffic in Milk on the Sabbath day, prevents themselves and their servants from
enjoying the aforesaid º. and leads to many more evils than the entire
abolition of the traffic, this meeting of the Dairymen of Glasgow resolve to petition
the trates and Town Council of the City of Glasgow to insert in the New
Police Bill a Clause prohibiting the sale of milk on the Sabbath."
This is all very right and proper, we feel sure, so far as the well-
being of the cowholders is concerned. If they think that the bare act
of selling milk upon the Sabbath will in any way imperil their spiritual
welfare, of course one cannot blame them for retiring from the trade.
Still, one cannot help inquiring—How about the cows? and asking if
they’ll suffer much from not having been milked.
o make their step complete, we really think these pious dairymen
should not only shut up shop and stop their sale upon the Sabbath,
but should take measures to arrest the manufacture of the article,
which, in the present course of Nature, proceeds as well on ..
as on any other day. A meeting of the cows should be iº
convened, and an endeavour should be made to acquaint them wit
what passed at the meeting of the donkeys to which we have referred.
Some calf of a cowkeeper may there perhaps explain that, with the
view to carry out the object of that meeting, the cows will not be fed
after milking time on Saturday, so that their lacteal manufacture may
be stopped. How the cows may like this, we will not pretend to

say, nor how the Sabbath starving will be relished by the thousands
of small children in Glasgow, to whom milk may be considered a
necessity of life. Perhaps if the Society for Cruelty Prevention thinks
the cows will suffer, it will interfere and take them from their keepers'
care on Sundays, and take upon itself the sins of feeding them and
milking them and distributing their milk.
It is of little use, we fear, to preach common sense to bigots, or to
reason with mere fools; but we think it will be obvious to ordinary
minds, that so long as cows and children have an appetite on Sundays,
so long it will be natural and right that they should eat; and that
while cowkeepers do but assist the laws of Nature, they need not fear
they are infringing the laws of Nature's God.
PANSLAWISM IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
The Paris correspondent of a contemporary communicates the fol-
lowing piece of American intelligence:–
“By the way, a strange report is in circulation. It is said that some Roman
Catholics of the Soutb have proposed to offer the Southern States to FRANCIs THE
Second of Naples, with monarchical institutions.”
This report is probably what French slang calls a duck, and English
slang a sell and a shave. Charity would like to believe it, because, if
it were true, it would say something for the Christianity of the Southern
States. Hitherto the Slaveowners have given no reply to the questions,
Are you doing as you would be done by in keeping niggers like cattle,
and governing them with the cowhide? How would you like to be
slaves yourselves? The Southerners would satisfactorily answer these
inquiries by choosing BoMBALINo for their sovereign.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
APRIL 8. Monday. Easter Holidays over, and the next thing to look
forward to is the Derby, in the betting on which a horse called
Dundee, the property of the honourable boy for the Falkirk district,
stood top this day. However, we must do some work before we have
another Out, jºy. or we shan’t have much to show when we go
home for the shooting. We must really buckle to. Only three clear
months between us and August, think of that, and be cheerful—the
time will soon be gone.
MR. DUN.com BE wanted SIR. G. C. Lewis to give him the name and
number of the policeman who got hold of the bank-note which was
being engraved for Kossuth, and Thomas implied that the officer in
question ought to be discharged. SIR GEORGE had no intention of
giving up either the name or the man.
SIR. Richard Bethell has of course read the writings of his
eminent predecessor LoRD BAcon (whose character MR. Hepworth
Dixon has chivalrously sought to clear from the sentence that pronounced
that bacon “streaky”) and equally of course remembers his lordship's
term, The Vintage. SIR. Richard came to his Wintage º His
toils were rewarded by his Bankruptcy Bill being read a Third Time
and passed. , MR. WANCE was the only speaker, and he declared that
the Bill would give general satisfaction to the mercantile community,
which, considering the ethics of that community, is the severest thing
that has been said against the measure. Spero meliora, says Mr. Punch,
with classical elegance.
Then came on a longish debate, in Committee on the Post_Office
Savings' Bank Bill, which seems likely to be very useful. As for the
ordinary Savings' Bank, it seems constructed to keep people from
using it. Mr. Punch looked in at one the other day. It was open
only twice a week, and then for a short time, and there was a not
particularly civil beadle, or some such animal, and there was a crowd
of depositors or people who wanted to withdraw deposits, and they had
to wait a great while for their turns, and looked disagreeably at each
other, and pushed, and the place was hot and uncomfortable, and
altogether Mr. Punch thought that only regular, determined, and patient
people were likely to make an habitual practice of attending with their
savings. Now, if a person, can glide at any time, any day, into a
Money Order Öffice, and without uss, delay, or official bullying, can
quietly drop the little bit of money as it were into a slit of the money-
box, the habit of saving will be fostered, and .." thousands will be
able to buy their Punch, instead of only reading him at the window.
The Bill was read a Third Time. -
The Bill for appropriating part of the Coal and Wine Dues to the
Embankment of the Thames was read a Second Time, but there was a
fight against it. Mr. Punch agrees with those who consider the dues
to be very unjust, but then life is a compromise, and if a stronger boy
than yourself takes away your money, and you cannot get it back, the
next !. thing is to induce him to stand treat to you with your own
coin. We shall not be able to wrench our money from the City, but
if we can get it laid out in improving the Thames, that is better than
letting the gorbellied knaves and fat chuffs have the handling it. At
the other injustice of making London pay the expense of making itself
convenient, to please all the rest of the world, and elegant, to H. all
the rest of the kingdom, Mr. Punch has no words to express his indig-
nation, but he thinks the more.
Tuesday. LoRD ELLENBoRough spoke sensibly upon the propriety
of giving Prussia a caution not to meddle with Denmark, and he added
that though in Hungary, Italy, and Poland, circumstances were arising
that would lead to complicated movements, he saw no cause for war.
And he added “Woe to the Power that should provoke war.” Amen,
saith Mr. Punch with a heartier plaudit than he often bestows on
Elephants or anybody else. LoRD DERby wanted to escape the bore
of discussing the Bankruptcy Bill, and politely suggested that it had
been so fully considered elsewhere that a select committee might look
over it, and report; but LoRD CAMPBELL thought that the Bill might
be damaged in this process (and perhaps Lord DERBY, on behalf of
non-traders, had his own thoughts that way) and would not hear of
anything of the kind.
SIR HENRY STRACEY spoke up for those excellent institutions called

Sailors' Homes, where Jack is taken care of, and protected from the
scoundrel crimps, who drug and plunder him on his return with money.
SIR HENRY wanted Government encouragement for these Homes, but
Political Economy forbids such an unenlightened proceeding. That
may be all very well, but if the Police Magistrates could be armed
with power, when a bad crimping case is brought before them, to
make the crimp “eat stick,” there would be no outrage upon political
economy. At present nothing can be done unless downright theft can
be º, and before Jack is robbed, he is doctored, and can prove
nothing. SIR GEORGE Bowy ER then moved a foolish motion, as
might be expected, for the purpose of preventing any Member, from
voting in Supply, unless he is in the House when the question is
ut. The present plan is to allow a couple of minutes, to ring in the
embers. SIR.G. Lewis hit the mail on the head when he met the
proposition by saying that it would lower the House to the level of a
jury. Members, it is to be hoped, make up their minds as to their
votes, not from hearing their own humbugging speeches and those of
their fellows, but upon private consideration of facts. Mr. Punch
would, have the profoundest contempt for an M.P. who should be
swayed by any speech Mr. P. has heard for many a day. This view of
the case being adopted, a Member may as well enjoy his glass of wine,
or his cigar, as be listening to Bowy ER or any statesman of similar
calibre. "The foolish motion was withdrawn.
Wednesday. “BAINEs, Edward º Born at Leeds, 1800.

Institutes. Has written the Life of his father, and also on Woollen
manufactures. A Liberal,” &c. &c. &c., But for all that, and all that,
and twice as much as all that (which will be found in CAPTAIN DoD),
when MR. BAINEs declared his intention to alter the constitution of the
country, and throw into the Borough Register all the £6, occupiers,
the House of Commons was presumptuous enough to think for itself,
and to eject MR. BAINEs’s Bill by 245 to 193.
Thursday. LORD GAGE, who is a M.A. and a profound mathematician
and therefore not open to the ridiculous folly that might tempt a ribald
to call him Green Gage, presented various petitions in favour of
marriage with your wife's sister. He did not speak on those petitions
or might have said that things which are equal to the same thing are equal
to one another; and therefore if JEMIMA living, and MATILDA deceased
(sisters), were equal to JoHN SMITH in position, JEMIMA, being equal
to MATILDA, gº! marry JoHN SMITH, if he were equal to proposing
for her. Q. E. D.
A Ship, debate followed, and a good one, and the opinion of SIR
Joseph PAXTON, SIR MoRTON PETo, and other practical men was
strongly expressed against the Wooden Ships. LoRD John Russell
said that the arguments had so far penetrated the Wooden, Heads of
the Admiralty that no more vessels of the kind would be built.
Historically speaking, this night will be famous as the anniversary
of the Abdication of JAMEs. MR. Edwin of that ilk retired from the
representation of Marylebone, for causes and considerations; that is to
say, that he may have more time to give consideration to his causes.
A debate on the New Zealand troubles, and the “difficulty” be-
tween WILLIAM KING and VICTORIA QUEEN, began, and everybody
showed that nobody exactly understands the case. Bref, Mr. Punch
considers that the British have behaved uncommonly unfairly, and that
it is for the interest of humanity that they should go on doing so.
Friday, LORD CARNARvoN protested against the intended execution
of one of the Druse Chiefs, a party who had not been proved to have
joined in the massacres, and who had been proved to have saved the
lives of some Christians. LoRD Womehouse said that it was designed
to deal, rather mercifully, with the Druses generally; but, as to this
particular Chief, though the English Commissioner had thought, he
ought, to be spared, three or four of the other Commissioners had
thought differently; and on the whole it seemed, from LoRD Wode-
House's speech, that such a trifle was scarcely worth making a fuss
about... During the sitting the victorious ELGIN, home from China,
made his appearance, and was cheered by his Peers.
ADMIRAL WALCOTT made a demand touching the completion of the
Nelson Monument, and MR. CowPER made the reply which has,
Mr. Punch thinks, been heard about twenty-seven times before, namely,
that SIR EDWIN LANDSEER is making the Lions. When the Sculptor
gets his models, he must act upon the Templars’ motto, Semperferiatur
Leo, until they are done. Ha! haſ quoted in an instant.
A tremendously long speech } LoRD John Russell in answer to
a Schleswig-Holstein question, the only point which was made quite
clear being that “If the German soldiers came into close approxima-
tion with the Danish troops, a collision, might take place,” which
seems rather a safe thing to say. Somebody in Ireland is so angry with
his tenants for ‘...; a gang of murderers, that he has, after due
warning and vain demand for the surrender of the criminals, evicted
everybody, whereat MR. Scully let off some indignation. Some more
New Zealand talk, and then Supply occupied the Commons until the
hour of nine o'clock, when they “bust up.”
The Marylebone election will have taken place before Mr. Punch
again addresses the Universe. Ever so many Nobodies have offered
themselves, and also a Somebody. LoRD PUNCH has no intention of
coercing his vassals, but if they wish to please him they will elect MR.
WINGROVE CookE, who has written, from personal observation, the
best, book extant about China, and who is a scholar, an orator, and a
gentleman. A Vermilion Edict. Respect this.

which, how much soever
it may grieve some friends

to comfort and encourage
others:—
“The galleries were crowded
to-day in expectation of seeing
GARIBALDI, who was to take his

The illustrious GARI-
BALDI is known to be a

chiefly of bread and fruit,
and his drink is water.
Yet GARIBALDI has the
gout. This, albeit all Bri-
tons interested in Italian
- political freedom must be
sorry to hear it, will be welcome intelligence to as many as are addicted
to British freedom of living. They who regard the constitutional liberty
of peoples, will receive it with sorrow, but it will rejoice the heart of
everybody who desires to take liberties with his own personal consti-
tution. Such an one will chuckle over the announcement that the
temperate and self-denying hero, who sacrificed so much to Italian
unity, has not only suffered in that cause, but is also a martyr to the
§. Ha, ha!” he will exclaim; “here is an instructive case of
irtue Rewarded. The attention of the United Kingdom Alliance is
demanded by a fact highly calculated to induce all thinking persons to
abjure their potations, and addict themselves to port.”
- INTELLECTUAL DESTITUTION.
(From our Islington Reporter.)
THE condition of this Suburb is hourly growing more alarming; the
feelings of the populace have broken out in a most heart-rending and
pity-moving manner. It is no uncommon thing to see a sturdy men-
dicant crouching on the pavement with the words “N9 Foop” before
him; and in like manner the (mentally) starving Islingtonians have
chalked º the walls in various directions their great want of mental
food in the suggestive words “No PUNCH !” This, sad as it may
seem, is an indisputable fact; and we leave those Islingtonians who
have their wits, about them to guess, whether their newsvendors, or
their Trade Unions, should be thanked for it.
Things that Won't Wash.
In a recent Trade Report, under the head of Yarns, it is stated that
“Medium wefts have been sold at prices in favour of purchasers.”
Surely these wefts must have fetched very little to be sold at prices
which were in the purchasers' favour. edium wefts, considered as
spiritual yarns, are tissues of stuff which may be pronounced not worth
a rap.

Love is often very contradictory; for instance, Lovers' Knots are

RECENTLY aperson named MADEN lost a cause because his wife chose
to proclaim in court that she did not believe in a future state of rewards
and punishments. So a host of “sympathisers” have subscribed to
realise a present state of rewards for the dis-believing lady by giving
her a pianoforte and a soirée. The whole proceeding must have been
exquisitely amusing, and, Mr. Punch regrets, that he has not been
favoured with a report of the speeches. But why a pianoforte? Music
was the last thing that should have been offered to a lady, of such
opinions, for while on the one hand we know, on the authority of
ShaksPEARE, or his improvers, that “Angels ever bright and fair,”
indulge in music, we also know on that, of the late MR. BURNs, that
another spirituality came fiddling through a town in order to pick up
an exciseman: , The appropriateness of the gift is on a par therefore
with the good taste that suggested it.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
- “As a man of sense and taste, and one who loves to see good
acting, you of course have been delighted with MR. Fecht ER's Hamlet.
Pray, how many years is it since you were so well satisfied with the
lººf of that part, and so disposed to clap your hands, and cry out
ravo! to the actor Without descending to superlatives, jī you
not agree that you have never seen a more original conception, and
scarce, ever one more carefully and perfectly worked out? . Making
due allowance for his foreign intonation (a defect which it is not
within his power to obliterate, but which becomes less noticed as the
tragedy proceeds) you must allow that M.R. Fecht ER has achieved a
great success, though you may not quite admit that the performance
is “unparalleled,” or allow that it is “universally acknowledged' as
the “greatest triumph” possible in the dramatic art. Such phrases
may well enough to puff a mere pretender, but are unworthily
employed in the case of MR. FECHTER, and I trust that MR. MANAGER
will think fit to withdraw them from his play-bill and advertisements.
For all that croakers say about the stage not being patronised, depend
on it, fine acting will find plenty of admirers, without blowing a trumpet
to attract them to the house.
“This is a free country, I am thoroughly aware, and is blessed with
a free stage as well as a free press. But knowing by report only some-
what of the jealousies of Green Rooms, and of the national antipathies
that swell the British breast, I have not the slightest doubt but that
to some minds there is something most alarmingly audacious in the
notion of a Frenchman undertaking to play SHAKspeaRE, and that too
not in Paris but before a British audience. I think I hear old Clap-
trapp denouncing such impertinence, and declaiming against foreigners
for bringing their, French polish upon our British boards. Zounds!
Sir, the Swan of Avon is not a bird of º: and what business have
these foreigners to lay their impious hands on our Immortal Bard?
old Mouther too is equally indignant at the impudence of one who
dares disturb, the old traditions of our stage, and to read the part
afresh by the light of his own intellect, without looking for enlighten-
ment to the actors whose bright genius has thrown lustre on the past.
Play Hamlet in light hair! O horrible! most horrible! As well play
Julius Caesar without a Roman nose, or “g to represent Othello without
blacking your face! Don't talk to me, Sir, of your German physio-
gnomists, and of light hair being suited to a dreamy and irresolute
meditative character, such as you say the text of SHAKSPEARE is in-
tended to present. jid you ever hear of GARRICK playing Hamlet in
light hair, and don't you think he knew what was proper for the part?
And would the KEMBLEs and the KEANs have stuck to their black
wig, if they had deemed it otherwise than sooted to the text?
“Now, much as I desire the well-being of our actors, I am not dis-
posed to join in crying for Protection to British stage traditions, or in
denouncing, as impertinence, the effort of a Frenchman to read
ShaksPEARE for himself, without having his mind fettered by conven-
tional suggestions, and stagy stale advice. Free trade, say I, in intel-
lect as well as corn and cotton; and when old Mouther cries, ‘What
impudence l’I feel far more inclined to cry out, ‘What a compliment
that a foreigner should take such pains to learn the English language,
and bestow so much love-labour on a most exacting part l” Our Stage
is not so good but that it might be better; and competition may, per:
haps, º our, actors on their mettle, and bring out latent talent-if
there be any hidden. Mind, I don't say I prefer to see a foreigner
play ShakspeaRE, or doubt but that an #ºn possessed of equal
talent would more please me in his part. A foreign tongue, of course,
can’t give right utterance to our language, and can therefore never do
full justice to the text. For all his skill and painstaking, and months
of careful study, MR. Fechter's intonation still grates upon one's ear,
and sadly mars the pleasure one, in spite of it, receives. Such a P.
for instance, as ‘Though Hell itself should garp, can but fall offen-
sively on any English ear; nor do we express pathos }{ drawling out
our vowels j saying, ‘gr-r-a-ace’ and ‘spe-e-e-ak’ instead of
‘grace’ and speak.” These defects I noticed most in the declamatory
passages, and where intensity or violence of feeling is expressed. But
they are scarcely perceived at all in the more colloquial utterance,
wherein (as I think, rightly) the conversations with Polonius and the
players are kept up. Nor, even at their worst, are they more unlike
clear, plain, intelligible English, than the gasps and grunts and gurgles
which, with many an English actor, are supposed to give good utterance
to the words that SHAkspeaRE wrote.
“As we don't get a new Hamlet once in a score of years, or, at any
rate, not one who is worth a second looking at, I may perhaps revisit
the Princess's ere my next, and speak a little more, in detail, of the
merits that I mark. Meanwhile, I would advise all those who like
fº, acting, untrammeled } tradition, to enjoy the present chance.
would advise, them, too, when there, to keep their eyes upon their
opera-glass, rather than their book; for, rightly to º the
points of his performance, MR. FechTER must be looked at all the
while that he is listened to. Let them observe the facial play that
gives such meaning to each word, and note the graceful ease of every
attitude and gesture. Not since the elder KEAN has there been seen
upon our stage a Hamlet with an eye; and if MR. FEchter lacks the
ºinslº of genius, his eye is ever shining with an intellectual
1ght.
“I must add one word more, and that is to advise people who

MR. MYTH informs his Patrons, the Enlightened British Public,
that he has recently succeeded in concluding an Engagement with
those Wonder-Working Artists,
THE SUSPENDED SPIDERS 1
who have astonished All Creation with their astounding feats. These
Arachneal Acrobats are descended from the Fairy race of Flying
Islanders, whom REAR-ADMIRAL PETER WILKINs discovered years
ago upon the shores of the
IDEA ID SEA.
Among the daring acts exhibited by these Aérial Artists, is that
which they have called the
SUPER-SUPPERTABLE SUMMERSAULT
which, at great risk of life and limb, is flung over the heads of the
visitors assembled, who are thus made to participate in the accidents
arising from the
Terrible Trapeze 1
As an additional attraction, and in order to enhance the excitement
that is caused by witnessing the dangers of Suspended Animation, the
BREAK-NECK BROTHERS
will go through their perilous performances, assisted by their relatives
the
CA O U T C H O U C I.C CO U S INS 1
Whose deeds of daring have occasioned such a wonderful sensation in
the acrobatic world. Among their number is the celebrated
Convolvulus Contortionist!
who will perform his tours de force, and terrific twisting tricks. This
superhuman artist is so agile in his movements that none but the most
practised eye can see what he is doing, and his legs and arms change
places with such marvellous rapidity that he appears almost to
TURN HIMSELF CLEAN INSIDE OUT / /
..The JUMPERs OF JAPAN are soon expected to arrive, and will most
likely be accompanied by the
BAND OF BEDOUIN BOUNDERS 1
who have lately been performing at the Court of SQUASHIBUNgo, the
Monarch of Mesopamia, and whom the KING of THE CANNIBAL Islands
honoured, on their leaving him, with a State Dinner of raw meat.
Besides these marvels, MR. MYTH, with utter recklessness of cost,
has engaged that far-famed Seventh Wonder of the World, who is
known in his profession as
The Pocket Hercules ll
from his almost dwarfish stature and yet stupendous strength. Among
his, other bone-thrilling and marrow-moving feats, this great Artist
will display his giant-like abilities by throwing to the ceiling a Thou-
sand-Pound Weight Cannon-Ball, and catching it between his teeth.
He will likewise lift up a Lifeguardsman with his little finger, and will
nightly close his miraculous performances by throwing a double sum-
mersault with his legs in heavy fetters, and firing off an Armstrong gun
upon his back!
..MR. MYTH, in thus announcing his programme for the season, trusts
his efforts will be relished by appreciative patrons, as a proof of his
ambition to refine the public taste. By introducing in a Song Saloon
the acrobatic element, and interspersing Nigger Melodies with the
chances of Broken Necks, MR. MYTH hopes to achieve the Enlighten-
ment of Everyone. In this Mission to the Masses he is aided by the

APRIL 20, 1861.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 167
IT IS NEVER T00 LATE TO LEARN WHO OUR GREAT MEN ARE I
oMETIME lately, at a
meeting at Bodmin
MR. WYLD imparted
the following secret
to his constituents,
who must have been
rather taken by sur-
prise with it:-
“During the Session of
that Parliament, there
was an arduous struggle
going on in the Peninsula
of Italy, and a man whom
he was proud to call his
friend-Garubalpi-was
struggling to emancipate
his country, and to confer
freedom upon some 20
millions of people; he
(MR. WYLD) had humbly
assisted him during the
earlier part of the year,
and he went out to see
what assistance he could
render him at a later
period of the year.”
Taking MR. WYLD
as a favourable speci-
men, we should say
that GARIBALDI would
# be better pleased to
meet many of his
avowed enemies than
several of his so-called
friends. Might we
venture to inquire
what was the nature
of the assistance that
was humbly given by
MR. Wyld to his
“friend?”. We hope
it was not in presenting him with a º of Italy, or in drawing out for him the plan of
#: flºws". or in favouring the Italian liberator with his particular views on
ºn politics.
e shall always think of MR. WYLD as “THE M.P. For BoDMIN AND THE FRIEND of
GARIBALDI.” ow if our modern Atlas, who, supports on his back the Great.Globe,
including Bodmin, and not forgetting Italy, is really anxious to prove himself the “friend.”
he represents himself to be, the wisest thing he can do is never to associate his name with
that of GARIBALDI; for it is no mark of friendship to attempt to bring your friend into
disrespect, even though that friend may be as strong as the Washington of Italy to stand
any amount of ridicule. We regret that MR. WYLD never thought, the moment.he had
returned from his Italian campaign, of having a large engraving drawn of himself giving
instructions to GARIBALDI in geography, pointing out to him the several paths of glory,
with an oustretched mappemonde as big as Leicester Square before them. The absence of the
above has been a national loss—a double national loss, we may say, for Italy, must grieve
over it not less than England—and, by way of humble reparation, will MR.WYLD kindly
promise us, the next time an Italian debate is brought forward, to address the House in a
red shirt?—and if he would only interlard his speech with a few Italian phrases, such as
ºpo di Baccho, or Pescator dell'onda, and the like, we think the success would be certain.
º º: this request in the name of his “friend,” whom he is bound to assist in every way
at he can. -
In the meantime, we wish MR. WYLD, instead of running down into Italy, and bothering
GARIBALDI, would attend a little more to Leicester Square, and make some small endeavour
to keep the filthy place clean and tolerably respectable, for in the present state it would be a
disgrace to the dirtiest metropolis in Europe. It is nothing better than a Great World of dirt
and rubbish. Why don’t the ungrateful inhabitants present him with a broom?

shoes, may be looked upon as somewhat of a
female. There is another point of resemblance
between his Holiness and the ladies. Both. on
certain subjects, are alike deaf to reason. The
obstinacy of the Pontiff relates to Faith, the pig-
headedness of the fair sex regards Fashion. He
will not concede secular Government nor sur-
render young MoRTARA; they refuse to give up
Crinoline. To the demand of justice, common
sense, and expediency, the Pope replies. Non
possumus; and when implored to relinquish a
dangerous, inconvenient, and ridiculous mode of
dress, so say the ladies.
No. 1032*.

“SEVERE.”
DAINTY OLD GENT. “Have I liked my Dinner?—No, I've not / So don't give what I've left to the Cat,
Sir ; because as she's sure to become pie, I should like her to die a natural death, and not be poisoned.”
A HOPEFUL CHARACTER.
For a parent whose paternal
heart has been so severely and
repeatedly lacerated as that of Pio
NoNo, by his own account, the
Holy Father bears up wonderfully.
The foreign correspondent of a con-
º: quoting some remarks
lately made by his Holiness,
says :-
“In the first place I learn that the
Pope says he can reckon on the protective
office of the French army for at least six
months more, and ‘who knows,” ex-
claimed his Holiness, “what may occur
in six months?'"
The Successor of St. Peter may
or may not succeed, or endeavour
to succeed, in following St. Peter's
example, but he is evidently a very
good imitator, whether conscious
or unconscious, of another and a
more modern character, who has
acquired universal celebrity from
a habit which he had of continually
expressing, under the most adverse
circumstances, the hope that some-
thing would turn up. The Pope
in the words above quoted exhibits
the sanguine temperament, and
almost adopts the phraseology, of
Mr. Micawber.
"Most MUSICAL, Most
MELANCHOLY!”
A DISTINGUIshed Ethiopian
being asked, how he º: the
music of the Amber Witch, replied,
“O Golly, Massa SMITH, dat
Amber Witch amber-witching!”
THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF A RULE.
At the inauguration of the Pelly Memorial School, at West Ham,
Essex, the other day, EARL GRANVILLE, who presided on the occasion,
is reported, in apºlogising for an extemporaneous speech, to have
said:—
“However, one of the disadvantages which accrues to me from having hardly
ex d that I could attend—for I thought there would be a meeting of my
colleagues to-day—is this, that I acted on a maxim on which I hope none of my
young friends around me will ever act, of not doing to-day that which I thought
could be done to-morrow."
LoRD GRANyille does himself injustice in decrying the maxim on
which he acted. It is a very good maxim; just as good as the con-
trary, which is inculcated in the copy-books;–"Never defer till to-
morrow that which you can do to-day.” There is wisdom in this
precept; but equally wise is the reverse of it, which EARL GRANVILLE
acted on, “Never do that to-day which you can defer till to-morrow.”
Wisdom is a Janus with two faces, which correspond to the two sides
of every question. Promptitude is wise, but deliberation is equally
wise; procrastination is foolish, but precipitation is equally foolish.
Proverbial, philosophy, unless, when propounded by a TUPPER, is
sometimes too Laconic; as in the case of the copy-book canon above
cited; which requires a little enlargement to be made absolute. To
admonish dilatory youth with perfect accuracy, we should say, “Never
defer that till to-morrow which you had better do to-day,” and, to
school our rash young friends, “Never do that to-day which you will
just as well be able to do to-morrow.” . A wise saw is double-edged,
and some people are not to be trusted to handle it, because they are
apt to scratch themselves with one edge or the other.
ADVICE TO FUNDHOLDERS.
The Income-Tax has expired. Run and get your April dividends
before it revives.
High TREASON.—Asking KING THWAITEs to "stand a drain.”
“Songs WITHouT Words.”—The songs the Tea-kettle sings.
HELPING AN OLD FRIEND.
WE read in the Paris correspondence of the Times that—
“The steel-plated frigate Invincible was launched at Toulon on Thursday lastin
presence of an immense crowd, who arrived from various parts of the department
of the War to witness the sight."
New frigates, fresh launches every day, troops collected in thousands
at the ports ready to sail at a moment's notice, and the dockyards kept
in the greatest activity! . Of course it all means Peace—but from the
above prognostications, if we were our friend Wiscount WILLIAMs,
we should feel strongly tempted to pronounce the above Department
of the War to be the real War Department of France.
How will you Have it?
In a recent bankruptcy case MR. CoMMIssionER FANE enunciated
the startling doctrine that “Bankers ought to ask questions in plain
English.” *}. bosh! Does this judicial euphuist imagine that the
banking world is going to submit to any such tyranny ? Perhaps he
thinks that when one presents a cheque, a banker's clerk is to say—
“In what notes or coins, Sir, do you wish to receive the amount here
specified.” Does he suppose that such an effeminate form of words is
to supersede the accustomed “Oulyavit º’” Nothing of that sort,
MR. CoMMIssionER.
c'est LA MAME chose.
AMONG the various columns in the Census returns, filled up on the
7th instant, was one requiring each person to specify whether he was
“married” or “unmarried,” and another in which all “blind” persons
were enumerated. The latter column appeared somewhat superfluous,
for to get at the number of the blind, it was surely only necessary to
add up the lists of the married?—so at least says a Correspondent,
signing himself “A WIDE-Awake BAchELoR.”

APPENDIX TO THE AMERICAN ANTHEM.
TUNE–0övious.
WE’ve got into a pretty fix,
My countrymen, by Jingo!
Through our confounded politics;
Spain's down on St. Domingo!
She takes this turn in our affairs,
This crisis grave and weighty,
To gain her ends, and unawares
Goes in to win all Hayti!
Oh, what a change comes o'er our dream!
Öur once unit: nation
The other day proposed the scheme
Of Cuba's annexation;
And now you have the hand of Spain
Stretched forth to take possession,
Were that isle ours, could we restrain
The Spaniards from aggression?
Come let us discord slick forego,
And difficulties banish,
Or else we shall be, no ways slow,
Chawed up by them there Spanish.
The MUNRo doctrine, dirt and all,
We shall be forced to swallow,
And if we do to pieces fall,
| The Dons will lick us hollow.
Would North and South conjoin again
By pressing facts invited,
The now dissevered States would then,
Becoming reunited;
A mighty people recompose,
Once more to flog creation,
Instead of stooping to her foes,
And suffering flagellation.
“Over, Fork Over.”
THE Times remarks that marriage is “a very hº
pitched relation.” Young SNoBKINs, who was in love
with his cousin EUPHEMIA, says that he was also a very
highly pitched relation when he proposed marriage, for
his indignant uncle threw him bang over the garden wall.
SURGERY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASSES.
SUPPose you are troubled with a cataract, that is to say, not with a
waterfall in your neighbourhood, but with an obstruction in your eye.
You may have this nuisance abated by a surgical operation. This, if
you are a labouring man, you can, by procuring a letter of recom-
mendation to a hospital, get done for thanks. If you are a peer of the
realm, or a banker, or a railway director, or a great builder, or a
prince, or a bishop, you will have the best operator in London to couch
your cataract; that is, to destroy or pick out the diseased part of your
eye, namely, the crystalline lens turned white and opaque. For
rendering you that important service, †. will present your surgeon
with a cheque for two or three thousand pounds, to encourage science,
and to reward him for giving professional assistance to the poor. But
if you are a respectable tradesman, or an attorney, or a barrister as yet
only rising, or a parson of moderate preferment, then you will pay the
professor who enucleates your crystalline capsule the average market
price for the job, which may be put at about £50. , Now this is what

those which surround a man in an infirmary 1
No such resource for gentlemen does apparently exist, but an
accommodation of the kind has been provided for ladies. It is named
the “London Surgical Home.” Its second anniversary festival was
held the other evening. Its object is that of affording surgical assis-
tance in curable cases, to gentlewomen who can afford to pay, some-
thing towards their own support; and, as its name implies, it houses
them as well; which is a great advantage; for you cannot always coin-
mand at home, the water-beds and other machinery requisite for the
comfortable treatment, for example, of broken bones. Neither can
you get, on reasonable terms, any better nurses than stupid old women.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mon DAY. April 15. It may suit MR. GLADstone to take three
hours to detail the contents of his Budget, but Mr. Punch has no
|..." whatever of being so wasteful of words. Here is the
udget:—
“Though the Lords choose to vapour, off, Duty on Paper!
One Penny I rescue from Income-Tax trickery;
Divers Licences mention, not worth your attention;
And, lastly, I double the Duty on Chicory.”
There is the Budget, and if MR. GLADSTONE had come to Mr. Punch
and asked him for leave to print the above on a neat little card, which
might have been inclosed to the Members, the CHANCELLOR would
have saved himself the trouble of talking for 175 minutes while an
atrocious East Wind was soughing round the House and waiting to
catch him when he should come out. Add that he says he shall have a
surplus of £1,922,000 instead of the Deficiency which his enemies had
been predicting, and that he garnished his eloquent speech with some
fun about LADY GoDIVA, and his paying his own addresses to two
young ladies at once, Miss Direct and Miss Indirect Taxation, and
that he introduced Latin quotations which are thus corrected by the
Morning Chronicle (price one penny):—
“Aurerus et simili frondescit virga meballo,"
and
“Ergo alte vestiga carſe manu.”
the Gladstonian exploit for 1861 is summed up. It may be as well to
add, that the other day LoRD PALMERSTON was assuring us that we
needed all our costly defensive preparations against our friend the
Elected of the Millions, and that to-night MR. GLADstoNE spoke
emphatically against the war expenditure of the country. When the
Coalition does agree, its unanimity is wonderful; but we cannot expect
wonders all through the Session.
There was not much discussion after the Budget-Speech, indeed
MR. GLADstoNE had rained such a shower of figures upon the heads of
the Committee that they were bewildered, and Members began doing
all sorts of wild sums on the paper, dividing 13 by 27, subtracting
whilst Wit, and especially that grade of it that
takes the form of Satire, is the art of saying
º things that are the cause of smarting in
others.
403 from 179, and performing similar vagaries, in order to look as if
they were considering the Minister's details. But most people seemed
pleased that no new taxes were to be laid on; and, after a little dispute
as to whether M.R. GLADstoNE had been the sweetest friend or the
bitterest enemy of the agricultural interest, the Chicory Resolution
was put and carried. Whether the rest of the Chicory Budget will be
as easily got through, Mr. Punch profoundly remarks, nous verrons.
The Lords did not sit for an hour, but most of them who are capable
of understanding a financial speech came into the House of Commons
to hear M.R. Gladston E.
Tuesday. But to-night their Lordships met to better purpose, and
read the Bankruptcy Bill a Second Time. That plan of it; one law
for the Trader and the Non Trader seems to give much uneasiness to
the superior classes, who appear to be awfully afraid of being “nabbed,”
a state of mind that indicates some little habitual irregularity in
accounts. LoRD Chelmsford, on behalf of the Non-Traders,
threatens to doctor the Bill in Committee. He was not very lucky in
a remark that the House of Commons had not given due attention to
the measure, for during part of the debate in the Second Reading of the
most important Bill of the Session, there were Four lords on one side
of the House and the same number on the other, and never more than
thirty-seven.
In the Commons a Bill for enabling people to make railways in the
streets came on for Second Reading. This is the plan of MR. TRAIN,
an American gentleman, who has actually got two of such railways at
work in London, and who, if he never does anything else, deserves the
gratitude of the English Lady for shaming the proprietors of the dirty
inconvenient nuisance called the British Omnibus, by producing a
vehicle into which a woman can step decently, and sit in cleanliness
and comfort. Also for substituting neatly uniformed and civil men
for the coarse, cads who at present bawl behind the buss. How-
ever, the question of giving the powers required by this Bill is a dis-
tinct one from that of the advantage of the TRAIN vehicles, and the
Bill was negatived, after—perhaps because of a smart speech in its
favour from MR. BRight.
The mantle of Spooner has fallen upon WHALLEY. The latter has
taken up the Maynooth question. He fixed Tuesday the 30th, for his
débit, and in the interests of humanity MR. BRAND will be good
enough to mark that night ſor a Count Out.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. A. SMITH is sorely troubled about the sea-shore of this island.
He has got a notion that the QUEEN is always trying to get hold of it
for HER MAJESTY's own purposes, and he wanted a Committee on the
point. The ATToRNEY-GENERAL made great fun of him and his sup-
jorters, explained the real theory of real property, namely, that all the
and in England is imagined to be held by grant from the Crown, but
that the Crown holds the sea-shore in trust for the whole community,
and therefore cannot either grab or grant it, and that the rights of the
public are taken perfect care of. On division MR. SMITH and the
other he-Nereids were beaten by 176 to 67. Then another SMITH got
up to bore about the Navy Estimates, but somebody happened to see
that SMITH had only 28 Members to bore, whereupon that inhumanity
was incontinently cut short.
Wednesday. The Bill for letting Dissenters be Trustees of the
Endowed Schools was to have gone into Committee, but the House
seemed to think that enough had been done to please the Dissenters of
late, and that they were getting rather bumptious. And as these are
Church of England schools (according to the accepted theory), the
claim of the Dissenters, who have nothing to do with paying for them
to come in and manage them, does not seem uncommonly strong. At a
events such orators as Dissent boasts in the House of Commons could
not make out their case, and the Bill was thrown out by 200 to 171,
amid loud Conservative cheering.
Then came the You-may-marry-your-wife's-sister-Bill, which was
very briefly debated, and which met with an unaccustomed fate. It
generally passes the Commons, and then Lawn comes down on it with
Leviticus, but to-day the Puseyites and others in the Commons
.. to refuse the Second Reading by 177 to 172, and there was
more loud Conservative cheering.
A Bill for preventing servant girls and glaziers from tumbling into
the area when cleaning windows, was read a First Time. Mr. Punch
has not yet had an opportunity of seeing the machinery by which this
desirable object is to be brought about, but he begs distinctly to say
that he is not going to have his beading pulled out and his sashes
turned round, because that knocks off the gilding and #. and the
windows never shut º after such an operation. If Members of
Parliament like to come with ladders, and clean his windows, outside,
with their own pocket-handkerchiefs, he has no particular objection;
but, they must distinctly understand that they are not to ask the
publisher for beer.
To-day did the Wiscount PALMERston, Constable of Dover, and
Warden of the Five Ports (name them, Wiscount, and don't begin
with Sherry, because that’s a bad joke. Eh, you can't We thought
so), took the oaths and his seat, after his re-election for Tiverton, and
recovery from gout. He was introduced by SIR. GeoRGE GREY and
the Lord ADvocate For Scotland, and did not seem particularly
embarrassed. Constable PAM (A. 77) was loudly cheered; and Mr.
Punch's ineffable scream might have been heard high above all the
Voices of the inferior creatures. He hopes that the Mansion House
dinner, the same night, was “just the thing the doctor ordered,” but
CUBITT came rather close upon podagra.
Thursday. On the question of the maltreatment of a British officer
by the Prussian authorities, Lord SBAFTesBURY pronounced the mild
decision, that “nothing can be more melancholy nor more inhospitable
than the system of Prussian administration, #. the highest to the
lowest functionary.” That is a good sweeping Exeter Hall denun-
ciation, much in the style in which the Philadelphionites consign all
ºther sects to an indefinitely unpleasant hereafter ; but in the case of
Prussia, LoRD SHAPresbury's clean sweep may do but justice to the
dirty sweeps of officials.
. There was a good deal of squabbling in the Commons on some points
in the Estimates; but the noticeable portion of the discussion was an
awful castigation inflicted by the Constable on BERNAL Osborne, who
had been ſetting off some dogmatic flippancies upon our military
defences. PAM rebuked him for his presumption, exposed his mis.
takes, and congratulated the country that its defences did not depend
upon his knowledge or decision. He described MR. Osborne's style
* the Light and Violent. B.O. got so wrathful at this that he forgot
is manners, and said that LoRD PALMeRston was cross after
gºlchicum—an unlucky remark which of course the good-natured
Constable turned round upon BERNAL, recomunending him to take
colchicum, which most persons were aware was a “sedative.” On the
whole, BERNAL got rather sat upon to-night and left out in the cold.
Friday. LoRD ELLENBOROUGH, at great length, demanded what the
overnment was doing in reference to the Pope. LoRD Wodehouse,
at great shortness, explained that the Government was doing nothing
:cept leaving Popish problems to Papist powers. LoRD, DERby sai
that this was quite right, but that the Pope ought to be free, and that,
* Lord John Russell had said, Italy should be divided into two
states, and then Rome, in the middle, would be no difficulty. How far
the King of Italy, by the grace of Garibaldi, will take this turning
is, dominions, into a sandwich, with the Pope as the bit of meat,
perhaps M. D'Azeglio will expound.
LoRD PUNCH did not coerce his Marylebone vassals, and, as might
have been expected, they availed themselves of his indulgence, and of
course returned the wrong man. Instead of electing Mr. WING Rove
CookE, whom everybody knows and honours, they, under the dictation
of a leash of shopkeepers, have elected a MR, HARVEY Lewis, who
may have all the virtues and talents in the world, but of whom all that
is known at present is that he is a rich Irishman. This comes of Mr.
Punch's generosity—another time Marylebone will get its head broken.
MR. Lewis took his seat to-night. He is, of course, ultra-Liberal in
rofession, and pledged to vote that the moon is made of green cheese,
if his constituents take that astronomical view.
MR. B. CochRANE asked whether Government would produce the
recent despatches from Warsaw P LORD John replied, first, that they
would not; and, secondly, that there were no recent despatches.
An Indigo-Planter Debate, originated by MR, LAYARD, brought up
some facts of importance. The Constable was taken to task for letting
the Tiverton Volunteers accompany him at his election, a horribly
unconstitutional thing, and it, need not be said that the Warden
explained the matter very jovially. There was some discussion about
the Donegal eviction (the case in which a landlord, baffled in his
endeavours to improve his estates, and incensed at the conduct of the
tenants in secreting criminals, has swept out a large number of per-
sons), and the feeling of the House seemed to be, that there was a good
deal to be said on both sides. And, Volunteers, perpend. A Bill was
brought in to exempt you from paying tolls, so you will be able to
afford to buy extra copies of Punch to send to your friends abroad.
Will not that be nice?
Boy (sings popular air). “I’d choose ter be er daisy,
If I might be er flower.”
EGGS AND YOKE.
The other day one of ReuteR's telegrams, dated Agram, said:—
“The Diet has been opened to-day. The Ban was honoured with a popular
ovation on the occasion.”
We hope the Ban liked it. The ovation which he received at the
hands of the people may for etymological and other reasons have been
presumed to have been an egging. The Diet was naturally opened on
the occasion, and the contents, diffused over the Ban's face, must have
given it the appearance of a sweet omelet. We don't know who the
present Ban of Croatia is; but an ovation must have been just the
thing for a JELLAchich.
A Delegate Question.
. CoMPARATIves are sometimes odious, as well as are comparisons. For
instance, when a clever workman is fool enough to listen to a pothouse-
haunting Delegate, and to ruin himself by striking when his children
are half-starving, instead of saying simply that he is going to pot,
would it not place his folly in a far more hateful light if it were
observed that he was going to Pottek P

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DeAR PUNCH,
“You may recollect that in the first of these interesting
letters I gave my thanks to two new actors who had just made their
débitt, for having each afforded me a pleasant evening's entertainment.
I considered their performances to be of no small promise, and this
anticipation I am happy to confirm. Widely different as they are in
the parts which they present, MR. DREw and MR. FechTER have at
least this much in common, that their acting is unstagy, natural, and
not forced, and free from the conventional absurdities of art. ivisited
the Lyceum a night or two ago, and spent a pleasant hour in seeing
MR. DREw, whom I shall be glad to re-welcome to our boards. The
pieces that he played in were the trashiest of rubbish, but he had
enough to do to show that he was capable of more; and when next he
comes to London, I hope he may be fitted with a part which is adapted
to bring out his capacities, and give his talent proper scope. MR.
DREw when on the stage is an Irishman all over, and does not betray
his birthplace merely by his brogue. You will hear but few if any of
the “tare and owns /’ and the ‘och murthers!” and the thousand and
one other stale old stupid interjections where with stage Irishmen are
wont to interlard their conversation. But in his utterance and tone
and manner of expression, and perhaps even still more in his quaint
angular deportment, you recognise the Irishman of actual existence,
free from the traditions of footlights and of greenrooms, and bringing
a fresh vigour to the characters he plays. A piece more clumsy and
worse-written than the Irish Emigrant it has very rarely been my
misery to witness; and it affords but little chance for the cleverest of
actors to interest the house. But MR. DREw made the utmost of the
amali talk that was given him; and his pathos when half-starving, and
first getting gift of food, fully showed him to be capable of something
more than moving the laughter of his audience, to which the efforts of
stage Irishmen are in general confined.
“While I speak of stage tradition, I should like to make it clear
that there are some pieces where it is most legitimately used, and
which indeed without it lose their chief effect. Such a one for instance
is the Miller and his Men, which seems written to perpetuate the conven-
tionalities of the stage, and which when robbed of them becomes a vapid
stupid piece. As acted at the Haymarket, I think it a mistake, and
the pains which have been taken to present it in new shape appear to
me to have deprived it of its only real charm. I have no belief in
Grindoff without a broad black belt, and yellow ochred boots; and the
man who would reform the hairy-faced and hoarse-voiced ruffian of
my youth into the refined and polished scamp of later years, sadly
interferes with many pleasurable memories, without giving me the
chance of one to cherish in their stead.
“There is a pretty little piece now playing at the º: which
they who like Miss Louise KEELEY should not miss the chance of
seeing. It is called The Little Savage—I beg your pardon, MR.
Author, I mean the The Little Rebel—and is translated, 1. from
Une Fille Terrible, whereas the other piece I mentioned is taken, I am
told, from La Niase de St. Fleur. (It is as well to be particular in
owning obligations, lest one be charged with debts that one has really
not incurred.) They who know Miss KEELEY's sprightly, arch,
expressive acting, may conceive how she impersonates a hoydenish
young lady, who in order to disgust a superannuated suitor makes-
believe to be a romping, just-emancipated schoolgirl, who half-strangles
him with skipping-ropes and makes him play at ball,
“The Chimney Corner still is an attraction at this theatre, and I
doubt not pleases all who enjoyed the Porter's Knot. MR. Robson is
well fitted with a character, of a sort that he has made peculiarly
his own, and which abounds in quick transitions from alternate smiles
to tears.
“MR. Gye has been out tenor-fishing during the recess; and, after
trying somewhere near the margin of Zurich's fair waters and other
spots which are at times frequented by fine fish, he has landed a fine
specimen, a Signor TIBERINI, who may have sprung, for aught I
know, from the banks of the Tiber. Leaving critics to determine
whether or no he really be a tenor pur sang, and capable of giving out
the ut de poitrine, I am content to recollect that he has pleased me as
a singer, and as an actor has evinced himself well grounded in his art.
If he have not the grace and sweetness of MARio and RUBIN1, the
energy of TAMBERLIK, or sustained notes of Giuglini, he has enough
charms of his own to make his voice worth hearing; and as a perfect
tenor is rather a rare fish, I think we may congratulate the active
MR. Gye on having made so good a catch. “ONE who PA1s.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 175
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DeAR PUNCH,
“Porto FRANco is, as everyone knows, pleasantly situated-
I beg pardon—situate, I believe, is the correct expression—on the
shores of the Mediterranean, and, as a watering-place, is much fre-
quented in the autumnal months by the German and Russian nobility;
Suites of apartments are prepared every season in the Albergo del'
Universo for his Serene Highness the PRINce of SPITZFLEMANkoff and
retinue, for the Duc De GRUFFAU, the BARoness KRAUTSTRUNK, and
his Excellency Count Bowwowski; while in the hall of the Aquila
Nera (the opposition hostelry) you may read the more familiar names
of "Lady Rowzer et famille, MR. and MRs. Sey MoUR BROWNNR,
GENERAL STALKER, MR. ADolphus STALKER, and Miss STRIDE. , .
"After the usual horrors of the Dogana (mitigated perhaps on this
occasion by a few judiciously scattered francs), MR, Dewberry and I
established ourselves at the last-named inn on the night of our arrival,
and for that night only; for the next day, on asking for our little bill,
we were favoured with one of those curious results of double multi-
lication for which the hotel keepers at Porto Franco have long been
justly celebrated. So after having paid it, and having beaten about in
search of apartments, we took up our quarters at No. 999, Via di
Bricconi: terzo piano. -
“You may suppose we were at first, as in duty bound, out all day in
a fiacre “doing’ the various lions of this wonderful city. The Palazzo
Publico, the Campo Cavalli, the Ponto Tenebroso, the famous Piazza
Reale, and the Casa di’ Čentodore, have long been celebrated in
history, and described again and again in numerous works, from LoRD
TIMON's noble verses down to Miss MADGE's Memoranda Mediter-
raneana. So I shall not trouble you with any information which is
afforded in MR. ALBEMARLE's excellent Handbook, where you will find
all the necessary and appropriate quotations from the aforesaid valued
writers, with as much more matter as ſº can conveniently remember.
Indeed I fear that these letters will treat of subjects thoroughly
modern and unromantic, and I shall humbly leave the fifteenth for the
nineteenth century, nor trouble the heroes of a former age, while I
describe the swells of the present.
“Dick used to devote a ſº proportion of his time to that species
of exercise which is generally known among young gentlemen of like
pursuits as ‘loafing;' that is, walking about with no special object, but
ready for any adventure which may turn up. In MR. DEwBERRY's
case, perhaps, the occupation assumed a more useful aspect, as he took
care to note where the best tobacco was to be bought, what merchants
retailed BAss's famous ale, which of the hotels contained the greatest
number of pretty girls, &c. &c. For my part, being always remarkable
for industry, I devoted myself with great vigour to the various picture-
galleries and churches in the City. I do not, however, intend to
recount all that I did for the sake of my beloved art at Porto Franco.
Perhaps the result of my researches will appear in the meetings of the
Philographic Community. Perhaps I may be going to publish an essay
‘On the Pigments of Perugino.” Perhaps I look forward to the
honour of being permitted to attach some score of capital letters to
my at present obscure name—I say perhaps—and say no more.
“I crave your indulgence for this digression, into which I have been
unconsciously led in a moment of ambition, and beg to resume my
narrative. - -
“I came across some curious ſº in the course of my stay at
Porto Franco, and when Dick and I met of an evening over a pipe, we
used to relate to each other our respective adventures, sitting up, as
I am ashamed to add, until a nost unconscionable hour in the morning,
whereas every well-conducted English traveller in Italy ought to be in
bed and asleep by 9 o'clock, P.M., if we may put any faith in the rules
laid down in MR. ALBEMARLE's crimson compendium.
“The first of our beloved countrymen whom I had the pleasure to
meet was MR. Bowpen, Architect and Surveyor to the district of
Stuccotown, N.W. I give his title in full for the benefit of my readers,
because, to say the honest truth, I had never heard of that talented
entleman (at which he seemed much surprised) until he introduced
imself to me at Porto Franco in the manner following, widelice-
“I was sitting one morning in the church of San Goggolo, very
intent upon a sketch that I was making, when I suddenly became
aware of a strong flavour of stale and rather lº. tobacco, and
chancing to look over my shoulder, saw MR. B. there, grinning.
“‘Go hon,’ said he, “don’t mind me-brother chip, you know—all
in the way o' trade. , I say—got a bit of Hingey-rubber about you, to
lend a chap P I’ve lost mine.’
“His fingers were not over-clean, and I thought that giving him a
iece of the article in question was preferable to lending him the whole.
I began to cut off a bit with my penknife.
“‘Hullo!” said MR. Bowpen, “what are you hup to? No call for
that, you know—give it back to you in arf a minnit. And, snatching
it up, he ran off. After a little time, he came back. "Nice bit, aint
it?’ said he, looking at my sketch. “I did it, yes'day. I say! you
aint a harchiteck, are yer?” -
“‘No,' said I.
“‘No; I thought not by your drawering—I ham.”
“I congratulated him on his advantage.
“Har, yes, it's all very well, he added, “but then you fellers,
you painters, top us in colour, }} know. There’s very few harchitecks
twigs anything about colour. D'ye know'ORRocks?”
“I was obliged to admit that I didn't.
: º Nºw 'ORRocks the harchiteck!’
º o.”
“‘Dam clever chap, I can tell you,” said M.R. Bowpen, with a
terrific wink. “Colours ſust-rate, and no mistake. I say,” said he,
‘’scuse me, you know, but them pillars ain't straight—them on the
paper I mean—the drawering's hout.”
... I told him I knew it, and intended to alter the mistake,
“‘Never mind, though,” added MR. B. quite consolingly, ‘It’ll make
a pretty drawering for all that, mind you." Got your shadders in bold
and sharp' . -
“(It was quite impossible for me to go on with my work, so I rose
from my seat for a minute or two, hoping he would go; but he didn't.)
“Yes! nice bit,” said he, musingly; “but after all, wot is it?' (with
a mock Italian gesture). ‘What is it? The churches here ain't worth
a jigger-no, not half a jigger!’
“While I was speculating what amount of intrinsic value the latter
substantive might represent, he went on:
“‘Nothing like the Habbey, after all—give me the Habbey, I say.”
“‘I beg your pardon?” said I, not quite understanding.
“The Habbey.” said MR. Bowpen, emphatically. “Our hone
Westminster! ...That’s your sort. Give me the Habbey, I say!”
“(I wished it had been in my power to do so, or anything, to get
rid of him.
“But, Lor, what a place this Porto Franco is!' continued MR;
BowPEN, apostrophising. “What a rum, what a dam rum place!
Just think how many hages and hages—I say,” said he, as if suddenly
struck with a new idea, ‘seen the Pescaria yet?’
“‘No, Sir,’ said I, in a great rage, and wishing, I am ashamed to
add, he was at that moment tied down at the bottom of a roomy fish-
basket in that emporium.
“‘Not seen the Pescaria? Why ’ow long 'ave you bin 'ere?”
“Just arrived.”
“‘Ho, ah—jist come!—that’s another pair of shoes,’ said my tor
mentor, mollified, ‘I’ve bin 'ere two months and 'aven't seen art
You'll 'ave to look sharp if you want to Do the place well. . .Work

... “‘Thank you, Sir, said I (for you see I never like to offend a man
if I can help it). “I haven't a card about me at this moment, but I
lodge in the Via Bricconi,' and I gave him my address, fondly hoping
he would lose it.
“‘All right,” said MR. B., going off, “oreyvor.” Suddenly he
stºpped and came back.
“‘By the way,” said he, ‘I think you said you did not know

“‘Yes, said I, why?”
“‘Oh, nothing ! never mind—ta-ta-doesn't signify,” and here MR.
BowPEN went off to his ‘fajey-oley,’ and to the great relief of
“Your humble servant,

Right at Last.
A GENTLEMAN, who for some time past, has been trying with all his
might to make a joke upon Marylebone, is delighted at the opportunity
of being able to say that, in consequence of the election, it has of
course been the “Bone of contention.” We like encouraging young
beginners, and that is our only excuse for putting before the reader so
miserable an attempt, the extreme weakness of which would disgrace
even a Member of Parliament.

SETTLEMENT OF THE ITALIAN QUESTION.
WHAT right has the College of Cardinals to choose a
sovereign for the people of the Roman States? This
|question should be answered by the sticklers for the
Pope's temporal authority. They insist on his prescrip-
tive rights, as though he were a legitimate monarch;
whereas he is merely an elective one, and one elected,
not by the people, but only by a set of priests. These
considerations suggest an easy settlement of the Italian
difficulty. Let Louis NApoleon, Victor EMMANUEL,
and GARIBALDI agree to allow his Holiness to remain
where he is for the present, sitting in the chair of
Boagla, supported comfortably on French, bayonets,
with seat and cushion intervening hetween their points
and his person. Let the Holy Father enjoy a life-
interest in that position. Butlet their Euliuences have
due notice that the next Pope they elect, they must
elect him simply for their own Bishop; and that lie
must take the Pontificate as it will come to him, a
purely spiritual office, and accept the triple hat without
any crown.
Steel versus Wood.
In the next naval war, if an enemy's fleet has to be
blocks, they have now steel plates. BRITANNIA, when:
ever she turns her trident into an etching-needle, will
make just as good a mark with the latter as with the
former. By the bye, when these steel plates want touch-
ing up, they will have, we suppose, to be taken not into
a graver's but an engraver's dock?
A DIG AT THE DELEGATES.
DURING the late Strike (we believe that we may speak of it now in
the past tense) we often heard the question, “Who are these Trade
Delegates of whom we hear so much, and who seem, by all accounts,
to be doing so much mischief?” Now, as ignorance is not always
bliss, we think it may do good if information on the matter be made
tº." known, and there is no way that we know of to make it
nown more widely than through the world-pervading medium of
Punch., Give ear, then, O ye rustics, and ye town workmen also.
* be striking truths, which all on strike should pay good
eed to.
A Delegate is generally a lazy, idle lout, who likes to sit and talk
much better than to work; and who, considering himself as being
gifted with the gab,” tries to foster small dissensions and causes of
dispute, that he may have the pleasure of hearing himself prate about
them. In other words, he is a drone that goes buzzing about the beer.
shops, and living upon the honey that the working bees have toiled
for...His business is to set a man against his master, and to keep afloat
the Unions that tend to nurture Strikes, by giving men a false idea of
their own strength, and underrating, the resources and resistance of
employers. Having duped the shallow-pated to elect him as their
mouthpiece, and being paid by them to ſead a lazy life in looking to
what he is pleased to call their interests, the Delegate grows fat on
their starvation and their strikes, and what is death to them becomes
to him the means of life." Fancied grievances and most unreasonable
demands the Delegate endeavours to encourage and support, for
squabbling brings him into notice and his tongue into full play, and
raises his importance in the pothouse-haunting world. A claim for
ten hours' pay for only nine hours' work, is just the sort of trade
demand that a Delegate delights in; for he knows that its injustice
must prevent its being listened to, and he will have the chance of
swigging nightly, gratis, pots of beer while denouncing the iniquity of
the rapacious masters, in all the frothy eloquence of a public-house
harangue.
As nobody but a fool would submit to have his earnings eaten into
by a sloth, it is the business of the Delegate to clap a stop on clever-
ness, and keep the brains of working-men down to the muddle-pated
level of those who are his tools., He, of course, fears the quick sight
of any workman of intelligence, lest it may see through his iniquitous
designs. He, therefore, gets the best hands marked on the Black, Lis
and does the utmost in his power to reduce the active, skilful, an
industrious working-man to the standard of the stupid, slothful,
sluggish sot. Britons may keep boasting that they never will be
slaves, but so long as MR. Potter and his myrmidons have sway, the
slavery of negroes is not more complete.
As the law at present stands, a few months on the treadmillis the
most that can be given as a punishment to Delegates who illegally
prevent a man from working where he likes. But when we see a
national work suspended through their means (as was a month ago the
case with the new Exhibition Building), we feel tempted to suggest
that a suspension of the works should be followed now and then by a
suspension of a Delegate.

KING BUMBLE OF MARYLEBONE.
GREAT BUMBLE–mightiest of Kings—whose throne
Looms high and haughty over Marylebone,
Within whose vestry-room, a big Bashaw,
Thou rul'st the rate, and layest down the law—
Local self-government's triumphant son—
Unſetter'd majesty of Number One—
Fresh from the ’Tizer or the Morning Star—
Guide of the tap, and leader of the bar—
Student sublime in penny-wisdom's school—
Great art thou in thy hour of vestry rule,
Sneering humanitarian humbug down
With Beadledom's big voice and savage frown,
Putting on jobs a face of stubborn brass,
And writing down who differs with thee–ASS;
'Gainst Central checks still warring to the knife,
And saving rates at the expense of life:
Mighty to teach thin Chaplains whence their bread,
To snub pert Doctors, better taught than fed,
Or to crush sunken paupers lower still,
That Poor-Law Boards may rev'rence BUMBLE's will.
Great art thou, too, in genial hours of ease,
When nor job calls, nor vile Inspectors tease;
Whether within the tap thou spend'st thy noons—
King of clay-pipes, and sovereign o'er spittoons—
Or, venting oracles behind thy smoke,
In frowzy club-room crack'st the midnight joke,
Or, taking what thou wilt not give—a drain—
Heark’nest the nigger minstrels’ graceful strain.
Thine is the graceful pleasantry that grows
rom calling names to pulling by the nose;
Thine British drinks—hot with or cold without,
The quassia'd ale, or treacle-coloured stout;
No light, low-tariffed foreign wines for thee—
Leave them to washerwomen tired of tea—
KING BUMBLE needs a more sustaining tap,
His brain in muddled majesty to wrap,
To feed the mulberry blossoms on his nose,
And in his bloated cheek maintain the rose.
But if thou’rt great in act of Westry-power—
Great in the public-house's festive hour—
Greater by ten- and twenty-fold art thou,
When an Election bids thy subjects bow!
Qh, 'tis a sight England alone can show,
|. America the like may know,)
he struggle who shall kiss thy greasy palm,
Who smooth thy moods with flattery's oiliest balm,
Who lowest grovel at thy dirty foot,
Who lick most mud from thy unsavoury boot,
Who, at thy bidding, nimblest turn his coat,
Or gulp down pledges with the readiest throat.
Then art thou every inch a king, when, bowed
And bowing, thy poor slaves the hustings crowd,
And offer up themselves, obsequious still,
To pelt, poke fun at, hoot, howl down, at will.
Praying, all abject, that their King will deign
To put them to the question—once—again!
True Christians they–when the left cheek you smite,
They turn to you, submissively, the right,
“Wilt please your Majesty repeat the blow—
Too happy to amuse my sovereign so.”
“But condescend once more my powers to try
Qf eating toads and swallowing humble-pie.”
“Nay, Sire, a rarer sport your slave affords;
Before your throne I'll eat up my own words.”
“A Six-pound Franchise SNoBson recommends;
For Household Suffrage I go in, my friends;
And if for Household Suffrage Šsonson call,
For Universal I’m prepared to bawl;
If he goes the whole hog, I’ll let him know
I am the man a wholler hog to go—
Under his lowest deep I’ll find a deep more low!”
At country-fair or wake so have I seen,
Upon the stage that decks the village green,
Amid the peasant minstrels' brazen din,
Ambitious rustics through horse-collars grin.
And he—for such the rule that guides their play—
Who grins the widest bears the prize away.
So have I seen four rival clods, set high,
In eating red-hot hasty pudding vie,
And his the honours of that painful feast
Who eat the fastest, and who winced the least.
Like º: are thine, but on a scale for gods—
Who hast would-he M.P.s for village clods;
To †. through Bumbledom's horse-collars wide,
And eat the dirty puddings you provide.
For the rude village stage, the scene they grace,
Is the tall hustings reared in Portland Place.
For hat, or smock, or leg-of-mutton thin,
A seat in Parliament’s the prize they win:
And for the judgment of the rustic crowd,
KING BUMBLE's mighty will is law avowed!
BANKS ON BOARD SHIP.
ERUsing the Times, we ob:
served a novelty in naval
arrangements thus pro-
posed by a Portsmouth
Correspondent of that
iournal, with a view to
prevent the evils of the
present system of paying
sailors:-
“The simple plan to remedy
all this is now before the Admi-
ralty, and there may be hopes of
its being at some time adopted.
This plan is the establishment
of banks on board each ship in
commission, the men receiving
a fair rate of interest.”
We read the foregoing
at breakfast; when, sud-
denly, a quick succession
of raps upon the table
made the tea-things dance.
Having, as the editor of
the Spiritual Magazine
says, changed our opinions
on the subject of Spiritual-
ism, we immediately seized
an alphabet, in order to see
if the knocks proceeded
from any spirit desirous of communicating any message. The
invisible agent knocked out “Ship ahoy!” Fact. We directly
answered “Yohol" to which the reply was “Avast! Belay there!”
We then shouted, “Who are you?” and the spirit responded
“DiBDIN 1..? whereupon we put the question, “What cheer, ho?”
but instead of directly answering that interrogatory, our unseen
visitant gave some ºn: raps, the letters corresponding whereunto
spelt “Shiver my timbers!” In reply to further inquiries, the
spirit said, that he was in a good berth, but that his rest was dis-
turbed by the idea of such a prodigious innovation, as that of a
bank on board ship, which he could conceive to be capable of serving
no purpose with regard to Jack, who, spent most of his money
in helping messmates in distress, and the remainder in purchasing
watches to fry, except that of supplying him with notes to light his
pipe with. A sweet little Providence sat up aloft to keep watch for
the life of poor Jack; but poor JAck had no providence of his own,
and must now have become rich Jack to be ever in a position to put
money in a bank. “If Jack required a bank on board ship, scuttle his
scuppers, Jack was not what he used to be, d'ye see, but another guess
sort of fellow.” Having delivered this opinion, the spirit wished us
good-bye, saying that he must now go, because all hands were piped aloft.
Whosoever shall refuse to credit the foregoing narrative, let him be
confounded. He is a prejudiced, unreasoning bigot, who will not
º facts for himself, nor allow due weight to the testimony of
others.
A Complete Disguise.
An Englishman and Roman were walking through the galleries of
the Vatican, where certain statues and pictures have been slightly
clothed so as not to shock the minds of purists as fastidious as the late
KING or NAPLes, when the Englishman made some allusion in the
course of conversation, to the “naked Truth.” “Excuse me, Sir.”
replied the Roman, half plaintively, “the Truth, is no longer allowed
§ ; º in Rome—good care is taken that it shall be draped by a
ardinal.”
“BLEss HER DEAR sides.”
The French have just launched another steel frigate, but our Admi-
ralty are so slow with theirs that BRITANNIA, in her leisure moments,
will have plenty of time to sing, “Still, so gently o'er me steeling.”

A NEW FASHION.
WE are continually being told that “Pride will have a fall,” but we
never could understand it. As Pride is never ashamed of showing her
features, but on the contrary is rather proud of displaying them, being
generally noted for the unabashed boldness of her countenance, we do
not see the necessity why she should have a Fall, when it is very clear
that she does not want one. Now, if it were Prudery, instead of Pride,
we could the better *::::::: the force of the meaning; for the
Fall would be of use to Prudery, to enable her to smirk and leer, and
make pretences of blushing behind it; and we can only say, that the
sooner Prudery does have a Fall, or in other words, takes the veil, the
more highly we shall be pleased, for we are sure that no one ever wants
to see her ugly face again.
Un-English Slang.
The phrase “project of law” is getting familiar to the public eye
by repeatedly occurring in REUTER's telegrams. Continental nations
may please to describe the measures introduced into their “Chambers”
as “projects of law,” but it is to be º that reporters of the pro-
ceedings of the British Legislature will continue to call a proposed
enactment by the good old parliamentary name of Bill. We are anxious
to keep all foreign rubbish such as “interpellations,” “complications,”
!. º of law,” from tumbling into our well of English
Ulnoleil IC01.

THE name of MR. TwelyeTREEs being mentioned in the presence

great is her reputation for saying happy things, she exclaimed, with
the most charmingly-feigned innocence, “What a very curious name!
I wonder if MR. TwelvetREEs came originally from Sevenoaks. The
latter may have been younger branches of the same family, you
know?”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
APRIL 22, Monday. British subjects who possess personal property
have no business abroad, because, if they have the means of §: in
Łngland, where, only, Punch can be procured on the day of publication
it is wantonly making light of their privileges to be out of the way of
that great advantage. However, there may be exceptional cases, and
as at present no British subject who makes a Will when he is abroad
has the slightest certainty that he has made it in the proper way, and
as the personalty is pretty sure to be expended in the personalities of
law, LoRD Kingsdown (MR. P. Leigh) is to be commended for
bringing in a Bill to provide that a will of personalty shall be valid,
whether made according to the law in foreign parts, or according to
the domicile of the testator." The excellent"Post office Savings' Bank
Bill went through Second Reading, but the intelligent British public,
into whose head it is excessively difficult to heat any new system (and
which still directs its letters to “James Thompson, Esq., 300, Cheap.
side, B.C,” because that name and address were given in the form
issued by SIR. Rowlan D) must understand that it is not to regard the
letter-slits in the light of the slit in the domestic money-box, nor to
suppose that if a penny is dropped into the letter-column at Hammer-
smith, it may be asked for at the receiving-house at Poplar that day
two years. r. Punch foresees a good deal of trouble to himself in
getting this new system into gear, but the object is so good that he
intends to take the public in hand.
LoRD RAYNHAM proposed to MR. GLADstone to lay a tax on
Linendrapers' Shopmen, in order to drive those elegant beings to more
manly work, and to substitute women behind the counters.
GLADSTONE said that it might not be unfair to do something for
women, especially as in some trades a systematic resistance is i. by
the men to the employment of feminine labour, but he did not quite
see his way to getting coin out of the counterjumper.
The Budget Debate began, and went through this night and that of
Thursday, when it was adjourned until the Monday following. MR.
Thomas Bºng made an elaborate speech against the Budget, and
thought that we ought to look forward to a deplorable financial future
and not remit taxes. MR. WHITE said—what can it matter what MR.
WHITE said f MR. BAxTER defended the scheme of MR. GLADstone,
and the battledore and shuttlecock business continued until midnight,
MR. BENTINCK's tirade against things in general being the most
WOL, XL. T
amusing feature of the ºf There was much grumbling, but the
Opposition did not offer to fight.
Tuesday. SIR. Joseph PAxton, with the instinct of a true lover of
the Landscape, demanded whether Government really contemplated
the letting the Agricultural Society bring, their fat pigs, ploughing
machines, and mangle wurzle (spell it right, Wiscount) into Hyde
Park in 1862? MR. CowPER made an evasive kind of answer, and
thought that “some” park might be used for the purpose. Mr. Punch
hereby invites SIR. Joseph to stick to this party CowPER, who is a
good man, but has no moral pluck, and would give up the QUEEN's
private flower-garden if Swelldom put the screw upon him. He may
stick the beasts in Battersea Park, if he likes, as there is nothing to
spoil, and nobody goes there, and it would be the making ºf the
locality. But we really cannot have the other place desecrated, though
: may not seem out of place in Hide Park, as it was originally
called.
MR. BERKELEy brought on his Ballot motion. He is a valiant Qld
man, but Punch is reminded of a fine passage in the Lord of the Isles.
The Ballot battle stagnates:—
* Dougi,As leans on his war-sword now,
And Williams wipes his moistened brow.
DuNgombs undoes his vizor clasp,
And ATHERTon for air must gasp,
And BERNAL Osborn Equits his spear,
Aud sinks thy falchion, BAss of BEER,
The blows of BERKELEY fall less fast,
And gallant Gibson's bugle blast
Has lost its lively tone,
Sinks, brave John BRIGHT, º battle-word,
And BRADy's shout is fainter heard,
* Mee merry men, foight on.'"
It will be evident to an acute reader that Mr. Punch introduced this
citation chiefly because BERKELEY and Douglas, being proposer and
seconder of the motion, two of SIR WALTER’s lines can glwen ln-
tact, and Mr. P. distinctly states that he has not the slightest reason
for affirming that the SQLicitor-GENERAL was out of breath, or that
the Wiscount had a tendency to perspiration. To return to our sheeps
—when the said mover and seconder had affirmed that the Ballot
would bring in the Millennium, the House “answered not but with its
legs,” as Morose, in The Silent. Woman, desires Cutheard to do. It

180 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[May 4, 1861.
Wednesday. The old Universities return Members to Parliament,
and the constituency is a curious one. The yoters are the Masters of
Arts, and they are of course, scattered all over, the country, and
indeed over the world. It is proposed that, instead of giving an M.A.
not in residence, the trouble and expense of coming to his University
toyote, the scholarly character of his franchise shall be still, further
indicated by its being permitted to him to write his vote, and send it
to head-quarters. There is much to be said in favour of this plan, but
what is to be said against it is, that inasmuch as nearly all the Clergy
are Masters of Arts, you will be giving the Clerical element a huge
preponderance. All the stupid bigoted Welsh Qurates and their
congeners, the worthy and disagreeable, men who, live in small
villages, and get a habit of regarding everything in a village way,+the
excellent pig-heads who quarrel with the Dissenters on little points
that a priest of the world would smile at, all this mass of conscientious
small-mindedness will be brought to bear upon the elections. Distance,
time, trouble, expense keep a majority of these parsons from voting
now, but when they can vote for a penny, they will pour in their papers,
and we shall see such a man as the Record would support (can we
say anything more contemptuous?) aided to overthrow a Gladstone,
8. $1. a Carlyle, or a Thackeray, or some other candidate who
would be an ornament, to the House of Commons and a stone of
stumbling to bigotry. On the whole, therefore, and in the interests
of the Universities, Mr. Punch thought it better to refer the Bill to a
Select Committee, which of course was done at his suggestion.
SIR Monton Peto.—but Lord PUNCH said a precious good thing
to him, and that must be told here. You know the great fishmonger's
at the top of Parliament Street—don't the salmon look scrumptious f
Well, on Wednesday, the MARCHIoness or PUNch had (respectfully)
requested her, Lord to send home some fish, and he, immersed in
thought for the ſº of the nation, passed the shop without thinking
of the request. But, remembering it, he hurried affably back, and SIR
M. PETO was standing, admiring some red mullet... “Did you want to
speak to me?” said SIR M.P. to LoRD P. ...“No,” said LoRD P.,
quoting the classical speech of the ancient Gladiator—
“Nonte, Peto,-piscem peto."
Upon which, SIR. M., delighted, was moving off, but LoRD Pt.com;
tinuing the speech of the Retiarius, added, “Quid me fugis, Galleſ’’
(Galle, on the present occasion, Wiscount, means Old Cock). And,
after ordering a few salmons, they went down to the House together,
laughing like fun, and in capital spirits, to discuss the Bill for burying
Dissenters: -
This Bill is squashed, so there is no use in talking about it; but its
intention was to permit Dissenters to bury in Church of England
churchyards, with whatever forms, or absence of forms, they might
}. The Jumpers might have come and jumped over a deceased
riend, and the Shakers might have taken and shaken him, and people who
have even briefer rituals, for instance, folks like the woman MADEN,
who has ... been making a fool of herself in a court of justice, might
have stood upon the tomb, and proclaimed the doctrine that “we dies
like, dogs.” . These processes would have been very distasteful to
right-minded people, and the House of Commons, by 236 to 155,
i.” 81, voted for preserving the sanctity of our last earthly
Orne.
Thurtday. A queer petition was presented from some Worcestershire
attorney, who complained that at the Assizes for that county he had
been severely and unjustly walked into by MR. HUDDLEston, Q.C.,
and he wants the law, altered so that MR., HUDDLEston may not be
able to walk into him in future. As that eminently courteous #:
is, about the last man likely to say anything harsh or inconsiderate,
Mr. Punch will not give his Royal Assent to the proposed alteration of
the law until he has further evidence before him.
The Budget Debate was resumed, as aforesaid, and MR. SEYMoUR
FITzGERALI, and MR. MILNER GIBson did battle. A great lot of
nobodies talked in a grocerly way about tea and sugar—the épicier
class º means so absent from our Chamber as the French think.
Later, SAM SLICK made a vehement speech against MR. GLAD.
STONE, whom he curiously charged with ridiculing the people, of
Canada; and MR. BERNAL Osborns (saying that he had received a les.
son not to be Light or Violent) made some fun of MR. SLICK, MAJOR
Hºwards, who may have dined out, for he called the SPEAKER
"Gentlemen,” termed the cheap newspapers “the penny-alinin
interest,” for which this Major (he is only a Yeomanry Major, mind,
and partner in some mercantile firm, which facts extenuate his intensely
aristocratic º was well castigated by John MAGUIRE of Cork,
more power to his elbow.
DR. BRADY tried to get a Select Committee appointed to consider
the , Street Railway question, but this respected Apothecary is not
çelebrated for his successful treatment of popular complaints, and the
House, would not follow his prescription, thinking perhaps that he
understands Opiates better than Sleepers,
Friday. The conversazione was short, but a good many topics came
up. LoRD PALMERston made some exceeding biting remarks upon
the, Prussian administration, apropos of the MacDonald case, and
declared that the Prussian Government had behaved in a way that
was most, unfriendly, and unworthy of a country in alliance with
(he should have said under the patronage of) England. Won't the
beery beggars, be riled, and shan’t we have infuriated scoffs at the
PREMIERP The #..."; flogging boys in prisons, came up, and
Members took different sides, some thinking the punishment cruel,
and others defending it because they themselves were flogged at Eton.
At the latter seat of instruction it is etiquette not to bellow under the
rod, but to look as if you rather liked it, or, at all events, are obli
to the Doctor for his trouble; but this refinement is not comprehended
by plebeian offenders, who, it seems, howl with all their might. The
Constable could not say whether the Pope was going to appoint a
successor or not. , Mr. Punch regrets to add º: the indictable
nuisance, the East Wind, has actually violated propriety so far as
to afflict the SPEAKER, with neuralgia, and incapacitate him for
the Chair, though whether an attack of that prettily named com-
plaint be not preferable to a Budget Debate, MR. DENIsoN has now
an opportunity of deciding. Happy will Mr. Punch be to say with
OvID, Burus ad Auroram recessit—meantime he makes everybody else a
roarer.

bands scarce, if any one
of them can condescend
to accept such a bar-
gain as the author of
this proposal:—

DR. Johnson described a man who had contracted a mercenary
marriage as a contemptible fellow who had at length obtained the
certainty of three meals a day. “Confidence 97” is willing to dispose
of himself for a much meaner consideration. He is to be sold for
temporary accommodation to the amount of £300. As he does not
object to a widow, perhaps he would not strongly insist upon parity of
years. He would probably not refuse to negotiate with any old crone
who has got the sum that he requires hoarded in her stocking. No
doubt he is ready to come to terms with any witch who can help him
to raise the wind. Only he requires that the beldame should be of a
religious turn of mind; whereby, of course, he means that she must
possess the one thing needful.
A PREJUDICED PROTESTANT.
A CostERMONGER, in a public house, reading aloud to a Dustman
the Roman correspondence in the Times, came to the following
passage:–
“The Archimandrite, who is a venerable old man, then knelt before the Holy
Father, and kissed his feet.”
“Yah!” cried the dustman. “The What d'ye call him?”
“The Hartchymandrite,” replied the costermonger.
“Humph!” his comrade grunted. “And ’oo's the 'oly Father?”
“The Pope, stupid.” - -
“The Pope. Oh!” said the meditative dustman, “Kissed
the Pope's feet. Wot a unpleasant haction! A Hartchymandrite—
kissed the Pope's feet. Jest like one. Yer wouldn't expect no better
of a Hartchymandrite, would yer? A kissin hof the 'oly Father's feet:

THE USE OF FRANCE AT ROME.
THE French occupation of Rome is generally objected to on the
ground that Catholicism, which it professedly supports, is quite able
to stand alone. . In justice to our pious allies, it must be admitted that
there is reason for doubting the P: ability of the Faith, to take
care of itself., Mother Church, if left to her own devices, might lose
some part of the credit which she derives from the filial protection of
her Eldest Son. - -
The Paris correspondent of the Post informs us that an Italian gen;
tleman invited him, a few days since, to meet the devil, whom that
gentleman had lately brought from Italy. He accepted the invitation;
and, he says:—
“On entering the room my attention was directed to a handsome carved and gilt
Confessional, on the upper panel of which was painted a head of our Saviour; the
lower panel showed a painting of the cross. This piece of church furniture stands
about six feet high, and appears to belong to the 16th century. It was lately dis-
covered at a monastic establishment near Florence, one which the revolutionary
events of the last few months had caused to be invaded by the civil authorities.
The remarkable feature of the Confessional consists in its internal mechanical con-
trivances. The priest who may be interrogating a sinner, and pointing to the panel
representing the Saviour, has only to touch a spring when the screen suddenly falls,
and a figure representing the devil, the size of a man, falls forward.”
The devil of the Confessional appears pretty much in the same form
as that, wherein he comes for Mr. Punch, in our popular exhibition.
This is his portrait:-
“A horned brown head, with large round protruding eyes, rolling fearfully; the
tongue hanging out of the mouth, and made to move, a few tufts of negro-like hair,
in fact, a monster. The hands are like the long-nailed claws of a quadruped.”
In the original text of our celebrated tragi-comedy, a stage direction
describes us as being alarmed, on the apparition of the fiend, by
“hearing a strange supernatural noise, like the rapid motion of fifty
spinning-wheels.” So, in the case of the Confessional puppet:—
“When the figure appears, a sort of infernal rattling noise comes from the
internal machinery.”
It is only fair to admit that a priesthood which plays this kind of
tricks, urgently, requires that attestation of its sanctity, and, wisdom
which can only be afforded by the defensive bayonets and bullets of a
great and generous nation.
But this Romish, devil is a sham of the sixteenth century. Perhaps
an unchangeable Church has ceased to play the devil. If so, neverthe-
less it still plays the saint in such a manner as to need all the counte-
nance which it can derive from the tutelary veneration of intelligent
France. Witness the subjoined extracts from the official journal of
me:-
“Among the images of the most blessed Virgin, the Mother of God, which are
chiefly distinguished in Rome for antiquity, and the reverential worship that is
paid to them, the most celebrated is that which is venerated near the Jesuit's
College, in the oratory where the congregation assemble, which, being the mother
and chief of all others, throughout the whole world, which are dedicated to MARY,
assumes the title of “Prima Primaria.’”
Then follows a description of, “this revered “Icone.’”. The sacro-
sanct doll was originally painted in one of the ambulatories of SAINT
ERMETE; was sawn out of the wall, under CLEMENT WIII., and
removed to a museum, whence, in 1761, it was translated to its present
position over the altar of the Jesuits’ oratory, where it stands to be
worshipped. Yes; to be actually and absolutely worshipped, not
merely venerated as a memorial, but specially adored as an image dis-
tinct from other images. So official authority itself declares in the
following courageous assertion:-
graces and prodigies, insomuch that it was solemnly crowned by HENRY, Duke of
York, Cardinal and Arch-priest of the Watican Basilica.”
The CARDINAL DUKE of York was not the first of his family wh988
faith cost him his crown. Such a faith might be in danger ºf being
deemed no better than Joss-worship, if it were not upheld, with force
and arms, at the expense of Italian fiberty, by the enlightened French
people and their clever EMPEROR.

Asked lately a young lady, “Pray, dear Mr. Pºnch, as people say
that you know everything, can you tell me why the modern waltz is

Replied the gentleman, “Well, really, I scarce know if I can say;
unless it is that, as a rule, the music plays in one time and the men

SOMETHING SHORT FOR SNAKE-BITES.
. OUR ideas of the medicinal uses of alcoholic spirit are enlarged by the informa-
tion, conveyed by M. JULes Cloquet to the Academy of Sciences, that it is a
cure for snake-bites. M. Cloquet received this intelligence from M. DE LA
GIRONNIERE in a letter dated from the Philippine Islands. One of M. DE LA
GIRQNNIERE's workmen had been bitten in the ſinger by a very venomous serpent,
His hand and arm swelled up to the shoulder; and he appeared to be at the point
of death., M. DE LA GIRoNNièRE made him drink, a whole bottle of vin de coco
described as a “very strong spirit.” He almost immediately became drunk and
incapable; tumbled down, and talked maudlin. The pain, however, ceased, and
the swelling did not proceed. In half an hour he began to get sober, but his
suffering returned with his senses;. so M. DE LA GIRoNNIAERE extinguished both
by the exhibition of another bottle of the medicine as before. A third full dose
completed the cure. , He made his patient, in fact, dead drunk three times over,
and so, º, É. him repeatedly to the death of drunkenness, prevented his
decease; killing him, in a manner, to save his life. Gentlemen of the United King-
dom Alliance, there was no mistake about the matter. “I had heard,” says
M. DE LA GIRONNIERE, "that alcohol, pushed to the extent of inducing complete
drunkenness, was a specific against the bite of serpents, and now I have a
convincing proof of it.”
If, as the teetotallers maintain, alcohol is a poison, the above-quoted case is a
confirmation of the homoeopathic axiom, “Like cures like.” Spirit is an antidote
to serpent's venom, such as, in hydrophobia, is said to be afforded to the morbifio
matter by a hair of the dog that bit you. The like, however, cures the like in
quantities which are far from infinitesimal. Such appears to be the case when
spirits are taken for the relief of despondency, or any other medicinal purpose.
he proportions in which grog must be, mixed to be administered as a remedy
for the bites of serpents are not at all those which DR. HAHNEMANN pre-
scribes for globules and tinctures, but rather such as were wont to be taken for
the removal of thirst % MyNHEER voN DUNK. Indeed, Won DUNK, if he had
had the misfortune to be bitten by a viper, would have been obliged considerably
to augment the strength of his customary potion; would have had to heighten it
much above proof. Mere Cognac would never have, sufficed him as it did that
countryman of his who, being recommended a bottle of brandy for a bad leg,
drank the brandy and rubbed, his leg, with the bottle.
Won DUNK .# have required to f* tipsy, which brandy;
and-water did not make him; which most likely he could
never have been made by brandy of any dilution, or by
anything of the kind short of absolute alcohol.
ł. ordinary cases of snake-bite a cure, perhaps, will be
obtainable by drinking the milder forms ºf spirituous liquors
insufficient quantities. The patient will only have to take
unlimited goes. There is a certain alcoholic compound
which is deservedly celebrated for curing the gout, the
colic, and the phthisic. Who can say that it not
also 'cure the consequences of the envenomed wo
inflicted by the cobra, the rattlesnake, and the marsh-
mocassin? Let the sufferer try. Punch. There is, some.
thing in Punch which is pºlis, antagonistic to the
ºf... of poisonous reptiles.
THE WOLUNTEER TO HISTOOTH-BRUSH
I LAY no stress upon my dress,
No dandy arts are mine: .
A sponge and tub for morning scrub,
A wash-hands ere I dine: ..
Two hair-brushes together plied
(I could make shift with one,
A rude skin-parting roughly made-
And so my toilette's done.
And yet, all sº as I am,
A pang my hand doth stay, .
When stern MACMURDO order gives,
“Your tooth-brush fling away!”
I little thought, when in the ranks
A rifle first I bore, -
That when gunpowder's day set in,
Tooth-powder's day was o'er.
Defiance in the foeman's teeth
I am prepared to fling;
But leaving my own teeth uncleaned
Is quite another thing-
By turning Rifle Volunteer
John BULL his teeth doth show,
And I should like my ivories
To be a polished row.
What if the British Lion draws
His weapons from their sheath,
Out of their velvet shows his claws
Out of their lips his teeth-
Will there be less of terror hid
In that grim mouth or paws, , .
When nail-brush to his feet’s forbid,
And tooth-brush to his jaws?
We’re º: when we’re called on,
To take the field—I know:
And though mere babes in arms, we'll try
A brush with any foe.
But betwixt us and the foemen,
As fierce the brush will be,
If we are first allowed a brush
Betwixt our teeth to see.
That cleanliness to godliness
Is next allied we’re told:
And though I’m no DIOGENES
Still to my tub Lhold. ...
But tubs and Turkish towelling
Upon campaign, Iknow,
Are luxuries which Volunteers
Must cheerfully forego.
With unblack'd boot I’m game to shoot,
To fight with unbrushed hair,
But thou, my tooth-brush-I had hoped
That thee at least they’d spare.
In pack or pocket, fob or pouch,
*or thee there’s surely room,
Whatever Spartan NAPIER preach,
Or stern MACMURDO doom!

OUR PRIZE CENSUS PAPER.
(4 Letter just received from our Laziest Contributor, and which only a regard for his young
wife and family induces us to print.)

J - to give a prize of a
Hundred-guinea Tea
* *-
of a family who has
best filled up his Cen-
sus Paper, and feelin
perfectly persuade
that the Tea Service
is nine, Ibeg to make
known to the world
how I acted in the
matter, that my ex-
ample ten years Heº
may lead to like suc-
cess.
“The first thing
after breakfast on
Monday the 8th ul-
and family, together
in my smoking-room,
which, as I often take
a map in it, I some-
times call my study. Seated in my largest chair, and assuming a majestic Head-of-House:
hinting deportment, I placed the family Bible imposingly, before me, opened at the flyleaf
which contains the dates of birth. . After an amusing little skirmish with, my wife, who
declared that, as I had but little brains to boast of, and very seldom meddled with family
concerns, I ought by rights to call her the real Head of the Family, I chronicled my name,
condition, sex and age last birthday, only deviating (by accident), one twelvemonth from
the truth. , 'Private Gent and Public Writer’—conscientiously described my, "rank or
occupation, though my wife thought it might expose her to being charged with bigamy, as
it appeared to her to indicate a duality of persons....Having however calmed her fears upon
this head, there next came the puzzling query, ‘Where had I, been born?". Haying neg-
lected to apply for my certificate of baptism, I wrote that Meddington in Slopshire in my
belief was honoured by having been my birthplace; but I added, that although I had
been present at the ceremony, I could not speak with personal remembrance of the fact. In
the column that inquired if I were deaf and dumb or blind, I conscientiously replied that I
had sometimes been all three; but, I added, this had been at the instance of my wife, who
continually required me to be blind to her defects, and deaf and dumb when she tormented
me with galling curtain-lectures or importunate requests.
&n Hºf nobly thus unbosomed myself about myself, I next filled in my wife's return as
nearly to the truth (in point at least of her antiquity) as could in reason be expected. This
being the first time I had ever had the courage to ask her what her age was, it was not
much to be wondered that it threw her in a flutter, and, had there been º; to gain
by it, she would no doubt have tried to faint. But I had previously explained that hysterics
were prohibited by the Census Act of Parliament; and, as I was merely acting as the proxy
for the Government, she must lyok to them, not me, to give her a new bonnet for telling
them the truth. Her occupation I described as that of “Wife of my Buseum, and Keeper of
my Privy Purse;’ for whenever I come home with any money in my pocket, she is sure on
some pretence or other to take charge of it. The half-a-dozen olive-branches wherewith (at
present) we are blest I put down all as ‘seholars, as I found the instructions bade me;
though what our eldest joy is learning excepting to play pranks, and to dislocate his raiment,
it would puzzle one to say; and as our youngest hope has only reached the age of one, it
almost seemed a joke to describe her as a “scholar,” excepting in so far as she is being
schooled to walk. -
“Coming next to my Mamma-in-law, I felt perplexed to know in what position I should
place her: whether I should claim her as a resident relation, or put her down as a chance
visitor staying in my house. She wrote me word when she first entered it, exactly nine years
since, that she thought she might be able to stay a week or ten days with us, and of course
I need not say, she has remained here ever since. Feeling there was reasonable doubt
about the matter, and not wishing to incur the £5 penalty imposable for giving in a false
return, I deemed it best to leave the ‘relation’ column º, and to explain in a footnote
the real reason why I did so. Putting, ‘Widow’. for her ‘condition’ and a great “I” for her
“sex,” I next was under the necessity of asking her her age; upon which after some
screaming and calling me a brute, she confessed to being two-and-forty her next º
but would not let me call her a fraction of a year more. I pointed out that this return wou d
show she’d been a mother at the early age of twelve, for her daughter had acknowledged
that she was nine-and-twenty, which I really do believe to be within five years of her
veritable * However, she at once turned a deaf ear to my logic, and declaring that
she knew I only wanted to insult her she swung out of the room with a most emphatic
bang. So all that'ſ could do was to fill in “Age Unknown,” and make a marginal affidavit
that I had done my utmost in attempting to discover it.
“The servants being summoned, É. couldn't spell her surname but confessed she was
a "widder,’ and said she had been married ‘somewheres in the Shears;” so if the Government
choose to institute the proper sort of search, they might, find out if “John Brown, to
whom she was united "more nor thutty year agoo,' spelt his surname with, or without, a
final ‘e.” Forty-one, she said, her age was, “for why should I deceive you, Mum?’ (looking
Service to the father b
timo, I called my wife |k
at my wife) and this again is a clear proof that
strangely early marriages are sometimes made
in England, for Cook could have been scarcely
more than nine years old when she became a
wife, ‘more, nor thutty year agoo.” The house-
maid and the Nurse ditto each confessed their
ages with more or less reluctance, and rather
more than less, I fear, of actual truth. But
when I asked, if they were married, I could at
first eligit nothing but a giggle, which I could
not well record as an intelligible reply. On
eing further pressed, the Housemaid said that
she was, ‘married to No man,’ but she only
smoothed her apron and put on a smirking look,
when I asked if MR. NoMAN spelt his surname
with a K. Our “Buttons,” whom my wife wished
me to enter, as her “Page,’ showed no such
mock modesty in answering my questions, for
when I asked his age, he said “I’m comink on
hateen, and hiſ you don’t believe me 'ere's my
stificate of buth,' producing as he spoke a legal.
looking document, which I fervently believe that
he had forged for the occasion. Upon my askin
further whether he were married, he first winke
at the Cook, and then said, ‘No, Iain’t eggsackly
married yit, but I’m hingaged, and I don't mind
tellin'yer the lady's name, hiſ Guvmink wants to
now 'er!”
“This ending my inquiries, I signed my name
to certify that I had made a true return, so far
as it was in my power so to do. . Dismissing the
assembly, I then took my morning weed, feeling
conscious I had “done the State some service.”
and only * º knew it; and feeling also
somewhat of the “Old Roman’ about me, as
seemed intended by the Government in calling
me a “CENSOR.”
WOICES OF OUR NIGHTS.
SUBMITTED TO THE AMERICAN POET, By
MR, WRONGFELLOW.
I HEARD the feline footsteps in the night
Pad through the court and hall!
I saw the sable wretch in the moon’s light
Climb MRs. Coxe's wall!
I felt her (that I did!—I’m sure I’m right!)
Step o'er me just above; -
With shrill pathetic mewings through the night,
As of a cat in love.
I heard the sounds of passion and of fight,
The caterwauling chimes, -
That fill each attic chamber in the night,
Where some starved poet rhymes.
My night-capped head in the cool midnight air
Sought vainly some repose;
The echo of perpetual squalls rose there,
From the new cistern rose.
Peace! peace! Orestes-like I breathe this
prayer'
Descend, you green-eyed fright!
I hate, while thus you screech, and spit, and
swear,
The cat-infested night!

more Irish than the conduct of our own QUEEN

every kind of abuse, and “answered” that abuse
by sending a pardon to a silly old Irishman who,
it was idly thought, would live at home grate-

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“BEFoRE this letter sees the light the gallant Miles-na-Cop-
paleen will have begun again to take his “tremendous header’ nightl
in the lake, at the Adelphi, which (the house, and not the *...}}
suppose will be crammed nightly to see the daring plunge. However
high-flown critics may have carped at the Colleen, and sneered at
its defects in writing and consiruction, which I see no good in
attempting to defend, there is clearly no denying it has been a great
success, and the cause of its so being it is worth while to inquire
into, and if possible find out. Of course the ‘header’ aforesaid has
been to some eyes an attraction, and the business of the Cave scene is
so cleverly, contrived that I am not disposed to wonder at the plaudits
it calls forth. Still I can't believe the Strand wou'd have ever been
blocked up with Colleen cabs as it has been, or that by wish of the
Police the doors need have been opened sooner than their wont, merely
on account of this one aquatic feat. I am more inclined to think that
play-goers have been pleased by the care, and, the completeness, where-
with the piece is played, and the attention that is given to whatever
can enhance the illusion of each scene, or add a whit in heightening
the general effect.
“In attending thus to details in a piece for which two, “Stars’ have
been especially engaged, MR. WEBSTER does what few of his profession
care to do, and I trust that his example may lead others to success.
Though MR. Boucicault's engagement must clearly be regarded as
a part of the ‘Star system, MR.WEBSTER’s careful labour in mount.
ing the Colleen, entitles him to º: for making some departure from
it. Mostly, managers are found to spend so much upon the “Stars’
that they feel afraid to swell their risk by further outlay, and so pay
little heed to the acting of subordinates, or the upgetting of the piece.
Shall I more incur the wrath or the thanks of the profession, if I state
as my opinion that the Star system has done great evil to our stage,
by making managers unmindful of the general effect, and regardless of
the way in which the minor parts are filled * Hence authors have of
course grown careless in their writing, and have bestowed their thought
and wit alone on the chief characters, knowing well that what .
put into the mouths of the subordinates will be wretchedly delivered,
and therefore labour lost. Upon the actors too the system has a low-
ering effect, for while the rule is not to care about the lesser characters,
the men who have to bear them get disgusted with their work. , More-
over, while this is the rule, the exception of a man who really tries to
do his best, and make the most of a small part, stands out in such
strong contrast to the acting of his fellows that the part appears
unnatural and loses its effect.
“I may say another word upon the Star system ere, long, but at
present my space warns me I must shunt this, train of thought. , For
of course you want to know what I think of the new comedy: which,
as it is written by MR. STERLING Coyne, small punsters will no doubt
declare is sterling stuff. Well, if Black Sheep be not equal to the
Honeymoon and Hunchback, and other of the comedies that modern
writers have produced, it at least is something better than a three-act
farce, and has, the merit of possessing an intelligible plot. Though
devoid of thrilling interest or exciting situations, the story is both
pleasantly and evenly sustained; and the language never, sinks into
tameness or vulgarity, though it never rises much above the common
level of ordinary talk. The action may not be fast-paced, but at least
it never drags; and, save perhaps in the last act, there is small need
for the critic to prescribe an operation with that vastly well-worn in-
strument, the judiciously-used pruning knife. The three acts only
occupy two hours and a quarter, and so the play is greatly free.from
the great fault of spinning out....As I have hinted, too, the writing is
agreeable throughout; and, unlike some modern comedies, has enough

of pleasant humour, without its making people so unnaturally witty as
to drop a Fº or epigram every time they speak. There may be nothing
very noveſ in the characters presented, but they have at least great
naturalness, and that to me is a great charm. This is somewhat marred,
however, by the stale old stagy way in which they are all hurried on
together to the footlights, to make a situation at the climax of each
act. The drunken scene, moreover, I consider an excrescence, and
could wish it were cut out. Is it likely the smart widow would say
‘yes’ to the sleek humbug, so quickly after being so disgusted by his
drunkenness? and however Mr. Bunny could have sobered himself
down in a quarter of an hour, it quite passes my experience of soda
water to conceive. Add to this, that lawyers' clerks at fifteen shillings
a week don't chat pertly with their masters about confidential clients,
and if caught polking in the office do make some sort of excuse. But
such slight slips as these are rarely shunned upon the stage, although
they sadly mar the naturalness there may be in a piece. ..
“MRs. Young deserves my praise for her quiet even acting, and for
saying what she has to say, of pathos, or of banter, without straining
for effect. This lady, I believe, had her stage schooling in Australia
and one is pleased to find that people who are born there talk ;
English, and don't burlesque our language as our friends the Yankees
do. You can fancy MR. Buckstone in a smooth wig and white choker,
and a suit of solemn black, plaguing º: for subscriptions to the
Clothing Fund established for the Naked Ashantees, and lining his
own pockets with the cheques that he collects. His rascality excepted,
Mr. Bunny is the male form of the wheedling Mrs. Clutchley, so admi-
rably personated by MRs. GERMAN REED. Charity-lunters are fair
game, and a shaft or two of sarcasm will do the real cause of charity
no harm, though I doubt if Exeter Hall this month will vote its thanks
to MR. Coyne for the check he may have given it. He will however
have the thanks of those exhausted swells who vote—aw-ballwoom
work a baw, and are disinclined to dance lest they should disarwange
their whiskaws, for suggesting the idea of a Gentlemanly Partners
urveying Association, whereby attendance of good dancers may be
nightly guaranteed; the order tº. given for a dozen or two -
temps men, just as one would order a few dozens of champagne or a
pail or two of ice. To see how MR. CoMPTON acts upon this notion,
and is a lawyer's drudge by daylight, and a gay and sportive butterfly
of fashion under gas, is a sight that may remind one of one's, première
jeunesse, and which I may advise all those who like the wholesome
exercise of laughing not to miss.
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
FASHION AND ITS FOLLIES,
We much rejoice to learn that the EMPREss of THE FRENCH has
quite recovered her lost health. This, although it has not been
officially announced, we gather from the following most interesting
}. which we cut for lady readers from a country print.
escribing how Her Majesty appeared at a late ball, given, it was
stated, for a charitable purpose, the writer wins our admiration and
delight by stating this:-
“The dress worn by Her Majesty was much admired for its elegance and sim-
plicity, being of white crape, festooned into full bouffans by simple ruches of white
tafſetas cut en persil. These festoons, by crossing each other, supported the dress
in the most artistic manner, avoiding the thick and heavy effect which boufans in
general produce round the figure. At each crossing a bouquet of marguerites,
mixed with diamonds, was placed so that the skirt seemed, as it were, dependeut
on that support.
“It is no wonder that, in spite of the immense display of diamonds, and the
utter absence of all calculation in the expense of the dress worn on this occasion, the
one chosen by Her Majesty should have been pronounced the most elegant and most
characteristic of the exquisite taste exhibited by Parisian artists, amongst them
all. We have been informed that the mere adjusting of the dress on the night of
the ball occupied the space of three quarters of an hour, as the º of the
bouquets and diamonds on the skirt cannot be accomplished until the dress is on
and the whole toilet be complete, excepting the last touch, upon which, however,
according to the tiring-woman's idea,” “everything depends." For the more con-
venient accomplishment of this most important portion of the evening's task, a
high stool is prepared in Her Majesty's dressing-room upon which Her Majesty
stands while the bouquets are being placed upon the skirt, so that they are on a
level with the eye of the habilleuse, who—under the direction of the head tiring-
woman, who stands at a distance viewing the reflection of the labour in a swing
glass—gives her orders where each bouquet shall be placed.”
We can fancy what a chorus of “How lovely's" and “Oh my's l’”
will arise from lady-readers of these interesting facts; and we are
quite as much inclined to cry, “By Jovel ” ourselves, or indulge in
any other exclamation of astonishment, not indeed so much at the
beauties of the ball-dress, as at the patience of the sufferer who had
to bear the toil of the toilet here described. If such attire be there
admired as being “elegant and simple,” one wonders what costume
would be in Paris thought elaborate, and how many hours or days
would be required to put it on. We have heard that our great grand-
mother, when dressing for a ball, was forced sometimes to sit up all
the night before, for fear that she might disarrange the curling of her
wig; and to stand on a high stool for some | ". of an hour,
while one's skirts are being loaded with jewels and bouquets, appears
to us a not less needless operation, and one that few would have the
º: or the fortitude to bear. A lady's maid, we think, is very
tly called a tiring, woman, when she exhausts her mistress's temper
by such a task as this; and whatever her physicians may continue to
lege, while the EMPREss has capacity to undergo such labour, we
cannot but believe she is robust in health.

honourable Hodgson had been guilty of bribery, but as a necessary
witness, one M'GALL, had absconded, he, SIR. Richard, should show
the milk of human kindness instead of

Tuesday. The Lords did nothing, and what the Commons did was
briefly explained by the Noble Wiscount, “ § dear Mr. Punch, we
couldn't make no house no hows. Yours, W. W.”
Wednesday. The Bill for the Recovery of Debts was rejected b
121 to 23, the House thinking that debts recovered quite fast enoug
without fresh medical aid.
MR. Locke KING moved the Second Reading of his Religious
Worship Bill, so entitled, Mr. Punch supposes, to distinguish the
Worship from Hero-worship, Mammon-worship, and other idolatries.
The object of the Bill was (you will observe the preterite, Wiscount,
and a preterite means a past tense, and a tense means an inflexion of
a verb, and a verb means a part of speech that expresses action, motion,
being, suffering, or a request or command to do or forbear anything;
don't ask so many questions) to enable any bishop to give any parson
leave to go into the pulpit of any other parson in the said bishop's
diocese, whether the resident parson liked the visitor or did not. The
House did not think that clerical brotherly-affection would be pro-
moted by this arrangement, and on division, another of the batch of
volunteer reforms which MR. KING and his friends have been inflicting
on Parliament with such signal ill-success, was pitched out by 191 to
145. LORD JoHN MANNERs specially protested against placing the
clergy “under the thumb” of the bishops.
Thursday. LoRD NorMANBy emitted one of his long and absurd
tirades against the kingdom, of Italy, and was answered by LoRD
Wodehouse in a speech in which the contempt he felt for such spite-
ful twaddle was a little more evident than such a sentiment is usually
permitted to be in House of Lords speeches; but, to be sure, Nor-
MANBY has become a nuisance that must be abated.
Before the Tea-Fight in the Commons, MR. CowPER explained that
certain necessary repairs at Windsor Castle are being done with all
respect for the ancient character of that edifice. MR. STIRLING com-
lained that £50 a year had been given by Lord PALMERSTON to a
estmoreland poet called Close, who describes himself as Laureate
to the KING OF BoxNY, Western Africa. Lord PALMERston defended
the gift, said that Close might be placed in the same category with
BURNs, and made some fun about the black king's Laureate not get-
ting a butt of Sack. MR. STIRLING is still dissatisfied, and we are
to hear again about this poet. MR. Hodgkinson tried to get an
alteration of the Budget in favour of House Agents; but MR. GLAD-
stone very properly refused any concession to a set of men who are
really the great obstacles to the rapid and beneficial letting of houses.
Hundreds of dwellings would be promptly and pleasantly let, but for
the intermeddling of these stupid and griping folks, whose first busi.
ness is to take care not to know anything about the houses they are
ordered to let, and their second is to take care that principals shall not
meet. Stick any tax you like on them, WILLIAM; and if it tends to
their extirpation, tant mieur.
Then came the battle on the Budget. As hath been said and sung,
MR. DisrAELI proposed that, instead of taking off the Paper-Duty,
the Duty on Tea should be reduced. And the whippers whipped with
their whips, and the Members were gathered together in tremendous
force. . A certain quantity of talk is a necessary formality before a
trial of strength, but Mr. Punch will boil down the debate into the
smallest compass. MR. GLADstone defended his own proposition;
MR. HoRSFALL moved the amendment, which was to keep on the Paper.
Duty, and reduce that on Tea from One and Fivepence to One Shilling.
The MARQUIs OF HARTINGTON had heard nothing—
MR. Pope HENNEssy would confine himself—
LORD HolmesDALE was greatly surprised–
MR. NoFRIs knew two respectable grocers—
SIR. S. Northcote would not attempt to answer—
SIR. G. C. Lewis trusted the House—
MR. DisrAELI had been very much amused—
LoRD PALMERston objected to personalities—
These formularies having been gone through, the Tellers proceeded
to the real business of the night, which was to ascertain whether the
Conservative Whip would enable Mr. Disraeli to place the Govern.
ment in a minority. Never mind deduction from argument, but deduct
281 from 299, and you have got the answer. The Government expected
a majority of about 30, but got only 18, which MR. DISRAELI said, was
no “majority” at all, because “it was in its teens.” Tea Duce, how-
ever, the Conservatives do not storm the Treasury Bench, and the
seventeen pennies are again levied.
Friday. In both Houses the interesting announcement was made
that Our Daughter ALICE has engaged herself, with the consent of her
parents, to PRINCE Louis of Hesse, Mr. Punch despairs of saying
anything so truly sweet upon the subject as is said in the report of the
Morning Chronicle, touching the delivery of the message to the Lords:
“During the reading of the above me the House became almost quite dark.
from a sudden change in the atmosphere, but, as it was concluded, the chandellers
flared up with a startling brilliancy—a circumstance which may be taken as a
happy omen of the approaching nuptials, initiated during a period of royal mourn-
ing, but destined .. bright and joyous in its sequel.”
In the Commons, LoRD PALMERSTON, in speaking upon the subject,
said that he knew Our Daughter ALICE, that she was an exceedingly
charming young lady, and the young gentleman who had been happy
enough to gain her affections, was in every way worthy of her, LoRD
PALMeRSTON added that the House “could not but view with great
satisfaction an announcement. intended to direct HER MAJESTY's
thoughts to the anticipation of joys and of happiness in the future, and
. may gently withdraw her mind, from dwelling with too great
intensity upon the melancholy recollections of the past.” That it may
do so, every subject of our Sovereign will cordially, pray. For, Mr.
Punch himself, he will merely remark, that he hopes the House will do
what is handsome by the young couple, and that-
“When Louis and ALICE are wed at the Palace,
He ‘ll empt, in their honour, a very large chalice."
LoRD, DERby has compelled the Ministers to consent to the sendin
the Bankruptcy Bill to a Select Committee. His Lordship explaine
at a Mansion House dinner, early in the week, that the Conservatives
could easily turn out the Government, but preferred to keep it in and
keep it from mischief, because it was not for the credit of England
that her Ministry should be always changing, and though the Budget
division did not exactly confirm the Erl-King's allegation, the con-
senting to this manipulation of the only important Bill of the year does
not show much Ministerial valour. Lord DERby said that there
were many technical errors in the Bill, but it may be suspected that the
Committee will not stop at the correction of technicalities. The mea-
sure is not safe yet.
In answer to an idiotic question by LoRD HARRINGTON, LORD
GRANVILLE said he didn't know, and meant that he didn't care, whe-
ther the new tram-roads would interfere with the present conveyances.
The question Punch supposes to be some prompting of the Omnibus
Company. Well thought on—where are the beautiful new vehicles,
and elegantly-attired and civil attendants, that were with so much
puffing promised us in lieu of the dirty and inconvenient 'Busses, and
the unclean, bellowing, foul-mouthed cads that at present afflict
society? We shall want a little omnibus lºº soon, and the
present buss-folk had better be warned, for if the House does take
them in hand, they will catch it hot and hot.
The Commons approved of certain resolutions by which it is pro-
posed to enable the House to get a little faster through its work, but
there was not much in them; and LoRD JoHN Russell, gave some
Foreign Affairs' explanations, but there was not much in them. Mr.
Punch then adjourned to supper, and before him were placed a couple
of bottles of champagne. When he rose, there was not much in them.
A ROYAL CHRISTENING.
“My dear Mr. Punch,” said the PRINCE Consort, as the two field-
marshals were inspecting the new Horticultural Gardens, “you chris-
tened the CRYSTAL PALACE, give me as pretty a name for this place.”
“My dear PRINCE ALBERT,” promptly returned the other Prince,
“when I look at CAPTAIN Fowke's beautiful garden and elegant
arcades, an appropriate name springs to my lips.”
* Which is ?” asked the PRINCE Consort.
“ARCADIA,” responded the PRINCE PUNCH.
The name was instantly adopted by acclamation, and the motto on
the tickets was ordered to be “Nos etian in Arcadid.”

An Endless Series.
We see that a French book has been brought out called, “La Bétise
Humaine.” . It is complete in one volume. This strikes us as a very
narrow field for all the betes of the human race to gambol about in.
We suppose the subject of “La Bétise Française” is reserved for
future volumes. If so, we are afraid that few of us will ever live to
see the completion of the work.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 191
THE TEUTONIC SERENADERS.
R. CHARLEs BABBAGE,
the other day, at
Marylebone, sum-
moned four German
vagrants, members of
a brass gang, for con-
tinuing to make a
noise in the neigh-
bourhood of his house
after they had been
ordered to move on.
A MR. HERRING ap-
peared for the bri-
gands, and took occa:
sion, in the course of
the case, to offer MR;
BABBAGE a piece of
advice; for which he
could hardly have ex-
pected six-and-eight-
}. We quote the
olice Report:-
It is doubtful, however, how far he is correct
in suggesting that German brass banditti
and Italian organ-grinders might, by a system
of mutual co-operation, be enabled to create a
continual disturbance under MR. BABBAGE's
windows with impunity. That gentleman made
no º to the friendly counsel gratuitously pre-
sented to him by the defendant’s advocate;
but the Magistrate delivered something like a
practical commentary upon it; for—
“MR. MANsfield, after going over the evidence, fined
the defendants in a penalty of 40s, each, or one month's
imprisonment.”
The friends of the poor foreigner, who claim
for him the right of exercising his sonorous
industry unrestrained by, the refined require-
ments of aristocratic intellect, will be pained to
learn that—
“They were locked up in default, the youngest crying
loudly.”
So perhaps their accomplices, now at large,
who may meditate the scheme which MR. HER-
RING is afraid they will practise to annoy MR.

ART PROGRESS AND ART PURPOSE.
., FROM the Report of the Council of the Art Union, we take the
liberty of extracting a few interesting passages. This is one of them:—
“The full-sized figure, as was stated last year, was executed for the corporation
of the City of London, and is placed in the Mansion House, with others commissioned
in accordance with a wise order of the court, made in 1852, for procuring suitable
works of art for the decoration of the Egyptian Hall in that building.”
It has of late become customary with foreign, and especially German,
artists to make statues which are intended to signify cities and towns.
These marble personifications of places are of the female form, and
mostly of colossal stature. The full-sized figure, executed for the
corporation of the City of London, and put up in the Mansion House,
may be presumed to be an image of this description. It is described
as full-sized, not, probably, inasmuch as it is as large as life, but as
being, considerably larger, especially in circumference. We suppose
that this work of Art is, in fact, the symbol of the City, represented as
a corpulent middle-aged Fº an abstract LADY MAYoREss.
There is something in the ollowing remarks:—
"Art should not be viewed as a mere accomplishment, but as essential to the
well-being of the State. It is not to be cultivated solely as a luxury for the few,
but made to enter into, cheer, adorn, and elevate the whole life of the whole
people :and the study of it should be forwarded in a grave and serious spirit, as a
matter of the utmost and widest consequence.”
Certainly, Art should not be looked upon as a mere accomplishment;
for then it would remain stationary at the level of the drawing which
ladies practise in drawing-rooms. But to assert that Art is essential
to the well-being of the State is to lay commendation upon Art rather
too thick. Merry England fº on pretty well when the principal crea-
tions of her pencil resembled the portraits and other sketches in chalk
with which our contemporary street boys decorate the walls. It may
be desirable that the study of Art should be forwarded in a grave and
serious spirit provided always that the gravity and seriousness of that
spirit shall not check the . of such a genius as that of
oGARTH, and that which has produced many celebrated cartoons and
woodcuts, which extreme, bashfulness, alone prevents us from more
distinctly alluding to. . The study of Art as exemplified in these
humorous productions is, in that case, a matter of the utmost and
widest consequence—if it is in any.
To the next position we object considerably:-
“Such pursuits interpose a wholesome safeguard against entire absorption, in
money- g—the danger of our day; and, in a country like this, cannot be toe
highly valued.”
The Art of making money is the Art to which every other branch of
Art is subservient—except in the case of amateurs. But who, that
does not paint or carve in order to get, money, paints or carves any-
thing to speak of, except joints and fowls! People who write music or
poetry for nothing, produce works for the most part worth just that for
which they were composed. The prize of distinction in every line, even
in the clerical, is money. The love of money, was the root of all evil as
long as there were misers; but there are hardly any misers now. We are
nearly all spendthrifts. We have a splendid appearance to keep up, a
terrific house-rent to pay, tremendous rates and taxes to meet, a luxu-
rious style of living to maintain, or else renounce Society; a retinue of
servants to support at a high cost; vast sums to bestow annually on
the education of our boys and girls if we wish them, to know, much;
and when to all the foregoing charges we add those of keeping
horses and vehicles, the sum total of our expenditure becomes
gigantic. -
Besides, our jaded nervous systems demand recreation; our women
and offspring continually want change of air, and the dresses of the
former have attained to such immense proportions, that the corres-
onding figures are incalculable. Moreover, we must insure our lives
H. or invest fortunes for our children...Everybody but a very rich
man, unless he is content to vegetate with his wife and family, and
even that is not to be done on moderate terms, has to work as hard as
he can for money in order to pay his way. The old Mammon-worship
is now confined to your bill-discounters, usurers, speculators, and
people of that class; it is they alone who adore the divinity of that
altar whereof, the front is stamped with £ 3, d. No doubt the Art
Union itself is desirous of making as much money as it can in a
respectable way. Those only who do not want any money can sincerely
decry money-making; and everybody must be absorbed in that pursuit
to the extent of jāj. unless he is such a rogue as not to wish
to discharge them, and such a philosopher as not to mind going to
prison, and finally to the workhouse itself. The pursuits of Art resolve
themselves, in these expensive times, into the pursuit of wealth ; and
the artist who is entirely absorbed in his art, is entirely absorbed in
money-making. That, after all, is the Artist's true Mission.

ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE OUR FIGURE, WE TAKE A TURKISH BATH!

(The TAKING or Fort sumTER.)
A FoETY hours' bombardment! Great guns throwing
Their iron hail: shells their mad mines exploding:
Furnaces lighted: shot at red-heat glowing:
Shore batt’ries and fort-armament, firing, loading—
War's visible hell let loose for forty hours,
And all her devils free to use their powers—
And yet not one man hit, her flag when Sumter lowers.
“Qh, here’s a theme!” quoth Punch, of brag abhorrent,
“”Twixt promise and performance rare proportion!
This show-cloth, of live lions, giving warrant,
Masking some mangy, stunted, stuffed abortion:
These gorgeous covers hiding empty dishes,
These whale-like antics among little fishes—
Here is the very stuff to meet my dearest wishes.
What ringing of each change on brag and bluster!
These figures huge of speech, summed in a zero:
This war-march, ushering in Bombastes' muster:
This entry of Tom Thumb, armed like a hero.
Qf all great cries eter raised o'er little wool
Of all big bubbles by fools' breath filled full,
Sure here's the greatest yet, and emptiest, for John BULL!
John always thought JonATHAN, his young brother,
A little of a bully; said he swaggered:
But in all change of chaff with one another,
Nor John nor JonATHAN was eler called ‘laggard.”
But now, if John mayn't JonATHAN style coward,”
He may hint Stripes and Stars were better lowered
From that tall height to which, till now, their flag-staff towered.”
Punch nibbed his pen, all jubilant, for galling—
When suddenly a weight weighed down the feather,
And a red liquid, drop by drop, slow .#
Came from the nib; and the drops rolled together,
And steamed and smoked and sung—“Not ink, but blood;
Drops now, but soon to swell into a flood, . -
Perchance e'er Summer's leaf has burst Spring's guarding bud.

And they by whom 'tis ta'en, by whom 'tis given,
Are both the children of an English mother; -
Once with that mother, in her wrath, they’ve striven:

But they must now meet in fraternal war?
If such strife draw no blood shall England scoff therefore ?

Point, pun and paragraph in this new way:
Till men shall read and laugh, and, laughing, say,
“Well thrust!. Punch is in vein: ’tis his red-letter day.’”
The weight sat on my quill: I could not write;
The red drops clustered to my pen-in vain;
I had my theme—“Brothers that meet in fight, -
Yet shed no blood!”—my jesting mood turned pain.
I thought of all that civil love endgars,
That civil strife breaks up and rends and sears,
And lo! the blood-drops in my pen were changed to tears!
And for the hoarse tongues that those bloody gouts
Had found, or seemed to find, upon my ears
Came up a gentle song in linked bouts,
Of long-drawn sweetness—pity breathed through tears.
And thus they sang—“’Twas not by chance,

items of miscella-

* DR. DE Jongh's
LIGHT BRowN Cod
Liver OnL—CURABILITY
or CoNSUMPtion.—The
following communica-
tion from ALLEN G.
CHATTAway. Esq., the
eminent surgeon of Leo-
minster, describes the
most certain means of
cure for consumption—
"Nearly four years since
two cases of confirmed
phthisis were placed
under my care. In both,
the lungs were a mass
of tubercular deposit.
The sole remedy em-
ployed was DR. DE
Jongh's Light Brown
Cod Liver Oil, and now,
1860, the patients are
strong and fat; and in
one case (male) hunting,
fishing, and shooting
are freely indulged in.”
To the º narrative succeeds a statement of the prices of DR. DE
Jongh's Cod Liver Oil. Next, comes, a string of medical observations on the
“Diseases of Advanced Years,”, directed to show that those diseases ma
always successfully treated by rubbing Holloway's ointment over the pit of the
stomach, and taking his pills into the interior of that organ. As these thera.
utical remarks are not headed “Advertisement,” they may be supposed to have
ên written either by the editor of the journal, or by some contributor to its
columns. Their author, whoever he is, should make himself acquainted with the
possibilities of physic, before he ventures to publish unqualified assertions as to the
curative powers of any remedial agent. It is not true that any medicine what-
ever, in any single case, proves a speedy, safe, and effectual remedy always, as ||
this writer declares that Holloway's Qintment and, Pills do in cases of con-
gestion. It is also impossible that any kind of cod’s liver oil, DR. De Jongh's or
anybody else's, light-brown or colourless, could have cured consumption in the
case of patients whose lungs were a mass of tubercular deposit. People whose
lungs are masses of tubercles have lost their lungs, and nothing in the world can
replace the destroyed tissues any more than it can turn a wooden into a natural
leg. MR. CHATTAway is above represented as saying what is as absurd as it would
be to say that DR. DE Jongh's cod-liver oil had restored sight to a person stone
blind with cataract. Could it do that, it would be fine light brown oil indeed—
warrantable to repair any kind of lights. A man might #. s make the declara-
tion ascribed to MR. Chattaway, believing it—if he were afflicted with softening
of the brain; and if cod liver oil could restore disorganised lung, it would no
doubt as effectually reconvert the addled contents of his cranium into healthy
cerebral substance.
Editors of respectable journals should be particular about the truth of every-
thing which they allow to appear in their papers, involving, if erroneous, the
deception and delusion of sufferers and their friends in matters of life and death.
A PATRIOTIC CRY.-LORD PALMERSTON's boast that an Englishman dared,
wherever he was, to exclaim with pride, “Civis Romanus Sum” will soon be out of
the power of the Pops, and soon, let us hope, in the power of GARIBALDI.
And many a name their country's fame
Hath sealed brave, wise, and true.
An awful host—above the coast,
About the fort, they hung;
Sad faces º: too proud to wail,
But with sore anguish wrung.
And Faith and Truth, and Love and Ruth,
Hovered the battle o'er,
Hind'ring the shot, that freight of death
Between those brothers bore.
And thus it happed, by God's
And those good spirits' ban
That Death forbore the leaguer’d place,
The battery-guarded strand.

THE POETRY OF LOCOMOTION.
PERsons of either sex, who, § the unexpected inherit-
ance of property, have been suddenly elevated from among
the industrious classes into the sphere of genteel Society;
men who have hitherto despised dancing, but having fallen
in love, are now desirous of ingratiating themselves with
some young lady by the practice of that elegant accom-
F.; may be interested in the subjoined notice, taken
rom our fashionable contemporary:—
“To ADUlts, who HAve NEveR LEARNT to DANCE.-A Lady of
celebrity as a teacher of dancing, undertakes to TEACH LADIES and
GENTLEMEN who have never before had the slightest knowledge or
instruction, in 12 private lessons, to go through all the fashionable
ball-room dances with ease of manner and grace of deportment,
§§ leaving and entering a room, curtsoy, &c.—Apply for address
to “The Professor of Dancing,’ &c. &c.
From the statement that the pupils will be taught to go
through all the fashionable ball-room dances with ease of
manner and grace of deportment, including leaving and
entering a room, it is to be inferred that ºil. Professor
of Dancing” considers leaving and entering a room as
proceedings comprised within the compass of her art. In
her view, and perhaps in that of other the like Professors,
going into a room and out of one, are acts of dancing; people
who mean to be elegant must not simply walk, but dance
into and out of a room. Is this necessity limited to the
instance of a ball-room, or does it extend to all manner of
rooms?... Ought we to dance u -stairs, down-stairs, into the
ladies' chamber, the servants' kitchen, the butler's pantry
the library, and every other apartment in the house and
afterwards to dance out again as we danced in P. The
reader has probably been accustomed to enter and leave
a ball-room in just the same manner as that in which he
has used to enter and leave an office. No doubt he has
entered the room by quietly stepping in; left it by simply
turning round and stepping out. Some diversion might be
caused by a succession of º: as the footman announced
them, º in upon the scene of an evening party, or
tripping away from it as ballet-dancers frisk on and off the

SHOCKING OBJECTS OF CHARITY.
THE Education Commissioners have recom-
mended the discontinuance, in charity schools,
of “Grotesque peculiarities of costume.” In a
school, founded in 1689, for poor boys born in
Cripplegate, the coat, is red, and the breeches
are-not blue, like the devil's; no, but they,
and the shoes, and stockings, used to be orange;
wherefore the boys were nicknamed yellow-
hammers. The rector of the parish is said to
desire the maintenance of this dress, being of
| opinion that any objection to it is overweighed
“by its picturesque appearance in church, and by
the fact that it is a visible commemoration of
a great event in national, history.” . The trea-
surer of Christ's Hospital is for retaining the
inexpressibly ridiculous costume of that charity,
on the ground that it identifies the boys, and
insures them protection in the streets. It
insures the poor boys derision if not insult in
the streets: and we should like to see its advo-
cate himself dressed up in it, and forced to walk
from Newgate to Apsley House, and back .
We should also like to have the parson above
alluded to rigged out in the Cripplegate uni-
form, and obliged to make a picturesque appear-
ance in church. Then we should like to have
the reverend gentleman, and the other, put into
a pound along with a donkey for a certain time,
during which the spectators might compare
those three.

for remedying some injury of #. heart. Sentiment is out of fashion,
whilst Crinoline and Pork-pie hats are in; and hearts are now reduced
to their lowest denomination, which is simply anatomical; they are
only hollow muscles. One would think that, if a heart wanted mending,
a patent auricle might be easily fitted on to it, or a patent ventricle
either, and that if a heart were lost, its place might easily be supplied
by an artificial one.

The morn is come: I rush in quick, and round the rooms I tear,
I run my eye the “line” along—“Not there, my che-ild, not there !”
I cast a shy glance upwards, and—“Oh, Mr. Faith,” I say,
“Oh, who will hang the hangers?—here, I’m ‘skyed” by the R.A.!”
Don't talk to me of “high lights:”, alas! ah woe is me!

Without paying a shilling entrance to the show of the R.A.
They praise GREEN's tints so pearly, and STIPPLER's greys so cool,
Pshal Newspapers are nothing now: each critic is a fool:
“Not much above the average.” Pooh 'tis what they always say,
They’ve not looked at my chef d’auvre, that should make me an R.A.
'Twas for this I got up early, and worked hard to make a name,
Spent my time with beery “models,” spent my gold on gilded frame:
There's many a wretched man in town, but few with heart less gay,
Than he who finds his picture has been skyed by the R.A.
Shall I plunge in dissipation?... Shall I go and have some beer?

*-
MODESTY AND MUSIC.
It is no new thing to find a gentleman advertising to
the world his willingness to marry; but it is not very
often that we see the matter treated in so extremely cool
and businesslike a manner as it was the other day through
the columns of the Era, which was fitly chosen, we think,
to be the mouthpiece, being usually anything but a senti.
mental print:—
WANº to form the acquaintance of a YOUNG LADY
VOCALIST (capable of giving finishing lessons in singing,
with a view to Matrimony, by a young Gentleman, Composer, an
Professor of the Pianoforte, in a large town, with an excellent teach-
ing practice of eight years' standing. Satisfactory references given
and required; good health, voice, appearance, and an unblemished
reputation indispensable. A fair complexion preferred. All letters
strictly confidential. Address, “Modestas,” Poste Restante, Leeds.
The only thing that we have changed in copying this
notice is the name by which the writer desires to be ad
dressed; but the word we have inserted is vastly more
appropriate than that which stood before in print. We
most, indeed wonder, that “ Modes.TAs.”, thought it
needful to hide his real name, for we should fancy from
his style that he is not at all a man who would shrink from
such publicity, or blush at the remarks which it might
possibly call forth. -
For all his brag about his business, it seems clear that
this “young gentleman” is looking out for means of in-
come as well as for a wife. . That he intends, when he gets
married to some “capable young lady,” to make her
singing somewhat of a step to his subsistence, although
he may not say so actually, is clearly enough betrayed.
Now, giving music-lessons is no pleasant occupation, as
any one who thinks about the matter may soon learn. If
the teacher have an ear, the work is aural torture, and
the pay is rarely adequate to the pain which is incurred.
It is hard for a young lady to maintain herself by music
teaching, without having to support a “young gentle-
man” as well. , . In spite, therefore, of the chance of
being taken to his bosom as well as to his business, we
should advise young lady teachers not to answer Mister
“ModestAs,” at any rate unless they have a brother in
the background who could come forward and prevent
their being taken in. -
It is very well to say that "Union is Strength,” but a
union with a person who, in spite of eight years' practice,
is scarce able to support himself, would be clearly more
a weakness than a proof of a strong mind. We think
too this “young gentleman” has been a little negligent in
not giving more particulars about his views and prospects
his person and his purse. This was surely to É. looke
for, seeing how particular he is in his inquiries, as to what
may be the personal and moral charms and qualities
enjoyed by the young lady of whom he is in search. That
a man should be desirous of good health in a wife is not
at all unnatural, or out, of common sense. But when he
states his want of a “good voice and appearance,” and
avows he has a preference for girls of “fair complexion,”
one feels tempted to inquire on the part of the young
lady with, whom he wants to wed, what are the advan-
tages he has himself to offer her, in the way of moral re-
putation and good looks. Does he go to church on saint
days, and what colour is his hair P Does he want luxuriant
whiskers, or has he a bad squint?... Judging from his style
of addressing, the fair, sex, and the Sultan, and insulting
air with which he orders them to show themselves (by
medium of pen and ink) before him, that he may throw
his handkerchief to her who suits, his taste, one might
think that this “Modestas” is an absolute Adonis, whom
to see is to fall in love with at first sight. .
Qn second thoughts, however, it is plain that his good
looks are not reflected by his looking-glass, and have
existence only in his own conceit. . For if he have no
other personal deformity, he must at any rate be far from
handsome in his features, since he has so monstrous an
exuberance of “cheek.”
“De Bello Gallico.”
OUR fashionable cºntempºrary, Bell's Life, has a column
every week devoted to “Fights about to come off.”
Amongst those about not to come off might be mentioned
the º: between the Duc D'AUMALE and PLoN-PLon.
The above is decidedly not the PRINCE NAPOLEoN Column.

THE MAY-DAY MUSIC-SHOW.
Like many another kindly hearted father of a family, Mr. Punch is
always glad of an excuse to take his wife and daughters to the Crystal
Palace: . And what better excuse could possibly present itself than
that which on May-Day was very seasonably afforded him? There is
a freshness and a vigour in the airs of the Creation which seems exactly
suited to the incoming of §§ The flow of HAYDN's tuneful genius
never welled forth more deliciously than in the showers of sparkling
melody ºl. through the work; while the sunshine that per-
vades it is the sunshine of the spring, that refreshes and invigorates,
and brings neither scorch nor blight.
Mr. Punch may thank his stars that he is not a musical critic, or he
might not have enjoyed last Wednesday's performance so much as, he
is free to own, he really did. , While his critical friends around him
were, keeping their ears stretched for acoustical shortcomings and
architectural defects (without allusion to which, no account of any
concert in the Crystal Palace Transept would be deemed to be com-
plete), Mr. Punch was calmly revelling in the charms of HAYDN's music,
and drinking strains delightful to his ravished sense. A grander or
more careful performance of the work it has never come within his
power to enjoy; and without descending to musical slangography, and
mystifying readers with a lot of high-flown bosh about “melodic pro-
gression” and “contrapuntal skill,” Mr. Punch will simply say that the
Creation was as well done as is possible at present, and that nowhere
but at Sydenham could thirteen thousand pairs of ears have so at once
enjoyed the hearing of HAYDN’s “marvellous work.” If any minds
were disappointed, it was because their bodies were not seated in good
laces; and for this such persons had themselves alone to thank. The
rystal Palace Concerts are invariably well advertised, and if people
choose to put of the selection of their seats, they cannot blame
the Company if persons more foresighted get a better place.
MUSICAL MARTYRDOM.
AFTER all, our English language is a wretchedly
defective one.
Of this we came to be convinced a night or two ago,
when ºf §: in our study after hearing the per-
formance of BEETHoven's grand Mass—we beg your
pardon, Exeter Hall, not to offend your Protestant
tastes, we should have rather said, grand Service.
While revelling in memory in the soul-inspiring strains
where with our ears had just been filled, and recalling
to our mind the glorious grandeur of the Gloria, and
the devotional sublimity of the softer Benedictus, a
barrel-organ struck up at the corner of the street, and
a German band began to bray close by our doorstep.
Surely, we .# (and we leave PRofessor MULLER

As the hearing of good music is a part of education, for it both
| refines the mind and elevates the taste, such music-shows as that
which was on May-Day held at Sydenham, should be frequently repeated,
and so turned to good account. One may call such concerts “Music-
Shows,” because the sight of that big orchestra is quite as wondrous
as the hearing, and eyes as well as ears have a pleasure in the treat.
Nowhere else is there a concert-room capable of holding some twent
thousand hearers, and of delighting them with music, performed wit
such effect. It is absurd to say the solos are perfectly inaudible, and
that an acre of the audience don't know what is being done. Every
note that TITIENs sung reached Mr. Punch as surely as the notes
which he each Wednesday receives for what he prints. From HERR
ForMEs, he confesses, he did not hear, so much, partly owing to that
singer's alterations of the text, and singing deeper notes than those
which HAYDN wrote. But where else could the chorusses have been
so grandly given, and did not their sublimity, gloriously make up for
many a smail defect? . A "new created word” of musical enjoyment
has been brought before the public, by the Crystal Palace orchestra,
and whatever its shortcomings, it will certainly be long before we else-
where find its like.

“I)EAR PUNCH,
“THE Royal Dramatic College (for the benefit whereof I attended a
performance on Friday evening last) is, I think, a very excellent and useful insti-
tution, and one that well deserves to dip into the pockets of the public. By
making known this fact through the medium of your columns, and by adding that
the College is, like most of us, much in want of funds, and that the largest
contributions will be most thankfully received for it, I have doubtless one
enough to secure its present welfare, and to draw some surplus thousands to lay
by for rainy days. - -
“I hope, however, that the public who subscribe so very liberally to whatever
is suggested to them by their Punch, will not fancy I have any further interest
in the matter than any one of them may in far reason entertain. I am neither
actor, scene-painter, nor dramatic author, and have no hope to profit by the
praiseworthy arrangements which have been lately set on foot for the advantage
of the stage. But, as a member of the public, I feel it is my duty in some way
to contribute to the benefit of those who have in very many ways done much to
entertain me; and if any word of mine can be of help to this new College, 1 shall
be very glad that you have let me say it.
“I am perfectly aware that by blowing my small trumpet in favour of this
charity, I shall incur the serious anger of pious Exeter Hall, and be doomed to
brimstony blazes for encouraging immorality. I know that *...; in any way
connected with the Stage is by certain of the Strand saints viewed as Devil's
produce; and that, to them, it is profaning the sacred name of Charity to apply
it to the work of aiding Śatan's imps. Exeter Hall just, now is in its ram-
pantest of postures; and its horn is so exalted, there’s no dropping any sense in
it. Exeter Hall is now F.” its annual reports, and showing how many
beefsteaks it has supplied among the cannibals, and how many nude niggers it
has put in Christian clothes. Of course while Exeter Hall views actors as children
of perdition, and adds the fell word “BottomLess’ in the direction ‘To The PIT,”
charitable gift. But saints should have a care how they
scatter their strong words, or, if not in the Pit, they may
be found in the wrong box. For instance, to speak ill of
the Royal Dramatic College is to prove oneself disloyal
and ill-speaking of the Crown. While the QUEEN allows
her name to head the Patrons of this charity, her loyal
subjects surely should abstain from thinking evil of it.
There never yet was known a more moral Court than
hers, yet the QUEEN goes to the play, and gives her
charity to players. To doubt the goodness of the Stage,
and its new º: the College, is to cast a shadow of
suspicion on the QUEEN; and under such a shade no son
of England ought to see her.
“Hac volvens animo (which, peradventure, some future
KEMBLE may be taught at the º: to translate) I
went to Covent Garden, “kindly lent by Mr. Gye,” pre-
pared for bravely sitting through a nearly seven hourſ
sight. . That it occupied this length of time, was simply
owing to the fact that so many willing hands were anxious
to assist in it. Does this sympathy exist in other trades
I wonder? Do hatters send the hat round for decayed an
stricken hatters? or lawyers give their precious time, or
lend a helping brief, to aid a learned brother who alasi
hath come to grief? As Heaven helpeth those who try
to help themselves, the promoters of the College, who in
person do so much for it, will surely be rewarded with
proportionate success.
“I have heard the British *... is sadly apt at
times to growl and grumble at not having enough shown
him for his money. But the bill of fare on Friday must
surely have contented the most gormandising appetite.
From tragedy and comedy to ...: and farce, every
line of acting had its best representative. We had an
interview with MR. HAMLET (otherwise known as MR.
FechTER) and with MR. Touchstone KEELEY, MR.
PROTEAN WEBSTER, and MR. JACK TAR. T. P. Cooke.
It made me feel quite º again to see this latter
veteran, who was as cheery in his voice, and as lively in
his legs, as though he were eighteen, instead of :*
upon eighty. To how many a British playgoer is T. P.
Cooke the beau idéal of the true-blue British Tar? and
where are we to hope that we may look to see his like?
When he comes bounding on the boards, he brings a sniff
of the sea with him. Stagy as perhaps it may appear in
other hands, he makes the part of the Stage Sailor the
most natural of characters. There is nothing coarse or
common in his talk, as he delivers it; but he shows the
British Sailor to be one of nature's gentlemen, whose
heart is his Poll's, whose purse is his friend's, and as
for his life—'tis the QUEEN's,
“But I must not longer dwell upon my dear old T. P.
Cooke, or I shall find myself deploring the declining of
the drama, and, in confirmation, citing MR, TAYLOR's clever
“Duologue” between old-fashioned high-flown Comedy and
modern low Burlesque. The ‘fast’ school, with its slangy
puns that pass for wit, has, I think, done much to vulgarise
and to degrade the Stage. Through it, actors have been
taught to lose thought of their bearing as it bears upon
the plot, and to pay attention only to the smartness of
their speech. For a lady to deliver a near-the-wind allu.
sion, so as not to cause a blush, has been considered chief
among the charms of comic art;. and how this can be
otherwise than lowering to taste, it passes my perception
as a critic to perceive. -
“But the fast school, I thank goodness, is fast wearing
itself out, and the tide of a reaction is now strongly set-
ting in. Let actors hold their heads up and not stoop to
be buffoons, and I am, sure the better-thinking better
portion of the public will readily accord them its respect
and its support., The ‘palmy days' we hear of, may be
again revived, and the Royal Dramatic College will flourish
in its funds, and stretch its Wings until they cover all who
need its shelter.

PAM AND
THE POETS.
REAT Men's Minds in un-
dress present an improving
study for little men. When
our great ones come out, in
full fig to Grocers' entertain-
ments, in elegant attire to
Academy dinners and the
like, the speeches of the great
creatures leave nothing to be
desired except the absence
of reporters. Then do they
discourse of ShakspeaRE,
taste, and the Musical Glasses
in a way that must confirm
the conviction of the snob-
mind that the race of the
Admirable CRichton is per-
º: among our Upper
en Thousand. Even when
a LoRD Chancellor makes
such an abominably lumber-
ing speech as that which he
inflicted on SIR Ch.ARLEs
EastLAKE and his fellow-
sufferers at the Academic
feast the other day, the snob-
mind...is not drawn away
from its religion—
“The lover may
Distrust the look that steals his
soul away;
The babe may cease to think that
it can play
With Heaven's rainbow; alchemists may doubt
"I'le shining ore their crucible gives out;
But Faith, fanatic Faith, once wedded fast
To some dear fiction, hugs it to the last."
and consolation is found in the recollection that, after all, LORD
CAMPBELL is not a real Swell, but only a lucky Scottish lawyer. -
But sometimes our real Great Men permit their minds to appear in
undress. Sometimes they speak without looking up their themes, or
having them looked up by affectionate secretaries, and then the world
has an opportunity of knowing the true nature of the creeds of Great
Men. Punch's friend PALMERston (and Punch will call him friend in
spite of a hundred eccentricities more curious than the vagary about
to be mentioned, for PAM is a good and brave PAM, and moreover is a
brother satirist, some of whose New Whig Guide is almost up to
Punch's standard) was induced, the other night, to expose his mind in
an edifying fashion.
Out of the small sum which is at LoRD PAM's annual disposal for
the purpose of helping men of Science and Literature, or of providing
for those whom they might themselves have provided for, if instead of
labouring for mankind they had been bill-brokers, stock-jobbers, adver-
tising quacks, pet parsons, or marine store-keepers, his iſordship has
bestowed £50 per annum upon one John Close, formerly a Butcher,
now a Poet, living in Westmoreland. This individual describes him-
self, seriously (and a gushing poem, presently to be quoted, places
his seriousness beyond a doubt) as “Poet Laureate to His Majesty
the KING OF Bonny, West Africa.” Interrogatory being made to
LoRD PALMERston in the House of Commons, on Thursday the 2nd
instant, as to the propriety of squandering public money on a Buffoon,
Lord Paixenºids replied that he had received many letters recom-
mending the said Buffoon as a proper person to receive a pension, and
that he considered Close to be “in the same category with BURNs.”
An indignant “Eh, sirs 1” probably broke out from his Lordship's
Scotch colleague, the Lord Advocate, for LoRD PALMeRSTON, amended
his declaration,--"not equal to Burns, but in the same category.”
So, Mr. Punch, on such a recommendation from his friend, thought
that a better acquaintance with the works and character of this West-
moreland BURNs would be desirable. The Poet's works lie before him,
and the Poet's character does not lie very deeply hidden in them.
The Westmoreland BURNs, fiery, like Pope, ByRoN, and his other
compeers, seems to have had a difference with the Editor of the London
Critic, Burns himself had differences with many persons, and occa-
sionally castigated his adversaries, but never so dashingly as thus:–
“In reply to the sneers of the wise Editor of the London Critic [who longs to put
his Fingers in MR. Close's Dish, who never thanked him for the Stamps sent II he
begs to say that had this Hungry “Critic' (!!) only got a slice of the same Royal
Loaf, he would, like Jack Horner, be ‘sucking his thumbs' in a corner, too happy
to say ‘boo to a Goose !" In the meantime we can excuse the contemptible jea-
lousy of a Dog in the Manger who hates that excellence it cannot reach," and
having given this ungrateful “sorry dog' a bone to pick, we leave him to the full
enjoyment of his Spleen.—J. Closk.”
the scene, and such are the epigrams which he launches at those who
offend him. There is some vigour in Holy Willie's Prayer, but its
irony is feeble in comparison to the polished sarcasm of the Butcher-
BURNs. Mr. Punch believes that the Editor of the Critic has been
ordered to Madeira, with faint hopes of his ever #. the con-
tributors have been sent to Malvern Wells, but the lives of the printers
may, it is thought, be saved by a few weeks at Hastings. Such is the
scathing power of genius!
But let us now see genius in “its softer hour.” Here is the poem
in which Lord PALMERston's BURNs dedicates his Poems to the
respectable black man called KING of Bonny:—
“DEDICATION.
“All hail I King PEPPLE, hail!
I never bent the knee,
Unless to God in prayer,
For help in misery—
My only help was there.
“All hail KuNg PEPPLE, hail!
I'll bow to thee,
The rightful Majesty
Of Bonny, in fair Africa-
I'll bend the knee.
“All hail I KING PEPPLE, hail :
Welcome to Britain's land,
I long to kiss the Royal Hand,
And in thy honour’d presence stand,
With pride I'll write for thee,
As long as life shall be —
True Laureate to Majesty.
“And when above the skies
In yon celestial clime,
I hope to see KING PEPPLE there,
Beyond the realms of time !
“October 10th, 1860.” “J. CLOSE, Port LAUREATE.”
How LoRD PALMERston must be reminded of the other and lesser
BURNs, and his votive poem, and “I’ll remember thee, GLENCAIRs.”
How his lordship must exult in the thought that he has done more for
the Butcher-Bard than Ministers in other days did for the Exciseman-
oet.
Let us hear a little of the English BURNs. He publishes a memoir
of himself, and it is signed by “DELTA.” There is an awful mystery
about this DELTA. Mr. Punch may have his own reason for humbly
thinking that this, like “SAM Dowell,” “DR. CAxton,” “DR.
SILVERFEN,” &c., &c., may be among what MR. DELTA is pleased to
call MR. Close's nom de plumes. But DELTA himself says:-
“This Enigma will only be known when the disguise is not required—when the
Poet shall have reached the summit of Fortune's Hill, and need our help no more—
then will the Invisible Cap be cast aside, and all shall know this "DELTA" even as he
is known."
The reverent parody in italics may justify Mr. Punch in observing
on the cover of the Poems that the work is “under the patronage
of the Bishops or LoNDoN and DURHAM, and the DEAN of CAR-
Lisle.” And here is MR. Close's final testimony to himself—it is
signed by the mystic DELTA—but published by Lord PALMERSTON's
Poet as a fitting exposition of his own character and genius:-
“In conclusion, we know no man MR. Close takes for his example--no mode
which he imitates, no beaten path in which he walks; but like all great minds, he
makes one of his own. Genius creates, not imitates. MR. Close seems in all his
writings to care neither for Queens or Kings, Bishops or Parsons, Squires or Peasants,
but rattles among them as if so many old bones or dry cabbage stalks, and sweeps
them all before him But commends us to his sweet Memorials of the dear,
Departed Dead; in these he touches every heart, and in these alone, we say again, his
Name will never die / As a lady once observed to us, when speaking of these
- * "—" MR. Close sings so sweetly about Heaven, that he makes one long
to be there 1"
Glancing through the Poems, in the ºp; of seeing what had prompted
this Lady's longing, it appears to Mr. Punch that the special pleasure
MR. Close looks to in the upper world is the certainty of meeting
there a certain DR. Rooke, a Pill-Maker, to whom the Bard addresses
two long poems. Mr. Punch regrets not to have room for them, but
here is a specimen:-
“His famous ‘Oriental Pills,”
Ship loads they bear away,
To every quarter of the world
Where Britain holds the sway.
“What letters from all ranks of men,
Each praise this great, good man,
Who, humble as a little child,
Same as when he began.
“Where'er the English tongue is spoken,
Waft his name ye gentle breeze;
Worthy of all mortal praises,
Form'd by God to bless and please."
The other BURNs, too, had his “DR. HoRNBook.” But Robert was a
careless poet, and it never occurred to him to add a certificate that the
Thus gracefully steps LoRD PALMERston's Robert BURNs upon Doctor must be all right hereafter, by reason of the excellence of his

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
medicine. The English BURNs is more thoughtful, and appends to his
poem the following tribute:–
“Thus the great J. SHERIDAN Knowles, Esq., speaks of these Pills, “Your Pills
are the most extraordinary purgative I ever took. Their operation is gentle, suffi-
cient, and perfectly uniform,’ &c.—See Anti-Lancet, p. 126."
Genius is shown in trifles, and this last proof that though a Poet,
MR. Close is also a man of business, and a complete character, seems
to Mr. Punch fully to justify the £50 annual pension. But he will
dismiss the Bard with a loftierP.": by adding another little bit of
the piety which has commended him to the patronage not only of that
eminent Christian, our PREMIER, but of the Bishops of Lonpon and
DURHAM, and the DEAN or CARLISLE. It is the conclusion of a
poem:- “P.S. A thought pops in, I had forgot,
To say a little word, sir:
And now I'll say it on the spot,
'Tis of my own accord, sir.
“When all our toil on earth, sir,
Our mortal troubles o'er,
Let's try to climb to Heaven, sir,
Where Tears shall fall no more.
“Let’s strive to enter in, sir,
The realms of endless bliss;
A glorious Crown to win, sir.—
h, * **, I ask but this!"
The stars are substituted for a Name which (the Bishops and Dean
may think the objection prudish) we do not print in levity.
There is the Poet whom LoRD PALMERSTON, and ever so many other
Lords, spiritual and temporal, think, should come into the same cate-
gory #. BURNs, and so he flings MR. Close the same pension which
is occasionally given to Literature and Science. Yet, to borrow from
the Scottish BURNs:—
“Yet let not this too much, my PAM,
Disturb thy youthful breast.
This curious view of Poet-kind,
Is surely not thy last.”
And Mr. Punch doubts not that he shall yet hear his friend announce
the bestowal of much more worthily earned guerdons, and perhaps
with a graceful regret that in an unguarded moment he put an
immortal name into the same “category” with that of a ridiculous
scribbler. 33&Hſ?014.
A BOX OF ODONTO.
R. PUNCH is very
much pleased to
observe that the
educated and ho-
nourable members
of , a profession
which renders in-
valuable service to
the º; have
united for an effort
to establish abroad
line of demarcation
between them-
selves and the
quacks and snobs
who have brought
discredit upon the
name of a Dentist.
It is true that no
7 thinking person
could confound
the accomplished
anatomical scholar,
whose treatment of
the Mouth is based
.#. the principles
of science, with the
|E
- - - - vulgar and greedy
creature whose only object is to make a lucrative job for himself,
and who is known wilfully to damage the teeth of unhappy, vic-
tims for the sake of extorting larger fees; but then the world is
not made up of thinking people, and the quacks reap large harvests
from the ignorance of the many. Fellows without other qualifi-
cations for their calling than a certain brutal strength and a certain
empirical adroitness, and other fellows without even these advan-
tages, and who declare that they neither expect nor desire to see
their maltreated patient twice, manage by dint of puffing and impudence
to gain large incomes at the expense of the fools who trust them. It
was time that the real Dentist should bestir himself. and Mr. Punch is
happy to say that the Gentlemen of the Profession have joined for the
discomfiture of the quacks. An educational test, and the possession of
a diploma now offered by the Royal College of Surgeons, are among
the conditions of the associated band of honourable practitioners, and
it may easily be imagined that the resolution to purge the Profession
from even nominal connection with the low fellows who have claimed
to belong to it has caused great rage among these disreputable snobs.
Henceforth, it will be the fault of a patient himself if he opens either
his mouth or his purse to a quack Dentist.
The other day a dinner in support of one of the excellent institutions
connected with the movement was held, and one of the very foremost
men of the day, PROFEssoR Owen, did honour to the profession, and
himself by presiding over one hundred and thirty gentlemen who
assembled on the occasion. PRofessor Owen made an admirable and
mordant speech, in the course of which, he remarked that “the Pro-
fession of a Dentist was now elevated to the level of that of a Physician,
or a Surgeon.” PROFEssoR PUNCH cordially assents to the proposition,
but calls upon the public to take notice that the profession of dentistry
is just as much divided into two parts as is either of the other callings
mentioned by his friend PRoressor Owen. Mr. Punch is happy to
believe that the majority of physicians and surgeons are skilled, hu-
mane, high-minded gentlemen, who take pride in their noble avocations,
and who devote themselves as sedulously to the case of a pauper
child as to that of an affluent. Marquis. That there are pestilent
quacks who pretend to be physicians and surgeons, who care only for
patients whom they can fleece, and are reckless how they ruin consti-
tutions and distort limbs, provided they can, plunder the sufferer, is
equally true. Now, no one but a fool would call in such creatures,
and Mr. Panch, pointing out to the public that similar distinctions
prevail in the profession of a Dentist, begs that the public will not be
a greater fool in regard to its mouth, than it would be in regard to its
leg or its stomach. Folks who put their fingers into other folks'
mouths should have, clean hands, and Mr. Punch counsels a tooth-
aching world to see that it does not employ the dirty-handed outsiders
of dentistry. . It is open to every honest and clever man, to study the
science, and to be admitted to the ranks of its honourable professors,
and Mr. Punch will only add, in the interest of the human Jaw, that
he is proud to lend his aid in behalf of the anti-Quack movement. He
has no idea (and intends to have none) how keen a serpent’s tooth may
be, but the public will be a thankless child if it is not grateful to the
true and trustworthy custodians of the Ivory Gate for their gallant
confederation in defence of the British Tooth.

“THE BATTLE OF THE BUDGET.”
OR PAPER versus TEA.
THE times they were bad, and GLADSTONE looked sad,
As he sat at the seat of Exchequer;
And in spite of his pluck he felt down on his luck,
And puzzled to keep up his pecker, his pecker,
Sore puzzled to keep up his pecker.
“Behind Whitehall scenes we must find ways and means,
r soon we from office must trudge it;
Who 'twixt surplus and deficit a tertium quid efficit,
Is the man to determine our budget, our budget—
Is the man to determine our budget.”
Then to lighten his griefs he summoned the chiefs
f Boards far as Fifeshire from Finland;
The Customs due East, by four miles at the least,
And the Board of Revènue called Inland, called Inland—
And the Board of Revènue called Inland.
Thus summoned expressly came grave MR. PREssLEY,
With no end of returns in his Fºl. ;
And SIR THoMAs FREMANTLE, of his wares brought a hantle,
In the shape of a cartload of dockets, of dockets—
In the shape of a cartload of dockets.
With subtraction, division, and compound addition,
Went to work these two Revenue Rustums:
Proved that Customs must rise by the fall of Excise,
And Excise rise by fall in the Customs, the Customs—
Excise rise by fall in the Customs.
Till GLADstone grown buoyant, of manners defiant,
Over ANDERson's head cut a caper;
“A ºfº. says he, “or its shadow, I see,
And fºil dock the Éxcise upon paper, on paper-
I’ll dock the Excise upon paper!
“”Tis a tax upon knowledge, which each Oxford College
For removing can hardly abuse me:
And whatever’s got off it, swells newspapers’ profit,
So their good word they’ll hardly refuse me, refuse me—
Their good word they’ll hardly refuse me.
“I’ve my surplus en l'air: 'tis not like GLAsse's hare;
You’re not forced to catch e'er you cook it. . .
In your balance you dip: up your income you whip; .
For a bad debt—as good you can book it, can book it-
For a bad debt—as good you can book it.
“A penny reduction in Income-Tax suction,
Makes John BULL my much obliged creditor.
With the Paper-Tax off, at my surplus to scoff
I defy you to find me an Editor, Editor–
I defy you to find me an Editor l’’
When the surplus was made, it looked well, but 'tis said,
It would hardly bear close overhauling: -
Like Don Quizote’s new vizor, which the good Don was wiser
Than allow to be tested by mauling, by mauling—
Than allow to be tested by mauling.
When the Budget came out, immense was the rout
Of HER MAJESTY's strong Opposition.
“Are we blind, dumb, or deaf P Is it surplus or deficit,
Or Cabinet compound division, division—
Or Cabinet compound division?
“Let JoHN BULL ere he º: up the brown GLADSTONE wraps up
In Paper, of duty new lightened,
ink, Paper-Tax gone can no more be laid on,
But the Income-Tax screw may be tightened, be tightened—
The Income-Tax screw may be tightened.
te #. a friend of the masses—the stout working-classes—
ares GLADstone cut impudent capers
He who lives in a fright of GIBsoN and BRIGHT,
y soft sawd'ring the vile penny-papers, the papers–
Soft sawd'ring the vile penny-papers!
“'Tis we who would cure the wrongs of the poor,
In the social scale lifting the masses,
By giving 'em tea from war duties set free,
Cheap sugar, and ditto molasses, molasses—
Čheap sugar and ditto molasses!”
“Cheap papers, cheap knowledge—for taproom or college,”
“Cheap tea is the poor man's salvation,”
Working-men's rights and wrongs—to it, hammer and tongs,
Go the Ins and the Outs of the nation, the nation—
Go the Ins and the Outs of the nation.
Till 'twixt one and the other John BULL they so bother,
He asks where the argument’s tending;
Surplice-rows, he well knows, never come to a close,
And this surplus-row seems as unending, unending—
This surplus-row seems as unending.
So from Placemen to Punch (the best of the bunch,
Of John Bull's unofficial path-finders),
John turns for advice, and Punch in a trice,
Qracks the nut that is placed 'twixt his grinders, his grinders—
Cracks the nut that is placed 'twixt his grinders.
“When off tax-payers' backs the State lifts a tax,
The relief never question, but take it;
If a Chanc'llor declare there’s a surplus to spare
Don't be curious how he may make it, may make it—
Don't be curious how he may make it.
“And if you inquire which side most aspire
To your good—friends of tea, friends of paper ?
Six of one, my dear brother, half-a-dozen of t'other—
On each side equal volume of vapour, of vapour—
On each side equal volume of vapour.
“I haven't a doubt, in what GLADstone’s about,
And in that which DISRAELI professes,
They are prompted—the two—by as much love for you,
As the cook's for the poultry he dresses, he dresses—
As the cook's for the poultry he dresses.
“One your paper would free, t'other cheapen your tea,
And with both 'tis all love of the people—
As we know that the cause of the quicksand that draws
To the Goodwins is Tenterden steeple, its steeple—
To the Goodwins is Tenterden steeple.”
A SYMPTOM OF SANCTITY.
In a Memoir of Joshua Watson, reviewed by the English Church-
man, there occurs a funny statement concerning a gentleman of a
name celebrated in connection with Parliamentary Debates—a MR.
HANSARD, printer to a former House of Commons, and parishioner of
St. Giles's; in which parish he is described as having been “the
clergyman's right hand.” We are informed that:—
“He was a man of most unfeigned humility, seeming heartily to believe every
one better than himself. He always used a little ‘i’ in his letters, not at all out of
ignorance or conceit, as the Speaker once bore wituess, but out of a true genuine
feeling.”
Our ecclesiastical contemporary, in circulating the above anecdote,
publishes a fact which will be felt as a severe hit by enthusiastic
Romanists. The gentleman whose name is above mentioned seems
not only to have been quite as good a Saint, for the matter of works,
as any one in the Roman Calendar, but also to have distinguished him-
self by a piece of eccentricity nearly equal to anything of the kind for
which the canonised worthies of Popery, were, any of them, remark-
able. One cannot, however, help feeling that, if any person over whom
one had any control took to describing himself by a small “i” under
the influences of religious feelings, we should be inclined, if possible, to
put a finishing touch to the living portrait of a Romish Saint which he
would present, by shaving his head. The ALPHONso LIGUORIs, FRANCIS
XAVIERs, and the rest of their cowled fraternity, seem to have usually
had that operation performed to their own cheek, as well as upper
storey. Their adoption of the tonsure may be ascribed to a medical
instinct, which, if not, miraculous, was sound, although the remainder
intheir mental faculties may have been in a state that was very
ifferent.
The Coppers of Catholicism.
THE Giornale di Roma laments in stating that the sum of Peter's
|Pence which the Pope has received “is altogether insufficient to carry
on a civil war.” The total amount of the subscriptions of 250,000,000
of Catholics falls short of 3000,000 Roman crowns. Peter's Pence,
therefore, are something considerably under a penny a-head. Papists
pay less than three farthings in the brown; and the Holy FATHER
will perhaps ultimately receive “monkey's allowance”—more kicks
than halfpence.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 6. The Lords had a discussion about the Canal of the
Future, that is to say, the impossible trench which M. Lesseps pre-
tends to think he can cut through the Isthmus of Suez, The Govern.
ment opinion upon the subject is, that if the Canal could be made, we
ought not, for political reasons, to allow it, but that inasmuch as the
Canal cannot be cut, the subject may, and the wise course is to let the
speculators ruin themselves and diddle the Pacha. This seems straight-
forward and benevolent enough.
MR. SPEAKER DENIson, who had had a relapse into indisposition,
re-appeared, and made his apologies for having been ill. The House
cheered him so loudly that he began to think he had done a clever
thing, rather than not, in catching the rheumatism. Mr. Punch hopes
to behold the brave Speaker “astir in his saddle” (as MR. DisBAELI's
song goes) in due season, and to see him, like a true Whig, following
Fox and avoiding pit.
LoRD John Russell made an important reply to an important
question from MR. GREGORY. The American Difficulty is beginning
to create, English difficulties. The North is calling on PRESIDENT
LINcoLN to blockade the ports of the South, and the South is sending
out Privateers to intercept the commerce of the North. Lord joins
announced that England can recognise no blockade except a real o
and that she is prepared to regard the South as sufficiently consolida
to entitle her to be treated as a Belligerent, not as a mere rebel, and
therefore her right to issue letters of marque must be acknowledged.
This is a very prosaic paragraph, but Mr. Punch “reserves to himself”
the right to be grave, gay, lively, and severe exactly when it pleases
III].
Our Daughter ALICE is, to have £30,000 down, and £6,000 a year,
LoRD PALMERston remarking, very properly, that she is not our
Eldest Daughter, and may not require the same allowance as the
future Queen or PRussia, but that it is not for the honour of
England that her Princesses should f out as paupers. Quite the
reverse, and what is more, Mr. Punch insists that all the money be
settled on his amiable young friend Alice, so that she may draw her
own cheques, and not have to ask her husband for money every time
she wants to buy pins or postage stamps, or a little present to send
over to her dear Mr. Punch.
Then was the Paper Resolution moved by MR. GLApstone... Loºp
Robert CECIL opposed it, and º: the Lords would reject the Bill
to be based on it: MR. Leveson Gowen approved it, and paraded the

There was some sparring over one of the Budget resolutions by
which power was given to the police to visit Late Houses of Refresh-
ment, and MR. GLADston E withdrew it. Why should people's late
hours be interfered with ? demands HoRAce, a competent authority:—
* Dicetur merità Nox quoque naºnià.”
(No, Wiscount, nºnia signifies properly a mourning, not morning song.
You are quite º to make the joke, but you should be informed that
the ancients used the word also for a lively sportive song—and HoRACE
alluded to a Late House where good music is heard.) The three-guinea
licence entitling the spirit dealers to sell as little as a quart of spirits
was agreed to, as were some other small propositions. MR. STIRLING
proposed a tax of a farthing on pawnbrokers’ tickets, and thought that
as 150,000,000 of these tickets were printed every year, the duty would
be worth having, besides that the pawnbrokers, who he said offered so
much encouragement to intemperance and crime, deserved no favour
at the hands of the legislature. MR. GLADstone replied that there
was much in the suggestion, but that he thought. Parliamentary
.g ought to be made into the system under which our Uncles
collar so much plunder. MR. BENTINck wanted to know whether,
after the war-news from America, Government intended to persevere
in throwing away the Paper duty. LoRD PALMERston did not see
that the news, distressing as it was, ought to interfere with the
fudget. Mr. Disºr, charged the Ministers with trying to press
the Budget with “unseemly haste.”
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL moved the second reading of a Bill for
protecting our Artists against pirates and impostors. He gives a
painter or sculptor the sole right of copying his work, and this right is
to have a duration of º years. Two or three Members thought the
enactment over-stringent, but as SIR RICHARD explained, it is perfectly
competent to an artist to sell his copyright with the picture, and there-
fore a purchaser can º himself as to buying either the work only,
or the right to do as he likes with the work, and has only to fork-out
with becoming º to become the sole proprietor. Millions of
money are .." offered to Mr. Punch for leave to copy his mar-
vellous Cartoons, but he invariably refuses such leave, except in the
case of his friends the Princesses, who, learn at once their drawing
and their constitutional and political lessons from his miraculous
delineations.
Thesday. LORD, Lyndhu RST made an excellent speech on the Wills-
of Britons Abroad-Bill, and laughed at LoRD CAMPBELL, who had said
that he did not know where his own domicile would be, explaining to
that astute Scotsman that his domicile would be in England, if he
should happen to become etherealised south of the Tweed, and in
Scotland, should he select that country as his place of departure for
Elysium. Mr. Punch trusts that neither alternative will be embraced by
the noble CHANCELLOR for many a year, and perhaps may fix the date as
remotely as possible by hoping that it will not occur until somebody
has made a worse speech than that of LoRD CAMPBELL at the Academy
dinner this year.
How much more are we to hear about those tiresome Ionians?
Quousque, tandem f. Will they not comprehend that England does not
in the slightest degree care about the possession of their Seven
Islands, and would gladly be relieved from the charge of “protecting”
them, but that the Islands were handed to her by Europe, in order that
she might keep them against—never mind, anybody 'likely to be
troublesome to the general peace, and that she is bound, for that
reason, to hold them. MR. MAGUIRE made a long and cleyer speech in
fayour of transferring them to Greece, because certain of the Ionians
wish such a process. MR. MAGUIRE, as we took the liberty of ob-
serving the other day, more F. to your elbow, and if the late
bow, Tom MooRE's friend we mean, he
would have told you, what you know very well, that when Thomas, in
Lalla Rookh, sang of the wrongs of Iran, he meant Erin, and that
4! Hassan with his “bloody, bold, and countless crowd,” was a delicate
#º of John BULL. Do we twig your parable, man of Cork?
a!. MR. GLApston E made an eloquent speech, ºf to his own
mission to the Isles, and declared his opinion that the Ionians are a
moral and good people, not difficult to govern, and in their hearts fond
of the English; but he added, that they are not only moral, but Moral
Cowards. He, of course, explained that we cannot part with a position
which we hold under compact with Europe. MR, LAYARD refuted a
good many of MR. MAGUIRE's allegations, and added that Greece was
shamefully governed, and after some more debate, Lord PALMERston
hoped that the Islanders would understand that we like them very
much, but must decline to let them have their own way.
A Bill for amending the Royal Court of Jersey, stated to be the
very worst tribunal in the whole world, was introduced by SERJEANT
PIGoTT. But whether that excessively tight little island will permit
its Court to be reformed is dubious. The Jurats of that Court
much resemble our own County Court juries. In Jersey the verdict
always goes for the Jersey-man, in the County Court always for the
Tradesman.
Then came a Storm, about nothing, certainly, but it was none the
less fierce for that. Loºp Roºſcºcu did his best to impede the
º: of the Budget, and in doing so he used language which must
e O. K. (“all correct,” Wiscount) from the son of the MARQUIs or
SALISBURY, but which might have been thought decidedly low, had it
come from anybody else's son. He spoke of MR. GLADstoNE’s “ven-
geance and spite,” of his “tricks, more worthy an attorney than a
statesman,” of his “tyranny,”, and of his, “audacity.”. SIR John
PAKINGTON was obliged to refer to his friend's not “unnatural excite-
ment,” but the CHANCELLOR took it very blandly, and conceded an
adjournment, which would give LoRD Robert time to “reconsider
his vocabulary.” But there was one person who may have enjoyed
this display of coarseness and bad temper. LoRD Robert Cecil has
the reputation of being the author of the fierce attack made by the
uarterly on MR. DISRAELI, and moreover of having an idea that he,
RoBERT, ought to lead the Conservatives. However, if MR. DisRAELI
was amused at the rebellious young nobleman's taking so much pains
to show how fit he is for leadership, the Member for Bucks did not
manifest his satisfaction, but complimented LORD, Robert on his
“constitutional opinions,” expressed in effective language, adding
that LoRD Robert had “distinguished” himself. Perhaps, when
MR. DisRAELI corrects the report of his speeches he will write “dele
dis,’ and read ‘ex.’”. After an attack, on his own account, upon MR.
GLADSTONE, and after tendering to him the information that he might
bully his colleagues, but must not bully the House of Commons,
MR. DisrAELI signified his opinion that Government had acted wisely
in giving way.
Hednesday. SIR. L. PALK moyed the Second Reading of a Bill for
facilitating the improvement of Labourers' Cottages, and did so in a
speech for which Mr. Punch, his co-labourer in the good cause, offers
him all acknowledgment. The measure was not unkindly received, but
the Landlords are very much afraid of being touched, and it is doubtful
whether the measure will get through. One of LoRD RAYNHAM's well
meant measures was postponed, the other (a Cruelty to Animals' Bill)
was withdrawn, after some wretched joking from MR. HALIBURTON.
Thursday, being Holy Thursday, the Lords made holiday to go
with the Gold Stick and the Charity Boys to Beat the Bounds.
In the Commons the HoME SecretARY stated that a Proclamation
was about to issue, warning all, the QUEEN's subjects against any
interference in the American Civil War.
Another manifestation, but this time a mild one, was made against
the Budget; but the only, speech that, had any backbone in it was
one by MR. MAGUIRE, who argued that the British paper-maker
would be unable, under the new arrangement, to compete with the
foreigner. The stereotype answer is “Free Trade all round, whatever
the foreigner may do;” and what has been sauce for the agricultural
goose must now be sauce for the commercial gander. He took a
division, but was beaten by 100 to 54. Army estimates, then came on,
and the natural history of a new animal was discussed. This is not
the Gorilla, but a creature to be largely employed by the Horse
Guards, and to be called the Soldier Clerk. We § he will make
good progress, for, otherwise, he will be classed by political naturalists
with the Soldier-Crab.
Friday. LoRD DERBY, in a becoming speech, called attention to the
alarming state of things in America, and dwelt earnestly upon the
necessity of warning our sailors and others not to take part in
Privateering, especially as the North had “concluded” to treat Priva-
teers as Pirates. The Noble, Landowner characteristically selected,
as the severest term he could apply to a Privateer, the phrase “Sea-
Poacher.” LoRD GRANVILLE repeated what SIR GEORGE LEwis had
said on the previous night, and it should be notified far and wide
to all adventurous British spirits, that if captured in a Privateer those
spirits will be hanged, and not a word in their favour will be said
by our Government.
In both Houses the Syrian question was discussed. We are to hope
that the French will evacuate that country at the appointed time, and
a Governor is to be appointed who will, if possible, keep the tribes in
order. LoRD John Russell, delivered a hopeful kind of speech about
Austria, and said he did not mind being called an old-fashioned poli-
tician holding obsolete notions. To adopt, and therefore to crystallise
and immortalise, an ancient saying, a man is an ass who minds being
called anything provided he is not called too late for breakfast.

HUMBUGS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
THERE are Humbugs in the House of Commons. Yes, there are. It is no breach of
rivilege to say so. A few Humbugs occasionally contrive to get themselves introduced
into the Strangers' Gallery. But, of course, there are no Humbugs among Honourable
Members. Accordingly, our contemporary, the Observer, in an article on a late division,
makes a great mistake in the following remarks:—
“But it is really too bad to come to those Members who continue to fill Liberal seats, and who had formerly
been in office with the party at the head of the Government, and who are, no doubt, annoyed because there
are not enough of offices left for them now. Some of these are right honourable i. who owe their
rank to the persons they now oppose, and who ought to hesitate before they helped, so far as they could, to
risk the chances of a dissolution, and the increase of confusion at home and abroad.”
It is utterly impossible that any, gentleman, right honourable, or simply honourable by
position, should be personally so dishonest as to vote against the Government, and the
public good, from such, dirty motives as those which the Observer ascribes to some, whom
it does not mention, and whose names cannot even be conjectured. There are no more any

Commons at Jericho before we would say that
there were any such scoundrels in it as these
treasonable papists and equally treasonable ego-
tists. If there were any—but the supposition
is absurd—among the representatives, so called,
of the people, they would, at the next dissolution,
cease to represent their present constituencies,
unless there are some boroughs and counties in
Ireland wherein the majority of the voters d
themselves as the Pope's subjects, and not those
of the QUEEN. These places might return
papistical traitors to that Parliament in which
we all know that there are now none. The ego-
tistical traitors, at any rate, would be all sent
about their business, which is wholly private,
and not one of them would acquire a new seat,
unless some extreme Reform Bill should have
enfranchised rascaldom. We sincerely trust

THE WEATHER LAST WEEK.
WHAT is that faint and melancholy note,
Borne ...', on the sharp East wind,
Whose eager blast bites through our overcoat,
With down of eider thickly lined?
It sounded forth of yonder clump of oak,
Darkling beneath the leaden sky; . . [spoke.
Through the bare twigs some plaintive creature
It was the Cuckoo's cry!
That timid trill outpoured from yonder brake!
Ah! can it be the Nightingale?
That broken jug! That interrupted shake!
The breeze cuts short the poor bird's tale,
The throstle, too, as though for cold in pain,
High perched upon the leafless tree,
Attempts a fitful and a dreary strain,
Sung in a minor key.
There's one, an only, Swallow to be seen;
With feeble wing the straggler flies.
What doeth he out in this air so keen,
Unless he flies for exercise?
On such a day no gnat will stir for him;
All insects find it much too cool:
He would not catch one midge, were he to skim
The nearly frozen pool.
The redbreast shivers o'er her callow brood;
The shrunk, nipped buds, her nest reveal.
Cocksparrows cannot find their children food;
No caterpillar for a meal! -
The badger, dormouse, hedgehog, squirrel, creep
All into their respective holes:
This merry May sends all such things to sleep,
A May as at the Poles!
Ah, how I pity birds and beasts that roam
Unsheltered save by fern and briar!
I know what I shall do; I shall go home,
Draw down the blinds; make up aroaring fire;
Command a basin of hot soup, and dine
On Qhristmas beef; and, having fed,
Brew for myself a tankard of spiced wine;
Have that, and go to bed.
Joking Combined with Business.

ODE TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH,
O JonATHAN and JEFFERson,
Come listen to my song;
I can't decide, my word upon,
Which of you is most wrong.
I do declare I am afraid
To say which worse behaves,
The North, imposing bonds on Trade,
Or South, that Man enslaves.
And here you are about to fight,
And wage intestine war,
Not either of you in the right:
What simpletons you are! .
Too late i. madness you will see,
And when your passion cools,
“Snakes 1" you will bellow, “How could we
Have been such "tarnal fools!”
One thing is certain; that if you
Blow out each other's brains,
'Twill be apparent what a few
Each blockhead's skull contains.
You'll have just nothing for your cost,
To show, when all is done.
Greatness and glory you’ll have lost;
And not a dollar won.

The bond of kindred speech,
And further, by the special tie
Of slang, bound each to each,
All-fired gonies, softhorn'd pair,
Each other will you lick?

Throw down your arms right slick,
You'll chaw each other up, you two,

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAY 13th, Monday. The Lords were engaged |. a subject of
course utterly unworthy to occupy the time of well-dressed gentlemen
who read HoRAce, back Diophantus, and applaud GRIsI, but which
somehow did manage to interest them for a good while. LoRD
SHAFTESBURY is exceedingly irate at that part of the Report of the
Education Commissioners which refers to the Ragged Schools, and
to-night he expressed his wrath in very strong language. He described
the Report as untrue, unfair, and ungenerous. The Education Com-
missioners do not think the Ragged Schools sufficiently sound in
theory or advantageous in practice to entitle them to Government aid.
The Commissioners object to the want of regularity and discipline
in the Schools and to the recognition of habitual dirtiness as a con-
dition to be tolerated in a pupil. They also urge that the schools
draw away children from better schools, where the system is more
rigid. LoRD SHAFTESBURY replies, that we are not to wait for a
perfect system before doing anything, but are to try to do our best,
that the poor regard these schools as a recognition of their class, that
in two years people of “the poorer sort” have contributed nearly
£250,000 for the schools, that the influence of the school children upon
their parents is often very beneficial, and that the great hindrance to
doing much more good is the horrible Home of the very poor. He did
not want Government money, but considered that the schools had a
perſect right to it. He injured a good cause by intemperate language,
and made, more suo, reference to the Almighty, and talked of protests
against Wile Slanders. The Colonial Secretary, on the part of the
Commissioners, said that LoRD SHAFTEsBURY was exciting himself
needlessly, and that he ought not to use before the Lords the
“grandiose” style that suited Exeter Hall. He did not set up like
LoRD SHAFTEs BURY a “hyper-claim to infallibility,” but considered the
great National Schools, on which millions were spent, of far more im-
portance than these Ragged Schools. And he added that these
schools did claim Government money, and Lord Shaftesbury was
not entitled to be their mouthpiece.
MR. Roebuck had been informed and believed that in the
minority against the Repeal of the Paper Duty, there appeared a
WOL. XL, Y
gentleman who was not º lº. to take part in any business
at all. The Member for. Sheffield brought the subject, before the
House, and an explanation of the case was, offered by a friend
of the individual in question. It was stated that the mind, of
that person had been perturbed, and that he had voluntarily retired to
an asylum, into which he could not be received until two medical men
had given a certificate couched in language so strong as perfectly to
justify inquiry whether the document were a formality or a represen-
tation of facts. But it was also stated that the Member alluded to was
placed under no restraint, and, choosing to come from the asylum to
the House, did so, conversed rationally, voted, and went away quietly,
Mr. Punch, having recorded the circumstances, leaves an unpleasant
subject, with the single remark that though, as it happened, the regis-
tration of the vote was of no consequence, it will be well that whippers-
in on both sides use sound discretion when any similar case again
arises. In these days people are not so reverent as of old, and cause
for a certain kind of talk should be avoided. The rule is not, now

vigorously on the other side, and told the Upposition that though the
cry "Tea against Paper” would be a good one with the masses, the cry
of “Lords against Commons” might not be one which the Conservative
party would be so happy to raise. This significant hint—in the old
Graham manner—brought up LoRD, J9HN MANNERs, who denounced
the One Bill device as cowardly, and after some more debating, and, a
smart address from MR. WHITEsine, who argued, against the validity
of the marriage between repeal and supply, a spirited reply from Lond
John Russell, and some more petulant nonsense from LoRD ROBERT
Cecil, there was a struggle on the question of adjournment, which
was opposed by the Government, but sternly demanded by MR.
DisRAELI. A couple of divisions, 247 to 164, and 233 to 145, against
adjournment, and then, the motion being again made, LoRD PALMelt-
ston laughingly seconded it.

formation that though ; would probably re-annex St. Domingo,
she did not intend to establish Slavery there.
MADEMOISELLE ADELINA PATTI was to make her début at the
Royal Italian Opera, as Amina in the Sonnambula, and Mr. Punch, of
course, counted out the House, and adjourned to MR. GYE's theatre.
Thanks to the exertions of the brilliant young vocalist, her charmingly
black eyes, and his own exceedingly comfortable stall, Mr. Punch
passed a far pleasanter evening than he would have had at Westminster,
and he is happy to have assisted at a very note-worthy first appearance.
He wishes, however, that ladies of distinction would take names on
which wits of indistinction cannot make silly little jokes, for he has
already received several volleys of nonsense, about PATTI’s first ap-
pearance in Martha, and much folly based upon the unfounded assump-
tion that paté, or its equivalent “patty,” is sounded in the same manner
as the name of the black-eyed young lady of Madrid.
GRIsI was in a box, and warmly º'. her young successor, as
became a true artist, and Mr. Punch, beholding this, kissed his hand
elaborately to MADAME GRIsi, and begs to explain that what she
probably took for impertinence, was really adoration.
Wednesday. Why is, the House of Commons like a Scotch cottage?
Because it contains a Butt and a BEN. Well, the former moved the
Second Reading of a Bill for giving new trials in criminal cases. The
HoME SECRETARY said that innocent persons were never convicted,
that juries would cease to exercise ſorbearance, and would find every.
body guilty if responsibility, were removed by a system of revision of
verdicts, that every convicted culprit would of course demand a new
trial on the chance of getting off, and, finally, that there was no
reason º: tampering with the system of the country. So the Bill was
rejected.
R. MURE brought in a Bill about Scotch herrings, but whether it
was to give them the franchise, or allow them to marry their wives’
sisters, or to compel, them to be vaccinated compulsorily, Mr. Punch
could not hear. But this he will say, that a fish so uncommonly good
as the article irreverently called in Glasgow a “magistrate” deserves
the best attention of the legislature and of the epicure.

cast a doubt upon the right of the North to hang persons º: in
privateering, it would be as well for persons to keep out of it, as, if
caught, they would assuredly be hanged at once, and have their rights
debated afterwards. - -
In the Commons, MR. M'Evoy, of Meath, complained of havin
been turned out of a Committee-room by MR. Bagwell, of Clonmell.
This important subject having been ventilated, and two Judges having
brought down PRINcess Alice's Dowry Bill, from the Lords, the
Battle of the Budget was resumed, and raged all night, with more or
less smartness, and was ended by a couple of speeches from the
Leaders, LoRD PALMERston being very merry, and declaring that the
Budget was all right, and MR. DisRAELI being very sarcastic, and
declaring that the Ministers were straining the Constitution. He was
specially indignant with MR. Locke for saying that MR. Dish AELI had
own Sº STAfroRD Northcote as a little kite to ascertain the tempº
of the House. Once, more the Opposition “reserved, their right'
to do something dreadful hereafter, and the Budget Bill was read a
Second Time.
Friday. In the Lords, Government made some sort of excuse for not
handing over the Delhi Prize money—they had not got the right names
in, or some such stuff. This is really one of the Too-Bad cases. ..In
the Commons there was nothing done or said, except that a question
was raised which throws light upon two lines of Thomas Hood's that
must be Greek to the present generation:—
“Burn the breeks of meddling Vicars,
Picking holes in ANNA's urns.”
Once upon a time there was a vicar named BREEKs, who interfered
with a monument which a MRs. ANNE Somebody had erected to her
departed husband. The Bishop of Ripon (DR. Bickensteth, one
of his Lordship, the Minister of Religion's chief pets), has been
actually, it is said, removing a tombstone from Richmond Churchyard
because he disapproved of the inscription thereon, and the case º
BREEKs v. ANNA has been cited in connection with the affair. It is
not impossible that the Bishop may hear a little more upon the subject.
The Lords rose for the Whitsuntide Holidays, and the Commons
availed themselves of an Irish polemical squabble to get themselves

“WHAT IS A TACK ? "
Two long evenings last week were lost, on the above question, and
we can only say, that we were just as wise in the end as we were in the
beginning. After Hon. Members had tacked and tacked about for we
can't recollect how many hours, we were as far off from the truth as
ever. It wasn’t even in sight. Such legal navigation betrays great
ignorance of the coasts that our parliamentary colliers are anxious to
..explore. A First Lord of the Admiralty would do better. Our
answer, if the House had had the good sense to put the question to us,
would have been this: “A-Tack is, what a Tory excels in, especially
if a Chancellor of the Exchequer, like MR. GLADSTONE, is the object
to be fired at, though there are occasions when a Tory is just as clever
in defence as he is in a-tack. The plural of “a tack” is, we suppose,
Tax, but that is a talent of such an imposing nature, and one that is so
equally balanced between the two parties, that it is really difficult
to say whether the Whigs or Tories display the greatest cleverness
in it.”
We once heard a celebrated fishmonger say of an equally celebrated
author, “Sir, he’s a man of wery great talons, but not the slightest
tack.” So, that is precisely the verdict we should impartially pass on
the protracted debate of those two dreary evenings. We think that
the Tories on that occasion displayed an immensity of “talons,” but
not the slightest “Tack.” In fact, this same blessed “Tack” was
meant to have been a clencher, a regular dead hit, but it missed the
Government’s coffin in which it was intended to have been the last nail.
ºf. you will see the Tories will hammer away at it again for
all that

the House of Commons, on the subject of the Paper Duties and the
Budget, were so long that they converted every British newspaper

|RAE AMANTIUM.
“LoveRs' Quarrels re-solder Love,” saith the Latin, and, many
English are of the same opinion, despite BULweR, who singeth that:-
“Sorrow finds, and finds too late,
To wound us is to harden,
And Love is on the verge of Hate,
Each time it stoops for pardon.”
The loves of England and Prussia have been perturbed by the
unpleasant MACDoNALD affair, and high-placed Ministers have blown
one another up uncommon. But Frºmena won Wiscº has so
clearly proved that Prussia must be in the right, that we cannot resist
the pleasure of quoting from his address to the lower House. As the
Morning Advertiser would beautifully say, Aude halterum partin:—
“I cannot forget that Prussia has repeatedly exercised an influence highly
favourable to the growth of liberty in England. It was in consequence of the
urgent advice of the great ELECT or of BRANDENBURG that WILLIAM or ORANGE
undertook to protect the freedom and religion of England against the oppression
of the Stuarts. It was Brandenburg soldiers who enabled the Prince to leave for
England, by garrisoning Holland during the time of his absence; and it was Bran-
denburg dragoons who went over with WILLIAM, and made up for his great de-
ficiency in cavalry, which alone must have kept him at home. And this expedition
it is by which the liberties of Great Britain were firmly established. The Parlia-
mentary era of England dates from WILLIAM of ORANGE, who was no Englishman.
Then, again, we fought by the side of her in all the wars against Louis THE Four-
TEENth, and our troops were the active allies of the great MA. Leonorah. It is
superfluous to allude to Waterloo, and to the fact that WELLINGto.N would have been
routed but for the timely appearance of our gallant soldiers in the field. At the
very time when Lord John Russell, wrote his impertinent note upon the Mac-
| DoNALD affair, I, in this House, declared for siding with England in the great ques-
tions of European policy. I still abide by the opinion then expressed, but I feel it
incumbent upon me to couple it with the remark that, advisable as an English
allianco is to Prussia, a Prussian alliance is absolutely necessary for England. If
Lord PALMRRsroN–who is not worthy to unloose the shoes of the great PRINCE or
ORANGE–if Lord PALMERston, I say, recollects the tradition of Anglo-Prussian
alliance, and then casts a glance upon the present situation of Europe, he would do
well to perceive that this is a country combining the double advantage of legitimacy
and liberty."
These historical allegations so clearly prove that the Prussians were
right in accepting a lying charge against CAPTAIN MACDONALD, incasting
him into a filthy dungeon, in visiting him with a further punishment,
in supporting their legal functionary who designated English travellers
as “blac ds,” and finally, in proclaiming through the mouth of
their Minister that an English gentleman had “laid violent hands
on a lady,” the truth being that the lady's companion committed a
vulgar outrage on CAPTAIN MACDONALD-all these acts on the part of
the Prussians are so admirably vindicated by the queer historical sketch
offered by the Baron, that Mr. Punch hopes the controvers mº now
cease. ILLIAM OF ORANGE and WELLINGTON settle it all. It was
not “ º: to allude to Waterloo,” for the wreath of second-hand
laurel then won by Prussia receives a fresh leaf from her less dis-
putable victory over CAPTAIN MAcDoNALD.
ANOTHER OF HARPER TWELVETREES'S RECEIPTS.

MR. HARPER TwelveTREEs, Vermin-destroying powder manufac-
turer, patent washing-crystal inventor, &c., &c., having been requested
by numerous patrons to offer the public a receipt for rising in the
world, begs respectfully to º At a soirée recently given to him
by MR. WASHINGTUB Wilks, the Reverend MR. Snodhurst, MR.
GEORGE THOMPson, and some other of the most eminent men of the
age, MR. TwelyeTREEs had the pleasure of promulgating this receipt
verbatim, that is, by word of mouth. But as there may be some
persons in the world who were not at the soirée, MR. H. T. takes leave
to publish the receipt in question, and he assures the public that it will
be found fully as valuable as any of his other inventions:—
“MR. Twelvet Rees referred to the history of his life, and assured those who
were struggling to rise in the world that a man having the mainspring of religion
within him would rise upon the wings of industry and integrity. He was not
ashamed to say that he had blended religion with his business.”
N.B. MR. TwelvetREEs would add that the mainspring of religion
must be kept well lubricated with the oil of wide-awakishness, and
that in blending religion with business, care must be taken not to put
in too much of the former article, or the wings may not be found to
work. Cool the mixture with puffs from TwelvetREEs's Patent
Advertising Bellows.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DeAR PUNCH,
“ONE of the advantages pertaining to the erratic character
of this correspondence is the licence which enables me to change my
subject as befits the hour. Theoretically, too, I may be said to enjoy
a certain amount of *'. and you need never be *::::::: when I
hail at short intervals, from widely remote quarters. hat if I date
my letters one week from the summit of St. Bernard and the next from
the interior of the Thames Tunnel? Even the sticklers for the
“ Unities of the Drama” must relax their, dogmas in favour of steam
and telegrams. So, if on my journey to the Eternal City, I turn back
to look in at Trafalgar Square, you will be prepared for the retro-
sion. True the fountain of Trevi is a more picturesque object
than the clumsy syringes behind the Nelson Column, and it is some-
what a shock to look at poor HAveLock's statue after gazing on the
chef d'oeuvres of PHIDIAs, but the plain truth of the matter is, the
Royal Academy has just opened its doors for the ninety-third time to
the British public, and if in Rome I have done as the Romans do,
to-day in our own dear Metropolis I followed the example of most
Londoners and rushed to the Exhibition.
“The time-honoured pent-house at the entrance, containing the two
traditional British Grenadiers, showed me that the late alterations had
not affected the exterior of the building, though I soon found from the
altered condition of the staircase that steps had been taken towards
an improvement inside, while the additional room for sculpture has
confessedly given the present a great haul over former Exhibitions.
“Having fired off these two beautiful puns (which, you see, I try to
bring in as if by accident, and not as if I had lain awake half last night
to make them)—having discharged, I say, these tremendous jokes, I
will proceed to tell you to the best of my humble ability what I saw
in the East Room.
“No. 7. Pharaoh's Daughter, by MR. ARMITAGE, is an Egyptian
woman's head, the principal feature of whose coiffure appears to be
the body of a stuffed peacock, which is far more becoming to her
Oriental features than the bird of Paradise and cock pheasant with
which our modern dames have crowned their hats and turbans. If
there be authority (as no doubt there is) for the former, it is curious
to think that in three thousand years the fashions have altered so little.
A bird in the hand, we know, is worth two in the bush—how much a
bird on the head costs, I must leave Paterfamilias to settle.
“Next to SIR J. W. GoRDQN's portrait (painted with his usual
ability) of MR. JAMEs SMITH, is No. 10, Dawn-Luther at Erfurt. The
subject is treated originally, and very carefully painted. Here is no
striving to enlist the sympathies of Exeter Hall-no rampant Protes-
tantism. LUTHER's head, whether portrait or ideal, is well studied,
and there is more than ordinary significance in the grey morning light
which is beginning to illumine that pale and earnest face,
“MR. Lee exhibits a 3. * (16) of the Signal Station, Gibraltar,
from the rocks near Breakneck Stairs (and very break neck they look).
Portions of the picture are very finely touched in, but if Gibraltar is as
cool as this picture suggests, the lizards must suffer severely from
influenza.
“MR. FRosT tells us that Venus lamented the absence of Adonis—
a melancholy fact which has often been brought under our notice
before. For my part I am inclined to doubt the endurance of her
grief. No doubt she was once attached to the young man (for whose
sake, as DR. LEMPRIERE assures us, she temporarily abandoned
Olympus) but we find her at no distant period from this event flirting
with Anchises, and there is no doubt now, I think, that she was a great
jilt, and that when Mesdames Juno and Minerva met over their cup of
nectar, they were quite right in their version of that little affair on Mount
Ida. So we won't believe that the Paphian goddess broke her heart, and
any one who looks at No. 23, will I am sure concur with me in thinking
that such an extremely attractive young person soon found other ad-
mirers, and that Master Cupid there by her side did not keep his bow
unstrung very long.
“A little picture (25) by MR, CARY shows what can be made of a
homely subject. Some children and an old man are gathered round
the ‘village well' to gossip... An old pitcher (which in spite of the
roverb, has evidently f. often to the well without being broken)
ies by in the grass. The children appear interesting and interested
saye one little girl, who by her apathy seems wishing to leave well alone.
“MR. SANT's portrait (41) of a young gentleman in knickerbockers
and scarlet stockings is very successful in colour, but why put a bo
just entering his 'teens in the conventionally heroic attitude, whic
M.P.s and Aldermen adopt in their testimonial portraits, viz., leaning
on one hand and placing the other in the region of the waistcoat?
“44. Early Sorrow is here typified by the mock funeral of a ‘dickey
bird” conducted by children, who play the parts of mutes (a practice
which I shall earnestly recommend to my noisy nephew ToM) and
mourners exceedingly well. The father (a shoemaker) looks round
from his work amused, and outside the cottage-door a little boy-sexton
is digging a tiny grave. . It is a taking subject with young folks; but
perhaps a little too theatrical in treatment.
“49. St. Elizabeth of Hungary distributing Alms to the Poor. The
author is Professor of Painting to the Royal Academy, and being so, it
would ill become a humble individual like myself to pass criticism on
this picture. The subject should make it a tender one; but though
A. HART is the painter, I cannot for the life of me see much heart
about it.
“Mischievous Models is the title given to a cheerful little picture,
representing a dog and kitten playing with the palette and ‘properties
of an artist. Perhaps this is the identical cat who having been let out
of the bag has got into a helmet. The puppy, imitating as other
puppies do, the habits of his master, and having seen his pause over the
convass, claps its own, paws over the palette; and to use a familiar
expression, 18 ºft old Harry with the colours.
* Passing cheerfully over MR. StANFIELD's clever work. The Capture
ſ Smuggled Goods in the old Antrim Road, to which the highest praise
can give is to say that it is STANFIELD's,. I come to MR., PHILIP's
Gossips at a Well (66), one of the many episodes in Spanish hunible
life which the artist has made familiar to us. What need to particu:
larise the pretty brunette and the roguish muleteer, the gaily-trapped
donkey, or the road-side shrine. Spain shares with Italy a rich mine
of picturesque material, and as often as MR. PHILIP comes home,
these are the sort of treasures he brings with him. -
“Qf course one could only expect, a full-length portrait from the
pencil of MR. LoNG. The likeness which he has painted (86) seems
that of an honest country gentleman who has, had the good taste to
appear for the occasion in knickerbockers, the only portion of our
modern English dress which unites comfort with picturesqueness.
“Comparisons are invidious; but as 84 appears hung as a pendant
to 94, one cannot help for once contrasting the rich, colouring and un-
conventional treatment of the latter portrait with the pure modernism
and cold touch of the first. Whoever does so, must award, I think,
the palm to MRs. WELLs, despite the scornful expression of her Bella
Veneziana.
“What shall I say of MR. Dyce's exquisite landscape (98)
“Sweet day, so calm, so cool, so bright,
The bridal of the earth and sky;
The dews shall weep thy fall to-night,
For thou must die.”
How can I describe the picture better than by quoting, these lines?
How better realise the beauty of the poem than by looking at that
canvass? It is the perfection of quiet, earnest nature-reading: unaſ.
fectedly simple—wonderfully accurate without obtrusion of detail—a
pastoral poem in itself. The stream flows on in easy rhythm, the trees
are nodding to the cadence of the verse, and there stands good GeoRGE
HERBERT, at once the key-note and the author of the song. .
“Are there any who sneer at that formal cassock, or reject the
quaint significance of that uplifted hand? Let them turn then to
look at Nature's fashion-book, and remember that the same pattern:
which delight us now, old Isaac WALTON, at the river-side, approved
200 years ago. -
“ll0. Is MR, ELMORE tempted by his great success last i. to
keep us still sighing over Marie Antoinettef The poor Queen's features
are not less interesting than in his former picture, and the incident
chosen is a good one; but I hope he will select another heroine in 1862.
"118. Nothing can be more natural than for MR. Hook to go in for
fishing subjects, and nothing more natural than the way, in which he
paints them. The bluff hardy Cornishman, his chubby children, that
sea-green freshness, which he has made his own, are enough to make
poor cockneys sigh for summer, and all the beauties of a sou’-west coast.
“126. MR. Cope's Convalescent seems hardly well enough to eat
oranges, but one can excuse such apparent indiscretion for the sake of
the pretty accident of colour the orange creates—the only accident I
hope which may befal Mamma's pet for many years to come, >
**How did she do it?” “What's the secret?'." Where’s the strap?
exclaim a dozen voices as I push my way politely up to SiR EPWIN
LANDseeR's picture (135), and see depicted a young lady reclining
triumphantly by the side of a lately restive but now subdued and
obedient filly. - -
“Ah, my dear Mr. Punch, when you have seen the portrait of this
horsetamer, you will not ask such senseless questions, I remember
an old Greek Epigram in which Minerva seeing a statue of Wenus
armed, asks what tº: she has with implements of war—she who
can vanquish ever so many Argives with her glance alone.
* And so I say, what is the use of a whip in those fair hands? Where
is the brute who requires a strap to hold him near her? Horse-taming
indeed!—who but an ass could resist such influence f

A SIMILARITY WITH A WERY GREAT DIFFERENCE.
The QUEEN has recently been sojourning at, the White, Lodge,
Richmond. The usual place of habitation of the President of the
United States is, as our readers know, the White House, Washington.
Though the two abodes have a similarity of sound in their names, how

inhabit them ' . In the White Lodge, there is comfort, ease, repose,
PROTESTANTS UNDER PROTEST.
In the Aberdeen Herald of the 11th, instant, a Correspondent from
this city mentions, among other highly interesting matters, that at
“the future home of the PRINCEss ALICE,” which our loyal readers
are of course aware is Hesse-Darmstadt,
“There is a large theatre, where operas are very well done, far better than at
Frankfort, a much more important place. The ballet is an object of great care,
under an Italian ballet-master. I saw Norna and Giselle exceedingly well -
formed, and, Protestants although they be, the great attractions are always given
on Sunday evenings."
The latter of these sentences is rather loosely written; but really
the writer “doth protest too much,” we think, if he means to state
that Norma and Giselle are Protestants. Connoisseurs in music v
often boast of being Catholic in taste, but we never heard one º:
about an opera as Protestant. The performances at certain of our
Puseyite conventicles certainly smack somewhat of an operatic form,
and are the nearest approach to a Protestant opera with which we
have as yet, in England, been acquainted. Even these, however, are
more Catholic than Protestant; and so we are not much helped out
of our perplexity., Norma, to our mind, is more. Druidical than
Protestant; and what are the peculiar, tenets of Giselle we leave to
MR. SPURGEON, or any other enemy of dancing, to suggest.
NUISANCES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION.
1. The necessity of leaving your stick or umbrella, and, on a wet
day, owing to the insufficient number of attendants, having to wait a
uarter of an hour, at your entrance and departure, before you can
eliver your property up, or have it returned to you... Note—The
monstrous, inconvenience inflicted on the majority of the public by
about one fool in a million, who would poke a cane through a picture.
2. The habit of stupid people, especially ladies in the midst of im-
mense muslin, getting close to the pictures, so that those who want to
examine them at a proper distance, can never see them at all.

OUR NATIONAL DEFENDERS.
(A Confidential Letter addressed to Admiral Punch.)

a yarn to spin about our
training ships, and as I
chiefly want to say my say
to shores' men, I must sink
the sailor in the scribbler for
this cruise.
“The fact, is, my dear
Punch, that I’ve just passed
a couple of days on board
HER MAJesty's Ship Ercel.
sior (more familiarly chris-
tened, from her mooring-
F. the Mudlark), and
ence came this explosion
of nautical expressions, on
which my brains have recently been most absurdly bent. For, Cockney that I am, I armed
myself at starting with a mouthful of sea-slang, and went through a course of MARRIOTT's
novels and fine old nautical dramas to prepare my tongue and ears for the talk that I antici-
pated. But sailors aboard ship don't converse at all like those upon the stage : and as for
shivering their timbers and blessing their dear eyes, one might as well expect to hear them
chaffing you in Sanscrit, or swearing in High Dutch. Time was, or may have been, when
JAck spun yarns to messmates in the jargon of sea-novels, and when Captains gave their
orders always with an oath. But this foul-mouthed age is past, and our young officers are
gentlemen, which is more than can be said of some of the old salts. -
“Mind, I don't mean to allege that swearing is extinct; though from the lips of a ‘blue-
jacket' it somehow sounds, I think, considerably more harmless than from most. But as a
rule now, naval officers, like other gentlemen, abstain from it, and in time their good example
will extend among their men. I found a dozen or so youngsters on board of the Eccelsior,
and neither in their board-room nor while at night ashore with them, did I once catch a coarse
expression, or hear a song or * that would cause a sister's blush. Without attaching to
this fact more weight than is its due, of how many Army mess-rooms could one say as much?

£cause his hands, maybe, are not so, white as are a Guardsman's, I have heard a naval

converse, I cannot well admit that the epithet is just. - -
“As Sherrysmouth is now within a morning's ride from town, I should advise my blasé

they reach her by two bells (which they will learn is one o'clock), they will hear the beat to
quarters, and see, somewhat of the bustle that goes on in real action. Used up though they
be, and deadened to excitement, I, think when they get between decks they will feel their
; quickened. Somebody or other asks, in some old song or other I remember somewhere
earing-
“Who ever saw a gallant sight,
That never viewed a brave Sca Fight?"
I dare say the poet's right; but as sea-fights are not included in our public exhibitions, I
fancy few of us will ever enjoy the chance of seeing one. I own I have long longed to behold
a naval action—a regular three-decker blaze-and sink affair, such as one finds in Midshipman
Easy, Peter Simple, and Ben Brace, or in the Lives of glorious heroes like our NELsoN and
our Collingwood. But, besides the fact of none such having hº in my time, there is
the fact that no safe place has been invented yet for seeing it. To go up in a balloon, and
see a sea engagement, was for many years the height of my boyish aspirations; and though
to my maturer mind there seems somewhat of cowardice in playing QEsaR to the conflict
and calmly looking down upon the gladiators fighting, I must own, if the chance offered, f
think that I should grab at it. - -
... “But though one can't well hope to get a bird's-eye view of an engagement (without the
risk of .# the fate of poor Cock Robin), one may by visiting the Excelsior get somewhat
of a notion of what it is to be in one. The b -
handspikes and the rumble of the gun-wheels, bring somewhat of confusion to the untrained
kney, brain... It must require no little discipline to keep order in such bustle; and one
j well conceive how much more must be needed, when the guns belch forth their thunder,
. * tear up the deck, and the air is thick with smoke and well nigh filled with flying
Splinters.
“The quickness and Fº with which the guns are worked, to use a Yankee phrase, is
certainly a ‘caution.' I think an enemy would hesitate before declaring war, if he saw how
smart we are in banging of a broadside. To cast loose a big, gun, and fire four rounds in
seven minutes, each shot at a changed distance, and at more than half a mile, for the third
round shifting breeching, and each shot scoring as a hit, is nowadays considered far from
first-rate practice, and such as would by no means be commended by a CHADs. (Twenty

ANOTHER LITERARY PENSION
WANTED.
WHAT is a “Scribbler?” Johnson says, a
“petty author;” and, as a harsher synonym, tells
us a “bad writer.” With this before our eyes
we are not so much surprised as we might other-
wise have been at seeing in the Gazette of Friday,
May 10th, among the list of bankrupts, a gentle.
man whose name there is no need for us to men-
tion, but who for his trade or calling terms him-
self a “scribbler.”
. As this unhappy “scribbler” is bankrupt in
his pocket now as well as in his wits, we should
advise him, to put in a claim for Government
assistance, basing his pretensions, on the mere
fact of his “scribbling,” which places him of
course “in the same category with BURNs.”
Bad writer though he be, he cannot well be worse
than the poet Close, to whom a pension has
“for literary merit” just been given. We are
inclined indeed to wager that the bankrupt is a
more deserving claimant than the poet; for in
calling himself a “scribbler” he at least shows
he has modesty, in which good quality the other
scribbler clearly is deficient.

EMIGRANTS AND REMIGRANTS,
The Northern Whig records that Emigrants from Ireland are leaving the Dis-United States
for their own Green Isle in great numbers. This may well surprise us, considering Paddy's
love of a row, and the rich prospects that the Model Republic just now holds out in that
respect... But even more extraordinary than the remigration itself is a consequence of the
remigration stated in the same article, viz.:-
“That the extermination of the Irish labourer had doubled the price of pigs."
. That Pat has found himself in a pickle in the Airthly Paradise, his return to Ould Ireland
is some proof: that he may have thought his prospect of saving his bacon better, in Ireland
than in the States, as things now stand, is quite possible. But why pigs should double in
|. as Paddies disappear, is a problem we must own ourselves unable to solve. Can it
e that Pat in the new world is ever slaughtered and salted down as a substitute for the pig
which in the old world he used to be content with fattening? Perhaps the concatenation
of ideas may be, that as Pat took his pigs to a bad market, when he emigrated across the
Atlantic, the market is getting better, now Pat is taking his pigs back again.
THE GROAN OF A TRUE

(Who hates everything un-English.)
AND have I lived to see the da
That two such things could be!
Fade, England's glory, fade away-
Come France, and rule the sea!
. Of all the holds where Britons most,
To hold their own might claim,
Methinks the public-dinner chair,
And theatre, I’d name !
I deemed our SHAKSPEARE as our coasts
From Frenchman's touch secure;
That Frenchman giving British toasts,
No Briton could endure;
But here this Fechter-all the go–
Hamlet to act doth dare:
At the Freemason's Tavern, lo!
D'AUMALE doth take the chair.
Of all un-English things I’m doomed
In these sad times to mourn;
I know no two which move me through
Such depths of wrath and scorn.
Let Britons on a British stage
Still spout and strut and stare,
And British Royal Dukes engage
The British dinner-chair!
What wretched foreigner e'er rose
To British notions true, .
Of duties, which these tasks impose
Upon a man to do?
See FECHTER’s Hamlet with a mop
Of flowing flaxen hair,
And not the raven Brutus cro
That KEMBLE used to wear
The dear conventions all are dºped,
The ancient points are marred!
Old starts are tained, old crossings stopped;
And old traditions barred
'Tis Hamlet such as SHAKESPEARE's words
And simple study show,
Not the creation of the boards,
Of KEMBLE, KEAN, and Co.'ſ
And so of this French Royal Duke,
Who dares to take the chair,
Where CAMBRIDGE once was wont to look
So large and debonair;
He stoops to talk both wit and sense,
And common-place to shun-
As if such things had e'er been known
Since public feeds begun

THE LISPING TRIBES.
At the last meeting of the Ethnological Society, after a paper about the natives of Western
Equatorial Africa had been read by M. Du Qhailºu, the mighty hunter of gorillas, between
whom and some of their human neighbours the principal distinction seems to consist in the
circumstance that the latter are cannibals, there ensued a discussion, in the course whereof
the Chairman, MR, CRAwfurd, “in reference to the inability of the Bakalai tribe to pro-
nounce the letter ‘r,” which they sound like an ‘l,' observed that the Chinese, have the
same defective utterance, which excites a disgusting feeling when they speak of eating rice.”
The Chinese, in fact, when they attempt to say “rice,” lisp, and at the same time appear to
speak disagreeably plain. When we consider how large a number of youthful swells, of the
most tumefied immensity, partake in the inability of the Bakalais, and the Chinese to pro-
nounce the letter “r,” we cannot but rejoice to think that they do not mispronounce that
consonant in, the same dreadful, manner as those barbarians; so that, although they cannot
say “rice” like ordinary Englishmen, they do not turn that word into the one whereinto
it is transformed, by Chinamen; , but make
nothing worse of it than “wice,” which is mere
nonsense, and disgusting only inasmuch as it is
the utterance of imbecility.
CLOSE'S GUSH OF GRATITUDE.
N.B. THE following poem has been sent to
Mr. Punch with the statement that it is the
thank-offering of MR. Close to Lord PALMER-
ston for the £50 per annum. Mr. Punch doubts
its genuineness, from its being so very much
better than anything MR. Close has yet pub-
lished, but it is otherwise much in that poet's
way:-
For this kind pension thou hast gave,
All thanks to thee, great PAM,
I am your most obedient slave,
Upon my soul I am.
I sang the praise of Bonny's King,
Benighted Afric's chief;
But if you like I’ll change my strain,
And call that black a thief.
What, fifty pounds a year for me,
That’s nigh a pound a week,
O Lord, I never shall contrive
My gratitude to speak!
If I can serve in any way
Yourself, my liberal Lord,
Believe me, Sir, by night or day,
You’ve only got to say the word.
Meantime upon my bended knees
I pray in fervent tone,
That gracious Heaven will always please
To bless Wiscount PALMERston.
He stuck me up amid haughty bards,
And men of art and science,
And thus my modesty rewards,
And sets them all at defiance.
And though I was a butcher low,
For humble craft designed
Pothooks and hangers now shallflow,
In verse of every kind.
The man that will not honour me
Shall surely have a dose,
l’ll physic him uncommonly,
As sure as my name’s Close.
But on the good LoRD PALMERSTON,
Our excellent Premeer,
I’ll never hurl a fiery blast,
Or speak at all severe.
For he is as good as he is great,
And when he comes to die,
I only hope that we shall both meet
In yon purpureous sky.
Till then I'll always sing his praise,
That I’ve determined on;
And truly proud I am to hear
His name, like mine, is JoHN.

NAUTICAL DESTITUTION.
Not every indigent aged British sailor, suffering from wounds sus-
tained in his country's service, is entitled to a pension or a berth in
Greenwich Hospital; consequently, many meritorious old tars have no
other refuge than the workhouse, which they are too high-spirited to
enter whilst they can earn, the smallest livelihood. On the Tyne, for
example, they act as scullermen and watermen, capacities in which
they have to compete with ºf: and safer men; so that what living
they get is the barest possible. To supply the shortcomings of public
justice, not to say generosity, towards these superannuated servants of
their country, an institution has been founded under the name of
“The Tyne Aged Sailors' and Scullermen's Asylum.” The honorary
secretary to this projected, charity, in a letter to a contemporary, makes
the following statement, illustrative of the misery of the ancient heroes
whom it is intended to accommodate:—
“To prove their destitute condition, I may state that one of their number, a few
months ago, died in the act of landing a passenger; and upon a post-mortem exami-
nation being made, it was found that the poor man (he was upwards of 80 years old)
had actually died for want of the common necessaries of life. I quote the exact
words of the verdict, returned upon an inquest being held.”
M. Du CHAILLU tells us that the Fans of Equatorial Africa are
accustomed to eat the corpses of even those of their own people who
have died of disease. The worst of cannibals, however, would turn
from the repast offered by the carcase of a lean and tough fellow-
creature. It is, therefore, unlikely that the Fans would suffer even
the most worthless member of their society to be starved to death.
The nation which allows its defenders to perish for want of the common
necessaries of life, and then abandons their emaciated bodies to the
worms, may be more refined, but is it more righteous, than a tribe
which eats the dead, indeed but for that very reason fattens the living f
The Tyne Aged Šion; and Scullermen's Asylum has a claim not
only on the consideration of the benevolent, but also on that of those
who are chiefly actuated by the instinct of self-preservation. The
safety of England from invasion depends upon her maritime strength;
and the fewer sailors,there are famishing, or actually starved to death,
the less difficulty will perhaps be experienced in manning the Navy.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAY 33. Thursday. Mr. Punch has the greatest pleasure in saying
that Parliament is perfectly alive to the fact that there is a much more
pleasant way of spending fine .. than in ridiculous debates... A
small House of Commons re-assembled, after Whitsuntide, on this
Thursday, and talked about the Navy, as any topic connected with sea-
breezes and blue water is agreeable just now, and LoRD PALMERSTON
made what MR. BRIGHT called a “Rule Britannia Speech.” The next
night the SPEAKER could not catch more than 34 Members in his hat,
so he let them all go . Dundee still first favourite, Diophantus
second; PATTI ºf: armingly, and GRISI enthusiastically received.
Neapolitan ices not liked so well as the original kind. Floral Hall

THERE appears to exist some idea that the QUEEN's Procla-
mation, warning all British subjects against taking part in the
atrocious war now raging between the Northern and Southern States
of America was something more than a necessary formality. A º
|. is actually expressed that English sailors, for example, might
tempted to engage in this abominable contest on either side, and
that as pirates under the name of privateers; thus not only cutting
the throats of Americans for hire, but also butchering each other.
Surely our community contains too few miscreants to render it at
all probable that the belligerents would ever include any considerable
number of HER MAJESTY's subjects. There cannot be amongst us a
sufficiency of THURTELLs, BURKEs, HAREs, BISHOPs, WILLIAMSEs,
GREENACREs, RUSHEs, PALMERs, MULLINses.

South, will leave their country for their country's good. It is to be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FAIR PLAY FOR PHOTOGRAPHY.
s' reing what they
weekly have
before them in
our pages, it
is needless to
remind our
innumerable
readers that
Art in any
shape or form
is ever under
the protection
and the patron-
age of Punch,
From the pic-
tures “on the
line * at the
R. A. Exhibi-
tion, to the
Crayon carica-
tures which
are covertly
designed on
Mr. Panch’s
doorsteps, and
- - - where with
small artists decorate his newly-painted shutters, all works of Art are
cherished and encouraged by his influence, and the interests of artists
are watched over and secured.
Now, Mr. Punch has learned from certain of his photographic friends,
including his friend, FREDERICK, Lord Chief Baron of England, that
HER MAJESTY's Commissioners for next year's Great Exhibition have
thought fit to pass an insult upon Photographic Art, by classing its
productions with railway plant and en-tools, small arms and
ships' tackle, big guns, and new omnibuses, donkey-carts and corn-
extractors, and the thousand other, articles of mechanical apparatus
comprised in Section II. The Lord Chief Baron, as the mouthpiece
# * Photographic Council, has pointed out to the Commissioners
a
* In the observations of natural scenery and in the selection of what shall be
represented with reference to the effect of light and shade, and from what point of
view, in the grouping and arranging of the principal or accessory objects for the
purpose of forming a picture, photography is no doubt an art, an imitative art; but
the Council of the Photographic Society claim for it a position, however humble,
jº the fine arts, if etching and engraving may be so placed, as no doubt justly
ey may.
In other words, that is, they claim for Photographs a place among
the articles, admitted, under Section IV., which, under the expansive
head of “Modern Fine Arts,” includes architecture, models, die:
sinking, and engravings, in fact (except photographs) anything and
everything in any way artistic, from the cast for a new halfpenny and
the designs for Guards' Memorials, up to paintings by a MILLAIs and
drawings by a PUNCH! -
..In summing up the case against HER MAJESTY's Commissioners, the
Lord Chief Baron states the grievance of the Photographic plaintiffs
in language which, if forcible, is clearly not unfair:-
“The Photographic Society has been founded chiefly with a view to promote
photography in connection with science and the fine arts, and the members interest
themselves about pho phic apparatus in the same manner only as a RAPHAEL
or a REYNoLDs might select and use the most convenient easel, the best brushes, or
the most appropriate and enduring colours...The instrument is comparatively
nothing... * * * They do not complain that the apparatus they use is put amon
all the other apparatus; but they do complain that results such as have exhi-
bited for many years by the Society, and have been honoured by the presence and
encouragement of HER MAJESTY and H. R. H. THE PRINCE Consort, are deemed
worthy of no better place than among tools and mechanical devices of whatever
merit; and they would appeal to the Royal and illustrious patrons of their body to
be rescued from the comparative degradation of being mixed up with the last
improvement in ploughs or cart-wheels or ships' tackle.”
This appeal, Mr. Panch, in his Royal pleasure, is pleased graciously
to back; and when His wishes are made known to the Commissioners,
there will be little need of other "Royal Patrons” to bestir them.
º: as His remonstrance will, of course, suffice to set the matter

“All's Well that Ends Well.”
Not many years back, a certain HAMLET lost a fortune in the
Princess's Theatre by building it.
At the present day, the fortune of the Princess's Theatre is (thanks
to MR. FechTER, who, like a true CELLINI of his art, adorns every-
thing he touches) being made by another Hamlet. It would seem as
though it had been written down in the Book of Fate that it was to be
the lucky destiny of the one Hamlet to pick up the fortune that had
been lost by the other.
PUNCH'S PROPHECY FOR THE DERBY.
PROPHESY, my bloaters, of course I'll prophesy for you if you like, and you are
wise in coming to me, for when did your beloved Old Punch ever lead you by the
hignis fatuous ºf imbecility into the quagmire of impecuniosity? Hi, NELLY, ho,
NELLY, hearken unto me; I'll sing to you, I'll tell to you, what oss will win the D.
Well, there's Dundee. What shall I say about that noble and merry animal?
Dundee marmalade is uncommon nice, and GRAHAM, of Claverhouse, was a very
distinguished party. Fill up your cup and fill up your can, when they saddle the
horses, put on like a man, the racer will prove himself fearless and free, who stays
at the finish with bonnie Dundee. We can't be rhyming and chiming for ever, my
bloaters, so here goes again for “spoken." There's Diophantus, a Greek name I'm
gave to understand, and perhaps there may be Greeks not a hundred miles from
Epsom on Wednesday; they've a right to be there if they like, I suppose, Epsom
Downs are free to all HER MAJESTY's subjects, and so are Epsom Salts. But
Diophantus rhymes to plant us, or I've mislaid my hearty poetica. Then there's
the Red Dragon, touching which the only revelations I shall make are, that he'd
better take the drag off if he means his number to be re(a)d. Dictator is to my
mind a speckttatur, and yet if I should be spectator of his winning, I shouldn't be
mealy mouthed in saying he was a good oss, and I hope he'll have a mash. As for
the French oss, Royallieu, in which Royal Loo himself is said to take an interest,
there's no royal road to learning or the winning post, but L. N. himself took an
uncommonly short cut to the sign of the Crown Inn one cold morning, and what's
the odds so long as you're a Nappy? Kettledrum's godfathers and godmother were
bold sponsors, seeing that a kettledrum is meant to be beat, but if Polly puts that
kettle on nicely, we may all have tea with silver spoons in it, and wouldn't that be
a pretty kettle of fish, my bloaters? Hush-a-bye, baby, your cradle is green,
father's a nobleman, mother's a queen, sister's a lady and wears a gold ring,
brother's a Drummer, and drums for the king. But now we behold Kildonan. Far
be it from me to disparage anything that sounds Irish, I'm no disparager,
though liking asparagus, and this kill may be a cure; who can ever say anything
positive about Hibernia except that it is Latin for Ireland, and that PHILIP, you
know, is proud Hibernia's king : “He his.” Let us next clear off Klarikoff, and
when this Russian's a rushin' ahead, I don't say knout, but you look out, iss Czar,
as the niggers say. There are steppes in Russia, and there are steps up St. Paul's,
lay that unction to your soles, my bloaters. Atherstone is a oss of the same name as
my friend the SolicroR-GENERAL, only different, and I hope won't turn out what I
am quite sure my friend the ArroRNEY-GENERAL never calls (or thinks) his neigh-
bour, namely, a bad second. Drake may or may not be a duck, or if you like to look
on him in the light of the celebrated Admiral, he may or may not be the Admiral
CRICHToN, which run through all knowledge, and then was run through himself,
but as for this oss's running, if a drake carried a feather-weight, eh, twigº Then
for Aurelian, or hoary lion as they call him in the north, well, he rhymes to corne-
lian, and yet I'm far from saying he'd better be cut. I have no idea “who taught
the little Nautilus to sail,” but I have reason to think that he will be a very good
cock-boat. If I am asked of Bombadier, my answer you are free to hear, that
some will think it very queer, if that oss gets uncommon near, but something
whispers in my ear that BoMBA run, and so do Deer. The remaining oss in
the favourite list is Imaus, or as my friend the Wiscount anti-classically calls
him, Imaws. "I am gave to understand that he takes his name from a mounting
in Scythia, where scythes was invented, whereby he ought to be able to cut
along, and I am partial to classic osses, because they remind me of PAM and his
Eleusinian—or did he say Isthmian?—little games. As for Imaus, I may as well say
that if the mounting won't come to the Prophet, your Prophet must come to the
mounting, and he'll take it kind if any of you that sees him looking thirsty, and
has good champagne, and bawls out to him to prevent Destruction of Tissue.
Lastly, bloaters, there is a oss that I am myself nuts upon, and that oss's name
any of you may procure at No. 85, Fleet Street, at four o'clock in the afternoon
of Wednesday, the 29th instant, by mentioning my name, and asking in a polite
manner. Roo-ey-too-ey-too !

ITALY AND HUNGARY.
A PoeticAL idea occurred to Mr. Punch at the Crystal Palace
Concert last Friday afternoon, as he listened to the lovely Sull'aria
of Mozart, sung by GRISI the evergreen, and TITIENs the vigorous. As
they stood together there, with their sweet voices in accord, Mr.
Punch could but regard them as the vocal representatives of what
had been their birthplaces, Italy and Hungary. The sight appeared
to Mr. Punch as a foreshadowing of the time when those, two nations
will be linked together hand in hand, and pour forth their song of
triumph, exulting in their liberty. The parallel moreover was further
still borne out: for TITIENs the Hungarian acted as the handmaiden
of GRIs the Italian, and showed becoming deference to her elder
sister, by waiting for her movements and following her steps. With
the Derby week in prospect, and a host of country friends all clamour-
ing for his “tips,” }. Punch has no time, now to put his poetry into
rhyme; and must content himself with adding a hope that the united
voice of Italy and Hungary may be as much in harmony and as free
º: discord as the voices of their daughters were when warbling
OZART.
Fashionable Obstruction.
THE enormous amplitude which female dresses have attained to is
productive of peculiar inconvenience to pedestrians in haste, w -
through fields and lanes. . Owing to the present width of skirts, it
takes a little woman five minutes to get through a great gate.

“THE COOLIE EMIGRATION.”
THIs emigration, which is generally southward, has not yet com-
menced, though about August, doubtlessly, it will be in full force.
When we say that thousands have already promised to join the move-
ment, we certainly speak within bounds. The chief ports that the
Emigration is expected principally to bear upon are Brighton, Dover,
Folkstone, Hastings, Worthing, Eastbourne, Ramsgate, Broadstairs,
Scarborough, Whitby, Blackpool, Boulogne, Ostend, Dieppe, Tréport,
and innumerable others, for which we refer the emigrating reader to
the map. Of course, it is clearly understood that by “Coolie Emi-
gration” we mean the exodus that yearly takes place from all large
suffocating towns on the part of all persons who are panting for a
mouthful of cool air. Should this hot weather continue, the Emigra-
tion will take place this year much earlier than usual. In fact, we
know several ladies, whose great maternal anxiety is the best excuse
for their burning eagerness, have already made preparations. On more
occasions than one, they have Fº told their husbands that “the
Doctor has recommended the poor children change of air.” As yet,
their overtures have not met with the smallest encore.
The Advantage of Stuttering.
A Young author (we will not mention names) has the lining of his
hat completely blackened with ink. The wonder was how the spots
could have got there, because authors do not generally carry their
inkstands inside their hats, when a Wag present, who stuttered (and
if he hadn't, stuttered, he could not have made the #9 suggested

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE POPULAR THIRST FOR PLEASURE.
RINKING-Foun TAINs are
liberally represented at the
Academy this year. . With
the heat and the dust of
the room, they make one
uite thirsty to, look at
them: Besides, there is a
hot glare about the majority
of the pictures, the rays (or
R.A.s, shall we say?) of
which concentrate power-
ºf fully, as from a focus, upon
one, and dry up every dro
of moisture in your parche
body. It is arid work to
be exposed to a burning-
glass of Art for two or
three consecutive hours.
It is a small taste of the
Desert. without the smallest
hope of finding an oasis in
it. There is plenty of water
around you, but not a drop
to drink. These water-pieces
bnly aggravate your torture,
putting you, painfully, in
mind of what Tantalus
must have suffered. STAN-
FIELD, Hook, LEE, LIN-
NRLI, Cooke, are for the moment so many mocking, wicked persecutors,
who taunt you with their beautiful imitations of nature. You allow
Drinking-Fountains—why not permit the introduction of a real
one?. A lady might faint away, and we doubt if there would be a glass
of water to be found in the place, to put to her lips, or dash in her face.
This is cruel, and even wicked, Messieurs Royal Academicians; for you
might be unconsciously the death of a beautiful Duchess, or of a lovely
Princess of the Royal blood. We beg to tell you that your beautiful
art, was given you to charm, the eye, to captivate the imagination,
and not to inflict cruelty on the palate. Your m cent creations
would not be damaged by a jº. of lemonade, or sixpennyworth of
* being sold down below, at the place where they take the sticks
and parasols; on the contrary, your admirers, once refreshed, would
return to your ºriº of the world once more, and
gaze on them with fresh delight.
We respectfully want to know : there should not be a Refresh-
ment Department at the Royal Academy? It is not a place where
you run in for merely five minutes, but it is a fashionable lounge,
where ladies Fº spend the entire afternoon... Art may be ver
beautiful, but Nature grows tired after admiring it a certain period,
and cries out for support...There is no use in your looking at pictures
º: § the most fastidious sense, if your own frame is exhausted,
e doubt if the most blooming bunch of grapes that was ever painted
by LANCE would revive a young lady who was faint with thirst.
Thereupon, it is out of pity for the sufferings of the fair sex, that we
beg of the Royal Academy to grant the establishment of a buffet where
they could procure a harmless restorative, if it were only a glass of
iced water; and if it would, also, kindly throw in a little beer for the
benefit of the gentlemen, who are sometimes subject to similar suffer.
ings, we should be doubly grateful, and, let the beer be ever so small,
we will never think of measuring the size of the favour by it. As it is,
if any one goes out for refreshment, a glass of beer costs him a shilling
above the usual price, since no one is admitted without repaying on
re-admission. In this way, we know a poor corpulent aldermanic old
fº. whom it cost on one occasion as much as half a sovereign.
t was a very hot afternoon, and he suffered so much that he had to go
out not less than ten times for refreshments It was too bad!
The above rule of repayment on readmission must be a most profit:
able source of additional revenue, to the Royal Academy, but we will
never meanly suppose that it is allowed one moment to weigh as the
É. * for not granting the establishment of a Refreshment
epartment, -
A Dark Inquiry.
Would the Herald's College be kind enough to inform us whether
* Black Monday,” that we so often hear spoken of is any relation to
the, “Man Friday” that was so attached to Robinson Crºtoeſ. Being
both of the same º may possibly bring, them within the pale
of such a probability? However, their dispositions are certainly very
different, for schoolboys, who, as a class, generally evince the greatest
love for the Man y, do not hesitate to express their profound
hatred for Black Monday!
OXFORD PRIZE POETRY.
UNDER the head of “University Intelligence,” it was announced
that, at Cambridge, the other day, an Extraordinary Congregation was
held for granting hono degrees, and for the public recitation of the
University prizes. The degrees having been conterred, in the presence
of the WICE CHANCELLOR and the Heir Apparent:—
“Next followed the recitation of the prises, the most interesting of which was,
of course, the English poem, The Prince of Wales at the Tomb of Washington,
Ms. My ERs read his com tion in a very creditable manner, for it is not always
that the best poet is the best reader. Several passages were loudly applauded, par-
ticularly the following:-
“Hail! flower of Europe, heir of malf the earth,
Descendant noble of a noble line I
Blest none from Heaven with so bright a birth
So fair a fate as thine.”
We'don't know what the PRINcs of WALEs thought of this poetry;
but if it had been addressed to his Royal. Grandfather, GeoRGE Tân
THIRD, we are afraid that the good old King would, in the language
of LoſſDByRon, have exclaimed—
“What, what I
PYE come again? No more, no more of that!"
“Hail! flower, of #W. Why flower of Europe? England is
not Europe; still less is Wales. With what propriety can the PRINCE
of WALEs be called a flower P Male and female flowers there are in
botany; but, in the modern language of compliment, flowers are always
female; for though an individual of the masculine gender is some-
times addr as “my tulip,” that form of address is a familiarity
bordering on contempt, and to apply it to the Heir Apparent would
be taking a gross liberty with his Royal Highness. , Wherefore is the
Prince invoked, in the face of facts, as “heir of half the earth” P
The º: transcends the sublime; and appears to have been
adapted, without improvement, from the parallel passage in Lord
#."
And half Northumberland belongs to me.”
. The rest is simply Prs; if it may not be said to stand towards pie
in the minor relation of tart; but it is too insipid for that. The
wonder is, first that the above lines are part of an Oxford Prize Poem
and next that they “were loudly applauded.” To relish them, Oxford
must be very fond of Prs. , We can onl º: that a competition
in English Poetry at Oxford is conducted on the principle of a donkey-
race wherein the hindmost, wins. This arrangement might tend to
encourage classical scholarship by rewarding negative proficiency in a
pursuit calculated to attract, attention from severer study: , Perhaps
it exists and has been devised to that end; therefore we will trust that
the author of the Prince of Wales at the Tomb of Washington is a
scholar of proportions inverse to, those which he exhibits as a poet;
and that his real distinction simply consists in being one of the first
men of his year.
SMALL CRUMBS OF COMFORT.
IN answer to a question from LoRD BERNERs, EARL, DE GREY said
that the reason why those who were entitled to the Delhi prize-money
had been kept out of their share for three years and a half, was because
the Government had been unable “to complete the rolls of accounts.”
This will be great comfort to the poor soldiers, to know that because
the rolls are not ready, they are to be kept out of their bread. In the
meantime, they may starve—Government cannot help it—the rolls
must not be hurried? We'little thought it took three years and a half
to make a roll—and it is not ready yet! We will conclude by putting
the following sum to the Indian ce:—“If it takes four years to
make a roll, how long will those who are entitled to the larger prizes,
such as a quartern loaf, have to wait?” In the art of "cooking
accounts,” Government sadly neglects the baking department.
The Just and Holy Cause of Slavery.
“We feel,” says PREsment JEFFERson Davis, in his *: to
the Secessio ngress, “that our cause is just and holy.” uld
not the negroes of the Southern States, if they rose against their
masters, say just as much, with at least equal justice, for their own
#...? The less Ms. Davis says about justice and holiness the
better, if he does not want to preach a dangerous doctrine, besides
being considered a humbug. “Dash holiness, and justice be blanked lº
is the consistent language for MR., JEFFERson DAVIs, "Might is
§: we expect to thrash the Northerners; and the Institution of
Slavery for ever!”

We notice that in the American army there is a GENERAL
BRAGG. Knowing, as we do, the charming licence of
speech that our good Yankee cousins allow themselves
when dwelling on their own private merits, we were not
much astonished to hear that so eminent an individual, held
so high a position amongst them. We should like to see
the General made Commander-in-Chief, for we are con-
fident that where BRAGG leads, all true-born Yankees
would be sure to follow. We have no doubt that BRAGG
is a good soldier, but we rather incline to the belief that,
of the two dogs of war, GENERAL HoldrasT would be a
much better one; and more especially would the services
of HolprAst be of value at the present moment, when the
entire Union is tumbling to pieces. In the meantime, we
beg to give our disunited relations over the water fair
warning that they will find civil war anything but an agree-
able game of BRAGG. It is a filthy game at which neither
side, can win, but, on the contrary, at which both sides
must inevitably lose.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
"DEAR PUNCH,
“I spoke in my last letter of an evening I had spent in seein
MR. and MRR. KEELEY and MR. T.P. Cooke, and others who recalle
the scenic pleasures of my schoolboyhood, and made me feel quite
Qung again, as they themselves indeed appeared. Eheu fugaces/
ow well do I remember my stoical self-denial at the tuck-shop many
a week, that I might have my couple of shillings for the theatre on |M
Saturday! For boys were not too proud then to go into the pit, and
when they went were not ashamed to look as if they liked it. Now-a-days
yºung gentlemen’ (one never hears of ‘schoolboys') think it snob.
bish to be seen at a theatre at all, except indeed it {. in private boxes
and white chokers. And when they condescend to go, just to "oblige
the girls,”, they seem to think it the right thing to try and look
intensely, bored, and as though the whole performance was quite
beneath their notice.
. "Now how can we account for this marked difference of demeanour
in the juvenile playgoer of times present and times past. The aetas
preterita, of which in person I can speak, does not amount to more
than a score or so of years, but the change in this small interval, I
think, is very great. Are our actors less attractive than they were a
brief time since, or have our schoolboys, sharper instincts to detect
stage imperfections, and be dissatisfied with what might formerly have
pleased?, Qr is it now thought fashionable to condemn the *f; and
speak lightly of the efforts which are there made to amuseus P. If so, it
may be schoolboys are but following the fashion, and when one sees them
yawning and sneering through a play, they are simply acting under the
mandates of Mammas. , I am inclined to think, however, that acting,
as a rule, is not so good as it was once, or at least has not advanced so
as to keep pace with the advancement of the times. The old performers
whom I saw recalled the other night are still without a rival in their
eculiar walks; and were a Dramatic Derby to be run for, º
§ FEchTER, as a foreigner, be scratched, I'll bet that some ol
favourite would win the public stakes.
“As good actors are rather rarde aves just at present, all well-wishers
to the stage must of course have grieved to hear of MR. Robson's
serious illness, which at one time seemed to threaten his permanent
withdrawal from a place where he has done so much to entertain us.
But I rejoice to hear that this is not now to be feared, and that ere
long the Chimney Corner will be played with its old cast. Meanwhile
R. HoRACE WIGAN has done his best to fill the part, which MR.
Robson will resume; and by way of novelty (at least at the º:
which is not a five-act theatre) the ever-green School for Scandal has
been once more planted out. As I happen to remember the Sir Peter
of old FARREN and the Joseph of MACREADy, I cannot say but what
there are to my mind some shortcomings in the Olympic cast; nor with
the NISBET's silvery laugh, still ringing in my ears, can I speak..of
Lady Teazle as she is seen at present without somewhat of a prejudice
to colour my remarks. Qdious as they may be, comparisons in some
cases are well nigh unavoidable; and when a man has found his beas
idéal of a character, he finds it hard to speak with fairness of those
who chance to differ from it. A critic cannot well help having recol.
lections, and they are apt to twist his judgment and restrain his praise.
But if Miss SEDGwick be not a perfect Lady Teazle, she is ºr. the
nearest to perfection now procurable; and old playgoers may find it an
interesting pastime to go and see her .. and note its chief short-
i. and then decide among themselves the exact width of
the gap.
“The sudden jump in the thermometer from freezing-point to sum-
mer heat, has set everybody talking of where they mean to next
August; and as affairs seem at present pretty peaceful on the Con-
tinent, Switzerland, of course, will be the place of chief resort. It is,
however, now, within the power of a Londoner to spend an hour or two
in Switzerland without the bother of getting there. Simply by securing

a stall at Covent Garden, one may leave one's dinner-table at eight
o'clock or so, and be comfortably sitting at Lucerne in half-an-hour.
The lovely lake that Mr. Bevealey has brought his moon to shine
upon, quite tempts me these hot nights to go and take a ‘header’ in
it: º the sweet airs of RossINI come as freshly from the stage as the
mountain air that seems to have suggested and inspired them. Nor is
Tell attractive only to the lovers of RossINI. Meyer BEER-admirers,
who have The Huguenots by heart, will, in the Gathering of the Can-
tons, find a parallel effect to the Blessing of the Poniards; while,
barring the grand climax of the jump out of the window, the delicious
vocal interview between Arnold and Mathilde is quite as heart-
touching as that between Valentine and Raoul. One who hears the
opera as Costa has produced it, can, but wonder at its being coldly
heard when first brought out; so coldly that its writer ever since, for
thirty years, has abstained from all stage-work. What have we not
lost by that teo hasty verdict, and how careful should a critic be in
uttering condemnation!
“But this is not a text that now-a-days needs preaching on. In
musical as well as in dramatic criticisms, very much more rose-water
is sprinkled now than vinegar. Thus writers get afraid of speaking
the plain truth, and actors, in their vanity, fancy themselves faultless.
The duty of a critic is to give judicious praise, and to point out imper-
fections with a view to their improvement. This is only possible where
critics are unbiassed; and to be this truly, they must keep themselves
unknown. Whether this, again, be possible while “Clubhouse Corre-
spondents’ have their ears at every keyhole, and have no consciences
to stop them from blabbing what they hear, is a problem for solution
by your faithful “ONE WHO PAys.”

spair of adding any grace to
this delicious production by

EA-BATHS AT FECAMP.
—Beginning of the Season on
the 1st of June. Among all water-
ing-places none could be put in
comparison to the fine and large
establishment of Fécamp, which
has been created by WATER Society.
There it is found the invaluable
advantage to have in the same esta-
blishment, Lodging-houses, Chalets,
Taverns, Dining Table for two hundred guests, a Casino, Hot Baths, Sea Baths, &c. &c.
At the Casino we find a Gymnasium, directed by a clever professor; Hot Baths
of sea water and of a drinkable one, with ordinary or Scotch Shower Baths—A
Breathing Hall for the sea-pulverised water. This is a good treatment for the
larynx sickness—a Pistol aiming–Billiard Halls, with all sorts of games-Reading
Rooms where all newspapers will be found–Drawing-rooms for the Pianoforte, with
a.distinguished professor specially engaged for the establishment—a Dancing-room,
as well as for Music—a Special Gallery for Festivals.
On every evening a Concert will take place in the greatest style. Twice in the
week Theatrical Plays. On Thursdays and Sundays Balls for children. On Satur-
days a Ball in brilliant fashion.
ith its good distributions, the Casino is admirably appropriated for the most
splendid festivals, as well as for the private meetings.
One has the faculty of consenting with the administrator a general subscription,
by means of which you have at the same time dining table, lodging, lighting, the
perfect enjoying of the Qasino, hot and the sea bathi, or showers, and even the
gratuitous cares of the doctor of the establishment. These subscriptions, it will be
easily conceived, have the result of half diminishing (comparatively to all of her
watering-places) the expense and trouble not to be with in a bathing season.
In this manner it is no more need of addressing oneself now to this one for lodging,
than to the other for dining, or bathing, or spending evenings, &c. &c.
Besides that, we find in this establishment all sorts of carriages to drive to
Etretat, as well as to the handsome valleys of Ganzeville and Walmont, where are to
be visited the majestic ruins of the antiquated Abbey and the Castle wherein one
may see the Bed-room of François I.

“WILL you please to use your irresistible power to put a
stop to a#.". which is now becoming extremely oppressive, to
persons afflicted with families? I mean the practice of Exhibiting
a. Single Picture, and charging to behold it the price of a whole
Exhibition.
“I would not so much care, if the owners of the picture did not
advertise obtrusively, so that there is no keeping the announcement
out of the sight of one's family. . But when, day after day, a woman
beholds a Picture advertised, she gets into her illogical head that
“everybody is talking about it,” .1% suppose I need not add that she
resolves to be able to talk about it also, nor what the result of a
woman's resolution is.
“Last Thursday, Sir, I, having a wife, two large daughters, and a
smallish boy, who cares much more for pegtops than pictures, but
whom my wife would not leave at home (and indeed she abused me
for snubbing him, though I had given him a sovereign the day before)

“Now, Sir, if you will let one of your young men multiply the above
sum by myself, wife, large daughters, and small son, he will find the
result to be thirty shillings. This, Sir, seems to me to be a good deal
of money to lay out for the purpose of enabling three females to talk
about seven pictures, to say nothing of about fifteen shillings more for
lunches and cabs. They could have done the whole Royal Academy

after the great race had been run, as the birds went circling beautifully
through the air.
“Yes, my boy,” said an oldster, who had apparently made in his
time as many books as ALEXANDRE DUMAs, only perhaps not all of
them so full of futerest, “ look at them well; for I can tell you it is
not often that you will see a pigeon that is let off on the Turf.”

Hot weather frequently has the effect of making many good-tempered

HAVELOCK'S HUMBLE PETITION.
* What I have done is done: my country's gratitude-
Amply has been expressed to me and mine;
every form of paraphrase and platitude
Employed where Englishmen in public dine.
-- M; birth-place is recorded in topography;
n print and out of print I have been mourned;
Done, overdone, in }. biography,
My moral pointed, and my tale adorned.
“A #. subaltern the Horseguards left me,
oo poor to "...". too proud to despair;
Of all save faith and fight years had bereft me,
When sunset glory lit on my grey hair.
, “And I, whose long day passed in the cold shade,
ent to my grave, at last, in dazzling light:
Happier that I had served my country's need,
Than in the fame which came so close on night.
-- Respect my modest life, and leave my name
Where my own hand has set it—on the roll
Of Indian war: at least, let meddling Fame
With no more Statues vex my patient soul.
“Although a Christian, I was not a Guy,
My head and body were in due proportion;
I was not that which BEHNEs sets on high, -
A short-legged hydrocephalous abortion.
“Wherefore, to NAPIER's and my disgrace,
Should Britain thus to sky her coppers dare,
With heads and tails like those that so deface
Our twin unlikenesses, in that sad Square,
“Where pilloried in effigy are seen,
(Worse mariyrs unan those burnt by Bishop Bonn ER)
In all hues from fierce copper to deep green,
The men whom England most delights to honour?
“GREY talks of “storied urns,” but never urn
Such stories told as statues now-a-days.
When will revived iconoclasm o'erturn
These bronze and marble monsters from our ways?
“A bookmaking biographer well known
The name of ‘One of Death's new terrors' bears;
BERNEs and ADAMs might the title owu, ... .
Who work such libels on our clay with theirs.
“Nor satisfied with one guy, ten feet long,

Br Hw vs in Sunderland repeats the wrong,
And there too ven's of me a brºzen whº pper.
“England—of heroes mother—spend thy sons,
But doom them not, thus, to post morten laughter:
Those that have died, like me, firm at their guns,
Ne'er looked to stand thus in the pillory, after!"
“Sanguinary Mendicant.”
In spite of what M. De MontalEMBERT may insinuate to the con:
trary, we cannot imagine any such words as “sanguinary mendicant"
dropping from the classic lips of the CHANCELLOR of The Exchkquer,
even though the subject he was speaking of was the Pope, and we
only allude to them for the purpose of indulging in the absurd suppo-
sition that a “sanguinary mendicant” must be one who gets his living
by means of “blood-money.”
A CIVIL CoNTINGENCY :—The *:: of civility on the road,
returning home from the Derby. We should not like to bet much
on such a contingency.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 27. This has been rather a peculiar week, and one
which will be remembered in Parliament, though the Outsiders either
undervalued or misunderstood the Little Game that was played. As
it has turned out, Ministers have not turned out, nor has there been
an announcement that Parliament must turn out, but both events were
on the cards. And the matter was in this wise.
The Conservatives in the Commons are exceedingly strong, numeri.
cally speaking (of course Mr. Punch does not mean intellectually) at
this moment; so strong, that a very small addition of numbers would
enable them to put PAM in a hole. Well, Lond DERBy does not want
to take office, for the simple reason that by the time his men got warm
in their places, they would all have to move out again. But, on the
other hand, power is very pleasant, and it is agreeable to LoRD DERBy
and MR. Disraeli to be able to say to the Government, “You may
stay in so long as you are good boys and do as we bid you, but remem-
ber that you are in only by our sufferance.” . And, an opportunity has
occurred for putting this lesson in lively colours before the Constable
and his men. There was an Irish grievance. . It is called the Galway
Çontract. Certain Irish folks solemnly undertook, for valuable consi.
deration, to do certain things in the way of mail-packeting. Of course,
they did not do them; and as, after a great many months, it becomes
clearer and clearer that the contract will be fulfilled in Irish fashion
only, which is Anyhow, and not as per bond, the Government reput
diates the bargain. This specimen of brutal Saxon, tyranny and
bppression has roused the Hibernian mind, especially the mind that
lives in the bodies that dwell near the district likely to be benefited by
the contract, and there was a Demonstration. Divers Irish Members
had the screw put upon them by various interests, and it became
necessary for them to please the populace by punishing the PREMIER,
Now our friends the Conservative leaders beheld this, and thought
that it would be a Neat Thing in Politics to get a good party division
at the moment when the Irish soul was inflamed against PAM. So it
was decided to give new battle on the Budget. Not that the Budget
had anything in the world to do with the Galway Contract, but because
the votes of the persecuted Irish Members (for, to do the majority of
them justice, they are, as CAPTAIN Esmonds spiritedly said, “gentle-
men,” and detest mob and priestly suasion) might be got into the
Lobby against Government. - -
So the battle was set, and on this Monday night exactly a dozen
speeches were delivered on the Paper-Duty question. MR.NEWDEGAT.
had a little battery of his own, which he fired off in the early part of
the night; but his Conservative friends had other fish to fly, and left
him to be bombarded by an overwhelming force. He and Spoonkº,
however, stood to their guns, and were smashed up in a heap by 34 tº
ig5. But when the blood-stained ruins of the Newdegatian Sebastopol
were cleared away, MR. Ken Sey MER came out with a resolution,
flatly negativing the proposition of the CHANCELLOR OF THE X, to
abolish the Paper-Duty. As Mr. Punch hath said, twelve addresses
were delivered, which were all about Paper, but which meant Galway:
At the end of the evening the Conservatives thought they were all
right, and wanted to divide; but the Constable was too wide awake to

Thursday. The . Paper-Galway battle was renewed, and raged
throughout the night. But in the meantime the most j.
legends were flying about. It was said that all the Irish Members
were going over to the Conservatives. It was said that all the Irish
Members had been going over to the Conservatives, but that LoRD
PALMERston had bought Ireland back at the price of £36,000, or half
the Contract Money. The speeches in the House bore a good deal
A NEW COMEDY OF ERRORS.
PEOPLE who pay taxes, and are sometimes heard to wonder how the
public money goes, may receive at least enlightenment, if they may not
satisfaction, from the following short statement which has been lately
put in print:—
upon these legends. Lord John Russell was indignantly virtuous, “The Dockyard commission reports the discovery of 7,906 errors in the accounts

wig
Friday. A wretchedly weak attempt at defending the DUKE •
CAMBRIDGE's wretchedly absurd appointment of GENERAL EDEN to the
Colonelcy of the “dirty half hundredth” was made by three foolish
Officers, whose Royal patron will hardly thank them for their blunder-
ing. The rest of the Parliamentary proceedings have been totally unin-
teresting, or, if there be any diamonds hidden in the chaff of the
Lords and Commons, Mr. Punch has no intention of stopping to pick
them out, having an engagement at the Crystal Palace, where the
respectable BLONDIN is about to risk his neck for the first time in
England. A confiding country knows, however, that if there were
really anything to record, Mr. Panch would not let twenty Blondins
drag him away by twenty ropes from duty, not even if there were a
certainty of the twenty Blondins breaking all their twenty necks.
COMMERCIAL
|NTELLIGENCE.
onsieur BlonDIN has re-
moved his celebrated
Rope-Walk from Nia-
gara to the Crystal
Palace. The share-
holders are in the
highest elevation. The
shares are almost be-
#. to look up.
The public curiosity
is in the highest state
of tension. Subscri-
bers even, who, as a
class, can never, it is
well known, have too
much for their money,
are beginning to ex-
press their gratitude.
We doubt not, every
time that BioNDIN
performs, but that
the performance will
be marked in their
memory, as the clas-
sics would say, “with
- a white chalk.” The
shareholders, also, who, like all shareholders who do not receive 35 per
cent. for their money, are notoriously a grumbling set, excuse the
“chalk” for the sake of the ready money they are sure to get. As
:::::::: well acquainted with deposits of every kind, they will tell
you that it is not always that gold is to be got out of the chalk forma-
tion; though at billiards, it is true, it does, occasionally come largely
into play, especially when the chalk falls into the hands of such a
player as Roberts. For the first time they begin to consider their
investments in Crystal Palace shares as not such a Cretan labyrinth
as they have hitherto done. In their exultation, they even go so far
as to say, that they look upon Blon DIN as “the most rising man
of the present day”—even greatly beyond LoRD Robert Cecil,
In their sanguine expectations, we must, say that these excited
shareholders are scarcely just to his Lordship; for in our mind
we had imagined that LöRD Robert CECIL had already reached
the very summit of absurdity, beyond which no man could possibly
further go.
entries for some thousands are omitted from their ledgers, and other
sums charged twice without the fault being found out. Book-keeping
by double-shuffle entry one might call it, if there were reason to ...;
se that any cheating was intended, which however we will charitably
lieve that there was not. As language is made use of to conceal the
thoughts, so figures may in some hands serve to hide what they should
show. “Errors Excepted" should be written at the foot of all
accounts at such establishments as Woolwich, and when the Naval
Estimates are debated before Parliament, every Member who may vote
should ask to have an estimate of how many omissions there may be in
what is shown.
Government clerks, we know, are sadly overworked; but as tax-
payers we feel we have a right to make request that means should be
devised for the protection of our pockets from the dips which must be
made in them by incorrect accounts. There should certainly be, some
one to overhaul the cash-books, and be himself hauled over if he let
pass a mistake. The notion of there being nearly eight thousand
omissions and mistakes within six months is almost comical enough to
make one fairly laugh at it, if it were not for the fact that one's
laughter would most E. be at one's own, expense. The Comedy
of Errors which has been performed at Woolwich would be farcical
enough if we had not to bear the cost of it; but as it is, if one is
tempted to get up a giggle, one feels that one is laughing on the wrong
side of one's mouth. We wonder how many of the clerks who assisted
in the making of the eight thousand mistakes have passed competitive
examinations to test them for their posts. From the talent for arith-
metic which these disclosures have betrayed in them, we should think
they would be plucked if they were asked what, two and two make.
Of course we don't wish to be cruel, and deprive them of their berths,
although their berths may be the death of all our hopes for a less
Income-Tax; but clearly MR. BULL should keep a closer eye to, the
keeping of his books, if only to sustain the credit of the nation, which
has earned the name of being a nation of bookkeepers. When MR.
BULL is made a bankrupt (a contingency which, owing to the dropping
of the Paper Duty, is prophesied as being by no means, far remote) he
certainly can't hope to get a first class certificate, if his accounts are
so ºlive as those at his establishment at Woolwich have been
proved.

I move this House adjourn,
Why should I say on what pretext?

Doth generally concern;
The whole House knows the reason why
I rise to sing adjourn, -
Adjourn! Adjourn!

WE take the liberty of asking Apothecaries' Hall—or, more properly
speaking, we pay them the compliment of putting to them—the
following question, which, we hope, they will not absurdly consider in
the light of “throwing physic to the dogs”: Since Quinine is made
from Bark, would it not sound better, and the meaning of it be more
sound altogether, to call it “CANINE” An answer, in the shape of
an amended label, will oblige.

KETTLEDRUM! KETTLEDRUM! !
**T AGMW
&ou SEE \ \,
Well, Polly did put the kettle on nicely, and you have all got your tea with
silver spoons in it, and now tip up. Mr. Punch claims his money boldly. All the
humbugs who send private tips now advertise that “they sent nothing but Kettle-
drum,” but it is an impudent falsehood, my bloaters, not one of them did anything
of the sort, and the fools who trusted in these canting swine are now weeping and
wailing, while you, my bloaters, are standing on the topmost ridge of exultation
and gazing down contemptuously upon the victimisation of imbecility. Well, but
do not be bumptious, Punch did it all, “fortune had no share in this,” as HELIoga-
BALUs said when he swallowed the live lamprey whole, and you must not be proud.
Even in the hour of triumph, Mr. Punch had a kindly look for the bonnie Dundee,
KETTLEDRUM! ! !
IGHT! Much there is to boast of in that I Right! Why, my con-
gratulatory bloaters, Punch simply used his illimitable intellect,
looked over the Horses, and calmly selected the winner as unhesi-
tatingly as he would take the biggest strawberry out of a plate held
to him by the fair hands of beauty. Right? Come, don't begin pour-
ing out your antibilious eulogies, just because he didn't imitate all the
clumsy Prophets, pseudonymous, anonymous, and anodynomenous,
who made their ridiculous guesses in print, or sent them in dirty
envelopes, and scarcely dared to say, plump, that any particular horse
would win, but sneakingly hinted that three had good chances, that
three more would make cockboats, and that three others had uncom-
monly excellent qualities; and then these blessed humbugs were
wrong on all nine chances. Call that prophesying?—why, DR. HUM-
MINg, the pet vaticinator of Exeter Hall, can do better than that. He
is man enough to say that the world will come to an end one of these
days, if it doesn't last longer. Bah, bob, bee, as Panurge says. By
the pavilion of Mars, Mr. Punch hates nothing so much as humbug.
He knew who was going to win, and he proclaimed the fact eight
hours before the race, and for fear of mistake published his pro-
phecy in the Times newspaper on the Derby morning. He admits
that he thereby destroyed all interest in the race, and like Thomas the
Rhymer he is gifted with the inconvenient faculty of always speaking
the truth, and is thereby made disagreeable in Society and among the
ladies, but what can he do. Genius cannot be snuffed out, and he
could no more help penning this preternatural paragraph, than the
Poet Close can help writing doggerel. What said Mr. Punch?
“RETTLEDRUM'S GoDFATHERS AND GODMOTHER were: BOLD
sponsors, seeing THAT A KETTLEDRUM is MEANT to BE BEAT; But
IF Polly PUTS THAT KETTLE ON NICELY, WE MAY ALL HAVE TEA
WITH SILVER SPOONS IN IT, AND wouldN'T THAT BE A PRETTY KETTLE
of FISH, My Bloaters? HUsh-A-BYE, BABY, Your CRADLE IS GREEN,
FATHER's A NobleMAN, MoTHER's A QUEEN, SISTER's A LADY AND WEARs
A GoLD RING, BRother's A DRUMMER, AND Daunts For THE KING."
who came in so gamely on his game leg, despite his mischance, and deserved the
laurel it was not his to gain. Now, tip up, and send in your winnings, for Punch
cannot be putting on extra steam for nothing, and he has several hundreds of pairs
of gloves, voluntarily lost, to pay to various exquisite and darling Beings who called
him to their carriages to prevent Destruction of Tissue, forgetting, the dear ones,
that they were all the time destroying the tissue of his susceptible heart. There-
fore, bloaters, once more, tip up, and Mr. Punch, drinking to you all, hopes many
a time and oft to pilot you again over the white waves of irresolution into tho bland
and smiling harbour of prosperity and glory. Tip up !
PUNCH, The only Correct Prophet.
THE RAGGED CLERGY.
THE Protestant. Association, apparently, is unaware of the fact that
an order of mendicants exists in the Church of England. The abo-
lition of this fraternity is an object much rather to be desired by
Exeter Hall than the suppression of the Franciscans, or any other
community of begging friars maintained in the Church of Rome.
Voluntary mendicity may be a mistake; but involuntary mendicity is
disgraceful to the hierarchy by which it is permitted, if that hierarchy
is rolling in wealth. Now, the mendicity existent in the Established
Church is involuntary. The Anglican mendicants comprise numerous
Clergymen, who hold small livings, and all, or nearly all, the Curates
without private property, or . income beyond their stipends whereon
to subsist. They are chargeable not only with involuntary begging,
but also, with the worse than Popish practice of fasting against
eir will.
... As the readers of this popular periodical are continually increasing,
it is expedient for Mr. Punch to state from time to time that there is
in being, and in active operation, an Association organised to relieve
destitute Clergymen—the Clerical Fund, and Poor Clergy Relief
Society, 32, Southampton Street, Strand, W.C.. And, with an affirma-
tion that he is not joking, Punch has further to inform his subscribers,
who may also be disposed to subscribe to that Society, that the
material relief which it is accustomed to administer to clerical destitu-
tion consists, in a very considerable measure, of old clothes. The
Society is open to receive donations of cast-off canonicals and other
apparel, which are thankfully accepted by Divines out at elbows.
The Rºy. W. G. JERVIs, Secretary to the above-named Association,
has published a letter addressed to him by a Country Curate, and con-
taining a description of the writer's circumstances, which, Mr. JERVIs
says, represents exactly the state wherein Curates live. The Country
Curate is the factotum of a non-resident Rector. He is nearly sixty
i. old, and has little more than £90 a-year. To eke out his income
e is compelled to have recourse to charity. During the last ten years
he has never, but twice or thrice, been able to afford to ask a friend to
dine with him. He has not the means to take out his family for an
92casional change of that air which is almost all they have to live upon.
Food for the mind, also, is so much too dear for him that he cannot
even belong to a book club. He and his family are forced to go with-
out medical aid when they are ill, except in case of extreme danger,
and then he pays his doctor's bill by instalments. If TIMOTHY had
been so badly off, he never could have taken the prescription of PAUL.
“Wine,” says the Country Curate, “is altogether out of the question,
and of late, to saye the expense”—mark this, you journeymen carpen;
ters, painters, plumbers and glaziers, and bricklayers, discontented
with your work and wages-
“I have even had to give up malt liquor entirely."
What do you think of a journeyman parson, nigh sixty years of age.
obliged to deny himself beer? - - -
Not only have the Country Curate and his family nothing better to
drink than slops, but they have nothing else to wear. For years he
has been in the habit of buying second-hand clothing, “even to hats
and shoes.” Any Dean or Bishop, whose feet may have been enlarged
by the gout, would no doubt do a welcome thing to this poor clergy-
man, by sending him the shoes that are now too small for them. The
bishopric of Durham is a fat one; the occupant of that see may happily
not be affected with hypertrophy of the lower extremities, and there-
fore may have no tight shoes to give away; but, he might show forth
the fruits of good living to the succour of this Curate, and many other
famishing Curates, by the exercise of an economy short of Cheese.
paring. - - -
The richer Clergy generally, as well as the laity, are invited to con-
tribute both money and raiment to the Society established at 32,
Southampton Street, Strand. Old clothes may be sent by all parties
in the Church. A ragged Anglo-Catholic Qurate would probably not
in the least object to wear an Evangelical white choker, and as little
would one of the Low Church school decline the present of an M. B.
waistcoat.
French Freemasonry.
IN front of the Freemasons’ Lodge in the Rue Cadet was posted,
the other day, the annexed notice:-
“By order of the Prefect of Police, all meetings of the Grand Orient are for-
bidden. The Assembly of the Grand Orient is adjourned to the month of October."
In France it would seem that Freemasons exist in the enjoyment of
French freedom.
THE Most IMPORTANT ORDER OF THE DAY.-What to order for dinner.

A SKETCH ON THE DOWNS.
Jolly Post-Boy of the Period. “I say, BILL, DoN'T YER wish IT was DARBY DAY ALL THE YEAR Round !”
THE PROFITABLE WALUE
OF DELAY.
GRANTING that “Time is money.”
if you, gain time, then you gain
so much money. Hence, the inter-
est of the Government in refusing
to pay the Delhi prize-money, may
be to pocket the interest that has
been accruing ** protrac-
ted delay, for SIR. C. Woon has
deliberately stated in the House
that, no matter when the prize-
money is paid, no interest will be
paid with it.
The delay is most shameful.
|We do not see, why the poor
soldiers, because they bravely with-
stood the Delhi siege, should be
cruelly exposed to another - for
cannot, these frequent, postpone-
ments be called, without torturing
the word too much, a downright
Siege of Delay – that may be
purposely carried on, with the
secret intention that when it is
finished, there may not be a
single survivor, left, not even an
executor, to claim anything. We
agree with the claimants in pro-
nouncing every explanation, that
|pretends to account for this unjus-
tifiable procrastination as “a regu-
|lar put off.” It is but right that
our Government should place great
trust in the British Soldier, but it
is too bad to expect the British
soldier to give them four years'
credit, and not to expect a farthing
of interest for the trust so long
reposed.
CLAY IN PAPER.
MR. FREDERICK PENNY, Professor of Chemistry at the Glasgow
University, writes to the Times to say that he has discovered “a very
§: quantity of fine white clay amounting, in some instances,
to 30 per cent, in foreign papers.” . We have no hesitation in stating
that, on several occasions, we ourselves have found a large quantity of
mud of a very dark colour in the Univers, which it took apparently a
malicious pleasure in flinging in handfuls at England, and it is well
known that many other foreign papers have so much dirt in their com-
position that one cannot take them up without serious detriment to
one's fingers, thereby proving how much of the soil there is in them.
We are bound to confess, however, that the only real discovery of clay
that we ever made in a paper was on the 20th of May, when we fell
over an article in the Times that was based upon nothing else; for it
was signed, “C. M. Clay,” who it seems, is the “United States'
Minister Plenipotentiary, &c. &c. to St. Petersburgh.” This CLAY,
though of a very heavy nature, did not absorb much of the public
attention, and we ourselves found it no small difficulty to wade through
it. The great pull of this Quay appeared to be to puff the Northern
States of America, but nothing but smoke came out of the puffing.
This is the only evidence of CLAY that we have discovered in paper,
and we must say, from that specimen, that we have no particular
desire to find any more. However, we should like PROFEsson PENNY
to pursue his interesting discoveries, and accordingly we have sent him
a copy of the Morning 'Tizer, if he would only be kind enough to
analyse it for us... We have no doubt he will find it to contain a large
proportion of a white clay of a very porous nature—the clay, in fact,
that pipes are made of, and which is also known to be favourable to
the cultivation of tobacco. We have not troubled MR. PENNY with
the Tablet, another favourite paper of ours, inasmuch as we know, from
experience, that though that º has a certain proportion of Clay in
its composition, such as is used in Roman cement, yet in all other
respects it is a complete drug, being full of nothing but Jesuit's Bark,
such as no one thinks of paying the smallest attention to, unless the
poor patient, who takes it in, happens to have a raging Scarlet fever
upon him.
Not FAR WRong.—By a typographical * in a gº con-
temporary, the United States were called “the Untied States.”
WOCAL MILITARY MUSIC.
.The Volunteer movement is in some measure a musical one. It
bids fair, at least, to introduce a new feature into military music.
A contemporary publishes the ensuing pleasant piece of news :-
“The 3rd City of London VoluntEERs.-On Saturday º, last about 200
members of this corps, under the command of MAJon Richards, had a march out
as far as Notting Hill, accompanied by their bands . A novel feature in the return
march was some admirable chorus singing in the ranks, which had a fine effect."
. Some old gentlemen of the Army may be prodigiously shocked by the
innovation of chorus-singing in the ranks of º Volunteers; but if
instrumental music is soldierly, what else is vocal ? The former is
acknowledged to have its martial uses, and the latter must have at
least the same; so that their union will necessarily produce a double,
if not more than a double, effect. The natives of this island may as
well have their war-songs as the inhabitants of less civilised portions
of the globe, provided of course that the songs are proper for intelligent
and educated beings to sing. If the voluntary forces take to singing,
there can be no reason why the regular troops should not follow
their example, and become volunteers too, so far as volunteering to
oblige the public with songs. The gaiety of the soldier's life would be
much heightened if every company were to become a chorus, and each
regiment, on its route, were to march along singing, for example:-
“A very good song, and very well sung,
jº. every one."
They would kick up a glorious row, to be sure; for the British
soldier never did yet, and we trust never will, sing small.
A Legal Judgment.
Be quick in all your actions, and prompt in your service. Whatever
you execute, let the execution take place on the spot, You must be
nimble of apprehension, or else many a fine capture will assuredly slip
through, your fingers. Take warning from the Court of Chancery.
Think of the delays for which it is notoriously guilty—calculate, if you
can, the enormous sums that have been lost in consequence of those
delays; and all owing to its extreme slowness of decision.—Lord Chan-
cellor Punch.

MR. PUNCH AT THE RACES.
AST week, being ho-
noured with a spe-
cial card of invita-
tion to join the
little party of some
ten thousand or so,
who were assem-
bled upon MR.
HENRY DORLING's
hospitable premi-
ses, Mr. Punch felt
it his duty to pay
Epsom Downs a
visit on the Oaks
Day as well as
upon that which is
held sacred to Saint
Derby. He thereby
had the opportu-
nity of watching
the behaviour of
his friends, the
British Public, on
the “Lady's Day”
- as well as the more
patronised, occa-
sion; and he begs leave to congratulate that most enlightened body on the signs
of marked improvement in their conduct which he noticed. Mr. Panch had
occasion, two Derby days ago, to give a lecture to some fast men who had then
broken loose, and who considered that to sprinkle boarding-schools with beer was
ºne of the most elegant and wittiest of jokes. Mr. Punch is glad to say...that, this
fast form of fun is now fast ºf out, and ere long he believes it will be
thoroughly extinct. Through his help men are learning the fact that it is possible
to get up a good laugh, without getting up the danders of those whom it is raised
| at." All Mr. Punch's jokes are made both with good temper and good taste; and
though the devotees of Derby Day may lack the latter }.' they certainly are
| growing more attentive to the former. Mr. Punch con
esses that he can’t quite
see the fun of wearing pasteboard noses, or sticking little naked wooden dolls all
round one’s hat; but if men, have a desire to make themselves ridiculous, this
is at least a harmless way of doing it, and is far better than F.; boarding-

Panch was welcomed everywhere with
...happy smiling faces, and found that all the neighbourhood had turned out as usual
to see his carriage pass. Being jammed for some half-hour between a four-in-hand
a costermonger's cart, with a pleasure-van in front and a swell
brougham behind, Mr. Punch of course prepared himself to hear some slang
expressions; but he is glad to i. he heard neither indecency nor oath. On
arriving at the Downs, he proceeded at once to the Grand Stand, and in so doing
had to elbow through that circle of acquaintance which is known in racing parlance
as the betting “ring.” This being a slow process, it was well nigh three o'clock
before he got up-stairs; and then every inch of public seeing-space was occupied,
and hº was the man who had paid down his twelve guineas to secure a private
box. By the courtesy of one whose title it would not be seemly to disclose,
Mr. Punch had a clear view of the victory of Kettledrum (who, unlike other
Kettledrums, seemed made not to be beaten), and Mr. Punch begs to thank that
Noble. Lord for giving him that memorable sight. Mr. Punch would likewise
vehis thanks to MR. DoRLING, for pointing out an easy way of access to the
addock, where the favourites were by far the most important beings present, and
looked like Houhnnyhms with a lot of tag-rag Yahoos at their heels. Nor must
Mr. Punch forget to thank that Fº oliceman who escorted him across the
crowded Course. Except that he was tall and had amazingly fine whiskers, the

The World's Race is a sight that every one should see, and that it is possible

coul bring a host of witnesses to show. As a proof of his own temperance,

GOING DOWN.—HERACLITUs (the Laugher).
FRESHNEss and fairness everywhere,
Spring leaves, spring grass, spring flowers!
On earth, in air, nor dust, nor glare,
Thanks to last night's kind showers
The clouds ride high across the sky,
'Twill be a glorious day,
As 'twixt the screen of hedgerow green,
Past furzy commons, hamlets clean–
Glimpses of village life just seen—
And stately halls and parks between,
Basking in sunshine, still, serene,—
We briskly bowl away!
A fig for thought, as laughter-fraught
The long lines onward flow:
And save our luncheon-hampers nought
Seems heavy, as we go!
DEMOCRITUs (the Weeper).
How flat and tame! All round the same—
Same hedges, fields and trees'
'Tis well the scene of raw rank green,
Grows dustier by degrees. -
The dust may choke the pointless joke
That wakes the brainless laugh,
Smother those hits of back-slum wits,
This glow of filthy chaff.
And this is England's garden wide,
This monotone of green!
In these aristocrats that ride,
Zephyred and veiled, in sullen pride,
Or this low rabble at their side,-
These trulls and doxies, plumed and pied,
Round-hatted, crinoline-i-fied,
The English breed is seen!
And now we stop! And now we drop
Into the crush again!
Ha, there's a crash! And—look—a smash!
I hope it's going to rain!
ON THE COURSE.-HERACLITUs (the Laugher).
LIKE scene to this the world I wis
Ne'er showed, and ne'er will show !
Hundreds of thousands, all in bliss,
High, middle-class, and low !
Such feasisi such fun! And never one
So hungry, mean, or poor,
But shares the mirth, forgets his dearth,
Finds for life's ill, a cure
The Race—a life of hope and fear
Condensed into a flash!
These luncheons, how Gargantuesque!
This life . A motley arabesque,
Dark gipsy, acrobat, grotesque,
Wealth, ruin, tragedy, burlesque—
Business does well to leave the desk,
Satire to drop its lash.;
The joyous scene stirs blood and spleen,
Sets one with life in tune,
From merry May makes gladsome way
To bright and burning June!
DEMOCRITUs (the Weeper).
The Carnival of sin and shame,
The Paradise of fools,
Wanity Fair, at maddest game—
God help the brain that cools!
Waste’s reckless hand, the wanton band
That waits upon it, nigh:
And roguery with fawning bland,
And want with vulturous eye |
The Race!, whose rush such hopes destroys-
Ruin bedecked with wings!
This gorge and swill of brainless boys,
Whose highest joy is wine and noise,
And shying sticks at baby's toys;
These lying gipsies, vile decoys,
And every form low life employs,
To pull fool-puppets' strings!
Away, away, nor longer stay,
For sorrow and for scorn:
A sadder, if not wiser crowd
*Twiſbetomorrow morn.

A WARNING TO MOTHERS.
What must happen if they continue increasing the size of these newly
invented Balloon Balls.
COALS IN COSTUME.
“FRIEND PUNCH,
“AMong other announcements concerning the “Fashionable
World,' it was notified, the other day, upon customary authority, that
at the Drawing-room to be held on the 19th of this month, certain
ladies will wear deep crape mourning with black ornaments, and—
“All other ladies attending the Court will appear in black, with black feathers,
lappets, and gloves. Diamonds may be worn."
“What dost thou think, Friend, of the discernment shown by the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN in commanding ladies to wear black clothes,
called mourning, and yet permitting them to wear diamonds? Are
not diamonds the most festive of precious stones, and at least as gay
as artificial flowers? I think thy sentiments are the same as mine
with regard to the demonstration of inward affection by means of"
outward apparel, although thou mightest dress in black on occasion, in
deference to custom. But I suppose thou wouldst desire to maintain
a consistency in thy sable externals, and in those of thy wife, and have
them black and all black. So, peradventure, doth the Lord Cham-
BERLAIN wish the ladies to do at the Drawing-room. He ordaineth
black ornaments. Surely he esteemeth diamonds ornamental. When
therefore he saith that “ diamonds may be worn,” may he not be un-
derstood to mean black diamonds?

“Fozhole, June, 1861.” “OBADIAH.”
FACING ONE'S CONSTITUENTS.
A PARTY of the name of Zachorojko, who had been elected to the
Galician Diet, returned to his constituents without having fulfilled
any of the fine promises which he made upon the hustings of Busk.
He tried to offer some excuses, but they were voted unsatisfactory in
the highest degree, and his constituents, instead of laying down the
law in a resolution, laid down their Parliamentary Representative on a
bench, “and a vigorous arm, wielding a hazel stick, administered unto
the M.P. forty-eight sound whacks on the lower part of his back.”
Such coarse practices may be necessary in countries where elected
representatives, make fine promises and break them, but, happily in
England the offence is as impossible as the punishment would be cruel.
THE BONES OF WASHINGTON..
A YEAR ago, and by the maples brown,
U'erhanging swift Potomac's broadened wave,
Bareheaded stood the heir of England's crown,
By the poor stone that shuts an ill-kept grave,
Giving meet reverence to the dead that lay,
Beneath the stripes and stars carved on that stone,
Which nothing of inscription doth display
To mar the majesty that broods upon
The ten plain letters spelling WASHINGTON.
England's crown-prince at this arch-rebel's tomb,
First Magistrate twice-chosen of the States
That rose impatient for more elbow-room,
And flung the English crown out of their gates.
The contrast of those times and these so shows
In this respect of Prince for President,
That e'en the trite prize-poem-maker flows,
Into some lines of grave and deep intent.
Describing that young head in solemn reverence bent.
Passed there a stir from wasting bone to bone,
Ran there a thrill through the great chief's grey dust,
That the old king's great grandson by his stone,
Should bow the head, owning him great and just *
Hovered his placid spirit near and blest
That latest victory of truth o'er time,
When discords, slow but sure resolved, attest
The high and holy harmonies which chime
Their broader music through the spheres sublime?
Or was there foresight of the woe to be
Before the lapse of twelve months and a day ?
Was that great spirit prescient to see,
The stripes and stars torn from that flag away ?
To know the work that he had lived to do,
And saw and said, was good, before he died,
Undone—his glorious Union cleft in two,
And cleaving more and more on every side,
Till none can say how far the fragments may divide.
Saw he the day that we see with amaze,
When those to whom his life from youth he gave
His own Wirginians, his dust should raise,
Out of the shelter of that sacred grave;
Regardless of the curse that lies on those
§ hose hands disturb even the cemmon dead!
Brothers, from brothers bearing, as from foes,
His bones that oft their sires to battle led
Who now draw impious swords, near his dishonoured bed?
SCOTCH SALMON AND SEWAGE.
THE subjoined heart-rending paragraph appeared the other day in
the Glasgow Citizen:—
“SALMoN FRY IN THE Clype.—Large numbers of salmon fry were seen, early in
the week, leaping in the Clyde, at Glasgow, a little way above the bridges. By
Wednesday, however, the high tides had carried some portion of the water polluted
with the sewage of the city above the weir, and the result was that the young fish
sickened and were rendered helpless.”
A double cut is inflicted by the foregoing statementon our tenderest
feelings. If the Clyde salmon fry had been poisoned with the useless
refuse of chemical works, that alone would have been too bad. But it is
too, too bad that they should have been poisoned with sewage. Salmon
are killed with what would have nourished crops. That which should
have been turned into bread destroys fish. Scotland is the land of
salmon and also the land of cakes, and she deprives herself of both
cakes and salmon, by causing the salmon to perish in the sewage out 0
which she might have constituted cakes. H. us hear no more of the
frugality of Scotland till she ceases to waste her manure in extermi.
nating her salmon.
American Ties,
It has been said that the Americans have no veneration for old ties.
y engaging in a fratricidal war, they also show themselves forgetful
of their common origin from a parent stock. They are ready not only
to cut ties, but also throats, and those the throats of one another.
A RATHER IMPORTANT SYLLABLE.
The Opposition objected to Ministers for their methodof "tacking"
in the case of the Budget Bill, Ministers had more reason to com-
plain of the Opposition for their method of attacking in the same case.

MUFFS OF MARYLEBONE.
NICHOLAY, the Oxford Street skin-man, and that lot, have actually
been holding a meeting for the purpose of denouncing the conduct of
MR. MANsfield, the excellent Magistrate, in upholding the law, and
in summarily packing off to gaol a gang of dirty Germans who persisted
The wind-bag speeches of these Marylebone spouters were ludicrous
enough, and no doubt the Home SECRETARY has had a good roar at
them. Mr. Punch merely adverts to such bosh because MR. MANs:
FIELD has not been very long accustomed to this kind of parochial
tom-foolery, and it may be well for him to know, that the NICHOLAys,
DIFFANGERs, BugGINSEs, &c., are the regular, laughing-stocks of the
Metropolis. Wery decent shopkeepers, no doubt, but when they begin
to make orations, look out for bunkum. As for the Marylebone snobs,
who ought to be proud of having such a man as MR. BABBAGE in their
parish, all that can be said is, that they are worthy of such represen-
tative, as the skin man and his set. When M. ARAGO, the great
French savant, settled in a French, country town to pursue some
experiments, the inhabitants, feeling honoured at his selection of the
place, actually drew a cordon round his .# and established a
sort of friendly police for the sake of preventing his experiments from
being disturbed. The clowns of Marylebone, on the other hand,
insensible to the fact that every day of MR. BABBAGE's labours
redounds to the advantage of society, and the honour of England,
hound on gangs of street musicians to disturb and annoy him, and yet
doubtless prate with all Cockney, emphasis about “these ear henlight.
ened days, and the march of hintellect.” However, MR. MANSFIELD
may be assured that Society is with him, and he may treat such vestry
bosh with the same contempt manifested for it by SIR GEORGE LEWIs.
The more of the organ-wretches MR. MANSFIELD, sends to quod the
better, and he may safely take MR. BABBAGE's word, in any future case
of the kind, against any number of “indignant inhabitants” who
back the grinding and blowing nuisances, because the intellect of a
person who can come forward in aid of the perpetrators of such
nuisances must render him (however decent a person behind his
counter), utterly unfit to give testimony worth, twopence. With
Society, the Home Office, and Mr. Punch on his side, MR. MANSFIELD

FRESH AS PAINT.
For the last two or three weeks, it has been rather dangerous to
walk through the streets of London. Though we have been favoured
with a succession of dry weather, the Metropolis has been almost wet
with paint. Shopkeepers and householders have been vying with each
other to put on the smartest fronts to their houses. T. taller
than any fire-escape, have obstructed the pavement in every direction.
It is true that the Academy, and the other artistic societies, generall
open in the month of May, but that is no reason why London itse
should be, also, one vast exhibition of painting. Not even the lamp-
posts, or the railings, have escaped this daubing infection. The
browded thoroughfares that have narrow pavements, have been all but
impossible to traverse. One's only º of safety was to walk in the
middle of the road. We pitied the ladies with their voluminous
dresses. Lured by the gay attractions of the shops to peep into them,
it was not always they paid attention to the inscription that was
chalked on the pavement below, and sad and ruinous in many instances
have been the consequences, because their impulsive admiration could
not be warned in time to “BEwARE of THE PAINT.” Many a light-
coloured dress has returned home so harlequinaded in effect that the
modiste, from whose studio it had emanated, would be sorely puzzled
to recognise the emanation of her genius again. After .. a poly-
chromatic metamorphosis, it would require a clever milliner indeed to
be able to know her own offspring. The colours are fast enough, but
it has been found on experiment that they will not wash. This may
do good to trade, but many a poor husband, on making the discovery
has lost his appetite for dinner at the thought of the additional
expense.
The country, we believe, has been always recommended, if a lady
wishes to get a little fresh colour. This is quite a mistake; she must
come up to Town about this time of the year, and we will warrant that
she will get more, colour in half an hour than the healthiest rural
district could give her in a hundred years; and as for freshness, what
colour can be so fresh as that which has just come from the colour-
man's Then there is the perfume, too! The fine invigorating smell
of turpentine makes the Metropolis quite a nosegay, and throws the
boasted flowers of the country quite into the shade—so much so, that
one cannot help turning up one's nose at Spring and all the fragrant
odours that Poets are so fond of associating ...; it. We should lose
this healthy effect if the houses were painted when every one was out
of Town; and it is with this view, probably, that shopkeepers have
wisely deferred resorting to the paint-brush till every one comes up for
the season, We can imagine that there is a certain class of old fogies,
who, afraid of their coat-tails being smeared a pea-green or a bright
sky-blue, exclaim in their nervous indignation, “Let go the Painter | *
but depend upon it these are only hard-grained realists, who have no
eyes for pictorial effect, and whose unpoetical nostrils are never tickled
y any fragrance but that of rappee or Prince’s Mixture. It is not for
such that London puts on her summer attire, though we must in
honesty confess that she is a beauty rather addicted to perform her
!. . public a little too publicly, and that she does paint a trifle
much.
GILLS THAT WANT NO STARCH.
LAUNDREsses, capable of reading, will be either amused or terrified
by the subjoined advertisement, taken from the Manchester Guardian:

to the finest linen, 1s. 6d. each.
ENAMELLED STEEL WRISTBANDS, for gentlemen.

An old woman might be disposed to laugh at the idea of a steel
collar, as a sort of collar only fit for a dog, or to be worn as a piece of
throat armour, to defend the wearer from garotte-robberies. On the
other hand she may fear that if steel is found to answer for collars, the
employment of that material will soon be extended to shirts, which
will require no further washing than what can be effectually performed
by the extemporaneous application of a wet towel. Steel shirts will
be followed by steel sheets, so soft and flexible that those who ...;
between them will lie quite comfortably, and not at all as thoug
reclining on—
“DAMIENS" bed of steel.”
Sheets of steel, indeed, will supersede flaxen fabrics, and usurp the
place, and perhaps the name also, of Irish linen.
To Actors who are not Worth a Thought.
We notice that there is a book called Acting and Thinking. This
is, to distinguish it, we imagine, from the generality of Acting, in
which there is mostly no Thinking?

THE Rambler, a rational Roman Catholic journal, having,
on occasion, remarked, with a view to deprecate the inter-
ference of the Church with scientific questions, that there
are “decisions of the highest ecclesiastical courts which
for generations fettered or prevented the course of science
in several parts of Europe,” the Tablet, which goes the
whole hog of Popery, thus comments, with reference to
that observation:—
“If the Church thought that a particular scientific opinion tended
to perplex the simple, we do not know how she is to be blamed if she
condemned the scientific gentlemen, or even corrupted science in the
interest of man's salvation?"
. At this rate, the Church would be justified not only in
telling a lie, but also in condemning a man for telling the
truth. She would be right in anathematising, and perhaps
in roasting, a philosopher for disabusing the mind of a
Catholic booby of the persuasion that the earth was flat,
and that Heaven was situated on the other side of the blue
sky. How is it possible to believe one word that is said by
people who entertain such opinions on the subject of vera-
city as those which are represented by the Tablet; and how
much sincerity is there in the faith of those who avow that
| part of their religion is humbug?
DON DO AND DONE.
MoRocco owes Spain money. A party in Spain suggests
that the Government should leather Morocco into payin
her debt. Considering the treatment of the Spanish bond-
holders, this is cool. It is indeed too cool even for the
Spanish Government—not the most easily abashed—and
it magnanimously declares, through its official organ, that
“there is no fear of a war with Morocco. Government
|has decided not, to undertake a war on a, question of
| money !” Mighty magnanimous from a repudiating State,
which owes John BULL more millions that it is ever likely
to pay. Money, in slang, is called “the Spanish,” no doubt
on the lucus à non lucendo principle, because out of the
Spanish there is no getting money.

THAT BLESSED DONKEY!
THE Pops, we read, lately visited his army at Torre de Valle. He
gave his blessing to two rifled cannon—thus insuring those blessèd
cylinders against missing, upsetting, bursting, and all the other mis-
fortunes which Popes cannot avert from themselves, but which they
have only to hold up two fingers to ward off from anything they may
vouchsafe to bless, from a donkey on St. Antony's day to a devotee in
the Holy Week. And so the consecrated cannon were solemnly sponged,
cartridged, wadded, balled, rammed down, and laid. The lock was
pulled, and the gun was fired. A º: dº happened to be the
only thing within range, and was killed by the bullet!, Punch the
Excommunicate says this was an allegory—that none but donkeys are
likely to be within range of the Papal fire, and still more certainly none
but donkeys are likely to be hurt by it.
But, the precedent raises a nice question for the papal Camera.
What is the fate of the donkey that falls, under a consecrated bullet
being at the time not in a state of mortal sin, i.e., not being engaged
in warfare against the Pope? To Mr. Punch, much considering these
things, it appears probable that the virtue of the Papal benediction
passes to the innocent sufferer, and that the Ass, thus dying, is (like
that other immortal wearer of an Ass's head, Bottom,) “translated”
into a higher state of animal existence, where he passes a beatific time
of it, with St. Roch's ºf: St. Antony's pig, St. Agnes's lamb, St.
Martin's horse, and the other blessed beasts familiar to us from Romish
picture and Romish legend.
In fact the horrors of martyrdom are fairly claimable for every
donkey, which being—as donkeys usually are— †† to the Pope,
yet offers itself as a sacrifice to prove the death-dealing aim of the
Papal cannons. The tribute is the more valuable, as those cannons are
not considered so formidable just now, as in days when they thundered
from the Vatican, double-shotted with leaden bullae—the proper
Pontifical bullets. - -
In these godless times men are apt to consider their fire, a mere
brutum fulmen, and to treat them, in fact, as what the sailors call
quakers, wooden cylinders painted, mounted, and run out like real
cannon to humbug an enemy. - -

THE Royal Commissioners tell us, in their report, that the present income of the
Blue-coat School is £60,930 per annum. We wish the Commissioners had carried
their investigations a little further. We should like to have known how much
the really poor, for whose benefit the above charity was supposed to have been
originally instituted, receive out of the above income; also, what is the station in
life, and the P. income of the parent of every boy who is domiciled there; and
how many of them keep carriages, &c.? The subject of presentations, also, would
have formed a very curious chapter. We might have learnt if they are ever sold,
or bartered, or trafficked in, or given away to ladies and ſº in easy com-
fortable circumstances, who certainly would have paid for their children's schooling
if they had not got these educational free admissions for nothing. Gentility occa-
sionally is not too proud to soil her white, hands by accepting such gifts. It is
true that Poverty suffers, but then is it not her hard lot to suffer; and besides is

We are told that “charity covers a multitude of sins,” and she needs a very large
cloak indeed to hide all the errors and abuses committed by those who are entrusted
with the sacred administration of its funds, and who either from weakness, or
excess of good nature, or downright incapacity, do not know how properly to
dispense them.
POLLY THE PORTER,
THE Messager du Nord states that on the Edinburgh and Glasgow line the
Directors, in consequence of the neglect of the porters to call out the names of the
stations, have placed Parrots at those points, and that the well-tutored birds shriek
out the necessary information, to the perfect satisfaction of travellers. A con-
temporary affects to discredit the statement, but Mr. Punch believes that it is
perfectly correct, except that the employment of the parrots was not rendered
necessary by the neglect of the porters, but by their inability to make their pro-
vincial utterances comprehended by educated travellers. The same inconvenience
is felt in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, and other semi-civilised regions,
and Mr. Punch is happy to hear that the Directors on most of the lines have
resolved to meet the difficulty in the same way as the Scotch authorities have done.
| A large and choice assortment of grey Parrots is now being trained at the
|
Geographical Society's house, and as soon as the birds are
sufficiently, apt, they will be placed upon the various

POET CLOSE CHANGES HIS MIND.
“The ridiculous gift of a pension to the Westmoreland scribbler
has been cancelled.”
WHAT, take away the Poet's cash!
I call that action mean,
The man who’d do that brutal thing
Ought not to serve a QUEEN.
All that I said about old PAM
I hereby do retract,
I did not think him vile enough
To do so low an act.
He is a humbug, born and bred,
Merely a slave of Court,
Without the †: and the pluck
To do the thing he ought.
In other days he was a buck,
And persons called him Cupid;
But now he's an exploded tool,
His speeches very stupid.
I do believe he sold us all
To Russia's tyrant CzAR,
And he felt quite sorry that we won
In the Crimean war.
To give a thing and take a thing,
I’ve heard a proverb old
Declares is most contemptible,
The “devil's ring of gold.”
It shows that all these Lords are fools,
Unfit to rule and sway,
And England ought to be ashamed
Of trusting such as they.
A wretched paltry fifty pounds,
To take it was disgrace
If Mistra PAM would call on me
I'd fling it in his face.
He thinks to put me in a rage,
The mean, old, wretched Sham,
But here I solemnly declare
I’m prouder as I am.
To be a pensioned slave of state
Unsuits my haughty mind,
I choose to have my genius free
Uncabbined, unconfined.
I’ll lash all humbug as before,
And brand all knavish scamps,
But freely praise the noble souls
Who send me postage stamps.
And when old PAM goes down below,
His epitaph I’ll pen,
“Here lies the wretch whº pensioned CLose,
And took it away again.”

PUNCH*s ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 3, Monday. The House of Lords, for some reason, always
assumes special care of Ireland, a fact which may account for a few of
the curiosities of Irish political and domestic economy. To-night
their lordships had a debate on the Galway Packet business, Lord
Norman By opening the game, as at chess a feeble pawn makes way
for a knight and bishop. What Normanby said, is, of course, of no
consequence, except as additional evidence of his fatuity. He was
sense-abandoned enough to try a weak taunt at the “inconsistency” of
some of his former colleagues. This from Normanby, who in other
days was a silver-fork Liberal, who was called by O'Connell the
“unparalleled Normanby,” and who went about as the sort of Pretty
Boy of the Melbourne administration delivering gaols, pardoning
political offenders, and generally doing the Liberal sentimentalibus
and who in his late days became courtier to the Italian despots and
advocate in chief against the King of Italy and GARIBALDI. It was
not in human nature, even in that of the good-natured GRANVILLE, not
to give the vane old weathercock a spin for this. The Packet question
was discussed, as was the much more important question whether the
Irish Members had “taken action” upon the subject. On looking to
the division-list Mr. Punch observes that out of the 105 Irish repre-
sentatives, 73 voted against Government on the Paper-duty Bill, and
8 of these had previously voted on the other side. Whereby it is clear
that the Screw has been put on in Ireland, only of course, being an
Irish screw, it turned the wrong way, and there has been : a
scandal and a smash. Lord GRANville stated that Government i.
not come to a decision as to the advisability of a line of Packet service
from Galway to America. What did Mr. Punch vaticinate last week?
The next step will show how Government proposes to arrive at that
decision. LoRD Eglinton was rather tournamenty, and said that
even if the Tories had given the Galway contractors a job, it was not so
bad as the conduct of the Liberals in throwing away the Paper Duty
to please the penny papers and MR. BRight. Lord CLANRicarde
thought the Irish Members were not such “fools” as to suppose that
they could coerce Lond PALMERston. The Postmaster-General
defended the repudiation of the Contract, and declared that the
Galway Company had done nothing in accordance with their agree-
ments, and would not even propose terms by which they would consent
to be finally bound. Load Bhougham thought that FATHER DALY
ought to be brought to the bar of the Commons, to declare whether the
Irish Members had sent him to make a bargain with the Minister. So
ended the discussion, for Norman By, having moved for papers which
did not exist, obligingly expressed his willingness not to press for them.
The º Abolition Bill passed the Commons, amid cheering
from the Liberals. Mr. Punch, with incalculable generosity, instantly
trebled the Salaries of all his Young Men, from WHEwell, down to
the Wiscount, but, with inconceivable sagacity, made the new arrange-
ment commence from the day the Lords should read the Bill the
Second Time. This amiable device ensured the zeal of all his Disin-
º Young Patriots in urging the measure through the Upper
ouse.
Among matters hardly worth mention was a statement of SIR
CHARLEs Wood that there was an Indian Deficit of Two Millions, so
he would just ask for Four, but should want some more by-and-by for
Railways. It was voted, of course. MR. CowPER officially announced
that the Mangle-Wurzle lot are to show their fat beasts and fizz.
ploughs, in the Regent's Park. Mr. Punch only hopes that the pro-
vincial dialects will not be very offensive to MR. Sclatea’s fashionable
animals at the Z. In answer to MR. Tom Duncombe, the Home
SecketARY said that the only way to get rid of Metropolitan Toll-Bars
was for the parishes to agree to charge the road-expenses on the rates.
This is just a bit of the bosh officials think good enough for the House.
A particular road through a certain parish happens to be a great
thoroughfare. The parish gains nothing by the increased traffic, but
the road is cut to pieces every, three months by people going to and
coming from London. Why is the individual parish to bear the
expense?, Roads are a national concern. The Pagan, Romans knew
this, and their roads are good now. The Christian English do not, and
local Boors are permitted to squabble over rates, while travellers are
up to the axles in muddy cross-lanes.
Really important was Lord John's announcement that we interdict
the Armed Ships and the Privateers belonging to either side in the
American conflict from coming into our Waters with prizes. France
merely excludes their Privateers, after twenty-four hours' shelter.
Mr. Punch doubts whether Cassius will like to put our resolution
into his Clay pipe and smoke it. Yet no one can say that we are in a
hurry to tread on American corns. The House, later in the week, flatly
refused to hear MR. GREgony, who desired to state the case of the
Secessionists.
Tuesday. This FatheR DALY is disinclined to be put down. He
probably sniffs future business in connection with the Galway affair
and desires to stand tofus teres atque rotundus. So he employed, of al
Lords, the exemplary CLANRicarpe to make a speech for him, and to
say that the Father meant nothing like putting the Irish Screw on
LoRD PALMERston, but only that "action” was to be “taken” in a
national way. LoRD BRough AM did not exactly put his fingers to his
nose at this statement, because taking such action, or sight, would not
have been in accordance with the habits of the Aristocracy, but he
intimated that he had lived some time in the world, and soon. Mr.
Punch does not see what this Priest has to do with these American
boats, except, to be sure, that they go to “Mass.”
LoRD Richard GRosvenoR took his seat for Flintshire, where the
Conservatives have been defeated, partly by the exertions of
GLADstone, and partly, it seems, by their own negligence; for the
Tory Liverpool Mail eloquently declares that “no word-painting, nºt
even a scorching sunbeam dipped in scalding gall, could sufficiently
stigmatise the Conservative sneaks.” MR. Whaller fulfilled his
threat of # in at Maynooth, and was promptly sat upon by a
majority of 191 to 114; and then Mr. Dºnºs brought up the case of
the BARon De Bopp, and carried a Select Committee, against the
Government, by 134 to 112. This spectral BARon Bode is the Bodach
Glas for Chancellors of Exchequer.
Wednesday. More very grave speechifying on the Galway Alliance
against PALMenston, and then Members went away to help Paiscs
ALBERT in opening Artauta.
Thursday. Suddenly, and, to human apprehension, at an unfortunate
moment for Italy, the statesman who has worked out her liberation,
expires. After a brief illness, reported to be terminating º:
Count Cavour died, this day. The melancholy event was º y
º to in the House of Lords, by the representatives of all sides
in politics.
ndia claimed the Commons. SIR CHARLEs Wood in three speeche:
introduced three Bills. Most English people have a hazy notion that
the Government of India is somehow managed by a mixture of
Elephants and Cummerbunds, tempered by Adjutants and Juggernauts,
with a final appeal to the Bishop of Calcutta. It is of no use expla
ing to them that SIR. C. Wood's plans are to increase the Legislatiº
Council, to admit natives largely to it and to other important trusº,
and to construct new courts of law. Persons really interested in
subject will read the debate.
The Industrial Schools Bill made progress, Ms. Henley as usual
growling against the power that it is proposed to give the Magistrates
to deal with little offenders whose parents are vicious.
Friday. The event of the night amply justified Mr. Punch's generous

yet subtle dodge. There was a great muster of Peers on the Second
Reading of the Paper Bill. Loap GRANynºus made his speech, and
the Duke of RUTLAND proposed that the Bill should be read a second
time that day six months. Mr. Punch's Young Men stood round the
Throne, and suddenly let fly a volley of winks at Loºp DeRBY. The
EARL winked aesthetically in reply, rose, and dashed into a gallant
attack on Government, Glapston E, and the measure itself. He justi-
fied the Lords for what they had done last year, and said that, though
MR. Gladstone had not been at all grateful for the money they had
saved him, he had taken it. People said, “What a Wonderful Man is
Mr. Gladstone!” and he echoed the sentiment, with the addition,
*What a wonderful body is the House of Commons, to be so cajoled
and juggled by the Wonderful Man!”. He did not see that anybody
would get any good by the Repeal of the Duty (another, volley of
winks #. Mr. P.'s Y. M.) except the Proprietors of the Penny
Papers, and the Band-Box Interest, and he would thank. LoRD GRAN:

the Bill had been thrown out, Ministers would not have resigned;
their only resignation would have been a calm one at the thought of the
benefit conferred on them. The Lords had a perfect right to alter
Money Bills, but it was not expedient to enforce that right. On the
whole, the Government. Finance was all wrong, the remission of the
Paper Duty was foolish extravagance, and the system of annual
instead of permanent taxation was most dangerous—and therefore he
should not permit the Bill to be opposed on the Second Reading, or at
any other stage.
#. Bishops bolted to dinner the moment they found that they
should not be wanted, and most of the Lay Lords were equally coarse
in their tastes; for though very few speeches justify your aggravating
our cook, a smart oration from Lord DERby is a pleasure worth
*i; at the price of an apology to the former artist. There was
some more debating. The Duke of ARGYLL defended the Bill; Lond
GREY scattered sarcasm, and compared the Government, now preach-
ing retrenchment, now vaunting our defences, to the celebrated lawyer
firm in the Antiquary. “When it is fair weather with the client, out
comes the gentleman partner to fawn like a spaniel; when ſoul, forth
bolts the operative brother to pin like a bull-dog.” Loan Grºsville
declared that he had a right to say “wropped,” and demanded whether
he ought to say “Derby” or “Darby,” and told a good story against
EARL Grey; and in this pleasant and dignified way the great Paper
Battle came to an end.
In the Commons, SIR. Robert PEEL, LoRD John Russell, MR. M.
MILNEs, and LoRD PALMERston, spoke like statesmen and gentlemen,
upon the great, loss to Italy. A person, called. The Q'Donoghue
emitted some ultra-montane profanity on the subject. Many worthy
Irishmen have a touch of madness, but we had thought that there were
no Irish Idiots.
MR. CosinghAM denounced the late appointment of GENERAL EDEN
as a most atrocious Horse Guards job, º excessive debility of the
defences offered for it was remarkable. SIR. J.TRELAwny was sar-
castic on certain officers who always raise a howl if a job is pointed at,
and he intimated that they should show more taste, and that their con-
duct made him think that they looked for jobs in their own favour. A
grant of £133,276 was made for the Volunteers, LoRD Elcho speaking
spiritedly and well, and HENRY BERKELEY making great fun of the
eomanry.
Saturday. Great excitement in the City in consequence of the enor-
mous withdrawal of gold from the Bank for the purpose of making the
new payments to Mr. Punch's Young Men. Traffic was entirely sus-
§: and BIRch's had used up eleven large turtles before twelve
O'Clock.
==
Felony v. Fine Arts.
The Government have granted the Royal Irish Academy £100 ayear
for the Recovery of Antiquities in Ireland, through the agency of the
constabulary. This is a new function for a police force, who have
hitherto been employed rather in suppressing vice than in encouraging
virº–who are generally considered fitter for arrests than archaeology,
and more conversant with handcuffs than hand-books. But it is an
Irish fashion to convert things to unheard-of purposes—to use old
hats for repairing broken windows, and to convert jaunting-cars into
en-roosts. One thing, at all events, the constabulary may be relied
on to do for buried treasures of antiquity that may exist in Ireland—
they are certain to take them up.
LaTEs.T. PROM. LaMBETH.
“What’s the row about the Galway job?” asked a young M.P. of
the humorous and honourable Member for Lambeth. “Oh,” replied
the Wiscount, “the scheme was a dead failure; but by getting Govern-
ment aid the directors hoped to Galwaymise it into some vitality.”

BLACK AND WHITE LABOURERS.
BRITONs never will be Slaves, otherwise some of them would be
lad to change places with the Niggers alluded to in one of MR.
ILLIAM Russell's letters from Montgomery to the Times:–
“These people are fed by their master. They have upwards of half-a-pound per
diem of fat pork and corn in abundance. They rear poultry, and sell their chickens
and eggs to the house. They are clothed by their master. He keeps them in sick-
: * health. Now and then there are gifts of tobacco and molasses for the
eserving."
The liability to be sold and cowhided is the only circumstance which
might perhaps prevent the lot of these slaves from being envied by the
British agricultural labourer. Half-a-pound daily of fat pork would
be luxury beyond the dreams of the rustic ironically called a chaw-
bacon, whose grinders have scarcely ever a bit of bacon between them.
Corn in abundance is what he never sees except growing in the fields;
and the idea of rearing poultry, and selling chickens and eggs, he woul
laugh at as a likely joke for #. As to being clothed by his master,
he is too happy to receive a pair of breeches at the meeting of an agri-
cultural society, for having worked on the same farm for half a century.
He is fortunate, in illness, to get a bottle of “stuff” from the Union
Doctor. The children, whom he rears with meritorious industry º
dry bread, hardly know the taste of treacle; and as to tobacco, let him
work as hard as he may he never even receives a quid pro quo.
What Blondin will do Next.
A RUMoUR is afloat that, after his engagement with the Crystal
Palace Company, M. BioNDIN means to make a mid-air voyage over
London, walking on the wires of the Electric District Telegraph,
which now are stretched across the Strand, and well-nigh every
main street.

ut the object of the negotiation was to obtain a contract, and receive
a subsidy without performing the contract. The Galway Subsidy
Company, as it had better be called, wanted to get £6,000 a month for
nothing. FATHER DALY was just the boy to plead the cause.

like to make a rush. But what he does not mean JoHN BAGwell makes more

fascinating manner. How did they yield to it? Not in yielding half-
a-sovereign, for they must have already yielded that, if the cup of tea
was offered them in exchange for it. On the backs of music-books we
see numerous pictures of f.". apparently yielding to the fasci-
nating manner of ladies. The gentlemen are generally represented on
their knees, to the great danger of bursting their tight pantaloons
with their right hands pressed to their hearts, and left hands extende
towards the lady, both hands encased in tense white kid gloves. Their
hats and canes are also generally deposited together with themselves
at the lady's feet. A faint attempt at the expression of wretchedness
appears in the slight contraction of their brows, ruffling the serenity of
their otherwise regular features. The lady, attired in the newest
fashionable style, is usually depicted sitting with her face half-averted
from her suppliant; one of her jewelled hands held out towards him,
and the other uplifted in slight surprise, subdued by the controlling
influence of educated deportment. Her head is hung a little on one
side; her eyes are elevated as though with a serious aspiration for the
grace of demeanour proper to the occasion. The varieties of fascinating
manner, which, portrayed in gayest colours, attract the eye in piano-
shop windows, are so many modifications of posture and gesture.
Elegant postures and gestures seem to be the Mesmerism of fashion-
able life, Did gesticulations and attitudes of that sort constitute the
fascinating manner which few persons at the French fancy bazaar were
able to resist? If so, by what demonstrations was the inability of
resistance to it expressed? They were perhaps worth seeing.
Our surmises derive a seeming confirmation from the conclusion of
the paragraph above quoted:—
“The Bazaar will be continued this day and Saturday; and on the latter day
there will be a tombola for the magnificent objects presented by the Empenoa and
the EMPREss.”
Did the gentlemen who took part in the tombola tumble on their
knees. before the ladies whose fascinating manner they were incapable
of resisting?

GENEROSITY, we are told, consists not so much in the
value of what you confer as in the manner in which you
bestow it; thus, in giving a poor man a kick, the great
point to be observed is, whether you present it to him with
your hand, or your boot.”
* We must come to the rescue of our highly moral, but somewhat
slangy, contributor, and apologetically state that, in the argot current
in St. Giles' and at the Universities, a “kick" is a small coin that
answers to the value of a Sixpence.—ED.
A BOLD TITLE FOR A BOOK.
A LITERARY Advertisement announces the publication of-
“This day, in Fcap. 8vo, Price 6s, cloth,
BOTANY BAY, AND OTHER POEMS.”
Then comes the name of the author—a º whose experience
of Botany Bay is evidently quite respectable; or else the reader might
be disposed to conjecture that the other poems above referred to are
mostly writings of a peculiar character, with remarkable titles, as, for
instance, The Mill, A Turn at the Crank, The Oakum-Pickers, The Time
of Trouble, and Siz Months in the Jug; and as Australia has for some
time past declined to receive our involuntary emigrants, the pre-
sumption would be that the author of Botany Bay is an old offender.
THE BOTANICAL TURKISH BATH.
THE Turkish Bath is just now having, a great run, by reason of
causing a copious flow of perspiration, and thus relieving diseases of
repletion, which are not uncommon; resulting chiefly from over-exer-
tion at the table. It is to be feared that this valuable remedial re-
source will by-and-by fall into disrepute in consequence of the abuse
of it producing disorganisation of the liver, and other diseases of hot
climates. A tolerably efficient substitute for the Turkish Bath will be
found in the Victoria Regia House at Kew ; and if the man in
attendance would but turn the garden-engine hose upon the spectators,
there would be little beyond shampooing to distinguish the former
from the latter sudatory: which has the advantage of being gratuitous.

Jokes Served up at the Shortest Notice.
SoME one was reading out of a newspaper that a man,
who was supposed to be a lunatic, had flung himself from
the Pont des Arts into the Seine, when Wiscount WILLIAMs,
who, if there is a mistake to be made, is always ready, ex-
claimed, without the slightest hesitation: “That only corro-
borates the truth of the Poet's line, “Mens insans in corport
in-Seine-o.” For the first time, we regretted that the learned
Wiscount had not expressed himself in English.
JOHNSON AND BLONDIN.
Ertracted, by permission, from the latest edition of Boswell's
Life of DR. Johnson.
THE next day was Saturday, and I called upon my revered friend in
the Temple, and after some hesitation I mentioned that I had pur.
chased tickets of admission to the Crystal Palace, to see the ſeats of
the French acrobat, BLONDIN, who was to exhibit that day. I said
that f did not know whether f should go or not. -
“Sir,” said DR. JoHNson, “why do you tell me a lie? You know
that you have resolved upon witnessing this Frenchman's exhibition,
and ū. weakness of the desire is less culpable than the cowardice of
the mendacity that would veil it.”
I admitted that I had a curiosity to behold an instance of the power
of courage and skill in surmounting difficulties of a grave nature....
“You are a humbug,” said my venerated friend. “You care nothing
for the fellow’s courage or skill, but you have a vulgar desire to ;
with the multitude, and perhaps a concealed hope that you may
present at a painful catastrophe.”
I urged that the PRINCE of WALEs, my Sovereign's eldest son, had
witnessed the sight, and rewarded the performer with a medal.
My honoured friend became exceedingly *}; “Do not,” he said,
“drag the name of a member of the Royal Family of these realms
(royal, de facto, he added with a murmur to himself) into your miser-
able plea. ...The PRINCE OF WALEs, in not refusing to join in a trans-
atlantic holiday, was gracefully discharging an instalment of the duty
for which he was accredited to the West. You have no business on
Sydenham Hill, and if you had a medal, so far from "...i it upon
BLONDIN, you would stick it upon your own hat, and repeat the Paoli
farce. Let me hear no such nonsense.”
But my character, as is well known, is one of invincible fortitude
and pertinacity, and when I know myself to be in the right, I am not
easily put down.. I therefore returned to the charge with a courage
which almost astonished myself.
: PINDAR sang the praises of horse-racing, DR, Johnson,” I replied.
“A horse is not a Frenchman, nor are you a PINDAR,” retorted my
revered friend, with that quickness which belonged to him. The lively
sally restored his good humour, for he added, “you are not even a
PINDAR of Wakefield, though in your heart you despise GoLDy's Wicar
of that locality.”
..This was unjust, and I told him that though I did not think, so
highly of GoLDSMITH's little tale as some did, I was far from despising
an elegantly written and moral fable. I then said, “DR. Johnson,
will you do me the favour to come and see Blondin f"
He laughed, and said I was putting him to the experimentum Crucis—
which I afterwards thought a most felicitous phrase, because the
Frenchman had to “cross", the transept., I doubt not that I have
lost hundreds of equally good things through my culpable negligence
of transcription.
“Why, Sir,” he said, “if you had asked me to purchase a ticket
for this sight, I should have peremptorily refused, because I am not
justified in contributing to bribe a fellow-creature, though only a
Frenchman and a mountebank, to risk the loss of his life. But as gos
have paid for the tickets, and as I shall not repay you, the onus is with
yourself, and I will ..º. you.” -
“We are at the Crystal Palace,” I remarked, as the train entered
the station. - - - -
f º * building is not of Crystal, nor is it a Palace,” said my illustrious
rien
The name, I said humbly, was given by Mr. Punch. -
“Mr. Punch is a great authority,” said DR. Johnson, removing his
hat for a moment, “and I willingly accept his nomenclature. The
fact had escaped me.”
So ready was he to own an error, when it was properly brought
before him.
“Mr. Punch,” he continued, “is most fortunate in selecting deno-
minations. It was he who gave the name of Arcadia to that new
arcaded Garden and locality at South Kensington; a name which, I
observe the journals are all adopting without acknowledgment of the
original inventor. But few can so well afford to be robbed, though
the wealth of the Bank of England is no excuse for the criminality of
the burglar.”
We proceeded across the beautiful garden, and my revered friend,
whose classic recollections were ever ready, pointed to the Mercury on
one of the water-temples, and remarked that there was a BLONDIN
ready perched. I said *šta in eternum,” but was immediately and
sternly rebuked by my honoured friend for light use of a word signi-
fying eternity. “But,” he added, playfully, “do not be cast down,
for you yourself are an everlasting donkey.” This re-assured me, and
we ascended to the gallery, and took our seats. Gazing down upon
the vast area, on the sides of which, and around it, were nearly ten
thousand persons, DR. Johnson whispered, slily,
“Do you think as many persons would come to see you supported
by a jº. cord?”
I felt hurt, for though I am conscious of many short-comings, it was
wounding to think that the greatest moralist of the age had ever
seriously contemplated my coming to be hanged.
“Do not be a fool,” said DR, Johnson, kindly. "You will repose
in your Scottish mausoleum, followed by an incalculable array of semi-
denuded Caledonian boors; so be happy, and survey mankind.” -
The Frenchman came upon the i. ran, tumbled, stood on his
head, º: to slip, lay down, walked backwards blindfolded, and
performed his other extraordinary #. feats at an height of one
hundred and eighty feet from the floor that had been cleared below.
Military music played, the vast assembly applauded, and tears came
into my eyes.
“What are you blubbering for P” said my illustrious friend. “Do you
envy that poor acrobat his triumph, or do you imagine that you
yourself could perform those feats better? In the first alternative the |
sentiment is unworthy, in the second the vanity is egregious.”
Thus did he ever seek to improve my mind and heart, and what do

I did not dare to remind him that he had summarily crushed my own

Scottish ale with me, and seasoned it by a good humoured jibe at my
selecting liquor bearing the name of my country. - -
“The health of the French acrobat, with the American reputation,

“Drunk by DR. Johnson,” I ventured to add, “whose reputation is
neither French, nor American, nor Scotch, nor English, but universal.”
“You are a thundering humbug,” said my revered friend, smiling.
I have reason to believe that he was pleased, for he permitted me to
pay the cab from the terminus to the Temple.
A BRIGHTENER AT BRIGHTON.
E chanced the other
evening to converse
with a young lady,
to whom—when we
had talked about the
weather and the pic-
tures, and asked her
how she liked the
last Crystal Palace
Concert, and if she
thought M. FEch-
TER as funny as
Charles EAN,
and how many pairs
of gloves she had
lost upon the Derby,
and whether she in-
tended to pay any
of her bets, and how
-- it was we had not
- seen her at LoRD
SN ooz LE's, and
whether , she was
going to MR. STUR-
GEON's pic-nic, and
could she play well
at Aunt Sally, and what she thought of M.BLONDIN, and the spoon:
shaped bonnet, and if she fancied the Gorillas would look prettier if
they shaved—we put the question, had she been to Brighton yet this
summer, and this leading conversation to seaside things in general,
we were startled by her saying that she “never thaw the theal” . In
our surprise at this confession we were so brutal as to ask her, what
could be her age; whereupon she simply told us she was “theyenteen
latht Thenthuth:” which we believe to be within not more than five
years of the truth. -- -
As we learnt that this young lady had lived half her life in London,
her statement that she never yet had seen the sea, appeared to our
mind so incredible that we well-nigh, lost our character for gallantry
Z
/
by doubting it; but having now a full belief in its veracity we do not
hesitate to place it upon record here in Punch. . This we do that we
may use it as a text for a short sermon which we think it well to
reach to fathers of a family, anent the good effects of a draught of
resh sea air, and the cheap rate at which that saline dose is now pro-
curable. For half-a-crown a head, O Cockney Paterfamilias, you may
take your wife and grown-up daughters down to Brighton, and there
let them fill their lungs for nine hours at a stretch with enough sea
air on Mondays to last them through the week. Half-a-crown a head
for health and happiness combined! where is the doctor that could
sell you such a dose? However beneficial it may be in its effects,
doctor's stuff is anything but pleasant to one's palate: but a mouthful
of sea air leaves no unpleasant taste behind it, and they who are pre-
scribed it are very often clamorous to have another dose.
Prevention is at all times far better than cure; and men who fear
lest their small income may scarce suffice for their large family, had
better guard against the chance of having a big doctor's bill by taking
all their children at half-price down to Brighton, and infecting them
with health so as to make them illness-proof. By giving them a good
and civilest of Traffic Managers), have brought sea air within the reach
of everybody's lungs, and the man who would refuse his children a day's
breathing-time is unworthy of the name of SMITH or BRown which he
was born to. “To Hastings and back” for three and sixpence each, and
“to Portsmouth and back” for the same extensive sum, are trips within
the means of only millionnaires. But “to Brighton and back” for half-
a crown a-head (children half-price, if under twelve years old), is an
excursion that the modestest of mothers may prescribe, for the health
of BETsey-JANE or dear AMELIAR-ANN. . Their big brothers too, who
earn perhaps a pound a week, would do wisely to lay by a certain
portion of that sum, until, they can afford to take their sweetheart
downto Brighton, and give her half-a-crown's worth of health by the sea
air. Moreover, shrivelled lawyers' clerks who scribble out at elbows
for some ten dull hours a day would be the brighter in their looks and
wits for nine hours spent at Brighton. A brightener at Brighton does
both brain and body good, and, now it is obtainable at half-a-crown
* all bodies blest with brains of course will take advantage

CONSERWATORY CONCERTS.
To the thousand and one attractions of the charming Crystal Palace,
the directors are this summer adding a dozen more, in the form of
Friday concerts of good operatic music, whereat both listeners and
loungers will find good entertainment for the crown the entertainment
costs. To hear the lovely melodies of WEBER and MozART warbled by
such singers as TITIENs and GRISI, is surely worth five shillings to
those who can afford it; and far more worth five shillings when one's
seat is in a greenhouse, than when it is in the close confinement of a
| concert-room, and one must put on a dress coat and a white choker
before going there. It is only in the pleasant concert-room at
Sydenham that your lungs can breathe sweet air the while your ears
inhale sweet music; and instead of glaring gas and dingy dusty walls
i. * your eyes have dainty flowers and fresh green foliage to
OOK alº.
“Oh, but then the Crystal Palace is such a way from town, and it
interferes with business sadly to get down to it.” Well, MR. SMITH,
but how about the Derby Day and Ascot? Do your yearly visits there
not interfere with business? How is it you can spare the time to go
down to the Downs, and yet can't afford to give yourself a half day
here with GR1s1? You won't hear her next year, mind... These really
are the last of her last final farewell leavetakings. And if your income-
tax won't suffer you to take a box at MR. Gye's, the least that you can
do for your neglected wife and daughters is to take them down some
day to a Conservatory Concert. Say you are a lawyer, you will find
the trip to Sydenham a very easy “motion” if you take a first-class
ticket, and the hour or two you’ll spend there will be such a
“refresher” to your jaded brain and nerves that when you get back to
your chambers you will work tenfold the faster for it. Say you are
dyspeptic, the half-hour on the rail may prove a “movement cure,” and
the sight of freshly-blooming flowers º faces will do wonders for you.
Or say you are a fop and want to show off your fine whiskers, where
can you air them better than in the Centre Transept, where you are
not only sure of being stared at, but, being under a glass-case, are safe
from getting wetted? -
The feet of the bold BLoNDIN seem just now more attractive to the
million, or the thousands, than the throats of such sweet songstresses
as Titless and Gris. But to jir Punch's mind there is something
far more tempting in good music than good rope-walking; and
although the latter may by small punsters be viewed as a higher walk
of art, Mr. Punch cannot allow that there is anything sublime in it.
In the strains of WEBER, MEYERBEER, RossINI, and MozART there is,
to Mr. Punch's thinking, a far higher delight than in the strain upon
the rope that bears up Monsieur Blondin, and whatever be the
height of danger he may reach, the taste that cultivates good music is
certainly more elevated.
Archimedes and Disraeli.
“Give me a row orw, and I will move the world,” said ARCHIMEDes.
“Give me ground to support a Lever, and I'll upset the Govern-
ment,” said DisRAELI.

THE COMPROMISE IN KENSINGTON GARDENS.
Those of the º classes whose altitude is exhibited principally
in “riding the high horse,” will be glad to see that, in spite of the
unanimous outcries of pedestrian snobs, MR, CowPER has determined
on re-introducing that noble animal and his rider into Kensington
Gardens. All, however, who entertain a proper contempt for the
common people, will deplore the weakness which has induced MR.
CowPER to yield so far to clamour as to change the direction of the
ride. It is now, no longer to cross the path of a flower-garden fre-
quented by the despicable walking community, and to run in the form
of a long wide excoriation of bare ground, hedged with hurdles, athwart
the turf of what the wretches consider one of the most Fº
parts of the Gardens. “The entrance to the ride,” said the Chief
Commissioner of Works, the other night, “would be under the dry
arch of the bridge which divided Kensington Gardens from Hyde
Park, on the south side.” He also confessed that it “would not
interfere with the privacy, such as it was, of a great portion of the
Gardens.” These statements may give the superior equestrians too
much reason to apprehend that the new horse-ride will be somewhat
out of the people's way. The select will be disgusted with MR.
CowPER for conceding too much to the mob. We may, however, be
mistaken. The new ride may be so arranged as still to constitute a
considerable eyesore, as the rabble are accustomed to call any kind of
object which, they fancy, spoils their prospect, interposed between it
and their mobility. As if they had any capacity to appreciate a view,
or, having any, as if it could be entitled to the least respectſ
M.R.CowPER professes to have been induced to transfer the Kensington
horse-ride chiefly by objections “proceeding from certain fond parents
and timid nurse-maids in regard to the dangers to children which
might result from the want of experience or adroitness on the part of
the equestrians.” This is all very well to º: but the horse-ride
would no doubt have remained where it was, if all the noise that had
been made against it had proceeded from timid nursemaids and fond
parents. A petition signed by some 40,000 people in the habit of
visiting Kensington Gardens, and quietly enjoying themselves there in
their own low way, would, if the present horse-ride should prove a
nuisance in their stupid eyes, too probably again defeat a gentleman-
like attempt to enable the aristocracy of Rotten Row to disport them:
selves in the face, and to the annoyance, of the plebeians who frequent
Kensington Gardens, and presume to object to the disturbance of their
quietude by the animated spectacle of splendid horsemanship gratui-
tously presented to them by the higher classes.
One who Draws it Beautifully Mild.
AN American was asking, “who was the greatest stump-orator in
England?” when a gentleman, who looked something like an artist,
for he had long hair, and his collar was fully, thrown back tº
display the artistic arrangement of his beard, said, “Taking a ‘stump,
Sir, as an instrument that is used in drawing, I should say that SIR
CHARLEs EastLAKE, Sir, was the greatest ‘stump-orator” of this, or

FOR BLONDIN.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 10, Monday. The Lords have been very uneasy over this Bank-
ruptcy Bill, and to-night the Government were beaten by 98 to 61 on a
clause proposed by LoRD CHELMsFord, for preventing the Act from
having a retrospective effect. It was decided that Debtors and
Creditors should start fair, from the time of the Bill becoming law.
The Commons had a smart debate on the Bill for Appropriating
the four seats vacant by the doom now irrevocably pronounced upon
Saint Albans and Sudbury. EARL JERMyN made a plaintive appeal
against punishing the latter place so dreadfully, but nobody had a
word to say for the borough of the First Christian martyred in England.
#:#. pro criminibus disfranchizatum may now be inscribed on the
Town Halls of those places. We have not heard that either suffers
much from having been saved from occasional Saturnalia, Sudbury con-
tinues to be the stupidest town in England, and St. Albans is thinking
more of spiritual than temporal matters, and hopes to have its
noble Abbey, elevated into a Cathedral, and to have a Bishop
who shall take half of the overgrown diocese of DR. WIGRAM
The battle to-night was on the allotment of the seats. A new
Member for the West Riding, and one for South Lancashire
were agreed to after some debate. But when it was proposed to unite
Chelsea and Kensington, into one º and give Members to the
Union, the House rose in its wrath, “What?” said the British Par.
liament, “haye we not had enough of men of the type of Mister
Roupell, and HARVEY Lewis, and HARPER Twelvet Rees the bug.
destroyer, and JABez INwards, and Nicholar the Skinnan, and
DIFFAngeR the Spouter, and Cox of Finsbury, but you must go and
make another borough that will swamp the educated classes, and elect,
by force of publicans, two more of the breed? By the Nine Gods,
no!’. Wainly did the Government shuffle; it was not a question of
politics, but of social endurance. Men rushed together, to prevent
the creation of more Metropolitan Members, as they rush, in the
instinct of self-preservation, to blackball a Club candidate who is
known to put his knife. into his mouth. The majority showed the
terror into which Parliament had been thrown. Government were
beaten by more than One Hundred. They begged time to consider
what they should do, and MR. DisbAELI graciously granted them a
week. Mr. Punch has rarely seen such an instant and spontaneous
demonstration of the feeling of the country in regard to the Metro-
politan Constituencies. If the latter had any pluck, or sense of
shame, they would call meetings, and seriously consider their position,
and see whether, by purifying the Parliamentary roll, they could not
do something to reinstate themselves in the opinion of the nation;
The fate of St. Albans and Sudbury is far happier than that of
boroughs permitted to exist upon such contemptuous terms.
Tuesday. The DUKE of SoMERset declared that the Navy was in
fine order, that the harrior would be ready one of these days, and
that the Government were resolved to maintain the Naval Supremacy
of England. With true official instinct, he abused ADMIRAL EFLIQTT
for having visited the French dockyards, and for having reported what
he saw there. The Duke intimated that the Admiral ought to have
said nothing publicly, but should have called on LoBD DeRBY, and
told him, and Lord DeRBy should have called on Lord PAL-
MERston and told him, and then LoRD PALMERSTON could have sent
for the Duke of SoMERset, and told him. Doubtless this is the gen:
tlemanly and high-bred way of doing business, but when the welfare of
a nation is at stake, Mr. Punch can forgive a blunt sailor for sailing
right in the wind's eye, contrary to all diplomatic nauticalities.
And joy to every scribbling Coon
Who wastes the midnight taper,
On this eleventh day of June
The Lords they danced to GLADstone's tune,
And smashed the Tax on Paper.
The Chicory Budget Bill was read a Third Time and passed. One
young author instantly sent for MR. BARRy, and requested him to
make plans for a mansion which the former proposed to erect in Hyde
Park Gardens; another has written to say that if there is any difficulty
about finding a Master for the Flat Hat Hounds, he will take them
and hunt that country, as he means to buy an estate there; and a
third is building a Steam Yacht, in which he intends to pervade the
Mediterranean, sending home his copy regularly every week in his

come back.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then the Lords had a Ragged-School Row, and it is remarkable
how the minds of men adapt themselves to the subject of discussion.
Whenever this question comes up, some of the Lords are sure to begin
abusing one another, much as the ragged objects of the charity would
do under excitement. The topic is not an agreeable one, especially in
hot weather, but the most fastidious of their Lordships will listen to
one of their own body, LoBD MACAULAY, and when they are inclined
to evade their duty to the Dangerous Classes, let them recollect what
LoRD T. B. M. wrote of the somewhat anarchical period between the
Abdication of JAMEs and the Accession of WILLIAM. “On such
occasions it will ever be found that the Human Vermin, which, ne-
glected by Ministers of State and Ministers of Religion, and barbarous
in the midst of civilisation, burrows among all physical and all moral
pollution in the cellars and garrets of great cities, all at once rises into
a terrible importance.” The LoRD SHAFTEs BURY and the Duke of
Newcastle exchanged their usual defiances over the Report of the
Education Commissioners, but the Duke had the best of it—he is not
one of those men whose every Goose is a Swan, but he is quite content
to regard goose as goose, and a very good bird into the bargain, though
i. º: hungry gentleman said, a little too much for one and not enough
or two.
At a morning sitting (why are there not more morning and fewer
evening sittings?) the Commons considered the Criminal Law Con-
solidation Bills, and very good business was done. In the evening
LoRD John Russell announced that the Powers have agreed that
Syria shall in future be kept in order by a Christian Governor, of
course a servant of the Sultan. It is a comfort to know that there will
be one Christian in Syria.
Give a man-with-a-grievance an inch, and if he won't take an ell he’ll
make a grab at it. BARBER, an attorney, some years ago was foolish
enough to be the innocent party to frauds of which, at the time, he
was found guilty by a jury. He was sentenced to transportation.
But as it was afterwards shown that he had been wrongfully accused
of complicity in the fraud, he was pardoned, and a sum of £5000 was
roperly granted to him out of the public money, to compensate him
or his unmerited, sufferings. Now BARBER wants more... This is a
little too good, and the House negatived the demand without division.
Wednesday. Theology, as usual, on the Parliament Sunday. Shall
witnesses who object to oaths, be relieved from the necessity of swear-
ing on criminal trials? For the relief it was insisted that it is hard to
make a man's right to the protection of the law depend upon his or
another's “speculative opinions,” and that at this moment many persons
are exposed to danger of life, and property, because it is known that they
will not declare their belief in a future state. Against the relief it
was contended that the mass of persons whose evidence comes before
the Courts, have little respect for truth, but have a dread of perjury,
and that to remit the oath would be to diminish the chances of getting
at the fact. It was also urged that persons who were incapable of
recognising the leading truths of religion were semi-lunatics, who
deserved no special law in their favour. The case of those who are
perfectly truthful, and believe in religion, and therefore object to
oaths (considering that “Swear not at all ” does not mean that we are
not to swear at everybody, but that swearing itself is inhibited), is a
hard case; and unless solved on the broad principle of the convenience
of the majority, can scarcely be said to be dealt with. The SolicitoR-
GENERAL, who is a Methodist, avowed his conviction that oaths were
very valuable, and SiR G. frwis took the same side. A Bili of
*Piuvº, for substituting affirmations was rejected by 136
to 66.
The SPEAKER went to the House of Ilords, and when he came back,
announced that the Royal Assent had been given to the Paper-Duty
Bill. MR. GLADston E immediately burst into song in the character
of the Peri, - .
Joy, joy for ever, my task is done,
The Bill is passed, and the game is won 1
Oh, am I not happy, I am, I am,
To thee, dear Paper, how dark and sad
Are the war-taxed Teas from Chingchongeram,
Or the crystal Sugars from old Trinidad.
Joy, joy, for ever, my task is done,
The Bill is passed, and the game is won.
Thursday. The EARL of LEITRIM, (did anybody ever hear of him—
he is called CLEMENTs in the British Peerage?) had abused CHIEF
Justice MonahAN, for some charge, in which he had stated that there
was a diminution in the crime of a certain Irish locality. This the
Earl denied, and was very uncivil to the judge. LoRD CAMPBELL and
others were down upon his Lordship, and very high testimony was
borne on all sides to the wisdom and discretion of the Judge, testimony
which of course implied that LoRD LEITRIM had neither wisdom nor
discretion. He was scolded so severely that he announced his inten-
tion of holding his tongue, but was of course much too obstinate to
own that he had made a mistake. Then came another Irish affair—a
ticket of leave having been granted to a man who had pleaded guilty
of conspiracy to murder. The DUKE or NEWCASTLE explained that it
was all right, and noble Lords seemed to derive comfort from hearing
that the scoundrel had left Ireland, and settled in Manchester.
The Commons discussed India.
Friday. Some of HENRY or Exeter's flock petition that his diocese
may be split into two parts. We should like to hear DR. Phillpotts
(yes, Wiscount, that is the right spelling, and nothing is more vulgar,
or a clearer sign of that insolent negligence which is the , essence
of vulgarity, than mispelling a name—do we ever mispel, yours,
WILLIAMs?) on the point. Ha! haſ not to say hee!' hee! When the
Ministers got their majority, notwithstanding FatheR DALY, what
said Mr. Punch * Of course there was no bargain, such a thing would
have been shameful. But he should not go, he said, into hysterics of
astonishment, if a Committee, or a Commission, or something, inquired
into the question, and if it were found that certain Irishmen knew that
justice would be done to Oireland. This was weeks ago. To-night
there was a Galway debate, and Government, in the most handsome
manner, conceded a Committee, and if the Committee reports that the
Galway Company may be indulged with another trial, it will be very
wonderful if the Government should take the same indulgent view.
But a bargain, Oh, dear no! Perish ten Ministries, and so on; and
here, waiter, bring us a Gin Sling, and get us our cigar-case:
By the way, MR. Disraeli made himself very angry to-night, and
accused Lord PALMERston of having hunted the late excellent MR.
STAFFord to death, a statement indignantly denied by the Wiscount
and contradicted by personal friends of MR. STAProRD, who attributed
his premature death to other causes than the attacks upon his Admi-
ralty errors. Let us rather remember the gallant services he did in the
Crimea—not in fighting, but in the cause of humanity.
A VOLUNTEER WHERE LEAST EXPECTED.
We are glad to lay before the reader the following curious paragraph.
We have found a friend where we least expected it.
“MR. W. WILLIAMs (Punch's favourite Wiscount) concurred in the eulogium which
had been passed on the Volunteer corps, and expressed a hope that the Government
would not refuse to accede to the proposal of the noble Lord (ELCHo) the member
or Haddingtonshire. (Hear, Hear.)"
The above hearty co-operation was given on the sum of £133,27
being proposed as the vote for the Volunteer º It has been
universally supposed (and we have aided in no small degree in foster-
ing that supposition) that the Member for Lambeth was such a rigid
unsparing economist that he would rub off the gilding of the State-
carriage, if he thought he could save a few half-crowns every year by
it. However, it will be seen from the above that though the noble
Wiscount is generally opposed to everything like “profligate expen-
diture,” still he is not averse to the outlay of what he considers is
worthily laid out for the defence of his country. He consents to pay
for the Volunteers (and we have it on the authority of MR. T. G.
BARING himself that, including the wear and tear of the rifles, they do
not cost more than one pound per head per annum) on the same sensible
rinciple that he does not object to pay his police-rates; the first, he
É. sense enough to know, protect his country from invaders, and the
second protect his house from thieves. Bravo, Wiscount; we beg to
hail you as a Man, and a Brother, and a Wolunteer | We have often
drilled you, and now, if you will only put yourself at the head of a
Volunteer regiment, you may drill us as often as you like.
The last Census informs us that after SMITH and Jones, there is no
name so common in England and Wales (the latter contributing .
liberally) as WILLIAMs. Why not start a . exclusively composed,
then, of WILLIAMses? and put yourself at the head of them, Wiscount!
Out of respect to one who spread great distinction on the name, it
might be called “The First Boiled Beefs.” The motto, without a
doubt, should be, “Cut and Come Again;” and the arms, in addition
to the rifle, should be a long carving-knife, with a big pewter-plate, by
way of a shield. If the subject were only well stirred, we are confident
that the “Boiled Beefs” would come out uncommonly strong, especially
when they were mustered in their full strength.
Selling an Uncle.
A REMARKABLE case occurred, the other day, at Marlborough-street
Police Court. One Louis MoUIVILLE, alias MoUILLIER, described as
a Bavarian, of No. 4, Kennington-green, was brought before MR.
Ty Rwhitt, charged with fraudulently obtaining from MR. Robert
ATTENBorough, pawnbroker, of Greek-street, Soho, the sum of 30l.,
by palming upon him in pledge two hogsheads of water for so much
port wine. MR. ATTENBoRough, in short, supposed that the de-
fendant had spouted wine, but discovered that º: had only spouted
water. The records of meteorology afford no parallel to this instance
of a water-spout.

- - N action was lately
tried at the Common
Pleas to recover da-

presentation of the
value of a milk busi-

peared that—
“Although 16 barn gal-
lons of pure milk were
manufactured into 24 of
ordinary milk, yet no-
thing but pure water was
used in the adulteration
of it.”
The milkman has
been shamefully ca-
lumniated. How re-
peatedly has he not
been accused of using
calves' brains, chalk,
plaster of Paris, and
other ingredients that
only convert the milk-
pail into a kind of
whitened sepulchre to

ought to be thankful to the milkmen for using it in such extreme moderation. Providing
it be not Thames water, you could not have a more harmless, or a more agreeable adultera-
tion. The character of the marchand de lait, which it has been the special fashion of the tea-
table to blacken as much as possible, has come
almost milk-white out of the above lacteal
analysis. With that third of water, he has
almost washed his hands of all the dirt and filth
that he has been popularly and falsely accused
of dealing in.
However, we do not see why milk should
always be condemned to meet with a watery
grave at all. In Paris, and other large towns
in France, certain octroi, or medical officers go
round, and test the contents of the cans by
means of a lactometer. On the proof of any
adulteration, the pails are emptied into the
gutter, and the vendor severely fined. Why
couldn't some such easy plan be tried over here?
If in every quart we purchase of milk one-third
of it has been borrowed from the pump, it is
almost tantamount to paying for one's water-
rates twice over.

ants, can they expect us to do otherwise?
A FRENCH WONDER.
In looking over the Report of the recent debate in the French
Legislative Body on the Army and Navy Estimates, we were agree.
ably astonished by some remarks which fell from M. LaRRABURE.
This gentleman, speaking of the wars into which, of late years,
France has plunged for ideas, actually uttered the following sensible
words:—
“Were the accounts of these expeditions cast up, the total would astonish,
perhaps alarm, Frenchmen, by showing how much blood and treasure had been
spent in different parts of the world, which, if they had been applied to improve.
ments at home, would have realised wonders in France.”
Blood makes muscle, and muscle does work, recollect cavillers, who
may demur, with a grin, to the idea of the application of that fluid to
domestic improvements. . But what wonderful words are the fore.
going to have proceeded from a Frenchman's mouth ! In themselves,
regarded, from our point of view, to be sure, they are commonplaces.
So, are the questions, “How do you do?” “I hope you are pretty
well?” But you would be ºd to hear them addressed to you by
your terrier.
n the same rational and extraordinary strain M. LARRABURE
Continues:—
“It may be answered that “France is rich enough to pay for glory.” With
such pompºus puerilities fine speeches may be made, but thoy risk the mismanage-
ment of national affairs.”
Here we have a Frenchman whose moral and intellectual faculties
are really sufficiently developed to enable him to despise glory, to see
the ludicrousness of pompous puerilities, and to regard them with
contempt. instead of admiration! A Frenchman who thinks and ex-
presses himself like a fellow-creature!
Some little exception, however, may be taken to this position:—
“France is too easily led by witticisms; it is to be desired that a little common
sense were mixed with them. Wit is all very well in its place, but in the manage-
ment of public affairs, common sense and sound calculations are preferable”
Nº. M. LARRABURE, it is not wit that misguides France. It is
ſº Sir, that profound gravity which cannot see the fun of fighting
9, the gratification of vain-glory—the fun that such folly affords
Mephistopheles. France has not wit enough to perceive the jokes–
conscription and taxation—which her rulers enjoy at her expense:
After all, however, M. LARRABURE's remarks on his, country's, wit
were perhaps ironical; for his next observation proves him capable of
saying a smart thing:—
“At the risk of appearing prosaic, of the earth, earthy, M. LARRABURE would
alter the phrase, and say, "France is rich enough in glory to think now of her
finances.'"
If grave France had only the wit to understand and appreciate that
last-quoted saying of M. LARRABURE's, common sense and sound
calculations would be sufficiently conspicuous in the management...of
her public affairs, whilst we should be enabled to reduce a warlike
expenditure which is much too serious for merry England. . -
If the British Public took as much interest in mental as it does in
material curiosities, M. LARRABURE should come over here and be ex-
hibited. A philosopher would much rather go to hear him reason,
than to see a talking fish, or M. BLONDIN dance on the high rope.
A PUBLIC FAWOURITE.
In the description of the Ascot Races, we, notice that there was
resent “MR. MERRY's Buckstone.” This strikes us rather as tauto-
ogy—for when you say Buckstone, of course every one understands
that it means “merry.” The two, in the public estimation, are almost
synonymous. He is Merry all over—points, pace, style, action, ste
ping, hair, collar, pins, everything. Further on, we read that Buck.
stone was “foaled in France.” Now, that is too bad. France, not
content with sending us actors, whom we are gracious enough to allow
to come in and win, is actually trying now - -
own original stock of high-bred comedians. We protest against this,
and maintain that Buckstone was born, and bred, and, raised, in
England, and that all the principal engagements in which he has dis-
tinguished himself have taken place in England, where he has always
been one of the first in the race of public favour. Is not the name
thoroughly an English one? whereas the probabilities are that if he had
been “foaled in France,” he would have been christened there also.
Translate Buck and stone into French, and join the two words
together, and you get an incomprehensible jumble that you would not
give to a single living creature.

eat the rat, that did something else; and of another, cow which having
attained a venerable age, expired in consequence of having incautiously
listened to a certain dismal tune; but I do not recognise either of
these creatures in the Cotter's Cow. I am half inclined to imitate the
learned critic, who asked the painter to reverse the positions of the
Duke and Duchess in his portrait, and recommend, MR. WEEBE, to
bring his cottage girls into the foreground, and keep his cows for the
middle distance.
“Pastimes in Times Past (177) sounds like a pun, but to paint the
sure of, laughing at his leading articles?. In a word, what would
SoAPY be without CHEEsy, or CHEEsy without SoAPYP Don't we
know that the possibility of a division in the House is one of the best
guarantees for judicious legislation? The principle that, holds good
respecting Politics and Theology, is no less applicable in the world of
Art. The great element of 98. has effect alike in the pulpit,
the Forum, and the Studio. e moustachioed students of the R.A.
follow this and that style as befits our temperament, our purse, or
education. With some of us the Prae-Raphaelite manner, with others
the Post-Peruginesque, or Ante-penultimate-Caraccian style may be in
vogue; but whichever we follow, be sure a healthy spirit of rivalry
exists, and the public taste will be in proportion to the pictures which
are submitted to its notice. Thus when at the R. A. Exhibition I find
MR. Jones delineating a terrific combat between the Sowars and the
7th Hussars in the Raptee river, I fancy some tough old Indian warrior,
criticising (somewhat harshly perhaps) the treatment of the subject,
while lºs Freshman, who has some notion of going in for honours
at College, and marrying the dean's daughter, afterwards, finds his
attention arrested by the Scholar’s Mate (140) in which MR. Cope

“MR. WELLs exhibits an excellent portrait of an Italian (147) who
MR. BABBAGE I am sure will be rejoiced to find, has forsaken his late
horrible occupation of organ grinding, in order to sit as a model in
London ateliers. The capillary crop which surrounds his head like a
huge sponge, is in itself an object of no common interest, and I for
one much prefer seeing his hair on the canvas, to hearing his airs in
the street.
“Before MR. WARD's picture (169) you will always find a great
crowd assembled, and no wonder. Who could pass that motley scene
with indifference. The eye is arrested by a blaze of colour. We are

Christendom. Royal favourites vie with each other in magnificence.
“Dives opum, dives pictai vestis et auri,”

who loves and paints the stormy main as he does? His Dutch Galliot

delight the heart of honest T.P., his venerable namesake. , .

study of that animal grazing by a hedgerow, which is also made out
with great care. A little girl is nutting in the middle] distance, while
the cow is “nuts' upon the herbage. But why did MR, WEBBE
bestow all that skill and trouble on this vaccine portrait? Few cows
ave been celebrated in English history. , We have heard of the cow
with the crumpled horn, that tossed the dog, that worried the cat, that
subject with such care on so small a scale as in MR. J., FAEP's, picture

with his family to the strains of a wandering minstrel who has just
stopped at their door. Some of the party appear to be playing at
draughts, and the bard himself looks as if he would not refuse a drain.
“Another picture of the same class, but differently, handled, is . The
Knight's Home (190) in which MR. BURGEss has painted us a jolly
mediaeval warrior clad in complete steel—not ‘revisiting the glimpses
of the moon,” but sitting down by his ample fireside to play with his
children. Öne of them a fine little fair haired fellow, who no doubt
will be glad enough to step into his father's shoes by-and-by, does not
appear to relish the joke of trying on his helmet.
“Before we leave the East Room, one word in praise of MR.GooDALL's
First Born (203) in praise not so much for his skilful touch and per-
fect drawing, of which we all have had evidence in fifty previous wºrks,
but because in painting this simple group he has not cared to load his
canvas with all the splendour, which an Eastern scene and accessories
might justify, but has only taken human nature for his model, remem-
bering that that great instinct which makes the wuole world kin from
the Grampian Hills to the Himalaya, is the same in cot and palace,

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“I AM sure that you and I, and every lover of good acting,
must rejoice that MR. Robson has recovered from his illness, and is
able once again to delight a British audience. In the present dearth
of talent (protect me from a challenge for using such a phrase !) MR.
Robson is an actor who can very ill be spared, and whose place it
would at present be impossible to fill. Faults he may have, doubtless
—who of us has not?—and to those who see him often his very
eccentricity may seem mannered, if not forced. But where are we to
look for an actor to replace him? and when we lose him, will not
hundreds of us much lament the gap * When I think of all the tears
and laughs that he has won from me, I can but own his power, and
accord my thanks and praise. Few men have held their audience so
much at their command, and have moved its smiles or sighs with such
a ready sway. His quick change of emotion, if not the work of genius
is that of perfect art; and if he skips at times too suddenly from silly
to sublime, it is because his better judgment has been blunted by
burlesque. They who have not seen him in such plays as Plot and
Passion, know but little of his skill in making much of a small part,
and but little of his power in the conception of a character, and adapt.
ing voice and person to the carrying it out. Waried as they are, the
parts that he appears in he stamps upon one's memory, so that one at
any time can bring them to one's mind; and when, some score years
hence, one lights on an old playbill with either Daddy Hardacre or The
Porter's Knot inscribed on it, one will at once recal the character he
played, and revive some of the pleasure which the seeing it produced.
“The other night I dropped into the cosy little Bandbox, which
people from the country may know better as the Strand. It was not
the “Great Sensation Burlesque’ which attracted me, for I saw that
long ago, and said my say about it; and have only now to add a sigh
of sorrow that Aladdin has not taken my advice, and given up devoting
her talents to burlesque. That she can turn her tongue and person
to a far better account than giving point to puns and dancing comic
jigs, her acting in Court Favour abundantly well proved; and as a lady-
like demeanour is at present (more's the pity!) none too common on
the stage, I regret to see it vulgarised by acting in burlesque. Appa-
rently the public are not of my opinion, seeing with what clamour they
welcome Miss Aladdin, and applaud her every joke; and it is difficult,
of course, in the face of such approval, to persuade a young performer
to avoid what calls it forth.
“The piece that tempted me to fling in my four shillings to the
treasury was paraded in the playbill as a ‘triumphantly successful new
and original comedy;" and excepting that I found it neither novelty
nor comedy, I have no reason to quarrel with the title thus put forth.
With a captivating candour, the comedy (so called) is christened The
Old Story, and with the exception of some few minor points, the story
is as old as it is owned to be. The piece abounds throughout in stale
and stagy situations, and has the flavour rather of a hash-up of old
farces, except one serious scene which is by no means badly played.
There is our old, old friend the footman, whose heart is with the lady's
maid, and hopes in a snug ‘public’; and our old, old friends the poet
and the half-pay Indian Captain, who both want a wife with money,
and are rival plagues in pestering the heroine of the piece. And there's
the old, old way of bringing on the dramatis personae: first, the two
servants conversing, then the lover just arrived, and then the old man
and his pet; and the old, old way of callers coming quite by chance
together, half-a-dozen at a time, and entering through the window, or
anyhow they choose, exactly, we all know, as they do in real life.
spite, however, of antiquity—perhaps, indeed, because of it, for some
people most enjoy the tales they’ve often heard before, for they know
so well what's coming, and like to look as though they didn't-The
Old Story has been running, now for half-a-hundred nights, which is
surely quite enough to make its author proud of it, and tempt him to
regard it as a model when he writes. Well, opinions of course differ;
and I have no right to assume that mine infallibly is right. But, to
my thinking, the character which MR. PARselle plays affords the only
chance of acting with anything like nature; and of this chance,
PARs ELLE, who never over-acts himself, takes care to make the most.
I never met the author, mind, and have no private pique against him;
nor, as I hear, this is his maiden effort at a comedy, would I use a
word so harsh as to discourage him from making a better-judged
attempt. But as the clapping of the gallery is not the soundest praise,

a word of friendly caution, which I trust will not offend him, may make
him ask himself the question, ‘What, really, is a comedy?' and what
careful thought and writing is, or ought to be, required of him who
hopes to write one worthy of the name.
“Yours, Mr. Punch, much more in sorrow than in anger,
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
“P.S.–How I envy you the memory of your seat at Covent Garden
when that pleasant little party, PATTI, first appeared there ! Actually,
such are the engagements of this active time of year, I have not yet
found a night to spend with her Sonnambula, and now I see it stated
that Monday was her last. Oh, MR. Gye, do please reconsider your
resolve, if only for the sake of your well-wisher, O. W. P.”
POLAND DRESSED TOO LOUD.
THE subjoined telegram, dated from Breslau, announces a little edict
of a great tyranny:—
“According to advices received from Warsaw, an ordinance has been published
there enumerating the articles of dress which the inhabitants are prohibited from
wearing, namely—square caps, Polish tunics, amaranth-coloured waistcoats and
neckties, coloured boots and shoes, and any dress of a showy colour or unusual cut.”
It must be rather difficult at Warsaw to dress in such a style as to
afford satisfaction to the Government. But the other day mourning
was forbidden, and now gay clothes are prohibited. We may imagine
amaranth-coloured waistcoats and neckties objectionable to the despotic
government of Poland, because amaranth is a flower, and perhaps, in
the language of flowers, means “Never say Die!” or something of
that sort, breathing a spirit of freedom and defiance. But the denun-
ciation of Polish tunics, square caps, and coloured, boots and shoes,
would be unintelligible if we did not know that the Russian authorities
are accustomed to flog ladies. Barbarians who can be guilty of such
a rocity as that, may easily be conceived dastardly enough to be capable
of trying to inflict an unmanly mortification on female vanity; a sen-
timent to which all manhood bows. Hence their interference with the
smart blue tunic, square vermilion cap, and red morocco boots to
match, familiar in the music-shop windows as the costume of the Polka
and Cracovienne. It may be, however, that as these are national
Polish dances, the Russian officials in charge of Warsaw are afraid of
them, and that the ordinance against coloured boots and shoes is
intended to prevent the ladies from making themselves too dangerous
in exciting revolutionary enthusiasm. - - - -
The conclusion of the decree above quoted, interdicting “any dress
of a showy colour or unusual cut,” has an obvious aim. It is evidently
levelled against Punch. The hero of the cudgel and the hump, glorious
in scarlet and, gold, is the universally received impersonation and
symbol of absolute liberty; and the dress of a showy colour in which
he rejoices, and of unusual cut, whereon he prides himself, is a horror
and an abomination to absolute despotism.
REWIWAL IN ART.
AMONG things not commonly known is the existence of the Painters’
Company; one, nevertheless, of the most ancient and dignified of the
civic guilds. The Painters' Company has, however, lately come out
into public notice, by establishing an exhibition of imitative and
decorative art, now on view in the Hall of the Company at Queen-
hithe. Dormant, in a state of suspended animation, for many a day,
the venerable Company of Painters appears now at length to have
awakened out of its sleep of ages. It has already begun to put forth
its energies, and there is no saying what it may not ultimately do. In
a notice of its present exhibition, a contemporary says:—
“Of the Painters' Company it may not be out of place to add that they are the
forerunners of the Royal Academy, and that in bygone times they rendered good
service to the cause of art. It is said that among the ancient prerogatives which in
right of their charter they still possess is the privilege of contemptuously smearing
over any pictorial work which may appear to them to be badly executed.”
What if the Painters’ Company should take it into their heads to
exercise the privilege with which they are thus invested?, Suppose
they were to delegate certain officers to make a tour of inspection
around all repositories of pictures, with a commission to deface all
those paintings which they considered to be badly executed. Various
picture-galleries, perhaps, would be considerably weeded, and the
censors would doubtless effect an extensive clearance, in the picture-
dealers’ shops, of counterfeits professed to be the originals of eminent
artists. What work they would make, or mar, among Parliamentary
frescoes!. It may be that a thorough purification of British Art is
destined to be effected, in the exertion of their daubing powers, by this
resuscitated brotherhood of the brush.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
At the late half-yearly meeting of the Crystal Palace Company, we
find the following observations reported to have been made § a gen-
tleman whom we may almost call a namesake, MR. Punches:-
-- Thº, were giving one hundred guineas to a male singer for singing a couple of
songs. BRAHAM never had anything like it... They also gave twenty-five guineas to
a lady singer. Now, with all respect for the musical art, he thought that one
hundred guineas for a bawler, and twenty-five for a squaller, was rather too much;
it was paying too much for their whistle.”
If a hundred guineas are too much for a bawler, and twenty-five
guineas are too much for a squaller, how much, by way of dividend for
instance, does our friend MR PUNCHER consider to be sufficient for a
grumbler MR. PUNCHER should not allow his name to run away
with him. We are afraid he §: he was punching the male and
the female artist to whom he alluded by calling the former a bawler and
the latter a squaller; whereas he merely punched his own head as it
were, demonstrating its density, and the length and obtuseness of his
ears. There is too much reason to doubt that he knew what a funny
thing he was saying when he termed singers bawlers and squallers,
speaking, as he declared, “with all respect for musical art.” If, as
MR, PUNCHER thinks, the Crystal Palace Concerts do not pay, the
performers are paid too much for the Company's purpose; but they
cannot be paid too much for their services except by being paid in
excess of what those services will repay. Surely MR. PuscăER him:
self will allow that the worth of anything is just as much as it will
bring; and, though with utter disrespect for the musical art, a gentle-
man with Bottom's ear for music may denominate eminent vocalists
bawlers and squallers, yet unless his arithmetical faculty, and indeed
the rest of his intellectual powers, are on a level with his musical
sense, he must see that if squalling and bawling fetch more money
than they cost, too much cannot be paid for even squalling and bawling.
The same observations apply to the value of those other performers
whom, MR. PUNCHER would perhaps describe as puffers and blowers,
tweedlers, tootlers, tinklers, twangers, bangers, sheepskin-thumpers,
and catgut-scrapers, meaning the band, and intending to intimate that
the sounds of musical instruments are, to his apprehension, merely
varieties of noise. If the expenses of the Crystal Palace Concerts
exceeded their returns, then, indeed, although consisting of the finest
music in the world, they would afford MR.PUNCHER some reason to
say that the Company were paying too much for their whistle.
MINISTERING TO ONE'S WANTS AND COMFORTS.
SIR. John PAKINGTON was kind enough to inform us, during one of
those interminable Paper-Duty discussions, that it was “the duty of a
Ministry not only to make a House, but to keep a House.” LADY
GREY MARE, in whose presence the above sentiment was being read
out, instantly exclaimed, “Yes, and so it is the duty of a husband—of
every husband, at least, who pretends to be the minister of his wife's
happiness; I say, not only is it the husband's duty always “to make a
house,’ but it is, also, his duty, as it should be his §. “to keep
it;" and by that, I mean, he should do everything in his power to make
it comfortable, and to º it thoroughly in repair; that is to say, in
the height of fashion, so that his wife may have nothing whatever to
complain of.” All the married Ladies present received this noble
exhortation on the duties of married life with a musical murmur of
applause, though, it was observed that LADY GREY MARE's husband,
who seemed to be an incomplete copy of manhood, instantly left the
room.
Probable Misunderstanding with France.
A DESPATCH from Athens, published in the Paris papers, states that,
at a recent, sitting of the Syrian conference, “SIR HENRY Bulweh
assumed a threatening attitude.”. This announcement is calculated to
impress the minds of our neighbours with an erroneous idea. Pre-
occupied with a belief in the propension of all Englishmen for the box,
they will naturally picture to themselves the threatening attitude
assumed by SIR HENRY, Bulweh in the Syrian Conference, as that of
“squaring round,” and will imagine that, throwing himself into a
posture of offence, he doubled his fists, and offered to punch the
Russian ambassador's head.
As Clear as Crystal.
We believe that the Crystal Palace was originally designed for “the
elevation of the masses.” This tight-rope dancing of M. BLONDIN is,
we suppose, only a carrying out of the original intention, for though
the Franco-American is seemingly the only person of the masses who
is “elevated,” yet we know as a positive fact that his performances are
so popular that they have invariably met with a general ascent /

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 17, Monday. LoRD NoFMANBY made some impertinent
insinuations to the effect that LORD CARLISLE was not consulted, as
to Irish affairs, by the Government at home..., LoRD GRANVILLE
administered the snub which now seems to be a daily necessity to Non-
MANBY. He would not enjoy his dinner unless he had previously made
a goose of himself in the Lords, and had been told that he had:
Having received this stimulus to his faculties, he * quite pleased
with himself. One of these days we shall have his Testimonial to
DR. GRANVILLE's Bitter Pills.
SIR GEORGE Lewis disgusted the Aristocracy and their imitators,
who crowd the Crystal Palace to see the French acrobat run the risk
of breaking his neck. The HoME SECRETARY announced that he had
warned the Directors against allowing BlonDIN to take his child upon
the rope. The fashionable world, having attended this BLONDIN-exhi-
bition in far larger numbers than could be mustered when any intel-
lectual or even refined amusement was offered, must feel this insult,
They want a stimulus to excite their natures, jaded with an incessant
round of common-place fooleries, and it is really hard of the Minister
to interfere between them and their diversions. SIR GEORGE may
have feared to be unpopular with his Qrder, so he has made some
amends by remitting a portion of the punishment to which a Swell was
§§ roperly, in the opinion of plebeians) consigned by MR, ARNOLD
or º: in a blackguardly manner at Cremorne. So let us hope
that the BLONDIN affair is condoned.
The Attorney-GENERAL thinks that the Lords have knocked out
every valuable feature from the º Bill, and he takes time to
consider whether it is worth while to ask the Government to accept
the mutilated measure. LoRD DERby, on the other hand, has taken
special pains to convince LQRD GRAN VILLE that none of the important
features of the Bill have been removed, except the provision for
appointing a Supreme Judge. -
Then we went at the Appropriation of Seats Bill. Government had
tossed up, or in some cognate way arrived at a determination as to
what they should propose, after the unceremonious smasher to
Chelsea-cum-Kensington. They gave in their adhesion to MR.
KNIGHTLEy's proposition to assign a third member to Middlesex.
MR. NewDEGATE signified that this was no better than the C.-cum-K.
plan, and that the educated classes would be equally swamped in the
proposed election. The House, by 236 to 186, endorsed this view, and
rejected the idea....Then Lord PALMERSTON proposed to give four
members to the West Riding, and this plan, after a good deal of
debate, was allowed to stand over, and in the meantime Birkenhead was
enfranchised, by 163 to 26.
An Irish squabble, finished the evening. Hi, Wiscount, stop!
Don't you be going off like that... We have a question to ask you. A
Select. Committee was appointed to inquire into the expediency of
extending the Cadastral Survey of England and Wales. Now, don’t
look Cadaverous-what’s Cadastral? There, we won't tease you on a
hot evening, but be prepared to answer the question next week.
Tuesday. NoRMANBy snubbed himself to-night; for, having given
notice of a foolish motion, he withdrew it for a more foolish reason, to
the relief and amusement of LoRD GRANville.
Good, and handsome QUEEN MARY THE SEcond caused a noble
Hospital to be provided for aged seamen. It is situated near the houses
where MEssRs. HART and QUARTERMAINE minister hospitality. It has
enormous property, and this, of course, is mismanaged. The DUKE of
SoMERSRT also says that whereas a pensioner in the Hôtel des Invalides
is kept for £31, in Greenwich he costs £59. Now, whether an English-
man can beat two Frenchmen, or not, he certainly cannot eat as much
as two Frenchmen. The whole system wants overhauling; but so
much opposition to the Government Reform Bill is menaced (vested
interests in jobbing being of course endangered somewhere) that the
measure, though, it went through Committee in the Lords to-night,
was withdrawn later in the week. Gould not a Committee be ap-
pointed, with instructions to eat whitebait at Greenwich twice a week
until the end of the season, and to chat with the old Salts for a quarter
of an hour before dinner? Much valuable information might thus be
obtained, and in the interests of the Service, ADMIRAL PUNCH offers
himself as Chairman. - -
The Harbours Bill—avery good Bill—was discussed in Committee in
the morning, and in the evening LoRD RoBERT MonTAGU was confusing
the Schleswig-Holstein question, when the House was counted out.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Wednesday. The House rejected º 79 to 38 a Bill of SIR CHARLES
BURRELL’s for prohibiting the employment of maid-servants to clean
the outside of windows. Now Mr. Punch, the friend of all mankind
and womankind, begs to say that there are two ways of looking at
such proposals, as these. It is perfectly true that there would be a
ludicrous anti-climax in an Act of Parliament which, after a long title,
should proceed to state that HER MAJEsty, with the advice of Her
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled,
Ordained and Enacted that MARY should not mount on the window-
sill. But it is equally true that MARY ought to be protected from
thoughtless, or shabby employers, who do not regard her danger, or
grudge a bob to a ; IR G. Lewis's allegation that there is
already law enough for the purpose, and his other allegation that there
are more dangerous trades than window-cleaning, are beside the mark.
The law is neglected, and the other trades are matters of choice with
the followers thereof. What is ...} wanted is, not a separate Act for
every case that demands magisterial interference, but a sensible, com-
prehensive Police Act, which shall enable the discreet and trustworthy
gentlemen absurdly galled Police Magistrates to deal with the hundred
cases constantly, arising in our high-pressure social system. , Let
Parliament imitate Paterfamilias, who does not go about his house
denouncing dusty looking-glasses, picking up litters, and turning the
cat off the clean counterpane, but who delegates to Materfamilias an
unqualified power over details, and sits nobly in his library, reading
Punch, reserving the thunders of his wrath and lightnings of his eye
for some unpardonably insolent menial or inconceivably dishonest
cabman.
Then came on the Great St. Stephen's Race, far and away the
most exciting event in the year's political sporting. Stakes, £250,000
a-year. Distance, from Little Mephibosheth Tabernacle to the Mitre
Tavern. Open to all horses, and asses not disqualified from running.
Before the Race the betting stood thus:–
3 to 1 against Compromise. 14 to 1 against Brother to Voltaire.
3 to 1 against Abolition. 15 to 1 against Drum-Ecclesiastic.
5 to 1 against No Surrender. 16 to 1 against Wet Quaker.
7 to 1 against Puseyite. 17 to 1 against Iconoclast.
8 to 1 against Anabaptist. 18 to 1 against The Scoffer.
9 to 1 against Indifferentism. 19 to 1 against Bigotry.
11 to 1 against Clap-Trap. 20 to 1 against St. Athanasius.
18 to 1 against Little Bethel. 100 to 1 against Any Settlement.
Stringent measures had been taken to ensure a good race, and when
the flag dropped they all got off well. TRELAwNY, on Abolition, led,
but closely attended by Estcourt on Compromise, and Disraeli on
No Surrender, not far off. . Bob CECIL made a spirt with Puseyite,
but a few strides took the wind out of that showy but unsound beast;
and HARVEY LEwis, who rode his maiden race on Clap-Trap, speedil
#. to pump out his horse. GeoRGE LEwis went ahead º
Indifferentism, but that horse has had his day, and this jock's unfor-
tunate practice of looking one way and riding another soon got him
into grief. BRIGHT showed Wet Quaker well #. and cannoning
against Bigotry, knocked that unlucky animalagainst the rails, WHITE-
sIDE loudly protesting. The rest of the horses were nowhere, and it
was soon clear that the race lay with Compromise, No Surrender, and
Abolition. A brilliant struggle, ensued, and the speed and bottom of
the horses did honour to the system of British training; but the pace
was too fierce to last, and Compromise was seen dropping astern;
Then, amid terrific shouts, the two favourites did all they knew, and
it was a neck-and-neck race to the post, and for some minutes no one
could say which way the eyent had gone. At length, after a pause of
intense, excitement, the Judge, MR. DENISON, announced that. No
Surrender was the victor. The scene that ensued defies description;
the : of the winner's friends rose again and again, and the bells
of several churches were set ringing. -
Mr. Punch begs to apologise for the flavour of turf in the above
paragraph, but it is the racing season, and we should all suit ourselves
to the tone of the day. But if anybody wants the story told in a calmer
fashion, let him be informed that to-day SIR. JoHN TRELAwny's Bill
for the Abolition of Church Rates came on for Third Reading; that
after a debate the division was taken; that there were 274 on each
side; and that the SPEAKER gave his º: against the Bill,
which is thereforeiost." Mr. Panch believes that the division by no
means promises a long life to an unpopular rate, but means that the
House desires to do nothing harshly or unjustly, and intends to carry
out a fair compromise of a vexed question.
Thursday. India. The Commons walk out of the House, and leave
the affairs of millions to be settled by a handful of Members, and Mr.
Punch is not inclined to be more patriotic. Wood—aw—where's
India?
Friday. LoRD DERBy expressed his hope that the vote of Wednes-
day would lead to the satisfactory compromise so much to be desired.
%; does he not himself draw a Hiſ: He was once pretty ready to
deaſ with Church matters. . Does he recollect how many Irish bishops
he once bowled over, laughing at the frantic noise of that most objec-
tionable being, a clamorous Irish parson? - -
The Commons did Harbour business in the morning, and at night
amused themselves by deriding BAILLIE CochRANE, who is so horribly
awestruck at the examination-papers for Candidates for the Civil
Service. CochRANE should get away for a little from among old
fogies who never knew much, and have forgotten most of what they
did know, and should spend a little time smart young fellows of
about 20, educated up to the mark of the day. He may come and
smoke half a pipe with Mr. Punch's lads, if he likes (only, Cocky must
promise not to read them any of his poetry), and then he will learn
that however a few harmless exercises may frighten him, the lads of
the day are not utterly prostrated at º asked to say where China
is, to explain the Second Aorist, to scan a line of Juvenal, or even to
multiply 36, by 72. STANLEY and GLADstone laughed at him, of
course, but he is ludicrously unconvinced that horrible tyranny is not
practised on the rising generation.
THE PORTER’s KNOT COIFFURE.
HERE is no task that the
male mind is more inclined
to shrink from than that of
ointing out a folly or a
ault in Lovely Woman.
But at whatever risk of
losing his character for gal-
lantry, Mr. Punch at times
is forced to do himself a vio-
lence by hinting that his
darlings are making them-
selves ludicrous by the follies
which Le Follet persuades
them to adopt. ith Cri-
noline he felt it was his
duty to contend, as it proved
a public nuisance and en-
croached on public tho-
roughfares, besides en-
croaching also ". many a
private purse. d against
the growing taste for finery
and flummery Mr. Punch
has often had the courage
to inveigh, because beauty
- - in plain clothes is more
pleasing to his eye than beauty decked by vanity and adorned with
doubtful taste.
.The question how far Lovely Woman is É. with the right to
disfigure and deform herself, is one which a debating Club may argue
as they please, but on which all minds of sense will certainly agree,
From the times of ancient Britonesses who dyed their hair sky blue,
the ladies have been ever grave offenders in this way, and their coiffure
has been commonly the head and front of their offending. Never say
dye (at any rate with blue) may tº: be an accepted
maxim; but .# less ridiculous than this old English fashion is
the modern mode of gathering the hair into a hump, and wearing it
à la porter's knot upon the neck. Sometimes this absurd protuberance
is of most monstrous size, being swelled out with the hair from other
heads and tails, if it be true that use is made of equine caudal cuttings.
This not merely hides the beauty of the back part of the neck (and of
all the charms of woman there are few which equal that), but it gives
the head a most unnatural appearance, and makes it look considerably
too big for the body. Ladies with short necks are º disfigured
by the porter's knot coiffure, for the hair hump makes it difficult to
see at a back view that they have any neck at all; and one imagines
them descended from the race that ShakspeaRE speaks of, the men
whose heads are said to grow beneath their shoulders.
Another disadvantage in the porter's knot coiffure is the fact that it
is calculated to collect the dust; and a net is sometimes worn which
increases this collection, although it is believed to be a guard against
it. Whether ladies wear these nets in the hope of catching husbands
with them, Mr. Punch has neither means nor wish to ascertain; nor
whether. men in general approve of all, the beads and bangles and
makebelieve half-sovereigns with which these nets are often woven and
weighed down. Ladies are in general a race moutonnière, and when
once, a step is taken in the matter of the fashions, the whole flock
blindly follow without thinking if it suits them. Making a hair poultice
at the back part of the neck is not to Mr. Punch a capillary attraction;
and although some eyes may view it as “a trifle light as hair,” he thinks
it gives the head a very heavy look.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SHORT CUT FOR A CLAY.
R. Cassius M. CLAY, the
new Minister at St. Peters:
burg of the Northern Untied
States, has been delivering
in Paris, to a meeting of
Americans, a wonderfully
sensible and delicate oration,
in the course of which he
ventured to congratulate the
French on the extraordinary
“liberties” which they are
now enjoying, and which are
so well “recognised by the
§ chief of their choice.”
With this sprinkle of soft
sawder for our friends across
the Channel, MR. CLAy then
mixed a spice of peppery
temper against England, ac-
cusing her of taking up the
cause of Southern “rebels,”
and predicting her arrival
at univairsal smash:-
“If England, after all she has
said against slavery, shall draw
her sword in its defence, then I
say, great as she is, she “shall
perish by the sword.” For then
not only France, but all the world shall cry out, “Perſide Albion tº When she mingles
the red crosses of the Union Jack with the piratical black flag of the “Confederate
States of America'—will not just as certainly the Tricolor and the Stars and Stripes
float once more in fraternal folds? (Hear, hear.) Can France forget who has dog-
º hedged in all the fields of her glory? Can Napoleon forget St. Helena? Will
e at her bidding turn his back upon the East? Shall Partant pour la Syrie be
heard no more in France?”
After this outbursting of vinous declamation, the honourable orator
proceeded to remark:—
“I have spoken to England, not as an enemy, but a friend. For her own sake, I
wºuld have her be true to herself. If England would preserve cotton for her
milliºns of operatives, let her join in putting down the rebellion. Her interference
in defence ºf the rebels of the South will force us to that which would be a calamity
to us as well as to them—at a blow to destroy slavery for ever.”
It is obviºus that Cassius had been moistening his CLAY, or he
surely wºuld not so have mistated real facts as to allege that neutral
England has “interfered” to help the South. He, however, gives her
reasonable ground for her so doing, in stating that she thereby would
“at a blow destroy all slavery for ever;” which, for all their pious
outcry, the Northerners it seems would consider a “calamity.” “What-
ever M.R.CLAY may think when in his sober senses, it is clear that
when excited he gives vent to queer opinions; such as ought to tempt
his Government to take a leaf out of Othello, and exclaim-
“I love thee, Cassius,
But never more be Minister of mine."
THE CLERICAL COLLECTIVE WISDOM,
Convocation has at last done one sensible thing. It has abolished
the 29th canon. The old canon had got quite rusty, and was entirely
unserviceable, combining absolute inutility with an enormous bore.
Henceforward a father will be enabled to be a sponsor to his own
child, and exempt from the necessity of soliciting some other man to
stand godfather, that is, to stand silver cups and spoons. Gentlemen
of Paterfamilias's acquaintance will also be relieved of the necessity of
sacrificing a sum of money in superfluous plate to the ecclesiastical
obligations of Paterfamilias, and also delivered from what some of
them will perhaps regard as a greater nuisance, that of having either
to disoblige and vex poor Paterfamilias, or to promise and vow certain
things which it is utterly impossible for them to perform,
“Gaudeamus igitur, Hungari dum sumus.”
M. Kossuth is very well, “up” in SHAKseraRE, and therefore
Mr. Punch is not surprised at the extreme felicity of the quotation
made by the illustrious Hungarian, when the Appeal Judges confirmed
SIR. John STUART's judgment in the case of the notes manufactured
by MEssRs. DAY. Exclaimed he,
“o Day, and Knight, but this is wondrous strange!"
The Nuisances R.E.Moval Act.–If this Act were only properly
enforged, how many of the Statues in the Metropolis, might we ask,
would be able to hold their ground?
FRENCH SENTIMENT AND SUICIDE.
AccompING to MARSHAL MAGNAN, suicides in the army of Paris
have lately become “too numerous.” . A little of this sort of thing is
all...very, well, but it shouldn't go beyond a certain point. So the
gallant Marshal has issued an order of the day, in which he thus
addresses his brave fellows who are rather too prome to felo-de-se:—
“Wheneveryou find your minds agitated by fatal ideas, whenever you feel your-
selves unequal to the trials you have to meet, come and see me; you know that I
am always accessible; come and tell me all your troubles, my soldier's heart will
understand yours, will recall you to a sentiment of duty, º preserve your lives
for your family, for France, and for the EMPERon, who loves and trusts you.”
It is all nonsense to talk of the wittiness and levity of the French.
How intense must be the seriousness of MARshAL MAGNAN for him to
have been capable of having, as above, invited any soldier who had an
idea of committing suicide tº come to him and talk the matter over.
Such gravity is unknown in England; nobody has ever seen anything
like it who is not old enough to have seen Liston. -
Fancy abritish full private appearing before his commanding officer,
and, after performance of the regulation salute, saying, "If youplease,
Sir, I’m sorry to say I’ve thoughts of shooting myself.” The officer,
if he did not place him under arrest for impertinence, would doubtless
call him a blanked fool, and tell him to go to Hades. Whereupon the
. would repeat his salute and retire—not, however, to obey the
order.
Very different would be the scene which we may imagine to take
place between MARSHAL MAgNAN and any one of his braves who shall
come and inform him that he intends to burn his brains because he
owes a tavern-bill, or has quarrelled with a comrade at dominoes, or
has been deserted by a little mantua-maker, or laughed at by some;
body, or is dissatisfied with his rations. Perhaps the Marshal would
remonstrate and expostulate with him, as a kind papa would with an
imprudent boy. The interview might begin and end with a salute,
which, however, would not resemble the British private's; for of
course the French soldier would embrace the Marshal, and the Marshal
would very likely kiss the soldier. Then, they would both weep, and
the simpleton whose mind had been agitated by a fatalidea, recalled by
a soldier's heart to a sentiment of duty, and having had his life pre-
served for his family, for France, and for the EMPEROR who loves and
trusts him, would rush out of his General's presence, crying with joy.
And where is the Frenchman who, beholding the scene above supposed,
would imagine that it would excite roars of laughter if represented in
a farce on the British stage P No.; the French are the most serious
eople in the world: our own folks who frequent Exeter Hall are
uffoons to our “vivacious neighbours.”
NICE NAMES.
At a late sitting of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was
commenced an appeal from Bengal, described as “Moonshee BUZL UL
RuHEEN v. LUTEEFutoNissa.”. There is a certain poem, of an educa:
tional character, adapted to the tender capacity, which speaks of
*Thomas and Wºw and such pretty names.” Is there an essen-
tial prettiness in names, or is the quality of names, pleasing or the
reverse, a mere matter of personal or national taste? In the poem
alluded to, if we recollect aright, Thomas and WILLIAM are exhorted
not to quarrel, because their names are so pretty. An Indian poetess,
likewise, might recommend the plaintiffs in the case above mentioned
to compose their difference, and desist from litigation on the ground
of rejoicing in such pretty names as Moonshee Buz, UL RUHEEN and
LUTEEFutoNISSA,
A Sound Objection.
In the review of the Iron Market, we read that “Scotch pig, is
quiet.” This must be comforting news for those who live in the
neighbourhood of the market, for we can easily imagine that if the
“Scotch pig" was not quiet, that he would probably make a noise
compared to which the bagpipes would be considered as tuneful wind-
bags filled, direct from Heaven, with the Music of the Spheres.
DIVIDE! DIVIDE!
WE hear that CAPTAIN Fowke and MR. SIDNEY SMIRKE both claim
credit for the pretty Arcades in the new Gardens at South Kensington;
We would suggest that they should share the credit, as “Arcades Ambo.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 29, 1861.
A WONDERFUL MAN.
ATURIN letter, describing the new Italian Minister, declares inter
alia–
“M. Ricasoll never feels fatigue. Four hours' sleep, a piece of bread and butter,
and a glass of water, are sufficient to supply his daily wants. He has no court, but
he displays a greater haughtiness than Louis THE FourTEENTh. Rarely is he seen
to laugh. He is generous, but is feared. . HisN. tremble at his approach, yet
he * them rich and comfortable. Never was a character more strongly
marked."
This is quite exact as far as it goes, but it is incomplete. We are
glad to be able to finish the description from an equally accurate
Source :-
“For his appearance—M. Ricasoli is seven feet high, but has the
delicate feet and hands of a child of four years old. His hair is snow;
*::: his eyebrows, whiskers, moustache and beard of the jettiest
ack.
... For his temperament—it is ..º.º. He
will weep over the pages of MANzoNI, but did not shed a tear when
his Mother died.
“For his habits—he hates pomp and form, but never goes out without
four running footmen, and insists upon being served upon the knee.
“With an annual income. equivalent to £10,000 19s. 4d. in English
money, his personal expenditure amounts to 14 pauls (8%d. English)
daily. He is at once silent and loquacious, amiable and sulky, impetuous
and cold-blooded, tall and short, young and old,—in one word, he is
exactly the man whom clever Correspondents delight to paint, but
whom nobody ever met with.”
A Drawn Game.
..The result of the late division on Church-rates, equality of votes on
either side, cannot but be said to constitute, between Churchmen and
#: a connection which may be considered as forming a most
lmulmate t16.

THEY DON'T DO IT TWICE.
THE Bristol Mirror gives an interesting account of a Sheep-Shearing
Match at Blackwall, where great feats in the way of rapidly denudin
the fleecy flocks were performed. . Afterwards there was a dinner, an
yet, notwithstanding that fact, and the nature of the exhibition, none of
the Somersetshire parsons came. The Chairman proposed the health of
the Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese, and was “excessively sorry that
no Member of the Clergy was present to represent that important body.
Had any clergyman attended, he would have heard nothing to disgrace
him: he could positively say that not a single oath had been uttered in
the . tent during the whole day.” The most courteous solution
of the problem why no Clergy were there may be the supposition that
the Somersetshire ecclesiastics thought (as the event proved) that
they had taught their disciples so well that no clerical superintendence
was wanted. Qr is it that the Shepherds perform their shearing duties
vicariously, and get through their work at Easter P
