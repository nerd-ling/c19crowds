HOW A STRANGE INDIAN WOULD RUN BEFORE PUNCHAGRUEL, AND WHAT CHANCED,
AND THE VAST REWARD WHICH THE INDIAN WON THEREBY.
Now the good PUNCHAGRUEL keeping his Christmas with joy and delight, as ever was his fashion, and
casting forth to those about him, yea, and to all the world, myriads of diamonds, pearls, emeralds,
amethysts, rubies, topazes, garnets, opals, chrysolites, brilliants, carbuncles, sardonyxes, jacinths, and other
glorious and glittering things, which the Greeks did call epigrams, from the verb which signifieth to inscribe
(as Cox of Finsbury, Member of Parliament, well knoweth), there came to him a message that a strange
Indian, called DEERFoot, coveted speech with him. “Bid him not covet,” said the virtuous PUNCHAGRUEL,
“ and bid him enter.” Whereupon there leaped forward a wondrously bedizemed Indian, bounding in such sort
that his last step carried him four hundred and eleven thousand yards, or that I may not lie unto you, three
inches and a quarter less, and he had to walk back again for seventeen hours or more, until he regained the
place where stood the noble PunchAgruel. Then, kneeling on his brown knees, the Indian set forth,
humbly but succinctly—first, that he was a Seneca Indian; secondly, that he was a great runner; thirdly, that
he had beaten all runners beside; fourthly, that though loaded with prizes, he desired but one, namely, the
praise of the mighty PUNch AGRUEl; and fifthly, that he would be made happy for life if he might run before
that potentate. The mild PUNCHAGRUEL smiled affably, and said unto his friends, “SENECA is not too heavy
nor PLAutus too light for me.” Then, improving the occasion by speaking of that which was by no means in
question or to the purpose, as his manner is, he discoursed to them the history of SENECA, reciting many
thousand lines from his tragedies and comedies, and reducing his imputed wealth, namely, three hundred
thousand sestertia, into pounds, shillings, pence and farthings, and then into napoleons, francs and centipedes,

and again into the coinage of all the nations in the world. At length the Indian, being somewhat tired with
standing during so many hours of discourse, prayed that he might have an answer. “Thou would'st run before
‘me,” said the noble PUNCHAGRUEL. “Nay, that were impossible; but thou may’st run after me, anthou wilt.
Go it, thou cripple !” Then flew off the Indian like an arrow from the bow of Ulysses, or a Yankee of the North
when he hears that a Government post is to be given away. He ran with all his heart, yet the calm Punch-
Agnuel stirred not, but stood narrating to his followers the most recondite anecdotes of all the great runners of
the world, and their history, and discoursing so sweetly of ATALANTA, CAMILLA, and I know not what others, that
the hearers fell asleep with ecstacies of admiration and delight. All this while the Indian kept running like
unto that hour on the dial which is signified by a unit, or as if he had received a pedal impulse remitting him
into the centre of the proximate hebdomadal period. “Hal” said the wise PUNCHAGRUEL, “it is said that he
who runs can read. Let us show this benighted Indian that he who reads can run.” And darting forth with
one measureless and inconceivable rush, that clove the air like the wind of an Armstrong shell, and caused
innumerable birds to fall down from the sky, or celestial azure, the swift PunchAgBUEL flew along like the
whirling chariot of Phoebus, when that god has lost time in flirting on his road, and putteth on the steam lest he
keep the dinner-table of Olympus waiting. He speedily caught and passed the straining and despairing Indian
(who nevertheless ran valiantly), and smiling affably upon him, did keep ahead of him until DEERFoot, throwing
up his arms, exclaimed with a loud voice, “Rabbyshackle par dendron slapamikos boo dingy 2” which signifieth
in the Seneca tongue, “Who can contend with the Wonder of the World?” and he fell flat upon the earth.
Then the kind PUNCHAGRUEL caused them to raise him, and administer consolation and brandy; and when he
was recovered, gave him so many jewels, medals, banknotes, and other rewards, that the Indian staggered under
the weight thereof. Then the gentle PUNCHAGRUEL said, “Would'st run against me, brown-face Dost Not
KNow that it is my destiny to Run For ever ?” And beside the presents, and as a more precious donation
than all, he gave him, in memory of the day, and for his glorification and joy, his
forty-first ºnlimt.

POLITICAL
Th; condition of the United States necessarily commanded
the attention of Parliament, and the conditions of the
blockade, and the bearings of international law, were subjects
of anxious inquiry, although the House throughout the session
abstained from any discussion which involved an expression
of opinion on the merits of the American contest; and when
MR. GREGORY, the member for Galway, gave notice of a motion
for the 7th of June, on the subject of recognising the Southern
Confederacy, CoLoREL WILson PATTEN made an earnest
appeal to the honourable member to abstain from raising a
discussion, adding that he was sure he represented the wishes
of a great majority of the House, in asking that a subject so
pregnant with risk and inconvenience should be avoided. MR.
GREGoRY very properly consented to postpone his motion, and
fortunately the session terminated without any debate on
this delicate and complicated question being suffered to take
place, although SIR JAMEs FERGUson made a foolish allusion
to the despatch of three thousand men to Canada, and which
LoRD PALMERSTON explained to be only an ordinary matter of
precaution for the maintenance of peace.
The causes which occasioned the Civil War are now matters
of history, and it will be necessary only to refer to the con-
duct of our own Government, and to such incidents of the
War as attracted the notice of Mr. Punch.
On the 13th of May a Royal Proclamation was issued by
the Queen of the United Kingdom, which, after reciting the
existence of hostilities in America, went on to say:-
“And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our loving subjects
to observe a strict neutrality in and during the aforesaid hostilities, and to
abstain from violating or contravening either the laws and statutes of the
SUMMARY.
realm in this behalf, or the law of nations in relation thereto, as they will
answer to the contrary at their peril. . . . . .
“And we do hereby further warn all our loving subjects, and all persons
whatsoever entitled to our protection, that if any of then shall presume, in
contempt of this our Royal Proclamation, and of our high displeasure, to do
any acts in derogation of their duty, as subjects of a neutral sovereign, in
the said contest, or in violation or contravention of the law of nations in
that behalf . . . . they will in no wise obtain any protection from us
against any liabilities or legal consequences; but will, on the contrary, incur
our high displeasure by such misconduct.”
The EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH also declared, by a procla-
mation or notice in the Moniteur, his resolution “to maintain
a strict neutrality in the struggle between the Government of
the Union and the States which propose to form a separate
Confederation.” And these proclamations were accompanied by
other declarations affecting vessels of war and privateers belong-
ing to either of the belligerent parties. An incident occurred,
which nearly involved Great Britain in a war with America,
and as it was undoubtedly as clear a case of the violation of
national rights and international law as ever occurred, we
give the narrative in full as it appears in the Annual Register
for 1861 –
“The Trent, a packet-ship belonging to the British Mail
Steamship Company, which runs from Vera Cruz to Havannah,
and thence to St. Thomas (where her passengers and mails are
transferred to another steamer to be conveyed to Southamp-
ton), had touched in the beginning of November, in the usual
course of her voyage, at Havannah, to take in passengers and
letters. Four gentlemen, Messrs. SLIDELL, MASON, EUSTIs,
and M*FARLAND, who had paid their passage-money for the
whole route from Havannah to Southampton, embarked on
board. M.R. SLIDELL was accompanied by his wife and two

daughters. He and MR. MASON had been sent as envoys from
the Confederate States to Europe, MR. SLIDELL being bound
for France, and MR. MAson for England. They came, how-
ever, on board as ordinary passengers at a neutral port, in a
neutral ship.
“On the 7th of November the Trent sailed for St. Thomas,
and when she reached the Old Bahama Channel she observed
a ship lying stationary. The Trent hoisted her flag, but no
flag was shown by the stranger. As she approached, a shotted
gun was fired by the other vessel across her course, and the
United States flag was displayed at the same moment at her
peak. It turned out to be the United States war-steamer San
Jacinto, commanded by CAPTAIN WILKEs. The British flag
was again hoisted by the Trent, and so remained. She con-
tinued her course, and a shell was fired, which burst across
her bows. A boat put off from the San Jacinto, followed by
two other boats full of armed men; and a lieutenant, in the
uniform of the United States, boarded the Trent, and de-
manded from CAPTAIN Morr, the commander, his list of pas-
sengers. This was refused, and CAPTAIN Mora formally
protested against any right to visit his ship for such a pur-
pose. The lieutenant of the San Jacinto, announcing his com-
mission, said that two gentlemen, named SLIDELL and MAsox,
were known to be on board, as well as two other gentlemen,
named EUsTIs and M*FARLAND, and that his orders were to
take and carry them on board the San Jacinto. CoMMANDER
WILLIAMs, R.N., the British Admiralty agent, who was in
charge of the mails of the Trent, protested vehemently against
the act, and denounced it as piratical. We will quote what
follows from the statement drawn up by the four Southern
gentlemen, and delivered by them to CAPTAIN WILKEs, to be
transmitted by him to the Government of the United States:–
“‘The lieutenant addressed MR. SLIDELL, and afterwards
MR. MAsoN, repeating that his orders were to take them,
together with EUSTIs and M*FARLAND, and carry them on
board his ship. MEssRs. SLIDELL and MAson, in reply, pro-
tested, in the presence of the Captain of the Trent, his officers,
and passengers, against such threatened violation of their
persons and their rights, and informed the lieutenant that
they would not leave the ship they were in unless compelled
by the employment of actual force greater than they could
resist, and MEssRs. EUSTIs and M*FARLAND united with them
in expressing a like purpose. That officer stated, that he hoped
he would not be compelled to resort to the use of force, but, if
it would become necessary to employ it, in order to execute
his orders, he was prepared to do so. He was answered by
the undersigned that they would submit to such a force alone.
The lieutenant then went to the gangway, where his boats
were, the undersigned going at the same time to their state
rooms on the deck next below, followed by CAPTAIN Morb and
by the other passengers. The lieutenant returned with a party
of his men, a portion of whom were armed with side-arms, and
others (appearing to be a squad of marines) having muskets
and bayonets. MR. SLIDELL was in his state-room, imme-
diately by and in full view. The lieutenant then said to
MR. MASON, that, having his force now present, he hoped to
be relieved from the necessity of calling it into actual use.
That gentleman again answered, that he would only submit to
actual force greater than he could overcome, when the lieute-
nant, and several of his men by his order, took hold of him,
and in a glanner and in numbers sufficient to make resistance
fruitless; and, MR. SLIDELL joining the group at the same
time, one or more of the armed party took like hold of him,
and those gentlemen at once went into the boat.’”
The captured passengers were, however, surrendered on the
peremptory demand of Great Britain, although some delay
occurred, and for some weeks the tone of the American press
was so hostile that the most energetic preparations were made
by the English Government. Troops were dispatched to
Canada with all possible expedition, and that brave and loyal
Colony called out its militia and volunteers to be ready for any
adverse contingency. War was averted happily, as the
LINcolN Cabinet admitted the claims of England to redress,
and the four Confederate envoys who had been closely im-
prisoned, were placed on board a British man-of-war and
afterwards conveyed to England. The French Government
did good service in the cause of peace by urging the LINcoLN
Cabinet to yield to the justness of our demands.
Parliament was prorogued by Commission on the 6th of
August, and the Royal Speech made graceful allusion to the
devoted patriotism of Her Majesty's Volunteers, and the
admiration with which she had observed their rapid progress
in discipline and military proficiency,

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAY June 24. The appearance of a new Lord Chancellor is an
event almost worthy to inaugurate the appearance of the First
Number of a new Volume of Punch, and the more so that at length the
Great Seal has been caught by a sportsman of first-rate abilities. . Sir
RICHARD BETHELL, the son of a physician, and, the descendant of the
old Welsh family of AP-ITHELL, now sits upon the Woolsack (when he
has not a more comfortable seat this hot weather) as BARON WEST-
BURY, and Westbury is a place in Wiltshire. Mr. Punch has just done
himself the |. of smiling at and bowing to the new Chancellor,
and of remarking that . he may be called FELIX, neither in look
nor attitude does his Lordship resemble the Felia over his head mor, to
speak the truth, did Mr. Punch detect any very strong likeness between
the pictured orator who is addressing the uncomfortable pro-consul and
any of the mumbling gentlemen who were taking this early %.
of obtruding their views of equity upon LORD WESTBURY., Mr. Pune
begs heartily to congratulate his nºble, and learned friend, B.C., and,
by º, of a delicate allusion to his Cambrian ancestry, signifies Mr. P.'s
hope that during the intervals when his Lordship ceases to be bored b
Chancery babble, he will make any swaggering ancient (or modern
Pistol in the House of Lords or “elsewhere,” eat the leek which he
will be a bold man to mock.
The Parliamentary chronicle of the week, however, commences with the
tribute paid by the Upper House to the memory of LORD CAMPBELL,
whose sudden demise took place in the morning of the previous Sunday.
His Lºrdship had on the Saturday presided in the Court of º
where he h reserved a judgment” never, to be delivered by himse f
had attended a Cabinet Council, and had in the evening received friends,
‘Fortune for him had thrown the Treble. Six,” but he had laboured
long and well to deserve his gains. The House adjourned, after
addresses from LORDs GRAN VILLE, BROUGHAM, and St. LEONARDs.
In the Commons, on Monday, it was elicited that the French
Government, are considering whether they shall let British salt into
France. If they would freely admit Attic Salt, at six sous per measure,
direct from 85, Fleet Street, it would be a tenfold greater boon to the
Parisians, who must be bored to death with the niaiseries and naughti-
nesses of their own fettered satirists. SIR. G. LEwis made another
attempt to justify himself in the matter of the Swell who behaved like a
blackguard at Cremorne, and whose punishment was so indulgently re-
mitted, but SIR GEORGE succeeded only in making MR. ARNOLD's con-
duct appear still more praiseworthy than before. The Home Secretary
actually laid stress upon the fact that the police did not press the case.
The ji. press the case against a Swell with discreet friends ! “Why,
there be exclamations of laughing, as, ha! haſ ho! ho!” not to add
“hee! hee!” Then came another debate upon the ejections in Donegal
by MR, ADAIR. Divers Irish Members abused him for them, and other
Irish Members defended him for them. MR. ADAIR, believed that in
making a wholesale clearance of tenantry he was ºf out a piece
of the jº. conspiracy, and his assailants deny that he had sufficient
grounds for such ". , and say that he qught not to have inflictºd
suffering without more proof. But half the business of the scoundrelly
Ribbon conspirators is to take care that there shall be no proof of their
crimes. The Government did not approve of MR, ADAIR's operations
but refused to remove from the commission, as demanded, a landlor
who had in no way violated the law, about obedience to which, by land.
lords, the Irish are so uncommonly particular. -
We send 3000 soldiers to Canada by the Great Eastern, a prudential
measure which of course afforded material for some pleasing carping,
not much to the discomfiture of the Wiscount PALMERSTON, LORD
John Russell, intends to prevent, if possible, any new war between
Spain and Morocco, and rejoices in the increasing, prosperity of the
former. In spite of MR. BucKLE, Spain intends, she says, to resume
her old position as a leading power. Bon—we trust to have an
ELIZABETH ready.
Tuesday. The Lords, said that it was a hot evening, and went away.
The Commons had a little battle in the morning ºver the Bill for
making London pay, out of her coals and wine, for the Embankment, but
a majority of 160 to 5 showed that the House thought that any sort.of
settlement of the question was better than none at all. At night, MR.
T. G. BARING defended the cruelty of making soldiers march over-
dressed and overloaded under a broiling sun, and the defence was
charmingly official: “Another detachment had made the same march,
and no harm was done.” Who was it, Wiscount, who said something
about the small wisdom with which the world was governed? Take it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
in the Mosque of Achmet, Constantinople, this
successor, ABDUL Aziz, immediately published
'i, His brother and
- - a Hat, declaring that he
means to adhere to the policy of his predecessor, but to avoid his
extravagance. This is a very good Hat, and we hope it will keep its
shape, and especially will not require improving by a French NAP. It
is said, however, that the new Shadow of Providence is a believer in
the Koran, and means to go in for bigotry, in which case the Bosporus,
pro quo male scribitur Bosphorus, may one of these early days have to
carry him and his amiable and accomplished wives over the way, and
the Seraglio may be to let., LORD STRATFoRD DE THERAP1A, who
knows everything about the East, has heard that the new Sultan, is a
man of “an arbitrary temperament and decided turn of mind,” and |
his Lordship recommended that good advice should be bestowed upon
him. Mr. Punch may probably go round for the purpose, when Parlia-
ment rises. ---
Then came a Military Debate; that is to say, the comparative claims
of the Enfield and Whitworth Rifles were debated, and }. PALMER-
STON said, truly, that such a matter must be left to the Executive, and
was not for, Parliament. To be sure, if Members like to remain in
Town after the Prorogation, they may be º with guns, and may
practise along the interminable passages of the Houses, and so be
ready to report in February. Gentlemen, come, this would be
nobler than slaying grouse on the heather, Twilo puts down his name
first? Palace Yard will be a pleasant promenade in the close September
evenings, and very good whelks may be bought in the corner by the
new Bridge. - -
Aldershott came in for awful denunciations, as a useless place, and
an unhealthy place, and a haunt of vice, and all sorts of bad things;
and MR. BERNAL Osbor Nº lost his temper at being chaffed by Lond
PALMERSTON, and accused the latter of repeating a joke which he made
six years . Good gracious, BERNAL, who but Mr. Punch can escape
that sort of repetition ?
Wednesday. A new writ was moved for Wolverhampton, vacated b
the elevation of the ATToRNEY-GENERAL, to the Woolsack. ...Here it
may be convenient to record that the Solicitor-General, SIR WILLIAM
ATHERTON, is not thought strong enough for the place of Attorney, so
he is to be sent up to the Bench, and SIR Roux DELL PALMER (Punch
knights him offhand, to save bother) is to be the successor of SIR
RICHARD. SIR. RoundELL was a Peelite, is an able speaker, scholar,
gentleman, and so on; and if he will divest himself of a certain prig.
gishness, (O! Mr. Punch fears neither Attorney-Generals nor any
created beings) he will do very well. MR. Collier will make him an
excellent coadjutor; and as the first is for Church-ltates and against
Ballot, and the other is for Ballot, and against Church-Rates, the una-
nimity of the Ministry will not be disturbed, as the two lawyers can
pair off together, and go and smoke comfortably when either question
COines Oll.
A Bill for enabling Masters and Operatives to settle disputes by
arbitration was lost; but this object is a good one, and ought to be
followed up. The difficult is that the parties cannot be compelled to
submit to the decision of any such tribunal, whereas the French
Prudhommes have authority. . For some reason, the Government are
afraid to interfere with the ridiculous and iniquitous Court of Jersey,

Thursday. Introduced by Lords BROUGHAM and CRAN worth, LoRD
WESTBURY took his seat. The only proceeding of interest was a dis-
cussion about the TURNER pictures, which are not being treated in
accordance with the will of the painter-testator. Lord GRAN VILLE
thought that their being exhibited at Kensington was the best interim
measure that could be adopted, and PROFEssoR FARADAY says that the
gas does them no harm. . The only danger is that from conflagration,
about which [. perhaps, the nervousness of noble Lords was
justifiably awakened by the tremendous fire which broke out near
ondon Bridge on the previous Saturday, and which was still burning
while they talked.
In the Commons—India.
Friday. There is a Dublin dispute—there, dearest readers, don't throw
down the paper, consider that it is Punch who speaks, and you º to
listen, whether you like it,or not—“Apollo's oracle never speaks in
vain”—there is a Dublin, dispute about the opening some gardens to
the public on Sunday afternoon. Into the merits of that particular
Irish question. Mr. Punch is not going now, but inasmuch as the Bishop
of CARiisi is reported to have asserted in the debate, that persons
who wish to afford the humbler classes the means of harmless enjoy-
ment in fresh air, on the Sunday, are “seeking to undermine the
sanctity of the Sabbath,” Doctor—what’s your protégé's name,
SHAFTESBURY?—Doctor WALDEGRAVE reminds Mr. Punch of the con-
dition of the boxer, who, after a stunning round and fall, came up
“looking mine ways for Sunday.” These new Bishops do not know
much, but must surely have read THOMAs Scott, or MAttii Ew HENRY
or DR. DoDDRIDGE, or HARtwell HoRNE, and must have discovere
that Saturday was the Sabbath, and that Sunday is the first day of the
week, and not the Sabbath. Mr. Punch will overhaul them, at a com-
petitive examination, one of these fine days.
In the Commons, a Bill for improving the law affecting the settlement
of the poor was opposed, but sent into Committee by 187 to 44, SIR
John VILLIERs SHELLEY, who was cheered, made objections to the
measure, as did others, but the common sense of the House was the
other way....MR. BAILLIE CochRANE, talked some nonsense agains:
the Garibaldi fund, and LoRD John Russelſ, said, contemptuously,
that it was scarcely necessary for him, to make any observations in
reply, but did make, a few, and put Cross-bearer Bow YER in a rage.
These convertites!. A long debate about nothing, in which much good
sense was uttered in deprecation of wasting time in talking, brought
on Army and Civil Estimates, and a good lºt of money was shelled out
up to about three in the morning, when Members thought they might
as well go home. . . - - - -
Mr. Punch subjoins an extract which the Morning StarM. him.
It illustrates his last week's mention of Loºp. Robert MostAGU's
vain attempt to keep a House while he was muddling over the Schleswig-
Holstein question.
“The Dagbladet of Copenhagen pays the following tribute to the speech of Lord
RoBERT Most AGU in the House of Commons on the 18th instant, in reference to
the Schleswig-Holstein question:—“We have never met with so many incorrect
dates, unintelligible misconceptions, and false and absurd deductions as in the
confused mass of nonsense which the noble Lord displayed to the House. The ex-
planation which the witty Punch put into the mouth of an honest Paterfamilias,
endeavouring to make the Danish question clear to his youthful heir, thirsting for
informa ion, was very much more accurate, and infinitely more intelligible."
Of course it is. We pardon our Danish friend for comparing us for
a second to Lord Robert MonTAGU. Our friend should hear that
Bobby. But we may mention that LORD ROBERT's attempt, on the
18th, was elevated into respectability by the infusion of party malice.
It is intended, when the House will listen, to try and fix upon LORD
PALMERSTON the charge of having cut sixteen hairs off the head of the
KING of DENMARK, or done º; to somebody's heirs, in order
to please. Russia, and of having denied that he had done sº...The
business is said to have been done about nine years ago. Will the
Dagbladet take his dagger-bladed knife, and give the right party a slight
prod?—Punch will put the pepper into the hole.
FOREWARNED IS DISARMED.
A Coo from a Dove.
OH ! don't be afraid .
That the French will invade
This land without any occasion;
Give them all their own way,
And I make bold to say... . -
They will ne'er trouble us with invasion.
Supreme on the seas,
They will do what they please, -
And therefore 'tis clear our right course is,
If we would have peace,
To let them increase
Their fleet, and cut down all our forces.
A FEW SCRATCHES ON PAPER.
EveRytming in Japan, if we are to believe one fractional part of
what travellers tell us, appears to be made of paper, from a pocket-
handkerchief down to a dog-kennel. The very banks may, for what we
know, be built of paper, as many a discount, or bubble-bank is with us.
If a conflagration once broke out, º: from house to house, and
running on from one hedge to another (for we are informed that the
hedges even are cut out of coloured paper, and so wonderfully imitated,
as actually to deceive the Japan sparrows), and so communicating
gradually from village to village, the mischief might in time extend over
the entire kingdom, which, the sooner it is steeped in a solution of alum,
the better it will be for its safety. - -
There is but little doubt that the whole place once ignited would
burn “like a house on fire.” It is questionable even whether the
inhabitants would escape, for with so much paper all over the place,
there is no gainsaying whether the Japanese themselves may not all be
men of letters, and if so, they would perish not less easily than the
contents of a wastepaper basket. It may be from paper entering thus
largely into all departments, that Japan itself has for centuries past
remained so stationary.
Fanning the Flame.
On the Boulevards (according to MR. KELLER) they have been selling
fans with the five portraits of the EMPEROR, the EMPREss, the PRINCE
IMPERIAL, WIcton-EMMANUEL, and GARIBALDI. The omission of one
fancy portrait certainly surprises us in such a place, and that is, that of
the i. General FAN-TI. This sixth portrait would have appro-
priately completed the series of Por/raits de Panti-sies.

THE DOLEFUL BALLADE
or
YOUNG BILL OF BANKRUPTCIE, AND YE CRUEL LORDES.
THE Lawyers they walke in Lincolne's Inn,
Sae do they in Westminster Ha',
Sae does the Members o' Parliament
Quhan they play at the jaw.
But o' Lawyers and Members is name so proud
As SIR RICHARDE YE BETHEL to see
Wiſ his briefes three-piled, and his ame faire childe,
Young BILL o' BANKRUPTCIE.
“Now gae and play, my ain younge BILL,
Shapeliest o' shapelie bairns: o
Lang ere they’ll see the match o' thee
Turned out by HUGH o' CAIRNs.”
Then awa’ and awa’ went that bonnie BILL,
'Twas its father's bairne I trow,
To the cock o’ the nose and the lisp o' the lip,
And the brass upon the brow.
Oh, proude it ran and proude it rade,
As who’d say “Here I am;”
The smooth it stept, and the rough it leapt,
To the Lordes' House till it cam.
Then Qoţ cam ST. LEONARDs—that cruel Lorde,
Said, “Come in, my BILL so fine;
We’ll busk thy brow, and dight thy mou’,
And trim yon claws o' thine.”
“My brow is buskit, my mou' is dight!
Nane claws o' mine maun trim;
My father, Iween, hath graitht me right,
And wha mends after him **
Then oot and cam the LoRDE CHELMsfortDE,
Black WENSLEYDALE oot cam he ;
They hae lured the young thinge in, wi' worde
And act o' curtesye.
They hae ta'en out each a little penknife,
And split him hair by hair;
They has twined the young thinge and his life,
i’ their cuts sae sharp and sair.
And oot, at each job, cam the thick, thick bluid,
And oot at each cut the thin;
Tº hae hacked and gashed, and snipped and slashed,
or left whole inch of skin.
They streikt him oot upon the borde,
And dressed him fair and fine,
And laughing said, “Gae now and greet
That modest father o' thine.”
They hae rowed him in the parchment scroll,
And tied him wi' the tape,
And cast him in at a pigeon-hole,
Wi’ bitter jest and jape.
Whenne prayers were read, and wi' wig on head,
The SPEAKER his seat ta'en,
Then ilka Member had his younge BILL,
But SIR RICHARD he had mane!
He rolled his gray eyne round about,
And he prayed (?) not loud but deep;
And he ran unto the Lordes' Office,
Quhair the clerkes were all asleepe.
“My bonny young BILL, my pretty young BILL,
I pray thee to me speikº
“Oh, father search the fourth pigeon-hole,
Gin ye your BILL wad seik.’
SIR RICHARD ran to the fourth pigeon-hole,
And knelt upon his knee,
“My bonny young BILL, an ye be here,
I pray thee speik to me!”
“The Lordes were wondrous cruel, father—
Their cuts are wondrous sair:
There’s St. LEONARD's his penknife in my hert,
And WENSLEYDALE’s in my hair.
“It’s ne'er a judge BRough AM gars ye have,
Nor LYNDHURST a trade assignee;

They hae hit my flaws, and pared the claws
Ye trimmed sae fair to see.
“Gaehame, gae hame, my father deir,
Tak nae mair heed o' me;
I’m no the BILI, that ye sent oot,
Sae blithe and bright o' blee.”
Then it’s up and spak SIR. Richard,
And a grisly oath he swore,
(The rest of the MS. is wanting. Diligent search is now being made
for the conclusion of this very curious old ballad among the MS. and
printed treasures of the Cottonian and Pepysian libraries.
. It is apparently founded on the same occurrence as the ballad printed
in PERCY's Collections under the title of The Jew’s Daughter. On
the same, incident, CHAUCER has founded his Prioress's Tale. The
Percy ballad, like the one Mr. Punch has given above, is a fragment.)
−:
PITY THE POLICE.
} HE Horse Guards have, in the
matter. of accoutrement, a
body of formidable rivals over
the way. These are the autho-
rities who preside over the
equipment and clothing of the
Constabulary Blues in Scot-
land Yard.
The boots of Policemen
have long been objects remark-
able for their excessive clum-
siness and disproportion. They
are obviously uncomfortable;
that we see, although none
but the wearer can know
where the shoe pinches. But
the head of the Policemen is
even worse clad than his feet
are, , though the demerits of
his hat are less conspicuous
than those of his highlows.
. The objectionable pecu-
liarities of the Policeman's
hat are chiefly its extreme
hardness and excessive weight,
which is greatest at the crown,
so that the thing is not only
- heavy, but top-heavy. It gets,
therefore, instantly knocked off in a row, and ieaves unprotected the
head which it was designed to defend. The glazed top attracts the
heat of the sun when that luminary presides over the beat, of the
wearer. Thus, rendering him hot-headed, it necessarily hinders his
obedience to the standing-order of his corps, which requires that, “a
Constable should on all occasions execute his duty with good temper
and discretion.” -
The hat of the Policeman has been compared to a chimney-pot,
wherefrom, however similar to it in shape and weight, it differs in the
important particular of not allowing the heat and exhalations which
ascend into it to escape. In want of elasticity, its resemblance to that
other cylinder is perfect. Hence it effectually resists that expansion of
the Policeman's cranium which is a condition requisite to accompany
the progressive mental development of an intelligent officer.
By night, when the path of the Policeman's duty is irradiated by the
silvery moon, or the refulgence of the gas-lamps, the glimmer reflected
by his glazed hat-cover enables thieves to recognise him at a distance,
and elude the vigilance of their pursuer. The glazed hat thus answers
a purpose which could not be more effectually served, by appending a
contrivance to the tail of his coat like the apparatus which Nature fias
attached to that of the rattlesnake. - - -
The necks of Policemen are moreover constringed with high stiff
collars and rigid leather stocks, deserving the name of black chokers,
which necessarily cause congestion of the brain. This organ of the
mind, thus overgorged with blood, undergoes a baking process within
the head enclosed by the glazed hat. Such stocks might serve for the
punishment of evil-doers, but should be, banished from the uniform of
those whose vocation it is to take offenders into custody. The police
force is not too numerous, but it may be truly said to be overstocked.
The stock of the Policeman is no light grievance, and the hat is
still heavier. The Commissioners of Police are respectfully solicited
to take stock, and hat also, with a view to necessary reform in both
particulars. They will not, surely, after this appeal, continue to expose
themselves to the too well-merited banter implied in the popular
question, “Who’s your Hatter?”

to get any money out of a Lawyer, but here is not only one, but actually
two Lawyers, voluntarily (and that constitutes the greatest part of the
wonder!) parting with money! Of course, it wasn't their own. The
fact, however, is so far pleasing (if anything can be pleasing in con;

all cavil, the long-disputed point of “Whether a lawyer has a conscience

only just escaped i. the rogues, by not publishing their

parted with so large a sum of money as £80! They must have had

And leave the place to silence and to me.
What specimens are these that meet my sight-
What's this collection the apartment holds?
These rude cartoons, where passing human height,
The huge Gorilla his long arm unfolds?
UW these walls thus vauntingly displayed
Why should those ill-stuffed skins their places keep?
Shall shallow CHAILLu our domain invade,
And into fame as a discoverer leap !
Shall these Gorilla tales that move my scorn,
On MURRAY's page by thousands thus be read?
And Zoologic bays by him be worn
That ought, by rights, to grace another head?
For him no cash shall new editions earn,
Deck’d with engravings cribbed from ST. HILAIRE:
No more shall London flion inters burn
With this MUNCHAUSEN their repasts to share.
His borrowed plumes I'll make this jackdaw yield,
Against his credit deal a sturdy stroke—
Drive his o'er-done Gorilla from the field,
Puff out his puffs, and end his tale in smoke.
What though an Owen set store by his toil,
His credit though a MURCHIsoN assure ?
His specimens I’ll view with scornful smile,
Pronounce them known, nor only known, but poor.
Cannibal Fans in public faith I’ll lower
Who can believe in Ghouls that rob the grave?

Too like a man complacence to inspire;
Although, his cerebelluh brain-o'erlaid,
Than highest Ape, makes lowest Nigger higher.
But the Gorilla has been known this age
By specimens on each Museum roll:
Men have kept young Gorillas in a cage
And found them docile creatures on the whole;
Full many a Tschiégoºmbouvé here has been

And Kooloo-Kambas here in numbers seen,
Have made the Zoologic Gardens stare.

from fields of fact to fancy's reim tº rise,
To rank as wonders of an unknown land,
And blaze transfigured in DU CHAILLU's eyes,

In Regent's Park as common creatures known,
And seen by all, to pay a bob inclined.

But pent in cages led a dreary life
ere Sunday loungers flirt the hours away.

AN ABSURDITY IN THE LAW.
ONE of the Magistrates of Marlborough Street tells us that—
“A Dog might bite any person once or twice without there being any remedy
against the owner.”
In cases of hydrophobia, we should think that being bitten once would
be more than sufficient, and we doubt if even then the poor unfortunate
calf, so lacerated, would have much of a remedy, against the owner.
MR. TYRw HITT calls it an absurdity in the law, and—
“He couldn't tell how it had its rise, but certain it is that, through some pedantic
rules, it is necessary to show that the dog in such a case was of known forócious
habits.”
Such law we call only worthy of Dogberry. A man, is answerable
for any damage done by his servant, by his horse, or his pig, or (to
lº like an Irishman) any other member of his family; and why not
then for his dog?, Does this, legal indulgence extend to all dogs?
How would it affect the Dog TEAR’EM Might he bite any one once
or twice without thore being any remedy against the constituency that
owns him, or would he be excluded from that canine privilege, inas-
much as it would be easy to show that he was a dog of “known
ferocious habits.” In the meantime, it is very comfortable, to know,
especially as the dog-days are fast approaching, that any dog might
bite you, or your child (and the naked chubby legs of children must be
very tempting to many a hungry º and you would not have a leg to
stand upon in court, unless you cou { duly show that there was a big

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“MR. PUNCH,
“‘HAVE you heard PATT1?” “What do you think of PATTI ?”
These two questions one is asked at ...} party that one goes to:
and as operatic ignorance is not always bliss, I am glad I now can
answer the first in the affirmative. When I hear the second query,
I am rather cautious in wording my reply, and am apt to sound my
hearers and ascertain their bias somewhat, lest they misunderstand me.
In speaking of a young débutante like ADELINA PATTI, one cannot be
too ºf in expressing what one thinks of her. If language was
invented to conceal one's real thoughts, in no way is this notion more
easy to be acted on than in ...; an opinion on some musical moot
point. One may speak in general terms such as, convey no special
meaning, and may murmur forth mild adjectives like ‘charming,” and
delightful,” which, now that critics have recourse to such superlative
laudation, may be accepted as amounting to faint dammatory praise.
Or if one wishes more completely to mystify the questioner and kee
secret what one thinks, it is easy to resort to musical º , all
talk scientific nonsense about ‘quality of tone,’ and “breadth of vocal
colouring, terms which none but connoisseurs affect to comprehend.
“After but one hearing who can form a fair opinion of a singer? and
who will blame me if I hesitate in telling what I think? Iºnough to
say that I was pleased, though º not quite, so much so as the
newspapers in general had led me to expect. That a mere girl of
eighteen at once should take first rank among Italian prima donnas,
and be regarded as the equal of LIND, MALIBRAN, and GRISI, was a
tale that might find credence t'other side of the Atlantic, but which
would meet with few believers in our cooler-blooded clime. Yet our
critics followed suit in singing almost unmixed praises; and some of
them have poured forth such exuberance of eulogy as makes one fear
they are leaf-taking from the Transatlantic press. No one who has
heard her, and who has not Botton's ears, can dispute that MA’AMSELLE
PATTI is a wonderfully, cleyer and highly accomplished singer-con-
sidering her age: indeed, with this consideration, if one said too highly
accomplished, it would not be far from truth. Over-cultivation may be
fatal to young voices, just as over-training is destructive to a horse;
A SUGGESTION.
How to make the Crystal Palace Concerts pay—Hint to the Directors: Verbum sap. (N.B. The Conductor is higher up, on a Flying Trapeze.)
and though I would not say that PATTI has been over-taught, I think
her voice shows traces of having been too early somewhat over-worked
Clear and sweet it is, and may grow more full and strong: a girl of
eighteen scarcely has come, to her full strength. . But it lacks that
thrilling sympathy and tenderness of tone which is a gift of nature
rather than of art, and I almost doubt if a too early education may not
be destructive of this nature-gift. The joyous cry of MALIBRAN when
waking in the last act in Sonnambula was certainly not singing, but it
was, something better; and however excellent PATTI's style may be
(and I give her special praise for discarding, the vibrato, which is now
so fashionable, and I think so foolish), I would willingly lose hearing of
her most finished phrases to catch but one of those outbursting nature.
notes of JENNY F. that stirred one’s soul within one, and, not
pleasing the ear merely, went straight to the heart.
“Foreigners are fond of saying that we English have no taste for
music, and the truth of this remark is most abundantly made manifest
by the fact that all this season the Times has daily had two columns of
musical announcements, and the Opera has been open four or five nights
eyery week. Even this, it seems, has failed to satisfy our wants, and
the Lyceum has been furnished with an operatic company to catch the
overflowings from the house that GYE built. Whatever be its faults
the rival management is quick in the performance of its promises; and
.# into thought the scratch way in which it started, I think it
should be posted as the winner of some praise. I saw Martha tºother
evening very creditably played. TITIENs and GIUGLINI were both in
lorious voice, and have rarely pleased me more than in this English,
#. Polish, and Italian opera, as it may, I think, be not unfairly called,
for the scene is laid near London, the chief air came from Ireland, the
words are all Italian, and the composer was a Pole.
“Reflecting upon things in general, the philosopher remarked,
“There’s nothin’ new, and there’s nothin’ true, and what there is don’t
signify.” Now these wise words might now find echo in our theatres

FRENCH DIPLOMACY IN PLAIN ENGLISH.
M. ThouvenEI, has addressed to the Spanish and Austrian Ambas-
sadors a despatch in reply to their invitation requesting France to
co-operate with their respective Governments in upholding, the tem-
poral power of the Pop E. From the general style of this document,
and particularly from the subjoined piece of it, we conclude that its
presentation to their Ultramontane Bºij was accompanied by a
º iºn to the effect that they might put that in their pipes
and Smoke lu :-
“The gravest dangers which now menace the temporal sovereignty of the Holy
See proceed, it is true, from without, and if the occupation of me provides for
the necessities of the present, the future remains exposed to hazards which we
sincerely wish to avert.”
This is just a diplomatic way of saying:—“Now mind, you, two
blockheads, the immediate danger which the sovereignty of the Pºpe
over the City of Rome stands in just at this moment, is no doubt that
of annexation to the Kingdom of Italy, by the Government of VicToR-
EMMANUEL. For the present, perhaps, France may manage, to sustain
the Papal chair on the points of her bayonets. That is all very well
for the time being, but this state of things won't last, and what you
have to fear by and by is, the dissolution of the Papal monarchy from
internal causes. The probability is, that the temporal º of his
Holiness, tired of the coercion to which they are º or the sup.
posed interests of religion, will at length begin to listen, to the argu-
ments of those who maintain that, his claims to infallibility, and the
vicariate of Christendom, are all bosh. The conviction that the
PoPE's spiritual supremacy is a humbug, growing in Italy, could onl
co-exist with submission to his temporal rule, under a F. whic
France would find it daily more difficult to exert. In short, the whole
papacy would ultimately blow up; and this is the catastrophe which
we want to avert if we can, though we are afraid it must happen sooner
or later. Let your master and your mistress know what we say, and
#. º º be quiet, and not allow their bigotry to induce them to act
e fools.”
NOT EXACTLY ROSEWATER.
A, CoRREspondent of the Times gives the following directions for
deodorising that substance, which is the principal component of hot-
present, cauliflowers are the only sort of flowers that we have ever beds
eaten, and although we have in eastern writings read of feasts of roses,
we have never met a traveller who has actually partaken of them. We
should almost as soon have thought of having a feast of tea-leaves as
of sitting down to breakfast, lunch, or dine off roses; and as for eating
a whole nosegay, as it seems may now be done, we should about, as
much have dreamt of supping off boiled bandboxes, or of having pickled
goosequills or stewed spectacles for lunch.
We are of course accustomed to see flowers on the dinner-table, but
we have never yet regarded them as part of the repast. Now in
future we shall fancy they are put there to be eaten; and we shall ask,
if we so choose, for a small he º of peony, just as we might do for
half a slice of pine. Crocusses and cream will take the place of straw-
berries, and one's mouth will very likely water for geraniums as it now
sometimes does for grapes. Now that flowers are found edible, there's
no telling what queer floral dishes one may dine off, queerer even than
the entrées of chopped tea-leaves and salt cucumbers, which are among
the dainties of a dinner a la Russe. A plat of grassplat served au
naturel, may take the place of salad; and for something hot and
stinging, as a tickler to the palate, a dish, of devilled nettles may be
cooked in lieu of curry, after which one will luxuriate in dandelion ice.
If ſlowers have as sweet a taste as they have smell, how gourmands
will delight when violets come in, and wait with growing gusto for the
early cabbage roses! Hashed calf's head in future wi give place to
mashed, marigolds; and aldermen who now are satisfied with turtle,
will be heard singing the º of good sunflower soup. A haunch of
venison will be followed by a bunch of fresh verbenas; dahlia dinners
down at Richmond will supplant the Greenwich whitebait, and cold
cactuses for supper will quite suppersede hot tripe.
The only thing, we fear is if young ladies take to carrying eatable
bouquets, there will be an end to all the sentimental feelings with which
a fond adorer begs a flower from his fair one, that he may put it in his
button-hole or º it to his heart. Instead of doing this he would, if
it were edible, be very much more likely to put it to his mouth; and
after having vowed that he would treasure it for ever, he would scarcely
be a moment in gobbling it all up. Moreover too the language of
flowers will no longer be suitable for purposes of sentiment; for, now
that nosegays may be eaten, a lovesick swain will shrink from so
declaring his fond feelings, lest his gift should be returned to him, and
he be reduced to eatin his own words." And just imagine the despair
of a sentimental youth, who, after having carefully composed a decla-
ration in the form of a bouquet, should find his ANGELINA munching
his fond phrases, just as coolly as she would a bit of bread and butter,
or a mouthful of dry toast !

“If those who have stable manure will take 4 oz. of sulphuric acid and two
gallons of water, and mix them in a garden watering-can, with the rose on, then
sprinkle the contents over the manure every evening (supposing it to be a cartload)
it will counteract the unpleasant smaell.”
..The writer then goes on to explain that the graveolence of the fer.
tilising compound is destroyed by the sulphuric acid in fixing the
ammonia which that compound contains. Beginners in gardening
should understand that the deodorising process is effected solely by the
|Sulphuric acid, otherwise they may form a misconception on that point
from being informed that the materials to be made, pleasant are to be
sprinkled with the contents of a watering-can which has the rose on.
APPEAL EXTRAORDINARY.
INDIA now and then gives the highest tribunal of the British Empire
some strange work to do. The other day, for instance:–
“The Judicial Committee of Privy Council sat on ºf; An Appeal from
Bengal, ‘LAME AND Wise v. BEJoy Kishem Dogs,' was heard.”
What can have been the matter in dispute between LAMB and Dogs?
The bone of contention was perhaps one which Dogs had appropriated,
but it can hardly be conceived to have belonged to LAMB, though a
mutton-bone might have been the bone of one of LAMI's ancestors,
and the property of WISE. An illustrated paper the other day pub-
lished a portrait of a little dog named “Loofy” found in the Summer
Palace at Pekin. Looty is a nice Indian name for a dog; but let us
hope that it is one not applicable to the Dogs BEJOY and KISHEM.

TRIP OF ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
THE flash of electricity that courses along the telegraphic wire occa-
sionally makes a shocking, mistake. There are reasons for trustin
that a grave blunder is involved in the subjoined telegrams despatched,
the other day, from the Eternal City:-
“No improvement has taken place in the health of the Pope.
“Reactionary agents have been sent to Umbria and the Marches.”
If the former of the two announcements above quoted stood alone, it
would afford too much reason to apprehend that his Holiness the Pope
was seriously ill. But it assumes the character of a mistatement when
taken in connection with the latter. Put this and that together, and
you will then see good cause for supposing that to be a blunder. The
information that reactionary agents have been sent to Umbria and the
Marches, is rather, inconsistent than otherwise with the news of the
implied illness of the Pope; for, if it is true, there is fair ground for
hoping that the Sovereign Pontiff is at least well enough to attend to
business. At the same time, the mission of reactionary agents to
foment disturbance in the newly constituted Kingdom of Italy, is, on
the other hand, a fact which not only agrees with, but confirms, the
tel relative to Pio NoNo, corrected in accordance with reasonable
conjecture. “No improvement has taken place in the ideas of the
Pope.”. Such, no doubt, is what the message would have been if
#. transmitted. Let us, therefore, rejoice in concluding that his
oliness is bodily in good case, and, barring infatuation and obstinacy,
has nothing the matter with him, but is all alive and kicking.
“A sound conscIENCE PRODUCEs sound sleer.”—M. F. Tupper.
We are told that, “as a man makes his bed, so he must lie in it.”
It is so with a bankrupt; for we find that, when his balance-sheet is
not drawn up all straight, there is generally awfullying in it.
HORSE WEAL.
IN the subjoined passage touching a certain one out of a number of
Young racehorses, that amusing and instructive sporting writer,
#." has probably afforded some cause of misunderstanding to
rance : —
“But Brother to Summerside, by West Australian out of Ellington, is the gem of
the lot, and without exception the very finest yearling I ever beheld in my life, and
will make many a poor man's mouth water."
A little further on our author tells us, that the Palmyra colt.“will
make as nice an animal as a man would like to look, at.”. We, of
course, understand what is meant by a horse that will make a poor
man's mouth water, and by ene that, is as nice an animal as a man
would wish to look at. But how will M. DE, ST. HILAIRE and the
Société Hippophagique of Paris construe such language in application
to horseflesh? º they will conclude it to imply that we are
accustomed to look at horses with eyes like their own, with eyes such
as those which, at the Fat Cattle Show, carnivorous citizens may be
observed contemplating the prize oxen. Perhaps the Parisian Dogsmeat
Association will be induced, by the information above quoted, to send
an agent over, here with a commission to purchase the animals which,
to their apprehension, it will have represented in a savoury character.
The Society of Horseaters will doubtless, be willing to pay the price
that may be demanded for the colts which they would want to convert
into equine veal, if they can possibly afford it, which is not certain; for
although they may have more money than brains, it does not therefore
follow that they are very rich.
“ALL ALIVE, OH !”—Friendship, it must be confessed, is of a far
more cannibalistic turn than º . Men are merely bitten by their
enemies, but they are eaten up by their friends.

UCH astonishment seems to

Forty-first Wolume. It came
unintroduced, and has been

sº to, as a sºrt of intruder. As
§ ºf nobody else knows anything

N$ Punch has not the least hesi-
§
tation in stating, of his own
personal knowledge, that it

§ in the time of KING ALFRED,

of JAMEs Til E FIRST, 1473,
and that it will be seen again
on the 29th of April, 1984,
about ten o’clock in the
evening. If any astrono-
mer, or other person, doubt
this last fact, Mr. Punch is
open to an offer of the usual
British method of settling a dispute, and the amount of the bet, large or
small, may be deposited at his Office, to await the event. His publisher
of that day will hand it to the posterity of the winner on a certificate
from the lineal descendant of the Astronomer Royal, whom Mr. Punch
hereby requests to register the offer in the archives of Greenwich.
CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE FOR LADIES.
“MR. PUNCH, -
“IT is pleasing to find Pictorial Art linked hand in hand with
Poetry and Science; the group standing, so to speak, in the attitude of |
the Three Graces. This remark is suggested by two paintings which
adorn the walls of the Royal Academy Exhibition. In each of them
there is a delightful representation of a young female, who bears the
interesting name of ELAINE...I say interesting, because, as you know
ELAINE, or OLEINE, is the liquid constituent of adipose matter and
every student of chemistry must regard with interest the idea of that
fluid consolidated in such lovely forms as those above specified.
“ELAINE has been well chosen by a great living poet for the name of
a heroine. But ELAINE, as I need not inform you, has a sister,
STEARINE, the crystalline component of fat; in order to obtain her
you treat mutton suet with ether. Shall STEARINE want a sacred
bard to immortalise her? Can't you get one of your young men to do
it, Mr. Punch *-and, if there is º to paint her, at least you
might desire a talented artist of your own to draw her likeness on
wood; and then STEARINE would be a beauty without paint. Qr what
say you to giving us a Cartoon, whereof , the subjects shall be
‘STEARINE and ELAINE, or the Two Sisters.’ It might perhaps be
remarked that ELAINE and STEARINE were the daughters of FATIMA:
Excuse this perhaps too venturous suggestion from your philosophical
subscriber, “AIRPUMP.”
“P.S. Many pretty names might be culled from the flowery paths of
Chemistry; names, like ELAINE and STEARINE, ending in ine.
is GLYCERINE, for instance, and CHLORINE, and Bromise, which
i. N. be a sweet name for a young lady in the habit of using

Railway Transport of Beasts.
IN, a letter to the Times, “WIATOR’’ complains that, on the London
and Canterbury Railway, he was greatly annoyed by the behaviour of
five ruſſians who, º drunk, were locked up with him in a crowded
third-class carriage. That, of course, was not the fault of the Company,
which, however, will now, from this time forward, no doubt, take care
that its guards shall not inflict blackguards on respectable people...It
will set all the other Railway Companies the example of establishing
tipsy-carriages, or sof-boxes, in which drunken passengers shall be
shut up all by themselves, like pigs.

DAME DURDEN ON THE BELGRAWIAN
DIFFICULTY.
I’ve got no patience with the gals there's all that talk of in the papers,
As runs up sitch tremendious bills at jewellers and linen-drapers;.
Their mothers is as bad and wus to bring 'em up with sitch high notions:
What man would marry wives like them though tens of thousands was
their potions?
A fiel dress on for every meal, for breakfast, lunch, and tea, and
Inner,
Sitch vanity and pride as that I calls the conduck of a sinner.
To think of tea at five o’clock, your “kettledrum,” and dinin’ arter,
Drat ye, I’d be about your house if one of you was my own darter!
And then your uproars and your routs, although the rising sun gives
Warning, -
Yet on you capers, dancin’ to the tune We won't go home till Morning ;
What man as likes his materal sleep would ever think for to incumber
His *: . her as keep sitch º in place of right and proper
Slumber :
But what the most I can't abide is all that Rotten Row paradin',
And which it is, I will maintain, unworthy of a British maiden;
I wouldn't wish, and never did, to see young gals demure as Quakers,
But I W.it. . Don't talk to me, git out with all them bold horse-
reakers ''
I’m told they learnt you fust to wear them pork-pie hats so frce and
ghty,
A pretty copy to be sure, to set the fashions, highty-tighty! -
And which is which 'tis hard to tell, you'realisoforºad and so jaunty,
With crinolines and Balmorals fantastical and gallivaunty.
Ah! there, I know in my young days we never durst a word to mention,
Qf sitch º now as occupies gals' conversation and attention, .
Which I declare I’m shocked to hear, their imperence is so amazin,
I never thought that I should live to see young women grow so brazen.
And what can their mammas expect, that makes so sad a lamentation?
Nobody comin for to woo; who would I wonder? Botheration'
The hussies can't get husbands! none, it stands to reason, could endure

A broomstick or nice rope's end is what I’d take to 'em to cure 'cm.
A CRUEL JOKE.
WE are glad to see that the Officers of Health and others are prose-
cuting the country butchers and salesmen for sending putrid meat up
to the Metropolitan markets. At a recent case, tried at the Mansion
House,_
“ALDERMAN HALE said he knew there were a class of persons in the country
who thought Londoners would eat any kind of meat, º they thought it a good
joke if they could only succeed in palming off their bad meat upon the London
consumers, and he, therefore, would commit defendant for trial.”
We have no doubt that there is a certain class of country butchers
who, in their extreme facetiousness, fancy that anything is good enough
for the stupid Cockneys; but we beg to tell these funny gentlemen
that such “a joke”, may be great sport to them, but it is certain
death to those at whose expense the filthy joke is cut. It is all done
in the way of jesting; and we suppose, if they do poison a few
hundreds, that they must be excused, for they “poison but in jest.
The old saying of “What is one man's meat is another man's poison”
ecomes thus Fº verified; the “meat” of the country, sent u
in this º state, is literally the “poison” of the Metropolis. We
notice that several of these Poisoners of the Nineteenth Century have
been punished with severe fines. Imprisonment with hard labour would
be a fitter reward for such jocular depravity. Perhaps they might not
consider three months' employment in picking oakum as “good a joke”
as disseminating disease through the medium of meat in a º:
state. To perpetrate jokes of so killing, a nature, the minds of the
malefactors must be almost as corrupt as the wares they dealin. Their
slaughterhouses were never intended for human beings as well as
animals. The City. Magistrates are to be highly commended for
attempting to stop this extension of the butcher's business.
A very Natural Mistake.
LoRD DUFFERIN, the British Commissioner in Syria, has been
appointed a Knight Commander of the Bath. As Syria is compre-
hended in the Ottoman Empire, the Bath with whose order his Lord-
ship has been decorated will, perhaps, be erroneously imagined to be
the Turkish Bath.

WANTED A COURT PENMAN.
Roy AL personages, in answering loyal addresses, of course speak
only that which is set down for them. If they made speeches of their
own, they would be continually committing themselves, unawares, to
this statement and that, and unwittingly treading upon the corns of
various people right and left. At least, to avoid making mistakes
of this sort, they would have to take an amount of trouble in com-
posing, their replies, so great that it would, very much interfere
with their ordinary business, and entirely spoil their pleasure. It is
therefore necessary that Princes should be provided with attendants
having the office to compose, and put into form, the platitudes in which
they are called upon, from time to time, to acknowledge the compli-
ments which are paid to them. But then the platitudes ought to be
expressed in proper terms, such as it may become a Prince to utter;
that is in language which a decently educated person would naturally
use. Now, is anybody who has been brought up in any school better
than a Commercial Academy, capable of delivering himself in such a
style as that of the subjoined slipslop which the PRINCE OF WALEs had
to read in answer to an address presented to him by the Kingstown
Commissioners?
“Gentlemen, I most heartily thank you for the gratifying terms in which, on
your own behalf and that of the inhabitants of Kingstown, you greet me on my
arrival at your port, after a voyago performed with such ease and expedition in the
admirable vessel considerately placed at my disposal by its enterprising pro-
prietors."
What gent was it that made up this mixture of pompous vulgarisms?
Gratifying.” terms: Voyage performed with such “case and expe-
dition.” “Admirable vessel considerately placed at my disposal by its
enterprising proprietors.” . Why these are all the familiar phrases of
puffing tradesmen's advertisements. The last of the foregoing passages
relative to the Connaught and the Steam-Packet Company, would l
one to suppose it to have been written by somebody in the interest of
that concern. It would probably be unjust to a well-informed and sen-
sible man to suggest that its author was the steward of the above-
named vessel.
His Royal Highness is also actually made to say:-
“During former visits to Ireland, and particularly in the course of a tour made

the IIiſh Tope, did not think it by

Some clue to the authorship of the preceding instances of haber-
dashers' eloquence º perhaps be found in, those characteristic forms
of speech, “considerable" opportunities, and “witnessing” the beauty
ºf her scenery. These are the notorious idioms of that sort of penny-a-
lining which is the least worth a penny. The advisers of the PRINCE
or WALEs, should cause their own private secretaries to write the
speeches which they give the PRINCE to make, and not employ for that
jurpose the undermost reporter engaged on the Court Circular. At
east let the QUEEN’s son be allowed to speak his Mother's English.
As there is a Poet-laureate, so likewise ought there to be a Royal
Professor of Prose, whose office, however, shall not be merely honorary,
but shall consist in plainly wording the simple ideas which Royalty
is occasionally called upon to express. Mr. Punch could mention some

Sabbatarian exclusion of the people from that place of moral and intel-
lectual recreation. If these bigots or humbugs, are, consistent, the
must believe that the injunction to “consider the lilies of the field”
is one that ought not to be observed on Sundays.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 1, Monday. BISHOP TAIT, of London, announced, on behalf of
the ARCHBISHOP QF CANTERBURy and the Church generally, that they
would hail a speedy settlement of the Church Rate question, and would
deplore any settlement that should leave a rankling in the minds of
their dissenting brethren. It seems difficult to speak more civilly than
spoke DR, TAIT, who is a zealous and earnest hierarch, and who might
have been seen on the previous Sunday preaching in the open air to the
heathen of Covent Garden, LORD BRough AM expressed his conviction
that in the matter of St. Domingo we ought not to place the slightest
confidence in the º º not to introduce slavery into that
island; and though the Colonial Secretary begged BRough AM not to be
so rude, LORD STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE observed that Spain takes
º º of cheating.
The Commons considered the Four Seats Bill. MR. ToM DUN.com BE
amiably pointed out the fact that the Government had been thoroughly
beaten ºn this, question, and had been forced to abandon, the principle
on which they had declared the Bill to be based. Defeated in the attempt
to create a new metropolitan borough, and mixed up in the defeat on
the attempt to give a third Member to Middlesex, they succumb to the
dictation of the majority, and hand over the extra Member to the West
Riding. LoRD FERMoy, also, and other Government supporters,
animadverted upon the abandonment of principle. But MR. DUN.
Coyº's attempt to overthrow the Bill was baffled by 204 to 28. Then
two Scotchmen demanded a Member for the Scottish Universities, and
SIR JAMES GRAHAM postponed the claim of the London University, and
suppºrted that of the Ri ; and it was finally settled that after the
dissolution of this present Derbyite Parliament, the West Riding of
Yorkshire shall be split into North and South, and that each shall have
its share of Wapentakes (which may be something nice to eat for any.
thing, Mr. Punch knows), and the two portions shall each have two
Members, and the chief electoral place for the North shall be Leeds,
and, that for the South shall be Pontefract, at which latter place the
celebrated MR. GULLY was returned, and the celebrated Mr. SAYERs
may be returned if the constituency likes him.
Our friend PAM's Ministry is getting divers knocks and kicks, and
| does not look very strong on its pins just now, while the Tories are
showing together, shoulder to shoulder; and if it were not for Foreign
Affairs there might be “an ugly rush,” and in, spite of foreign affairs
something of the kind may not be far off. But that is our friend
PAM's own business. Mr. Punch is sorry, however, that LoRD P. is
not strong enough to carry out his own-intentions as, to the legal ap-
§§ He caused it to be proclaimed to the world that he had got
MR. RoundELL PALMER for Attorney-General, and that SIR WILLIAM
ATHERTON was to go up as judge. Now, it appears that the Liberal
parliamentary barristers kicked up such a horrible row about the be-
stowal of the Attorney-Generalship upon MR. PALMER, who was a kind
of Peel-Conservative, and certainly not one of the Liberal }. , that
PAM was obliged to give way, stick ATHERTON, who is a third-rater,
into the place, just vacated Sir Ricºrn fºrmeil, and put in
PALMER as Solicitor. The which concession argueth not a conviction
on the part of the Constable that, the present, Ministerial arrange;
ments are likely to outlast the world. It is said that the PAIMER still
wears the Conservative cockle-shell, and comes in “with liberty of
reservation.”
Civil Estimates came on, and the Wiscount, who shall be, discoro-
netted for the night, as a mark of respect, because he twice talked very
good sense, made some remarks upon the people having to keep u
Hampton Court Palace for members of the aristocracy. Answere:
MR. Cowper with the usual official humbug-the infusion of a grain of
truth in a pint of falsehood: “Her Ma ." had given permission for
the widows of distinguished officers to be lodged there.” Very nice,
and nothing would be more delightful to Englishmen than to know that
such homes were provided for those who were dear to Qur heroes. But.
“There are three widows in the Palace, and the rest of the apartments
are given up to remnants of the aristócracy.” The money was voted,
but the false pretence was smashed. Then it was arranged that the mass
of bronze an *ś, called the Wellington Car should be put
away into a crypt of St. Paul's, where nobody need see it (as MR.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
º and nearly £100,000 was given for keeping up Parks and
alaces. In the course of this discussion complaints were made of the
new encroachment in Kensington Gardens. Mr. Punch personally in-
spected this Ride the other day, and it appears to him that so far from
its being a harmless arrangement, it is a cutting up of one of the most
º walks in the Gardens. It is, very hard that people with six
egs can’t go a little further off, and leave the only pretty garden in
London to people with two legs only. Then came the votes for the
ornamentation of the new Houses, and MR. WILLIAM WILLIAMs spoke
up for a statue to one of the ablest generals, greatest statesmen, and
wisest rulers that England has ever produced, he meant QLIVER CROM;
WELL. The House received this just homage to King OLIVER so well
that MR. CowPER, who had said that CROMWELL should not be forgot-
ten, seemed frightened, and explained that he had only meant that the
Protector's name was in the statue-index, and that the question might
come on hereafter...Whereat there was derision. When the statue is
to be erected, Mr. Punch, as a Protestant, intends to protest against its
being inserted between the images of King OLIVER's predecessor and
successor. For GEORGE CANNING adduced proof that CHARLES THE
FIRST was a, Papist, and CHARLEs THE SEcoSD's, apostacy was no
secret, and old Noll would not stand comfortably between a Popish
tyrant and a Popish traitor. Let him be set by himself, and when the
time comes, Mr. Punch will supply him with an inscription from the
works of JEREMY TAYLOR, who married an unlawful daughter of the
FIRST CHARLEs, and yet did not get much out of his brother-in-law,
the SECOND.
Tuesday. The NoFMANBY snub was more effectually administered
than usual. N. wants to make a speech about the DUKE OFMoDENA—one
of the tyrants thrust out by Italy, and charitably forgotten by everybody
but such people as LORD NORMANBy. BROUGHAM and GRANyILLE
advised him to hold his tongue, but the old goose persisting, the Lords
cried “order” till he shut up.
A very, sensible speech by the Bishop of LoNDON. He opposed a
feeble Bill for the Union of Benefices, and described it as a measure for
enabling any persons who could get, £40,000 together to have a Bishop
for their money. Why, if this Bill passed, it would be as much the
fashion for a millionnaire to have a Bishop of his own as to have abutler.
A rich marchioness would probably have two, taking care that they
should be alike in regard to calves and Calvinism. Qur Bishop pro-
ceeded to allude to the Church-Rate question, and said, pluckily, that
it ought to be discussed in the Commons, that disagreeable things
might be said there, but that they would not rankle unless they con-
tained truth. He did not want any great addition of Bishops, for he
did not approve of the principle of constant interference by authorities.
But he was for making Deans useful, and for other reforms. The
Bishop's speech "...# elicited praise from the Gold-Boy, MERCATOR
OvERSTONE, and the Bill was demolished by 68 to 11. -
LORD ELLENBOROUGH, speaking of the necessity of keeping a Reserve
of Naval Officers, declared his conviction that a war was “inevitable,”
and that it might come upon us at any moment. When the Elephant
trumpets, the j. is usually in ambush—but our old elephant has not
been in work of late, and may be a little nervous.
On a Scotch School Bill in the Commons, MR. Bouverſe told a
goodish story—a schoolmaster had a fixed allowance, and naturally did
not want more work than he could not avoid, so whenever new boys
came he used to flog them perpetually, until their parents took them
away, and left him to his gentler occupations. A new writ was moved
for. Durham,_SIR WILLIAM ATHERTON becoming Attorney-General,
vide supra. By the way, MR. WEGUELIN (who was defeated at South.
ampton by electors who showed their fitness for the franchise by pre-
ferring that loud-mouthed patriot DIGBY SEYMoUR) came in to-day for
Wolverhampton—and is a gain to the House.
LORD PALMERSTON, who is famed for Anglican ignorance as to when
he is beaten, did not look blue when the ATHERTON writ was asked,
but was presently chaſling VINCENT SCULLY, and amid roars, offering
him, by implication, the situation of Lord of the Treasury, vacated by
the ungrammatical BAGwÉII. A proposal by LoRD ENFIELD to com.
pensate certain parsons for their losses in burial fees by the shutting up
abominable graveyards, was lost by 59 to 48.
“For a difference one cannot call nil
The Commons perceives, be it said;
'Twixt the Enfield that’s rifled to kill,
And the Enfield who’d rifle the dead.”
What MR. POPE HENNEssy's special interest in Poland may be is
not clear. Perhaps he advocates her cause to show that when fiberty
is quite unattainable by a nation, Papists have no objection to clamour
on its behalf, though, when there is a chance of freedom for a people, as
in Sicily, Tuscany, Napies, and elsewhere, the Roman Catholic orator
invariably denounces the revolutionist as a wicked and ungratef
reprobate. , But it does not diminish the wrongs of Poland that they
are pleaded by the friends of tyranny—it may be said to increase them.
To-night, Poland having been made a peg for a speech by MR. HEN-
NEssy, another Irish gentleman, MR. Scully, declared that the case of
foianá was not nearly so bad as that of Ireland. Not a bad hint,
SCULLY. sº we civilise Ireland by partition between Britanni
Caledonia, and Cambria. We have done it this week, and have sen
the DUKE OF CORNWALL for the first, the DUKE of Rothsay for the
second, and the PRINCE OF WALEs for the third, to take possession,
and receive homage, and the Irish have submitted very graciously.
Sold again, Scully. LoRD JoHN RUSSELL and Lord PALMERston
both spoke, not so much in answer to an idle speech, as to express the
feeling of themation on the Polish partition. The Anointed committed
a crime against which England has ever protested, and though at
present there is no chance of wrenching away the plunder, we may hope
that one day. Poland will regain her rights. She erred much, chiefly
through the vices incarnate in her aristocracy and her priesthood, but
both will have been purified by the ordeal, and her punishment has
already exceeded her offence.
Government decide that to interfere with the anchors and cables of
merchant vessels is out of their line, and as these articles, on which the
lives of thousands of brave fºllows depend, are to a large extent made
upon the true principles of Trade, namely, as badly as is compatible
with obtaining payment from the purchaser, the QUEEN’s sailors may
rejoice that if worse paid than the merchant-sailors they are better
cared for. The Adair-expulsions were brought up once more, but the
House was disgusted with the iteration, and by 88 to 23 decided on
hearing no more about it, LoRD PALMERSTON throwing in a hint, that
hit, to the effect that º who, for mere gain, cleared away their
tenantry, were worse than a man who thought, however erroneously,
that he was crushing crime.
Wednesday. Through Committee went the Bill for enabling members
of the Universities, when a Parliamentary election takes place, to send
their votes, in writing, and thus be spared the trouble and expense
of a journey. The majority of University electors are non-resident, and
this arrangement will º very convenient to them, MR. AYRTON, how-
ever, thought that divers clergymen, who are so busy in their country
parishes that they seldom come into the world that is illuminated by
the presence of Metropolitan Members and the like, would be bene-
fici stirred up by being compelled to mix, occasionally, in society.
But the Commons thought that the .." indulgence was just and
considerate, and affirmed the principle of the Bill by rather large majo:
rities. That frenzied revolutionist and agitator, MR. WALPOLE, moved
the Second Reading of a Bill intended to do away, to a certain extent,
with the nuisance called a Grand Jury, a Bill that has passed the
reckless innovators and destructives in the House of Lords; but the
obdurate Conservative, AYRTON, was again in the field with opposition,
and was cruelly ridiculcd for his loquacity by SIR. G. LEwis. The
debate was adjourned.
Thursday. The Lords read the Harbours Bill a Second Time. It is,
as Mr. Punch has before mentioned, a very good Bill, and enables
Government to spend £300,000 a year on ii. ours, also doing awa
with some passing tolls. LoRD Norm ANBY of course, “protested,”
was snubbed by LORD DONOUGHMORE, and went away happy. LoRD
CAITHN Ess, who has taken a steam-carriage of his own, moved the
Second Reading of a Bill for permitting locomotives to be used on
º roads. It seemed rather to startle their Lordships, but they
et lt go on.
MR. BRAND moved a New Writ for Richmond, for MR. RICH
(HENRY DRUMMOND’s “pig that squeaked because it could not get at
nourishment’’) has at last vacated his seat, in order, it is supposed, to
let in the new Solicitor-General. No act of MR. RICH's parliamentary
life-and, mind, he has been a useful public servant—became him like
the leaving it.
MR, DILLWYN complained that the State was educating too much,
MR. Os BORNE complained that the Volunteers fired too much, MR.
SCULLY complained that the reporters cut down his speeches too much,
MR. S. FitzGERALD complained that Spain was encroaching on Morocco
too much, and then the House went at the Civil Estimates, on which
everybody complained that we spend too much. There were several
rather good fights—the principal one being on those Dublin Gardens,
and in this case it was resolved that if the Gardens were not to be
W. on the Sunday, the managers should not have the public money.
What does Doctor Waipºvº say to that? Still, the House showed
a due sense of religion, for it voted £800 for a stained window for Glas-
gow Cathedral, an edifice which Mr. Punch states, ear cathedré, to be
now kept in a way that does honour to the curators, and which shames
those who have charge of divers similar places in this prelatical country.
Friday. LoRD SHAFTESBURY made an excellent speech in favour—
no, not of sending thirty or forty Bishops to India, but actually of
improving that, country by secular means, namely, by irrigation.
Government said that they were doing all they could in the hydraulic line.
The Commons were more miscellaneous than amusing. Another
Irish evidence case was brought on, but the House is growing sayage
at being made the tribunal for such squabbling; and in spite of the
usual awful words which Irishism uses on all occasions—“mean impos-
ture,” “fendish tyranny,” and so on, kicked out the business by 60 to 15.
Corrupt Wakefield wants to elect again, but PEELIDEs GLADSTONE,
for Government, considered that the naughty borough ought still to be
locked out, by way of lesson, and so thought the House, by 173 to 123.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LATEST FROM AFRICA.
HERE was a Scientific
Meeting held one
evening in last week,
at which M. Du
Chaillu thought fit
to put an end to a
discussion on the
merits of his book
by spitting in the
face of a gentleman
who questioned them.
Such a way of ar-
= guing may be tole-
# ra possibly at a
meeting of Gorillas,
but, happily, among
Englishmen it has
not yet been sanc-
tioned. If M. DU
CHAILLU, or any
other traveller,
wishes to indulge in
it, we should advise
him, as a place which
is nominally ..".
nial, to take up his
residence somewhere
in Spitz-bergen.
A MARYLEBONE MOONCAL.F.
MR. PUNCH reads in the Daily Telegraph a statement, from which
the following is an extract:—
“MARYLEBONE WESTRY AND LOCAL SELF-Government.—The anniversary festival
of the St. Marylebone representative vestºry, to celebrate theſº: of local self-
government, was held at the Lower Welsh Harp, Hendon. e Chair was occupied
by Mn. CHURCHwanden FILMER. The cloth being drawn, the Chairman proposed
the loyal and patriotic toasts, which were disposed of with the usual enthusiasm.
MR. C. FREETH, in proposing “The Marylebone Wºº. coupled with the principle
of local self-government, contended that England, Wales, Ireland, and tland
were still seeking for, and would not rest satisfied until an extension of the great
rinciple of local self-governmeut had been obtained. If London, for instance, had
|. self-government as it ought to have—that was, a proper municipality—the
strong difference of opinion with regard to the horse ride in Kensington Gardens
would not exist. He concluded by calling upon the vestry of Marylebone not to be
frightened out of defending their rights through being run down by Punch.”
It is clear that an orator may be very acceptable to the Marylebone
Westry men, although invidious circumstances may have withheld, from
that }. the privilege of being taught to read. Nor would Mr.
Punch be hard upon this poor unfortunate FREETH, on account of the
defects in his education. Perhaps there was no charity-school in the
locality in which FREETH was born. But as it appears, that LORD
FERMoy and MR. HARVEY LEwis had to join this dinner at the Lower
Welsh Harp, and to endure the snobbism of influential constituents,
and as both gentlemen endeavoured to beguile that #. of affliction
by "...i speeches, Mr. Punch takes it for granted that either one or
the other i the courage to say something of this sort:-
“But, Gentlemen, as for our friend MR. FREETH's allusion to Punch, I must say
that accustomed as I am to hear Marylebone Westrymen talk as an ass might be
expected to talk, if endowed with language, I did not expect to hear, even from a
Marylebone Westryman, such an outrageous piece of idiotic absurdity as that of
which our foolish FREETH has just been guilty. Punch try to frighten you out of
asserting your rights I Why, FREETh must be a fool. It was Mr. Punch who saved
Kensington Gardens from the equestrians last year. Do you think that the
Honour ABLs MR. CowPER, and the rest of his aristocratic friends, would have cared
a farthing for the remonstrances of all the Marylebone Westrymen who ever dropped
a naitch. Bah! It was Mr. Punch who saved the Gardens. He stood out man-
fully*f; the Annexation. He told the Swells that it was too bad. His preter-
natural influence, and not your blatant botheration, did the thing for you. And
now, if you will read his pages, week after week (I don't address myself to poor
FREETH, whose power of reading is limited), you will see that he is again exerting
his energies to have the rhododendron walk restored to your wives and children. He
will succeed, too, but it is more than you deserve that 3. should take this trouble
for a set of muffs who will not even read what he says, or cannot comprehend it
when º: read it. Mr. Punch is your best friend. He ridicules your follies,
puts you in the right road, and flogs you like winking when you try to get out of it;
and instead of talking or enduring vulgar nonsense about him, you ought to be
down on your Marylebone marrowbones, thanking him for his gracious conde-
scension and assistance. Kick FREETH out, and pass the bottles.”
Mr. Punch does not read anything of this kind in the Telegraph's
report, but it must have been said, for LoRD FERMoy and MR. HARVEY
Lewis are gentlemen, and perhaps the Telegraph was pressed for room.

ment? The House of Commons thinks that CROMwFLI, ought to have
one of them because he was a “distinguished man.” The PROTECTOR
was something more than that; which, if it alone constituted a title to
a statue, would be a sufficient reason for conferring that honour on a
eat, many persons named in history. Among these there is one who
las at least as good a right to be represented in the House of Commons
as the constituencies which return MR. MAGUIRE, MR. Pope HEN-
NEssey, and SIR GEORGE Bowy ER. Need we say that we mean GUY
FAWKEs P. The effigy of that worthy has never yet been done in
marble or brass; and fashioned in either of those substances, on the
traditionary model, it would form a suitable companion to certain other
images which adorn the Temple of Collective Wisdom. Or, con-
structed of its usual temporary materials, it would do well enough,
and be quite in keeping with an edifice made of crumbling stone, which
requires continual repair.
here are several reasons why Guy FAwkEs should have a Parlia-
mentary statue. He would afford a congenial subject to the British
sculptor. . If he were placed in a suitable situation, his lantern, con-
taining a jet of burning gas, would serve to supply legislators retiring
from the scene of their labours with a convenience for lighting their
cigars... GUY, moreover, represented in his customary costume, with
its familiar appurtenances, would stand a silent monitor to the House
of Commons, suggesting to Honourable Gentlemen the idea of being
blown up, which is the mildest fate that some of them deserve for
wasting the time and hindering the business of the nation by their
stupid loquacity.
OUR MUSICAL POLICE.
MR. PUNCH has been officially authorised to state that the following
is not the proper Programme of the music which was performed in his
Arcadia by the newly started bands of the Police:–
1. Overture. “We're a Band of Bobbies.”
2. Stop (Thief) Waltz. By a Member of the Force.
. Air with variations, “Till so gently Stealing.”
. Pas Redoublé. “Off, off, said the Burglar.” (Slopen)
. Fantasia on the Rattle, with hobblegato pedal movement.
Galop. The Bull's eye. (WALKER.)
. March, slow time: illustrative of a policeman coming up when wanted.
. Selection from the Beggar's Opera, followed by the Tramp chorus, and ending
with “The Rogue's March," and “Go, Idle Boy,” arranged as a tremolo
fugued finale.
9. Serenade (to a prisoner), “Here in Cool Spot, and Mossy Cell."
10. Quick step. “To the Crank / To the Crank / Oh come there with me!”
11. Pot Pourri of Popular Airs, including, (1) “The For he stood at the Area Gate.
(2) “Come where my Cook sits Beaming,” (3) “0 the Cold Mutton of England f"
(4) “Clar de Kitchen,” (5) finale, agitato molto “The Missus is Coming,
Oh dear! Oh dear/"
12. National Anthem.
“Since Peelers first at PEEL's command
Arose to end Old Charley's reign,
What gallant men have joined the Band
Now led by brave Sia Richard MAYNE 1"
Mr. Punch may likewise state that being honoured with a special
invitation so to do, he himself “attended hearing” of the pieces which
were played; and he begs leave to congratulate the amateur performers
on the attention which they paid to the beat of their Inspector—he
means to say, Conductor—and the skill they showed in following the
truncheon which he waved. Mr. Punch would add a hope that in all
their movements harmony may constantly prevail, and that they may
always be found to act in concert, whether in taking up a chord or in
taking up a thief.
Answer Given to any Question at the Shortest Notice.
MR. BERNAL Osborn E was anxious to know what the duties were
under the office recently appointed of “Instructor of Military Cookery.
It must be, we should say, for the purpose of “cooking the accounts;”
or, it may be, to teach the raw recruits how properly in cooking to
make a mess of it; or, #. it may be with the object of giving those
very raw recruits a good dressing every time they deserveit, QspoRNE,
my little dear, you pay your money (that is, your usual 3d. for this
week's number), and so you are at perfect liberty to take your choice.

TREMENDOUS CREATION OF PEERS.
Qua friend, the Morning Star, having abandoned its scrap.
of daily untruth about the Lords and the Paper Duty, now
worries the Upper House in a way which Mr. Punch un:
hesitatingly pronounces to be serviceable to himself and
the country. It gives the highest and lowest number of
Lords present on each evening of debate. But such statis-
tics should be reliable. Either the hot weather and its
necessary correctives must have acted upon the visual
organs of the Star's Tellers, or the Queen has been amusing
her leisure by an enormous creation of Peers. For on
Thursday, the 4th, according to the Star, the lowest num-
ber of Peers present was 12, and the highest Six Hundred
AND Eighty-ONE. CAPTAIN DoD made up the Roll of
the Lords in February last, and counted only 457 in all.
Will the Star give us the list of new ones—the odd 224?
or must Punch prepare it? Has Our Wiscount “gone

little too “loud.”
THE BOURBON MEMORY.
.According to a popular proverb, experience, confers wisdom on a
kind of persons who were naturally born without any. Such a person
º arently is the one who penned the following conclusion of a letter
essed to the editor of the Union, Parisian journal, and dated from
Rome:–
"A legitimate and strong Government supporting itself on representative insti-
tutions is the only one which can render liberty compatible with order, and put an
end to the profound anarchy, and to the excesses of all kinds, which foreign
domination causes to weigh on my country.—Accept, &c.,
“FRANcois De Bourbox, Count de Trapani."
When a Bourbon regains the crown which he had lost, he is, it is
said, found to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. This,
rhaps, is a mistake. The Bourbons do learn. The Count DE
RAPANI, is a Bourbox who has learned something. He has learned
that the best of all political systems, especially for Naples, is “a legiti-
mate and strong jº supporting itself on representative insti-
tutions.” . Should his family ever, unhappily, be restored to the throne
from which the son of BoMBA was obliged to bolt, will they preserve
those ideas concerning constitutional government which, if he correctly
expresses their opinions, they entertain at present? Will they re-
member, in prosperity, the convictions on the subject of representative
institutions which they have imbibed in adversity? May their memo
never be put to the test; but if it ever is, their unlucky subjects wi
Fº nd, not that they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing,
ut that they have learned something and forgotten something; namely,
the, perception, which has been acquired by the Count DE TRAPANí
of the preferableness of government ºld; on a representative basis
to tyranny.
A Secret out of the Prison-House.
Wom EN, when they get together, talk about themselves, or their
children, their servants, their dresses, their rivals, their conquests,

ECONOMY IN DRESSING.
PRESIDING, the other day, over a Meeting in connection with the
British and Foreign School & º, i
of a Speech from the Chair, mentioned that, on a certain occasion, he
went with the QUEEN to inspect a School maintained by HER MAJESTY
in Windsor Park, when—
“In the girls' school there was an examination with respect to the mode of pre-
paring rice-pudding for dinner. The girls were examined as to the component parts
of a rice-pudding, and how they were put together. He owned that the subject
was quite new to him. (A laugh.) . He had no notion that it was so complete an
affair as it seemed to be. (Laughter.) But he could well understand that to have a
good rice-pudding instead of a bad one would be a great comfort to the husband and
father as well as to the wife and children.”
It is to be wished that every Establishment for Young Ladies would
take a leaf out of the book which, by the above showing, is especially
studied at HER MAJEsty's School in Windsor, Park—namely, the
Cookery Book. If, instead of .# only how to dress themselves
to the best advantage, girls of the middle and upper classes would turn
their attention to dressing food in the micest possible manner; if they
were less studious of dressing for dinner, and would rather devote
themselves to dressing, the dinner itself, they would afford much more
satisfaction than they do to their parents and friends, and would find
much less difficulty than what they now experience in getting husbands,
who would gladly encourage them in dressing according to their
station.

A HINT TO THE CLERGY.
CERTAIN Parsons have been making a complaint that they lose
Burial Fees by reason of the closing old churchyards and the openin
new cemeteries. Here is a hardship, no doubt, but we have not much
sympathy with those who are sending round the coffin-plate for a col-
lection. But, ever humane, Mr. Punch makes a suggestion to the un-
fortunate priests. Surely Marriage Fees are not only better things
but pleasanter things to take. Why do not the clergy try to extend
this source of income? Young men hesitate to marry because young
ladies—or, rather, young, ladies' friends—have extravagant notions.
Now the influence of the Parsons with the pooh-with the Crinolines,
is proverbial. Young and old women listen to the spiritual director.
Why do not the clergy make a grand push in favour of themselves and
of Matrimony? Let them go to work in earnest, seconded as they
will be by all the male laity, man milliners ...! Let them publicly
and privately preach to the girls and their mothers that we want Wives,
and not machines for making the fortunes of tradesmen. Let us hear of
courses of Sermons to the Nubile. Would a brave priest refuse to church
a huge Crinoline, a tremendous blow would be struck at extravagance
in dress—or suppose he sent away a couple of lavishly adorned God-
mothers, on the obvious ground that no two could be got into the same
christening pew. If the pet and other Parsons will only work out this
idea, Marriages will be multiplied, and they need sigh no longer for a
share of the spoil of the Ghoul, the greedy undertaker. Go in, not for
the Knell, beloved pastors, but for the Wedding Bells.
The Dear Creatures,
WHEN a certain Oriental potentate wants to ruin one of his principal
subjects, he makes him a present of a White Elephant, which the poor
man is obliged to keep, and by which, therefore, he is soon financially
eaten up. In this country, the fashionable Mamma, who contrives to
inveigle a soft young man into marriage with her expensive daughter,
saddles him with an incumbrance corresponding exactly to the White
Elephant, in very speedily reducing him to ruin, and, as it were, eating
him out of house and home.
PUNY WHIPSTERS THAT ARE AFRAID OF WOMEN 1
WE would rather not be at Birmingham at the present moment, for
it seems that the whip-makers are all busy striking there. The trade
is in arms against the introduction of women into it. We cannot
approve of this want of gallantry, which is decidedly opposed to the
manly sentiment (always good for three rounds of applause at the Qld
Coburg) about “Striking a lovely woman in distress.” Perhaps the
cowards are afraid that i. first use the women might turn their whips
to would be to lay them right well across their selfish backs; and the
cowards would deserve it, too, for thus meanly trying to get the whip-
hand of the weaker sex. The extreme sensibility of the fair partners
of our pains and puddings might probably revolt against lending them-
selves as willing instruments to the possible propagation of anything
like suffering on a single living creature; otherwise, we do not see why
women should not become as expert in the whip-making business as
men; and we all of us can bear witness to the success that, generally
attends their winning efforts, when the funds of an institution are
getting low, or a charity is inoperative for the want of larger means,
or any good cause, or suffering creature, needs sustenance with a little
money; for who let us ask, on such benevolent occasions, is so clever,
so happy, and so successful, as a woman in “making a whip?”

[July 13, 186].
THE GOOD SHIP EUROPEPS ROTTEN CABLE.
THE good ship Europe rides at anchor,
Shoals upon her lee;
Mainsail, º: jib, and spanker,
Close-reefed, as may be.
Heav'n knows, ’tis no time for running
Nº. ! * il
eeds both crew's and pilot’s cunning
Holding-ground to find ;
While the surf the ear is stunning,
And the shingles grind.
Closer still the shoals environ,
Watch on deck take heed'
Pay out cable, hemp and iron—
e'er was direr need
Revolution's rock to larboard,
Blood-red, waits its prey;
Despotism's cliffs, to starboard,
Iron walls display;
Rides the Britain, good ship, harboured,
Safe in Freedom's Bay !
“Tell us, Pilot, what’s the cable
Doth the ship retain?
Stout the stuff must be that’s able
To abide the strain!
While the breakers’ roar falls gruffl
Reef and shoal among?” y
Quoth the Pilot, with a shiver,
“Cables! Heaven forfend.
We should trust them, to deliver
Us from evil end.
On the best-bower, see the rotten
Cable chafe and fray,
From Saint Peter's bark, when gotten,
'Twas good stuff, they say—
As well trust a thread of cotton
As that rope to-day !
“Then Saint Peter's bark was tighter
Than our ship, I trow;.
By the stern she floated lighter,
Lighter by the bow. .
The Apostle he might rig her
Square or fore-and-aft; , , ,
But the good ship Europe's bigger,
Heavier of draught,
Tonnage of a different figure—
Quite another craft!
“Once the Saint to sea could venture
No more the cross-keys bedizen,
As of old, our flag; -
At the fore, and main, and mizen,
Blows another rag,
While Blue Peter we imprison
In the foul-clothes bag!
“Yet they call Saint Peter's rope here
Europe's stoutest stay!
If it be, Heaven help our hope here
In this rock-girt bay!
For I see its strands a-parting
Slowly one by one;
Everywhere its hemp is starting,
Rotted, rent, undone— -
For our trust in't we are smarting,
As ashore we run
“So much for the best bower tacklc,
Truth is good to know,
But let idlers skulk and cackle
In the hold below.
Gallant new tackle veer up
From the cable-tier
Liſt sad hearts-sai faces clear up
Strands, if hempen, twisted toughly–
inks, if iron, strong—
Groaning, grinding, chaſing roughly,
As we surge along,
With a priestly crew,
Now we cancel each indenture
Where a priest’s to do.
With a lusty cheer; -
Work, and hope the good ship Europs
Stil may stay and steer.”
A CLUB-MAN'S GRIEWANCE.
WE are requested to publish the following º which
has passed between a gentleman about town and the Right Hon. the
CIIANCELLOR OF THE Exciſ EQUER:—
I.
“Areopagus Club, July 6th, 1861.
“I am not a “determined antagonist’ of the Income-Tax, on
the contrary, I make it a business and a pleasure to get out of the way
of that imposition as much as I can. The only trouble I give the
officials charged with its collection is the putting their ridiculous
dºcuments through the slit in the door of my chambers in the Temple.
My respectable laundress is charged with the duty of taking care that
my mind is not diverted from my legal and other studies By any irrl-
tation that might be caused by the perusal of those objectionable
rescripts.
“But it has occurred to me, and as I regard the subject from a
position of impartiality, my suggestion may have a value which the
reclamations of partisans may lack, that to those who can make up
their minds to pay a tax of questionable morality, a certain amount of
relief may properly be extended, and I beg to call your attention to
the \". in question.
“I belong to. Five Clubs, the Areopagus (from which I have the
honour of, writing), the Wombat, the Affable Swells', the Junior
United Poker, and the Pachydermatous. The subscription to these
Clubs, which inted hardly say are Necessaries of Life, amounts to
about £50 per annum. And at each Club, during the Racing Season,
there is, a series of Sweepstakes, to which it is not imperative, but
highly clubbable to subscribe. Placing this outlay at the most mode:
rate figure, I reckon it at £25, for I do not think a club-man justified
in taking more than one chance in each sweepstake.
“You permit the deduction of Life Assurance Premiums, whatever
they may be, and of sundry other, payments, from the amount of
Income to be returned to your. Commissioners. I submit that a
Member of London Clubs should, in fairness, be allowed to deduct his
º and his Sweepstakes, which are, as you will admit,
necessary to his London existence.
. “For, the reasons which, I stated at the outset, the question is
divested, for myself, of all but public interest, and I write in the
purest spirit of patriotism.
“I have the honour to be, Sir,
“Your very obedient Servant,

“SIR, - “The Erchequer, July 6th.
“I am favoured with your letter of to-day.
. “The Collector for your district has by this time received explicit
instructions to take steps calculated to relieve you from the unenviable
position of a defaulting debtor to the Crown of these kingdoms,
and to protect you from again finding yourself in so undesirable a
condition. -
“I should not be justified in enteri -
thetical character, but as the Income-Tax will in future have a lively
and personal interest for yourself, I beg to say that you will find your
Five of Clubs trumped by the Queen, and that the supposed necessity
of drawing a horse for the Derby must not be taken into consideration
in presence of the real necessity of drawing a cheque for MR. TIMMs.
That no appreciable hardship is inflicted upon you is more evident
to me than it may be to yourself, but I must leave you to discuss that
point with Somerset House. I would only suggest that the withdrawal
of your name from one of the clubs you mention would not only enable
you to meet the demands of the State, but would leave you a surplus
for the purposes of charity. But I am not to be understood as recom:
mending your delaying arrangement with MR. TIMMs until you shall
have convinced yourself of the soundness of my views, as I have reason
to think that an official document which will be placed in your hands
within a few hours will intimate to ". on HER MAJESTY's part, that
the exigencies of administration will not permit any protracted interval
for your examination of the question.

Advice to Opera-Goers.
NEveR volunteer to take any lady to a performance which you are
particularly desirous of hearing, for fear she should be taken ill soon
after it has begun, and want to go home. The observance of this rule
will by no means be necessarily mere selfishness. , If you wish to be
kind to her, and treat her to an opera, do so, only wait till you are
asked. Then you will find that she will not fall ill at the theatre, or if
she does, so much the better, as far as your entertainment is concerned;
for you will have taken her to hear music which you don't care about,
and from which you will be glad to get away.

defended the late SIR CHARLEs
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 8, Monday, We must indeed be near the end of the Session,
for the flords had so little to occu y them that they endured a dis-
cussion on the Education of the People, and a very good debate it was,
“inaugurated” (as the ſº...". . of the opening of a new
ublic-house) by a well-prepared speech from LöRD LYTTELTON.
oRDs GRANVILLE and #. also spoke, and the DUKE OF
NEwcasTLE made a spirited defence of the excellent and elaborate
report of the Education Commissioners, and observed, for the benefit
of the Bishop-Maker, that although the Commissioners had not
indulged in glºwing phrases about religion, they had º;
the fact that the nation *: the value of other teaching besides
that which is merely secular. The Bishop-Maker made no reply, but
doubtless “thought the more.”
Iłownstairs, LoRD Eigho showed that he was not so much occupied i.
with the Wimbledon Rifle Meeting, at which Mr. Punch saw him in
the excess of glory (and by the way, hurra, Jopling ! hurra, Champion
Shot of England!-your health, our son!), as to be unmindful of other
elevations than those of Rifles. He assailed the designs, for the
new Foreign, Office, and contended that what is called Palladian
—because, like failas, it has, in this case, sprung from the brain
of Jupiter-PAM—is not so much to be ‘admired as "Gothic.
CowPER-his Winter Walk at Noon is an excellent thing, not so hſs
Summer Ride in Kensington Gardens—took the other side, of course,
as might be expected from Jupiter's step-son, and declared that the
style which, under Jupiter's decree, MR. GILBERT Scott had been
obliged to adopt, was truly National. Perhaps he meant that it was
like that of the National Gallery, which was not the very highest
praise that could have been awarded. ..MR. LAYARD, by way of show-
ing that his friends’.“advanced intellects” of Southwark have not
destroyed his admiration for * , made a fight for Gothic, and
asserted that of all styles it was the best calculated for the admission
of light. One MILTON has described it somewhat differently, but it is
perfectly true that domestic and ecclesiastical Gothic are as different
things as claret and port. MR. TITE, as one whose fame chiefly rests
on Italian architecture, spoke up for that style, but he gracefully

Houses; and it was pleasant to hear one veteran architect championing
the ſame of another. LQRD JoHN MANNERs described MR. Scott as
the First of the Goths, and complained that he should have been driven
into a style not his own, and MR. OsnoRNE civilly intimated to the
House that it would do well to distrust itself, for that it had shown its
; º: of blundering over architectural matters; and then
upiter-PAM made a very long speech, much º than he usually
bestows on a foreign nation, or an such trific. He declared his undy-
ing and unalterable attachment for Italian architecture, and patted
himself, on the head for having sent away MR. Scott's Gothic designs
twice, desiring him to do something Italian, which indeed Jupiter was
good enough to consider had been º done.
on the Gothic question, for the expense o
monstratious, and the old g - - -
another and the palace-maids’ dust-pans in the “dem’d religious
light” of SIR CHARLEs’s passages. These considerations, and Jupiter-
RAM's nod, floored LQRD ELcho and his Goths by 188 to 98; and our
Foreign Affairs will be transacted under an Italian roof, which the
; º ITALY may, if he likes, accept as a delicate compliment from
ngland.
After Estimates there was another little battle on the Seats Bill, and
as the Government had favoured the selection of Pontefract for a
polling-place, the House followed up its policy of opposing everything
the Government do on this question, and by 107 to 94 declared that
Pontefract should not be the place, but that. Wakefield should—
a curious coincidence being that Wakefield is just now hung up in
terrorem, for the most owdacious corruption.
Tuesday. The Lords discussed the East India Council Bill. LoRD
ELLENBoRough thought that it was far too large a measure, and LoRD
LyvedEN (VERNoN SMIDJTH) wished that SIR. C. WooD had drawn it
a little milder. On the other hand, LoRD DERby thought that a little
Parliament was not the thing to govern a yast empire like India. But
the question is virtually left to the Westminster Hotel Company
(limited), or at least to the great guest who has mopped up so many of
the best rooms in the metropolitan improvement.
Downstairs, MR. BAILLIE CochRANE had a grievance on behalf of
some Reserved Captains, but it did not interest the House enough to
induce a yote that should transfer their reserve into joviality, and by
60 to 33 Cocky was sat upon. Then more Civil Estimates.

“I should oppose new After some thing for salmon.
- - #. legislation on such a matter.”, A
more anti-Sabbatarian debate, SIR FRANCIs in a huff, and with a good
scold at Ministers for alleged inconsistency, withdrew his Bill. The
House then proceeded to the º: religious duties of the day. MR.
HUBBARD urged the necessity of a rational settlement of the Church
Rate question, and j own Bill as one means to that desirable
end..., SIR John TRELAwNEY was a little high, but civil, and called on
the Conservatives to make up their minds on the subject against next
Session. , That eminent Nonconformist, MR., ToM DUNcoMBE, was
warm in his protests against a rate that troubled his conscience, and
SIR John PAKINGTON's trumpet sounded answer to SIR John TRE-
LAwNEY, and the former Baronet informed the latter that the anti-
church rate folk had been smashed ever since they had declared that
they desired to bring down not only rate but church, and that this
would continue to be their fate, unless they respected the love of the
eople for the church of their fathers. Later in the van, MR. CRoss's
Bill was also withdrawn, and now the Churchmen and Dissenters had
better take off their coats, and think as hard as they can how to settle
a question which involves very little money and very much irritation.
Thursday. . NoFMANBY duly snubbed, as usual—something about
Whitby, which place it seems the inhabitants wish to convert into a
fashionable watering-place. Mr. Punch has lately had the privilege of
re a good deal of the written minstrelsy of that, neighbourhood
and of the nautical interest of the coast, and as it nearly all consists of
desperate abuse, in patois, he suggests that the Whitby Warbler will
require re-editing before civilisation can make much progress...The
collier-bards are very outspoken, but “there is a form in these º

LoRD GRANVILLE promised that the
Emulous of the Lords, the Commons got upon Education, discussed
Friday. LoRD STRATFoRD is very anxious that, we should begin to
advise the new Sultan; but the Government, think that, like the man
in Measure for Measure, he should be permitted to cºntinue in his evil
courses until we know what they are. A Bill for enabling landlords to
borrow money to improve labourers’ cottages did not please their Lord-
ships, and it was rejected by 16 to 13. A similar fate attended the
Book Unions Bill, which º: to permit the lottery principle
recognised in Art Únions to be acted upon by book associations. But
LoRD GREY was so ully afraid that this permission would encou-
rage gambling, that he º: the measure, as LoRD GRANVILLE.
§ cannot understand why people should be allowed to subscribe to a
lottery that can give them only a high-class picture or beautiful
statuette, and yet not be permitted to #. the nobler ambition of
obtaining a volume of Punch. But the Lords know best, of course.
MR. SLANEY wishes that the public should be allowed to walk on the
terrace in the river front of Somerset House; but, MR. CowPER,
though very anxious to make walks (and rides), is afraid that the youn
ladies will disturb the clerks, and make them, put up ha'porths o
audits and other sweetmeats instead of , penn'orths... LoRD. John
Russell said that we had reason to complain of the Belgians for not
carrying out the new º: and he complained accordingly. Some
claims, arising out of a little difficulty we had with Denmark in 1807,
were brought up by MR. MACAULAy, whose name excuses his plunging
into history for a grievance; but really the line must be drawn somewhere,
or Mr. Punch will be justified in bringing forward a claim for compen-
sation for a serious wrong that was done to one of his ancestors at the
time of the passing the Heptarchy-Amalgamation Act. ATHERTON,
the new A.G., had the opportunity of making his first speech in that
capacity, and of overthrowing MACAULAY.
Then came the Third Reading of the Bill for enabling votes to be
sent, when the Universities elect, Out, came Peelides, with strong
opposition to it. ... Now, it would be unkind to say that Petides, who
is about to leave Oxford for a northern constituency, is ºfg with the
University for not painting the Radcliffe and the steeple of St. Mary's
black, in honour of his departure; but, it would have been prettier in
him to say something elegant and touching in favour of constituencies
like his own....However, he did no harm, for the House had intended
to pass the Bill, and this intention was confirmed by LoRP PALMER-
ston also speaking against it. The Government opposed the mea-
sure, and the House of course carried the Third by 165 to 80–
majority against Ministers, 85: a pleasant finish-up of the week's work,

Who could not guess what member of the House of
Commons it was that made, in the discussion on the plan
of the Foreign Office, the speech wherefrom the following
assertion is extracted?—
“He undertook to say that for one person who took delight in a
Gothic .# there were twenty who derived greater pleasure from
an Italian building; and he referred to the example of Paris to show
º: *timation in which the Italian style was held in the present
y."
Of course everybody, if asked which of our legislators
it was who exposed his ideas of architectural taste in the
above declaration, would name MR. CowPER. In a matter
of Art, according to our Chief Commissioner of Works and
Public Buildings, the criterion of excellence is the opinion
of the multitude. An Italian building is finer than a
Gothic, because, for one who takes delight in the latter,
there are twenty who derive greater pleasure from the
former. By parity of reasoning, the minstrelsy of CHRISTy's
minstrels might be preferred to TENNyson's poems, married
to the music of BEETHov EN. M.R. CowPER's argument is
that of a man naturally devoid of any sense of beauty, and
who is therefore capable of spoiling that of Kensington
Gardens by defacing them with a hippodrome. For one
person who delights in a landscape, there are very likely
twenty who had rather look at a horse, particularly with a
pretty horsebreaker on the back of it.
..The same majority of twenty to one would, no doubt,
like to see a gratuitous circus established in Kensing:
ton Gardens, or the Garden of Eden, itself. That j
be what M. WALEwski calls a, “miracle of a dileship”
worthy of our British Ædile; who is hereby requested to

REPRESENTATIVE RASCALS.
Asually, on Thursday, las
week, in the Laboratory of
the Court of Probate, in the
crucible of the witness-box,
and under exposure to the
fire of cross-examination, some
particles of new and important
truth were elicited, by that
expert chemist the Queen's
*i. from a body deno-
minating itself DR., David
GRIFFITH Jon Es—a vile body,
and thus a proper one for the
subject of experiment, which,
however, has yielded instruc-
tive results.
From DR. David GRIFFITH
Jones, who claimed
legatee under a will which a
lady, apparently out of her
mind, had made in his favour,
were extracted the following
confessions:–He had prac-
tised Homoeopathy and Hy-
#º for about mine years,
He had, however, commenced
the medical profession as an
the old system of medical
treatment, inclusive of “bleed;
ºf. It may be questioned
- - - whether he ever abandoned
the º system. He was the proprietor of a medicine not named in the Pharmacopoeia,
but called, by a Dutchman from whom he had purchased it, Axtramankaz. What was the
derivation of this word he could nºt say,; may we be excused for suggesting that it is evidently
Double Dutch? He had obtained his diploma at the Marischal College, Aberdeen.
Thus far Dr. David Garrºrs Joses had merely confessed imself to be aquack doctor.
The admissions, however, subsequently obtained from him showed that he was something even
below that. , DR, DAVID GRIFFITH Jones proceeded to depose that, to obtain his Aberdeen
diplºma, he had travelled all night from London, and reached Aberdeen in the morning. He
would swear that, but could not state the distance. It is, of course, obvious that if fe had
known the space intervening between London and Aberdeen, he would have taken no such
#º oath. He arrived at Aberdeen at break of day, and stopped at the Railway Hotel.
ere Dr. David GRIFFITH Jones “became exceedingly pale and confused’—the suspicion
dawning on his mind that he had been gently trotted into deposing to a tissue of impossibilities.
Inshort, after º he was examined at Aberdeenvirá race and by paper, and sweari
to a few more lies, which it is needless to detail, he was obliged to acknowledge that he ha
never been to Aberdeen at all; that at the time when he swore he was there he was really at
Chipping-Norton; and that the signature, D. G. Jones, appended to his Marischal College
medical papers, relating to the examination which he pretended to have passed there, was not
his own, but “might be.” in the handwriting of a certain DR.REEves; that he and this
REEves were in the habit of passing at various colleges for other persons, and that the
occasionally º each other. Of course, this last statement was partly false, inasmug
as it is obviously impossible that DR.DAVID GRIFFITH Jones could have personated anybody
capable of sustaining a medical examination; but there can be no doubt that he himself was
personated at Aberdeen by the other fellow, and that this cleverer rogue of the two is accus-
tomed to personate and ..". diplomas for other scoundrels, who, being quacks, intend to
pass themselves off for medical men. -
DR-DAVID GRIFFITH Jones, as he calls himself, of course lost his cause, and was condemned
in the costs of the suit, but, unaccountably, was not ordered into custody, to be indicted for
perjury. His accomplice, styled DR, REEVEs, whatever may be the real name of that knave,
is also still at large. is t ere no law under which he is punishable for the mischievous
frauds which he appears to subsist by practising?
Be it observed, that the pºssession of a doctor's diploma by an obscene advertising quack is
no proof that he has acquired it otherwise, than by an arrangement made with a greater, but
less ignorant, rascal, than himself. The lying puffer of º specific, though holding
the credentials of a physician, has very likely obtained them by fraudulent proxy, and is simply
just such another impostor as the perjured proprietor of Axtramankaz.
A SAD WORLD, MY MASTERS!

with a pair of creaking boots, one is prone at any risk to wish he were
off duty, or at all events that he had got his boots off.
“However lazy and luxurious their life may be ashore, there is no

THE RIFLE RACES.
. HAVING, from the enormous weekly increase to his wealth, a con:
siderable interest in the welfare of the kingdom and in the condition of
our national defences, Mr. Punch of course paid a visit to Wimbledon
last week, for the purpose of examining th. progress made in rifle
shooting. The truth that practice makes, perfect is nowhere more
evinced than in a course of rifle practice, and Mr. Punch confesses that
he felt no small surprise at the improvement, in the shooting since, he
last year inspected it. Taking his stand beside the screen where last
year's Champion Shot was shooting, Mr. Punch was pleased to see him
score two “centres,” in succession at a 900 }. range; and, as a man
§ was still more charmed to see, that even such ood shootin
failed after all to win him the first place. Splendid as the practice o
the Man (of) Ross may be, England doubt º ere long will count
among her marksmen some thousands good as he is; indeed, if rifle
shooting continue to improve at such a rate as it has done, we may
expect men to score," centres” in continuous succession for an hour at
a time, just as certainly as “sixes” are thrown in Boz and Cor.
As he listened to the singing of the bullets through the air, Mr.
Punch could not help hoping that such war-songs would in England be
heard only in peace; and as he saw how surely the blue flag or the
white (each denoting a fair hit) was waved after each song, he º
invaders would do wisely to keep well out of º unless they wished
to get an ounce or two of lead put in their ears. If any one had told
him when he issued his first volume twenty years ago, that long before
his fortieth was laid before the Universe he would see a bullseye hit
with tolerable certainty at more than half a mile, Mr. Punch would have
put very little faith in the prediction. But thanks to MINIÉ, ENFIELD,
WHITwoRTH, HENRY, and some others, the feat is easily accomplish
able if men will only practise it, and every one who, loves his countr
of course will. There is no doubt, had the ancient Britons owned such
weapons, a black ". in our history would never have been written
for the invasion of England would not have taken place. CAESAR an
his legions would have *:::: been potted half a mile from shore, and
even the very longest of their Roman noses would have never cast its
shadow on the British sand.
Having just glanced round the tent where the prizes were exhibited
(he did not dare to look long at them for fear he might be tempted to
#. one or two of them, which there were too many policemen
ooking amiably on to make it safe for him to do), Mr. Punch spent
half an hour in smoking a cigar and seeing the “Rifle Derby:” which,
but for the two trifling facts that there were no horses and (so to
speak) no people, might somewhat have reminded him of the race
whence it was named. But of all the rifle races, that in which he took
chief interest was the one where Rugby distanced the other public
schools, and which, from the creditable practice that was shown, proved
that proper steps were taken to make our future statesmen as familiar
with Enfield's rifle as they are with ENFIELD's Speaker, and to teach
their young idea how properly to shoot.
Quite disregarding dinner, in his military enthusiasm, Mr. Panch
stayed on the ground until the ties were all shot off (by the way, why
don't the drapers bring out a Rifle Tie?), and then returned to town
feeling very º and º in his mind at having seen so good an
exhibition for his shilling, and more than ever satisfied that as both a
fundholder and father of a family, he was well protected by our national
defenders, and #. proceed to lay his head upon his pillow without

ExERCISE BEFORE DINNER.
(To MR. ALDERMAN GUTCH.)
MY DEAR ALDERMAN,
2^ LET me... commend to
your attention the follow-
ing passage, extracted from
anewspaper report relative
to the Crystal Palace:-
“The grounds of the Crystal
Palace are now very beautiful;
the roses and flower-beds are
in a state of perfection. Inside
the building fresh novelties
have been provided in the shape
of a number of live turtles,
which are allowed to sport in
the southern basin.”
When you are going to
dine with the Lord Mayor,
or to partake of a banquet
in the hall of one of your
great Companies, let me
recommend you to take a
holiday in the morning
and spendit at the Črystal
Y Palace. You will find that
amuch betterway to create
an appetite than taking a
dinner-pill. Theinspection
of works of art and objects
of matural history, con-
tinued for a few hours, is
a sort of exercise that gene-
rally makes ºl. hungry,
even if the zoo º spe-
cimens are stuffed, and not
calculated for stuffing the
beholder. But the sight
of live turtle sporting in a
basin, which is one that can be seen by no person endowed with the least ima-
gination without suggesting the idea of lumps of green, fat floating in a turºn,
cannot, fail of rendering the most dyspeptic of citizens absolutely ravenous. The
Crystal Palace was meant for the cultivation of people's taste: avail yourself of
the advantages which it offers in that respect; go, contemplate the live turtle
sporting in their basin; feast your eyes upon them there and then, and your mind,
in anticipation, on the calipash and calipee, in the enjoyment whereof you are des:
timed to revel in a few hours. “Abroad in the meadows to see the young lambs,”
must always, conjure up visions of delight enhanced by mint-sauce; but what are
they to the delicious prospects, in connection with a squeeze of lemon, which will
be presented to your Worship's fancy by the gambols of live turtle? Ah! May
digestion wait on appetite! Am I not, indeed, your Worship's
Sweet Remembrancer, 49'ſſº.
The Clarendon, July, 1861.
THE SAVING OF INDIA.
By a letter in a Times City article, and which was there acknowledged as received
from, “an º Calcutta merchant,” grumblers at the Government were
delighted with the following:—
“We have nothing new in the financial way lately, except a report to Government by the ‘Civil
Finance Commission" as to the working of the Government Stationery Office. They suggest such
alterations as will, they say, cause a saving of some £30,000 a year, and the Government has
ordered all their recommendations to be carried out. ‘If these things are done in the green
tree, what shall be done in the dry?" If £30,000 a year can be saved in stationery, what can be
saved by a proper economy in the whole administration of India? The report is a perfect curiosity,
and I feel tempted to send it to Punch. The whole matter would be laughable were it not too
serious to see how money has been wasted.”
Thirty Thousand Pounds a-year seems a good round sum to save by squaring the
accounts of a Stationery Office, and the consumption of pens, ink, and paper must
be quite prodigious when such a sum as this can be annually saved in it. Govern-
ment clerks in England have, rather a bad name for wasting ſº time for
which, the public has to pay them; but their fellow-clerks in India must waste
something else than time, if the statement we have quoted be found to be vera-
cious... It is a usual thing in England for Government to use a sheet of foolscap
when it wants to write a note of half-a-dozen words; but in India one would fancy
it must have been the custom to consume at least a quire of the most expensive
letter-paper in making out rough drafts of every communication, and one would
think that the fair copy was written upon yellum made from skin as precious as
that which is ". to have borne the Golden Fleece. Even this, indeed, would
scarce account for such a waste as Thirty Thousand Pounds a year; and one might
really imagine that the Government clerks in India wrote with nothing but gold
pens, and used a new one for each note. If one added that most probably their
penholders were made of the finest mother-of-pearl, and inlaid with rubies,
emeralds, and diamonds, the conjecture would still fail to
account for the enormous expenditure in stationery, which
a saving of some Thirty Thousand Pounds a-year implies;
and one would also have to fancy their inkstands gemmed
with sapphires and their blotting-pads composed of £100
bank-notes, which they were welcome to tear out and
put into their pockets, as trifles forming part of the per-
quisites of the place. -
A good deal has been said about the saying of India in
the time of the Revolt; but the saving which is spoken of
as being now in prospect appears to us but little, if at all,
less wonderful. Very certainly the Sepoys have not been
the only or the most insidious enemies with whom the
Indian revenue has been recently attacked. The employés
who have wasted Thirty Thousand Pounds a-year must
fairly be regarded as foes to her prosperity; and we can-
not wonder that her fortunes should stand still while
such a drain upon her coffers continues to be stationery.
SENSE v. SENSATION.
SoME would have it an age of Sensation,
If the Age one of Sense may not be-
The word’s not Old England's creation,
But New England's, over the sea,
Where all's in the high-pressure way,
In life just as in locomotion,
And where, though you’re here for to-day, ..
Where to-morrow you’ll be, you’ve no notion.
In that land of fast life and fast laws—
Laws not faster made than they're broken-
Sensation’s the spirit that draws
To a head, whate'er’s written or spoken.
If a steamer blow up on the lakes, -
Or a statesman prove false to the nation,
Its impression the circumstance makes
In a paragraph headed “Sensation.”
If a senator gouges a friend
In the course of a lively debate;
Ori. º º to º en

If º º: #º. DoDGE takes the stump,
Or the President makes an oration,
The event able Editors lump -
Under one standing head of “Sensation.”
The last horrid murder down South,
The last monster mile-panorama;
Last new sermon, or wash for the mouth,
New acrobat, planet or drama:
All-allis Sensation—so fast, .
Piled º by this go-a-head nation,
That by dint of Sensation at last, ...
There’s nothing excites a “Sensation.”
And now that across the Atlantic
Worm threadbare “Sensation” we’ve seen,
And the people that lately were frantic,
Blush to think that such madmen they’ve been;

On the part of this common sense nation,
Every here and there, on the rise,
This poisºnous exotic “Sensation.”
When an acrobat ventures his neck,
In the feats of the flying º
Or some nigger minstrel woul deck
His wool-wig with extra green bays;
If a drama can boast of a run,
By dint of a strong situation,
The posters e'en now have begun.
To puff the thing up as “Sensation.”
Mr. Punch 'gainst the word and the things
It applies to, his protest wºuld enter:
For the vulgar excitement it brings
May England ne'er prove fitting centre. . .
If you’ve got something good, never doubt it
}. deeds will avouch its vocation;
And be sure that not talking about it
Is the true way to make a “Sensation.”

MRS. ROCHEFOUCAULD'S MAXIMS.
MRs. Roch EFoucAULD would like to know why her
maxims should not be read, as well as those of her old
|lºrd and master. All women are not weak-minded; quite
the reverse.
MRs. R. is quite convinced that the gallantry of Mr.
Punch will induce him to do her justice, by opening his
brilliant columns to a few of her good things.
The following are by no means her best:—
We can all bear, with resignation, a rent in the dress
of our very dearest ſriend.
We should, indeed, be often ashamed of the noble de-
votion and self-sacrifice with which we give ourselves away,
were it always possible for the happy man to know why we
pass into the temple of Hymen.
We are really not answerable for our defects, and they
are to be pardoned; but when we see a friend endea-
vouring, by base arts, to hide the maladresses of nature,
we are justified in proclaiming the attempted deceit to
the world.
We are jealous of men whom we love; and of women
whom we hate.
Bracelets and ear-rings are to women what stars and
garters are to men. Women are vain of their persons;
men of their actions. Yet the men cry “Poor weak
woman l’’
It is difficult to announce the birth of love to another;
but how much more difficult to declare that he is dead!
It requires the most consummate tact to hate politely.
Our laziness, often keeps us in the º of duty where
our parents dropped us. But, if the world will cry
“Bravo!”—why should ºre say “Hush!”
Generally, when we praise anybody, if we search our
motives, we shall find that we are returning them only a
very small percentage of the admiration they have expressed
for ourselves. If a friend praises our dress and carriage,
we handsemely find that her gloves are not quite so ill-
fitting as they usually are.
Better be despised than ridiculed. Very great criminals
have had exquisite taste in dress.

means of recrea-
tion in their well-
earned leisure time.

Impression was
that they’d been
taking up a music
shop, or capturing

had broken into one, and walked off with the stock. But when the
truth became apparent, we thought how good a thing it was that the
Police should live in harmony, and we reflected that their instruments
would be greatly instrumental towards the keeping of the peace. A
trombone in the hands, of a Policeman six feet high would be a
formidable weapon in the case of a street row, and a blow from, an
ophicleide, if wielded as a weapon, would be even more effective than
a trenchant truncheon-cut. There is no doubt that a mob would soon
be awed into dispersion if they saw a band of “Bobbies” marching
down upon them with such arms in their hands, and playing the
“Rogue's March,” or “See we Conquering Heroes come /*

loº
Nor will this be the sole benefit likely to result when our Policemen
as a rule have music in their souls, and by*. frequent practice have
perfected their taste in it. A love of good music of course will inspire
in due proportion a hatred of the hand-organs, gorilla German bands, and
lamp-blacked Nigger minstrels, who are now so constantly the breakers
of our - §. harpers from Whitechapel, and Scotch º
from Shoreditch, will be taken. * at once as musical impostors when
musical detectives are enrolled in the Police; and as for all the squeakers
with the º and squealers with the fife, they will instantly be
handcuffed for the uttering of false notes. The same stern justice will
be dealt to Paganinis of the pavement, who, if they persist in playing
will soon get into a scrape, and will find their, solo stopped by a rapid
pedal movement on the part of the Police; whilst their performance on
one string will get them into a line which ends at the Station House.
We can imagine a street organ-grinder flying, terror-stricken, before
a tall Policeman with a trombone at his * from which a blast of
yengeance might fittingly be blown; while the Waits, who make might
hideous with their fiddlings and their flutings, would at once be appre-
hended for the murder of our sleep. A Policeman who has gotten a
ood ear and taste for music, of course will have small mercy on all the
jad band-itti by whom the so-called “quiet streets” are now especiall
infested, and who levy a black-mail on all who are in hearing, and ro
them of their money, or else rob them of their rest.
Clear as Mud.
The ABB% CRUICE has lately beenJ. to the See of Marseilles.
This ecclesiastic, according to the Courrier de Marseille, “is of Irish
descent, and the author of several esteemed works, remarkable for the
qualities of their style and the clearness of their ideas.” The clearness
of the ideas contained in the works of Bishop CRUICE is perhaps the
strongest possible evidence, next to an authenticated gree, of his
Irish descent.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“ALTHOUGH my correspondence is professedly dramatic, I
cannot pass unnoticed the fact that GIULIA GRisi, the $.” of Lyric
Song, is at length about to abdicate the throne she ſong has filled.
Her eight last final farewell performances are over, and her admirers
have but one more chance of paying her their court. Wednesday the
24th (the day when these lines are made public) is fixed for her retiring,
and they who have not taken seats before they see this notice will have
faint chance ºf getting them. A bumper at parting one can’t doubt
that there will be, for it is something to remember to have seen the last
of GRISI.
“Quando ullam invenies parem?"
When are we to hope to look upon her like? Where else can we hear
that pure and, classic style of yocal declamation, or see sweeping o'er
tle stage that stately queen-like step? When again shalſ we see
Wormq, as Narma should be seen, or again so deeply sympathise with
Palentine and Desdemona & This I could not well help thinking when
Fº my last look at her as Donna Anna, wherein she sang and acted
I not say as finely as she had ever done, but more finely than I
know of any other who can do. No, I’m not forgetting TiETJENs.
She is #. singer, and still flºº. as an actress; but in neither,
to mythinking, is she yet so grand as GRIsI.
Au reste, Don Giovanni was capitally cast, and indeed the whole
performance was worthy of the leave taking. To say that Costa was
conductor is to say that band and chorus were all that could be wished
and that the accompaniments (were there ever such accompaniments ;
were played as MozART would have loved to hear them. e have seen
a better Don, we who remember TAMBURIN1; but can any one imagine
a more excellent Masettof RoNCONI's rustic clumsiness all our stage
bumpkins shºuld see, and lay to heart a lesson from his admirable bye-
lay. They may learn how to be humorous without making themselves
udicrous, and how to keep their drollery from overstepping nature.
“What do I think of PATTI now, I’ve seen her as Zerlina?, Well,
I frankly own she charmed me more than I expected. Girlish, fresh
and graceful in both her voice and bearing, she sang and acted with
good taste, and neither overdid her part nor played tricks with the
music. There was no smack of the ‘infantine phenomenon’ per
ceivable, and (is it that MozART is more inspiring than. BELLINI*):
there seemed more impulse and more spirit in her playing, and her
singing than when I saw her in Sannambula, I thought she could
exhibit. How her talents may develope I shall not E. to pro-
hesy, but I fancy her Zerlina will afford me greater }. easure than her
unatic Lucia or her ...}}. Traviata; and I hope, now I have
heard her sing such music as MozART's, that she will not, run the risk
of spoiling her good taste by singing too much in the sickly sentimental
VERDI school, which brings improvement neither to the singer nor
the listener.
“With the exception of a comedy translated for the Haymarket by
the veteran MR. PLANCHE, and a skit at the Adelphi on the question
of Belgravian Mammas v. Pretty Horsebreakers, there are no atic
novelties to bring before your notice: and my comments on these, two
I shall defer until I’ve seen them—I wonder, do the critics adhere
always to this rule? At the latter house the Dead Heart has once
more been brought to life, as the Colleen Baton has been withdrawn for
a few weeks. The withdrawal took place not because the piece, had
ceased to draw, but because poor Miles-na-Coppaleen required a little
breathing time after his tremendous headers in the lake, of which ter.

to mythinking the piece is somewhat cleverly constructed, (especially the Cave
Scene,) it contains but little that can raise it above ordinary melodramas. But
playgoers in general are a rather, sheep-like race, and blindly follow one another
wherever fashion leads them. Very certainly, however, I rejoice, at such success
on. Manager's account, for he well deserves whatever solid proof of popu-
larity he gets, for no man in his position has ever tried, more earnestly, to, please
the fickie"public. I feel inclined to clap my hands too on the authºr's own
account, for I am told that he participates fairly in the profits; and this !.
ciple is one I think of benefit to the drama, for when, a writer has directly ºn
interest in the long-continued running of a piece, he will surely spare no pains to
do his utmost towards ensuring it.

to replace the money value of her loss. August the third is the day fixed for Pºw
Woffington's benefit.”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 15, Monday. English residents in India made, through LoRD ELLEN-
Borough, the not unreasºnable request that when they have to be tried they may
be tried before English judges and juries. Every man except, one man must desire
to be judged by his peers, the exception being, of course, the architect who has
built a bad bridge... Loºp. TALBof DE MALAHIDE adverted to the subject of
Treasure. Trove-or hidden (not to say, absurdly, Malahidden) treasure, Finders
of curiosities have an unfortunate habit of thinking them their own, and of actin
upon that conviction; and if the Crown would offer, rewards for the surrenderº
such matters valuable archaeological relics, his º thought, would be saved
from the melting. ot. The difficulty is, that Lords o Manors and others have
rights which the Crown might injure. But with all conceivable respect for vested
rights, Mr. Punch conceives that John Tomkins, Esq., 1861, has not much real
claim to coins buried by Johannes De Tomkyns, 1352, and that the land which
has been taking the trouble to keep them, in her faithful bosom all the inter-
mediate time, has a sort of right to put them in her cabinet in Great Russell
Street. Ioni, CLANRicº RPE obtained an address for inquiring into the state of the
Commonlaw Courtsin Ireland, where, this noble Irishman reports, there are a great
#. more judges than are wanted, and that the whole lot do less work than two
English judges. Now this is no allegation by a cruel and brutal Saxon who longs
to tear away the consecrated ermine from the shoulders of
the Hibernian Themis, but the statement of ULick De
BURGH, descendant of the Great Lord of Connaught in
1227. Loºp STRATHEPEN urged the appointment of a
British Beak at Mozambique, in order to help the Portu-
guese to put down the slave-trade, but Lord GRANVIII:
preferred to wait until DR LIVINGstone should have had
time to carry out his operations. And a Committee was
* to consider the case of the TURNER and WERNoN
pl -
Tom DyNcombe wished, to know whether the American
Secessionists are to be allowed to tar and feather British
subjects. LoRD John Russell-but, under the circum-
stances, he must have a new paragraph- -
EARLLuptow, or EARL Russell, aut quocºnque, replied
that he had heard of only one case of the kind, and in
that case a Britisher was about served right for wearing
partizan colours—yes, Sir. - -
Six Irishmen tried to prevent the House from going into
Supply, by raising along debate on Irish Education. The
answer to all objections to the present systemis, that we are
teaching 800, little, Irish folk, and as the new Census
shows that there are but 5,764,543 people in Ireland, the
r-centage is º satisfactory. The 6 were
efeated § 36, and the English tyrants voted £285,377
for Irish Education. Into the Offences against the Person
Bill MR HENLEY discovered that the Attorney-GENERAL
had introduced a clause which would place any unfortunate
refugee at the mercy of the Police, and would do, in fact,
what the House so. jº. refused to do, some time
ago, to please our friend the Fisher for Frogs, MR. Wal-
foLE supported MR HENLEY in denouncing this clause,
and after a little battle, the Government of course, gave
way. It is thought that the great guns of the Administra-
tion had not been aware of the nature of the clause, for they
made only Fort Sumter firing, with sawdust in their shells,
and surrendered as quickly as they could. ATHERTON
must not do this sort of thing without leave, or we shall be
obliged to put the naughty boy in the Judge's corner at
Once.
Tuesday. Lords-India. - -
In the Commons, after a preliminary squabble on, the
Irwin business, hereafter mentioned, and a refusal by
Government, to appoint a Consul at Pesth, the only
interesting business of this night was the discussion
on the vote of £12,000 for the National Gallery. Loºp
HENRY LENNox was yº. urgent upon Government not
to incur any expenses, for new galleries. LoRº PAL-
MERston praised the plan of CAPTAIN Fowke, for im-
proving the Trafalgar Square building, but thought that
what had been dome there had been well done, which
indeed it ought to have been, for the job has cost £15,000.
He said that the Academy was quite ready to move out
when requested to do so. MR. LAYARD dwelt upon our
pictorial wealth, and our inability to exhibit it, and poor
old MR. Spoon ER complained that in the National Portrait
Gallery there was a likeness of NELLGwyn NE. Mr. Punch
only doubts whether the foundress of Chelsea, who has
surely been harmless long enough to permitus to remember
only her good points, ought not to have a statue by the
Thames. Divers strong hints were given that the sooner
the Academy cleared out of Trafalgar Square the better.
4propos thereof, Mr. Punch hereby pats the heads of the
Royal Academicians, and the other distinguished artists
who have publicly protested against the six-l in-
truders into Kensington Gardens. When the Sacred Grove
is delivered from the galloping Swells, let it, in gratitude
be called the Grove of Academus, which the Swells will
not be able to spell. On second thought, however, the
rhododendron walk deserves the name already, (if one
accepted derivation of the title be correct,) for, thanks to
Cowper, it is Removed from the People.
Wednesday. If SHERIDAN had written the play of the
Minor, there might, have been some slight, reason for his
descendant's meddling with mines; but as he wanted even
that excuse for º in a Mining Bill which was
generally condemned, and even repudiated by MR. Paulº,
whose name was on it, we cannot condole with him on the
extinction of his legislative Davy's lamp, and the con-
signing it to Davy's locker, The Bill for enabling people
to give criminal evidence without swearing made some pro-
ess. On the Metropolis Act, MR. AYRTQN objected to
the Thwaites Parliament being allowed to alter the names
of streets, sº the power is, to be limited to the cases
where several streets are called by the same name. This

restriction is simply as absurd as most legislation—if a council can be
trusted to unchristen a º of rows of cottages which two uxorious
builders have called Sarah-Ann Terraces, why can it not be allowed to
alter, King Street into Dryden Street, or Buggin's Row into Massinger
Buildings?
The House rose early, and a great many of the Members went and
dressed themselves elegantly, and proceeded to the Mansion House,
where LoRD MAYoR CUBITT gave a splendid feast in honour of MR.
CoEDEN and M. MICHEL CHEVALIER, as negotiators of the French
º The best utterances on the occasion were by MR. Cobden and
Miss Poole, who were loudly applauded. Nothing could be properer
than a City dimer. on such an occasion, for the Treaty is held to be a
piece of peace º and what fitter emblems of Peace and Love are
there than Turtles? Mr. Punch begs also to mention, to the extreme
honour and glory of the LoRD MAYOR, that instead of giving the sort
of wine which mean Mayors have dared to set before the ortal,
LoRD MAyorº Cubitt set forth liquids which were all first-rate, as the
Immortal has some faint recollection of having remarked to the stars, a
en route to Eaton Square.
Thursday. India in the Lords, and a speech by the new Loºp, CHAN-
gºon in honour of the Eng bar, to which the Indian Judicature
Bill is about to qpen a prospect that, as LoRp WESTBURY said, wi
Hº a hydraulic effect upon the mouths of many in Westminster
all, . MR. MILNER GIBson withdrew the Trades Marks Bill, as
requiring more consideration than would be given to it by gentlemen
who are thinking of “marking” of another kind. The debate, when it
comes, will be tiºn. and Mr. Punch begs to º a brief extract
from a leading article in the Glasgow Morning Journal, which in alluding
to a recent case of Trade Marking says–
“Very adroitly had one firm—who, we suppose, are good upon ‘Change for thout
sands—gone about the dodge, Besides adopting the colour of the *. used for
º: the French cotton, which was of a very iar shade, and putting the
rench superscription on the outside, they affixed the mark of an anchor upon the
tº: French device was a cross—but had the packages tied up in such a
way that the string concealed the flukes of the anchor, and gave it all the appear-
ance of a cross also. We need say no more than that the case against these merchant
princes was so clear that the Vice-Chancellor did not think it necessary to call on
the plaintiff's counsel to reply. Let not this instance of unswerving mercantile
morality be forgot when our Sheffield and Birmingham cutlers cry out against the
Belgian makers for imitating their trade marks."
The lawyers had an innings, the ATT9RNEy-GENERAL ºxplaining that
upon the Bankruptcy Bill Government had decided to “disagree” with
the Lords as to the appointment of the new Supreme Judge, and to
make a fight for that creation. MR. Bovill, thought the big Judge was
not wanted, and urged that he would be uncommonly expensive. Various
other big-wigs spoke alternately, and then the new Solicitor-GENERAL
came out with his first official speech, in defence of the Judge appoint-
ment. Him did CAIRNs compliment on his appearance, and seek to
refute in argument, and on division the Government obtained a º
having 173 to 129. As the parent of the Bill is now up aloft, we sh
hear whether his eloquence will avail to induce the Lords to retract
their decision. LoRD, DERBY, Mr. Punch perceives, has packed his
shirts and razors in order to be off to Knowsſey, so the most formidable ||
opponent of the measure will be out of the way.
Friday. LoRD TAUNTon gave very sensible counsel upon the subject
of two statues which are contemplated, or rather which are not at
present contemplated because they are not in existence, but which it is
jº to erect in St. Margaret's Fº Parliament Palace, to
RüNEL and STEPHENson. He hoped that care would be taken to
make these memorials worthy, of the men, and suitable to the locality,
adding a grievous doubt whether they would be either.
An interesting Polish debate followed, and all sorts of noble Lords
expressed all sorts of noble sentiments in favour of Poland; but all
agreed that the very best thing she can do is to lie quiet, and hope
the best from the good feeling of the EMPEROR of Russia.
MR. NewDEGATE made, a speech in abuse of the Inland Revenue
Bill, and a º of small objections were urged against some of its
clauses, but Peelides pushed it through Committee. LEVER, of Gal-
Nº. assailed byFº IRwn, of Quod, declared himself spotless Troy
and v
irtuous, and IRwin something entirely different. As usual
personal matter, there was much solemn cackle.
But then came a debate of real interest and importance. MR. KING-
LAKE demanded whether the Government would deny that the KING of
ITALY had an intention of ceding Sardiniatofrance. SIR. Robert PEEL
supported him in his demand. EARLIUDLow or Russell (Mr. Punch
is always,a-head of all the world) made an effective speech. He paid
a high tribute to BARON RIGAsou, but said that if, after his declaration
that he would not cede an inch of Italian soil, he should think of iving
up Sardinia, he would be one of the Meanest of Equivocators, France
and Italy had distinctly declared to the English Government that there
was no idea of such cession. We ought to be very vigilant, and very
strongly armed, but ought not to be always evincing suspicion. The
#. annexation would at once put an end to the alliance of
England and France. Qur Earl in futuro also spoke kindly of Spain,
warmly of Italy, hopefully of peace, but renewed his emphatic decla-
On a
ration that it was the duty of England, to keep her sword bright
and ready. Bowyer, of course, emitted bosh in the interest of the
Papacy, and, upon him, did Peelides fall in thunder, defending the
olicy of England towards Italy, and braying the Bourbons in a mortar.
ome mewling complaints which poor LoRD Normanby had made, in
behalf of the Ex-Duke of Modena, were hardly worth the notice
of Peelides, but it may be imagined that he made slaughtering work
with them. MR. LAYARD spoke up valiantly for CAvour and his
truthfulness. The whole debate was of a character which the great
Punch has not often to notice, and which, if he were ever given to
despair of our Monarchical Republic, would prevent his indulgi
himself in so unphilosophical arecreation.

AIDS TO AGRICULTURE.
At the Leeds Agricultural Society's annual meeting, there is wont to
be exhibited a number of miscellaneous and unclassified inventions,
unconnected, or supposed to be not particularly connected, with agri.
culture. Among these, this year, were included baths, beer-engines,
and boot-cleaning apparatus. aths, however, and boot-cleaning appa-
ratus, are very desirable adjuncts to a farm. Agricultural º
such as threshing and haymaking, usually induce states of skin which
render ablution, peculiarly necessary, and, after clodhopping over a
chalk or clay soil, anybody would be glad of a boot-cleaning apparatus
at hand, or rather at foot, to remove the five or six pounds of mud
which the clodhopper has cleaving to his heels. Beer-engines, are yery
highly requisite, and on a large farm they ought to be powerful º
so, as to draw beer enough to slake the thirst of a multitude of per-
spiring reapers, who, bathed in moisture, are nevertheless, as they say
in Hampshire, “terreeable dry.” . But the farm beer-engine ought to
be connected with a cellar of good home-brewed beer, and then, it will
have the wholesome effect not only of refreshing and invigorating the
labourers, but also of keeping them away, from the public-house, an
the jerry-shop, where beer-engines generally communicate with the very
worst of swipes, or with bitter ale, the best of which is tolerably good
physic of the tonic kind, and nearly as rice as infusion of gentian ; but
is rather the sort of stuff to cure tile complaint of “seediness,” and
“hot coppers,” than that of natural thirst, such as carters and plough-
men are frequently, attacked with in the course of a day spent in
actively and energetically carrying out the operations of agriculture.
Farm-labourers sometimes ignorantly object to, machinery, but the
dullest of clowns has sense enough to approve of the beer-engine.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWAR1.
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH,
“I DARE say while staying at Rome, or Paris, or Dresden, or
Munich, you have not failed to observe the wond confidence and
simplicity with which our fair countrywomen trip through the various
icture-galleries in those famous cities, making running notes on
HAEL-dotting down TITIAN with an H.B. pencil, transferring
MANTEGNA to the fly-leaf of MURRAY, and cutting up a work by GUIDQ
with no more remorse than, if it were a wedding-cake. The ease and
rapidity with which these charming critics form acquaintance with and
discuss the merits of the old, Masters is truly astonishing. I once
heard a young lady (who º did know how to turn her eyes to
excellent accºunt) remark, that she had done” the Capitol, between
the hours of breakfast and lunch, adding that she would be able to give
me a full description of the Borghese Collection by the time we met at
dinner. “Per Bacco / Ma'am,” I exclaimed—you know we were in Italy,
and I always ejaculate, if possible, in the language of the country where
I am residing—‘per Bacco / What a muff is your humble servant.
Here have I been spending months in the study of a single gallery
and am half inclined to throw up my profession in despair, at my
ignorance.” -
“And this is what I always feel regarding the works of VANDYKE
BRowN and MAC OCHRE in our English Academy, 1s justice ever
done to those renowned artists? Seeing an Exhibition indeed! ...Give
me one picture in one room for one hour and I will try and tell you
. about it. The remarks which l make in these letters may |d
amuse and cannot possibly offend the public, but as for pretending that
I have carefully examined every one of the eleven hundred and thirty-
four works of art exhibited at the R.A., and as for setting up as a
learned critic—psha! I know the value of my own malt, and am as
modest a fellow as you could wish to see. -
“With this little exordium, then I enter the Middle Room, and
without commenting on the unfortunate bathos which occurs from the
juxtaposition in the catalogue of the Spirit's Flight and Preparing for
Dinner, I pass on to MR. CALDERON’s picture (214), viz. Liberating
Prisoners on the Young Heir's Birthday. The youn
what frightened, and but for the presence of his father would hardly
feel inclined to volunteer his own presents to that rascally red-nosed
Bardolph who kneels before him. . The ingredients of tenderness,
humour, beauty, and grotesque, which are mixed together in this
CALDERON make me hope that this gentleman will never let his brush
lie idle—in short that CALDERON wi ...} the pot boiling. - - -
“MR, WHAITE exhibits A Leaf from the Book { Nature, which, is a
modest title, considering the amount of foliage depicted in this land;
scape. It is as full of truth as of beauty, and the moss-covered
boulders are as near reality as Nature herself could lichen them.
. “If MR. Hunt has chosen a simple theme this year,...it only shows
his capability for treating all subjects with equal skill. There is much
to ire in his Street Scene in %. (231), and many will consider that
his lantern maker exhibits his powers in a new i. -
“The Fº (241) by MR. HUGHEs might bear a double interpre-
tation. am still uncertain whether the draper's fair customer is
deterred from or inveigled into her purchase by “ruinous prices,’ and
whether the poor girl in black is concluding a bargain, or being under-
paid for her needlework. In either case the moral is a good one, and I
adyise young ladies to look to it. .
“So much has been said in praise of MR FAED's work (247) that I
may well be excused from pausing to describe it., Such subjects never
fail to rouse an interest in all English hearts, and there was no need to
introduce a minute glass, or let that smouldering candle burn so low to
#. a moral in the “last scene of all that ends this strange eventful
history.’ That famous carpet, which in the Arabian Nights transports
its owner whither he pleases, is scarcely more wonderful than MR.
LEwis's canvas (266) which, under the influence of his magic touch,
sets us down in the Bezestein, Cairo, and introduces us to a blue
breeched, slippered merchant, who, stick or yard-wand (?) in hand, pre-
sides over his goods with a graceful solemnity which does him more
credit than he is likely to give his customers. Not having yet made
much progress in Oriental languages I am doubtful whether the name
El Khan Khalic refers to the party in question, but that his ell cane can
lick is very probable, and Idare say the little ‘gamins’ in Cairo are aware
of the fact and discreetly keep beyond the reach of this ‘regular Turk.’
“I admire MR. KEYi’s very clever and truthful little picture, h’inter
Coals (304), so much that, I hope he will aspire to some subject, of a
higher class next year. To ‘carry Coals to Newcastle' is proverbially
a mistake, and it seems a pity that an artist of such ability should send
them to the Academy.
“It now becomes F. painful duty to call your attention to a pun
evidently perpetrated by the Hanging Committee, who, not content
with, recognising MR. MEADows in A Cornfield § have hung that
entleman's picture close to that of Miss, HAY (308). Writing to
Mother (315), is a little cabinet painting, by MR. ERwood, in that
simple unaffected style which he has almost made his own. It has
more poetry in it than many works of higher aim.
eir looks some- ||
. “No,343 is a noble portrait of Miss ALICE PRINSEP, who must
indeed, be ‘facile princeps” as a reigning belle, if one may judge from
this painting. I say it in all sincerity, for MR. WATTs is the artist, and
S.Work may tend to prove after all"What’s in a name?
No. 381 represents a Franciscan sculptor chi ping away at a huge
gurgoyle, while a jolly old toper “of the º crouches under a
stone bottle (doubtless lately filled with his favourite beverage), as a
model. However much rain º flow through the º it is
*Yident that precious little water has passed the lips of the original.
The sculptor himself seems a jovial sort of fellow, and, judging from
the vigorous blows with which he sends his chisel on the stone, he is
never likely to be accused of “gutting it too fine.”
LESLIE’s reading of the Antiquarian's Story (423) is only
equalled in emphasis by the antiquarian himself, who, leaning on the
back of his chair with a volume in his hand, persists in boring a young
lady, who it appears is in love with his absent son, and is come to hear
what she canº him.
“Fancy what a situation!—to be let in for, perhaps, a dissertation
on the pointed arch at the moment when indulgin her mind in visions
of a domestic circle; to hear of the exploits of the Black Prince
instead of the latest news from her own verdant hero. Ahſ she would
rather be reading a note of his than in possession of the original copy
of Magna Charta. The old gentleman * as well shut up his book at
once for he will surely get nothing but black looks in return for his
‘black letter.”
“Ars est celare artem (as I used to inscribe in my school copy-book)
and there are some works of genius for which all criticism seems re-
undant. They say MR. FECHTER’s performances are so true to nature
that his audience forgets he is acting; and when I come to MR.
M'CALLUM's landscape (456) the last thing I think of is paint. Yonder
are ungenious jº. in oil colour spread over canvas and
strained within splendid frames. But here all thought of gilt mouldings,
pigments, and gesso vanish at once, and I am looking right through the
Academy walls into Burnham Wood on a May 4. It is no fiction,
but the.. itself. . Sure never was seen more wondrous truth than in
the shadows which fall across the foreground from that ancient beech.
The young fresh sward is stretched before you. Those were last year's
eaves which crackled under foot. The lambs come bounding down the
slope; you can almost think you sniff the pure country breeze—and if
that is not illusion in Trafalgar Square, my name is not
“JACK EASEL.”
BEAUX-WOWS
AT LEEDs there has been a grand Dog-Show, all in honour of the
Dog-days, we suppose? A†. lady says that she wishes there was a
Puppy-Show, for she would send her cousin, who she is positive would
win the Prº for she looks upon him as being the greatest puppy in
the world. We are not so sure of this ourselves. At such a compe-
tition, the entries would naturally be extremely, numerous, and we do
not think there is a circle of young ladies in England who has not a
favourite puppy of their own, that they would be prepared to back
with the greatest confidence to any amount. We think some, such
exhibition would be extremely popular, as well as useful. It should
be open to puppies of all nations, and the prizes would be well worth
having, if every puppy was allowed to enter himself at his own esti-
mation. Would the lady patronesses at Almack's mind taking it under
their affectionate care? If they smiled on the scheme, it would be
sure, to succeed. There is plenty of time to organise it well before
the Exhibition next year.
DRAMATIC MARTYRDOM.
AccoºDING to a notice in the Times of the performance of Fabiola at
the Whittington Clubhouse the other night, the martyrdom of the
rimitive Christians was represented on the stage. Fabiola is a play
ounded on the tale of the same name, written by CARDINAL WISEMAN,
whose dramatic Eminence presided at the representation of it in its
dramatised form. The exhibition of martyrdom on the stage is a stroke
of theatrical effect characteristic of the red-stocking school, though a
scenic execution would probably be applauded by a Surrey or Victoria
audience. The Ultramontane and the Transpontine drama exhibit a
mutual affinity. However, we must not hº object to the perform-
ance of Christian martyrdom, or else we shall be accused by our aesthetic
friends of a want of Catholic taste.
A Good Beginning.
It is now known beyond all doubt that BARON, WAY has resigned.
Our dog Toby, who is always º says that the Germans as a nation
would certainly be much more cultivated than they are, if their minds
could only be brought to the resignation of all their barren ways.

ITIME
THE GUARDs' Monument,
AS IT IS, AND AS IT SHOULD BE.
BRITANNIA is a liberal mistress to all who serve her—she is liberal
in money, liberal in #. liberal in honour—or at least, if she isn't
it is not her fault. her º might be better, it isn't BRITANNLA who
is to blame, but her stewards, bailiffs, and foremen, who manage the
wages department. If her gratitude is sometimes' grudging, it isn't
BRITANNiA. whº ºft. it, but the clumsy or pampered menials
whom she is obliged often to send out with messages and on errands
to those who press their claims at her door. If the tributes of
honour she bestows are too often ludicrous, petty, and disappointing
to the people they are meant for, it is the fault of the contractors
she employs to e architects and sculptors, and not the old lady's,
# * d prefer i. workmen, if she knew how and where to
them.
Unluckily, she wasn't brought up with special regard to º:
ments, and it must be confessed, if her contractors' and master-builders’
taste be often at fault, her own would not be much better were she
left to herself. But the old lady means well.
It isn't always the sculptor's fault either, when the last new statue
turns out a failure. Ten to one he has been º In means, or
over-ruled in his design, or otherwise hindered in the development of
his idea. But even if the statue be unobjectionable, BRITANNIA is
pretty sure to hear of some blunder in the inscription, which is always
safe to sin either in bathos, bad grammar, brag, or balderdash.
Take the last monument, but one, erected out of BRITANNIA's
coppers—the Guards' Memorial in Waterloo Place, it isn't what it
should be in all points of design, less, however, by MR. BELL’s
#! than that of the Committee which commissioned and over-ruled
Inn.
But the worst faults of the monument are not those of taste at all.
However good its sculpture, the monument is a standing lie—as great
a lie as the Monument. If that column—
“Like a tall bully lifts his head and lies,”
on Fish Street Hill, the Guards' Memorial lifts its tall head andlies in
Waterloo Place. The lie is not Mr. BELL’s, who was told to celebrate
death in victory, and has done it, by his figure of Honour crowning the
brave trio—Fusiliers, Grenadiers, and Coldstreams—with laurel wreaths.
The inscription, answers to and justifies MR. BELL's design; but it is
precisely in the inscription that the lie is to be found.
Thus it runs,— -
"ALMA,
INKERMAN,
sEBAs TOPOL.
TO THE MEMORY OF 2162 OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE
BRIGADE OF GUARDs, who FELL DURING THE WAR WITH
RUSSIA, 1854-1855-1856."
Fell, i.e. died in battle or of their wounds—died a soldier's death at
the hands of the enemy...But what enemy?...Do those who penned
the inscription mean the Russians? By the list of battles it would
seem so.
But was Russia the enemy, were Alma, Inkerman, and Sebastopol
the battles in which 2162 ºfficers and privates of the Guards fºil in
those years? Let us see the official returns. They tell us that the
total number of the Guards' Brigade killed in the Crimea was—
At Alma . . . . . . . . . 37
At Inkerman . - - - - - . . . 190
Before Sebastopol 61
Anāthat the tºtainumber who died of their wounds was lài
Making, in all, those who died in battle or of wounds . 449
What becomes, then, of the remaining 1713?. Alas! they fell too, but
in the combat with very different enemies. Their enemies were-
FEVER,
DYSENTERY, AND
CHOLERA.
Who slew by the first 376, the second 256, and the third (with Diarrhoea)
839–making the slain in these battles 1471, and leaving 242 for the
skirmishes with such formidable light troops as º Scurvy,
and their train. . -
These are enemies who are occasionally let loose against us at home;
but in the Crimea they were officered, and manoeuvred, by traitors from
our own camp-General Mismanagement, and General Routine, it was
these old villains who misdirected the stores, and crippled the transport,
and prevented the roads from being made, and º the hospital º:
under the shot and shell, and ran riot in the Scutari hospitals, and
made the field hospitals scenes of misery and stench and starvation and
putrefaction, and sent out boys' boots and socks and flannels for big
men to wear, and served out green coffee with no mills to grind, and no
fuel to roast it; and were at the bottom of a great many other of
those master-strokes of mischief, which set BRITANNIA asking whom she
should hang, and left her very indignant she couldn't find the exact
neck for the noose. -
No; the Guards' Monument is a mistake—to use the mildest term.
The figures and the inscription should both be altered without delay.
For MR. BELL’s allegorical figure of Honour, with her arms full of
laurel-wreaths, place on the apex of the º a statue of Florence
NIGHTINGALE, with a bandage in one hand, and a basin of broth in

Inkerman, Sebastopol,” inscribe-
“FEVER,
DYSENTERY,

And then the Guards' Memorial will speak the truth—for its
inscription will commemorate, the most deadly battles the English
soldier in the Crimea had to fight, and its figures will represent his best
aids when he conquered, or his best sources of comfort, when he fell.

TESTIMONIAL TO THE SWAN OF SOUTHAMPTON.
ON Wednesday last week, the statue of DR. WATTs, which has been
erected in the West new Public Park at Southampton, was inaugurated,
the officiating augurs being ministers of divers denominations, and the
Minister of Public Worship (without a portfolio), the EARL OF SHAFTEs-
BURY. As Stratford-on-Avon boasts of the divine WILLIAMs, so
Southampton is proud of the divine WATTs, -
The inauguration of DR, WATTs's statue took place in a tent or
tabernacle, screening it from the popular gaze, to which, however, it had
been exposed the day before, on the evening whereof the ingenious
artist who made it was seen mounted, in true workmanlike style and
.."p." W ladder, º: º: º:º,º
R. WATTS’s e, and giving, with mallet and chisel, the
finishing touch to the Doctor's shoul º
At an early hour of morning the church bells were , and flags
were hoisted on many of the shops and other principal buildings of
.* as they always are when anything at all unusual is going
On there.
About Two o'clock a procession, consisting, of the persons engaged
to be actors in the §. ceremony, and many supernumeraries,
marched from the Audit House up the High Street to The Heavens are
Telling, from HAYDN's Creation, reduced to a psalm-tune, played by the
d of the 2nd Hants, Volunteer Rifles, with the introduction, appa-
rently, of a effect from the British Grenadier. It was remarked,
that the gallant Band perhaps misunderstºod their instructions, since
the air in the Creation most appropriate to the occasion would obviously
have been The Marcellous Work.
The procession was headed by the Rifle band, performing, as afore-
said, a psalmodic march, then came the Sappers and, Miners, and
Ordnance Map-office clerks, followed by two senile mace-bearers, bear-
ing huge maces, and another old beadle between them, carrying a silver
oar, and preceding the EARL QF SHAFTESBURY with the Corporation at
his heels, the Mº. on one side of him, and the REv. THOMAS ADKINs
on the other. After the corporate officials walked the Ministers of
Religion, mostly dissenting; and the Sunday-school teachers brought
up the rear, which terminated in a miscellaneous tail, hard pushed by a
crush of market-carts.
The inauguration § the statue was preceded by one of DR. WATTs's
hymns, and perform LoRD SHAFTESBURY in º .#
uncover the statue, which was *...*. of the sheet it had
been wra in, and stood disclosed, ereupon the people shouted,
and cried "Hooray!” -
Another was then sung, and devotions followed. Discourses
suitable to the ceremony Miº thereupon delivered by the Revs. the
EARL or SHAFTESBURY and THOMAs ADKINs. After their eloquence
came the Hallelujah Chorus of HANDEL, and then an édition de luze of
Watts's Psalms and Hymns was presented to the Rev. and noble Earl.
The Hundredth Psalm succeeded, and like the statue, was regarded as a
eat success. After that the Rev. Thomas ADKINs pronounced the
enediction in º reverend fashion, like a Bishop, and the ceremonial
concluded with God save the Queen. - -
At five o'clock, LoRD SHAFTESBURY dined with the Mayor, and at
seven his Worship the Mayor presided at a soirée which took place at
the Victoria Rooms. In the mean time the Ragged School children
were hospitably entertained on his Worship's la and §§ way of
addition to their entertainment, were addressed by the EARL OF SHAFTES-
BURy, and severally presented with a copy of Iłą, WATTs's Divine Songs
for Čhili.e., out of which we trust they will learn something more
edifying, if not more entertaining, than Old Bob Ridley. Inner,
speech, and presentation, were thus all despatched in two hºurs, which
was quick work for an Earl with a Mayor for his host, and affºrds, to
all º and noblemen, an example which few of them willimitate.
. The business, or pleasure, of the soirée consisted in speeches, recita;
tions, and the singing of psalms, to which were added the means of
bodily refreshment for those who might choose to pay for them. Qwing
to this optional arrangement the good things abundantly provided in
the card-room (where there were of course no ) by MR. FISK,
experienced a consumption in value amounting to rather more than
three pounds. -
The statue of DR, WATTs is a work of the Comic order; that is
º §. of * º: he was º * * a big *:
and aquiline nose, and as such is represented in the costume.9
period, wearing a long gown and a flowing wig. He stands with the
fight hand upraised, as in the act of preaching, and with the left foot
vanced, apparently not putting the best foot forward;, but this, no
doubt, was his natural attitude. The posture is one which, if it were
not that of DR. WATTs, we might call somewhat groggy. The Doctor's
figure is executed in white Sicilian marble; and in the three bassº-
relievos of the same material, on three sides of the shaft of the pedestal,
he is portrayed, on a smaller scale, in as many different positiºns. In
the front one he appears surrounded by children with clasped hands,
and his visage is remarkable for a decided squint, which he perhaps
†. late in life. In that facing the east, DR, WATTs sits musing
in his study, amid mathematical, and astronomical instruments resting
a foot, upon a stool, and scratching his chin; whilst the *:::: side
ibits him seated in the rapture of poetical inspiration, as he probably
ap d in composing “Why should I deprive my neighbour?”
- #: in mind the obligation which that question, suggests, let us
ve the sculptor, MR. Lucas of Chilworth, the gredit, which is his
ue, of having made a statue which, necessarily droll, is yet as orna.

MR. Spoon ER has earned considerable reputation as

too, in that capacity. Or rather he came out in quite
a new Protestant character. He protested against the

vote of £2,000 for the National Portrait Gallery, on the
ground that too much º was º upon pictures
and the promotion of art, and that the trustees of the
Portrait Gallery did not care what was the moral cha-
racter of the persons whose portraits they admitted.
He likewise urged that they cared not how bad a pic-
ture was “so long as it was a portrait of somebody noto-
rious in our history.” This objection is a strange one to
NT proceed from the mouth of a ſº who, on moving
N that the vote in question be disallowed, is represented as
having said that—
|
“He did not propose to divide the Committee on the motion,
N but only to protest against the continuance of such tom-foolery.”
N
What MR. Spoon ER calls tom-foolery is the national
expenditure of money upon pictures and the promotion
%% of art. His estimate of the value of art appears to be
///% º with the ability to distinguish a good pic-
º
- ture from a bad one. The good moral character of a

--- condition for the admittance of his likeness into a
portrait gallery. Esteeming right morality to be based

the exhibition of historical portraits to those of sound

prohibits pictorial likenesses altogether. The religion
of Spoon ER is very like that of MAHoMET, and it is
much to be feared that, as to his opinions about art at
N least, the honourable gentleman has turned Turk.

THE GORILLAS OF THE PRESS.
WE wonder how many of the readers of the Croydon Chronicle felt
that tingling, in their toes which unfailingly betokens a propensity to
kick, when they came across the following impertinent remarks which
a short time since appeared in that influential paper:-
“It is said that PRINCE ALFRED will travel through Canada by the same route his
brother travelled last year. But that PRINCE ALFRED is a “jolly good fellow,” not at
all of an envious disposition, how bitterly would he feel the difference of reception
over the same course. But, if my information be correct, PRINCE ALFRED is not the
lad to grizzle and fret his fiddle-strings with envy and chagrin. Rather is he the
lad to "give his governor the slip," as he would express it, and enjoy himself."
Of course we need not say that these are the opinions of “our
London Correspondent.” No other newswriter would pretend to such
an intimate acquaintance with PRINCE ALFRED as to describe his tastes
and feelings with this familiar freedom. Other penmen, let us hope, if
they possessed such knowledge, would keep it to themselves, and would
know better than to blurt it into public print. At any rate, º:
that the sentiments of Royalty were thought fit to be divulged, the
disclosure would be made without offensive flippancy, and such assume
familiarity as can but breed contempt.
Having shown his intimate acquaintance with PRINCE ALFRED by
chronicling a sample of the slang he talks, the writer next proceeds to
dab his pen into the PRINCE OF WALEs, doing it of course in the
offhand jaunty manner peculiar to his craft:—

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 22, Monday. Our old friend NoFMANBy resolved on an heroic
effort in favour of his friend the Ex-Duke of MoDENA. He moved for
some papers in order to give himself the opportunity of delivering a
very lºng cackle, which be supposed to be a speech, and in which he
abused MR. GLADSTONE for having proved the ex-Duke to be a tyrant.
He read divers letters, and when he had to read his own compositions,
he gave them out with flaps of his wings, and plenty of sound, but MR.
GLADSTONE's replies he mumbled over so that they could hardly be
heard. So LoRD BROUGHAM told him, laughingly, when LORD GRAN-
viLIE had done crying “Shush, shush,” and driving the old goose out
of the position he had taken up. The whole affair would have suit
Michaelmas better than July. for; EBURY made a speech in favour
of a revision of the Fº the Bishop of LONDON told him that
no general revision, would be tolerated, and Lord WesTMEAth com.

same complaint from ladies, who have piteously declared that two hours
in church is “a long time,”, but who have on the previous, Saturday
night sat out five hours of the opera, and stood another half-hour wait-
ing for the carriage.
Once more we had MR.LEVER's case. Now considering that he
came into Parliament, “a Liberal, but pledged to support any Govern:
ment that promotes the maintenance of Galway as a packet station”
É. CAPTAIN DoD), this Irishman is scarcely a person in whom a
ouse of Commons can take any violent interest. However, Members
bore with a º speech in which he contradicted the charges made
inst him by MR. IRWIN, and then walked out of the House. The
ouse decided on not ...; further bothered with the squabbles of the
two Irishmen, and proceeded further to consider the Lords' amend-
ments to the Bankruptcy Bill. Having declared their own views, they
requested the lawyers to draw up reasons for such views.
Then came a smart debate on the British Museum, and MR. GREGoRy
made an onslaught #. PROFEssoR Owen, for advocating a separate
asylum for Natural History. MR, LAYARD complained of the want of
classification of objects, and, as he is to be a Minister again, Mr. Punch
is glad to observe that the Wiember for Nineveh's organs of order are
so largely develo ..MR. Monckton MILNEs also condemned the
state of “congestion” in which the Museum exists. PEELIDEs thought
that nothing but “pessimist” opinions had been advanced, but owned
that the subject demanded consideration. He bore tribute to the
splendid genius of Owen, which ought, PEELIDEs thought, to have
saved him from such an attack as MR. GREGoRy’s. During the recess
Government will think over the business, and talk to the Trustees.
Tuesday. The Irremoveable Poor Bill, the object of which is to make
the rates uniform in the parishes of a union, and to make a three
years' residence by a poor man effectual to constitute a “settlement,”
instead of making five years necessary, as now, was debated in the
Lords, and carried, on Second Reading, by a majority of 9.
LORD MAYOR. CUBITT resigned his seat for Andover, in order to stand

LoRD JoHN Russell appeared in the House of Commons for the

English gentlemen who had visited the works of the Suez Canal, had
been, satisfied. But whether they had been satisfied that the thing
could not be done, or with the bitter beer at the various halts of the
omnibus that runs from Cairo to Suez, LoRD JoHN did not say. Soon
afterwards he shook hands with a few friends, including some of the
Opposition, and with the SPEAKER, to whom he probably said that if
the latter were good, they should meet º in an upper sphere (though
we mean to have plenty of work out of MR. DENIson before we let
him run to coronet) and then, exit LoRD John RUssBLL, soon to be
EARL RussBLL. In the morning he had taken leave of the City, and
expressed his hope that he should yet be able to do the State service.
Hednesday. The religious character of the day was marked by a
little Church Rate debate, and the subject was shut up for the Session

PUNCH, OR THE LON 1).ON
upset everything. This wild Dean may be a clerical Gorilla, but Mr.
Punch, with all respect for the Bishop, cannot understand why all facili.
ties should not be given to voters, even if they are unhappy enough to
live by the Cumberland lakes instead of by the Serpentine, Isis, or Cam.
The Bill prevailed, and was passed later in the week, and as there is no
doubt that the measure is an innovation, the next Üniversity Election
will be in the nature of an experiment. We dare say that the act will
be very acceptable to many a MRs. PARson, whose husband will be able
to hand her the £10 his journey would have cost, and thereby ameliorate
the nether garments of ToMMy, HARRY, SAMMY, IGNATIUs, and little
PolycARP. -
There was a Military debate, and then an Indian debate down-stairs,
and then in Supply, MR. Osborn E fired away at the frescoes in the
New Houses, and declared that they were very ugly, and also were
coming to pieces. MR. CowPER denied both propositions. SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER was very funny. He was angry, at the pictorial preserva;
tion of the fact that Charles THE FIRst's coffin had been insulted
by a Roundhead, because he, SIR. G. was a Cavalier and a Loyalist, and
he was also angry that there is a picture of the slaughter of David
Rizzio, because he did not think that operation was creditable to any-
body concerned. But if our national records are to contain nothing
but illustratious of yirtue, history had better be re-written. Except
the Establishment of Punch, where has there been a grand and unsullied
historical action? There was a mucl, less respectable cavil raised upon
the item for paying the cost of LoRD BRough AM's peerage patent out
of public, money. This objection was not creditable to the clique
that urged it, and was signally defeated, the House feeling that the
tribute to the Old Schoolmaster was a well deserved one. The House
was Counted Out, about three in the morning, and about time too.
Friday. Mr. Punch thought there would be a row. It was stated
that ADMIRAL BERKELEY was to be made LoRD BERKELY., The
eternal GRANTLEY lost no time in petitioning against such title being
granted to his brother. GRANVILLE answered GRANTLEY that there
should be no such Grant. It is said that SIR MAU Rice is to be called
FitzHARDINGE, which is well, because the name will be very pleasant
to G. B. and because it is right to preserve a title that has been borne
by virtue and so forth.
LoRD DERBy evidently does not like being kept in Town, though
what he stops for, nobody knows. He said that there were $3 Biſsio
ass before Prorogation. But as he has not got to pass them, why
oes he not finish packing, and go? GRANVILLE thought that the Lords
might stop in Town and attend to legislation; and this HARDwicke
thought very hard, as other folks were going away. LoRD PortMAN,
for once, came out with a sensible remaik, and said that it was the
excess of talking in the other House that caused delays, and that the
º: should teach the Commons how to get through work without
chatter.
Then did LoRD WesTBURY make fight for his child, the Bankruptcy
Bill, and try to get the Lords to accept the Commons' judgment on the
amendments. is Lordship certainly used apostolical plainness of
speech, and gave his audience to understand that he did not think they
comprehended much about the question. He wished he could have had
half an hour's quiet talk with LoRD DERBY, and would have “laid his
life” he would have converted that Earl. A more earnest effort for a
scheme could not have been made, but it was not fated to be successful.
CRAN worth, and CHELMsFord, and WENSLEYDALE (“I could not
hear a word of what he said,” remarked the Chancellor) all set them
º the Commons, and in the end the principal amendment, that
which floors the Judge, was adhered to by 80 to 46. On other points
the Lords gave way. -
SIR. Robert PEEL goes to Ireland as Secretary—sequitur que patrem
haud passibus ‘. the last word ºf “steady,” pro hac vice,
Wiscount;, the last quotation, meaning on this -
particular desire of a person of distinction, the last phrase meaning Mr.
watch. -
A good deal of money was voted, LoRD PALMERstoN declared that
France was building a great many iron ships, and that other nations
were imitating her, *.after some smart debating, MR. Dish AELI
urged that we ought not to say that we were building ships in defiance,
or out of suspicion of France, but that inasmuch as a new era in ship.
building had come, it was necessary for all nations to bring their navies
up to i. new mark. We should not be insulting. . This elegant sug-
gestion made White bawl out that the Tories clearly expected to come
into office soon, and were trying to make things pleasant. To this
there was no reply made. Ministers are shifting a little uneasily, but
the Constable will keep all steady for the present.
A Flat Contradiction.
THE Era, which is largely benefitted by the advertisements of poor
actors and actresses seeking situations, tries to be “severe” upon the

anxious for “the respectability and advancement of the Drama and its
exponents.” How can that be when the Era considers ITSELF “the best

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON ART.
Notwithstan DING the º De Gustibus, the House of Commons
has of late very frequently engaged itself in debates on the subject of
Art. As the Houses of Parliament are to adorned with statues if
possible, and disfigured with statues, if not, and whereas it is inexpe-
dient that these Houses should be i. by the statues wherewith
they are at any rate to be furnished, and further whereas the disfigure-
ment of the said Houses is extremely likely to be caused by any statue
which they may order to be made, therefore º MR. Cowper, in
his capacity of First Commissioner of Works, will cause every such
statue to be brought before the House of Commons, and will move that
the House do go into Committee thereon with a view to pass the
statue, as it were, into a statute, before allowing it to stand on a
parliamentary basis, or pedestal.
If this plan were adopted, any Honourable Member could, in case he
thought proper, move ºn amendment on the statue's nose, or any other
feature, or part, of its face or bod which he might, deem objectionable
or capable of being improved. The amendment if carried, might be
executed, either by the artist who produced the statue, or by some
other employed as executioner by the House. The various amendments
proposed by the Members of the House on the members and lineaments
of the statue *. adopted, or having fallen to the §round, the
uestion mi it then be put “That this statue do now pass,” and then
hould it, after having undergone the corrections and alterations of
divers Honourable Gentlemen, present, as it might, an unsatisfactory
appearance, the statue might, after all, be rejected. As the sculptor
hired to make it would have to be paid for his work, the rejection of
statues would be º little money away, but nobody could
object to that, except MR: WILLIAMs.
A statue with the merits of which the House felt itself unable to
deal, or could not, agree about them, might always be referred to a
Select Committee, like the business of the nation. In the mean time,
all manner of idle and impertinent questions might be asked of the
Government on the subject of statues and works of art in general, by
Irish Members of the Brazen Band, and other bores individually per:
verse or crazy, or desirous of obstructing wise legislation. One could
rise to move for the production of any correspondence which may have
assed between HER MAJESTY's Ministers and the French and Italian
#overnments touching the Laocoon. Another might, beg leave, in
the absence of the noble Lord, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
now in another place, to ask the noble Wiscount the First Lord of
the Treasury, whether the Cabinet, in its communications with any
Foreign Power, had deemed it necessary to advert to the attitude of
the Dying Gladiator. Honourable Gentlemen would thus highly increase
the merriment, and add somewhat to the utility, of those discussions
which, on Friday night, are their delight, in the Session of the year.

* DEAR PUNCH
- * By far the most important theatrical event that has occurred
since my last letter was the Fancy Fair held at the Crystal Palace on
Saturday the 20th, for the benefit of the funds of the Royal Dramatic
College. After a week of showers, there was “an entire change in the
º, of the weather, and the sun was very liberal in ‘pouring

the day. He º: the stalls with gold, and fº an added brightness
to the smiles of their fair keepers, who had put on for the occasion
their sunniest of looks. Besides your faithful ‘ONE who Pays, there
were present nearly fourteen thousand more who paid, and their pay-

“Of course everybody was there (that is, ...} who is anybody)

(An old Story newly applied, apropos of a late
Debate in the 1/ouse of Commons and a late
Communiqué in the Patrie.
ONCE on a time, in Kilda's isle,
Where nature seldom deigns a smile
To ripen aught that grows,
Where heads of kail are precious things,
And gooseberries deemed fruit for kings,
And thistle stands for rose,
An isleman stout, by dint of pains,
And sore expense of coin and brains
In sheltering and shielding,
With stacks of peat and dry-stone walls,
Contrived to rear, in spite of squalls,
Some kail-seed up to yielding.
Conceive his pride, among his neighbours,
When the result of nine months' labours
Appeared as actual cabbage!
Conceive the strife of hope and patience,
How in his profit-calculations
He grew a bare-legged BABBAGE.
Not TAYLOR o'er his tests and trials,
Nor FARADAY above his phials
E’er hung with fonder care,
Than did our isleman o'er those greens,
As sheltered by their dry-stone screens
They braved the northern air.
BOCK AGAIN 1
He worked by day, he worked by night,
His bound'ry walls were tall and tight,
His wicket locked and barred;
But, as he knew how strong the lure,
To make assurance doubly sure,
He armed for watch and ward—
He sat and slept and took his meals,
With a big bull-dog at his heels, -
A blunderbuss in hand,
As in old times of which we’ve read,
When every man to guard his head
Most trusted in his hand.
But not of all his neighbours near,
Our canny isleman lived in fear,
And kept his armèd watch;
One dangerous rogue next door, he knew,
Had gauged each cabbage as it grew,
With eye that seemed to snatch.
'Gainst him the fences were enlarged;
'Gainst him the blunderbuss was charged;
The bull-dog went unmuzzled;
'Gainst him the owner of the yard
Kept daily watch and nightly guard,
Till e'en this rogue was puzzled.
First he tried arts of imposition:
To wean the keen Scot from suspicion,
Cozen, cajole, and coax him;
Offered to aid him in his digging,
IIisdykes in (what the Scotch call) “bigging,”
But no such tricks could hoax him.
Till on a night both dark and drear,
When round the kailyard, far and near,
Wind howled, and waters roared,
The sturdy isleman shelter sought;
On such a night, e'en thieves (he thought)
Beneath the blankets snored.
But close at hand the rogue did lurk,
Who setting lustily to work
Made in the dyke a hole,
And quick the treach'rous barrier through
His head and half his body drew,
And soon had drawn the whole.
But wary as your rogue may be,
Honesty's wide awake as he:
And so this rascal found.
A falling stone betrayed the thief,
And roused, to guard each precious leaf,
The master of the ground !
Out from his hut he sprang, unfrocked,
His bell-mouthed blunderbuss he cocked,
Unchained his bull-dog stout,
On his detective bull's-eye turned,

OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, - -
“The artist's season is drawing to a close. For at least three
ionths in the year his works are before the London world. And if
there are any grumblers among us who complain that our profession is
a poor one, let them remember how many shillings, how many pounds,
how many hundreds of pounds have been paid down since the Academy
opened, in a cause which they avow the British public has not at heart.
“The truth is that art was never more respected, talked about,
written about, and better remunerated, than in the present time. Was
it three thousand pounds given the other day in exchange for a dozen
square yards of canvas? or four thousand for five thousand *, Shade
of CROEsus' five thousand pounds ! It is a little fortune. Did the
divine RAPHAEL, I wonder, ever demand such a sum ? or the lordly
TITIAN ? or RUBENs the ambassador?. It was in truth a noble picture
—worthy of any age of art. Let us more humble limners, on whom
Fortune has not suiled as yet—let us, I say, as we quaff the generous
double X and inhale our fragrant Latakia, be proud that the nineteenth
century has produced it—ay and paid for it too!.
“To return once more to the R.A: Exhibition...MR. S., SoLOMON
has shown as much skill in painting his picture (493), as honesty in
choosing a subject which he can handle with enthusiasm.
style is a happy mean between the Ideal and Natural Schools of Art.
armonious without stratagem—faithful without affectation—can I say

“What } 'ye lack, Madam, what d'ye lack & is the title #. by MR.
PETTIE to the clever study of a mediaeval haberdasher displaying his
wares for sale (537). This system of shop-door touting carried on in
the middle ages is happily discontinued now, except perhaps in the
case of a few “marts’ in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, where
formerly you could not look for an instant at a window without being
startled by the sudden appearance of a shopman who popped out upon
you (like a spider which had been waiting for its prey), and solicited
your custom. The denizens of Peepingtom Street should subscribe to
purchase this picture which indicates the antiquity (and consequent
respectability) of their line of business. .
“MR. SMALLFIELD deserves, great praise for a very truthful repre-
sentation of humble life in modern #A. His Florentine Sawyers (549),
will be appreciated by all who care to remember such scenes in Tus-
cany... The addition of ‘the dinner hour to the title is sufficient to
describe the subject. It is “mezzogiorno,” and the goodwife has just
brought her husband's dinner. What are the delicacies in that basket?
‘Cerrelli di mongana,’ or ‘coratella di bacchio f", Plenty of *::: you
may be sure will season that oleaginous and humble feast, and there is
no lack of purple figs for dessert. The lower sawyer already looks wist-
fully at the flask of good red wine which I hope will not prove too much
for him; As for the top-sawyer, he is of course elevated enough already.
“Petrarch's First Sight of Laura, by MR, Thomas, is aptly placed as
a pendant for MR. HolipAY's Dante and Beatrice, and both pictures
have their admirers. In the latter, Petrarch is * a little too
effeminate in appearance, and indeed seems almost less of a man than
his mistress. ura is pretty enough to justify the supposition that
the young poet's devotions that morning at matins were somewhat
divided in their object. The meeting of Dante and Beatrice as children
is unconventional in treatment and good in colour, and it is pleasant to
see such a Holiday resulting from such labour. . |
.“ Home from Work (624), by MR. Hughes is a carefully wrought
Fº in the P. R. manner. It is a subject after the painter's own
eart, and if it does not aspire to the high moral-making aim of the
Grand School, is at least ; of good descriptive poetry. The principal
figure—a labourer who stoops down to kiss his children—is excellently
painted, and the youngest girl a charming little creature. It has been
objected that the material of which her dress (a white robe) is made, has
not been †† but afterall does it matter much how the child
itself is clothed, while the whole picture is invested with such interest?
“The Stone Wali, of Old England º speak for themselves, and
surely if there be sermons in stones, these Speeton Cliffs should read
us a homily. The whole scene, from the edge of the precipice down to
the very depths of the scene below is as full of truth as of beauty. The
horizon is placed high up on the canvas certainly, but one likes to see
some subjects from a new point of view. A midday effect seems to
ave been #. to this landscape which is of course all the more
creditable when one remembers it was painted by KNIGHT. -
A still more accurate piece of coast painting may be seen in The
carried as far as it can be. You may count the pebbles on the beach,
identify the geological characters of each rock and almost hear the
roar of the waves as they come dashing on the shore. , Nor has the
painter forgotten that a mere transcript of nature is not the only aim of
art. There is something more than this in that weather-beaten spar
which has drifted in with the tide, and the low swoop of the sea-gull
ºf: the white and misty spray. • * : .
“‘Hah!, Polyboyfoio t es / ain't it MR. HEASELP’ says Scum-
BLEton (whose quotations are not remarkable for accuracy) and then
we cross the room.
“The Arrest of a Deserter (581) is an incident in which, as treated by
Miss SoLOMON, one does not know whether there is more of fun, or
melancholy. Perhaps a mixture of both is intended. A poor private
in the “Onety-oneth,’ who has evidently more taste for the buskin than
the bayonet, has run away from his regiment to join a company of
strolling players and the moment chosen for the tableau is his capture
by two comrades. The guise in which he is º indicates
that he has been the hero of the piece. ‘Oh, Hamlet, what a falling off
was there!’. To think that those hands, which a few minutes since
were clasked in mock agony should now be encompassed by a pair of
handcuffs' In vain poor Columbine intercedes—in vain Mr. Mºº
looks glum. The Fates are adverse and the heartless warriors lead him
down the steps. facilis descensus / who shall say, º when he
remounts to win his laurels, it may be on the scaling ladder!
“The Bribe (590), by MR. Stokey, is well, painted, but a little mys:
terious in point of subject. The scene is laid in the dungeon of an old
castle, date about the let us say—castellated period. Through the
half-open door we see a knight disguised as a friar, apparently bribing a
porter to allow him to enter. . In the dungeon just behind the door
stands a gentleman in a slashed doublet, evidently only waiting for the
intruder's entrance to let fly at him with an arquebuse, while a young
lady stands by º to finish him off with a dagger in case of accidents.
In short, as far as the knight is concerned it will be a case of ‘knocks et
praeterea nihil.’, ‘Querer per solo Querer' is the authority cited by MR.
STOREY for his text, and a queerer Story than this I have seldom seen
upon canvas.
“What! have I arrived at the North Room, with so little time to
explore it! Will that remorseless Hall porter not wait one instant
while I traverse this chamber devoted at once to Architecture and
Miniature-little portraits and great designs—human bricks and their
argillaceous prototypes P, Why am I joking? Do not MR. Scott's
drawings for the proposed Government Offices hang here, reminding me
of what the latter might have been but for PAM's prejudices and his
stern-decree? Adieu DALZIEL, REDGRAve, Thorburn, RICHMOND,
MoIRA. A passing grateful glance is all that I have time for now.

the Royal Academy was the real R-A Society, and, considering the
innumerable shillings they take every year, we should say that the
finances of that illustrious body were extremely, “bobbish.” Again,
our innocence prompts us further to #. whether the Photographic
Society could not put in a claim that would be incapable of dispute-
since it would necessarily be as clear as daylight—to be considered the

“Ah/ You lost a Sight, Sir, I can tell you, by not being at our Review. The Duke is a
Splendid Fellow, Sir, sees everything. There’s no Shirking with him, Sir ; and precious Hard
SPIRITUAL PAUPERISM.
The guardians of the Durham Union appear
to think that there ought to be a correspondence
|between the spiritual nutriment of paupers and
\their material diet, Under this impression it
evidently was that they advertised the other day
for a chaplain, offering the salary of £20 a year.
Their advertisement was answered, by a tender
from one John SMART, who turned out to have
been a clergyman's footman, and conceived
elihat he had learned to exercise the functions of
a parson from his master. He had, he said, "had
a good deal of private practice, but not public.”
The Rev. John SMART, in proposing himself a
candidate for the sacred office vacant, made the
very characteristic and incontrovertible remark,
“The salery offerd is indeed very small.” Such
would be the natural remark, not only of John
SMART, but also of John Thomas; and, no
doubt MR. SMART spoke the sentiments which
he would naturally entertain as a member of the
livery, as well as those which he might be sup-
posed to feel as an aspirant to the cloth.
- It is painful to find a respectable man-servant
- riºto apply for employment in the capacity
of a Workhouse chaplain. Cannot an inferior
class of Clergymen be ordained on purpose to
administer to paupers a coarser kind of spiritual
ſº food? Deep indeed must be the humiliation
experienced by a footman in ºilº
º gold lace for the canonicals of a chaplain
whose salary is £20 a-year.

intending Seller of the scholastic article exhibited, in the early stage
of the negotiation.
arp-visaged old maid, with a little money in the three per cents,
and having nothing to do, and desiring better interest than the Govern-
ment's, has read the advertisement, and does not see why, if she can
make a good bargain, the thing should not suit her. calls on
advertiser, who was almost as sharp-visaged as herself, but has been a
little softened by an offer of marriage from the grocer, who wishes her
to retire from educational life—so she sells the children.
“Come in, if you please, M'm, and you can see the children at their
lessons... Sit down here, M'm, and count, them, if you like, for I am
above all underhandedness, and would only do the thing that is just
and right. That young person? That is my niece. She does the

recommend you the same course, Mºm. Boy at the top of the class?

tax-collector—you understand—we have to attend to these little
matters. Next boy P Little LoRNER, yes—if you want an example at
any time for punishment, he is safe enough—his step-father sends him
here—and you can use him for errands. Next? ell, he is rather
dirty, but his father exchanges coals against tuition, and it does not do
to be too particular. The next—I would scorn to conceal anything
from you, M'm, and I am not sure that he is safe pay, his mother goes out
teaching singing, and owes me a half-quarter, but he is a smart-looking
child, and good to call up when a parent comes with a newº: The
next is going away, and a good thing, for he is a dreadfully trouble-
some and vulgar brat, and his parents stipulated that he was never to
be punished; but I shall do what is right by you, and give him a prize,
because he has two brothers whom I think may be had., The next is
a valuable boy, he is, half an idiot, and is only sent to be out of the
way—we never teach him anything, and, as you see, he is sucking hard-
bake in class—it is a good example to the others, and teaches them
self-denial—you may have him for the next ten years, if you like. The
next is a nice little fellow, his father is an undertaker, and one of the
pleasantest men in the neighbourhood, I trust you may never know what
it is to have a loss, M'm, but if you should, little EARTHwon M's father
will do you justice, his schooling is finishing off a bill for the burying
my poor great aunt, but that you will have nothing to do with. The
next is a nephew of my own; and if we agree, M'm, I dare say we can
make his continuance mutually greeable, as he will . education,
and you will be in need of groceries. The next f would advise you to
be attentive to though he is not a nice child to look at—his name is
SNUFFTON, and his friends keep the Silver Dragon, and have a good
deal to say in the way of recommendation. He and that little LQRNER
had a fight the other day, and SNUFFTON's mother was much pleased
at my sending home Löf NER with a note desiring his step-father to
cane him. ell, M'm, now if you will walk into the parlour, I shall
be happy to show you my account-book, for I desire jºinº what
is fair and above board. #. myself? Well, no, Mºm. The fact is
I am not much fit for teaching, but a few friends thought I could
better myself by opening a school, and MARIA there does the work,

We are at liberty to state that a subscription, has been set afoot for
the purpose of erecting a Chapel-of-Ease to Netley Abbey. The worship

ersons of the softer sex amid the venerable ruins of Netley, has been
elt, by everybody of the slightest pretension to taste and º in the
neighbourhood, to be an incongruity, with those relics of a defunct
faith. In short, the new Chapel to be erected at Netley is meant for
the snobs of both sexes to dance in, so many of them as are too genteel
to adjourn for their hop to the neighbouring public-house.

A DELICATE INQUIRY OFFICE.
It is astonishing that the lady referred to in the following newspaper
paragraph should be a widow:
“Not PARticular. As To A SHADE.-In a Bristol (N.Y.) paper a young widow
lady advertises that she desires to meet with an affectionate and good-tempered
Partner who can offer her a comfortable home. A gentleman of colour not objected
to, from 45 to 50 years of age.”
How did a lady, reduced to advertise for a second husband, and
announce lier readiness to accept an elderly nigger, ever contrive to
get a first? What sort of a person is she to look at P Probably, as the
well- º young lady said of the Gorilla, very plain. Most likely she
is both plain and also not rich; for if she were the veriest griffin, pro-
vided she were well off, she would have, plenty of white suitors com-
ting, uninvited, for her hand. Else, why is it written in the Common
er-book that “A man may not marry his Grandmother?”
et, as the poet sings, “Oh, who doth know the bent of woman's
fantasy P” and as the popular proverb more generally avers, “there is
no accounting for tastes; ” wherefore it is possible that the young
widow who, unlike the celebrated one that resided in the neighbourhoo
of Southwark Bridge, has no objection to a black man, may be not plain
but richly, endowed with personal advantages. On such a doubtf
point as this it is not possible for a mere advertisement to satisfy the
reader. The minutest word painting must fail to present imagination
with a faithful miniature. An interview between parties who might
very likely be disgusted with each other at first sight, is a meeting
unpleasant to venture on. Matrimonial advertisements should there-
fore be illustrated, but then the advertisers would obtain more publicity
than flºº desire, and would afford, greater amusement than they
would like to give to their friends and acquaintance. Under these
circumstances, an enterprising adventurer might surely make ..".

A correct likeness, with a statement of pecuniary circumstances at

ease be clandestinely obtained at the ordinary photographic shops, in

Q. What, then, is the use of studying it? -
A. That we may be able to contradict, by the aid of one writer, any
statement sought to be forced upon us by another.
Give me some instances of this contradictory process.
A. With pleasure, dearest Mamma.
Q. Have you, then, more than one Mamma?

4. I admit the inaccuracy, for which affection must be my apology.
Q_A sufficing one. We will now proceed with our lesson. Why
was WILLIAM THE SECOND called RUFUs? - -
4. Not, as ignorantly believed, from the colour of his hair, which is
known to have been black, nor because in his reign a roof was put on
Westminster Hall.
Q. How was he killed?
A. Not by WALTER_TYRELL, who was never near the part of the
Forest where the king fell.
Q. Has not the story of RICHARD tearing out the lion's heart long
been exploded ? -

but the animal was a tiger, which had escaped from a travelling col.

Q. Did John murder his nephew, ARTHUR 2
A. No, they were most affectionately attached, and the king had
sent, ARTHUR a basket of nectarines on the day he died, probably from
a fall out of window. -
. Is the celebrated scene of John signing the Great Chartafictitious?
. Entirely. The copies were sent to fishotel in a tin box, and he
affixed the signatures while being shaved by his valet. Marks of
lather are still found on two of them.
Q. Was the youth of HENRY THE FIFTH as gay as has been described?
.A. On the contrary, he was remarkably holy and austere, and his
nightly visits to the hospitals to relieve the sick, have been perverted
into the revellings described in the volume assigned to SHAkspeaRE.
Q. You say “assigned ”—why?
A. Because the whole of the plays and poems so long believed to
have been SHAKspEARE's were written by LoRD South AMPtoN with
the aid of SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, and they used as a nom de plume
the name of an obscure actor.
Q. Did QUEEN ELIZABETH order the execution of the QUEEN OF SCOTS?
A. MARY was never executed at all-ELIZABETH's love for her
cousin forbad it—a show was made to deceive the public and discourage
the disaffected—and MARY, under the name of Isabel, FoxTANGEs,
lived for many years afterwards, and died at Rouen.
Q. Had JAMES THE FIRST an antipathy to the sight of a sword?
A. No, it is a slander. He was a good swordsman, and wounded
the CHEVALIER St. GEORGE in a duel, in which the king as incog.

A. He used no such word. He said “December,” thereby predicting
the month in which CROMWELL, like himself, should appear at the place
of execution.
Q. Good child. Will you like to go and play?

but I would, with your sanction, prefer to devote an hour to the study
of MR. BuckLE on the History %Civilisation.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 29th, Monday. LoRD DERBy—we should like to hear what his
family said, or looked, at his perseverance in wasting the fine weather in
fondon when he might just as well have been off—took an opportunity
afforded by the Appropriation of Seats Bill to make some fun of the
Ministers. He complimented them on this little harmless Reform Bill,
to which he saw no objection, now that the Commons had º
altered it into something else than what Government had prºpºsed, an
as soon as further revision should have made it “sense” and “English,”
he saw no reason for opposing it. But it was not all fun on the part
of the artful descendant of JoAN, of Aldithley. There have been ru-
mours that the Constable is meditating another attempt at a Reform
Act, and though most people believe that he is just as likely to be medi-
tating a walk on the electric wire that so horribly disfigures the archi-
tecture in the Strand, the Earl thought he would try to get the story
disavowed. So he declared that of course he i.e.;
of promising Reforms which the country did not ask for, and he hope
it would be understood that the Government felt themselves equally
exonerated from attempts at Reform. LoRD GRANVILLE made a
safe answer, agreed with LoRD DERby that people should not intro-
duce Bills that they had no chance of carrying, but he would not pledge
himself to finality notions, as he was inclined to occasional extension of
the suffrage in a “Conservative” way.
But, perhaps the most amusing part of LoRD DERby's address was |firée
his allusion to the expected advent of LoRD John—now EARL–
Russell. LQRD DERBy spoke of his old friend's elevation to the Lords
in the spirit in which a dweller on Qlympus might welcome the arrival
of a new #. Up here, said his Lordship, in this “quieter,
calmer, and he trusted, purer atmosphere,” the nobleman whom we
shall all delight to see, can occupy his peaceful!hours in giving the final
improvements to his old Reform Bill. Here
“Where the blest Gods the genial day prolong,
With feast ambrosial and celestial song,"
here John Russell, having shuffled off his mortal coil, having, like
had seen the . L
Christian, seen his burden of House of Commons frailties slide from
his shoulders, to be replaced by the mantle of aristocratic, dignity
would be a sort of beatified spirit, walking in, rapture among the gilded
fretwork of our Walhalla, and bending kindly and unfathomable eyes
upon the inferior beings over whom he, now far...above them, would
continue to watch with affectionate vigilance...We never truly knew
before what was comprised in Elevation to the Peerage. -
The blest Gods, though so great, deem nought beneath their care,
and proceeded to deal with Salmon and the Poor, forwarding the Bills
for preventing the improper removal of both.
Let us descend to Earth, and qbserve that though Government had
three times written to the Ryde Magistrates to know why they had
committed one CARTER for three weeks, for sleeping under a tree, no
answer had been sent. The worthy magnates were, busily trying to
find out something else against, CARTER that should justify a retro:
spective sentence, and late in the week they wrote to say that he had
frightened two women by jumping, into the road near them: SIR. G.
Ewis did not think that even this horrible crime deserved all the ven-
geance that had been inflicted, and ordered that the ferocious slumberer
and jumper should be released. LoRD PALMERSTON said enough on the
Galway business to make it quite clear that a certain pleasant compro-
mise long ago expounded by the keen-sighted, Punch, will be carried out
with due decorum, Then came the ever welcome * ropriation B

of their proving valid, a fact which may be interesting to the thousands
who are now letting their moustaches º: and are practising French
conversation with their unoffending little girls. Paterfamilias at
Boulogne may now say, without utter fatuity, “Garsong, je view faire
mon—mon Volunté, apportez-moi une,—you know-une lawyer-une
solliciteur.” -
That Naval Reserve question came up again. The object of the
Government is to give the country, in case of a war, the benefit of the
services of the officers of the Merchant Service. "There was, of course,
some opposition in the alleged interest of the QUEEN’s service, but the
House felt that the º: gain was too great to be thrown away for
the sake of pleasing anybody.
Tuesday. Soon after four o'clock, º outside the House of
Lords struck up “Saw * Johnny Coming?” and in a few minutes
Wiscount AMBERLEy, of Amberley, in the County of Gloucester, and
of Ardsalla, in the county of Meath, and EARL Russell, of Kingston-
Russell, in the County of Dorset, entered the House. He was intro-
duced by EARL GRANVILLE and the EARL OF STRAFFORD. He was duly
walked round the House, pausing at different points, like a soul going
through the stars,
“Refining gradual for his final height,
And purging off some dross at every sphere."
and having taken his Oaths, he became one of the Qelestials. By, a
curious coincidence, the clock that had just struck four marked the
close of the contest that filled up his abandoned seat for the City with
MR. WesTERN Wood, who had defeated the LoRD MAYoR by 5747
votes to 5241. By another curious coincidence, on the day that saw
John Russell a peer, we read that a new DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
had succeeded to the title previously borne by the only personage who
made a permanent mark upon LORD JoHN's Reform Act, having inserted
the Chandos clause. - -- -
Neither Lords nor Commons were inclined to sit. The Nether
House heard a short speech from the CoNSTABLE about Hungary, the
points whereof were that he was vigilantly watching events, that he
should consider it a t misfortune if the Austrian empire was dis-
membered, that he hoped for the best, and meant to be as strictly
neutral in the Austrian as in the American quarrel. , MR. HENNESSY,
for want of anything better to do, tried to procure a side-wind repeal of
the Ecclesiastical Titles Act. Čertain of the Papists will not see that
it is not because the Act is not enforced that, England is a bit more
inclined to recognise the ridiculous insolence that made it politic, but
that having given a very strong, hint, she can afford to let blatant
ecclesiastics ticket themselves with any foolish title they like. The
attempt to re the Act was instantly § down by a majority of 69
to 4, another, hint that º as well be taken. It was backed up on
another evening by LoRD PALMERston's express declaration, that he
had no idea of repealing the Act, and also that he should know what to
do if any special case arose.
Wednesday. It was revealed to the world, by the mouth of MR.
CowPER, that the Government intend to act upon the Report of the
Thames Embankment Commissioners. These gentlemen mean to make
a roadway of one hundred feet wide from Westminster to the Temple,
and then to carry a somewhat narrower viaduct to Blackfriars § e
(of course the splendid new one which MR., PAGE is going to §
and then a new street is to be opened to the Mansion House. And
next year, if the life of the Government should be spared, MR. CowPER
will propose a Bill for entrusting to MR.THyAITEs and his Parliament
the task of carrying out this scheme. Mr. Punch proposes to wait and
see what becomes of the Administration, before entering into the
details of their programme for the 1862 Session.
The Commons, rather than lose the Bankruptcy Bill altogether,
assent to the Lords' mutilations. This Bill passes, and next year, or
as soon as delicacy will permit, LoRD WESTBURY will º to the
Peers that the time has come when an º offers itself for the
correction of an ignorant blunder, which he feels sure their Lordships
must deplore, and for the creation of a Chief Judge.
Having passed a Bill for letting Wolunteers go toll-free through
pikes, the House rose, and the Government went to eat Whitebait at
Öreenwich. The Police have made no unfavourable report to Mr.
Punch, though as EARL Russell, had to wet his coronet, some extra
joviality might have been expected.
Thursday. The Celestials did routine business, La Reine le veut being
said over several tons of parchment.
The Nether House rose before Six, the only noticeable matter being
a speech from the CoNSTABLE, justifying the building of our war-ships,
and ridiculing, the idea of a compact with other countries for, the
general reduction of armaments. Yes, MR. C. BENTINck wants those
ridiculous iron cages taken off the Monument and the York Column,
MR. CowPER said that they were great disfigurements. He mentioned
that the trustees of the York Column had put up their cage because a
musician had jumped off the Monument, a reason which, considering
the character of a great deal of the music of the day, may not seem
extraordinarily strong. -
For a reason which may be ascertained by enclosing a stamped
envelope, and a £10 note, to 85, Fleet Street, Mr. Punch knocks Friday's
Parliament into the middle of next week.
HURRAH FOR A PRINCIPLE.
“JAMEs CoRNwall and JUDAH DAvis were brought before the Lond MAYoa on jº, the
former charged with stealing a quantity of title-deeds, the property of a solicitor, and the latter
with receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen.”
MASTER CORNWALL is, or we presume was, a clerk in the office of a solicitor.
He is about sixteen years of age. MR. JuDAH DAVIS is, possibly,
and, tººk a member of that invaluable association for the enco
virtue, the Marine Store dealing connection. To JUDAH, MASTER
takes loads of parchments, to which he helps himself out of the office of MR.
it seems that, about 500 title-deeds are missing.
JUDAH purchases these valuable articles by the pound, but, being compelled by the
the names of persons who

“Said he did not know where any of it was, for he had sold them to a man who was a stranger
to him. He then demanded why he was asked all those questions, and when told that it was

Mansion House
under the following
circumstances:-
a name that sounds, of course, so like “CoRNwall” that a mistake was
for the purpose of recovering the deeds, he said that he would not
answerū. more questions, for he was not going to criminate himself
for anybody.”
. “Criminate himself.” What can have put such an idea
into the innocent mind of a Marine-Store-Keeper. Surely
the purity of his soul must have been tarnished by associa-
tion with evil little boys, who have sought to, tempt him
to err. False and cruel little boys, perhaps, like TER
CoRNWALL,
“Who was standing by during the conversation, and said that what
Davis had said about the parchment was not true. He would tell
how it was. About-three weeks back he took 'some old law books
to DAvis to sell, and he asked him if he was not in a º: office;
and on his replying that he was, he asked him if he could get some
old parchment deeds. He said he thought he could, and Davis said
if he took him some he would ſº. him a capital price for them—four-
pence a pound. He according
- f took some deeds to him, and he only
the law. Prelimi. gave him threepence instead of fourpence, as he had promised, and
nary justice has on another occasion he had only given him twopence, and never
tenpence, as entered in the book.
This is very, sad, and it is indeed, most unjust that a
º: tradesman should have to hear such things said
of without rebuke from the bench of justice. The
LoRD MAYoR must have been too much shocked at such
depravity and ingratitude on the part of the boy to ex-
press his own feelings—at all events his Lordship is not
reported to have uttered any indigmation. He remanded
the unfeeling lad, and for fearlest the warm and benevolent
heart of MR. JUDAH DAvis should be so softened as to in-
duce him to abstain from appearing on a future day, and
aiding in the next examination into the actions of the evil
boy, the LoRD MAYOR actually remanded JUDAH DAVIs
himself, who, for his unsuspecting kindness and generous
liberality to a young Christian in need, is treated as a
culprit, and had to find two sureties in £50 each, besides
being himself bound in a £iöö nalty against disap-

from the incarceration that seems in store for him, and let this thought
be a comfort to the kindly old Judah, under the unmerited persecution
to which his soft heart and unsuspicious innocence have exposed that
worthy man.
SERVANTS AND THEIR SCHOOLING.
It is not long since Mr. Punch called attention to the fact that good
servants are becoming sadly scarce among us, and that, at least a part
of this deficiency is owing to the want of proper schools, where girls
might be instructed in the course of household duties they are hired to
discharge. The knowledge of good cookery no more comes by instinct
than the knowledge of geography; and it is quite as much an essential
to a girl in humble life to learn º to make a shirt and boil a pudding
or potato, as to know where is Kamtschatka, or what's the capital of
Greece. The use of the telescope may be all very well, but the use of
the rolling-pin, where servants are the students, is certainly far better;
and however jº Arts and Sciences may be to them, what
they chiefly need to learn is good plain needlework and cooking. If
º be taught to read and write, and properly to keep accounts, they
will know as much, or more, than very many of their masters; and
they will make their homes far happier by quick and tidy hands, than
} eads which have been stuffed with knowledge that is useless to
em.
In this age of mental progress and development of intellect, opinions
such as these may be sneered at and abused, as being behind the time,
and Toryish and retrogressive. But that, with all our bragging about
national advancement and education of the masses, our poor children
receive a most imperfect sort of schooling, there is ample, evidence at
hand to furnish proof. Let any reader with a taste for wading through
a bluebook, spend an hour or two in hunting for the Minutes of the
Council of Government Education, and he will find a clergyman attest-
ing to these facts:—
“For want of good schools for girls, three out of four of the girls in my district
are sent to miserable private schools, where they have no religious instruction, no
discipline, no industrial training; they are humoured in every sort of conceit, are
called "Miss SMITH" and “Miss Brown," and go into service at fourteen or fifteen,
skilled in crochet and worsted work, but unable to darn a hole or cut out a frock,
hating household work, and longing to be milliners or lady's-maids. While this is
education, no wonder that people cry out that education is ruining our servants, and
doing more harm than good.”
No wonder, indeed!, and Mr. Punch conceives that nobody possessed
of any brains would take into his kitchena girl who had learned nothing
but worsted work and crochet, and whom, when at school, her mistress
had called “Miss.” This “hating household work,” and “longing to
be milliners,” is productive of more social evil every year; and Mr.
Punch, holds that a father who allows his girls to get such nonsense
#. their heads, is clearly culpable for the harm it may bring
o
Further evidence of moment is furnished in these Minutes, as the
following will show:—
“At a school attended by girls who will for the most part go to service, it was
observed that of 150 girls, scarcely one had a pocket-handkerchief, while there was
scarcely one who had not a hoop. Crinoline being beyond their means, a stout hoo
was worn, with an enormous amount of petticoat, while the indispensable pocket-
handkerchief was absent.”
Elstand that a leading feature in it

“ UN SUJET NOIR.”
We read that the new system of ventilation, patented by MR. Cooke,
“consists in a fine adaptation of wire-gauze to open windows, so that
the air is allowed to steal gently in and out, while violent draughts, and
those enemies to ventilation, the blacks, are carefully excluded.” The
latter qualification should recommend it for universal use in America.
By “carefully excluding the blacks,” it would be the very instrument
for ventilating the question of slavery, and moreover would help to allay
that feverish warmth offeeling that is at present raging between the
North and the South. By the way, we see in the above. º
that the blacks are denounced as “enemies to yentilation.” e
enough, many a courageous fellow has fallen a yictim to the Lynch
Law, by espousing the cause of “the blacks,” and so, we suppose, has
experienced, from losing his life, the very greatest º lil reathing.
If MR. Cooke's patent will remedy, this stoppage in the continuous
supply of air, we must say that it will not only effect wonders with a
large class of persons who cannot open their mouths on the question of
slavery without immediately getting black in the face, but will, also,
contribute largely to the cause of civilisation by tending materially to
the prolongation of life.
The Right Man in the Right Place.
THE LoRD MAYOR should not be surprised at the success of his
rival. As a builder, he ought to have known that in the nature of
things it could not well be otherwise. Where would one expect to find
Wood, pray, but at the head of the poll?

ART IN PARLIAMENT.
“Ars est celare artem” is an old proverb, and SIR. G. Bowyer, that
eminent Royalist, Cavalier, and first trombone of the Pope's Brass
Band, is of opinion that the best way to “hide the Art” of the New
Houses of Parliament would be to apply to it a good coat of whitewash.
SIR. G. Bowy ER is a man of such remar º sense—his opinions
on questions of public duty and statesmanship are so sound and com;
prehensive, his views of government, education, civil and ecclesiastical
olicy, are so sagacious and so eminently English—that one naturally
É. with #3. respect to what he has to say on Art as employed in
the House of Commons.
SIR. G. Bowy ER thinks that the idea of promoting the Fine Arts by
spending the º: money on frescoes, statues, and pictures, is quite
fallacious—and he proves it with that admirable logic which peculiarly
belongs to him. s reason for the conclusion he has come to is, that
though portrait-painting was the branch of the Art which received most
encouragement in England, we have now no portrait-painter equal to
SIR. Joshua REYNoLDs or SIR THOMAS LAwRENCE. We were not
aware before that SIR Joshua or SIR THOMAs were paid out of the
public. purse, but we are glad to live and learn at the feet of such a
Gamaliel as SIR. G. Bowy ER.
Bowy ER then shoots his flight at the frescoes., Poor frescoes!—It
was said they were coming off the walls—it would be well if they did.
One of them represents a brutal insult offered to the remains of
CHARLEs THE FIRST by a Roundhead soldier, thus giving, extreme
offence to SIR GEORGE Bowy ER “as a, Royalist and Cavalier.”
These are new characters for this versatile civilian, We have lo
pleased ourselves with imagining in the chain mail and red-crosse
Surcoat of a Knight of St. John; and now for a while we may picture
him to ourselves in the Vandyke doublet and fallin
Caroline age. Why should not SIR GEORGE offer himself to the House
as a model for the central figure of a series of historical designs to
take the place of the subjects fixed by the Fine Art Commissioners?
We might begin with Bowy ER as an Ancient Briton, in his woad and
tatoo-marks, as
“Wild in woods the noble savage ran.”
Then we might have Bowy ER as a Saxon captive in the Roman slave-
market,_“non Anglus sed Angelus,”—with St. Augustine in raptures
over his combined innocence and beauty;--then Bowy ER as a Crusader,
in his habit of the Order of St. John, drawing the teeth of an unbe:
lieving Jew, till he comes down with his j dust for the good
of Mother Church Militant;-then Bowy ER as at once Papal Legate
and Royalist, upholding John against his rebellious Barons at Runny:
mede;—then, Bowy ER as an ecclesiastical lawyer, by the Smithfield
faggots, sniffing a roasting heretic, temp. Mariae inolenta;-
then Bowy ER as a Jesuit Seminarist, giving a dagger, º: blessing,
to a Romanist conspirator, in the days of good QUEEN BEss;–then
Bowy ER as a pillar of the Old Faith, settling the details of his coup
d'état, with the much maligned GUY FAwkes;-then Bowy ER as a
Cavalier in love-locks, and a point-lace band failing over his buff coat,
backing up that blessed martyr. CHARLEs in his seizure of the Five
Members;–then Bowy ER as a pious, Page at Whitehall, carrying the
historical warmin º into the bed-room of MARY OF MoDENA, or
kissing the hand of JAMES THE SECOND which has just flung the Great
Seal of England into the Thames;–then Bowy ER as a faithful adherent
of CHARLEs, EDWARD, in full retreat from Derby, or grinning through
a hempen collar at Tyburn;––and lastly, Bowy ER kissing Pio NoNo's
toe, and invested with the Örder of the Špur in the Vatiºn:
Here would indeed be a series calculated to rejoice the heart of any
Royalist and Cavalier, though it would unluckily exhibit SIR GEORGE
invariably on the side which a base and brutaſ Nineteenth Century
insists on calling that of darkness, tyranny, and superstition. But SIR
GEORGE, besides his general abuse of the Arts in the House of Commons,
condescends to particulars. He is severe, for instance, on The Baptism
Qf King Ethelbert, because the King is naked, except his crown, and
kneels by a font, in which he cºuld no more be immersed than in a
teacup.'... It is unlucky that MR. Dyce in both points—the nakedness
of the King and the smallness of the font—should have followed the
nearest available authority, and should have shown us Ethelbert under
baptism, as the MSS. of nearly the same date show AGILULF, King of
the Lombards, in the same act.
SIR. G., recommends the Government “to put a stop to an expendi-
ture which produces results which give foreigners a very low idea of the
standard of Art in England.” Perhaps SIR GEORGE does not suffi-
ciently consider that if foreigners go for their “standards” to Par-
liament, they may be liable to undervalue other things besides our Art.
Suppose, for instance, they were to fall upon SIR GEORGE's own speeches
as standards of English sense and Parliamentary wisdom?
But nothing in SIR. G. Bowy ER's speech becomes him like the
closing of it. He tells us that “he places great reliance on the Noble
Lord at the head of the Government, in matters of taste /* We have
lon
long been accustomed to deplore LoRD PALMERSTON's unhappy bent ment, the Hon. Member for Liskeard º be locked up.
in Art, but we have never yet seen, so conspicuous a condemnation of
it as this reliance of SIR GEORGE Bowy ER's. SIR GEORGE is sorry, he
was not “present at the recent debate on the style of the Forei
Office, to show that there was at least one Italian question on which he
agreed with the Noble Lord.” . Let LORD PALMERSTON pause before
it is too late, and reflect what it is to have SIR GEORGE Bow YER agree
with him |
But Bowy ER was not the only new light that last week saw set up
to guide the House aright in matters of Art, OSBORNE–the brilliant
BERNAL-or BURN-AIL, as he might be called, in consideration of the
heat, light, and brightness of his wit—had preceded Bow YER., He
was lambent, corruscant º How his lightnings were made to
play about the devoted heads o the poor painters, who had laid their
profane hands on the walls within which Osbor NE deigns to enlighten
and convulse the world!. Think of MACLISE, or Dyce, or HERBERT
or WATTs, in the hands of QSBoRNE—mere mice in the paws of a ionſ:
Only it seems hardly worth while of this monarch of the woods to
waste his gigantic strength on such small deer | . There was LORD
MAGAULAY's old New Zealander called up to ask, what he would think
of the frescoes, when he sat down on that famous sketching job of his
from the broken arch of London Bridge. But no; the frescoes would
have all faded from the walls long before the New Zealander's visit—
they were falling off already—“Cordelia was defaced, and Lear was
almost invisible.’
The House's enjoyment of this º: fooling might have been
lessened had it been told at the time that the facts were untrue—that
Cordelia's beauty was as fresh, and Lear’s age as venerable, as when
MR. HERBERT first withdrew the screen from before his fresco. And
this even the brilliant BERNAL was forced to admit the next night.
But he got more of his own peculiar chaste and refined fun out of the
very admission, telling us it was true that Cordelia and Lear were all
collar of the
i. t, but “ §. nose was in a rapid state of decay, and would {{.
bably fall off before the Session was over.” We might"remind MR.
QSBöRNE that even if his charge were true, many a Member might envy
MR, HERBERT's fresco, and wish that his own “Ayes” and “Noes.”
could be as easily effaced from Hansard, as Cordelia's eyes or Regan's
nose from the plaster of the Poets' Corridor.
Mr. Punch would only remind these brilliant orators, and cruel critics,
that art, like oratory, is not learnt in a day—that it requires a long
course of experiments before you can hit the way either to ornament
the walls, or amuse the groundlings, of Parliament. But, comparing
Art and Öratory, we should be sorry indeed to pronounce the Art that
adorns the walls of the House of Commons as low in its way as much
of the eloquence that is considered sufficient to enlighten and amuse the
Members of that House; and we would in conclusion remind Honour-
able and facetious Members who may be inclined to applaud or imitate
OsBoENE and Bowy ER, that “it is an ill bird that dirties its own
nest.” It will be a fair day for England when she can feel as proud of
the work done and the speeches spoken within the walls of Parliament
as of the works painted upon those walls, with all their deficiencies; and
we must protest equally against being committed to the historics of
SIR GEORGE Bowy ER, and the aesthetics of MR. BERNAL OSBORNE.

IN PICKLE.
ECENTLY in the House of
Commons, the . House
having gone into Commit-
tee upon the Statute Law
Revision Bill, MR. HEN-
NEssy, according to the
reported debate, said that
as the Bill was intended to
repeal useless and obsolete
laws, he thought the Eccle:
siastical Titles Act might
well be included amon
them; and, SIR
LEwis having, in answer,
observed that the motion
of the Hon. Gentleman par-
took rather of the nature
of a practical joke than a
serious motion, thereupon
the gallant crusader,
*Sir G. Bowyer asked whe-
ther any one could point out
what practical effect the Ecclesi-
astical Titles Act had had.
(Hear, hear.) If an act which
had never had, and never would
have any force, was not an obso-
lete Act, he did not know what
was one."
- -
-
It is not at all difficult to pºint out to SIR.GEORGE Bowyer what
practical effect has resulted from the Ecclesiastical Titles Act. The
prestige, to quote a word from the vocabulary of humbug, of the Pope
and his priesthood, was shaken by the enactment of that measure.
Many, people were prevented from turning º who, had it not
assed, would have thought it had been defeated by supernatural power,
ut who lost their º in the Pope when they saw him beaten
by the British Public. The º of the Italian revolution was
probably much accelerated by, and there is reason to suppose that the
emancipation of Italy has been in no small measure owing to, the
spectacle of the self-styled successor of St. Peter opposed and baffled
in his attempt to º the people of England.
If no practical effect had been likely to be produced by the Ecclesi-
astical Titles Act, why did Honourable Gentlemen of SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER's persuasion so violently endeavour to arrest its progress in
the House of Commons?, Why did, the Pope's Brass Band trumpet
nst it so furiously, and why, as MR. HENNEssy, or any other, one
of them, might say in a national form of speech, do they still keep
haping on the same, string? -
he Ecclesiastical Titles Act will doubtless be a dead letter, so long
as Roman Catholic Bishops confine themselves to minding their theo.
logical business. Let any of them endeavour, like some of their forei
brethren, to foment sedition, and then, if they cease to be ºf.
and become dangerous, Sir George Bowyer will probably find that
the Act which he considers obsolete will have quite force enough for
the purpose which it was meant to serve.

MAY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION NEVER ALTER
COLLABORATION.
QUR excellent contemporary, the Daily Telegraph, published on the
ultimate day. of July a biography of a Duke just deceased, and also an
eloquent leading article on the same individual. Desiring to complete
our judgment of the character of the departed, we could wish to know
which of the articles, published simultaneous! , is to be accepted as
truthful. For, lo!,
Biography. Leading Article.
“Extravagant he was, certainly; over- “His life was pre-eminently a mean
bearing he may have been; but he was, shabby, and shuffling one. He muddled
at all events, in prosperity brave and away his millions as though they had
generous, with all his faults.” been the rents of a coalshed. * * *
Had there been anything noteworthy,
anything really estimablein hischaracter,
he would not have been suffered to sink
so entirely into decadence.”
As the Cabman remarked to the ladies and gentleman in Pickwick,
when all gº him contradictory orders as to the door at which he was
to stop, “All I sayis, settle vich it is.” - -
Bufif collaborateurs differ, contemporaries differ almost as widely.
The Telegraph observes:–
“The town rang with indignation when he not only overpowered his son and heir
into cutting off the entail of the estates, and robbing him and his seed for ever for
the parent's folly and the creditors' greed, but absolutely prosecuted him for perjury
before a court of justice, when he denied having signed a certain deed, which, like a
hundred others, was given him in all haste to subscribe to, not to examine. The
host of eminent witnesses who were proud to accompany Load CHANDosinto court-
Lord BRougham, the PRovost of Eton, &c. &c.—was sufficient proof of the son's
character, and the father's character was made evident to all men by the fact that
his son stood at the baron such a base charge—that son whom the father's greditors
so trusted that they made him receiver of the estates, a post which enabled him to
live comfortably—even luxuriously—had he not out of his income supported the
man who prosecuted him 1"
The Morning Chronicle says:-
“Warm-hearted and hospitable informer days, and honest and just in the hour
of difficulty, the late Duke willingly allowed his estates to be sequestered, so that
his creditors might be paid in full. In this effort he was honourably seconded by
his only son, the MARQUIs of CHANDos, as our readers are aware. The present
Duke, remarkable for his business habits, must, ere, long, be in possession of an
income calculated to support his dukedom. As opinions opposite to these facts
have been very generally entertained, it is only fair to the memory of the late Duke
that this statement should go abroad.”
Again we must revert to the language of the excellent Pickwickian
cabman, and say “Settle vich it is.” We ought to have no erasures
in our Golden Book.

END OF THE SESSION.
Mr. Bull. “So THE WorkMEN ARE out AT LAST | PLENTY of SHAvings, MR. PAM, BUT MIGHTY LITTLE Work, I'M AFRAID."
A SHORT WAY WITH SECULARISTS.
WE congratulate the partisans of absolute squirearchy on the verdict
of that enlightened Devonshire Special Jury, which, at the last Exeter
Assizes, in the case BRADLAUGH v. Edwards, awarded the Plaintiff,
who sued the Defendant for assault and false imprisonment, the lowest
amount of damages which they, could legally give him. The assault
consisted in a seizure of the necktie, and a pressure of knuckles into
the throat, by Policemen acting under the orders of the Defendant,
their superintendent... The imprisonment, included five hours in an
underground cell, without fire or light, in the month of March, and
lasted from Sunday till Monday morning... It was, therefore, an injury
for which a British Jury, more jealous of the liberty of the subject than
zealous for the ". ustices, would have ordinarily given heavy
mages. The Devonshire Jury gave MR. BRADLAUGH one farthing.
The fact was, that BRADLAUGH was not only one of those fellows
who ought to be put down, but he was one of those fellows who qught
to be §. down without any ..". standing upon niceties of law.
This fellow, BRADLAUGH, who calls himself “Iconoclast,” is a sec
lecturer. He was collared and walked off to the station-house by the
direction of MR. Edwards, the Plaintiff, out of a field which he was
about to deliver a secularistical lecture in, and which he had hired for
that purpose. MR. EDWARDs had previously, instructed by the Magis-
trates, prevented him from lecturing in Ijevonport Park, a place in
which he had no business but what the authorities chose to grant him.
They could not legally exclude him from the field which he had hired
so, their officer, MR. Edwards, strained the law a point for them, and
did it §: at the small cost of one farthing, and legal expenses,
which he not, of course, have personally to defray.
The lecture which, MR. BRADLAugh meant, to deliver, had he been
permitted, would, there is, every reason to believe, have formed an
exposition of º much the same as those put forward in Essays
and Reviews. On that heterodox work Convocation could only venture
to decide that there were grounds for proceeding to synodical judgment.
It availed itself of an excuse to shrink from pronouncing judgment
thereon. The timidity which Conyocation thus displayed must have
been j painful to the enemies of free theological discussion. Pro-
portionally cheering to that intelligent party must be the boldness of a
ular |about lecturing
Magistracy and Constabulary who rush in where Divines fear to tread,
and take an “Iconoclast” into custody; and they doubtless feel equall
reassured by the healthy spirit of dogmatism which must have actuate
a Jury that virtually sanctioned them in doing so. , MR, EnwARPS's
Policemen caught MR, BRADLAUGH by his tie, and dug their knuckles
into, his neck. , MR. BRAPLAUGH, is a layman, and his tie may be a
black one, or a bird's-eye for aught we know. Is there no Constable
likewise, ready to seize hold of the white tie of any or every cleri
writer in Essays and Reviews º' Cannot the REv. Row1AND WILLIAMs,
D.D., Wººl and Professor of Hebrew, St. David's College,
mpeter, Vicar of Broad Chalke, Wilts, be collared like MR. BRAD-
LAUGH, by the Police, and º summarily to Quod, at the charge
of one farthing only, instead of costing the Bishop of SALISBURY
a ºut of money for his prosecution, and perhaps getting off after
all
. Hurrah for the orthodox reaction which º: is commencing ! It
is by no means enough that every man shall be responsible to a court
of law for the expression of his theological opinions. Fellows who go
and i. views the assertion of which may or
may not be unlawful and punishable, must have their mouths #:
at once. This object is to be effected by the Policeman, with
grasp on the lecturer’s “choker.” Thus, and not, by a tedious and
expensive trial, to say nothing of argument, should the preachers of
. be silenced: as they are at Devonport, and might have been at
Naples in the time of BoMBA. The Magistrates ...i i. of
controversy, and the Policemen enforcing their decrees, the office of
jº. of the peace will become a holy office indeed, and the constabu-
ary will rise into familiars of a British Inquisition. This consumma-
tion most devoutly to be wished, will at least result from the prevalence
of that superiority to vulgar sqlicitude for freedom of discussion which,
in the case of BRADLAUGH v. Edwards, was signalised by a Devonshire
special jury.
A Man of High Family.
It is not generally known that M. BioNDIN is connected with one of
the most illustrious families of the English Peerage. The great funam-

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
A STORM of £10 notes set in with unprecedented severity immediately
upon the appearance of Mr. Punch's intimation that the reason why he
cut short his Parliamentary narrative last week might be learned by
means of such enclosures. It would be manifestly unjust to his cor.
respondents did he publicly reveal a secret which they were invited to
purchase; but for the satisfaction of posterity he has prepared a memo-
randum of the facts, and has deposited it in the Record Office, where it
may be inspected, any day between 10 and 4 after the 1st January, 1899.
The Index word is “Weyze-Goose.” -
The º: of the Session offered little that deserves immor-
talisation. The LoRD CHANCELLOR took an opportunity of informing
the Lords that the Bankruptcy Bill, with all its mutilations, would be
of great service to the commercial world, and that he had no doubt the
Chief Judge clause would beintroduced in the next Session. LoRD
PALMERstoN stated that he did not think that the Spaniards meant to
retain permanent possession of Tetuan, but that he believed they were
using it only as a screw to get money out of the Moors. . He also
expressed himself very strongly upon the atrocities of the brigands of
Naples, and hoped that "those wretches would shortly meet with their
just punishment” notwithstanding that they were sent out from “the
oly city of Rome.” LoRD SHAFTESBURY finished his work for the
Session by one of those deeds which incline Punch often to forgive him
for his spiritual tyranny over LoRD PAIMERSTON in the bishop-makin
department. He obtained an address for º into the condition o
the children who are employed in a yariety of trades that do not come
under the action of existing restrictions. And when it is known that in
some of these trades infants of four and five years old are worked
twelve and fourteen hours a day, it will be thought that it is almost
time to protect them against the greed of parents and of employers.
The Galway business was again brought forward, and LoRD PALMER-
* O.K. in the American language, stands for “all correct,” or “orl korrect.”
STON thought that much was to be said in favour of giving the Company
another chance. He has made the discovery that Galway is, geogra.
hically, the most central port in the West of Ireland, and so forth.
he Government is unpopular in the #. isle, and if a dissolution
should now take place, the Tories would grab a good many seats. . But
the Prince's visit, to be followed by one from the QUEEN, and the
announcement that the claims of Galway will be favourably regarded,
may do something for the Administration, and the Constabiº (who by
the way is shortly to be presented with his staff upon the Heights) is
wide awake to the exigencies of the crisis. , To another and more im-
portant exigency he also proposes to show himself equal...The States
whose forces sustained on the º Sunday after Trinity, last past,
the most remarkable defeat that has been inflicted on ji. since
America was discovered, have devised a curious administrative plan.
They declare blockades of ports, but propose to levy customs by means
of ships that are to sail out and intercept customers. This is a bit of
bold ingenuity, but LoRD, PAIMERston is blind to its cleverness,
declares it preposterous, and will not permit English vessels to recog-
nise the absurdity. We may hear more of this difference of opinion
between a Premier and a President.
There has not been much else worth note, and the Commons, like
the audience in other theatres, were played out with a stupid farce.
MR. Scully had !. a speech on the wrongs of d, when he
was shut up by the Black Rod, on
Tuesday, August 6th, PRINCE, ALFRED's birthday, when PRINCE
ALFRED's Mamma sent the following message, which was delivered
in the silver tones of the new Lord CHANCELloR:
My Lords AND GENTLEMEN, -
The Session done,
You have your QUEEN’s free leave to cut and run:
For services, from all degrees and ranks,
Your Sovereign tenders you her heartiest thanks.
With foreign powers she's on good terms, just now,
And trusts there’ll be no European row.
Italia has elected to unite
Under KING WICTOR's sway. May all go right!
In Yankeedom is raised the battle-cry:
We mean to put no finger in that pie.
The Powers have quashed that horrid Syrian riot,
Withdrawn their troops, and hope for peace and quiet.
India’s improving hugely, and expresses
Hope to be lifted from financial messes.
BELOVED CoMMONs,
Thankfully is noted
The willingness with which the Tin was voted.
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
- - The QUEEN reveres
The noble spirit of the Volunteers.
Gladly she wills the measure that allots
The forfeit seats of two most wicked spots.
Gladly she wills the Bill (my Bill) that deals
Justice where now the Bankrupt Harpy steals.
And gladly welcomes (not before its time)
Consolidation of the Law of Grime.
Henceforth, the Indian with well-tutored mind
May serve his Sovereign in the East, he’ll find.
You’ve treated º the QUEEN is sure,
Harbours; and Sea Tolls; and the Settled Poor.
Nor can She pass unmarked the striking fact
That you have passed a decent Drainage Act.
Pleased, she beholds throughout her wide domain
Order, contentment, and obedience reign.
Now to your Counties. Do your duties there,
(The Speech concluded with the usual prayer.)
Then the great Punch, with quiet smile, drew out his f. pen,
Jotted these diamond paragraphs, admired of gods and men;
Then called unto PEELIDEs, “Ho, WILLIAM GLADstoNE, ho!
Bring me a quart of claret, man, the wine thou vauntest so.”
The wine was brought by GLADSTONE, and the cup was held by PAM,
And the new Earl, John Russell, begged permission to stand Sam,
Which Punch, the ever-affable, gave John NY leave to do,
And bade Spr Roundell, PALMER show his science with the Screw.
Qut blobbed the cork, out gurgled fast the wine so fresh and cool
...Who loves not woman, wine, and song,” saith LUTHER, “is a fool”
This quoted Punch, then heaving up the goblet, with a wink,
(The eaded bubbles winking, too, upon the purpled brink), .
I’d drink,” he cried, “to Woman, and I’d sing to her beside,
‘But at this present speaking I am better occupied.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then throwing back his Jovelike head, the proud Immortal poured
Adown his throat the wine which like a mountain cataract roared,
Nor paused he till the goblet he reared loftily on high,
Reversed, had turned its bottom to the everlasting sky.
Some drops remained, which Punch, whose wit no coarseness e'er may sully,
Flung as libation in the face of Mr. Vincent Scully. .
Then, with a condescending nod that filled their hearts with glee,
(Such power have the Celestials), “Ha, I’m better, bºys,” said he.
*Here shuts the Session’s chronicle, here ends the Tale of Talk,
The sixth of August is a day I mark with whitest chalk
And truly glad am I to think that with these words is DoNE
The Essence of THE PARLIAMENT of EIGHTEEN SixTY ONE”
FINERY IN THE KITCHEN.
WE lately called attention to the fact that English maid-
servants have not the very best of education in the world,
and that ladies would do well, when they º: a pretty
china-breaker, to ascertain that she has not been a pupil
at a day-school, where more regard is paid to Crinoline
than cleanliness, and where pocket handkerchiefs are held
of less account than peacock-feathered porkpie hºts. Th
mania for fine dresses is a sadly growing evil, and ill-
educated minds of course are most affected by it, Man
a servant squanders her savings in cheap finery, and spen
on Sunday shawls and bonnets what would well migh fur;
|mish her a cottage, when she married, or at least afford
some shelter against a rainy day. Instead of having fore-
thought for ºf their nests, girls, too, often only
|link of feathering themselves, and by dress far too
finely for their station, they affright the homely lovers
* are anxious to attract.
ow far ladies are to blame for the finery and aped
entility of servants, is a question which, if asked, stands
ttle change of being answered, except by misogynic
monsters who are ungallant enough to sneer at the fair sex.
Woman, say the cynics, is an imitative animal, and if a
servant sees her mistress extravagant, in dress she herself
becomes infected with the mania, and makes herself ridi-
culous by giving it full vent. Having neither taste nor
money to turn it to advantage, she takes a leaf out of the
fashion book on which her mistress pins her faith; and
walks out of a Sunday like a daw in peacock's plumage, or
a Swelless in burlesque.
Of course, except to mº Fashion, Britons and
Britonesses never never will be slaves; and now-a-days our
servants are by far too independent to submit to any law
for their sumptuary restraint. It is a pity, nevertheless,
that we have not a national costume for our domestics, as
we have for our Queen's Ministers and servants of the
State. Qurpretty china-breakers would look a vast deal
# prettier in suitable attire, than they do now in mock
millinery and Brummagem glass brooches, and cheap cotton
#|imitations of costly foreign silks.
WE women live for each other—that is, for the love of
criticism of each other.
AN ANSWER TO CORRESPONDENTS.
SoME years ago, English notions of expediency induced the authorities
of London to execute a certain Scottish gentleman of title. Since that
time opinions have been a good deal modified, and the individual in
question is now regarded as a patriot, not only in his own country, but
in that of the posterity of those who put him to death. There the
matter might have rested, unanimous sentence being given in favour of
the deceased, and his place in history being assigned him. He was a
very brave, rather ferocious, and occasionally successful retarder of the
process of amalgamation which has fused Scotland and England into
the single nation which now leads the World. However, certain Scots
think that more ought to be done, and have resolved, on erecting a
memorial tower to the personage in question., This is their affair, an
not that of the southern portion of the island. Mr. Punch might not
have alluded to the business at all, but from his having received a
º number of letters from Scotland, a few of a taunting character
ut not amusing enough to be reprinted, while the large majority call
on him as a Brither Scot to “walk into this º Now, he
cannot exactly walk into it, because it is not yet built, and for the
reason above-mentioned, he does not intend to walk into the artificers.
He Prº to let justice be done in the matter by Scotsmen themselves.
Ho! doomster!, .
He answers his, correspondents from the Land of Cakes by the
following paragraphs. º are written in Edinburgh, and published
in Inverness, so may be taken as the sentiments of the Capital of the
Lowlands, and of the Capital of the Highlands
“Stands Scotland where it did? Has it been raised on the win
enthusiasm high into the empyrean, into the seventh heaven, or has it merely
reached, º the efforts of a few busybodies, the lowest elevation known as a
fool's paradise? Nothing is more surprising than the realisation of the so-called
“National' Wallace Monument, for I have never yet seen or heard of anybody who
: roves of it, except, of course, DR. Rogers. Everybody seems to laugh at and
icule the affair, yet a large sum of money has been scraped together, and the
wonder is not that the amount is small, for even so poor a ... as the Scotch, but
that so much should have been screwed together by a few eager enthusiasts, who
have as much right to be considered representatives of the nation as the three
Tooley Street tailors. It has always been a marvel to me that the good sense of the
#. has not arisen to strangle in its birth this most ridiculous of ridiculous mice.
hero seems to be no one felicitous or redeeming feature in the case—the idea, the
of patriotic
site, the tºº.
a.
hout, all seem equally unhappy. The idea seems on all
hands admitted to
useless mistake, and the localisation of the idea is perhaps
the greatest part of the mistake. To be national, the monument (if monument
there must be) should have been grander in conception, and conducted by more
influential hands-by, a body which really would have represented the Scottish
nation, and not only the Stirling portion of it."
In another article the same unshrinking writer alludes to the cere
monial of the laying the first stone. He speaks of “that magnificent
piece of tomfoolery, the Wallace monument,”
‘‘Begun amidst all the petty festive demonstrations of country masonic lodges
and free ſº. This gigantic mistake and useless commemoration is much
more likely to cause the lion to turn pale that all the sneers of the Times. A noted
denouncer of humbug, whose signature of ‘RANDoLPH' is well kown to readers of
the Scotsman as a sure token of something at once racy, picturesque, and sensible,
suggests that the Wallace Monument should be immediately followed by erections
to the memory of NoAH on Mount Ararat, and of NEBUGHADNEzzAR on the irrigated
meadows near this city | Those personages he conceives to stand in need of com-
memoration as much as WALLACE.”
. And the Scotsman, as even southern readers need hardly be informed,
is the Edinburgh journal which expresses Scottish opinion in the most
reliable manner. Mr. Punch may therefore conclude, first, that he has
completely answered his Correspondents, and concludes, secondly, his
respectful reply by a quotation from a great English poet;-
“Ye Powers wha mak’ mankind your care,
And dish them out their bill of fare,
Auld Scotland wants na skinkling ware.”
In Omne Wolubilis.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GENERALISSIMO OF THE RUSSIAN FORCES.
THE subjoined alarming piece of intelligence is contained in a letter
from Constantinople:—
“I may mention, however, that whilst GENERAL Iowa.TIEFF is thus diplomatising
on the Bosphorus, letters from Jassy report that his colleague in arms, GENERA.
GRAPP, has moved as far down as Skolanga, on the Pruth, with an efficient force of
12,000 men, comprising infantry, cavalry, and artillery.”
Of all the Generals in the Russian, service, the most redoubtable is
GENERAL GRAPH. He is also the oldest. Peter. The Gº, when
he made his celebrated will, ºf. GENERAL GRABB his executor.
It was really GENERALGRABB who directed the operations of the Russian
army, which, crossed the Pruth seven years ago, and the war
which ended in the Crimea. This distinguished veteran was highly
i. by the EMPEROR NICHOLAs, who never took any jū. or
military step without consulting GENERAL GRABB. It is true that
ALEXANDER THE SECOND is reported to be a pacific sovereign, but
knowing what are the traditions of Russian policy, we cannot but
jº. considerable apprehension any movement on the Pruth
which is directed by GENERAL GRABB, whose name is synonymous with
annexation, and the seizure of territory, and everything else that he is
able to lay hold of
A MEDAL FOR THE MUSEUM.
“SPEECH is Silver, but Silence is Golden.” Students, not being
as, a general rule much acquainted with the precious metals, may
not feel the full force of this Oriental saying. ...Yet doth Mr. Punch
recommend his friend MR. PANIzzi to have the line engraven, in
extremely legible characters, upon the tables of the gran ºf
Favilion in the Museum flet it be written upon the screen whic
severs the reader from his opposite neighbour, let the words be so
laced that they shall perpetually Strike the ièye of a talker, thereby
oing what his neighbour, persecuted by chatter, desires to do in
#. er manner, studied in the Alexandrian school—that of ALEC
ED.
Qur Reading Pavilion is a great thing, and a comfort to the literary
soul, and more dear unto it than Young Memnon, or the Splitting
Giraffe, or the Fossil Man, or the Stone Tortoise, or even the Four
Thousand Guinea. Theseus. . The room is a room wherein Mr. Punch
“hath a delight to sit,” for it is “an open room, and good for
winter,” and also for summer. And the lady-readers, now that they
keep themselves to the Quartier Crinoline, and bring not their bright
glances to disturb stern research, are an ornament to the rotunda, and
a softening of the atmosphere thereof., Many more things could Mr.
Punch indite in honour of that delectable abyss of lore, and of him who
boldly and nobly seized the Quadrangle, reversed the problem, Circled
the Square, and fortified the Quadrilateral against all attempts to take
it for mummies, dried fish, moonstones, south-sea island clubs, coal-
lumps, crocodiles, tertiary strata, and other instructive matters, beside
which tired and listless children are .. and drag their weary
little feet, and would gladly babble o' green elds if they were not afraid
of having their ears boxed... But it is not now that Mr. Punch hath to
speakin praise; save by implication, which indeed is the delicatest form
of praise, though the coarse puffing of the present age knoweth it not.
But by St. Cadmus, O. PANIzzi, we must take order with these
chattering Nuisances that infest our temple of study. The complaints
we hear of them are grievous.
Mr. Punch, sitting in one of your easy chairs with the noiseless castors,
hath, perhaps, a dozen books called, as witnesses before him, and he is
busily earing them all, and comparing the evidence of one with another
and noting whether a difference in testimony is material or trivial, an
whether it occur in an early or a late edition, and heeding whether he is
...; testimony of a thoughtful recorder, or only of some slovenly
and slavish compiler, booksellers' hack, and he has to keep his attention
wide awake, lest in making up judgment he mislead the millions who
rely on his acumen and candour. - -
en cometh an inconsiderate Snob (any inconsiderate man is a snob)
and, sitting down, or lounging near one's next neighbour beginneth to
Cackle. Either he doth it with some impudent loudness, as much as to
º “I shall speak if I like,” or with some sm whispering,
which implieth a knowledge of guilt, but a persistence, therein. This
is even more irritating, O PANIzzi, than the louder talk, and .#
lasteth, much longer. And the neighbour, at first vexed, growet
interested, and then an argument comes on, and the paper cutter is
used to enforce points, and s º the books, and the undercurrent of
jabber rusheth overwhelmingly over one's ears, sweeps away, one's
recollections and delicate points, and y washes one up to the
central table, to reclaim one's tickets in a venomous state of mind.
How shall we stop these chattering creatures? Will the inscription
which Mr. Punch has suggested, do for the purpose? No, he fears not
or why do they disregard, O PANIzzi, thy gentlemanly hint tha
“Silence is essential in a place devoted to Study.” We must take
sterner order with these Museum Snobs. Why should their selfishness
make their betters uncomfortable?
So, O PANIzzi, Mr. Punch taketh counsel of the Coi
Department, and lo and behold the º of the Coin and Medal
There ! as QUARLEs says:-
“Is not this type well cut, in every part
Filled with rich cunning, and with Zeuxian art?"
There is a typical yet truthful presentment of the case. There be
the donkeys, that is to say gentlemen, who disturbour º ilion,
and there is Mr. Punch affably inviting, them to desist. Now, dear
PANIzzi, perpend. Have the above stricken as a medal—you have our
unsought, unbought leave to do so—or have it graven in any convenient
way you will, , Let it be called “Punch's Bad Mark”, Attach thereto
a #. which should be, considering the subject, of the colour of the
ribbon of the order of the Thistle. Supply specimens to the courteous
and intelligent gentlemen who attend on us, and do such good service
in the †. #. And be it an instruction to them—one which
they, imbued with the student spirit, will gladly follow out—to notice a
j or to hear complaint of him. And let one of them come
behind such Jabberer, and over his ass's ears pass the ribbon, and in
strictest silence (that the hint be clearer) invest him with the abºye
order—and if he be already in orders, for some of the notorious dis-
turbers of the room are, or seem, parsons, let him be known as the
Vicar of Bray. - - -
One word more. Small wit gibeth at Woman's talk, and would carp
at the Spheres for making kindred music, could small wit hear it. But
such wit would utter falsehood as well as folly did it aim at the Ladies
of the Museum. Mr. Punch watches them narrowly, always indeed
finding it hard to turn away his immortal, eyes, from such sights,
and he hereby maketh it known that They neither talk, nor permit talk.
And, bless 'em, if they did, would he scold? No, but he would have a
finger of HARPoCRATEs, carved in whitest ivory, and he would smilingly
approach the speaker, and gently pressing that ivory upon her corallip
§. present the ornament to her for a brooch, and a memorial §
ove. -
No, it is masculine Chatterers and Jabberers whom Mr. Punch desires
to put down. And mark you, ANTONIo, if the Medal will not do it, Mr.
Punch may waste an hour in making some more easily recognisable
sketches of the criminals. He laughs now, but let them beware of his
“waked wrath.”

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“THE other evening, having a half hour or so to kill before
going to a Fº I did not care to go too early to, I looked in at the
Fº little Gallery of Illustration. To judge by what I saw of it,
he new entertainment goes more briskly than ever, and they who
have not seen it should not lose the chance of doing so before the
season, ends. I know of no place where a pleasant laugh may be
enjoyed more surely whenever you drop in, or where the lover of light
music may hear it done in better taste. With three such excellent
performers as MR. AND MRs. GERMAN REED and MR. PARRY, music
cannot fail to be attractive at the Gallery, and if I may pick out a fault
in the present entertainment, it is that full advantage is not taken of
this fact. Any entertainer can make fun of a smashed bandbox or the
dropping of a tea-tray (which stale stage ways of laugh-moving I think
the British Playgoer would gladly see abolished); but no others that I
know of are so musically gifted, and they who recollect the yoice of
dainty Ariel would gladly hear it less in dialogue and more in solid
SOIlg.
#The Princess's closed last week after a season of success achieved
by Monsieur, HAMLET, who, I hear it whispered, has for some while
since been studying to appear as MossIEUR, QTHELL0 after the recess.
Whether the praise which he has gained while, wearing his light hair
will be extended to him after he has gone and blacked his face, is more
than my prophetic soul can take upon itself to state. But he is far too
gcod an actor to act a good part badly, and though the dark rôle may
not suit him quite so fitly as the light, one, we may be sure that his
will be an intellectual performance, and that he will play the Moor with
careful thought and taste. Doleful º may bewail the declining of
the drama, and declare, there's no love left for aught but farces and
burlesques; but I think it shows good sense is extant still in England
that a single play of SHAKSPEARE's has served to cram, a theatre for
one and seventy nights, and this without the aid of either splendid
scenery, or attested-by-authorities correctness of costume.
* At the Olympic MR. Robson has revived Plot and Passion, and is
delighting people nightly by his careful personation of the wily spy
Desmarez. Did he take the hint from “ONE whq PAys?' I wonder
for a few weeks since I spoke of this as one of his best characters and
one that shows what he can do with a part which in less able hands
might have but slight effect. I think that his dramatic power is better
shown in §: like this, than in his wilder freaks of acting in fast high-
pressure burlesque.
“ONE WIIo PAYs.”
CHANCERY IS THE BEST MOTHER FOR LEGAL ORPHANS.
Or seventy-five lawyers who died in 1858, the Registrar-General tells
us that “fifteen died without making their wills.” We are positive
that this was not neglect, or arising from any cowardly fear lest the
execution of the act should hasten their exit from this world, or from
any other mean cause; but simply sprang from the benevolent desire
to avoid litigation, by nobly ºn: to get a brother confederate to
draw up their will, and still more nobly refusing to draw it up them-
selves. Their experience evidently º them, that it was safer to
leave *wº to chance than leaving it in the hands of the
lawyers. e should like, as a great consolation, to know how much
of the property of , those fifteen lawyers who died intestate was
eventually swallowed up by the Law. The Law is a savage Saturn,
and frequently devours its own children.
A White Fib.
ANTI-PRESIDENT_JEFF. DAVIs, in his last Message to the Secession
Congress, asserts that the Confederate States took up arms in defence
of their liberties. JEFF. Davis takes great liberties, with language.
The fact is, that they rebelled in defence of their slaveries. ANTI-PRE-
SIDENT DAVIS appears to be a man who really would not hesitate to
swear that black is white.

THE GAME OF CROSSING THE RHINE.
N Wednesday last week a
Nº -
Y. very pretty game of soldiers
f. N- was played on the Rhine at
Wr --~... Strasbourg. The 6th Regi-
- - - ment of Pontonnier #.
º . lery, under the inspection of
/ GENERAL SEVELINGEs, per-
formed the amusing experi-
º
- ^ ment of throwing a bridge
/y º, of boats across that river.
º It was as good as a play.
… Our informant, the Times’
.." Z. Paris Correspondent, tells
-- -
~) us that—
“A number of distinguished
persons who were invited to
* witness the operation were ac-
commodated with seats on a
stage erected for the occasion.
The bridge was composed of 40
boats, and measured 240 yards
in length. It was completely
fixed in 45 minutes with a ra-
pidity seldom equalled.”
What a highly diverting
3- º for the people on
the right side of the river,
the right side being understood to be the stronger side, the side that
Is ; because it has might, but physically called the left side of the
Rhine ! GENERAL SEVELINGEs # his merry men of the 6th Artillery
Pontonniers threw a bridge of boats over the water from Strasbourg to
Kehl only for fun, as schoolboys say. He had no idea at the same time
of showing the Baden folks how soon the thing could be done in earnest.
*...*
They comprehended all this, and accordingly behaved with the utmost
politeness towards their military visitors:-
“As soon as the bridge was completed, GENERALs SEVELINGFs and BARGELLA,
Colonel Berckheim, and several of the persons invited, crossed the river to the
Baden side, where they were received by BARon WELLER, Commander of the fort
of Kehl, and by the corps of officers.”
They were received in the same playful spirit as that in which they
came :-
“The Baden troops formed a line, and presented arms as the French Generals
and their suite passed.”
The presentation of arms on the part of the Baden troops was evi-
dently intended to intimate that they took the mock invasion of their
country as a capital joke. Qf course they presented their arms at their
French friends by levelling them at their heads, with the facetious feint of
going to fire at them as enemies. Not, however, that they meant to signify
that under the real circumstances then represented they would ever
dream of doing any such thing. The game of invasion would be one
too serious, to play with forces, who were likely to resist, an actual
attack. The operation of bridging the Channel with iron-plated
steamers, so as to render the landing of French troops possible on the
Kentish coast, is not one which our neighbours would be likely to per-
form in sport. Should they, however, think É. to indulge in such a
frolic, they would probably receive an intimation that we, in our ins
dulness, do not understand jokes of that kind. No doubt, if they came
after that, they would be received with all martial honours; but those
honours would be naval and not military in the first instance. A
Channel Fleet (if there . ened to exist one) would present arms to
them; but those arms wo § be chiefly Armstrong guns, shotted, and
there is too much reason to apprehend that they would go off. The
spree or lark of a descent on the shore of England would not, proceed
and terminate so º as that of crossing the Rhine; which having
been accomplished in the manner above described:–
“The bridge of boats was left open to the public for above half an hour, and the
small town of Kehl was crowded with French soldiers of all arms. Though the
crowd was immense, no accident occurred.”
It is to be apprehended that any sort of bridge, thrown, how jocu-
ly soever, across the Channel, would not remain open a minute
longer than the time wherein the British naval force could demolish it;
and if the small town of Dover were crowded with French soldiers of
all arms, it would be our fault or our misfortune that they had not all
of them been disarmed. Accidents perhaps, properly so called, would
not occur in the case supposed, because the artillery, which as aforesaid,
would go off, would not go off accidentally... On the other hand, our
lively neighbours, with all their mirth, and all their good nature, would
be equally apt to misunderstand and resent such a piece of practical
fun on our part as the rehearsal of a hostile movement on Calais or
Boulogne. Games of this kind are yery apt to end in quarrels, and
when acted even on a small scale, unpleasantly affect the apprehensions
of bystanders, Our gallant allies would create the less alarm in Europe
if they would be content to practise pontooning on rivers of their own,
and not play at crossing the Rhine.

Where yesterday we ran, to-day we lie. gh,
FOURTH FACE.
(BY A YANKEE NOTION-Monger.)
Qur Hoºks's Yankee Lock henceforth the field,
To our M'Dowell's Yankee bolt must yield.
NOT A BAD COMMISSION.
ThERE. must be one person who has good reason to rejoice in the
absence of the QUEEN on all Parliamentary solemnities, and that is the
LORD CHANCELLOR, who, we are informed by the papers, receives £500
every time he 8. Parliament, and the same infor opening the
Houses, “by Commission.” The above are not bad fees, though we
cannot help fancying that many persons might be found who would
undertake to do the same sort of thing much more cheaply." For
instance, we are positive that our old friend JoHN Cooper would be
happy to É. through the Pºlº on any occasion for a ten-pound
note; and more than that, he would add considerably to the effect by
rounding the periods in ºf . inflated way peculiar only to prac.
tical elogutionists. We will be bound that the QUEEN’s Speech would
be read in such a style as it had never been heard before What can the
LORD ChancELLOR know about elocution? Besides, only look at the
economy, of the thing. Supposing, now, that John Cooper was
engaged to open and close Parliament at the rate of £10 for each cere.
mony, there would be a clear gain to the nation of £980 a-year.
Moreover, we would guarantee that, as often as painfully necessary,
J9HN would not mind composing a graceful apology for the absence of
ular |HER MAJESTY, and that he would not charge an extra penny for it,
His many years' practice of appearing at the footlights with his hand
upon his heart, and entreating the indulgence of his kyind friends,”
wºuld recommend him of all others for this particular duty. We will
willingly bet one year's entire income, if there is any Rothschild rich
enough to deposit so large a stake, that if the admired representative
of the Ghost in Hamlet were to read the QUEEN's Speech, he would
draw a much larger House than the LoRD CHANgELLOR.
In addition, it is our opinion that there should be some difference
between the payment of the two sums for the two different operations.
At present there, is a shameful equality between the two which we
cannot help condemning as a most disgraceful disproportion. We
would .# pay the IORD CHANCELLOR any sum, no matter how large,
for closing Parliament, but then on the other handwe would j.
him the smallest possible coin for opening it. . In fact, it is a great
hº whether he ought not himself to pay us for the latter ceremony.
t is so great an offence that he could not be fined too heavily for it.
A Disclaimer.
IN a capital article on “Scottish Character” in the new number of
the Quarterly, quotation of an Aberdonian retort is made, with the
remark, “Punch translates this “Do you want to argue, }. beggar?’”
Mr. Punch begs to say that he never translates * ing, and may
rhaps be therefore reproached with want of humanity to the
ioceses of some of SHAFTESBURY's bishops.

FOR THE CHICKS.
STEAM WANTED AT THE ADMIRALTY.
The French have eleven iron-cased frigates afloat or in commission
and no less than seventeen #.". and yet the only iron vess
belonging to this country will not be at sea before October. The
Admiralty is not only slow in giving its orders, but equally slow in
executing them. They have just asked from certain firms for tenders
for three more iron ships; and yet (says the Times), “the Admiralty
has not now any information with reference to iron, ships which they
had not at the least as fully this time last year.” In the same day's
aper from which the above extract, is taken, there is a report of MR.
§ AMANT, the well-known Chess-player, who has ºed in fixing
a maximum of time for the moves in Chess. A gigantic sand-glass,
which is made to measure the space of two hours, is placed by the side
of each antagonist. While the sand is º through, the player is
bound to make twenty-four moves. We are informed that the trial of
this limit has been most satisfactory. -
Why should not the experiment that has proved so successful, with
the Chess-board!be tried also with the Board of Admiralty? We should
like the maximum of time to be fixed for all their moves. At present
they are so dilatory, that the patience of the lookers-on is well nigh
exhausted. Their riyal, who no sooner concerts a new move than he
boldly executes it, is quietly winning the game right, under, their
mantical noses. Where he has got seventeen pieces on his sea-board,
we have scarcely got one. Some limit ought to be fixed. Let it be Th
two, three, four years, if you like, only let it be strictly adhered to; or,
upon the first violation of the rule, let the º slow unequal players
withdraw from the board. It is deplorable to see the French beating
us with their scientific play, and outstripping us in every new invention
by the speed and dexterity of all their movements.
A Fast Race.
THE Yankees have long been extremely fond of boasting that they
are by far the most go-ahead of nations; and after hearing how they
went a-head in running from Bull's Run, we cannot well dispute there
being some ground for their boast.
SLEEPERS THAT ARE SURE TO PUT THEIR BOOTS
OUTSIDE.
In a trial that was heard at Wells, it came out on evidence that
there “were 500 out of 1000 farmers in Somersetshire who went to
sleep on horseback.” We have heard of sleep-walkers, but sleep-
riding is quite a new habit. We should have thought, too, that this
strange custom of sleeping...would have been more prevalent in Beds
than in Somersetshire, We should be sorry to practise it ourselves,
lest we should eventually fall (and the fall might not be a very
able º the victim to a nightmare. We always thought, that there
was not less difficulty experienced in catching a Somersetshire farmer
asleep than there proverbially is with a weasel. º it is on
account of his being so uncommonly wide awake during the day that
he cannot afford to wait until bedtime, before he closes his sleepy eyes.
Let us hope, for their own safety, that whilst they are in the saddle
they contrive to sleep fast. Since these Somersetshire farmers are so
fond of sleeping on horseback, we wonder they do not engage four
posters at once.
The Run upon Washington.
THE defeat of the Federalist forces at Bull's Run will, it is said, lead
to a change of the name of the rivulet so heretofore denominated.
19se who are º: to boast that they whipped BULL have now been
whipped themselves. BULL's Run that was, therefore, we understand,
is henceforth to be called JonATHAN's Run.
Protection for Passengers.
THE Duke of York's Column and the Monument on Fish Street Hill
are disfigured by cages surrounding their summits, and put there to
Fº from jumping off them. . It is a pity, that want of
space hinders the object in view from being as effectually secured by
the erection of railings around the bases of the monuments, sufficiently
extensive to keep #. from being tumbled upon by any fool who
happened to throw himself over.

AUNT. “Willy, my Dear Child, you must be fatigued with Digging your Garden, I'm sure.
WILLY. “Oh, Aunt, please, I should like to have some BeER / "
OF LABOUR.
What would you like to do now f"
THE CRICKETER'S LOSS AND GAIN.
To MR. ALDERMAN GUTCH.
MY DEAR ALDERMAN,
THE following paragraph appeared in the Post on Tuesday
last week:-
“THE WEATHER.—Yesterday the thermometer registered in the streets of the
Metropolis 110° Fahr. in the sun, or 85° Reaumur, or from 95° to 97" Fahr. in
the shade, a heat almost unprecedented in this country; whilst at the Royal
Humane Society's receiving-house, Hyde Park, and other similarly exposed situa-
tions, the instrument at noonday recorded 119°Fahr.”
In the same paper, Sir, on the same day, was published a report of a
cricket-match between the “Fourteen of Kent and All England” which
had come off on the day before at Canterbury. It began with the
remark that “This day was everything favourable for cricket, the sun
shining brilliantly,” which was followed by a description of the play
that took place under that same brilliant sun. *::::::g to this
astonishing narrative, after some hours of violent exercise:—
“The batmen now made runs quickly, and they remained in till the dinner-bell
rang, when GooDHEw had marked 35, and MR. KElson 21. The ground, which was
rather thinly attended at first, now became thronged. After the repast MR. KEL-
son and GooDHEw resumed the batting, HAyward and GRUNDY bowling.”
What did MRs. GRUNDy say? What does your worship say to the idea
of not only º: at cricket at a temperature of nineteen degrees above
blood-heat, but also of going and sitting down to dinner, eating and
drinking with a cricketer's appetite, and then getting up again and
Fº on a full stomach; a stomach so full as such an appetite must
have rendered it? Surely, Sir, one would think that apoplexy must be
a chimera, and coup-de-soleil in fact mere moonshine. Bless your soul,
Sir! fancy yourself, in the glare of a sun almost hot enough to broil a
steak, running backwards and forwards and jolting up the contents of
an interior distended with fluids and solids, ingested under compulsion
of ravenous hunger and raging thirst. The bare imagination of such
unseasonable exercise must affect you with vertigo. Your brain,
doubtless, reels to think of it.
The great evaporation which, during a game of cricket at 119°
Fahr., must go on from the skin, no doubt considerably relieves
the player from sensations both of heat and fulness, But whereas
cricketers F. so copiously as they do, how can it be that they are
so fat as they generally are? That their obesity is a fact is, demon-
strated by most of the photographs of their chief celebrities, which are
exhibited in the shop windows. ...If you want to fatten a pig you not
only stuff him, but keep him still. Your own corpulence is likewise
owing as well to sedentary habits as to excessive, alimentation... But
the cricketer violates one of the conditions of which the combination is
generally requisite to constitute, an abdominal convexity. He takes
tremendous exercise attended with immense depletion. The only sup:
position by which his bulk can be accounted for is, that much of
substance as he loses, still more does he take in. Then how much that
must be? If you and your brethren would forswear bodily inaction,
and addict yourselves to cricket, you would probably consume even
more than you do, and the customary 250 tureens of real turtle would
not perhaps half suffice for the dinner on Lord Mayor's Day. Would
it not, then, be advisable to establish a Lord Mayor's Ground to serve
as a Lord's Ground for the City, so that the Aldermen and Common
Councilmen, and the rest of the Čivic dignitaries might fº and play
cricket there, thus earning an appetite the result of which will be the
still further º of your already immense corporation?
I have the honour to be, my dear Alderman, your worship's ever
welcome and willing guest,
490Aſ, CIÉ.
P.S., Excellent sauce as cricket seems to be, it has the great advan-
tage of not conducing to gout like some other condiments, whilst,
considered as a stomachic, it is more efficacious, as well as more
salutary than any “Alderman's Mixture.”

Mason, floored, made “the sign of distress,” but a
brother with a bayonet declined to recognise the intima-
tion, and incontinently dismissed, the other “from
labour to repose.” Probably this would not, have
happened under the Presidentship of “the judicious

FOENUM HABET IN CORNU.
THE grand Italian Exhibition about to be held at
Florence, will comprise, it is officially stated, a show
of Cattle from all parts of the Peninsula. Mr. Punch
wonders whether it will contain a specimen of a mon;
jº, happily about to become extinct—the Papal
TEAREMPS LAST.
Dog TEAREM has once or twice of late been barking in such a key
that his voice has been mistaken for that of a turnspit, or some yet
more ignoble animal of the canine species. TEAREM has now and then
been seen very busy with his tongue, apparently jºi strange boots.
At least, however, TEAREM has § asserted his breed. On the
occasion of the ARCHDUKE FERDINAND-MAXIMILIAN's late, visit to
Southampton, MR. Roebuck, at the Victoria Assembly Rooms, is
reported to have spoken the following words with reference to the
EMPEROR of AUSTRIA:—
“I honour that great monarch who, from his high mountain, has seen that there
are things below him worthy of regard, and who has made the people the partici-
pants of his power. I believe the English ºf. and entirely appreciate
the value of what the EMPERoR of Austria been doing. It has been growing
slowly upon them, and I think that the people of England at this hour believe they
understand what he is doing. He has not attempted to make one party superior to
another; he has not attempted to make one part of his great dominions superior to
another; but he has attempted to give all alike a constitutional government.”
Now, at first sight, or hearing, this, specimen of TEAREM's bark,
would convey the erroneous impression that TEAREM, instead of being
a staunch rough terrier, was a parlour spaniel. But, on consideration
it will be seen that in opening his mouth to pronounce the above quote
#. TEAREM not only barked, but also bit, and that severely.
TEAREM's oulogy of that “great monarch” to whom he alluded was,
in fact, a piece of biting satire. TEAREM knows under whose rule
Venetia groans, and under the scourges of whose hangmen ladies have
bled. Tear EM is fully aware of the circumstances under which the
sovereign whom he ironically slavered, granted a constitutional govern-
ment to his subjects; the circumstances of a thorough defeat just suf.
fered, and the imminent º of his empire. TEAREM, attached to
his own bone, knew what to think of that prince who is trying to take
away the Diet of others. TEAREM knew also that he was speaking to
the people of Southampton, whose ears once, when ANDREws was
Mayor, within the memory of boy, resounded with each other's accla-
mations of KossuTH, whom they were the first to welcome to the shores
of England. They, he was sure, would understand the hyperbole of his
mock sycophantic bark, and well enough perceive that TEAREM was
only pretending to be LicKEM, and was really vindicating his breed and
name by tearing 'em to pieces.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
METEORS FOR THE MILLION.
ITH great fitness (as
Punch is very emi-
tº a scientific
journal), a letter has
een sent us by an
eminent astronomer,
begging us to keep a
sharp look-out forme-
teors, and to help him
in recording their po-
sition and appearance.
That the instructions
which he gives us are
as luminous as, the
bodies he requests us
to observe, the ex-
tract we append here
will supply abundant
proof:-
“Let a smooth tree or
firm erect post, 5 or 5
inches thick, be selected
and the ground made leve
about it. The observer,
provided with a piece of
chalk, will embrace th;
tree with his clasped
hands at full arm's length,
the head and body being
held erect. At the appear-
ance of a Meteor, the body
will be swung about until
the bole of the tree or post
intersects upon the hea-
vens the central point of
the Meteor's path, and
there, without deranging
body or eye, he will chalk
at the centre of the tree's
face a small figure (1), and
note at once opposite to a
similar number in a book
or form of registry the
hour of animaginary clock-dial, towards which the Meteor might be judged to have shot from the centre out-
wards, 12 o'clock being imagined at the top of the post.”
If it do no other good, obedience to these orders will at least afford good exercise, and as
this will be taken in the evening after dinner, doubtless many scientific digestions, will be
helped by it. We can conceive a Fº star-gazer clasping a tree “at full arm’s length,” and
at º stomach's distance also, and swinging about his !. every time he sees a meteor, until
the bole of the tree crosses the meteoric path. As for bidding him do this “without deranging
body or eye,” one might as reasonably expect him not to whisk about his coat tails, ºr to
crumple his cravat. Derangement not alone of dress and body, but of mind would be likely
to ensue to any corpulent observer, who should attempt to practise the agile feats required
of him, and at the same time to inspect “an imaginary clock-dial,” besides taking out his
ocket-book to register the hour, and chalking a small figure “at the centre of the tree's
ace.”. What the tree's face may be, we leave him to conjecture, and also how he will, per-
form the varied manual work required of him, while all the time embracing the tree with his
clasped hands. Nor are those webave recorded the only tasks expected of him, for-
“To this note he will add the time by a common pocket watch, with the letter (m) meteor, if the star be
attended by a tail: but if the star be tailless, the letters (s) or (f) according as the motion of the star isjudged
slow or fast. In the case of the appearances (m), brief notes of the star's º may be recorded; but in
the case of tailless stars, the letters a 32°, to denote descending magnitudes of them (like & Lyrae, the stars
of the Wain, the 2 side stars of the Coss, the 5 stars of the Dolphin, &c. for standards,) and a bic, to denote
the length of flight in steps of 10° and under, will, with accurate records of the times of observation, suffice
in most cases to identify the bodies. The same process will be repeated with all the successive meteors, 2,
3, 4, that appear within the hour of observation."
After the observer has obeyed all these directions, which are so vastly clear and lucid that *
word of tiºn would be needless and impertinent, the meteoric nightwatch is to be
concluded thus:-
“A ‘horizon circle" should now be drawn about the stem, where it is cut by the horizonline of the observer;
and a ‘south line' erected vertically to this upon the south face of the trunk, by clasping the stem as in
a meteor observation, and observing the north star at any time when it can be seen. The distance of the
observer's eye from this horizon circle, when standing erectat arm's length clasping the tree, is to be measured
with a tape, and likewise the circumference of the circle itself, while to the apprº riate numbers in the book,
are to be appended the tape measures of ‘Height above the Horizon Circle" and ‘Distance Eastward from
the South-line" of every figure chalked upon the stem of the tree."
º as the orders we have quoted, may appear, they are nevertheless by no means so
complete as we could wish; for no mention is made of what observers are to do in case a
meteor falls behind them, nor is it said if to corroborate their scientific evidence they must
º the tree or post by which they made their observations, and send it to the savant to
whom they send their notes. There is enough, however, said to show how people who are
blest with scientific minds may enjoy an economical and pleasant evening's recreation, bystick-
*i; a linen pole in the middle of their grass plat, and taking sights at any meteors at the
risk of taking cold. There is likewise the further risk of their mistaking for a meteor the
bull's-eye of a policeman, who might be upon his rounds and inspecting their back premises, at
the time when their nocturnal star-gazing takes place. Such accidents may happen to most
scientific persons, especially at eventide and after a good dinner, when their vision, if not
double, is not the most distinct.
LINES ON THE AMERICAN LOAN.
How enviable that man's lot
From need to labour free,
A heavy mortgage who has got

No daily cares his bosom vex,
His sleep is sound and sweet,

Of making both ends meet.
Hard earnings not obliged to hoard

That happy mortal can afford
An Income-Tax to pay.
Not such men Schedule D deprives
Of what they should lay by .
For helpless age, or leave their wives
And children when they die.
I wish I had a certain sum,
That money to invest,
And live on means derived therefrom;
Usurious interest.
For then no more Iforced should be

Should others have to work for me,
And live but to enjoy.

To tempt me with a Loan.
Though she should offer seven percent.

CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.
CALL a spade a spade; but, according to a contemporary review, the
author of a book about Rome, intitled Roman Candles, calls a strait
waistcoat a “waistcoat that is not crooked.” Surely this gentleman
should be put into a strait waistcoat himself. He would then learn
that a strait waistcoat is no straighter than any other waistcoat, and
unless content with calling a strait waistcoat a strait waistcoat, would
Fº describe it as a waistcoat that is not wide, but narrow. To
the “high, priests or cardinals” the same writer applies the name of
“flamina.” He * intend a very subtle joke at the expense of the
high priests, one that an extremely venturous, ancient man wag
might perhaps be conceived to have taken the liberty of cracking on a
clergy such as that of CYBELE. Possibly he may be aware that
a.puff of wind, and flamen a high priest, are noun-substantives of
different genders. If so he is one of those persons whose Latin scholar-
ship is greater than their knowledge of English.
NO JOKE.
Caution to Hotel-Keepers and Others.
We have received information to-day that, a shabby, plausible
vagabond is, touring about under the assumed name of one of our
artist contributors, and victimising divers Hotel Proprietors. We
trust the following letter may check his proceedings:-
“SIR, “White Hart Hotel, Lewes, August 12.
“On last Monday a gentleman came to the above Hotel, took luncheon,
and entered into conversation with other gentlemen, casually stating that he was
the artist for Punch. . He afterwards took a Sketch of the County
Hall, which he showed to some visitors, and said in a fortnight it would appear
in §. He then ordered dinner, for two at half-past six on the following day,
and said he should want a bed. Being Race time, I could not accommodate him
with the latter, but on 3.3 I provided the Dinner. He ordered Fried Soles,
Cutlets and Ham, and a Sweet Omelette: he came to his time alone, his friend not
having arrived, and sitting in the Coffee-room, made himself very familiar, and
was evidently an educated man; in fact, three or four gentlemen known to me
came into the Bar, and asked who he was, he was such a clever fellow. I told
them - , from Punch. ... Some Champagne was had, he having to pay for
one bottle. We were very busy the last day of the Races, so MR. — slipped
off, and we have not seen him since. He had on Monday Pale Ale and Biscuits,
change for sixpence (the sixpence he told the Barmaid to charge in his bill); on
Tu y, Sherry and Bitters, Dinner and ºr. I must confess I felt sus-
picious, his boots being very bad, and his general appearance not quite up to the
mark. A plaid cap and round frock were his principal attire; but as I have fre-
quently visitors of rank who are not particular in dress, and genius is often
eccentric, I did not *}. so much attention to his a pººl. seeing he had nice
white hands, and that he could sketch and talk well. I have since heard from a
MR. R.—, of London, that the real — is a quiet

others might be taken in who would be proud to entertain any of the Punc
staff, and it is too bad for such a rascal to go through the country with — 's

“LADIEs’ LIGHT DREsses.”—From the frequency with which it
takes fire, we should say that Crinoline was entitled to be called, par
excellence, “The Lady's Light Dress.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHALLENGE.
“MR. PUNCH's excellent joke about MR. GLADston E and the Irre-
moveable Poor Bill reminds us—” - -
Ha! There, is an audacity which becomes sublimity, and it occurs
to Mr. Punch that it has been reached by the individual who, after a
}.} of similar Sells, has dared to venture º an allusion to Mr.
Punch, as bait for a trap--as the means of leading the public into the
perusal of an Advertisement of a-
No, you don’t.
You are a smart man, offspring of BENJAMIN, and manufacturer of
what 3. call the best and most perfect—
Sold again, MR. B.
But, really, when you introduce the clarum et venerabile nomen of Mr.
Punch into your advertisements, you ought to do it more respectfully.
Mr. Punch’s “excellent” joke! How dare you particularise? Which
of his jokes is not excellent? And, moreover, he never jokes at all.
He sometimes enfolds a slice of wisdom between layers of sugared irony,
but if you think that when in his wildest mood he flings a jest you
have nothing but a jest, you are in a state which demands his com-
passion. , You swallow a moral in every jujube, and if it does not do
you good, you are past physic, and º etter think about deciding
etween the cemeteries.
Nevertheless, as there is some ingenuity about your Sells, and once
or twice they have made Mr. Punch smile, he presents you with some
suggestions. Did you ever hear of VIRGIL? He was a Latin poet.
He wrote some verses. Somebody else claimed them, and was rewarded
by an Illustrious Patron. VIRGIL, incensed, wrote the beginnings of
four lines, thus:-
“Sic vos non-vobis—
Sic vos non vobis—
Sic vos non vobis—
Sic vos non vobis—”
These he sent to the Liberal Patron, who requested the Impostor to
finish them. Imposfor couldn't, and was kicked. Here are four
beginnings of Puffs for you. Let us see whether you can finish them.
If you cannot, and moreover cannot do it with neatness, we retract the
condonation of your offence, and purpose upon the earliest occasion, to
inflict such a terrific castigation as-never mind. -
Now “take off your coat, and roll up your sleeve,” and try at this.
“ALFRED TENNyson has exquisitely commemorated the enchantment by which
Merlin was rendered powerless through arts which himself had taught to the wily
Vivien. Some day, perhaps, the Laureate will embalm the beautiful moral in the
Story of Thomas the Rhymer, who was carried to Fairy Land, and remained there for
a time which he supposed to be seven hours, but which was in reality seven years.
As the great magician of our own time, Mr. Punch, observes, Thomas must have
slepton one of those banks on which the wild time grows. But —."
And at this, -
“ONE of the Best American stories is that of the boy who was always being
scolded by his father, and who, being roughly ordered to go out and fetchalog for
the fire, went away altogether. Returning, a full-grown and powerful man, to visit
his parents, he recollected the circumstances under which he had left his home. He
heaved up a huge piece of timber that was lying near, opened the farm-house door,
and beheld his father and mother in their old corners. “I’ve brought the wood,
father," he said. The calm parent looked at him for a moment, and replied, “Well,
you've been a darmed long time about it, and now put it down, and eat your
supper.' Now —.”
And at this, -
“Action, action, action, was the Greek orator's rule for a young speaker who
desired to produce an effect on his audience. According to historians, some of the
orators of ancient days carried this rule to such excess as to walk up and down
while they spoke, and a speaker of this kind was tauntingly asked by the Athenian
Mr. Punch, “How many miles have you declaimed to-day?" One—”
And lastly, at this:—
“SIR. G. C. Lewis, the new Secretary for War, has ruthlessly demolished many of
the fictions of º; We know not whether he places any faith in the charming
story of the frien º of Damon and Pythias, but we should be sorry to lose our
own belief in that delightful tale. From our youth we have enjoyed the noble
devotion of the young Greek who offered himself hostage for his friend, and who,
when the time appointed arrived, but not the friend, went calmly forth to die for
him. The last moments; the youth kneeling for the blow; the shout of the crowd,
the horseman spurring madly on; the spring of Damon upon the scaffold, the
repentance of the tyrant-are things we would not willingly let die. Still, if Sir
Geonor—”
Now, Sir, VIRGIL has written. Finish, or you are an Impostor, and
by the Nine Gods, shall be told so.
A Home Question.
In the return of “Home-made Spirits” lately issued by the Govern-
ment, we can no mention made of the spirits which last summer
were “summoned from the vasty deep” by shallow-pated spirit-rappers,
and which, as Mº. Howe the medium was generally present to assist
the manufacture of the spiritual intercourse, mayfairly be included in
the list of Hoy E-made spirits. It maybe that these Spirits were left out
of the return, because they have never fairly come up to proper proof.
\
HOW THREE FISHERS WENT SALERING.
THREE Mothers sat talking who lived at the West—
The West end—as that eldest son went down,
Each thought him the husband that she liked the best,
For the girl who had watched him all over the Town.
For men must pay or women will weep—
And their dress is expensive, and many to keep,
And their Mothers are always wo-o-ning.
Three gentlemen lounged at their club-house door,
And they, thought of those girls as the funds went down;
They thought of their bankers and thought them abore,
And of bills that came rolling in “ragged and brown.”
But men must pay or women will weep-
Tº debts be pressing—still Mothers are deep,
And keep up a constant wo-o-ning.
Three gentlemen lay in three separate cells—
The last season’s “necessities” pulled them down—
And the women are weeping and ringing their bells,
For those who will never more show upon Town,
or men must pay or women will weep,
And the soºner you do it the sooner you’ll sleep,
And goodbye to the Ma’and herwo-o-nings.

“I am aware that in imputing the faintest tinge of fault, to our
gallant Volunteers, I may be mistaken for an idiot who thinks ill of the
movement, and is glad of the least chance to throw cold water and gon-
tempt on it. But on the contrary, en masse, I much admire the Volun-
teers, and, seeing that they save us from much military outlay, as a
taxpayer itrust they will increase and flourish. It is precisely to this
end that I think such silly freaks as firing rifles on, a railroadought to
be exposed for public condemnation, and if I had my way the delin-
quents should forthwith be drummed out of the ranks...Surely, after a
review, every cartridge pouch should be examined by the serjeants, to
see that all the rounds served out have been expended, and, if not, to
see the surplus received back into Store. And surely Volunteers should
know better when off duty than in any way to make themselves *
nuisance to the public and a disgrace to their corps. Such freaks as I
have mentioned rob the movement of its dignity, and tend to bring it
sadly into disrepute. Except in educated circles the word 'distinguº
is in England but very slightly known: and it is too bad that the
Volunteers should sink in public estimauch, because a few Gorillas

(which I saw done at Beccles on º the 8th instant), this perhaps may be a custom of
the county, for Suffolk has proverbially the epithet of ‘silly, and its fitness to be called so
is by such freaks amply proved. Not being of a speculative turn of disposition, I have never
held a share in the Eastern Counties Railway; by which investment, I have heard, enormous
wealth may be amassed. But if I were a shareholder I should certainly take care to inquire
at the next meeting what effect, the sparks from fireworks had on first class carriage-linings,
and what per-centage of the public would like a squib-and-cracker carriage attached to every
train. I have no wish to deprive people of sensible amusements, and if the sports 1 have
described are held to come within that category, I think that they who like them should
have full leave to enjoy them. But there are proper times for all things, and one person's
recreation must not be another’s nuisance. So if a man can't travel half-a-dozen miles by

A LECTURE ON MNEMONICS.
THERE is an invention called Mnemonics. It is intended to muddle
the memory under pretext of assisting it. A person, who cannot
remember three figures, say 642, is told to think of the “Sikhs,” and
their great, “fortitu’de in the last war... Mr. Punch has not much
respect for this invention, and rather less for anybody who requires it.
If a person gives #. er and undivided attention to a statement, he can
remember it. Nobody forgets anything in which he is really interested.
He only wants “waking up,” just like his friend who pretends not to
hear you the first time you speak, and always makes you repeat your
question. Notice him in the presence of his superior, or of somebody
whom he wants to serve him. He can hear fast enough then. Memory
can “wake up” in similar fashion. , One's wife often forgets what one
has told her about the National Debt, but does she ever forget the day
for LADY SUSAN’s party? -- - -
The other night Mr. Punch was unluckily in º with one of
the Professors, of Mnemonics, who wished, naturally, to distinguish
himself under the eyes of the Immortal. Affable in manner as colossal
in intellect, Mr. Punch assented to an experiment. The following
conversation ensued:— - -

MAJoR ALDERSHOT RETURNING FROM PARADE, FLATTERS HIMSELF THAT HIS RAT-TAILED CHARGER IS MUCH ADMIRED SINCE THE SADDLER
HAs SUPPLIED HIM WITH A NEw TAIL!
ALLEGED SUICIDE OF THE POPE.
The truthful PAUL CULLEN, titular, Archbishop of Dublin, in a
pastoral as romantic as usual, lately addressed to his flock of simple
Arcadians, pronounces the subjoined panegyric on “Our beloved Holy
Father, PIUs THE NINTH: ”—
“Though violently assailed by the enemies of God and religion, he steers with a
firm hand the bark of Peter. hilst other princes and statesmen present a lament-
able picture of weakness or perfidy, and are tossed about like fragile reeds, he
upholds the principle of eternal justice and the rights of the Church and of society
with undaunted courage, at the same time ºft." world by his meekness, his
humility, his fortitude, and all the other virtues which adorn Christ's vicar on earth;
What a happiness that God has given to his Church so holy a pontiff to guide and
direct her in these troubled times 1"
We are informed that the º: of eternal justice, and the rights
of the Church and Society, have been upheld by the Pope with un-
daunted courage, whilst, at the same time he has edified the world by
his meekness and humility, in ordering FATHER GIACOMO, Count
CAvour’s Confessor, into the custody of the Inquisition. FATHER
GLACOMO went to Rome at the Pope’s summons, to give his Holiness
some account of CAvogº's last moments, and the Court of Rome is
said to have committed him for examination by the Holy Office, either
because he refused to acknowledge that he had improperly given
Count CAvour, absolution, without having first obtained from him a
retractation of his political opinions, or because he declined to break
the seal of confession. The Papal Court is also reported to have
deprived FATHER GIACOMO, now liberated, of his benefice. If these
statements are true, they are additional confirmations, if any additional
confirmation were needed, of the truth as it is in CULLEN.
But, surely, they can hardly be truer than the marvels related in the
Lipes of the Saints, or in the autobiography, of Baron Munchausen,
They are too bad to be true. The Pope, indeed, exemplified his idea of
the principle of eternal justice by refusing to surrender MoRTARA the
kidnapped little Jew. But then his Holiness confounded his notion of
eternal justice with his conception of the rights of the Church. His
s ...] ersonality commanded his temporal personality to retain the
e ...] Israelite. But in placing FATHER GIACOMO under arrest,
particularly if for refusing to divulge the secrets of the Confessional,
the temporal half of the Sovereign Pontiff would have urged his
spiritual moiety to the commission of sacrilege and persecution against
a faithful priest. It is difficult to suppose him capable of making a
Father,Confessor a Confessor to the Tribunal of Penance. Such an act
would be suicidal. The temporal ruler would cut, the spiritual ruler's
throat. No one doubts that Pio NoNobelieves in the Church which
he governs, and by the profanation and injustice of which he is accused,
he would, in doing for himself and his supremacy, have effectually
knocked that Church on the head.
Besides, FATHER GIACOMO is the subject of WICTOR-EMMANUEL.
His detention would have been a casus belli. Is it possible that the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENch would protect the Pope in such an out-
rage as that upon the King and nation of Italy, and the Roman Catholic
Church itself to boot ? No, no, What DR. CULLEN says must gene-
rally be reversed in order to be believed, but let us hope that the
character which, in the above Tºº from his pastoral, is ascribed
to his Holiness, is not quite to be understood in so completel ºpposite
a 'sense as it ought to be if the Pope has really arraigned FATHER
GLACOMO, and punished him for firin absolution to a dying penitent,
or refusing to º upon his shrift. #. he been guilty of such con-
duct as that, NAPOLEoN would tell Goyon to remove the bayonets
on which (with St. Peter's cushion intervening) the Holy Father is
now hoisted; and the consequence would be ridiculous and painful.

SANITARY JUSTICE TO SCOTLAND.
IN an º: of the Registrar General’s Report about the popu-
lation of Scotland, the health of that part of Great Britain is described
as having, been generally good during the past quarter. The diseases
named as having been most prevalent are scarlatina, diphtheria, and in
some places, typhus. Among them vulgar prejudice will learn with
astonishment, there is not enumerated one case of simply cutaneous
disease, that is to say, of cutaneous disease which is merely local and
unaccompanied by constitutional symptoms. Scarlatina is an eruption;
but scarlatina is also a zymotic affection; and none of its symptoms exhibit
any resemblance to a peculiar kind of apparent performance on a stringed
instrument, which may be described as playing without music. There
is at least no evidence to warrant the conclusion that the malady meta-
phorically represented as expressing itself in a series of violin move-
ments executed in dumb show is endemic in the Lowlands, or that the
Highlanders have any particular occasion, on account of relief afforded
to superficial irritation, to invoke blessings on the memory of an
ancestor of his GRACE THE DUKE of ARGYLL. Our Scottish fellow-
subjects have been too commonly accused of labouring under a general
necessity of employing sulphureous friction. English provincial bigotry
itself must admit that the accusation is at least not proven.

DR. PUSEY ON THE TURF.
THE subjoined extract from “Sporting Intelligence” relative to the
run for the Trial Stakes at Oxford races will edify some of our
readers:—
“As soon as the flag dropped, King of the Forest instantly went to the front, with
Overton lying at his ths; Gauntlet, Commander, and Dr. Puseyside by side a few
lengths behind. As they came up to the distance the weight began to tell upon the
King, who fell back into the third º overton and Commander both passing him.
Opposite the stand Commander was leading, and he came through and won easily by
two lengths; half a length behind Overton came Gauntlet, the same separating
Gauntlet from King of the Forest; Dr. Pusey was last.".
It will be seen, by the foregoing statement that DR. Pusey ºccupied
the position of the winner in a donkey race. There is something re-
markable in this fact; especially as having occurred at Oxford Rages.
Many people will be surprised to learn that DR. Pusey, on the trial as
above decided, proved to have no followers in Oxford. DR, Pusky,
too, has always been considered as decidedly a fast goer. Yet the odds
were against DR. Pusey; a very small #. backing him, and grave
doubts being entertained whether the Doctor would run for stakes,
never havin }: gone quite so far as Highflyer, ridden by PRIEST. He
has probably let in a few of the yokels. The £º. are of course
rather down in the mouth about the defeat of their favourite, who had

A SPARROW MARKET NEAR SOUTHAMPTON.
A PETITION has been presented to the French º Législatif for
the º of sparrows and other small birds, with a view to the
benefit of , agriculture, on the ground that they do infinitel
good by º insects, than mischief in eating corn., Qn this
point there would be some difficulty of convincing the British Farmer,
and particularly, we should think, that type of him represented by the
gentleman whose name figures in the subjoined newspaper paragraph:-
“A PALPABLE STRETCH or THE Law.—Yesterday, before ADMIRAL Wigston and
MR. J. H. For Brs, m trates sitting at the Southampton County Bench, George
Gaaaart, a boy living in Houndwell, Southampton, was fined 2s. 6d., without costs,
for stealing four ears of wheat, the property of MR. Longman, of Hill Farm. The
boy picked the ears of wheatin a pathway, and was caught by the prosecutor, and
given into custody, remaining so for forty-eight hours, the prosecutor insisting on
pressing the charge.”
A gentleman capable of causing a boy to be imprisoned for forty-eight
hours for stealing four ears of wheat #. up in a pathway, and after-
wards of pressing such a charge of theft against the juvenile prisoner,
must be muchfonder of his wheat than he is of his species. He would
therefore, naturally be disposed to show no mercy to the feathered
tribes, which certainly do consume a considerable quantity of wheat,
even if º exterminate a more considerable quantity of insects. Their
estimated destruction of insects would be quite overlooked by a gentle-
man infuriated by the visible consumption of his wheat. The boys in
the neighbourhood of Hill Farm, instead of stealing MR. LongMAN's
wheat, and getting imprisoned and fined for picking a few ears of it,
might, make a good thing out of that gentleman's animosity against
depredators on his cereal produce. They should devote themselves to
ing sparrows, save all the heads of as many sparrows as they can
catch, and take them to MR. Longman. Of course MR. LongMAN
will give more than half-a-crown for the head of every sparrow, because
the bird will have stolen very much more than the four ears of corn
which were picked by MASTER GEORGE GARRATT.
STINGO FOR SUMMER.
We have been º: some delightful summer weather, and the

Alcohol 5'000
Extractive 3'885
Acetic acid ... ‘O30

This stingo is Fº by a competent examiner, (whose report
has lately reached us, in common, doubtless, with a number of the beer-
bibbing community) to be “the richest in alcohol, for its price” that
he has tested: and he adds he feels “persuaded that it is a genuine
article.” We are happy to append to this chemical certificate our
belief that such abeer must be most thoroughly innocuous, provided that
the aqua it contains be really, pura, of which, seeing that it is by far
the principal component, we think there should be given some satis-
fying proof. Grog made in the proportion of five parts of spirit to
ninety-one of water, would not harm the tenderest infant, if the water
were but proved to be a “genuine article; ” but if the water were
impure, we question very much if that amount of alcohol would be suf.
ficiently an antidote to what the water might contain. Were we at all
concerned in the sale of the strong beer to, which we have drawn
notice, we should lose no time in * a medical certificate, attesting
to the aqueous purity of the drink; for however great his love for unin:
toxicating beverages, surely nobody would like to drink, a pailful of

What incites him to poke fun at the Glasgow Volunteers we have

towards the corps, we shall abstain from saying anything to bring them
into ridicule. If it be true that their targets are in “first-rate preser-

tion between “drinkee for drunkee and drinkee for dry.” Drinkee for
drunkee is what they denominate Dipsomania; whereas that word is
only º applicable to inordinate drinkee for dry. Diſsomania is

innocent of all knowledge of the nature of intoxication as those must
be who expatiate on Dipsomania. Philosophers are too commonly dis-

circumstances to acquire by practical experience, a profounder
acquaintance with the philosophy of drunkenness than with any other.

LONDON CHARIVARI. 89
PUNCH, OR THE
A SOP TO CERBERUS.
OH ! Tearem . Where’s the set of teeth
You were so fond of showing, .
With snap and snarl from out their sheath,
At everybody going?
And where's the growl to all about
Distributed impartially,
For sins by that keen scent nosed out,
Or morally or martially?
This Tearem P Of the ſº19. £ye,
The branding º levelled,
Till even PAM was fain to fly,
And GRAHAM felt bedevilled!
This Tearem? Of all despots dread,
Of all oppressors terror;
Whose wrath on hate of wrong was fed,
Nor mercy knew for error!
Tearem, whom constant to his post,
Nor dodge nor ſeiuſ could puzzle:
The one true watch-dog (such his boast)
No hand could coax or muzzle!
Tearem, who whosoe'er might trip,
Was never known to blunder
The plyer of the "...ºf whip,
The wielder of the thunder'
Are these his teeth—an Austrian crust
That harmless mouth and mumble P
Is this his tail—that in the dust,
Wags to a Kaiser humble? -
Cana Herzoginn’s hand bid drop
That bristling crest tremendous?
Or hath a ScHMARBURG found a sop
To choke that maw stupendous *
What is the art that thus hath tamed
Dog Tearem's nature savage—
To praise, caress, brought tongue that blamed,
And fangs but formed to ravage?
'Twould be to wrong th' old Dog, I feel,
To hint that crusts or paunches
Were used to make him come to heel,
Or sit up on his haunches.
But though such tit-bits he would drop,
And gallantly forswear 'cm,
For Cerberus there was a sop,
And so there is for Tearem'
The sop of Cerberus was made
Of wine and oil and honey;
fTearem's sop, I am afraid,
Th’ ingredients cost less money.
The old dog, though as steel he’s staunch,
Of vanity so great is,
Adown his throat you’ve but to launch
Of butter quantum satis.
Butter—more butter—cram away
Down that insatiate hollow !
You cannot give so much, they say,
As Tearem's game to swallow !
But when the unctuous dose is down,
And happily digested, -
To smiles it smoothes his wrinkled frown,
Lays low his bristles crested.
His bark a whine of welcome grows,
His tail once stiff as poker
In languid volume eart ward flows,
Butter is such a soaker!
And thus on all the Tearem tribe
This sentence we must utter:
“Fifty Viennas could not bribe
But one's enough to butter!”
EUTHANASIA ACCORDING TO LAW.
WE despise that maykish sentimentality which not only refuses to
entertain the powerful arguments urged to support the infliction of
capital punishment, but is also so weak and effeminate that it cannot
even bear to hear mentioned those very particulars and details...of all
execution the statement of which is necessary to its own case. There-
fore we do not hesitate to disgust the few squeamish readers that we
may chance to have, by quoting from the Times the subjoined conclusion
of an account of the late hanging at Derby :-
“Ten minutes elapsed after the bolt was drawn before life was extinct.”
... Hanging is the cheapest of British punishments, except whipping, and
it is the most effectual security that we can take against a criminal.
This is much to say in favour of hanging, and it is a powerful reason
why all offenders, who are too bad to be only whipped, should be
hanged. Till convicts can be made to . for their keep, without
competing with free labourers, hanging will, on economical grounds,
remain highly preferable to penal servitude, not only for murderers, but
for all other felons, thieves, and rogues, whose liberty is incompatible
with public safety and comfort. . Mawkish sentimentality . have
nobody hanged; and in this desire mawkish, sentinentality is logical;
austere sentimentality is inconsistent in not demanding the execution of
every offender whose death would be an example, and whose life is not
worth preserving. .
It is, however, simply as capital punishment, and not as a peculiar
mode of inflicting that punishment, that hanging would be preferred by
a social economist to any secondary penalty. The object of striking
terror into the minds of the dangerous and troublesome classes woul
be better effected by burning alive, or breaking on the wheel. Mawkish
sentiment, however, has succeeded in abolishing the infliction of death
by torture; that is to say by torture intentionally contrived. It is
impossible to hang a criminal without hurting him somewhat ; but, in
hanging him, the end in view is only to kill him, and in killing him, to
hurt him as little as possible. . .
Now sometimes, when a criminal is hanged, as the reporters tell us,
the drop falls, and in a moment the unhappy man ceases to exist. In
the instance above cited, the sufferer was ten minutes in dying. If,
when the drop falls, the malefactor is fortunate enough to get his neck
broken, he dies at once. Otherwise he is slowly strangled. Hanging
thus may be attended with torture or it may not; therefore it is an
unequal punishment. , Accordingly in France, where equality, if not
liberty, reigns everywhere, even on the scaffold itself, the guillotine is
substituted for the gallows. , Now, the gallows is not the tree of
British Liberty, that Britons should cling to it, when some other con-
trivance might be made to answer the same purpose, and likewise act
on the British principle of fair play. A steam Decapitator, for instance
might serve to meet the combined views of austere sentimentality and
evenhanded justice, and would not be un-English, but would constitute
one more verification of the common saying that the French originate
inventions, but we improve upon them.

THE GENUINE ART OF CRAMMING.
THE subject of one of the papers read during the session of the
National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, was “The
Influence of the Food on the Intellect,” whereon DR. H. KENNEDY
lectured a hygienic audience. The influence produced by food on the
intellect would chiefly depend, we should think, on the fact to be stated
whether the food in question is food, for the mind or food for the body.
Metaphysics, mathematics, natural and moral philosophy, history,
biography, voyages, travels, novels, romances, }. and Punch,
especially Punch, are all varieties of mental food which may each have
their peculiar and important influence on the intellect; but the food con-
templated by DR. KENNEDY seems to have been that which nourishes the
brain in common with the rest of the body, and consists of various animal
and vegetablesubstances popularly comprehended under thename of grub.
There is a psychological condition, corresponding to a supposed con-
sistence of head, characteristic of certain persons who are commonly
called pudding-headed. Others are described as leather-headed for an
analogous reason. Perhaps these states of mind result from some par-
ticular kind of diet º to induce as it were a coriaceous toughness
or a doughy softness of understanding. . The brain contains phosphorus,
and so do many kinds of food; the phosphorus in the brain, may be
concerned in the evolution of luminous ideas; and it may be desirable
for those whose intellects are dull to put themselves on a diet con;
taining an extra quantity of phosphorus in order to obtain intellectual
brightness. Some jokers º eat, and more ought to eat, a great
deal of phosphorus. If there be anything eatable that will nourish the
intellect, how does it taste? “Fat paunches,” we are told by SHAKs-
PEARE, “have lean pates,” an observation extensively but by no means
universally true, “and dainty bits,” adds the divine WILLIAMs, “make
rich the ribs but banker out the wits.” On the other hand DR. John-
son said, “Sir, the man who will not take care of his belly will hardly
take care of anything else.” Johnson's large intellect appears to have
derived its nourishment from, a great variety and enormous amount of
savoury viands, in odd combination, some of them, as for instance,
plum pudding and lobster-sauce. Great geniuses are often consumptive
—like DR. Johnson. Wits are generally epigures; the aptitude to say
good things appears connected with the habit of eating them. ...What
clever fellows your Worships would be, if green fat ran to intellect, as
much as it does to paunch, and over indulgence in eating and drinking
were always associated with mental gluttony
If the intellect generally can be invigorated by º diet, its
several faculties may be capable of improvement each on a course of
some particular article of food. In that case it would be a good specu-
lation to set up an intellectual eating-house, or mental restaurant, near
a college, in order that the students might cultivate particular branches
of knowledge on the dishes suitable to each. This would be a great
improvement on the system of eating terms in a vague and indiscrimi-
nate way, as prescribed at the Universities.

º would be the waiter's recital of the bill of fare provided at
ining rooms established for the nutrition and refreshment of the intel-
lectual powers, and then, perhaps, you would hear him shout down a
voice-pipe, “Cook, two simple arithmetic mutton down together l’”

THE COOLNESS OF DR. CULLEN.
Q -> ORTHYDR. CULLEN has fallen
º
\?
º / foul, of LoRD BRough AM
President of the Social Sci-
ence Association, dared to
criticise the Papal Govern-
ment. The Pastoral which
contains the vituperation of
LoRD BRough AM, also con-
tains the wonderful state-
ment subjoined-
for having, in his place as
º
“At the same time the ofer-
ings of our faithful won for them
the applause of the Catholic
world, and Ireland was admitted
by universal consent to have been
- the first and foremost among the
nations that rallied round the
ºf menaced throne of the Roman
Pontiff. The prowess of her sons
on the battle-field of Italycrowned
the former efforts of our island,
and proved that the honour and
interests of the Chair of St. Peter
are interwoven with the dearest
affections of our Catholic people."
The Priest who has to
read a Pastoral of DR.
CULLEN's from the pulpit,
might, at the conclusion of
his task, do well to caution
the assembled faithful that what they had just heard was to gonofarther.
What must anybody outside of an Irish Roman Catholic. Chapel, or
any rational and commonly informed person in one, think of the above-
quoted brag about the prowess of the Pope's Irish auxiliaries on the
battle-field of Italy º CULLEN perhaps means to say that MAJOR
Q’REILLY thrashed CIALDINI at Castellidardo. The Pope's Irish
Brigade went to º on a fool's errand, and crowned all the former
efforts of Ireland in the cause which they fou ht for with a fool's cap.
They returned with holes in their garments, which were, not made by
bullets or bayonets, with fleas in their ears and elsewhere, and few
wounds that were worse than fleabites and the bites of other insects.
Some people are said to be more Irish than the Irish themselves. In
like manner the effrontery of DR, CULLEN is brazen to a degree above
the impudence of even the Brass Band.
NOVELTY IN NEEDLEWORK.
... WE have heard no end of tales about the wonderful º of the
rising generation, but the instance of it noted in the following adver.
tisement is perhaps of all the marvels that have reached us the most
marvellous:–
WANTEP, a clean, respectable GIRL, to NURSE a BABY, who can
fill up her time in plain sewing. A country girl preferred. Apply, &c.
A Baby “who can fill up her time in plain sewing” must be a most
surprising infantine phenomenon. The lady in the song, we are told
could solve a problem in Euclid before she could speak; but for a girl
to ply her needle when in a state of babyhood, appears to us a feat by
no means less astonishing. We wonder, can this baby sempstress
thread a needle for her work, and cut her cotton properly? The first
named of these processes must be a little difficult, and as much as she
can manage; for when they fill their needle, women generally, we
notice, bite the thread to make it pass; and how a baby can do this is
somewhat of a puzzle to us.
But, however this may be, a baby who can sew must be a treasure to
its parents, for babies mostly begin squalling when not otherwise en-
gaged, and their employments for the most part are limited to acts of
taking nutriment and sleep. Now, sewing is the quietest of quiet occu-
pations, and it must be a great blessing when a baby kindly takes to it.
As for the infant that has been the cause of these remarks, we hope
this baby sewer will reap the full advantage of her early education, and
be always competent to take that stitch in time which is proverbially
the means of saving needle-ess labour. -
Reward for Early Hours.
WE say to Young Ladies:– “As you F. your beauty, as you value
your future prospects, go to bed early. ok at Cinderella / Whenever
she went to a º she was bidden by her good godmamma to leave off
º at Twelve. And what was her reward? Why, she married a
rince.
SINECURES FOR SALE.
THERE is º all singular in the following advertisement. On
the contrary, enough of such to make the number plural are every week
put in the Record, and other organs of the Church:—
CHURCH PREFERMENT FOR SALE.
R. BLANK is instructed to DISPOSE of the NEXT PRESENTA-
TION to the SINECURE RECTORY of snoozewell. There are no duties of
any kind to be performed, and the Living may be held with any other Preferment
or Clerical Appointment in any part of the globe. The income is £285 a-year fixed,
from which there are no outgoings of any kind whatever. The duties of the Parish
are performed by a Resident Vicar, who receives the vicarial Tithes. Age of present
Rector, 71. Price very low. Interest would be allowed till possession.
There is nothing strange, we say, in this announcement. The cure
of souls has long been every whit as saleable, as the cure of herrings:
and even as the cure is, so the sinecure is also. Sinecurist Clergymen
are nowadays as common assinecurist Colonels; and the plan of getting
pay without doing any work is no more practised in the Army than it
is in the Church militant. Clerical auctioneers have pulpits by the
score to offer from their pulpit, and pluralists who can, afford to
purchase sinecure appointments daily hear of something eligible offered
to their notice. -
We mean, therefore, nothing personal to the fortunate possessor of the
next presentation to the rectory of Snoozewell, if we venture here to
call attention to the sale of it; nor we trust will MR. BLANK feel
offended by our freedom if we put into his mouth the following address
which in offering the º he might either sing or speak, and
enliven it, if he so pleased, by the saltatory accompaniment with which
the tune we have selected is commonly performed:–
AIR-"The Perfect cure.”
Now, gents, draw near, and lend an ear,
I’ve something snug to offer,
All play and pay; now start me, pray
Come, what’s the price you li proffer?
Who'll buy, buy, buy?–To a rectory I
The next chance can ensure:
Don't fear lesſ you’ll have work to do,
For 'tis a Sinecure.
Refrain. A cure, a cure, a Sinecure!
this you may be sure,
An easy shoe you’ll step into,
A perfect Sinecure!
“A thousand pounds.”—“And fifty”–Zounds!
You really must bid quicker:
“One hundred”—“two’–No work to do,
'Tis all done by the Vicar.
“Four hundred”—“Five”—Come, look alive,
It’s worth your while, be sure;
“Six ”—thank you—“ Eight ”—short time you’ll wait
For this snug Sinecure.
Refrain. A cure, a cure, a Sinecure!
Such slow bids can’t be sure:
To all I cry, come buy, buy, buy,
A perfect Sinecure
THE PRESENT STATE OF LONDON.
THE streets of London are all up, and the blinds all down, We
publish the above information for the benefit of the ladies who are
at the sea-side, and to tell them, much as we may sigh over their
absence, that there is nothing immediate or pressing to call them
back to town, and they are º at liberty to tell their husbands so. It
is as well when that importuning admonition does come, that the dear
creatures should be prepared with an answer that should be an effectual
stopper for some weeks to future importunities. We can assure them
that there is not a single person of note left in town, with the exception
of the obliging successor of MR.MATTHEw MARSHALL, who is com-
pelled to remain behind to sign the billions of bank-notes requisite for
remittances. We had an interview with him only the day before yester-
day, that to us was of the most satisfactory nature. We trust that his
wrist, used as it is to autograph work, has by this time ceased aching.
An Atmospheric Fact.
MEAT will not keep in this hot weather, not even in a lodging-house.
Though we have seen the meat safe over night, and were pleased to
think it was so full of hope, and looked so promising for the morrow's
dinner, yet the next day every scrap would be found to have gone, and
gone too beyond all hope of recovery. Meat never, goes, so quickly as
at the sea-side. In fact, it goes infinitely quicker than it comes.
Husbands, who are fond of hot dinners, should go to a marine lodging-
house, for they will never see there by any chance a bit of cold meat
for weeks and weeks together. -

How Two FRIENDs of ours who cAN'T BEAR BEING LookED OVER while THEY ARE Sketching, CIRCUMVENTED THE IMPERTINENT
CURIoSITY OF THE WULGAR.
THE PARISIAN MASS MARKET.
SoME curious revelations of the tricks of the Mass Trade in Paris,
have just transpired on the trial of a priest named VIDAL for frauds
committed by him in that traffic. Not long ago, one of the oldest sacer:
dotal firms in Paris, carrying on business at a certain church, was found
to have contracted to say, on behalf of the souls of parties deceased,
some 30,000 Masses, for which the money had been paid; but the reve-
rend contractors had failed to meet, their engagements. It appeared
that respectable houses and, individuals, concerned in this branch of
commerce, were very #. in the habit of taking more orders for
the release of souls from Purgatory than they were able to execute.
This discovery led to an arrangement between the Massmongers and
the Booksellers, whereby the latter undertook to act as middlemen
between two, classes of the former; the priests, on the one hand, who
had taken orders to say greater numbers of Masses than they were able,
and, on the other, those who were short of orders for Masses. The
orders are taken by the |. at one franc. per Mass; and it often
happens that one-priest has ºl. commissions to perform man
thousands of Masses at that rate; bargains which he is unable to fulfil.
The bookseller takes the Masses off the hands of the incumbered#. -
and allots them to substitutes of the class out of e ements. He pays
the priests whose surplus Masses he buys, in books, and remunerates
those whom he employs to say them in the same kind, pocketing the
difference in value, which, on an average, amounts to above 50 per
cent.
M. L’Abbé VIDAL had mixed himself up with transactions of this
kind, having adjoined the book-trade to the ecclesiastical and Mass-
mongery line. Both as Massmonger and bibliopole, however, he com-
mitted the untradesman-like mistake of falsifying his accounts. In
order to save his books, he enlarged the Mass-returns. According to
the Gazette des Tribunaur:-
-
“He had taken 30,000, and had only performed 6,630. He put for one priest who |
said 60, 360; for another who said 35,335, and so on. He was condemned to three
years' imprisonment, 500 f. fine, and five years' suspension.”
The Rev. PłRE WIDAL appears to have º an operation in
arithmetic precisely the converse of that which his evangelical studies
§. possibly have informed him, was perpetrated by a certain Unjust
eWard.
On a review of the facts above stated, it will be obvious that the
Mass market in Paris is in a state of depression. The tendency of
Masses is decidedly downward. It is not enough to say that Masses
are flat, however applicable that, epithet may be to their purchasers.
One franc per Mass is a very low quotation; and by the foregoing
account we see that Masses are done by the substitute priests at less
than that. -
When we consider what the Massmongers profess to sell, we cannot
but admire the moderation of their prices, which we should have
“ſº to be just thirty times as high.
n our point, of view, of course, Masses are dear at a franc, and
would be dear at a farthing. ... We, here in England, consider that to be
capable of exchanging even the smallest sum for such articles, anybody
must have more money than brains. ... In consequence of the foregoing
disclosures, Masses must become quite a drug in the Parisian market—
a drug whose '''. will be the poorer class of simpletons, who
constitute the bulk of customers for all quack medicines.
A Short Memory.
“‘And as for England," said M. CREMIEux, pleading for his brother-Israelite, M
Mihks, “who can count upon her?’”—Daily Telegraph.

SOMETHING FOR A RAINY DAY.
THE New Post Office Savings, Banks Act is to come into operation

justified in calling it an Act; for to our fancy it partakes much more of
the nature of a saving clause.

of bread and cheese and

what I, eat for dinner is too monstrous to be mentioned. In addition to these dainties, I
enjoy the further luxury of dressing, as I please, and can lounge about all day in a wide-
awake and slippers. My wife and daughters too are not required to change their clothes
eleven times a di §º. I believe is de rigueur at some more fashionable bathing-places.
Moreover, Sandbath is at present quite innocent of Cockneys, and one can stroll out without
having to exchange bows with one's greengrocer, or getting filthy penny ‘Pickwicks’ puffed
into one's face by boys in porkpie hats.
“The place, however, has its drawbacks, other than the loss of time and temper in arriving
at it. For instance, why am I not suffered to sleep after six A.M., nor take my after-dinner
snooze without disturbance? So surely as I settle in my easy chair, so surely a cornopean
at, six o'clock when one with ease could sleep
till nine, makes one feel still more vindictive
to one's species. For don't think that insectal
carnivora disturb one. So far as I can learn
there’s not a B flat in the place, and I believe if
one were “viewed” the inhabitants would rise
en masse to compass its destruction. No, what
wakes me every morning at the hour I have
named, is the shouting of ‘Fresh so-oles!' and
‘Here’s yar fine blo-o-aters!” by gangs of Sten-
tors, men and boys, who keep, parading º my
windows without ceasing until breakfast. Now,
what advantage there can be in this truly
‘crying’ nuisance I confess that it, quite passes
my conception to perceive. Surely everybody
knows that if one wants fresh fish, at the sea-
side, the only way to º it is to send to London
for it. And is it likely any visitor would buy of
any salesman who put him daily to the torture I
faintly have described In the autumn , a
fagged Londoner wants all the rest that, he
can get, and, if the natives of a watering-place
would find their fortunes prosper, they would
do wisely to secure their guests against annoy:
ance by keeping up in bathing-time a band of
stalwart beadles, who should drive all bloater-
bellowers and street-squeakers from the town.
“I remain, Punch, yours in agony (for there’s
another organ playing),

America, that she speaks, the same noble lan-

BOMBINA THE BOLD.
According to the Turin Correspondent of the Times, the Ex-Que EN
of NAPLEs is astonishing the natives and other inhabitants of the
º City by frequently going about Rome in man's attire. He
says that— -
“With her lord's privileged nether garments, she affects also manly swagger and
bluster. She 'smokes like a sailor and swears like a trooper,” as if that looked
pretty or sounded graceful.”
Among the comic songs of the last generation, there was one which
commenced as follows:–
“MR. Simpkins lived at Leeds,
And he had a wife beside,
Who, as she wore the breeches,
Would often wish to ride.”
Probably the fair SoPHIA, who is the better half, not of another Lord
BATEMAN, but, of the second FRANCIS, would also, as she swears like a
trooper, so “often wish to ride,” namely, in the same military manner
as that practised by dragoons. FRANcis, late of Naples, is to be con
gratulated on the similarity between his matrimonial_relations, and
those of the respectable SIMPKINS, formerly of Leeds. Would he were
so honest a man'
The ex-royal Sophia, by the same account, has a will of her own,
which manifests itself by the undermentioned indications:—
“High words and angry sarcasms are heard from the Quirinal's windows.
are shied at Royal heads, and fly into the streets to the great scandal of the Swiss
guard at the Palace gates.”
Should Louis NAPOLEoN allow Rome to join the Italian union, and
certain refugees take shelter in the safest place for them, heads of pas-
sengers will probably be cut open by plates "tº rom a window
of one of the hotels in Leicester Square. Ultimately, perhaps, SIR
CREsswell will be invoked to pronounce a judicial separation between
a pair of illustrious exiles. Their companion in banishment, the Pope,
would sanction a divorce which would not liberate the parties & pinculo.
His Holiness would see the necessity of a divorce à mensã, in a case
wherein the lady throws plates at table, and perhaps bottles.
It appears, however, that anybody who might be so rash or so
Plates
unfortunate as to upset Sophia, would stand a good chance of having
something more dangerous than even a bottle let fly at his head. In
continuation of the above extract we are told that:—
“The Queen, though robbed of her sceptre, disdains to handle the distaff; she
carries her dread revolver at her side; she delights in the exhibition of her skill;
she aimed at a cat, the other day, in the Quirinal Garden—a fine Syrian cat, gray,
long tailed, and hairy—who was basking in the morning sun (the Queen is up at 5)
on the wall hanging over the grottoed fountains and water-works, which are one of
the seven wonders of the city of the Seven Hills. Purring, and stretching, and
gambolling, did the unwary tabby luxuriate in the sense of blessed existence, when
the Queen took aim and fired, and the poor thing leaped up in the air, hit through
her head, and dropped down like lead into a basin of water beneath.”
The cat which Sophia is said to have shot is alleged to have be-
longed to a SIGNorA BERTAzzoli, CARDINAL ANToNELLI's sister;
and consequently or at least subsequently to the act of felicide of
which her º is accused, she has, we are informed, been almost
cut by the Roman ladies. Let us hope that the accusation is untrue.
SOPHIA may perhaps be masculine in her tastes, and also in her habits,
even as much so as MRs. SIMPKINs of Leeds was. One of her photo-
graphs represents her as bearing, in the face, a very strong likeness to
the late LoLA Montes. We should not be much astonished to find
that she really does dress like MRs. SIMPKINs, smoke, and swear, and
swagger, and throw plates. But we trust she did not shoot the cat.
... Hawks,” says the Scotch proverb, “winna pick out hawks' een.”
There is Fº too muth of the cat in the composition of the
heroine of Gaeta to make it likely that she would have deliberately
slain such a fellow-creature. . A female nature, capable of so savage a
deed, would be one which would be properly described as canine.
What the Tories Say.
LoRD PAM has all our confidence,
His Subs have less than half;
In fact, we like the Constable,
But don’t admire his Staff.
THE ONLY THING THE AMERICANs HAVEGAINED As yet by THEIR
CIVIL WAR.—The Income-Tax! and we wish them joy of it!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INFIRMARIES FOR DRUNKARDS.
F there is a mistake in
the word Dipsomania,
the error is confined to
its two first syllables.
Thereisnomistake about
the mania. Tipsy mania
is a fact deplorably com-
mon. An unfortunate
maniac of the tipsy class
the other day jumped out
of window. An inquest
was held upon his re-
º The
concludi art of the
report of that inquiry
may be quoted as awarm-
ing to the Legislature:-
pressed his intention of com-
mitting self-destruction, but
the family kept a constant
watch over him, owing to
his being addicted to intem-
perance. A gentleman re-
intive crpressed his regret, and also that of the other relatives, that, notwith-
standing their endeavours to obtain restraint by means of a lunatic asylum for the
unfortunate deceased, and thus to preserve his life, they were unable so to do in
consequence of being unable to produce a medical certificate. The deputy-coroner
said it was to be regretted that there were no means in this country otherwise
than by a medical cortificate for placing persons suffering from the effects of ex-
cessive intemperance under restraint. He believed that if ready appliance and
consent were given in many cases of delirium tremens, life would be saved. The
jury concurred in the remarks of the coroner, and without further comment
returned a verdict of ‘Suicide under temporary insanity.’”
Pelirium tremens is a privileged delirium, and a precious privilege it
has: the privilege of cxemption from the possibility of being put under
restraint. The consequence is often, as above recorded, “Suicide
under temporary insanity.” Humanity must admit that the suicide of
a sot, even, ought, if possible, to be prevented; and, besides, a sot
transported withºlirium tremens, and being at large in that condition,
may destroy other people's lives as well as his own. Some tipsy
maniac, one of these days, will throw himself from a second-floor front
and tumble on a passing Member of Parliament's head; perhaps a heat
entitled to be surmounted with a coronet or a mitre. Then at length
will perhaps be added to the Statute Book an Act for the safe Custody
and 8. of Persons affected with Delirium Tremens. If any Noble
Lord or Hon. Gentleman will charge himself with the introduction of a
measure for this purpose, let him insert in it a clause for the establish-
ment of Sots' Hospitals, under the more polite denomination, if neces-
sary, of Asylums for the Insanely Intemperate, to which institutions
every Magistrate shall be empowered to consign anybody who may be
brought before him in a state of delirium tremens.
PUNISH THE PUBLIC.
THERE would be no Thieves, says a dubious proverb, if there were
no Receivers. Be this as it may, there is no doubt that there would be
fewer thieves if there were fewer Tempters. It occurs to Mr. Punch,
who is—even at this season of idleness—busily watching the World,
and generally º it in order, that a great º of the robberies
} ostmen might e prevented, if we began at the other end, and
aced less temptation in the way of those who ought to deliver our
|. safely. -
Walking through Paris, the other day, Mr. Punch paused before a
Letter Box, and read º to the following effect. He does not
pledge himself to the verbal fidelity of his report, as he did not copy
the inscription, for two reasons; first, because he had no pencil, and
secondly, º it was much too hot to be standing in the sun for the
good of anybody. But in his exquisite, memory was instantaneously
photographed the purport of an Imperial and Imperious notice on the
part of the French Post Office, and the purport of such notice was
this:-
“AWIS.
“Any person who shall put into a letter any article of value, as jewellery or the like,
or any cheque, note, bill, dividend warrant, coupon, bank note, or piece of money, is liable
to a Penalty varying from Five to Five Hundred Francs."
What do you say to that, SIR. Rowland P Why not ask your noble
friend and chief, the P. M. General, to get you an Act of Parliament
authorising you to issue such a notification as this? Let the Public be
warned, instead of the Postman. Punish the Public, and not the

AIR-"I'm Afloat."
WE are up ! I’m a-drift What matters it where?
So I’m free from long speeches, late hours, and bad air?
I have pulled hº the Session, a model M.P.,
Till they voted supply to its last £ S. p.
I've sat on when all rational men had left town,
Till the pavements were up, and the window-blinds down;
I have seen all the bores on their hobbies astride;
Irish Members, for once, in one lobby divide;
I’ve heard PAM upon Arts; I’ve heard Osborn E on Arms;
And RoeBUCK expatiate on Austria's charms:
But even such wonders have palled upon me,
And I’m thankful to feel I am free, I am free.
Ha! Ha! Ha! &c.
I have watched the cool Whips, moving slyly about,
To make it all snug for a cozy Čount Out, , ,
When some proser of fifty-bore-power § his might,
And rose strong in papers, in wind, and in fight.
I have seen the obedient retreat of the pack
From the benches before him, and those at his back,
Till the limit was reached, and the fatal demand
For a “count,” freed the House—a glad holiday band!
But that joy was still chequered; we knew that the chain
We flung off the next morning would rivet again,
But now every morn as it riseth for me,
But confirms the glad news that I’m free—I am free!
Ha! Ha! Ha! &c.
Long vacations may brighten the lawyer's dim eyes;
Cockney shopmen their sniff of the briny may prize;
Old Paterfamilias may rub off his cares
In the pleasures of Margate, the calm of Broadstairs;

May risk on the ice of Mont Blanc or Zermatt; .
The Yachtsman may boast of his craft, and his pride
In cruisings on Solent, and .# at º:

There’s none like the overwork’d Parliament hack.
None can relish a roll out of harness like me
When, the Session once up, I am free, I am free!
Ha! Ha! Ha! &c.
SPORT FOR DISTINGUISHED FOREIGNERS.
THE attention of foreign noblemen visiting this country, and fond of
the chace, is directed to the subjoined announcement, dated from the
Moors:—
-- ... bad woather and the wildness of the birds,
the grouse-shooting in this neighbourhood has been much better than was expected.
They are not yet packed, and some of the young birds sit well and afford excellent
sport.”
There, M. le Baron, and M. le Comte—there is a chance for you!
Some of the young birds sit well, and, therefore, they afford excellent
sport. Of course they do; that is a logical consequence, Monsieur, if
you are a good shot, and, whilst they sit so well, fire at them with
such precision that they never get up and fly away.

MoUNT WESUVIUS is showing signs of an eruption. In eruptive
cases, we believe, the doctors “throw in,” as they say, a black dose.

if they did the mountain no good, the country would be all the
better for the injection. We would give a trifle to hear their De

Unfeline Conduct.
A PAINFUL rumour got into circulation the other day at Naples, to
the effect that the ex-Queen had committed suicide. The impression
was, however, dispelled, and also accounted for, by the more accurate
statement ſº. by one of our contemporaries) that her spirited
Majesty had shot a cat that was a favourite with some priests.

A GROSS CASE OF DOG-STEALING.
“MR. Punch, “Bond Street, Sept. 1861.
“NoTwiTHSTANDING the expense and pains which I, have
been at to procure for the masters o § protection from the hands
of those vagabonds who are constantly lurking about with the intent to
inveigle or snatch away from us our faithful four-footed servants, all
England—and I may say Europe—has just witnessed as gross a case of
Dog-stealing, I will undertake to say, as ever was heard of.
*That well known gentleman, Mr. Jon Bºii, was once blessed
with an equally well-known Dog, of the rough Terrier species—a Dog
invaluable of his kind, for giving the alarm whenever there was any-
thing wrong in the house, and barking furiously at all suspicious
strangers. -
* This Dog has now belonged to MR. BULL for many }. and his
fidelity was unquestioned until lately, when he was seen fawning in an
extraordinary manner upon an ill-loo foreigner named FRANCIS-
Joseph KAISER, who belongs to the Spread Eagle. Some say that this
fellow contrived to deceive the animal b utting on a pair of top-
boots resembling MR. BULL's, which the old Dog, whose nose is not so
good as it used to be, º forthwith to lick, not knowing the difference.
“I believe, however, the -
over by the fascinations of some member of the Swelſ Mob, with whom
the fellow is associated, who has patted him on the head, and taken
him up at table, which he had an opportunity of doing a little while
ago, when the dog is known to have visited the Spread Eagle.
“I have positive information that the fellow in question was seen the
other day making off with a little Dog, whose description corresponds
exactly to that of MR. Bull's Terrier, under his arm. Should any of
your readers catch sight of this party, whom they cannot mistake, they
are requested to stop him, and make him deliver up the Dog to be
restored to the owner. There will be no difficulty in identifying the
animal: a Sheffield Terrier, and answers to the name of Tearem.
“I am, &c.,

SPLENDID NEWS FROM WASHINGTON.
THE American Correspondent of the Standard states, we know not
how truly, that her Majesty ...LINGOLN is doing much to make KING
ABRAHAM unpopular. Her conduct is described as that of an unedu-
cated female without good sense, who has been unluckily elevated into
a sphere for which she cannot fit herself. This may or may not be,
but when the writer in question, in designing to clench the nail, adds,

of the Standard has unwittingly bestowed on MRs. L. the highest praise

is the Queen-regnant in the Union, the North is indeed to be congratu-

SOLDIERS OF THE CROSS KEYS.
THE Popolo d'Italia thus concludes an account of atrocities perpe-
trated by the Neapolitan brigands:—
“At Wigsti and Vico the scenes of pillage and blood defy description. The popu-
lace and brigands, not satisfied with sacrificing twelve of the principal families of
Wiesti, roasted a Liberal alive and ate him.”
Doing, possibly, some little injustice to a brute which, in spite of its
teeth, is said to be a carnivorous feeder, the KING of NAPLEs and his
ally the Pope, might say that the cannibals now engaged in a crusade
on their account in Southern Italy, are carrying on a Gorilla warfare.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TWO VOICES.
(As heard by Jon Es of the Treasury about Vacation Time.)
* A STILL small voice said unto me,
Wilt thou not take of liberty
The six weeks that they give to thee?”
Then to the still small voice I said,
“What use is a vacation, fled,
Erechin can with a beard be spread?”
To which the voice did urge reply
“To-day I saw young BROWN go by
In cab with luggage piled high.
“Vacation-longings rent the veil
Of his old husk: from head to tail
He blazed a heather-tweeded male.
“He took the northern night-mail through,
Shot grouse, stalked deer, drank mountain
ew ;
Northought upon the kites he flew.”
I said, “Of fellows about town,
Nature moulds some as with a frown;
She smiled when she created BROWN.
I may pick up.”
... She gave him brass; to shake the bones,
Tool four-in-hand across the stones;
'Tis quite another thing with Jon Es.”
Thereto the silent voice replied,
Humility that veileth pride .
Look through the office; it is wide.
“Than BRowN–’tis truth that I relearse—
In Treasury, as in Universe,
Are many better, many worse.”
“Will waiting make thee more inclined
To stir? Next month thou mayst not
Weather so suited to thy mind.”
Then did my answer clearer fall
“One English month of sun and squall
Is like another, after all.”
To which he answered, scoffingly,
...Good Jones, suppose I grant it thee,
Who'll care what thy six weeks may be?”
I would have said, “Thou canst not know,”
But, as it probably was so,
I let the observation go.
Again the voice said unto me,
“Thou art as bored as bored can be;
'Twere best to cut the Treasury.
“Thy salary scarce thyself can keep :
Up by ten pounds a year to º
E’en now in debt thou art chim-deep !”
Isaid, “I may have an advance;
If I resign, I lose the chance,
And for another berth may dance.
“A Private Secretary’s place
But he, “To grace
Thy name of JoNEs A likely case !”
“I should be glad to go,” said I,
“But how to raise the wind, whereby
My wings shall gain the force to fly ’’
“Think not of that,” the voice replied,
“Thy fellow-clerks, on every side,
Still for each other's bills provide.
“Acceptances they’ve asked of thee;
Now, in thy turn, essay and See
If they acceptors will not be.”
I said, “Of paper I am sick;
The three months will come round so quick;
No; rather strive to stretch my tick.
“But where is there that I can go?
Each English watering-place I know;
Many are snobbish-all
“Baden,” the voice replied, “is near.
Roulette thy leisure hours might cheer
And thy expenses help to clear.”
“Or it might clean me out,” I said,
“Down to that last rouleau of lead,
Clapped in a pistol to the head.”
“The Bermese Oberland sublime,”
The voice replied, “that is the clime
Where now 'tis fashionable to climb.”
I said, “I know the fact, but Jones
Has some º, on his bones;
His motto’s, “Easy o'er the stones.”
“Besides—not counting risks to skin,
Hotel bills long, and commons thin,
I can not stir—I’ve not the tin ”
I ceased, and sat as one forlorn,
Benumbed by that sharp voice of scorn
When sudden on the air was borne
A second voice, that at mine ear
Soft whispered, “Be of better cheer;
Enjoy the leave, and have no fear.”
Like PATTI's voice, whene'er she takes
Qne's spirit, in a brace of shakes,
And even BROWN to “Bravi /’’ wakes,
Such seemed the whisper at my side.
“What is't thou knowest, sweet voice P”
I cried;
“A hidden hope,” the voice replied.
“There’s your old Uncle—he that made
His fortune in the India trade--
May hop the twig–or that old maid,
“Your Aunt GRIMGUFPIN, may go hence;
Isong she has kept you in suspense,
But you’re her heir, if words have sense.
“Or there’s that mice girl, with a clear
Two thousand Three per Čents. a-year,
Now looking for a husband here.”
Then forth into Whitehall I went
And with the West-ward tide I blent,
And wondered at my discontent 1
are slow.”
I wondered while I paced along,
The very snobs that swelled the throng
Seemed happy as the day was long.
I wondered why I had made choice
To commune with the gloomy voice,
Rather than that which said, “Rejoice!”

on BEing invited to contribute to THE AMERICAN Loan.
Did you ever imagine the lending you money?
Well, of all Yankee notions that’s far the most funny;
Lend you money!—for what when the loan you have gotten?
Why to throw it away in withholding my cotton!
Fortune favours the brave, and your courage I own,
Notwithstanding Bull's Run: but rare fortune alone
Can afford you success in this maddest of wars.
You've novisible chance to regain your lost stars.
You’ll spend all you borrow in powder and ball,
And then have to show for it—nothing at all.
What dividends, pray, are you like to declare
On the debt you’ll have sunk and blown into the air?
Why, you know that you’d not stand the slightest taxation -
That you could get rid of by Repudiation,
Though of value received in the fullest fruition,
Not paying for that which has gone to perdition.
The cost of your war you expect to defray
By an Income-Tax, do you, and that who will pay?
Sº keen and so smart in ailmaiters of elſ,
To think of a Yankee assessing himself!
I know I am rather a sordid old screw,
Lending money I care not what for or whom to,
So the party is solvent, but that is, with John,
A point indispensable—sine qual non.
But, hang it, though cash I may lend to the deuce,
If secure of investment, º ess of use, .
When the object is evil, and hopeless the gain,
I should be, if I so misèmployed it, insane.
Last of all, to abuse me, malign, and decry,
And threaten to whip and to rob by-and-by,
Is not quite the right way, not the language and tone,
To get out of me an American Loan.

GEMS FROM THE EMERALD ISLE.
WE wonder, is HER MAJESTY a reader of the newspapers? If she
be, how mightily she must have been amused by the accounts which
have appeared of her visit to Killarney, and of other of her do in
the Emerald Isle. The Special Correspondents who have followed her
about have, we think, been more than usually profuse in their descrip-
tions, and have furnished such minute details of her demeanour that
one wonders hºw on earth they could have been obtained. After nar-
rating how the Town Commissioners of Mallow went through the usual
hore-ish custom of “presenting a loyal address of welcome,” one of
the writers in describing the reception at Killarney, says:-
“The QUEEN seemed greatly impressed, and highly pleased with the enthusiasm
of the people. When the cortege got down amongst them she bowed repeatedly, to
the right and left, to them with a marked and gracious manner, and frequently
º with evident gratification, at the eagerness with which the peasantry, men
and women, rushed around the carriage to see and cheer. The cortège passed the
grand entrance of Killarney House, and went down the picturesque road towards
Ross Island, when they entered Killarney demesne by the keeper's gate, under a
triumphal arch. At Presgat Valing, the drive in this beautiful demesne, the Ken-
mare tenantry, with their families, were congregated. They presented a most
comfortable appearance, and were loud in their acclaimations. In about three-quarters
ºf an hour the Queen arrived at the terrace in front of Killarney House, where she
was received, amid great splendour and the loud cheers of a highly respectable
assemblage, by Loeb CastleRosse and his Lady. The Queen was most friendly in
her manner, and also very animated.”
As described by this historian, this Royal Scene appears to have
been witnessed on the stage, there is so strong an odour of the foot-
lights in the text. The groups of happy peasantry, the bowings and
the smilings, and the chorus of loud cheers, all, are just what one
remembers in half-a-hundred operas that one with ease could name.
In what consisted the “great splendour,” amid which the reception of
HER MAJESTY took place, it is left to every reader's fancy to conceive;
but one can imagine how a playbill would have ſº on the
“gorgeous appointments” of the scene, and described the “blaze of
brilliancy” with which it would conclude. -
In a scarcely less, theatrical and quite, as fanciful a vein, another
writer in describing the visit to the Curragh Camp, observes:–
“Beyond one or two Irish peasants who happened to be passing, there was hardly
a single spectator in the plain. Yet the sight was a suggestive one, though neither
very grand or very striking as a spectacle. Apparently it was only three mounted
gentlemen looking on at regimental drill. Even the country people present did not
know that the Prince Consort was one of these three, or that the fair young officer
with black crape on his arm at the rear of the regiment, who was sº quick in
obeying Colonel. Percy's stentorian orders, and who stood at such rigid attention
among the privates of his company till the word “Officers at ease" gave him and
others time to rest and wipe their brows, was the Patnce of WALes, the future
King of England. Yet there he was, shoulder to shoulder with Privates Smith and
Brown, and looking after his company with as much care and eager activity as all
the rest of the captains. He looked, as he always does in his uniform, remarkably
well, perhaps a little browner, and º more robust and formed in figure,
even, than he did on that eventful morning when he landed from the Hero, and won
the hearts of all the ladies of Halifax by standing under the arch at the dockyard
while his photograph was taken."
The ladies of Halifax must be º susceptible if all their hearts
were won by the process here described. Of course we understand
their admiration of our Prince, of whom as Englishmen of course weare
naturally proud. But standing under an arch while one's photograph
is taken seems to us a most unlikely way of winning female hearts.
Men, seldom look more ludicrous than, when they are “placed in
osition” by photographers, and most Adonises would, find it a most
angerous experiment to let the lady of their love behold them in their
se. It speaks volumes for the º that he could win so º
learts º standing in (no doubt) a ridiculous position; thoug
whether his conquests were due more to his princedom, than his person,
is a question which the ladies of Halifax may answer, but on which we
mean to keep our own cºnviction to ourselyes. -
But of all the snobbish bits of Special Correspondence with, which
the British public has recently been favoured, we incline to think the
following should rank in the first place:-
“HER MAJEsty spent a most agreeable day, and she appeared all through to be
greatly delighted. The Qt EEN and PRINCE ALBERT repeatedly expressed their
unqualified admiration of the scenery. His Royal Highness said many portions
were sublime.”
Indeed! did he really! Now, how on earth, Mister Special, did you
manage to learn that? You surely don't meah us to fancy that you
stood beside his elbow, and heard with your own ears the words you
put into his mouth. Penny newspaper reporters have not usually the
privilege of entrée to the Court, yet unless you were received within
the Royal circle you could not possibly have heard the observation you
report. As the QUEEN, and the PRINCE Consort are not bereſt of
eyes, of course they would admire the charming scenery of Killarney,
and no doubt their admiration would at times find verbal vent. Celt, ºa
sans dire to my ordinary reader, and where then is the good of snob.
bishly affecting to have heard the Royal words, and to have seen the
Royal rapture in the Royal face?, It is by such practices the Press is
lowered in repute, and people think it is the work of a vulgarian to
write for it.

A WORD WITH THE WOLUNTEERS.
The universe well knows how immensely Mr. Punch admires the
Volunteers. , Hath he not from their first starting advanced them his
...; and so shielded them from the ridicule which might have
otherwise been hurled at them? Hath he not in fact made #. In OWe-
ment what it is, the glory of this island and the terror of the Continent?
Guided by the promptings of his “sagacious instinct” (to which LoRD
PALMERSTON so pointedly referred the other day, in his speech on
installation as Warden of the Cinque Ports), Mr. Punch saw from the
first that by the growth of Volunteers there would be saved the cost of
increase of the Army; so his feelings as a tax-payer inclined him to
regard them with considerable favour, and to lose no chance to pat
them on the back.
Mr. Punch is free to own that on the whole his pets have shown
themselves deserving of his patronage, and that their prowess in sharp-
shooting proves them worthily descended from their ancestors of old,
who were so admirably skilled in drawing the long bow, and when they
shot an arrow, É. the enemy they aimed at an-arrow chance of life.
The dreary drudgery of drill is far more patiently submitted to than by
many a pipe-clayed }}. was averred would be the case; and if at
a review a ramrod has been shot away, such accidents have chanced
with the best regulated regulars, and one must not blame the Volun-
teers alone for having suffered them.
But there are many minor matters connected with the movement for
which the hand of a reformer might fitly be invoked, and this hand
(with a pen in it) Mr. Punch would fain stretch out. For instance, if
the Volunteers have any music in their souls, why do they let their
bands, perform such pitiable tunes as nine corps out of ten appear con-
tented to step out to, but which have nothing in them inspiring to a
soldier, and indeed seem only written for the small boys in #. streets P
Surely quite enough of martial music has been written to save the need
of playing nigger melodies to march to, and there surely is, as much
that is inspiring to a Rifleman in such a tune for instance as the British
enadiers. as in the silly “Perfect Cure,” or the sillier “Sally Come
Up.” Yet for once that one may hear the former march performed,
one hears a hundred brayings of the latter stupid tunes: and one feels
tempted to º: that as the bands appear so fond of playing nigger-
songs, they ought to black their faces to make the thing complete."
Another nuisance to be quashed is the trick that some corps, have of
returning from a march in the middle of the night, and of making the
night hideous with the blaring of brass bands, thereby awaking sober

out; but it .." is too bad that a whoſe town should be disturbed,
because Private BRowN or BugGINs is 5. rather tired, and wants
the stimulus of music to spur him on the march. -
There are other faults and follies whereof Mr. Punch has heard, which
all true Volunteers should lend their help to crush, as they, tend to
bring the movement into disrepute. For instance why some Riflemen
can't walk out in their uniform without lighting a short #" is a mys-
tery which time as yet has failed to solve; nor, is, it a whit plainer to
non-military minds why some Volunteers should hold themselyes quite
free to smoke on railways without asking for permission, and to puff
their smoke in the face of fellow-travellers without thinking it possible
that it may not be liked.
These are some of the things done by the fast men of the movement
who seem to emulate the Yankees in going a-head of due propriety and
out-running good taste. But Mr. Fmº feels sure that our fastest
Volunteers will, never, emulate that “unfortunate º of move-
º" by which the Yankee Volunteers were distinguished at Bull's

GHOSTS WITH A GRIEVANCE.
A CASE has just occurred, on which Mr. Punch would like the opinion
of his friend, CARDINAL Wiseman, or some other doctor in Catholic
theology., A French priest, the ABBAE WIDAL (not WIDIL) has been
found guilty of divers acts which the tribunal of the Seine has been
profane enough to describe as swindling, and the holy man has been
sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and a fine of £20. He had
been into what is called the Mass Business, that, is to say he had
accepted commissions to say, or procure to be said, Masses, for the
benefit of, the souls of various persons. His charge was not high, for
lie demanded only Tenpence per Mass, and he received 33,194 commis-
sions, at this reasonable rate. Had he executed these commissions, he
would have discharged his duty to the satisfaction, we presume, of the
living and of the dead. But the ABBé WIDAL did nothing of the kind.
He procured only 6,634. Masses, and pocketed the rest of the money, to
an * exceeding £1,000. Consequently there are 26,560 Masses
wanting.

secular justice, not one of religious service.
Will the Church interpose, and declare the defunct parties entitled

M. BLONDIN’S BUMPS.
IN one of our cheap contemporaries has appeared a letter on the
phrenological and physiological characteristics of M., BIONDIN, by a
gentleman whose signature is FREDERICK BRIDGEs, “Author of Phre-
nology, made Practical,” a compact, little manual of that science,
embellished with instructive illustrations. Premising a statement, of
the way in which he procured an introduction to the subject of his
sketch, MR. BRIDGES tells us that:—
“BLoNDIN is affable and ble, without any of that stuck-up self-importance
so common to public men. en I explained to him the object of my visit, he at
once allowed me to make a phrenological and physiological examination of his head
and general system.”
We are sorry to find that, according to the experience of MR.
BRIDGEs, a common characteristic of public men is stuck-up self-
importance. We rejoice, in learning that M. BLONDIN is an exception
Only we should like to know the compass within which
- to the public men whom he ranks
with a famous rope-dancer. arriors, statesmen, divines, artists,
authors, actors, and eminent acrobats, are they generally alike distin-
guished by stuck-up self-importance, and by having, as they must have,
according to phrenology, a large organ of self-esteem P DR: GALL
supposeſ that this organ was connected, in animals, with a tendency to
mount aloft. Some other, perhaps, performs a similar function in the
brain of M. BLONDIN. - >
The following is the account given by MR. BRIDGEs of M. BLONDIN's
phrenological peculiarities:-
“The formation of his head ſhdicates a well-balanced brain. The organs of con-
centrativeness, constructiveness, combativeness, imitation, size, and weight are
large. Cautiousness and the reflective organs are also highly marked. This com-
bination gives cool courage, boldness, circumspection, and calm judgment, and
unity of action of the various organs of the brain and general system. Many per-
sons labour under the impression that BLonDIN's feats upon the rope are dangerous;
so they are, but not to him. He is as much at home upon the rope as the squirrel
is in its gambols from tree to tree.”
The organisation above specified would do pretty well for a SIR
to the rule.
MR. BRIDGEs speaks in judiº
Isaac NEWTON, one would think, as well as for a BLONDIN, “Cautious-
ness and the reflective organs” would have been expected by few to be
found “highly marked” in the head of a man accustomed to dance on
a tight-rope 150 feet high. The natural suggestions of those organs
must, in such a case, be prodigiously .# by the force of “com-
bativeness” and the conscious ability of “constructiveness,” “size,”
and “weight,” to enable a cautious man on so marrow a footing, at
such an altitude, tº reflººt, on his situation, withºut shuddering, and,
consequently, .# off his perch. . How about “hope” and “firm.
ness?” The former of these organs might be conjectured to be necessary
to inspire a#. *ś . BLONDIN's vocation with confidence in
the probability of not breaking his neck, and the latter to assist in
maintaining the steadiness which alone could avert that accident.
As things which are equal to the same are equal to each other, and as
the wondrous LéotARD's performances very nearly resemble those of
the astonishing BLONDIN, their phrenological developments ought to
be exceedingly similar. The portraits, however, of LÉOTARD exhibit a
#. of head which can hardly be much like BLONDIN's, for it is quite
the reverse of that exhibited by the bust of SocRATEs.
MR. BRIDGEs says, no doubt truly, that BLQNDIN is as much at
home upon, the rope as the squirrel is in its gambols from tree to tree.
The squirrel is an admirable acrobat; so is the monkey. Anti-phreno:
logists may . that neither the squirrel northe monke are endowed
with the cerebral development of º BLONDIN. To this objection,
however, MR. BRIDGEs may, fairly answer that, as it takes a wise
man to make a fool, so also it asks a philosopher to emulate a
jackanapes.
The announcement that, M.BLONDIN has a well-balanced brain, will
be accepted without cavil. That gentleman's brain must be at all
times extremely well balanced to preserve its balance on the #.";
If, in that situation, it were unfortunately to lose its balance, M.
BLONDIN would inevitably have a great fall, and then all the horses,
and all the men, of Her Most Gracious MAJESTY would be as fruit-
lessly employed in attempting his reconstitution, as the stud and the
retainers of a former Sovereign were in the endeavour to effect that of
HUMPTY DUMPTY,

SPECIMIEN OF LYING.
.THERE is a good story of a French soldier, who was near
his officer at a siege, when the head of the latter was taken
off by a cannon-ball. Friends of the officer came up, and
the brave soldier said, “Yes, gentlemen, he had only time
to say to me, ‘Take my purse and my watch, and he was
dead.’” But the story will not stand alone in its good-
ness, since the last news from America. The unfortunate
GENERAL Lyon, according to the Special Correspondent of
one of the New York papers, “was shot straight through
the head. I asked him whether he was hurt. He said,
I think not much,” and those were his last words.”
Lions are tenacious of life, and Yankees are credulous of
lies, but this will hardly do. . And it is “too bad” that a

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“WHAT with BLONDIN and BEETHoven, flower-shows and
FEcHTER, déjeuners and dances, rowing-bouts and races, º d-
Magog banquets and lectures on Gorillas, conversaziones and Crystal
Palace concerts, pig-nics and new pictures, Art meetings and “Aunt
Sally’ meets, there has been this year in London no lack of entertain-
ment, and a man may well feel blasé whose sole business in the season
is merely to amuse himself. As for the poor critics whose task it is to
chronicle the various amusements, one may imagine their relief when
this high-pressure time is past, and how thankful they must feel when
there is ‘nobody in town' to go to any theatre, and therefore to be told
which theatres to go to. After nine months of hard work in seeing all
the plays produced, and for mational information commenting thereon,
how gladly must a critic retire to some calm, spot, where great trage.
dians are unknown, and the small beer of the Stage is by no chance
ever broached. And how, pleasant must it be to him, as he sets forth
in August, to think that till November he is quite safe from a summons
to report on a new piece, and that he may feel quite easy in his con-
science, however far he may be lured away from town.
“My thoughts took some such idle flight as this the other day, while
§ hands were, with the laboured indolence of Englishmen, employed,
till the Times came, in pitching stones into the sea, or building sand-
Sebastopols to amuse my youngest son. And when the Times di come,
I could scarce believe my spectacles when I saw announced, “Next
Saturday, a new and never-acted Comedy!’. A new comedy now, in
the first week of September! Oh, there must be some mistake!, “Next
Saturday, no doubt, has been misprinted for ‘Next Christmas.” So I
bought a score of papers, in the hope to prove the fact, But no-in all

the novelty of the thing, to come to town “for one night only, and to

“The Soft Sea (“Les Femmes Fortes,’ as it was called in Paris) is by
no means, to my thinking, a condemnable production,-or translation
were perhaps a more beſitting word, although by, some mischance its
first night was threatened to be its last. But authors grow...too wi
to be biassed by first. º: for they know that people easily are .
* the ‘Noes,’ and blindly echo one another, like a pack of geese, when
they begin to hiss. Still, if managers are so lazy as to let new plays be
played with hardly a rehearsal, they cannot, wonder if an audience ex-
press its disapproval, and make itself as disagreeable as it can. The
plot is not the most connected, and has several excrescences; but there
is enough of story to save the play from dragging, and several of the
scenes have quite enough of novelty tº keep one's interest, well awake.
The dialogue is brisk, if it be not brilliant; and the ſºlº of stage
law, which is scattered through the piece will amuse those junior legal
spiders who have come back from their holiday, and, while their
seniors enjoy themselves, are left to mind the web.
“There is nothing vastly novel in the characters, may be, but they
are most of them amusing and serve quite well enough for the couple of
hours' acquaintance with them, one enjoys. One certainly would not
like to pass much longer than that time in so hot-watery an establish-
ment as that of Boilover Hall, where the ladies, try to show the supre-
macy of their sex by walking down to dinner independent of the gentle-
men, to whom the privilege is yielded of playing the piano, and pouring
out the tea. Good specimens are given of several of the species #
weak strong minded women by whom the world was threatened some |
few §. ago; from the oratress who gabbled about Woman's Rights
and Mission, to the doctress who had mastered all the arts and sciences,
but was no more fit to be the mistress of a household than she was to
be the mistress of a heart. Moreover there is no stage lover in the
comedy; and this º that such characters are at the Hay-
market invariably handed up folyſis. Howe (a very useful actor, but
seen to more advantage as John Ironbrace, the blacksmith, than in more
tender parts) I think that there are many will agree is no great loss.

body expects it; and as it takes place between MR. and Mrs. MATHEws,

POTS IN BROADCLOTH AND KETTLES IN PLUSH.
MR. PUNCH has not failed to utter himself on the great Master and
Servant question, as on all other questions of the day. It is long since,
in his two series of Flunkeiand and Serrangalism, he lashed the
immense impudence that occasionally clothed itself in plush and pow-
der, and the awful arrogance that flounces up and down the area-steps,
levies blackmail on the tradesmen, cultivates clandestine relations with
the I. of kitchen-stuff, and finally discharges itself in avalanches
of abuse upon unfortunate Missuses. - -
But Mr. Punch, if unmerciful, is impartial. His blows fall with
Rhadamanthine equity on high and low alike. . He can no more satisfy
the sufferers under his scourge } this equal distribution of his favours,
than the drummer could when, after doing his best to lay the cat evenly
about the offender's back, he was driven to complain, “ # high or low,
there’s no pleasing you.” But no doubt the drummer himself expe:
rienced a conscientious pleasure from the thought that the whipcord
had been laid on with strict distributive justice. . And so does Mr.
Punch. He flogs fair, because he likes it, and not in any hope to meet
the views of his floggees.
So now that the tide of the Times letter-writers sets strong against
poor Plush, and the sleet of Paterfamilias's scorn drives bitterly into
the Housekeeper's room, let Mr. Punch remind the sufferers under their
domestic tyrants, whom they pay and feed to rule over them, that this
question, like every other, has two sides to it; that, in this matter, as
in others, there is no effect without a cause and no effect that does not
become a cause in its turn. . Mr. Punch is free to confess that servants
are, too often, immense nuisances. .# are apt to be insolent and
overbearing; saucy and scornful; forgetful that Plush, like Property,
has its duties, as well as its rights; wasteful of their masters’ sub-
stance; careless of their employers' comforts; content with the most
superſial eye-service; wolves in appetite; peacocks in attire; sloths
in service; and jackdaws in pilfering. Who. like Punch, has touched
- old pests on the raw -
ut rs and Missusses have their rates too,
to touch them, with pen or pencil. The plain English of the matter
--- though it is not so
is that Servants are as a class, what Masters and Missusses have made
them. It is true, that as one black sheep will scab a flock, so one rogue
in livery will taint the whole Servants' , but the virus, in nine cases
out of ten, comes from ". Think, my worthy SIR APRICIUs DE
TABLEY-when you are blowing-up your stately twelve feet of powder,
white choker, canary cloth, cotton . and orange plush, because they
turn up their noses at cold mutton, and find even the “plain jints” of
the second table monotonous—of the dinner served up toº every day,
and the fussºl. make about it. Think of the position M. BéchâMEL,
your unequalled chef, holds in your household, your affections, and your
wages-account. Think of the conversation, thé guests, the “walks and
ways” at your own table, and then honestly ask yourself whether, when
Master is doing such daily devotion to Saint Belly, you have any right to
scold JoHN THoMAs for bowing before the same altar, and making his
humble offering in the Servants' Hall, to the saint whom his master is
On i. knees to, two good hours daily, in the costly rites of the dining-
room
And you, Most Noble, Grace of Fitz-PLANTAGENET, who stand
aghast at the insolence of that creature—your maid, MINNIKIN! Can't
you guess where she got that trick of carrying her nose so high Do
you suppose her perquisites are confined to your Grace's cast-off gowns
and lages—that she can wear these without catching, in a second-hand
way, the ailments of the original º: If you look on yourself
as the Sèvres of society, what right have you to be savage when she
assumes to be its Worcester or best Staffordshire stoneware? If she
isn't the rose she has lived too near to the rose not to catch a faint
reflection of its superfine scent and aristocratic colour. , You ought
to know that sneering is as º: aS .# and that scorn-
fulness and self-love can no more be kept to oneself than scald-head.
Insºad of discharging their vials of wrath against the Servants’
Hall, suppose people set to work diligently to disinfect their dining
and drawing-rooms? How, I ask, is JEAMEs to respect the dignity of
labour, when my LoRD IoilingtoN, behind whose chariot he clings
with his twin colossus, shaking awfully as to calves, glories in being
the laziest of human beings? en young CIBBERwright is groaning
oyer the crumpled roseleaf which that abandoned housemaid has left in
his mattrass, has he any right to lift his eyebrows because young CIB.
BERwRIGHT’s own man is indignant at being put into a bed without
curtains? -
Do you suppose those glorious armies of flunkeys which manoeuvre
round dinner-tables can be trained to stop their ears, as easily, as they
can to keep down their grins and guffaws—that they don't hear and
Fº what the people whose plates they are changing praise and
elieve in, and laugh at, and are interested about. Remember that
Master and Missus think nothing of being seen en déshabillé by the
butler or the housekeeper. As man and woman too is an imitative
animal, can we wonder that the face should be occasionally mimicked
instead of the mask-the real Master or Missus instead of the company
one * Remember too that Mr. Butler or Mrs. Housekeeper is bound to
you by no legal tie but wages. If there is to be any other bond between
up-stairs andſ down, it must be one of Master's or Missus's making.
The sum and substance of the matter, in Mr. Punch's notion, comes
to this:-Tell me what the Masters are, and I will give a shrewd guess
at the Servants. , Show me a picture of the Drawing-Room, and I will
find you a faithful reflection of it in the Servants' Hall—mutatis mutandis,
of course, but with the balance of light and shade very, very much the
same. When luxuriousness show, parade, pretention, selfishness,
worldliness, and veneer, in all fashions, rule above-stairs, what right
have we to expect that frugality, simplicity, diligence, humility, faith:
fulness, and “the genuine article,” should be the staple commodities of
the area-level?
SHEFFIELD'S POLITICAL J. A. R.
WE copy the following from the Sheffield speech of MR. Roebuck,
as it is reported in the Morning Star: —
“There was a thing (Punch) much bandied about that day, in which the EMPERQR
of Austria is represented as having run away with the dog Tearem; but had he
run away with the dog? was not he here—(laughter)—and what had the EMPERob
of AUSTRIA done to make him carry him away?"
MR. Roebuck is pleased to call Mr. Punch “a thing.” The retort
is scarcely so ºft as we should have expected, and, moreover, we
believe “a thing” is generally a term of sarcasm used by Women when
in a rage. We are not angry, only disappointed. We will not retali-
ate. º short, to please our John ARtfigh, whom in former days we
have greatly admired, we will consent to be called “a thing;” and if
in return, we are asked what is our opinion of MR. Roebuck, we will
be perfectly content to say “No-thing.”
American Unity.
MRs. Stowe has published a long and grandiose letter to an English
nobleman on American affairs. It is dated before “the rapid move-
ment” of Bull's Run, and the lady observes that “the North rose like
one man.” Would she kindly mention what man, and also why he ran
away like one woman.

BOYS PLAYING AT BLOODSHED.
ONE would think that a battle-field was a playground, and that a
battle was somewhat of the nature of a game at football, judging from
the sportive manner in which the horrors of war are generally narrated
by the gentlemen who witness them. For instance, in describing the
battle of Springfield, a correspondent of the Missouri Democrat thus
writes:–
“The enemy came fresh and deceived our men by bearing a Union] flag, causing
them to believe SIGEL was about making a junction with our forces. Discovering
the ruse just in time, our gallant boys rushed upon the enemy, who, with four
cannon belching forth loud mouthed thunder, were on the point of having their
efforts crowned with success, and again drove them with great loss down the slope
on the south side of the hill.”
“Our gallant boys rushed upon the enemy.” Why “boys.” P Is
reciprocal slaughter and mutilation child’s-play? o martial com-
batants thrust bayonets into one another's stomachs, and shoot each
other through the chest with rifle bullets, knock off their adversaries.
heads and limbs and get their own knocked off with cannon-balls, and
exchange bombshells by which, on either side, they are ripped up and
torn to pieces, for fun?. Are bleeding gashes, crushed limbs, scattered
brains merely the diverting incidents of a juvenile pastime? If so, well
and good; if not, why “boys?” -
. When a collision occurs in a tunnel, or when an engine runs off the
line, and, two or three carriages being hurled down an embankment
some ten or twenty passengers are consequently smashed to death, an
three or four times as many are dismembered and lacerated, do we call
the victims and sufferers," boys” and “girls?” If not, why not, so
long as it is usual to describe as “boys” adult men engaged in inflicting
and receiving injuries which are precisely similar if not more horrible.
Is there, amongst the mass of people, a gregarious kind of tacit
understanding that warfare and its occurrences shall be ordinarily
mentioned, related, and alluded to, in a vein of merriment, a light semi-
jocular style, characterised by that sort of playful fondness for com-
; erents which is evinced in calling them “boys?” ...Is it
generally felt that such levity of expression in narratives of military
carnage is advisable for the mutual encouragement of those who may be
called upon to engage in it or to contribute to its expenses?, The idea,
involved in the term “boys” applied to troops in action, that war is
only a plucky puerile game, certainly suggests quite a cheerful view of
an employment which consists in the interchange of diabolical outrages.
It does not appear to be thought expedient to call a man who goes to
the stake, or the block, for his creed or his country, a “boy”, Phy;
sicians who risk their lives in combating a pestilence, are not deemed
suitable persons to be denominated “boys.” An army-surgeon who
coolly operates under fire, and thus shows more courage, than anybod
else in the regiment, is the last person in it that anybody would thi
of styling a “boy.” It is therefore not necessary to the exertion of
bravery that men should be cheered on to run into the cannon's mouth
with the thoughtless impetuosity inspiring the sort of hero who is
commonly called a “boy,” but might with much greater propriety be
called a fool. - -
Anybody endowed with both "... brains must object as much
to being termed a “boy” as Coriolanus did. Juvenile boxers, at
Eton and elsewhere, may well enough be applauded as “brave boys;”
but in the word “boy” applied to a grown soldier, and in all the rest
of the sprightly cant which disguises war's realities, there lurks a very
despicable and disgusting humbug.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INHospitaLITY TO PUNCH.
AssionATELY indignant, yet not
less in sorrow than in anger,
we cut the subjoined para-
graph out of a newspaper:-
“Punch AND JUDY at a Dis-
count in Oxford.—On º,
sº the proprietor of a Punc
and Judy establishment announced
at the close of his performances
in the High Street that, after ob-
taining the very gracious permis-
sion of the Right Worshipful the
Mayor to perform “for one day,
º for one day only, his receipts
amounted to threepence, which he
intended to spend in cakes for
Toby, after which he should leave
this ancient and loyal city with
disgust, and betake himself to
tney, Woodstock, Banbury, or
some such spirited places, where
the people had sense to appreciate,
and means to encourage native
talent.”
We are sorry for the bad
taste of the Oxford public,
exhibited in their insensibility
to the attractions of the
Drama, that is to say, that
S- Drama which is the chief of
- 2. ramas, and which the
- - - most enthusiastic adorer of
the divine, WILLIAMs, himself must acknowledge to be Al... Our
anger we, hereby vent on the head of the unintelligent Magistrate
sarcastically above described as the Right Worshipful the Mayor,
who can have no more right to be worshipped than an old image. Any
well-constituted, image, indeed, would have displayed more sympathy
with Punch and Judy than the little which was evinced by the worse
wooden civic i. who limited their performance to one da
only. Nobody pan be regarded as a man of worship who has himse
noveneration for established institutions, among which one of the
§. generally esteemed and acknowledged is Punch and judy's
ow.
The MAYOR of Oxford must henceforth figure in our street drama
alºng with the Churchwarden, the Constable, Jack Ketch, and the
other adversaries whom Punch demolishes previous to his final triumph
over the enemy of Man.
CROWNER'S QUEST QUERIES.
SoME of those who are honoured by being our contemporaries have
been making some rather severe remarks upon the sort of questioning
in which divers Attorneys (begging the world's pardon for using such
a word during holidays when peace and happiness should prevail)
indulge themselves, and earn their pay, before a Coroner's Jury. Our
contemporaries allege that some of these persons ask questions of a
ridiculous character, and are evidently bent upon getting a reputation
for keenness and perseverance, rather than #". eligiting truth. Mr.
Punch, who defends the Attorneys upon all occasions, is grieved to
read such charges, and declares them to be wholly unfounded. If
Attorneys go on in the following kind of way, for instance, it is arro-
gance in the non-professional mind to, suppose that the legal mind has
not some subtle intent, and to doubt that it is º headlong into
the well at the bottom of which Truth is known to lie.

Mr. S. I will stand here until Christmas, Sir, but I will have my

Witness. No, Sir.
Mr. S. Do you wish to have a family? -

you whether you wish for a family?...

Mr. S. I tell you once more, don't tell me what you are told. Do
you sleep well at nights? -
Witness, Depends on what I’ve had for supper, Sir. ---
Mr. S. More equivocation. Now I don't ask that question without
a reason.
Mr. Wriggles. I’m glad to hear that. -
Mr. S. Keep your insolent imputations to yourself. If this man does
not sleep well at night, he must be drowsy in the day-time, and if I can
fix him with that peculiarity, I think I shall make you laugh on the
wrong side of your mouth. - -
Mr. Wriggles. My mouth has no wrong side, but my friend may find
that my tongue has a rough side. ,
Coroner. Gentlemen, tempus fugit, Go on.

Mr. S. I shall, at the present stage, ask this witness only one other
question, but he is not to be spirited out of the way, as I shall want
him again. - - - --

Mr. S. O, I dare say. I wouldn't be a glass of rum in your way,
Now, MR. TEMPERANCE, answer this. What is the average gradient
of the sleepers on your line, deducting cradles, and allowing metals for

At this point the inquiry was adjourned, for the twenty-third time.

ANCIENT AND MODERN QUACKS.
THE Builder says that among the relics of the ancient
Romans who inhabited. Uriconium, lately, dug up at
Wroxeter, is included “an advertising medium of one
of their quack doctors.” According to our constructive
contemporary:-
“There is a º bearing a Latin inscription to the follow-
ing effect:—“The libanum of TIBERIus CLAUDIUs, the phy-
sician, for all complaints of the eyes, to be used with egg."
The likeness between ancient and modern quackery,
evidenced by the foregoing specimen of an antique
Roman puff, is striking. A hard name, which, stand-
ing alone, might be supposed to. have been coined in
the mint of a British patent-medicine-monger, is given
to the specific advertised. It is alleged to be a remedy
for all complaints of the eyes, without exception, The
proprietor styles himself *the physician,” exactly, no
§. as our worthy friend GRIFFITHs, Jones, now in
trouble on the charge of having forged a will, dubbed
himself doctor, and as other impostors, unfortunately
at large, also pretend to a medical degree, which, it
they have any such thiſ was bought at a disreputable
German University. Then the quack calls .
TIBERIUs CLAUDIUs. He was of course as much a
member of the family of the CLAUDII as the fellow
whose vile puffs, pollute so many of our contempº-
raries, especially the º papers, is connected with
that *. is the oldest in the English Peerage. As of
old, so now, Quack is Quack and Rogue is. Rogue
self branded with the same indications of infamy all
the world over.
A Gratis Suggestion.
| M.R. Punch wonders why in these imitative days
nobody has taken a hint from the }; title of ope
remarkable book, “Why Paul Ferroll killed his Wife.”
Could not a good Adelphi farce be founded on the
inquiry “Why Paul Bedford killed his Pig.”
A REFORMER WHERE LEAST EXPECTED.
Might we inquire what has become of the Financial
Reform Association? The only surviving member of it
seems to be the Sultan, for he is apparently the only
person of the * day who is going in seriously
}. financial reforms.
PATIENCE is a female virtue, nowhere so conspicuous
as at the dressing-table.
BOSH FROM THE BALTIC.
It is said that the King of Sweden, CHARLEs THE FIFTEENTH, has
been induced by our Elected friend the Pamphleteer of Paris, to enter
into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with France. That the *.
late visit to the Pamphleteer had this object, and that in order to make
things look serene, KING CHARLEs ran over to London, and received
the cold shoulder from our Court, which was up to the dodge. That
LORD PALMERSTON, being somehow compelled to attend a dinner at
the Swedish ambassador's, at which Rex was present, was “icy,” and

“CORRECT * CARD' OF THE REGATTA, SIR "
MRS, ROCHEFOUCAULD'S MAXIMS.
Women's feelings are more intense than those of men'
We are happy or miserable: at a ball or at home.
A woman hates a question, but loves to ask one.
The female mind is too poetical to be tamely Fºl.
|Who would marry a woman who punctuated her love-
| letters?
Cupid is blind to everything—save pin-money.
In society compliments are loans, which the lenders
expect to be repaid with heavy interest.
Praise a woman's taste, and you may attack her sense
with impunity.
Your candid friend has never anything pleasant to say
to * He reminds you of his pet virtue, by wounding you
with it.
If you want to know a woman's true character, linger ||
after the guests have gone, and listen to what she has to
say about them.
A woman wins, an old man by listening to him; and a
young man by talking to him.
Enjoy to-day, for to-morrow the first grey hair may come.
Hymen is only Cupid in curl papers.
Women confess little faults, that their candour may cover
great ones.
There are no reasons which explain love; but a thousand
which explain marriage.
Age is venerable in man—and would be in woman-
if she ever became old.
When a woman vows that she never flirts—she is flirting.
Maternal Advice.
A DAUGHTER is almost always right when she endeayours
to imitate her mother; but we do not think the mother is
equally right, when, at a certain period of life, she tries all
she can to imitate her daughter.
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“DURING the tº autumnal exodus from town, while port-
manteaus are being packed, passports viséd, and beards grown, your

engaged, and which some weeks ago he began to describe in these
pages. It was, if you remember, while on the shores of the Mediter-
ranean, that my narrative was interrupted by the stern duties of a
London season. , Be pleased therefore to suppose me returned to
Porto-Franco, and in the company of MR. RichARD DEyBERRY, late
of Trin. Čoiſ. Cam., my comrade. of voyage, as our cicerone (who
thinks he is up in all the English idioms) insists on calling him.
“As the weather was still .* warm, and walking before sunset
almost impossible, Dick, whose devotion to the fair sex interfered
sadly with that proper attention and enthusiasm with which the monu:
ments of º should be studied, MASTER DICK I say used
frequently at the close of the day to drag me forcibly into the Piazza,
under, pretence of looking at the Fontana Vecchia by moonlight; but
in reality to show me how many of our countrywomen he knew, as they
paced up and down in company with their heavy Papas, or solemn
whiskered brothers, enjoying the strains of military music by the light
of a thousand brilliant lamps.
“Do you see that tall girl in blue?” said MR. DEwBERRY one
evening, ‘that is Miss WYMPole STREETE, LADY LOUNGER's daughter
by her first husband. She was engaged to young LoRD RAIKEsMERE

Tuscan, "Non c'e fritta, Sºgnor,” said the waiter in hurried intervals, as
he rushed about, ‘quest un caffe—si trova frittata-nella traitoria,
Signor.” “Oh dam!' remarked MR. DEwBERRY...'Ice-glace you know.
‘Yessare, verriwell, cosa desidera, Sºgnor P. Gelati di Citrone, vanilla,
marrenna, groseille, fragole, lamponi, arancia, limone, crema?” said the
waiter in one breath, and then rushed off without waiting for an
answer.
“‘Always the way here, Sir, said a stout gentleman, sitt ; near,
confound the fellows! Been here three nights running, and haven't
been able to get an ice yet, nor see the Galignani once. , Actually three

Vity.

waiting about three quarters of an hour, the music had ceased, and we

“‘Flirting about the Piazza with pretty girls is all very well,” said
I, one morning to MR. DEwBERRY, “but as Paterfamilias will naturally
expect you to have done something while you are away, I advise you to

he eat, and a register of the civility of the landlord at each inn. He
offered it to thirteen publishers in succession, and was much disgus

the ‘stile Signorile’ and the ‘stile Amichevole,’ but happening to
knock at Dick's door one morning before he was up, when the room
smelt very strongly of Latakia, and noticing an empty bottle labelled
‘Wieur Cognac' on the table, I naturally inferred that the irr rity
was not confined to the verbs, and that in consequence of their devotion
to the ‘stile Amichevole, their studies on the previous night had not

found the Professor a very jolly dog, and that he had assisted him in
framing the plot of “La figlia del Sorciotore, a drama lately produced
with thrilling effect at the Teatro Ducale, in Porto Franco, and founded,
it must be confessed, upon an old English ballad once popular in
Covent Garden.
“On the same floor which we inhabited, Monsieur and MADAME
RöDEUR had hired apartments, and were living together with their son,
an ingenuous youth fresh from the Quartier Latin, and their amiable
and accomplished daughter, of whose skill in performing on the piano
(she had planted it on acoustic principles against the door which joined
our rooms) I was constantly reminded.
“They had sent us an enamelled and elaborately flourished card
bearing their name, and Dick, who never loses an opportunity of
exhibiting his proficiency in the French language, insisted that we
should return their call, which we did, and thus made their acquaint- |
ance.

regrets to find his brother hotel-keepers too often indulge. ‘Hous con-
cerez, M'sieur,” he would say on occasion when he had to wait for his
dinner, or his boots were neglected," if thees ad coom to appen at de
Cygne noir, my chef should be chassé dirrrrrect.” (Here I may remark
in a parenthesis that having some experience of the ‘Service’ at the
last-mentioned hostelry, my inference is that the post of chef must
change hands every day).
“M. RöDEUR fils finds ample occupation for his time during the
vacation, by consuming tobacco in a chaste pipe of his own design, and
teaching his good-natured sister to accompany him on the piano in the
admired ballad of the “Château de Framboisy,’ ‘Messrs. les Etudiants,’
and other national and interesting, songs. for Madame-I don't
envy the man who is shut * in the coupé of a diligence with her—
as was once my fate. The brilliancy of that lady's conversation is
hardly equalled by its length, and the manner in which she discusses her
lunch is scarcely calculated to increase an appetite for your own.
Surely there never were such indefatigable sight-seers. They are
always up at sunrise—as I never failed to hear—when poor, JEANETTE
is finely rated if the breakfast is not ready. “Oh Dieu /’ the unhappy
bonne cried to me in confidence one day, ‘fa m'embºte affreusement?”
They never forgive themselves or pay their cicerone if a single church
is left unvisited, or one picture unseen. . The hackney coachmen at
Porto Franco know them well, and must be very hard up for a fare,
before they consent to be hired by their party. Dopo domane,” the
impudent dogs say with a back-handed shake of three fingers, when
MADAME RöDEUR begins to bargain—or Bel’ forestiere, per Bacco/”
as Monsieur JULEs offers them half their fare.
“RöDEUR ainé began life as an artist, and sketches extensively in a
vigorous and dotty style peculiar to himself: “Un §et-coucher de soleil
—Marseilles,’ ‘Deur gaminsen combatdans la rue—Florence,” “Un morceau
du Colysée— ,’ ‘Téted undnea Capri,’ ‘Souvenir d'un Tintoretà Hénise,’
‘Wielle de Bologne,’ &c., &c., &c., are among the subjects treated by his
graceful pencil. The time, the place, the object to be drawn, makes
not the slightest difference to the enthusiastic amateur. He was once
§. under arrest for persisting to sketch, the Pope during Mass at the
istine Chapel, and nearly got his head broken for running about—
pencil in hand—after a pretty looking Contadina whose costume he
thought would be a valuable addition to his album.
“They always dined at 2 P.M., and my only wonder is that after such
a tremendous repast they were enabled to renew their exertions until
the next morning. The amount, of solid food which they consumed
daily would surprise those who still retain the notion once rife in our
E § nurseries, viz: that frogs form the staple article of consump-
tion at French dinner-tables, "I happened to look, in once at their
feasting-hour and found the room a chaos of innumerable dishes, havin
the appearance of several courses combined in one for the sake o
brevity. Old RöDEUR overwhelmed me with apologies for the con-
fusion, and took care to let me know in the course of conversation that
their ménage at Havre was of a totally different character, inasmuch as
there they dined off Sèvres and the most costly plate with fifteen glasses
a-head for the different kinds of wine.

IMPERIAL BULL-FIGHTING,
“IMPERIAL BULL-FIGHTING.—The ExPERoR, letters from Biarritz state, was
present at a bull-fight on Sunday last, but the EMPREss did not leave the villa, as
the day was the anniversary of her sister's death... The EMPERoR was accompanied
by M.M.E. DE LA Bedoyºkº and another lady of the Court, MARshal NIEL, Count

John BULL an animal of peaceful habits,
Warring, by his own will, on pheasants, hares

But that though loath to quarrel for a trifle,
And glad to hold out fellowship's right hand,
He still keeps in his left a loaded rifle,
For those, who speaking peace, hide the bare brand,

But sure he should be the last man to flout them,
With such a taste for Bull-fight exhibitions—
That he can’t live at Biarritz without them.

PITY FOR POOR SMOKERS.
. THE attention of Mr. Punch has been called to a recent police-case
in which a poor carpenter, summoned before MR. DAYMAN, at Wands-
worth, was fined 10s. and costs for persisting in smoking in a railway
e. The man could not pay the money; had to embrace the
alternative of fourteen days' imprisonment; and actually underwent a
seclusion of thirty hours, when he was released, the fine having been
paid for him by a benevolent merchant-prince and smoker,
Now, if this man º in smoking when he was told to leave off,
the Magistrate could have had nothing to do but to fine him; particu.
larly if, at the time of the offence, he was sober. But whereas a 40s.
fine is no matter to a smoking swell, fourteen days' imprisonment is
what a working man might well describe as hard lines.
Smoking on railways is a common practice—we grant the ghost of
JAMES THE FIRST a common nuisance. It may vex the shade of the
British SoLQMON; and it may annoy some ladies, whose noses may not
agree with the nose of Dr. Morgan, in Roderick Random, in the im-
pression that tobacco is a fragrant and odoriferous herb.
Therefore Railway Companies are hereby pathetically implored to

RUDE CRITICISM on A CRITIC.—“Le vrai bonheur sur la Terre, c'est
d'être sur Mer.” So quotes our friend, JULEs-JANIN. Aboard the
Folkestone boat, and in the intervals of bawling for a basin, our other
friend, BUMPKIN QUAIMY, was heard to grow] that the Frenchman's
love of epigram led him to write the most inf-amous nonsense.
HERE 'S YOUR FINE TURNIPS ]
A. PITIFUL story is related by the South Eastern Gazette, under the
heading of “Severe Sentence.” It sets forth that on Monday last
week a “poor shabbily dressed widow,” one JULIA GARRAway, with
whom was her child about six years of *: was charged, before the
Rochester County Bench, represented by the Rev. J.J. MARSHAM and
MR. DAY, with having, stolen four small turnips from the field, of
MR. R. Tassell, Smallridge Farm. The woman acknowledged that
she had taken the turnips to eat. Two of them she threw away because
they were full of insects. The other two she kept, and was beginni
to devour them when one of the farm-men took her up.. Having, wit
her child, been lodged in the station-house, and therein imprisoned one
whole day and one whole night, MRs. GARRAWAY was placed at the bar
of Justices' justice; when :-
“The two turnips found on her were produced, and were very small. The
risoner pleaded hard to be forgiven, as she took them to satisfy her hunger, having
; come from London. The Magistrates, however, ordered her to pay a penalty,
ncluding costs, of 7s. 2d., and, in default, committed her for seven days' hard labour.
As the prisoner had no money, the Magistrates desired her to pay the fine and costs
on her return from hop-picking, which she vehemently promised to do.”
The poor Magistrates, called upon in the discharge of their duty to
adjudicate on cases such as the above-quoted one, are very much to be
pitied. Of course they have no}. to dismiss the charge as trumpery,
on the ground of the maxim, “De minimis non curat lear,” translated, for
the benefit of the country gentleman, prosecutor in the case, “The law
takes no account of diminutive turnips.” In the present instance they
manifestly could have had no choice but to fine the prisoner unless to
commit her, instead; which perhaps they might as well have done,
committing her child º her as an accomplice. For, in prison,
mother and child would both have been well fed; necessarily if their
sentence included hard labour: which cannot be performed on low diet.
That, no doubt, was the reason why, from a humane motive, they did
add hard labour to the conditional imprisonment which they awarded
her in default of payment, The only wonder is, that the famishin
creature did not embrace the alternative. Perhaps her pride objecte
to accept the situation of a common thief. . .
We now turn to another and more pleasing view of the case, the
aspect which it presents in an agricultural point of view. How valuable
must be the turnips grown by MR. R. TASSELL to have made it worth
that gentleman's while to prosecute a º: woman for taking two
or three of them to eat ' This, just now, is the newspaper season for
enormous turnips, among which those of Mr.TAssei, abovementioned
might be classed, but for the fact that . were, on the contrary, very
small. But that circumstance only heightens, the idea of their value
suggested by the prosecution of a “poor shabbily dressed widow” for
. them. They must be worth at least as much as good West
Indian pine-apples, which sell in the streets of London at “a shilling
a-piece and a penny a-slice.” Their price, so little dependent on their
size, must be i. to their flavour, which is no doubt delicious.
Among the produce exhibited next Christmas at the Fat Cattle Show
a prominent place will surely be occupied by MR. Tassell’s remarkable
turnips.
ARMS AND THE MAN.
DU CHAILLU tells how the Gorilla
With a rifle he shot in the chest,
Where a rifle-ball’s certain to kill a
Man or monkey, as must be confest.
But GRAY, that unwearied attacker
Öfiju Čºriºu GoRILLA, and Co.,
Says the man monkey's wounds in the back are,
And the weapon employed—the long-bow.
Rather Down in the Mouth.
WE see that a cheap advertising Dentist offers to “stop teeth at a
shilling a-piece.”. The force of cheapness can scarcely go much lower.
There is a class of purchasers so ravenous after cheapness that it is only
necessary to offer a thing cheaply for them instantly to avail themselves
of it. Let one of those peripatetic London Bridge merchants, whose
shop consists of a tray slung round his neck, offer them a sovereign for
a penny, and they § eagerly snatch at it. The above remedy, how;
ever, is so unusually cheap and Pºlº nasty,.. that we should
say that it must almost be “too filling” at the price.”
NON-INTERVENTION.
THERE is a talk of the Salt Lake joining the Confederates. We
think the Mormon Capital is wrong. Let it secede, if it will; but it is
not fair to join either party. It should be true to its own name, and
consistently prove that it only wishes to remain, equally on both sides,
an Utah (a neuter).

RITEFLYING AT SEA.
THERE are many people in the world who are adepts at flying
“kites.”. But the kites they fly not seldom bring them into danger,
whereas the kites to which the following paragraph refers, are flown
for the sole object of getting persons out of it:-
“Some interesting experiments have been made at Portsmouth from the launch
of HER MAJESTY's ship Britannia, off the harbour's mouth, to test the efficiency of
the plan proposed by LIEUT. G. S. NAREs, senior Lieutenant of the Britannia, for
forming a communication between a stranded ship and a lee shore. LIEUT. NAREs's
plan consists simply of a kite with two lines. Of the two lines of the kite, one is
made fast in the usual manner in the centre of the kite and the other at the bottom.
If the object be to send a hawser to the top of a cliff, supposing that the surf breaks
too heavily at the cliff's base for any one to land, as was }. case in the wreck of the
#. the kite is given sufficient line to fly over the highest point of the
cliff, and when sufficiently far inland the line from its centre, by which it has been
flown, is let go, and the one made fast to the foot of the kite, being held on, brings
the kite to the ground, and places in the hands of the people on shore the line
with which a hawser can be sent from the stranded vessel, a boatswain's cradle
º, and ultimately the crew of the ship rescued. If again, on the other hand,
a ship lies stranded on a low coast, with her boats destroyed, the kite is sent on
shore towing through the water a man, a raft, or any other object to be saved. The
trials had reference to a ship placed in the latter position, and were of a most satis.
factory character. As a final test, LIEUT. NAREs jumped overboard from the launch
with the line from the kite made fast to a selvage strop under his arms, and was
towed over the intervening distance between the boat and the shore, over deep
water and through the surf, in perfect ease and safety, without even the necessity
of moving an arm to assist himself in his progress or keep him afloat.”
There is nothing at all funny or facetious in this narrative, and the
question may be asked, How came it, then, in Punch & But as Punch
has Christian readers, a plan for saving life must have somewhat of
interest for them; and they may rely upon its being worth their know-
ledge, or it would not have gained a prize, in acknowledgment of its
merit, from the Shipwrecked Fishermen's Benevolent Society, which
Punchis pleased to ſeam has really been the case. There are some
fools in the world who think that Punch's mission only is to joke, and
that he Qught to keep his pen from matters that are serious. Well, to
say good things is... but to do them is far better; and the man who
by his wits has perfected a project for saving a few lives, is much more
to be envied than the man whose wits have helped him to make a
million jokes. Punch is ever pleased to give insertion to good things,
and as LIEUT. NAREs’s plan for saving shipwrecked life is one of ić
best, things that Punch for months has heard of, he feels of course
i. pleasure in helping its publicity, and, as the equinoctial gales are
rawing nigh at hand, in assisting by so doing to avert their ill effects.
DELICACY AND GENEROSITY CHARMINGLY COMBINED.
THE following, which we copy out of a Dublin paper, is far too good
to be lost:—
THE Gentleman who took a Pocket-Book from the person of an indi-
vidual at stown on WEDNESDAY EVENING last, is requested to return,
through the Post, the Papers and Documents which it contained, with the exception
of the egg which he may retain, as a reward for the dexterity he exhibited on the
occasion. The Individual feels grateful to the Gentleman for having left him his
Watch and Chain. Address “ , Kinsley's Hotel, Church Lane.”
We wonder the advertiser didn't ask the “Gentleman” to dinner,
in order that they might have the opportunity, of talking the little
matter over a cool bottle of champagne. We really believe that thieves
(we beg pardon, gentlemen) would be a better-bred set of people if
they were always treated with civility equal to the above. There is
nothing like appealing to a person's gentlemanly feelings. If we only
took to thieves (we meant to say, gentlemen) in the same natural wa
that they take to us, we are sure, that we should meet on a muc
friendlier footing, and be able to exchange civilities that would be pro-
ably agreeable on both sides. Only think what a deal of stolen
property would be returned! You would º to the thief's sense
of honour so strongly, that he would ultimately give up thieving as a
losing concern.
Prudent Precaution, However.
THE Pamphleteer is stated to be advising the Finns to agitate for a
re-annexation of Finland to Sweden. What can Sweden want fins for?
Surely not to help her to swim away, from the floating batteries of
Toulon, or any other possible friendly visitors from France. The
Moniteur is requested to be prompt with a disavowal.

NO REFORM OF THE
“MR. PUNCH,
“UNFORTUNATELY, the Report of the Select Committee on
the Income-Tax, has not quite settled the absurd question which has
been raised by fools concerning the unnecessary readjustment of the
most just of taxes. At one of the late gatherings of the British Asso-
ciation, the practicability and requisiteness of that impossible and
undesirable process were asserted by many speakers who ought to have
known better. Your readers will be disgusted to find DR. FARR
endorsing theº: demand of the commercial and professional
classes for differential taxation. The subjoined tissue of extravagant
proposals advanced by MR. D. CHADwick, will probably provoke their
mirth as well as their contempt. M.R. CHADwick, according to the
report of the proceedings, agreed with DR. FARR in the insane per-
suasion ‘that the system of capitalising incomes was the proper one on
which the tax should be levied.’ He expressed the idiotic opinion that
‘the inequalities in the administration of the law were the occasion o
all the annoyances, injustice, and misery complained of,’ and he had
also the incredible folly to say that ‘ those who paid the tax should have
the appointment of assessors.’ And then:—
“He proposed,—first, to make the tax at one uniform rate on the capitalised
value of all incomes; secondly, to º the various sources of incomes according
to their general average market value; thirdly, to assess the tax by a rate on such
capitalised value, instead of the present mode of assessing it on the annual
income; fourthly, to§§ as far as practicable, the principle of the Government
legacy duty tables to xed incomes; fifthly, that the tax should be applied to all
incomes above £50 a-year, and stopped by the employers out of the wages and
salaries of all persons in their service.”
INCOME-TAX!
“All the ineptitudes projected in the above extract from the out-
ous prolusion of MR. CHADwick, are based on the negation of the
self-evident truths, thus expressed by a contemporary philosopher,
‘that income is income, whatever its source, its tenure, or its duration,
and that a tax on incomes ought to be assessed irrespectively of the
supposed private circumstances of the individuals or classes by whom
they are received.”. These ‘elementary, truths’ have been repeatedly
demonstrated by the simple method of boldly stating them. There is
nothing like it. -
“. It is not at all inexpedient to make the preceding axioms ‘the
subject of habitual, controversy,” because the more they are contro-
verted the more undeniable they will appear to anybody who has the
perception to see them, being, blest with a tolerable understanding and
a permanent income. The ‘fact, that a precarious income is less
valuable than a perpetuity of the same nominal amount,” must be
acknowledged to be “undoubted.” Indeed, one might almost go so far
as to say that there can be no reasonable doubt about it. But that
only proves that the earner of a precarious income cannot afford to pay
as much Income-Tax as the receiver of a perpetual one. The question
is, not what he can afford, but how much he can be made to pay; because
the less he pays, the more must be exacted from others who are better
off than himself, but not more willing to contribute to the revenue.
“The supposition, entertained i. half-educated, and half-witted
persons, subsisting by the exercise of their small abilities, that preca-
rious incomes ought to be less heavily taxed than those which are
permanent, rests on the ridiculous postulate, too generally conceded,
that people ought to be taxed in proportion to their means. This
fallacy is unhappily somewhat countenanced by the existing exemption
from Income Tax of incomes under £100. Yet, as the owner of free-
hold or funded property bringing in £99.19s. 11; d. pays nothing
whatever, whereas the earner of £100 pays 6d. in the pound; even here
in some measure is recognised the righteous principle of disproportionate
assessment. - - - - -
“The system of levying Income-Tax on capitalised incomes, as
advocated by DR. FARR and MR. CHADwick, would substitute a
property-tax for an Income-Tax. Of course all persons would then be
ised according tº their means; which wºuld be a dreadfully “mis-
chievous crror.’ Insufficient means constitute a good reason why a
poor man should not live at the same rate, as a rich, one, but they are
no reason whatever why he should not be just as hi ily taxed. This
consideration opens up a view to one method of equalising the Income.
Tax which would be reasonable enough; that of levying on all incomes
the same absolute amount; or an amount so nearly the same as a sum
that shall not exceed the income itself. If, indeed, the rule of propor.
tion to means is to be observed at all, let the proportion be inverse,
and precarious incomes be the most heavily taxed. For ‘a precarious
income pays only a precarious tax, and a life income only a life tax,
while hereditary and perpetual incomes yield an ever, recurring per-
centage to the State.” . Accordingly, impose the higher tax on pre-
carious and terminable incomes, that you may make the most, of the
precarious Income-Tax payer before he dies or is ruined. When his
means of subsistence fail him, and, the Income-Tax having deprived
him of all that he could have saved, he is bein sold up, with the work-
house or starvation, staring him and his family in the face, you, may
console him by telling him that his Income-Tax has ceased with his
income, and mock his misery: which will be good fun. - - - -
“Perhaps the Income-Tax is not so bitterly execrated as it is said to
be. Evasion under Schedule D. is confessedly, uncommon. It may be
practised here and there by an unscrupulous fellow who says to himself,
Really this tax is too absurd an imposition. Of course I ought not to
cheat the Government, but then neither ought I to cheat myself; and

if, on the one hand, I owe my country my just contribution, to its
expenses, on the other it is my patriotic duty to offer all the resistance
I can to a public swindle.” Few doubtless are they who act on this
crroneous reasoning. There is perhaps one class of precarious incomes
which in some instances may not be quite correctly returned under
Schedule D. These are the incomes of thieves and pickpockets; who,
however, when they repent and abandon, their dishonest courses, no
doubt remit all their unpaid Income-Tax to the CHANCELLOR OF THE

one halfpenny in theº on the capitalised value of all incomes
would produce £20,000,000 per annum.” . Against the scheme of
capitalising the yalue of all incomes in order to subject it tº the extor-

THREE BOWS TO A STRING.
THE subjoined advertisement, copied from the Glasgow Herald, is
rather more amusing than intelligible:–
ATRIMONY.—Three Young Gentlemen, wishing to commence busi-
ness in Glasgow, are desirous to meet with a Young Lady, possessed of good
looks, an amiable temper, and a few hundred pounds, with a view to Matrimony.
The Lady will have her choice of the three Gentlemen. Address “Trio,” —
On behalf of numerous lovely beings who have applied to us with a
request to procure them suitable emplo ent, we should like to know
whether the three young gentlemen who wish to commence business,
and who advertise for a wife amongst them, intend trading as partners,
or whether the partnership contemplated is to be simply matrimonial,
between the young lady and the young gentleman she may select out
of the “Trio.”. Do they, for commercial or domestic reasons, desire to
have a wife in the firm, or is their advertisement a speculation in which
they have joined by clubbing together the means of paying for its
insertion, in order to É. one of them the chance of getting a wife with

be the opinion of any young lady possessing a few hundred pounds,

her portion in her pocket than invest it in any engagement with “Trio,”
or with one of the Triad, inasmuch as in such a transaction the odds
against her would be three to one. Two to one, however, is the sign or

that the business which “Trio” propose to commence may be that of

HOW TO MAKE A WATERING-PLACE PLEASANT TO WISITORS, PARTICULARLY INVALIDS,
(A Hint to the Powers that be at Sandbath.)
Time, 6:30 A.M.
FUN AT EAST BRENT.
ANNUALLY, for the last four years about this time, at East Brent,
Somersetshire, a harvest home, got up by the vicar, the famous ARCH-
DEACON DENISON, has been celebrated with much festivity. This year
the East Brent Harvest Home is reported to have been pººl;
festive. A Bishop made a joke | THE RIGHT REv. The LöRD Bishop
of BATH AND WELLs (BARON AUCKLAND), after dinner, in answering
to the toast of the Bishop and Clergy, took occasion to say:-
“This year we were not obliged to buy as last year, and if we did so buy a great
deal of money would go to Bull Run. (Laughter.) We knew enough of Bull Run
without being desirous of allowing money to run there for corn. (Itenewed laughter).”
Bravo! Lord Bishop:—
Your attempt at a pun
That you made upon “run,”
Was uncommon good fun,
- Therefore Punch owes you onc.
Two words of different meanings and the same sound in the same
sentence—according to that definition of a pun, the Bishop's was per-
fect. Certainly it quite achieved the end of all punning; which is
and ever was to create amusement and to set the table in a roar. May
we never make a worse. . It is the fashion to affect contempt for puns.
The poor conundrums of the time want countenance; so again, Bravo
Bishop ! It was a former Bishop of BATH AND WELLs who sang:—
“Ineed no roast but a nut-brown toast
To keep me from the cold;
I am so wrapped, and thoroughly lapped
In jolly good aic and old.”
And when he was in that state no doubt he made puns.
. The Ven. Chairman himself also came out if not exactly as a regular
joker, yet in a considerably jocose style. Having proposed the health
of the Wolunteers—
“He added that he had never much fear of invasion, but if hostile Frenchmen
set foot on our shore, he should be inclined to forget his character as a minister of
the Church of England, and do his best to shoot them.”
By all means let the Venerable and jolly ARCHDEAcon DENIsoN
forget his clerical character, if necessary, in order to shoot foreign
invaders. We only hope that he will never forget his character as a
minister of the Church of England in affecting that of a Roman Catholic
priest. May his fighting, as a volunteer of the Church militant ever
remain limited to the field of theological polemics. If, however, he
should ever be called upon to wield the rifle instead of the pen, and,
instead of combating clerical opponents, to do battle with invading
foreigners, we trust that he will roye himself a hero of the Church
triumphant; and that his comrade in glory will be the reverend artil-
leryman whose name appears in the paragraph hereinunder quoted:–
“The Rev. T. Hugo, ºn of the oldest volunteer regiment, the Hon. Artil-
lory Company, also responded. In case of an invasion, he expressed his intention
of .."; his black cassock side by side with the red coat, and sharing the victory
or defeat.”
The victory of course, brave Hugo, and reverend as brave. We
shall have the pleasure of hailing you victor, and then of course your
name will go down to posterity as the British VICTOR HUGO. We
can't help saying so. Quits to the Bishop of BATH AND WELLs'

PROFESSOR OWEN ON RELICS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“IN a literary notice of a new book, entitled Alpine *.
allusion is made to a circumstance which should be related to the
Ultramontanes—a heretic would perhaps say to the Ultramarines. We
are informed that—
“At the inn on the Riffel the author met Professor Owen, who gave an amusing
account of his visit to Cologne, and his examination of the vast collection of the
(so-called) bones of the 11,000 Virgins, there religiously preserved in the Church of
St. Ursula. The Professor announced the collection to consist of the remains of
various descriptions of creatures, amongst which horses and asses, cats and dogs,
had numerous representatives.”
“Everybody, of course, knows that the relics which have been for ages
prº &l. by the piety of an enlightened clergy, as the bones
of ll,000 Virgins, are really the osseous, remains of that number of
fritish maidens, “all bound from Cornwall to be married in Armorica,
carried by tempests up the Rhine to the city of Cologne, and there
martyred by an army of Huns under Attila.’. How is, it that bones
which Catholic tradition has attributed to the human subject, are found
by PROFEssoR Owen to have been derived from the lower animals?
“A little while ago, a very profound theologian, animadverting, under
the signature of CogiTANs, in the Tablet, on Essays and Reviews, sug-
gested, in order to account for certain geological facts which, according
to infallible dogma, ought not to be, that, during the formation of the
world, the fossil remains of the ichthyosaurus, megatherium, and such
like extinct animals, may possibly have been transported hither from
some other planet, and interpolated among the strata constituting our
earth's crust, by the devil. According, to this conjecture, when the
crust of the earth was fashioned, the Author of Evil had a finger in the
pie. He put these fraudulent fossils into it, and the i. who, on
those fallacious evidences, assign to the globe a º her antiquity,t
what the Church allows, may be supposed to have been deceived and
misled into that heresy by a scientific imposture, the work of diabolical
agency.
“If we adopt the foregoing theory, which obviously commends itself
to common sense, we can have little difficulty in concluding that the
horses', asses', cats', and dogs’ bones discovered, on examination by
Pāorksson Owen, to constitute the collection of relics exhibited to
him as those of the Cologne Virgins, were, just so many surreptitious
osteological specimens, with which the devil baited his trap to catch a
philosopher.
“The only conceivable objection to this hypothesis lies in the question,
what could have become of the genuine Virgins’ bones? The devil, of
ºursº, durst not touch, those holy relics with his own paws; it is,
º to be concluded that he instigated somebody to put them out
OI the Way.
“ST. tisula's Church contains her tomb. If that were opened, I
should, not be at all surprised if it proved to enclose the skeleton of a
small she-bear. In the same sacred edifice the heads of the Three Magi
are also exhibited. Tº: too, might have been replaced with the
crania of º: ! PROFEssoR Owen examined them, and

"P.S. When the relics of a Saint are ‘translated, do not suppose

AN IRISH BULL FROM FRANCE.
ONE of the º of being in high station is, that public notice
is certain to be taken of your bodily infirmities, and signs of faili
youth. Thus, speaking of the EMPEROR, says a letter from Châlºns:-
“He looks older and stouter than he did in Italy, and seems to have some diffi-
culty in walking. All this does not appear when he is on horseback, but is very
visible on foot." º
Indeed, that is extraordinary! We have rarely read/a statement
more painstaking in minuteness, and where greater careſ was taken to
prevent a º of the nicely-worded truth. By º that
the EMPEROR’s “difficulty in walking” is not at all observable “when
he is on horseback,” the writer leaves small doubt that Ireland is his
birthplace, and that he is skilful in breeding Irish bulls. ...But when he
adds, that the Imperial impediment in walking is readily perceptible
when he is on foot, we must admire the bold redundancy of speech
which leaves no chance of misconceiving the intention of the text.
By the way, the EMPEROR is rather fond of bull-fights, and has
recently, at Biarritz, enjoyed the treat of seeing some. As a far less
savage pastime, we advise him to get up a,Course of Irish bull-fights,
º: invite men in his presence to contendin bloodless strife—not in
killing, but concocting the cleverest Irish,bull. , If our friendly hint be
en, and, as the EMPEROR loves Punch, we have little doubt it will,
we certainly would back the correspondent we have quoted to competé
against all comers in breeding Irish bulls.

A London Preventire Service Man taking his Three Months' Turn for the Season.
HOW TO SINK ONE'S NAME.
SHOULD GARIBALDI ever accept the command
of the Federal troops, we propose that, out of
respect to his former achievements, he should
modestly sink, his own name—or, rather, change
it, to prevent its sinking; but, at the same time
we suggest that he should adopt one that woul
still show that he was of Italian extraction. For
this purpose, we do not think he could do better
than assume the illustrious cognomen, that is
immortalised in the national anthem of Yankee
Doodle, of MAccARONI. Thus, not only would
he carefully avoid being confounded with the
Americans, but he would also flatter the dearest
prejudices of the brave troops he was com-
manding. We camot help thinking that
“LIEUTENANT-GENERAL Maccanoni. Com-
mander-in-Chief of all the Federal Forces,”
would sound extremely grand.
Union is not Always Strength.
We read that STAUFFACHER is said to have
cheered up. WILLIAM TELL with the following
words:– “ºbertuntºn wetten much tie &ºmenºn

A German is well aware, that “By union the weak
|even becomestrong.” We would whisper these
sensible words of STAUFrachen into the ears
of the Americans, if at the present moment they
were not a little deaf to reason; for in America
is not the reverse, now prevailing? There we
see in process of being pººl, “By Union the
strong even become weak.”
EFFERVESCENCE IN THE STREETS.
We don’t know if it be because we’ve had our holiday, and therefore
view with jealousy all those whom we see jº but to our mind the
street boys º unusually boisterous, and more than commonly
exuberant in their overflow of spirits. Perhaps it is they think that
as there’s “nobody in town,” they are entitled to use London exactly
as they like, and to look upon themselves as in fact its only occupants.
However this may be, º turn the pavements into playgroun
without fear of the police, and peg their tops upon our corns and run
their races round our legs, without the least show of timidity at the
sight of our clenched fist, or our clutched umbrella. Then they dance
their demon dances in the middle of the street, for now the hansoms
are laid up there’s not much dread of being driven over; and they
carry on their converse in a louder tone than ever, and keep bellowing
to each other alternate question and reply until they get at least the
length of Regent Street apart. Another favourite trick they have of
stopping some old gentleman, and meekly aski im the time; and
when after great exertion he has tugged his valuable watch out of his
fob and º informed them the exact hour of the day, instead of
reverently thanking him, they run off to their comrade, crying, “Look
'ee 'ere, j IM, 'ere’s the Ossguards Clock a-walking!”
But it is at nightfall that the boys get most rampageous. Then they
hide behind street corners and rush out on nervous people, shrieking

ate invºlusters on some kerbstone or clean doorstep, and give al fresco
oncerts ºf the newest nigger music, with the loudest h alloo that
they can howl by wº of chorus. And finally just when you’ve tumbled
into bed, and fancy that there’s nothing but the cats which can disturb
you, some horrible small fiend, (who perhaps has supped off greasy
pudding, and is suffering therefrom) stands under the lamp-post just
opposite your window, and takes out his Newgate Warbler or his Old
Bob Ridley Songsikr, and sings most melancholy solos in the most minor
of keys.

autumn there is much more effervescence about them than is usual;
and so marvellously active are they in their movements that it very
rarely happens that the fizz is taken out of them by the cuff of the
policeman or the beadle's dreaded boot.

ThE GREAT DISEASE br THE CHURCH.-Pluracy.
ABSENCE OF BODY INVOLVES ABSENCE OF FEES.
CoMMIssionER Goulburn alluded, at the Bankruptcy Court last
Wednesday, to the common practice of solicitors sending their clerks to
that Court. He said:—
“The act did not allow him to hear solicitors' clerks, nor would he do so. He
must put a stop to the custom referred to. For the future, the fee of every solicitor
º: only by his clerk would be disallowed on taxation.”
The Commissioner is very hard upon solicitors who are absent, and
very justly so. The punishment is, that no fee is to be allowed on such
peccant occasions. e do not find fault with the punishment; on the
contrary, we think it sins only on the side of mildness. However, we
jå. to see a similar punishment meted out to all defaulters of a
similar stamp. Do not barristers Fº accept large fees, and yet
never present themselves in Court? Do they ever return their fees?
We never heard of any such wonderful fee-nomenon; nor is it very easy
to make a barrister do so, inasmuch as a barrister, like a physician,
never sends in a bill, but is paid, as a crossing-sweeper is for his dirty
work, then and there upon, the spot. Consequently, there being no
bill, there might be some slight difficulty in taxing it. However, we
would summon him publicly before the Court, and apply some kind of
legal stomach-pump until such time as he disgorged what he had dis-
honestly swallowed. We should like to know if a process, something
like the one we have proposed, is fee-sible? The same sharp sauce, we
think, should be ladled out alike to the legal goose as the Çhancery
gander; that is to say, if you can call solicitors and barristers “geese”
when they studiously make it their practice of preying upon them.
Pretty goslings! e should not like to be the client to fall in their
way when any one of them returns from the Long. Vacation | What
appetites they will have, to be sure, after fasting so long !
Cruel Imposition.
THE Prussians carry on their government in Posen (so says the
Times correspondent) by means of despotism, corruption, fraud, and
“obscurantism.” So bad is the Government, that the country should be

but Imposen’.

NOT THE DIFFERENCE OF A HAIR BETWEEN THEM.
oME short time ago, at
the British Association,
PROFEssor Owen, in
the course of a lecture
delivered on the inter.
esting strangers intro-
duced into this country
by Mons. DuCHAILLU,
said:—
“The young have very
white faces, but they ac-
quire a leaden black hue

age is grey hairs, and it
may be common to both
varieties of chimpanzee.”

However, man has one decided superiority over the

leaden black hue by age.” It is so far lucky that he is free
from that particular noirceur, to which his simious brother
is unhapp º or else, supposing he were in America,
he might be sºld for a nugger. Ani yet we know many
men who share the same weakness, for certainly the older
they grow the blacker they become. The blackness is only

when one's face #" to the colour of black-lead, it would
be extremely handy to callin the housemaid, when she was
cleaning the grate, to come in and give your features a rub
with the brush!
It is fortunate that the chimpanzees have no looking-

of a chimpanzee examining himself in the glass, and disco-
yering his first grey hair, would be extremely comical.

THE FLEETING FASHION.
“MR. PUNCH,
- “A CRITICAL notice of MR. CHARLEs MATHEws's new comedy
in one of your contemporaries, contains what I may call a remarkable
- p > y
remark, viz.:-
“In the appointment of this comedy there is, as regards costume, an oversight
which is not wholly undeserving of notice. Though six months are supposed to
elapse between the first and the second acts, most of the characters come out in the
latter wearing the same dresses as in the former.”
“The office of the Drama is ‘to hold the mirror up to nature,” and
the author of the above criticism takes it for granted that the mirror
held up to existing society would of course not reflect people at the end
of six months in the same dresses as those which they had on in the
ginning.
“This assumption, the general correctness of which is too undeniable,
forms a striking commentary on the extravagance of the period.
“To anybody who is accustomed to the labour of endeavouring to
make both ends meet, otherwise than in buttoning a waistcoat over an
ºver expanding circumference, no intrinsic absurdity would be apparent
in the representation of a person in other than opulent circumstances
appearing for the second time in the self-same costume as that in which
he had first appeared for six years previously. I do not remember
when I bought the coat in id: I am now writing; but I know it was
much longer ago than that.
“Fashion, however, requires articles of dress to be discarded long,
very long, before they are half worn out. Many men even want à
change of clothing oftener than once in six months, and the flunkeys in
some establishments expect their plush to be replaced as . as

“A hat will last a careful proprietor a great while without looking

A FINE FALL IN OCTOBER.
TheRE's a good time nearly come, boys. Read the brave news which
appeared the other day in the Times:-
“PRICE of BEER.—The leading brewers of Burton have issued Circulars to their
customers, informing them that on and after the 1st of Qctober the price of ale will
be reduced 6s. per barrel, “the prospects of the harvest happily enabling them ‘to
make the reduction.’”
This time of the year is popularly, but poetically, denominated the
Fall. The leaves now begin, to fall, heavy dews fall in the mornings,
there is more or less rainfall about the time of the equinoctial gales,
and, what is rather unusual at this season, though always seasonable, a
fall has lately occurred in the rate of discount at the Bank. Partridges
now fall in considerable numbers, and showers of shooting-stars are
expected to fall about November; but the fall of beer announced for
the 1st of October, being a fall of drink, will be looked forward to with
more general interest than the fall of any meteor.
BE PARTED WITH, for the veriest trifle, a LONG ESTA-
BLISHED COLD, of a sonorous, deep-toned quality. The advertiser can highly
recommend it, as it has been in his possession now for the last three years, and
has never left him, either º or night, for a single minute. The only motive for
parting with it, is because the owner has recently joined a Choral Society, and he
finds that his fellow-students strongly object to his practising with them. Six
dozen boxes of cough lozenges will be thrown in, as a douceur, with the above.
Immediate possession can be had, and a month's trial allowed for approval. Letters
to be addressed to “A. BARRER, Esq., care of the Secretary of the Tonic Sol-Fallal-

THE STATE OF THE HOLY SEE.
THE Holy See is getting in a sadly troubled state, and the Holy
Father Pius must be getting Holy See sick. Tossed about as he has
been, and with everything around him so tempestuous and threatening,
one wonders the old gentleman does not seek some quiet haven, where
he could pass his few remaining days in comfort and in peace. It is
clear he can have neither while he keeps where he now is; and, indeed,
things look so stormy that there is a great likelihood of his fortunes
being wrecked. -
The only course of safety would be for him to fing his old tiara over-
board, and thus relieve and lighten his nearly sinking ship. If the
PoPE, would throw away his temporal possessions, a iºd hands
would instantly be stretched forth to his help, and he would quickly be
enabled to steer into smooth water, and rest in safety from the storms
which now disturb the Holy See.

head.”. Certain financiers assert that the justice of an Income Tax,

of the fact it is, probably, which has suggested that the fairer method would be to
charge the tax on expenditure in place of income, which no doubt in its incidence
AN IGNORAMUS ON THE INCOME-TAX.
“MR. PUNCH,
“THAT shallow and inexperienced financier, MR. WILSON,
was one of those impostors, or idiots who advocate the imposition of
discriminating rates upon different classes of incomes. The Economist
has lately republished a memorandum written by him, and containing a
series of futile arguments on behalf of that injustice. Your readers
perhaps would like to know how prodigiously absurd and despicably
weak those rotten arguments are. -
“MR. WILsoN begins by observing that, “the origin of the Income:
Tax was to provide a substitute for Customs and Excise duties repealed
and reduced.” Premising a quantity of argumentative fudge, too long
to quote, he goes on to say:—
“If all men expended the whole of their incomes, then it is true that a uniform
rate of Income-Tax would be equivalent to customs duties. But the actual difference
would be as nearly as possible the same as the tax collected from customs and
excise duties. But the objection to taxing expenditure in the place of income is,
that it would be impracticable. At present, out of £5,589,000, there is collected at
the sources, without any return being required from the taxpayer, and without the
slightest inquisition into his affairs, no less than £4,039,000, while only 1,550,000 is
collected from incomes for which returns are required. If the same returns and
inquisition were required for the whole that are for the £1,550,000, it could not be
maintained for a day, or if it were it could only be under such lax regulations that
half would be evaded.”
“The following hackneyed truism is #: by MR. WILsoN as a
plea for the proposed iniquity of charging different incomes at different
rates:- -
“A person with £1,000 a-year, in the shape of a perpetual annuity from rents of
land or dividends in the funds, is in a condition to spend the whole of it without
impairing his prospects for the future, while a person deriving £1,000 a-year from a
trade or profession has to provide generally against one contingency in the former
case, and two contingencies in the latter case.”
“It has been argued, with profound wisdom, by the cleverest writers
in existence, that, even if the Income-Tax is unequal now, all incomes
will º: themselves to it in time. Mark the utterly inconclusive
reply of MR. WILson:—
“The obvious answer is, that if they are adjusted now by a discriminating
charge, we do at once that which time would accomplish years hence, and that fees
and salaries would remain as they are, in proportion to other incomes.”
“This is º, an inapposite quotation of the vulgar proverbial
saying, ‘No time like the present.’
“Subsequently, MR. WILSON ridiculously attempts to demonstrate
that the self-adjustment of the Income-Tax, on physicians’ fees, for
example, could never take place. To make out this denial of an
tººl certainty, he enters into irrelevant arithmetical calcu-
lations. MR. WILson knew nothing of figures.
“I do not attempt, Mr. Punch, to refute any of the fallacies above
quoted. They have, I think, most of them º in your columns
before, published by you of course as jokes, laughable by reason of their
self-evident absurdity. But they will be received by your readers, if
not as new jokes, yet as much lif. jokes than they previously seemed
to be, now that they appear as the serious propositions of MR. WILSON,
whose reputation as a financier is as great as it is unmerited.
“Let me, however, direct your attention, and that of your readers,
to one perilous indiscretion, which occurs among MR. WILson’s imbe-
cilities. Your circulation lies altogether among the higher classes, to
which we both belong, therefore I do not, hesitate to notice that mis-
take in this place, whence, of course, it will go no farther—will not, for
example, get into the penny papers. I allude tº the most injudigious
exposition of the fact that the inquisition of the Income-Tax is an
annoyance which affects a portion only of those who pay it—the con-
temptible wretches whose incomes are derived from trades, and pro;
fessions. This information must *. aggravate their hatred of
Schedule D. M.R. WILson has the imprudence to add the declaration
of his belief, that if the same lº. were extended to the higher
classes of Income-Taxpayers, such as our noble selves and our readers,
who are all independent gentlemen and ladies, it could not be main-
tained for a day. Of course it could not; but to tell the people so,
how sure a way to excite their brutal indignation against an impost at
whose partial operation they are already howling quite loudly enough
to disturb the serenity of the better orders represented by
“Your humble Servant, CRASSUs.”
Amusements in Rome.
THE Romans have started a new game, called Aunty Welly. It con-
sists of a figure, considerably blackened, of a well-known Cardinal,
whose name somewhat corresponds in sound to the above. The fun
turns upon the players pilº into the figure as hard as they can.
The Cardinal comes in for several hard blows, but no one has succeeded,
as yet, in putting his pipe out. However, it affords infinite sport to
the Romans, and is, altogether, a very fair substitute for the English
| game of Aunt Sally.

OLD GIRL. “I should like Thick Braids in front, and Curls and a Loop at the back!"
| NEWDEGATE IN A NEW CHARACTER.
A,THousAND thanks will be given to anybody who
all succeed in explaining the annexed passage from
a discourse, at the late meeting of the Sparkenhoe
Farmers’ Club, reported as having been delivered by
MR. NEwBEGATE:-
“When so many complaints were made of long speeches in
the House of Commons, had it never occurred to those who heard
or read them that these complaints might be attributable to the
fact that during these discussions new ideas were developed,
and that this was thought by some a waste of capital which
might be turned to more profitable account 7 (Hear, hear.)”
In what sense the development of ideas during dis-
cussions in the House of Commons can be regarded as
a waste of capital, MR.NEWDEGATE can º: explain,
but, it may be feared, is much more likely not to have
the least idea of the meaning of his own statement, to
that effect. Breath is wasted in the ºf speeches
to which the Hon. gentleman alluded; so is the patience
of the House and the public, and so is valuable time.
If new ideas were developed, they might be capital, or
might be worthless; but, j of new ideas, those
long-winded orations for which MR. NEwpegATE
apologises contain, for the most part, ºf but old
truisms, and, in greater proportion, old fallacies, old
platitudes, and venerable jokes. The above quotation
from MR.NEWDEGATE's speech suggests a resemblance
between him and Juliet, which we never expected to
discover. Respecting that heroine, Romeo remarks:—
“She speaks, yet she says nothing,"
s
h
ſ
which is precisely what the above-quoted remarks of
the Hon. Member for North Warwickshire appear to
amount to.
The American Editor's Lament.
A, CONSCIENTIQUs. American Editor (there is about
one left) thus pathetically says:—“The symbol of the
Union, I have always been told, was Stars and Stripes;
but as far as my painful experience goes, it’s Tar an

Go.—Would you call a Steward who passes his time
perpetually on, board a steampacket the inhabitant of
any place? Why, yes, I should call him a “Habitans
in Sicco /*
THAT’S THE WAY THE MONEY GOES.
Who is it that pouches the fees of the House of Commons?, He
must have yastly pretty pickings, judging by this statement, which we
copy from the Times:—
“HIGH FEEs IN HIGH PIACEs.-The House of Commons has published its
‘Standing Orders,’ corrected to the close of the Session. The table of fees would
surprise persons unacquainted with Parliamentary business. The rate varies ac-
co g to the sum intended to be laid out upon the undertaking to be sanctioned.
If a town determine on a t public improvement, on which a million and a half
of money is to be laid out, the first step is to deposit a petition for leave to .# in
a Bill before the House; but the House cannot see the petition unless there is
£50 note in it. On the first reading of the Bill, on the second reading, on the report
from the select committee on the Bill, and, even after º by the select com-
mittee, on the third reading, too, down to the time when the House has to
with the Bill, it can see no merit in it unless on each of these steps £150 be paid
before the Bill is put to the vote. These are parts of the price which “the powers
that be" charge for an Act of Parliament.”
Everybody now, we are told, is out of town, or we should certainly
ask somebody where all this money goes, Is there some official whose
office is a sinecure, except the pleasant labour of pocketing these fees?
or do they constitute a fund to pay the gas, and water rates, and other
incidental expenses of the House? If the latter be the case, which we
would fain believe it is, we should think the House must have a º
sum in hand, and might devote the yearly surplus, after clearing
expenses, to paying of a large proportion of the National Debt. Or
the House ..". supplies out of its fee-fund to #. the nation's
Income Tax, or to pension Mr. Punch. Either of these steps, and
especially the latter, would certainly be received with approbation º
the public; for, besides the gratification of seeing Virtue so rewarded,
the public would be º: e gainers by a grant, confe annually
the surplus fees on Mr. Punch... If that gentleman were thus, pecu-
niarily interested in the number of “great public improvements” to be
made, human nature would, of course, impel him to do all within his
power to assist them, and to offer his suggestion where best they might
|largest amount ever received by a nation under the head of “Blood-
part | as a

...'. The consequence would be, that petitions would pour in
for all such necessary works as clearing away Holywell Street, throwing
open all the bridges, widening Cheapside, an "...; the Thames;
and, as Mr. Punch would have a pecuniary interest in each stage of the
Acts, of course he would not rest till he seen them safely passed.
Something More than a Mere Flea-Bite.
WE read that the Leech monopoly at Tangiers was sold four years
ago for not less than £14,000. We should say that the above was the
money.” The profits, too, most probably will be Cent. per Cent., or,
enchman would say, Sang pour Sang !
SPORTS AND PASTIMES OF THE AMERICANS,
It seems to be a favourite pursuit of the Americans to get hold of a
or Editor, who has the courage to differ with them, and to tar and
eather him. If asked what kind of a nation America was, we should
feel inclined, after hearing of the above blackguard propensity, to
exclaim “Tar-nation l’”

MR. SPURGEON AND THE POPE.
IF greatness has its privileges, it also has its penalties. When a
man has by his talents made a name in the world, be sure his name will
soon be mentioned in all manner of advertisements, and º: to all
conceivable articles of trade. Thus both WELLINGTON and BLUgHER
gave a title to a boot, and we have seen the Joinville tie, and the Ches-
terfield top-coat. A million things at least have been christened after
Punch, from penny boxes of cigarlights to the elegant Poncho wrapper
now fallen in disuse. So if the Rev. MR. SPURGEoN feel aggrieved
that men of trade for purposes of lucre have made free with his name,
he at least may feel consoled that he is suffering in good company, such
as he need not feel ashamed to find himself amongst. How his name
has been made use of, the following will show:—
HE MAGIC SPURGEON. º A Magical life-like Por-
trait of the most popular orator of the day. When placed on the floor dances
gracefully, defying detection. Sent free by return for 18 stamps.
The perfect, likeness of this portrait to the popular original must
convincingly be shown, we fancy, in its gºi dancing. We have
heard of winking pictures, but never before this of a dancing portrait;
and how befitting is the attribute in the case of MR. SPURGEoN will be
readily perceived. Our readers doubtless well remember how severe
his text a season or two since: and how he said that the sole way in
which it should be tolerated was for the girls to dance in one room and
the gentlemen in another.
It must then make this portrait extremely like to life to make it capable
9f dancing in a graceful manner, as the talented original, no doubt,
himself can do. . A performer who is skilful in Terpsichorean feats
appears to best º when seen in a pas seul; and this no doubt
was the true reason why Mr. Spungeon owned his preference for
dancing independently of any female aid.
This solved, there is, however, another point that puzzles us. Why
the epithet of “magic” be applied to MR. SPURGEoN, we should be
rplexed to say. We have never heard it hinted that he practises the

Considering, the success of the Papal winking pictures, we may well
conceive the likelihood of MR. SPURGEON's making use of his gracefully
# portrait, as an attraction to his tabernacle when his audience
falls off. A great success for instance might on week-days be obtained
§. º; *. seul, after his portrait had done dancing, and,
when they both had taken breath, winding up by way of finish with a
double §§. º or some other pas de deur. Or why should
not MR. SPURGEoN send his compliments to the Pope, and challenge
his old Holiness to a trial of the merits of their respective magic
works, the one his winking-picture and the other his dancing portrait.
Not having ourselves seen either of these marvels, we may refrain from
stating, which we think best does its work. But in one, respect we
certainly must, give the palm, to MR, SPURGEON's, at least if the
advertisement we quoted be believed; for in that statement it is said
that the trick “defies detection,” and that is more than can be ur
about the winking of the picture, which any one can see with a
glance is all my eye.
A Jewel of a Minister.

HOW TO TEACH RELIGION.
THE way to blend religious with secular instruction is beautifully
exemplified in the following extract from the evidence of CHARLEs
GRIFFITHs a little boy about eleven years of age, given at the ;
Castle County Court, Salop, a few days since, in an action brought by
his father against #ºn: CowARD, master of the Bishop's Castle
National School, for having violently assaulted and beaten him, the
said CHARLEs GRIFFITHs:—
“I was a scholar at the National School in Bishop's Castle, of which the defendant
is the master. On the 24th of May last, when at prayers, I spoke to a boy named
ADDIs, but as I saw the master looking at me I desisted. I did not speak to him
ain. After prayers, myself and two other boys were directed to stay in school.
#. master then asked who spoke at prayers? I said I had ; he then told me to
hold out my hand, and I did so, and he cut me across it with his cane. He told me
to hold it out again; I complied, but drew it back when he struck me. He then
caught hold of me by the neck, and threw me backwards across his knee, and beat
me across the back with his cane. When the defendant loosed me I fell down
insensible. On recovering myself I saw the master was at his desk, and he
told me to “be off.' I then crawled along by the wall to the door, and went into the
playground. I nearly fell down from exhaustion while getting up the steps, when
two boys came and helped me up and assisted me home.
This gentle chastisement ºl. only a number of great wheals
extending all round this naughty, good-for-nothing boy's shoulders, and
down his back to his thighs; for perhaps it did not also occasion the
entire paralysis of his lower extremities, which, according to the testi-
mony of MR. H. BRQoks, surgeon, supervened upon it, and might have
been caused by a violent wrench of the back.
...The Judge, although legally obliged to give judgment for the plain-
tiff, with £20 damages, said, the defendant “was perfectly justified in
punishing the lad.” Justified ?–what a very weak word MR. CowARD
is very highly to be commended for caning the wicked, little boy,
CHARLEs. GRIFFITHs as he, did; thus justly punishing the fºr;
impiety of which that ungodly urchin had been guilty in whispering to
a schoolfellow during .*. What if he broken the profane
RIFFITHs would have remained a caution to
varlet's back? MASTER
other juvenile sinners. The cane is the instrument wherewithal to
awaken, the devotional sentiment which, in the youthful mind, is too
apt to slumber, and is too seldom aroused by the gentle and winning
voice, in which a national schoolmaster, generally reads, prayers.
Wheals which cover the shoulders, back and thighs of a little boy are
outward and visible marks, whereunto corres .# inward and spiritual
impressions, which latter are never effaced. ligion is thus connected
with childhood's earliest and tenderest associations, and in after years
is esteemed º Bodily wheals conduce to the soul's welfare.
“Spare the rod and spoil the child” is a saying to be received and
enforced in its natural and literal sense, whatever the heretical authors
of Essays and Reviews (who ought to be burnt) may say to the contrary.
What is true of the rod holds equally good of the cane, especially con-
sidered as, the means of correcting the inattention of children to their
religious duties, or at least of compelling them to exhibit a sanctified
exterior. The child will be spoiled if the cane is spared; but the
unsparing, use of the cane will, spoil no child otherwise and more
§ than by paralysing its lower limbs, for example, or perhaps
1Illng 1U. -
The foregoing remarks may embolden Cowards to persevere in beating
religion into little children, without regard to legal consequences.
A Lucky Saint.
SAINT JANUARTUs has turned Victor Emanuelite, and has boiled just
as neatly as if BoMBA were king, vice VICTOR. The Pope is a ully
disgusted, having hoped better things of St. Pomatum, and says that if
the latter had not been indiscreetly placed, in past ages, out of reach of
Popes, he, Pius, would send him where he should oil for at least, a
hundred years. St. Punch congratulates St. Januarius on his good luck.

A WARNING TO SERVANT MAIDS,
A CERTAIN young woman in service did dwell;
The place Wolverhampton, a true tale to tell. -
She was standing, one Sunday, her master's door nigh;
When lo! and behold a young workman came by.
He seemed a respectable sort of young man,
Going after his beer, as he carried a can,
He said unto her, “Why art thou stickin' there?”
She answered, “To get just a breath o' fresh air.”
So after some talking and chaffing about,
She invited him in whilst her master was out.
How many there is as will open the door
To them as they never set eyes on beforeſ
Down they went to the kitchen together straightway;
And he for himself had got so much to say,
That, to his persuasion inclining her ear,
Šhe filled up his can with her master's own beer.
Thereafter he kissed her, which she did return;
And he swore what was his’n should also be her’n.
Whereupon he prevailed of her desk to get hold,
Containing two pound half a sovering in gold.
He asked her to lend it; she answered him, “No l’’
To which he remarked, “You’ll be forced to do so.”
Then her money he boned and her salts-bottle too;
Which having accomplished, he bade her adieu.
Upon the next Tuesday she met him again, .
And axed him to give back her .*. In vain.
He told her ’twas spent; she would see it no more:
No doubt he’d served others the same way before.
So thinking it wisest to make a clean breast,
On her master's return the girl went and confessed:
He, missing his German pipe, found, to his grief,
The same had been likewise purloined by the thief.
Him, being detected, they had up in Court,
Of her, as a witness, the i. made sport:
As she was required to appear 'gainst the rogue
With whom she was foolish enough to collogue.
Now all you young women whose masters is out,
Don't let in the first young man hanging about,
For fear it should bring you to shame and disgrace,
And lose you your money, and likewise your place.
Civilisation in Spain.
By a telegram from Spain we get the interesting intelligence that—
“The annual bull-fights have commenced. The concourse of people was very
great. Seventy persons have been wounded in the arena.”
What fun! How much better the fun would have been though, if a
a bull or two had leapt out of the arena in among the seats,
wounded as many, or more, of the spectators!
THE “NIL DARPAN’” BoRE.
WHAT a deal of fuss has been created in connection with that
Bengalee play, the Nil Darpan / Leaving the Darpan out of the
question, and looking only at the Nil, which appears to be all that there
is to look at in the case, we are inclined to think that the Indian
Government, in treating it as a matter of such monstrous importance,
has made a very great coil about nothing.

of Russian rule, have left off dancing. He admires a gallant people's
renunciation of a popular pleasure in ceasing to dance; but does he
call this taking any steps towards achieving their independence?

properly so called. It is true that the General's courtship (according to, his own assertion,
solemnly made in a court of justice) was similar to what may be seen under the doric porticó
ºf some, silent meeting house. Desdemona herself, when she, with sweet simplicity, did
seriously incline,” might have easily passed for a young May Quakeress... Though by mature
choleric, the General was kept in such a perpetual ferment with his aide-de-camp getting into
night-brawls and breaking his rest by ringing his bell, that we cannot wonder if he sometimes
devoutly sighed for the institution of a Peace Society. But of his numerous acquaintance,
who were qualified for members? Roderigo, if nominated, would certainly have been black-
balled. Jagg's contemptuous treatment of his purse (pronouncing it trash), was scarcely
consistent with the º of a Friend. Whether Cassio's tender concern for his reputation
was more in harmony with such emotions, is just one of those nice points on which we are
too diffident to offer º opinion.
Modern, as compared with ancient, Quakerism is far less straightlaced. Its habits do not
square as they once did, with our juvenile notions of mathematical propriety. Morelatitude

fluently on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your parsons
do, I had as lief the begging impostor spoke . discourse. Nor do
not thump the cushion too much-your fist thus: but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) the whirlwind of
zeal, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may give it
tº 0, it offends me to the soul to see a robustious whisker.
cheeked fellow tear an exhortation to tatters, to very rags, to split the
ears of the sanctified, who, for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable grimace and rant. I could have such a fellow whipped for
o'erdoing Chadband; it out-mawworms Mawworm; pray you avoid it.
1st Parson. I warrant your lordship. -
Bishop. Be not too cold, neither, but let your own discretion be your
tutor: suit the emphasis to the word and the word to the emphasis,
with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the dignity of the
pulpit, for anything so overdone is from the purpose of, preaching,
whose end, both at the first, and now, was, and is, to hold as 't were
the mirror up to conscience; to show piety her own figure, profane:
ness her own image, and the very soul and spirit of a mall his form an
pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the
withings laugh, cannot but make the sober grieve; the censure of
the which one, must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole temple of
others. O, there be parsons, that I have, hº preach, and known
others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, having
neither the accent of Christians, nor the delivery of Christians, scholars,
nor gentlemen, have so moaned and bellowed, that I have thought some
of Little Bethel's clergymen had trained them, and not trained them
well, they imitated Stiggins so abominably. . . . -
l | Parson. I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, my
Ord.
Bishop. O, reform it altogether. And let those that aim at being
pathetic preachers speak no other than articulate sounds; for there be
of them, that will themselves groan, to set on some quantity of maudlin
hearers to groan too; though, in the meantime, some necessary question
of the text, be then to be considered; that’s villanous, and shows a
most pitiful hypocrisy in the snob that uses it. Go, keep you steady.
º Parsons.
PUFFS FOR THE POLICE.
IN humble emulation of his brethren of the penny-a-line profession,
who nobly omit no opportunity of puffing the }. especially when
the latter have done the very least in the world to deserve such laudation,
Mr. Punch has resolved to open his columns, from time to time to the
reception of Fº in glorification of The Force. By way, of a
be g, he is happy to record his testimony to the skill, coolness,
and energy of INSPECTOR O'PAQUE (of the Digamma Division), as dis-
played under the following trying circumstances. A gentleman of the
name of SMITH was walkin } #. Hill on Saturday last, when
he felt a tug at his coat, and the next moment perceived his handker-
chief, a valuable cambric one, hemmed, for which he given eleven-
pence only last autumn, in the grasp of a diminutive pickpocket. He
collared the boy, and INSPECTOR OPAQUE at that moment coming up,
the gentleman gave the thief in charge. The worthy Inspector, who
combines some of the genius of the first NAPOLEON *. small
share of the *.*.*.*. the third, apparently took not the
slightest notice, but, at the #; moment, and when the least delay
would have enabled the watchf. delinquent to escape, seized the latter
by the neck. There were several persons about, and though many of
them were of the lower class, ...”may possibly in their minds have
entertained an intention of rescuing the º dauntless Inspector
never quailed, but, to two constables, behind him, delivered the
lad into their charge, and walked on without another syllable. This is
only one of a hundred instances, in which the WIDocQ-like tact of IN:
sPECTOR O'PAQUE has enabled him to arrest a most determined and
dangerous offender.

TERRIFIC EXPLOSION AT THE BROMPTON B0ILERS.
By our Own Penny-a-Liner.
Bout two o'clock, on Friday
last, the persons, in the
vicinity of these Boilers were
alarmed by the sound of a
terrific explosion. Hasten-
ing to the spot, we were for-
tunate enough º the
§ {\ following particulars, which
$j may be relied upon. It ap-
º pears that MR.PETER MEEK-
A BURY, a highly respectable
resident at Islington, had
been visiting the Boilers in
company with MRs. MEEK:
BURY, and incoming out had
been incautious enough to
tº let drop a hint that the lady
might as well return, to
Islington by an omnibus
instead of a cab. -
MEEKBURY, who is of a
highly inflammable character,
took fire, and instantly blew
up, and indeed continued blowing up MR.MEEKBURy, with considerable
violence. It was thought at one time that he had been knocked into
the middle of next week, but this alarm º to be unfounded, and
Fº assistance being at hand in the shape of a mother-in-law, who
urričium with a cab of her own hiring, and for which she nobly
declared she would die sooner than allow a Brute to pay, MRs. MEEK-
BURY was got out with no other loss than that of a temper which she
can well afford to spare. The accident, however, should be a warning
to husbands not to drop anything º to cause an explosion, and MR.
MEEKBURY's nerves have been so shocked that, by the advice of a
§§ medical friend, he has gone out of town without leaving his
css.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAEPUNCH, - -
“THERE is a story of a swell, who being advised to and
see a play at Sadler's Wells, exclaimed Aw-Sadlaw’s Wells, wheaw's
that?—aw—pwecious long way, isn’t it?—s’pose that one will have to
change one’s horses on the woad?” -
“I am not a swell myself, and I know that Sadler's Wells is access-
ible from Regent Streeſ for an eighteenpenny fare, and Iknowmoreover
whenever I have gone there I have invariably been pleased with
my evening's entertainment; and yet with all this knowledge I go
there very seldom, and why I don't go oftener I’m sure I cannot, say.
Every time I come away I make a firm resolve to go again within a
month; but somehow this intention always goes to fill a gap in the
infernal pavement. Notwithstanding all our fancied craving for variety,
I think we Londoners are sadly apt to get into a groove, and not to

there is who to save a couple of minutes when he was late for office
used to take what he conceived was a short cut through a court; and
now his time is all his own, and he has little work to occupyit, he takes
the same shortcut by force of his old habit, and gets a pegtop on his
toe or a tip.cat in his eye, as a reminder that his legs are not so agile as
they were, nor his sight so clear and watchful.
“The Second part of SHAksPEARE's King Henry the Fourth was the
play Iwent to see on my late Islington excursion. It was played for a few
hts at the same house, some seven †. since, but I believe with
texception it has not been seen in London for well nigh half a cen-
tury. Yet the play as now presented seems actable enough, and one
wonders at the verdict which long ago pronounced it to be only readable.
The comic scenes predominate through the first four acts, and are full
of pleasant humour both in action and in speech; while the scene in the
fifth act with the old King and his sons is replete with touching pathos
and nobly written lines, and has the stirring incident of the ste of
the crown...Ithink few more telling pictures, have been seen upon the
stage than the confronting of young #. with his dying father; who
first upbraids, then listens, then pardons, and embraces, and retires to
die content. This scene MR. PHELPs acted with his son, and both sus-
tained their parts as well as any actors, living could, have represented
them, and neither mouthed nor mumbled the words they had to speak.
I had never seen the latter gentleman before, and was glad to notice in
a carefulleyel utterance, and no tendency to rant.
*But admirably well as the pathetic parts were rendered, the comic
scenes of course were the main feature of the piece. Mr. PHELPs
played Justice Shallow, as well as the old King, and thus gave usagood
Fº: of his quick versatility, for two characters more opposite than the
ussy fatuous justice and the calm majestic sufferer it were difficult to
conceive. The trembling nervous hands and feeble hesitating voice,
seemed fit signs of his semility and of his shallow pate; and while he
prattled on with garrulous º of the freaks of his hot youth
one felt how many Shallolºs still are extant in Society, and how fon
they are of boring you with the wild deeds which, by Jove, Sir, they did
when they were boys.
“To me a great charm in the plays that I have seen at Sadler's
Wells is, that they are always evenly well cast. There is no trace of
the system of hiring farthing dips tº stand about the stage, so as to
heighten the effulgence of some º: particular “Star,” whose bril.
liancy is deemed to be enough to fill the house. On the contrary, the
minor parts are carefully attended to, and no unnatural excrescence
ſº the º effect. Seeing the large space that he covers on
the stage, Sir John # can be hardl ed a minor part; an
tº BARRETT filled it very well, hº one couples the fat
knight with more unctuousness of voice. His wife, too, played Dame
Quickly much as one could wish; for of course one can't read SHAR-
speARE without forming to one’s self one's own conception of a part;
and MR. SEYTON raved and ranted and swaggered o'er the stage with
better taste than Antient Pistol generally does.
‘. The spirit of SHAKSPEARE has been summoned to many a séance,
and when it comes to town again I should certainly advise it to visit
Sadler's Wells. If ghosts have memories and feelings, and are sensitive
in mind, it would do the º of SHAKSPEARE considerable good to
note how SHAKSPEARE's plays are relished by that audience, and how
reverently it listens to each one of SHAkspeaRE's words. ‘Attention!’
is the order until the curtain drops, and not a sneeze or snuffle grates

house is also silent you might hear a playbill drop. A º proof this

M'CLELLAN’S WAR SONG.
AMONG recent news from America is a report of a “maiden speech”
delivered by GENERAL M'CLEILAN to the Pennsylvanian troops. This
oration may be said to have been both witty and poetical. It was
remarkable for º “the soul of wit; ” and that its form was, in
chief part, at least, that of poetry, the perusal of it will convince any
reader who has a reasonable ear for versification. It commenced
-
with:-
“Soldiers!”
to which single word of simple prose succeeded the following lines:-
“We have had our last retreat.
We have seen our last defeat.
You stand by me and I will stand by you.”
Here the Muse of GENERAL M'CLELLAN seems to have inspired him
# relinquish rhyme, and to conclude his exhortation in blank verse,
us:-
“And henceforth victory will crown our efforts.”
GENERAL M'CLELLAN seems to be a regular “warrior-bard,” like
the “minstrel boy” who to the war had gone,” except that he jº
to have no harp, whether “wild” or fame, slung either “behind him,”
or in front of him. The wildness of his measure is, however, some-
what analogous to that of the musical instrument with which the
juvenile Irish poet and hero went into action. The antipathy to slavery
displayed by that youthful patriot may turn out to constitute another
point of resemblance between him and the American General; who will
erhaps, when his conquering army shall have planted the flag, ºf
reedom upon Southern soil, celebrate the emancipation of his sable
fellow-citizens by singing its triumphant achievement in a negro
melody, accompanying #id: on the banjo.
A Shrewd Guess.
A, CLEveR. Yankee, alluding to the well-known line, "the glass of
fashion and the mould of form,” makes a “guess” that the GLAss in
question must have been the Lady who wrote a celebrated cookery-book
under that name. The “mould” he explains by saying it must mean
an ice, or jelly, or pudding, or blancmange, or any other kind of
“mould” you #º of which goes far in his opinion to prove what a
very clever fellow SHAkspeaRE was. Not only did he know eve
that went before him, and a great deal more, but he could also
anticipate coming events!

a correspondent who
writes to a contem-
orary, and appends
is name, with the
affix of “M.D.,” gives
some rather startling
reasons for believing
so. After stating that
the fashionable maupe
tint, and Magenta,
“will not stand the
fest of artificial light,”
he proceeds next to
remark that—
- “The only colour, per-
haps, which remains
fixed under all kinds of
lisht is what is known as
‘Scheele's green.” This
colour, which is pleas-
ingly bright in the day,
is made of arsenic, and
preserves its freshness
and beauty under all
trials of artificial light.

right across their backs. Whenever for the future, we
go into a ball-room, we shall look on each green lady
as a new Lucrezia Borgia, who would subtly be the death
of us if we joined her in the dance. -
Nor are head-dresses less hurtful than those which clothe
the body; for, proceeds M.D.—
“We are occasionally meeting ladies attacked with erysipelatous
symptoms, indigestion, cough—now distinctly traceable to head-
dresses containing green arsenical artificial flowers. A careful
chemical analysis of one of these wreaths gives exactly as much
* as would kill 36 men, and a fair tarlatane dress would kill

Long experience has taught us that it is quite useless
to preach against the fast ions, for ladies have deaf ears
for all complaints º the subject; and no matter how
dangerous or how ugly are their dresses, so long as they are
fashionable, ladies will ersist, in wearing them. So our
only chance of making them give up this poisonous green,
is by warning the malesex of the anger they incur by it,
and recommending gentlemen to keep themselves aloof
from any girl they meet with in a verdant dress or wreath.
When thus they find themselves neglected, if not absolutely
shunned, ladies will of course set all their wits to work to
ascertain the cause; and notwithstanding the delight they
.# feel in being dressed in the fashionable colour, we
will wager the delight of being flirted with and waltzed
with will quickly prove the stronger. Off will go the
green, and on will come AUGUSTU's, and the only “redness
of skin”, which will be shown by the young lady will be
the blush upon her cheek when she hears the question

AMBITION AMONG THE ALDERMEN.
THE question “Who is to be Lord *{. appears this year
to have created extraordinary excitement in the City. There seems to
have prevailed a supposition that the Monarch of the Mansion House,
whoever he might . would stand a good chance of being made a
baronet, and the º of getting what may be called a barren
honour, occasioned an unusual competition for the Lord Mayoralty
amidst the aldermanic body; Commenting on this generous rivalry in
which the chivalry of Guildhall has been lately engaged, a Correspond.
ent of the City Press, in the subjoined passage, asserts a high idea of
an abstract Lord Mayor:—
“The Lord MAyor must be a man of dignity, wealth, and intelligence-of
graceful manners and great discretion.”
and our Civic contemporary adds:—
“He must, in fact, be, according to the Hibernian description, “a gentleman
cvory inch of him.’”
as O'LEARY said; whence the self-assertion, “Every inch a king!”
was put by SHAKSPEARE into the mouth of Lear, after QLEARy;
But what has SHAKSPEARE to do with the dignity of Lord, Mayor?
Why, when he has occasion to deal with it, as in Richard III, he
exhibits...it in a light quite the reverse of that wherein it is represented
in the City Press. SHAKspEARE’s Lord Mayor has the deportment of a
civil old beadle: his manners are ludicrous, his intelligence is that of
a goose. The only discretion he shows is such as what appears in the
better part of valour. How different this picture of the Lord Mayor
is from that which is delineated in the City Press, and from the reality
which, at least in modern times, has ever been conspicuously manifest
at the Mansion House, and whereof the most signal characteristics
have always been universally acknowledged to be, a singularly dignified
bearing, remarkable intelligence, peculiarly graceful manners, and the
nicest etion.
Toi Que Je n'Aime pas.
AT ALFRED MELLON's Concert on Friday, during the performance
of a selection from Robert le Diable, our friend Young RAPID observed,
looking at the bill, “Ah! that chorus exactly represents the history of
my case. Le Win. Les Belles. Le Jew.”
NEW MONKS WANTED.
Monks and monkery are at such a premium now that it seems
members of the English Church are desirous to go into the monastic
line. An announcement appears by which young men, English Pro;
testants, who may feel a “vocation” for a conventual life, are invited
to address themselves to a certain Brother Ignatius...They are warned,
however, that they will have to promise three things, Obedience,
Poverty, and Celibacy. Mr. Punch, has no particular “yocation” to
interfere with the doings of idiots, but as regards the third vow, he
heartily approves it in the case of anybody who may, think of applying
to Brother Ig. Fancy, a sensible girl ever being asked in marriage by
any one who had been helpless enough to prattle of a monastic life in
these days! At the risk of bigamy, frigamy, et omne quod erit in igamy,
Mr. Punch would sooner marry her himself than allow her to become
the bride of such a Nass. But, after all, perhaps Brother Ignatius is
only one of the ingenious gentlemen who have a meat way of getting
postage stamps without applying to the vendors thereof, in which case
we heartily wish him all success—monks of 1861 are fair game.
A Kick in the Right Direction.
WHAT is Italy, to do with his old Holiness the Pope? Surely she
has had enough of him by this time. She will have no peace and quiet
so long as he remains with her. Now that quarter day, has come, she
had better rid her house of him. The bad company he keeps is clearly
quite enough of an excuse for getting rid of him. We think the Boot
of Italy could not well be put to any better use than in kicking out
his Holiness Pop E PIUs.
THE NATION THAT TURNS OUT MOST NEGATIVES.
By the recent Census we are informed that in Paris there are no less
than 23,000 persons who get their living from Photography, and the
photographic process. An old fogey, who has, never been able, to get
bver his stupid prejudices against the French, upon being told of the
above fact, exclaimed in a tone of the greatest triumph, “Egad, it’s
just like 'em! I always said those French fellows were the cleverest
chaps in the world for making faces.”

A GOOD SORT OF FELLOW.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“ME and Lucy Lockit, who is staying on a visit with me
(bygones being quite bygones) read this in a newspaper on Thursday
last, and cannot help, both of us can’t, sending it to you,
“A fellow calling himself MACHEATH was before MR. CoMBE for
some paltry crimes:–
“MR. CoMBE told him, he was a disgrace to the name he had selected. Captain
Macheath was a celebrated highwayman, but he always paid his tavern bills. He
was a good sort of a fellow, and did not go sneaking about bilking hotel-keepers
and stealing boots. As a caution to him for the future, he should sentence him to
three months' hard labour at Wandsworth.”
“Lucy and me wish to sinnify to this worthy Magistrate that we
quite agree with him, and that the way he spoke up for the Captain did
credit to his head and heart. Macheath has his frailties, as which of us
has not, but what's that when your heart's in the right place.” High-
way robbery, bigamy, subordination (we think it’s called) of perjury,
training gangs of thieves, and all that, is very wrong, no doubt, but we
quite agree with MR. CoMBE that one may do all that and more, and
yet be “a good sort of fellow.’ So in Lucy's name and mine (for we
are above all low jealousies now), we thank M.R. CoMBE, and will thank
you, Mr. Punch, to tell him so. The Captain is out on a little business,
being now on the Stock Exchange, or would join usin compliments.
“Yours, very affectionately,
“Belgravia.” “Polly MACHEATH (née PEACHAM).”

he is but repeating the sentiments of most of his contemporaries, that
while he cannot conceive how there can be the slightest doubt as to the
propriety of re-electing Cup.ITT, who is &c., &c, &c., he is sº
at a loss to perceive a single valid argument for not electing SIR. H.

chaps, and merchant princes annually “disguise’, themselves as cab-
drivers and 'bus cads, and disgust their swell French friends by walkin
with them without gloves and staring at, shop windows, like a lot o
country bumpkins, and deporting themselves generally less like edu:
cated gentlemen than uncivilised Gorillas. *W. objects,”
G. U.’ has the cheek to callus, and says that at the theatres our
“disregard of decency’ is really still more glaring than in the public
streets. And then, by way of contrast, he tells us that, when French-
men come to London, there is nothing vulgar or shabby in their
*: and they pay.us the º of “dressing even better than
they do at home.” ell, judging by the specimens I’ve seen near
Leicester Square, there must be precious scarecrows, somewhere about
Paris, if worse clothes are there in wearing than those which we see
ere.
... “The fact is, Mr. Punch, I believe that Mister ‘G. U.’s’ real name
is Jehu ; and as, I think, he drives a cab, he has a fondness for all
foreigners, for they know nothing about distances, and are #.
chargeable at half-a-crown a mile. So he gives them this soft soap in
the hope of tempting more of them to London, where he will no doubt
be always glad to see them, and take them to as many º: and places
as he can. But as for foreign-going Britons being biassed by his
blarney, pray don’t let him lay that flattering unction to, his soul.
en on a tour an Englishman always does his best to make himself
at home, and to enjoy himself as much as it is possible to do. There is
no mistaki is insular deportment; and, though some may think it
insolent, that’s a matter of opinion, and JoHN, BULL on a tour don't
care a jot what people think of him. Some perhaps may stare to see
him stalk along in the middle of the streets, and stare up at the houses
as though they all belonged to him, and he were come over to inspect
his property. Others again may wonder at his walking about a church
while service is proceeding, and looking at the pictures as though they
were a show, and uttering his comments in audible stage whispers,
much to the annoyance º those who are at prayers. But all these
little eccentricities foreigners forgive us, because we have long purses
and don't mind dipping into them. And so long as they are please
and proud to see us, I don't see why a ‘G. U.’ needs to crack his
whip at us; and if it comes to talking of “vulgar-looking objects,” why
Englishmen are ever so much handsomer than foreigners, and as for
English women, bless them! Where upon the Continent can we look
upon their like? This I’ll say and stick to, in spite of all the ‘G. U.S.’
and Jehus in creation; as sure as my name *i. you may have
heard it?) is
“JoHN SMITH.”
The Costume of Travelling Englishmen.
Poor John BULL mustn't be blamed, or ridiculed, if he does look a
little shabby and eccentric on the Boulevards and elsewhere, as it is
very well known that an Englishman always puts on his bad habits the
moment he goes abroad.
NoT THE SLIGHTEST MATERIAL FOR “A LFADER.”

FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
WE doubt if the following is likely to be found, under
the head of “Fashionable Intelligence,” in the Morning
Post-“On Thursday last, FRANCEs ANNE, Dowager
Marchioness of Londonderry, gave her annual diner cham-
pººre at Camlough, in Ireland. Invitations were sent out
to the number of 300, and full as many must have attended.
We are sorry we can give none of the gentlemen's names,
as they were mostly colliers, and all of them, moreover,
were her Ladyship's tenants, and as such we doubt if they
would be interesting, much less known to any of our fair
readers. They were mostly distinguished by extreme
plainness of attire; whilst a plentiful absence of gloves as
- as jewellery, only relieved occasionally by a º:
|waistcoat, in the very worst taste, generally prevailed. e
|must admit, however, that clean shirts predominated, and
|from the brightness of their º faces, no one would
have suspected what was their usual calling. The company
|sat down totable at the primitive hour of two o'clock; but
in spite of that, every one seemed to make a capital dinner.
The repast was plain and substantial, and what it may
have wanted in quality, was certainly made up in º
However, as it was of a nature that Mt. Gunter would
|not have prided himself in having sent out, we must be
pardoned laying before our readers the particulars of the
carte. As soon as dinner was over—we were going to say,
as soon as the table-cloth was removed, only there was no
table-cloth used on the occasion-her Ladyship delivered
a speech, so very different to anything we are in the habit
|of º that we are sure we shall be excused º:
|ing our columns with a word of it. It was curiously free
|from compliments, or any at tournure of well-bred
|persiſtage, or any of those nicely-worded drawing-room
|fadaises, that mean nothing, and yet are so acceptable
to the educated ear. On the contrary, it was only to be
commended for its gentle wisdom º unaffected tone of
|kindly admonition and earnest exhortation. However, it
| seemed to go to the hearts of the guests, who gave vent to
their excited feelings by cheering, of course, in the noisiest
manner possible. As soon as they were tired of eating and
drinking, the company went home in their respective carts
and wheelbarrows. The only beyerage handed was beer.”
The above may appear a highly improper entertainment
for a lady in the MARchioness of Londonderry's station
In the above disgraceful garb (actually Light Tweed, Mauve Flannel Shirt, No Waist-
coat, and a White Billycock Hatſ) G. U. meets his Friend Jack Loostring walking on

of life to lend herself to, but we contess if the “Fashionable

REGIMENTAL ASSASSINS. |
It is a most lamentable necessity in the mature of things that armies
must be in considerable part composed of men of moral worth and intel:
i. What a pity it is that brains which are capable of reason, and
a heart animated § human feeling, should be under the obligation of
becoming liable to be blown out and torn to pieces by creatures who are
beasts in every respect, but that of |. two hands, and having
weapons in them ' War seems to be a sort of work that should, by
right, constitute the severest kind of hard labour to which criminals
could possibly be condemned. It is essentially a painful and disgusting
employment, wherein nobody can deserve to be involved but the worst
of felons. Military service, in short, ought to be penal servitude. The
forces of a nation should consist of its rascalry and its ruffianry. . These
considerations only enhance the regard which all who feel the force of
them must entertain for the heroes whom a sense of duty compels to
brave death, and even mutilation, in defence of their country. They
are the confessors and martyrs of patriotism.
There are, no doubt, numerous unconvicted British scoundrels who
would be glad to fight for pay and plunder, and the gratification of
their innate ferocity; and these take to fighting as a trade, engaging as
volunteers in a quarrel which they have no business with. #sº
Correspondent of the Times, in a letter from Washington, makes the
following allusion to villains of this description:—
“They must know, also, that they act in opposition to the QUEEN's proclamation
in accepting service on either side. There are, however, a number of English sub-
jects engaged as officers on both sides, and the Irish may be counted by myriads (in
its proper sense) in both armies.”
In any rational view these English and Irish bravos militant, whether
on the Federal or Confederate side, deserve to be hanged as much as
anybody can. They kill for hire or for amusement, and if such killing
is not murder, what is It differs only from common murder in being
much more deliberate. If all of these blackguards who may be taken
prisoners are gibbeted, they will be the right men in the right places,
if the tight noose of a halter is the right ºf. for the neck of any man.
In battle, a man's lower jaw is sometimes shot away without killing
him, and, thus hideously maimed, he drags on a ghastly existence, for
many years of misery. Should this accident happen, to any English or
ish mercenary, occupied in the commission of wilful murder on behalf
of either the North or the South, who will pity him? A “ nt lad,”
a “ dashing boy,” exercising his venal or gratuitous “gallantry”, and
“dash” in unwarranted bloodshed, would meet with a merited rebuke
in a crack of the chops which would leave him permanently chop-fallen.
If we could but safely constitute the British army out of such
materials as the fellows who are now murdering the Americans and one
another under the Stars and Stripes and the Palmetto Flag respectively,
how happy we should be! We should not be then as we are now, com-
pelled to throw away valuable lives in resisting the º of any
surrounding savages who may be hounded upon us by the hope of
plunder on the lust of glory.
THE FALL OF THE APPLE.
The Manchester, folks are buying up all the apples, so that we are
threatened with a cider famine. It seems—
“That the Manchester calico-dyers and printers have discovered that º juices
supply a desideratum long wanted in making fast colours for their printed cottons.”
This is not the first time in the history of the world that the apple
has been the fruit of mischief or discord, or that a question of momentous
gravity has turned upon its fall. However, we are very sorry, for apple
juices are good for something more than what is drily stated in the
above paragraph; for do they not in warm weather supply, also, a
“de-cider-atum” in quenching a pedestrian's thirst? Since they are
to be used for the future only for printing, we j. we shall find
their taste and quality principally displayed in Gros-de-Mapples /

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
A NEW COURT CIRCULAR WANTED.
ESPECTED PUNCH,
“I Wish to call your
notice to a literary want,
which I think it is your
duty as a loyal British sub-
ject, and one having un-
doubtedly great influence
at Court, to attend to with-
out #. º,º and get
supplieu. e meagre de-
*: which are furnished
of the movements of our
Sovereign by that bald
and disappointing publica-
tion, the Court Circular

... I know has been º a.
passion, and many
people think—or at least
pretend to think—that
although the may
chronicle the movements of HER MAJESTY when she appears in public state, it
has no right to inquire into her doings when in private, any more than into those
of any other private lady in the land. Some indeed, affect to view it as the height
of snobbism if one betrays a wish to know how Royalty employs itself in its leisure
moments, and whether it eats and drinks like humanity in l, and walks and
ºf: and talks in the usual human way. But I think such curiosity is laudable
and loyal; and I am not to be deterred from endeavouring to gratify it by any sneers
and snarls about impertinent Paul-Pryism,” or, hints about one's hunting º
persons, and watching all their movements, as though they were some newly-dis-
covered species of wild beast. -
“Now, hungry as I am for every scrap I can J. up about the movements
of the Court, only see with what scant diet the Court Circular would starve me:–
“The QUEEN and PRINCE CossoRT, accompanied by PRINCEss ALICE and PRINCE Louis of Hesse,
went out driving yesterday afternoon, and walked home through the Balmoral woods.
* PRINcess Louise rode out attended by Lady Churchiti.
* PRINGEARTHUR and PRINCE LEopold, attended by BARoN WESTERwell ER and Major ELPHIN-
stone, drove to Loch Bulig.
“There was no addition to the Royal dinner-party.”
“What bald, and meagre details! How utterly unsatisfying to one who like
myself would wish to know so much more than is here recorded. Not one word is
said as to how HERMAJESTY and family were dressed, and whether they looked
well, and seemed in tolerable spirits. Yet (9 loyal subjects surely such particulars
are ... Perhaps it were unreasonable to expect that a reporter should be
constantly at hand, to treasure up the tit-bits of the º conversation. But I
own I should immensely relish such a record, and would, subscribe to any paper
that would undertake to furnish it. How delightful it would be to know the sweet
soft nothings that PRINCE Louis whispered modestly in the ear of his Princess,
as they “walked home” together i."the leafy woods ! Of course the QUEEN
and the PRINCE Consort discreetly walked in front, and suffered the young
couple to follow at their leisure, and enjoy the opportunity of loitering as they
pleased. The uninteresting Court Circular says not a word on this point, and makes
its statement in the most prosaic stupid manner, as though such a thing, as love-
making were quite unknown at Court. But any one with eyes can see quite clearly
what took place, and it is cruel to deny us the delight of such full details as might
have been supplied.
i.on mous day my loyal curiosity is baulked by the bald bits of intelligence
that—
“THE PRINoe Coxsort and PRINee Louis of HEsse went out deer-stalking.
“HER MAJESTY's dinner-party included a number of grand people and the Ladies and Gentle-
men in Waiting."
“What did the PRINCE CoNspRT kill? That is the first question that I º:
tate to know. Was his Royal Highness successful in his stalking, and when he
got a chance, did he make a decent shot?, As our country is becoming now a land
of 1. riflemen, every one must feel an interest in the prowess of the Prince,
and must be glad to know that he is a sure marksman in a deer forest, and that
a stag when aimed at by him will be venison in a crack. Then again, as to the
dinner: Was there anything extraordinary in the ‘Ladies and Gentlemen in
Waiting’ being present? One would think the phrase ‘in Waiting’ meant that
they attended upon Royalty at meal-time, and discharged the duties which are usual
to waiterdom, such as changing plates and dishes, and bringing fresh clean knives
and forks. But if this be so, why was their presence specially recorded ? and are
we to imagine that when they are not mentioned, other waiters do their work, and
they are having ‘a day out?’ -
“Of all the mortifying scraps and atoms of Court news, the following however is
l think, the most disheartening. After a few meagre words ament the elder royal
rsonages, and how a recent morning had been wiled away
y them, I find it said with brutal brevity that—
“The Royal Children took their usual out-door exercise.”
“Is, not that, Sir º How am I to know
what the Royal Children did that morning with their royal |
selves? In common I dare say with millions of your loyal
readers, I am most completely in the dark upon the point.
Carefully I have searched through two whole years of the
Cºurt Circular, and can find no scrap of statement as to
what this usual out-door exercise’ may be. The only
way indeed by which I can arrive at any guess upon the
matter is by looking at my pocket-book to ascertain the
ages of the Royal Family, and then assigning such a pas.
time as seems suitable to each. But whether the PRINCE
Leopold, did really play at marbles on the morning I refer
to, or whether he amused himself with castigation of a
whipping-top or the trundling of a hoop, is a question which
I have, alas! no data to decide. Nor can I determine if
his elder, brother ARTHUR took his exercise on pony-back,
orin playing fly-the-garter with some Gentleman in Waiting,
or in having a game of hop-scotch, because he was in Scot-
land, or in getting some fat nobleman to make a back at
leap-frog, or a or two at cricket, or a running bout
at rounders, or a turn at prisoner's base. The PRINCEss
HELENA attends the royal dinner-table now, and must there-
fore not be classed among the Royal Čhildren, and the
PRINCEss Louis A is in her fourteenth year, and so mo
doubt is tºo sedate for things so juvenile as skipping-ropes.
But the little PRINCEss BEATRICE is still—bless her 1–in
her doll-age, and I can picture her quite prettily at her
usual out-door exercise of walking out as nurse-maid with
her dolly in her arms; though whether dolly is of wood or
wax, and has blue eyes, black, or brown, and whether she
be able to wink those visual organs, I regret that I can do
no more than give a feeble guess, and dolls are now so
various that my guess, there is great reason to fear, would
prove a wrong one.
“Such particulars as these the Court Circular should
furnish, to satisfy minds loyally inquiring like my own.
And now that a new newspaper is started every week, I
trust if the Court Circular neglects to do its work, a new
one will be set up º in opposition. Promising
my support to so promising a spec,
“I remain, Sir, yours obediently,

SPECIMIEN OF AN AUSTRIAN TELEGRAM.
ONE morning last week an Austrian telegram announced
the Fact that, on board an English vessel, the Austrian
Government had seized Seventy Boxes, containing 3000
rifles, intended, of course to be used by those who object
to the paternal arrangements of the House of Hºl.
The same evening the Austrian telegram was slightly
corrected by an accurate statement of the case, which was
that One Box, containing some rifles, had been placed on
board an English vessel, by a mistake which was at once
detected and rectified. -
We earnestly hope that at the coming International
Exhibition, Austria will contribute to the Philosophical
Instrument department a specimen of the wonderful mul;
tiplying spectacles furnished to her officials. There will
be nothing else so miraculous unless MR. SAMUEL WELLER
should contribute his hypothetical ten million magnifying
microscope of hextra power.
Negroes in Africa and in Europe.
“THE Negro (says a writer in the Cornhill) invents
nothing, originates nothing, improves nothing.”, The same
can pretty nearly be said of the Bourbon, wiſh this addition
—that your Bourbon learns nothing. In fact, it may be said
with justice, and we wish to offend no black man with the
comparison, that the Bourbons are the Negroes of Europe.

It is not fair for us to laugh at the poor Yankees. If they

AND THEY wants To BE CordED."
GLORIOUS TRIUMPH IN THE CITY | | |
As Mr. Punch last week announced must inevitably be the case, the
Livery has chosen MR. CUBITT by a splendidly preponderating majority.
As }. Punch also remarked, it would have been an insult to the City
to doubt the result. As Mr. Punch further remarked, he congratulates
the City on its noble conduct. There can be no kind of hesitation in
affirming that not only is Cubitt the proper man—did we say man, we
mean nobleman—for the office of Lord MAYOR during the year when
foreigners from all parts will crowd our metropolis, and expect, to
i. in the person of our Chief Magistrate a compendium of all that
in private is kind, and all that in public ennoblingly towers, for Mansion
House banquets expressly designed, like the strength of the shaft with
the capital.’s flowers. The veteran champion of the City’s rights; the
allant politician who º the inglorious safety of Andover to
i. the perilous battle of the Constitution against the fiends of revo-
lution whose rage found vent in the frantic accents of the terrible
Wood; the hero who, though defeated, quailed not, but instantly §.
more dinners—here was the man-nobleman, we mean—for the City,
and right proud and glad we are that the City knew its man and chose
him. May CUBITT, twice, Consul, have a glorious, and prosperous
second reign, and when the bright sword of Royalty shall fall upon his
metropolitan shoulders, the steel should be wreathed with roses, like
the . of HARMoDIUs, and hºmage be paid at once to the brave
statesman and the worthy host. Who’s Muggeringe? Muggeridge
be blowed | Bah! beeſ bo! buh! MUGGERIDGE, indeed! London
for CUBITT, and CUBITT for London |
Such are Mr. Punch's sentiments, from which he has never swerved
a hair's-breadth, and to which he adheres with the tenacity of one who
stands, upon principle. It is at the same time due to himself to say
that, like his contemporaries, he had been prepared for any contingency
that might occur, and that he had the following pa ph ready in
type, and had the Livery taken a different view of the case, these
remarks would, mutatis mutandis, have taken the place of the above
glowing eulogium.
As Mr. Punch announced last week must inevitably be the case, the
Livery has chosen SIR HENRY MUGGERIDGE by a splendidly prepon-
ºf majority. The City has vindicated its title to be ...”as
the asylum of justice, fearlessness, and incorruptibility. MUGGERIDGE is
Mayor-Elect, and a glorious triumph has been achieved. o, we
indignantly, ask, were his opponents? The Conservatives, who boast
that it is their pride stare super pias antiquas, and now indeed do stare
at the old streets in speechless dismay. These were the champions of
order and vested rights, and these men º to thrust away the lawful
claimant of the City throne, and by a coup d'état of unequalled ferocity,
to reseat a sovereign whose lease had expi MUGGERIDGE is vic-
torious, and faction and epicureanism sneak into unutterable nothing-
ness. What was the base, and indeed baseless assumption upon which
they rested their case? They *::: that MR, CUBITT had upheld the
social honours of the City, and they dared to imply that MUGGERIDGE
might be less generous and open-handed. Why, did they not know
that this noble Corn-Factor is a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour,
created by no less a personage than the EMPERQR of THE FRENCH him-
self? as he—the Chevalier—likely to tarnish the lustre of his order,
the star of the brave whose light hath shed such glory o'er the quick
and dead? His very name is suggestive of hospitality—MUG, MUGGER,
MUGGERIDGE are words redolent of the rich, atmosphere of the "...#
cup, the spiced wine in which a Mayor wishes happiness to the wor
in general, and the Aldermen in particular. We have no l e to
express our contempt for the º innocuous but not the less malevo-
lent attempt to push him from his stool, and it is with sensations of a
character too elaborate for analysis, and too recondite for utterance
that we join in the exulting shout, “London for MUGGERIDGE, an
MUGGERIDGE for London.'”
And now we hope that we have made it all right in both quarters,
and will only request that the LoRD MAYor will recollect that we have

HAPSBURG’S GREATNESS IN VENICE.
... My DEAR TEAREM, -
No doubt you will rejoice to hear how . y the constitutional
- - - end, the EMPEROR of
Austria, is making itself respected in Venetia. You will remember
that a little while ago the Austrian authorities at Venice arrested and
fined several of those persons who had the presumption to attend a
requiem celebrated on the occasion of the death of Count Cavour.
#. indeed! No rest or peace to the wicked! Well, the long-
suffering Austrian rulers did not exact the fines at the time from their
ill-conditioned subjects, and they liberated several of those perverse
offenders. This for nce has not been appreciated as, it deserved to
be; the ungrateful Venetians have made no sign, not any the least demon-
stration in acknowledgment of your great and glorious friend. What
is the consequence? That, my Tearem, we are told by the Paris cor-
respondent of the Post, according to whom :-.
“At the .#. of this month, however, the ‘Colpevoli’ were called before the
golice, and told that they must pay the fines or go to the prison of St. Severo for
eight days. . . . Many Venetians paid the fine, but others preferred the im-
prisonment. There were ladies who did not hesitate to submit to imprisonment
rather than to their florins for attending a religious ceremony in a city of his
most Catholic and Apostolic Majesty FRANcis-Joseph. Among these was Signora
GARGNANI. This lady was told by the police that if she preferred imprisonment to
the fine, “She would be placed amongst the donne di mal affare, and would be only
allowed the ordinary prison food." This lady had the pluck to accept such an alter-
native, and suffered her eight days' incarceration with such company. The Coun-
ress *::::: and the SIGNorA SERoND1 are other ladies who are in prison for the
same offence.”
These, my dear Tearem, are only a few of the obstinate ladies whom
the emergetic Austrian police has imprisoned because of their refusal to
ay fines for having attended a mass for the repose of a soul which was
ostile to the dominion of the Hapsburgs in Italy. There are many
more of them expiating their audacity in prison. In thus º:
these rebels in crinoline, the admirable police of Austria has evince
sound policy, not only administrative but also financial... Let us hope
it will succeed. FRANgis-Joseph, though a royal gentleman, such as
the Kaiser of a #. like that of Venice Qught to be, is nevertheless
a gentleman in difficulties. The finances of his Empire, you know, are
in a very bad way. The fines, therefore, under his constitutional rule,
due from delinquents guilty of having attended an objectionable mass,
were of course an object to a ma imous but needy prince. Hence
we see the wisdom exercised by º olice in endeavouring to extract
those penalties from the offenders who owed them by every possible
means, even by º: respectable ladies along with donne di mal
affare... They could not have taken a more judicious course, could they?
unless indeed they had whipped the forfeited florins out of the Italian
traitresses, after the manner of gallant HAYNAU of famous memory,
whom you should love; for, inasmuch as his scourge lacerated the backs
of the fair sex, he too was a Tearem in his way; and he tore’em in the
interest of Austria. Congratulating you on the conciliatory, liberal
and enlightened government of your constitutional and imperial friend
as instanced at Venice

A SENSIBLE FASHION.
THE attention of Paterfamilias is invited to the subjoined piece of
valuable information, for which he has to thank Le Follet:—
“The vogue for Zouaves is far from becoming extinct, there is an economical
reason which proves greatly in their favour. For instance, skirts that would other-
wise be rejected, have a very good effect when accompanied by the coquette vest
Zouave, and an elegant chemisette.”
The skirts that would, if worn otherwise than in conjunction with
the coquette vest Zouave, be rejected, may be presumed to be skirts
which want a little washing but will not stani being washed. It is
melancholy to every reflecting, mind, except that of a linen-draper or
milliner, to think how many skirts are rejected under those circum-
stances, and have to be replaced by unfortunate husbands and fathers
of limited, and precarious means, which are in a great measure confis:
cated by the Income-Tax. Any fashion which will have the effect of
making female apparel f farther and last longer than it would else, is
highly to be commended. What the coquette vest Zouave means, never
mind... A coquette, as we have before had occasion to observe, is,
according to JoHNsoN, a gay airy girl who endeavours to attract notice.
The coquette vest Zouave may be a gay airy vest constructed for the
same purpose. s: that the coquette West Zouave is, in plain English,
a flirting-jacket. Be it what it may, so long as it occasions the preserva.
tion of skirts that would otherwise be rejected, it is a boon and a
...; to Paterfamilias. Let him cast an eye on the wardrobe of
Materfamilias and the girls, and if, by the help of strong spectacles, he
can manage to make out that their skirts are in any r of rejection
from slight discoloration, or on any the like pretence, let him generously
treat them all round to the coquette west Zouave, combining elegance
on their part with economy on his own, and getting credit, at the same
time, for good taste and good-nature.
MR. SPURGEON'S ADVICE TO BACHELORS.

MR, SPURGEoN delivered a Lecture on that popular monster the
Gorilla. From a report of the celebrated preacher's observations, the
subjoined extract may conduce to the edification of our readers:—
“The worst Gorillas were bachelor Gorillas. (Laughter.) He hoped headdressed
none of that class. (Continued Laughter.) From this subject MR. SPURGEoN digressed
to the softening influence of female society, and said that the best thing every
bachelor could do was to take under his sheltering wing one who could give him
more than he could give her. (Laughter.)”
Why laughter? What was there to laugh at in this last remark of
MR. SPURGEoN’s? There are those who laugh at what they don’t
º, and such alone surely are they who could have found
aught laughable in MR. SPURGEoN's advice to bachelors. They did
not, of course, apprehend any latent fun in the fi of the bachelor's
|“sheltering wing.”. It is not to be º that they understood
|MR. SPURGEoN as insinuating that the
achelor who married was a
bird as it were; namely, a goose. And where was the joke in defining
the wife that a bachelor had better take as one who could give him
more than he could give her? In a matrimonial altercation, indeed,
there are plenty of ladies who are capable of retorting with interest on
their husbands, and giving them as good as they bring and better in
that sense of the phrase; but of course these are not such as MR.
SPURGEoN would recommend. Some wives if, in giving their husbands
heirs, they have come under his definition, cannot have likewise earned
his approval. The fellow who is so fortunate as to contract matrimony
with a y able to give him more than he can give her, can only
rationally be dºf to be one who marries a woman of property so
much exceeding his own as to pay her expenses and leave him some-
thing over. This kind of marriage, though a most felicitous transac-
tion, is a grave affair of business, and no laughing matter to any serious
mind, such as that which should actuate everybody who sits under

MEDICAL MANSLAUGHTER.
EveRY now and then, especially in the dull
season, a paragraph appears headed “Accidental
Poisoning,” or “Medicine given by Mistake: ”
on reading which, we learn in nine times out of
ten, that the servant in attendance has given the
sick patient a dose from the wrong bottle, and,
through carelessness or else imperfect ability to
.. administered some liniment instead of
some cough mixture, and has not until too late
discovered the mistake. Now, there is an Act
of Parliament which enjoins that what is poi-
sonous shall be i.i. “Poison,” which is a
short word and easy to be read. But surgeons
very often, and chemists not the less so, instead
of marking lotion bottles with the label “Poison,”
are rather apt to use fine language and to stick
upon their phials the inscription, “For External
application only,” a phrase intelligible doubtless
to nine persons out of ten, but which is likely by
the tenth either not to be spelled through, or not
rightly to be understood. , Long words are Y.:
well for educated minds, but for intellects half
cultured short ones are far better; and where
life and death may hang upon the use of them,
surely it were better to use even vulgar phrases
which would be intelligible, than terms, more
elegantly chosen, which possibly would, not.
Many a half-schooled servant, who might not know
the meaning of “external application.” would
understand the coarser caution “Not To BE Took
INSIDE,” while for persons, more, illiterate who
might entertain some doubt about the rightly spelt
word “Poison,” a label printed “Pisqx" wo
be much more likely to be quickly understood.
LocoMotive LovE.—Buss-ing.
A LABOURER NOT WORTHY OF HIS HIRE,
ALways foremost in the cause of freedom, Mr. Punch raises his loud
protest against the arbitrary and tyrannical conduct of the Government,
and specially of SIR. GEORGE GREY, Home Secretary, in reference to
the pension of MR. FIELD. To pander to the º: of the mass is
entirely unworthy of the statesman who should rule and guide it, and
SIR GEORGE GREY has taken an opportunity of showing that he shares
the feelings of the English, and of inflicting a blow upon one of the
representatives of the spy-system. MR. FIELD has been a policeman,
and has earned a retiring pension of £120 per annum. MR. º: has
set up an office for himself, and proffers his experience as a Detective
to anybody who desires to find out anything, and can pay the required
fees. Mr. Punch has read statements in the papers, and has also
received special information, which lead him to believe that the private
§. is carried on with considerable zeal and ingenuity by MR.
IELD and other professors of the noble art. Why they are to be dis-
couraged, Mr. Punch does not know. If a wife suspects that her
husband's allegation, on going out, that he has business to attend to, is
not quite correct, why is she to be debarred from the pleasure of hiring
a spy, who shall follow the husband, note what time he arrives at his
office, and what time he leaves it, whether he has improved his dress,
and whether he goes down to Greenwich or Blackwall, and with whom
so that the wife may confront him with the proofs of his du licity and
demand to be sent to her mamma; Or, on the other hand, if a husband
imagines that all his wife's interviews during the day are not narrated
him, why should he not bring home a detective, who, under the
guise of a tradesman's messenger, with some article for Mrs. Synoots's
inspection, may become, acquainted with her face, and may track her
from the milliner's to the grocer's, and thence, to her friend MRs.
WILEY’s, and thence to Kensington Gardens, and thence to the biscuit
shop, and thence home, and may furnish the husband with all this d
information? The Home Secretary does not appear to respect the
professors of detective science, and simply because MR. FiFLD has
placed some headingtohis letters which may lead foreigners to believe that
the Government has something to do with the system, the ex-detective's
pension has been stopped. He clamours, and well he may. Most English-
men do not like spies, and use hard and contemptuous words about them,
and call the system a vile one, and are inclined to kick anybody who
| is found listening at a keyhole, tampering with a letter, or boring a hole
in the wall of a room. They even prefer to be deceived, to using that
kind of means of detecting deceit. But this is a coarse, insular way of
looking at the matter, and we regret that those who have learne ... in
France, or elsewhere, to avail themselves of the advance of ingenuity,
and the subtleties of the spy-system, receive an implied slapin the face by
this discouragement to MR. FIELD. SIR GEORGE GREY should get ri
of his English notions and habits of thought, and be more cosmopolitan.
How the French officials must smile at his fastidiousness! There are
no such º: in France, where the man who º dominoes with
you, or the lady who waltzes with you, or the tailor who measures you,
or the affable stranger who smokes a cigar beside you in the Gardens,
may turn an honest napoleon by ...nº business for the benefit
of somebody else whom it may concern. Why is England to lag behind
the rest of Europe in the cultivation of Fine Arts? When Parliament
meets, does SIR GEORGE, think that he can, successfully meet the
question why FIELD's pension has been stopped, with the bureaucratic
reply that his circulars threw suspicion on the Government, or the
iºia. statement that he was disinclined to show favour to an agent of
a system which the lº le regard as mean, treacherous, and un-English.
MR. FIELD evidently thinks that these will be no answers at all.
DARING ACT OF PERAMBULATORSHIP.
We are accustomed to complain of servants, and to declare that they
are careless, inattentive, thoughtless, destructive for the mere pleasure
of destruction, and we don't know what else. Now we boldly maintain
the contrary. One fact will suffice. We have just been yºff a
nursery- § (she could not have been more than thirteen) wheel a
perambulator, with two children in it, down the steps by the Duke of
York's Column ! It’s a fact. Bump-bump went the slender vehicle,
as it descended each step, and thump-thump went our poor heart
as we watched the gradual descent of the vehicle. We expected an
accident every minute... We rushed forward to offer our assistance,
but there was not the slightest occasion for human help. With won-
erful nerve she guided the frail machine. Nothing could haye
exceeded her wonderful self-possession but her consummate skill! At
last—and those thumping five minutes were to us more than an age of
stifling suspense—she accomplished the daring act, and it was done as
coolly as you would eat an ice. And most miraculous—not a single
baby was spilt | We would not have tried that perilous feat—no, not
for all the wills and plate-chests in Coutts's cellar. Yet we have heard
ladies peevishly declare that servants do not take sufficient care of

DESCRIPTION OF AN AGRICULTURAL MEETING.
AVING to attend an Agri-
cultural Dinner at North-
ampton, LoRD LYvºpBN
is reported to have said:—
“I regret that having seen
this morning every kind of im-
provement and everystall teem-
ing with something new, when
we come together this evening
nothing new is presented to us.
We have the same speakers—
the same stale jokes — the
same antiquated imageries—
the same worn-out arguments.
(Laughter.)”
..We would not dispute
his Lordship's judgment for
the world. He evidently
knows what an º
tural meeting is; but,
knowing as much as he
does, we wonder how he
has the courage to venture
into one. Is he fond of
“stale jokes?” Does he
take any particular pleasure
in listening to “worn-out
arguments?” Has he any
- #: need to clothe his
thoughts with “antiquated
imageries?” As for the
his thoughts to himself. This open criticism is not justifi
able over the social board.
LoRD LYvEDEN should propose a prize next year for
the “best orator” at an agricultural meeting. That
probably might improve “the breed.” We wonder who
would win it? Would it be NEwdEGATE, or LoRD Robert
Montagu E, or MANNERs, or NAAs, or who? We would
back MANNERs against the whole oratorical universe (the
agricultural portion at least—that is to say, the green
art of it), but then Lord Lyveden must not enter himself
or the contest.
GROSS EQUIWOCATION.
THE subjoined advertisement embellishes the inside
back of a %. Omnibus:—

The announcement of “Domestic Black” for sale might
naturally suggest to a visitor from South Carolina, or
another Secession State, that the Domestic Institution
was one of the institutions of England. As “combining
great strength with, roughness,” our, Southern guest
might imagine that the Domestic Black would be better
suited for field labour than for in-door work, including the
care of children. The low, price of the Domestic Black

the agricultural Port answerable for that rather than his Lordship.
It was scarcely kind of LoRD LyvedEN to say in the next breath—
“There is nothing to tell you that the breed of orators is improving. (Renewed laughter.)”
...And this, too, after EARL SPENCER, and LoRD BURGHLEY, and the HoN. M.R.
WILLIERs had been speaking. He might have spared their feelings, or have kept

His Holiness has a great many subscribers. This is the
resemblance between Punch and the Pope. The difference
is that Punch's subscribers take Punch in, whereas the
Pope's subscribers are taken in by the Pope.
A QUIWER FULL OF CHILDREN.
SoME time, ago, Mr. Punch announced the appearance of a new
periodical, to be called the $." It has appeared, and is stated by
its conductors to be successful. Its apparent objects are highly praise
worthy, and Mr. Punch would be sorry to indite a word in discourage.
ment of any effort to do good. But it occurs to him that a household
conducted on the system recommended in the number of the Quiver
ºº him might be—not to put too fine a point upon it—
slightly -
An exceedingly self-satisfied Parent, complimented by a friend upon
the conversational fluency and accuracy of Parent's children, takes
credit to himself for having cultivated those gifts in his offspring by
sun
that in the Fluent Family, no child shall ever talk Nonsense. If he or
she have nothing sensible to say, he or she must hold his or her little
| tongue.
All things considered, Mr. Punch is not quite sure that this pro-
hibition is calculated to make home, particularly happy. One
BRowNING has theories upon the subject of child-nonsense, theories
which would shock the judicious Parent in the Quirer; for the lady (but
what do women know about education?) censures—it is in a lovely
passage in Aurora *...* who have not the wisdom to talk non-
sense with children. But, passing from this, and we dare say that
when out of Stern Parent's hearing, Fluent Children indemnify them-
selves for their prematured sagacity, Mr. Punch invites attention to the
!.i which Stern Parent supplies Fluent Child with pabulum for
Wise talk.
. At the beginning of each month, Parent writes a long list of “sub-
jects” upon slips of paper, and places these in a “vase.” We believe
a common jug, or a flower-pot with the hole corked up, or even a disused
hat will answer the purpose, but “vase”, is more elegant, and you can
get a stunning vase, all scroll and red and gilt, in the Lowther Arcade,
for one and eightpence. Well, every morning some one of the children
draws out a slip. He or she proclaims the word. At dinner, after
mouths have been wiped, servieties put into rings, and grace said, each
.. is expected to come out with something wise in reference to this
eme.
Parent gives a specimen of the result, in a case where the subject
drawn out had been the lively and suggestive theme, “Truth.” Mr.

who were made to torture their thoughts into the semblance of aphor.
isms and epigrams. Or, perhaps, he would have tried to provide them
with something lighter, by slipping some new subjects into the vase.
For, the laboured and stilted nonsense—yes, nonsense strictly forbidden
in fun, breaks out in earnest—which Self-sufficient Parent sets down as
the talk of Fluent Children, would, had it really been uttered, have
moved Mr. Punch's gentle soul to compassion. He will not quote it,
though, for it is not kindred with his own nonsense, but this is the sort
of thing which is to make Fluent Children:—
Polly. The word which has to-day been withdrawn from our vase,
ear parents, is Patience. As I am to * first, let me remark that
this is a quality apt to be recommended by those who do not always
evince the possession of any remarkable share of it.

improved by introducing the word “camphine,” for patience shows a
very pure spirit.

revels, or who’s for a game at Cross Questions and Crooked Answers:
Happy may be the man who has his Quiver full of such children, but
Mr. %. who adores and is adored by children generally, confesses
that he would not be very happy with the children of the Quiver.

A PUZZLE FOR A CABMAN.
THE Minutes of Education lately put before the public have received
from some people some moments of attention; and certainly the writer
of the following advertisement would be none the worse for giving half-
an-hour to any minutes that should point out how the English language
might be learnt:—
OUR POUNDS REWARD.—LOST, a valuable TURQUOISE and
GOLD BROOCH, on Thursday night, 26th. If the cabman who took two
ladies, in evening dress, from the corner of Wellington Street, Strand, to 3, Upper
Baker Street, N.W., will return the same, or any person who may have found it in
the cab, shall be gladly paid the reward offered if brought to the address given.
... The puzzles here presented are really quite as numerous as those
littered in our nursery, and to our mind they are scarcely less difficult
to solve. Whether the cabman is requested to “return the same two
ladies, or their “evening dress,” or “Wellington Street, Strand,” or
“Upper Baker Street, N.W., or “any person who may have found it
in the cab,” we are utterly unable definitely to decide. And what the
“it’ refers to is alike incomprehensible, as is the nominative which is
wanting to the “shall be gladly paid.” Which is the "address given”
is another doubtful pººl seeing that the corner of Wellington Street
is mentioned as well as No. 3, Upper Baker Street, N.W.; and what
is to be “brought” there seems a problem not less difficult, and one
that we have certainly no leisure now to solve.
If ladies who lose º word their advertisements thus loosely, they
cannot wonder much at not recovering the articles they lose. However
conscientious a cabman, may be, he cannot be expected to waste an
afternoon in endeavouring to get through such a maze as we have
quoted; and , the chances are, that after sundry scratches of his
uzzled pate, he will pitch the Times aside, and have another pot of
cer.
The Uses of Prosperity.
PROSPERITY has its “sweet uses” as well as adversity, for no sooner
oes, a man come into a little property than he instantly learns the
number of his friends; whereas, if he remained poor, the chances are
that he would have died in perfect ignorance of the fact.
WHATP AT IT AGAIN ? YOU!
Russia, enchanted at the politeness of MR. SEWARD, has found Heart
to begin interfering in a quarter where it might be thought she had
received some little discouragement the other day. She has actually
taken upon herself to apprise the Sublime Porte that she disapproves
of its treatment of .*. and intends to send vessels to
enforce her views. What does Europe think of that? Russia!
“While yet her cicatrix looks raw and red
After the English sword.”
We should much like to see the original reply, as ſº down by the
new Sultan. We wonder whether this is anything like it:—
“Son of a burnt fortress,
“Your missive has been laid at our feet, and if your own have recovered
from the bastinado so well laid on by our late brother's friends, you had better come
here and humbly ask leave to devour the letter, on your knees, in our presence. By
the soul of the Prophet, but some º: effrontery is marvellous. Are the blasted
docks of º, and are all your º fished up from the bottom of the

letter, and say what you will stand if we promise not to show it to the small-footed
but large-minded Bulwer.
“Seraglio Point. “Agréez, &c."
On the whole, Punch humbly suggests that the Autograph of all the
Russians had better attend to the manumission of his own negroes, an
leave the Montenegroes to mind their own business, QMAR PASHA
might like nothing better than giving the same hint in livelier colours.

Beside a woodland alley;
Autumnal breezes brisk and cool

And tawny swarms adown the glade

REPENTANCE RATHER TOO LATE.
SUBJoINEp is an extract from a paragraph which may be considered
singular, as having appeared in the Times:–
“SEPARATION of Aged Couples IN WoRKHouses.—At a meeting of the Guardians
of Greenwich Union, held last evening, MR. B. CARTER, chairman, MR. BASSETT, one
of the Woolwich guardians, moved, “That a committee be appointed to consider and
report what arrangements can be made for enabling married couples in the work-
house, both of whom are over 60 years of age, to live with each other, as the 23rd
section of the Act 10th and 11th of Victoria, cap. 109, declares it to be illegal to
compel such married persons to live apart.’”
The Times, whence the foregoing statement is taken, is, it is necessary
to state, simply the Times, or as the Yankees say, the London Times.
It is really and truly the Times of Fº Square. Had such a
piece of news occurred to us in an Irish Times, we might have noticed
it as the record of a truly Irish fact. That fact, related as having
occurred at Ballybog or º might have been cited as charac-
teristic of its locality. But, here, in #ngland, the Greenwich and Wool-
wich Guardians, in quorum assembled, are moved, in the twenty-fourth
year of HER MAJESTY's reign, to consider and report what arrangements
can be made for abolishing a practice which was declared illegal by an
Act of the 10th and llth. Surely this beats Banagher, or shutting the
stable-door after the steed has been stolen, or trying a man after his
execution, or anything preposterous that can be well imagined. What is
the penalty attached to the ºff. regulation which the guardians of the
reenwich Union, thus late in the day, met to talk about discontinuing *
Should they not at the same time, have been invited to consider what
steps to take in order to avoid the legal consequences which they had
incurred by persisting for a long series of years in a course of illegal
inhumanity? What would be thought of a gang of fraudulent º
tillers holding a public assembly to determine what arrangements to
adopt in order, for the future, to §. the Excise duty; the clandestine
production of spirits having been declared illicit by the statute in such
case made and provided some time ago? But it is one thing to sin
ainst the Excise Laws, and another to sin against the Poor Law,
When the sin against the latter is committed on the side of barbarity.

PUNCH*S PULPIT LOZENGES.
CLERGYMEN, and students preparing to take orders, are earnestly
advised to make a trial of these lozenges, which are highly efficacious in
making clear the voice, and rendering the utterange articulate and
distinct, They are also warranted to cure that painful stammering
and lingual hesitation with which so . nervous preachers, are
afflicted; and to impart a level, smooth, and glib pronunciation to those
whose elogution was neglected in their childhood, or whose tongues
have long been tied by some impediment of speech. Another of their
benefits is, that they assist in strengthening the voice, and so enable
weak-lunged clergymen to make themselves distinctly heard where
#. their preaching was so utterly inaudible that it could do
ittle good. They act too as preventives of that dropping of the voice
towards the close of a long sentence, to which so many parsons are so
painfully addicted; while at the same time they tend ually to cure
such oral failings as affected inability to roll the letter R. .
Mr. Punch has at his side a peck or two of Testimonials, which
thoroughly attest the truth of the above assertions, and which, as
nobody of course can be doubtful of his statements, he will not, insult
; by putting into print. He need only add, that if one trial won’t
prove the facts which have been mentioned, the purchaser will be at
perfect liberty to make another; and a third, and even fourth or fifth
will be allowed to all who put sufficient money in their purse.

WE see that there is a Continental paper published called the Corre-

never seen a copy of it, not even in a Sub-Editor's room—but we should
say that when an Italian gentleman writes to a lady to say that she may
have her letters back for a certain sum, say £2,000, that a demand of
that exacting nature takes very much the form of a correspondance

an Austrian officer, whose name is not given. The Major was shot in the abdomen, and soon after expired."
If the former of these two fools, like the latter, did get shot in the abdomen, and died
soon after, he got less than he might have had, and less, indeed, than he deserved. He might
have received a wound in the abdomen, which
would not have been quite such a coup de grâce
as that of which he “soon after expired.” He
might have had his nose shot off, and have
remained till death a ridiculous caution to duel-

the bullet of his adversary, and, his leg having
been amputated, he might have had to hobble

He has not troubled his gracious Mistress and Friend with an electric
message to ask, leave to make this revelation, but ventures at once to
#. such an idea of a Royal dinner-party, when he is there, as will
spel the uncomfortable surmises of his friend of the Telegraph. He
refers to his own private Diary for an entry º; one of his late
visits at the Palace, a diary, by, the way, which will be published
: º days, with effects which it is almost too a
en e:-
“June 27. Thursday. PAM with me all the afternoon, making jokes,
and asking advice. Sketched a speech for him on the * * * * question.
He told me some yery good things about J. R., and his funny French,
and how, asking what Concierge,” over a door at the Louvre, meant,
and being told Porter,” said it was very thoughtful of the authorities
to keep porter there for the students, so as to save them the trouble of
running out for refreshment. PAM wanted to write something for this
week's number, but I would not displace anything to make room for
him, smart as he is. GEORGE LEwis came in, and we three played at
leap-frog for half an hour, when LEwis stopped the game to explain
the athletic sports of the Ancient Greeks, and was very profound on
the Quinquertium, or five exercises. He also offered to do a review of
GLADSTONE’s Homeric book for us, promising, needlessly, to cut it up
uncommon; but as he did not think he could do it in less than thirty
to con-
columns, I didn’t seem to see it. Dressed, and to the Palace to dinner. Ins
The Q. was looking º well, and was full of kindness and
appreciation of me, as usual. F. M. seemed bored; Isuspect a Bishop
had been bothering him. The children enchanted to see me, as always,
}. party to meet some King or other; he was resented to me, but
I did not catch his name, and forgot to ask, but he seemed respectful
and to oblige., PAM sat next to him, and at intervals I heard
MASTER PAM giving him pleasant, little hints that he must dismiss his
Cabinet, or would be in a mess—that fellow PAM's coolness is incon.
ceivable. I told them a few things out of the next Number, and of
course there was a roar; but I will not do this again when the 'Bishop
OFOXFORD is at table, for Iknow he passes them off to the Archdeacons
as his own; and though he is an excellent fellow, this is not right.
The PRINCE gave a capital imitation of BUCKSTONE, supposing him to
delivering a lecture on Oolites before a scientific association.
JoHNNY RUSSELL tried a joke about ‘primitive trap,' but it was not
very, neat, and PAM told him so; but JoHNNY had his revenge after-
wards with a hit at the Constable about Cupid-ity, only nobody under-
stood it. LORD SHAFTESBURY was very emphatic about the extra-
ordinary merits and graces of boiled oysters, which is a dish he heard
of early in the year, and said that he would ask me to taste at his
house, when those bivalves came in again. He said that a good old
Aunt had told him of it, on, which LoRD CLARENDON quoted Pope,
rather more happily than civilly :—
“Let me extol a cat on oysters fed."
I capped the line, looking at JoHNNY RUSSELL–
“I’ll have a party at the Bedford Head.”
“‘So you shall, he said, very good-naturedly, “and the sooner the
better.” heart's in the right place, that John. But we could not
settle whether the beards were to be faken off, and were divided into
Shavers and Non-shavers. GEORGE LEwis thinks that the English
; eaten by the Romans, must have been pickled, and also quoted
that queer bit of CICERo about oysters increasing and decreasing with
the moon—cum lună pariter crescunt. What a memory that cove has
After dinner, I sang them a few º: songs, some of them
exceedingly clever and happy, and they shrieked at some of the rhymes,
e.g.-
“And there sits a man who by no means a Jewis,
Though he has a long nose, I allude to G. L., &c.
and I made a capital one on the F. M.
“Our Prince is a Marshal, but never can say
The ugly word No, so he's not MARSHAL NAY."
An epigram which I do not remember to have seen equalled. "Q,”an't
he,” said PRINCEss ALICE, naively. The evening was a delightful one
and when CLARENDON and I lit our cigars on the step, I was astonishe
to see that it was twelve o'clock. However, nullum tempus Regina. Got
home, and found a splendid diamond pin, sent with a respectful message,
by º SPURGEoN. Gave it to my valet, but made memorandum to
give SEURGEoN a puff one of these days. Slept well, the Palace wine
never does me any harm, and yet I must have drunk eight or nine
bottles, without counting the maraschino, which I always drink out of
a silver pint-pot.” - - -
Now, what does our friend of the Telegraph think of Palatial
dreariness?
EXOTIC SLANG.
Those Continental telegrams will be the death of us. One of them,
sent from Paris a few days since, having announced that numerous
arrivals of grain from Liverpool, had been reported at Marseilles,
appended to that statement the following remark:-
“These arrivals allow us to hope that the alimentary crisis is about to enter a

HEY FOR DISHABILLE |
“MR. PUNCH,
“AN eminent Metropolitan tailor advertises a mornin
costume ‘For Gentlemen,” described as ‘a Negligée, Milled Twee
Suit, consisting of a Cape, Jacket, West, and Trousers, the charge being
Two Guineas.” This, I suppose, is the sort of dress in which, worn on
the boulevards at Paris, and on other pavements in foreign parts where
dandies most do º; our countrymen are wont to astonish the
French and the rest of the Continental natives, and afford them harmless
amusement, to the disgust of other less independent and more sensitive
Englishmen.
“For my part, Sir, I do not by any means concur with those thin-
skinned Britons who have . been complaining of the plain but
F. : which genera { distinguishes our tourists abroad.
my opinion, the customary and characteristic garb of the English
traveller combines elegance with economy in the most desirable pro-
portions; the ratio of economy considerably preponderating over that
of elegance. Comfort, durability, and cheapness are the primary recom-
mendations of clothes all over the world. Appearance is a secondary,
or a tertiary, or a still minor consideration. Young men are now
adopting very rational habits, that is to say, habiliments. . In so doing
they ought to be encouraged. When I was a young buck, or at least
the contemporary of young bucks, my associates were very commonly
accustomed to run up tailors' bills, which their fathers had to pay. To be
sure, I never did such a thing myself, and perhaps I am ºa for it
now, when I contemplate with satisfaction the inexpensive rig of my own
ys, who are a credit, and not a debt, to their affectionate governor.
“There is little difference, I believe, between the domestic costume
of our young fellows and that in which they use to exhibit themselves
to grinning foreigners. Not quite so in respect to girls. Battered
ats and amorphous Crinolines are mere accidents of travel. They are
henomena whose causation depends on laws whereof the operation is
etermined by the dimensions of trunks and bandboxes. ey never
appear on the other side of the Channel, any more than on this, other-
wise than altogether against the inclination of the wearers. My sons
I have no occasion to complain of on the ground of their excess of
apparel. I wish I could º much for my daughters, I should be
very glad if they would be a little less particular about the shape of the
hats and Crinolines wherein they are wont to court public admiration
at home, and would accordingly be content to wear those, and all other
articles of clothing, about ten times longer than they do at present. .
“In conclusion, let me observe that the state of the human skin is
of much more importance than the hue and texture of any fabric which
may invest it. Our Continental neighbours, at a hotel or a lodging-
house, as a rule, allow you about as much water for the f se of
washing yourself as what just suffices for cleaning your teeth. This is
Christian conduct of them, no doubt. I believe they do as they would
be done by. They may ridicule the cut and the tints of a Briton's
raiment; but how about what underlies that rough exterior, on the one
hand, and their own elegant externals, on the other? What is the colour
of our respective skins? Will they institute comparisons? On whose
side will the laugh be then * Well, perhaps on theirs still. They will
deride us absurd Englishmen, for neglecting our dress, which is seen,
whilst we carefully wash and cleanse the surface of our bodies, which, on
the Boulevards and other fashionable places, is not seen. Never mind,
Let those laugh that win. A penny saved is a #. got; and milled

In fact, whymotkeep
a Spirit-of-all-work in
the house; one who
should combine the
respective offices of maid, cook, valet, commissionnaire, boots, and se-
cretary? It would be very serviceablé, would get over the perpetual
annoyance of domestics, and would effect a material saving in wages
in the course of the year. Consider, too, what an economy in board
alone there would be!—for one of the most remarkable things is, that
these Spirits do not require anything to eat or drink. There is no agree-
ment required for tea or sugar, or so much beer per diem. They live
on air; even London air doesn’t seem to disagree with them. -
Another advantage is, that they would execute their work without
the smallest noise. They do not slam doors, or tramp heavily up aud
down the stairs, or chat over the area-railings with the housemaids of
next door, They have, also, a great respect for property! You never
hear of a Spirit breaking anything, unless it may be a nervous person's
repose. “Breakages” in a respectable establishment, where a good,
stout, active Spirit was kept, would be unknown. The poor “cat”
would be no longer calumniated by having all the broken things put
upon, its broad innocent back. The work would be done noiselessly,
breathlessly, without your being even aware that any one was moving
about the house. The vexed question of “Followers” would be
effectually put to rest. The only difficulty that we can foresee would
be in satisfying oneself as to Its character. It might be a delicate

that we are sure the reader, who loves a bit of fun, . not quarrel
with us for taking it in eatenso:—
“In the 'Banner of Light," of February 2 I read a communication in regard to

portrait of my spirit-mother, and having had a communication from her to the

sit for him on the day above-named. Some three weeks ago I received a letter from
Mr. FAYETTE, stating that he received, on the day appointed, the portrait of a lady,
giving a description of it. I immediately sent for it, and have it now in my posses-
sion. My surprise can be ‘...º. when, on opening the box, I recognised in it
a true portrait of my spirit-mother—true and perfect in every particular.

and har attire was entirely different from any fashion in this country. MR. FAY-

fashion of her dress, and the very one that she used to wear before her last sickness.

Granting the above to be true-and we should be sorry to doubt it
for fear of raising all the Spiritualists, like a swarm of gnats, about our
ears—there is an end to portrait-painting. Who will patronise what
we, ma flesh-brushes, when F. can have a painting from a
Spirit R.A., without the trouble of sitting? º too, will
be summarily knocked on the head. We wonder that the Council of
the National Portrait Gallery does not patronise this new branch of the
arts....Through, this spiritual agency they could have “true and per-
fect likenesses” of all our great men, instead of buying dubious copies;

and, moreover, the “particular fashion” of each one's dress would be
stamped upon them,
It is a great pity that J. B. FAYETTE, Esq., of Oswego, N.Y., does
not live in London, or else we would instantly give him an order to
execute us portraits of all, our ancestors up to the time of ADAM
inclusive, with “the particular fashion of the dress” of each particular
period. It would be immensely interesting, and indisputably authentic.
Oh! Spirit of Humbug-for such is, Spiritualism to our vulgar eyes
—we wonder what will be thy next little caper?
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DRAR PUNCH,
... “THE annual emigration, is very nearly over, and London is
receiving back its travelling inhabitants. The West ind is of course
in a great measure still vacant, and the blinds are down in all its lordly
streets and squares. Such of its habitués as chance to be in town seem
rather more, than commonly afflicted with ennui. Solitude is apt to
conjure up blue devils, and a Swell adrift in London in desolate October
an easy victim to the azure fiends. Curiosity inciting me to visit
Rotten Row, I last week walked along it, and met nobody but nurse-
maids. Not a horse was visible as far as eye could reach, and the sole
thing to remind one of the glories of the place was the presence of two
Swells sitting languidly on chairs, and pitching stones at a short, pipe
stuck upright in the path. Perchance a thought of old Aunt Sally.”
had inspired them to this sport, and they 1. thinking of the pic-nics
fly had graced in the past season, and the elegant amusements they
had revelled in thereat, I did not hear them speak, but one can easil
conceive the conversation that were likely with them; how they vote
London in October juiced slow, and considered it a hawid baw having
to remain in it. Poor, fish out of water | Of course ’twere no use
talking of theatres to them. I never saw a Swell appear amused by any
acting, and excepting when he has to go as . in the season, I
doubt if any box-keeper ever gets a sixpence from him.
“But the West End is not solely inhabited by Swells, for there are
wise men from the East who have taken up their quarters there, ...And
they and Central Londoners have mostly yº their homeward flight,
and, after some six weeks of a quiet sea-side life, a few hours at a
theatre seem unusually tempting to them. The only question is, where
had they better go? and if they expect to be guided by the newspapers,
I fear their expectations will be à. to realise. Casting my eye
down a column of the Times, I see it stated that one play has “nightly
been received with tumultuous, applause, and another has “achieved
an unprecedented triumph,' while a third has been ‘pronounced by the
entire public press’ to be the cleverest production ever witnessed on
the stage. here all is so superlative, it is difficult of course to guess
which is the best; and Paterfamilias must often throw his Times down
in flºº and decide where he shall go by means of a toss-up.
“What effect these puff advertisements may have on minds in
fº, I am not gifted with sufficient mental insight to conjecture.
o me they are deterrent rather than attractive, for puffery in an
shape is hateful in my eyes. For this reason, may be, I went last wee
to the ºf; which is about the only theatre whence no puff ever
emanates. Its advertisements state simply what is to be played, and
what actors are §§ it; and the managers abstain from blowing their
own trumpets, thinking very wisely that such blasts are little listened
to, and still less º lauded.
“To go to the * and not see MR. Robson seems like going to
the Lord Mayor’s and not seeing any turtle. But MR. Robson is,
unfortunately, far too ill to act; and MR. EMDEN is obliged to do the
best he can without him. When the main prop of a house is suddenly
withdrawn, it is not an easy matter at once to find a substitute,
and the system of architecture that makes a house dependent on one
main prop may be open to criticism. , MR. EMDEN, has, however, suc-
.# very fairly in his improvised attempt, and deserves that due
success should succeed to his exertions. The new Jack of all Trades

has a pleasant voice and bearing, acts freshly, and with force, and when
pathetic keeps his pathos within reasonable bounds. "if"I mistake

itſ prove of value to the stage. Light Comedians just now are not so

Echo, “Don’t You wish You MAY GET HIM!”
MR. PUNCH ON SOME POPULAR DELUSIONS,
TOUCHING TRAVELLERS BRITISH AND FOREIGN.
MR. PUNCH has lately profited by the rare leisure of the dead season
to take a trip across the Channel-Pshaw! why should he disguise the
flattering fact, that he has been attending incog, the round of Royal
festivities, which have lately been exciting the curiosity of the Gobe-
mouches, and the speculations of “our own Correspondent.”
Of course when Mr. Punch receives an invitation from one of his
brother Sovereigns he doesn't think it necessary to blow his roo-too-it
over the communication, . He knows it is meant, in a friendly way—
private and confidential in fact; and so he packs up his crown and
sceptre—the famous tricorne and báton, which may some day figure in
a cabinet of our national museum like the relics of a FRITZ or a
NAPOLEoN at the Tuileries or Sans-Souci-whistles Toby to heel, hugs
Judy, embraces the baby, leaves Shallabala in charge, and drops in at
Potsdam, or Carlsruhe, Brussels or Ostend, Compiègne, Biarritz, or
even at flombières, unannounced and unattended—but never unwel-
me.
. Diplomatists and Duchesses ask seriously who is the little grey man
in the great coat with the odd protuberance before and behind, and the
overshadowing cocked-hat, from under which little is visible but the
gleam of a lightning eye, and the tip of a º nose, who
rides so well forward with the principal group at the reviews, who is
the life and soul of the princely pic-nics and parties de plaisir, and who
is in at the death at all the stately stag-hunts P How little they suspect
that these modest habiliments conceal the great Potentate of Public
Qpinion—whose counsels are more free than welcome alike at the
Tuileries and Carlottenburg, at Peterhof, and Aranjuez, but whom
neither Louis nor LEoPold, nor FREDERick-WILLIAM, ALExANDER
FRANÇis-Joseph, nor IsabłLLA, ever dream of saying “ Not at homeº
to, when he chooses to knock at their Imperial or Royal doors.
But Mr. Punch's present purpose is not to discuss Royal gossip, or to
reveal Imperial confidences. He rather wishes to confine himself to
certain points touching matters continental, of more interest to subjects
than to princes—and especially to certain points of comparison between
his own dearly beloved fellow-countrymen, and their nearest foreign
*ś in France and Germany.
re restiariá in the first place. The Times abuses John BULL, and
Madame son Epouse, for going about on their travels got up as Guys–
for shocking foreign prejudices, and showing their contempt for
foreign opinion, by sporting eccentric shooting-coats, flaming flannel
shirts, reckless wide-awakes, and worse still on the ladies' part, by the
French was not only limited, but anything but
perfect. Wishing to explain that the º:
revious to rushing into action, was in the
abit of striking his big chest, he said, “Wous
comprenes, mongsoo, le savage bétefrappeson grosse

mare,”—interrupted the polite Frenchman. But
he was evidently puzzled to understand where the
beast got his drum. And this is the way that
Natural History is written
general shabbiness and ugliness of their travelling toilettes, and head
r.
Now, making every allowance for the desperate necessities of news-
paper writers in the dead season, and admitting that British travellers
−male and female—include specimens both of the Guy and the Gorilla,
Mr. Punch must put in his protest against any such wholesale indict-
ment as this of his compatriots en voyage. On the contrary he is pre-
pared to maintain, after surveying mankind from Calais to Calatafimi
—dining with comprehensive knife and fork from Parisian Tables
d'hôte to German Rund-tafeln-bounding on the light fantastic toe
from the cancans and Rigol-bouchades of Champs-Elysées dancing-rooms,
to the waltzes and schottishes of Kursaalball-rooms-squaring all circles,
from those which surround the marble-topped tripods of the Boulevards
to those that crowd and elbow each other about the green-covered and
ſº tables at Homburg, Spa, or either Baden-familiar with all
vels of nature and man, from the flats of Belgium to the Alps of
Switzerland,-that, as a rule, the wearer of the best travelling suit (for
stuff, cut, and condition together), the cleanest, shirt, the least raga-
º or ridiculous hat, the soundest and shapeliest foot covering, is a
riton.
Englishmen turn meater and sweeter out of a railway carriage after a
night's rattle, restlessness and frowst than any other people; they are
more presentable, more like gentlemen, after an Alpine scramble amon
lacier and moraine, crevasse and couloir; they present better brushe
air, and cleaner hands and faces and whiter linen at the Table d'hôte
under difficulties, and fall into less profound abysses of misery and
degradation in sea-going steamers, than the natives of any other country.
I, Punch, am s ºf now of the men. For the ladies—bless them!
—I am º to admit § don't understand dress as an art so well
as their French sisters. Millinery and dress-making have their home
and head-quarters, in France, just as cooking has; and for the same
reason—because the inferiority of the raw material makes the elaborate
and well-studied dressing of it a matter of sheer necessity.
Where Heaven sends us meat (according to the proverb) we may
put up with cooks of Qld Nick's providing, and yet not starve; but the
people for whom Old Nick seems to have purveyed the meat, must,
orce, seek a solace and compensation in heaven-born cookery.
But, apart from their national shortcoming in the art of dress, I
maintain that Englishwomen, on their travels, deserve as much
said of them as Englishmen. Bless their fresh faces, and smooth hair,
and clean cuffs and collars! In these particulars, what French or
German woman can hold the candle to 'em P. I declare, the other day,
at Nuremberg, when fairly worn down and depressed by the ugliness
and unattractiveness of the womankind of Waterland, I thought ]

should have hugged, a couple of sweet, sunny-faced, modest English
maidens who descended, like a burst of sunlight, into the low-roofed,
smoke-sodden Speise-saal of the “Ostrich,” under the convoy of an
imposing Mamma, and a worthy Paterfamilias much ground down and
gravelled by luggage and º together. -
I admit that the plain British female º on her travels, and
maybe dowdy. But I maintain she is not a whit dowdier, and generally
not half so disgusting, as her plain sister of France or Germany, unless
where French coquetry has succeeded in disguising the defects of the
meat by the dressing and garnish, -
Considering what this feat implies, on the part ºf the foreign female,
of concealment and pains, of suppressio ver, and suggestia falsā-the
ins and puffs, the tails and tresses, the wadding and wire, the milliners'
#. and the transport of the batterie de toilette,_who will say that
the British matron, with all her indifference to coquetry and its
triumphs, is not the preferable helpmate of the two, whether for home
or travelling use? But this I will maintain, that an attractive English-
woman loses less of her attractiveness under the necessities and acci-
dents of travel than any of her Continental rivals. She has a quality
of purity and freshness about her which seems to º all soil, whether
º or moral, as the oil in the duck's ºf and drives off the
water-drops from his plumage; and, as a rule, her clothes, and her
way of wearing them, have the same merits of freshness and purity in
comparison with those of her rivals. --- -
sthenis the first proposition I am }º to maintain against all
comers: that English travellers, of both seres, are, as a rule, the best-
dressed travellers in the world.
My next proposition is like unto it, viz.: that the English abroad are
the best-mannered travellers, and at home the best-mannered dealers with
travellers, to be found in the circle ºf civilised nations.

that the changes o
a “cropper” are every day incurred, with the chances of the cracking of
some ſearned pate. As the loss of a lawyer is too terrible to contem-
plate, we will not pain our readers by calculating what are now the
chances of an accident, every time a counsel puts on his stuff or silk.
Suffice it that those chances would of course be much decreased, were
Crinoline adopted to distend the legal robes, and prevent their tightly
twining round the legal legs. It may be urged indeed that Crinoline is
in itself a cause of danger, and that many lady-wearers, have been
tripped-up and maimed by it. But such mishaps have only happened
when its amplitude has been in marked excess of what is needed for
keeping one's gown free from twisting round one's legs; and though
*...*. women may like to risk their limbs for the sake of such
exuberance, we are sure strong-headed lawyers would never dream of
doing so, and would confine within safe bounds their crinolineal
ex -
e need not enlarge on the advantages of Crinoline, to male wearers
at least, and when worn within duelimits. Howit would tend to keep
the legs cool, and prevent a man from ſº over-heated in an argu-
ment, must º be patent to the dullest of perceptions; nor can it
be less clear that Crinolme would give a certain air of gre tness which
many of our Ciceros now lamentably lack. We often hear of little
Barristers swelling with importance, and trying to look big, when they
are making what they think will be considered a great speech; and
how vastly in this way Crinoline would help them, it is needless that
we state. Neither need we dwell upon the obvious improvement which
Crinoline would be to the appearance of our counsel, supposing that
they chose to try and cut a swell in it. Instead of hanging limp and
loose as though it were not made for him, a lawyer's gown, when well
stuck out with whalebone ribs and steel, would sit so as to add some-
what of true dignity to the figure, and would impart a graceful bearing
where is now a clumsy slouch. Instead of skulking through the streets
as though half frightened to be seen, which too often is the case in
their º scaregrow robes, Counsel when in Crinoline would feel
conscious of their altered looks, and would walk along erect with a
swagger and a swing, so as to show of how well their gowns were cut,
A man wºuld take a pride and pleasure then in his Court robe, and
instead of slipping out of it the instant he left Court, would more likely
take to wearing it when he had no occasion, simply for the reason that
he looked so vastly wellin it.
. The ladies, bless, them! would of course approve of the new fashion,
for any novelty in dress is always charming in their eyes, and it is so
seldom they can get men to take interest in it. But when Counsel
robe in Crinºline there will be another bond between a husband and
his wife, and still more will he regard her as whalebone of his whale-
bone, and steel rib of his steel. º little meetings will be
secretly convened for the evenings when dear CHARLEs’s new Crinoline
comes home, or dear Augustus’s man-milliner has promised to attend,
to see how many yards must be let into his gown so as to make it
nicely sit. Indeed, we should not be surprised to hear fond MRs.
BRIEFLEss say at breakfast to her lord, before hurrying him to the
'bus, “Dear, do come with me shopping in your Crinoline to-day;
you've really no idea howertremely º you look in it!”
This thought must in itself be sufficient to make fashionable the
fashion we suggest. If we show that it will have the approbation of
the ladies, we need surely say no more as a plea for its adoption; for
the antry of lawyers is as well known as their learning, and they
would even shave their whiskers off to win a woman’s smile, if it were
woman’s wish to see them with shorn cheeks.

seemingly boasts of a million bales, that it would, out of the lot, just

|BRITISH AND FOREIGN LOYALTY.
By Telegram from Compiègne, when the KING OF PRUssIA arrived
there the other evening, and was met by the EMPEROR OF THE FRENch
at the terminus, MR. REUTER received the important information
ensuing :-
“Their Majesties proceeded from the terminus to the Palace in an open carriage
without any escort, the people shouting by the way, “Long live the King ! Long
live the Emperor!”
Those §: who follow at the wheels and heels of Royalty, shouting,
are doubtlessly incorrectly described as “the ” people. They are only
some of the people, surely. The class of persons accustomed to express
their feelings by shouting must be a peculiar, one. A psychological
inquirer would like to exist a few minutes in the consciousness of an
individual capable of waving his hat and bawling under the emotion
excited in his mind by the sight of a prince. Were this practicable, a
philosopher might so be enabled to, understand the feelings of the
gentlemen whose figures, brandishing hats, occupy the foregrounds of
prints in the illustrated papers, representing a Royal party on a railway
latform, or Royalty engaged in laying the first stone of an institution.
n this country, the cries and gestures of these demonstrative persons
arise, no doubt, from genuine enthusiasm. In some other countries can
it be possible that applause is sometimes arranged, and hired?
Rumoured Perversion.
THE Ami de Religion announces that the Count DE CHAMBORD is
about to undertake a Yº: to Constantinople. This is probably not
to be taken as a piece of religious intelligence. In going to Constan-
tinople, the Count DE CHAMBORD will not turn Turk, any more than
the PRINCE or WALEs would (whatever the Record might say) neces-
sarily turn Papist if he were to go over to Rome.
A MONUMENTAL QUESTION.
WE believe it is a regulation at the National Portrait Gallery, that a
certain number of years must have elapsed after death before the
portrait of a recognised genius, or hero, can be received. If this
species of quarantine is requisite with a portrait, why not also with a
statue? §. think it is doubly necessary with the latter, inasmuch as
it is far easier to remove a picture than it is a statue. When once a
twelve-foot monument of granite and, metal has been planted in a
public lºgº. it becomes a very difficult operation indeed to di
it up again. ... Some such regulation, like that in force at the Natiºn
Portrait Gallery, is, in our opinion, absolutely wanted with regard to
our statues, or else London promises to become in a very few years
nothing better than a caricature collection of the very weakest brazen
mediocrities. Why, you would see almost greater evidence of talent
and worth in any stone-mason's yard in the New Road!
As for ourselves, we are perfectly disinterested in the matter. We
should like to see any wild enthusiast daring to propose a statue to us!
However, our career has been of that purity and celebrity, that we feel
sure a grateful posterity would never allow so gross an insult to be paid
to our beloved memory,
NOTICE FOR A GENERAL MOURNING.

PAINFUL AND HUMILIATING ContRAST To THE DISADvaNTAGE of our Poor LITTLE ENGLISH
TRAVELLER, of Course.
PATENT POTATOES.
WALKING out the other day, as
men should do, with our wife, we
saw announced in a shop window
that there were there on sale a lot
of “Patent Gravity Selected Po-
tatoes.” . The motion of potatoes
being chosen for their gravity
struckus asso funny that we almost
lost our own, and we began to
fancy greengrocers inviting us to
purchase a peck of peas selected on
account of their solemnity, or a
bundle of asparagus as being most
sedate. A smiling lot of seakale
as a contrast might be offered, and
a comic cauliflower would prove a
tempting novelty to palates, tired
of grave potatoes, or surfeited with
serious beans. The idea, too, of a
patent being granted for potatoes
puzzled us as much as the choice
of them for gravity, and we more
than half resolved to go into the
shop and ask for information how
the grant had been achieved. But
we make it a strict rule not to
open a shop-door when our wife is
with us, for fear our doing so be
forthwith cited as a gº for
her doing the same. So we remain
still in the dark about these pa-
tented potatoes.
A THIEF's CoNyiction.—A con:
irmed young Thief is convinced
that “prison isn't 'ealthy.” He
attributes this to the “cutting
'air” that prevails there.
THE ALLOCUTION ACCOUNTED FOR,
According to the Paris correspondent of a daily contemporary:—
“Despatches from Rome say that the Pope and CARDINAL ANToNELLI have taken
to drinking champagne, and abusing the whole world under the influence of that
pleasant beverage.”
At first sight this announcement had the suspicious appearance of a
hoax, expressly intended to take in Punch—but he is a young man from
the country, and you don’t get over him The Pope's last allocution,
owever, can leave no doubt on the mind of anybody that it is perfectly
true. e imaginary atrocities which his Holiness asserts to have been
perpetrated by the Piedmontese Government, and the abusive epithets
which he heaps on the fancied authors of those outrages, are strongly
indicative of the effect of champagne, if not brandy and water.
. Having blackguarded the ministers of VICTOR.EMMANUEL with a
violence which must have been vinous or alcoholic, the Holy Father
goes on to vituperate, in the same strain, certain persons in the States
of Mexico, for committing just the same enormities, “setting,” says his
Holiness, “an example never before seen.” Why by his own showing,
it had been set by Ricasoli and his colleagues. This is the oblivion of
#: dotage or drunkenness; there is too much reason to fear, of the
atter.
The Pop E may keep in his cabinet or chest-of-drawers a whole lot of
abusive allocutions handed down to him by his predecessors, and may
haye picked that one which he delivered the other day out of a pigeon.
hole. It is full of stock phrases—“dens of robbers,” “schools of false
doctrine,” “offspring of darkness,”, “pernicious and abominable
writings.” &c., turning up like “sidera coeli" and “consonat omne
nemus,” in a schoolboy's verses. If it was merely a traditional allocu-
tion, we can, only conclude that the Pope was too tipsy to adapt it with
any verisimilitude to existing facts; intoxicated insomuch as to make
one part of it contradict the other.
How could the Pope, if he had been anything like sober, talk about
the “testimonies of réal affection, of unflinching ſidelity, of devoted
submission and generous, liberality,” lavished upon him by the Roman
É.i. It is lucky for him that “PoMTIUs PILATE * has not taken
im at his word, and left him to the protection of his devoted Romans.
Qf course the Holy Father delivered his allocution in Latin—of
which we have not the text. We only know that it began with
“Yenerabiles Frates,” which we can imagine him to have turned into
something like Wei'rabsh Frarrah, if the consistory in which he
—s
delivered it was preceded by a symposium with ANTONELLI; who at
one of these champagne bouts will probably gº thrusting his head out of
window, and singing through his nose, the following notification to the
City and the Globe, all and sundry, whomsoever it may concern, that is
to say everybody:-
Impletur vini Campagni Papa, elirius est lepide, et sibi elegit nomen
Clicquotus secundus ;
or, to translate the Latin into idiomatic, and appropriately, accented
English, “Pope 'sh gosh 'sh shkinful o' Ch’mpagne, 'sh jolly drunk, an’
'shºshided to call’s, shelf by shºname o' Clicquot SHEcoSD.”
We will not believe the Pope's allocution to have been a tissue of
deliberate inventions. ...We will suppose that he spoke it in his ales and
his angers and metheglins, his wraths and cholers and champagnes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
onourED PUNCH,--Of course you saw
that newspaper report the other day of
how some bricklayers broke into a bin of
fine old port, and swilled it down as
freely as though it had been swipes, one
of the party actually mixing it with tea!
Don't you think this a sad proof of the
want of education among the working
classes, and should not proper steps be
4, taken to prevent as far as possible the
change of its regurrence? The bare idea
of “twenty port’. being swallowed down like, porter is a dreadful
thought for men of meditative minds. One would at least be glad to
know that such good stuff were rightly relished, though one might
not get the luck of tasting it oneself. I would suggest then that
a wine class be started in our day-schools, whereby the palates of our
poor might receive in some degree a vinous education, that in the case
of any windfalls—or more correctly wine-falls—they might know how
to smack their lips over a good ..., and to drink it with that revc-
rence which surely is its due. To swill down port or claret out of a
pint pot appears to educated tastes a highly barbarous proceeding; yet
there are doubtless thousands of our fellow countrymen who would not
hesitate to do so if they only got the chance. Let us then endeavour to
enlighten their crass ignorance, and to teach them how good wine
should properly be sipped. To drink a glass of wine so as to extract
the highest possible enjoyment from it, and not to let a whiff of the
bouquet escape unrelished, is one of the fine arts that requires great
cultivation, and only constant practice will enable one to master it. Of
course we can’t expect our boors and bricklayers to do so, but we may
at least improve their understandings so far as to prevent their mixin
ort with tea, Such acts are a disgrace to a civilised community, an
for one shall not feel satisfied until they have ceased.
“If my suggestion be thought feasible, I shall be happy to subscribe
a few dozens from º to be used º way of practice in the class
first set on foot. d if you in your benevolence will act as, the
receiver of similar donations, I have very little doubt they will be

year, and certainly his presence would be the most welcomed by the
ºuis classes in this country—and that is, KING COTTON, from
merica.

HOW TO PUNISH SOLDIERS.
Tire cat o' nine tails clearly has as many lives as tails, or it would
long ago have died from the attacks which have been made on it... Page
after page, and volume after volume, hath Punch scathed it with his
sarcasm and seared it with his scorn, and tried in every way to exhaust
its vital breath. It still drags on, however, a lingering existence, and,
though not so strong in favour as it was, it is by no means yet entirely
bereft of lively vigour. This the following scrap of military intelligence
will show:—
“On Monday the men of the 9th depot battalion were assembled on early parade
in Colchester Camp, to witness the infliction of the sentence of a court- ial upon
Private J. REARDoN, of the 6th depºt, who had been found guilty of drunkenness
and striking a non-commissioned officer. The prisoner, who is an old soldier, having
been in the scrvice upwards of 20 years, had been frequently convicted of military
offences, and was now sentenced to receive 50 lashes and undergo 84 days' imprison-
ment. He received his punishment without saying a word, and was afte
marched to the hospital, whence he will be removed to a military prison to unde
the remainder of his sentence so soon as he has recovered from the effects of the
flogging.”
This soldier, we are told, had been “frequently convicted,” and no
doubt had nearly as frequently been flogged. One infers this from his
silent reception of his punishment, which shows that, like the eels to
skinning, he was º well used to it. His back, doubtless, had
been toughened by the whippings it had borne; unlike a bit of beef,
which is made tender by much beating. Now, the object of all punish-
ment is to deter and to amend; but what good in either way has
flogging ever done to so back hardened an offender? Where, then, is
the use of brutally persisting in it, seeing that no benefit appears to be
derived from it? -
Again, to put in prison for more than eighty days a soldier who is
being supported by the country, seems to us, as taxpayers, a waste of
bread and gruel, or whatever other viands he may there be furnished
with. Drunkenness is bad, and striking officers, in point of discipline,
is worse: but for neither of these offences. nor for both of them
together, would we imprison an old soldier for four and eighty days.
If, as in this case, he had frequently offended, there would be no more
good in confining than in flogging him; and the best, as well as
cheapest, thing that could be done with him would be to brand him in
the books as useless and incorrigible, and at once dismiss him from the
service he disgraced. , Surely, were it known that on a third or fourth
offence a soldier would be thus kicked out of his employment, there
would be far fewer old offenders in the ranks; and there would be a
saving both of whipcord and of victuals, were this punishment imposed
instead of ºf and imprisoning offenders whº are proved to be
defiant of them both. In the name then of economy, as well as of
humanity, we ask that some such step as we suggest be taken to free
the British Army from blackguards who disgrace it, and whom the cat
or the black-hole are proved incapable to cure.
A DOMESTIC CALAMITY.
LAST Sunday, a Fire was discovered in the drawing-room grate of
MR. N. PEGKBR, a large baby-linen manufacturer, in the neighbour-
hood of Lamb's Conduit Street instantly the Fire was discovered, the
alarm was given by one of the servants, when many minutes did not
elapse before the Fire was effectually put out by MRs. N. PECKER, who,
in the most indignant terms, declared she would not have a Fire in
.# house of hers at this early period of the year. Who was going to
olish the steel bars?—she was audibly heard to express her earnest
esire to know. , We understand there was no damage done, beyond a
ha'porth of wood being consumed; but there is no knowing what might
have been the consequences, as there was a large scuttle brimful of
goals, not more than a couple of lº. distance from where the Fire
first broke out. "The origin of the accident is not known, but it is
strongly suspected that MR. N. PEcker was the incendiary himself, as
he was heard only a few minutes before to declare that “he wished the
blazes he could get warm.” The matter, however, has since been
hushed up. It is most fortunate the fire ended where it did, as, from
the inquiries we have since made, we do not think MR.N. PECKER is
in a position to display the smallest possible amount of assurance, or
insurance, either; and in the absence of that, the house might, to speak
familiarly, have been made considerably “too hot to hold him.”

THE RESPECT PAID TO PROPERTY.
IN a statistical paper, we read that “the National Museums, the
Palaces, the Tower, Greenwich Hospital, and Kew Gardens, were
visited, in the course of last year, by nearly 3,000,000 people.” Will
any fine prejudiced Tory, of the good old school, who delights in harping
upon the mischievous propensities of the lower classes, oblige us with
the information as to the exact amount of damage committed within
that period by those 3,000,000 people? IIe must fic surprised to learn
that there is a single picture, or curiosity, or work of art, or tree, or
shrub, or flower, or the smallest thing of value, left in any of those
public buildings!
PAINTING THE LILY.
We read that a short time back a Frenchwoman made her appear-
ance at the Insolvent Debtors' Court, who described herself as “an
Enameller of Ladies' Faces.” It is a source of congratulation that the
business was not a profitable one, for it would have grieved us exces-
sively to learn that our beautiful countrywomen lent their countenances
to any process that tended to make them smooth-faced in the finished
manner that Continental ladies frequently are. Enamel may do very
well for the faces in a pack of cards, but then English beauties need not
enter into competition with painted Queens of Hearts; for they are
winning enough of themselves without resorting to any such superficial
advantage as bismuth, or arsenic, or any similar poisonous ingredient.
Moreover, a face that was cnamelled would be liable to chip, and we
have serious doubts whether a lady's nose, that was in that flawed con-
dition, would stand out to the best advantage, even though it were set
off, in the way of tasteful uniformity, by the most beautiful of chip
bonnets. Then, think of the vulgar remarks that would infallibly be
made. Fancy aheavy dragsman saying with the most languid contempt,
as though he were expatiating on a rare specimen of damaged crockery:
“Yes, she certainly is one of Nature's finest bits of porcelain, but what
a pity she is chipped'."

A TRULY ENORMOUS NUISANCE.
The following statement is made by Musicus in the Times. Musicus
had applied for some reserved seats at Exeter Hall for the oratorio of
Elijah, and there were none to be had:—
“On inquiry I ascertained the somewhat amusing fact that nearly 400 seats have
been sacrificed to—Crinoline ! The Hall holds 3,000 seats, of 16 inches each ; but
the present fashion requires 18, and reduces the number of sittings by 370 or 375.”
The above statement being a brief and eloquent cypression of a
deplorable state of things, there are only two words in it for which
Musicus might have been judiciously advised to substitute others—
“somewhat amusing.” Instead of “somewhat amusing,” he should
have written “very disgusting.” If civilisation is indicated by dress
that of the present day is receding, and has in a great measure recede
É the degree which it stood at in the Bellaston era. MusicUs cou-
nues:-
“When HANDEL produced his Messiah for the benefit of a charity in Dublin, the
manager, are reported to have requested the ladies to dispense with hoops for the
ºccasion.
All womanhood is ſortified with hoops again. At the same time, all
Europe is armed. As it was in the old times of ferocity and frivolity,
so it is now. Disaffection to the reign of Peace coincides with rebellion
against the rule of Taste; and France is at the bottom of both cala-
mities. . When France sleeps, Europe is tranquil; when France is
agitated, Europe is in iºn. So France glories in saying. To
these boasts she can add another brag. When France masquerades in
the old clothes of preposterous vanity, Europe also wears Crinoline.
Place aua dames / our neighbours may well exclaim. We too have also
some cause to cry “Room for the ladies 1’’ when 400 seats in Exeter
Hall are sacrificed to hoops. What a mean contemptible nation we
shall be, male and female, if we cannot somehow agree to reject that
edict of imperial petticoat government, dictated by France, which not
only disfigures the women of England, but also incommodes them, and
not only incommodes them, but likewise those who pay for their un-
comfortable excess of apparel, which encumbers, and crowds, and
crushes us, and pushes them off our stools.
There only wants some sensible heroine to bell, or rather to disbell,
the cat, and lead her sex in shaking off the yoke which absolute French
absurdity has imposed on their corporeal circumſerence,
GLORIOUS GALAXY OF TALENT.
Both PRINCE NAPOLEoN and ToM THUMB have been stopping at
that magnificent Hotel, the St. Lawrence Hall, in Montreal, at the same
time. Both were tremendous favourites: in fact, it would be difficult
to say which of the two stood the higher in the public estimation. If
it were to be measured by kisses, we should decidedly say that the
General was more popular with the ladies. By a private arrangement,
so as not to clash, the Prince and the General received on different
nights. It was reported that the General had challenged the Prince to
give a series of representations, a la NApoleon BoSAPARTE, in cos-
tume, and everything complete, but we can only say that, at all events
the challenge, if oſtered, was never accepted; and we think the Prince
displayed unusually good taste in declining it.
THE ANGELIC DOCTOR.
OUR friend and contributor, DR. CUMMING, has delivered a lecture
at Manchester on the old subject. He sticks to it that 1867 will see the
world out, in some way, and will, at least, be the end of all º ;
and if we exist, it will % in an unchronological period...We have not the
least idea what this sort of living will be, or whether it will hurt much;
but one thing is quite, certain, namely, that if there is no more time,
reachers will not be able to waste time in talking intolerable nonsense.
ºil. DR. CUMMING declares that, whatever change, may be
wrought in us, he, for one, does not desire to be an angel. DR. CUM-
MINg, for shame, Sir!. Mock modesty is a mark of bad breeding. As
if you did not know that you are an angel already! Ask the ladies of
your flock, ye ould dissembler! Flap yer wings, ye ould deluder, and
stop that sort of thing!
A Vicious Court Circular.
The Times said a very rude thing, we hope unconsciously, in a leading
article on the interview between the KING or PRussia and the EMPERoit
of the French. It said that the two sovereigns “had got into a
vicious circle.” Now Punch, who knows everything, knows that, the
phrase is one of dialectics. But º who don't know everything
may remember what MIRABEAU said, when an oratorical opponent
announced that he should now shut up M. MIRABEAU in a vicious
circle. “What? Is the honourable member going to embrace me?
Did the two Sovereigns embrace?

A MODEL MISCELLANY.
That admirable Roundabout Paper, the Globe (wespeak geometrically
only, for consistency is one of its many merits), is a very entertaining
miscellany, and a great comfort during the club hour between ordering
your dinner and getting it. Not the least of its attractions is its concise
summary of the news of the current day. And not the least of the
attractions of that summary is the mode in which fashionable intelli.
gence is relieved, sandwich fashion, by general information. , You read ºf
the travels of a Duke, and next you are told of the flight of a duck.
Following the announcement that MR. Roebuck is at Scarborough §
hope we are right, and beg his pardon, in advance, if we err as to a fact
of such magnitude), we read that the show of terriers in Holborn was
most intercsting. We learn that a group of small celebrities have gone
into Staffordshire to attend an agricultural meeting, and then we are
apprised that large flocks of magpies have becn noticed crossing th;
eastern counties. Olher things worth º are thus interspersed
among things which may not be so well worth knowing, and the com-
bination is very felicitous. We conceive this to be a great improve:
ment on the ordinary dull string of fashionable announcements, and would
immortalise the invention by offering a specimen, from recollection:-
MR. HENLEY has been ...i on a visit with the noble owner of
Battleaxe Castle, but is expected to return to his own residence in the
course of five or six days or a week at most.
The inhabitants of some of the houses in the Regent's Park have been
of late disturbed by incessant growling of an unusual description. It
has been ascertained that this proceeded from a fine old bear in the
Zoological Gardens, who evinces much dissatisfaction at the whine of a
French poodle recently introduced.—Marylebone Mirror.
LoRD ROBERT MoWTAgu has been pheasant-shooting for the last
week in the neighbourhood of Chichester.
“The best way,” says RocheroucAULD, “of silencing a bore is the
going out of the room in the middle of one of his melancholy disquisi-
tions.”
MR. DisrAELI, who is in the enjoyment of excellent health and spirits,
has been making a short tour in Wales, but is expected at Hughenden
Manor on Thursday next.
“It is strange to observe the unwilling yet complete obedience which
a certain class of animal is compelled to yield to the superior intelligence
of a creature of a higher order. Reluctantly, but submissively, animals
of a bucolic character follow the guidance of a vigilant sheep-dog, and
receive his prompt punishment of their errors with displeased murmurs,
but without attempt at resistance.—Farmers' Chronicle and Agricul-
turist's Gazette.
LoRD PALMERSTON on Friday last inspected the Yeomanry of the
Bumblepuppy, district, and pronounced a warm eulogium upon their
soldierly bearing, and the absence of any tumbling off horses, even at
the sudden discharge of fire-arms.
There seems to be no valid reason for the apprehension that appears
to have been felt lest there should not be an adequate supply of butter,
this autumn, in the rural districts.-Mark Lane Erpress.
LoRD RUSSELL, after the Newcastle banquet, at once returned to
town, and attended the Cabinet Council on Wednesday last.
..“It may be considered generally true, that a reasonable quantity of
silence befits a wise and same man, but it by no means follows that a
box is full because the lid is shut down.”—Carlyle.
LORD DUDLEY has been delivering a speech in Worcestershire, and
has spoken in harsh and contemptuous terms of the contest in América.
He said, “the most childish and suicidal folly was going on on the other
side of the Atlantic, between the horrible trade of slavery on the one
hand and blackguard cowardice on the other.” -
. The report of that admirable institution the Asylum for Idiots has
just been issued, and it is gratifying to state its resources are pros-
perous, and that owing to the excellent arrangements of the architect
i. is still accommodation ready for any unfortunate who may need
Shelter.
A Natural Acquaintance.
In GEORGE HERBERT (HERBERT on Herbs ought to be a good
authority) we meet with the following lines:–
“Herbs gladly heal our flesh, because that they
Find their acquaintance there.”
We do not know what herbs they can be that find acquaintance with
the human body, unless they are Simples? Extremely touching, and
flattering, we are sure
A PROPIIECY NOT VERY DIFFICULT or FULFILMENT - MR. Bowy ER
declares there are as many good Popes in the Romish See as ever yet
came out of it.
A WOULD-BE AUTO DA FE.
THE good cause of Spiritualism is highly indebted to the Bishop of
BARCELONA. That exemplary prelate, the other day, was so good as to
order three hundred volumes, including various periodicals, on the
subject of spiritual manifestations, seized by the police on the shelves
of a bookseller, to be publicly consigned to the flames on that especial
part of the esplanade of his episcopal city whereon criminals condemned
to death are wont to be executed. This auto da fé was celebrated with
the pomp beſitting so awful a ºf A priest presided over the
bonfire; his reverence was attired in full canonicals, and held a torch
in one hand and a cross in the other. A public notary and his clerk
also attended for the purpose of legally and formally recording the fiery
judgment executed upon these works of darkness, to which all the
ceremony observed in their destruction, will attach an importance that
cannot but greatly attract readers to i. perusal, and much increase
the circulation, of similar productions,
As the priest and his assistants withdrew from the scene of execution,
they were assailed with storms of hisses, and shouts of “Down with
the Inquisition' " It is thus clear that in causing spiritualistic works
to be burnt, the Bishop of BARCELONA has done somewhat, and per-
haps not a little, to render Popery unpopular in Spain, and promote
the ſº of Spiritualism in that country,
The right reverend prelate might have adopted the less happy plan
of burning the obnoxious volumes quietly, as another more discreet
ecclesiastic disposed of certain story-books of knight-errantry, treating
them as mere mischievous trash. But he fortunately thought proper to
make their cremation public, and cause it to be performed with all the
honours of exorcism, No doubt the priest, who attended cross in
hand, duly sprinkled the condemned productions with holy water, with
the idea of adding fuel to the fire that consumed them, and expelling
those particular spirits which he believed to be the agents that operate
in Spiritualism.
The Bisliop of BARCELONA is evidently the right man in the right
place, and there at the right, time. Two or three centuries ago he
might have got hold of the authors of the above-mentioned publications
on spiritual phenomena, and have caused the former, under the name of
necromancers and sorcerers, to be reduced to ashes along with the
latter. That would not be so pleasant for Spiritualists as the merely
symbolical and typical martyrdom of being burnt in print. . As it is
i. Bishop can burn nobody along with forbidden books except himself,
in burning, as it were, his own ſingers.
INCREDIBLE HUMBUG.
THE following statement with regard to the prisoner, CoGAN, who
was hanged the other day at the Old Bailey, protesting his innocence
to the last, occurs in the Times:—
“The body was removed after being suspended the usual time. An application
was afterwards made for permission to take a cast of the head and face, but, acting
on the advice of Mr. Gibsos, the prison surgeon, that in his opinion such a pro-
º: was unnecessary for any purpose of science, the Sheriffs declined to assent
to it.”
The reporter of the foregoing must have made a mistake. . No
surgeon, surely, co ave expressed the opinion, attributed to
MR. GIBsoN. There are few people who do not think that there is
something in phrenology. It is a matter of notorious fact that the
heads of criminals exhibit in general a peculiar conformation, being
dwarfed in front and at top, and enlarged below and behind. It is
obviously a question of some scientific importance whether or no this
coincidence between type of head and character implies connection.
Such may not be the case. Phrenology may be not even so much as
rtially true, but all stuff and nonsense. But whether it is all
lumbug or not is a question only to be determined by such pro-
ceedings as taking casts of the heads of malefactors and others—by
such a proceeding as that which MR. GIBSON is represented, no
doubt erroneously, as declaring to be unnecessary for any purpose o
science. Such a declaration would become a shuffling bishop, desirous
of , stifling, theological investigation, but is quite unworthy, of any
enlightened surgeon, the minister and interpreter of Nature and truth.
GREATEST LITERARY NEWS EVER HEARD.
“Lord Auckland, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, is preparing for the public a
selection from the EDEN papers.”
This news is so astounding that Mr. Punch has no remark to make
on it. There is said to be in the possession of an ancient German
family a picture illustrating the great importançc of that family in ver
carly times. NoAH comes out of the Ark with the only article worth
his personal attention, a box lettered “Papers of the House of Hol-
LE, BURG.” But the Eden, papers beat everything. Mr. Punch has
nothing to say, except that the Biº is a lucky Editor. Will he give
ADAM’s autograph?

money that he had lost through a friend, when the com-

answered in the affirmative, the philosophic advice was,
“Then, be content, my dear fellow; you can't expect to
have both your money and your friend.”
MR. PUNCH ON SOME POPULAR DELUSIONS.
TOUCHING TRAVELLERS BRITISH AND FOREIGN.
MR. PUNCH asserted last week, and is prepared most honestly
and earnestly to maintain, that English º of both sexes are, as
a class, the best dressed travellers to be met with;, but he anticipates
more cavil and question of his second thesis, that the English are, as a
rule, the best mannered travellers, and treaters of travellers, at least
in comparison with our nearest Continental neighbours, French, Bel;
gians, and Germans. Italians and Orientals are both, inherently and
instinctively, polite.
Such is the conviction which has forced itself upon Mr. Punch in
the course of a cosmopolitan experience. There are two things which,
on his landing from the Channel steamer, he invariably hails at Dover
with intense thankfulness and satisfaction; the first draught of malt
from the pewter, and the first quarter of an houl of an English railway.
People may complain, and with reason, of the recklessness of our
railway management. No doubt we do start trains too quickly on
each other's heels; no. doubt, the pace is occasionally too fast for
signalling or signal reading, and the horrors of a smash, when it does
come, are terrific; but Mr. Punch, all things weighed, would
rather risk a smash on an English line, than crawl in sorrowful,
or savage safety on a Belgian, German, or French one; and this, not
for the advantage in |. only, or mainly, but because of the ineffable
superiority of our English railway system in every point that affects the
traveller's comfort. And first and foremost (which brings us to the
}.} of this, Essay), because of the comparative good breeding of
". travellers and railway officials of all classes.
. You are fresh from the chaſe, say, of one of those wearisome wander-
ings to, and fro in a network of Belgian lines, in which you have been
hustled from carriage to carriage on a damp morning (perhaps after a
night of railway travelling) once every half hour, on an average, between
Mechlin and Lille, with perpetually recurring halts of ten minutes, but
no stoppage long enough for a meal; or you are still bleeding under
the écorchement inflicted upon you in one of those unconscionable
buffets (I need not name names) between Paris and Calais or Bou-
logne, where you have been made to pay a franc for a pear, or a franc
and a half for a roll and a basin of warm water with a greasy scum on the
surface, called a bouillon.
But, in the best of cases, even if your journey has been unharassed
by shifting of carriages, broken by rationally-arranged halts for food,
unaggravated by any peculiarly impudent demand upon your purse, you
come ashore, labouring under a lively sense of the social and personal
inferiority which it seems the object of Continental railway manage-
ment to impress upon you...You have been “chivied,” first of all, through
the bureau for the registering of your baggage. This may be the less
infliction to a large class of Continental travellers, as they can exist for
long periods on an infinitesimal allowance of shirts, socks, and under:
arments generally. Mr. Punch once knew a German, professor of
i. reputation, who made a three months' round of English
country-houses with a little bag, not larger than a lady's railway reticule,
pour tout bagage, and there was no j. record of his having run up a
washing bill the whole time. But PATERFAMILIAS can't carry MRS. P.
and his two daughters about the world on a carpet-bag. The family have
a prejudice in favour of clean linen and plenty of it; and the ladies, for all

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then, after you have escaped from the baggage-bureau, run the
gauntlet of a crowd of craving porters, one to a package (and note
that the railway porter, the man paid as well as H.f and clothed
by the company, seems unknown on the Continent, where no man will
carry anything beyond the nearest point at which he can put his burden
down, for somebody else to take up, and so º comes the penning up
in the waiting-rooms, under the surveillance of more, haughty men in
uniform, who guard the doors, and scowl on you, and insist on seeing
your tickets every time, you pass in or out, and then, when the doors
are opened, comes another rush, in which devil take the hindmost is as
much the rule as it was in the #ureau des bagages.
Here again contrast the two systems—the Continental, one of
waiting-room pens, in which passengers are “ponded-up,” as the
sanitary engineers say, for a longer or shorter period (for you must be
at the station ten minutes before the train's starting, or five minutes, or
such other period as the high and mighty administration may think
proper to impose on you) to be flushed on to the platform, through a
single doorway, º sort of turncock in a uniform and glazed cap; and
ours, where you drive down to the station at your own time—so you can
but catch the train—take your ticket, pass on to the platform, choose
your seat, deposit your wraps, see your º lº into yan or
carriage, according as it is buſky or compressed, and all in two minutes,
without once feeling the pressure of the administration, or being
reminded of the iron hand by the presence of a uniform.
I say, again and again, that the one system shows an utter absence
of that *: for the traveller which is the very basis of the other;
in which all is calculated on the theory that the traveller is a self.
respecting, intelligent, responsible º: Abroad, you are treated as
much as possible like a parcel; in England you feel you are a human
being—a passenger with eyes, hands, and a head of your own. -
'i this is not digressive. It belongs directly to our very subject,
the relative good-breeding of our travellers abroad and at home. For,
humanity is polite in proportion as it is politely dealt with. If it be
true, as the laureate sings, that—
“Gently comes the world to those
That are cast in gentle mould,”
it is cqually true, that those only give back gentleness who are
ently handled by the powers and people about them. It is impossible
or a French or German traveller, who is habitually made to feel that
he is as dirt under the ſeet of the uniformed Jack in Office, who orders
him in and out of the Bureau des bagages and the waiting-room—orders
him into the carriage—into his place in the carriage-orders him out of
it-orders him in fact from beginning to end of his journey—it is im-
possible, I say, for this oppressed and uniform-ridden foreigner, not to
ine of on you or me some of the insolence which has been showered
on him. hen Captain Absolute kicks Fag down-stairs, Fag revenges
himself by kicking the scullery-boy.
There may be, other reasons, but Mr. Punch knows none in his belief
so operative as this, to account for the fact (for fact it is) that your
average railway traveller, on a French, Belgian or German line is apt
to be selfish and sulky, always ready to steal a march upon men and to
be impertinent to women; that his voice is loud and harsh, his bearing
provocative and outrecuidant, his way, of getting in and out of th:
carriage rude, his rush to a buffet-table, his way of digging into the
yiands set out, and his general comportment and behaviour at # meals,
loggish: and for the fact, which is equally beyond dispute, that the
bearing of most English travellers is the most perſect contrast to this;
that self-respect makes them as a rule deſerential, soft of voice.
chivalrous to women, ready to concede to men, and if sometimes stiff
and silent, never brusque, braggart, brutal, or bullying.
Nothing need be said of the contrast between the officials with whom
the traveller comes most into contact abroad and at home, because this
must be patent to every person who has ever travelled by a Continental
and an English line.
It goes so far, that when Mr. Punch lands at Dover he feels as if he
had passed from a region of coercion, self-assertion and rudeness, to a
realm of independence, self-restraint, and good breeding. It is a positive
pleasure to him to ask a question of a railway guard, or a service of a
railway porter. . He knows he will get a civil answer, in a soft voice,
or the ready. help of a strong and willing arm., People may say that
the expectation of a “tip” lies at the bottom of both. Mr. Punch can
only say he finds the foreigner, in and out of uniform, quite as ready for
the tip,” but that it does not produce in his case the equivalent in
civility or service. And with this avowal of his faith, he pulls up for
the present.
A Joke Shrouded in Mystery.
SoME one was mentioning in the Smoking-room of the City Club, that
GLApsTone was so fagged that he was going over to France for a few
nys’ relaxation. “Then, I suppose,” said SIR. H. Muggertipg|E, “hc’ll
go to St. Homer?” Now, whether this accident was purcly innocent,
or Pººl; intended, none but the Honourable Member {ij} can
telſ. Let us, however, give SIR HENRY the benefit of the doubt. It
is more generous to suppose that he never intended it as a joke.

HORRID MURDER OF MOZART.
AMONG sundry new musical works
lately announced, there is
one which bears the title
following:—
“Il mio Tesoro. Cavatino do
l'opera de MozARt. Transcrite et
... pour le piano. Par Polydon
e Vos.”
We have not had the mis-
fortune to hear this trans-
cription and variation of Mo-
ZART; but suppose that it
corresponds pretty nearly to
CIBBER's improvements and
augmentations of SHAKs-
PEARE. We are told by a
musical critic, in a notice
of this composition, or rather
decomposition, that M. pe
# Vos has been guilty of “giv-
ing a totally different reading
of the accompaniment” to
the beautiful air which, he
has had the audacity togarble,
and that he has dared “to
lead off his transcription with
the opening bar of La ci
darem,” yuttered in the
bass, whilst “the phrase of this solitary bar is alternated with arpezzi
by way of introduction to “Il mio Tesoro, the air of which is frittered
away in unmeaning and unoriginal embellishments.” What sort of
is this M. DE Wos ? Not a nice one, if that is all true which
the greatest man that ever lived, except ourselves, has declared of
him that hath no music in his soul. For such a fellow has no music
in his soul. His music, such as he has, lies in his mere acoustic faculty
of perception, and not in his soul at all; and it isyery doubtful whether
a creature capable of adulterating and diluting MozART, being a brute,
has any soul whatever.
A musician of genius will take a common tune, and Wºº, the con-
ceptions of that genius about it. A DE Wos seizes upon the thought of
a great composer, distorts it, disfigures it, and disguises it with his own
unmeaning quavers and senseless crotchets. O, MozART! Q, BEET-

THE FORTUNE OF DRILL.
Fools are not to be trusted with firearms. The statement of this
truism is justified by the fact, recorded in the Times, that, at a Volun-
teer drill which, took place on Tuesday last week in Wolverhampton,
the 4th Staffordshire łºń. being inspected by MAJOR DICE, the
Government Inspector for the district, under the eye of LoRD
HATHERTON, Lord-Lieutenant of the county, as the men were en
in file-firing, PRIVATE BAGALLY, of the Tettenhall Company, was shot
in the right hand. The wound is supposed to have been occasioned º
one of those unfortunate persons to whom the truism above quote
applics, and who was his rear-rank man. MR. BAGALLY was obliged
to have his fourth finger amputated, and to lose a portion of the back
of the hand, poor fellow ! It is feared that his third finger will also be
lost through the clumsiness or carelessness of his rear-rank man, who is
not to be trusted with firearms. -
Accidents will occur in the best regulated corps; but in any corps
that is at all well regulated, they occur but seldom. But at the last
drill of the gallant 4th Staffordshire Battalion, as the Times further
relates, a man's eye was shot out by a blank cartridge. This Battalion,
therefore, wants regulating—to wit, by the elimination of those mem-
bers thereof who are accustomed to shoot their comrades' hands of
and. out, and the formation of these * muffs into an awkward
squad, to be drilled with mopsticks instead of rifles, in their fists, till
further notice. Volunteers are of course prepared to expose their
breasts to an enemy expert in the use of firearms, but not to lose their
hands and eyes § the shot of comrades to whom such weapons ought
not to be confided.

PUNCH ON THE PYRAMID,
Egypt is getting into pecuniary difficulties, and the extraordinary
rise of the Nile has only plunged her into more hot water; France
who holds that the Emperor that would refuse to stretch forth his hand
to assist a virtuous nation in distress, is unworthy the name of Annex-
andcrthe Great, is stated to be about to proffer succour to the Pacha.
Louis NApoleoN speaks handsomely; and, indeed, as the, humbler
classes phrase it, no one can speak Pharaoh to § t. Still, let Egypt
look out—she may have to pay for his friendship. France does not
want a river for a frontier, there can be no doubt of that, because she
has expressly told Prussia as much. The Egyptians may safely sing,
“They shall not have the Nile;” and if they have not got music to the
words, we happen to know that the executors of an old band-master
who served in a certain little affair in 1798, can furnish the Pacha, with
an appropriate melody. But suppose it should occur to the Tuileries
that, in order to complete the symmetry of France, she wants the

GERMAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE,
WE, have every reason to believe that the German authorities are
fully alive to the exigencies of the present crisis, and to the necessity
of at once furnishing to Germany a fleet adequate to her wants. For
several days past it has been observed that unusual activity has pre-
vailed in the two celebrated ºl. in Holborn and Fleet Street, and
several foreigners of remarkable appearance have been seen looking in
at the, windows of those establishments. The º of course,
deny that any extraordinary operations are going on, but this diplomatic
reserve can deceive no one who is acquainted with the tortuous policy
practised, and required by the German mind. It can hardly ł. for
nothing that no fewer than five mortars, each capable of carrying a
swan shot, and valued at 3s. 6d, have disappeared from MR. HAMLYN's
stores, and when we couple this with the declaration at Hamburg that
gun-boats are a German necessity, we leave the deduction to EARL
RºssELI, and the British nation. It will not be borne that after the
noble effort of a heavily taxed people like ours to prepare a fleet for our
protection, the sinister ambition of Germany shall be allowed to cover
the sea with ships that may menace the independence of Europe. We
do not accuse our Minister of being blind to circumstances, indeed we
have reason to know that a young representative of the house of
Russell has had a recent interview with one, if not both of the eminent
toy-makers in question, and it is rumoured that there was taken away
in the carriage ºff which might, without offending German or
alarming English susceptibility, allow the Foreign Minister to form his
own judgment of the naval strength of Germany. All we say is, that
vigilance is especially demanded where hostile preparations assume a
scale of studied infinitesimality.

ISCREA
THE PERFECT CURE.
AS PERFORMED AT MR. SP–RG–ON's NEW CANTERBURY HALL.
THE RIWAIS IN THE ROPE-WALK.
THE adjective tender is generally regarded as inapplicable, to the
person and profession of the Finisher of the Law, but tender the noun
substantive, in the subjoined extract from a Glasgow newspaper, ap:
pears in connection with two gentlemen of that unpopular if useful
calling:—
“THE CoNDEMNED Convict FrazeR.—No word has yet come from the Home
SECRETARY as to the fate of FRAzER, the man who was convicted at the last Circuit
Court of the murder of M"KENNEy, by stabbing. In the meantime, the authorities,
we believe, have had two applications from persons anxious to carry into effect the
sentence passed on him—WM. CALCRAFT, of London, and Thomas AskERN, Maltby,
Yorkshire. The former states that he will perform the duty at his usual fee of
twenty guineas, exclusive of travell and other expenses, including first-class
railway fare; while AskERN offers to do it at about half the sum, and third-class
railway fare. AskERN, besides the recommendation of cheapness, seems to be a
better educated man than CALCRAFT, and sends several respectable references.”
The writer of the foregoing paragraph describes CALCRAFT and
AsKERN as “anxious” to carry out the sentence passed on FRAZER.
What was the nature of their anxiety to hang that man? Do they
practise their profession con amore, and rejoice in executing malefactors?
are they accustomed to finish the law as it were with a will? Or is the
object of their anxiety merely the pecuniary consideration to be earned
by putting a man to death?—are they anxious for a job simply as a
pig-butcher is, with a sole view to the fee? The fee of a hangman is a
sum which may be regarded with reasonable anxiety. It exceeds that
of a physician; is twenty times as great by the tariff of CALCRAFT, the
regular practitioner. The conduct of AskERN in trying to undersell
the old JACK.KETCH by offering to take half his hire, and to accept
third class railway fare, will no doubt be stigmatised, by hangmen in
general, as ..º. and undignified. By the ºff. however,
the recommendation of cheapness on the part of an executioner will be
regarded as a very great one; for the principal argument in favour of
capital punishment is that it is the cheapest way of disposing of a fellow
who is good for nothing.
In #. consists the alleged superiority of AsKERN over CALCRAFT
in education ? JACK KETCH may be unable to read a line, but capable
of putting one about a throat very ..". for all that "What was the
nature f MR. AskERN's respectable references? Perhaps they were
testimonials of his moral and religious character, and civil and attentive
deportment, obtained from clergymen and others, and certificates of
his professional skill, from medical men. A decent well-behaved and
adroit hangman, having the recommendation of cheapness, is certainly
preferable to a brutal and clumsy one, even for the county rate-payers.
As the office of JACK KETCH is, at the lowest rate, one of consider-
able emolument, and education is now put forward as a qualification
for it, perhaps it will soon be rendered !. prize of competitive exam-
ination as a department of the Civil Service.
Readers who may sympathise with the “ anxiety” of MEssRs. CAL-
CRAFT and AsKERN to throttle FRAZER, will perhaps be sorry to learn
that those artists were cruelly disappointed by the fact that the convict
whom they desired for a victim, was provokingly reprieved.

And to smuggle me all efforts are in vain:
While the sages of the South hope by Europe's cotton drouth
Intervention in their favour they may gain.
Burden. Oh, lay down the rifle, &c.
To North then and to South I appeal by Punch his mouth,
To cease fighting and to set King Cotton free;
Blood and treasure both may waste that can never be replaced,
But they’ll ne'er be brought together, save by me.

"THIS IS No MINE AIN HOUSE.”
. THE French Swells have hit upon an invention in the carte de visite
line, intended to prevent imitation by the masses. The lucky possessor
or lessee of a country seat, has a view of it photographed on his cards,
and uses no inscription whatever. The portrait system has become
low, for everybody has a face, or what by a stretch of courtesy may be
called one. But few people, comparatively, have country seats. So
here is an invention for the exclusives. We shall probably see it
adopted in England. EATON HALL will call upon CASTLE. HowARD,
and Holla No House leaves a card with PEMBROKE LoDGE. The plan,
however, will necessitate the binding up a |. series of Country
Houses with, one’s “Where Is It?” for it will be awkward to make
mistakes, and fancy that the photograph on your hall-table is BROAD-
LANDs, when it is #º MANor, or rice versá, when you are in
hopes of being invited to the counsels of your Sovereign by the party
leader, and equally awkward to go flourishing about a picture of what
used to be called DENMAN PRIORY, and showing it to your friends as
proof of a visit from KNowsLEY or CHATsworth. There will be no
mistakes about Mr. Punch's cards; first, because he never leaves any;
and secondly, because the immortal window in Fleet Street is as well
known as the front of the house at Stratford-upon-Avon; but he recom:
mends to his Swell friends, if they intend to adopt the lan, a course of
careful study of what MR. DIsrAELI in Popanilla cleverly calls the
sciences of Architecture and Parkitecture.
“O No, we Never Mention it.”
HAVING, probably, mislaid his almanack, and seeing nºthing around
him to indicate that he was in a Christian country, the Times’ Special
Correspondent in America inadvertently went out shooting on a
Sunday. He was instantly pounced upon and fined. Had he remem-
bered the day, the indiscretion would have been almost Quixotically
gallant, for anything connected with guns on a Sunday must be so very
sore a subject in the North—since Bull's Run.

“MAY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION,” ETC.
r
SAITH, the Opinion Nationale, upon the comparative facilities
afforded by Paris and London to the masses of their population, when
the latter desire recreation in the fresh air:-
“In our new and delicious gardens at Paris the delighted child of some poor
person plays and gives itself up to the transports of joy natural to infancy when
placed in such a surrounding, while, seated in the midst of verdant foliage and of
flowers, the mother mends the clothes of the family. What would you Parisians
say were these little elysiums closed to all but a couple of dozen children of the
quarter, and their noble and wealthy parents : Think, then, of the immense and
numerous squares of London that are rigorously shut against the working classes,
and that the rich or aristocratic alone have access to them, for they are cultivated
exclusively for them.
When these gardens are kept for the happy and privileged
few there is much loss of health, morality, and recreation to the people. e square
of Lincoln's Inn Fields, six times larger than your Square du Temple, is fresh,
blooming, and deserted. The rich, however, disdain it; and the poor can only look
into it. Some benevolent *..." demanded of the parochial authorities that this
unfrequented square should be thrown open to the public, but obtained only a
peremptory refusal. A people thus treated is not free. No, a thousand times |
although from time to time they throw potato ls at the heads of lords who
displease them, although the Radical press says what it pleases of the aristocracy
and caricatures of them are engraved.”—Opinion Nationale.
Now, in the spirit of these remarks, so far as they advocate the
}.} as many gardens as possible to the people of London, Mr.
unch cordially concurs. But when the Opinion comes to details, its
opinion is like a good many other's opinions, namely, based on igno-
rance. There is nothing in Paris to equal, either in beauty or extent,
the series of parks which are open to our people, and any one who
should compare, even the Bois, de Boulogne º whose grass no
“delighted child” can walk without a stern order from some sentinel
tº take its little feet and “transports” off the sacred sward) with the
glorious glades of Kensington, would simply talk folly. And as to the
mother mending the trousers of the family in the gardens of the
Parisian people, Mr. Punch would be sorry to destroy so pretty a
picture; but trousers and the necessary appliances mean a bundle, and
it is not many days since Mr. Punch, in the Rue de Rivoli, beheld a
decent mechanic, with a bundle which he might have been going to
take to the mother of his family, enter the garden at one of the gates
in the street aforesaid. At that mechanic instantly darted a furious
sentinel, with the spring of a tiger, and actually lowered his bayonet, as if
to enforce the angry order with which he sent the man flying back
into the street. The allusion to the Square du Temple is lucky
because it reminds, Mr. Punch tha; during the pleasant afternoons of
the year, the gardens, of his Temple, though private property, are
thrown open to the children of the metropolis. The squares generally
are simply the private gardens of the houses around, which houses
have no other gardens attached to them, and therefore the compen-
sation is given in the area, and it would be as reasonable to ask any
dweller in a smug villa to throw his garden gate open, as to claim the
squares for others than the house-owners. But º all submission to
our French critic (and if this is the EMPEROR, who is praising his own
improvements, which are too grand to need praising, he knows that he
is writing bosh) London has i. e and noble provision for the recrea-
tion of her masses, and we will back the Five Parks of our people
against anything Paris can show in that way. In most show-things
she beats us hollow; but we not only do not know that we are beatenin
parks, but know that we are not. As to the potato-peelings which we
fling at the heads of Lords, that is an affair of our own; perhaps the
Lords like it, at all events they never mention it. The freedom of the
press is a sore subject with a Parisian, and it would be ungenerous to
answer this charge. But we must assert and asseverate that, all things
considered, and in contradiction to the Opinion, we are Free, and that
Magna Charta is not repealed even by the denial of permission to the
|: to walk among dead cats and sallow lawyers in Lincoln's Inn
"ields. The only park in which the Master, of the French surpasses
us is a Park of Artillery, and that is a park which we don’t want to see
opened for the people—or on them.

so far as to say, all) the Scotch speak better English than the con-
ceited English themselves do. For instance, they pronounce widow
—“ weedow; ” and it is clear, on the very face of it, that “weedow,”
with a delicate emphasis on the “weed,” must be correct.
THE PERFECTION of NEEDIEwork—It is quite a prize pattern, if
a lady can “hem” a refusal without there being a single cross-stitch
in it.

THERE ARE some PEOPLE who would THINK THIS MODE OF
wi:ARING THE HAIB RATHER TOUSLED AND INToxicate D,
BUT IT IS REALLY FRENCHY AND coqueTTISH.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“I BELIEVE there are existing a clairvoyant class of critics
who can describe a performance without having attended it. Were I
gifted with this faculty I should fill my present letter with an account
of MR.FEghTER’s acting as Othello, detailing most minutely the chief
Fº in his conception, and carefully narrating how he worked it out.
ut as I have not yet seen him in the part, and have not the gift of
critical clairvoyance, I must postpone for the present an account of his
º and content myself with thinking that, from all that I can
hear, there is very little need of my hurrying to witness it. ... Whether
it will have as long a run as Hamlet, while the public are so fickle, it is
not easy to }. but so great was MR. FECHTER’s success in his
first effort, that curiosity alone will cram the theatre till Christmas, and
doubtless admiration will º after fill the house.
“Folks who say the taste for SHAKsp EARE has died out have abun-
dant proof just now of the truth of that assertion. Before these words
are public four theatres in town will be devoted to his works. MR. G.
W. BROOKE has journeyed all the way from the Antipodes expressly to
play SHAKSPEARE for a while at Drury Lane; MR. Booth is acting
Shylock and King Richard at the Haymarket; MR. FECHTER with
Othello is cramming the Princess's; and last, and not the least in my
poor estimation, . PHELPs at Sadler's Wells has appeared again as
Bottom, and they who have not seen him are advised hereby to go. On
the whole I like it best of his Shakspearian conceptions, and rank it far
above all other ºf of the character that I have ever seen. The
mingled 'cuteness and obtuseness of this very prince of clowns, his dense
dull-brained stupidity and important self-conceit, are admirably shown
by \!. PHELPs's rendering: while the languor that pervades him in
his love-scenes with Titania fitly carry out the notion of his being in a
dream. I think his exit on awaking, when his ass's head has been
removed, is one of the best bits of comic by-play ever acted. He goes
off thoughtfully and slowly, feeling in the air for his long ears and nose,
which he cannot comprehend quite how he can have lost. With his
dull dazed sense of something unusual having happened, he needs some
evidence to help him to reflect upon the matter; and having in his
memory a dim glimmer of the past, he is puzzled that no tangible
remains of it are left to him. -
“I looked in at the Princess's a night or two, and found a fullish
audience enjºying the new comedy, and laughing in a way that must

ness is used to win a laugh, and of this at the Princess's there is not
the slightest trace. Of the acting MR. BRough AM has by far the
greatest share; the other parts are fairly filled and demand no special
comment, except that MR. JoBDAN (from the New York Stage) is too
º and tragic, to my thinking, for the piece. One don’t care to

what’s called the ‘heavy business’ should keep their ponderosity from
being a dead weight.

I don’t ask for probability, so long as there be fun; but in this piece, as

“ONE WHO PAYS.”
PLAYING AT CARDS.
WE are told by Le Sport, which is a kind of French Bell’s Life,
ininus, of course, the prize-fights, that a new sort of visiting-card, has
just been introduced by a sporting celebrity. Its distinguishing
feature is the total absence of name and address—such information
being considered vulgar, or out of place, on a visiting-card. However,
these unnecessary details are replaced by a photograph of the owner's
rural residence.
Thus, a gentleman in France is known not by his
standing in society, but by the seat he possesses in the country. This
affectation may be very convenient for gentlemen who possess country
seats, but we know several poor French noblemen, who are compelled
by their impoverished incomes to live au troisième, and, even, au
quatrième. hat plan are these lofty illustrations of la haute noblesse
to adopt? Are they to give a photograph of the storey of the house in
which they lodge? Or Wºlf a portrait of some ancestral old arm-
chair, in which the nobleman's father and forefathers sat, be accepted
as a competent substitute for a seat It is difficult to say what in
these cases—card-cases—would be looked upon as “the correct card.”
Moreover, we strongly question the good taste of this new form of
asteboard politeness. e must say we should not care much about
hi. upon visiting terms with a nobleman, who, at every visit,
studiously made it a point of showing us the outside of his door.
Then again, the fashion is not so very, new; for we have known
sporting celebrities in this country even, who have found it º
convenient at times to conceal both their name and address. In suc
instances, however, the view of the rural abode has º been
withheld from prudence, or, it may be, an excusable pride,-otherwise
it might not improbably have revealed a striking resemblance to a large
º: known on the other side of the water as the Queen's
Bench, the hospitality of which is such that visitors, who have gone
there merely for a visit of a few days, have often been found, eyen
against their own will, to stop much lºgº than ever they intended.

PAPAL PEEPSHOWS.
Hº yearly exodus of
Englishmen is very
nearly over, but there
are doubtless, still
some few who have
not had their holiday,
and who may feel the
usual glorious uncer-
tainty as to where to
#. If *. have any
ondness for seeing
curiosities, perhaps
the following will
tempt them to
and pay a visit to the
Church of . Notre
Dame in Aix-la-Cha-
pelle:—
“The great relics,
which are only shown
every seven years are
the robe of the virgin;
the swaddling clothes of
our Saviour; the linen,
still marked with blood,
in which John the Bap-
tist, after being behead-
ed, was wrapped up ; and
the sheet which was
used at the descent from
the cross. The small
relics are shown every day in the year to strangers who may apply for that pur-
pose. Among these objects are the leathern girdle worn by our Saviour, the two
ends of which are joined together, and sealed with the seal of Constantine; a piece
of the true cross; a part of the sacred winding-sheet; the linen waistbelt of the
Holy Virgin; some of her hair; a link of the chain of St. Peter; the right arm and
thread of CHARLEMAGNE ; the bones of several saints; the marble throne on which
CHARLEMAGNE was seated in his tomb, and which was used at the coronation of the
Emperors.”
We think these interesting relics might easily be made immensely
more attractive, if the favoured priests who have the privilege of
showing them would adopt the style of language of proprietors of
peepshows, and magnify with most ingenious mendacity the marvels of
the objects they would bring to public view. With a very little
stretching of our elastic, fancy, we can imagine a fat priest, puffin
sadly, from, short wind, luring on a lot of sight-seers by some suc
speech as this:- --- - 1 -
“Hoy! hoy! look here!, look here! be in time! (gasp) be in time!
Here you’ll see the sacred shoes of Saint. Barefootus, in which he
made his famous pilgrimage to Jericho, walking all the way from Rome
by way of the North, Pole (gasp), where, as an act of penance, he
stood upon the ice until his toes were frostbitten and his beard became
snow-white. You perceive the shoes have scarce a scratch upon their
soles (pant), and really may be said to be almost as good as new.
Some heretics have said (guos *. debemus) that in verity the
good saint never wore them in his life, and indeed that they were made
expressly for this peepshow four centuries and fifty years after his
decease. But the truth is, Saint Barefootus, being of a highly eco-
nomic disposition, used, when he went a pilgrimage, to put shoes
into his pocket, and only wore them on his feet to keep the rats from
nibbling them when he retired to rest ( ſº The next relic I shall
show you is the tooth of Saint Ticdouloureux, who fell a martyr (to
neuralgia) A.R. 1466. Qbserve the length of fang, and the magnitude
of cavity, and think what fearful pangs the holy martyr must have
suffered, when he underwent the torture of having his tooth out.
Another .# relic is the sacred woollen comforter which
Saint Quinsius made use of when he had a bad sore throat (pant).
The genuineness of the article is evidenced by its condition, for it has
not been washed since the decease of its good wearer, and . one who
puts it with due reverence to his nose will perceive abundant proof
that Saint Quinsius departed in the true odour of sanctity. Look a
little lower down and rather to your right, and you will see the gig
umbrella of the hermit Saint iggus. This holy man resided in a
hole upon Mont Blanc, and subsisted for a century upon seaweed and
raw, shrimps (gasp). The º of this fact, which is abundantly
well proved by the diary he kept (I shall show you the blank fly-leaf
and a fragment of the cover to corroborate my words), has caused a
great sensation to the savants of geology; and many heretics deny,
with impious audacity, that either shrimps or seaweed have ever been
discoverable at so great a height above the level of the sea (pant). On
the left of this you see the holy cat-o'-nine-tails which was used by
Saint Flagellant in, his private acts of penance. Albeit, it was nearly
ninety *: in daily use, you will observe the sainted instrument is
none the worse, for wear; whereas the knout that, hangs beside it
which was kept by the good saint for the benefit of Fº is reduce
by constant exercise well nigh to a stump. From this difference of
condition certain heretics have argued that the saint whipped those
who went to him harder than himself; but shallow rersoning like this
it is quite needless to refute, and so we will pass on to the next inter-
esting relic (gasp). This is a small fragment of the cover to the
waterbutt wherein the º Saint Keyholius for six weeks lay concealed,
when pursued by the benighted heretics of England for committingsundry
acts of saintly eavesdropping. According to the chronicles, he
was fed in his retirement by a mouse that used to creep in through the
bunghole of the waterbutt, and bring him every morning a sfice of
beefsteak pudding and half a pint of beer. Not having any exercise,
the holy saint so fattened on this nutritious diet, that when the mouse
informed him his pursuers were all gone, he had to burst the waterbutt
before he could get out.” (Gurgle, gasp, and grunt, and here, the
showman being breathless, another takes his place).
A FREE AND EASY FRÄULEIN.
. The . correspondent of the Times, relates an interesting
circumstance which diversified the royal tomfoolery just enacted there.
A lot of young ladies dressed in white (like the bridemaids in Der
Freischütz) had to receive the King and Queen at the Brandenburg
Gate on the Monday previous to the coromation day. Two of them
were to make short, speeches of welcome to the King and Queen
respectively; two others to present their Majesties with copies of
verses, composed for the occasion. We might imagine that these
appropriately-attired damsels danced up to the Royal pair, waving
garlands and singing, “See, see, we bring fresh flowers of Autumn,
to wit, dahlias, chrysanthemums, and China-asters, but on the contrary
these girls appear to have acted the silly part which was assigned to
them with real grace, and natural dignity; and no nonsense. We are
informed that:—
“The damsel who addressed the Queen is the daughter of one of the b
masters.
nerves) with much grace, and the Queen, when she concluded, held out her hand.
Instead of kissing it, the fair Königsbe gave it a hearty shake. Her Majesty is
She is reported to have executed her task (rather trying to provincial
said to have been much amused, and to have made the remark, that the good people
of Königsberg seemed to be quite on a familiar footing with Royalty.”
We hope that the report which ascribes so extremely vulgar a remark
to the QueFN of PRussia, is unfounded. The observation which her
Prussian Majesty is accused of making is just such a one as a foolish
woman of low origin, whom a still more foolish king had stupidly
married, would naturally have made. A burgomaster's º: of
ordinary breeding would have been a queen to a queen capable of so
snobbish a saying. “Quite on a familiar footing with Royalty!”. The
exclamation is just that which would proceed from the lips of an Abigail
or a scullion elevated to a throne. ... “Quite on a familiar footing with
Royalty—Ahem l’” It is obvious that “Ahem!” must necessarily have
been added to the speech above alleged to have been uttered by the
QUEEN or PRUssIA, but which probably proceeded from the mouth
of one of her least ladylike servants. - -
No doubt the º of PRussia was only too happy in feeling the
heartiness with which her hand was shaken by the burgomaster's brave
daughter, and was not at all amazed, but very much gratified, to find
Royalty, with the good people of Königsberg, on so popular a footing
as that indicated by a hearty shake of the hand. ..
If we were assured that her Majesty really did say that “the good
eople of Königsberg seemed to be quite on a familiar footing with
yalty,” we should take refuge in ſº supposition that she said so
in joke, since by laying a due emphasis on König in Königsberg,
d the same on Royalty, she might have made a sort of a pun.
The Rale Repale of the Union.
ONE of the favourite election cries with the present President's par-
tisans was to call him, with true democratic familiarity, “a rail split-
ter.” . His admirers, especially those amongst the enlightened Hiber-
nian class, may carry the familiarity still further now, if they like, for
they have a precedent for it, and confer on him the proud title of “The
rale splitter of the Union.”

ABSURD Association OF IDEAS.
For several days past, there has been in the Times the
following advertisement:-
WILL MISSING : ONE THOUSAND POUNDS, &c.
The association of ideas is sometimes very absurd. We
know it is wrong, and highly ridiculous-so much so, that
the people in the house must think we are mad—but each
time we see the above advertisement, we cannot possibl
refrain from launching vociferously into the song of “
Willie, we have missed you.” We do wish some one would
make haste, and find both the Will and the way of claiming
those Thousand Pounds.
AN “AREA’’ PENsáE.—“I wonder what Cookey has
got for supper?”—A Policeman, who is the victim of a
decouring passion.
A BUNCH OF FRESH-GATHERED ADWERTISEMENTS.
We select the following out of a recent number of the Daily Tele-
graph as a very fair sample of one day’s reading of advertisements:—
WANTEP, the USE of a DEVIL, with rather fine teeth and rapid
revolution.—Address, A.B., &c.
Is the above an advertisement from the corps known as the “Devil's
Own ... As he is expected to go through “rapid revolutions,” it would
look like it. We are puzzled to know what the “rather fine teeth.”
are wanted for, unless it is to bite the cartridges. For ourselves, we
would rather not be the dentist who was called in to examine the teeth
of a “Devil.” We might tremble, lest it should be our last bite in
this world.
Amongst the current wants of the day, here is another one still more
Curious :-
WANTEP, in a large town, thirty miles from London, a good
t , cuckºº, accustomed to a first-class bespoke trade, and a good fitter. Apply
at, &c.
What is “a good Clicker?”. Is it a Town Clock? or, since it is
required to be a good fitter,” is it a Tailor. that is expected to give
“tick?” Really, there should be a key published with i. advertise-
ments. Also, in the name of Fortune, and its wheel, what can “a
good bespoke trade” mean?
Here is one, however, that is a little more intelligible:—
EHA COLE WANTS A HOUSEMAID'S PLACE. I prefer public
to private. Address for Eliza Cole, &c.
The bad grammar of the above makes the meaning beautifully simple,
though the preference, expressed by ELIZA, is decidedly not to be
admired. e prominence, too, that ELIZA Cole gives to her name is
amusing, just as if she were a celebrated character of great notoriety,
like those world-known acrobats, and orb-admired Athletes, who
advertise every week for fresh engagements.
Talking of acrobats, here is a gentleman who has seemingly great
powers ol expansion:—
O WHOLESALE GROCERS and Others.-A Commercial Traveller,
covering the South and West of England every three months, can TAKE a
COMMISSION. Address, &c.
This Commercial Traveller does not inform us how he professes to
“cover” extensive parts of England. He must be a great flat, on a
scale much larger than," flats” generally run, if he can do it, or if he
expects us either to believe that he can do it. If, Beds is one of the
Counties, we suppose his means of covering it would be with a counter-
pane? We .# like HERRING, or GRANT, or some sporting artist,
to draw us a picture of a Commercial Traveller “going to cover.”
Here is the last. The advertiser this time is not an india-rubber
contortionist, but apparently an equestrian:-
Gºº, Single Handed; ride or drive a BROUGHAM. Single; age
26 years. Good character.
You see he professes to “ride” a Brougham. We thought it was
witches alone who claimed this aérial monopoly. Not less than a hun:
dred years ago this “single-handed” Groom would have been carrie
to the stake for making boldly this profane confession that he could
“ride a Brougham,” and offering himself thus publicly for any one to
hire him. With his powers of witchcraft, he might have presumed to
answer the advertisement of the gentleman above, who is in such painful
want of a “Devil.” - --

In your wonderful vindication of the much injured Duke of

ENCOURAGE NATIVE TALENT.
WHEN Courvoisier was hanged for murdering LoRD WILLIAM RUs:
sELL, the execution of the assassin was celebrated in an affecting copy of |
verses, which wound up with an appeal to the nobility, recommending
them to bestow their patronage º, on native valetry, and—
“No longer foreigners employ,
Which your own country might enjoy."
A similar exhortation might be addressed to young ladies, who are
prone, as in the terrible example of poor. Miss Johnstone, exhibited
in the trial of SIGNOR Collucci, to lavish their affections and their
money on a leering foreign scoundrel, who despises the former, but
entertains the greatest possible regard and respect for the latter.

ORIGINAL POEMS FOR GERMAN MINDS.
THERE was a large pond, and a deepish pond too
And across it great Swans at their ease swam and flew:
Went backwards and forwards with splash and with sound,
Orin confident majesty sailed round and round.
One day a fat chicken that lived thereabout
Stood watching to see the Swans glide in and out,
Now still, and now waving their pinions of snow,
She thought, of all things, she should like to do so.
This silly fat chicken was German by birth,
And was meant to live quietly clucking on earth,
And her business with water was only a joke:
Just sometimes to wash when too grimy with smoke.
But the chick felt ambition distending her crop,
And she thought it as easy to swim as to hop,
Though the Swans gave her warning with friendliest shout,
“You silly fat chicken, mind what you’re about.”
“My feet, wings, and feathers, for aught I can see,
Areas good as the Swans' are for swimming,” says she,
And though I’m fat and feeble, and they’re strong of limb,
Is that any reason why I should not swim?
“Why should not I try then, as well as those birds,
It’s nothing but jealousy dictates their words,
And I know I shall do it with i. and with skill
For a bird that can Think can do just what she will.”
Then in this poor ignorant animal flew, ...
But soon found her friends the Swans' cautions were true:
She splashed, and she dashed, and she turned herself round,
And heartily wished herself safe on the ground.
But now 'twas too late to begin to repent,
The harder she º: the deeper she went;.
And at last when each effort did nothing but fail,
A good-natured Swan pulled her out by the tail.
Then the Swans I perceived began * to laugh,
Till the poor little German was mad at their chaff,
But its moral, my dears, we all understand;
And all fat little Germans will stick upon land.
A NEW SANITARY TAX.

AMENDS TO AMERICA.
MR. PUNCH is very anxious to conciliate his American friends,
North and South. They have expressed some irritation at the
language of a portion of our press in reference to certain rowdyism
ºf ruffianism which prevail in the States, but of which we should
never have known anything, let JonATHAN, recollect, but for his own
press. We, however, wish to make everything pleasant, and we take
an opportunity of appeasing our Transatlantic cousins by making a
sacrifice to their offended feelings. It is true that the sacrifice is of
little value, but between friends it is the intention, of a donor, and not
the worth of the article, that stamps a present with a price. We have
heard, and have been compelled to believe, that there are a great many
writers in America who use their pens in an unworthy fashion, indulging
in personal details and in vulgar vituperation. America must allow
that this is so. But, on the other hand, such writers are not exclu-
sively American. iſ. Punch's attention has just been called to an
article in a paper, called the Liverpool Albion. The article is from the
pº of the London Gºrº, of that journal, and is headed
‘Metropolitan Gossip.” r. Punch will extract from the mess no
more than is sufficient to make the single sentence which he proposes
to *. comprehensible }...". and by Englishmen also. He
would apologise for so defiling three inches of his paper, but a foul
kite's wings are pulled open when he is nailed over the poultry-house

. The Liverpool Albion's London Correspondent has this to say touch:
ing a number of gentlemen, of whom it is impossible that he should
know anything personally, unless he has been engaged as an extra
waiter at some public dinner at which they may have attended.
“Returning to our Mayor, and such a mare's nest as the Mansion House now is
might make a hippopotamus laugh; for he—not the hippopotamus, but the other
gentleman—isn't the size of a Manx alſº though from the name, CUBITT, you
might anticipate prodigious perpendicularity, a la Goliath. Perhaps he has it in
laterality, and is stupendous sideways? No. Well, then in protuberantiality,
carrying a capon-lined corporation in advance of the head works ;-enceirte, in the
engineering, not in the obsteteric[Sic] significance of that technical term? No. As
our usual luck would have it, whenever there is special reason for presentiug a parti-
cularly ºf personnel to the foreigner, we are sure to offer some Rºjº s
burlesque on the traditions of that British physique immemorially famed for
grace of lineament, and symmetry of limb, and impressiveness of stature, and
general corporeal attributes proper to the cross of the prize breeds of the human
race, as our Normandic-Celtico- onic-Anglofied mixture is. Yet what must they
think of us at Vienna, from Lord John, followed by LEveR and Roebuck? What at
Pekin, from ELGIN; at Petersburg, from Wodehouse; at Paris, from Cowley; at
Constantinople, from HENRY Bulwea; at Washington, from Lyons?—the very spots
of all others on this earth where our “porcelain of the human clay,” “glasses of
fashion and moulds of form,' should be shown off to edify the stranger with admi-
ration, instead of astonishing the natives with the reverse. CUBITT is a caricature
on a Lord Mayor, for he looks as if he were always dining with HUMPHREY. The
other HUMPHREY, not the Duke, but the Alderman, could, without much incon-
venience, clap CUBITT in his pocket, or stow him away in his digester, where much
tougher pabulum º finds a place, and seemingly of not less bulk, to judge
by certain abdominable [Sic] indications about that capacious wharfinger. CUBITT
is a Hop-o'-my-Thumb, with weazel eyes, pinky complexion, and enormous spec-
tacles; and stared at indeed will he be § spectators from abroad during the
forthcoming influx.”
The single sentence which Mr. Punch begs to add, in humble humi-
liation, is this—he does not believe that America, with all her resources
in the ribald department, can produce a more vulgar or more stupid
blackguard than the London Correspondent of the Žicerpool Albion.
Neighbours Getting over their Distance to one Another.
The South-Eastern Railway º have placed a new boat, the
Victoria, on the Boulogne and Folkestone line, and which accom- |
plishes the distance in an hour and twenty-seven minutes. We
rejoice at this, as we do at any event that brings France and England
nearer to one another. If steam succeeds in making the two countries
closer friends, it will be classed as the greatest of the triumphs that have
already been recorded in its favour. The kettle, in the vapour of which
young WATT prophetically saw the first steamer, will thus turn out
the most powerful pacificator the world has ever known. For this, and
other considerations, the Peace Society could not do better than adopt
the kettle as its crest-taking, at the same time, as its motto, “Its
Empire is Peace”—for the song it is always singing (a “Song without
Words” as tuneful as any that MENDElssohn ever wrote) is the peace ||
i. hould take the precedence of every other—that of the domestic
earth.

A Little Disappointment.

PRECIOUS PROSELYTES.
THE subjoined passage occurs in certain “Correspondence º the Spiritual
Condition of Convicts in the Hants County Prison, between the Visiting Justices
and the REv. J. Colling RIDGE,” quoted by the Tablet. MR. Colling RIDGE, it
must be premised, has been complaining that the Common Prayer Book is left in
the cells of Roman Catholic prisoners:—
“Why should a book which thus speaks of what Catholics deem most sacred, be thrust upon
a Catholic? My poor prisoners are most of them Irishmen and soldiers, and as such are the most
likely to feel deeply, and resent keenly the grievances complained of. As Irishmen they are fully
*... in any of the gaols of their own country, none of these hardships would be inflicted
upon them.”
º
T How very strange, if true, it is that MR. ColliNGRIDGE’s “poor prisoners”
should be so “fully aware,” as he describes them to be, of the nature of the spiritual
arrangements, existing in the gaols of Ireland. fxperience alone could have
rendered uneducated and * men so intimately acquainted with the economy
of prison interiors. At this rate, they must be very old and inveterate, if not
incorrigible, offenders. The religious influences which have heretofore been brought
to bear upon them can have availed but little, and there may be reason to question
whether it would not be almost desirable to try upon such very confirmed
criminals the experiment, how great a hardship soever, of even putting the Prayer
Book in their way. Popery having failed to reclaim these Roman Catholic rogues,
is there not some excuse to be made for endeavouring to get them, uncompelled,
to undergo a Protestant reformation?
THE CoMING MAN.—We read that “ the old Palace at Avignon is being
sumptuously renovated by order of the EMPEROR.” This looks promising. It
holds out the hope that the Pope has at last received notice to quit. Surrounded

THE PRINCE AT THE BAR.
IN the Strand is a commotion,
There’s a press at Temple Bar:
Where like crossing tides of Ocean,
Eastern, western, currents war:
'Busses pause in mid-careering,
Cabbies sit in forced repose,
While from box and foot-board fleering
Chaff keeps gath’ring as it goes'
When I ask the cause of ºf;
'Tis the PRINCE OF WALEs I’m told,
Who to-day assumes the wrappage,
Of the legal toga's fold.
Utter Barrister they’ll make him,
Then within the Bar invite,
Then upon the Bench they'll take him,
All per saltum—as is right.
“There’s no royal road to learning,”
'Tis a proverb false as stale:
Made by men, in envy spurning
At the ranks beyond their pale.
Lo, this gracious Prince to learning
n the royal road we see—
Ne'er was road so full of turning
As that road appears to be.
First, as we have seen, due Nor’rards,
It to Modern Athens tends:
Then, where subjects’ roads lead for’rards,
Sudden due South it bends.
He must follow it to Cambridge,
Where he hopes repose to know,
After having crossed the same bridge,
O'er which subject asses go.
No—this royal road no mercy
Shows a prince in course of cram:
Round it whips him, ricey-versy,
To the Isis from the Câm.
Ask him not if mathematic,
Or if classic be his choice,
By this royal road erratic -
He must trudge, without a voice.
Off it whisks him to the Curragh,

Then to make confusion thorough,

for the year 1859 that
were published a few
weeks ago to be cor-
rect, it seems that fifty-
six women attained what

considering rather a
Farr fetched opinion)
“the natural lifetime
of a hundred i.
Taking 100 as the pro-
per terminus of life,
there are very few hu-
man beings we are
afraid, who ever reach
their journey’s end. It
Wººd seem as though
there were as many ac-
cidents on one's jour-
ney through life as
there are unfortunately
on a railway ! Most
travellers break down
halfway, or rarely arrive at the station they were anxious to reach.
For instance, according to the Registrar's return, only twenty-five
men attained a hundred years—twenty-five men against fifty-six women,
who accomplished the same distance. There, you see the women
beat the men in everything ! . They even beat us in living longer.
Not only will they have the last word, but they insist, also, upon
having the last minute! The wonder is that they allow themselves
to be iºn by Death even. We can understand with a woman, who
says resolutely “I will, not die,” how very difficult it must be for
Pallida Mors to get the better of her obstinacy." Of course, not one of
those fifty-six female centenarians were married; for if we are to believe
the police reports that chronicle the doings of low life, it would seem
that, where marriage is concerned, it is the husband who beats the
wife. Therefore, when we said that woman beats man in everything,
we intended one little exception, and that was wife-beating. But we
are wrong, perhaps, in alluding to such contemptible creatures, who
far from ranking equal to Man, degrade themselves to a lower level
even than that of the Brute.
The two oldest persons in the Registrar's returns for 1859, are
women—one in Monmouthshire, and one in South Wales, each of
whom reached the patriarchal age of 110. You see how the Welsh
obstinacy asserted itself characteristically up to the very last. You
may be sure that each good old soul had made up her mind not to die a
day before she was five-score years and ten—no, not even if she
perished in the attempt
! We wonder if the above ladies were in the habit of proudly confessing
their ages, oras ladies sometimes will, resorted to the arithmetical practice

of making a liberal subtraction from the sum total? In answer to the
inquiries of curious strangers, did they truthfully, say, “Well, next

begins to fail me a wee bit, but I am afraid that next birthday I shall be
as much as forty-two—it may be, forty-three-or, perhaps, only forty-
one. At my time of life, Sir, what is the difference of one year?”. We
have not endeavoured to give the above answers in the choice Cambrian
tongue, inasmuch as we happen to be rejoicingly ignorant of that pre-
Adamite language; but su posing that woman’s little weakness on the
point of age, strengthened instead of growing feebler the longer she
#. (and old age has the reverse effect on a mental weakness than it
as on a physical one), the answers, we fancy, would not fall very far
short of the second form we have complaisantly, conjectured above.
We call forty-two a very fair, confession for a lady who has been con-
victed by the Registrar-General to be not more than 110.

THERE's a thimblerigger has his stand
In the stately Tuileries,
And never did rig, on a scale so big,
Draw such a companie
As watch the twist of that nimble wrist,
As it works the Roman peal
His board is a map of the fair estate
That MATILDA gave the Pope,
In days afar when the triple tiar
With crowns en masse could cope;
When St. Peter's boat had water to float,
And was taut in ribs and rope.
Cross keys and a sword are the legs of the board,
And in place of the thimbles three,
'Neath which, in a vulgar rig, the flats
Look out for the little pea,
There's a little cocked hat, and a Cardinal's hat,
And a Bersaglier's képi.
The little cocked hat it stands for France;
The Cardinal's hat for Rome;
The képistands for Italy
Who’d square home affairs at home:
But there's the French Cock on the Capitol's rock,
And who’s to cut his Comb?

And so goes on the little game,
While the Roman pea doth spin,
From hat to hat, till what to be at,
The flats to doubt begin—
And ’tis pretty clear, of all that are here,
But one is meant to win.
Back which you choose, you’re as safe to lose
As a duck to swim to land;
But there’s one bet, which if you can get,
In with you I'd like to stand;
That wherever it be, the little pea
Is well in the rigger's hand
POINTING A CANNON WITH A MORAL PURPOSE.
IF Cannons must fire, we do not see why their shot should not be

much money into the sea, when the same expenditure would demolish

when the next experiments are tried with the Armstrong guns, they
should be brought to bear upon that ugly block of buildings that stand
as much in the way of moral as of human progress, and which act, the
part of a blockade in the most crowded part of the Strand. We allude
to that vile haunt of impurity and infidelity known as Holywell Street.
If SIR WILLIAM ARMstrong can succeed in removing that, filthy
impediment, to the free circulation of fresh air and pure thought, we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN EXTENSIVE SEIZURE OF TOBACCO.
LAST week an extensive seizure of Tobacco took place in one of the
most fashionable houses in Belgravia, under most peculiar circum-
stances. On Thursday, about half-past eleven o’clock, as LADY
DEBRETT (whilst the inquiry is pending, we have, of course, abstained
from giving the real names) was about to retire to bed for the night,
she fancied she could detect strong fumes, which, to her refined sense,
appeared to be those of Tobaccoſ º naturally alarmed, as any
lady, under similar circumstances, would have been, she did not
hesitate a moment, but courageously opened the door when the strong
smell, that pervaded the entire establishment, no longer left her in
doubt as to the fearful mature of the fact. Nothing daunted, she threw
over her shoulders the nearest peignoir at hand, and proceeded up-stairs
in the dark, imagining, with a quickness of truthful discrimination,
which is the highest proof of her great presence of mind, that a candle
might ºf: give the offender timely notice of her approach,
Feeling her way cautiously by the banisters, her ladyship trusted
entirely to the instinct of her nasal organ, which was unquestionably
the best guide she could have had to lead her in the midst of the
surrounding darkness. As she gradually advanced the fumes became also
gradually stronger and stronger, until, on reaching the second landing,
there is but little doubt that her ladyship would have fainted, if she
had not prudently leant against the wall for, temporary support, during
which brief period she only too fortunately succeeded in recovering
her breath.
Her sinking energies, so perfectly unused to the severe trial to
which they were being exposed, reminded her, however, that there was no
time to be lost; so, darting forward again with as much caution as her
owing terror would allow her to exercise, she stood opposite the
i. from which she felt confident the suffocating vapour was nau-
seously escaping. . It was a small, deal-painted door on the right-hand
corner of the third landing before you arrive at the nurseries. In less
time than it takes us to narrate this painful story, she had turned the
brass handle of that door, and, resolving to allow the culprit no time or
opportunity of escape, she rushed º into the middle of the room,
.# contemplated with what nerve she had left the awful spectacle
before her
The sight that met her maternal eyes almost made her ladyshi
repent her impetuous rashness. There was her youngest boy—a 1
barely eight years of age—busily employed, in bed, smoking a short
pipe #. young monster's head was scarcely visible on the pillow, so
closely was it surrounded by the thick clouds of smoke he had, with an
energy worthy of a better cause, been º intent upon blowing.
#.i. has since stated that the effect of that startling revelation
upon her was such, that she thought she should have sunk through the
floor then and there with horror /
To throw open the windows—to snatch the pipe out of the young
culprit's mouth, and to fling it into the streets, heedless of the conse-
quences, was only the work of an instant
Without listening to her better feelings, her ladyship next proceeded
to administer to her offending offspring a most tremendous box on the
ears, that certainly had the effect of awakening him to a sense of his
degrading position. In this she persevered with the best effect, until
the boy evaded all further chastisement by disappearing under the bed-
clothes, and, with an obstimacy hardly credible in one of his tender
years, persisting in remaining there!
A rigorous search was then instituted in the room, and in the various
drawers were found the following articles:–One acket of Bristol Bird's
Eye, 6 screws (contents unknown), 4 ounces of Cavendish, #lb of Shag,
15 Manillas (one half-smoked), 2 Meerschaums (one as fresh as chalk—
the other of a rich horse-chestnut colour), half a dozen Clay Pipes, of
different lengths, but mostly small, and several handsfull of Cigarettes.
In a bandbox were found secreted inside an old hat, as many as 32
penny Cubas.
The whole of the above had evidently been smuggled into the
establishment, and, being contraband articles, were immediately con-
fiscated on the spot by her ladyship.
The confiscation has created a great excitement in the juvenile circles
of Belgravia. -
The boy, thus openly convicted of smuggling, remains under the cus-
tody of a governess and a nurse. He is under close confinement. All the
servants have received strict orders to watch the street-door, as well as to
*** eye on the area-gate, in the event of an escape being attempted.
e young smuggler was asked if he had anything to say for himself,
and, after being duly cautioned that what he did say would be brought
up against him at the trial, he simply observed, “he didn't care.”
It is feared that the trial cannot be commenced for some time, as
SIR ANTHONY HERCULES DEBRETT is at present out of town. The
penalties, it is surmised, will be extremely severe, as there are rumours,
current amongst the prisoner's companions, that SIR ANTHONY, has an
invincible dislike for tobacco, is a Brutus in his household in seeing that
no offender against the domestic laws escapes without punishment, and
moreover is a staunch advocate for the salutary effects of corporeal
punishment.
It is with no little pain we state that, ever since the above extensive
seizure of Tobacco, Y DEBRETT has not been able to leave her
room.
..We would be sorry to prejudge this, or any, case; but we think it is
high time that a terrible example were made to deter little babies of
boys from the injurious practice of smoking.
EPISCOPAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
DR. THOMson, the new Bishop of Gloucester, is stated to be an
expert photographer. LoRD SHAFTESBURY begs us to add that his
last creation, is also an ecclesiastic of the decided school, and in fact,
that all his views are Positives.

AUSTRIAN JUSTICE.
According to a letter from Vienna:—
“M. ProtoBEveRA has requested the EMPEROR to relieve him definitively from
the functions of Minister of Justice, since, owing to the precarious state of his eyes,
he has been advised by his physician to desist from all attention to business.”
Of course the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA will accept M. PROTOBEVERA's
resignation of the Ministry of Justice, tendered on a ground so insu-
perable as that of the precarious state of his eyes. What if M. PRO:
ToBEyERA were to lose his sight? The eyes of Justice, as personified
in painting and sculpture, are closed with a bandage, and in every land
of H.º. is provérbially blind; but, in other lands she has to
look to her scales; and blind Justice is inadmissible in Austria.
Rich Humbug.
THERE is always such a fuss made about the “reserve” at the Bank.
We wonder how the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has the face to
talk about her “reserve,” when she knows she is perpetually, “making
advances, and even takes the greatest possible interest in so doing.”

THEIR Majesties, the KING and
QUEEN of PRussia, on a late aus;
icious occasion, gave a grand ball
in the Picture º and White
Hall, in the Royal Palace. We
should not deem it necessary to
transcribe this piece of not very
momentous intelligence for its
own sake. It is, however, coupled
with a statement to the effect, that
the ball began at nine o'clock,
according to a custom which at
the Prussian Court is punctually
adhered to. This custom is one
which deserves to be honoured in
the observance, instead of being,
as in this country, generally disho-
moured in the breach. Herein the
Majesty of Prussiasets an example,
which if our aristocracy would imi-
tate, they would confer a great boom
on the middling classes, who, under
an inevitable necessity of aping
their superiors, are obliged to give
evening parties which commence
at unseasonable hours, and are not
over until three and four o'clock in
the morning; whereas a consider-
able portion of the guests have to
be at their business º ten. Thus,
instead of combining business with
pleasure, they combine business
with pain—headache, drowsiness
and lassitude—to the detriment o
their affairs, whilst the same habits
of dissipation, which impair their
intellectual faculties, ruin the
complexions of their wives and
daughters.

CRIMINAL CRYSTALLISATION.
MR. PUNCH is very glad, of course, that a Dublin jury convicted the
rascal cab-man CURRAN for the assault on Miss Jolly, and also that
Justice Q'BRIEN gave him as heavy a sentence as the law allows. But
Mr. Punch would like to ask the Morning News, a Dublin newspaper
whence the following paragraph is taken, what was the exact character
of the change wrought in the prisoner when his punishment was an-
nounced * The News says:—
“The prisoner during the passing of the sentence never moved a muscle, but as
soon as the learned Judge announced the term of imprisonment, his face blanched,
and he seemed to be rather hardened-stricken by the punishment awarded.”
The phenomenon would seem to be a new one... We have heard of
folks being struck all of a heap, and we can poetically conceive that
when a Judge comes heavily down on a prisoner, he is reduced to a
jelly, and the sentence in the CURRAN-Jolly case might have made the
man Currant-Jelly. But how he became rather hardened-stricken we
cannot quite comprehend. He never moved a muscle, , though the
Judge told him that in other days he would have had a hoister; and
altogether he seems to be a queer kind of scoundrel, and very well out of
the way for a couple of years. When the News has nothing else to do,
perhaps it will explain the hardened-stricken business, and we solemnly
promise not to open the paper containing the explanation. ..

THE PRINCES IN THE TEMPLE.
Thursday Erening, 31st October, 1861. The Ceremonial of Conterting
H. R. H. THE PRINCE OF WALEs into a Barrister and Bencher,
and of inaugurating MR. ABRAHAM's New Library, has been per-
formed, the Church has been admired, and the Déjeuner has been
eafen. The PRINCE of WALEs, with the slightest yawn, looks at
PRINCE PUNCH, and the two Princes emerge from the Middle Temple
Hall, and proceed towards the Fountain, which is sparkling in the
coloured electric light.
Policeman (henceforth immortal), This Garden is open to ladies only,
gentlemen.
[At this moment the blue ribbon of one Prince and the red nose of the
other flash upon the eyes of the speaker, and he faints into the
arms of MR. ANDERSON, Q.C., the excellent Master Treasurer.
The Princes enter the Fountain Garden, and all the world keeps
fits distance.

P. H. Rather I brought these over myself; but you know them–

to the spectators.

P. W. I wonder what they think we’re talking about?
P. P. Oh, elegant. Of course I am saying to you that I am sure an
occasion like that which has brought you hither to-day must be fraught
with the most interesting associations—historical, social, and prospec-
tive; and that from an educated and highly cultivated mind, like your

a good word, germinate—
P. W. Impressions can’t germinate.
P. P. You know a good deal, my dear Edward, but you don’t know

P. W. Then I suppose I am º in a becoming manner, that

' A NEW STAND-POINT OF GEOGRAPHY.
AT º meeting of the Town Council of Margate, we find
reported in the Thanet Advertiser (a wonderful newspaper—price only
three-halfpence) that—
“MR. CAveler moved that a deputation should be appointed to wait on SIR
GEORGE GREY to represent to him in full how Margate stood.”
They had better also take with them a bag of boiled shrimps, as a
specimen of its produce. However, they may as well spare themselves
the trouble and expense of the journey, for we should say it was highly
probable that SIR §. GREY, by this time, did know where Mar-
#. stood. If he has any doubts, we refer him to the reports of the
own Council, and he will there be able to see that Margate stands a
great deal of monsense.
A NEW COMPLAINT.
A Novel, complaint has been brought before the notice of a Police
Magistrate. It is known by the name—and we are indebted to MR.
HUMPHREYs for the information—of “ kleptomania.” Its symptoms
are described as consisting “in a strange and inexplicable desire to take
what does not belong to you.” We fancy we have heard the same thing
before called “thieving,” but there is a great difference between the
two offences. A low, vulgar person is a “thief; ” a person in genteel
circumstances is a “kleptomaniac.” The first takes “vot isn't his’n’”
for the purpose of helping himself; the second commits the like offence
it is true, but then it is because the poor creature cannot help himself.
It is malgré lui. The ſingers move convulsively, as though they were
seized with an immoral itch to seize hold of the property of others.
You must no more blame him than you would a patient, who was
labouring under the effects of ST. VITUs’ dance, for he is not responsible
for his movements. Such an unhappy sufferer deserves pity rather
than censure; he should be nursed and petted, and not be condemned,
or put to any harsh punishment. He should be carried . in a
doctor's carriage, and not in the prison yan. It is sad to think how
many persons in the olden time were hung for stealing, whilst they were
merely labouring under a temporary attack of “kleptomania” . It is
a question, indeed, whether all our thieves' Fº ought not to be
changed into “hospitals for the reception of kleptomaniacs.” We
wonder what Widocq the great thief-taker would have said to this new

THE CATCHPENNY PRESS.
Good Wine needs no bush, nor any kind of poster; still
less does it, in order to sell, require fellows to go about the
street, and shout “Yah-hah!” meaning cheap claret and
champagne. What is true of wine is also true of the press,
that is to say, the newspaper press, even the penny por-
tion of it; for that, though selling dirt-cheap, is not .."of
it mere rubbish, which is expensive at a nny, and would
not be cheap at any price. The respectable º papers
command a sale simply by the reputation, they have ac-
quired, and the legitimate help of bill-boards of their con-
tents, exhibited at the doors of the news-shops. Their
despicable contemporaries, however, offered at the same
price, and worth less than nothing, except for their material,
which, too thin to be of much use, is simply spoiled by the
print and woodcuts impressed upon it, can only be forced
into a small circulation, amongst the lowest readers, by
being hawked about the streets like dogs’ meat. The noise
made by itinerant newsmongers in crying “Yah-hah!”
and . yells indicative of their several com-
modities make morning noon and night hideous, and Sun-
day morning especially intolerable, in what used to be the
º: streets and squares of London. ...The shouts and
shrieks that proclaim “Sprats!” and “Mackerel!” may
be regarded as necessary nuisances. Mackerel and sprats
are esculent, and spoil by keeping. There can be no me-
cessity, however, for crying § for the mind which is
good to eat, still less can there be any for splitting the ears
of householders by crying what is utterly, bad, namely,
penny papers of the baser sort, albeit on the *. which
certainly cannot be denied, that, like sprats and mackerel,
they are perishable commodities.

A GRAND DRESS REHEARSAL.
It is a pretty dress rehearsal, when a young lady takes
a visitor up to her bed-room, and begins showing her
the beautiful new dresses she has lately been buying. . She
should try them all on, one after the other, before the look-
ing-glass, and press her dear friend, in the most persuasive
manner, to give her opinion upon each. The performance
is all the more effective, when the visitor happens to be in
an inferior position of society, so that the pieces, which are
brought forward for her flattering notice, are so nicely
arranged as to be above the reach of her pocket. How-
ever, the best time without comparison for a Grand Dress
Rehearsal is when a young lady is going to a QUEEN's
Drawing Room. oo many young friends cannot be
invited to witness the éclat .# so delightful a performance,
taking care of course to avoid any inconvenience from
overcrowding, and even upon so rare an occasion, ser-
vants have i. known to be kindly admitted to witness
the grand finale.
OUR SUPERIORS IN EVERYTHING.
THE growing popularity of the new teaspoon bonnet, among our
countrymen, supervening on that ºf crinoline, is additional homage to
the exquisite taste of France. The French certainly do excel us in
i. We are never, tired of seeing this unquestionable truth
tacitly conceded, or of hearing it loudly proclaimed. In every respect
we are inferior to the French, and so are all the other nations ºEurope.
Not only does France surpass land in street architecture, statuettes,
fancy furniture, military organisation, millinery, cookery, and dancing.
The French are our superiors in all the higher lines of thought
science, and philosophy. "We have no great dramatist and universal
genius, nor grand epic |.." to compare with their least eminent
authors, no archphilosopher, no famous astronomer, no chemical inves-
tigator, no anatomical and º iscoverer, no mechanician,
that deserves to be named in the same breath with certain Frenchmen
of the same description. It was a Frenchman that prescribed the
laws of scientific inquiry, another that disclosed the principle of gra-
vitation, another #!". the circulation of the blood,
another that invented the steam-engine, another that discovered the
metallic bases of the alkalis. We owe locomotives and railways to
France. The whole railway system is, in fact, a French idea.
As to music, painting, sculpture, and all the higher departments of
art, not only do the *rench beat us all to nothing, but they also beat
the Italians and Germans, to whose sublimest poetical geniuses, and
profoundest writers, moreover, a great many of their own are immea-
surably superior. -
To say that the Army and Navy of France are, the latter as well as
the former, incomparably greater, better disciplined, and more efficient,
than our land and sea forces, is to concede far less than the truth.
Their excellence is not only absolute, but relative, they are stronger and
better than ours in proportion to their size; one Frenchman is a match
for three Englishmen; and our conflicts with the French, both in the
field and on the ocean, have been, on our part, an almost uniform series
of reverses. We never were the victors in anything like a fair and
equalº
Finally, it has been reserved for the French to do what we have never
yet been able to accomplish; to “teach the nations how to live” under
a constitutional government, and to enjoy personal liberty, and the
freedom of the press and of speech, compatibly with order.
The foregoing acknowledgments are due to a glorious but modest
nation, and will, it is hoped, afford those ignorant Britons who would
like to know in what particulars the French so vastly excel us as they
are alleged to do, the desired information.
One of the Worst Aspects of the American War.
SINCE the great scarcity of Cotton, the Parisian milliners have been
charging fifty, and seventy, and as much as eighty-two per gent, extra
for padding. If the scarcity should still continue, it will be frightful to
contemplate upon the thousands and thousands of French beauties that
will be pinched by the want of it during the coming winter.

“Of course it is incompatible with the
dignity of grown men and women to
amuse themselves with wooden horses
and gaily-decked dolls. But as the long-
ing which beset them in infancy still
remains to be gratified, they take one of
their fellow-creatures, and go through
with him the merry antics which they
were accustomed to perform with their
childish toys. This prevailing tendency
received yesterday a striking illustra-
tion. The scene was the Middle Temple,
a fane dedicated to the worship, if not
precisely of justice, at any rate of law—
within whose walls the seats of highest
dignity are only to be attained by com-
mon folks through years of anxious
struggle and midnight toil. * * * *

REPORT.
“The day was altogether a memorable
one in the history of the Temple. The
admission of royalty among its members;
the auspicious opening of its new library
by one who will at some future, and it is
to be hoped far distant, period be king of
these realms; the crowd of beauty and
nobility of blood and intellect which was
gathered together to take part in the
ceremony, all will leave an impress
upon the annals of the Society, which
ages will not obliterate. In speaking of
the event after it is over, it is difficult to
decide which was of the most interest
and importance, the opening of the
library, or the investiture of the PRINCE
of WALEs with the privileges and flig-
nities of a bencher of the Temple. It is
one of the most encouraging signs of the
times that a member of our reigning
Royal Family should be found comin
forward to receive, not the honours whic
are given to warriors, but those more
homely, and it may be, more dignified
honours which attach to a profession that
has done much to maintain the liberties
of the people and their sovereign rights.”

STAGGERERS FROM THE STAGE.
THESE theatrical advertisements grow more and more perplexing to
us. Every week we see announcements of actors being wanted “to
open” at a stated time, as though º: like oysters, and never
a week passes without º or other wanting some one else or
other to “combine utility with the leading business,” which really
seems like asking him to undertake the duties of a blindman's dog.
As a sample of these puzzles, only look at this:–

to Play also portion of the Light Comedy and Juveniles. Also, a GENTLE-
MAN for responsible business. HARLEQUIN and COLUMBINE wanted for

“York Circuit”! So an actor goes on circuit like a barrister. Well,
they have also this in common, namely, that they both wear wigs. But
why are “walking” gentlemen so often in request? We never heard
of walking matches done upon the stage, and where can be the need
then of engaging walking people?, Again, too, will this walking gen-
tleman have to wear a pinafore, when he plays a juvenile? It is mys:
teriously said that he will have to play a “portion º comedy and
juveniles,” but how he can enact a portion of a juvenile it, passes our
conception even distantly to guess. oreover if the juveniles are, like
the comedy, to be light (and there is nothing in the sentence which
forbids this supposition), the walking gentleman will have to put him-
self in training, to decrease his ponderosity to the weight of a light
juvenile, whatever that may be.
As a contrast to this levity, we find in the same column of dramatic
wants the following:—
THEATRE ROYAL, PRESTON.
WANº. immediately, a good HEAVY MAN ; one that understands
Melodramatic Pieces. Also, a good OLD MAN.
We wonder how much does the management require this, “heavy
man” to weigh. Would sixteen stone suffice, or must he not be under
twenty? And what age must the “old man” have attained to be held
eligible? We presume that on emergency seventy would do, though
doubtless a fit preference would be ceded to a hundred. But then what
testimonials must he furnish of his goodness? Of course nobody would
wish to hire a bad old, man, but different minds put vastly different
yalues on morality, and what is vice in one man's eye is almost virtue
in another. -
We really think more details, should be furnished on these points, if
only to prevent unnecessary writing : for the man who is the cause of
a man's writing needless letters is a monster who deserves to be nearly
. in ink, after being stabbed almost to death with magnum-
Onums.
There is a Revolution Always of Some Kind in Paris.
PARIs is still essentially the City of Barricades. There is only this
small difference: formerly the barricades were erected by men with the
help of stones; nowadays they are erected by women, in the shape of
Crinolines. The EMPEROR has succeeded in putting down the former
by calling in the aid of MADAM. Is there no M'Eve, whose crushing
assistance, he could invoke, to enable him to put down the latter?
Perhaps there never was any revolution in the Fashions that was
carried by means of so many barricades as that of the Crinoline—and
the worst is, that though the revolution has been successfully accom-
lished, the barricades still continue, in all their force, and are felt to
e dreadfully in the way of progress, as there are few persons, whose
temper, or dress, is not materially ruiſed in the awkward attempts they
make to get over them.
Gladstone's Advice, and Punch's.
The way for a sensible man to behave,
Aware of the savings' bank plan,

And utmost of shillings he can.

So many stones and pebbles have been thrown at M. Du CHAILLU, on

SAMUEL THE SAINT-SEER,
WE rejoice to see the Bishop of Oxford on his legs again, for he
has been laid up, and he is a famous orator. In a speech highly calcu-
lated to sustain his º for eloquence, made at York, on behalf
of the county blind-school, occurs, the very remarkable passage sub-
joined. “Let every man,” said the Bishop, “think how to himself
through the eye had come the sense of beauty”— and so forth :—
“Let him think what it was never once to have looked upon the innocent bright-
ness of an infant's countenance; what it was never once to have seen the radiance
and glory which mantled around the features of the Holy Saints.”
The º passage is very fine, but rather obscure. What it is
“to have looked upon the innocent brightness of an infant's counten-
ance,” *Wº: know. Brightness is a quality commonly ascribed
to smiles... We all of us, who enjoy the use of our eyes, have seen many
a baby with a clean shiny face, just washed, smiling with an expression
of thepurest innocence, the process of ablution being over; º a
few moments before, during that process, it had been crying fright uily,
and making the most vicious faces. But how many of us have seen
‘the radiance and º which mantle around the faces of the Holy
Saints?” Pictures of the luminous appearance, which the Bishop thus
alludes to are familiar enough to the generality of *:::: but the
phenomenon itselfisone that we never, heretofore, knew anybody who had
witnessed, or thought that he had, or even said that he had. Bishop
WILBERFORCE, however, who mentions it as amatter of i. observa-
tion to all but the blind, is of course constantly in the habit of seeing it
under favourable conditions himself, and thinks that it is seen as well
by mankind at large. But he is evidently, by special faculty, a seer of
saints; and he seems to see so many as to make it appear that they are
more numerous now-a-days, than they are generally, supposed. The
hosphorescence with which the old, painters usually represent the
eads of holy prelates as surrounded, º be an emanation of what
BARON REIchENBAch calls the Odig or Qdylic light, perceptible only
to certain persons, whom he terms “sensitives.” Perhaps the Bishop
of OxpoRD is a sensitive, and thus accustomed to behold the radiance
and glory mantling around the features of the Hºly Saints; that is to
say, when he sees them in the dark, for then only are the odylic rays
visible. When, therefore, the Bishop, going to bed at º puts his
candle out, and is consequently, accordi i.” the solution of the popular
riddle, where Moses (the tailor) was, under the same circumstances, let
us chérish the supposition that he beholds the reflection of a brillian
halo whensoever he casts his eyes on the looking-glass. -

PLAN FOR RELIEWING THE BISHOPS.
.THE real Archbishop and head of the English Church, DR. LushingtoN, has
given his decision in the matter in which his subaltern, the Bishop of WIN-
CHESTER, demanded his interference; a clergyman, named HEATH being the
delinquent. ARCHBishop Punch is, of course, not going to stamp on theological
corns, and evades remark upon the case itself, beyond the observation that ARCH-
Bishop Lush INGTON seems to regard bustling Bishop BURNET as the Fountain of
Anglican Theology, a view which will much delight the Patristics and others. But
a more Fº consideration occurs to the Fleet Street Archbishop. His most
reverend and right reverend Brethren in lawn complain that they are over-worked

tºo much which they ought to do. ARchbishop Punch therefore proposes to save
them a great deal of trouble. Why not remit candidates for orders at once to head.

Fox, in the first instance, to be put through his theological paces, and duly trained
for his ra. Then, if he bolts out of the course, it will be ARCHBishop Lush-
{NGºon’s business to deal with his own pupil. Anchºrshop Pusch respectfully
ºnvites Convocation to consider this proposition, which has come strongly upon
ºmind since his perusal of the HEATH case, and his discovery that the real head
of the English Church is the excellent and venerable Archbishop Lushington.

One who for more pin-money
Will not weekly press,
And will even love her husband
Better than her dress.
Who will share his fortune,

And without a pair of ponies
Will manage to exist.
Who in London after August

And can finish of her toilette
Without a lady’s maid.

A cause for fight or fuss,
And even on emergency
Will travel by a 'bus.
Who'll mend a shirt or stocking,
And a pie or pudding make,
And will not want a doctor
If her little ſinger ache.
A wife who'll not look sulky
If carte blanche she be denied
With her milliner and jeweller,
And fifty shops beside.
Who'll not lie in bed for breakfast,
Nor of cruelty complain
If she lunch without hot jelly,
And dine without champagne.

Who will not sigh to go,
Nor will deem a quiet jºi

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
wiNG to MonsLEUR
FE c HTER, dear
Punch, there is quite
a shower of blacks
just now upon the
stage, enough really
to remind one of the

tres were deluged

and whereof some
sprinklings are seen

ing i. faces to
appear before the

that fact may seem
to savour of mono-
tony, there is no lack
of variety in the parts
as they are played.
For the benefit of
playgoers of a dozen
centuries hence, to
*
whom Punch will doubtless be the only journal extant of the pre-
sent period, I may mention that the trio to whom I have referred
are M. FEchTER at the Princess's, MR. BROOKE at Drury Lane
and MR. PHELPs at Sadler's Wells. Of these, the first an second
are as opposite in style as two actors well can be; the one full of
intellectual polish and refinement, while the other relies mainly upon
physical exertion, and wins the good will of the gallery by his vehe-
mence of yoice. MR. PHELPs's careful reading is, I take it, prett
much the juste milieu between the two; and I suspect most Englis
playgoers, who reverence the text, will on the whole acknowledge, his
reading to be the best ºf should like in certain scenes to see him
rather more impulsive, as befits the ‘fiery’ Moor; and at times he
somewhat mumbles in his utterance, through an over-straining of
emotional effect. But his conception on the whole is excellently ren-
dered, and fully shows that he º: the poetry of SHAKSPEARE,
and the grandeur of the part. Not being sentimental, his pathos is
most touching in its natural simplicity; instance s ecially the farewell
to his soldier's occupation, and the low voice and quivering lip with
which he sobs the answer ‘not a jot—not a jot:’ hº in the outbreaks
of his jealousy he gives the fullest utterance to the passion of the text,
without stooping to the vulgar rage and rant and roar, which the “great
actor’ MR. BRookE now vents in what the playbills call his ‘grand
impersonation.’ - -
‘In fine, having last night seen him vastly to his disadvantage, (for
MR. PHELPs, I am bound to say, is wretchedly supported-encum-
bered would indeed be a far more fitting word,) I think that his Othello is
decidedly worth seeing: and º who rail so scornfully at much.
abused ‘tradition” may learn from MR.P.HELPs that ‘tradition” has its
beauties, as well as its defects, and that to violate it needlessly is not
a proof of taste.
“I must just add, however, that, the Sadler's Wells Iago is by no
means to be cited as a sample of tradition, or to be commended for hi
boldness of departure from it. ... The actor rather seems to view it as a
semi-comic character: and in this light pit and gallery most cheerfully
accept it, and give him roars of laughter, and thunders of º
Now, though tradition, far, too much insists on fiendish scowls and
sneers, and such a devilish deportment as no one could assume and yet
be thought an ‘honest’ man, still the words Iago speaks, as set down
in the text, could not in any truth to nature proceed from such a person
as the Sadler's Wells Iago presumes himself to be. I lay stress on this
fact, because in general MR. PHELPs is careful in his cast; and as he
is the only good tragic actor left us. º: FECHTER is not British-born,

“M. FECHTER still continues to cram the house in Oxford Street;
and whatever be his failings (I shall write about them shortly, and
shall have to write at greater length, I think, of his good points) it
must at any rate be owned, that he has helped to bring down many a
dusty SHAKSPEARE from its shelf, and has revived the taste for some-
thing better than burlesque. Besides the shower of Othellos to which
I have referred, the play of Richard III. has been presented to the
public, and actually the little theatre in the Haymarket has seen the
tragic buskin on its Buckston E-trodden boards.
as Richelieu a night or two ago, and I own that I was not reminded of
MACREADY, who was the last actor I saw playing the part. MR. Booth
is young, and by study may improve: but folks will scarcely go to see
him merely for the reason that they went to see his father.
“It is odd to see what shifts the managers are put to by the dearth
of tragic actors, and the new-born taste for tragedy. At Drury Lane
MR. RoxBY has to do himself a violence and appear as Roderigo,
while the walking gentlemen who take the other characters are very
little better than a set of walking sticks. At the Haymarket, however,
a whole company of comedians have on a sudden to assume the bearing
of tragedians, and I need not say how ludicrous are the inevitable re-
sults. Merely from the bare association of ideas, the metamorphoses
effected are enough to make one smile; for when little MR. CLARKE stalks
on with tragic strut, one cannot well help thinking of him as a comic
waiter, so strongly is that image of him stamped on your mind's eye. It
must surprise your country readers to learn that tragedy is finding a home
here in the Haymarket, where they have often given vent to such bois-
terous guffaws; and Ifancy when the Cattle Show attracts them there
next month they will look for MR. BucksToNE to play the part of
Hamlet, while MR. CoMPTON acts the King, and MR. Rogers plays the
Ghost—the libretto of the tragedy explaining that this ‘shadow, since
his late retirement from the cares of kingly state, has led a very cosy,
comfortable life, and has thereby not unnaturally grown a little stout.
“ONE WHO PAYS.”
CLERICAL DESTITUTION.
THERE are snug things in the Church. Only look at this:–
HURCH PREFERMENT FOR EXCHANGE.-A RECTORY,
desirably situated within sight of the Sea, in an exceedingly picturesque ,
County; house, roomy and good; glebe, 82 acres of first-rate land. Income, well
B. over £400 a year. Population 215. No Meeting or Public House in the parish.
esired in EXCHANGE the NEXT PRESENTATION to a Rural Rectory, subject
to a life of not less than seventy. Income must not be less, nor population greater.
Age of applicant must not be less than forty. South or West of England preferred.
Variety is charming: Avida novitatis est gens humana, as the Eton
Latin grammar classically phrases it. Else one well might wonder that
a parson in possession of so snug a berth as this should feel any wish
to change it for one that might prove less so. For in the “rural rec.
tory” of which he is in search there might very likely be a pothouse or
a meeting-house, while in his present sea-side paradise it seems that he
has neither of these nuisances to harass him. Considering this, we are
surprised that he will swop for the same income as that which he now
has : for surely the relief to a well-constituted mind of knowing that
no drinking or dissenting folk live near one is worth what in the law is
called “consideration money,” and should as much enhance the value
of a clerical preferment as the absence of street-organs would the value
of a house. Moreover the advertiser clearly loves an easy life, or he
would not be so careful to guard himself against a larger population.
Over four hundred a year to cure a couple of hundred souls, as things
now go, we think, is pretty decent pay; and with a “good and roomy
house” in extremely pretty country, one might manage one would
fancy to live tolerably comfortable, even though one . to preach a
sermon once a week, and once a month or so go through the labour of
christening.

A FASHIONABLE Soap-monger incessantly exposes and advertises

to soap over juries? Or is it for washing what Lady Macbeth calls a
“filthy Witness”? We request an explanation, accompanied by a few
hundred pounds of the article against Friday next, which happens to

NURSLINGS OF THE WAVES.
ON Monday last week commenced the winter session of the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh, when an eloquent introductory address touching
science in general was delivered by Principal SIR DAVID BREwsTER.
Unfortunately the address of the learned Principal was, owing to the
construction of the hall in disregard of acoustics, very imperfectly
heard (the reporter tells us) by a large proportion of the audience.
Yes, this was very unfortunate. One of the accomplished lecturer's
sentences began thus:—“Considering the ocean but as the nursery of
the whale and its congeners.” These words having been very imper-
fectly heard by many of the listeners, were parti {". ed,
and some literal and stolid students present naturally understood SIR
DAVID BREWSTER to state that the ocean had been considered the
nursery of the whale and the conger eels.
BATHING FOR BEDLAMITES.
WE were surprised beyond measure on Wednesday morning last at
finding in the Times the following intelligence:–
“The bathing season in Hyde Park has now terminated.”
. This startling, information was conveyed in a short paragraph relat-
ing to the Royal Humane Society and setting forth, with other highly
interesting details, that—
“The number of bathers in the Serpentine, from the commencement of the
to the 3rd instant, was 71,356 in the mornings, and 296,943 in the evenings. *
| The number of attempted suicides was eight, of whom five were rescued, and the
remainder were not discovered in time to be saved.”
year
-
If we remember rightly, “the Serpentine was frozen over at the
commencement of the year,” and the temperature was somewhere in
the neighbourhood of zero: while on the evening of the third instant
there was a hard frost, and we should at either, period about as soon
have thought of blowing out our brains as of bathing in the Serpentine.
Tastes differ, it is true, but if we ever were caught bathing when the
glass was down to freezing point, we think whoever dragged us out
would be quite justified in fancying we were attempting suicide.
Clearly a Society which calls itself “ #." should do all within its
power to prevent half-witted persons from taking insane headers when
the snow is on the ground, and thereby catching in all likelihood cold,
ague, cramp, neuralgia, sore-throat, bronchitis, asthma, lumbago, cough,
and rheumatism, and half-a-dozen other highly disagreeable ailments,
proceeding from the chills which human flesh is heir to.
Implacable Jonatham.
It is impossible to please the Yankees. They are not satisfied with
our leaving them to themselves, and they also complain that we will
not stand a loan. No wonder that we do not cotton together, and it is
not likely we shall, so long as they continue to keep us out of cotton.

Unpleasant Symptoms.
WE are very unhappy about the Bishop-Maker. We are º
that the Noble Earl is going over to the Church of Rome. He has
been making a speech about the Essays and Rerieu's, and has assured
his working-class audience that the best way to be religious is to feel,
and not to try to understand. This is sad, from the Protestant SHAFTEs-
BURY. What else does every Popish priest tell his dupes? Will none
of the Earl’s own hierarchs call upon the Bishop-Maker, and feel his
theological pulse? We repeat—we are very uneasy.

A L’HOTEL DES TROIS EMPEREURS.
I WouldN'T be an Emperor
As Emperors are now,
For all their sceptres in my hand,
Their crowns upon my brow;
On the sword awhile grim fate may smile,
And Force may keep down Law
But, swords of Kings, those two edged things,
May pierce the hands that draw
There's Louis of France he leads the dance,
Of Despotism and Death,
But underground I hear a sound—
The pent fire's surging breath;
From the Tuileries to Saint Antoine,
There’s a broad street running through,
But the way you keep for the cannon's sweep,
May serve for the people too!
There’s Kaiser FRANz can bid advance
Five hundred thousand men,
On Hungarië or the Adrian Sea,
But will they come back again?
With a bankrupt purse, and two nations' curse,
To *: against e'en now ;
For twice five hundred thousand Imell,
I’d not be FRANz, I trow !
There's Russia's CzAR his Eagle far
O'er i. and swamp bids fly,
From the Baltic shore, to where Amoor
The Chinese wall goes by.
But with serfs and slaves and fools and knaves,
With his good and ill at war, -
For his wide domain, and as much again,
I would not be the CZAR!
For everywhere I seem to hear
Beneath Imperial thrones,
The stir and strife of sudden life;
Come back to the dry, dry bones,
With a force, whose heave, e'en thrones can cleave,
And rend, with sudden jar,
The iron bands, from out the hands
Of EMPROR, KAISER, CzAR!
THE HEALTH OF IRELAND.
THE serious attention of the medical men who have under their care
the body politic, is required by the questionable condition of Ireland. In
consequence of the abominable i. absurd American War, the tide of
ish emigration has ceased almost suddenly. Here, then, is a stoppage
of customary depletion, and that in the case of an individual is well
known to be very dangerous; likely to be followed by apoplexy,
paralysis, and all manner of inflammations and eruptions. According
to analogy, Ireland ought to have a yiolent attack of agitation; but
.. few parallels run quite on all-fours, and perhaps the political
health of Ireland may fortunately suffer no disturbance from the arrest
of that process by which such quantities of noxious materials were con-
tinually exported from her system.
FASHIONS FOR NOWEMBER.
(From Le Wisdom.)
AN entirely new fashion has been introduced by ladies who are justly
entitled, to be looked up to as models. It has obtained the most un-
bounded º from gentlemen, who have the happiness to be
fathers or husbands. It consists of the dresses which were purchased
last winter, and which, having been carefully put away, come out with
all the advantages of novelty and economy. Some leaders of the fashion
have gone so far as to place in the Savings' Bank the money which new
dresses would have cost, but this habit is at present confined to ladies
of the most exquisite taste and judgment. So graceful and well fitting
a habit will, however, it is prognosticated, have many imitators.
Literary Intelligence.
Gover NMENT is said to have decided that all the beasts shall be
turned out of the British Museum. This is good news for the Reading-
Room, which is still disturbed by persons who, in defiance of PANIzzi
and politeness, continue to chatter together.
MATHEMATICS FOR PRACTICAL MEN.
THEOREM I.—A Chord having been struck by inclination, a Charming
h'idow and an impressible Proctor will be united.
IET AIP be an Fº Proctor; A cºw, a Charming Widow;
and Tw D, the Will of the Departed. Let A t c be a Tender Chord
passing through AIF; then, if Acw he inclined, to A1 P, the former
will strike ATC, and AJ P and Acw will be united. This is assuming,
by way of postulate, that, the expectations of A 1 P coincide with the
provisions of T W D,-the Will which is to be proved.
THEOREM II.-The mental elevation of an Eminent Tragedian is equal to
the difference between two lines, the base and the perpendicular.
Let or be a Theatrical Manager, and M E the Mental Elevation of
A ET, an Eminent Tragedian. Then from the managerial authority of
QP let a base-line, be extended to A E T; call it s P, the Sternly
Parental or heavy line. Then let a lofty or perpendicular line come
from AET, to o f ; call it ER, or line of Epistolary Remonstrance,
thus:– “Sir, I spurn your heavy Fathers, and aspire to Royalty—
Henry the Sirth" or Eighth, Claudius, or King Lear. Yours di
obediently, FITZ-Roy.” The mental elevation of AET may be obtained
by measuring the liness P and E R, it being by construction equivalent
to the difference between the base and the perpendicular.
THEOREM III.-The miseries of a Circle from which a Beautiful Coquette
flies off at a Tangent.
Let, A R or be a Rich Old Flatterer, and A B g a Beautiful Coquette
ound. A B C describe a circle P D w, Poor Devoted Worshippers,
Then, if a parallel be drawn by A B C between A R or and P Dw, it wi
be found that A B C will cut PD w, and A R or and A B c will be united.
But if A H Yo be a Handsome Young Officer, and a parallel be drawn
between A R or and A Hyo, it will be seen that A B C will fly off at a
tangent from A R O F, and PD w and A R o F in one point—that of un-
mitigated misery—are equal.
THEOREM IV.-A Melodious Policeman in the area of a Square,
demonstrates the Charms of Music and the Force.
Let A M P be a Melodious Policeman, and AF s a Fashionable Square,
on one side of which is As C, a Soft Cook. Then if A M P be inclined to
As C, they will be found to meet in the area of the square.
THEOREM. W.-Solution of the Perata Quaestio in reference to
Bodies moving in Space.
Let P F be the Plain Figure of a Fine Lady at the Court of the
Prince Regent, and M B the circumference of a Modern Belle. Then
from Ac, the Acute Angle of the eye of a Candid Critic, let attention
be drawn to LB, the Line of Beauty, and LB will be found to reach
considerably beyond P F, the Plain Figure, though undoubtedly within
MB, the Circumference of the Belle.
Corollary.—For practical
equivalent to that
and the big drum.
º ses the difference may be reckoned as
etween the hoops of two drums, viz., the fig-drum
A VERY FINE FRENZY.
“INDIGNATION makes verses,” says the old proverb, but indignation
must make better ones than those of a correspondent of Mr. Punch's.
The poet is in such a rage with any person who does not assist, by
subscription, MR. HALLIwell's most praiseworthy plan for preserving
the Shakspeare Gardens to the nation, that he breaks out into savage
verse which he wants us to print. He begins-
“The wretch who won’t subscribe to Shakspeare's Garden
Is a vile toad who is not worth a farden:
May all his gardens be o'er-run with slugs,
His house with cousins, and his beds
[No, really, we cannot print any more. We share his indignation,
but do not admire its expression. Nevertheless, we urge everybody
to send his money to MR. HALLIWELL.]
No Popery :
(A Joke made on Guy Fawkes' Day.)
PAM says that it is to please the Roman Catholic population of
Canada that he has sent out, as Governor-General, a MONck. He a
that this bad excuse is better than nun. Really, the joke's as objec-
tionable as the appointment, and that is saying a good deal, as will be
found out one of these days. -

GARIBALDI’S HEADPIECE.
THE certainty that GARIBALDI has a head upon his shoulders is no doubt extremel
vexatious, to the Continental Absolutists, and perhaps even to some of their Britis
friends, who would like to decapitate him. Anything by which they are forcibly re-
minded of that incontrovertible fact must exceedingly annoy them, and therefore we
have much pleasure in , drawing, their attention to a statement contained in the
Monarchia Nazionale, which not only evidences the existence of a head on the shoulders
of GARIBALDI, but also proves that it has been put on the right way. The Ex-KING
of NAPLEs, the ex-Dukes of the Italian States, the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA, the Pope,
and the MARQUIs of Norman BY, will be enraged to hear that:-
“GENERAL TURR has announced to the Central Committee, in the name of GAR1BALDI, that it
is the firm intention of the latter not to provoke any movement in favour of Rome and Venice; and
that his sole wish is that every means may be employed to promote the armament of the nation.”
The Roman pear, according to our friend Louis NAPOLEoN, is not ripe yet; when
it shall have attained to maturity it will fall of itself. The soundness of this Napo.
leonic idea may be questioned, for that of the pear itself is disputable, appearances
strongly indicating that the Roman pear is not only ripe but rotten. #owever, there
hangs the pear, for the present, on the tree which enlightened France, by means of
GENERAL § and ten thousand bayonets, prevents its natural Pºlº from
shaking. But a day must come when the sleepy old pear will fall at last. In the
meanwhile the ſº that might produce a fresh pear is liable to be nipped, and at
least has no claim to be permitted to expand. The Sovereign Pontiff pear, still pendent,
hangs by prescription, }. any future specimen of that fruit which the gardeners
of the Sacred College may think of growing in its place, they will attempt to develope
against the will of their masters the Italian people....They will be justly entitled to
cultivate a pontifical pear for themselves, but they will have no right to impose a pear
corresponding to a King Pippin on the nation of which they are not the representa-
tives. £nlightened France is under no obligation to protect any future pear, and will
of course immediately retire from the orchard, and leave the pear-tree, in the rightful
possession of Italy; if of an armed Italy, then of an Italy that will hold the tree
fast against all comers. By that time, the Venetian
pear also will probably be ripe for plucking. This opera-
tion may require an amount of force which Italian men
will be enabled to wield by taking, and only by taking,
GARIBALDI's judicious advice, keeping quiet, biding their
time, and in the meanwhile employing every means “to
promote the armament of the nation.”

ARMY PREPARATION.
THE assertion has been made that, British officers are sometimes
sadly ignorant of English, and can hardly write six words without bad
grammar or bad spelling in them. Whether this be their own fault, or
the fault of their schoolmasters, it would be no easy matter to deter-
mine; but that their, teachers are occasionally careless in their lan-
- #. a glance at the Times newspaper will very often show. Here
for instance is a sample, which we extract at random from a score of
such advertisements, which daily are addressed to future Wellingtons
and Napiers, whose education for the army is at present incomplete.—
PREPARATIQN for the Army, Woolwich, and Sandhurst.—A married
officer, late of Her Majesty's Royal Artillery, whose pupils have invariably
ssed their examinations with very great credit, Rºvé. as members of his
amily, FOUR YOUNG GENTLEMEN, to prepare for their respective destinations,
and, º a scientific course of instruction, render them efficient officers and eligible
to hold staff appointments. References of the highest respectability and most
satisfactory testimonials are offered. Address R. A., &c.
If ...R.A.” has a dictionary, and will, take the trouble to refer to it,
he will discover that “prepare”, has the letters “v. a.” put with it,
implying (he knows doubtless) that it is an active verb. Being such
it requires an accusative case after it, and therefore the word “them.”
ought to be supplied. Whether among his testimonials “R.A.” have
one to testify his knowledge of good English, is a matter for the parents
of his pupils to inquire; but if grammar be embraced in his “scientific
course,” we really t the less they learn of it from him, the more
eligible will his young gentlemen be for staff appointments; albeit such
appointments may not require such perfect mastery of English as is
required of men appointed on Mr. Punch's staff.
. From the same day's Times we take another sample of bad language,
in which these military teachers far too frequently indulge:–
ARMY EXAMINATIONS.—A Clergyman, M.A., RECEIVES and
PREPARES CANDIDATES for direct appointments in Her Majesty's Service.
Lately he has passed many at first trial; several after a few weeks' preparation.
He takes only a few, and teaches all the subjects himself, thus insuring their
pºssing. , Late beginners and those backward in study rapidly and efficiently
advanced. References to noblemen, officers, &c.
From his clumsy style of yº; one might fancy that this clergyman
not merely prepared pupils but himself examined them; for he states
that he has lately “passed many at first trial,” whereas really he has
done no more than help them to be passed. His next sentence is even
have stirred the
still more awkwardly constructed; for when he tells us that he “teaches
all the subjects himself, thus insuring their passing,” by all the rules
of grammar we are bound to understand that it is the “subjects.”
. passing he insures, and this is very obviously by no means his
IIllent.
No doubt it will be urged that no one cares a jot how an advertise-
ment be written, so long as what is meant be comprehensible and plain.
But it is just as easy for an educated man to use good English when he
writes as it is to scribble bad; and when we see, such careless slipslop
as that which we have quoted, we are tempted to the inference either
that the writer is ignorant of grammar, or that he is too lazy to write
à his ºniºmas. and so lets them be concocted by his shoe-boy
Or ills COOK.
CHANGE FOR PETERS PENCE,
His Holiness the Pope, notwithstanding the quantities of bitterness
which he has continually to swallow, and the lacerations which his
paternal heart is always undergoing, enjoys, nevertheless, no small
consolation in the shape of jº. and the state which those
eleemosynary coppers enable him to maintain. For example, his Holi-
|ness, the other #. according to intelligence received from Rome,
went to dine with the Benedictine monks at the monastery of St. Paul,
ertramuros, where military honours were rendered him by four companies
of Papal Zouaves and half a battery of artillery, and :-
“Eight cardinals, three French generals, numbers of ministers, prelates, monks,
colonels of gendarmes and Zouaves, and other ecclesiastical and lay guests, had the
honour of dining with his Holiness, and of listening after the repast, to a hymn in
the Pontiff's honour, sung by 200 youths, to each of whom the Pope subsequently
É.i.a. : medal, with his own portrait on one side, and that of the WIRGIN MARY
on the other.”
The honour which his Holiness did himself in issuing a medal thus
stamped indicates a feature which pictures of Roman Pontiffs represent
most of them as largely endowed with-cheek. He can affºrd some
ostentation by means of Peter's pence º: into silver. He is not
then so badly off. Come, the Pope he does lead a lº. life after all.
Far from not knowing where to lay his head or to find a meal, his
Holiness seems to enjoy himself pretty much after the fashion of the
LoRD MAYOR of London, with the occasional addition of having a
hymn sung in his honour by two hundred choristers, wherein Pio NoNo
has the advantage of CUBITT. -
It may here be remarked that there exists a certain analogy between
the Civic Monarch and the Sovereign Pontiff. Both are elective sove-
reigns: but the LoRD MAYoR is elected . the Livery, who represent
the City of London, whereas the Pope is chosen by the Cardinals, who
represent only the Romish Priesthood. Moreover the Pope not only
|. Rome, but claims to rule the adjoining states now part of the
º of Italy. The LoRD MAYOR, however, confines his ambition
within the limits of the City, and does not also pretend to reign over
the metropolitan counties.
| Undoubtedly the resemblance between the Pope and the LORD MAYOR
is infinitely closer than another which has been suggested. CARDINAL
BEDINI, Archbishop of Viterbo and Toscanella, recently invested with
red wideawake and stockings, in a pastoral letter addressed to his
diocesans on the institution amongst them of a Pious Confraternity ºf
the obolus of St. Peter, or society for the circumvection of the Triple
the obolus, proceeds to institute that other comparison. In the words
| of our informant:—
... “His Eminence goes on to compare these gifts to the offerings of the wise men of
the East to our Redeemer, ‘whose example is so well followed by his, Vicar on
earth,’ and winds up by inviting his flock to follow likewise the faithful star,
which, represented by the pious association, invites them like the Magi, to place
; tribute at the feet of the persecuted Man-God (ai piedi del perseguitato Uom-
Dio..)”
The banquet which the Holy Father enjoyed at the monastery of St.
Paul certainly appears rather to find a parallel in the festival of the
Ninth of November than that of any other memorable day. The like-
ness between the Magi or wise men of the east and the subscribers of
Peter's pence, alleged by CARDINAL BEDINI, is also very questionable;
for the latter º: truly said to differ as well from wise men as from
Magi in the essential particular of being no conjurors, inasmuch as they
must necessarily belong to a class of persons who are proverbially said
to be expeditious in parting with their money.
Sarcasm.
IN the Cornhill Magazine is an article called A Week's Imprisonment
in Sark. A Scotch friend writes to us to say that he can sympathise
with the writer, for his own laundress has stolen all his night-gowns.

MINIMISED MUSIC.
Not in any way connected with LoRD BAcox's Novum
Organon, a new organ has been patented bearing the new
title of the “Minima Organ.” Among other good qualities,
it is said to have “ great com ass,” notwithstanding its
small size, and such “power of expression” and “sweet-
ness of tone,” as must subdue and mollify the sourest of
the critics. Moreover, it is very “delicately voiced,” and
although intended chiefly, of course, to please the ear, it
is not devoid of ocular attractions; for like a gent in a
police-court, it has an “elegant exterior,” and nobody
who makes its acquaintance, can deny that there certainly
is something of the Swell about it. Its chief excellence,
however, is its marked econºmy of space as well as post
and the saving it effects will doubtless, highly recommend
it * people with small parlours and purses made to
match.
This much we have learnt from a description of the organ
which the Times and Morning Post, and several other organs
of opinion, have supplied. All that we would addis, that
if what is said be true, we trust that the street organists
will soon be furnished with these organs, instead of the
old cracked-voiced squeaking instruments of torture where-
with they have been, hitherto permitted to torment us.
To victims like ourselves, who unhappily are gifted with a
odear for good music (and therefore suffer aural martyr-
; of course, when hearing bad), it would be a great relief
lieu of the shrill harshness wherewith they now afflict us;
and if they were made more “delicately voiced,” we should
be less apt to consider them a nuisance. We wish then
that some affluent and charitable people would get up, a
society to furnish these new organs to the grinders in the
streets, and give them some instruction so to º upon
the “Minima,” that they may extract a minimum of noise
from it. Of street organs we may say that the less they’re
heard the better; and for such purpose the “Minima”
seems evidently fit, as of all organs its name implies that
it must be the least, We are ever willing to encourage
ood inventions; and as these small organs must be suited
or small parties, we grant hereby our gracious permission
to their maker to forward us a dozen as a present to our
little ones, who, not being like the Minimas, at all “deli-
cately voiced.”"would doubtless shriek and shout their
shrillest at the sight of such nice playthings, i.e., things
whereon to play.
OUR FEMALE IRONSIDES.
CRINoLINE is now assuming proportions which can only be correctl
described as Cyclopean. It has taken a position as an article of .
ware on a gigantic scale. What it has come to will be terrifically
obvious from the subjoined advertisement, cut out of the Sheffield In-
dependent :-
WANTED, a Cold CRINOLINE ROLLER, to work six
None but first-rate Workmen and steady men will be engaged.

irs of Rolls.
Apply to W.
Sheffield is the only place where the manufacture of Crinoline is
º now that the forges of Etna have ceased working. When
ulcan forged the bolts of Jove, he little dreamt of being called upon
to forge the petticoats of Venus. As the husband of that goddess, he
would have objected to her wearing steel petticoats, and in his capacity
of blacksmith would at least have declined to make them. Wanted, at
an Iron and Steel Works, “a Cold Crinoline Roller.” What monstrous
engine is that which the Cold Crinoline Roller has to manage; of
how many horse-power to work six pairs of Rolls? One, evidently,
whose tremendous powers can only be trusted in the hands of a
first-rate workman and a steady man. Fº the iron clang attend-
ant ºn the obstinate resistance offered by the gold hard Crinoline to the
forcible operation of rolling. In its previous hot stage, glowing red on
the stithy, Crinoline must present a sight of appalling splendour. Ho!
ho! how the sparks must flash and fly from the ruddy ribs of steel
under the thumps of the contemporary TUBAL-CAIN, or more probably,
the strokes of the NASMyth steam-hammer!
We have now both steel clad men of war and steel-clad women, and
the same powerful machinery as that required for plating a vessel seems
necessary to case the female sex in mail. Our steam rams walk the
waters, or ought to do so by this time; and perhaps we shall soon
have steam ewes, so to speak, walking the thoroughfares in armour
and running the unfortunate º down. The maidens of Englan
will be so strongly fortified that they will be susceptible of no impres-
sion from any force under that of an ARMSTRONG gun. They are already
coming it a good deal too strong in their steel casings, and carryi
more metal than what a reasonable man would willingly take in tow.
The rolls of cold Crinoline with which they encircle themselves are anº
º and an inconvenience against which it is much, to be wished
that an application to the MASTER of THE ROLLs could procure an
injunction.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
ST. DISRAELI iTO THE RESCUE.
O the º; Author of
the Infernal Marriage
Irion in Heaven, an
other theological works
§: we name, MR.
ISRAELI), , has been
delivering, before the
Bishop of OxFORD, and
all sorts of Archdeacons,
a speech on Church
Matters. It was an ex-
tremely clever and effec-
tive performance, and
the lay orator walked
into the Essays and Re-
views with a far more
smashing criticism than
Mr. Punch has seen put
forth by any of the cle-
rical assailants of the
book, the Bishop-maker
included. . This part of
the º is so good
that Mr. Punch (who,
from circumstances over
which he has no control,
is infrequently permit:
ted, the satisfaction of
applauding MR. Dis-
RAELI) inclines to im-
mortalise a few of his
sentences. After de-
claring his belief that
the principal Authors
of the Essays had en-
scheme of the interpretation of the Scriptures a new scheme called the
Mythical system. But if it be true, which undoubtedly it is, that the
mythical theologians triumphantly demonstrated that rationalism
was irrational, equally true is it that by this time the mythical system
has itself become a myth. (Cheers and laughter.) The most eminent
and most distinguished votaries of that school have enlisted their
energies and devoted their powers to a new and all-triumphant deve-
lopement of German theology, which is now raging in that country,
and which, in deference to the spirit of progress, which is the charac-
teristic, as we are told, of the nineteenth century, and which generally
ends in a recurrence to ancient ideas—(cheers and laughter)—this new
system consists in a most able revival of pagan pantheism. (Cheers.)
ow, that is a º true sketch of the various phases through
which the most intellectual opinion of Germany during the last
century has . (Hear, hear.) I ask you, is the Church to be
alarmed by such overreaching and capricious speculations as these?
(hear)—and is society to be disturbed by a volume which is after all
but a secondhand medley of these discordant, inconsistent, and self-
destroying theories? No religious creed was ever dest ed by a phi-
losophical theory. Philosophies destroy themselves. EPICURUs was
at least as great a man, I apprehend, as HEGEL, yet it was not EPI-
cuRUs that subverted the Olympian religion.”
So far, Mr. Punch has nothing but praise for his friend
MR. DISRAELI. He speaks like a scholar and an orator,
But on the other points on which it pleased the author of
Coningsby to champion the Church, Mr. Punch is by no
means so sure that the respected Lady will do well to
follow MR, DISRAELI's advice. He certainly recommended
Unity, which is a very good thing in its way, but his coun-
sel to the clergy to stand shoulder to shoulder, and take
theological matters out of the hands of laymen, may not be
quite so rudent, in º: when it is really only a question
of “worth while” whether LORD PALMERSTON shall écraser
the Parsons' Parliament, Convocation, or not. And upon
the Church Rate Question, Mr. Punch submits that if the
Church should take the ground recommended by the author
of Tancred, and go in for the Rate in all its integrity and
accept no compromise, ARCHBIshop PUNCH foresees great
trouble in his º In fact the counsel of MR.
DISRAELI will exactly do what he said the Societies he was
addressing did—it will “Form one great whole"—in which
hole the Church will find itself. However, we will talk over

SABBATARIAN ESPIONAGE.
ON Monday last week, according to a police report at Hammersmith,
“MRs. SARAH STARBUCK, the landlady of the Cannon public-house, Queen Street,
Hammersmith, was summoned before MR. DAYMAN to answer the complaint of the
. for having her house open on Sunday morning, the 3rd inst., before one
o'clock.”
This charge was supported by the solitary evidence of a spy:—
“The †. witness in this case was Police Constable WooDBRIDGE of the J Division
a plain clothes officer of Notting Hill. On the Sunday in question he was employed
especially in the district of Hammersmith to watch º public-houses.”
Police-Constable WooDBRIDGE swore that—
“He saw thirteen men in the parlour or tap-room and ten men at the bar. This
was about half-past twelve o'clock. The door opened in consequence of a knock
from the outside, and he attempted to pass in, but was prevented. Though he
stated that he was a constable and showed his card, he was pushed out. He swore
that he succeeded in getting one leg and his head inside the door, and that in the
struggle he was able to count the men in the parlour and at the bar. He also saw
a man drinking from a pot full of beer.”
All these allegations Police-Constable WooDBRIDGE deposed; and
on his solemn oath—
“He further stated that he remained outside until one o'clock, and that he saw
some of the same men come out of a private house in Ship Lane, a thoroughfare
running on the side of the public-house.”
Police-Constable WooDBRIDGE having made the above statements
under the obligation acknowledged by kissing the Book, was then |}
cross-examined by MR. MARTIN, and—
“Admitted that Mr. ARNoLD, on the ground that he did not believe the evidence,
...]:a similar complaint against another licensed victualler in Hammersmith
on Saturday.”
In contradiction of every word which the spy, Police-Constable
WooDBRIDGE had sworn, three witnesses were ed.
“They swore that there were only three persons in the house at the time referred
to, namely, MRs. STARBUck, the potman, who was placing his cans in the bar, and a
man who had returned a ladder he had borrowed. They also proved that there was
no outlet at the back, as the yard was surrounded by the walls of adjoining houses,
and that there were no windows or doors through which any man could leave. It
was denied that the constable showed his card."
Moreover—
“Inspector HARE said that he visited the house, accompanied by a constable, a
quarter of an hour before, and that he found no men there.”
Under these circumstances it was evident that Police-Constable
WooDBRIDGE had sworn to things which he had either dreamt or
invented, and—
“MR. DAYMAN said it was an extraordinary case, and dismissed the summons."
Of course the summons was dismissed—and perhaps an inquiry is
now pending, to ascertain whether Police-Constable and, Spy WooD-
BRIDGE is a dreamer of dreams, or a deponent of things which are not.
Under favour of the Magistrate, this was not altogether a very extra;
ordinary case. By WooDBRIDGE's own showing a similar case had
occurred on Saturday. Policemen in plain clothes appear to be not
uncommonly employed to watch public houses on Sundays. It is not
unusual for them to inform against publicans for keeping open house at
unlawful hours. Nor does it not occasionally happen that an intelligent
stipendiary Magistrate like MR. DAYMAN as contradistinguished from
an unpaid old Sabbatarian blockhead of a Country Justice, dismisses the
information, doubting the informant's evidence.
By many a County quorum of 'squires and parsons, and by many A
theocracy of municipal Mawworms on a borough bench, every.word
that a police spy and informer had the audacity to swear against a
ublican ...? of a breach of the Sunday laws, would be believed in
the face of any number of witnesses. MRs. STARBUCK, our hostess of
the Cannon, may rejoice in hanging out that warlike sign under the
reign of constitutional legality in free Hammersmith. - -
t cannot be under orders from the Home Office that policemen dis;
guised in plain clothes sneak about as spies commissioned to catch,9ut
publicans in infringing a sectarian Act of Parliament, and for that
urpose themselves tempt them to infringe it by opening their
É. Will the Government a moment longer encourage, the fellows
to bear false witness against their neighbours on trumped-up charges
of profaning the so-called Sabbath day?

would do if they had their way. hat? . They would like a Military
College, to be conducted on the system of a-what?—a Seminary for

their meals off wooden trenchers, bread and scrape and skyblue for

CURIOUS PERSONS TO MEET.
SoME of the ornaments
that were distributed about
the Guildhall on the occa-
sion of the Lord Mayor's
dinner, struck us as being
somewhat out of good taste.
We might have expected
them at an Egyptian feast
which was generally preside
over by a grim skeleton, but
we must say they were a
little de trop at a festivity,
where everything was sup-
pººl to have the holiday
ook of good nature and
good cheer. For instance,
there were assembled to-
gether a statue of Melan-
choly, as well as a bust of
the Mournful Girl; and as
though that was not #.
there was also liberally
thrown in (for the purpose,
we suppose, of keeping
them in countenance; or it
may have been the effect
produced by their depress-
ling: º a bust of the
eeping Girl! This was a
little too much of the lachrymose order. Whilst they were about it, why
didn't they have a couple of mutes at the door?. It was a sombre com-
pliment to the principal guest of the evening. . It must have been about
the first time that PALMERSTON and Melancholy ever met together under
the same roof, though as for that his Lordship must have been equally
surprised to have found in his presence a Mournful Girl, much less one
(proh pudor!), who was Weeping / Of course, such was the effect of
his riant society, that Melancholy was found, long before the evening
was over, to have been turned into mirth of the most uproarious
description; whilst of the two sorrow-stricken girls, the one, who
had been nourning, was unquestionably discovere
of broad grills, and the other, who had lately been left weeping, was

ALBINA DI RhonA. This sprightly piquant dancer has succeeded to
the throne where once Miss KELLY held her court, and the boards
long-trodden only by aspiring amateurs now throb beneath the buskins
of the regular professionals. Atar Gull, her opening piece, has no
great nominal attraction: and, to judge by what one hears, the plot is
not much more attractive than łł. title. So I shall let the Gull fly
off before I pay my visit: and then I hope to see Miss RHQNA's spark-
ing eyes, and lissome twinkling legs, without having to sit through a
pre º of bad melo-drama, for which she would be wise to substitute
good larce.
“These two last words remind me to notice MR. Robson’s return to
the Olympic: improved, I hope sincerely for a permanence, in health.
Absurdly farcical and funny, A Legal Impediment, just ſits him with
one of those quaint bits of low-life character, of which his handering
Minstrel was his first, and best example. In these parts MR. Robson
is utterly unriyalled, indeed in other hands, they would quite fail of
their effect. Men with bilious minds may call his acting mere buffoon-
ery, but I'll defy them to help, laughing at his ever-varying oddities;
and with all his aped "...; he is never coarse. It really puzzles
one to fancy how he keeps his, countenance while making, up his
face; and yet one feels convinced, he must have practised with a look-
ing-glass, in º: those stolid, blank and puzzled looks, those
fl. of sly, dry humour, and those wondrous cunning winks. A good
augh, we all know, is a good thing for the digestion; and any one
who has a spare hour after dinner, and wants to exercise the muscles
that are used in cachinnation, had better go and join the nightly roar at
MR. Robson, which is now excited by his character of Sl-hush.
“The PYNE and HARRIsoN régime has recommenced at Covent

should be general: but Nº. are highly conservative of nuisances,
and common sense as yet is confined in the above point to this house

attraction, and I hope she will not weaken it by her over-work. Ruy
Blas six nights a week was enough to kill a GRISI. I can't say it sur:
prised me when this opera was withdrawn. Although well, mounted
and well sung there was great heaviness about it, partly owing to the
sombre nature of the plot. I doubt if making operas out of plays be a
wise course, at any rate for English composers to adopt., Our actors
as a rule act better than our singers: and when one has seen M.
FEchTER in a part, one can't help somewhat missing his pregnant
point and polish, however well the character be played by his suc-
CeSSOr. -
“Stage Managers have had enough to do the last few days: for, in-
cluding Sadler's Wells and the ‘New Royalty” in Dean Street, at no
less than six theatres have new pieces been produced, and when the

stage slang says “the provinces,” I never yet could learn), MR, Buck-

original and more amusing personage. The play which introduces him

stage before has showed them ºli go and have a laugh at MR.
SotherN's Lord Dundreary. A double eyeglassed dandy, with dyed whis:
kers, which he paws and throws over his shoulder, who does not drawl
his words, but speaks them somewhat through his nose, and with a stutter
and a lisp, may not seem a very novel or attractive sort of character,
but, as MR. SoTHERN plays it, really it is both. For quaint, and quiet
humour, nothing can excel his vacuous solemnity, and the empty-
headed stare wherewith, he ponders on what, puzzles him: while his

very droll. Of course nobody in life has ever seen a Lord Dundreary,
thinking every one a lunatic except his brainless self; yet his attitudes
are natural, and his humour new and fresh: while, despite of all his
unny and fantastic caricaturin , there is a something true to nature in
his almost every touch. Our American Cousin has but little else attrac-

must have been drugged; for when he “comesto,” it is evening, and the Strangers
are all gone, and so, he finds, is everything of value he had with him. Such
sharping tricks as these are as stale as last month's muffins, and one wonders
how such donkeys can be found as are still duped by them, Indeed, we really
can scarce pump up any pity for these asses; for if they read the newspaper (and
who .#. does not?) they must know what is coming when they get into
such company, and it is their own fault if they are fools enough to stay in it. ...
But another kind of sharping, is now pretty largely practised, to which police
attention has not so much been drawn, and we may therefore do some Service by
helping to expose it. Headed in big type “How To GET AGENTEEL, LIVING,
or “A FoETUNE FOR FIVE SHILLINGs,” or “Do You want To LISE, A
ThousAND POUNPs A YEAR::" advertisements are constantly inserted in the
Fº benevolently offering these boons to any “party” who applies (by letter
only, with six stamps for a reply) at an under-named address. Occupation being
promised to persons of both sexes, it is not surprising that poor ladies are
entrapped into sending the six stamps; in return for which they sometimes, are
favoured with a letter, stating that the advertiser requires ten shillings more, either
as a fee for entering their names, or as a “security for the first employment
sent.” This latter phrase appeared in a letter which was read the other, day, in a
police-court, in which the “lucrative engagement” that was offered by the adver;
tiser was revealed to be three hours of needlework per day for a “large commercial
house” (no name given) in Berlin. ... By this genteel occupation the advertiser
stated that upwards of a hundred ladies in his employ realised as much as forty
shillings in a week, a prospect surely quite sufficient to induce a genteel needle-
woman to send off the ten i. “by stamps or post-office order,” and await the
“articles” which were to be sent. After waiting, say, a week or so, and hearing
nothing further, she might think it worth her while to call at the address to
which her stamps had been directed, and then the chances are that she will, make
some such discovery as was made in the police case to which we have referred:-
“The applicant said that he had been to the address given and found it to be a small tobacco-
nist's shop. All the person who keeps the shop could tell of MR. GRAHAM was, that he called
at her shop some days ago, purchased half an ounce of tobacco, and requested her to take in some
letters for him addressed there. She ed to do so, but they came in such quantities that
she became alarmed and refused to receive any more. MR. GRAHAM she described as a shabby-
looking young man, who smoked a short Fº and walked about in the neighbourhood of her
shop, awaiting such letters as came, and then took possession of them. The applicant thought
the whole affair a gross attempt to swindle, and his object in coming before the Court was that
it might be exposed in such a way as to prevent industrious and deserving persons from being
imposed on by a worthless impostor. The press had done much to protect the public in such
cases, and if its representatives present would kindly notice the matter, he had no doubt it
would have the desired effect.”
To expose a ..º.º. and to smash a swindling scamp, is a duty. to
society that Punch never shrink from: and if “MR. GRAILAM” will oblige
him, with his photograph, it shall be copied in these pa
as the portrait of a scoundrel who lives by telling lies, .
cheating honest people who are in want ºwork. The fact
that “MR. GRAHAM,” and of his breed, aim mainly
to impose upon poor, weak and struggling women, who
would eke out a small income by their own honest hand-
work, adds a number of degrees to the hot wrath of
Mr. Punch; and as he is at times of an irritable tempera-
ment, the chances are, that if he catches any “shabby
looking’ gent coming out of a tobacconist's with a short
pipe and lots of letters, he pounce upon the “party.”
as an advertising swindler, and will kick him all the way
to the most distant of police courts, and there leave him
to be dealt with as the law directs.

A PIECE OF ADVICE.
At the last, theatrical representation ſº before the
EMPEROR at Compiègne, we notice that the title of one of
the pieces was L’Argent fait. Peur. If the argent is
wanting, of course, it does frighten one, and a deficit of
100,000,000 francs, which is as much as France for the
moment acknowledges to, is more than enough to make
the boldest quake with fear. This may be the kind of peur
that has caused the present French financial crisis, and
necessitated the appointment of M. Fould as Minister of
the Finances. If the above vaudeville was accidentally
selected, it was at all events a piece of advice very oppor-
tunely given. Let us hope that M. Fould's success, as
the French Chancellor of the Exchequer, empty as the
latter at present may be, may soon have the º effect of
one species of fear being promptly succeeded by another
of a more cheerful character, viz.:-the one elicited in
MADAME DE GIRARDIN’s beautiful little piece of La Joie
fait Peur.. That joy, when it does come, may make France
more careful for the future as to the way in which she
spends her money. Where is the fun, or profit, of buildin
fine houses (and Paris, will soon be a capital of nearly a
#. lºve) if there is nothing but empty cupboards in
CIn
Debilitas in Profundis.
A “CITY article” says,
“Wague rumours have been in circulation the last two days of
another difficulty in connection with the tallow market.”
A dreadful idiot writes to us that these are wicked
rumours, and have simply arisen from the remark of an
eminent City man at Brighton last week, that BRILL's bath
is so thronged that there is no getting a dip. We are
really ashamed to print such rubbish.

a Line, we beg leave to say, is, par etcellence
the "fine of Beauty;” only look as we will
over the railway map of England, where are
we to find it?
MANIACS AND THEIR MONEY.
THERE are people in the world who nave either so much money that
they don't know what to do with it, or else are so silly that they fool
away large sums without doing good to anybody, not even to them-
selves. One of either of these sorts appears to be the person whºse
initials are subjoined, his modesty preventing the insertion of his
name :-
HE Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt AC-
KNOWLEDGE the RFCEIPT, from A. P. O., of BANK of ENGLAND NOTES
for £200, to be applied in reduction of the National Debt.
Of course the Nation ought to feel enormously º to any one
who helps it in paying, off its debts; but what appreciable good to any
single human . the payment of these notes for £200 will do, is a
problem, that would pose the calculation of a Cogs ER, and bewilder
even a BABBAGE in endeavouring to solve. Had A. P. O. selected some
deserving person (say, for instance, Mr. Punch), and sent him the £200
some good would have been done, and Mr. Punch would have been proud
to hand down to posterity the Christian names and surname for which
those initials stand. , Let this delicate hint be taken in cases of this
sort; and, when people are distressed with a pecuniary plethora, let them
send the surplus which afflicts them to the Punch Office, and so earn the
lasting gratitude of at least one individual, instead of benefiting nobody,
and being laughed at more than thanked.
The same course might be followed with quite obvious advantage by
persons who send Conscience-money into the Exchequer; and who,
if they would only forward, it to Fleet Street, would not, as they
now do, bring the nation to disgrace. As it is, the CHANGELLQR must
Pyblicly acknowledge the receipt of what they sendi, and as the term
Conscience-money” implies a previous course of cheating for which
ents are proofs of what great rogues
it may atone, these acknowled -
elt
there are among us, whereas that fact, might be kept secret if
“Conscience” sums went privately to Mr. Punch's purse.
. Mr. Punch of course is much too pure a patriot to dream of benefit-
ing himself at the expense of his loved country; and he would have
; this gold pen sooner than suggest what he has done, if he fancied
the Nation would in any whit be . by it. But the few hundreds
a-year which are flung into the Exchequer by these conscience-smitten
reprobates do no good to the country that is worthy to be named:
whereas Mr. Punch would find them vastly handy, if only to defray
the cost of his cigars, and it is difficult to say how much the Nation
would be gainer if his thought-giving tobacco were of limitless
expense.
ARITHMETIC AMONGST THE ADVERTISEMENTS.
WE see a book is advertised under the title of, Thé, Malley ºf...a
Hundred Fires. We think it is ridiculous to give the British Public
such unnecessary information. Since every advertisement reader
knows that it is possible, at the nearest tallow-chandler's, or grocer's,
to procure “Four FIRE's FoR ONE PENNY,” any one, we imagine
(even one of LoRD MALMESBURy’s much calumniated clerks) would
be able to tell us off-hand, without the use of pen, pencil, chalk,
or slate-pencil, what was the “halley”. of a hundred Fires? We
grant that the 'English are not in the habit of “calculating” so much
as the Yankees, still we maintain that there is not a single Ex-
Chancellor of the Exchequer who could not readily go through the
above simple sum. Have MEssRs. HuRST AND BLACKETT gone into

For the future Louis Napoleon is determined that the sword shall

THE POLICEMAN’S PROGRESS.
Notwithstan DING the contempt which is likely to be incurred by
the quotation of a trite maxim, we will venture to observe, that the
º study of mankind is man. We will further remark, that if the
study of man is one which is proper for mankind in general, there are
certain particular classes of º: whom it is, or may be, cultivated
with an especial propriety. Among these are all the divisions of the
Police; for man is a subject that in the discharge of their duty they
have continual occasion for taking up. Therefore we recognise a
peculiar fitness of things in the attention which, at Chatham, according
to the ensuing extract from a report of Naval and Military Intelligence,
a number of those protectors of the public lave been lately devoting to
a knowledge of that organisation which they are so often called upon
to collar:—
“A series of very interesting and exceedingly able lectures have been delivered
to the members of the Metropolitan Police Force doing duty in Chatham Dockyard.
The concluding lecture of the series was “On the Physiology of Man," and was illus-
trated by numerous sketches and diagrams, and the whole of them have been
delivered by Mr. Litchfield at the reading-room which is provided in the yard for
the accommodation of the force.”
From what follows we are led to infer that the learned lecturer is no
professed º but an uncommonly intelligent officer of the corps
which formed his audience, who has acquired a knowledge of anatomy
and, various other sciences to the end of instructing his comrades
in blue:—
“In the physiology of man the lecturer appeared to have made himself thoroughly
conversant with his subject, and in a very clear manner described the beautiful
framework of bones, muscles, and tendons, which are the organs of locomotion;
the brain and nervous system, the lungs, the heart, bloodvessels, and absorbents
for the circulation of the vital fluids through the body, and the teeth, the stomach,
and digestive organs; he also described the continual waste and renewal of every
portion of the frame.”
The knowledge of all the particulars above enumerated will afford
the policeman, whilst upon his beat, abundant food for contemplation,
a perpetual repast which he will be enabled to enjoy without any descent
into areas, and breach of discipline. In pacing to and fro on the pave-
ment, he will be enabled to reflect on that portion of the beautiful
framework of bones, muscles, and tendons wherein are comprised the
particular organs of that locomotion which he is ºf: in practising.
Catching a pickpocket in the act of theft, his view will not be limited to
the spectacle of a little ragamuffin twitching the corner of a passenger's
protruding handkerchief; his mind's eye will discern the mechanism of
the arm, wrist, palm, fingers; the bones, and the flexors and extensors
and little delicate ſidicinal muscles, working by means of finely ramified
nerves deriving their influence from a brain wonderfully organised, but
perhaps too protuberant in the regions assigned by phrenology to
secretiveness and acquisitiveness. He will take the offender into
custody also with an intelligent consciousness of the organic machinery
which, in so doing, he puts in force together with the law. Should the
delinquent give him a run, he will, when the chace is over, have an
opportunity, as he fetches breath, of pondering the action of the lungs,
heart, and iſ. vessels; and when off duty, and employing his, teeth
on the plateful provided for him by the hand of affection, he will be in
a position to meditate on the functions of the stomach and the rest of
the digestive organs. We rejoice to learn that—
“The educational movement is well supported by the members of the force, and
is earnestly promoted by the superintendent, Mr. Richaridson."
Hitherto the Policeman has confined his attention to the arrest of
evil-doers, but he has now begun to apprehend the facts of science.
No longer content with clutching rioters and rogues, and members of
the swell mob, he is endeavouring to grasp ideas: he not, only, com:
mands progress in the thoroughfares, but exemplifies, it in the walks of
intellect; and his motto as well as his injunction is, “MoveOn!”
Pat on Butter.
“An Irish paper draws attention to the remarkable fact that American butter is
beginning to reach Liverpool, Manchester, &c., in such large quantities as to imperil
the Irish trade in that commodity.”
ALL we can say is, that the article in question does not come wrapped
111 American newspapers.

AN OLD FABLE NEWLY APPLIED.
(Dedicated to the Bench of Bishops, and the RIGHT HoN. B. DisBAELI,
M.P.)
ONCE on a time, when, AEsop has shown clearly, .
All beasts could talk, that now go dumbly stalking,
(And not the monkeys, owls, and asses merely,
Wh9 still enjoy the privilege of talking)
The Man, who somehow even then contrived
To do his quadruped acquaintance brown,
Footsore from a long baking tramp arrived
At a green lawn, to which a wood ran down.
Quoth he, “Pedestrian exercise, they say,
Is mighty wholesome, but on such a day,
Q'er a hard road, and in tight shoes, beside,
Shanks' # is the worst beast a man can ride.
If I could only make a shift,
Somehow, to get a lift,
I shouldn’t be at all particular
About the points of what I had below me;
So that it could preserve its perpendicular,
And bear my weight, I'd mount ought you could show me!”
As thus he pondered, bounding from the wood,
- At gaze a Stag there stood—
Eying the Man, ev’n as the Man eyed him. -
44 §'. won't do,” quoth he, “you’ve legs too slim,
A haunch more fit for roasting than for riding;
Besides those horns of his are vile inventions,
And e'en if I could ride, I couldn't catch him.”
The while he pondered, still the Stag did watch him
With his large eye—I know not if confiding
In his own fleetness, or the Man's intentions—
When sudden, with a shake of his wide horn,
And stamp, half rage, half scorn, , , .
He flung his antlered head | in disdain— -
As who’d say, “Hang it—there's that bore again!”
The Man turned round, and saw, º: and prancing–
But rather more retreating than advancing—
An unbroke Colt, well up to fourteen stone,
To whom, with half a fº 'twas just as clear,
Bridle and saddle were t º unknown,
As that he had no liking for red deer.
The Man approached, and with a well-bred bow
Proferred the Colt “good day.”
Adding aside, “Just my weight, I should say”—
Assured him, he with safety might draw near,
The Colt, retreating, answered with a neigh.
“I see,” observed the Man, “the Stag annoys you
'Tis an annoying brute. What with his airs,
Those long thin legs—like a four-footed stork-
Those horns, on which, if angry, he can poise you
As bumpkins poise a truss upon a fork.”
The Colt took up the tale—“Yes, and his smell,—
His droppings, –I can't come near where he feeds,
Poisoning pasture:grounds and poaching meads,
Insulting us, and injuring, as well.
Could I but catch him, I’d pay off his scorns;
I have the speed, but, then, those horrid horns!”
“That for his horns,” quoth Homo, “horns, indeed .
I’d soon cut them, if I had but the speed.
I'll tell you what, we both abhor the brute,
Suppose we both combine in his pºsit;
You have the speed of limb I lack,
So just let me get | upon your back;
Your speed, my skill together, soon will do ’t.
How say you?”. The conſiding Steed
Straight to the joint-stock partnership agreed :
“Get up at once.” “But softly,” quoth the Man,
- “I don't see how 1 can,
Without a something to climb up and hold by:
I think that something's laid here in the fold by.”
So from a stall near, while the groom was mapping,
He stole a set of trapping. -
“How fine I shall look?”, quoth Sir Colt, and sidled
With pride, as he was saddled, girthed, and bridled.
'Twas done, the Man was mounted in a crack,
His heels well down, his body well thrown back,
A light, firm hand upon the Pelham bit—
The Colt might do is worst the Man could sit.
They dashed towards the Stag with view.halloo,
The Stag turned tail, and fled as Stags will do.
The Colt triumphant neighed, and winnied loud,

We’ve put to flight, now let us catch and slay.”
: No,” quoth the Man, “my road lies 'tother way.”
... Your road?” exclaimed the sore astonished Colt,
“Yes,” quoth the Man, “’twixt horse and rider, know
The rider settles what’s the road to go.
Woe to the horse, if he try buck or bolt.”
“Get off!” cried Coit, “If you would not be thrown.
I let you on my back, to catch the Deer l’
“That was, when you’d a will, Colt, of your own ;
Now girthed i bitted, know your will is here.”
Sharply he drove the spur into his side,
With iron hand the Pelham bit applied,
The Colt discovered, all too late, alas,
He had been taken in—but not to grass!
And loath to own how simply he’d been hummed,
Whinnied, winced, kicked, was punished and succumbed.
MORAL.
My Brother overseers, for what is Bishop

Think of the Horse who let the Man bestride him, , , , ,
To hunt the Stag he thought, but found it was to ride him.
The Truth is sure to Come out at Last.
WE read that two of the American States alone can muster not
less than 4,000,000 pigs. This lets us into the secret at once of
where the Yankees get their tremendous quantity of gammon. They
seem to possess inexhaustible supplies—more than sufficient to supply
the whole world with, and yet leave a handsome balance for home
consumption,
The “vol. A L’AMéRICAINE.”
THERE is a clever trick, known amongst French police-officers, under
the above name. . The only “Pol a l’Américaine” that we know of is
ANNEXATION, and, we must say, the French have taken to it with such
quick fingered cleverness that they are well qualified to give the
Yankees themselves a lesson or two in the Kleptomaniac art of “ap-
propriating that which does not properly belong to you.”

PRIZE WANTS.
THE Society of Arts has been distributing its prizes and
medals for certain discoveries and inventions. We wish
it would not consider it beneath its high consideration to
offer prizes, or some specific inducements, for the following
improvements, or creations, inasmuch as they are sadly
needed by the public at large:–
Ai. medal for any architect who would build walls
of sufficient thickness to prevent one hearing the Caudle
Lectures, or jarring music, of one's neighbours.
A bronze medal É. a detonating or noise-making envelope
that would loudly give the alarm the moment an inquisitive,
Paul-prying postman ventured to pursue his investigations
. in order to test whether the contents were valuable
or not.
A prize of £15 to any stage-manager who would devisc
an uniform system of waits between the acts at all the
theatres.
A Silver Medal for a superior self-acting door-mat, that
would, either by flying up in the offender's face, or knock-
ing his shins, or tripping him up, force all boys, strangers,
begging-letter impostors, Polish counts in distress, broken.
down tradesmen in paper caps with boxes of pens and
sealing-wax, tax-gatherers, and rate collectors, and visitors
in general, whether troublesome, unwelcome, or otherwise,
to wipe their muddy boots immediately before they ad-
vanced as much as two feet even up the passage.
A Gold Medal for an improved harmonic latch-key, such
as every time the husband used it would not give the
sleeping wife in bed a violent turn.
A Turn the Wrong Way.
WE read that the turnstiles, or tourniquets, that did duty
in excluding the profane vulgar from desecrating the
sanctity of the parquet at the Bourse, are to be ºil.
We thought that Louis NApoleoN wanted every centime
of taxation to enable him to tide over the deficit. It strikes
us that, instead of taking the tourniquet off, he ought rather
to have put the screw on.
A TICKLISH EXPENSE.-Of all extravagances, perhaps
or ve'll | the habit of snuff-taking is the worst, as one cannot help
paying for it through the nose.
GALLANT CIHARGE UPON THE ENEMY'S WAN.
A MERITORIOUs º: was made, the other day, by MR. DEPUTY
Lott, to deal with the Wan nuisance. He justly remarked that the
Juggernaut Vans which thunder about the towns, not only block up
legitimate traffic, but often cause and always threaten peril to life and
limb. The civic council listened to him favourably, but, as usual, a
Nuisance found its defenders. Two wise men rose up in behalf of the
Van ruffians, and declared that the Wans testified to the increase of
business, and that everybody in business ought to have all facilities
for carrying it on. The flagrant absurdity of such a defence was so
clear.that the Council laughed out at the apologists. Admit the pro-
position that everybody in business ought to have every facility for
i. it., How many hundred thousand people of business are
daily hindered by the Vans employed by a few persons. It may fairly
be assumed that everybody who is in the City is there on business, for
nobody would think of going into the City for pleasure. ...Are all these
myriads, to be stopped, incensed, impeded, insulted, frightened, run
over, and generally outraged, in order that a small minority who employ
the Wans may profit P. “It is not meet the Council hear a riot,” says
the excellent Evans, in the Merry Wires, but the Council will hear a
riot, and a º loud one, led by Punch the Liberator, if something
be not speedily done to exorcise the Van Demons.
DIFFICULTIES FOR DR. CUMMING.
THE eye of many a reader will have been caught by the subjoined
advertisement, which is appearing in almost all the papers:–
THING; HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD. New Work. By DR.
Cumming. Publishing monthly.
Things hard to be understood. What are they, according to DR.
CUMMING ! Does the reverend Doctor—whose accuracy of quotation
is not unimpeachable—mean, by things hard to be understood, Latin
and Greek?
A STARRY CHAIN OF MAGIC.
THE Stars and the Stripes, are rather in a muddle in the Untied
States, but the Stars themselves seem to be in high repute, if Mr.
Punch may accept the fact on the evidence of a whole string of adver-
tisements which he cuts from the latest number of the New York
Herald, and Unmitigated Liar. It would appear that the vaunted edu-
cation of the States, where MR. BRIGHT declares people to be far more
advanced in the intellectual race than the benighted English, does not
prevent ladies and gentlemen from very assiduous cultivation of a
science which in England we have long, branded by the rude name, of
Imposture, and have abandoned to idiotic servant-girls and the like.
The Herald heads the list, in a business-like manner, with the word
“Astrology,” just as if the announcements were as legitimate as
those of “Books,” or “Want Places,” and thus starts off:—
BONA FIDE ASTROLOGIST-MADAME WILson tells the object
of your visit, gives magic charms and good luck for life free of charge; tells
all the events of ić. present and future. Consultations on business, marriages and
courtships, travelling, &c. This is the most wonderful astrologist of the age. Give
her a call, you will not regret it. No. 189, Allen Street, near Stanton, over the
bakery. Please pull the bell and walk right up-stairs, Charge, for ladies and
gentlemen, 50 cents.
It will be observed that MADAME WILSON invites both gentlemen
and ladies, and charges the same price for each class of patients. The
next Madame will have nothing to do with masculine inquiries, but
then she lets off the ladies at i price:–
ASTQNISHINº-MAPsº MoRRow, Seventh Daughter, has a gift
of foresight; tells how soon and often you will marry, and all you wish to
know, even your very thoughts, or no pay : lucky charms free; her equal is not to
be found; her magic image is now in full operation. 184, Ludlow Street, below
Houston. Price 25 cents. Gentlemen not admitted.
What her “magic image” º be one cannot say, but at a guess
one may be permitted to recal the hideous contrivances, which the
lowest class of so-called dentists hang at their doors, and by which a
pair of well-furnished jaws slowly opens and shuts alſ day, to the diver-

sion and hindrance of butcher-boys. Doubtless the image is very
awful, and we hope that MADAME MoRRow will behave better to her
sickness; restores drunken and unfaithful husbands; has a secret to make you
beloved by your heart's ideal, and brings together those long separated. Ladies
25 cents, gentlemen 50 cents. Residence, No. 90,Third Avenue, above Twentieth

Motion, and then ran away without paying the man who turned the
crank in the cellar. But here is another:-
CLAIRVOYANT WHO HAS NO EQUAL-Ladies who are sick,
in trouble, or unfortunate, can consult her with the strictest confidence. She
warrants to cure the most aggravated cases of rheumatism in a few days. If you
wish to obtain correct information on all events, call and see Mrs. Milton, No. 184,
Waverley Place, corner West Tenth Street, from 9 o'clock, A.M. until 8 P.M.
We do not see, any reference to the unfortunate Stars in this case
but the bringing clairvoyance to the cure of rheumatism is a ractical
process worthy young America. Perhaps MRs, MILTON also cuts
corns Mesme y, and hair Astrologically Berenice's Hair is

in Trine occult opposition and projection with the streaming locks so
lovely pale” of the current Comet. The next lady, MRs. SEYMour,
is simply business-like:-
LAIRVOYANCE.-Mrs. Seymour's Medical Rooms are removed to
101, West Fifteenth Street, corner of sixth Avenue, entrance on Fifteenth
Street. Consultations on Sickness, business, absent friends, &c., and satisfaction
guaranteed or no pay.
Consultations on absent friends are usually of a kind which absent
friends, who have, like SIR PETER, left their characters behind them,
would not be very anxious to hear. Medical rooms are a new inven-
tion, of which one would like to know more, but as we perceived in a
recent commercial paragraph from New York that “Houses are ali
drug,”, we must conclude that HIProgRATEs and Vitruvius have
entered into some inexplicable partnership. But now comes:-
ORA A. SEMAN, INDEPENDENT CLAIRVOYANT—Medical
and business consultations, day and evening; the science she unfolds so satis-
factorily to all it is unnecessary to give illustrations of theastounding results. She
continues at 239, Division Street.
The fair and off-hand CoRA is not only independent of all other
clairvoyants, but of an American gentleman called LINDLEY MURRAY,
and we fear her spirits are not of an educated order. Perhaps it was
one of them who personated the very individual we have named, and
being asked whether he really was LINDLEY MURRAY, replied, “Guess
I air.” The next magician admits both ladies an Fº but
Fº finds that the stars are more reluctant to talk of male than of
emale business, at all events the men are charged extra:-
MARAME RAY, 260, Seventh Avenue, near Twenty-seventh Street,
surprises all who visit her. The sick, troubled and unlucky should test her
powers. She tells your very thoughts, lucky numbers, losses. Ladies 25 cents,
gentlemen 50 cents.
“One that hath had losses, goto,” says Dogberry, improof that he is not
an ass, but a most respectable man. Still, in spite of his authority, we
cannot help thinking that a man who will give half a dollar to be told
of his losses is what Dogberry was called. But that is matter of taste
some people feel pleased to recount their illnesses and troubles, and
ADAME RAy’s clients are quite a Cave of Adullam lot, the sick,
troubled, and unlucky. We don’t care about MADAME RAY.
Mº. COLCHESTER, Business, Medical, and Test Medium, can be con-
sulted at his rooms, 371, Fourth Street. Hours from 9 A.M. till 6 P.M.
What is a Test Medium?_Before the Test and Corporation Acts
were repealed in England, a Test. Medium was the profane medium
through which an exciseman or a tide-waiter had to pass into office, by
conforming to the most solemn rite of the Church. We have now no
meaning for the phrase in this country, and cannot understand what
this Colchester is. Pass on to a much more flourishing affiche:-
EAD THIS.—A Phrenologist and Astrologist that beats the world,
and $5,000 reward for º one who can equal Miss WELLINGros, who is
acknowledged to be the only lady in this º who truthfully º information con-
e
cerning losses, lawsuits, journeys, absent friends, love, courtship, marriage, health,
wealth, and who will reclaim drunken and unfaithful husbands. Miss W. is the
only º in this city who has the genuine Roman and Arabian talismans for love,
good luck, and all business affairs, and are guarantees for life. Delay not to consult
this naturally gifted and beautiful young lady, Lucky numbers given. Highly
respectable city references can be seen at her residence, 101, Sixth Avenue.
That is something like. Conquest sits upon her, plume crowned
elm, and her very name is a guarantee for *"... iss WELLING-
TON, a tº: ted and beautiful young lady. She reclaims drunken
and unfaithful husbands. Are there such monsters in Mº BRIGHT's
patent America? Surely they must be º travellers, Irish immi-
grants, or German colonists. Never mind, she can deal with every
nation, has she not both Roman and Arabian talismans and city
references? No wonder she beats the world, and defies it to lay down
£1,000 and show her equal. We should hereby invite her to send over
our lucky number, if we did not already know that it is No. 1064, and
will next week be No. 1065. But greater is behind. The world is
beaten by WELLINgton, but Byron is its greatest wonder; and here
is the last and most glorious name on the list:-
HE GREATEST WONDER IN THE WORLD is the young and
accomplished Madame Byros, from Paris, who can be consulted with the
strictest confidence on all affairs of life, embracing love, courtship, business, and
Madame is young, accomplished, and from Paris, can do as much as
MADAME WELLINgtoN (who would hardly say * came from Paris)
and one thing more. She will make you beloved, mind, not necessarily
by the party whose business it is to love you, but by your heart’s
Ideal, who may probably have neither, right or desire to take such a
* This is a very Parisian, astrologist, and we are sorry to see
that MR. LINgolº, who is a º man, permits such incorrect magic
to be practised. The lady may well be º ByRon, for her morale is
decidedly of the Byronic tinge. She is not only the greatest wonder in
the world, but also the greatest wonder in the States, a much prouder
distinction, as every American wi ge, and as the force of Magic
can no further go, we now commend this chain of evidence of education
to the attention of our respected friend, John BRight.
PROTECTION AGAINST LADIES.
Is nothing to be done for the protection of the Judges? Are the
real silk gowns to be permitted to worry the bench. ad libiţum? Mr.
Punch's sympathies were painfully roused by reading the law reports
the other morning, when it appeared that on the same day no, fewer
than three ladies appeared in person in one of our Superior Courts, and
successively opened upon the unfortunate Judge who was sitting. One
lady didn't exactly know what she wanted, another wanted something
which the Judge thought she might have, #he only knew º what
it was, while #. third, the eternal MRs. Coºpert, knew perfectly well
what she wanted, and also that she could not haveit, and being informed
of the latter fact, retired, “loading the Court and jury with abuse.”
Now the Judges can hold their own, tolerably well, against the ligence
of the Bar, but the licence of crinoline is a new feature in judicial life,
and one against which the Justices should be provided. The ermine
has no chance against the domestic cat. We think that at all events
all Female Barristers should be sent to fight it out with MR. Justice
Cressweil, who understands the playfulways of the ladies better than
the other Judges are bound to do.
A Sporting offer.
WILL anybody bet ared cent that when we receive the indignation
of the North about the burning of the Harvey Birch by the Southern
steamer the Nashville, the Yankees will not be found to have dis-
covered consolation in the fact that the vanquished captain bore the
name of NElson—now etarnally dis —yes, Sir

THE BALLAD OF MARY NEWELL.
See Police Reports.
ow, list ye, fair ladies, a tale
will tell,
'Tis about a maidservant, one
MARY NEw-ELL,
Who contri-ved her Master to
rob and to sell:
Was not this a 'cute cunning
minx MARY New-ELLP
Her master he lived near the
Vauxhall Bridge Road,
In the Gardens 'clept Bess-
borough lay his abode.
His name it was BARKER, the
truth I do tell, , .
And the name of his servant
was MARY NEw-ELL.
Now one morning her Missus
unto her did say,
“MARY NewELL, we're
ing this might to the
#. -
So be sure .." keep in-doors,
and see that all’s well,”—
* “Oh, yes, I’ll be sure, Mum,”
Says Many Nºw-Eii.
The evening it came, and the evening it passed,
For alas! pleasant evenings for ever won't last:
Home to supper they went, and they rang the door-bell,
And they knocked at the knocker for MARY New-ELL.
They rang and they knocked, and they knocked and they rang,
Till the streets they re-echoed with thump and with clang,
At length MR. BARKER, exhausted, said, “Well, --
Something surely has happened to Many New-ELL.
MR. ALLEN, his neighbour, disturbed by the din, . ->
Cried, "A back window’s open, I'll try and get in:
So he entered, alack! and what language can tell
The sight that he saw there, O MARY NEw-ELL!
In the passage a pail full of liquid there stood,
The liquid was red, and it look-ed like BLOOD
And a poker lay broken, with hair on't, to tell
How some one had MURDERED poor MARY New-ELL!
The house had been ransacked—rooms turned inside out-
rawers open—plate packed up-clothes scattered about:
But 'twas strange that no trace could be found of the el-
•egant form of the murdered one, MARY NEw-ELL.
The police being called, an inspector there came,
His #. was B, and eke Humphreys his name:
He just sniffed up and down stairs, then said he, “I smell
A ratin this business, Miss MARY New-ELL.”
Information receiving, to Yarmouth he goes,
A place famed for bloaters, with hard and soft roes,
There in boots, coat, and breeches he sees a young Swell-
Row who would have dreamed 'twas Miss MARY New-ELL2
This young Swell, whom he ma d so neatly to nab,
Lots of luggage to Shoreditch had brought in a cab;
There had smoked a cigar, hoping so to dispel
All idea of her being fair Mary New Eil.
She had cut her hair short, she had º every curl,
She had dressed in man's clothes, had this artful young girl:
She had dined, smoked, and chatted like any young Swell-
Was not this a bold brazen minx, MARY New-ELL *
Back to London at once by the rail she was brought,
And appeared 'fore the Beak at the Westminster Court,
To #. BARKER his story did tell;
Ah! she hung her head down then, did MARY New-ELL.
The charge being heard, says the Beak, “I shall send
This here case to a jury, my tricksyºus friend: ”
So off in the Wan to a smug little ce
In the House of Detention went MARY New-ELL.
Now you servants be warned, and at home mind you stay
Whenever your missuses go to the play:
Or you haply may share the sad fate that befell
That “eccentric.” young person, Miss MARY NEw-ELL.
AMERICAN NOTIONS ON ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS.
From the New York Herald and Liar.
The Times. The organ of the fashionable world, edited by a committee
of aristocrats in É.i. Square, and pledged to the demolition of
the Union.
The Daily News. The avowed organ of Toryism, but under the
control of LoRD SHAFTESBURY and the canting pietists of Exeter Hall.
The Post. A public-house paper, advocating rowdyism of all kinds,
but with some gleams of right views as to the beauty, of American
democracy, which, however, it advocates only from the vilest motives.
The Herald Frantically radical in words, but secretly sold to
SPURGEoN AND Co.
The Chronicle. A high-priced paper, which exists by fawning upon
the antiquated dowagers of \º. -
The Advertiser. A cheap organ, supported º the aristocracy
and the Clubs, for the dissemination of Toryism. ited by SIR Hope
GRANT, son of Lord GLENEL6, a fierce and truculent aristo. -
The Star, MR. Dish AELI's private property, and used by him to
attack freedom generally and Americans in particular. - --
The Telegraph. The canting malignant organ of aristocratic Dissent
and Puritanism.
Bell's Life. As its name imports, a paper that would call everybody
to Church as the only duty or pleasure in the world.
The Press. Read only by the lower classes, and a violent but hypo-
critical advocate of the ballot.
. The Dispatch. Another aristocratic organ, which º lying maps,
in which every attempt is made to show the United States as an insig-
nificant *
Punch. A publication so foul and degraded that it is never admitted
º º few respectable households that still exist in the rotten old
Island.
MILITARY MURDER AND SUICIDE.
... IN order to put a stop to the shooting of officers by private soldiers
it has been recommended, in every case of such murder, to hold a
drum-head court-martial, and hang the murderer on the spot. An
excellent plan if it would answer; but perhaps it would be found onl
to increase the crime which it was intended to put a stop to. The life
of common soldiers appears very generally to be rendered so miserable
as to make them tired of it; and the prospect of being hanged at once
for shooting their officers would perhaps be only an additional tempta-
tion to them to shoot their officers.
... There may be some reason in the policy of making soldiers tired of
life with a view to encourage them to riskit on occasion with alacrity;
but this policy is pushed too far when it urges men not only to expose
themselves to being shot, but also to incur the certainty of being
hanged. Qſficers fight bravely enough without the inducement, of
misery to impel them to court death and commit virtual suicide; but
then, to be sure, officers are generally actuated by a faith and inspired
with a hope of which a private can have no idea, and regard death as
merely the entrance to a higher life.
However before, the drum-head, court-martial, and the summary
gallows are resorted to, it may be advisable to try the better treatment
of the men in the ranks, whom it will be difficult to render, by the
reatest kindness, too.comfortable to be willing to fight and fall. If
the more humane expedient should fail, then perhaps it may be advisable
to try the less.
A ROYAL ENGRAVING BY DOO.
THE Ex-King of NAPLEs in answer to a deputation who went
through the solemn mockery of presenting him with a sword, which
is about as useful to him as a razor-strop would be to a baby, said
with most facetious gravity:-
-- º QUEEN and I shall preserve eternally engraved on our hearts the names of
you all.”
How they are to be engraved, we cannot tell, unless it is by the pro-
cess of lithography.
NIDIFICATION EXTRAoRDINARY-A Very curious fact, illustrative as :
it is of the partial severity of the season, is the discovery which has
recently been made, of a Martinet’s nest at Woolwich.

THE NICE-Looking Young MAN with his Back To THE FIRE-place. “It’s all

A BRIGHT WIEW OF REFORM.
THE advice given by MR. BRIGHT to the Trades' Unions
to combine with the view of forcing on the Legislature a
reform consisting in the reduction of the qualification to
yote for Members of Parliament, is as seasonable as, it is
judicious. Mills are working half-time, and, º:
operatives have leisure to consider the question of parlia-
mentary reform with dispassionate thought. The relations
of workmen in the building trade to their masters are pre-
cisely such as to render the rest of the community particu-
larly anxious just now that they should acquire preponderat-
ing political power.
What will be the good of Reform?, is a question that
may be asked by many working men who are entitled to a
vote because they have been industrious and frugal enough
to afford to be ten-pound householders? The answer is,
that a Reform which will lower the elective franchise to
such a degree as to cause the House of Commons to be
elected by the numerical majority, will constitute a Legis:
lature and a Government representing the intelligence, and
knowledge, and justice of the º . Taxation will then
be adjusted on a sound basis; all duties ºn tobacco, and
other articles of popular consumption will be repealed,
and the national revenue will be raised by taxes impar-
tially distributed between landholders and fundholders,
and other persons possessed of any description of capital,
or deriving an income from any other source than the
labour of their hands. The rate of wages will also be fixed
by law; and no workman will be allowed to take an unfair
advantage of his comrades by exerting his superior abili-
ties so as to earn more than they can, and elevate himself
above their condition of life into that of a bioated aristocrat.
A Sensible Exchange.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
“DEAR PUNCH,
. “It may be that I own a sad depravity of taste, but there are
few things on the stage I more ". than a good melodrama. But
then it must be one of the old blood-and-thunder sort, with lots of
death-struggles, and mysteries, and murders to slow music in it. Your
modern French, abominations I, detest and scorn, and shall rejoice to
see them exorcised from our stage. The refinement of slow poison
may be in accordance with the spirit of the age, and there doubtless is
some interest to the scientific mind in watching the performer through
the working of the drug, and noticing the symptoms of his gradual
decay. But to me such scenes as these are most unpleasantly revolting,
and as I’m not a doctor they serve only to disgust me. When A
wishes to kill B, whether for yengeance or for gold, I very much prefer
to see A beat or blow B's brains out, than slay him by half inches with
homoeopathic doses, which produce the most distressing facial effects,
whereof the fºliº increases until the curtain drops. A bullet
through the body, or a bludgeon-stroke behind-back, are quite manly
ways of murderſng compared with º puddings, and doctored
doctor's stuff. There is, action in the one case, and perhaps a good
grim º ; while in the other there is nothing but contortions,
that make yout of the pangs which you may suffer when having
your next tooth out. -
“With these º my mind (I can quote “haec rolvens animo,”
if you wish me to be classical) I made the other night a trans-Thamesian
expedition to see a “great sensation drama”, at the Surrey Theatre;
where, according to the play-bills, , ‘thousands nightly throng to wit.
ness the powerful situations and stupendous stage effects. . The
evening I attended was the drama's sixty-first, and that its run is not
yet over was, attested pretty clearly by the crammed, state of the pit;
whose eight hundred upturned faces, swaying to and fro with varying
emotion, were to my mind quite worth .# across the Thames
to see. The piece is by its author called the Idiot of the Mountain,
which they who love alliteration will agree with me in altering to the
Idiot of the 'Ill. There are only three men killed, and, although there
is a thunderstorm there's no terrific combat: so the incidents of
interest are comparatively mild. But, in accordance with the fashion
there’s a great Sensation Scene,” which is very clearly the chie
magnet of attraction, and is very much too complicated for me briefly
to describe. It is called ‘The Smuggler's Nest. Overhanging the
Abyss,’ the nest being a small hut perched six feet from the stage, and
built with three walls only, that the audience may see into it. A plank,
lifted by a pulley, bridges over the abyss, on the other bank of which
there grows an over hanging fir-tree, whose boughs reach very nearly
to the window of the hut. To these ingredients, in the background
add a moon with flitting clouds, a flash or two of lightning, some slow
music, and a thunderbºli, which shatters the old firſtree as the heroine
is crossing it, and crash! she tumbles headlong into the abyss, Vicious
Villain and Bold Smuggler, whom she wished to overhear, leave the
hut by torchlight, and then with her back hair, down, up she climbs
unhurt—not a speck on her gay petticoat—and creeps into the hut.
Re-enters the Bold Smuggler, and proposes instant marriage-she
spurrins him—shrieks" out 'Help!" and (of course). “Unhand me,
illain!’—enters Idiot—takes a header slap down into the abyss-
climbs up other side, and dashes into hut—knocks down the Bold
Smuggler—rescues heroine–Tableau.
“Here, it will be seen, is thrilling action and excitement, enough
to make the heads wave in the agitated pit; and when in the last
scene the Vicious Villain is discovered in the costume of a black-
smith (from his previous attire I had quite fancied him a $º
and, being desperate, endeavours to sledge-hammer, the Boſſi

accused of murder, robbery, and half-a-score of crimes, including
that of stealing somebody whom he has passed off as his, son,<
when, as a climax, Vicious Villain, stabs the Idiot in the ribs, and
then is shot stone-dead by him while trying to escape, the Pit waved

Gallery betrayed alike delight.
. “On lesser points of interest I have little space to dwell, such for
instance as the working, of the Vicious Villain's eyes, whose whites
made ghastly contrast to his copper-coloured cheeks. But the piece is
no less interesting than it is instructive; for it throws a flood of light
upon the social life of France (where, judging by the names merely,
the scene seems to be laid), and reveals some highly curious customs
of that country, which no tourist I have met with has ever yet
described. Before my visit to the Surrey I was not at all aware that
the foreman of a jury, sitting on a case of murder, was allowed to take
a walk while the trial was proceeding, and so º time to strike a
§ with the daughter of the prisoner to bring her father in ‘Not
Guilty,’ on condition of her promising to marry the said juryman, who
is the real murderer, and whom (of course) she deeply º: Neither
was I conscious that in France a master blacksmith went abºut on
working days in full evening costume (dress coat, wai and black
trousers, clean shirt and white choker, a camellia in his button-hole

lady's drawing-room an uninvited guest, and carry ºn dark plots with
º girls and pedlars, who have the privilege of making the same
ady's house, their own, and of coming in and out by the front way or

*Family on account of these queer continental customs, one finds
the intricacies of the plot grow terribly perplexing as the play proceeds.
Indeed I have to thank the “spirited lessees’ not alone for their good

to make a Tableau) I have not the least idea. But mysteries of course

flattery of that tale turned out, like
most other flattery, to be. flam.
The tale of which Hope is the
hearer only is too often likewise as fallacious as it is flattering. Let us
hope, against hope, that the news announced in the subjoined paragraph
taken ‘. the Army and Navy Gazette is not too good to be true
in the sense wherein our gallant contemporary understands the an-
nouncement:-
* Indian Prize Money.-The º of the expectants of Indian Prize *
c -
will be somewhat raised by an official notification that no applications for De
Lucknow, or Pegu prize money will be received after the 1st proximo. We trust,
therefore, that the discreditable delay which has so long prevailed with reference
to the distribution of those funds may terminate.”
There cannot be the slightest difficulty in ºil. no applica-
tions for the Indian prize-money, now so long due, which may be made
after the first of next month, will be received." The question is
whether any such applications, albeit made on or before that day, will
ever be complied with, or meet with the least attention? This is a very
doubtful question indeed, and experience suggests the prediction, that,
after those applications shall have been duly made and received, some
fresh excuse will be found for prolonging that delay in the distribution
of the funds claimed to the persons who are entitled to them, which the
* and Mary Gazette justly terms discreditable. -
That the spirits of many, if not most of the expectants of Indian
ho, the Idiºt is himself, I'd
º will be raised by the official notification above alluded to
is very cre ible to believers in º of the departed. Probably
the majority of those ill-requited heroes are now in their graves, whither
their journey was accelerated by the heart-sickness of hope deferred.
The intimation, how equivocal soever, that some idea of settling their
claims is entertained } Government, may be considered quite enough
to wake the dead in these º: of easy communication with that once
undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller used to return,
but whence many comeback again for a short trip, now that table-ways
are established between this world and the other. The Spiritualists
already talk of one War Office Ghost, whose apparition was the means
of rectifying an official mistake. i.e. the War Office, between the
present date and the second of December, look out for raps on tables
and desks, and pigeon-hole chests of drawers, from the spirits o
deceased Indian officers, kept out of their prize-money. What medium
can make spirits rap if the circulating medium cannot?...There is, at
any rate, a spirit in the Press, which, until the shamefully wronged
claimants of Indian prize-money get their due, will never cease to give
the defaulters an occasional series of the severestraps on the knuckles.
COPLES FOR PHYSICIANS.
A LETTER in the Times, from a general practitioner's assistant, which
appeared the other day, complains of the badness of the handwriting in
which º are generally accustomed to compose their prescrip:
tions. Now as the difference between 3 and 3 in point of dose would
in many cases be the difference between a remedy and a poison, because
a blot, or aberration of the pen might easily cause the former figure, a
rachm, to be mistaken for the latter, an ounce, it is obvious that
there is much reason in the Assistant's complaint. Physicians, there-
fore, are recommended to return to those studies of penmanship which
they used, to cultivate in early youth; and here are some copy-boo
texts which they might employ themselves in writing out, so to speak,
for practice:–
jºuaid £m/hiricism.
43/eed as seldom as /lossible.
/ºu//wing is rarel, /eactised.
Ørugs are deleterious.

ſames's houlder is a feleſſage.
‘ſeaue well enough alone.
_//edicine remoues alsłacles.

By carefully copying out, the foregoing maxims, and, others of a
similar nature, physicians will anyhow improve their handwriting, and
thus at least avoid killing anybody by making a clerical error in a
medical prescription.
THE OPPRESSED AT HOME.
MR. YANCEy, one of the two Southern Commissioners acting in
England, at the late dinner of the Fishmongers' Company, in answer tº
a complimentary toast, made a speech in which there was a goºd deal
to admire; amºngst ºther things the subjoined quotation, applied to
the American Republic:-
“The land of the free,
And the home of the oppressed.”
The Confederate Republic, MR. YANCEy's Republic, as well as the
Yankees' Republic, may be, or at all events once more become, the
and of the free. The former is also peculiarly the home of the op-
pressed. The free, in the Southern States, are the white population,
and the oppressed are the blacks; whose home is on their master's
plantation, and whom fugitive slave-laws have prevented from finding
one anywhere else.

ULTRAMONTANE ART TREASURES.
AMONG the various branches of industry to be represented at the
Great Exhibition of 1862, a very {}". position will be occupied
by the interesting, but, in this land of insular prejudice, too long and
too generally despised and derided art of Priestcraft. So, at least,
there appears good reason to conclude from the subjoined paragraph,
which has gone the round of the papers:–
“The Pope AND THE Exhibition of 1862.-His Holiness the Pope has conde-
scended to order his Government to take part in the London Exposition of 1862.
For this §. a commission will assist the Minister of Commerce and the Minis-
ter of Public Works in selecting the objects destined for the Exposition; and further,
a pontifical commissioner will be sent to London, for the special purpose of taking
charge of the said objects. The * of carriage and of insurance will be
defrayed by the Pontifical Government. Three thousand feet of space have been
set apart by the English commissioners for the exhibitors.”
It is expected that the objects, selected by the Papal Ministers,
assisted by a commission composed of Princes of the Church, Mon-
signori, and other ecclesiastics, will comprise the following #.".

Coat of Trêves. The Heads of the Three Kings and the Bones of the
11,000 Virgins of Cologne, which will be included in the Sacrosanct
Osteological and Anatomical Department. The Holy Father would
have caused the blood of St. Januarius to be added to this part of the
collection, but for circumstances over which he has no control, and
which lacerate his paternal heart. The Bambino of Rome. The Casa
Santa of Loretto, provided the same means as those by which it was
conveyed to its present site from Galilee can be employed to transfer
it to Brompton. The Apparition of La Salette, as *}º up.

yet—I have my misgivings, and I'll tell you how they arose.
‘My Uncle's Aunt, Miss KAKEBRED, who speaks seven languages,

cases, but, in fact, Miss K. has never recovered either her spirits or
her damages, for the commercial gentleman ran off to Boulºgne and
opened an Estaminet, where my cousin, Cº.KE LITTLETON, and some of
his friends of the Bar, have played billiards frequently.

enjoined caution, and suggested failure, for Miss K. in a masculine

A ROWLAND FOR AN OLIVER,
UNDER, the head of Essays and Reviews, a contemporary publishes
the subjoined statement relative to the Bishop or "SAI issung and
DR. WILLIAMs:—
“When notice was first given to DR. Williams that proceedings would be taken
against him, the bishop wrote to him to request that he would afford him facilities
fºr disposing, without difficulty, of all preliminary technicalities, so that the
whole question might be foughton its merits."
With all proper respect for the Bishop of SALISBURY, everybody
who reads what is above related will feel compelled to ask that right
reverend prelate whether he really believed that he saw any green in
DR. WILLIAMs's eye? The idea of writing, as prosecutor, to a
defendant, requesting him to be so kind, as to give a handle for an
indictment, is truly clerical in its simplicity, º it may not be
deemed worthy of a very dignified, to say nothing of a very reverend,
divine. It is a regular parson's trick, and one that nobody but a
parson would think of playing, except a pantaloon in a tomime,
attempting to practise a similar artifice on the innocence of the clown.
If DR. WILLIAMs would, but make his friend SARUM the present of a
stand-point," that clerical ARCHIMEDEs could easily move the earth so
as to bring down the Court of Arches about the ears of the º:
and Reviewer. But no; the spot of verdure on the iris. of Dn.
WILLIAMs exists only in the episcopal imagination; and y:—

A DINNER FOR A DUKE.
HE DUKE of CAMBRIDGE
having signified his gra-
cious willingness to dine
with the º at
Woolwich, the officers
of course resolved to
ive him a good dinner,
in the faith that he in-
herited his noble father's
well known relish for
the same. In pursuance
of this aim, the ducal
tastes were very care-
fully consulted.; and
thoughthe Times.informs
us simply that “a ban-
quet was prepared on an
appropriate scale,” that
statement gives small
notion of what was really
done. -
By details which have
reached us through a cu-
linary channel, fathomed
by an active officer of
*. police, we may state
that the menu,
º, framed,
every delicacy in or out
of season, and was ºn such a scale of luxury, as would have made Luguilus smack
his classic lips to think of, and the shadeofold ViteLLIts long to dine once more
on earth. But before the day arrived it was luckily remembered that the Duke had
lately signified his, approbation of the mess of the Military Academy, and had said
that the cadets had nothing to complain of in their diet of boiled mutton, hard
tatoes, and sour swipes. It was naturally supposed therefore that his Royal
Highness had undergone some change in his dietary tastes, and would better like a
dinner served with Spartanlike simplicity than a banquet on the model of the
#. of Rome. s notion was accordingly e. to the cook, and how
skilfully that artist contrived to carry it out may be seen by a perusal of the

The decorations of the room and the appointments of the
table were in keeping with the tempting nature of the
viands, for we understand the banquet was served on a
deal table uncovered by a cloth, and lighted by tallow candles
in tin “regulation” sticks. Knives and two-pronged
forks were furnished for the guests who were too fine to
to feed au naturel with their fingers, but to no one was
extended the effeminate and foppish luxury of a napkin,
nor was any one º all throughout the dinner to
ask for a clean plate. In fact, the rough-and-tumble way
in which everything, was done was strictly in accordance
with the Spartan code of discipline which seems to be in
yoguenow at the Woolwich Cadet Schoºl; whereit appears
to be considered that lads grow rich in knowledge by living
on poor diet, and are made good soldiers through having a
bad cook. After dinner “No smoking allowed.”
The difficulty which bold, GENERAL GERATENzweig met with in
A FIRE-EATER FEEDING HIMSELF.
. A SHORT time # according to the Morning Post, the officers of a
distinguished cavalry regiment combined in inviting one of their com-
rades to leave the corps, because, having been insulted by a certain
}. he omitted to call that person out. One day last week our
ashionable contemporary, whose columns are of course duly studied §
those gallant officers, published part of a letter from Warsaw, whic
particularly merits their attention and that of all other valiant gentle-
men who wish to revive the chivalrous practice of duelling. It contains
an edifying account of the death of GENERAL GERSTENzweig, whence
duellists whom circumstances forbid to fight may learn how nevertheless
to give each other all the satisfaction which offended dignity can desire.
Great, GENERAL GERSTENzweig had imprisoned some Poles in the
citadel at Warsaw. Soon afterwards an insurrection was expected. If
it broke out, too many prisoners in the citadel might prove troublesome.
#.' some of the imprisoned Poles were ºi by the com-
mander of the fortress with the sanction of Count LAMBERT; and :—
“On hearing this, GENERAL GERstrºnzwerg went in a state'of great irritation to
Count LAMBERT, reproached him with having acted from fear, and called him a
coward. As several officers of the staff were present, a duel seemed inevitable; but
as a hostile meeting between two such high pers s at that moment might
present great inconveniency, it was decided that one of the two should kill himself
the same evening, and that lots should be drawn to decide which it should be. The
lot fell on GENERAL GERstEnzweig, and he fired three times with pistols at his
head, the last time inflicting a mortal wound.”
trying to blow out his own brains is very suggestive of the strength
and thickness of that skull which nature had provided to contain and
defend them. He found it a hard matter to satisfy,Count LAMBERT.
The Count would doubtless have experienced as much trouble in giving
himself satisfaction if the fall of the die had placed him under the
necessity of indemnifying his honour by destroying his own life. Such

A WARNING TO JONATHAN ;
OR, “DOTH HE WAG HIS TAIL?”
JonATHAN, JONATHAN, 'ware of the Lion:
He’s patient, he’s lacable, slow to take fire:
There are tricks which in safety a puppy might try on,
But from dogs of his own size they waken his ire.
With your bounce and your bunkum you’ve pelted him often,
Good humoured he laughed as the missiles flew by,
Hard words you’ve employed, which he ne'er bid you soften,
As knowing your tallest of talk all my eye.
When you blustered he still was content with pºliº
When you flared up he just let the shavings burn out:
He knew you were fonder of talking than doing,
And Lions for trifles don’t put themselves out.
But beware how you tempt even leonine patience,
Or presume the old strength has forsaken his paw:
He’s proud to admit you and he are relations,
But even relations may take too much law.
If there’s one thing he values, ’tis right of asylum ;
Safe who rests 'neath the guard of the Lion must be:
In that shelter the hard-hunted fugitive whilome,
Must be able to sleep the deep sleep of the free.
Then think twice, and think well, ere from guard of the Lion
Those who seek his protection you try to withdraw :
Though Stowell and §. and KENT you rely on,
There are points on which Lions won’t listen to jaw.
Remember in time the old tale of the showman,
Who his head in the mouth of the Lion would sheath,
Till with lengthened impunity, bold as a Roman,
He seemed to forget that the Lion had teeth.
But the time came at last, when all risks madly scorning,
He went just too far down that road rough and red,
When, with only one wag of his tail for a warning,
Snap went Leo's jaws, and off went jºiead !
A CULINARY WONDER WANTED.
OH, these advertising people! What Dogberrys they are 1, How
constantly one finds them writing themselves down, to a level which is
well nigh asinine in its stupidity! As a sample, look at this:—
WANTED, a COOK, in a small family, from 26 to 36 years of age.
Must be clean, active, good-tempered, tºº.” early riser, and of the
Church of England. Wages E16, with beer. Apply, &c.
Now, the advertiser surely does not mean to tell us that his family is
from 26 to 36 łº old, for in that case the word “small” would be
clearly misapplied to it, unless indeed its members all of them were
dwarfs. Yet, from his clumsy wording, this is how the sentence must
properly be read; and when people address servants they cannot speak
tooW. nor expect to have bad English corrected into good,
With regard to the fine qualities required in this cook, there is really
such a string of them that no one but a petticoated Crichton could
possess them, and any one who said she did would be almost wanting
modesty to make the bold avowal. For instance, as for looking for
good temper in a cook, one would about as soon .. to see good
taste in a gorilla, or good nature in a pig. A cook, whose cheeks are
always being reddened by the fire, becomes of course hot-tempered
merely from the heat; and if she be hired “with beer” at indiscretion,
we doubt if all her church-going will keep her temper cool.

boarding the Trent is such a violation of all international propriety,

EDWIN'S RESURGAM.
See the Article of the New York Times on MR. EDw1N JAMEs.
A LEGAL star, in mid career,
Dropped sudden into deepest dark–
No more was Edwin JAMEs seen here,
No more was EDw1N JAMEs's clerk.
We deemed both sunk in starless might,
As the sea swamps a scuttled bark,
When lo º; into light,
The hand of Edwin JAMEs's clerk!
Who else could write the paragraph
That has excited such remark–
Or blow our Edwin’s trumpet half
So well as Edwin JAMEs's clerk?
Who knew each brief, who knew each fee,
Knew all that’s patent, all that’s dark,
About that famous §§ C.
Unless 'twas Edwin JAMEs's clerk 2
The outer world had never known
One half his merits and his mark–
What Bills he passed, what verdicts won,
Except for Edwin JAMEs's clerk.
We thought E. J. beneath a cloud
At once unsavoury and dark;
Not so—he soared above the crowd,
Too pure—says EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.
With Bankruptcy for last resort
We deemed him prey of legal shark;
It was the Bill and not the Court
He passed, says EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.
By vulgar arts we deemed he climbed,
ith brazen face and blatant bark;
No–’twas by eloquence sublimed
He rose, says Edwin JAMEs's clerk.
We thought the Bar was democrat;
No—in the shadow cold and dark
Of aristocracy he sat,
Yet won, says EDw1N JAMEs's clerk.
We thought he could not linger here,
For reasons needless to remark;
'Twas but to bless another sphere
He went, says EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.
We thought that other men had fames,
Others in cases made their mark;
But no—’twas JAMEs and only JAMEs
Did all, says EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.
The New York Bar, we thought, such guest
Had met with faces cold and dark;
But lo! they strain him to their breast
With joy, says EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.
Too gratified that Bar should be,
When England bids such men embark,
To seek nºw triumphs over sea,
And so thinks Edwin JAMEs's clerk.
Soon may the dollars’ tinkling toll
Sweeter than song of thrush or lark,
Rejoice the eyes and glad the soul,

Blow fair Favonian gales, and far
Speed gentle Edwin’s new-launched bark—
And good luck to the New York Bar,
Good luck to EDWIN JAMEs's clerk.

SIR AESCULAPIUS PUNCH ON ALLMYEYEOPATHY.
I HAVE often been solicited to give my opinion of Allmyeyeopathy, not
by Hospital Students alone, but by those more zealous advocates of
medical reform who will accept of no half-and-half measures. Some
members, of our profession admire new lights, while others cling
tenaciously to their old lamps, which shining with ine lustre, are
so, aptly symbolical of danger. For my part, knowing but little of
Allmyeyeopathy, I have hitherto º it with an apathetic eye.
Silence with most people signifies consent. It is not every minister
whose reticence it would take volumes to construe. A BURLEIGH may
shake empires by a nod, and cause with a wink that perplexity of
nations, which was formerly supposed to originate in an eclipse. A
physician is not a diplomatist, and eloquence was not given to us for
a napkin. TALLEYRAND doubtless had peculiar thoughts, but Isolemnly
affirm that we have nothing to conceal. -
It is idle to throw physic to those dumb animals whose universal
medicine, judging from their accredited organs, appear to be whine and
bark. ...I must, however, candidly own, that the practice of physic is as
much like a game of speculation as a game of draughts, for we can never
foresee what will be the turn-up. There is this distinction too between
solid and liquid draughts—in playing with one you are huffed for not
taking a man, while with the other you may be huffed for losing him.
We are warmed by eminent authority not to put our trust in mix-
tures. Nervous patients often shudder on entering a medicated arsenal,
to see the pharmaceutical forces drawn up in battle array, while their
olfactory nerves remind them how rank is many a phial. You might
fancy that an iron-clad Harrior could scarcely resist a battery of
boluses, but the constitution of man is almost impregnable, and has
been known to survive charges more terrible than those of Waterloo,
º combines two opposite modes of treatment, being
at once active and expectant. It acts directly on the diaphragm from
whence its influence radiates to all the risible muscles. The modus
ºperandi is simple, easy, and pleasant as fibbing (I use that term in its
Pickwickian, not its pugilistic, sense). The practitioner when called
in, first ascertains that his patient is strong enough to bear a tickle.
Assured of this, he exhibits Punch's concentrated essence, of which he
always carries enough in his recollection, to kill ten ordinary jokers.
The effect is electrical... Threepenny-worth will effect a cure, unless
the depression is unusually severe. sporting barrister, revived after
taking that amount, notwithstanding he had suffered most acutely from
the Qaks. The same dose sufficed to rally an honourable Member who
lost his seat, after a violent struggle, and fell heavily in public estima-
tion. A poetical baronet was restored to consciousness by similar
means after a shocking effusion of verse, and when he had been fright-
fully cut up by a Cherokee reviewer. A commodore's widow at Bar-
badoes, who was attacked by a curious affection during a fête champêtre,
where her partner was a remarkably slim naval lieutenant—an earnest
young orator, who met with a painful accident by throwing himself on the
chair at a Debating Society, and an embarrassed Rifleman, who, in the
contest for the Ladies’ č. Cup, was himself hit in the centre before
he had even made an outer, by the brilliant orbs of a º: Peeress
—all these valetudinarians were completely restored by the concentrated
essence, and their sense of the absurdity is now as perfect as possible.
There is nothing novel in Allmyeyeopathy. Medical men have from
the time of Hippocrates been accustomed to prescribe Placebos, but
never until now with uniform success. Placebos used to be composed
of flour, now they are made with fun. To secure perfect exhilaration,
however, the concentrated essence must be pure, and taken, with
regularity, for much depends upon that. Wis comica has succeeded to
the business of vis medicatric naturae, or, perhaps, medicatriæ is
lawfully united to comica, and has ..". changed her name.
DR. John BROWN assures us that he has employed the essence, in
his practice for many years, and with most pleasurable results.
No infirmary should be for one moment without the essence, and bene-
yolent persons, might do great good by purchasing a large quantity
for administration to those who are too low-spirited to take it in them;
selves at their own residences, Every general practitioner should
carry it about with him, if possible, in his glance.
AHEAD OF THE BRITISHERS.
OUR readers will derive a melancholy satisfaction from the followin
statements contained in a letter which the American Correspondent o
the Post writes to that journal from Boston:-
“The Contractors continue to cheat marvellously. . . . To-day the Colonel
ordered an inspection of some hard bread, or army crackers, to be made, which
resulted in condemning 46 barrels out of 50. The Colonel is bound that his men
shall not be swindled out of their just and appropriate fodder by any of these
‘cussed sharks.' . . The crackers we eat are stamped ‘ 1860," and the boy's
say they have seen several marked ‘B. C.’”
The foregoing information must be consolatory to the British public,
as showing that our own Army Provision Contractors are not the
greatest rogues in the world.

To find little I. in a small village settled. ...
That one who at sixteen evinced some ambition,
At twenty, without º iń. of contrition
Should let Hymen kindle his conjugal torch
At the red lamp, which shines at a medical porch,
Is so strange, -but from love into lunacy proper,
If a girl’s bent on rushing—no Atlas can stop her.
How could I decline the soft hand of LoRD Poppy P

Whose face like his mind was a jº ank,
Who “pwided” himself on his “wings” and his “wank,”
For his tongue's ineffectual but elegant twitches
Converts, as by magic, his wealth into “witches.”
Well then!...if I must be arraign'd on my trial–
All the spirit he had might be put in a phial,
And gifted with little more life than a mummy,
I called in the doctor, and rang out the dummy.
That little I.’s now link'd to mortar and pestle
Is true; but her thoughts there do lovingly nestle,
Though dealing in scruples, she's free to confess,
She dotes on the title of M. R. Ö.S.–
A title which does not illumine the pages
Qf dreadful DEBRETT, who records ladies' ages!
Which parents consult, when their child feels a dart,
To prescribe with success for complaints of the heart.
Ere long on our brass-plate I trust will appear
“DR. BrowN,” as to Scotland we travel next year,
Where honours which some cultivate with much toil
By degrees, are enriching that erudite soil.
Such is my apology: but if you still
Mourn for me as one that is dead—read my Will:
“I give and bequeath to my Cousins so dear
The chain which I ought to have hung round a Peer.”
And those who lament little I.'s degradation
May from that bequest sip a sweet consolation.
TITULAR REFINEMENTS.
PUNCH, whose pride it is to call a spade, a spade, has often been
pained to find how few imitate his manly candour. Streets now change
their names like those who dwell in them, with a view to better their
condition, and sense is often sacrificed to style. When from a “Grub”
—sacred to hungry Bards and pinched Reviewers—emerged a MILTON,
down Punch's cheek rolled silver tears—not that he loved euphony less,
but that he loved old friendships better. Funerals, because .#
can be mimicked for a consideration, are licensed to be performe
Boots and shoes in days of yore were occasionally cobbled, now repairs
are always neatly executed. Girls of spirit never marry, but may
sometimes condescend to compose a tableau vivant, and so they are
led to the hymeneal altar. A Member would be ashamed to rai, but
he recognises the moral beauty of concession and sayes his blushes.
There was one title, however, which by reason of its antiquity, if nothing
more, we deemed secure from the refining process, but we are mistaken.
Travelling, lately from Qxford in a first class, with some Anglican
Divines, Punch was gently roused from his reverie by hearing a white
cravat who had made some allusion to the Scarlet Lady, hastily beg
ardon, and colouring deeply, correct himself—he meant to say the
ady of the Lake. What a sacrifice of truth to tenderness!

MR. PottER, who was returned for Carlisle by a majority of one, is
not the youngest member in the House of Commons, although he has
barely attained his majority.

generally qualifie
with a certain gra-
vity. We find MR.
JUSTICE BRAMWELL
reported as having
lately delivered, at
the Juridical Society,
some observations
which were evidently
intended to be jocu-
lar. A Paper having
been read on the
patent laws:–
“In the course of the
discussion which ensued,

people had got into the
habit of thinking that
men had a right of pro-
saying

invented or wrote. But
no such right existed,
and it was entirely a
matter of generosity that they were secured the emoluments arising from it for a
certain number of years. If a man wrote a book and published it, and another
bought a copy of it, the author could not prevent that man from lending it to a
#. and if the purchaser had a right to lend it to be read, he had also the right
of copying it and of giving the copy to others to be read by them.”
What fun! If a man hire a horse from a livery stable-keeper, he
may be at liberty to lend the horse to a third, for he is the purchaser of
the usufruct of the horse, and, we suppose, has a right to sub-let that.
No doubt he has also a perfect right to take a copy of the horse, and to
give or sell the copy to others to be ridden by them, provided he pro-
cures the copy by going into the horse-market and honestly buying one.
He has a right to be a horse-dealer, as he has to be a bookseller, on
those terms. That is what JUDGE Brºwei, meant to º; In a
facetious way of putting it. Horse-stealing is highly punishable be-
cause horses are easily stolen; mental property can be stolen still more
easily: literary piracy deserves proportionate punishment. This is what
BARON BRAMwell’s jocosity amounts to.
MR. JUSTICE BRAMweli, pleasantly affected to approve of Mr.
BuchanaN's celebrated declaration as to international copyright, that
“the Americans would be very foolish to agree to any such thing, as
they would then have to #. for that which they now obtained for
nothing.” The learned judge (with an appropriate wink, of course)
said, referring to the ex-President of the dº. States:–
“He was much laughed at, but he uttered what was perfectly correct, for it was
a matter of policy that the public should get out of authors and inventors the most
it could, at the smallest possible price.”
.." Judge meant to lay, down the law, that if the public
want anything good in the line either of literature or inventive art
they Qught to do that which is the least they can do, and *. good
price for it. His words above quoted are only a lively paraphrase of
the maxim which declares that the labourer is worthy of his hire. If
we did not take the foregoing remarks of MR. Justick BRAMWELI.
to have been spoken in jest, but understood them literally, we should
consider that they expressed notions of the difference between meum and
tuum, which, instead of being avowed by an ornament of the Bench,
çould be conceivably entertained only by an occupant, or a candidate
for the occupancy, of the opposite part of an Assize-Court.
PRETTY POISON-WREATHS.
AN inquest was held the other day by MR. BRENT on the body of a
young woman who poisoned herself by arsenic; and the jury returne
a verdict which set forth that the deceased had died “accidentally from
the effects of mortal disease in her stomach and other organs, occasioned
by arsenite of copper used in her employment.” . Her employment was
that of manufacturing artificial flower-leaves, the flower-stems §
“with verdure clad” by means of that poison. It was ſº". by medic
testimony that she had been ill from the same cause four times within
the last eighteen months. Under such circumstances as these, death
is evidently about as accidental as it is when resulting from a railway

One of the jurors remarked, that the use of arsenite of copper in

artificial flower-making was dº.” in France, as ń. to the
health of the workpeople. , Qf course any restriction of that sort on our
native manufacturer would be out of the question; incompatible with
British freedom. Something, however, towards abolishing the employ-
ment of arsenic in preparing decorations for beauty might be done by
humane but fast young men, in making it and its consequences the
subject of conversation with any girl, or maturer party, whom the .
happen to meet, and whose heads or bonnets may happen to be adorn
with green flowers. To apartner in a dance it is often difficult to conceive
what to say; but dress is always a safe subject; only lest the young lady
should despise you for a sentimental muff and spooney, you must take
care to treat the practice of poisoning the artificial flower-makers in the
way of business, with sufficient levity, not censuring it in strong or
serious language, but only saying, for instance, that you think it jolly
avaricious, and delightfully inhuman. She will then, perhaps, be
inspired with some disgust at the idea of wearing a wreath impregnated
with arsenite of copper.
LOWE-SONGS FOR LUNATICS.
THE Bedlamitish bosh that nowadays is published in the way of
ballad literature is really of so senseless and lunatic a character that one
would think the scribes who write it were not clothed in their right
mind, but were one and all invested with strait waistcoats. Any stuff.
es, no matter how devoid of
reason it may be, is deemed º to be dubbed a sentimental ballad;
and we are sure the samples following, if only set to music by some
ser, and sung at a few concerts by some of our first
singers, would soon be warbled in our drawing-rooms and whistled in
our streets:—

The Elephant stood on his j to take breath,
And the Tiger-cat cosily hugged him to death.

NATURE WILL OUT AT LAST.
Well-Intentioned, but Incautious Stable-Boy (in temporary disguise), to the restive and plunging blanc-mange. “Wo-ho, there / Wo-o-o-o//”
MUSIC WITHOUT NOISE.
A GREAT Musician, as everybody knows, composed certain “Son
without Words,” but MENDElssohn, in Fº those * y
impossible works, accomplished a difficulty less arduous than that
which has been surmounted by the inventor of an instrument advertised
by MR. CHAPPELL of Regent Street, as;–
“AZEMAR'S SILENT PRACTICE DRUM.”
The handbill, headed as above, informs us that:—
“For the purposes of practice, the Silent Drum possesses all the advantages of a
real one; it offers the same resistance and º to the sticks, and admits of an
equal degree of force and action in beating, unaccompanied, however, by the
excessive noise which precludes the possibility of a drum being practised in-doors.”
We would say that not only does the Silent Drum possess all the
advantages of a real one for purposes of practice, but is also free from
all the disadvantages of a drum, which, when beaten, makes a noise.
A solo on the drum is a musical performance to which few persons
would like to listen under circumstances; but when executed as a
piece ºf practice, especially in-doors, it must be extremely far flom
agreeable to anybody within hearing.
Well, but some one will say, what is the use of a Silent Drum ? Might
not the ". for purposes of practice, as well beat the air? #.
e
question is provided with an answer in the subjoined statement:—
“The degree of correctness in the beating is accurately ascertained by a slight
sound, as well as by the vibration on the leg, to which the Silent Drum is strapped;
this position of the drum on the leg also corrects the fault, common to beginners,
of allowing the sticks to drop towards the right. The small circumference of this
instrument compels, the drummer, to concentrate the blows, and its rim ensures
the sticks being kept at the proper height. The Silent Drum is very portable, six
of them ºi. ess space than one ordinary side drum.",
The fact that the small circumference of the instrument compels, the
drummer to concentrate his blows, will be apparent from the follow-
ing:—
“Directions now To use the Silent DRUM.—Strap it on the left leg, a little
above the knee, the iron tongue resting against the inside of the same; when
standing, the left leg must rest on some slight elevation; when sitting, the left leg
to be bent under, and the right one stretched out, with the right side of the drum
resting on it."
When sitting, at least, the drummer, if he missed the drum, would
very likely hit the leg against which, it would rest, and give himself an
unpleasant whack on the knee, which would forcibly remind him of the
necessity of concentration in aiming his drumstick at its mark.
MR. THOMAS CARLYLE, in many of his humorous writings, takes
frequent occasion to impress, upon his readers the great value o
the Silences. Among the Silences there are few more valuable,
especially for purposes of practice, than the Silent Drum, M. AzáMAR
would confer a great, boon upon society, and particularly the studious
part of it; if he could contrive to invent some other Silences of the
musical kind. A silent piano, in the next house would be a real
blessing to many, a person, whose auditory nerves are sensitive; so
would a silent flute, a silent fiddle, or a silent cormopeon. 'Let
M. AzéMAR consult MR. BABBAGE, who made the calculating machine
and abhors street-music; let them lay their heads together, and try if,
between them, they cannot invent a silent grinding-organ, a silent
brass band, and a silent bagpipe; to the use of which itinerant
Italians, Germans, pseudo-Scotchmen, and other creators of public
discord, should be restricted by Act of Parliament.
A Monarch is Never so Blind as When he Won't See.
M. DE WINCRE, the distinguished Prussian orator, and liberal-hearted
politician, whose eloquent i.i. of wrong generally, thrilled
throughout Europe, is about to retire, to the extreme regret of all his
admirers, from public life. It may be that he is º with the
conduct of the King, and his pompous feudal revivals, and absurd
ravings about jºić. With one so short-sighted as Wrily time
FIRST, the Prussian GLADstone may feel that his presence, so valuable
on most occasions, is no longer necessary, inasmuch as he cannot lºsibly
do any good. Probably, he excuses his retirement by saying:—“A nod
to a blind King is as good as a WINcKE.”

GOOD NEWS FOR THE NAVY.

º-
nished aboard ship
with some more music
- - to enliven him, we
– have little wish to
- quarrel with the word-
ing of this notice; or
we certainly might say that “a brass and string instrument” is a thing we never
heard of, and the nearest approach to it that we can call to mind is a wretched
old tin fiddle with its strings all out of tune, which was played by a blind, beggar
who used to haunt our neighbourhood, and weekly did his utmost to drive us
into Bedlam. But jigs, reels, and hornpipes, played on any sort of instrument,
from a trombone to a jew's harp, are certain to have life in them, and to impart
that liveliness to any pair º attached to any body that hath, the ears to
listen. So as men always work the better when cheerful in their minds, we rejoice
to see this increase to the music of the Navy, and we are not disposed to fear
that any fiddler in the fleet will have to give up Rule Britannia, and, at an enemy's
command, take to playing Yankee Doodle.

A MYSTERY BEYOND PRIESTCRAFT.
. In a "pastoral” relative to the Feast of the Immaculate Conception just pub:
lished, DR.Cuples, the great Irish theologian and astronomer, takes occasion to
denounce the Freemasons. He avers that:-
“RobespierRE, DANTox, MARAT, CARRIER, and other monsters in the shape of men, who
inundated France with the blood of hundreds of thousands . . who delighted in ruin and
devastation, were all adepts of masonic lodges.”
Suppose they were, which is doubtful because DR, CULLEN asserts it, what then?
The Brotherhood of Freemasons is a fraternity of demons, of course, according to
the logic of CulleN; and if every institution is to be judged of by members who
isgrace.it, what does DR. CULLEN, by parity of reasoning, make out of the
community which calls him Archbishop of Dublin?
DR. Cui LEN's ideas of Freemasonry seem to be rather hazy. He proceeds to
say:-
“The at leaders of the revolutionary movements—Mazzini, Kossuth, and GARIBALDI-
are looked up to as the chiefs and leaders of secret societies or masonic lodges." who can describe
the evils they have inflicted or are actually inflicting on the world: See how they assail the holy
Catholic Church.”
But, we do not see how they assail the holy Catholic Church, or the Roman
Catholic Church, which is what Dr. Culien means, but is another thing. They
seem to us to be for letting the Roman Catholic Church alone, to manage is
aſſairs in its own way, only without the assistance of the secular arm and the aid
of bayonets. They—that is, both the three liberal leaders whom Dr. CULLEN
names, and also the “segret societies or masonic lodges,” which he speaks of as
identical. Does he really not know that though a masonic lodge is a secret
Society, a secret society is not necessarily a masonic lodge, or does he only pretend
to confound the one with the other, and to represent Freemasons as inflictin
evils, when he well knows that they have 'ºi great benefits on the world,
and whom, even in Ireland, can he expect to mystify by all that fatuous bosh?
from the irish intelligence, whence the foregoing extracts from DR. CULLEN's
nonsense about Freemasonry are derived, it appears that:—
“Many Irish Roman Catholics, despite the denunciations of Dr. Cullen and his priests, still
remain Freemasons. They will not º: the inquisitive glance of the priesthood, however,
H. º secrets (not even in the confessional), and hence the hatred they exhibit towards
e society.’
The Jesuits are not so cleyer as they are generally supposed. They, at least,
ought to be in possession of the masonic secret, if that is to be discovered through
initiation into the masonic mysteries, and an affidavit of secrecy made with a mental
reservation. Or, perhaps the arcana of masonry include
a clairvoyance which, enables a lodge of Freemasons, to
see through any candidate for admission to their order,

A WOICE FROM WASHINGTON.
From our Special Correspondent.
WE Yankees ain't given to brag, .
John BULL, we expect, has no notion
Of § to war; but his flag
If he does, we shall i. from the ocean.
And when the old vagabond lies
In a state of teetotalºtion,
Old Ireland in glory will rise, ..
Independence to win as a nation.
Our breadstuffs from England kept back,
The sequel must be destitution.
Her famishing millions, in lack
Of food, j force on revolution.
WigtoRIA will have to retire; ,
Aristocracy, friends of Secession -
Will be hurled down, and trod in the mlre,
No more for to practise oppression.
Rebellion we'll bring to an end, ... ...
The slaves 'mongst our heroes dividing,
Or arms to the niggers we'll lend, ...
To give their darned masters a hiding.
Work up all our cotton at home,
Let not one more bale be exported,
Have the world at our feet, like old Rome
By the kings of the airth as was courted.
Want money? I reckon not we ;
A national debt we’ll create
Twice as heavy as yourn, which will be,
For SAMsons like we air, no weight.
On Government bonds we shall borrow
Any money in Europe with ease.
Why London and Paris, to-morrow
Will lend us as much as we please.
Foreign goods we shall purchase with paper,
Which let foreign usurers hold;
The British ma ºf: and vapour,
At home whilst we keep all our gold.
BELMONT to SEwARD has written,
Any stock may in Europe be “placed,” . .
And the chance, if the Rothschi LDs ain’t bitten.
Will be by the BARINGs embraced.
We’ve twice afore whipped all creation,
We’ve now got to whip it again.
We air a remarkable nation
Of modest, but resolute men.
John BULL, then, allow us to kick you,
And don't É. resenting the act,
Or into a cocked hat we’ll lick you,
Yes, Sir-ree, you old hoss, that’s a fact.
A Joke Never Comes Too Late
WE wonder that it had never occurred to us before—we,
who generally think of º and always at the very
right moment—that the Cabinet Council, which was con-
vened after the arrival of the news of the Yankee outrage
on the British flag, might appropriately be called “The
CouncIL of TRENT.”
PUNCH's MONEY ARTICLE.
UNLESS the armaments of France are considerably re-
duced, we would not advise our readers to subscribe to the
loan about to be, proposed by the new French Minister of
Finance. It will be the old stºry over again of “The
Fould and his money soon parted.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PEDALIAN V. MENTAL SUPERIORITY.
... IN those good old slow-coach times, when if you were sent to Bath
it took you three days to reach it, a Man's am ition was to be looked
up to, his social advancement depending not on his feet, but his head.
Poets, Philosophers, Prestigiators, glancing skywards, climbed the
unctuous pole of Fame. A queer revolution seems at length, however,
to have taken place of heels over head, instead of head over heels.
Celebrity is now attained per saltum, and the eyes of Europe are fixed
in wondering admiration, not on a lofty brow, but a Deer-foot. This
change in public feeling must be met by corresponding changes in our
public Institutions. Oxford and Čaj will soon be called upon
to widen their curriculum, and to recognise excellence in pedestrianism
as a matter of course. The Cantab then who can’t clear his ten miles
within an hour, may reckon himself plucked at his little gq. ...Penman-
ship will naturally be confined to a running hand, and if popular
education is not to be neglected, our posters must assume a bolder type,
that he who runs may read. Bills in the Commons we fondly hope
will pass through their different stages at a tremendous pace, and every
long-minded Member will be called upon by his breathless constituents
to furnish a running account weekly of his political progress. .
In private life we may anticipate seeing things placed on a novel
footing. Fortunes probably lost by a single step in the wrong direc-
tion but pleasures being of a cursory nature, if a bull surprises a
pic-nic party, just fancy what a run there will be on the banks. Every
exhausted testator may complacently look forward to the time when his
will shall be law, feeling how comfortable then will be his leg at ease.
Whether our warranted Manchester prints will be j by the
current movement, and betray a fugitive disposition in their Piº
we cannot **. to speculate; but of this we are assured, that the
colours of old England will stand fast in every clime, and prove worthy
of the heroes who clasping them have died. -
AMERICAN SPIRIT MERCHANTS,
THE work advertised as below would, we should think, if anybody
were wise enough to take it in, return the obligation:-.
“THE HERALD OF PROGRESS,
“ANDREw JAckson DAvis, EDITOR.
“A Cosmopolitan Journal of Reform, devoted to the discovery of Truth, and its
application to Physical and Spiritual Progress. Specimens sent free.
“Address, A. J. DAvis & Co., 274, Canal Street, New York.”
MR. ANDREw JAckson DAvis is a Medium who used to be called
the º: Seer, and to lecture on Cosmogony and Theology
whilst asleep in mesmeric trances. He has now, it appears, connected
himself with a “Co.; ” and we suppose that A. J. DAVIs and Co., are
carrying on business as importers of revelations and spiritual articles
in general from the other world. For importers read impostors, is a
suggestion which . occur to some of our readers. #. cocktail,
mini-julep, sherry-cobler, timber-doodle, , and such like, American
drinks, there is no reasonable objection; but is it possible that the
Yankees can swallow such stuff as that which is sold at A. J. DAVIs
and Co.'s Spirit Store?
A HEAVY FREIGHT.
Miss EMILY FAITH FULL is organising a plan for the “Emigration of
Educated Women.” For ourselves, we would sooner send away the
uneducated women, and keep those who were educated in the country.
We have not one too many. If, however, by the term “educated” is
meant “Strong-minded,” we will give our most cordial assent and
hearty co-operation, to a scheme, at once so useful and beneficent, and
one #. cannot fail to be for the benefit of all parties, as well as a great
relief to England. We would advise the Great Eastern being chartered
immediately for this purpose, and we do not mind giving a large sub-
scription in aid of it, providing the vessel sails at a very early period.
However, we pity the poor colony that receives the intellectual cargol
The only chance of its escaping this blue-stocking visitation is, that the
Strong-minded Women may quarrel amongst themselves on the .
out, of which there is the most natural probability; so, that when the
heavily-freighted | touches the shore, there may not be one of them
aliye, and nothing but their false back-hair, or magazine tales, left
behind them. By all means, let so interesting an experiment be carried
out, and to the greatest possible number.
Advice on the New Coimage to Cadgers.
WHEN you beg do not say, as you still continue doing, Gentleman'
—ar yer got ar a copper.” Leave off saying copper.” There are
no coppers now. You should ask for a “bronze.”
AN IMPROPER EXPRESSION.
THE QUEEN’s English, is in great danger of being permanently
debased by a vile word, which has lately been introduced into it—the
word “Reliable.” This base word was first coined in America, and
thence imported into this country. ... It is about the worst word, not
immoral, in the English language. Yet it is coming into very general
use; you can hardly open a newspaper wherein it does not occur; and
that even in leading articles written by educated men who qught to
know better than, at this crisis especially, to employ such an illiterate
Yankeeism.
As Rely is to Deny, so is Reliable to Deniable, Is it not? Deniable,
that may be denied. Reliable, that may be relied. But to say that a
report or an assertion may be relied, is to talk nonsense., , Intelligence
may be said to be capable of being relied on... But Reliable is not that
may be relied on, any more than Deniable is that may be denied on.
Åll manner of persons are hereby commanded, in the name of the
QUEEN, to cease from debasing HER MAJESTY's English by using the
spurious American solecism, Reliable; and, instead thereof, when they
want an adjective to signify that this or that statement may be depended
on, are advised to use the genuine English compound, Trustworthy.
GOOD N15 WS FROM AUSTRIA.
WE are happy to read that:—
“The EMPERoR of AUSTRIA has contributed the sum of 105 florins to the funds
of the National Life-Boat Institution.”
It is true that the above. Institution is a world-wide charity. All
º in distress have a claim on its generous exertions. The life-
oat, before issuing on its mission of mercy, does not pause to inquire
what nation the sufferers belong to. They struggle no less valiantly to
rescue the life of a Russian, or an Austrian, as that of an Englishman.
Still we are most grateful to both the EMPERORs of RUSSIA and Aus-
TRIA for expressing their high sense of the object, no less than the
value, of this glorious institution, by subscribing to its funds. May
France, Sweden, Italy, and other countries, that send out ships to
brave the perils of the seas, soon follow their meritorious example !
It is a duty they owe to the principles of universal charity. As for
FRANCIS-Joseph, we are so Fº with his recognition of the Insti-
tution’s services, that, should the wreck of the Austrian Empire ever
take place, we cannot do better than wish that one of these very life-
boats may be happily close at hand to save him, and carry him to some
haven of refuge # as secure and comfortable as England
MRS. DURDEN ON THE AMERICAN DIFFICULTY.
“THEM there nasty good-for-nothing Yankees' * cried old MRs.

MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.
THE Woolwich Academy is about to change its name to the MILI-
TARY Do-THE-Boys' HALL, since that title has been found infinitely
more in consonance with the Spartan fare and Draconian discipline that
are rigorously crammed down there. The Government is, we are
also informed, in treaty with a well-known Russian General, who has
governed in Siberia, and had some little experience in Poland, to under-
take the responsible duties of the military Hackford Squeers. B
those, who best know him, he is described as a regular “knout-and-
knouter.” Part of the new regimen to be introduced will be Brinstone
and Treacle twice a week. The Cadets will not be expected to bring
their own towels, as for the future there is to be an inexhaustible
supply of towelling on the premises, to be dealt out in the most
liberal manner, as occasion requires.
.AN EscAPE FROM THE FIx—The obvious way out of the American
difficulty is to set MR. SLIDELL with his companions at liberty forthwith,
and to make MR, MASON a Free-Mason.

WAITING FOR AN ANSWER,
BRITANNLA waits an answer. Sad and stern,
Her weapons ready, but unsheathed they lie:
In her deep eye, suppressed, the lightnings burn,
Still the war-signal waits her word to fly.
Wrong has been done that flag whose stainless folds
Have carried freedom wheresoe'er they flew :
She knows sharp words fit slaves and shrewish scolds,
She but bids those who can, that wrong undo!
She has been patient: will be patient still.
Who more than she knows war, its curse and woef
Harsh words, scant courtesy, loud-mouthed ill-will
She meets, as rocks meet ocean's fretful flow.
All war she knows drags horrors in its train,
Whate'er the foes, the cause for which they stand;
13ut worst of all the war, that leaves the stain
Of brother's blood upon a brother's hand.
The war that brings two mighty powers in shock,
Powers, ’tween whom fair commerce shared her crown:
By kinship knit, and interest's golden lock,
One blood, one speech, one past, of old renown.
All this she feels, and therefore, sad of cheer,
She waits an answer from across the sea:
Yet hath her sadness no alloy of fear,
No thought to count the cost, what it may be.
Dishonour hath no equipoise in gold,
No equipoise in blood, in loss, in pain:
Till they whom force has ta'en from 'neath the fold
Of her proud flag, stand 'neath its fold, again,
She waits in arms; and in her cause is safe;
Not fearing war, yet hoping peace the end,
Nor heeding those her mood who’d check or chafe;

MEMORANDUM FOR MANAGERS,
“MR., PUNCH, You would do the playgoing public some service if
you would request the managers of theatres to jº playbills, which
not those who run, but those who sit, can read. am not a very ol
fogy, and I can read your print easily enough without spectacles, but
to read a playbill bought in a theatre, with any comfort, I want a bull's-
eye held close to it, and the light turned on. The type is not only
wretchedly small, but also misèrably pale, and must to many in the
audience be quite invisible. This is a great discouragement to that
class of playgoers which includes .." humble servant, and others who
have charge of children that they might occasionally take to the
play.
*The present form of playbill is the extreme which has been run into
from its oppºsite, which the boxkeepers, used, to sell at one shilling,
calling it bill of the 'ouse, or 'ousebill. That was a masty flims
double sheet of something like º printed in great blac
letters, with ink that came off in the hands of the holder, and dis-
coloured white kid gloves. In that particular, however, its disadvantage
did not signify much to me, as I always wore, and still wear, black
cloth; and, in my opinion, that old bill which anyhow was legible, is
º to the new one, which has only the negative merit of not being
irty, and is no manner of use to “PATERFAMILLAs.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT."
EAR PUNCH,"
. ..."I HAVE been to see Othello
in the house that HAMLET built,
This may at first hearing sound
a little odd, but of course in
your omniscience you are aware
there were two HAMLETs; the
one a prince who lived in Den-
mark, and the other an English
}. eiler IIl Coventry Street,
London, who sank his fortune
in the raising of the Princess's
Theatre.
“Even if I’d hadno willingness
to go, I should have been so-
cially compelled to pay the visit.
At almost every party I’ve at-
tended for these six weeks,
eople have been asking of me
Have you seen FECHTER 2' or
else they have been taking it for
granted that I haye, and so in-
uiring whether I like him in
thello, and if I consider it
equal to his Hamlet. I can say
‘yes’ now to the two first of
these questions, but to the third
- ... I certainly must utter a flat
negative. Hamlet, as a dreamy meditative character, M. FECHTER to
my mind most admirably rendered. But the delicate bye-play which
he there used with such effect is of very little service in a part such as
Othello. The brave and fiery Moor, a soldier not a scholar, is not the
man to mark his varying emotions by the shrugging of a shoulder, or
the curling of a lip. Moreover, he is not a man of intellect but action;
and the subtleties employed, by M. FechTER in the part are scarcely
natural to the nature which he would represent.
“I, think too that his French peculiarities of utterance, fell still
more harshly, on my English ears when I heard him t'other night than
when I heard him in the summer. The dialogue in Hamlet is frequently
çolloquial, and here the foreign accent is more readily disguised than
in the impassioned language of Othello, who, throughout the play almost
ls #." the influence of either rage or grief. The undulating
cadence which M. FECHTER, uses grows somewhat wearying to unac.
customed ears; and his habit of prolonging the sound of certain
vowels has all the bad effect of an affected kind of drawling, and often
quite destroys the ji rhythm of a line. If M. FECHTER would
remember that our English ‘a’ and ‘o” are rightly diphthongs to the
French, and that no one but a swell now dreams of #. out his
words, T think he might do much to improve his faulty speech, and
thereby immensely add to the attractions his performances undoubtedly
possess. As it is, all SHAKSPEARE-lovers must feel pained to hear his
#. robbed of half its beauties, by mis-pronunciation, which not the
nest acting can make them shut their ears to, or be willing to condone.
MR., PHELPs, though apt at times to be heavy and monotonous, yet
speaks poetry, with feeling, and always gives a proper accent to his
words; and when, in Othello, he bids asa Hºf. his soldier's occu-
ation, one's soul is stirred by listening to the fine melodious lines.
But as M. FECHTER speaks them they quite fail of their effect, and one
is rather glad than sorry when the speech is done.
“In other points than those of mere articulation, I consider MR.
PHELPs's the best rendering of the character, whatever be the praise
(and it is º I give the other. His Othello is more dignified and
stately h bearing, more manly in his pathos, more fearful in his
wrath., M. FECHTER’s is too sentimental for a soldier, too, pettish in
his gestures when his º is wakened, and too placid, cool, and
logical for the fiery-blooded Moor. He first listens to Iago more with
Curiºus, wonder than with angry indignation; and when reason, as he
thinks, has been shown him for suspicion, he tails to give due force to
his torture at the blow. His delivery of the words "not a jot—not a
ot,’ expressive as it is, did not seem to me so touching as that of MR.
HELPs; who sobs them forth with painful difficulty, while he struggles
hard to hide the agony he feels. Then in the scenes that follow, M.
FECHTER vents his passion more in gesture than in voice, aud though
his gestures, I admit, are graceful and expressive, still such constant
i. of hands, however well directed, becomes a little tiresome—at
east to English eyes.
.“But it is in the fifth act that I am most disposed to quarrel with
his reading. True, he has had the good sense to listen to advice, and
no longer drags his wife across the stage before he smothers her. Still
the smothering is too much coram lo to please me, and seems vastly
more a ‘murder’ than it is a sacrifice.’ I prefer the old adherence to
the "Ne Medea' principle, of doing the dark deed behind curtain at the
back. The murder in Macbeth is all the more effective because it is
not seen, and I think the classic rule ºp. as fitly to Othello. I must
protest too against such an alteration of the text as taking out of Des:
demona's mouth the lovely ‘Willow’song, and making a street ballad of
it, chorussed, one may fancy, by a company of Waits. This prelude
sadly mars the silent terror of the scene, and gives an air of melodrame
to a most deeply tragic act. M. FECHTER is a clever man, but he is
not a SHAKSPEARE; and even if he were, he would have no right so to
alter what another Śāºrspººne wrote, "Nor is he justified, I think, in
his misreading of the text in the first sentence of this scene, and
addressing to a looking-glass that he finds lying on the bed the words
which are intended to satisfy his soul that the act he has resolved upon
is needful, right, and just. The words, as I should construe them,
mean that his wife's adultery is a sufficient cause for him to take away
her life. M. FECHTER misinterprets them as meaning that his face is
‘the cause’ of her disliking him, and consequent false faith... I think if
SHARspeARE had intended this idea to be conveyed, he would not have
made Othello apostropnise his “soul’ about the colour of his cheeks,
nor have appended to the stars, the epithet of ‘chaste.” What, pray,
has their chastity to do with his complexion?, and why need they be
shocked to hear his face is black? I am bound, to Nº. however, that
minds, doubtless wise as mine, think otherwise than I do in this matter
of the mirror; and one writer calls a ‘marvel of critical sagacity’ what
I incline to view as a most puerile conceit. -
“It may be thought from what I’ve said, that I find less to praise
than blame in M. FECHTER's new. Othello, but this is by no means what
I would wish to be inferred. His merits are so much more clearly
patent than his faults, that there is scarcely any need in me to point
them out; and as M. FechTER in his good sense and intelligence is so
apt at self-correction. I am the more inclined by my great reverence for
his talent to hint at his defects. Surely nobody can fail to notice the
fine touches that embellish every scene, j so much enhance the
naturalness of everything, he does. . It is in the tender passages that
his chief triumphs are achieved, and by what delicate detail he brings
forward into prominence Othello's loving nature, I can only briefly
summarise, but shall not soon forget. Especially shall I remember the
downcast look of shame with which he turns away his face when he
bids Iago “set his wife on to observe; and his glad start of love when
Desdemona shows her handkerchief, subsiding sadly into coldness when
he sees that it is not the one of which he is in quest. Nor can l fail to
recollect the second scene in the fourth act, where, as he sits with
Desdemona at his feet, her face between his hands, he endeavours for a
while to stifle his fell jealousy, and speaks with touching mournfulness
and tenderness of love.
“Nor is it merely as an actor that he commands my praise. . The
play, as now produced, is instinct with his intelligence, and (with the
exceptions I have noticed) there is evidence of careful thought and
taste in every scene. The senators no longer sit in solemn semi-circle
of immovable red baize, with their eyes all fixed on vacancy as though
they were all waiting to have their beards shaved off; nor do Iago and
the others follow the old rule, of always standing at the footlights to
deliver their set speeches, and never opening their lips until the atti-
tudes º y old traditions have been struck. By having exits
at the back, and chairs to sit upon, and posts to lean against when
talking, the scenes are nicely varied, and the action made more natural
and less heavily monotonous than in our tragedies, I fear, too often is
the case. Without making, the appointments the chief, magnet to
attract, M. FECHTER pays due care to the minutest detail, and with
his manager's assistance has “revived’ a play of SHAKSPEARE in a
very lifelike way. I think he feels the public have no right to be
satisfied with scenery alone, nor with the exhibition of one good actor
only, supported by mere sticks. He has therefore done his best, as I
believe, to drill the forces entrusted to his hands; and although there
still is room for much improvement, on the whole there is no doubt, he
has achieved a marked success. By turning his thoughts thus to other
parts besides his own (how MR. RYDER has been tamed by him.’tis won-
derful to see ) he has aimed a deadly blow at the odious ‘Star’ system;
for “stars too often fear to see a spark of intellect in others, lest it
may eclipse a single gleam of their own light. M. FECHTER shows,
however, that the small parts may be strengthened, and the stage
business well cared for, without diminishing the interest in the central
figure; and while I am sanguine in my hopes that he’ll do more, in the
drama's name I thank him for the good work he has done.
“ONE WHO PAYS.”
A Papal Bull.
AN. Irish paper, rabidly addicted to Papacy, as many Irish papers
are, states that “CAPTAIN VEsey's º will leave Bristol by special
train yesterday morning for Woolwich.” It may be presumed that this
is intended as a hint to the pantomimists, who are busy arranging their
materials for the forthcoming merry season. Such a sentence as the
above would certainly make an agreeable change for the Clown's worn-
out interrogatory, “How are you to-morrow?”

ADJUTANT. “Fall in ; and let me see a little of that “Superior Intelligence' we hear so much about.”
MODEL OF THE DISUNITED STATES.
AMONG the º of interest which America, whether we are to have
eace or war with the Yankees, is to contribute to the Exhibition of
862, will be a Model of the Model Republic. It has been made to
take to pieces, so as to exhibit not only the joinings of the several
States, and the separation between the North and the South, but also
the split which may at any time divide the West also from the
Federation.
The Model of the Model Republic will be marked with black over
the parts of it corresponding to those territories in which the Domestic
Institution is maintained. The Irish element will be indicated by spots
of mingled green and blood-red, and the German by patches of dirty
whity-brown. In the Model will be comprised plans of the Senate and
Congress, with, a fight going on on the floor of both. The action
of a Caucus and the working of the Ballot will be º together
with a specimen of a bogus Legislature. Facsimiles of Hard Shells,
Soft Shells, Hunkers, Barn Burners, and other statesmen of the
principal political denominations will also be included.
The Battle of Bull's Run will be faithfully rendered, even to the
cocked hat, into which the fugitives from that memorable engagement
said they were licked.
Among the many interesting features of the model will be accurate
representations of Spiritual Circles, Tables for Spirit º and
Spirits under the Tables, painting E." of flowers and other objects
in a few seconds; cigars and spittoons being provided for the use of
the Medium, the Spectators, and the Spirits.
The American Bar will also be shown, together with MR. Edwin
JAMEs, as he appeared when, he was called to it; and all manner of
genuine American drinks will be at hand, that any of those who are
viewing the Model of the Model Republic with a suitable disposition,
may liquor.

WHAT’s this 2 - -
In the Manifeur we read that the Chinese. Indemnity for the French
yictims of Chinese brutality, or their families, having been converted
into French money, and expenses deducted, the remainder has been
distributed in certain proportions duly set out in the Report of the
Ministers of War and Foreign Affairs. -
Was it a little bird that sung in Mr. Punch's car that the Indemnity
for the English victims of Chinese cruelty had long ago been paid into
the Treasury—but that no farthing of that money had yet reached a
victim, or the family of a victim P -
I am afraid the little bird sung to that tune, and that he repeats his
song; and moreover, that he adds to it a burden to this time:
“The Indemnity is with the Delhi prize money;
The bees of our hives when they’ve made, taste the honey:
But not so the bees of our Army and Navy–
Their share is the bones, moins the meat and the gravy.”
Oh, why isn't Mr. Punch's little bird in the House of Commons? If
he had only, £6,000 to spare, wouldn't he perch in Finsbury, and ask
the sweet voices of that pure constituency to utter themselves through
his little bill.
Unfortunately the Finsbury Electors would rather present their little
bill to their candidate, than see him offer his to them. So Mr. Punch's
little bird will have to whistle for a seat—till something offers at a
lower figure than Finsbury.
North and South.
It seems the Northerners have hopes, by blockade of the ports, to
starve the South into subjection. But we think it will be long ere the
Secessionists are forced to cry out “Fºdus /?” which in that case might
be translated “Feed us:” and we shall about as soon expect to see
them entering the workhouse as re-entering the Union.

A RECEIPT FOR ENAMELLING LADIES” FACES.
A FRENch CoMTE, of well-known gallantry in the fashionable circles
of both capitals, says that, after all, the best enamel for a lady's face is
a delicate compliment, one that has an artistic touch of truth, or poetry
in it. The application, he says, most successfully raises a beautiful
roseate blush-nature's own ...”.h. no artificial composition, or
the vulgar hand of imitation, can possibly approach, or surpass. More-
over, it does no injury to the complexion, but on the º rather
improves it. Of course, the compliment must be laid on with a light
hand-for instance, the hand of a true-born gentleman; for if any black-
guard, or ce que vous appelez SNoB, should venture to attempt it, he is
sure to do it so clumsily—avec une telle gaucherie—that the failure be-
comes, not only ludicrous, but most painful. In such a case, the roseate
blush instantly turns to crimson indignation. To make an unpoetic
comparison, it is all the difference, he says, between a rose-leaf and
F. ed"cabbage. Öur gallant Comte, who has evidently studied in the
est schools of Fashion, is pained to confess, however, that this charming
experiment, which rarely fails on the cheeks of fair demoiselles, meets
but seldom with gratifying success, when tried on the sallow teint of
ladies who have passed a certain age. The conclusion he comes to on
this latter point is, we must admit, for one of his refined taste, slightly
tinged with harshness:– “Wellum (he says), to be illuminated properly,
requires the strongest colours.”
A Great Bore in an Omnibus.
At this wet and dirty season of the year, men sitting in an omnibus
frequently sustain some little inconvenience, in having every now and
then their knees brushed, by a lady who gets into the vehicle, with her
enormous skirts, on which she has swept up a lot of mud in the streets,
and necessarily wipes it off upon their trousers. It is high time that
omnibuses should be made four times as broad as they are now, in
order that the extravagant apparel of the female passengers may be
consistent with the comfort and cleanliness of the others, who may be
unwilling to ride outside to oblige a lady, or unable to do so even with
the view of avoiding a nuisance.

WF copy the following paragraph from an article in the Nation Irish newspaper, written in
anticipation of a war between this country and America:-
*Yes, then will the forces of England find in their front such desperate men as crushed their ranks at Fontenoy
to the cry of “Remember Limerick.' Yes, the men crowbarred out of their homes in Ireland; the men oppressed,
insulted, scoffed at, and, wherever they went, pursued by English slander, scorn, and hate—those men will be in
the van of the fight, and then will woe come to England! And what of freiana'in this t time? What will
Irishmen do when comes this º: opportunity, the like of which can only come once in many ages? We can
tell what they may do, what they will be able to do, if they act well their part as brave men, they can, most

A FINSBURY WOTER'S LAMENT.
To Mr. Punch.
-- SIR
DEEPLY as I sympathise with Bel-
gravian Mothers, I cannot but feel that there
are woes more deserving of public commisera-
tion than those of which they so .
complain. I have, Sir, at my command seven
able and aspiring orators. They have all
sown their radical oats, and are anxious to
settle down as Representative. Men, if they
can form a suitable political alliance, but un-
happily the balance at their bankers does not
exceedſ 2,800 each. They assureme that an
union with the daughter of the late General
Reform (Lady Finsbury) would ensure their
unqualified happiness for years (barring Mini-
sterial accidents). Borne down, however, by
a painful recollection of their monetary un-
worthiness, they dare not so much as look
the gorgeous widow in the face. She, Sir,
who has not girlish gaiety to plead in her
defence, meantime coquettes with a group of
timid and adoring admirers in a manner that
makes my bloodtingle-now smiling on one,
now beckoning to another—now sh her
fan at a third-anon sighing with well simu-
lated affection for a fourth. Sir, as an old and
consistent Reformer, I ask is there no cure
for this crying grievance? Is political as well
as nuptial felicity to be bound up in a ban-
ker's book? Are the amiable three percents
to be consulted before our sense of legislative
responsibility? Is the balance of power
insignificant compared with the power of the
pence? Is access to the House barred by
ſº and silver sticks in waiting, and is the
est seat reserved for the man who, carries
an air-cushion, and can raise the wind to fill
it? These, Sir, are solemn questions, and I
earnestly commend them to your, considera-
tion as our Country's Guide, Philosopher,
and Friend, Let me, Sir, in conclusion, re-
mind you that old Sarum, for her iniquities
was cast into Schedule A3 and though f
should regret to see Lady F. with her, pecu-
liar fascinations similarly treated, I do not

WHELRs. . º he will go on ray-
#& in this manner for hours together:-
“No wonder, Sir, that such a piratical son of
a gun should be popular with the New York
mob, for if you notice, Sir, the populace
always had a low tastefor WHELRs! For my-

How should the Princes die?
With red spur deep in maddening charger's flank,
Leading the rush that cleaves the foeman’s rank,
And shouting some time-famous battle-cry?
Ending a pleasure day,
Joy's painted goblet fully drained, and out,
While wearied vassals coldly stand about,
And con new homage which they long to pay?
So have the Princes died.
Nobler and happier far the fate that falls
On Him who 'mid yon aged Castle walls,
Hears, as he goes, the plash of Thames's tide.
Gallant, high-natured, brave,

No nobler knight had won the minstrel's praise,
Than he, for whom the half-reared banners wave.

The song, the pencil, and the lyre his own,
Deigned he to live fair pleasure's thrall alone,

DECEMBER FOURTEENTH, 1861.
Better and nobler fate
His, whom we claimed but yesterday,
His, ours no more, his, round whose sacred clay,
The death-mute pages and the heralds wait.
It was too soon to die.
Yet, might we count his years by triumphs won,
By wise, and bold, and Christian duties done,
It were no brief eventless history.
This was his princely thought :
With all his varied wisdom to repay
Our trust and love, which on that Bridal Day
The Daughter of the Isles for dowry brought.
For that he loved our QUEEN,
And, for her sake, the people of her love,
Few and far distant names shall rank above
His own, where England's cherished names are seen.
Could there be closer tie
Twixt us, who, sorrowing, own a nation's debt
And Her, our own dear Lady, who as yet
None had more lightly sped the laughing hours.
When with a kind relief
Those eyes rain tears,
Him whom she loved
And will not be denied to share her grief.
Must meet her sudden woe with tearless eye:
O might this thought employ!
we loved. We shared her joy,
THE IRISH YAHOOS.
A GRAND Meeting of Yahoos was held yesterday at the Pope's Head,
for the purpose of expressing joy and exultation at the prospect of the
war ºil.". is i.i. likely to be involved in with America,
The Chair was taken by the O'DoNogHYAHOO, one of the principal
representatives of the Yahoos in Parliament. . - -

gibbering, chattering, and other demonstrations of º: When
The noise had subsided, he began raving, and continued for nearly an
hour, pouring forth torrents of foul but almost inarticulate abuse of
the Saxon, as he was understood, as well as his sputtering and slavering
enabled him to be, to style the object of his malignant invective,
meaning England and the English. His discourse terminated with a
succession of shrieks and yells resembling those of a hytºna impatient
for his carrion, and he sat down foaming at the mouth. The conclusion
of the honourable Yahoo's address was hailed with frantic howling and
peals of convulsive laughter, like that of a multitude of violent idiots.
Orations in a similar tone and spirit, full of sound and fury, were
delivered by MR. O'RANGOUTANG, MR.G. O'RILLA, M.R. FITzcALIBAN,
and other eminent Yahoos, who gloated on the calamities which they
anticipated for England, and expressed, as far as they were intelligible,
the most truculent animosity to the British Soyereign, and people.
MR. O'RANGouTANG created an immense sensation by brandishing a
dagger, to indicate how he would like to serve the alien oppressor,
in which performance he nearly cut his own throat, to the great
diversion of the assembly.
After giving several rounds of hurroos for the POPE and CAPTAIN
WILKs, and of shouts and yells for LORD PALMERSTON and JoHN
BULL, the concourse of Yahoos separated gnashing their teeth, and
retired to their dens, whooping, shrieking, and uttering the most blood-
thirsty execrations. Going home, many of them, in, the frenzy of their
malice, threw themselves down in the dirt and rolled in it like dogs, hurt
yelping, whining, and howling, after the manner of the lower orders of
the canine species, to which the Yahoo is nearly allied, being a creature
between the mongrel and the baboon.

docile race had become extinct, but the following advertisement,
which Mr. Punch cuts from a provincial newspaper, shows that there
are still persons who know how to behave respectfully under aggra-
Vating circumstances:–
ENTLEMAN RUN OVER TIN CLAYTON SQUARE. If the
Ladies who were in the Carriage when it was driven over an old Gentleman in
Clayton Square, on Monday last, between the hours of Twelve and One, desire to
know how he is,...they are invited to send to No. 34, Seymour Street.
Nothing can be more lº. than this old gentleman, and his delicate
way of informing the ladies of his address savours of the manners o
the old school. We do not—no—we will not do such wrong to human
nature as to suppose, that he inserts, the advertisement under the
advice of some fiendlike attorney, who has failed to find out the
address of the ladies, and hopes to catch them this wº with a view
to legal damages. No, we repudiate, the thought. , The affair is a
bit of the manners of the high-bred school of other days. There was
to be a splendid masked ball, at the court of the excellent Louis XIV.,
and all the world worth mentioning was wrapped up in the costumes,
and dying for the splendid ſite. A young Count, from Provence,
was to be one of the most brilliant of the maskers. Three hours before
the fête, comes to him, dustily, a servant from the provincial chateau,
and informs him that his Lordship's father is deceased. “You are a
vulgar fellow, FRANCOIs,” blandly replies the young, nobleman, “and
you º the nobility by the standard of the canaille. My father is
too much of a gentleman to die at such a moment. Come to me in the
morning.” The old gentlemán of Qlayton Square must surely be a
descendant of the high-bred young Count. We hope he wasn’t much
English and American Bulls.
AN English Bull's run calls aloud to beware
Of his horns, ever prºmpt to assail,
But a Yankee Bull's Run is another affair;
And creates most alarm by his tail.

ENLARGING THE AREA OF A POLICEMAN'S
DUTIES.
A DEPUTATION of Berkshire Magistrates waited on SIR GEORGE
GREY last Thursday for the purpose of obtaining information respect-
ing the views of Government on the question of agricultural statistics.
The general feeling of the meeting was opposed to the Police being
employed to collect the latter. MR, WALTER, M.P., said:—
“If the Police were only to be employed to deliver the notices and to collect them
when filled up, some persons asked why should not that be done through the Post-
office or the overseers. People suspected some mystery when the agency of the
Police was used."
We can easily imagine what the “mystery” in the minds of most
persons would be. It would take the form (if nothing worse) of an
inquisitorial inquiry into the provisional government of the establish-
ment. No Englishman's castle would ever be safe. It would be
liable at all times to an invasion from the Police—the part of the
Castle that would command his best attention being, of course, “the
p.
In fact, if a gentleman were to find a Policeman in his kitchen, and
the latter were to excuse himself by saying, “Please, Sir, I’ve called to
collect agricultural statistics,” we do not see what the master of the
house could say against it, even though the débris of the enjoyed love-
feast were still lying on the table tº protest against the truth of his
story. The above handy excuse will be as good as a latch-key to a
Policeman to let himself in to a country gentleman's house as often
as he pleases, . The reports he will make afterwards will be most
..". of their kind. They will be as pleasant as the reports of
squibs that boys scatter amongst each other for their amusement. We
can imagine a party of these large blue-coat boys, bounding with
pleasure over the explosion of one. How they would laugh, and jump,
º through a “perfect cure” of delight!
…We gangonceive the repºrt taking some such form as the following;
This 'ere is to testify that I have been to SQUIRE BROADACRE's farm, and
these are the agricultural statistics that I have been able to collect
there. He keeps three servants, of which one is a Cook. She is about
twenty-five, and has two chins, besides a strawberry mark on her right
harm. The beer is uncommon good. There are hot, joints twice, a
week. The housemaid has the making of the toast. The best day for
calling is Sunday, as they mostly always has company up-stairs. The
lady's made wears false hare. Cheese only good for Welsh rabids,
Missus locks up tea and sugar, pickles and spirits. Family goes to bed

PATIENCE AND PREPARATION.
“IET us be calm,” say you, John BRIGHTP
Oh yes, we will be calm;
But that we may not have to fight,
We'll show that we can arm.
By meek submission to a blow
You make a bully brave;
But if a ready fist you show,
Your pardon he will crave.
Yes, life is precious, useful gold,
No. idly to be lost;
| But if we would our honour hold,
We must not count the cost.
We seek no quarrel: but, if war
Befoully on us thrust,
Unneryed it shall not find us, nor
With sword made blunt by rust.
We wait their answer calmly, but
With hand upon the hilt:
If they the gate of peace would shut,
Be theirs alone the guilt.
The Fellow for Finsbury.
THE Electors of Finsbury have not as yet
|ſound a Liberal candidate to their mind. The
sort of Liberal that the free and independent
| electors of that incorruptible borough would
like to get hold of, is one that would be will;
ing to stand a contested election, and spend
£6,000.
A CAUTION To SINNERs.--According to a
popular saying, the Evil One looks over LIN-
colN. Yes, and he seems also to have his eye
on SEWARD
at eleven. Beware of the big dog in the yard let lose always at the
same time. Cooks wages is ten lbs. a-year, and a bottle, of,gin on
Christmas day with missusses’ hold close. Examined the larder, and
this is what I found inn side. Breast of wheel, very low. Dish of cold
potaties, 10 and a bit. Likewise of melted butter with parsley. Small
muckel of am, in very bad cut. Side of baking. . 2 Ropes of unmiongs,
loaf of bread, 1 plate of salt butter, 3 red earrings, and box of omn-
hovy paste. The family also keeps a gig, a cat, a 8 day clock, a pony,
a boy in the stable, a parrot, a pig, and a peramblehater. They, dines
at four o'clock—broken scraps only on the Saturday. They washes at
home, takes the plate basket up to bed with them, ill-treats the servants,
Never pºs until their maid to pay, and goes to church twice on the
Sunday.” -
We have slightly altered the above report, so as to make it commonly
intelligible, for the Police are not always distinguished men of letters.
However, it says quite enough, we contend, to prove the expediency
of keeping Commissioner MAYNE's busy corps of blue-bottles out of
our larders and households. A Policeman is a wolf that every English-
man should struggle to keep from his door.
The Police were instituted to apprehend persons and not facts. Only
let this prowling agricultural commission be established in their favour,
and we shall soon be requiring a companion to. M. Migh ELET's ful-
minating book of “Priests, Women, and Families,” to be written in
order to denounce the paul-prying evil; and a mot inappropriate
title for such a counterblast against the encroachments of Scotland
Yard would be “PolicEMEN, SERVANTs, AND FAMILIES.”. We dor’t
want the Peeler to perform in England the character the Prêtre is
supposed to fill in France.
High Church and Low Language.
LATELY has been published the fourth edition of a work entitled
Crispin Ken, by the author of Marian May, with a New Chapter, A
Word to Churchmen. It is to be feared that Crispin Ken is more likely
to suggest a new phrase to costermongers: “Ken,” in the language of
the lower orders, is an abode, and “Crispin” everybody knows to be a
name for a shoemaker. Crispin Ken is a title which will most likely be
borrowed by vulgar persons from a genteel Church novel, and appro-
priated to a cobbler's stall.
A CoNTRAst.—English character personified is John BULL. That
of America is embodied in JonATHAN BULLY.

calculated to im-

acquisition. The cultivation of that noble artisingtincºmpatible with
the study of the liberal sciences; its students would not beat Latin and
Greek out of each other's knowledge boxes nor is it to be feared that
they would proceed to punch the Heads of Houses. Such º

Some º the Oxford students will have, one of these days, to stand up
for the Thirty-Nine Articles, and other, important stakes. Sºme
divines are heavy; but, heavyweights or light weights, they will be
none the worse"for knowing the use of their hands; and pesides, in
learning to box they would be schooled, in fighting with temper: a
point too much neglected in theological education,
Weregret to see that in the edict prohibiting the resort of the youn
Oxonians to MR. SAYERs's establishment, that gentleman was describe
as “a person named SAYERs.” What would be º: of any one
who should talk of a person named Pusey The Anglican champion
is a celebrated clergyman; but his renown is not greater than that of
the Champion of #. and the antagonist of HEENAN deserves to
be spoken of with respect, as MR. SAYERs, or MR.THoMAs SAYERs;
or if “Mr. SAYERs” be accounted as absurd as “MR. Cºsas,” then
let reverend gentlemen, as they say JULIUS CAESAR, so with becoming
consideration, speak of MoM SAYERs.
A SMASH FOR A SENSATIONIST.
An amiable and truth-loving correspondent ºf the Standard, who
dates his letters from New º: and signs himself “MaNHATTAN,” has
been giving such a rose-coloured description of America, that onesighs
to think that one has not the great happiness of living there. Among
other things to tempt one to emigrate as soon as one can get the chance,
is this attractive hint as to the power of the President, which “MAN-
HATTAN” may of course be trusted in divulging:-
“Those prisoners committed to the great prisons will die in them. It rests
entirely with the President whether they are ever brought to trial or not. If he
thinks it better for the public interest that such traitors as Mason and SLIDELL
should be imprisoned for life, he can have it so. This will be the fate º of
most of the leading traitors. The successors of Luscots will probably take the
same view of it. GENERAL Jackson, when President, kept a man, who had annoyed
#: . º for eight years, by merely ordering the district attorney not to bring
- trial."
We hope a º of the paper which contains this º statement
will be sent to GENERAL Jackson as soon as may be possible, for we
cannot but believe that it will be a bit of news to him to hear of the
nice conduct of which he is accused. Were we disposed to view “MAN-
HATTAN” as otherwise than one who is a stranger to veracity, we might
lift our eyes in wonder that the head of a republic so free and fond of
º as that of the United—or rather Untied-States should bein-
vested with a power over people who “annoy him” as complete as any
* ever wielded with the bowstring, the knout, or the Bastile.
ith a boastful word or two about the kidnapping of Messieurs
Mason and SLIDELL, and delicately stating that it “quickly took the
starch out of them,” and that." when they came in sight of the fort
that was to be their future prison and probable tomb, the chin of
MAson dropped and the knees of both gave way,” the amiable
-- HATTAN” gives us some advice as well as news about our Con-
º LoRD PALMERston will doubtless, be thankful for and
prout by:-
“The English Goveruuaut ought to reuovo all its Consuls fruiu the Southern
ports. They have been the great promoters of the rebellion, and as fast as they are
caught, they will be locked up. Government has enormous quantities of proof
against every one of them. It will keep; but the fact that these men are agents
of England only makes their crime the greater. There will be a great quantity of
fun before long.”
The amiable, “MaNHATTAN” has grim notions of a joke. What sort
# º ” he is expecting may be easily inferred from the paragraph
at tollows :-
“W. J. YANCEY has written to a female friend who has the ear of the President,
requesting her to sound the latter, and see what terms the President would grant
him. The President refused to read the letter or hold any conversation on the
subject, except to say the only officer of this Government who will hold speech with
that traitor will be the United States Marshal that hangs him. You can rest assured
of one thing, within six months a demand will be made upon every Government in
Europe that harbours criminals to give them up. LoRD PALMERsron will have the
pleasure of delivering up Yancey and Mason, if they do not escape from London."
. Of course we need not say that we believe that every syllable of this
is strictly true. In confirmation of its verity we may add, that we have
learned, through a source quite as reliable, º when the hint dropped
§ the President was brought to the States hangman, that “officer of
the Government” expectorated twice with a marked gaiety of manner,
and after liquoring up a Sling, a Stone Wall, and a Corpse-Reviver, he
merrily danced forth into the middle of the room, and sang a pleasant
little song with this agreeable refrain :-
“it would iſ utte with jamtºp oligº olju
Qºm a mite blatt º trul olyg' ol,
ºłith a small trapºgor,
&that jog to be ſuit; Hantºgº"
While one is about it, one may as well be fully circumstantial in one's
lies; and we feel somewhatsurprised that the amiable “MANHATTAN”
should give such bare and meagre details of the facts º which he relates.
But what we wonder at still more is that such ribald, lying letters...as
those which he indites should be inserted in large type in any English
. , and that, inspite of them, that journal should continue to be
SOICl.
THE AMERICAN DILEMMA.
You R passion and arrogance, JonATHAN, bridle,
And let me know what you call Mason and SLiDELL.
Are they rebels? What right, if you take that position
Had you, boarding the Trent, to demand extradition?
Had MITCHELL and MEAGHER been SLIDELL and Mason,
We you, and you we, would you think no disgrace on
Your flag had been cast, its protection from under
If we those two traitors had taken, I wonder?
Belligerents call you the men you laid hand on
And the charge of high treason against them abandon? - -
Were we fighting the French, then you’d have no objection
To our seizing French envoys beneath your protection.
Moreover, as prisoners of war if you take them,
And therefore their country’s ambassadors make them,
You put yourselves then into this situation;
You are first to acknowledge the Confederation.
THE POPE'S BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
THE British Public is requested to take notice that MR. LAIRD,
Derbyite, has been returned for Birkenhead, in preference to the
Liberal candidate MR. BRAssex; by what influence will appear from
the subjoined paragraphs of election intelligence:-
“Notwithstanding the most arduous efforts on the part of the Liberal
were unable to recover the lost ground, and the poll closed, giving
mººrity of 328.
“There was considerable excitement, owing to the religious element being largely
introduced, the Roman Catholics of Birkenhead, with the Rev. Canon Chapman at
their head, actively supporting the Tory candidate, MR. Laird, and his return is
undoubtedly attributable to the course taken by this section of the electors.”
Elsewhere it is stated that:—
“At the polling a body of two hundred Roman Catholics, headed by Caxon CHAP-
MAN, were ostentatiously paraded in support of MR. Lamp. This demonstration
was, no doubt, intended as a rebuke to the supporters of Her Majesty's Ministers,
for the liberal policy pursued in regard to Italy, and as a proof of practical concur-
rence with the lucubrations of the Bishops of ORLEANs and Potosters, and other
supporters of the temporal power of the Pope.”
So MR, LAIRD owes his election to yoters who send him to the
House of Commons in the hope that he will support the government of
the Pope and oppose that of Loan PALMERstós. The ſº of
LoRD, DERby and that of his Holiness are much the same thing
according to the papists of Birkenhead. Let this be remembered, when
a vacancy occurs elsewhere, by electors who value the liberty of Italy
and the honour and interest of England.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 251
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
thank Miss PYNE
MR. BALFE, and
MR. HARRison for a
very pleasant even-
ing with The Puri.
tan's Daughter. The
night when I at-
tended was the first
one of the Cattle
Show, but I cannot
say the audience pre-
sented any symp-
toms of a marked
bucolic character.
There were neither
beefy faces nor thick
top boots in the pit,
nor did the audience
in general betray a
rural origin by ap-
plauding in wrong
places, and so put-
ting the actors out.
The rustic mind,
I fancy, receives
much more enjoy-
ment from the song-
sters of the supper-room than the singers of the . Opera, and the
Wondrous LEOTARD is far more likely to attract it than the melodies
of BALFE and the scenery of CALCOTT. . --- -
“Not being (thank goodness!) a musical, critic, and in consequence
obliged to keep my ears upon the stretch to catch all failings and
defects, I enjoyed #. opera much, and need not hesitate to say so, for
I’ve no character for critical acerbity to lose. Without quite endors-
ing the opinion of one writer, that the name of BALPE stands first of all
English composers, whether of the past or of the present, time, I
always take a pleasure in listening to his music, and his latest work is
even more than usually pleasant to me. If I am wrong in ranking it
as his best composition (not even excepting the ever-green Bohemian
º I would ascribe my error to the care of MR. MELLON in getting
up the opera, and the generally efficient way in which it is, pe Örmed.
#. who recollect how English Opera was treated in the days of MR.
BUNN, should go to Covent Garden and hear MR. MELLON's orchestra,
and notice with what taste the accompaniments are played. Another
thing, too, they may notice is, that now-a-days some pains are taken
with librettos, and that the ballads Mr. Bair; has now to set to music
are not such Bedlamitish bosh, as they were in the old time, when
“hollow hearts’ were nightly said to ‘wear a mask,’ though how on
earth they did so nobody could guess. Despite inanely stupid words,
and though the street-organs have done their worst to make me hate
it, I still retain a lingering, love for the Bohémienne aforesaid; but for
the freshness of its melodies, the Daughter of the Puritan is quite
worthy to be named with it, and they have the further charm of not
being quite, so whistleable, so that, our butcher-boys, one hopes, will
not so easily get hold of them. Clever critics may object that the
melodies, though pretty, are all cast in the same mould, and may exer-
cise their memories by humming a chance phrase and recalling a twin-
brother in some other Balfeian work; but for myself, I am quite satis:
fied with simply listening to the music, in my unenlightened way, and
not attempting to determine whether MR. BALFE º himself (as
most writers have done), or in what precise degree he falls short of the
ºº:: of the continental schools. -
“But whatever be the doubt as to the merits of the opera, there
surely can be none as to the manner of its production... The band is so
well drilled that one might almost shut one's eyes, and think that Apollo
was conducting it; and the singers one and all do their best towinsuccess
and deservedly secure it. Miss PyNE's delicious voice is heard to full
advantage in a part exactly suited to her, and her extremely graceful
gestures are a study which our choristers, would do well to try and
imitate, instead of singing as they mostly do with arms stuck to
their sides like the dolls in a Noah's;ark. MR. ISON moreover,
as the rakish Earl of Rochester, played a rollicking drunken part in a
manner that surprised, not less than it pleased me. His song in praise
of punch all punch-lovers should hear. The minor key redeems it from
all shade of vulgarity; and indeed, his acting, no less than his singing,
is so free from any coarseness, while yet so droll and funny, that many
a ‘comic’, actor might well receive a lesson from it. . As for MR.
SANTLEy, the Fº air in all the opera is put into his mouth, and
he sings it with such taste (as he does all his other music) that, much
as I hate, detest, and execrate encores, I really was not sorry when the
pitites re-demanded it. Besides having the merit of a plot which is
original and yet easily intelligible, (a merit which most operas of late
have been without), the new work has the novelty of a lover who sings
bass; and one might well incline to wish the precedent were followed,
if, one were always certain of a voice like SANTLEY's in parts
wherein a tender tenor” usually is heard.
“What is going on at the Strand and the St. James's ‘and Olympic
and elsewhere, I may have occasion to s of in my next. Doubtless
all these theatres have been profiting by the Cattle Show, but Iquestion
if their takings equalled those at the Adelphi. Here, as I am told, the
old familiar Colleen Bawn notification of *Hºus. CRAMMED’ has been
displayed º the week, in consequence of the revival (though
it seems a ‘bull’ to call it so) of that immortal drama. R. and
MRs. BoucICAULT have had a hard week's work in playing the Colleen
and Octoroon together, but one really can’t much pity them when one
recollects the pay they have been earning. One would almost undertake
the labours of Hercules upon such good terms.
“By the way, I must just add that in her history of the week, the
Clio of the stage ought certainly to note that, in obedient compliance
with the wishes of the º expressed through “hourly' waggon-
loads of letters to the author, the last act of the Octoroon has partly
been re-written, and the drama is now brought to a felicitous conclu-
sion. Poor MR. BoucicaulT | It must have cost him a sad struggle
so to mutilate his offspring, and, to please a fickle public, destroy the
moral aim and teaching of the pla . I drop a tear as I remember his
letter to the Times, and think what º he must have suffered in
altering his work: Yet, much as Iapplaud his wish to give ourd laygoers
a lesson in morality, I must say I rejoice that, he has bowed to their
opinion that they’d rather be without it. Suicide is alwaysanul pleasant
and immoral act to contemplate; and Ishall go and see the Octomoon with
vastly greater willingness, now that a marriage peal is substituted for a
cup of poison, and ty a few strokes of the goose-quill the fair heroine
is saved from the task of nightly suffering a very painful death.
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
PHOTOGRAPHIC CARICATURES AT ROME.
IN a letter from Rome it is stated that—
“The official journal of Y. contains an edict from the Cardinal Vicar
announcing that no one will be allowed to exercise the art of photography without
authorisation from the Rev. Master of the Sacred Palace, from the Cardinal Vicar,
and from the police, under penalty of 50 dollars fine. Amateur Photographers are
liable to the same regulation.”
... A maternal government imposes this restriction on the personal
liberty of its subjects, because some of them abuse the photographic
art., Provision for the punishment of offenders in that kind, one woul
think, would suffice to meet the case; and their correction has been
tolerably well provided for by the arrangements thus specified:–
“The producers and distributors of indecent gº. plates are to lose their
instruments, to be fined 100 dollars, and to sent to the galleys for a year; the
i. penalty to be inflicted on the models who may have served for such produc-
ons."
Serve them right. But what cause has the Roman public to thank
the papal Government for giving it the benefit of an improvement on
LoRD CAMPBELL's Act 2 We further read that—
“It is stated that this edict . . . was absolutely called for by the recent
clandestine publication of some very scandalous photographic representations in
which the heads of the Pope, CARd1NAL ANToNElli, the QUEEN or NAPLEs, and
other persons of high rank, were placed on the bodies of other individuals in such a
skilful manner as to deceive any spectator, and with such a disregard not only to
º, but also to decency, as fully justifies the measures adopted by the dº
icar."
Would his Eminence have interfered with the licentious photo-
graphers if they had placed the heads of GARIBALDI, VICTOR-EMMANUE
the EMPERoR of THE FRENCH, LoRD PAIMERSTON, JOHN BULL, an
Mr. Punch, in the same vile relations as those in which they put the
upper storeys of ANTONELLI, the QUEEN OF NAPLEs, and, his Holiness,
or in any relations however vile?...And if the head of the Pope were
put on the body of a figure in pontificals blessing a Neapolitan brigand
that of the QUEEN of NAPLEs on the shoulders of Moll Flagon, an
ANTONELLI's on those of Fra Diavolo, would not the Cardinal Vicar
consider the photographs so composed as exhibiting a grievous dis-
regard to decency as well as to delicacy? It is no doubt sacrilege as
. as high treason at Rome anyhow to take of the head of the
Church. What a wonder the Sun lends himself to such an enormity!
Cannot PIUs excommunicate PHOEBUs?
A Queer Sort of Cow.
A, “GARDENER” in the Times, wanting a place, advertises that he
would “Not object to a cow if single-handed.” Who would?"Who
would object to a cow with two hands, for the matter of that? In-
deed two hands would be better than one for a cow to have, -and such
a cow, instead of being at all objectionable, would be far preferable to
any other; if her hands enabled her owner to dispense with a milkman.

A DISH OF LAWA,
We are disappointed with Wesuvius. We had hoped better, things from that old

so excited by the state of affairs in taly as to lend himself to the general perturba-
tion. But he has burst out into a furious eruption, and is frightening away the
ple, and swallowing upyillages, just as the Dragon of Wantley used to do. It
is inconsiderate, and what is worse, it is self-humiliating. We would apologise for
the old mountain, but hardly know what to say. Does he recollect the days when
SPARTAcus, with a band of slaves and gladiators, took possession of his fastnesses?
and does he think the Italian brigands of our day º; to fill the place of men
who fought for freedom? Does he remember that in 472 he sent his ashes as far
as Constantinople, according to the historians, and does he want to give the SULTAN
APDUL-Aziz a hint that he will have to put other ashes on his head if he does not
mind what he is about? We are not in the old crater's confidence, and cannot
say; but unless he can give a very good reason for his inflammatory conduct, we
do not think that he is behaving well to Italy. He has destroyed that unlucky
orre del Greco exactly twenty-five times, and there is a monotony, arguing aridit
of intellect, about his proceedings. We scorn to hint to him that there are sever
quacks in Éngland who advertise remedies against all eruptions, and that we should
have no objection to throw such remedies, and the advertisers, into his chasms,
though such is our feeling. His years and history entitle him to reverence–Shake-
sperially speaking,
“Respect forthy great place, and let the -Mountain

But if Wesvius, alias Wesevus, alias Vesuvius, has any good feeling in his inwards
he will be º for the present. We suspect the old rebel does not like goo
sovereigns: his first break-out was under Titus, the Delight of Mankind, and his
last is under Victon-EMMANUEL, who may not be perfect

century. We fear the Mountain has the revolutionary

SAVING THE OCTOROON.
Upon the couch she lies so pale-

Grant us this public boon; , , ,
If cats are blessed with nine-fold lives,
Give two to her, this pearl of wives,
Don't kill the Octoroon/
There still is time: that negress might
By the uncertain moon -
A phial give, which though to sight .
The same, would op'rate different quite,
Nor kill the octºroon?
McClosky fall'n by Indian blow,
(Or to fall very soon)
Cannot appear to bid her go,
Then why that fact not let her know,
And save the Octoroon.
True Peyton has another flame,
Is somewhat of a spoºn;
But give him up, Miss What's your-name,
You must admif'twould be a shame
To kill the Octoroon.
So say I, and the public voice
Sings to the self-same tune,
It’s not as if you had no choice-.
Why break the hearts you can rejoice?

Don't tellus that the thing must be,
You’re far too 'cute a 'coon;
- To be so reg’lar up a tree
You can't find a catastrophe
That saves the Octoroon.
Of law supreme, fate, and such rot,
Preach on from this to June;
I say—necessity or not-
Poor Zoe must not go to pot-
Don't kill the Octoroon/
What if your logic comes to grief,
When thus your play º prune?
I still insist on the relief, -
Both to º and handkerchief-

Untruth to manners I'll admit,
Though clear as sun at noon; .

ords of the Admiralty and the Commander-in-Chief, in order to the
adoption of means for supplying this, deficiency, should it unfortunately
occur. Without entering, into details, (as the whole arrangement may
be rendered unnecessary by the arrival of Messrs. Mason and Širogiº,
about the 28th December) Mr. Punch begs to say, that in the event of
the Federals declining to send contributions to the Exhibition, the space
now º: to such articles will be supplied through the exertions
of gentlemen connected with our naval and military service, and that
among the Inyoluntary Contributions from the North will be the
following articles:-
1. The Falls of Niagara (American portion)—by the kind permission
of the Canadian authorities, and to be returned when done with.
2. The American Eagle.—The interesting animal will be provided with
a large supply of its natural food, namely, Bunkum, to be obtained from
the offices of the New York newspapers.

A QUESTIONABLE READING.

to º: of our country readers, and others who are not duly aware who
1S WIlo:—
P “Edwards's Hotel. —Arrivals: Mr. Thurlow weed and Miss Weep, from
aris."
It may be readily º that the WEED family is as ancient as
any that ever flourished on a landed estate, or in Sprin dens, or
any other aristocratic territory. The planta genista belonged to this
family indeed—the PLANTAGENETs were originally Weeds. There is
no difficulty in numbering the WEEDs among the flowers of fashion,
and including them within the higher classes and orders. But when a
certain fashionable peculiarity of speech is considered, the way in which
many members of the aristocracy are accustomed to pronounce a certain
consonant, some doubt will arise whether WEED, in the above announce-
ment, really means WEEP, or another surname. May not Edwards's
waiter, it will be surmised, have booked the name of WEED as he heard it
uttered, without taking the precaution to look and see how it was spelt
on the trunks of the guests newly arrived? Had he made that inspec-
tion, might he not have discovered that the initial letter of the name
given him orally—by the footman perhaps—as beginning with W, was
really R.? Why, no, rustic and uninformed friends. The WEEDs, we
believe, have grown among an Upper Ten Thousand that can at least
pronounce their own names.
MR. THURLow WEED, in sort, is a Weed imported from America, of
decidedly Northern produce. He is not a rank Yankee Weed, but, on
the contrary, quite a mild one; mild, however, as this WEED is, he is
not too mild for us to smoke him.
Good Advice.

SUGGESTED BY RECENT DISCUSSIONS, AND VERY SLIGHTLY ALTERED

BETWEEN Noes and Ayes a strange contest arose,
LoRD STANLEY had set them unhappily wrong;
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
To which that young nobleman ought to belong.
The Press was the lawyer, and argued the cause
With a great deal of skill and elaborate learning,
While Chief Baron PUNCH sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.
“In behalf of the Noes it will quickly be clear,
And your Lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly ſind,
“That a STANLEY must be a Conservative peer,
And if radical, held to be out of his mind.”
Then, holding a pedigree up to the Court,
*To doubt it were treating his eminent Dad ill.
A son of PRINCE RUPERT, my Lord is, in short,

STRANGE TRANspoRMATION IN THE AMERICAN CABINET.
—LINcoLN is looking Sea-ward,
A LOOSENESS IN A GOVERNMENT OFFICE.
IN the annual report of the Postmaster-General, issued two or three
weeks ago, we read that—
“The carelessness of the public in posting letters is best shown by the fact that
no less than 50,000 postage stamps were found loose in letter boxes and mail-bags."
It is very well to put the above down to the “garelessness of the
public.” It may be owing to the carelessness of the Post-Office. . A
short time ago, the authorities of St. Martin's-le-Grand were so sparing
of their gum, that it was as difficult to find a *** stamp stick to its
letters as one of LoRD MALMESBURY's clerks... Like deserters, they
displayed a too willing alacrity in ºf away from their posts. Ad.
mirably as the Post Office is conducted in most of its branches, we
must say that it was in the above respect anything but what, an actor
would call “letter-perfect,” in its delivery. Whose gain we should like
to know was the treasure-trove of those 50,000 stamps? We conclude
they became the perquisite of the Post-Office; so that they had an
actual gain in a want of adhesiveness to their Fº duties. They bene:
fited by their “carelessness” to the extent of £208 6s. 8d. ; and if
these 50,000 stamps were sold again, and fell off again, as such a slippery
article undoubtedly would, they would realise the same profit, eyery
time they repeated the transaction. It is not turning “an honest
enny” to sell an article that will not fulfill the promise with which it
has been backed. The dodge may be exceedingly clever, and may
succeed in increasing the sale of stamps to a very large extent, but we
decidedly should prefer in such matters from Government a little less
gumption and a little more gum.

High ART ON A LOW ROPE.
ERILY, the , pleasure-
seeking publicismost
strangely inconsis-
tent. To see the
0ctoroon pretend to
die upon the s
is too much for its
tender heart and
tear-filled eyes to
witness: but to see
M. BLoNDIN risk his
life in grim reality
brings, no sort *
sickening qualm,... or
compassionating fear
to it. At least, if it
feel fright at all, the
very terror is attrac-
tive; and the more
danger there is, the
more the public
flocks to see it. Take
away the chance of
neck-breaking, and
who would stir a
- - foot to see a man
walk on a high rope? It is the peril that so pleases the tender-hearted
ublic. It is the chance of witnessing a real act of suicide that makes
it flock in crowds, like Spaniards to a bull-fight: while it turns away
its eyes in well-affected horror at the simulated death before the
footlights of the Octoroon. -
To see M., BLONDIN appear on his high rope, the Crystal Palace
each day Fº about twenty thousand *. e: whereas a daily
average of n - -- - - -
see him on his low rope, which latter, if judged simply by its acrobatic
merits, ought to prove by far the more attractive exhibition. As danc-
ing, rightly practised, is more elegant than walking, so M. BLonDIN's
tight-rope dancing is superior and moreworth seeing than his tight-rope
walking, albeit in this last there is the charming chance of seeing him
fall off and break his neck. Though at a lower elevation, the former is
by far the ºff. style of art; and by descending to within six or eight
feet of the floor, M. BioNDIN has much raised himself in Mr. Punch's
estimation.
Let not people rashly think themselves quite }º to answer the
world-wide-posted question, “Have you seen Blondin º’ by the fact
that they have seen him simply on the high rope. Bloxi IN on the
high rope and BioNDIN on the löw, are, except in never failing in what
is undertaken º to be recognised as being the same performer.
BLONDIN eight feet from the ground performs such feats of skill and
strength as at two hundred feet above it of course he would not dare to
do. Using the rope either as a spring-board, floor or sofa, as his fancy
seems to take him, he hops, skips, dances, jumps, turns, summersaults
in sabots, in fetters, or on stilts, and over rows of lighted candles with-
out whisking ever a wick out, lies flat upon his back as snug as in a
hammock, bounds up high into the air and swings his legs from side to
side as though they were but tied to him, plays the fiddle or the dru
now firm upon one leg as if a model for a statue, next jumping up º
down as though in training for the Cure, appearing all the while as
much at home and at his ease as if he had in fact been born upon the
rope, and had lived all his life on it. BLONDIN, is in fact as much at
ease upon the tight-rope as would a Gorilla be in doing the trapeze, and
there is a poetry of motion in his movements that one would scarce
expect to see in so prosaic a performance as dancing on the tight-
rope usually is.
A hundred years ago the art of rope-dancing ranked higher among
the arts and sciences than it happens to do now, and, being better
§º was doubtless better cultivated. Performers then, may be,
d.just the feats that BLondºn does; but they who are not cente-
narians will hardly recollect a performer who has equalled him. Punch
abstained from praising BLONDIN for his skill on the high rope, for
Punch had no wish to tempt people to the chance of seeing suicide.
But now that BLONDIN is performing without danger to his neck,
Punch would recommend all sight-seers forthwith to go and see him,
O YOU WANT LUXURIOUS whiskERs? If so, go at once
and purchase Punch's Almanack: wherein, among ten thousand useful bits of

not above three thousand have been attracted lately to.
MEN AND MONIKEYS.
IFM. Du CHAHLube believed, and (in º: of DR. GRAY) we do not
see why he should not, he must have lived in queer society in Africa.
And yet many of the brutes, both animal and human, that he found
himself among, bear no little resemblance to peºple who are, found in
far more º localities. For instance, the Fan cannibals eat, up
their relations whenever they have the chance; and this is gertainly a
custom not less common in Central England, than it is in Central
Africa... We have all known uncle-hunters, who have done their best to
worry those rich relatives to death º bled them (through their
ankers) as much as well was possible; while many a devourer of the
substance of his aunt holds his head erect, and walks at large among us,
as though cannibalism had ceased to be regarded as a crime. -
Again, take the Nshiego-Mbouvé, or large nest-building ape, which
M. Eu Chºº claims the merit of discovering. This monkey is a
bald one, and, as the art of wig-making in ape-land is unknown, he
builds himself a nest or thatch to keep his head warm, and prevent the
wind from whistling in his ears. And do not many men make nests,
and know well how to feather them? The practice is as usual here as
with the Nshiego-Mbouvés, and the industry and skill with which it is
achieved are every whit as wondrous with the men as with the monkeys.
As another very marked peculiarity of theirs, these apes are spoken of
as being pretty often up a tree, in fact, as passing in that manner a full
half of their existence. But this is not a habit special to the simious
creation. Our poor friend MR, HARDUPPE has for years been “up a
tree,” to quote his own confession; and the chances are, we think,
from our knowledge of his character, that he will end his days in that
uncomfortable position. -
Thus we find in Central England and in civilised society º the
same, habits and eccentric ways of º as those which have been
noted in the wilds of Central Africa. In fact, the customs of Gorilla
Land and *. thereto adjacent, although in hastewecalithem savage,
brutal, and inhuman, not merely have existence, but are actually ap-
lauded, when pursued in our (so called) more civilised community.
º think it a meat dodge to live on one's relations, and when a rich
man dies the first thing his friends ask is—how will he “cut up?”
Instances occur almost daily here among us of people being hunted
down and eaten up by fellow men, who pursue with cruel eagerness all
the helpless victims who may chance to cross their path., Indeed, much
as we may boast of our superior intelligence, customs the most canni-
balic prevail still in this country; and many who are looked upon as
Educated Englishmen, behave themselves in no way better than Gorillas.

CALUMNY ON CRACK CORPS.
THE feelings of every man who wishes to respect his species, and is accustomed
to ride in London omnibuses, must often have been outraged by a certain coloured
rint which is stuck up inside most of those vehicles on the part facing the door.
his picture represents two degraded beings of opposite sexes, fashionably attired,
the hair and whiskers of the man half grey, half black, and the tresses of the other
black on one side and red on the other. Both the gent and his counter-part are
represented with a countenance in which a ridiculous ruefulness combines with a
disgusting love of approbation. The title of this work of art, printed in large type,
is “No more Gray Hair;” and the two snobs, male and female, whose portraits
illustrate that inscription, are supposed to have resorted to staining their hair, and
to have allowed their likenesses to be taken when that process was half done, in
order to exhibit the contrast between its results on the one side, and the state of
nature on the other. They look very much as if they had been paid to sit, and felt
rather ashamed of themselves in so º;
What then will be the sentiments with which the elect of the British Army will
read the following, picked out of a column of other advertisements of cosmetics?—

the Coldstream—or Coldcream—will have to do omnibus-duty pictorially for the
wretch who now figures as the exemplification of No more Gray Hair.”. The
print which is now .# disgusting will become libellous when it exhibits an
officer and a gentleman disgracing himself by colouring his hair... We know well
that our gallant Guardsmen have no notion of dying, unless either from natural
causes, or for their country, and their Punch.

THE TWO MESSENGERS.
COLUMBIA.
I HAVE a message must cross the sea,
But I doubt what message it shall be:
And be it Peace, or be it War,
A fitting post I would choose therefor."
So say, you bonny birds of mine
Around which neck shalli tie the twine?
THE EAGLE.
Round mine, round mine, my mistress sweet,
My wings are broad and my flight is fleet:
And I have a beak to rend the prey,
And talons for all my course j stay:
And I can swoop over land and sea—
Then “War,” and your message send by me !
THE DOVE.
Round mine, O mistress sweet, round mine:
I’m swift as arrow, and true as line:
Nortalons sharp, nor beak have I
But a soft sweet voice and a pleading eye;
And none will harm me, on land or sea—
Then “Peace,” and send your message by me.
THE EAGLE.
The Lion stands in act to spring,
Her glove BRITANNIA lifts to fling:
A haughty claim asks haught reply
He half has conquered, who dares defy:
With the Lion the Eagle should parly hold—
Then give me the message, brief and bold.
The Dove.
The dugs of the Lioness suckled thee,
When first thou camest over sea.
Better I ween than BRITANNIA’s glove,
Is the hand of BRITANNIA, clasped in love.
Twixt Dove and Lion calm speech may be—
Then the message of Peace send thou by me !
THE EAGLE.
Thou hast boasted and blustered and talked of fight,
Hast set a bold face in lieu of right:
If breath thou bate, or back thou draw,
Or instead of battle offer law,
Oh, scornful the Lion's laugh will be—
Then the message of War send thou by me !
THE DOVE.
If thou hast boasted, boast no more:
If war thou hast challenged, repent it sore:
The devil's wickedest whisper to man
Is, “Let wrong end, since wrong began.”
Öh, glad the Lion's great heart will be,
If a message of Peace thou send by me.
And still in doubt doth Colum BIA stand,
A bird and an answer on either hand;
For War,<-the Eagle with eyes a-glow;
For Peace,—the Dove, with her plumes of snow.
But Peace or War should the message be,
'Twill find them ready across the sea.

THE American organ, the Morning Star, alone of all
the London journals, appeared on the sixteenth without the
signs of respect usual when a national affliction occurs. It
was subsequently shamed into a shambling kind of apology.
