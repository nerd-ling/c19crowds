THE LORD DUNDREARY, LoquiTUR.
—P–PR—PREFACE, M.R. Punch I Come, I say, that’s chaffing a fellah, and old birds in the hand
are not to be caught in the bush—stop, if you’re in the hand you can’t be caught by putting salt
upon the bush—I haven’t quite got it, but the moral is the same. A P-P–Preface. What’s a Preface f
A fellah can't be expected to know that without being told; can he 7–ridiculous, at least if he hasn’t
heard of it in some other way; you must see that. I w—w—wonder whether my brother SAM could write
a Preface. I shouldn’t think he could ; because nobody knows what his brother can’t do until he has tried,
and SAM’s never been tried, you know; at least he's never been tried for writing Prefaces, so he's not
guilty of that, SAM isn't, and it’s a c-c—comfort to be able to say a fellah’s not guilty of anything,
especially if you are his brother. I don’t mean that you’re SAM’s brother, because if you were, you would
be me, which would be ridiculous: we couldn't both be the same person and different, could we? Only
you might be a man and a brother, and then you and SAM would be cousins; but, I say, then you would be
a nigger, and you mightn't like that, eh? and have to wash your face with a b–b—blacking brush; very objec-
tionable idea that. But, I say, I wish you’d ask SAM to write your Preface for you; he lives in America, he
does, and if you write to the North and your letter comes back, I dare say he’ll answer it from the South.
Stop, no, he can’t do that if it comes back aud he don't get it; can he’—but you might make it a
d—d—double letter, and put two heads on it, and then it would do for either North or South America. Two
heads are better than one, don’t you know—stop, is that right? A fellah gets these epitaphs into his head
till—stop, are they epitaphs? No, no, an epitaph was what they put on my Aunt SALLY-not that she had
two heads, quite the reverse, and I never saw a two-headed aunt in all my life—ridiculous, how could she
kiss my uncle if she had two heads?—why she’d be a s—s—Cerberus, and you don’t think my uncle, who
was a most respectable man, would marry a Cerberus—he was quite another kind of person. Now he could
have written a Preface for you if you like, he could, and I should advise your going to him, only he’s
dead, that’s one thing, so I suppose it wouldn't be quite—no, of course, you can’t go to a late lamented
uncle and b–b–bother him for Prefaces—quite absurd. Besides, we don’t know whether he's dead or not,

iv PREFACE. [JUNE 28, 1862.
because he went to Australia and never wrote to say he was dead, or anything in the nug-nug—nugget line,
you know, and—I’ll tell you what—an idea—yes. When you write your double letter to my brother SAM
you might put a p—p—postscript telling him that if he doesn't get it he might send it on to uncle if he
isn't dead, and if he is, tell uncle to send it back. Of course he can’t do that if he’s dead, unless—ha-
unless you wrote a d-d-dead letter—not bad that. But alive or not, he’s quite a gentleman, my uncle,
I assure you, and if you think he would marry a Cerberus you don't know the man. Quite incapable of
marrying Cerberus or any other heathen goddess. Was Cerberus a goddess though?—no, I should say not
—didn't M-M–Morpheus go after his wife and give him sop—Cerberus must have been a b-b–baby—a
two-headed baby—wonder which face they k—k—christened, awkward for the godfathers not to know which
half they answered for, eh? Well, I don't know what’s to be done though, because you say you want the
Preface to-morrow, and the mail don’t go out till next week, so you couldn’t hear in time unless you put
more stamps on, and then the letter would weigh too much, and he’d send it back unopened, SAM would,
for he’s a d-d—deuced economical fellah, is MASTER SAM. I call him Master because there’s no Mistress
SAM, and I wish there was, as marriage would steady him, a pair goes much steadier than a single horse,
not that SAM’s a horse, if he was I wouldn’t send you to him to write Prefaces; horses don’t do that
I’m given to understand, though he might draw the p—p—picture for you; horses can draw, you must see
that joke, and you might put it in the Preface when SAM sends it over. SAM will laugh at that, he
always laughs, does SAM, except when he’s asleep, and then he wh–wh—wh–whistles through his nose
to show he isn’t afraid of ghosts, though I don’t know whether they understand it as such, but if my
lamented uncle’s a ghost he understands it, because he understood everything, and I think you’ll get a
better Preface out of him than SAM. I tell you what, if the gh—gh—ghost don’t answer you, and
SAM don’t, you come to me to the Haymarket at Christmas and—you'll remember Christmas—hot
c—c—cross buns, you know—and then I’ll do it for you, and you can hark back and put it in your
j-j-j-fºrty-stem ºnlimt.

POLITICAL
HE death of the PRINCE Consort cast a cloud over the
opening of the year which would otherwise have had a
bright commencement, as the commercial and agricultural in-
terests were prospering with one exception, and that an
important contributor to the national wealth—the cotton
manufactures.
The Royal Speech at the opening of Parliament of course
contained some touching allusions to the loss HER MAJESTY
had sustained:—
“We are commanded,” said the Lord CHANCELLor, “by HER MAJESTY
to assure you that HER MAJESTY is persuaded that you will deeply participate
in the affliction by which HER MAJESTY has been overwhelmed by the
calamitous, untimely, and irreparable loss of her beloved Consort, who has
been her comfort and support. It has been, however, soothing to HER
MAJESTY, while suffering most acutely under this awful dispensation of
Providence, to receive from all classes of her subjects the most cordial
assurances of their sympathy with her sorrow, as well as of their appreciation
of the noble character of him, the greatness of whose loss to HER MAJESTY
and to the nation is so justly and so universally felt and lamented.”
The progress of the Civil War in America was a subject of
great interest to this country, and the telegrams were looked
for and read with much anxiety. An amicable adjustment
of “the Trent Affair” was a great relief to the public mind.
Still the want of the usual cotton supply was severely felt, and
a period of great distress to the Lancashire weavers loomed
darkly in the future.
The next subject of interest which occupied the public
attention was the Revised Code of National Education, and
the debates, which were numerous, were characterised by
more than the usual eloquence of the Houses of Lords and
Commons.
SIR JoBy TRELAwNEY again brought forward his sessional

SUMMARY.
motion for the Abolition of Church Rates, and on a division
was defeated by a majority of one. Nor was MR. WHALLEY
more successful in his opposition to the Maynooth Grant,
which SIR RobFRT PEEL, as Secretary for Ireland, defended.
There were other matters necessarily continually arising in
connection with America which occasioned constant reference
to that country in Parliament, and International Law and
Neutral Rights formed the subjects of more than one debate.
The blockade of the Southern ports was formally brought before
both Houses of Parliament early in the month of March, and
fully debated, and much contrariety of opinion prevailed as to
the effectiveness of the blockade, and whetherit ought to be re-
spected. Whatever difference of opinion existed on this matter,
an universal desire evidently prevailed for the observance of a
strict neutrality on the part of this country. Other discussions
arose out of American questions—one very important one
upon a motion of MR. HoRSFALL, the Member for Liverpool,
who proposed “That the present state of international marine
law, as affecting the rights of belligerents and neutrals, is
ill-defined and unsatisfactory.” A very animated debate
followed, and led to subsequent legislation in 1866.
The infamous proclamation of GENERAL BUTLER at New
Orleans, threatening to flog women who showed any disrespect
towards the flag of the United States, furnished occasion for
comments in Parliament, and LoBD PALMERSTON declared
that no man could read that infamous proclamation without a
feeling of the deepest indignation. Englishmen must blush
to think that it came from a man of the Anglo-Saxon race—
a man who was a soldier, and had raised himself to the rank
of a General; but he was of opinion that any interference of

INTRODUCTION.
race
England in the affairs of America, would only serve to aggra-
vate the sufferings of those now enduring privations in con-
sequence of the war in their country.
But there were some Members who did not agree with LoBD
PALMERSTON, and on the 18th July the subject of mediation
in the American quarrel was introduced by MR. LINDSAY,
although several Members endeavoured to dissuade him from
doing so, considering the time was inexpedient for the purpose.
The opposition was triumphant, and no division was taken.
As there appeared to be no signs of an early termination of
the American Civil War, and as the season was drawing to a
close, the probable condition of the operative classes, owing to
the want of cotton, became a subject of increasing anxiety.
The attention of Ministers was directed from all quarters to
the certainty that unless a supply of the raw material could
be obtained, nothing could prevent the stoppage of the mills
in the cotton districts in the coming autumn.
Public sympathy declared itself on all sides for the nume-
rous and industrious population which was threatened with
the coming calamity, but the difficulty appeared of such mag-
nitude that it was thought to be out of the power of any
Government to meet it. After much debate a Bill was brought
in by MR. WILLIERs, the President of the Poor Law Board to
enable—
“The Boards of Guardians in certain counties in England to meet any ex-
traordinary demands for relief. He said that he did not mean to imply
by this motion that the law was not adequate to meet the case, or that any
further powers were necessary to enforce the law ; but the measure he pro-
posed was only a precautionary one during the recess, and he proceeded to
state facts that appeared to him to justify it. He showed from returns the
amount of distress that existed in the principal towns in Lancashire in
consequence of the want of employment, and the expenditure for the relief
of the poor, remarking that the number of persons dependent upon the
rates was no criterion of the number destitute of employment. The de-
posits in the savings-banks were now, however, nearly exhausted;
the distress was increasing rapidly and extending, and there was no prospect
of its diminution but by the revival of trade. Looking to these circum-
stances and to the principle of the existing law, which sanctioned a rate-in-aid,
he proposed by the Bill to give vitality to that principle, so that any parish
or parishes, overburdened by extraordinary local distress and pauperism,
might claim a contribution from the common fund of the Union, or under
certain circumstances, one Union might call for a contribution from the
other Unions in the county. He explained the principal enactments of the
Bill, which he proposed to continue for a limited term, till the 1st of March,
1863.”
Certain amendments were proposed of more or less value.
“Ultimately, however the House decided that the liability to
a rate-in-aid of the other parishes of an Union should arise as
soon as the expenditure of a parish exceeded 38. in the pound,
*
and that a power to borrow on security of the rates should be
conferred on the Guardians, subject to the sanction of the
Poor Law Board, whenever the aggregate expenditure of the
Union exceeded 3s. in the pound on the rateable property of
the whole Union.”
The Standing Orders were suspended in the Lords, the Bill
went through Committee, and was read a third time and
passed, so urgent had become the necessity for its application.
An attempt, made by MR. SIERIDAN, to reduce the duty
on Fire Assurances failed, and the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExcIIEQUER brought in his Budget, and one of its principal
features was the revision of the Hop Duties and a re-adjust-
ment of Brewers' Licences. The financial scheme of the
Government occasioned much debate and opposition, but
after the withdrawal of the proposed reduction and re-adjust-
ment the Bill was read a third time.
Two financial debates attracted much public attention. One
a motion by MB. HUBBARD, directed against the mode of
levying the Income-Tax, and another (which threatened to
compromise the stability of the Government) by MR. STANs-
FELD, affirming the possibility of reducing the expenditure of
the nation.
The terms of MR. HUBBARD's motion were so much in
accordance with Mr. Punch's own views that we insert them
and some of his observations:—
“That the incidence of an Income-Tax should not fall upon capital or pro-
perty, and, when applied to the annual products of invested property, should
fall only upon the net income arising therefrom ; and that the net profits,
gains, or salaries of persons and partnerships (not being public companies)
engaged in any trade, farm, manufacture, profession, or salaried employment,
should be subject, previous to assessment, to such an abatement as may
equitably adjust the burden thrown upon intelligence and skill as compared
with property." Premising that it was the duty of the Government to
collect the national revenue in such a way as not to interfere with the
prosperity of the country, or to sow jealousy among classes, he proceeded to
show what, in his opinion, was the right principle of an Income-Tax; that the
present tax violated that principle; and that our vicious legislation could be
easily amended by the adoption of the true principle of an Income-Tax, as
enunciated in the Resolution. His object was, he said, to induce the House
by affirming this principle, to give expression to an opinion which the
Government would feel it their duty to make the basis of their financial
arrangements for another year. He discussed very fully the modes of apply-
ing his principle to the various sources whence income was derived, suggesting
the necessary distinctions, especially between companies and partnerships.
Having anticipated and replied to objections to his motion, he dwelt upon
the grievances suffered by the operation of the tax, under which none were
truthfully treated, and upon the merit as well as fiscal advantage attending
the removal of a temptation to fraud and dishonesty, practised in order to
evade what was considered an unjust imposition.”
The House, however, rejected the motion by 99 to 62.

NOTES.
The Freeborn American Citizen's Privilege.—Presi-
dent or Precedent—in allusion to “the Trent affair.”
Up a Tree.—The determined attitude assumed by England
in the matter of the Trent was thought to have conduced to
the peaceful termination of the difficulty.
Warrented Witty.—The Commissioner of Lunacy is the
author of a book called Now and Then.
Law and Lunacy.—The inquiry instituted to ascertain the
mental competency of WILLIAM FREDERICK WINDHAM, of
Fellbrig Hall, Norfolk, to manage his own affairs, was opened
in the Court of Exchequer by MR. SAMUEL WARREN, Com-
missioner in Lunacy, and a Special Jury, on the 16th of
December, 1861, and did not close until the 30th of January
following. Thirty-four of the intervening days having been
occupied by the inquiries; upwards of 150 witnesses having
been examined, and almost all the leading talent of the
English Bar having been heard in support of the various in-
terests involved in the investigation—the costs amounted to
something like £20,000. WINDHAM was found capable of
managing his own affairs, though his conduct was that of a
great fool. He died February 2, 1866, aged 29.
Only One Word.—At Hartley, Colliery a frightful explo-
sion took place, January 12, and 204 fellow-creatures died a
terrible death.
Page
Too Civil by Half-LoRD DERBY and MR. DISRAELI 75
were very complimentary to the Government on the settlement
of the American difficulty.
The Parliamentary Python.—A Pythoness at the
Zoological Gardens created much public interest during the
process of incubation, but her eggs proved to be addled.
The O'Mannikin refers to a challenge sent to SIB Robert
PEEL (then Secretary for Ireland) by the O'Donoghue. LoRD
PALMERston would not allow the duel to take place, and all
the town laughed at the folly of sending a challenge now-a-
days.
Gradually making Way.—The late SIR GEORGE LEWIS.
The Popish Organ Nuisance.—The occupation of Rome
by the French troops, and the Pope's countenance of FERDI-
NAND (or BoMBA) kept Italy unsettled.
Ben the Bird-Catcher. (Out of Luck.)—The Member for
Buckinghamshire had been “soft soddering” the extreme
Liberals, the Irish, and the priesthood.
Dr. Birch and his Young Friends.-See Introduction. 237
MR. WALPole's Amendment.
The Professor of Allocution.—The Pope had reflected Q57
on the conduct of the EMPEROR NAPOLRoN and the KING OF
ITALY.

HINTS TO MAKE HOME HAPPY.
BY A MAN WHO MARRIED LATE,
SELECT the days when you suspect that
there's a make-shift sort of a dinner, for
bringing, unexpectedly, a few City men
to dine with you; and throw out such
artful hints as may lead them to infer
that your wife is a bad caterer, do what
you will to school her.
On any night when you have promised
to take her to the theatre, either don't go
home till morning, or else come rushing
in for dinner two hours before the time,
and, when you find she is not dressed,
declare she always keeps you waiting, and
throughout the whole two hours go on
fidgeting and fuming and continually ask-
ing her how long she means to be, and
predicting that, as usual, she'll be sure
to make you miss the only scene you
care to see.

Endeavour every morning to
get out of bed on the wrong
side. Always ring for your hot
water with a vehemence of one
who thinks his house is on-fire,
and scold the servantthrough the

ing it. Never #. your breakfast
without grumb that the eggs
are always boiled too much or
else not half enough: and that
by no chance can you ever get a
decent cup of coffee. Except for
purposes of diet, or else to make
a disagreeable remark, don't open
your mouth until the m is
finished. If your wife attempts
a little cheerful conversation,
stop it by a grunt: and eat with
the Times newspaper propped up
before your plate, as a hint that
you don't want her to bother
you by talking. Never positively
tell her whether you'll be home
to dinner: and be careful on the
days when you are certain you'll
dine out, to express yourself so
that she will be sure to wait an
hour for you. When you quit
the house leave a last word with
the servant, as opposite as pos-
sible to what you told your wife,
so as still more to prevent her
knowing what to do, and give
you furtherchances of complaint
at her not doing it. Of course,
be sure when you go out to bang
the door well after you.

be sure about your moral per-

SANITARY DIRECTIONS FOR
SERVANTS.
(For the Housemaid.)
NEVER open windows. It admits the
blacks. If you find any open, shut them
carefully.
In sweeping, work the dust well under
drawers, sofas, cabinets, and other pieces
of furniture not liable to be moved. If
these receptacles are ever discovered, you
can remove the accumulation at once.
Never disturb the dust, on picture-
frames, ledges, the tops of bureaus, &c.,
or generally, anywhere where your mis-
tress is not likely to see it. Dust once
settled is harmless. Meddling with it
only sets it in motion to settle some-
where else.
Never hang up, or expose to the air,
blankets or bedding. As you have made
the bed people ought to lie upon it, and
the less a bed is disturbed the better it
will look, and the less trouble it will give
you. -
Never remove slops in detail. Keep a
large part in some out-of-the-way }.
and let them accumulate. Why should
you take many journeys, when one will
serve the purpose 7
Find a place in or about the bed-rooms
for stowing away blacklead brushes,
dusters, dust-pans, hearth-brooms, and
similar articles, where your mistress is
not likely to find them, and by resort to
which you may spare yourself the fatigue
of running up and down stairs. If you
have no other place, put them under a
spare bed.

HINTS TO MAKE HOME HAPPY
By A Man Who MartR1Ed Late.
WHEN any of your wife's relatives are
staying in the house, do all you can to
snub them and to make their visit
wretched; but when any of your family
happen to be with you, take every oppor-
tunity of saying in her hearing that you
fear sho terribly neglects them in your
absence. Never pay a house-keeping
account without a grumble, and always
scrutinise each item as sharply as you
can, and hint that shawls and bonnets are
now and then put down, you think,
among the “Sundries.” If your wife is
a proficient as a pianist or singer, do all
within your power to discourage her from
practising ; and then, when at a party
she fails somewhat to exhibit her usua
execution, hint that ladies when they
marry grow sometimes sadly lazy. . In
short, do all you can to snub, vex, trouble
aggravate, and torment your wife, and i
will not be your fault if, to yourself as
well as her, your home is made most
happy.

(For the Nursemaid.)
The hotteryour nursery is kept
the better, or the children will
be sure to catch cold. For the
same reason insist on curtains
to the children's beds, and always
draw them close.
If your mistress is unreason-

Be sparing of cold water, and
indeed of the bath generally.
The instinct of infants protests
against washing, in spite of the
inhuman prejudice in its favour

If you meet an acquaintance
when walking with the children,
stop and chat, especially when
the wind is East. It will harden
the little things—a great point
in this variable climate.
Always use pins in the under-
clothing of infants. Strings will
come off. An occasional prick
supplies a wholesome stimulus
to the infantine lungs.
Always give children whatever
they cry for. Nature teaches them
to express their wants, which
it would be cruelty to thwart.
Give bread and butter, sweet-
meats, &c., between the chil- -
dren's meals. It will prevent
them over-eating themselves.
Always keep your foul linen
near at hand. A dirty frock or

THE CABMAN AND HIs ENEMY.
A CHRISTMAS Meeting of the Cabman's Club took place last week,
when very gratifying statements were made as to the prosperit
ºf the association, and the noblest sentiments were freely ventilated.
The cabmen declare themselves resolved to stand by their order, and, as
#: !º July remarked, the public will never be able to get them
oil tina In Ol.
Some i. stories were, however, narrated, which serve to show
the brutality of the cab-hiring public towards the meritorious men who
convey them to their business or their pleasure.
..MR. Jehu Thong, driver, stated that he was hired by a lady and her
sister, the other night, to convey them from the Hanover Square
Rooms to Spring Gardens. There had been a charity concert at the
Rooms, and he humbly thought that the spirit of charity should have
Actuated these ladies even beyond the precincts of the rooms. (Hear,
hear.). He had, on arriving at Spring Gardens, demanded half-a-crown,
when the elder lady, in the meanest manner evading a reply until the
door was open, and she and her sister were in the hall, called out her
husband, who was lurking. Qver his newspaper in the parlour, men-
tioned the demand, and said, “Pay him, dear.” . The cowardly trick
was successful, and he, MR. THONG, was obliged, from terror of the
oppressive law, to say that he had asked º: only, which
was but three times his fare. (Cries of “Shame.”)
MR. E. STABLISH RAw, driver, could relate a worse case. A man,
so elegantly dressed that he supposed he must call him a ºntleman,
but a man was a man for a that (cheers), hired him at the door of the
Reform Club, and directed him to drive to Berkeley Square. It was
raining hard. On arriving at the house, his fare -
the bell. . He was a cab-driver, not a servant, and he flatly refused to
descend for º . purpose. Why should he let his seat get damp?
What was the fiendish revenge of his fare? He got out, rang the bell,
and whºn, the door opened, looked at his watch, and the clock in the
hall. “Keep that, man waiting thirteen minutes,” he said to the
pampered menial, “and then pay him,” he added, putting a coin into
the latter's hands, and going up-stairs. He, RAw, waited, and at the
thirteenth minute the savage vassal, with a cruel grin handed him—
sixpence. (Prolonged sensation, and cries of “Shame /*)
MR. FLANKER, FitzNACKER, driver, was hailed by a gentleman at
the door of the Princess's Theatre, just after Christmas, and took him
and two ladies up. He was told to go first to Baker Street, and
having set down one of the females, was desired to proceed to the
Regent's Park. . He drove a little way, when, recollecting that the
theatre was nearly over, and that he should lose other fares, he pulled
up, and represented that the ground was too slippery for his |.
desired him to ring h
The gentleman peremptorily ordered him to proceed, asserting that
there was a thaw and the road was all right. But he was proud
to say that he stood by his order, and the gentleman and lady had to
get out (applause) in the cold. (Renewed applause.) The action, how-
ever, was its own reward, for the gentleman refused to pa him. a
farthing (shame), and defied him to summons him tº which,
for reasons that might occur to them (laughter), he did not do." He
would impress on his friends the necessity of º; from all
fares an exact statement as to where they wanted to go. (Cheers.)
MR. SLANgsby KNAGG, driver, had to take a lady and two children
from a doctor's house in Cavendish Square to Connaught Terrace,
Edgeware Road. As one of the children was ill, he thought the
woman's heart would have been softened, but she refused to pay him
three shillings, and sent out her brother, who blowed him up for half
an hour, and sent him away with a shilling, taking his card, and humili:
ating him in full view of a public house. (Sensation.) He thought, it
ought to be law that the person as hired a cab were to pay for it, and it
should be misdemeanour for anybody else to interfere, {}} Cheers.)
Other heart-rending cases were narrated, and the indignation of the
meeting was greatly excited. Strong resolutions were passed.
POETRY FOR A BISHOP.
The Bishop or SALISBURY's opening attack upon the Rºv, Row-
LAND WILLIAMs, in respect of the latter's share in Essays and Reviews,
was rather uncivilly handled by DR. DEANE, and denounced as clumsy.
We suppose the Bishop is aware that there was such a person as
ShakspeaRE, and if his Lordship had condescended to search King John,
e would have found, ready framed for him by the F; and actually
put into the mouth of Salisbury, a better description of the objectionable
volume than any which DR. PHILLIMORE could frame. Salisbury says,
“In this, the antique and well noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured,
And like a shifted wind unto a sail,
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
Startles and frights consideration,
Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected
For putting on so new a fashioned robe."
If the divine WILLIAMs, we do not mean, the divine, WILLIAMs,
whom the Bishop is persecuting, ever hit exactly upon anything, it was
upon the Essays and Reviews when he was penning the above lines.
Bishop PUNch commends them to his brother Bishop, and with them
the other SALISBURY's resolution to abandon a mistaken course, to
eschew the use of misapplied force, and abide by
“A happy newness that intends old right.”

JANUARY 4, 1862.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 3
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
EALLY, my dear Punch, MR.
BoucIGAULT is somewhat of an
enviable man. Not many
stage-writers have hit the
public taste with more success
than he, or have jumped to
such high favour by a single
leap. is Colleen Bauen has
been the theme of the past dra-
matic year; even Monsieur
FECHTER’s Hamlet has not
been so much talked about.
When the play was put aside
for the production of the Octo-
room, everybody wondered at the
premature withdrawal. With
a house crammed to the ceiling
every evening as it was, the
attraction of the Colleen was
clearly unabated. Indeed, I
rather think it was the general
belief that, if such had been his
leasure, its author might with
case have won the title of ‘the Hero of Five Hundred Nights? Some
how, people never seemed to tire of seeing that “ tremendous header, and
went over and over again until they must have almost known the piece
by heart. After all, the public is itself the best advertisement. Once
get a good name for no matter how indifferent a play, and there is no
saying how long you may hang out your flaming posters ºn the outer
walls, while by your audience-attendants the cry is ‘still they come.’.
“Whether the Octoroon will rival the Colleen in public favour is
doubtful, not so much from the merits of the play, as from the reason
that the public is a rather fickle patron, and sometimes after patting
people on the back is apt for no good cause to turn its face against
them. Great successes very often are succeeded by re-action, and
things that follow in the wake of what has been commended are, with-
out fair reason, publicly condemned. “Sensation’ scenes, moreover,
on which such dramas as the octoroon and Colleen Barn depend, are
apt after a while to pall upon the palate, as one's emotional capacities
by usage get worn out. }. my thinking, a bit of genuine good acting
is more lastingly attractive than a myriad of scenes which are dependent lik
on mere brushwork and stage-grouping for effect...Thus, when I saw
the Colleen the last night it was played before this Christmas week
revived it (that being, said thePººl; the two hundred, and eighty-
fourth) the }. I most enjoyed was the sly humour of the interview
between Myles and the Priest. MR. BoucIgAULT in this more showed
his power as an actor than any number of his headers would give him
scope to do. Actors, and not acrobats, are what I care to see; and
anything that chances to interest my mind I can see a second time
with vastly more enjoyment than scenes which are attractive merely to
my eyesight. -
“As far as its attractiveness is generally concerned, the Octoroonis cer.
tainly improved by . Of course there are some people who
find fault with the amendment, and who suggest that as tastes differ, and
some playgoers delight in being made extremely miserable, the heroine
should try to please both sorts of her admirers, by killing herself one
night and marrying the next. This would give relief to the monotony of
acting the same drama every evening throughout a lengthened run, and
would have too the advantage that all who felt, dissatisfied with either
way of ending might repeat their visit and applaud the other. Were
SHAkspeaRE living now to write “sensation’ dramas, he might, to
please the public, make Othello kill Iago three nights in the week
instead of venting his blind wrath upon the virtuous Desdemona. More-
over, Hamlet might be altered so as to end happily, Ophelia being
rescued and restored to reason, just in time to rush on in the middle of
Act V, and so prevent her brother from sticking the Crown Prince,
who, having killed the King, might wed her and be happy.
*Mr. Boucicault can weſi afford to be a little joked at, for they laugh
most who win, and his drama, as now played, will for a fair while fill
the house for him. By altering it to suit the inclinations of the merry
rather than the melancholy, he will doubtless please the great majority
of people, who entertain a healthy preference for seeing plays end
happily. However much they may enjoy to use their handkerchiefs
occasionally while the plot proceeds, as a rule a British audience likes
that all be right at last; and so long as their dear Octoroon is saved
from being poisoned, the house won't care to criticise the rather hack;
meyed Nº. which she is preserved. In their i". to see her rescued
from the Villain of the piece (well played by MR. EMERY, I think they
must admit), they will not quarrel with the stale device of huddling on
the characters to form a final tableau when the curtain drops; nor will
they cavil at Miss Dora for accepting Salem Scudder in a jiffy when he
asks, her, although she loves another and knows he does the same.
Neither will they stare to see this lady and her guardian appear in the
last scene in spotless unstained dress, after having tracked the Villain
º victim through forests which have torm her clothes half of her
aCK.
“Humour and pathos are well blended in the drama; the dry 'cute
Yankee sayings, of Mr. Salem Scudder and the droll fum. of the old
Niğ (a most life-like bit of acting), alternating neatly with the love
talk of poor Zoe, and the scenes that move our pity and our horror at
her lot. There is abundance of quick action in the piece, so that all
throughout the interest never flags; while by attention to stage-
grouping and (except as I have hinted), all the minor details, a
semblance of reality is given to each scene, which very greatly heightens
the general effect. The excitement of "the Slave Salé, and the
rush across the stage . when the steamboat . is on fire, and the
Villain has ici". from her with Zoe in his skiff, are admirable
specimens of what may be effected by having minor parts well filled,
and getting supernumeraries well up to their work. Even the great
‘header” scene appeared to me quite tame after these “sensation’ ones
(partly owing à. to its not being quite so new to me); and if,
as some have fancied, the success of the Colleen depended chiefly on the
Cave Scene, I think the Ship on Fire, the Slave Sale, and the Arkansas
Duel ought to give the Octoroon a like protracted run.
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
TO THE LADIES OF BRITAIN.
(Important.)
THE British manufacturers complain that they are allowed very, in-
sufficient space at the International Exhibition, and that they shall be
able to do no justice to themselves. The directors do not know what
to do, and heartily wish that they had constructed the building of India:
rubber, so that it might have been stretched out to Hammersmith, if
necessary. One idea has occurred to them in their despair. Sheffield,
where steel is chiefly manufactured, is earnest in its complaints of want
of room. The directors appeal to the ladies of England on behalf of the
town that
“Forges those bars of steel
That arm AURELIA with the shape to kill.”
In a word, it is in contemplation to announce, that room must be
made for the exhibition by the exclusion of Crinoline. The official
motification is not yet, out, but Mr. Punch, who is in the secret; at
once gives his lovely friends, the hint. Surely, between this and May,
their exquisite taste will enable them to devise a dress that shall not,
e Mars, cover nine acres of ground. Why should Venus--but
we have mislaid our Lemprière, and may mull the classical compliment.
We trust, however, that the ladies will do us the justice to admit that
we told them what was coming, and if they don't believe us, let them
wait till they see the turn-stiles now in course of erection. They are
those from the Parisian Bourse, turn-stiles which the EMPERQR has
ordered to be taken away, and which M. Fould has disposed of to the
Commissioners here.
“ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO.”
WE copy the following from the Débats, who gives it as “a curious
specimen of the tolerance of the police authorities of Warsaw, being a
permission signed by the Prefect of Police”:—
“I authorise the bearer of the present card, M. —, to carry a cane, even with
an iron ferule at the end, and this on account of his advanced age and the weakness
of his legs.” “Pilsudski.”
Some countries, like Austria, are priest-ridden; others, like poor
Poland, are police-ridden. We wonder if permission is required from
the Polish Prefect to carry an umbrella, “even with an iron ferule at the
end,” the reason assigned “being on account of the rainy season and a
tendency to rheumatism in his (the bearer's) back.” . It is curious in
a country where the Government, knowing how culpable it has been
stands in awe of a cane, that knives and forks are not likewise looke
". as dangerous weapons, and interdicted accordingly. In truth,
when a State is conscience-stricken, what is there that might not be
considered dangerous?, Razors, pitchforks, scythes, even a i. pair
of scissors, might inflict deadly wounds, and should be confided only to
the most trustworthy persons. A Government that did its duty would
not be subject to such miserable fears. The fact, is, the Russian
authorities, who govern so shamefully in Poland, feel that they richly
deserve the stick, and so are afraid, like cowards as they, are, to
place one in the hands of anybody, for fear it might be turned against
themselves.
The Russian Empire, such as it is generally described, with its body
of brass and its feet of clay, will, if it does not take care, also be
requiring some support some day, to keep it up, on account of the
extreme “weakness of its legs.”
'NGLAND’s National Reserve may hang back, but England's Naval
Reserve comes forward.

“NO CARDS.”
We observe that our sensible friends in Scotland are adopting a very
wise plan. When a happy pair has been made a happy couple, the an-
nouncement is duly made in the papers, and after the notification that
ARCHIBALD CAMERON MACFARLANE has been wedded to JEssie
FLORA FARQUHARSON, comes the second, notification “No Cards.”
This is, Mr. Punch repeats, a very proper thing. The tomfoolery of a
couple of cards, fastened together with a bit of glorified twine, has,
we believe descended to the inferior creation; but cards are still sent,
and the consequence is, that at every wedding mortal offence is sure to
be given to somebody, who has been accidentally forgotten, in the
excitement, and who has read in the book of Etiquette that the non-
reception of cards implies that you are to be dropped—you are not a
sort of person whom the husband wishes his wife to know. But if No
Cards are sent, no grievance can arise. Mr. Punch only wishes that
people would have the sense to apply a similar rule in the case of visits,
and that it was not thought necessary to go rushing over the Province
of Brick called London to leave a piece of pasteboard at a door which
you have not the least idea of entering. hy not do away with the
card nonsense? At all events, if these reminders are necessary, why
not make SIR. Row LAND HILL carry them? . Surely it is a higher
complinent to send a card by a knight than to hand it to your vassal.
Let us Post our. Cards, until we abandon them altogether. Then the
ladies will have time to to such a number of pleasant places with
their husbands, instead of being obliged to irritate the latter by eternal
refusals, based on the necessity of leaving cards at the DE Bökes', or
the FitzBOTHERs. Mrs. Punch means, henceforth, to send all her cards
by the post, and invites all her lady-friends to imitate her example until
the time when No Cards shall be the universal rule.

JANUARY 4, 1862.] PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI. 7
SIXTY-TWO ON THE SHORE,
(DECEMBER 31, 1861.)
BREATHLEss and blue stood Sixty-Two
On the brink of Time's great ocean,
Where together the Past and the Future are cast,
In a whirl of wild commotion.
The poor little fellow looked blue ºllow,
With frost and with fear he shivered,
As wave on wave did roar and rave,
Till the very rock it quivered. -
“Jump in' Jump in?” said Sixty-One,
As Qut of the spray he straggled,
With battered legs and bleeding feet,
And salt hair ooze-bedraggled.
“Jump in! Jump in' The waves beat strong,
The spring-tide runs a brimmer;
The sky is dark and the night is long,
Brave times for a sturdy swimmer | *
“Now out and alas!” said Sixty-Two;
“That I this sea must swim :
Above me the shroud of the storm-swept cloud,
Around me the sea-rack dim!”
“The Past flows out in sorrow and doubt,
Dark rolls the Future in ; -
Through the merry music of Christmas time
I hear the death-bell's din.
“Qh, woe is me that my lot should be
This º to put from shore,
Against the wrath of a darkling sea,
With this baby arm for oar!
“With never a moon to give me light,
And never a pilot-star: -
Only the white of the foam-crests bright,
And the harbour-lamps afar!”
Oh, scant of faith !—In mild rebuke,
v’n as he spoke, o'er head
Out burst the light of the gentle moon,
And broad on the waters spread.
Then Sixty-Two his trust he knew,
That still there was light on high—
And with sudden leap he took the deep,
And breasted the surges high .
ELECTORAL FACTS.
(Not MR. DoD's.)
THE Nottingham election has ended in the election of SIR. Robert
CLIPTON, who has beaten LORD LINcoLN. . The New York Herald
(which is honestly earning the pay it receives from the South to irritate
the North, against England) §§ say that the beaten candi-
date would certainly have won, being a lord, in an aristocrat-loving
country, but that the name of incoln is hateful to join Bui. just
now. This we must bear. The truth seems to be that neither cani.
date was one of whom a constituency would have any reason to be
violently proud, and that CLIPTON came in, like Cox, by making wilder
º: than his rival. He was, we see, appropriately proposed by
Mr. ALDERMAN RECKLEss, LORD LINcoLN being seconded by MR.
EARD, who was not heard, from the “violent hooting and yelling.”
Nottingham is proverbial for its riots, and furnishes the HATTöNs with
the title of Earl, whence it used to be called Hatton Garden, but is
now known as Bear Garden. We’ll make the New York Herald a
present of the fact that this is the second American defeat connected
with Nº. for GENERAL Howe, who defeated the Americans at
Bunker's Hill, as every American schoolboy knows, sat for Nottingham
for twelve years. Surely here are materials for a stunning anti-English
leading article, BENNETT, and you may head it “LINcoLN and
BENNETT,” and keep your Hat-on; yes, Sir "
Falsifying a Proverb.
..THERE is a saying about a certain party looking over Lincoln. But
if LINcqLN is wicked enough to provoke a war with England, we dare
not prophesy for him the good luck of being ultimately overlooked by
the party in question.
A MISS-USE OF MUSIC.
THE Doctor Blimber style of teaching is adopted, one would fancy,
at the Young Ladies' Establishment referred to in this notice, which
we copy from the columns of an influential paper called the West
London Observer, by which the mind of Hammersmith and the sur-
rounding suburbs is every week enlightened, instructed, and improved:
“Soirſ. E MUSICALE AT BLIMBER House.—As an instance of the great improve-
ment in the amusements of the young ladies at boarding schools, we refer with
ride to the example set in our immediate neighbourhood. We have before us a
utifully selected º of nineteen vocal and instrumental gems, arranged
for the young ladies of this establishment by its professors, and lº". by the
young ladies themselves, powerfully and agreeably aided by their tutors. The
programme comprised the most exquisite and scientific music of the day, rendered
!. most creditable and (in most cases) faultless execution. Vastly assistant to
mental culture, surely this will be accepted as a welcome innovation on the frivolous
character generally shown on such occasions, such as Dancing, Hunt the Slipper,
&c. &c., amusements which have been heretofore selected by schoolmistresses for
the delectation of their scholars.”
From the mention of the “powerful” assistance of the tutors, and
the generally “faultless execution ” of their pupils, one inclines to
think this notice was put forth as an advertisement, and of course paid
for as such by the mistress of the school. In that case one little values
the opinion which is uttered as to the excellence of music, as an amuse-
ment for young ladies, compared with “Hunt the Slipper” and other
i. games. The mistress, of a school where such pastimes were
thought “frivolous” might be naturally expected to say so in her
advertisements, that people who approve .# the BLIMBER way of
º might be induced thereby to send their daughters to her
SCI1001.
But, if the opinion that a lengthy lot of “vocal and instrumental
gems.” º wonder if “Jem Crow,” were included in the number?)
is “vastly assistant to the culture” of girls' minds, and a “welcome
innovation ” on such pleasant things as dancing and other social
pastimes, if this opinion emanate not from MRs. BLIMBER, but a writer
of the press, it may be worth the while of Mr. Punch to answer it.
That there’s “a time for all things” is not a new assertion; but there
are people in the world who seem never to have heard of it. Each age
has its pleasures, as it has its work and duties; and º youth of
its dancing and its games of Hunt the Slipper is to rob it of amusements
peculiarly its own, and which in after life it cannot properly enjºy. To
term such pastimes “frivolous” is uncalled-for . unjust. They are
suited for the age which is by human nature fitted to enjoy them, and
are natural and wholesome ways of relaxation, for youthful minds and
bodies which should not be overworked.
Don’t let it be thought that Punch would undervalue music, or think
it other than a charming means of entertainment when properly em:
ployed. . But it is one thing to hear music merely for amusement, and
it is quite another to sit down and perform with a master at one's
elbow, in all the awful silence of a drawing-room at school. As for
saying this is welcome” to the girls who are afflicted by it, you
might as well affirm that they like school bread and, butter; and as for
opining that it aids their “mental culture,” it is difficult to fancy what
improvement to their minds can result from a long evening of scientific
music, which the chance is they won't listen to, or, if they do,
grumble at as being a great bore.
Viewed merely as an exercise, dancing is a healthy sort of relaxation,
and not one to be sneered at, or neglected, at a girls’ school, where, i
pastimes such as “Hunt the Slipper” are prohibited, the only mode
of exercise will most likely be the cheerful one of walking two and two.
To expect a lot of school-girls to enjoy a solemn evening of scientific
music is as preposterous as thinking they would sit down to a rubber
like a jº old dowagers whose dancing days are over, and, whose
tastes are for amusements of a sedentary kind. ... No, while girls are
girls, let their sports be fººl. Vulgarly unladylike as it may seem to
some people, a go of blind man's buff or a good smart game of romps,
is far better relaxation for young girls pent up in school than sitting
round a room and twiddling their young thumbs while waiting for their
turn to thump away at the piano.

ASYLUM FOR DECAYED FUNAMBULISTS.
MonARCHs like mountebanks, says some spiteful philosopher, divide into two
classes—stilt-walkers and rope-walkers. CHARLEs THE FIRST went upon stilts till
he came to grief and broke down. JAMEs. The Second and little Bomba started
on very tall timber, but were soon glad, for their personal security, to cut their
sticks. Louis PHILIPPE adopting the juste milieu, obtained considerable applause
by his Mº. on the horizontal rope, but his balance pole suddenly snapping,
he fell floundering among the soup-tureens of a Reform banquet.
It is not everyman that is qualified to shine in Funambulism. Poeta nascitur non
fit may, º modified, be applied to the lines of a circus, as well as of a DRYDEN.
Statesmen and gymnasts are alike stimulated by that yaulting ambition which occa-
sionally oerleaps itself and falls on the other side. The Minister, constrained to
walk on the high rope, sedulously strives to avoid slips, but, like the acrobat, he
sometimes has a hard struggle to keep his place.
Funambulism at Astley's is most artistic—at St. sº most perilous.
BLACKMoRE, with his star and spangles, gave a charming illustration of a kitten
walking on warm tiles. MADAME SAquí, in her eightieth year, snatched a grace
beyond the altitude of art, BLONDIN, that walking monument of Funambulism,
thrilled the nerves, but did not impair the appetite of his most fastidious admirers
as * Crystal |Palace Chef de Cuisine can vouch by the enormous consumption o
veal ples.
The Irish patriotic professor of Funambulism belongs to a less dignified order of
artistes. His career is at once romantic and ridiculous. Smitten in early life by a
burning desire for national admiration, he joins a strolling troupe, where in the
equestrian, arena, his awkward experiments on the extended corde provoke
unive derision, and after some heavy spills in the sympathising sawdust, he
retires, from a profession which nature has not qualified him to adorn, with
concealed but fierce disgust.
Clown to the rope, could he but rise to that itinerant censorship, would now
amply gratify his thirst for fame, but wanting natural sagacity, knowledge of the
world, ability to balance himself, and a proper estimate of his own stren , in vain
he boasts of his talent for blowing a child's trumpet, and that agility in jumping
at conclusions which every fool exhibits who clings to a horse's tail.
There is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous. Disguising himself as
an Irish rebel, the needy Merriman leaps with rope and
prop into a widow’s cabbage-garden, resolved at any sacri-
fice-moral, not personal—to enter upon the haute école
of political Funambulism. Need we record the wild
catastrophe, and relate how he descends with a tremendous
shiver, his head as by a miracle escaping from the noose
which he had unwittingly tied for its reception? .
Among our charitable institutions, is, it not painful to
think there are none to which the broken down political
º is admissible?...If such an asylum now
existed, an O'BRIEN might cultivate, in loyal obscurity,
the historical savoy, and Erin's harp might neither be
profaned by a traitor's touch nor despised for sending over
the Atlantic a note of preparation very like a wail.

“A CERTAIN STAR SHOT MADLY FROM ITS SPHERE.”
The American organ, the Morning Star, has put itself into one of those violent
rages which are peculiar to journals that, preach peace-at-any-price, and, quote
Scripture at random. This awful fury has been caused by Mr. Punch's mild little
allusion to the fact that on the day when all the London journals came out with
black borders, the Star did not manifest that token of respect. So the Christian
Star showers on us a volley of Billingsgate. “Buffoon,” “unfeeling,” “a fool,”
“a liar,” “a malicious and silly liar,” “disgust,” “insolence,” are among the
hrases with which the Star ºrs to express its wrath, and at the same
ime to show that Mr. Punch's gentle rebuke was unfelt. The outbreak takes the
form of a letter, which was clearly intended for a leading article, as it begins with
a sentence of nineteen lines; but we do not think that this composition is the
production of one of the regular leader-writers, because it is in very fair grammar,
and lacks the provincial and smart-young-Dissenting-student tone which usually
ryades the Star disquisitions. Besides, the writer is honest enough to quote the
#. aragraph that has caused such º rage, and unless in a paroxysm of
º: fury, a regular Star writer would hardly have offered the Punch anti-
dote along with the BRIGHT bane. However, as we have shamed the Star into
protesting that it meant nothing, and is as mournful as it ought to be, we will
accept the rather amusing excuse about its machinery (an excuse at which the
º workmen who manage Mr. Panch's machinery are irreverent enough to
smile in a most rude manner), and will add that there is now a very fitting way

THE JONATHAN LUNACY CASE.
THE inquiry was resumed this morning. MR, PAM, Q.C., instructed
by MR.PUNCH, appearing, for the BULL family, whilst Mia Bright
watched the case for the alleged lunatic.
The first witness called was MRs. BULL, examined by MR. PAM :
said she had known MR. JonATHAN for many years. He used to shout
about the house, swear a great deal, and make anoise like an ophicleide
She considered him decidedly incapable of managing his own affairs.
He was fond of assuming military rank, and would call himself Colon EL
JoNATHAN, GENERAL JonATHAN, and so on. Could not give much
information respecting MR. JonATHAN's marriage with Miss VIRGINIA
SouTH.; but knew that at present, there . quarrels. The
l § wished for a separation, but, MR. JonATHAN would not hear of it,
and got dreadfully excited whenever the subject was alluded to.
One of his fancies was to dress like a policeman, and in this disguise
he was often yery mischievous. On several occasions he has torn the
cotton dress witness was in the habit of wearing off her back, and usin
very bad language, has sworn he would whip her. Recently he j
dressed himself up like a sort of sea-captain, and taken into custody
two friends of Miss W. South's, who were coming on a visit to wit-
ness. Could not say that she had seen him drunk, but he was very
fond of tippling (or ſi uoring as he called it), and would threaten to
shoot any one who declined to drink with him. He would sing snatches
of nigger melodies, such as Old Dan Tucker, and finish by cutting at a
piece of stick he always carried in his pocket.
The next witness called was Mons. Louis, examined by MR, PUNCH.
“I keep a large pension and garnished lodgings. I have known
MR. JonATHAN, since, many years... I should say that he was what we
call timbré. I have had the habitude of furnishing him with wine.
He seems to not know the use of money. He sometimes will fling his
dollars about, and then, he will, borrow large sums. He thinks
himself the richest ſº. in the world. He has ſquarrelled with
his dear half, MRS. JonATHAN, née VIRGINIE South, and is in a
reat anger because MADAME #um, will not interiºr in his ménage.
Two milords, SIR. WoRLDLY and SIR EBONY, have had the happy
idea to make the peace º M. JonATHAN and MADAME BULL;
but M. JonATHAN will have no arbitration, no more as for that will
MADAME B. M. JonATHAN has shown himself of great politeness
towards me lately, but I regard him as a great silly, and if I were in
the place of MADAME BULL, I would shut him up.”
The inquiry was again adjourned,
A PRIZE INCOME-TAX FOR 1862.
WHY should the Exhibition of 1862 be limited
to material articles? ...If it included political
and social inventions, it would conduce to the
promotion of objects at least as important
as Art and Manufacture. Contributions of a
moral and scientific character would have the
great recommendation of taking up very little
room.
Whilst there is time, therefore, let the world
be advertised that the Exhibition will be open
to receive things of that sort; constitutions,
§. of government, laws, statutes, and so
orth.
. In particular, let Europe be invited to send
in schemes of taxation framed on the principle
of equal and insensible pressure, so as to incom-
mode everybody as little as possible, and to cheat
nobody at all.
A prize might be founded by subscription
to reward the producer of an equitable Income-
Tax, or, if that is impossible, some other tax
which shall be a substitute for that. Is
there no financier, arithmetician, or mathema-
tician on the face of this earth able to solve
the problem of taxing everybody in proportion to
his means?
Even if a war with America should be averted,
the preparations for the event of that war already
made will probably entail upon us some aggrava-
tion of the national curse under which we are
assured by eminent authorities that we shall
have to groan hopelessly for ever. We might

calamity impartially distributed, and rendere

ow be.

case the prisoner named in the subjoined, police-report is a very fit
person for the office which he aspires to undertake:-
“HAMMERsMITH.—JAMEs SHEE, a young Irish labourer, who it was stated is a
candidate for the police, was charged with committing a savage assault.
*It appeared from the evidence that on the night of Saturday, the 14th ult, the
complainant, william Kessy, and some friends were together at the bar of the
George public-house, in the Broadway. The prisoner began to quarrel with a man
named MAloney, upon which the complainant went up and endeavoured to pacify
the disputants. On his doing so, the prisoner caught hold of the complainant's
thumb'between his teeth and bit the top completely off. It was found necessary at
the west London Hospital to amputate the thumb at the first joint.
… Mr. INgrººm sentenced the prisoner to a fine of £4 and 6s, costs, or to four
weeks' imprisonment, with hard labour.
“The prisoner was locked up in default.”
But really thumbs are very moderate at, the rate of only £46s, or
four weeks at the treadmill. A pocket handkerchief could hardly have
been appraised at a lower rate, had MR, SHEE filched one instead of
biting" ºsthumb off. He not only bites of a thumb like a dog
but he does it dog-cheap. Some peculiarity in this case not reported
must be supposed to account for the Magistrate's, exceedingly low
valuation of the member by which the human hand is distinguished
from that of the monkey, or else his Worship computed the cost of that
member by a most inadequate rule of thumb.

dress as above.
One would almost think the slave trade were flourishing among us
when one finds a lady vocalist talk of her “proprietor;” and when she
calls herself a “ticket,” one inclines almost to view it as another name
for “chattel,” which she holds herself to be. What on earth she
means by telling those who “wish a Novelty” to apply to “the Ticket
and not the Card,” we reluctantly must own our inability to guess.
We say reluctantly, because one's self-esteem is somewhat lowered
When ºne meets wiſh any problem that one's intellect can't sºlve.
What constitutes a “ticket,” and in what respects a “ticket” differs
from a “card,” are questions which to some people may seem quite
unimportant; but while they are unanswered, they clearly are in some
measure raised into significance by having puzzled even Punch.
WHO IS AN AMERICAN ?
SIMPLE as it may seem, this question, we confess, has perplexed us
much of late. It has been hard to escape talking about Transatlantic
matters, and it has been harder, when so doing, to avoid saying a word
or two of either blame or ridicule, much as one may try to keep aloof
from both. But whenever one has happened to find fault with the
misconduct of American affairs, one has been told “Oh, but you know
that it’s no fault of the Americans.” “It’s those confounded Irish,”
or “those infernal Germans” who have done the mischief; or else it’s
“the Rowdies,” or “the Bhoys” who are to blame for it. But as for
the Americans, they have had no hand in it. Whatever may have
chanced amiss has been no fault, of theirs. If their Government be
governed by uncrowned King Mob, his Majesty is not of true American
extraction., The Mob is of mixed breed, partly Irish, partly German,
partly, anything you please, excepting 'aught that can be anyhow
regarded as American.
o then are Americans? And if they exist, why don't they inter-
fere to save the good name of their nation? 'The country that is
boastedly the most free and most republican, is now most under the
despotism of a tyrannous democracy, composed, it is alleged, of aliens
and emigrants, who, are no more real Americans than the Turks are
Portuguese. 'The Rowdies, it is true, are living in America, and have
most of them been born there: Still one must on no account regard
them as Americans. They are virtually the rulers of America, may be;
and while, they are so, the Americans are a really enslaved people,
i. by the Rowdies, whom nevertheless they make no effort to
ethrone.
This at least is the conclusion that one is forced to come to, if one
believes there are such people as genuine Americans, neither Irish,
French, nor Germans, but Americans pur. sang. Their existence must
however be considered somewhat doubtful, and we ourselves incline to
place them in the list of extinct races, rather than submit to the alter-|h
native of viewing them as slaves under the dominion of the Rowdies
and the Roughs,
far more fitly emanate

THE RESIGNATION OF MB. BRIGHT.
(From the “Morning Star.”)
WE BLUsh. For BIRMINGHAM. It is unworthy to be represented by
the greatest orator, noblest patriot, and soundest statesman in the
world. MR. BRIGHT owes it to himself and the universe to resign his
seat for blundering, bloodshedding, blatant Birmingham. A vast meet-
ing has taken place, at which the working classes, those for whom he
has laboured so gloriously, were present in thousands, and in answer to
the moderate demand that they should call on the Government to sacri.
fice what is called the honour of England, they have in the most brutal,
uneducated, and un-Christian way, passed by an overwhelming majori,y,
a resolution that they have confidence in Loºp PALMERSto.N. Cºn-
fidence in LoRD PALMERston This from Birmingham, after M.R.
BRIGHT has expressly commanded them to have no confidence in Lond
PALMERston. Monstrously ungrateful and insolent as mobs have ever
been, we did not expect this, even from the dingy rabble of the Toy:
shop of Europe. They are more fearfully demoralised than we could
have believed. It must be that the large number of aristocratic mansions
in Warwickshire have exerted a poisoning influence upon the masses.
The lordly halls in those beautiful scenes must have sent out their
gorged menials, with beer in one hand and bribes in the other, and the
thousands of Birmingham blockheads have yielded to ducal debauchery.
But as they have made their bed, they must lie. We can scarcely
- - But they have
repudiated MR. BRIGHT and his teaching, and chosen to stand up for
a false honour, and now in his turn, he stands up for his own
honour, and repudiates them. We are authorised to state that MR.
BRIGHT, reluctant as he is even to seem to take office under the Crown,

“ARMA CANEMQUE 1 *
See Westminster Police Report on Friday, Jan. 3.
SING the fight of WALROND,
Sing the fight of Norton;
How a little terrier
War those houses brought on;
How a forfeit friendship
Blazed upon the altar;
All about a little
Terrier of Malta!
For eight pounds last summer,
Had Miss Norton bought it:
White it was and curly,
Pretty arts she taught it,
Sitting on its tail-end,
Begging tricks, so clever—
uch a pet one may lend,
Give away—no, never !
For Miss N. to Woolwicl
Came an invitation;
Where to leave her darling
Caused her perturbation;
Entertaining for it
An affection fervent,
How could she entrust it
To a menial servant?
In this strait perplexing,
Sudden she bethought her
Of her friend the fady
JANET WALROND's daughter.
Surely in her keeping .
Kindly she’d receive it:
Wash and comb and care for it;
Nor to hireling leave it!
To Miss JANET WALROND,
Thus her pet confided,
With her friends at Woolwich,
Calm Miss N. abided;
With her pet erratic, .
Eating, drinking, sleeping,
In aristocratic -
Custody and keeping.
But alas her faith in .
Female friend's devotion,
When a Maltese terrier
Sets the heart in motion!
Did Miss WALRoND really
Deem the dog a present?
Was the bait too potent,
Was the dog too pleasant?
Certain 'tis, Miss WALROND,
(Howe'er she excused it
When Miss Norton asked her
For the pet, refused it;
With distinct assertion,
(When to answer driven)
That the precious terrier
Was not lent but given!
All thereon that followed,
Muse be sweet and short on ;
Wain the task to picture
The despair of Norton.
To Miss JANET WALROND
First her knees she bended,
Then when prayers were idle,
Unto threats descended.
Then from words to actions,
In her wrath she passes;
Round the house of WALROND
Draws the lower classes.
Ringing at the door-bell.
Till the street,boys calling
“Give the lady's dog back,”
Make a row appalling.
Wain the invocation
Of the stern police-man:
Idle the suggestion
Of a friend as peace-man.
Never JANET WALROND,
Back her trust will tender!
Of her pet ne'er CAROLINE
NoRtoN make surrender'
*Twixt the house of WALROND
And the house of Norton,
Many moons all fiercely
Was this battle fought on.
Till at last as Deus,
Machinae descending,
ARNOLD beak was summoned
Thereof to make ending.
Swearing, counter-swearing
One the other, all round,
Met the house of Norton
And the house of WALRONn.
Ne'er was contradiction
Fiercer, fuller, flatter,
Than that hurled on both sides
In this mighty matter.
Still the strife waxed hotter,
Till beak Rhadamanthus
Felt a qualm of conscience,
adies' fire to fan thus.
If the casus belli
He could have divided,
I have not a doubt he
Would have so decided.
Here the “chose in action,”
Being indivisible, -
All attempts at compromise
"Twixt the foes seemed risible.
Had he hinted sev’rance
(I will stake my hand on 't)
Both for his deliv'rance
Had their claims abandoned.
War of words subsided
When, in corner driven,
ARNOLD, grave, decided
That the dog was given.
But no doubt Miss Norten,
Agitation hot in,
Somehow or another,
Had the fact forgotten'
Loud the house of WALROND
Crowed at the decision:
Sore the house of Norton
Wailed Miss C.’s position.
Ne'er to reconcilement -
Shall the feud be carried,
Till the pet is stolen,
And the ladies marricd!
A SMALL WOICE FOR THE SMALL BIRDS.
“Les Sportmen” have been having a fine time of it in France,
How many thousands of hares, rabbits, wild fowl, partridges and
pheasants, they have bagged in the last three months, has been set
forth in a paragraph which our papers have re-printed, and which
doubtless does not much º: the facts. How many larks, linnets,
sparrows, wagtails, wrens and titmice, “les Sportmen have been like-
wise so . as to bag, we have not at present any data to inform us;
but judging by the pockets we have seen turned out in France, and the
number of small birds with which each E. was surrounded, we
should say that some few millions must have recently been shot.
Now, some few months ago the Times republished a petition from
a number of French naturalists, clearly showing to their Government
what havoc must ensue from the ravages of insects, if their natural
devourers the small birds, were destroyed. It was shown that every
young family of sparrows demolished in their nest-hood a whole colony
of caterpillars, while the quantity of cockchafers consumed by Master
and Miss Titmouse before they left off being naked and came out in
full feather, was really so enormous that we could º it,
and could scarcely fancy that so very small a bird could have so very
large an appetite and crop. Naturalists, however, are not, men to
speak at random, or without full proof, if it be anyhow procurable; and
when it was stated that the wings of all these cockchafers were foun
about the nest, and were actually counted, it would have been ungentle-
manly to dispute the fact. . Kill the little birds, said the observant
naturalists, and you let § increase, and multiply the cockroaches an
caterpillars, and the myriad other hungry and havoc-making members
of the insectal tribe. As these increase, the crops of corn and fruit
diminish; and as flies, and slugs, and grubs, are very much more
difficult for man to catch and kill than they are for wrens and sparrows,
it is not wise in him to murder his natural allies, who can best assist
him in the warfare for the welfare of his crops that he must wage.
This being so, “les Sportmen” were petitioned (through the Gov-
ernment) to cease their murderous assaults, on titmice, larks and
linnets, and to reserve their small shot for rather larger game. And
that some such a petition might with fitness be addressed to certain
§. gunners also, this extract from a letter to the Times appears
to show:—
“It has been obvious to all who have had the opportunity and the . to
observe, that during the last few years the small birds have decreased considerably.
In a like ratio insects of the most destructive kinds have increased. I have had
excellent means of knowing that in various parts of the county of Kent whole crops
of fruit, vegetables, and grain have been swept off entirely by various kinds of
minute insects which the birds alone are competent to detect and destroy, and
which not one man in a hundred knows anything about. Men see their hopes
blasted, but they believe some ill wind has blown "a blight,' for under that vague
term they designate all such evils. In no localities have insects done so much
injury to the fruit as where “sparrow clubs' are established and where birds are
indiscriminately and systematically exterminated. For º: at a village in
Kent*::: are given for the heads of º: titmouse, and other birds which
feed almost exclusively on insects and their larvae. The gardens in that locality
are very extensive and are planted chiefly with plum-trees. In 1858 they promised
an extra-abundant crop, but long before the fruit was matured the larvae of the
winter-moth, upon wh ºn the b , especially the titmouse, feed, consumed almost
the entire crop. The birds had been destroyed.”
All ye who love plum tart send in your names at once as Putters
Down of Sparrow Clubs, and cut summarily the acquaintance, of all
idiots who belong to them. “Live and let live”. is a good human
motto, and, as applied to little birds, there is especial truth in it. In
d sooth, the fact appears to be that if we kill the sparrows, their deaths
will somewhat tend to the destruction of ourselves, for all our fruit
and crops will be demolished by the insects which the small birds now
iſ destroy. Therefore let this suicidal hedgerow warfare cease, and let
our farmers seek no longer to exterminate the sparrows, lest haply by
so doing they exterminate ourselves.
Mr. Punch's aim is usually to shoot folly as it flies;, but if Mr.
Punch this winter catches any sneaking fool, crawling behind º:
to get pot-shots at the sparrows, Mr. #. will have a shot with his
cudgel at the knave, without giving him a chance of flight from his
just punishment.
No. 1070.”

A COMPROMISE WITH AMERICA.
“MR. PUNCH, - - - -
“lf we are not at war with America by the time this letter
reaches you, perhaps you will have the kindness to publish a suggestion
which may prove the means of preserving peace.
“MR. Edwin JAMEs has, pronounced an opinion respecting the
legality, of the seizure of MEssRs. SLIDEIL and Mason, evidently
dictated by a mere desire to curry favour with the Yankee mob. What-
eyer MR. JAMES is, he is not a fool; and he must well know that the
violence offered by CAPTAIN WILKEs to passengers on board a neutral
ship bound from one neutral port to another was an illegal act, an act as
illegal, according to international law as embezzling money is according
to the law of England. MR., JAMEs pronounces an opinion with the
knowledge that, it is unsound, and with the intention of encouraging
the, mob i. a determination which, if maintained, must induce war
with * nd. Morally, is not this conduct treasonable? Is not MR.
EDWIN JAMEs a # traitor? Who would have expected him to
come to that £. If his antecedents had been those of a scoundrel, his
dislo §§ would have only been a deeper plunge into the mire of
º . But MR. Edwin JAMEs was an honest and honourable
ge #. as much as he was a patriot.
“Whether a British jury would actually convict him of treason, may
be questioned; but we have as much right to claim him as a traitor to
§§: and country, as the Yankee Skipper had to apprehend the
Southern Commissioners on the same ground.
*Christianity is part and parcel of the law of the United States.
What the Americans do unto others is always strictly that which they
would wish others to do to them. The deck of the Trent was as much
British ground as the pavement of the Broadway, New York, is
American, PRESIDENT LINGoIN, MR. SEWARD, the Government and
º: at large of the Federal States, will of course not object in the
|. the arrest of an alleged British rebel on any portion of their
erritory.
“Let A, B, C, and other members of the Police Force, constituting
a sufficient detachment, proceed to New York, or any other city in the
States which may be honoured by numbering the celebrated ex-Q.C.,
MR. Edwin JAMEs, amongst its residents; ſet them there lie in wait
for that ornament of the American Bar, of whom the British showed
itself unworthy. As soon as they can catch MR. JAMEs let them collar
him on an accusation of high treason and convey him on board a British
man-of-war. The American multitude, Ministers, and Chief Magis-
trate, will all be glad to acquiesce in submission to this reprisal,
whereby British honour will be satisfactorily vindicated; and then
arrangements can be peaceably made, between the ünited Kingdom
and the remainder of the United States, for the final adjustment of the
question about the rights of neutrals. -
“In the mean time, MR. Edwin JAMEs, if his indictment for treason
should appear unadvisable, might be quietly released, unless he should
be wanted by his captors on some other score; for perhaps it is not too
much to say that he is not likely to be wantéd here by anybody else,
unless by certain gentlemen at the Bar, mostly with an alias to their
names; members of that bar which disbars no barrister for swindling,
but hails him, on the contrary, as a smart fellow like the bar of
Yankeedom.

brilliant execution and his delicacy of touch. The Irish airs which form
a prelude to his song are as gracefully performed as they areº
combined, and he, so nearly has the power to make pianos speak, that
one almost hears the words of the old melodies he plays.
“In other respects than this the entertainment at the Gallery has
been touched up and improved since I last reviewed it. A couple of
songs for MPs. REED have with good effect been added; and her droll
new character of little (!) Dolly"Chickhiddy, the infanfile young lady
whose ‘Mamma won't bring her out,' is just one of those parts of
funny whimsical extravagance which are sure to please the public when
...} with good taste. º this point MRs. REED has ever been con-
iº and indeed my sole regret in seeing her on the platform at
the Gallery is that I can no more see her on the stage, where no one
yet has filled her place. -
“No, doubt I may be thought eccentric for my abstinence, but I
have let Christmas almost, pass without my going to a pantomime,
although there are some dºzen played to tempt me every evening.
Bnt pantomimes, like penny buns, are relished most in youth, and when
one gets out of a jacket one is apt to lose one's taste for them. More-
over pantomimes have nowadays had half their fun knocked out of
them, the jº. of their scenery being far more cared for than the
humour ºf their scenes. I would a new GRIMALDI would arise, and
i. all this, and make people go, to pantomimes tº have a hearty
laugh, and not to sit sedate and solemn through a “Transformation,”
leaying when the 'comic business' should, but don't, begin. .
“Still, pantomimes will always be popular at Christmas time, if only
for the sake of old associations, which at this special season are fresh in
ºvery memory, and which nobody of sense would wish men to forget.
, as a sure º: of how much pantomimes are cared for, the
Sunday, papers before Christmas º an extra flow of custom by
unravelling beforehand the ‘plots’ which would on boxing-night be

and other less momentous topics of the week. Nay, I have heard that
png great, author asked payment for the privilege of divulging thus
befºrehand his pantomimic story; though who can find much interest
in the mere plot of a pantomime, it puzzles all my powers of conjecture
to conceive.
“Mr. FechTER has retired for a while from the Princess's (when
he re-appears I hope his face will not be blacked); and MR. Wigan
as now ceased to manage the St. James's, his place being supplied by
MR. George VINING, than whom few know better how to strengthen
a weak part., M.R. Wigan in stage parlance is now “starring in the
provinces,’ which phrase might make one fancy he had taken to break
windows and was resident in France. But you know that in stage.

rison, of very small report. For one, I shall be º when MR. WIGAN

THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
At this present festive season
- eqple are expected to be particularly
..º.º.
rte
- - It is not everybody, however, that is apt at compli-
menting his friends off-hand, whenever he meets them. To do so one
must have either a natural genius for saying pleasant things, or else a
stock of compliments, at command, cut and dried." This latter, if
wanting, is, a want that may be supplied, to which end some help may
be afforded by the following hints:—
There is nothing which pleases a sensitive man so much as a remark
upon his personal appearance made to his face. Whenever, therefore,
a fat man comes in your way, fail not to tell him that he is getting
stout; and in accosting a thin one, express your concern to ºil. So
fallen away. One who is getting grey or bald, be sure always to remind
of the circumstance, with the a dition of some familiar"ºi facetiºns
observation, such as, “I say, old fellow, you are getting on,” or, still
more º to express what you mean, “Going, down hill—eh?”
“Aha! what, you’re losing, your teeth I?’ “ ºil." I say! Shaky
on the pins?” “What, obliged to wear specs? Sight failing?”
* Not hear what I said? By Jove—you’re getting awfully deaf.”
“Not recollect-ah! memory touched. Well, my boy, we must all
decay-sooner or later.”. Such are a few of the agreeable common
laces which you may address to those who have the advantage of
nowing you, as opportunity shall serve you to gratify them. Such
are the &mpliments of every Season. -
It is not merely that sensitive persons like to be playfully told of
personal defects of which *. may suppose them unconscious, but
they are peculiarly pleased, by the friendly interest and sympathy
which they discern to be the motives that induced you to take so
much notice of them. By merrily casting their deformities and infirmi-
ties in their teeth, moreover, you offer them, the delicate flattery of
inferentially giving them credit for philosophical strength of mind
superior to vanity. Moreover, i." relieve them of the embarrassment
of attempting to reply to you; for if your kind and gentlemanlike com-
ments on their personal appearance are undeniable, they can only echo
them, which is unnecessary; and if unfounded, they will not contra-
dict them, because it is not worth, while, and º: because they
may be unwilling to give you pain by inducing you to fear that you
have trodden on their corns; an apprehension which, of course, would
grieve you.

A SEASONABLE SPREE,
WE have much pleasure in commending the subjoined extract from
the Times to the notice of fast young men of affluence:—
“New YEAR FEAsts.—On Thursday, the 2nd inst., Miss BURDETT Coutts enter
tained at a New Year's dinner more than 300 poor people in the school-rooms of
St. Stephen's, Westminster. The Bishop of Honolulu was present, with several
clergymen connected with the Abbey and neighbouring parishes of Westminster.”
For a “lark,” what bit of fun could be finer than that of entertaining
a lot of poor Fº at dinner, after the manner of Miss BundETT
Coutts? Such an act of generosity would be just as good a joke as
treating worse than worthless persons in the Haymarket and the pur-
lieus of that objectionable thoroughfare. STERNE wanted to see how
an ass would eat a maccaroon. It would be full as interesting to
observe with what relish a number of paupers would devour turtle-
soup, and drink champagne. To procure the attendance of a Bishop or
two, and some, Clergymen, as Miss CouTTs did, would be quite a
cheesy idea, and perfectly feasible, for divines cannot but approve of a
banquet ºfexactly according to the directions for a dinner-party
given in a certain professional book supposed, to form the peculiar
subject, of their studies. Most reverend gentlemen, moreover, like
good dinners, according to DEAN Swift, whose lady's maid in Hamil.
ton's Bawn observes— `
“I ne'er know a parson without a good nose.”
and a dinner combining material with moral goodness would be an
irresistible attraction to the cloth. For want of any more exciting kind
of amusement, it might really be worth the while of any fortunate
youth about Town to try feeding the hungry.

SAM WARREN, inquiring de die in diem.
The question's Is Titmouse as sane as most men?

HUMPHREY AND HUMBUG.
ASTROLOGY seems to have an attraction for ALDERMAN, HUMPHREY.
One day we find him puffing ZADKIEL, and the next putting RAPHAEL
to his purgation...We are half inclined to let the one deed balance the
other, and to forgive the Alderman for his burst of admiration at the
impudent Quack, in consideration of the sharp and steady jobation he
bestowed upon the impudent Jew. In the first case HUMPHREY called
the attention of the reporter to the fact that the humbug, ZADKIEL,
who has been “guessing ” at everybody's death for the last dozen
years, at last was right in saying that a distinguished person would be
removed in 1861. e were in a rage when we saw HUMPHREY excited
by such trash, and had just given orders to our own astrologer to
prophesy “a fearful misfortune” for HUMPHREY himself on the 15th
August neart, only we could not make up our minds whether we should
announce that he would lose his watch, make his nose bleed, or have
his hair cut too short. While we were perpending, we received the
report of the RAPHAEL case. Here an old Jew, who was interrogated
by the Alderman as to the details, of a queer looking case, andſ who
contradicted himself in the most flagrant manner, tried to bully the
Alderman, talked about being insulted, threatened to refuse to reply,
and fºlly behaved so ill, that it was pleasant to see HUMPHREY
tackle him. The Alderman was like Rodmond, in the Shipwreck, with
the harpoon over the dolphin :—
“HUMPHREY, unerring, o'er his head suspends
The barbed steel, and every turn attends,
Back, for a better cast, a moment drew,
Then, plunging, struck the unconverted Jew.”
The process was so well managed, and RAPHAEL was so neatly pinned,
that we resolved to forgive the ZADKIEL nonsense. But no more
puffing of quacks, ALDERMAN HUMPHREY, or we may have the gift of
prophecy on us.

Imposing Stature in the Carte de Visite.
THE YAHOOS OF THE YANKEE PRESS.
THE ridiculous want of conscientiousness, consistency, and shame,
evinced by the American Press in discussing the Trent affair has
led the Times to the conclusion that the articles in certain Yankee
journals most remarkable for deficiency in morality, modesty, and logic,
are the work of other than American hands; of hands such as those
which may be conceived to have registered the º of BARRY
LYNDoN ; hands which appear to have exchanged the shillelagh for the
pen. That this view is partially, at least, correct, nobody can doubt
who considers the subjoined extract from that highly respectable family
newspaper, the New York Herald:—
“There are five millions of Irish ready to throw off the British yoke, and to aid
the American ...'. when she gives the signal for the retribution of British
wrongs, never to be forgiven till they are redressed and avenged.”
The wrongs described as never to be forgiven till they are avenged
can possibly have been so described by nobody but a frantic Irishman.
Any other savage, the stupidest in the world, would have known that a
wrong could not be avenged first and forgiven afterwards. The passage
above quoted is as genuine a specimen of a Bull as ever was exhibited
by an Irish Member in the House of Commons. It is a Fº Irish
bull, not Americanised in the least; a bull without a cross of the buffalo,
It proclaims the nationality of its author as plainly as it could if he had
uttered it, by word of mouth, in the richest brogue. It denotes him to
be an Irishman of a peculiar class; one which exists, and is more or
less numerous in every nation, but is much less numerous in Ireland now
than it was before its numbers had been greatly reduced by emigration
to the United States. This particularly mad bull, and à the other
characteristic effusions of Irish malignity which render the Federal

man who in haranguing on the fisheries question some years ago,
assigned, as one reason why his countrymen should persist in poaching
in our waters, the circumstance that “they were very valuable.” That
paralysis or absence of the moral sense, which is so diverting when
exhibited by a Clown in a pantomime, is a complaint or a defect at least
as prevalent among native Yankees as it is among the reinforcements
which, the American populace, derives from the refuse of Ireland.
Would that the complaint may be always curable without bleeding !
MAGIC SAILORS.
WE have for some weeks past been haunted by a certain “Magic
Sailor,” who has stared us in the face in almost every newspaper, and
even has been present to us in our own fly-leaf. He is said therein to
be “a characteristic figure, which dances, kee sing time to music”
(and that’s more than some young swells º “greating roars, of
laughter, defying detection; ” and another of his good qualities is, that
he “can be sent post free for eighteen, stamps.” But for this latter
statement we might have thought this Magic Sailor formed one of
those belonging to our Naval Reserve; for this body really seems to
have sprung up by magic, so suddenly and swiftly has it grown to a
reat force. It “defies detection,” too, of any want of loyalty, as has
een shown by the alacrity with which it has stepped forward, and has
made the Government an offer of its services, whenever there be need
to call them forth. Indeed this insult to our flag has flown like magic
through our fleet, and there is no doubt that at any time, should it
be repeated, our sailors one and all will act as Magic Sailors, and,
as though touched by wizard's wand, will do whatever bidding may be
needful for our honour, as well as for their own.

22 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [JANUARY 18, 1862.
INDIGNATIO VERSUM.
MR. BRIGHT and MR.
CoppeN have been
publishing poetry in
their respected or-
gan, and that of
America, the Morn-
tng Star. The Ame-
rican crisis has
brought out the
Fº powers of
he two gentlemen,
and they ".
assail the Englis
journals that have
taken the English
view of the late diffi-
culty. To this course
there can be no fair
objection; the Star
and the New York
Herald are as much
entitled to their side
of the question as
English newspapers
are to their own
views. In all fair
play Mr. Punch offers
the advantage of his
- vast circulation to
the poetical effusions of MEssRs. BRIGHT, and, Cobden, which otherwise might be
read only in a limited and uneducated circle. He regrets that he has not space for
the whole of the poems, but has selected the very best verses. The one poet
attacks the Times, the other ventures upon Mr. Punch. We give the pas to MR.
BRIGHT's onslaught upon the elder journal:—
FACIT
“WAR.
“Morning Star, January 7.
“Last year it was the Frank, “Though millions run to wastol
Lay like a couchant pard, And thousand lives are lost I
To leap upon our flank,
If he caught us off our guard. “Yet blood blood blood;
Screams the sanguinary Times?
Oh God that miscreants should (shud)
Grow rich upon their crimes :
“The frenzy came and went,
And now we're hounded on,
Our annual bile to vent
On prostrate JonATHAN (thon). “And when the poor complain,
With cheeks and fingers blue,
Lay them upon the plain,
Of another Peterloo !"
Allowances must be made for a middle-aged genileman, but a young poet. The
rhyming “on” to “Jon AthAN,” and “blood” to “shud,” may be referred to the
provincial dialect, but “complain” with “plain” is less defensible. But these are
. º the sun, or rather upon the Star; and as MR. CHARLEs DANCE has
observed, in one of his wittiest burlesques:—
“Blood give us blood to tastel
No matter what the cost
“O, Madam, when a man is in a flurry,
He hasn't time to think of LINDLEY MURRAY.”
The delicacy and grace of the poem, its truthfulness, and its logic, are worthy of
the school, whence it, emanates, and should elevate it above the sphere of aristo-
cratic criticism, which fastidiously refuses, as GEORGE HERBERT says, “to pick
out treasures from an earthen pot,” and distrusts sentiment clothed in bad grammar.
Congratulating MR. BRIGHT on his poetical success, let us pass on to the more
º and humorous strains of his friend MR. CoRDEN, who, justly regardin
ſ unch as addicted to fun, deems it proper to be funny in remonstrating ...;
“THE COUNTRY COUSIN'S ADDRESS TO PUNCH.
“Morning Star, January 9.
-- Wºº. what makes you foam and rile “Your fun has into brimstone turn'd,
About the Yankees so? Hence all your fulminations:
Sure you have got a fit of bile, Will nothing do for squibs and jokes
That makes you furious, oh! But war with other nations?
“Have you been bitten by the Times,
Or what has raised your choler?
Now take it easy, Punch, my boy,
And do not rave and holler.
“Now, |. abate your fighting spleen,
And try a little reason,
And hatch at least a joke or two,
At this most joking season."
Now this, as comic poetry, appears to Mr. Punch to be very meritorious. The
"oh,” in the first verse may not seem exactly called for; but rhymes are as
. as democrats, and “so" demanded “oh,” though “wo !” the carter's
exclamation, or “bo,” the Suffolk endearment, and many other words will occur to
MR. CoppeN, under similar difficulties, when he shall have had more practice in
composition. We regret to see that both poets are unaware that the same syllables
should not be used twice, and MR. BRIGHT's, “complain,” and “plain” are paral-
leled by MR. Coppen's “nations” and “fulminations.”. Still, the verses do the
authors credit. The American Muse has almost invariably (not that we forget
- º one.) been a Mocking Bird, and we must not
e hypercritical.
The words...of Mercury, are harsh after the songs of
Apollo, and Mr. Punch will abstain from any further anno-
tations, rejoicing that his humble efforts have been the
means of §: such delightful music from the American
-
NO FUSS WITH SLIDELL AND MASON,
To the People of Southampton.
MY DEAR PEOPLE,
HURRAH! SLIDELL and MAsoN are surrendered—
and QUEEN ANNE is no more. Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!
We shall soon have the Southern Commissioners over here.
They will very likely land at your port: and that is why I
now address you.
You are, a most hospitable People, a highly enthusi-
astic People, a People much addicted to demonstrations
of all kinds, especially to demonstrations complimentary
to distinguished foreigners who do themselves, the honour
of paying you a visit. , You glorify them and give, them
grand dinners, on which occasions your orators make the
most º speeches, in honour of your guests, on things
in greneral.
'ou feasted Kossuth some years ago, and the other day
you feasted the ARchduke of Austria. Apparently you
don’t much mind whom you feast, provided it is a celebrity.
But pray now don't go feasting SLIDELL and MAsoN.
We have narrowly escaped from being involved in a war
because of a motion on the part of the Yankees that we
sympathise with the South. It is advisable for us to abstain
from any act which may tend to confirm that absurd but
inveterate persuasion. They are as mad as snakes because
the Nashville is lying in your docks. If you ask SLIPELL
and MAsqN to dinner, and drink their healths, and have
them and your orators spouting and speechifying, and
extolling the British Lion, Yankee Doodle, who does not
understand your enthusiastic hospitality, and demonstra-
tiveness, will assuredly regard your welcome of the
Southern Commissioners as a declaration on the part of
the people of England for the Confederate side. Invite
those gentlemen to dine at your own houses if you like,
but beware lest, by giving them what Continental editors
call an “ovation,” you cause all of your country-men to
be lumped by the Yankees as Confederates with , the
Southern Confederacy. Be pleased, therefore, to deny
yourselves on this occasion, for once, the gratification of
feasting illustrious strangers, and oblige your obedient
humble servant, 39Ulſh City.
P.S. My advice to you is also my advice to Liverpool.
N.B. SLIDELL and MAson can have little power to
promote the commercial interests of Southampton.
ENDLESS RESOURCES.
IN that º of purity and honour, the New York Herald,
we find the following promise to pay:—
“The storm may blow over, but it will leave a debt of abuse from
England to be repaid hereafter by America."
We must say that “a debt of abuse” would be about the
very last debt that America would ever likely to repu-
diate. In fact, why need she be guilty of dishonesty, when
the resources she has at her command are so inexhaustible
as to be more than sufficient to meet every claim of that
nature that might be made upon her? Were the entire
World her customers in abuse, we have not the slightest
doubt but that she would pay every one of them in full.
Thanks to its Press, it is the one source of wealth that
America is never likely to be bankrupt in. When the hour
of payment, as generously indicated above by the New
Fork Herall, does arrive, we propose that, in considera-
tion of his superior efficiency in that department, Mr.
GoRDON BENNETT be appointed pay-master, Qnly let him
draw upon his imagination, and we will back him to repay
any amount of abuse. He is so liberal in this respect,
that it must have been a mistake on the part of Nature
when she made him a Scotchman. The O’Don YAhoo might
fairly claim him as a brother.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
ERTAINLY,
Punch, for fathers of
large families and for
kind old bachelor un-
cles (may the bumps
of their benevolence
never grow a shadow
less () Christmas, as
now kept, is a rather
costly time. What with
Christmas trees and
Christmas presents
Christmas sights an
Christmas pantomines,
there are plenty of
temptations for spend-
ing one's spare silver,
and when one sees how
great a pleasure a few
shillings will procure,
it is difficult to with:
stand the allurements
of the time. Besides,
Avu NCULUS or PATER
may have themselves
a relish for juvenile
amusements, and may
like to sce a pantomime not alone to hear their children laugh, but to
laugh themselves. I know that certain solemn, staid and sober people
affect to fancy that our age is too enlightened for such pastimes, and
that an evening with an Orrery or some stale Dissolving, Views, or a
º long-winded lecture about Optics or Pneumatics, the Air-pump
or the
than the frivolºus and uninstructive pleasures of the stage. But I
never shall believe that such can really be the case, while I see such
happy faces every Christmas at the Theatre; and if I ever meet a child
(I have never met one yet) who will profess to hate a pantomime and
to love a lecture, I shall look upon that infant as a pitiable object,
or else a young impostor whom I should wish to pinch.
“There must be grown up children who retain a lingering remnant
of their liking for a pantomime, as there are men who yet eat pancakes
and enjoy a hot cross bun. Indeed, I can’t help fancying their number
is increasing, for every year the theatres are more and more attended
for their pantomimes alone, and the largest is kept open solely by the
profits of its pantomimic season. I suppose that it must be to please
these #. children that the scenery each Christmas is more pro-
minent and splendid, and every year the stage effects are made more
highly spiced.
“Children not grown up are by nature inexpensive and simple in
their tastes, and a touch of the hot poker will more charm the
infant mind than any quantity of tinfoil, gas and glitter and red
fire. Watch the house the while a Gorgeous Transformation Scene
unfolds itself, and see the listless look that pervades the younger faces,
followed not infrequently by the actual gape. But directly Clown
appears and floors and jumps upon old Pantaloon, the little eyes all
sparkle, and the little hands are clapped, and the little lips are parted
by the joyous little laugh. -
“Of all places of amusement there are few more fit for children than
the Crystal Palace, and at Christmas it is made especially attractive to
them, and this year more than ever such has been the case. That
fº Christmas Tree alone is worth a "; to jº and every
aterfamilias who either can’t or won't afford the cost and care of
having one in his own house ought to take his olive-branches to the
Crystal Tree, and treat them to a fair share of its crystallised as well
as its less edible, yet doubtless hardly more enduring, fruits. There is,
besides, a Christmas Fair, so stocked with pretty, playthings that
fathers with full pockets are half tempted to infanticide, by loading
their small children with more toys than they can carry, and buying
them more shillingsworths of sugarplums and sweeties than their young
digestions are fitted to consume. Moreover the ‘Great MACKNEY” is
there with his blacked face, to warble, nigger songs which would fall
flat without it: while the wondrous ‘Perfect Cure’ with his incessant
foot-high jumps throughout a song that lasts five minutes, shows that
lungs when helped by legs may make the worst of music popular. And
then, as a climax, there’s the ‘pantomimic drama,’ wherein Mosspºrt
BLONDIN in the character of a monkey does such tricks as must delight
all the ‘young monkeys’, who behold him, and may tempt them when
at home to practise walking up the banisters, or play at football
witn the baby, or take a lot of flying leaps from chair to chair across
}: drawing-room, in imitation of the acrobats when doing the
rapeze.
my dear
iving bell, is now far more to the taste of the rising generation
“ONE WHO PAYS.”
A PRETTY SITE FOR A KING.
M. Thouvrnel is again º; upon CARDINAL ANTONELLI the
expediency of getting rid of FRANcis THE SEcond. He wishes that
dethroned monarch §: de Roi, as we might now call him) to
select any place but Rome for his residence. Of course, if BoMBALINo
could have his choice, he would give the preference to Naples over
every other capital. We think we can meet his wishes in this respect.
At BURFORD's Panorama, there is at present exhibiting, a capital view
of Naples. It is so like the original, that the oldest lazzaroni would
not be able to tell the difference. There is the Bay, Vesuvius, St.
Angelo, everything complete. The couleur locale is so charming that
it is difficult to believe one is in Leicester Square. There is, also, a
British man-of-war with a British admiral on board. Its steam is
already up, and it could be hailed as º as a cab in case there was
any necessity for immediate escape. hy then doesn't FRANCIS take
up his quarters at this Panorama? By § means, he could still live
in Naples, without being in the slightest danger. If he has any poetry
in his soul, he might easily cheat himself into the belief that he was the
monarch, of all he surveyed. We have no doubt, that MR. BURFORD
would allow him to live there rent free, if His Majesty would but con-
sent to have himself advertised amongst the other attractions of the
place. Without a question, a live King would draw. It is not every
day that one has a chance of seeing a monarch with so many claims to
º admiration as young BOMBA ' When FRANCIS was getting a
ittle stale, his wife might iſen be thrown in to revive the furor.”ff
she would appear in male costume, and every now and then smoke a
cigar, all London would be sure to run after her. Care, however,
should be taken that the Royal LoLA MonTEs is not permitted to have
a horsewhip, or any offensive Nº. in her hand, or else the public
". fear to approach her playful ajesty aS dutifully as they otherwise
Would.
We think the great good sense of our proposition will recommend it
to the notice of all politicians, as it very #. gets over an European
difficulty. It removes BQMBA from Italy, and yet º him to live
once more in his own capital. However, as we should like his Majesty
to be as comfortable as possible in his new quarters, we suggest that
one little obstacle be instantly removed. In this same panorama,
GARIBALDI is the principal figure. Now, as it is clear that FRANCIS
would take immediately to his legs the moment he saw the shadow of
the Sayiour of Italy, the latter must be induced to retire from the mimic
scene before the illusion can be made perfect in the eyes of the former.
The two never could inhabit the same spot, and besides, GARIBALDI
has the real Naples to console himself with. We hope, therefore, soon
to be able to announce the departure from Rome of the Ex-KING OF
NAPLEs and suite, and their safe arrival at BURFoRD's Panorama,
Leicester Square.
THE PAPAL PEDIGREE.
THE POPE has been indulging in another of his usual profanities,
things which make it necessary for the heads of Čatholic families to
look carefully into his Holin Ess's speeches before leaving them about
for the ladies and children of the family to see. He has been comparing
himself to DAVID, and Louis NApoleoN, the son of the Church, to
ABSALOM, and reminding his audience that ABSAIOM was slain hanging
from a tree. But for mixing levity with revered history, we should say
that judging by appearances, it is the Pope himself who is “up a tree”
just now. But the Hol Father did not say, he only implied, that
ABSALOM was not killed § the tree, but was assassinated, stabbed, by
a blood-thirsty friend of DAVID himself. Has Pope Pius blessed the
dagger of a JoAB : Or has his Holiness sent out so many assassins
into his own dominions that he has no more to spare. Truly this Evil
old man must come of the blood of the Borgias.
A Masonic Ditty.
SING high diddle diddle,
The Colleague of SLIDELL,
Released from the Stone Jug, or bason,
And by England received,
May now be believe
“A Free, and an accepted MASON.”
N.B. Mr. Punch would have liked to make this last line better, but
the false accent is dear to the Craft.
A STATIONARY CORPS,
WE hear of a constitutional force in Canada entitled the Sedentary
Militia. Were it composed of rascally Rowdies instead of gallant
Canadians, we would propose that the Sedentary Militiamen should
receive the name of “ £i. Squatters.”

WHAT WE OWE TO WILKES.
We hope, when Parliament meets, that it will pass a vote of thanks
to brave ºld ÖArtAiN WILKEs, for his gallant and undaunted seizure
of the Trent, and heroic capture of two unresisting “rebels.” But for
this bold exploit we ... should have passed a very dreary winter.
There is generally a dearth of news in the dull season, and this year
would have formed no exception to the rule, had not the brave WILKEs
come and seen and conquered as he nobly did. He has gained the
thanks of his own country, it is true, and has been speechified and
feasted doubtless to his heart's content. But something surely might
be done to testify our thanks, for his having given us a most prolific
topic for daily conversation. Would he like a statue? or a spittoon :
or a whittling knife? or, as he seems expert in blowing }. Own
trumpet, shall we invite him over here to our next Brass Band Contest,
and salute him upon entering with “See the Conquering Hero Çomes *.
The Captain certainly has not a small amount of brass about him, and
as he has proved himself a man of metal, a contest of this kind would
be doubtless to his taste. His aim throughout has been to make a
noise in the world, the same as other trumpeters, and in this he has in
some degree succeeded, though the noise which he has made has been a
rather empty sound. Still, as we have said, something must be done
for him to testify our thanks; and meanwhile, until the right thing is
suggested, we beg leave to present him with the Freedom of the Punch
Ollice—that is to say, we shall make free to poke our weekly fun at
him as long as we think fit.
Extravagance of the Law.
Loud has been the public outcry against the shameful waste of
money in a still-pending lunacy case. However, great as the outlay
undoubtedly has been, it must appear comparatively small to a Judge,
who, unaided, and with his own single hand, successfully managed in a
very short space of time to run through his Ten Thousand a Fear /
FIGHTS TO COME.
(From the “Belligerent Life.”)
GREAT excitement prevails in the pugnacious world at this moment
on account of the expected fight between Tuscarora, the Northern pet,
and the Southern Dodger, Nashville. It may be remembered that Nash-
ville met Harrey Birch some short time ago and entirely demolished him
after a round or two. Harvey Birch went down, having received “a
hot un,” which knocked him out of time.
Nashville was much the stronger party, and came off without a scratch.
Tuscarora promises to be a very different customer to Harvey Birch,
and is superior in science, and power of hitting to Nashville; but pluck
goes a great way, and the Southern Dodger does not appear down on its
ſuck. We hear that Sumter, the American Slasher, is on his way to
Southampton to challenge Tuscarora should Nashville get the worst of
it in the anticipated encounter. The police are on the alert, and may
perhaps put the kibosh on this little affair.
NEEDLESS TROUBLE.
“The singers composing the Llanddyfman and Llanfairmathafarneithaf choirs
were entertained to dinner and tea at the REv. W. WILLIAMs's residence at Tyddyu
on New Year's Day. We recommend our English friends not to attempt to rºad
this paragraph aloud."—Oswestry Advertiser.
THE Ostrestry Advertiser is a very nice paper, and its recommen-
dations are, we are sure, offered in the kindest spirit. But we beg
to assure our friend that we have not the slightest intention of reading
the above paragraph aloud. We are tired of the Du Chaillu contro-
versy, and do not wish to bother our friends with any more information
about the Gorilla countries, two of which we suppose the above-named
laces to be. The REv. W. WILLIAMs's zoological investigations, and
indness to the creatures in question, however, deserve all praise, and
we suppose that a paper by him will be read at the next meeting of the
Regent’s Park Society.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GEMS FROM THE WEST.
EveRYTHING being now serene in the American direction, Mr.
Punch proposes to begin to renew his expressions of admiration of a
good many American institutions. And in the first, place he begs to
signify his entire admiration of the kindness of the trans-Atlantic
journals in forwarding the private views of citizens and citizenesses
Our papers are mercenary and exclusive. Any dodger or swindler, who
can put his advertisements into a decently decorous and tradesmanly
ſorm, can advertise as much and as long as he likes. But affairs of the
heart are treated with much harshness; and any advertisement that
might be called a Gusher, would be sternly rejected by the clerk, with:
out his taking the trouble to count the words. Even the celebrated
Second Column is carefully edited, and we believe vigilant watch is
kept lest the effusions of enamoured or bereaved lovers should find
their way among the ciphers, and invocations to bolting better halves.
But under the softer skies of America the clerks are gentier. Here is
a little list of advertisements which Mr. Punch cuts from a New York
paper sent him by LoRD Lyons:—
EDWIN-MEET ANNIE WITH THE HUNDRED CURLS at
214, Wooster Street, between this and Tuesday.
F THE YOUNG LADY DRESSED IN BLACK SILK DRESS,
heavy black cloak, black velvet hat, walking with young lady wearing
stone coloured dress, also with gentlemen, and who particularly recog-
nised a gentleman corner of Broadway and Eleventh Street, who after-
wards passed at New York Hotel and there stopped, would favour the
said gentleman with an acquaintance, address ToM FENNEL, Union
. Square Post-office, stating when and where.

dropped in a Fourth Avenue omnibus on Saturday evening, by

discouraged. Hope for the best. S. G.

ing with a lady of refinement and education, with the view of
forming an acquaintance with her, which, should he survive the war,
might lead to a happy union. He would request a carte de visite of the
correspondent to be enclosed, which will be returned by mail, and, with
communication, keep strictly Wºº, upon his honour. Address CAPT.
BATCHELor, Newport News, Va.
A WIDOW, CALLED DESIRABLE, POSSESSING MEANS, WoulD
like to correspond with a middle-aged or elderly gentleman com-
fortably situated, with a view to matrimony. Address STRANGER,
Station D, Bible House Post Office.
ATRIMONY.—PERSONS OF EITHER SEx WISHING TO AC-
quire the art of psychologic fascination, enabling them to win the
affections of anyone they wish to marry, can do so by enclosing a stamp-
directed envelope to T. WILLIAMs & Co., Publishers, Box 2,300 Post-
Office, Philadelphia.
This last is a clincher, and º: to all the advertisers. Can we
not shame our own gold press into something more like heart? Suppose
our American friend, the Star, sets the example, and opens a column
to this sort of thing. We will be a frequent contributor.

LAUDATURAB HISS.
THERE has been a row
at the Odéon in Paris,
which row, being led by
the friends of the Old
PoPE, may be called an
O.P. row. It seems emi-
nently ridiculous. M. ED.
sºsºs Mosd Abºut writes a
=P" ºf play, called Gaëtana, and
tº: M; ABOUT, has
elsewhere written against Rome, a cabal condemns his drama, without
hearing it. This is a small revenge by the priest party, but the Master
of France has had an opportunity of comprehending what the clerical
faction would do if it dared. It is a great comfort, and a safeguard for
mankind, that º can seldom keep their tempers long, and that they
begin barking before they can bite...We doubt, whether the Odéon has
done much for the Vatican—meantime we will do the Pope's work,
and canonise M. ABout as EDMOND the Confessor and Martyr.
WORK FOR PENWOMEN.
THE possibility of successfully º: young ladies in situations

A ROAR FROM JOHN BULL.
I AM a Bull, a quiet Bull;
Wish not to quarrel any more:
No lambkin milder walks in wool;
Until provoked, I never gore:
And that’s just why, when forced to fight,
To push and toss I do not cease,
With all my soul and strength and might,
Until I re-establish peace.
A Bull I am begirt with brutes,
Wolves, bears, and tigers, beasts of prey,
I wish they'd mind their own pursuits,
And not keep getting in my way.
My aim is ever to stand clear
Of all concern with their affairs;
But not a jot l’ll yield, for fear
Of any tigers, wolves, or bears.
- Those Yankees, when they knew that I
Don’t like it, oh! how could thcy be
Such stupid creatures as to try
To injure and impose on me?
They’ve seen what I can bear, and spend,
Aggressive insolence to stem,
War I should rue; but, in the end,
'Twould be a great deal worse for them.
Would aliens only not molest
Me, and cach other leave alone
No more for self-defence assesse
Should I beneath taxation groan;
On this or that, or tºother side,
Some neighbour always menaced by,
Armed to the teeth I’m forced to bide;
Oh, what an ill-used Bull am I?

“A CoRRESPONDENT of the Times, under the signature of
“An English Churchman,’ complains that the Bishop of Roch EstER's
test for insuring the ability of clergymen to read, is inadequate. The
bishop requires candidates for ordination to produce certificates of the
sufficiency of their voice from their parish priest, or some personal
friend, and to stand a trial of their audible powers in a church, by a
reverend examiner appointed by the prelate himself for that purpose.
º: * of this plan is intimated by the ‘English Churchman’ to
e Sinail.
“If the Bishop of RocIIESTER, and his brethren in lawn, were
accustomed to patronise the drama as much as they might, considering
the highly respectable and moral character which it now bears, they
would see how the voice of a young actor, if inaudible, very soon gets
raised to the required pitch; Cries of “Speak up !’ resounding ſº
both the upper and lower, regions, of the }. generally produce an
immediate rise of tone. The would-be performer soon learns how to
render the request unnecessary, or perceives the necessity of retiring
from the stage. Now, could not the stage be used as a school for the
F. We do sometimes observe ji, in the pulpit which would
have made a fortune on the stage *
“I don't mean, Mr. Punch, to propose that young clergymen should,
as a condition to ordination, be required to go throug 1 a series of
representations of such performances as Turning the Tables, High Life
Below Stairs, or Bor and Coa, as these are imbued with a comicality
perhaps rather too broad to be consistent with the decorum expected of
a candidate for orders, though they would serve admirably to train up
a youth intended for the Tabernacle in the way he should preach, or
lecture on Shrews and the Gorilla. Nor do I even suggest Macbeth or
Qthello, or Richard III.; though the bishops surely might stand Hamlet.
But * not let the 'prentice parsons practise elocution in the perform-
ance of mysteries, and miracle-plays, which some of your young men
might write as well as any of CARDINAL WISEMAN’s, who dramatised
tº
his Fabiola for him—unless he did it himself. Let us have a new
clerical playhouse, built, if necessary, in one of the mediaeval styles
of architecture, to be called....The Bishops’’, or . The Bishops'
Theatre, and further styled ‘Theatre Episcopal. This might be a
High Church Theatre; the opposite party might give their series
of serious performances in Exeter Hall. The money taken at the
doors might, after º the necessary expenses, go to º of
Church Extension; Hig urch Extension on the one hand, and Low
Church Extension on the other; whilst the Broad Church likewise
might open a House of its own, and raise funds with a view to Broad
§.". Each House might play its own peculiar class of
pieces, and, contemporary dramatic talent failing to yield a suitable
supply, they might all at any time fall back upon the Sacred Dramas of
Miis. HAN Air More.
“One important advantage of the establishment of clerical theatres
would be, that they would afford employment in the capacities of walking
reverend gentlemen, supermumeraries, and scene-shifters, to those ne:
cessitous clergymen now out of work, for whom if the Church can find
nothing better to do, and cannot afford them out-door relief, it might as
well provide them with theatrical engagements at any rate as leave
them to starve. What would the spiritual peers say just now to a
Serious Pantomime, in which poor young Curates .." |. aS
Clown and Harlequin, their wives as Columbine, and aged and decrepit
clergymen, as Pantaloon? That the idea is absurd? Not so absurd,
Mr. Punch, as the starvation of clergymen amidst ecclesiastical 3.
Such at least is the opinion of your constant subscriber and devo
admirer, “GRAVITAs.”
“P.S. A sort of clerical dramatic entertainment is now in course of
performance in the Court of Arches; I allude to the farce of SARUM
v. WILLIAMs, which seems rather likely to have a run.”

BLACKIE ON HIS BREED.
N Friday night last week, a
lecture on the nationality
and character of a peculiar
eople was delivered at the
lasgow Athenaeum _by
PROFEssoR BLACKIE. The
eculiar people on which a
łº, would be best
qualified to lecture may be
supposed to be negroes
rather than Jews, or any
other branch of the human
family. Such a conjecture,
however, is worthy only o
a creature the most con-
temptible of mankind, in
PROFEssoRBLACKIE’s sight
—a Cockney. The name of
BLACKIE, by the readers
of Punch, is of course asso-
ciated with that nationality
which flourishes North of
the Tweed. The nationality
- and character on which he
lectured were the Scotch,
or Scottish, to speak by the Caledonian card. The perusal of the sub-
joined extracts from the Professor's discourse will º the question,
since he delivered it after dinner, How much toddy had auld BLACKIE
hadº. There is much, spirit in its very commencement; BLACKIE thus
opening with a flourish of bagpipes:—
s
%
-
(s
“PROFEssoR BLACKIE, who on rising was warmly received, said it gave him great
leasure to be allowed to speak on the subject of Scottish nationality in what he
É. to be the Capital of Scotland, so far at least as Scottish life and national §§
were concerned. He did not speak merely as a flaming, blazing, smoking Scotc
patriot, but as a thinker, and as a philosopher; and whatever the Cockneys might
say against Scotland, they did not and could not deny that one Scotchman had as
much thinking and speculation in his noddle as twenty or a hundred Englishmen.”
So,PROFESSOR BLACKIE by his own account speaks as a thinker and
a philosopher, and as a flaming, blazing, smoking Scotch patriot too.
Shall we say that he confutes his countryman Macbeth, who asserts that
no man can be temperate and furious in a moment P Well, the tem-
perance is doubtful, The patriot must have been drinking as well as
smoking. The Professor was nae fou, certainly, nae that fou, but surely
had just a drappie in his ee when he propounded the above comparative
estimate of Scottish and English brains. In the ensuing passage, con-
ceived in the same potent spirit, there is a certain haziness, moreover,
that reminds one ºthe mist, not of the sky, but of the vision, through
which the lecturer, under circumstances of moonshine, would perhaps
have been able token the horn of the moon, or rather perhaps the horns
of the moons:—,
“He did not see any advantage at all, either for practical use, or as a principle
on which the world was to be constituted, of having all men alike—of converting g
Irishmen and Scotchmen into Englishmen—that the Cockney brain, capable of only
one paltry idea, should find nothing to *:::::: its absolute despotism, or trouble
its small circle of conception out and beyond itself.”
The obscurity of the concluding sentence relative to the Cockney
brain might be º due to a drappie which had just a wee obfuscated
the ee, at any rate of the mind.
PROFEssoR BLACKIE perhaps was inadequately reported } the paper
from which, we quote him. Surely he lectured in his mother tongue
and did not bark or yelp like one of the “Englified puppies” denounce
hereinunder:—
“He did not know what the young gentlemen in Glasgow thought of themselves,
but he knew there were many in Edinburgh, who, like the editor of the Courant,
were," Englified' puppies—they had no Scottish ideas, and knew nothing of the
Scottish language; even the servant girls were now forgetting to speak Scotch.”
According to BLACKIE, Scotland has a language of her own, second
to no other of the Germanic tongues:—
“The Scotch dialect was one that had its own characteristics, its own distinctly
marked peculiarities, its own capacities, and its own beauties, as much as the
Doric language in which PINDAR wrote, as distinguished from the dialect in which
HERODOTUS wrote.”
The language in which SHAKSPEARE wrote was not that wherein he
Qught to have written at least the particular tragedy above alluded to.
Macbeth, of course, should have been composed in broad Scotch.
Could Professor BLAckr recast that work in the national mould?
It may, however, be respectfully questioned whether broad Scotch,
fine as it may be, is very much finer than broad Hampshire. The
clowns of North and South Britain may, in respect of speech, be con-
sidered to stand at opposite extremes of latitude.
The following sample of eloquence is rather in the style of a
. York stump-orator than in that of one of HER MAJESTY's
subjects:—
“He always called himself a Scot, and not an Englishman, while abroad. On the
Continent the English had such a very bad character, apart from their pride,
formality, insolence, and conceit—(he appealed to any gentleman who knew any-
thing whether that was true or not)—apart from their gross ignorance and stupidity
—he knew that they had such a bad character, and were so much hated, that he
always found that he had got the right hand of his host when he said: “I am a Scot
—a countryman of BURNS and WALTER Scott.'"
Although PROFESSOR BLACKIE says that—
“The practical tendency of his lecture was to show that they ought to encourage
oung men at school, college, and elsewhere to grow up as Scotchmen, in pride and
joy as Scotchmen—glorying with an intelligent glory as Scotchmen—"
he reduces the Scot to a level below that at which he was estimated
#|by DR. Johnson, or is classed by that special object of the Professor's
indignation, MR. BUCKLE. LoRD MonBodDo only ascribed tails, to
aboriginal Scots, in common with the rest of mankind. See, what
.* BLACKIE says of that race to which he glories in be-
onging :-
“He had found eight points in which, so far as he could discern, the peculiarity
of the animal Scotium Scotus consisted. These were-1st, the Seot was essentially
a working animal; 2nd, an enterprising and adventurous animal; 3rd, a thinking
and .. animal; 4th, a practical and utilitarian animal; 5th, a sure and a
cautious animal; 6th, he was an earnest, serious, devout, and religious animal;
7th, a fervid impassioned animal, perfervidum ingenium Scotorum F and 8th, a
humorous, amusable, and amusing animal—he was aº happy animal, and not
#. ...the grim kind of creature made of iron t’#ſºft.cº. seemed to
1Ilk.
So, after all, the Scot is an animal; a religious animal, for one thing.
ell, certainly it may be said that Calvinism was the religion of a brute.
What kind of animal is the Scot? A despicable Cockney might be
disposed to reply that, if PROFESSOR: BLACKIE is a specimen of the
breed, the Scot is an animal ordained by nature to graze on the prickly
herbage of the Land of Thistles.
OUR DEAR BROTHER JONATHAN.
THIs delightful ebullition of fervent brotherly love has most fittingly
appeared in a Philadelphia paper:—
“It may be, in view of all these grave considerations and the sad necessities of
the case, that, in order to avoid a war which could only end in our discomfiture, the
Administration may be compelled to concede the demands of England, and perhaps
release Messrs. MAson and SLIDELL. God forbid –but in a crisis like this we must
adapt ourselves to stern circumstances, and yield every feeling of pride to maintain
our existence. If this contingency should ever arise—and I am only speculating
upon a disagreeable possibility—then let us swear, not only to ourselves but our
children who come after us, to repay this greedy, insolent, and cowardly Power
with the retribution of a just and fearful vengeance. If England in our time of
distress makes herself our foe, and offers to be our assassin, we will treat her as a
foe when we can do sountrammeled and unmenaced by another enemy.”
“Greedy, insolent, and cowardly,” these are nice fraternal terms;
and what a truly loying spirit, is evinced by swearing “fearful ven-
eance” upon the “assassin,” and handing to posterity the keeping
of the oath !
No whit less affectionate in feeling is what follows:–
“If we do concede the demands of England, however, it will only be because we
desire to crush this rebellion, as a duty we owe to mankind. It will be because
we prefer to master the great evil, and do not wish to be alienated from our duty by
an international and comparatively unimportant quarrel; it will be because we
prefer national salvation to the gratification of any feeling of national pride. It
will be a great act of self-denial. But when we come from this rebellion it will be
with a magnificent army, educated and organised, and with the sense of this wrong
weighing upon them. It will be with a navy competent to meet any navy upon
the globe. It will be for us then to remember how England was our enemy in the
day of our misfortune, and to make that remembrance a dark and fearful page of
her history, and an eternal memory in our own.” -
That, these are the opinions of most people in America nobody on
this side the Atlantic will believe., But that there are roughs and
rowdies in the States, who, as they have nothing they can lose by war
are always full of bluster and warlike in their talk, this may any one in
England very easily conceive. . Of course it is to please them that such
stuff as we have quoted is stuck in Yankee newspapers; and our sºle
surprise is that the journals which admit it find it pays them so to dº;
The rowdies as a rule are not overflushed with wealth, and can ill
afford to spend their coppers upon literature, which, the chances are,
they scarcely would know how to read.
One of the Compliments of the Season.
“I’ve been turning my thoughts inwardly a great deal lately,” said
an M.P., notorious for his stupidity, to lººsal. Oslº#NE, whº in:
stantly reproved him by saying, “My dear fellow, it will never do to
gaze on vacancy in that way.”

THE TWO CASES.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I wish that you would use your influence with the daily
newspapers, and ask them not to go on printing those awfully long re-
ports of the Two Trials. Day after day come in parallel (is that the
right word?) columns, reports upon reports of the disagreeable nonsense,
until one is perfectly confused and bewildered; and when I send away
my paper, I really do not know whether MR. WINDHAM is trying to
rove that the Bishop of SALISBURY is cracked, or the REveREND
owland WILLIAMs wants to lock up SIR Hugh CAIRNs, or MR.
SAMUEL WARREN is not fit to have the spending of Ten Thousand
a Year. I don’t want to know anything about either case; but when
they both come together, it is downright aggravating. I subjoin the
report of the united case as it is at present pestering my memory, and
beg that you will exert yourself to stop what is really dazing me dizzy.
“Yours most affectionately,

“THE WINDHAM-WILLIAMS CASE.
“TIIIs is the Qffice of the Master into which people will keep coming
and, promoting, him to be something else, if he will come out of the
Arches under Waterloo Bridge and speak to the Bishop of SALISBURY
about driving railway-engines through the thirty-nine Articles. The
case is very objectionable, and MR. WILLIAMs is not WILLIAMs of
Kars, though GENERAL WINDHAM fought with the Russians. So long
as a clergyman takes the money of the Church, he has no business to
black his face and sing Old Bob Ridley, and neither RIDI.EY nor LATI-
MER would approve his conduct, but would refer him to BURNET. Also
he ought not to laugh in a foolish manner, like a natural, which is
F. in a non-natural sense, and if he goes to a Review, whether
russian,or not, he ought to respect the bishop's Charges. The Council
of Nice had nothing to do with it any more than Louis NAPOLEoN, in
fact there is nothing nice in the business, and there is no proof that if
he was an Eton boy he was a drunken man. Anybody may eat eggs,
and if he eats nineteen, the Church does not object to fast-days, and
St. CYPRIAN lays down no rules as to the company he is to keep,
but LLEwellyN is a Welsh name and so is WILLIAMs, though MR.
FitzJAMEs may not be the knight of Snowdon. There is nothing in
the Articles to prevent a clergyman giving thirty-nine articles of
jewellery to his wife, if he can pay for them, though it might be held
evidence of not having his brain set clear, and Lord CLAUDE HAMILTON
was quite right in telling him to ; to bed, and might as well set the
example the next time he himself is tempted to speak in the House.
There is no proof that DR. WILLIAMs ever rode in the guard's van,
though he is in the van of theological reformers, and, if he likes the
Aſrican serenaders, was not St. ORIGEN born in Africa? As for the Kirkof
Scotland, that had nothing to do with it, and if he bought cigars at
KIRK's they were very good ones, and it is not excess to smoke a dozen
a day if he takes plenty of exercise and the beadle does not smell
tobacco, but he ought not to shout and send Valentines, though St.
VALENTINE is in the Anglican list of saints. On the whole, therefore
DR. LushingtoN ought to declare GENERAL WINDHAM duly elected
and SIR GEORGE ARMYTAGE ought to depose the Bishop of SALISBURY
and everybody pay his own costs, with liberty to speak to the prosecutor
and turn it into a special verdict without prejudice to the Asylum for
Idiots or the Court of Arches.”

THE EMPEROR, who had been thought to have designs of fighting
Switzerland, is said to have used on New Year's Day some particularly
civil and re-assuring words to the Swiss representative, #. KERN.
They might have been re-assuring, but we are blest if they were very
civil. His Majesty, who is a great Shakespearian, simply smiled, and
quoted Macduff—
“I cannot strike at wretched KERNEs.”

SALISBURY AND JEROBOAM.
Our excellent friend, MR. Roebuck, has been getting into strange
company. He, John ARTHUR, the Radical, cat ;...&#. (as MR. Cox
means to say when he has learned Greek) has been delivering an address
at Salisbury on popular education, and has given it in the presence of
divers clergy, and among them the Bishop of SALISBURY, avenger of
the Church upon the Essays and Reviews, Mr. Punch has nothing
particular to say about the address º except it was sensible
and practical. We leave him to settle with the men in the north the
question of the accuracy of the following sketch of the life of a skilled
mechanic there:—
“How is the life of a man in the north passed who earns wages of a high cha-
racter? He gets up in the morning and goes to work. He comes home, and the
first thing he usually does is to swear at his wife. Perhaps he beats his children,
and thcn he caresses his dog. His whole life is ed in mere sensual enjoyments
—getting drunk is his chief business in life, and when he has got drunk, his next
business is to get sober. Now that is that man's life, and I ask you to compare that
life with the life of an educated man."
Let us hear what the men of the north say to that. If it be false it
should be contradicted; and, if true, the northerners ought to be very
much ashamed of themselves. But what Mr. Punch, does want to
advert to is this. , MR. Roebuck was insisting upon the necessity of
teaching the children of the poor in a practical manner, of calling their
attention to the productions of nature, and the things around them,
instead of cramming their heads with ancient history, and dates, and
all that sort of scholarship. And he said:—
“It is the habit of very well-intended people to go into a school and say, ‘Well,
what shall we teach these children? We will teach them the events of past ages."
Pretty nearly the first thing they ºy is, “Don't you think this child John BRown
should learn who were the Kings of Israel and Judaea?” By dint of driving hard,
they teach the child the order in which Jeroboam comes, and who succeeded him;
but what earthly good is it to him?"
He then told a story of a friend of DR. ARNOTT, who—
“Felt it his business to exercise the mind of the children, and one morning he
called all the boys and girls together, and said, “I want every one of you to o a
slate, and on Monday morning to bring me an account of all the four-legged animals
on the farm.” On Saturday my friend walked through the village, and saw the
little fellows sitting before the door, with their eyes cocked up, and thinking of
cows, horses, and sheep; and not only that, but it spread through the household,
and all the fathers and mothers in the village were up in arms, wondering how
many four-legged things there were on the farm. (Laughter.) A prize was given
to the cleverest boy, who gave the greatest number. Now that is exactly what the
people now-a-days don't do. They talk of Jeroboam or Jehoshaphat, but who cares
about Jehoshaphator Jeroboam f (Laughter.) They have not only long passed away,
but they have eft no trace of their existence behind. To tell me how many four-
legged animals there are on the farm is a thing all can understand, and will go
clearly to exercise tho mind of the children.”
The Bishop or SALISBURY followed MR. Roebuck, complimented
him for his “truthfulness,” and thanked him heartily.
jo you hear that, Dr. Rowland WILLIAMs? Do you hear that;
Record? Do you hear that, Christian Observer, new series?, This model
bishop, who is firing into an unfortunate parson whº cannot, help him-
self, actually sat still and heard Jeroboam and Jehoshaphat spoken
slighting of by a Member of Parliament? Why didn’t the bishop
stand up #. Jeroboam, before the ARCHDEACQN. HöNEy, as he does,#.
ir. Phill.IMoRE, before DR. LushingtoN ?, When the jº laußed
at Jeroboam, why did not the '...}. it’em, hot and hot. , “V ho
cares about jeroboam?” said MR. Roebuck, Was it not the bishop's
business to jump up and protest against the son of Nebat being
spoken of in that manner, as if he were only a CANUTE or an AIFRED?
hat is right before the Court of Arches is right in the Salisbu
Assembly Rooms, and vice versä, and we shall feel much less satisfie
with the Record than we like to be, if it does not call upon the bishop
for an explanation. No wonder that after such courtesy MR. Roebuck
said:–
“There was a dash, I thought, in your lordship's speech which implied I had
wished to convey something like censure upon a bºdy I very much honour—namely,
the reverend class to which he belongs. I think this country is deeply indebted to
the Church of England for her attempt to educate the people. I am well known—-
and nobody knows it better than your lordship—to be what is called a Radical; but
stilii have that feeling in my own mind which induces me to admire and heartily
thank those reverend gentlemen who have striven in the t cause which I have
humbly advocated to-night (Cheers.) I beg your lordship to believ; that there is no
body of men for whom I have a more hearty and, a more, complete respect and
admiration than the class to which your lordship belongs.” (Cheers.)
All very fine, but what the bishop ought to have gone in for was
justice to Jeroboam.

The EMPERoR or Russia had better mind what he is about in admitting Monsignor CHIGH

SLIGHT ON A SOWEREIGN PEOPLE.
OUR ally the EMPEROR or THE FRENch—he has deserved that name-will probably come
in for some of that vituperation on the part of the Yankee Press, of which the lion's shar;
has hitherto fallen to the British Lion. What abuse will the newspapers of the United
States not heap upon the head of his IMPERIAL MAJESTY in commenting on the circum-
stances thus recorded in the Post/–
“It appears that MR. Dayton, the American Minister at Paris, sent in a list of some twenty, to thirty
American citizens for presentation at the Tuileries on New Year's Day. The representative of the United
Affairs, requesting to know what
states thereupon received a note from M. Thouvenet, Minister of Forei
was the rank and social position of the gentlemen and ladies who desired the honour of being presented
to their Imperial Majesties."
. Such a question might be excused on the supposition that it proceeded from invincible
ignorance. Their Imperial Majesties and M. Thouvex EL may be conceived not to have
known that every American citizen is the freeman of a Sovereign State, and thus a member
of a Royal family, indeed a Sovereign in his own person; consequently the equal. of any
crowned head in Europe. This information might have been imparted to the minister in
answer to his unnecessary question. But, continues the writer above quoted:—
“I believe I am correctin saying that Mr. Dayton simply replied that the persons for Yºº C
he had applied were ladies and gentlemen who would be received by the President of the Uni States. It
resulted t-no-Americans were presented at all at the reception in question. I believe that the presence
at Court of some persons of American origin scarcely presentable in any society, was the cause of
M. Thouvenel's note to Mr. Dayton.”
The effect of this intelligence on the American, public will be that of profound sensation.
The organs of popular opinion willfuriously declare that France must be whipped. They
will threaten her with sending a spare million of men to invade and overrun, Algeria, and
another million to sack Paris and raze, the exclusive Tuileries. They will menace the
everlasting blockade of French ports with sunken ships, laden with, granite. As if ºvery
American citizen were not presentable, in any sºciety!, Jerusalem! The screams of the
insulted Bird of Freedom will probably be terrific, and we shall see how much they will
frighten the French Eagle.

LENITY PROPERLY REBUKED.
ATELEGRAM from Naples states that the Bri-
gand Chief, Chiavone,
“Has been deprived by the Bourbon-Committee, a
Rome of the command of the brigands, for having dis-
obeyed instructions by shooting prisoners."
Telegrams, are, usually incomplete, but we
understand that this merciful manner of murder-
ing the prisoners has given great offence at the
Vatican, and that the successor to CHIAvone
has imperative instructions either to burn his
captives, or to put them to death gradually, in the
hinese fashion. As the Pope justly remarks,
“ these are not times for sentimental mercy to
the enemies of the Church.”
Mind, it's Between Hugh and Me.
SIR. H. CAIRNs was asked whether he thought

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INSANITY IN THE FEDERAL CAMP.
EALLY we have at
last discovered some
reason for admitting
that there may, per-
*: be something
inhomoeopathy. The
Special Correspond-
ent of the Times
thus writes from
Washington:—
“GENERAL M'CLEL-
LAN is slowly recover-
ing from an attack of
fever of a mild typhoid
type, which has been
treated homoeopathic-
ally, and was probably
much exasperated in
consequence. GENERAL
MARcy, his father-in-
law, and chief of his
staff, has also been
undergoing homoeo-
pathy and an attack of
some other illness, from
which he is getting
better, but neither is fit at present to direct operations."
So we should think. Anybody capable of submitting himself to
homoeopathic treatment must be far too weak to direct military opera-
tions, or do anything else the performance of which requires strength
of mind. If GENERAL MCLELLAN, and GENERAL MARcy have been
"undergoing homºeopathy,” they will never be strong enough for their
situations. It will be all gone goose with the Federal cause unless such
geese as they must be are sent about their business; which might, be
that of carrying placards for BARNUM instead of hoisting the star-
spangled banner. - -
What, then, do we discern in the statement above quoted to warrant
the admission that there is anything but *: in the homoeopathic
system? Why, MR. Russeii, suggests that M'CLELLAN’s fever was
aggravated by homoeopathic treatment...That treatment, we presume,
consisted in the administration of infinitesimal globules. That these
lobules are capable of making a patient worse, is the º of MR.
Ussell. If they are, then they can produce some kind of effect;
whereas we always believed that they could have none whatever. We
still think it most likely that homoeopathy allowed the fever of YoUNG
NApoleon to run its course. If, however, homoeopathic doses º do
exert the action which they are supposed by . RUSSELL to have
exerted in the case of GENERAL M'Ciel LAN, he has good reason for
calling homoeopathy a disease, that is to say, a cause of disease, as, he
does when he says that GENERAL MARcy had been º: that
and some other illness. The other illness we conceive to have been
mental derangement.
EXPOSING A LAZY MINISTER.
MR. PUNCH, who likes to see people grateful (a liking not often in-
dulged in this objectionable world), received from EARL, (late LoRP
John) RussELI, a letter which was so nicely and properly expressed,
that Mr. Punch perused it with satisfaction, and had almost made
up his mind to ask JoHN to dinner. But, looking into the Daily Tele-
graph, he perceives that the Earl has been using the letter again, in
writing to Halifax, or some such place, about some address or other,
and this is a liberty which Mr. Punch has no idea of º, to pass
unreproved. He will therefore not ask John to dinner, and he prints
the epistle in order to prevent its being used any more:-
“SIR, “Foreign Office, Jan. 19, 1862.
“I have to acknowledge the receipt of your number of the isth instant,
expressing your cordial approval of the prompt and energetic measures taken by
HER MAJESTY's Government *P. the honour of the British flag. It is a great
satisfaction to my colleagues and to myself to receive so flattering an expression of
approval of the course which we have felt it our duty to take on this occasion; and
I you to have the goodness to return our thanks to all your contributors, and to
assure them, how highly HER MAJEsty's Government appreciate the generous
support which they have tendered to them at the present crisis.

WENGEANCE AND REPUDIATION.
“England cannot afford to § to war with us, for the conflict, sooner or later,

American stock is owned by British subjects, which in the event of hostilities,
would be confiscated; and we now call upon the companies not to take it off their
hands upon any terms. Let its forfeiture be held over land as a weapon in
terroren. British subjects have $200,000,000 or $300,000,000 invested in shipping

We are authorised to, contradict the rumour, that MR.GLUGG, of
Shoreditch, has met with a serious accident. He merely fellower the
door-mat and dislocated his spectacles. -
.The difficulties which arose between M.R. and MRs. CHINASTER, of Pop-
ins Court, originating, we understand, in the residence of the Dowager
Rs. CHINASTER in the house of her son, have been removed by the
temporary removal of the latter lady to Brixton, at the suggestion of
MR. ARNOLD.
MR. MUNKEY has refused the part of Jack Gizzard in the new farce,
The Bladder of Lard.
There is no truth in the statement that the worthy and estimable
beadle of .."; has applied to be knighted at the opening of the
International Exhibition, though there is no doubt that the conferring
such a distinction upon him would much gratify the inhabitants of that
elegant district.
A project is on foot for presenting a testimonial to M. BLONDIN, on
the part of the visitors to the Crystal Palace, in proof of their admira-
tion of his noble conduct in not tumbling off the rope and breaking his
neck, as an inferior artist might have done.
HERR. Won JoEL has finally declined the crown of the Southern
States of America.
In pulling down an old wash-house in the garden of MR. SMITH, of
Islington, the workmen discovered the remains of an a decayed waist-
coat, marked W. C. It is supposed to have belonged to WILLIAM THE
CoNQUEROR. - -
An ingenious American mechanic has just invented a machine for
enabling a man, to wash, shave, and dress himself, say a hymn, brus
his hat, snub his wife, and air his newspaper, without waking him-
self, and it will call him, at any given hour, so that the first thing he
will doin the morning will be to find himself at his breakfast table.
The liberal and kind-hearted proprietor of the Punch that exhibits in
Stratford Place has intimated to the Blue Coat Boys, that during the
holiday month they may stand upon the kerb-stone and look at the
entertainment for nothing. - - - -
By the recent census it appears that the majority of the inhabitants
of % pleby-in-the-Mire, Dorsetshire, are Idiots. There, was reason
for believing this, some years ago, when they petitioned Parliament to
prevent eclipses. . . -
A wealthy inhabitant of Kensington has offered a prize of £5 for the
worst poem upon the Great Exhibition of 1862. Betting is strongly in
favour of the author of Proverbial Philosophy, but the author of the
Victories of Love has many friends—on this occasion.
A new comedy, by the writer of As Fresh as Paint, has been read.
Green Room report states that it is worse than his last piece, but this
we believe to be impossible.
As MR. BUMBLE, the respected landlord of the Cucumber's Arms,
Wapping, was crossing the street near his own residence the other
night, he was run up against by a fiend in human form and knocked
into the gutter. The police are upon the traces of the miscreant, but
that such a thing could happen is a comment upon the boasted civi-

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
v -. * > SECOND hearing, my dear
/* (º v- Punch, has not raised my
ſº- opinion of MR. BALFE's
ſº new Opera. That it con-
" . tains much R. music
I still readily admit; but
that, as, has been state
it is really his best work,
am now by no means quite
so, ready to allow. , The
ballads are charm-
ing, and most admirably
suited to the voices they
were written for; nor are
the concerted parts less
cleverly composed, or
adapted with less taste to
the atic situations;
while on the whole the
work is instrumented far
more skilfully than is com-
mon with composers of the
English school. What, then,
is amiss? Well, it is diffi.
cult to say; but there can
scarcely be that freshness
in the music I first fancied,
or I surely should have
more enjoyed a second
hearing." ...A really good
work is relished more, the
more one knows it; the
fulness of its º, is
rarely learnt at first. Who
ever tires of hearing Guillaume Tell, or Don Giovanni? and without com-
aring BALFE to MozART or RossINI, his music may be not unfairly
judged by the same test. Moreover, his new opera, in certain of the scenes
is rather noisy than melodious; and though the accompaniments are
skilful and elaborate, there is at times a rather WERDI-like prepon-
derance of brass. Still, there is no doubt that the work, if it do not
much e ce, will in no degree diminish his justly high repute; and
as little question is there it finds favour with the public, or it would
not have been played, as it has been, for upwards of six weeks.
“Well as it may seem to pay, I question, if this plan of running a
new opera without change or cessation, while its novelty it...i.
not hurtful in the end to the pockets of a manager, as well as most
injurious to singers and to art. To sing nightly the same music for
upwards of a month becomes a strain upon the patienge as well as on
the strength ; and instead of singers growing perfect . such practice,
they are tempted to get careless, and to *i; though their singing
were a mere work of routine #ven Jºnny IND could scarcely throw
her soul into a song, were she for weeks restrained to singing that and
nothing else; and besides the bad effect which the monotony produces,
there is in the case of the Royal English Opera the no less, evil conse.
quence of vocal overwork. How Miss PyME has contrived to sing six
nights a week, and retain still all the brilliancy and sweetness of her
voice, is a marvel that provokes my admiration and my wonder, and
makes me view her as th. GRISI of the English stage. But for her
sake, and for Art’s sake, I wish she were relieved from so much wearing
Qyer-labour, which can hardly fail, to terminate in premature decay.
Miss PyNE's delicious voice is of far too high a value thus to be im-
perilled; and I for one protest against her so destructively and lavishly
employing it. Its riches rightly hoarded, ought twenty years tº come
19 give a †: to the public; but if she squanders then, half that
time will hardly pass ere we may be lamenting the treasure we have lost.
“It is my fervent wish that English opera may flourish in the hands
that now support it, which makes me anxious that such faults as I have
noticed be removed. harsh word now and then is in reality a kind
one; for without it blots and blemishes wouldſº escape correc-
tion, which becomes an easy matter when the faults are pointed out.
“Of the pantºmime at this house I shall say more in my next. For
the present it suffices to remark that MR. PAYNE, the prince of panto.
mimists, enacts the part of Gulliver in a way that adds new lustre to
DEAN Swift's immortal traveller; and after escaping from a Brob-
dinguag big lobster, reviews the volunteers of Lilliput, and lets them
march between his legs... I must add too, that if people who like trans-
formation scenes allow the Covent Garden one to pass without their

of a lunacy, commission, issued for the purpose of deciding on their
madness and devouring their estates. -

BREAKING A LIMB OF THE LAW.
In the Court of Queen's Bench, the other day, MR.
GIBBONs—
“Moved for a rule, calling upon an attorney of that Court to
answer certain matters con ed in an affidavit. The attorney had
received £25 in an action. Repeated applications had been made
to him for the payment of the money to the applicant without effect,
the attorney stating that he had spent the money and could not
do it. (Laughter)."
We see, nothing to laugh at, and we hope that nothing
harsh will be done to this attorney. It may be alittle irre-
gular to take one's client's money, and spendit oneself, but
this is a mere error in practice, and when handsomely and
frankly admitted, as by this “gent,” anything like severity
is uncalled for. What more can the poor man say? If he
has not got the money he can't pay it. Would the Court
force him to rob, some other client in order to pay the
complainant?...When a gentleman explains, and says he is
sorry, an affair is over, and why, not have the same
courtly rule in case of a gent instead of applying for a rule
of Court. We consider that SIR ALEXANDER Cogg BURN
should give GIBRONs, or his, instructors, a good blowing
up for being so ill-conditioned.

was just the man for the Interior, more especially, if the
BUFFET in question happened to be at all we stored. How
the hungry, the tired, the poor, would always be rushing
up to him for relief! What levees he would hold—what
crowds of admirers would be continually hanging round
him to partake of the good things he would be able to
lay before them! Never would the Interior have been so
well filled, before!, Properly speaking, and adapting the
means to the end, this BUFFET should have served under a

A BIOGRAPHY FOR PROFESSOR BLACKIE,
THE attention of our friend, PROFEssoR BLACKIE, is invited to the
subjoined extracts from a little memoir in the Falkirk Herald of John
ANDREW, a Carron workman, who has just died at the age of 78:—
“A THoRough Scotch MAN.—Last week, John ANDREw, a Carron workman, died
He was a remarkable specimen of a hard-working, frugal
living, canny Scotchman.”
By dint of thrift and industry, JoHN ANDREw, in the course of his
life, contrived to amass about £10,000. His biographer says that:—
“His habits of living were unusually moderate, . He was never known to spend
a single farthing on luxuries, preferring to everything-
“The halesome parritch
Wale o'Scotia's food,'
and such primitive fare, and it was deficient neither in bone-forming, flesh-forming,
nor health-giving qualities.”
It is to be feared that the contributors to the Falkirk Herald include
at least one of those degenerate, Scots denounced by. PROFEssoR
flººr for adopting English ideas; for in continuation we read
at :-
“It was said, however, that his frugality extended to niggardliness.”
No, no, not at all likely. Such an imputation may º have
been whispered; but upon what ground? The fact undermentioned
is obviously insufficient to warrant it:—
“It is stated also, on excellent authority, that about eight years ago, when his wife
died, he asked permission of his employers to attend her funeral, and although at
that time worth about £6,000, he actually returned to work immediately after
having paid the last respects to the remains of his partner in life.”
John NIE ANDREw returned to his work immediately after his wife's
funeral. What of that ? º he had not returned to his work till
that day week. That would have been thought nothing of-but what
is a man who forgets a wife that was worth remembering in a week, or
who forgets her as long as he lives? One man's grief is controlled by
his will, but lasts his lifetime; that of another is ungovernable at first,
but wears out in time, often much sooner than his mourning dress,
sometimes in less than a week. The former, mastering his grief, goes
to work at once. The latter lets his grief master him—and exhaust
itself: then, or in two or three days afterwards, he goes to work too.
Which has the stronger affection for his wife? Work is the only refuge
for a great grief. As such a refuge let us suppose that it was sought
by John NIE ANDREw; not for a moment will we entertain the suppo-
sition implied in what follows:–
“The gentleman in charge of the department hunted him home.
His anxiety to
pursue his daily avocation was in order to secure the full day's pay."
We cannot think that MR. ANDREw thought more of the loss of a
day’s wages than he did of the loss of his wife; but if he valued his
wife less than his wages, then the question occurs, How much was his
wife worth There are widowers who retire from their wives' funeral
to smoke a very comfortable pipe, instead of going to work. Into, this
question, however, we cannot go in the present instance, and nobody
but a paltry Cockney will think it is at all affected by the statement
ensuing :-
“It is further said that despite his wealth he once craved one of his relations for
a halfpenny which was owing to him, so scrupulously exact was he in his monetary
transactions. When buying herrings he used to weigh one in each hand so that he
might buy the heaviest one.”
“Order is Heaven's first law,” and that law was but conscientiously
obeyed in the exactness of ANDREw. The annexed anecdote respecting
him, superficially considered, may indeed, rather seem to favour the
hypothesis which ascribes his conduct to simple avarice:-
“About 20 years ago he chanced to take ill, and, as he seriously thought he was
dying, bethought himself how matters stood in reference to futurity. Evidently
wishing to atone for his earthly deficiencies, he made a handsome donation
(somewhere about £250) to the Rev. MR. Welch, late of the West United Presby-
terian Church, for the purpose of establishing a native teacher in Caffraria. Regain-
ing health, he demanded back the sum."
But let us look below the surface in estimating the motives of MR.
John ANDREw’s conduct in this matter. We shall then not make the
mistake of comparing his behaviour with that of the celebrated person-
age who, according to the proverbial distich, when he was sufferin
from illness proposed to take the vows of poverty, chastity, an
obedience, but, as soon as he recovered, abandoned his pious intentions,
and was no monk. ... No, no. When JóHN ANDREW was sick, he made
the Church a donation, under the perverted idea of º his soul by
works; but when JóHN ANDREw got well, his sound, orthodoxy
returned together with his health; and he likewise demanded the return
of his money. He repented of his fallacious repentance, and got back
again to the good old Calvinistic doctrine of faith. In short, John NIE
ANDREw was a Scot, and a Scot, as PROFEssoR BLACKIE says, is a
religious animal.

We’ve plenty of work and must do it,
And somehow contrive to get through it,
To hold a position in our Exhibition
Since we have asked all nations to it.

We now must devote our attention,
And the Thames's embankment, 'mongst wonders to rank meant,
A scheme of such vast comprehension!

Will use for its drink and its brewage,
'Twill run no more muddy; and then we’ve to study

With plenty will crown all our acres;

To be of its produce partakers.

Of speech it º vanquish its labours;

less proudly than ourselves the bad opinion of the Morning Star:-

We long to read the º abusive article that is almost sure to
appear in our Yankee friend, the Star, yehemently denouncing, the
}. for profanely recommending, as indicated above, the Gazette {
Bankruptcy for “Sunday Reading”—more especially as there is suc
a charning paper published on that same day as the Dial. Please, be
particular in asking for the Sunday edition of that paper. Moreover,
we confess we agree for once with our invaluable denunciator, the Star,
in doubting whether the Gazette of Bankruptcy is the best style o
reading for Sunday, or indeed for *} other day, inasmuch as such a
publication must necessarily consist of nothing but column after column
of “broken English.”

GOVERNESSES FOR THE IMBECILE.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“FROM fifteen to twenty thousand pounds, wasted in trying
whether a young man is in his senses or out of his mind! What a
wicked waste! If it is the Law's fault, I am sure the Law is the
worst lunatic in the case. Either the Law must be very stupid, or the
judge a great F, or the lawyers a set of shocking R's, to plunder a
poor fellow between them of £20,000. If he is not able to manage his
own affairs, are they fit to manage them for him?
“How silly to take so much trouble to find out whether a man is lead
insane, or, no in order to decide as to his fitness for managing his
affairs! As if nobody was unfit to º his own affairs but a down-
right lunatic: , Every wild young man almost is unfit to m e his
irs, and if he has a fortune, ought to be prevented from throwing it
away. Not that he should be shut up, and prevented from going about
under certain restrictions, but #. people should be appointed to
take care of his estates, lay out his money for him on reasonable things
and allow him so much a week. He should be made incapable o
º into debt or of marrying without the consent of his guardians.
“With the consent of his rdians, however, a wild young man
unable to manage his own affairs should not only be allowe , but also
encouraged and persuaded, and even urged to enter into matrimony,
having a suitable match provided for him, and then he would be .#
to make a métalliance. Many sensible girls, would be glad of such a
#. who might be more agreeable personally than one more steadily
isposed, and being kept from breaking out would make her very happy.
Even if a little weak of intellect he might prove a very good husband,
as his wife could have her own way with him, and the care of any
helpless object is a J.; duty to our tender and affectionate
natures. A weak-minded man appears to be intended by Nature for
the mate of a strong-minded woman.
“On marriage, of course, the management of the incapable youn
man's property should be transferred tº his wife, supposing her equ
to the task, and to have no Mamma living. Qtherwise to whom co
the care of his estates, be better entrusted than to the Mamma? A
double arrangement might be made, making the Mamma Committee of
the Estate—don't the lawyers call it?—and the Wife Committee of
the Person. So one would save him from squandering his property,
and the other would keep him from *::: into mischief.
“I have seven of them, Mr. Punch—marriageable daughters I mean,
and not sons of large property and weak intellect. . Happy, indeed,
should I be to have seven sons-in-law of that description under the
circumstances above-mentioned!, Qne such, indeed, would be a treasure
that I should embrace with thankfulness as an ample provision for my
eldest, whilst his superfluous means, with my management, would be a
f. help for the rest. A husband of that sort who would keep regular
ours and dine early, and go to bed betimes, except when his wife had
an evening party, and give no trouble, and do what he was told, would

QUACK AGAINST QUACK.
UBJoned, with a
change of names only,
is part of one para-
graph and part of
another, which two
p aphs actually
stand side by side in
the columns of a con-
temporary. This is
part of one:-
“Why should invalids
and persons suffering
from gastric disorders
waste their money and
utterly destroy their
health by taking pills and
other medicines? These,

cious Health Restoring Polenta Syriaca Food, which saves fifty times its cost in physic, cod-liver
oil, and all other remedies.”
This is part of the other:-

The above extracts are taken from the news, and not from the advertising columns
of the journal which contains them. No heading declares them to be advertisements,
and doubtless many old women and fools who read them suppose them to be
editorial statements, as fools and old women were probably meant to do...by the
quacks who procured their insertion. But the veriest fool not quite an idiot, and
the simplest old woman not absolutely in her dotage, will be puzzled by the answer
which the second constitutes to the question of the first. The question implies the
assertion that people ruin their health and waste their money by taking pills instead
of Du BuNgoº's Polenta Syriaca Food. The answer to it declares that Gul-
Loway's pills excel every other medicine. The weakest mind must see, the con-
trariety of clashing statements thus lying, in every sense of the word lying, close
together. Every quack who puts a paragraph into a paper should stipulate for the
insertion of his own puff at areasonable distance from any other which gives it, the
lie direct. Old women, and others who have read the foregoing contradictory
specimens of puffery, will be as much puzzled as wiser persons are § the opposite
tenets of numerous gentlemen who sign the Thirty-nine Articles, and yet unite in
condemning DR. Rowland WILLIAMs.
HELMETS FOR PEACE HEROES.
It is of great importance to the º and of some to the police, that policemen
should have their heads protected in the execution of their duty. The present
police-hat answers this purpose in a measure, if the ruffian who is resisting capture,
will be so considerate as to keep hitting his adversary on the crown of it, instead of
first knocking it off, and then beating iim on the head ; but the latter course is
usually adopted. -
The hat now worn by the police is very thick, heavy, and hot. It has been
likened to a chimney-pot, because of its shape, and it further resembles a smoking
flue in the temperature of its interior.
Considering these disadvantages of the existing police-hat, a certain MR. CHILDs,
according to a city paper, has recommended as a substitute for it a kind of helmet,
being a modification of the Greek galea, without the plume, so as not to look too
warlike for an officer whose duty consists in keeping the peace. This headpiece,
however, possesses one quality of the Fº namely, the lightness of a feather,
which is combined with the strength of an arch. It also unites, ventilation with
elegance, and protects the eyes, neck, and ears. Lastly, it is described as in keeping
with the wearer's dress, which it will be, perhaps, when the boots and coats of the
police-force are exchanged for tunics and greaves.
We trust that the authorities will adopt the classical improvement suggested as
a. #. for the heads of ayaluable body of men. No skull can be proof against
a life-preserver, or, rather, a life-destroyer, but one which is much thicker than that
of an intelligent officer ought to be.
Ab Ovo Usque ad Bonum.
Among the persons who, following Mr. Punch's example, have sent appropriate
presents to GARIBALDI, is a gentleman of a piscivorous character, who has for-
warded to the Italian fiberator a great quantity of Salmon's Eggs. We accept
the omen. May it imply that he will soon occupy the Chair of the Fisherman.

NASAL INTELLIGENCE.
Mong other festive novel-
ties, (for however sad a
Christmas, may nationally
be, the advertisements are
sure to say the season is a
festive one) we see an-
nounced that any purchaser
of New Year's Gifts, at, a
named spent shop will be
presented with a “perfumed
iece of original music.”
t is certainly not new to
hear a song called “a sweet
thing,” and equally well
used are we to hear a song-
stress spoken of as having
a “sweet voice.” But in
future when we find these
epithets applied, we shall
fancy they bear reference
rather to a nasal than a
vocal point of excellence,
and that a piece is called a
sweet one because it is per-
fumed with some delicious
nt.
To make the novelty more
popular, we would º that it were well if songs and other com-
ositions were scented with an odour §§ to their subject, as
ar as that might be. Thus, the air of “Cherry ſtip." might be per-
fumed with the smell of that delicious fruit, and “Rose, Thou art the
Fairest Flower,” should be scented with fresh rose-water, to attract
thereby the noses of the ballad-buying world. Milleſleurs would per-
haps be the perfume most appropriate to “I know a Bank,” whereon
the wild thyme and the oxlip, and a score of other wildflowers
are understood to grow; but the scents which are expressed from a
lily and a daffodil would be fittest for “Fair Daffodils” and “Iſe Lilies
Chaste,” while MR. BALPE's new song of "Pretty Lowly, Modest
Flower,” should of course be nicely scented with forget-me-not, if it.be
discovered that forget-me-nots have scent. Drinking songs we think
might be perfumed É. the grape: except when some more potent drink
than wine is spoken of, as for instance MR. HARRISON's new song in
}. of punch, which a mixed scent to resemble the fumes of that
amed beverage should be invented to perfume. . Of course the air of
“Drops of Brandy” should smellstrongly of eau-de-vie; while HANDEL's
“Water Music,” if scented with a sprinkling of Bouquet de la Tamise,
would scarcely, one would fear, be much enhanced in either its sweet-
ness or attractiveness.
If our hint be carried out, a ballad may be made as good as abouquet,
with the additional advantage of being far more durable. Besides, if
pieces be perſumed with the due sense of what is proper, only think
what time and trouble may be saved when people go to purchase some
new music; which now they either must hum over, or strum on the
#. if they have any wish to know what it is like. Selection will
however become an easy matter, when music is perfumed according to

QUR scholarly friend, the Revue du Samedi, has devoted an elaborate
article to prove that the North and South folks of America use very
awkward distinctive names. It does not like “Federal,” it does not
like “Confederate,” it does not like anything. Its arguments are un-
impeachable, but its exertions are superfluous; The South has long
since j". with an honest joy and delight, the name affixed to it by
Mr. Punch, namely, SLAveownIA; and the North is about to take his
other suggestion, and call itself BENNETT's LAND. Messrs. STANFORD
and WYLDE are preparing maps with the new nomenclature.
LORD PUNCH TO LORD RUSSELL, GREETING.
BRAvo! LoRD RussELL! Punch pats you on the back with mingled
pride and admiration. Admiration of your language anent the Trent
affair, and pride that he, Punch, was the one who taught you to write
letters. Excellently well has your Lordship profited § the instruction
which has been vouchsafed you gratis in these columns. Notably, some
years since, when you wrote your Durham letter, Punch felt it was his
duty to tender you adyice in the epistolary art; and your late despatches
and letters to LoRD Lyons prove fully how you laid to heart the pre-
cious hints you, then received. Your style is now perspicuous, clear,
simple, and straightforward. There is no beating about the bush in
the plain English you write. . What you have to say you say without
leaving a loophole of escape from what you mean. You clearly state
your case, and name your terms for satisfaction of the injury received.
You, plumply call a spade a spade; and leave no shadow of a chance to
bandy words about it. ... You ask for justice simply, without bluster or
bombast; and speak with not more plainness than you do politeness.
There is but one sarcastic sentence in all that you have written, and it
deserves to be embalmed, for the pleasure of posterity, in the amber-type
of Punch:-
‘. . stated to MR. ADAMs the substance of M. Thouves EL's despatch to M. MERCIER
as I had heard it from M. de Flanault.
‘..MR. ADAMs said that, the French Government had always been very consistent
in their maintenance of the rights of neutrals. He added that he could not pay our
Government the same compliment.
“I said I would dispense with compliments, if this matter could be amicably
arranged."
Very neat, your, Lordship. Even your tutor, Punch, could scarce
have better worded it. You, the nobleman, are pleased to say you can
“dispense with compliments,” coming as they would from a ſess lordly
quarter, and simply want compliance with your just demand. Very
right and proper, and very neatly put. When a blackguard prigs one's
handkerchief one can “dispense with compliments,” and is merely
anxious to get back what one has lost. There are, however, compli.
ments which no one can dispense with; and these are the compliments
bestowed on men of worth and merit like your Lordship, by your Lord-
ship's very faithful friend and tutor,
49WANC#.
AN UNBENDING REED.
MR. PUNCH begs to congratulate MR. CHARLEs READE, author of
Never too Late to Mend, upon having illustrated the title of his book by
yanquishing the people who mutilated it for the stage. It is never too
late to mend bad manners, and he has obtained, after a gallant struggle,
a legal recommendation to theatrical hacks to mend theirs. A certain
class of *ś has hitherto deemed it quite lawful to pounce upon
the work—finished or unfinished—of any novelist, to strip away any
artistic clothing in which the writer may have draped his characters, and
to send them on the stage, either nude or in tawdry stage garments,
to say, do, and mean anything but the sayings, doings, and meanings of
their creator. Some dramatic gentlemen have kindly finished the
story for the writer before he has had time to do so for himself; others
have only rejected his finale, and stuck on a new one more likely to be
pleasing to the gallery. And such is the lovely state of the law that the
more outrageous the violence done to the author, the less chance he has
of obtaining reparation, Too much money is made by plundering and
mangling i. books of the living and the dead to make it probable that
the practice will be abandoned; but MR. READE has done much
towards asserting an author's right to some little consideration in the
business, and Mr. Punch rewards him with the following elegant com-
liment, namely, that in this case MR. READE's defeated adversary
É. named CoNQUEST, MR. READE is what Lord ChEstERFIELD was
told by DR. Johnson that the latter had hoped to be, namely, Le
vainqueur du vainqueur.

THE I. O. U. INDIAN.
A VERY interesting paper was read before the Ethnological Society
on Tuesday night. It was upon the manners, habits, and destinies of
the American tribe of I.O.U. Indians, and was prepared from notes
taken, by several travellers, and also from native records, . It appears
that the I.O.U. Indian was originally English, and that his ancestors
passed over to the New World in the seventeenth i. For man
ears he preserved the noble characteristics of his stock, and showe
imself wise, brave, and independent. But the deteriorating influences
of climate, and still more a vast infusion of inferior anim. ism, in the
form of convict Irish, deboshed Germans, and the accumulated scum of
other nations, combined to demoralise the Englishman, and a few
generations have brought him more and more closely into assimilation
with the aboriginal Indians of the Western Continent. We now find
that he has lost nearly all traces of his English descent, and has acquired
the }. but not the sayage virtues of the aborigines. Instead
of the dignified silence which is so picturesque a feature in them, he
cultivates the art of talk in its amplest and noisiest form, infinitely
prefers the longest to the shortest oration or letter, and has recently
chosen a Chief *: because there was more of him than of any
of his rivals. The I.O.U. Indian is excessively fond of smart dress,
and attires himself early in the morning in the costume worn by
civilised persons as full dress, and upon his females especially he loves
to heap every conceivable piece of incongruous finery, in imitation, as
he fancies, of the fashionable ladies of France. He is very extravagant,
but entirely, unscrupulous as to the payment of debts, and when such
yment is demanded, he whoops, leaps, and declares that his abode is
in the setting sun, which he considers a good plea. Formerly a warlike
character, he seems to have lost this attribute, and though irritable and
revengeful, he displays no aptitude for the combinations which make
war a science. But, in common with the aboriginal Indian, he delights
in safe mischief, and his exultation at burning a house, or choking up a
harbour, is very demonstrative. He has acquired the name of I. §º
from his latest expedients to raise money, when refused it by bankers
and others who have declined to trust him. Of his religion not much
seems to be known, except that he swears a good deal, never laughs,
and refers to something which he calls Dollar as the Great First Cause
of all his actions. He has a strange hatred for the black man, whom he
illtreats, either physicallyormorally, as much as he can. But he is notwith-
out many redeeming points, and often evinces generosity and humanity
and is so desirous to learn better things, that he plunders foreigners §f
their books upon all occasions. These are good signs, and there is no
reason for despair of his future, if he can be brought into contact as
much as . with European civilisation, the same remedy which
indeed .. in his calmer moments, advocates as the means of
elevating the negro, though the I.Q. U. Indian has never sincerely
tried that experiment. We have to thank the Ethnological Society for
the above heads of a most instructive paper.
JUST THE WERY NAME FOR HIM.
THE following appeared (go and buy the paper, sceptic) in the Times
of Thursday last:-

by sending merely his initials, to conceal his real name. However, it
has slipped out, spite of his attempts to hide it. For there is no doubt
that a person, sending, conscience-money to, the CHANCELLQR “on
account of Income Tax,” only tells the reaſ truth when he writes himself

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN.
(“1 passed a small Cot.")
IPAssed a small Court where the lawyers abound,
And a singular change met my view;
Uncommonly pious their faces I found,
And their studies remarkably new.
They seemed Catechumens who’d come to repeat
Their task from the Testaments twain: , .
And who, I exclaimed, has accomplished this feat?
*The Shepherd of Šalisbury Plain.”
For one on the Thirty-nine Articles gazed,
A second the Pentateuch bore, .
A third (who I own looked excessively dazed)
Was conning the Fathers of yore.
Another compared Doctors HookER and LowTH,
While his friend worked at WATTs and RomaDNE;
But the name that I found was in every one’s mouth,
Was “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.”
And what is the work that the Shepherd has set,
That leads to the scene I behold?
Cried one, on whose forehead was written To Let,
“To hunt out a sheep from his fold. .
The sheep has been bleating and breaking the peace
An º, sheep should maintain,
So we’ll soon have him qut, and he’ll forfeit his fleece
To the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.”
My heart it waxed soft, I was ready to weep,
‘That seems a severe thing to do,
Suppose the kind Shepherd had thrown the poor sheep
§. carrots to chew.
If those didn’t silence his noises, old man,
He’d deserve castigation and pain:”—
“That’s not, Sir,” he answered, the pastoral plan
of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.
“Qur Shepherd’s a piper—his sheep, if they bleat,
Must bleat to the tune of his pipe; -
Or the sheep-dog you see on that well cushioned seat
Will give them a snap and a gripe.”
Then a whistle was heard, and away they all bowled,
To hunt the schismatic again;
And I said, “I am glad that I’m not of the fold
Of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.”
DLAMONDS FROM THE WINDHAM MINE.
SoME folks are always finding fault. Growling is made about the
expense of the WINDHAM inquiry. Mr. Punch begs to say that he
thinks that the result of thirty days trial and an expenditure of £50,000,
amply repays both the trouble and the outlay. At present all that has
been attained is the knowledge of three facts; but then, what facts they
are. NEwTON's discoveries are mare's nests in comparison. They are—
1st. That MR. Col.ERIDGE would rather be a Magdalen than a
Pharisee.
2nd. That MR. WARREN does not know what is meant by “Skittles.”
And— -
3rd. That MR. CHAMBERs has read the Bible.
These three statements the case has called forth from the lips of the
gentlemen named, and though that is all that has been done, Mr. Punch
considers that the interests of society have been immensely advanced,
and so he hopes the Lords Justices will think, when they have to settle
who shall bear the costs.
Rumoured Change of Fashion.
A REPORT has been current for some days, in well-informed circles,
that the preposterous framework of hoops and cages, which has so long
been in use to extend female dress to extravagant dimensions under
the name of Crinoline, is going out of fashion in Paris. ... We sincerely
trust this rumour is true. English Society takes its tone from Parisian;
and good taste has too long been outraged by the social nuisance, not
to say the social evil, Crinoline.
A STANDING CALUMN.Y.
WE are afraid the Nelson Column will never, fall within our expe:
:º be able to say conscientiously that the Pillar is a finished
wor art.
PITY THE POOR DIPLOMATES.
THQse poor diplomatists! . Theirs is really a case for the strongest
appeal to the compassion of John BULL and his Parliament.
ust think of them, poor fellows; all,—from ambassadors and envoys
extraordinary to ministers and chargés d'affaires—from secretaries of
legation to attachés—going through their repulsive and Herculean toil
for nothing-nay, for less than nothing—paying, in fact, for the privi-
lege of filling the laborious posts which leave them out of pocket at the
end of the year.
The top-sawyers of them are reduced to live in huge houses, splendidly
furnished and warmed and lighted at the public expense; to give great
dinners, and balls, and receptions; to keep carriages and horses; to dress
and dance, and go to the opera, and attenda treadmill round of ministerial
parties and Royal or Imperial levées and drawing-rooms, and hunting:
parties, to say nothing of such minor duties as despatch-writing and
interviews with ministers and the endless bother of getting troublesome
English travellers out of scrapes, or into society.
The poor secretaries of legation have to follow their chief's example.
They are compelled to live in expensive lodgings, and dine at the best
restaurants, and keep their equipages, and make themselves agreeable
in the coulisses (and we all know what that implies), and the still poorer
attachés have to tread in the steps of the secretaries. The total of
salaries paid by JoHN BULL for these onerous and distasteful duties,
amounts to a mere fleabite of £180,000 a-year—of which sum £50,000
goes in the salaries of the Ambassadors at the capitals of the Great
Powers, and don’t enable these poor men, with the strictest economy,
to make both ends meet even then
SIR. H. Wootton defined an ambassador as ‘A man sent abroad to lie
for the benefit of his country.' . It seems that we ought to define him
nowadays as a man sent abroad to ruin himself for the same patriotic
purpose. There was SIR G. SEYMoUR spending his £10,000 at Vienna
in nine months, and left to live as he could, on tick, or charity, or his
own resources, if he have any (which we sincerely hope he has), for the
other three; and SIR. A. Bucha NAN spending £1,500 more than his
salary at Copenhagen, and eating a hole of £1000 in his capital besides;
and MR; Sidney Lowcock, (first, attaché at St. Petersburg), with a
salary of £380, and absolutely unable to find the bare means of shelter
and locomotion for less than £640, viz., £420 for house-rent, and £220
for his carriage!
It is evident that this sort of thing cannot, and ought not to go on.
Either we must consent to see the Diplomatic Service shut against all
but millionnaires, or double and treble the salaries of everybody con-
nected with it-give LQRD CowLEY and LQRD NAPIER, and LQRD
BLOMFIELD, and LoRD Loftus, and SIR. H. BULwer £20,000 a-piece
instead of £10,000. pay their secretaries, say £2,500 a-piece, and every
attaché £1,000 at the very least.
Everybody of good breeding, and any knowledge of the world, must
be perfectly aware that it is iº. for them to keep up a decent
appearance for less. It is notorious that nobody of their rank, or rank
corresponding to theirs, in Paris, in Vienna, in St. Petersburg, in Con-
stantinople, does manage to pay his way under the higher figure. We
all know the colossal scale of French and German and Russian fortunes
and salaries, and the shameful contrast they present with the pittances
we |...} the unfortunate noblemen and gentlemen whom we have ill-
veigled into our Diplomatic Service.
an we wonder if, under these circumstances, the Service is generally
shunned; that it is every day becoming more difficult to find people
willing to accept embassics, or to tempt young men into attachéships?
That the fact is so is but too notorious. If some remedy is not applied,
we shall soon have the upper classes withdrawing altogether from the
service of the Foreign Office, and diplomacy abandoned to the lower
orders, such as now supply our consulates. - - - -
It is no use, for the sufferers to shut up their grievances within the
cover of a blue book, or to ventilate their destitution to the unsympa-
thetic ears of a House of Commons Committee. Let them come out
boldly in an appeal to the public; let them line the paré from Charing
Cross to the door of the Foreign Office in Whitehall Gardens, every
man in his official blue and gold uniform, with his ribbons and orders
on, and with a placard, before him—“I AM STARYING !” Perhaps it
would be well to further, and taking a hint from the practice of
the Cattle Shows, #. each to ticket himself with his place of service,
his salary, and his hardships, as thus:-
“Ambassador at Paris. Scarcely a roof to cover me. A House
nominally found me, but not more than £29,000 spent on it in the last
ten years! Qnly £10,000 salary, ald £1,000 for coals and candles!!
Obliged to live five months every year at Chantilly, with large orna-
mental grounds and an expensive châsse to keep up !!!. As much as I
can do to get a decent dinner for self and family, let alone enter-
taining my staff or English visitors!!!!”
We cannot think that this affecting spectacle could fail of its effect.
John, BULL's iron bowels, would melt, and his rigid purse-strings
would become supple, and he would hasten to do justice to the worst
paid, hardest worked, least desirable service of all included in his
insignificant Civil Service Estimates.

WHAT a nuisance the Police are! Really
their tyrannyisinsupportable. The very Rag-
Pickers are rising against the despots. A
heart-rending case clamours for vengeance
against the minions, and is being worked by
the penny press. A poor woman, who drives
about with a cart, in the country, a sort of
moving Marine-Storekeeper, has actually been
taken up for “possessing” a sack that did
not belong to her, the right owner of which
had the ferocity to hand her over to the
police. Heavenly Powº, do we live in the
nineteenth century! When we consider the
encouragement which the Marine-Storekeeper
in London offers to youth to cultivate its
powers of observation, and how heteaches
the value of the smallest article, and gives a
practical lesson on the convertibility of pro-
º he, and his country imitator, ought to
e considered as Public. Instructors, and
Qught not to be tyrannised over by a brutal
Police. In this case the abominable Magis-
trates actually fined the unoffending woman
ten shillings and costs for having a sack that
did not belong to her, and though the haughty
and, insolent, tyrants, did not exactly say so,
we believe that in the depth of their black
souls they thought her very little better than
a Thief. As if a Marine-Storekeeper ever
did a dishonest thing. We blush for these
Dogherries, we blush for the Police, we
blush for the civilisation of the century; in
fact, we propose to go on blushing generally
until further notice.

THREE HUNDRED WORDS.
MR. PUNCH observed, the other day, a very ill-founded Lament on
the part of a clerical philologist. In writing upon the use of the
English language by English people, he stated that very few persons
were aware of the resources of their native tongue; that so-called
educated º: had a very limited vocabulary, while among the humbler
class the riches of the language were unknown. And he held up as
subjects for pity the inhabitants of his own village, very few of whom,
he said, knew more than Three Hundred Words.
Mr. Punch, whose nose testifies that he knows “Canaan's rich lan-
guage, in perfection,” and who also-
“Knows the Greek, plenteous in words and sense,
The Chaldee wise, the Arabic profound,
The Latin, pleasing with its eloquence,
The braving Spanish with its lofty sound,
The lisping French that fits a lady vain
The German, like the people, rough and plain,
The English, full and rich, his native country's strain,”
replies, authoritatively, Bosh! And he commends the villagers who
can manage to ſº through life with Three Hundred Words, as LEoNIDAs
has got through the Ages with Three Hundred Spartans.
What would our Clerical Philologist have? If Three Hundred Words
suffice a man to say his prayers, court, wed, and thenceforth blow up
his wife, scold his children, direct a stranger the shortest way out of
that village, demand beer at the Blue Pig, and state which way the fox
went-what, more does the man want? If a wandering circus comes
round, and the º: wishes to 59 to the show, he can ask, as a lady
would do, “When do they begin,” and would be no better off, if he
could ask, as her lady's maid would do, “At what hour does the per-
formance commence.”. If a friend has been up to the Crystal Palace,
our villager can say, “What wur the best thing, thee saw?” and this
is a straighter way of getting at the fact than would be employed by the
Bagman who stops at the Blue Pig aforesaid, and who would say, “And
what article in that miscellaneous assortment struckyou as most remark-
able?” Was not—as hath been written of old—the famous “Thou art
the man,” which would have been the villager's phrase, far better than
“Why, you łº are the very individual to whom I have been
alluding all this time?” Is not “Main good times for the crops,
master,” worth a dozen of “I really think, Sir, that the continuance of
this delightful weather promises favourably for the harvest,” and would
you not sooner talk to a man who saw you looking at a stream, and
said, “There’s chub in them pools, Sir,” than to one who smirked out
that he should judge that the river at our feet, offered an inviting
prospect to the angler? Finally, and as the crucial test—Mr. Punch is
a married man i does not want another wife, but if instead of being
an elegant middle-aged gentleman of the highest accomplishments, he
were a handsome honest young rustic, asking a pretty girl, a certain
question, he would very considerably prefer the rosy º said, “I
love thee, JAN,” to the equally rosy pair that said, “Must I confess,
ALPHONso, that you have inspired a sincere affection in this bosom ?”
Parson—shut up—or rather don't, for you are a goodfellow. Go and
W. sermon which can be understood by the men of Three Hundred
Orols.
A POPULAR WANT.
THE entertainment annually given to the inmates of the Asylum for
Idiots, Earlswood, came off on Monday last, consisting in a distribution
of prizes from Christmas-trees, a treat to tea and cake, and a series of
“special amusements,” in the course whereof, according to the news:
papers, was performed a musical interlude, “in which the aptitude of
the off sers of the institution to amuse and interest the subjects of
their care was specially brought out”—very specially indeed, thus:-
“Negro melodists made their appearance in a “London Street,' and were en-
countered by great applause.”
So we should think. ---
The popularity of Negro melodists is very great. Asylums for idiots
are by no means so numerous as they ought to be.
A Guarantee.
“The Opinione states that the EMPERoR of THE FRENch is taking steps with
Russia for the recognition of the Kingdom of Italy by that Power.”
Quite correct, and we understand that the EMPEROR's most cogent
argument is delivered in the words of LoRD BYRON.—
“And with the addition of a slight Police,
Turin's and Moscow's climes are of a piece."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
ERILY, friend Punch, there
be stranger thin now
happening in the dramatic
world than are dreamt of
even in Proverbial Philo-
sophy. Fancy a pack of
vestrymen fired with the
ambition to defend the plays
of SHAksPEARE from foreign
innovation, and jumping up
like Britons to protect from
French invasion what they
call his “sacred text''. No
wonder Monsieu RFECHTER
for awhile has fled to Paris,
to escape the virtuous wrath
of such all-powerful assail-
ants. Here is the threat of
vengeance, hurled forth
as with a trumpet-note:—
ESTRY HALL, KEN-
NINGTON.—A few Vestry-
men intend performing Othello
on Wednesday, January 22nd.
They neither affect the “Stagy"
nor the “French School,” but
will attempt, with reverence for
the sacred text, such an inter-
pretation as common sense dic-
tates. Admission by Invitation
Tickets only.
“I have heard of ‘Miracle Plays,’ and I really think Othello, per-
formed by a few vestrymen, must have been a play well worthy of the
name. It surely must have been a miracle if they got through with it
at all, at least #I may make a guess at their capacity for acting, from
the specimens of Westrydom whom I have chanced to meet; and if
they much relied on ‘common sense’ to help them, Isadly fear they
found such aid fall rather short. I wonder, was there some sly reſe;
rence to the vestryman who blacked his face to play the Moor, and
doubtless lost himself completely in the arduous attempt to personate
that character, in the advertisement I saw a few days afterward in the
Times, headed rather ominously ‘A SABLE MUFF LOST **
“Not being so lucky as to get an invitation, I did not see this
wondrous miracle-play performed, and, therefore, cannot gratify a
(doubtless) anxious universe by saying how it went. Perhaps it was
the sight of these bold vestrymen's advertisement that tempted me, the
other evening into what was once Miss. KELLY's Theatre, where
amateur Kings Richard, Hamlets, and Othellos, used a while, since to
abound. These classic boards no longer now are trodden by young
Roscii, but have for some weeks past been danged upºn by pretty
piquant Miss D1 RHoNA, who has lately here been charming, her
admirers by the archness of her manner, and the briskness of her legs.
Her place is now supplied by a farce and a burlesque, for neither of
j. can I say º: and by a pleasant little sparkling opera by
OFFENBAch, who, if he be a Hebrew, will excuse me for remarking, it
is quite a by-jeto work. The music is º: graceful, elegant, and
lively, and on the whole it is agreeably and prettily performed. MR.
MoRGAN has an organ ' (as the swell critics would call it) not so well-
trained as GIUGLINI's, nor so powerful as TAMBERLIK's ; but he sings
in taste and tune, and utters nglish words, so that English ears can
hear them, and that is more than many an English singer now can do.
Miss MIRA STANLEY, too, although not quite so wondrous as her classic
name implies, is yet a very smart and lively little lady, and sings an
acts with such vivacity, that, the business never while she is on
the scene. Her quarrelling duet with her fair rival, Miss PAYNE, is as
brisk a bit of fun as one would wish to hear and see, and her high clear
voice tells well in the lively drinking trio, which is as sparklingºs the
beverage supposed to be imbibed. (Let me advise you, thoug, Miss
MIRA, to leave out that small coarseness about your “falling on '-
slight hesitation—“on the ground.” Such hints may please the gallery,
but they offend the stalls.)
“Altogether, then, Le Mariage aur Lanternes is very well worth seeing
in its present English dress; and I hope it may so please the fickle-
#if public as to be succeeded by a similar success. Though far
from being perfect, its execution is so good that one may wait for some-
thing better with reasonable hope. An Opéra Comique is a novelty in
England, and the Royalty Theatre is of just the size to suit such
pleasant little pieces as OFFENBAch and hosts of foreign writers have
composed, but which our own composers appear to lack, the humour
and vivacity to write. As a rule one goes to theatres that one may be
amused; and this is possible with operas as well as with mere farces,
provided that the operas be neatly written and composed, and pleasantly
performed.
“Speaking thus of opera reminds me that I promised to say another
word or two concerning Covent Garden, where MR. BALFE's new work
will, in the week, when this is Fº have reached its fiftieth night.
Čalf me if you please so, a play-bilious’ critic (I thank thee, Punch,
for teaching me that word), I still must say this opera does not improve
upon acquaintance; partly because excrescences, which should have

commend MR. HARRISQN's clear utterance and musical delivery (few

not object to find his small talk somewhat shortened; and for the credit
of our ancestry, one would like to see Lord Rochester presented with
his tipsiness a little more toned down.
“Although written by one of our most entertaining farce:wrights,
and the one who so luxuriates in hard-hitting, bustling fun, there is not

KING CABBAGE IN CHANCERY.
SMITH O'BRIEN, of the Cabbages, unlike his friend MEAGHER, of the
Sword, has got a real grievance at last. When he had committed the
felony for which he was transported, he prudently determined to cheat
the Crown he could not knock off, and he assigned his property to
trustees for his family. The pardoned felon now wants his property
back. But the trustees, who seem sensible men, consider that whereas the
interests of persons who are not yet of an age to act for themselves are
involved, the best plan will be not to give back the property to O'BRIEN,
as, if that Irish giant took to discounting MR. SEWARD's bills, or
otherwise scattering the money in further attempts against hated Éng.
land, the infants might unpatriotically grumble, and be down on the
trustees for not taking care of the tin. So the matteris referred to the
Court of Chancery. The Irish giant proposes a compromise, and de-
mands an “adequate annuity.” If this is granted, he promises to settle
near Dublin and “devote himself to litherature and politics.” If not, he
means to rush into a foreign land “and seek an honourable death in a
remature adventure”—stay, we have misplaced his adjectives. Well,
e is a silly old fellow, but we cannot wish him any harm, and we hope
that he will get his annuity, and study literature and politics, of which
his letters and his acts show that he has hitherto been in tremendous
ignorance. We should be sorry that the full measure of contemptuous
pardon were not dealt out to him. In a similar case, in any of the other
countries which MR. Q'BRIEN considers so superior to England, he
would have been incontinently hanged up out of the way, and ſis family
would have had as much chance of his property as he has of being king
of Oireland. Let the lesson be read to ..". culprits—England can
not only afford to forgive them, but returns the money found on their

True Patriotism.
THE American organs, the New York Herald and the Morning Star,
have, we understand, entered into a compact not only for the exchange
of leading articles (almost a superfluous arrangement, from the curious
resemblance of the literary and political pººl. of the two papers),
but for giving the most convincing proof of the conviction of the pro-
rietors that the new Federal notes are as good as dollars or sovereigns.
}. future the whole of the staff of the twin journals are to be paid in the
SEwARD shin-plasters. The notification has given the liveliest satis-
faction to the contributors and other employés.
A CLOUDY PASSAGE.
It is said that there is a silver lining to every cloud, but the cloud
that has lately hung over America has now lost even that consolatory
feature, for it is lined only with tissue-paper, and to look upon that as
an acceptable substitute for a currency of specie, is nothing better than
a tissue of absurdity.

AND so, You see, somehow or other we CAME To GRIEF
IMPOLITIC PERSECUTION IN SPAIN.
GREAT excitement has been produced among the Roman Catholic
portion of HER MAJESTY's subjects, by the intelligence that out of
upwards of thirty Protestants of the south of Spain, who, many months
ago, were committed to prison, for the mere exercise of their religion,
some of those most noted have been brought to trial and condemned to
seven years of the galleys. The chief offence committed by MATAMoRos
and his º: is said to have consisted in reading a translation of
the Bible. The law of Spain punishes this offence with seven years of
penal servitude. But who set the law in motion?. It is whispered that
the prosecutors, or the instigators to the prosecution, of these men are
actually the Spanish, priesthood; and there are in this country some
people of understanding and education who quite believe the Catholic
clergy of Spain capable of such gross intolerance!
It is felt by the Roman Catholic body, that if the charge of such
abominable persecution as that above stated could be sustained against
their Church in Spain, it would justify British Protestants in believing
that CARDINAL WISEMAN and his ecclesiastical subordinates would do
precisely the same thing here, if they only got the upper hand; a sup-
position likely to deprive those estimable divines of any concession or
advantage they may expect to derive from the progress of the principles
of religious liberty. e Roman Catholics are, therefore, most anxious
to disavow the bigots and fanatics, whoever they may be, that have
caused the imprisonment and condemnation of the Spanish Hrotestants ;
and we are in a position to state that they are §: hold an indig-

created among the faithfulisimmense. They are allupin arms; and what
has particularly incensed and ºff. them is the consideration that
the prime minister of QUEEN ISABELLA’s Government is MARSHAL
O'DoNNELL. They are unanimous in intending to invoke him by the
bones of his ancestors to insist on the immediate liberation of the pri;
soners condemned to the galleys for the crime of Protestantism, and
also forthwith to propose to the Cortes the repeal of all laws affecting
freedom of conscience. They feel that, but for making some demon-
stration against the bigotry, which has been practised in an eminently
Catholic country, they would be unable to go on enjoying, with quiet
minds, the liberty of worship which they possess, much less to ask, with
any face, the least further advance of justice to Ireland.
A requisition to LoRD PALMERston, urging him to interfere for the
deliverance of the Spanish Protestant galley-slaves, drawn u y the
Roman Catholic hierarchy, will lie for signature at every chapel of that
denomination both in London and the country, and also at Punch's
Office. The number of signatures attached to these requisitions will
correspond exactly to that of the Roman Catholic population-infants.

DAUNTLESS BRAVERY OF COUNSEL.
Among the natural qualifications necessary to success at the Bar, one
of the principal is that of courage. MR. CHAMBERs, Q.C., is endowed
with a large share of this forensic requisite, if, in the course of his
address to the §§ on the WINDHAM case, the ensuing passage, re-
ported as part of that oration, really occurred:—
“He was quite convinced that the jury, understanding, as they now did, the
principles which were to govern them in their decision, must inevitably come to
the conclusion, that it was their duty to MR. WINDHAM by their verdict in his
present state of mind from being victimised, and injured, and destroyed, by persons
who were ever ready to prey upon weakness, especially when that weakness was
accompanied by º or moderate means.”
.The courage which GENERAL WINDHAM has had the credit of having
º at the Redan, ; that, which the boldest of British gre-
nadiers undoubtedly did display at Alma and Inkermann, is less remark-
able than that instanced by GENERAL WINDHAM's counsel in the above
remark—if he made it. NELson on the quarter-deck of the Victory

the foregoing words were uttered the lawyers concerned in the Wind-
ham Lunacy Commission had already nearly eaten up MR. WINDHAM's
estate, and devoured a vast deal more of his property than any of the
rogues, blackguards, and improper persons with whom he wasted it in
riotous living, the courage which could enable one of the chief of those
lawyers, and of those particular lawyers, moreover, by whose agency
the º were instituted, to allude to people by whom his client’s
nephew was in danger of being “victimised, injured, and destroyed,”
appears immense. Talk no more of ALEXANDER, or PERICLEs, or
CoNoN, or LysanDER, or ALCIBIADEs. Of all the gallant heroes,

if the plan of taxation which he proposes is as practicable as the prin-

. his audience that,
“His scheme provided that men should be taxed according to their power of
spending."
In these few words lies the answer to the pedantic moral idiots who
keep insisting, in the face of common sense, that all incomes ought to
be taxed at equal rates. Ability to buy is ability to pay. It is folly to
live up to an uncertain, income as nearly as prudence would allow if it
were a certain one. The folly of such expenditure is immense, and just
equal in magnitude to the injustice of corresponding taxation. The
measure º fools on the one hand is that of the rogues on the other.
But these are truisms, which MR. HUBBARD must not expect to per-
suade gentlemen of independent property to consider.

THE Friend { India is a party whose friendship has been so credit-
ably manifested, in other words, the paper is so much more respectable
than a good many of the Indian †. that Mr. Punch quotes from
it without the hesitation which would arise in his mind, were he asked
to remark upon one of those paragraphs, reeking with slang and bitter
beer, in which fast officers and spiteful civilians abuse one another and
their betters in the columns of the Indian Press. -
The following statement, which Mr. Punch, can only describe as
Truly Awful, appears in the Friend of India, and has been copied into
English journals.
Alluding to a row which is said to have occurred between H.R.H.
the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE and LoRD WILLIAM PAULET (son of the last
MARQUIs of WINCHESTER) at Portsmouth, the writer says that the
Duke, who went down to inspect the division comprising the garrison,
which is commanded by LoRD WILLIAM,<-
“Found fault with the regiments and manoeuvres, and “pitched into' all con-
cerned, not excepting the commanding officers, with a free use of certain expletives
which gentlemen do not indulge in towards each other in the ordinary intercourse
of society, although ...; perhaps a groom or valet may corne in for a share
of such imprecations on their visual organs.”
Well, supposing this to be so, great men lived before AGAMEMNoN, and
great men swore ...”. is to say, previously to the swearing by
—the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE. “Our army swore terribly in Flanders,”
and up to the DUKE of WELLINGTON's time, inclusive, the practice was
not discontinued. Of course, we know that, now, the tone of feeling
in the Army is such that the most fiery young ensign would blush like
a young lady were he overheard to make, under the strongest excite-
ment, the faintest reference to the personage who º: to MR. J.
MILTON, offered that remarkably neat Address to the Sun. But H.R.H.
belongs to the Old School, and is a Prae-Minié-ite, and so on. It seems
however, that LQRD WILLIAM PAULET did not make allowance for the
iyuke's historical position, turned sulky, and when the Commander-in-
Chief went to Loß WILLIAM's house at night, everybody was ther;
except the host. He, being sent for, *: “his compliments, and
could not come.” How ar, under any provocation, a nobleman is
right in absenting himself from his house when an invited guest attends
(let the provocation to absence be what it may), is a question for the
author of the Handbook of Etiquette. However, negotiations and re-
presentations were made, and the Duke behaved like a man and a
prince. Says the writer,<
“On the part of H.R. H. the fullest and most satisfactory apology was offered, and
for the evening things passed off. Next day the principal officers were assembled
and addressed by the Duke, who said he wished to retract anything he might have
hurriedly said before them respecting LoRD WILLIAM, who he thought deserved the
best credit for the condition in which he had his division, and he added that they
would see his real opinion in a General Order he was about to issue. Accordingl
an order was published, signed by SIR Richard AIREy, the Quartermaster-General,
in itself an unusual proceeding. In this the Commander-in-Chief highly compli
of late years, have noticed
the fact, that the physiogno-
my of the American of the
United States is beginning
to exhibit a resemblance to
that of the Red Indian.
The barbarous act of sinking

the ferocity with which the
permanent ruin of that port

the Northern Press, indicate

mented Lord WILLIAM PAULET, and all concerned, on the “marked' efficiency and
thoroughly satisfactory state of the garrison, and said that it reflected the greatest
possible credit on them.”
Now Mr. Punch has very little to say upon all this, and that little
shall not be long. He was always partial to his friend GEoRGE, and
likes him very much for having been prompt to make atonement to a
gentleman's feelings. It was done, if the statements in this article be
accurate, in a iſiºn: and chivalrous manner. But—
Which view of the case was the right one, that which elicited from
a keen and accomplished soldier a torrent of angry rebuke, or that on
which the General Order was based ?
If the latter, of course, the Duke did quite right in retracting the
rebuke, and praising up the Portsmouth Garrison. But if the former,
it does look as if the exceeding good-nature of the Duke, and his desire
to heal his subordinate's broken head, induced him to put on the plaster
at the expense of the interests of H.R.H.’s Cousin's Army. The writer
in the Friend says–
“I do not “answer for the correctness of the details,’ but of the main fact I have
very little doubt. It is not the first time that this impetuosity of the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE and his habit of swearing at officers has brought him into the undig-
nified position of having to eat his own words. It is a fact of which I am personally
cognisant, that SIR John PENNEFATHER tendered his resignation of the Aldershot
command on more than one occasion, because of the language used to him by the
Duke, and that the resignation was only withdrawn on an apology being made.
It is also said that on one occasion some officer fought his Royal Highness with his
own weapons, and returned his oaths with compound interest."
Well, Mr. Punch appends this last paragraph because he would much
prefer to believe that a gallant and hasty Prince is in the habit of
giving his tongue the rein in an old-fashioned and undesirable manner,
than that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army would look
over important faults for the sake of making things pleasant. Swearing
is very wrong, very vulgar, and very nonsensical; but it is not so
objectionable as over-looking errors which we are bound in duty to
correct. On the whole, therefore, Mr. Punch, who does not forget
that the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE shared the dangers of the Crimea, and
as since done his work in the best way he could, according to his
lights, thinks that GEORGE had better call on him at No. 85, and be
j to a little. But if he is busy, he may just take this hint. Let
him be as vigilant, exacting, and resolved as becomes the British
C. in C., but instead of expressing in modern English any indignation
he may feel, let H.R.H. take a leaf out of Rabelais. When the
excellent Panurge was in a frantic passion, but had reasons for not
iving it vent, he called a page unto him, and said, “My pretty little
oy, take my cap and spectacles (having a care you do not break
them), go down into the court below, and swear for me for half an
hour. I will do the same for thee another time.” Let our friend
G. P. call a red-faced aide-de-camp, give him his cocked-hat and feathers,
and bid him go to the nearest, barrack, and blaze away until further
notice. So shall the dignity of the Duke and the interests of the Army
be equally and happily preserved.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 53
had I been in the most vinegarish of moods, I think I must
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
Y DEAR PUNCH,- Now
that America possesses
what in fine writing is
called a “theatre of war’
(if that can rightly be
termed “war’ which con-
sists in standing still and
staring at, each, other
across a bit of river, at
the cost of something
over two million pounds
per day), it would seem
that in America the busi-
ness at the other theatres
is also at a stand-still;
at least if one may guess
so from the number of
erformers who have
ately left the States, and
now are acting on our
Stage. Of Mrs. ConwAY, MRs. Bowy Rs, MR. SoTHERN, MR. Booth, I have
already spoken as recently arriving; and half a score of others I might easily
have named, had I found a suitable occasion so to do. Among them Miss JANE
Coombs, I think, deserves a word of notice, if only for the reason that the news-
papers in general, without pointing out her faults, have given her such faint praise
. been held sheer condemnation. I did not see her in the Love Chace, for I
still have MRs. NISBET too much in my mind's eye to give a quite unbiassed look
at any barely-tried successor; and having seen her in the Honeymoon I can well
conceive Miss Coom.Bs could scarce have given full force to such a character as
Constance, that ‘ebullient heroine,’ as I find one critic calls her. But Miss Coom.Bs
is very clearly an actress of much promise, and this promise one may hope ere no far
distant date to see her realise in performance. She has a pleasant face and person,
and a full rich voice, which she uses without mouthing, or ruining it by rant.
Besides, she has a far more lady-like demeanour than is at all common just at
present on our Stage; and she has withal that delicacy of gesture and graceful ease
of movement which, if not inborn by nature, are not readily acquired. It may
indeed be urged that she acts somewhat too tamely, and barely gives a passion
vent; but this is a less fault than that of over-acting, and one that it is generally
more easy to correct. The Honeymoon requires a lady, though a savage one; and
I thought her scenes of savagery were very fairly done. She was fiery and wilful,
without being quite so blusterous as the Countess is too often; and the quiet ten-
derness with which she F. her husband's first praise with a kiss was womanlike
in its impulsiveness, and touching in its contrast to her previous wilder mood.
“Miss Coom BS’s place is now supplied by MR. SoTHERN, whose quaintly funny
Lord Dundreary is as humorous a novelty as one would wish to see. Whether
MR. SoTHERN can play other parts than those of stupid-witted stuttering dandies,
it remains yet to be seen; but he at least deserves our thanks for having shown us
a new specimen of the genus Swell, quite different from any we have yet seen on
the Stage. Another curious character, imported likewise from the States, is the
genu-ine Yankee that MRs. FLORENCE was, I fancy, the first to introduce to
us. She and her husband have been playing where. Othello not long, since apos.
trophised his looking-glass, and feared to make the chaste stars Blush for his
complexion. To i. Willow Song, profaned, as purists think, by being sung
as a street-chorus, have succeeded ‘Bobbing Araeound’ and “My ilaiary Aieann, '
melodies which clearly must have something more in them than cynics seem to
think, or an enlightened British public would surely not have been so smitten
with them when they first came out, nor be still content to listen whenever they
are sung. It is scarce too much to say, that MRs. FLORENCE sings, these gems
as no one else can sing them, for she can squeak at least six octaves higher than
most vocalists, and #. sharp shrill notes . utters are quite enough to save her
songs from failing flat.
. ... I suppose her Yankee, Gal is no likelier to be met with in American society than
is the Irish Boy presented by her husband; who in that vilely stupid, trashy piece,
the Irish Emigrant, failed to draw a laugh so well as MR. DREw. }. the character
is one of those eccentric whimsicalities, which by way of novelty may now and then
be tolerated, and, need not be much criticised so long as they amuse. What such
couples might do had they good pieces to work upon, is a problem that remains for
futurity to solve. The rule at present seems to be, that any sort of rubbish will
serve them as a groundwork: and I never yet have witnessed an exception to this
rule. Certainly, whatever be the failing of Miss Coombs, no one can accuse her
countrywoman, when acting as the Yankee Gal, of ‘a athetic histrionism.” Her
drolleries are somewhat cut-and-dried, may be; but she acts in raal airnest, and
the force of her ris comica would pull through a worse piece than the one she has
en playing in, if it be conceivable there could be a worse piece. Her humour is
as broad as a fashionable petticoat, but (to carry out the º though one may
not much admire it, at least it serves to make one laugh. The silliest of small
talk is somehow sure to win a smile, when spoken in that high-pitched nasal
Yankee voice; and the quaint, queer jerky gestures, and odd bobs by way of
curtsey, wherewith the Yankee Housekeeper accompanies her talk, are enough to
make a critic even break into a grin. The house was most hilarious the evening
I attended, and as laughing is infectious, I felt compelled to join in it. But even
ve smiled to hear
those wondrous little squeaks which MRs. Florence now
and then so drolly introduces; and which would almost
make one fancy that she had been taking lessons from the
tiniest of kittens, and that the squeakiest of guinea-pigs
had long formed her daily food.
“Of the pantomime at this house I have scarce room now
to. *}; except to say Miss HARRIs is a lively young
Dick.JPhittington, and MASTER HAsleM a most active and
intelligent Tom Cat. His feats on the trapeze are such as, I
suppºse, no cat has ever yet attempted, even on the tiles;
and the dearest old maid's tabby has never, yet displayed
more affection for its mistress, than the feeling for his

displays. “ONE WHO PAYs.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPENING OF THE INTERNATIONAL
EXHIBITION.
From the “Times,” Friday, May 2, 1862.
THE above heading is rather Hibernian... Yesterday was appointed
for the opening of the International Exhibition, and the magnificent
show was ready in all its gorgeousness. , But as there, cannot be a
dinner without guests, there can hardly be a show without visitors.
The officials had all arrived over-night, and by dint of cigars and an
early breakfast (whose goodness was, we hope, an omen of the way in
which refreshments .# be served) managed to wile away the hours
until the doors were set open. Then they calmly awaited the antici-
pated rush. But no rush took place. Nobody came in. At first it
was apprehended that some asinine policemen must have exerted their
usual intelligence, and opened everything except the outer barriers, and
after a pause, secretaries rushed out to behold. But all was open,
including the mouths of the astonished officials themselves. Not a
visitor arrived. Almanacs were hastily consulted, lest by some wild
mischance the wrong day had been fixed on. No, the day was all right.
After a time scouts were sent out, and presently a dismal rumour
travelling with the accustomed speed of bad news, revealed the awful
mystery. The whole World had stuckfast in Brompton. The expected
Lock had occurred, and the terrific array of vehicles, extending from the
Narrows to Bow, had pressed forward, and the fix had become inex-
tricable. Various suggestions were made in the despair of the moment.
The military naturally recommended artillery, the lawyers wished to
disperse the crowd by reading the Riot Act, and the Saturday Reviewers
were for throwing cold water on everything by means of fire-engines.
What will be done we know not. The beautiful day passed, the night
descended, and the World was still stuck in Brompton. We shall see
what to-day brings forth.
From the “Telegraph.”
“Open, Sesame !” was all very well, but when the cave was open,
what use, if the band would not, or could not advance P The Oriental
story was delightfully illustrated yesterday. The International Ex-
hibition was ready, but nobody could get into it. The army of visitors
was irredeemably blocked up in the defiles of Brompton, and but for
supplies, hospitably furnished at extortionate rates, § the tradesfolk
of that suburb, must have perished from want. It was impossible to
advance, and a retreat was still more impossible. Non concessere co-
Zumnae, that is to say, the dense columns could make no concessions.
SIR LEICESTER DEDLock, Baronet, was the Lord of Misrule on the
First of May. We |...". and put our foot in it, that is certain
though not in the Exhibition. Louis NAPOLEoN has been telegraphe
for, and replies that he is coming with his Sapeurs, a righteous reproach
to the Saps who ought to have provided against such anational disgrace.
Meantime, the World is stuck in Brompton.
From the “Morning Advertiser.”
... que Maribus tribuntur, masculine focus,” as HoRACE says,
but neither maribus nor horsibus, to speak facetiously, had a chance
yesterday in the focus to which all were attracted at Brompton. There
was a dead lock, and the key had not been found by a living soul up
to midnight, wº early hours, we left the hostelry of that
excellent Licensed Victualler (and governor of the schools) MR. BUNG,
of the Blue Pig. It is truly disgraceful that no approaches should have
been made, and we feel inclined to exclaim with CATILINE, Quousque
tandem, only the thought of a tandem or any other vehicle, aggravates
us into irritation. The Exhibition is a splendid success, but what is
the use of the finest cask of XXX if you cannot tap it? The whole
World is stuck in Brompton.
From the “Morning Star.”
We augured as much ! The demon Mars has achieved another of
his brutal victories. The International Exhibition stands a frowning
monument of our wickedness. Now, perhaps, the haughty aristocrats
who adopted the design of a military man, a Čaptain in the Engineers
instead of taking the beautiful plan furnished by a Sunday school
teacher of Cwmmyrogwithrian, may have grace to blush at the result
of their schemes. The World is stuck in Brompton | There is as dead
a lock as the aristocracy desire to see in politics. Not a vehicle can
stir, and fearfully the red lions, rampant eagles, and gules quarterings
of heraldic slang are being scratched and pounded in the confusion.
We have much sympathy for the exhibitors, especially, of course, for
those from America, whose wares far exceed in beauty all those of the
rest of the world, but we cannot feel for the titled Obstructives, who
now know what Obstruction means. The remedy would be easy to all
but the bloated minions of a mock civilisation. Let them all get out
and walk. The roads are muddy, doubtless—then they are still more
fitted for the muddy-headed noblesse who ever seek the dirtiest paths.
A great political lesson is read in the fastnesses of Brompton.
From the “Literary Gazette.”
Disgraceful! C'est la plus mauvaise jour du l’An, that Thursday,
that miserable Wendredi. The Exhibition, International as it is affec.
tedly called, but Irrational, as we humbly take leave to indicate it, is
not, we are informed, highlyº: but as the promoters did not
think fit to send us their advertisements and free admissions, we do
not speak proprio manu, though such a trumpery consideration would
not have deviated us into ungenerous criticism. But we really do, be-
lieve that there is nothing in the Exhibition worth seeing. That,
however, is matter of opinion, and magnus est veritas. Many thousands
of people wished to see for themselves, and such a lot of carriages was
never beheld. But le homme propose—the proverb, as Macbeth says, is
something fusty. We ourselves resolved to do justice, and “chartered ''
two cabs, in which we inserted ourselves and all our subscribers, and
drove towards the site. Sight, did we say? We take a sight at the
whole concern.
|From the “Saturday Review.”
CHEops was a man of the world, as well as a King, and if THRASY-
BULUs HALIcARNAssus may be believed, (and in spite of NICEPHORUs
and MR.G.Rote, we have a lingering faith, in the old Manicheist,) he
invited all his people to the inauguration of his Pyramid. He had per-
formed some ultra-Gladstonianisms in the way of making them pay for
it, and the osseous memoranda which they would encounter in their
way to the base might remind a good many of them that there was no
Ten Hours Act for the wor folk of Egypt. But not Louis
NAPOLEoN knows the way to the hearts of his frivolous constituents
better than did ChEoPs know how to please the Delta and the Thebais.
He gave them a great show, and we dare say, that leeks and onions
were liberally distributed by a Committee of the Coptic Agricultural
Association. Probably, too, he had religious rites, and we are at liberty
to believe that in this case, the composition of the BISHOP of Isis was
in better vernacular than anything with which we have been lately
afflicted from the hand of the BISHOP OF Oxford. One thing, how-
ever, we may venture to state, with Spurgeonesque dogmatism, that
KING CHEoPs did not do. He did not. º trap his º:
into a sort of ambush, worse than the Minotaur's labyrinth, and then
mock their sufferings from the stone threshold of the Pyramid. One
would have thought, from the dead, still calm of the lock at Brompton
on Thursday, that Medusa's Head had been at work there, only that it
was painfully clear no head at all had been used in the blundering
business.
A POLITE NOTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CORPS
- LEGISLATIF.
MR. John BULL presents his compliments to Count MoRNY, and
begs the Count to correct a statement made by him the other º
a sitting of the Corps Législatif, MR. Buli, is informed by MR
REUTER’s telegram that Count MoRNY, in his º; speech on that
occasion, was pleased to say:—“In the whole world there does not
exist a single Government, nor a single people, which is not distressed
by a grave crisis.” MR. John BULL, as the representative of the English
people, begs distinctly to protest that he has nothing grave or serious
the matter with him, certainly no fever, or any other disorder in which
a crisis can occur, and also that the Government of LoRD PAIMERSTON
is by no means in a critical condition. MR. BULL is thankful to say
that he is as well upon the whole as a gentleman of his years, who has
lived pretty freely, can expect to be, and has nothing much to complain
of beyond the burdens natural to his time of life, except a little ob-
struction in the cotton-works which he is troubled with just now, but
of which he looks confidently forward to the ultimate if not speed
removal. MR. John BULL hopes, therefore, that Count MoRNY w
take an opportunity of qualifying the generally correct statement, that
every Government and every people in the whole world is distressed by
a grave crisis, with the requisite exception. MR. BULL prays, the
Count MoRNY to accept the assurance of his distinguished consider-
ation.
Yankee Classics.
MR. Loy EJoy, the Hater of England, the Hamilcar who swears all
his little Hannibals to the work of destroying that air tarnation old
aristocratic Iniquity, has read in a schoolbook he has evidently prigged
from one of the Hannibals, (probably his VIRGIL crib,) something about
AEneas. LovEJoy states that a reference to the Trent affair reminds
him of Æneas's celebrated Infandum, Regina. He is more like AEneas
than he knows, for what that pious party was thinking of was his ultra-
precipitate retreat (leaving his Baggage) from Troy—a feat uncom-
monly like the movement at Bull's Run–yes, Sir!

A LAST WORD ON THE WINDHAM CASE.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“IN common, I imagine, with the rest, of º profession, I
have taken a great interest in this delightſul trial, and have especially
been pleased to see that no pains have been spared to make it as
expensive as possibly could be. The way in which a score of witnesses
have been brought to give the evidence that one would have sufficed to
give, has appeared to me a triumph of professional ability; and indeed,
the utter recklessness of cost which has on both sides marked the
conduct of the case, has afforded me the greatest satisfaction and
delight. In fact, the whole proceedings have been, with one exception,
a source of unmixed pleasure to me;, and for upwards of six weeks,
while the case has been continued, I have almost daily had an extra
.* my breakfast in reading how the trial has been cleverly pro-
ongred.
#. exception I allude to is, however, a most painful one, and I
much regret to say that a lawyer is the cause of it. If I believe the
Times reporter, Mr. CHAMBERs, in the course of his last speech for the
petitioners (which he skilfully contrived to extend over three days), by
a sad accident let fall the remark that—
“MR. WINDHAM, since he came of age, had enjoyed the services of no fewer than
seven attorneys, which was in itself a proof of weakness of mind."
“Qf course I cannot but regard this as a slip of the tongue, for
which I doubt not MR. CHAMBERs would most readily apologise were
an apology demanded on behalf of those maligned. For sure §: Sir, a
barrister who has to thank º for giving him his work, would
never cast a shadow of a shade of ill opinion on them º: by some
such accident as must have here occurred. It is an ill bird that fouls
its own nest; and though MR. C. be now at the top of the tree, he
should not throw bad words on those who are beneath him, and who
have been his support.
... “As for saying that employing, six or seven of us attorneys is ‘in
itself a proof of weakness of mind,’ that surely is a dictum which no
good lawyer would make, not merely because it casts an odium upon
his profession, but because it is, I think, ill-founded and untenable as
a point of law. , If MR. CHAMBERs really thought what he hastily
alleged, why did he not adduce the seven attorneys as his witnesses,
if the fact of their employment was a ‘proof of MR. WINPHAM's
weakness of mind’r, But no, of course he spoke in haste, and Idoubt
not has since felt ashamed of what he said., Had I, been on the jury
and such evidence had been brought, I should have held it quite con-
clusive of MR...WINDHAM's sanity, and a proof of more than common
rather than deficient, ºil. of sound good sense, and highly-culture
faculties of judgment and of mind. Some young men delight in
broughams, and some in breeding race-horses; but to spend one's
money freely ºf a lot of lawyers is surely a more sensible and proper
way of getting rid of it, Indulgence in the costly luxury of law, is
clearly far more rational than keeping packs of hounds, and so by
gradual extravagance, going to the dogs... A man whº spends his
income chiefly on his lawyers is a wise, judicious, noble benefactor of
his species, and could not possibly em loy it to any better end.
“Viewed merely as a charity, such a course, it must be owned,
deserves the highest praise. We poor, attorneys have of late been
terribly impoverished, and are almost all of us reduced well nigh tº
starving. What are called ‘reforms’ have ruined us §. hundreds, and
yet the public cruelly abstains from compensation. Many a legal web
would be closed in grim despair, were it not kept open for the chance
of some such fat young bluebottle as WINDHAM slipping into it, and
helping to replenish the exhausted legallarder. In short, more de-
serving objects for compassion and for charity it were impossible to
name, than the poverty-stricken creatures, seven of whose number he
has nobly helped to feed; and while offering him my gratitude for
aiding my poor brothers, I can only add my most sincere regret that I
was not one of them. Had Ionly been so, Ishould have been delighted
to propose a Testimonial to our common client, as a mark of our
respect, admiration, and esteem; º for instance, a full schedule of
the costs, or rather charities, we had all received from him, with the
words “8&lt art Stutm,’ engrossed neatly at its foot.
“I am, Sir, yours and MR. WINDHAM's great admirer,

LESION OF THE LUNGS OF LONDON.
Axothek wound, alas! is about to be inflicted on the lungs of
London. The right lung, as we may call Kensington Gardens, is
doomed to be traversed by an incision extending from Bayswater to
Kensington Gore. This cut, which is meant to connect those parts,
will go deep into the substance of the lung, in order that communi.
cation may be established below the surface, thus producing less dis-
figurement than what would attend a section barely superficial.
The necessity for opening this artificial channel in one of our most
vital regions, is created by the Great Exhibition, which represents those
#. material interests whereunto an enlightened taste has
ecided that in future we must sacrifice every other consideration.
Still trees, buds, blossoms, greensward, have their charms, inferior
as these may be considered to the poetry of furniture, and other manu-
factures of a rich and magnificent ki Trees, moreover, and other
natural #. serve purposes of some utility, as well as the various
articles of luxury and convenience which are made out of them. They
have certain spiritual uses which minister to mental wants; turf
spangled with daisies and buttercups, for instance, and shrubs in bloom,
will shed on the soul of any one who has such a thing, an influence
which is not exactly the same as that exhaled by a Kidderminster
carpet, or by a wreath of artificial roses, albeit inside a bonnet, or even
by any but the very rarest of faces inside of the wreath.
These things considered, it seems very desirable that, as soon as the
approaching
made through Kensington Gardens should be closed immediately, and
healed with all possible despatch.
Bayswater, however, wants a short cut to Kensington, and Kensing-
ton to Bayswater. But the cut need not be made through either of
the intermediate lungs of London. It might go beneath them so as to
avoid the lungs. A tunnel would answer the purposes of unsightly
traffic, and suit the convenience of persons who would have any prospect,
not their own private property, destroyed, rather than consent to go a
few yards out of their way.

MONEY ARTICLE ON AMERICA.
In the Yankee House of Representatives, the other day, MR. WAL-
LANDINGHAM introduced and carried a resolution requesting the Secretary
ºf the Treasury to furnish the sum total of the floating, debt of the
United States, giving, as far as practicable, the heads under which the
said debt may be arranged. The heads under which the United States
debt, whether floating or foundering, may be most correctly arranged,
are, one would think, loggerheads, which by going to with the South
the North has incurred ; necessity of borrowing ...i The floating
debt of the United States may be said to be represented by promises to
pay in the shape of banknotes, specie payments having been suspended.
As the old song says, “Aguinea will sink, but a note it will float.” The
creditor of the United States might add, with a slight variation of the
next line, “So I’d rather have a dollar than a...one pound note,” or, a
note for the equivalent of a pound in dollars. The United, States debt
is a floating debt, but the money which they borrowed is all sunk, to no
better purpose than the vessels in Charleston Harbour. There is, how-
ever, some ground for the assertion that, since the Government of
Washington has been reduced to fly kites, the debt of the United States
is not a floating debt but a flying debt; but this is a question which we
must leave for determination to the wit and wisdom of the Stock Ex-
change, where it will doubtless be generally remarked that the suspen-
sion of cash payments in the United States is a dolorous business
particularly for those whom it will dish out of their dollars, and above
for the Government which, having no more dollars, must come to
grief. At the same institution, probably, the hope will, however, be
expressed that, whatever heads the floating debt of the Ünited States
may have to be arranged under, the debtors, now themselves floating
upon a sea of troubles, may, notwithstanding the ill-will, which, the
have shown to this country, be enabled, after all, to keep their own heads
above water.
The Double Verdict.
WINDHAM is sane; but England must be cracked
To bear such process as hath fixed the fact.

THE BIGGEST OF BUTCHER BOYS.
The author of a new life of SHAkspeaRE, MR. S. W.
FULLOM, thinks there is no truth in the late LoRD CAMP-
RELL’s supposition that the great dramatist was employed,
during his youth, in a lawyer's office. SHAkspeaRE,
according to his latest biographer, was a butcher's ap:
prentice, and learned...what he knew of legal forms and
technicalities by attending the borough courts of Stratford-
on-Avon, and witnessing those law proceedings in which his
father was often involved. But he is far too minute and
copious in his law slang to have picked it up in that way;
and besides he shows immense knowledge of sea-slang,
military slang, and many other slangs. #. knowledge
of slang, in fººt was only part of his Hºli. of things
in general, which he either acquired by the study of every-
thing, or possessed by intuition, or else SHARspeARE
“was a medium,” and spirits, put universal information
into his head. Å. º: objection to this latter theory is
the height to which, his genius towers above the medi-
9erity. that marks the utterances of the most eminent
“mediums.”
A, hypothesis on which the extent of SHARspeARE's
legal knowledge may be as satisfactorily accounted for as
it can on any other, consists very well with the surmise,
ºr fact, that he was a butcher boy. As such he must have
been conversant with sheepskins. We have only to sup-
pose him endowed with the gift of natural clairvoyance, in
order ourselves to see clearly by what means he acquired
his familiarity with the law, and its phraseology. The
sheepskins presented themselves to his prevision in the
state of parchment, and he foresaw all the deeds which
were destined to be engrossed on them.
The clairvoyance of SHAkspeaRE may be supposed to
have enabled him to look into all manner of things, besides
the sheepskins, which he was accustomed to handle, and
thus obtain that acquaintance with human actions as well
as documentary deeds manifest in his writings. In a state
of trance or ecstacy, having his mind's eye open, and scenes
of the past, present, or future revealed before it, how
often may Mºstºn WILLIAM SHARspeARE have stood
beside a street-door in his native town, with a blue frock
on, and a wooden tray containing a leg of-mutton upon his
shoulder, abstractedly whistling an old English melody,
and shouting “Butcher /*

I Ain'T THE
CAN'T MAKE
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
1862. February 6. Thursday. Parliament re-assembled. The first
paragraphs in the Royal Speech (delivered by the CHANCELLOR) and
such portion of the debates as referred to them, demand graver record
than is usually made in these columns. The opening sentences of the
Speech alluded, with but little grace of expression, to the event of
the Fourteenth of December last. Leading speakers in the two Houses
offered tributes to the memory of the departed.
The EARL OF DERBY said—
“In the PRINCE Consort the QUEEN has lost the familiar friend, the trusted
counsellor, the never-failing adviser to whom she could look * in every difficulty
and in every emergency, and to whom she did look up with that lºº humility
which none but a woman's heart can know, glorying in the intellectual superiority
of him to whom her own will and her own judgment were freely put in subjection.”
EARL GRAN VILLE said:—
“I can remember no one in any class of life who seemed so fully alive to keep
before him the highest standard of duty. His intellectual faculties and his powers
of conversation were remarkable. But though a man of strong will, conception,
and character, he never obtruded his sentiments, nor sought to apply any objection
he might entertain unless desired to do so.”
EARL Russell said:—
"I happen to know from himself the views which he entertained upon the duty
of the Soverei He stated to me not many months ago that it was the common
opinion that there was only one occasion upon which the Sovereign ought to exer-
cise a decided power, and that was in the choice of the First Minister of the Crown,
that, in his opinion, was no occasion upon which the Sovereign ought to exercise a
control or to pronounce a decision. One party having resigned power from being
unable to carry on the Government, there was at all times another party to whom
the transfer of power might judiciously be made, and the transfer having once been
made, no matter to what political party the Minister happened to belong, the Sove-
ºn wº bound to communicate with him in the most confidential and unrestricted
Inanner."
MR. DISRAELI said:—
“The Prince whom we have lost not only was eminent for the fulfilment of his
duty, but it was the fulfilment of the highest duty; and it was the fulfilment of
the highest duty under the most difficult circumstances. Yet, under these circum-
stances, so difficult and so delicate, he elevated even the Throne by the dignity and
purity of his domestic life. He framed, and partly accomplished, a scheme of edu-
cation for the heir of England which º. how completely its august protector
had contemplated the office of an English king. He observed that there was a great
deficiency in our national character, and which, if neglected, might lead to the im-
pairing not only of our social happiness, but even the sources of our public wealth,
and that was a deficiency of culture. But he was not satisfied in detecting the -
deficiency, he resolved to supply it. . Those who move must change, and those who
change must necessarily disturb and alarm prejudices; and what he encountered
was only a demonstration that he was a man superior to his age. PRINCE ALBERT
was not a patron. He was not one of those who, by their smiles and by their gold,
reward excellence or stimulate exertion. His contributions to the cause of pro-
gress and improvement were far more powerful and far more precious. He gave to
it his thought, his time, his toil; he gave to it his life."
LoRD PALMERSTON said:—
“The Right Hon. gentleman, with an eloquence and a feeling which, I am sure,
must excite the sympathy and admiration of those who have heard it, dilated on the
eminent qualities of his late Royal Highness. It is no exaggeration to say that, so
far as the word “perfect' can be applied to human imperfection of character, the
PRINCE deserved the description, because he combined qualities the most eminent,
and sometimes the most different, in a degree which was hardly ever equalled by
anybody in any condition of life. In domestic life he was most exemplary. It is
no exaggeration to say, that the domestic life of the Court has been of the greatest
value to the interests of the country, has, in times of difficulty, tended to cement
the link which unites the people to the Throne, and has rendered the most impor-
tant services to the country. Such being the Pºnce whom we have lost, we can
easily imagine what must be the grief and the sorrow to her who has lost him."
The evening was one of funereal oration rather than of debate—the
exceptions are mentioned hereafter. The Addresses were unanimously
voted, and the Houses adjourned early.
LoRD WESTBURY informed us,
That we are at peace with all European powers and “trust” to
remain in that pacific condition.
That we have had a “question” between us and the United States,
which has been satisfactorily settled by the restoration of the seized
men and the disavowal of the “act of violence.”

[FEBRUARY 15, 1862.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
That the conduct of our North American colonists on this occasion
had been admirable.
That we have entered into a convention with France and Spain for
regulating a combined operation on the coast of Mexico, in order to
obtain redress for wrongs upon foreigners in that country.
That the Chinese are behaving very well, and do not want so much
looking after as heretofore.
That we have, by a convention, helped the SULTAN of MoRocco to
pay his debt to Spain, and so avoid more fighting with the Isabellicose
Spaniards.
That the Estimates, &c. &c. &c.
That some Law reforms will be introduced, especially one for re-
forming that which the wise call Conveyancing, though SHAKSPEARE
mentions a shorter name for it.
That, despite local distress from temporary causes, the general con
dition of the country is “sound and satisfactory.”
Briefer speech was never spoken, and it is only to be hoped—cer.
tainly not to be believed that such brevity will be the characteristic
of the speeches which will flavour the next six months with the odour
of essence of Parliament. -
LoRD DUFFERIN, an Irish lord and a Florentine, moved the Address
in the Lords, and it was seconded by LoRD SHELBURNE, son of the
venerable MARQUIs of LANs Dow NE. Then came LoRD Denny, who
promised to give the warmest and most brotherly support to the Go-
vernment, if they would behave properly, themselves, and discourage
other people who might be inclined to agitate subjects of controversy,
a promise for which ific gratitude of certain ultra-reformers may not be
inconveniently demonstrative and enthusiastic. He was §.
satisfied with what the Government had done in the American business,
but begged that there might be no nonsense imputed to him—he re-
garded the American submission as having been made in the most
grudging and tardy fashion, and simply because the Yankees knew
that if i. showed fight, they would have been blown out of the water,
He did not think the time had yet come for recognising the South, and
that Government must be wary, and be quite assured that the South
was strong enough to hold its own before they recognised it. He was
much pleased with M. THOUVENEL, and indeed with Europe generally
in connection with this affair. As there was no saying what might be
going to happen, he begged the Government to stick to our belligerent
rights, and not be drawn into any negotiations, which might limit
them. As to Mexico and Morocco he made no doubt that all was right,
but he should like to have a fight on some of the Education Minutes
if Lord GRAN VILLE would say where his money was to be heard of
and when his training would be over. Lord GRANVILLE in the cheer.
fulest manner fixed that mill for the following Thursday, as did M.R.
Rob ERT Low E in another place. EARL RUssell, did not speak very
complimentarily of the American blockade, but thought we must con-
tinue to try to respect it, as a few months would show whether the
North could really re-construct the Union, and it was better that they
should tire themselves out than be interfered with. LoRD KINGSDown
(a learned, calm old lawyer of the highest º thought our flag had
been grossly insulted, and that the reparation had been insufficient, and
so the evening ended.
In the Commons LoRD, PALMERSTON was loudly cheered on entering.
MR. Cox of Finsbury took the place of THOMAs DUN.com(BE, and Mit.
Mºros MILNES gave notice of renewing the Wife's Sister Marriage
attle.
MR. PortMAN and MR. WESTERN Wood moved and seconded the
Address, and MR. DISRAELI delivered an elaborate and eloquent
oration, upon certain scholarly turns whereof Mr. Punch, in the
interest of literature, bestows plaudit, the rather that such elegancies
are little studied in these days of universal spoutation. He did not
exactly follow, LorºD DERBy’s lead in regard to the American matter,
but thought that the Lincoln Government had been suddenly called to
meet great domestic difficulties, and had met them manfully, and that
we ought to extend a generous interpretation to what they might say.
There were no immediate means of deciding at what time the inter-
necine contest should terminate, but “the instinct of the human heart,
which shrinks from unnecessary carnage, was stronger than the law of
nations.” . This was a felicitous reference to the º: of the Gushing
Judge in America who justified WILKEs’s piracy by the instincts of the
human heart. The Ex-ChancELLOR of Exchequer wished to know
whether our convention with Morocco meant guaranteeing the interest
on her debt, as if so, we might look out for awkwardnesses. LoRD
PALMERSTON declared that strict neutrality was still to be our rule as
regarded America, made an uncommonly neatly guarded reference to
the future of Mexico, did not think we were in any pecuniary danger
from the Morocco arrangement, and added that we had our own good
reasons for keeping Morocco independent. MR. HADFIELD abused the
Press for having exacerbated the public mind in regard to America,
and wished that the inflammatory papers “could be burned by the
Common Hangman,” which declaration shows that the Dissenting body,
so ably represented by the Member for Sheffield, is coming round to the
old and wholesome system of repressive government. We do not despair
of hearing MR. FIELD move for the cutting off somebody's ears;
ºn attendant, he must be satisfied with cutting off his own aitches.
Ireland lost no time, and the Session began with a row, originated by
MR, MAGUIRE, who let fly at SLR Robert PEEL, upon the subject of
Irish distress, and it is needless to say, received already one-two from
that prompt #. He denied MR. MAGUIRE's facts, and also told
him that the Irish people were much altered, and had grown too wise
to be duped by folks who tried to set, them against their landlords.
MR. VINCENT SCULLY-well, we really don’t know what he said, for it
was just a quarter to eight, and Mr. Punch went off to the Haymarket,
§§ to anything of Scully's the wiser utterances of the LoRD
UNDREARY.
Friday. LoRD REDESDALE introduced a Bill for the Protection of
Public Gardens and Squares. When Mr. Punch shall have seen it, he
will know what it is about, meantime he presumes it origi in the
complaints of the gardeners that the women's Crinoline cuts the flowers
and shrubs to pieces. LoRD RUssell entered into an inaudible expla-
nation of the case of a Canadian subject, MR. SHEPPARD, who had been
arrested by MR. SEWARD, and had been required to take the oath of
allegiance to KING LINcolN. . There appear to have been reasons for
thinking that this gentle shepherd had been piping a Southern tune,
but INAUDIBLE John’s own º was so feeble that the case can hardly
be said to be before Mr. Punch. -
Citizen Edwin JAMEs may be interested in knowing that a writ (nay,
don't let him be nervous, he is quite out of the way of such things) was
issued for Great Grimsby, as a gentleman whom he may recollect, an
aristocrat called LoRD Wors LEY, has gone up to the Lords as EARL
of YARBOROUGH. By the way, it is not correct to state that MR.
EDw1N expects to be President aſter M.R. LIN colN. The Constitution
of the States demands a born American for that office. To be sure, the
Constitution may be altered in favour of our distinguished countryman,
and he may be proclaimed as JAMES THE FIRST, and in that event, may
also be his own Guy Fawkes. He certainly blew himself out of our
Parliament.
MR. GREGORY adverted to the so-called American Blockade, and
declared that he should be able to prove that it was little more than a
#. blockade. He announced his intention of inviting the House to
sten to his arguments, and of , calling on the Government to say
whether they considered that blockade effective or not. MR. BENTINck
followed up the matter by observing that unless the blockade were a
real one, our recognising it was a violation of our declared neutrality,
for we were favouring the North. Mr. Punch considers that there is a
sort of silver-paper blockade, made of the material through which
uestrians jump at Astley’s... It looks very dense, but a plucky leap
takes you clean through it, MR. GREGORY is quite right in demanding
attention to the question, but he will beat GREGoRIUs THAUMATURGU's
if he performs the miracle of getting a definition out of PAM—just yet.
MR. HADFIELD, who wants the Common Hangman for the journalist,
clamours against the use of the rod on the young thief, and proposes a
Bill for doing away with whipping. SIR GEORGE GREY “believes
there are instances in which whipping may be advantageously practised.”
Mr. Punch foresees divers occasions, during the Session, of showing
that he is of SIR GEORGE's opinion.

--E-F-T, HE Paris correspondent of the

roper interest in the affairs of the

“MADAME Fould will come out in
unparalleled magnificence in one ball
in which she means to concentrate aii
her efforts, as it will be the only one
given in the Hotel Fould this season,
where there will neither be public
reunions nor receptions. This is not
very well received by the Parisians,
They ascribe it to the English habits of
MADAME Fould, who, according to
them, think that the whole entertain-
ment lies in the richness of the eatables
provided for the guests. Whatever
epicurean tendencies may be displayed
at déjeuners and dinners by the natives
over here, they care very little about
suppers, and would enjoy more a brisk
conversation in the evening than the finest
viands that the most accomplished cook is
capable of providing.”

“COURT OF EXCBEQUER, FEB. 1.

“HALDANE AND ANOTHER v. SIR. E. LANDSEER.
“The plaintiffs are tailors, carrying on business at 29, Old Bond Street, and
sought to recover from the defendant, Sir Edwin LANdsEER, the celebrated artist,
the sum of £10 18s., the prices of a surtout coat and dress cºat supplied to him.

“The coats being in court, Sir Edwin was asked to put them on, which he
readily assented to do. -
“One of the jurymen, being a tailor, was requested to go round to the witness-
box and examine the coats on the defendant's back. A very short examination
seemed to satisfy him.
“His Lordship summed § saying that there was an obligation upon a trades-
man charging, as the plaintiffs appeared to have done, a full west-end price, to
supply a suitable article. The coat ought to be a properly fitting coat, and the
uestion for the jury was, under all the circumstances, whether the plaintiffs had
lººd that obligation. They had seen the coats on, and could judge for them-
seives.
“The jury found a verdict for the defendant.”
SAY shall a sleeve-board’s scion dare deſy
Our man of men—our own R.A., SIRTDw1N ?
Shall one, no kin to things that run §. -
(Save the ignoble goose, that doth his bread win)—
Assail the lord of feather and of fur,

Shall shrimper a cock-salmon in his net lock P
No! In the name of Impudence and Dignity/
Nor scales nor sword for this let Justice draw:

Its hope from MARTIN's Laying down the Law.
SIR. EDw1N being human must wear clothes.
Were he but bird or beast—in fur or feather!
Presto! the pencil flies, the colour flows
And lo! a coat defying time and weather,
From his own magic hand. Then, what a fit !
Then, to what velvet gloss the nap had grown |
Nowhere a crease to show the uneasy sit
Fine-drawn all over, yet no botching shown.
Alas! He'll clothe our horses and our lap-dogs;
ake fur-coats for our “Monarchs of the Glen;
In wiry Highland dread-nought he’ll enwrap dogs,

Terriers and collies—but he won't dress men,
Not e'en himself, so must to th’ tailor drop :
Stand to be measured §: like you or me:
Hear girth, and length, bawled out to all the shop :
Stoop to the yoke of tape both neck and knee.
Methinks when such an artist deigns to give
His limbs, dear to the Muses and A fi.
o!here sartorial hands, those hands should live
With skill unwonted: suits sublime should follow.
Each .# set to the job, from ninth of man
Should grow nine men, and each man good as nine,
In honour of the Muses, bent to scan
His clothes, loved of that sisterhood divine.
But no such inspiration—woe is me!—
Flowed from the Muse on HALDANE or his Co.
SIR EDw1N's coats were horrible to see,
If he could stand in them, he could not go.
Beneath the arms they fretted his axillae:
Behind the neck they chafed his cerebellum,
Buttoned;—as in a vice squeezed his mamille;
Unbuttoned;—dangled limp as rain-soaked wellum.
Siº EDWIN groaned; they laughed his plaints to scorn:
The coats returned, they sent them, altered, back:
Wºrse waxed the fit, each time the coats were worn;
More slack what tight should be, more tight, what slack.
Tº said, the faults he found in fit and cut,
Were not faults of the coat, but him that wore:
Bade change his postures, nor their garments put
To tests coats never were put to before.
What may these postures be? (he asks that sings)
Is’t that SIR EDw1N in his lonelier hours,
Goes,on all fours, flies, perches, squats, or springs,
Like the dumb things, that take life from his powers?
Strains he his coat-sleeves, eagle-like for flight
Śrī; his vans? cracks his continuations
By bounding stag-like down the heathery height?
Or bursts his buttons in hare's-breadth saltations?
Or is it º playfulness begets
Strange feats and bids him through an empty frame
Take headers à la Boucicault, or sets
The cumbrous easel, and o'ervaults the same?
Oris’t such inspiration doth o'erbear
His body, as the Pythoness bade speak:
To Delphic tripod turns his painting-chair,
And plants him in the middle of next week?
These things I know not—ne'er perchance shall know,
Wherefore SIR. Edwin doth to antics fall;
Or what his antics are when he doth so:
Or whether he, in truth, doth so at all.
HALDANE avouched it. But my faith is small
In him or in his Co.: our fathers' plan
Required two witnesses for proof, and lo,
hese two but make up two-ninths of a man.
And what is the ear’s witness to the eye's 2
But here the eye was ready; for behold,
Among the jury that the issue tries,
A Tailor in the panel, brisk and bold!
“Try on the coat!”, sudden the expert cried—
-- §. the coat!'” echoed his brethren all.
Stern MARTIN bowed approval: on ’twas tried:
And stood misfit confessed, here large, here small—
“Who buys a coat,” summed up the awful judge,
“Buyeth a fit, or buys what none may wear.’
The tailor juryman approving nudge
Gave, at the words, to ribs of foreman near.
“Is this a fit?—for a reply I pause—
Be there that think so let them say so now,
Or henceforth, ever after, hold their jaws.
Now, speak?” “None !” said the foreman, with a bow.
“Ye find for the defendant?” and º
The foreman bowed, and gleamed the twinkling eye
Of that sly tailor.juryman, as fain
To prick this rival sartor on the sly.
“Verdict for the defendant—so you say,
And so say all of * !” and so they said—

And home SIR Edwin took his laurelled head |

THE BALL.
HARRY BULLFINCHER, who Is EveR so MUCH BETTER ACRoss Country Than when HE MIXES IN THE MERRY DANCE, (ESPECIALLY AFTER
SUPPER) HAs come To GRIEF ovKR A stool, DURING A Polka, AND Is shouTING For some oNE To “CATch His HoRSE /"
COMFORTABLE CONCERTS.
CLAPPING, with both hands and stamping with both feet, Punch
applauds with all his might the very .. suggestion which is put
forth in the programmes of the Monday Popular Concerts, and which
every concert audience would do wisely to attend to:—
“NOTICE.-It is respectfully suggested that such persons as are not desirous of
remaining till the end of the performance can leave either before the commencement of
the last instrumental piece, or between any two of the movements, so that those who wish
to hear the wholemay do so without interruption.”
Punch so often has been plagued at a musical performance by people
entering, or leaving, in the middle of a piece, that he is charmed to see
this notice taken of the nuisance, and he trusts ere long to find the rule
most rigidly enforced. . There really is a call for legislation, in the
matter, if the law be insufficient to protect the British public from
offenders of this sort. A creaky-booted brute who stumps out of a
concert-room while music is º robs, those whom he disturbs
of aº: they have paid for, and should by rights be handed, as a
thief, to the police. Such a Gorilla is a monster whom it were gross
flattery to call a selfish beast; and Punch cries bravo! to all champions
who fight against these monsters, and lend a helping hand to make
their race extinet.
In other points, the programmes of the Monday Popular Concerts
are models that all º: would do well to profit by, and fairl
are entitled to the praise of Punch. The music is well chosen, well
varied, well performed; and there is no time wasted (as the case is far
too commonly) } pieces merely introduced to lengthen out the Con-
cert, and attract those who like quantity in the lieu of quality, being
of the latter barely competent to judge. Two hours and a is the
limit which is rigidly adhered to at these Concerts, and a feast of this
duration is as much as minds in general are able to digest... Better
send away an audience somewhat hungering for more, than stuffed with
such a surfeit as may end in sheer disgust.
Chamber music may not seldom be called “Bed Chamber music,”
from its power, when ill played, to send listeners to sleep. But there
is no fear of this consequence at º of these Concerts, for the pro-
º is too short for people to be wearied, and the pieces are so
riskly and so cleverly performed that no one ever feels the least
somniferous effect. The night Punch last attended he saw scores
among the audience sitting with the scores of the music in their hands,
and following the leader all through the performance in a way which
showed them thoroughly awake to all the beauties of the pieces that
were played. In fact, regarded merely as a means of education, such
Concerts should be patronised by fathers of a family; for young ladies
by attending them may cultivate their taste, and learn that there is
better work for a piano than the thumping out of polkas and the
jingling of quadrilles. To hear HALLé, play BEETHoveN is a lesson a
.."; pianist can hardly fail to profit by ; and while such music may
e heard at them, and there is such care to the comfort of the people
who attend them, these Concerts will continue to deserve to be as
º as it was doubtless hoped they would be when they were so
Imained.
Art Treasures of Guildhall.
. As touching the Exhibition of 1862 a city paper, suggests “con-
jectures of what the City of London will do—how it will comport itself;
in what way, it will utter an opinion, develope a fact, or institute an
i.". he º London will probably develope a fact, or rather
two facts, and at the same time utter an opinion, and institute an
example into the bargain. It will disengage those great facts. Gog and
Magog from the obscurity of Guildhall; it will express the opinion that

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WERY JUST OBSERVATION.
ADFIELD (MR.), M.P.
for Sheffield, says that,
being a Dissenter, of
course he does not hap-
prove the vindictive-
ness of the Yankees in
spoiling the Arbours,
but that it does not so
much matter, as in this
weather the ple
can’t want to take tea
in them.
European Cards.
The EMPEROR OF
THE FRENCH has been
considered a dubious
card; but in the game
which we have just had
to play with the Yan:
kees he has proved
himself a trump.
The Pope is a downy
old hand at cards. His
Holiness says that he
awaits events; he
wants to see what will
turn up; he will not
deal, but he is ready
to shuffle.
ANTONELLI is sup-
sed to be at work, digging pitfalls. He may be regarded as the
nave of Spades.
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, -
“IN this uncertain climate of ours which may freeze or thaw
us at scarce an hour's notice, which may cause us to throw open our
windows on Twelfth Night, and kindle, our fires in July, we require
other signs than the weather to remind us of the time of year. At
Christmas, for instance, the appearance of mince-pies at dinner or my
tailor's little bill at breakfast, is a pretty certain indicator of the
festive season. When I am asked by little boys in the street to
“remember the grotto” (which by the way 1 have ascertained to be a
base imposition consisting of a heap of oyster-shells and a lighted end
of tallow º º; I Fº warmly that the grotto may be—
consigned to oblivion. But if I do not remember the grotto, I am at
least reminded of the month. -
“And thus, parvis componere magna, when I read PAM's circular to
his young friends expressing a hope that they would be ready to
re-assemble with punctuality at St. Stephen's academy, Westminster,
I knew that February was at hand, and straightway prepared in the
most constitutional manner, to see the opening of Parliament.
“You see I had been supping at EVANs's on the previous night, and | doo
as a snug little berth near the *Fields
cultivated taste for
his “den,’ ostensibly
my friend SLOPER, who
Amelioration Society,” and possesses a highl
bitter ale, had invited me down to what he cal
for the§ of seeing the procession, but chiefly, I take it, with an
eye to devilled kidneys (in the preparation of which light and whole-
some food his laundress certainly excels) and the contemplation after
lunch, of those fair subjects of HER MAJESTY who rush on these occa-
sions to º their respects in every charming variety of bonnet, boot,
and mantle.
“Palace Yard at first sight is not, I admit, a very fascinating place.
If Henry the Seventh’s Chapel is invested with historic interest, it is,
also enshrouded by a thick coat of London blacks. Looking opposite
at the Houses of Parliament, the ‘pillars of Gothic .# appear
very ºlº. indeed, and the vista down Abingdon Street is not
cheerful. metimes, indeed, a Westminster boy may be seen saun-
tering towards his Alma Mater, or an inebriated barget emerges from
“The Chequers,” otherwise, I say, the scene is generally dull. But
to-day (February 6th), what a change!, far as the eye can reach (which
to say the truth, is only a moderate distance), Aï', bustle and ani-
mation; heaps of yellow sand lie at intervals along the road (flavus
arend’—ahem' Virgil), ready to be scattered at the first approach of
pageantry. Spruce and solemn white-gloyed crushers line the pavements
while their gallant chief gallops to and fro with great ". and appa-
rently unnecessary zeal. Carriages begin to arrive and their contents
to be deposited. Good gracious, can they really be Peeresses tripping
up those steps ? Oh, for SIR EDMUND BURKE to tell us Who is §
among that gentle crowd Here is an angel in Mauve, and there a
Sable syren. Peeresses pºh !” says SLOPER, who goes by
way of knowing the haut ton; ‘That’s MRs. – and Miss –," and
here he mentioned two names which I must decline to repeat, but
which I can never, no never forget, so long as I remain a bachelor.
“Under the Victoria Tower there is an iron gate on either side of
which, and high above the pavement, are posted two heraldic lions, the
expression on their countenances being such as one might suppose
would result from the combined effects of an emetic and a surprise.
Under the arch and to the left hand we see a carpet being spread for
dainty, footsteps. This excites great interest, and presently sundry
old ladies under the impression, I suppose, that something is on the
tapis, rush and peep through the gate.

recesses of the portal, issue Yeomen in single ſile, rich in scarlet and
gold, and wearing the low-crowned beaver “of the period.” “Who’s
your hatter?” cry a dozen little urchins, in an ecstacy of satire, and
even A 29 cannot repress a smile as he looks at that wondrous head.
gear decked with a garland of artificial flowers"—a perfect filet de lauf
—beef-eater I mean. Anon we hear the sound of martial music, and the
Foot, Guards, march upon, the scene. Their advent is hailed by the
street-boys who immediately volunteer their services to hold the music-
books and thenceforth consider themselves part of the Show.
“Carri now roll in from all directions. White-wigged coach-
men, pink-legged flunkeys, gorgeous hammer-cloths appear and vanish
in rapid succession. Whose equipage is that which is so loudly
cheered? It is not more gorgeous than a dozen others which have
passed. Surely the Turkish Ambassador's, and the mob are amused at
the scarlet ‘fez’ (the only oriental element in the whole turn out)
which surmounts JoHN's honest English face as he holds on behind.
If he had been disguised as a Pasha, I could have sworn he was a
Saxon. He a Mussulman, indeed! Tºš wish you could have seen
him at ‘The Chequers!'
“Meanwhile the wind has been scattering dust in the eyes of HER
MAJESTY's loyal subjects who look anxiously up at the Clock Tower.
Five minutes F. two, and the policemen throw open the gates. ‘Here
they are l’at last we say, as a dozen swell carriages roll up. “The first

from which two pages descend, for all the world like Princes in a

and I fall aspeculating which of these young gentlemen excels at foot-
ball, and whether either has a weakness for tartlets in private life.
“Another carriage, and another, and at last—
“You have heard it described a dozen times. Eight cream-coloured
horses, tastefully caparisoned, indeed, but drawing oh!, such a coach.
Who built it? who designed it? (why isn't there a ‘What's What?’, as

trees and dyspeptic lictors come from? It is surely of the Georgian
era, and should be preserved with other specimens of that glorious

BUTTERFLIES PINNED DOWN.
OUR gay contemporary, Le Follet, is coming out in a new and rising character.
No longer the simply stolid chronicler and implicit adorer of the fashions that be,
it has now become i. discerning censor, and pungent if not crushing satirist.
Witness the remark ensuing, under the head of Fashions for February:-
“The more abrial a ball-dress is, the greater the elegance of the effect.”
Keen, but delicate, irony. A common critic would have said, in plain coarse
words: “The more like a balloon a ball-dress now is, the more it is admired by
every fool in the room.” . But a meat poke with a parasol tells better on inanity
than a blow with a sledge-hammer,
In the same caustic but lightsome vein of banter our humourist continues:–
“A drawback, however, to these clouds of lace and tulle is that, although the ruches,
bouillonnés, and flounces look so fairy-like at the commencement of the evening, before it is
finished the skirt appears chiffonnée and ragged.”
Authors are often praised for the excellence of their word-painting. Great
merit in that line must be conceded to the writer of the foregoing passage. It is
admirable ºff To the mind's eye, in a few strokes, so to speak, it
Present quite a vivid, illustration of social life amongst the sumptuous classes.
The delineation is twofold. On the one side we admire “the ruches, bouillonnés
and flounces,” which “look so fairy-like at the commencement of the evening.”
On the other, we smile at “the skirt” as it has come to º: before the evening
is finished, “chiffonnée and ragged.” All that imagination has to supply is the thing
inside of the ruches, bouillonnés, flounces, and skirt; a fleshy young woman of
elegant contour, practised in her attitudes, with a full, smooth face, a small fore-
head, and large ox-eyes brilliant with animal spirits, and nothing else except the
conceit of looking pretty, at the beginning of the evening, but dull towards four
o'clock in the morning; the rest of the features likewise clouded with fatigue and
somewhat of vexation. This is what is called the belle of the ball-room, whom
“swells” survey through eye-glasses, and want to dance with, or even to marry,
regardless of expense, and not considering what she will turn into at forty.
7. Foliet has a still further poke at the prevalent absurdities of costume. It
observes that:—
“The question of discontinuing Crinolines has been much discussed; but when we mention
that the skirts of dresses are five yards wide, and that to steel cages two or three petticoats
are added, it will be perceived that there is no very great change as
to circumference.”
It will indeed. Comment is needless., When we, men.
tion that skirts of dresses are five yards wide, and that
two or three petticoats are added to steel cages, the cages
enclosing the lower halves of females considered to be
highly fashionably attired—what can we say more about
such an intolerable deal of clothes? Nothing that can
find a place in pages, which exclude strong language;
substantives and adjectives of which the utterance would
occasion syncope, and participles that ought never to be
pronounced under five shillings.
SPARE THE WOODS AND FORESTS.
(by SMELFUNGUs.)
PRESERVE the trees, do, if you please,
By any means you can
For they are dear as beef and beer
To every Englishman.
The woodman's stroke too many an oak
And elm is laying low;
And woe the day when the rest decay,
And all the forests go!
There dwells no joy where churls destroy
The timber off the land,
Where the merry #. for ages stood,
And groves of chimneys stand.
But where's the fun in your woods? says one
Of Folly's mocking brood.
Thou ºrt right, fool, very; it was the merry,
And not the comic greenwood.
Then every lover of copse and cover,
The noble and the clown,
Lamenting sees, with falling trees,
Wild creatures hunted down.
The buzzard and kite have passed from sight,
Though yet on memory graven
There's hardly a hawk, and old folks talk
Of having seen a raven.
The pleasant scene of the village green,
In building-lots disposed,
We sorely rue; and the commons, too,
Are getting all enclosed.
And mansions old, on all sides sold,
Are raised, and stuccoed villas
Usurp their place; as though our race
Were sinking to Gorillas.
Our fields and downs o'er part when towns,
The rest town sewage, spread
Once fresh with flowers this land of ours
Will be a close hotbed:
Wherein I trust to have left my dust,
This land, all smoke and smother,
Full fain to quit; and to live in fit
The world has not another.
But can’t we check the ruin and wreck
Of all old English beauty,
Though traffic and trade so much invade,
Strip bare, and turn all sooty?
Oh, cease to spoil your native soil
At Mammon's mere persuasion,
And hold the earth that gave you birth
Against that fiend's invasion.

WE fancy the Irish Members mean ſighting, this Session.
It looks very much as though they had decidedly made up
#. minds, at the very earliest opportunity, to go into

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
PUNCH, - The Pantomime
at the Princess's is the best
that I have seen this sea-
son; but as I have at pre-
sent only seen two others,
my opinion can be hardly
thoughtexuberantimpraise.
That at Covent Garden has
not fun enough to please
me, although (cruel, as it
sounds) I own it always
ives me..pleasure to see
º Nor is Miss Muffet
at the Haymarket vastly
entertaining, though Miss
Louise LEGLºndº is a
most lively little heroine,
and skips about sobriskly
that it needs, the longest-
legged of daddies-long-legs
to catch hold of her, I cry
out Plaudite / moreover
because this pantomime is
written more for children
than are most, and does not
puzzle their young brains
with politics or puns, which
they are not ma . enough
as yet to comprehend. . .
“Pums fall thick as hail in the opening of Dick Whiºngº, which
savours less of pantomime to my mind than burlesque. This I think ls
a mistake, as they are each good in their way and better kept distinct.
Pims in a burlesque are permissible enough, although it is too much the
fashion now to stuff one's ears with them, and make the glut of them
alone for any lack of pains in working up the story which is taken for
a plot. But smart writing in a pantomime to me seems out ºf place, I
prefer a good hot poker to the pungentest of puns, because I think the
poker is most proper to the piece. Pantomime, says Johnson, is ‘a
tale exhibited only in gesture and dumb-show; só its actors should be
funny in their actions, not in words, and win, laughter not by punning
but by gesture and grímace. The lover should make love not with his
lungs but with his legs: and the maiden (afterwards Columbine), should
º: a dumb belle, and trust to ‘speaking glances tº say
what she would wish. King John was the last pantomime I saw º:
of this sort: and they who recollect it must remember how they laughed
at it." To see the kin º by the nose out of his own carpet-bag,
wherein he had ºi imself all except his nose: and to see the
haughty Barons unbosoming themselves by unbuttoning their coats,
and displaying words of terror in big letters on their breasts: such
º and are far more likely to live long as
scenes were proper -
an any quantity of word-torture by means of
pleasant memories t
painful puns. - -- --
“However, notwithstanding the drawback of its dialogue, the panto-
mime at the Princess's is really quite worth seeing, and contains a
good deal that is fairly worth a laugh. There is no hot º but there
as a º in it: though this is treated by the Clown with far more gentle
usage than babies in a pantomime in general receive. It is dropped
and sat upon as usual, it is true; but it does not get its head º:
on the stage to stop its crying, nor is it pitched up in the air, or pºked
into Clown's pocket, or torn inhalves between him, and a member of the 1
police. The transformation scene is pretty, and not tedious; and,
therefore, more commendable than many far more, gorgeous, but which
are tiresome in their gradual, slow, bit-by-bit development. Moreover,
in the harlequinade there are no advertisements, and this is also highly
praiseworthy, and commands my warmest thanks. Business matters
surely have no business in a pantomime, and the only fun they offer is
in the queer mixtures that sometimes they present; as in the Great Puff
and Poster Scene at Covent. Garden, which represents, New Bond
Street as a º of Ludgate Hill. The ballet girls at the Princess's are
the best-drilled, corps in London, else, perhaps I might complain that
the pantomime has somewhat of a surplusage of dancing, and it is this
which makes it just a whit too long. I am bound to add, however,
that the coming of the last scene, took me by surprise: and the trick
which just preceded it—a Turkish bath turned to a snow-storm–was
so smartly worked a change that I felt half a wish for more. By the
way the Turkish baths have scarce been made the most of. I expected
to see Clowns dressed up as Turkish cooks, and stewing downstout people
to mere skeletons and scarecrows, adding, after semi-boiling, the torture
of shampoo.
“Mr. Boucicault has lately issued his royal proclamation, and has
signified what pieces it will please him to perform, and for what period
* Ha! that was a pantomime!—ED.
the public will be very graciously permitted to attend them. The
Octoroon and Colleen Baton are this month to be withdrawn until next
July, to make room for a new drama, which is to run till Easter, when
a ‘ domestic fairy tale” and ‘new romantic drama” are to be produced:
and with this group of plays’ the Adelphi summer audiences are to
be content. Perhaps to some old-fashioned play-goers it may smack
somewhat of coolness thus to fix a limit, to the run of a new F.
without noticing the chances that it may be ill received. But it should
be remembered that these plays though new in England have been
acted in America, and so their º has fair ground on which to base
his estimate, when he puts for so confident a hint at their success.
Besides, a man who is so clever in hitting public taste is not yery
likely to make an utter miss; and if his plays should prove a failure,
he will doubtless so re-write them, urgente voce publică, that the public
will all flock to see the emendations, he will say, it has “composed’ and
which he has simply had the happiness to ‘edit.”
“ONE who Pays.”
“LET THE SWAN ALONE.”
“A Shakspean E. Cyclopedia is projected to be published in twenty parts. It
will consist of a classified summaary of Shakspeake's knowledge of the phenomena
of nature, and of his allusions to zoology, botany, mineralogy, meteorology, medi-
cine, agriculture, hunting, falconry, &c. The first part is mised in March, an
will contain “ShakspeaRE's Natural History of Man.’”
MR. PUNCH yields to no man (and to no woman, dear MRs. Cowden
CHARKE, and many thanks for your invaluable. Concordance) in the
habitual exercise of his faculty of º the Divine WILLIAMs.
A study of Mr. Punch's pages will show how intimate is his acquaint-
ance with those of the D.W., and how exquisite his gift at adapting
the sentiments of the latter to the incidents of the day. In fact, he is
the Greatest, Shakspearian who ever lived. But he has also another
faculty, which is that of detecting Humbug, and a third faculty, which
is that of exposing and castigating it. The above scheme is Humbn
—and sit in its very name. A Cyclopædia means a work in ".
the whole compass of arts and sciences is exhaustively explained. Any-
body who calls SHAKSPEARE a cyclopædie authority simply talks cant
and the DIVINE W. himself would, if he heard the donkey, rise up and
ſº “quoit him down-stairs.” Which office, in the absence of
the said D.W. Mr. Punch hereby begs to perform, in the interest of the
reputation of the Poet and of the lovers of his work. D. W. was some-
thing a good deal better than a Cyclopædist, and deserves something
#. eal better than the having his glorious name made a peg for
umbug
ONE WORD FOR HIM, TWO FOR US.
WHEN one does not like a person, one is curiously sensitive of the
wit of anybody else who pitches into our Black Beast. This profound
truth has just been illustrated by our amiable friend the Athenæum,
which º to dislike M. Du CHAILLU, of Gorilladom. A publisher
issues a slang poem, which he christens “The Gorilla Fight,” and our
contemporary is in such a hurry to applaud anything that looks like a
scoff at M. Du CHAILLU, that it gives a long quotation from the poem,
and describes it as a “droii and spirited." º: of the controversy
“recently conducted” in the columns of the Athenæum, adding other
praise which no doubt the composition deserves, seeing that it was the
work of the late Thomas Moore—an obscure author, not without his
merits. The enterprising publisher merely “borrowed” the lines, and
sold the critic, Mr. Punch refers to the matter, not from an unkind
wish to show infallibility at fault, but in self-justification, because any
iving person who can write verses like Tom MooRE's, has long ago
been one of Mr. Punch's Sacred Band, and not at the orders of a
“borrowing” publisher.
The Right of Translation is Anything but Reserved.
THE Yankees translate the Pope's polite defence of “Mon Possumus.”
into a patriotic and pathetic supplication of “Don’t Possum-us”—
meaning thereby that they don’t want the Confederates to put them
“up a gum-tree.”
THE BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR.
THERE is one star which the Yankees may add to the Stars and
Stripes. It is the Morning Star and Dial.
OST.-TWO BILLS, for the sums respectively of £249s. 6d., and

TAXATION GREAT TYRANNY.
It is not often that Mr. Punch has the happiness of agreeing with
that august body, the St. Pancras Westry. But in its last protest
against tyranny, he begs cordially to concur. The Westry cannot com-
rehend why the expense of i. new road that is to be cut across
ensington Gardens should be thrown upon London. Nor can Mr.
Punch. The road is made because provincials want to come to London
to see the May Show, and because there will be no room for them to
§ along unless a new cut is made. Then they ought, to pay for it.
We have room enough, and we could get to the Exhibition º
enough if the rustics would keep at home and mind their cows an
apple-trees. It would be thought cool for a country friend to write
to a Londoner, and beg that he will have his house enlarged, as
the countryman wants to come and stay with him. What is the differ-
ence P. However, nobody accuses Londoners of inhospitality (though
the yokels do sometimes think us “cold,” because we can’t exactly
abandon all our pursuits in order to take them to the Thames Tunnel
and Almack's,) and we'll compromise. Let London bear its share in
the general taxation for this New Cut, but let the expense
on the country at large. Mr. Punch is ashamed that the mean idea of
taxing the Metropolis for the benefit, of the provincials should have
been entertained at all, and he begs, the St. Pancras Westry to agitate
their hardest—upon this occasion only.

he walked along the line, followed by his cross and train-bearers.”
Of course after the performance of the process above described no
train will ever go off the rails on the Rome and, Naples line. If the

erhaps they have been secured from all danger of collision or bursting.

He solemnly c that rascally thief1
He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed;
From the sole of his foot, to the crown of his head;
He cursed him in sleeping, that every night,
He should dream of the devil, and wake in a fright;
He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking,
He cursed him in laughin , in sneezing, in winking:
He cursed him in sitting, #, standing, in lying,
He cursed him in walking, in riding, in flying:
He cursed him in living, he cursed him dying."
Indeed, we may go on, with the chronicler—
“Never was heard such a terrible curse :
But what gave rise
To no little surprise,
Nobody seemed one penny the worse 1"
But WEUILLOT is not satisfied with common-place cursing.
He has his own iar graces of execration-a private
commination service for his special use. Thus, after hurling
at poor ABBAE PAssaglia, such mild objurgations as “infa-
mous wretch,” “particide,” “Judas Iscariot,” he goes on to
pray that Heaven “may accumulate on him, the load of
the sins which he has committed and those which he may
have remitted;” that “his robe may become a robe of
fire,” and that Heaven “may refuse him a single tear to
temper its burning.”
Taking the matter and title of WEUILLOT's pamphlet
together, it would seem that his “ Parfum de Rome” is a
compound of the smell of roasted heretic and brimstone,
with a dash of Créme de Billingsgate. WEUILLOT would do
well to remember the Arabic proverb, that “curses, like
young chickens, always come home to roost.”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
February 10, Monday. Byway of instructing the Peers in natural his-
tory, LORD CARNARyon laid some uncommonly fine specimens of Mare's
Nests upon the table of the House, and EARL Russell a lecture
thereon. The subject was the detention of certain English subjects by
the United States Government, on suspicion that these Englishmen were
“secesshers.” LoRp Russell picked the lecture to pieces rather
satisfactorily, and though LoRD, DERby thought that the lecturer
deserved a vote of thanks, the Peers were not acclamatious. A point
was made out of the fact that one of these Englishmen had not re-
nounced his allegiance to QUEEN VICTORIA, but it turned out that he
had given the legal notices of his intention to perform that graceful
act, and he did not seem a client of whom LoRD CARNARvoN had much
cause to be proud. . LORD MALMESBURY then complimented the
Ministers on the way in which they have managed the American diffi:
§§ but was º anxious to know what was the real state of
the Blockade. LoRD RUssell was much obliged for the support he
had received from the Opposition, and replied that he could not exactly
say whether, the Blockade were real or not, but that he had ordered
every kind of information to be sent home, and wouldº produce
the results. LoRD GRAN VILLE then as politely invited the Conserva-
tive, leaders to explain whether they had intended to signify that the
Declaration of Paris, in 1856, which proclaims the inviolability of
enemy's É. in neutral ships, ought to be disregarded in case of war.
LORD MALMESBURY would not say that it *ought ” to be disregarded
when we or the French had our respective monkeys, or to speak more
heroically, our blood, Up—but he certainly thought that it Would.
LoRD GRANVILLE then announced—and the statement will be
received by the country with no satisfaction—that the promoters of the
Memorial to the late PRINCE CoNsoRT are seeking to evade the
admitted difficulty of deciding upon its character, by throwing the task
of selection upon the most Illustrious Person in the realm. This is no
time for intruding such a question in that quarter, and moreover, the
Memorial is intended-and we contribute to it because it is intend -
j national and not individual appreciation of the merits of a
departed PRINCE. A word used by #. GRANVILLE sufficiently
indicates the feeling which those who tender advice in the highest
uarter entertain upon the subject. “If the application be made, the
vereign will not ‘shrink” from giving Her views.”
SIR. GEORGE GREY announced that the Government had no intention
of trying to settle the Church.Rate question, so all parties may have a
Free Fight. The Abolition Bill has been re-introduced, and other plans
are pushed forward, and so EccLESIA and LITTLE BETHEL must have
it out on an early Wednesday. . -
Some protests were made against the Income-Tax, which was pro-
nounced detestable in itself, and doubly detestable from the way in
which it is collected. MR. GLADSTONE sweetly remarked that he be:
lieved cases of abuse were very rare, but that he should like the duty of
collecting the tax to be transferred to Government, only that this would
º: Government very unpopular. This was Homerically frank, at
all events.
MR, HANKEY moved for a Committee to inquire into the subject of
Fires in London. , Mr. Punch begs to illustrate the present state of the
case by an example which is in everybody's eye. There is, in the City,
a Cathedral, built by SIR CHRISTOFHER WREN, and dedicated to the
ApostLE St. PAUL. We are all rather proud of it. Near this Cathedral
have lately been built some huge and hideous warehouses, which hor-
ribly interfere with the architectural effect of St. Paul's. These ware-
houses also threaten the Cathedral with destruction, for if they catch
fire, as warehouses generally do, and the wind should blow from the
east or thereabouts, as it generally does, the flames will in all proba-
bility take the sacred edifice. That is not all. The proprietors of these
hideous nuisances have no doubt insured them. Fire breaks out. The
Fire-Engines belong to the Assurance Offices, and it would be the duty
of the gallant firemen to exert themselves to the utmost to save the
horrible warehouses, but it would be no part of their duty to save. St.
Paul's. Apply the same rule all over London, and recollect that if an
insured bacon shop is afire, and the National Gallery also...CLAUDE
and REMBRANDT must burn while the bacon is saved. Clearly it
is time to consider whether, we ought not to have, some National
Engines, for the protection of national property; and the Committee is
appointed.
Tuesday. A most touching Reply to the Lords' Address was delivered
No. 1076,

[FEBRUARY 22, 1862.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
in the name of the Royal Mourner. A Reply was also made to the
Address by the Commons. - -
Some costermongers recently murdered a butcher at his own door in
South Street, Manchester Square. Some “excitement,” as the penny-
a-liners say, has been caused by the apparently lenient conduct of the
magistrate before whom the ruffians were brought. But as the case is
*: tried before another tribunal, SIR GEORGE GREY, very properly
interrogated by MR, HARVEY LEwis, thought that he need enter into
no explanations. - - - -
Then did MR. WHITE endeavour to carry, a motion for appointing
one night in the week for discussions on the Estimates. These discus-
sions are very much hindered by the fact that when the QUEEN's
Government demand money, everybody has a right to insist upon some
question of his own being first disposed of... Now, Mr. Punch has not
often the happiness of agreeing with MR. WHITE, but is bound to say
that in this matter, the sense was on his side, and the talk on that of
the eminent talkers who opposed him., WALPolº, and DISRAELI, and
PALMERston all protested against altering a time-honoured system,
and MR. DISRAEL affirmed that the House had a higher duty than
legislation, namely, the duty of representing public opinion. This is true,
but public opinion decidedly is that the Estimates ought to be
well over-hauled, and this cannot be done when gentlemen who
have been hard at work, all day, and hard at talk all might, are
requested at midnight, to begin à. sums in arithmetic and scruti.
mising details of extravagances. Mr. Punch dismisses, with a kick of
the profoundest contempt, all the bunkum about terror at losing a check
upon the Crown, and thinks that it would be extremely, desirable to
examine the cheques upon the Exchequer. However the old hands had
their way, and the motion was withdrawn, the mover remarking that
MR. DiskAELI was one of those who could make White look black-and
proving his statement by looking very black at the result: -
MR. Monckton MILNEs once more introduced the Bill for ºil;
MR. Jones to marry the sister of the late MRs. Jones, if the sister an
himself desire such a union. MR. WALPoLE informed MR. MILNES
that the Bill was to be strenuously resisted. There must be a great
demand for Sisters-in-Law, as wives somewhere, but Mr. Punch's
experience has failed to show him where this demand exists. He hates
his sisters-in-law most heartily, for they always bowl him out at home
when he has been performing any little innocent eccentricities out of
doors, they are always stimulating Mrs. Punch (who needs no such
stimulus) to buy new bonnets, they always take the other front places
in the opera-box, so that he has to sit at the back, and they always
write to him for orders for the play, though, being all very rich, they
can perfectly well afford to pay. Moreover, they never seem obliged
by anything he does for them, fit take it as }. of his conjugal *i.
§. he have the misfortune to survive Mrs. Punch, he solemnly
ledges himself, for one, to make no use of MR. MILNES's law (if MR.
K. passes it) and so is quite disinterested in saying that he thinks
ople ought to be allowed to do as they like in a matter which the
#. of i. Spiritual and Temporal, has solemnly declared to be
no question of principle.
Wednesday. The Commons sat º half an hour, the theological
bills not being sufficiently forward to furnish a fight on this, the legis-
lative Sunday. , Convocation, however, sat elsewhere, and ºi a
; deal about the theatres being open in the week in which Good
ºriday occurs.
Thursday. The first night of anything like real discussion. In both
Houses the new Educational Minute was the subject, LoRD GRAN VILLE
and MR. Robert Lowr, being the Ministerial speakers. Govern-
ment have very considerably modified the original modifications, and it
was felt that Ministers offered a very satisfactory defence of what
they had done. The EARL or DERby must have enraged an immense
lot of clamorous parsons and indignant teachers, by deliberately de-
claring that all the alterations in the new system had been made in the
right direction. MR. DisRAELI only complained that the explanations
ad not been given sooner. It was understood that the whole question
was to be brought up again, one of these days, for an elaborated dis-
section, but the Reform, which was far more necessary than any other
which could be suggested, is an accomplished fact, and the people will
find out the benefit of it before long.
Friday, PRESIDENT SEWARD having caused KING LINQoIN to send
out another Stone Fleet to §. the destruction of Charleston
Harbour, EARL RUSSELL manfully declared the act a Barbarous one.
We shalf be curious to hear how the chief Barbarian will justify the
deed. If there is much more of this sort of thing, it may be a question
whether the civilised powers ought not to break such a Blockade, not
in the interest of commerce, but of humanity.
Then º: in the Lords the bombshell of nonsense which had
been loaded in Convocation #º allowing the London theatres
to be opened in Passion Week. LORD DUNGANNoN ventilated his
Puseyite notions on the subject, and Mr. Punch was sorry to see his
own right reverend brother, the excellent Bishop of LoNDoN, support-
ing LoRD DUNGANNON, though on somewhat more rational grounds.
Every place of amusement, in and out of London, except the theatres,
is open, at the period in question, and why an Ethiopian serenader
should be permitted to cackle nonsense, while the other black man,
Qtheſlo, must nºt utter the language of the Divine Williams, perhaps
the bishop will privately inform Mr. Punch. The fact is that the ob-
Servance of days, with the exception of Fifty Two, and Two others, is no
longer an English habit, and it is useless to cling to rags of an extinct
ritual. A ſº illustration was given of the way in which Lords
talk of what they do not understand. LoRD DUNGANNoN thought that
there was no hardship upon the Actors, or Actresses from the rule
whish shut up the theatre in Passion Week, because they must be
employed in ºf the entertainments for Easter. Certainly, our
dear lord, and do you know any other word besides DUNGANNoN which
begins with a D# If so, apply it to the nobleman who made the above
speech, and did not know that though the happy artists may have to
rehearse day and night, they are never paid a |; by their generous
º except in respect of public performances. There lº
of lords wº know quite as much as is good for them about ..
matters. Why did nobody tell DuNGANNoN not to talk nonsense?
SIR ROBERT PEEL gave MR. MAGUIRE another knock or two, and
promised him a fight whenever he liked. MR. CowPER said that there
must be a road made from the north of London to the International
Exhibition, and he meant to make one, and spend money out of the
coal duties in doing it, so that the Tyburnian people may scuttle along
comfortably...MR. Först ER complained that the Belgians were doing
us in the matter of Tariff. LORD PALMERSTON had five things to say,
first, that he could not º that savage beast the KING OF DAHOMEY
from murdering his su §. by the thousand; secondly, that the slave
trade could only be finally put down by making commerce more profitable
than man-stealing; thirdly, that the Belgians were inclined to behave
very well; fourthly, that MR. CoBDEN would have had a mark of
Government gratitude for his treaty services, but for his own over-
modest character; and fifthly, that the Ladies of England were causing
the distress in Coventry, by their whimsical adoption of new fashions.
But Cupid could not bring his mind to speak altogether unkindly of
Venus, and he added that the ladies were benefiting Sheffield by
wearing steel, though that often proved fatal to life. £i. the
PREMIER dislikes Crinoline, and we should be pleased to hear him
discuss the subject.
i)ivers other matters kept the House till midnight. The Highways
Bill was sent to a Select Committee, the Warrior was declared to
behave nobly at sea, the National Gallery was announced to be so full
of pictures that we really must have fresh accommodation—and Cox
the Great, Cox of Finsbury, Mr. Punch's own Cox, announced, amid
uprighteous laughter, that he meant, on a given day, to ask Lord
PALMERSTON whether he would bring in a Reform Bill.

What salary should for the work be paid :

But Jow ETT's friends, giving the larger preference,
Subscribe two thousand to make up the difference.
A worthy taste has worthy Doctor Jowett
His saying “No” to the gift, doth clearly show it.

And Jowett's self its tribute Justice owes.

The following is an item of foreign news which has been judged to be
of sufficiently high importance to be worth transmitting in a distinct
telegram:—
“A Servian agent having given to the Porte explanations in reference to the
protest which it addressed to the Powers on the resolutions recently passed by the
SKUPTsKINA of SERVIA, the Porte has declared itself to be better satisfied with
regard to the further intentions of Servia.”
O! for the good old times when we should have asked who, or what,
is the SKUPTsKINA OF SERVIA —when we had no foreign politics to
bother us, and involve us in trouble and expense. How happy we
should be, if we could still exclaim with contented ignorance, that we
didn't know and didn't care whether the SKUPTsKINA of SERVIA was a
potentate, or a parliament, or a parish vestry, or a pack of stuff!

CHARIVARI. 73
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
Y DEAR PUNCH
“OF a truth, I
must congratulate
MR. PHELPs upon
his Shakspeare Gal-
lery. In saying this
however, I do no
refer to any Shak-
* may have in his pos-
session, The gallery
I allude to is the
gallery of his the-
atre, which I saw
crammed the other
evening to see him
play Macbeth. That
crowd of eager faces
all intent upon the
scene is a sight that
any speare-
over must be
pleased to see: and
if I were MR. PHELPs I would not care much for mere pictures, while I had such
a living gallery to look at. . - - - - -
“The playgoers of Pentonville are in this respect peculiar
the play, and not to flirt and chatter. Between the acts, I
that they go to see
grant you, there is
plenty of conversation, and at times a cheerful cat call to recognise a friend. But |M|.
ihe moment the bell rings you hear the cry of “Silence!’ ‘Or-der!’ and then
every tongue is hushed, and every cough is smothered till the curtain drops. The
gallery becomes a model of ‘still life,’ and the falling of a pin would doubtless be
resented as an outrage by the pit. Although the entrance-fees are only sixpence
and a shilling, the frequenters of these seats -
and listen to his words with the attention they deserve. And surely few can fail to
be the better for such ...; and to bear in memory some few of the thousand
noble thoughts he has expressed. In these sensation-craying times, when murders
by moonlight in the midst of splendid scenery, and ships on fire, and slave sales,
and great fieaders are so sought after, I rejoice to find a theatre where SHAKSPEARE
is still popular, and is loved and reverenced for his own intrinsic sake, and not by
reason of the adjuncts which the paint-pot can supply. -
“Macbeth at Sadler's Wells is decidedly worth going to, if only for the sake of
seeing how attractive the play is in itself, without the gorgeous up-gettin º:
at the Princess's a season or two since. There is just a trifle too much thunder in
the murder scene, and the peals are caused so obviously by rolling cannon-balls
about upon the floor just over-head that they do not much enhance the horrors of
the scene... The rain comes down too in such torrents that I really almost feared
that the New River had burst in, and the speech of Lady Macbeth, while her good
husband was "about it was half drowned in the uproar of the artificial flood. The
close of the act, however, was exceedingly well done: Macbeth's scene with his
wife full of horror and remorse, rendered without rant; and the clamour and con-
ſº which the act concludes, done with a good eye to picturesque effect.
“I have seen better casts at Sadler's Wells for this great play. Miss GLYN and
MARSTON were actors to be missed; and their places just at present are but ill
supplied. In the sleep-walking scene Miss ATKINSON spoke too low to be well
audible, and she has besides not force enough worthily to carry out the grandeur of
the ‘part. MR, EDMUND PHELPs is pains taking, and certainly improves; but he
has very much to learn ere he can hope to do full justice to Macduff. Iyery well
remember how his father played the character on the night when MR. MACREADy
retired from the stage; and how, when ºf of the loss of “all his pretty ones
at one fell swoop,” he jº his sorrow words with such a quivering lip, and choked
and tearful utterance that there was scarcely left a dry eye in the house. MR,
MACREADY had his faults: he “pumped” too much, cried some; he “mouthed’
too much, said others; but I for one shall ever reverence his memory. Whatever
his short-comings, he was a man who, did good service to the drama in his day.
MR.P.HELPs as his successor continues his good work; and, although at times too
ponderous and dragging in his speech (in soliloquy especially is this defect ob-
servable), he is really now the only English actor (your pardon, MR. KEAN; no,
I have not forgotten you) who can fitly play a SHAKSPEARE tragić part.
“The pantomime at Sadler's Wells of Cherry and Fair Star is not much to my
taste, though I am bound to say the audience in general seemed pleased by it. But
it has a º opening, which I think is a mistake; and this is more punny
than funny, and drags somewhat slowly through its surplusage of small talk:
‘Action, action, action!' is as requisite in burlesque as DEMOSTHENEs considered
it was needful in a speech. Besides, the story (what there is of it) is not remarkable
for clearness; the harlequinade has no hot poker, and a paucity of tricks. The
only entire change is that of an excursion-train, for Brighton ºi turned into a
“pleasure’ boat, with º ill in it; and this I rather fancy. I have somewhere
seen before. Generally at Sadler's Wells one finds a good old-fashioned pantomime,
ull of comic business, bustle, and big heads. This year the exception is not a very
wise one; and though the audience, now do their best to laugh at the bad puns,
I rather think they would more relish butter-slides and red-hot pokers, and other
fine old pantomimic ways of tickling the house. **
“I have not yet seen the Lily of Killarney, as our old friend the Colleen Baton is
A speare pictures he j.
i. thorough reverence to SHAKSPEARE, i
operatically called; and so I will not venture, as a bolder
£ritic might, to draw upon my fancy, assisted by mere
hearsay, to put forth my sweeping praise or condemnation
of the work, and minutely to detail its every beauty and
defect. As MR. HARRIsox is certainly a bigger man than
MR, Boucicault, I should imagine the great ‘header’
must be even more ‘tremendous’ than it was at the
Adelphi; and, whatever be the added charms of the new
music, any lover of old melody would surely never miss the
chance of hearing Miss Louis A EILY O'Connor PyNE
sing in her sweet voice that charming air, the Cruiskeen
20/2.
“Old Phil's Birthday is a piece well worth seeing at
the Strand, if only because it shows that Mr. Rogers can
do better than play the mere buffoon. That his buffoonery
is...funny I most readily admit: his trumpet-sounding in
Aladdin, and the pranks he played with Mr. GREAT TRA.
GEDIAN.CIARKE, in that absurdest of absurdities, the
Rival Othellos, were really things to make one's side ache,
absurdly out-burlesquing burlesque as they might be.
Still, a touch of quiet humour is better than ºf farce;
and a bit of genuine pathos lives longer in the memory than
many a horse-laugh.
“I º º my next to give a look at the St. James’s,
which I hear is :*: bravely under the new management
thanks to a meat play and pretty classical burlesque. i
mean, too,if I can, to squeeze into the Lyceum, where I
understand since Christmas people have been sitting with
their children on their knees; so crammed has the house
been to see the Peep o' Day, and catch a peep o' mights at
. TeLHIN's lovely scenery, and Miss Lydi A's lively legs
and prettily smiling eyes and lips. As for Drury Lane,
the pit entrance fa. told, is at present only passable b
those who take their stand there at six o'clock, A.M.; º
is the attraction of the pantomime plus MR. KEAN, whom
commend for his good sense in having hitherto shunned
SHAKSPEARE, and stuck to plays like Louis Onze, which
are not beyond his grasp.

and as often as you fail they will allow you to fall back
upon them, and lend you more, and so on until they have
no more to lend, and then they will lend you their names
and their credit, and apologise to you for having done so
little for you.-NEERDoweel. On Goodness.

THE POLICE AND THE CRUSHERS.
- Punch,-"Eureka! See what
I’ve found—in a Police Re-
port, under the head of ‘Ham-
mersmith,’ of a case in which
a rag-and-bone-man was pulled
up by the police for wheeling
a barrow on the pavement at
Kensington, and pleaded that
it was an old-fashioned child's
four-wheeled chaise:–
“Mr. Dayman looked at the Act
of Parliament, and said the words
were “any e,” and therefore
he held that a perambulator would
come within the meaning of the
Act. It was, however, a matter for
police interference. They must
exercise their discretion, and if
they thought perambulators were
not to be meddled with, he could
not interfere. He fined him 5s, and
2s, costs."
“So the police have the
power, of interfering with
perambulators, if they please
to use it. Now that they
know they possess that salu:
tary power, I trust they will
excrcise the same. The de-
- fendant in the case wherein
that point was ruled, by Mr. DAYMAN, urged that in the High-street,
Notting-hill ‘the public had to walk in the road in consequence

A SATIRE IN THE SATURDAY REVIEW.
THE Saturday Review contains an article on “ º; at Public
Schools,” founded on a case the statement of which includes, or at least
implies, what, we trust, is a very, serious mistake..., Let the tale be
told in the Saturday Review's own l age, which, like some that now
and then occurs in police reports and assize intelligence, may perhaps
be quoted for explanatory purposes without offence, -
. After a classical allusion to the custom practised by certain persons
in Ancient Rome, of exposing in the forum, for a particular purpose,
“the traces of the patrician scourge,” the Saturday Review proceeds
in the following strain:—
“A MR. George Jackson, who, in the persons of two hopeful sons, has suffered
a similar indignity, and has similar scars to show, is following the plebeian prece-
dent. The New Police Act, indeed, more prudish than the laws of NuMA, precludes
him from exhibiting, in the Royal Exchange or at Charing Cross, the cuticle of his
offspring furrowed by the cruel twig. #. restricted by the less dramatic habits
of modern days, and the exigencies of modern clothing, and can only display their
bleeding forms in print.”
Although, as touching that same display, the laws of NUMA may be
less prudish than the New Police Act, they are º: considerably
more prudish than the foregoing remarks, if prudish is exactly the º
epithet to apply to any, excess of delicacy relative to a very peculiar
exhibition. Prudery is hardly the word which most men would use to
qualify the extremest sense of the objectionable in that º: That
is an excess of refinement which gentlemen do not generally consider
old-maidish and express themselves as if they did...A licence, however
very much the opposite of such prudery, is manifest in the subjoine
as well as the preceding jeers elaborated at the expense of MR.
Jackson and his sons. The Saturday Review continues, ridiculing that
gentleman:—
“In other words he has published and circulated a pamphlet, detailing, in the
form of a somewhat lengthy correspondence, how his two boys, aged eighteen and
vol.xiii-isº.
nineteen, went from Uppingham School to see their grandmamma for the Easter
holidays—how the charms of her society tempted them i." to delay their return
till the last allowable train—how an imperfect initiation into the mysteries of
Bradshaw caused them to miss that train—and how, in spite of paternal protests
and dmaternal tears, the fatal miscalculation was expia on the block.
MR. JACKSON, feeling his own nerves tingle vicariously at the castigation, first
inflicts a voluminous correspondence upon the Draconic schoolmaster—and then,
having withdrawn his boys from the school, inflicts the same sad and verbose
epistles on the Bishop of LoNDoN—and finally, in the form of a pamphlet, upon
i. of the governors of the school, without apparently obtaining the satisfaction
e desires.”
In the same vein of mockery devoid of prudery, the Saturday Review
pursues the young JACKSONs, also; thus:–
“The doom has been executed and cannot be recalled. Those youthful martyrs
to grandmaternal fascinations cannot have restored to them the abraded cuticle they
have lost. That bloodstained morning can never be washed out of their memory.
And it may be doubted whether this is a sort of martyrdom of which increased
ublicity will mitigato the suffering. At least these high-spirited young men must
much less thin skinned morally than they appear to have been j if they
enjoy the privilege which parental fondness has secured for them of making their
first public entry into English society in the character of grandmamma's flogged
pets.
Stinging words. . They are, however, perhaps, a little too like the
venomous taunts of a rabid woman. Savage words to apply to young
S.
he Saturday Review goes on to scoff at the lads in the aggravating
female style because they were “flogged for inability to tear” them-
selves “from the side of their grandmama,” and have incurred “an
accumulation of comical ignominy com ared to which, in the opinion
of most young men, the punctures of the buds of birch, would smart
but little.” Its attack upon them concludes with the following obser-
vations, very much indeed the reverse of prudish:—
“‘Pleasant but wrong," is recorded by the proverb to have been the remark of
the chimney-sweep when he kissed his grandmother; but he did not embody the
ejaculation in a pamphlet. Whatever the º of the half-healed sufferers may
have been when next they took an uneasy seat by the side of their too seductive
ancestress, they had better have prevailed upon their literary parent to keep their
sorrows and their consolations to himself. Certain it is, they must make the most
of her now, for if they go either into the Army or to a University, they will in a few
months detest her very name.”
The last clause of the above paragraph is simply an invitation of any
regiment or college to which the young JAcksox's may go to banter,
insult, and torment them out of their lives. The Saturday, Review
º as well content itself with attacking established reputations:
and spare the ;..." of young men just entering life.
The great mistake, however, made—as we hope—by the Saturday
Review is especially evident in that part of the extract just quoted
which represents the JACKSONs, respectively eighteen and nineteen
years old, as having been flogged after the manner of children. Ac-
cording to the Saturday Review, moreover, the flogging of adult youths
in that infamous manner is an ordinary practice at º chool.
Here, surely, the Saturday Review is in error. The fact must be that
the young men, if flºº at all, are flogged after the manner of men,
Otherwise Uppingham School would be a place which prudery would
*i; mention, and any schoolmaster exercising the birch at that
establishment would be a person whom we should unwillingly name.
Strangely enough the Saturday Review follows up its sarcasms on the
Quths of eighteen and nineteen by expressing disa ſº of that
iscipline, with whose shameful circumstances, and the cssentially
odious condition involved in them, it had been daily and sporting in
jocosities which any prudery or sort of nicety would shrink from.
VICTIMS OF PROGRESS.
. THE Times, in an awakening leader on the sleepy subject of Educa-
tion, observes, with reference to the sacrifice of vested interests to the
public good, that:-
“Every graveyard in this Metropolis is a vested interest in the dead disregarded
for the sake of the living. That two millions might breathe a purer atmosphere,
we reduced the fees of two or three hundred clergymen.”
Other nuisances have been abated to the detriment of interests
vested in them, besides intramural graveyards. Reform in Doctors'
Commons, for example, destroyed the business of certain proctors. But
in this case did we not hear something of some small- amount of com-
pensation allowed those learned persons for the removal of the offence
which they had enjoyed the prescription of feeding on? Clergymen
are not vermin of less consequence than proctors. e should perhaps
breathe our purer atmosphere with greater complacency if we had
purified it at our own expense and not out of the pockets of a few
unfortunate parsons.
Important Fact for Orange Lodges.
The annual consumption of oranges in England is, so it appears, not
less than 650,000,000 a year. We only allude to this valuable statis-
tical fact, that it may be recorded in the next edition of PIPs' Diary.

party or dinner party overy night, you know, but I shall come in Lent, you know, when

AN APPARITION ACCOUNTED FOR.
, AcçoRDING to Galignani, the Bishop of TARBEs has just
issued a pastoral rming the reality of an apparition,
similar to the reported one of La Salette, and º to
have occurred to a young girl named BERNADETTE SUBI-
Rous, February, 1858, in a fº at a place in the Hautes
Pyrenées named Lourdes. In this document the faithful
are authorised to believe the apparition as certain, and
the "worship of Our Lady of the Grotto of Lourdes”
also “is henceforth authorised throughout the extent of
the diocese.”
Thereon a Paris journal remarks:–
“Is it not clear that BERNADETTE is of the darkestignorance, and
that she has never known, or has conscientiously º her cate-
chism.” She does not say, in fact, that she has seen the Virgin. She
says that she saw the Immaculate Conception. This is of no slight
gravity, and the Bishop of TARBEs would perhaps have done well
to have paid more attention to the circumstance, for it shows that
BERNALETTE looks on the Immaculate Conception as a lady loving to
adorn herself with a blue girdle, and having a fancy for yellow
roses, otherwise we should be obliged to believe that the Virgin
had really º to BERNADETTE, and had taken advantage of the
simplicity of the child to give her the falsest ideas of the Immaculate
Conception.”
as those of BERNADETTE, was in her right place when she
beheld an apparition in the Grotto of Lourdes. The Bishop
of TARBEs must be as lourd as the visionary herself, to
publish such humbug as the story he vouches in his
pastoral, expecting it to be swallowed, unless the people
111 diocese are mostly imbecile. That the girl saw a
figure, elegantly attired, which she took for that of a holy
rsonage, is very probable, and it is also likely that she
eard the words Immaculate Conception, which she sup-
posed to be synonymous with Nôtre Dame. Apparitions
such as she beheld are wont, seemingly, to occur principally
about the Alps and Pyrenees, and other mountainous
regions. In these districts also a peculiar affection is
prevalent and endemic; that of Cretinism.

AMONG recent announcements of medical books, the following will,

tines, Chronic Diarrhoea (even of many years standing), Spinal Complaint, and
Asthma; their successful treatment. Digestion, its Derangements and Remedy.

From the above title and list of contents we should be disposed to
conclude that the author of The Blood of the Aristocracy means to say

Does the blood of the aristocracy, examined under the microscope,
exhibit finer, globules than that of the common people; and does
chemical analysis detect in it, any peculiar principle of honour, which
might be named Stirpine or the principle of Race, or Stemmatine, or,
more familiarly, Pedigrine; or, more familiarly still, Nobbine, or
Swelline? .

The origin of pure blood, the blood of the aristocracy, whole and

an interesting subject of inquiry, if there were any scientific reason
for believing that personage to have been a king of men, who are sup-
posed to have chipped the flints in the drift, and not that more modern

How to Train up a Child.
The best plan of training a child is to allow him to put on a railway-

the doors, call out the names of the stations, and to start the train by
blowing the whistle taking good care that he pays well for the latter,
Such training, may lead him eventually to a commission of lunacy, but
that is no fault of his tutors, more especially as the charge is even a
uicker method than the railway of allowing the young man to run

“All history proves
that music is as indis-

Whether “Yankee Doodle” be a “good national tune,”

its brass bands:-
“Suppose, then, that wenurchase asteam instrument—a mammoth

Or, if it be objected that it would be difficult to average the melody

Well, certainly, if MR. BENNETT's hint be acted on, it
will bring us strong temptation to break through our

THE WHOLE DUTY OF PROPERTY.
We are told that “Property has its duties as
well as its rights.” Amongst its various duties,
we suppose, may be safely enumerated, the
º uty, the succession-duty, to say nothing
of innumerable Custom-house duties, if Property
prefers importing its own wines, &c. Another
duty is one that your relatives think it incumbent
upon them to take of trying to prove you to be a
lunatic, if they fancy you are spending more
money than in prudence you º to do, and so
are cutting down the value of your Property.
We don't know so much about “its rights,”
excepting the right that ...} always has of
serving on a Jury when summoned, and of giving
as many dinners and evening parties, conver-
saziones, and picnics as it pleases, all of which
#|sundry rights, we conclude, may be fairly classed
§|under the inviting category of the rites” of
hospitality. Another of “its rights,” however,
and it is a strong and enviable one, is, so often
as Property gives offence to, or will not comply
with the exacting requests of one inferior in
station to himself, to be called “a bloated
aristocrat.” For ourselves, we must say, if we
had any choice in the matter, that we would
sooner any day be “a bloated aristocrat” than
a bloated democrat,” as we have generall
found the latter to be the most intolerable, an
least tolerating, aristocrat in the world.

WHAT ARE THE BISHOPS ABOUTP
CLERGYMEN in general are wont to be extremely active. in sending
round the hat; but in Ireland there appear to be exceptions to the
rule, at least if one may judge so by a letter put forth lately by a
Dublin paper:—
“Will the inhabitants of Dublin believe what I am about to state? Yesterday a
person having a foreign aspect called on me to inquire who had c e of the ru
of St. Andrew's Church, as he wished to hire our Protestant place of worship for a
Circus (!); and excused himself by saying he observed it in the same condition
when here twelve months ago. Is it not d e sufficient to see such a ruin in our
city, without the monstrous insult of a stranger, induced by its lengthened neglect,
to proffer money for its use for such a purpose? I would earnestly call the attention
of the committee of m ement and our parishioners to this circumstance, to save
us for the future from such humiliating proposals.”
A church, in ruins for a twelvemonth ! What a splendid theme for
clerical º to beg upon! ... How is it that the parsons have
neglected to lay hold of it? . Had it been that funds were needed for a
church in, Otaheite, Timbuctoo, or Madagascar, we doubt not Exeter
Hall would long ere this have called a meeting, and have poured forth
floods of eloquence, to demonstrate the pressing mature of the claim.
But Dublin-pooh! the Dublinites may take care of themselves. Let
their churches go to ruin, and their parsons, go in rags. Ireland of
çourse is much too near at home to be seen by Exeter Hall, with its
far-sighted philanthropy.
And so, in a country where the Catholics abound, the Protestants are
suffered to see their church in ruins. How the Pope's Brass Band
must joy to sound a note of exultation at the fact! For who can well
expect to see conversions to a faith that thus allows its temples to fall
into decay?. It has long been a stigma upon Protestants in general,
that while they beautify their houses they leave their churches bare.
But worse still is the odium reflected on the body by the fact of
churches left to fall about its ears. Whether or no, the “Committee
of Management” be faulty in the case of St. Andrew’s, Punch knows
not. But whoever be to blame, Punch, as a true Protestant, must here
record his protest against another twelvemonths being let to pass,
without steps º; to prevent the chance of offers to make a
foreign circus of a British church.
ADVICE to THE CHARLESEs of CHARLEstown.—Why don't you engage
DEERF00T to run the blockade for you, for he has the reputation of
being able to run anything?
A SUBLIME SULTAN.
His Majesty the EMPEROR or MoRocco is raising a loan in London,
by virtue of a treaty concluded with Her Majesty the QUEEN, through
his Majesty's Plenipotentiary, commissioned by a warrant which bears
the EMPEROR's royal signet, and begins thus:-
“In the name of God, the merciful and clement There is no strength or power
but in God, the most high, and mighty Be it known by this our letter, elevated
and protected by God, and luminous as the sun and moon, that we have, by the
help of God, granted to our employed, the Honourable HADJ ABDERRAHMAM-EL-
AJEE, full power and authority to conclude with the Minister, MR. John HAY
DRUMMond HAY, the convention, and to treat with the merchant, Lewis Fondr,
regarding the arrangements relative to the loan of $2,000,000 to be advanced by the
British capitalists.”
The foregoing anticlimax beats “In the name of the Prophet—figs!”
A Yankee, however, who worships the dollar, would, not perhaps see
the drop. The instrument above quoted reads like the edict of some
such a sovereign as CHRONQNHotonTHoLogos. It is worded, in bom-
bast which must be ascribed to some absurd minister, or would indicate
the EMPEROR OF MoRocco to be a most leatherheaded monarch.
Fancy a rational creature calling his letter “luminous as the sun
and moon.” Impossible ! As LoRD, DUNDREARY would say—"The
EMPwA of Mowocco must be a lunatic.”
Approaching Union.
We understand that LoRD BAyswater is shortly to be united to the
lovely Miss KENsingtoN, whose enormous wealth will be made a public
exhibition of shortly after the two have been made one. Allgood wishes
follow this happy union, which we confess, has been too long deferred.
As much as £35,000 will be spent, we understand, in bringing the two
together. This is great extravagance at their first starting in life, but
we trust that the fair couple, in spite of it, will be able #ºil; to
make both ends meet.
Common Justice.

[MARCH 1, 1862.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EBRUARY 17, Monday.
“REGISTER!, register! re-
ter!” cried the late
IR Robert to the terri.
torial aristocracy. So
crieth the late SIR RICH-
ARD, now LoRD WEST-
Bury, to the land owners,
and those who wish to be
declared such... To-night
his Lordship introduced
the Conveyancing Reform
Bill. Having to expound
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
the necessity for the Bill,
and its character, to an
º
º
audience of coronets, the
º Chancellor had to be very
- lucid indeed, and to ex;
º himself in the broad
ashion in which PROFEs-
sor FARADAY lectures the
Juveniles in Albemarle
Street. In consequence,
the º has been
º
-
º
promptly down upon him,
and a Attorney, who
should, considering his
osition, have a little
#. intellect, has actu-
ally pretended to believe that one of the greatest and keenest º: in England did not
know as much about Feoffment as MR, PAUL CHEQUERRENT himself would have been able
to state at his examination in the Head Attorney’s own hall in Wickedness Lane. It would
have been as reasonable to allege that because FARADAY would probably tell the young ladies
and º that the earthis round, he does not know that it is flattened at the poles. The
attack is valuable, as showing the spirit in which attorneyism is eager tº deal with Cºnveyan:
ging Reform, but is it not a short-sighted policy on the part of the small lawyers?...Surely it
is better to try and multiply * as the making conveyancing º will do, than
to cling to the old system, which enriches a few aristocratic pets like MR. TULKINGHoRN,
but which prevents thousands of clients from having anything to do with the purchase of land.
LoRD WestBURY proposes, as hath been intimated, a Three-Fold Registration. The attor-
neys, say that if they had three ears they’d hear him, but the longitude rather than the
number of their ears is illustrated in their resistance to his Bill. He wishes to establish:-
1. A Registry of out-and-out Good Titles.
2. A Registry of Titles that will be out-and-out good if they are let alone long enough.
3. A Registry of Mortgages and Incumbrances, the Duplicates, as it were, which show
that hard-up Territorial Aristocrats have been to their Uncle.
. The mode in which the Registration is to be effected is mere matter of detail, as the man
#. farce says of the question whether the Bill he has accepted soreadily will be paid or not.
en,
All deeds are to be printed,
LoRD WESTBURY, with a fine sense of human nature, observing that this will marvellously
abbreviate them, for º an attorney may not hesitate to hand over pound after pound of
waste-paper covenants and provisoes and rubbish to a tallow-faced law-stationer to engross,
even attorneyism would recoil from the idea º and editing such Bosh. The Com-
positor has been found to shorten Chancery pleadings in a wonderful manner. Next,
Deeds may be as short as they used to be in the good old times, which the lovers of
recedent are bound to admire. There lies before Mr. Punch at this moment a
ingy little deed of the time of RICHARD THE THIRD (who was killed in Pomfret
Castle, MR. Cox, and who afterwards gained the name, of Coeur DE LION, because
his wife PHILIPPA sucked the poison from a wound he received at Naseby), and
this—of which he can read one word only, namely, dº—contains nineteen lines and
conveys ninety acres of first-rate Gloucestershire land. Let us, Lord DERBY, go
back to the customs of the good days—what would your respected ancestress, JoAN
PE ALDITHEY, have said to a marriage settlement on twenty-nine skins—do you not
think that high-spirited young lady would have made that number thirty, by adding
the wretched attorney's to the lot?
But there is nothing compulsory in the matter. If a man has the sense to let his title be
examined by first class authority, and certified to be good, he may, but if he has ugly holes
in his parchments, or benevolently º to go on making the fortunes of the Tulking-
HoRNs, there is no enactment to prohibit his wisdom or folly from having full play.
And that is LoRD WESTBURY's Bill, for the which Mr. Punch, in the interest of Common
Sense and Common Honesty, begs to thank him. Whether the attorneys will let their
obedient servants, the Territorial Aristocracy, pass the Bill, remains to be seen. LoRD
St. LEONARDs sees objections, LoRD CRANworth cannot understand the measure, LoRD
CHELMSFORD, wants to send it, with two Bills of his own and two of LQRD CRAN worth's,
to a Select Committee, and we all know what that means. But the Lords have, in the
language of ALEXANDER Pope, º same as Pope ALEXANDER, you know, MR. Cox). “heard
BETHELL's sermon,” and Mr. Punch, again, and with equally exquisite fitness, quoting the
same poet, will add,
“Let lands and houses have what Lords they will,
us be fixed, and our own masters still.”
Some letters of Count Cavour's have lately
been surreptitiously published. The object is a
French one, and it is to help RATAzzt as against
Ricasoli. In these letters Cavour states that
LoRD CLARENDoN gave him strong assurances
that º: would take an active part for Italy:
LoRD CLARENDoN stated to-night that he did
nothing of the kind. If the two noblementalked
bad French, we might arrive at a solution which
would leave blame, only upon their respective
instructors in the French tongue, but this could
not be the case, and we can only º that
CLARENDoN talked with his cigar in his mouth,
and CAvour interpreted the puffs his own way.
SIR GEORGE GREY informed us... that the
Bishops have invented a plan for improving
Church Discipline, but that he had not had time
to read it, º therefore could not say whether it
would do. MR. CowPER declined letting car-
riages on to the gravel walk from Bayswater,
through the Gardens, to the Iron Gates, but pro-
mised his Bill for the new road directly. He kept
his word.
MR. BRIGHT and LoRD PALMERSTON then had
their first fight on the American question, MR.
BRIGHT had no ...}. against the Foreign
Office, but was excee º wrath at the demon-
stration with which our demand for Mason and
SLIDELL had been accompanied. He likened
PAM to one who should send a polite note to
another, “at the same time sending a man of
portentous strength, handling a gigantic club,
and making every kind of Ferocious Gesticula-
tion.”. He said that the Americans, intended
from the first to do what was right, and that our
Government knew, it, and ought not, to have
armed. To the which PAM responded that he
not only knew nothing of the kind, but that
every act of the American Government and the
American people º the contrary, that he
had simply done his duty in showing that we
meant to stand no nonsense, and that he attri-
buted the result to our having made that demon-
stration. MR. BRIGHT was therefore Shut Up,
and divers war and navy estimates were voted.
Tuesday. Exhausted by the intellectual exer-
tion of the preceding evening, the Lords sat but
an hour and a-half. They listened to EARL
Russell’s explanation that one SHAVER, , a
Briton, who had been temporarily locked up by
MR. SEwARD, had not much of a case for com-
pensation. SHAVER's memorial is therefore a
tabula Rasa. Then came the CHANCELLOR's
explanation that somehow the unfortunate lower
§. of the late Insolvent Court had been
reduced to great distress by a wrong interpreta-
tion of the New Act, and that he did not see
how the poor fellows were to be helped. The
case is an excessively hard one, and if these
officials had been in loftier station, some means
of doing them justice would have been dis-
covered long ago. Mr. Punch strongly advises
their being assisted in some way, even out of
the Suitors’ Fund. Finally, it appears that at
Manchester, Leeds, and elsewhere, some self-
sufficient Idiots meet, call themselves Commit-
tees on Foreign Affairs, and sit up night
the members alternately relieving one another o
course, and watching over the world in general,
This would be harmless, if their wives don't mind
it, and if the foolish persons did not trouble the
ublic with their absurdities. But two of these
ommittees have sent documents to the Lords,
stating that the Americans were quite right in
the Trent business, and setting out other miaise-
ries, which they desired ionoijerºy to lay
before the Peers. He said that he had told the
memorialists that they were donkeys, but they
begged him, nevertheless to present their peti.
tions, which he did. -
Proceed we to the Commons, where the im-
posing ceremony of which our Cox had given
notice was solemnly º -
. Cof. Does Lººp PALMºston mean to bring
in a Reform Bill?—Pam, No.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The House laughed. The Star says that it is “the fashion to laugh
at MR. Cox,” . as the House of Commons is of course dressed to
the last political Le Follet, the result was inevitable. , .
SIR GEORGE LEwis means to bring in a Bill for making short work
with soldiers who shoot their officers. MR, SCULLY brought in a Bill,
in which there is really some sense, to enable land-owners in Ireland to
raise money on débentures charged on the land. MR HENRY HERBERT
does not i. that Irish proprietors, need more assistance to raise
money. MR. 'ADFIELD ...}that legislature was “running wild”, on
land subjects, but he did not propose to 'anghanybody this evening...The
member of whom Sheffield need not be ashamed, brought in a Bill for
suppressing the Fraudulent Imitation of Trade-Marks, a system whereby
a foreigner is deluded into buying, for instance, a wretched Brummagem
steel article under the idea that it is made by Turton, or some equally
celebrated manufacturer. Government also take up the subject, and it
ought to be an Egg which the Pythoness of Parliament will not Addle.
With a gratification, not usually experienced by Mr. Punch when
boiling down, the Parliamentary basket of spinach into the delicate
dish he sets before the QUEEN and the public, he records, that MR;
CHILDERs called attention to the exploit of the gallant BURKE and
WELLs and their companions, who crossed the Australian continent,
and, as MR. C. ForTEscue said, performed heroic acts, which practically
added territories to the British Crown, and provided a space for new
colonies. These brave men underwent a slow martyrdom, compared to
which the deeds of the soldier, with his blood on fire, and his courage
cheered by the companionship of his comrades and the excitement of
battle, are small matters. Australia can never forget their names, nor
should England.
Wednesday. MR. 'ADFIELD, who is a grievance-monger, bropight on
for Second Reading a Bill for ending an awful grievance—the law that
persons admitted to corporate offices must declare that they will not
use their official power towards the ruin of the Church of England.
MR. NEwBEGATE seemed to think such a declaration a mighty bul-
wark of the Church. SIR GEORGE GREY smiled somewhat contemp:
tuously on the bigotry on each side, and the second reading was carried
by 63 to 54. Then we had the Wife's Sister business all over again-
sorrowing widower, beloved aunt, Leriticus, Hamlet, woman's senti.
ments, bereaved children, destruction of conjugal confidence, habits of
Jews, TACIT's, the House of Lords, restrictions on, marriage, the late
Bishop of DURHAM, colonial practices, prohibited degrees, and all the
rest of it. The best point made was, that the law of England declares
your sister-in-law to be a Relation, if you want to marry her, but no
relation if you want to leave her a legacy, but a Stranger in Blood, and
therefore charged by the law with a heavy legacy duty. The Second
Reading was carried by 144 to 133.
Thursday being the anniversary of the Coronation of KING Edward
THE SIXTH, or for some other reason, the Lords did no business.
The Commons read a Second Time, by 142 to 39, a Bill for dealing with
the disused St. Giles's Burial Ground. The Pancras, Vestry had been
making a row against the Bill, which nearly convinced Mr. Punch that
it was a proper Bill, and the conviction was completed by a few words
from MR. MAssEy, MR. C. Fort Escue announced that the glorious
story about the gold in British Columbia, had not been exaggerated—
the gold lies about in heaps—but the ºlº §. the place,
which lies a long way from the Fraser River. FRASER's Magazines are
a want in the colony. Wicked Gloucester and wicked Wakefield, so
long hung up, pro criminibus, are again to be trusted with elections;
and it is wittily suggested, that the electors, will demand two years'
interest on the bribes which have been withheld from them. SIR
RoPERT PEEI, brought in a Bill for Registration of Births and Deaths
in Ireland. The police are to work it; but even PEEL and the Peelers
are afraid to attempt a registration of Irish marriages. MR HENNEssey
said the most ferocious thing against his countrymen that we have ever
heard. He declared that SIR. R. PEEL was unpopular in Ireland chiefly
because he had taken the head of the Constabulary with him on his late
tour. If this be true, Irishmen must be either idiots or savages; but
we prefer believing that MR HENNEssey is a gentleman with a salta-
tory mind, but one that leaps to wrong conclusions.
Friday. There is to be a grand Volunteer Review at Brighton on
Easter Monday, and by way of preventing any jealousies as to the
command on that occasion (for Volunteer officers, though the ladies very
!º them as Angels, are really but Men), Government have
asked LoRD CLYDE, who is a Volunteer and something else, to be the
Commander. Jones THE Avenger, otherwise and favourably known
as LORD RANELAGH, has hastened to signify his entire approval of the
selection, which EARL DE GREY announced this evening.
SIR GEORGE GREY did not see any reason for amending the Cab
Laws. . He is quite right. We only wish that he had been at the
Zoological Gardens a Sunday or so back, and had seen the long line of
cabs waiting to receive those who had been to leave their cards on the
Pythoness. He would have been struck with the delicate attention
which the gallant cabmen were preparing for their lady employers.
Foot tins could not be procured, but it was a cold day, and inside every
cab (its windows carefully closed) sat the driver, smoking with all his
might at a black pipe of tobacco, so strong that the promenade beside
the line was a Valley of Incense. While suchchivalry is displayed, who
desires a change?
MR. MAGUIRE and SIR. Robert PEEL had another duel, under pre-
tence of discussing the question whether distress exists in Ireland.
Various Irish Members eagerly became seconds. The House seemed
to think that there was distress, but that it arose from natural causes,
and that, there was far more in England, where it is not the custom
to gome begging to Parliament upon every possible occasion.
LORD PAIMERSTON made a little speech which will be read all over
Europe, to the delight of sundry parties. He said that in almost
every part of Italy, and especially in Rome, there had been a stron
manifestation of desire that Rome should be the capital of Italy, j
that the temporal }. of the Pope should cease. The QUEEN’s
Government, he added, had taken no part in regard to that feeling.
Perhaps not; but we should like to heat CAI prº. ANTonji on tº
question whether such a statement by the Premier of England was
altogether,an insignificant aid to the consolidation of European opinion
on the subject. Of course PAM meant nothing of the kind, and of
course NAPQLEON THE THIRD and Pius THE LAst will comprehend
this, Mr. Punch would deeply regret any misunderstanding.
MR. CowPER said that he j do nothing to abate i. nuisance
Called Lºicester Square, and then brought in his Bill for the New
Road, The Members did not seem interested in the matter, and
actually divided in insufficient force to make a House, the two 'sides
making but 29, MR. BERNAL OSBoRNE had been emitting some good
oks against the Bill, and as the assembly broke up, remarked, “Well,
y Jove, if the Minister can't cut a road, the House can cut alway.”
“THESE YOUNG FOLKS.”
... “There is, we believe, every º of a Royal Matrimonial Alliance, more
important than even that of the pºss ALICE, being announced at no distant
date. The PRINCE or WALEs is likely, we understand, to make choice of a Danish
Princess; and his Royal Highness will P.": have his first interview with his
intended—who is said to be possessed of great personal attractions—in the course
of his present tour.”
To the above interesting paragraph, in the columns of a well-informed
contemporary, Mr. Punch will only append the remark that he has very
good maps, but cannot make out that Denmark is exactly in the road
to Jerusalem, and that it has been authoritatively stated, probably
without the least reason, that, the Prince will return through the
Tuileries. Perhaps, however, this may bear upon the fact. Mr. Punch
has written to LORD CowLEY, in the words of Polonius:—
“Inquire me now what Danskers are in Paris.”
“Place aux Dames!”
THE French are always exclaiming with the utmost heartiness,
“Place aur Dames /* Not less heartly dowejoin in the exclamation.
But how comes it then, we wish to know, that whereas they, in ad-
dressing an audience, always say, “Messieurs et Mesdames,” we, with
a gallantry that not even the greatest snob ever deviates from, make a
point invariably of saying, “Ladies and Gentlemen º’” The truth is,
the French are exceedingly clever at theorising, but the English, far
cleverer than they (hen /), always beat them most handsomely in
carrying their theories into practice.
WINE FROM THE WOOD.
FROM statistical returns it appears that all the exports from Mexico,
except one, have considerably increased of late years. That one, which
on the contrary shows a great falling off, is Logwood. . A simultaneous
decrease has taken place in the consumption of Port wine.
All Ultramontanes' Day.
THE POPE has invited all his Bishops throughout the world to attend
at a canonisation to take place at Rome in May; when the prelates
may take an opportunity of assenting to the last new dogma of the
inviolability of the temporal ºf * !—that may be too late.
The Roman difficulty may be solved by that time. 3 Holiness
should issue cards for the first of April. -
“As MAD As A MARCH HARE.”
WE have often heard a person accused of the above malady, what-
ever it may be, and we suppose that such a form of lunacy takes place
when a harum-scarum young fellow runs through his property “like
mad,” and his reason, as well as his property, thereby becomes four-
Jeeted /—(Good gracious !)

PAUSE, pause, my LoRD WESTBURy, ere you are lost—
Think twice 'ere #. press your Bill,
To clip the wings of Land-transfer's cost,
And disable conveyancers’ skill.
A Bill, which if passed, will take title to Land
From that region of fruitful doubt
Where under the nursing . hand,
Quirk-crops and º golden stand,
And with flails of conveyancing counsel bland
Are in nourishing fees thrashed out.
A Bill our legal fleecers to fleece,
And flay of their parchment skins;
That to limbo consigns ancient Lease and Release,
Bids Satisfied Terms depart in peace,
To Fines and Recov’ries brings sad surcease,
And of Trusts and Covenants nips the increase.
And “queries” and “searches” thins !
What were his fate, who a hornet's swarm
Should assail, without brimstone's aid?
Or his, who should thrust his unguarded arm
In a knot of rattle-snakes, coiling warm,
To yours, who, defiantly, sound the alarm
o the lawyers' black brigade?
'Tis war to the knife, and no quarter given,
Till either the other kills:
The North and the South have savagely striven,
But mild is the malice with which they’re riven,
Compared to the hate that the feud will leaven
*Twixt yours and the lawyer's Bills.
“And who is it,” they’ll ask, “who dares encroach
On our smug ring-fenced fee farm P
No st r—but one at whose welcome 'ºh,
As he rolled to our gates in his Chancery-Coach,
Fattest calves we’ve slain, set best liquor abroach–
'Tis he who would work us harm!”
The sweetest wine—’tis a fact well known–
Doth to sourest vinegar turn:
The hatreds of lovers proverbial have grown;
Of all rows, a husband's with bone of his bone-
Of all wars, those with folks of one blood with our own—
Are still those that most fiercely burn.
Then think what a strife this Bill will breed,
'Twixt you and the Limbs of the Lawl
You a priest of their own most orthodox creed,
Who’ve practised their myst'ry—word and deed—
You, wº bag they have filled, and whose clerk they have
ee
You, who know their each fence, and each flaw
“He who gives us this fall is one, whom our trips
We taught—how to † and to guard:
We pickled the rods and we plaited the whips,
And furnished the knotty points to the tips
Which he |. on legal small ribs and hips—
We are hoised by our own petard!”
Oh, lawyers' revenge is a terrible thing !

I know not yet when or how they’ll bring
Their “odium causidicum's" vitriol sting.
From their vials of wrath on your wig to fling—
But I know that the vials are there!
In my mind's eye prophetic I see a sight,
That doth more my soul º -
That e'en Bishop HATTo's terrible plight
When the rats assailed him from left and from right,
By tens, scores, hundreds and thousands—till flight
as Qut of the question, they ºff." him so tight,

Like a drowning man clasped to a board,

At his robes and the body beneath them to pluck,
Till they’ve served him exactly as schoolboys serve “tuck,”

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
NDROMEDA, my dear Punch,
as every schoolboy knows
has in that well-thumbe
little volume, the Gradus
ad Parnassum, the epithets
applied to her of ‘pulchra’
and ‘formosa;’ and I think
these adjectives may fit-
tingly be given tº the
| Andromeda now acting at
= the St. James's theatre.
É Besides her personal attrac-
tions, Miss HERBERT has,
moreover, the somewhat
rarer gift of knowing how
to walk and talk somewhat
like a lady, even when
assuming a part in a bur-
lesque; and does not think
it needful to lay aside all
grace, in order to bring out
the humour of her part.
º Whether her example be
- infectious, I know not; but
it is, certain that the piece
in which she is now .#
is played without a trace o
coarseness or ity, and
freedom from these blots is
not so common as it should
be in the acting of bur-
lesques. Ears, and eyes
the most fastidious and
- delicately sensitive may find
an hour or so’s amusemeut in Perseus and Andromeda, without the
slightest risk of their annoyance by the faintest shadow of offence.
“For this commendable result not the actors merely, but the author
must be thanked; and I here record my gratitude to MR. WILLIAM
BRough for the meat and pretty piece his fancy has *g. and the
tasteful way in which he has worked his subject out. , Steering clear of
stale, and stupid migger songs, which surely have by this time been
parodied to death, he has introduced some pleasant º: music;
and though somewhat more prolific in puns than I could wish, he has
not sacrificed, as some do, the clearness of his story by too exclusive
care to the smartness of his small talk. Then, again, great Hºl. hav
been given by the management to getting up the piece; and althoug
no puffs are published in the playbill as to who devised the dresses,
what great genius made the properties, and who fitted up the gas, the
mounting is throughout both pretty and º: and nothing is
left wanting to win deserved success. Though not, perhaps, so striking
as the last scene in ion, the group is very charmingly
arranged; while, for suddenness, of change and picturesqueness of
effect, the pettifaction of Greek soldiers by the showing of Medusa's
head, has rarely in my memory been equalled in burlesque.
“KING FRANK MATTHEws PolydECTEs is a most amusing monarch,
and the solemnity with which he sings his ‘ - -
MR. CHARLEs PHINEus's ‘I’d Choose to be a Daisy’ tenor, is a thing
to make one split. Scarce less entertaining is his tender and then
terrible demeanour to poor Danaë, whose sharp words Mas. MATTHEws
delivers with great point. Somehow these old stagers make a joke go
farther than most young ones now know how to do. And somehow,

amused, the last time as I was the first. Trashyas in some respects
assuredly it is, it º seems to me a piece .# actors must enjoy
and act with real relish, because they feeſ assured it will be relished by
the house. What goes on at a girl's school any man must like to
know; and to see a lot of school-girls at their lessons or their romps
must surely be amusing to eyes of either sex. And when MRs. FRANK
MATTHEws assumes the post of teacher, and has such pretty pupils
as Miss HERBERT and KATE TERRY, a peep into her schooſ-room is
surely worth one's while.
“The new drama here, SelfMade, I have not yet found time to see.
That at the Princess's is also “taken from the French, and it were no
†. loss to us if they, had kept it to themselves. To personify the
Angel of Death upon the stage may be pleasing to a French taste, but
is revolting to an English one; and a play where this is done, no
matter how well mounted, I hope will never become popular upon our
purer st I am not thin-skinned, and not affected easily by seeing
sudden deaths in melodrame, or gruesome ghastly ghosts. But to
personate an angel is to my mind most objectionable, and becomes
almost profanity when the object is to serve a low dramatic purpose,
and excite a grim sensation by some highly spiced effects. There are
angels in a play by SHAKSPEARE, it is true; but they are presented
merely in a vision, and are not brought, forward to chatter and make
jokes. Death is a thing too sacred to be dealt with on the stage in
gross material shape. It outrages the holiest feelings in our nature to
see such subjects coarsely handled, and merely introduced to give a
spurious effect. Such things are not fit to be presented coram populo,
even though it may be done with the profoundest reverence, and not,
as in this French play, in a manner low and coarse. To see the
Destroying Angel decked in protean disguises: coming on in one scene
as a pertish lawyer's-clerk, and in the next as a smart quick-tongued
beauty in a ball-room, anon dressed in squalid rags as an old hag in a
duel-scene, and next assuming wedding raiment and a bridesmaid's
wreath; to witness this excites no reverence, and savours of profanity,
and can but tend to make people disgusted with the stage.
. “The management of the Princess's is in general so careful in selec-
tion of its pieces, and so sedulously anxious to avoid giving offence,
that, I cannot but regard the production of this French play as an
accidental slip. For the credit of the theatre, I most sincerely hope to
see no more such accidents; while for the credit of the audience I trust
that the º which I heard. the other evening may be accorded
simply to the really good up-getting, and not to the bad piece. It is a
pity, to my thinking, to see so much good scenery wasted on a drama
of such extreme bad taste; and it is only kindness to speak harshly of
such errors as the Angel of Midnight, so as, if it may be, to prevent
the repetition of what must serve to bring discredit on a theatre, and
lower the high standing of the English stage.
“ONE WHO PAYS.”
HOAX ON THE SERIOUS PAPERS.
THE Bishop of ExETER has not hitherto been very popular in the
Hall which is synonymous with his diocese, but if a º: para;
graph may be trusted, the name of HENRY PHILPOTTs will be received
there at some of the approaching May meetings with immense applause.
For the REVEREND JULIAN YouNG, of Torquay, a short time since ;
£15 15s. for the Torbay Infirmary, by reading at the request of the
Managers of that Charity, the play of Hamlet at the Mechanics’
Institute. It is stated that the Bishop of ExETER has therefore pro-
hibited MR. YoUNG from preaching in his diocese. This is too good news
for MAwworm, STIGGINs, CHADBAND AND Co., to be true. THE
Bishop of Exeter has himself read Hamlet, so as to know in what
respect it differs from Tom and Jerry, and is aware that SHAKSPEARE
was a respectable writer. The truth is probably just the reverse of
what is stated. The Bishop, most likely, went to hear MR. Young
read SHAKSPEARE, and was soFº with his delivery of the text that
hº has preferred him to a goºd living, sº as tº enable him to exemplify
Hamlet's advice on the subject of elocution in the pulpit.
Good at Fielding-and at Hitting.
In the immortal conversation, in Joseph Andrews, between Parson
Adams and the grumbling and vengeful Peter Pounce, everybody must
remember this bit:—
“You will pardon me, Sir," returned the Parson, “I have read of the Gymno-
ists.”
“A p e of your Jehosaphata," cried PETER. “The test fault in our Con-
stitution is the provision made for the poor—except that made for some others.
Sir, I have not an estate,” &c.
The Bishop of SALISBURY is a well-read man. Did the above scrap
come into his head when he was meekly listening to MR. Roßbuck?

rº SILENCE IS GOLDEN.”—chinese Proverb.
Two Italian boys, BoLTARELLI and TUsA, were brought
np at Westminster the other day charged with begging.
One of them carried an accordion, the other a hurdygurdy;
but neither instrument would play. The worthy Magistrate
committed one boy for seven days, and remanded the other.
No doubt they deserved to be punished for, begging,
but really, the Magistrate might have considered, in miti.
tion of punishment, the extenuating circumstance that
the instruments of torture they carried were dummies—
that they wouldn’t “play”—to use the euphemism of the
reporter-though you might as well apply the word “play”
to the rack or the “Scavenger's Daughter.” Much as we
object to beggars, we should be content to compound for
any amount of Italian cadgers, provided they were confined
to their organs of speech, and spared us the grinding tyranny
of those other organs they use so j
It is the duty of the Magistrates, we maintain, in all cases
in which these Italian vagrants are brought up, to let it
be clearly understood that the gist of their offence lies less
in their plying for alms, than in their doing so by means
which cause acute suffering to busy or sensitive brains. It
would be of useful example, we venture to submit, if the
magistracy, were to show marked lenity to all Italians
begging with dumb organs, as BoLTARELLI and TUsA with
their voiceless accordion and hurdygurdy. We should be
inclined to put such a case very much on a with that

AN INFANT'S WINE BILL.
A CoMIC action came on the other day in the Court of Common
Pleas... This was Rose and Another v. Hoof, brought to recover
£204.11s. 0d., a balance of £776 for wines and spirits supplied between
the 15th July, 1859, and the 21st June, 1861, by the plaintiffs, liquor-
merchants in Oxford Street, to the defendant, a young man who has
lately come into property. MR. SERJEANT PARRY and MR. Woop
appeared for the plaintiffs, whose interests may be represented as it
were in the Woop, though PARRY, one would think, might have been
more ºff. retained for the defence. The defendant’s counsel
were MR. HuDDLESTON and GARTH, of whom it may be sufficient to
remark, that if the former of º ins of being HUD-
DLESTON, had been Fuppleston, MR. GARTH would have had a senior
nominally better qualified to lead him in defending an action for a
heavy tipple-bill.
According to the report of this interesting case:—
“A good deal of discussion took place between counsel, and it was stated that
there was a plea of infancy upon the record, and therefore the question whether
this quantity of wine was necessary for an infant might arise.”
MR. JUSTICE BYLEs directed this question to be referred. Of course,
No British Judge would yenture hastily to pronounce what quantity of
wine might be necessary for an infant. If the child is the father of the
man, the quantity of wine which the child should drink must bear
some relation to that which the man will be able to stand. That man
for instance, may be a Judge. In that case he will walk steady an
keep a clear head with twice as much liquor, inside of him as would
make an ordinary person drunk and incapable. The infant destined
to the ermine will accordingly be able to suck in a considerably greater
allowance of wine than most other infants, and remain sober as a Judge.
There is no knowing what infants will turn out, and therefore no
saying.exactly how much drink, may be necessary for any particular
one. The Band of Hope, would, decide that, no amount of wine is
necessary for any infant; but whilst this must be regarded as a wild
opinion, moderate men will admit that £776 worth of intoxicating
fluid in two years is rather too much for any infant but an infant

THE CLIENTS OF ST. ANN.
WE earnestly beseech all those of our readers who have more money
than they know what to do with, to subscribe as much as ever they can
afford to a Charitable Institution which seems to have been bountifully
provided on purpose to ºgº the operation of the Income-Tax. This
is the “Royal Asylum of St. Ann's Society, affording home, clothing,
maintenance, and education to orphan and other necessitous children
of parents once in *. of any nation.” . Now that taxation
renders it very hard for commercial men, and almost impossible for
professional men, to provide for misfortune, the number of children
under the care of the Society amounts to 300. They are mostly the
children of parents once in affluent circumstances—of officers in the
Royal Navy—of officers in the Army—of clergymen, physicians, sur-
geons, and solicitors. Others are the children of once prosperous
merchants, farmers, or tradesmen.” Of the majority of such persons the
incomes die with them; those of all except the soldiers and sailors, and
some of the parsons, are very liable to cease, and then there is only
the workhouse for themselves, and for their children there would be
nothing but the national school, if it were not for St. Ann's Society.
This Asylum is almost entirely without endowment—supported, as
Mrs. Malaprop would say, by spontaneous, combustion. Its debt has
been reduced from £3,000 to £350. In order to wipe off its remaining
score, and extendits benefits—for what are 300 children to the number of
those who are qualified to share them *-its, committee are in hopes that
the opulent subscribers of Mr. Punch will also subscribe to the institu-
tion under their management, and induce many other millionnaires to
follow their example, observing that the sº the Royal Asylum
of St. Ann's Society is Edward Frederick Leeks, Esq., F.L.S., Solicitor,
2, Walbrook, E.C., to whom “all communications may be addressed.”
People whosend the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, conscience-
money for Income-Tax unpaid, that is of course people with permanent
incomes, who feel that they Qught to have paid more in proportion than
}. earning their bread, had much better send the difference to MR.
EEks, on account of St. Ann's Society.
MILTON ILLUSTRATED.
THE POPE has received from Lyons the not unacceptable sum of
300,000 francs, which had been cºa there under the title of St.
Peter's Pence. The above collection is considerably more than a third
greater than the sums collected in the same town for the famishing
operatives. . A correspondent, who has assumed for the occasion the
signature of WALTER SAVAGE LANDoR, writes to say that PIUs, when
he pocketed the munificent offering, was both charmed and chagrined:
charmed, to have at his disposal so comfortable a sum of *. and
chagrined at the thought ºdepriving of it such a large number of poor,
who had so much a better right to it. . In short, our correspondent
says that the PQPE, on the occasion alluded to, was a charming living
illustration of the two beautiful, though opposite, poems—the Allegro,
and the Penseroso.
LE VERITABLE “opéRA comique.”
WE read that HERR, WAGNER is about to compose a comic opera—
music, and words. . We agree with our facetious gontemporary, the
Musical World, that we never heard an opera of WAGNER's yet that
was not more, or less, comic. In fact, so intensely comic is he, that he
might, with perfect harmony of justice, be called the original “Jol.I.Y
WAg(gº)Nº. ” As this gentleman's music is said to belong to “The
Future,”—and as a Present it is not worth having—we sup-
pose he generally gets it executed by the celebrated Band of “Hope?”

THE HOOKS AND EYES OF CHARITY.
Charity covers a multitude of other people's rents, but somehow
finds it difficult to conceal those little fissures of her own, for which she
is so heavily rated. The mantle is comfortable and meat, but it takes a
handsome penny to fasten it. What with secretaries, pens, pads, an
rubber, collectors, board-rooms, board-men, coals and scuttles, printers,
charwomen, testimonials, toast-masters, vocalists, wax and tallow
chandlers, &c. &c. &c. &c., Charity is sorely pressed to make both
ends meet—and much as we feel for widows and orphans, we often
think that her hands are so, full of domestic troubles, that we can
scarcely marvel if she not only begins, but finishes her eleemosynary
mission at home. To get fire out ºf a flint you must hit it hard, and to
..elicit donations, your appeal must be striking. At first sight there
appears, but little difference between a mendicant who, to excite com-
miseration, mournfully embraces a pair of borrowed babies, and an
Institution which nurses a skinny schoolmaster with spindle shanks, and
a puffy barrister with water on the brain, to induce testamentary
relief; but there is a distinction, and a wide distinction, wide enough
to accommodate hundreds who every day fall into the gap, with their
eyes serenely closed.
Swift, in his humane proposition to relieve the destitution of his
country by making a banquet of its juvenile population, showed great
but pardonable ignorance. The philanthropist in fact swallowed up
the philosopher. He saw a mass of misery, and he felt nervously
anxious to dispose of it, as an alderman would a dish of whitebait.
Jupy, his cook, could have taught him better. Did she sweep out the
refuse of the culinary stores, or did she carefully collect the adipose
remnants, and by a process of alchemy well known to her order, trans-
are there not legendary bonds of affection between coal tar and our
ost exquisite dyes P Are not old horse-nails of priceless value for gun
mute them into refined gold P. Is not the aristocratic Eau de Cologne
of JEAN MARIA FARINA more than suspected of a plebeian origin; and
metal? Who, then, will profanely declare that penury has not its
mission, and that destitution is a bore—an excrescence—an imprac-
ticable cruz—when by judicious management it can be made to brighten
a secretary's smile, or soften a treasurer's †† squeeze
But cavillers will say, is the mantle made for the fastenings, or the
fastenings for the mantle? How do we know?. What man pontem-
plating the topsy-turviness of things upon this dim spot called Earth,
would unhesitatingly affirm that hats were made for heads, and not
heads for hats. §. Joe, of Tylney Hall, was firmly of opinion
that had he been apprenticed to a hatter, people would have been
without a capital ornament. . Probably mantles are made for hooks and
eyes—at all events, if there is any doubt about it, let us be charitable
and not put the easy-cushioned almoner on short commons, simply
because a posse of sharp-set travellers are clamoring and kicking at the
refectory doors.

LATEST INTELLIGENCE OF TO-MORROW.
THE ROMAN DIFFICULTY.
WE, expect very soon to read in the morning journals
the following extracts from the Moniteur, among—
REUTER’s TELEGRAMs.
PARIs. This Day.
Discussions, arrested by interpellations of which the
continuance is admissible in the presence of legislative
necessities, have precipitated the solution of the Roman
question. .
The j". of facts, demands the adoption of measures
which have for their object the consolidation of the
Kingdom of Italy on a basis of security to the Holy See.
The populations of the Roman, States will be invited to
declare by universal suffrage their choice between perma.
nence under their existing government, and incorporation
with the Italian Kingdom.
. Should their vote be the preference of continued sub-
jection to existing authority, which claims to dominate
them under divine sanctions by a paternal yolition, nego-
tiations will be at once initiated for defining the respec-
tive limits of Italy and the popedom.
If they shall elect solidarity with the Italian people, sti-
pulations will be effected for the formation of arrange-
ments which will assure the independence of the Holy See,
and the stability of the Chair of Peter,
In either case the French troops will immediately evacu-
ate Rome. -
The accomplishment, of these decisions will terminate
a situation which could, not be prolonged without the
negation of just demands, and the disturbance of con-
sciences, continually, giving rise to grave complications,
of which it would be difficult to find a pacific solution.
“Playing with Fire.”
WITH £600,000,000 worth of property at stake in
London, it does seem to us that our present insufficient
organisation of the Fire Brigade system is (to borrow
the title of MR. JoHN BROUGHAM’s comedy) literally
Playing with Fire.
DISCOURAGEMENT FOR DUELLISTS.
MY DEAR LORD PALMERSTON,
You would oblige me ". much by taking, the necessary
measures to frustrate the attempt which some blockheads of influential
position are now making to revive the custom of duelling.
But for your judicious bottle-holding we might have just had a gen-
tleman, a statesman, and one of your own principal colleagues, shot by
a member of the Pope's Brass Band, for calling things and persons
their right, names. Or the gentleman, the statesman, the British
minister, might have had the misfortune to shoot the representative of
absolute Popery; and, such is the respect of the law for even the least
valuable form of human life, have consequently been involved in the
dreadful anxiety of a trial for murder, and even have incurred the
penalty of that crime.
An officer in a crack Dragoon regiment has lately been .# a
trial by Court Martial, on a nominal charge which is really neither
more nor less than an indictment for not having, fought a duel. The
W. in this case have been nearly as long as those in the
INDHAM affair—and let me, suggest that a commission de lunatico
inquirendo might, with great justice, be issued both on the prosecutors
and the tribunal, and the corps in question, which appears to be not
only a “crack,” but also a crazy regiment.
A fool has just been shot through the head by another fool near
Strasbourg; as you saw in the Courrier du Bas Rhin. The shot hit
him over the left eye; “he uttered a piercing cry and fell dead.” But
for yourself, some English solitude might have resounded the other
day with a similar cry—or with an Irish howl.
Circumstances which, of late years, have evoked a martial spirit
have also in some degree simultaneously evoked or developed the old
evil, spirit of ferocious gentlemanlike, ruffianism... This is trying hard
to have its way; it would if it could, it will if it can, and it will
#: the best and wisest fellow at the mercy of any reckless fool,
lackguard, and bully, who may choose, to insult him and put him
: the necessity of defending his honour at the peril of his
existence.
Juries have only to refuse to convict duellists indicted for murder, in
order to empower your crack dragoon officers, and your Irish brigadiers,
to restore the code of false chivalry, and enable every fireater amongst
them to present a pistol at the head of the worthiest. person, and
demand his honour or his life. The formation of a public opinion in
favour of duelling ought to be checked at once. - - -
I wish you would tell your ATTORNEY GENERAL to bring in a Bill,
rendering the mere act of fighting, or aiding and abetting in, a duel, a
crime punishable by penal servitude, and subjecting any º;
conveying, or accepting, a challenge to a heavy fine, and imprisonment
with }. labour of long continuance, in the House of Correction;
If you have this law made, the result of it, will be that gentlemen
betrayed into the use of unjustifiable words will be enabled to apologise
for them with unquestionable credit, whilst snobs who refuse to retract
insolent language will be †. from ...; -
May it please your Lordship to think over the above project of a law
to prevent duelſing, respectfully proposed to your consideration by
your Lordship's almost constant supporter,

lin against the QUEEN.
SIR. Robert PEEL
took an opportunity,
in a recent debate, to
scarify the said O'D.
and his friends, de-
scribing them as Man.
mikin Traitors, and de-
yoid of respectability.
The species of which
the O'D. is a type
cannot s , as 18
well known to the
megroes and other
naturalists, but can fight. So the O'D., in order to show that he was nota Mannikin
raitor, and was highly respectable, sought to murder SIR. Robert PEEL, and sent
to him Mºor. Gavin, who being Member for fimerick, celebrated for gloves, was
a fitting person to throw down the glove to Pº. But vigilat nostrá semper in
ºde Lar, and the PREMIER, whose sleep is more wakeful than most folks' staring,
foresaw the coming row, wrote to PEEL to refer the accomplice to him, and the
astounded Gavin was handed over accordingly to PAM. The PREMIER scoffed at
the idea of a duel, and coolly informed the Meejor that the matter would be
brought before the House, whose privilege of speech had been violated. To-night
PAM mentioned the business, and of course there was an end of it, save that the
O'Donaghue, for once inspired with eloquence, like the horse of Aghulles, did
manage to say one thing that Mr. Punch heartily endorses, although it had nothing
whatever to do with the occasion on which it was delivered. He said,
“I am perfectly well aware that the ancient mode of arbitrament has fallen into disuse; but if
it has, those unseemly manners that rendered italmost necessary have also disappeared. (cheers.)”
Now, judicial severity when an offender is denounced does not come into the
category of º manners,” and the º: Secretary for Ireland was
bound to use the mºst effective language in condemning a would-be rebel. But the
above speech is, abstractedly, a sensible one, and gives us hope that the being
who could make it will one day improve himself, as MR. DARwin might say, into
positive Rationality. .. - -
A yery important discussion on the Navy Estimates occupied the House till
midnight. Loºp CLARENCE PAGET says that our Fleet is in splendid gondition.
He had better keep it so, for M. DE Boissy, in the French Senate, declares that
England ought to be, invaded by France, and he has a great mind to do it himself.
To be sure the French Senate laughed at him, but he may attack us for all that.
Tuesday...The EARL or DERby usually shows himself a Keen Party; but
aliquando Homerus. It is customary with divers writers, whose minds are more
emotional than accurate, to pounce upon any newspaper paragraph or letter that
alleges agrievance, to pour out aflood of indignation thereament, and to be unkindly
laughed at, when, after a few days, the real facts come out...To wait for inquiry
would spºil, the gush of vituperation. But people who call themselves States.
men should know better. Loºp DERBY, who can read Italian, saw in a Neapolitan
aper a statement that a proclamation of a most savage character had been put
orth in Naples, and so to-night he gave notice of a question on the subject, and
on Thursday he fired º good stores of indignation against a Government that
could issue such a brutal, menace. EARL Russel L requested time to inquire.
Having inquired, he was able to state, on Friday that such a proclamation had
been put forth by an inſerior officer, and that the instant his superiors knew of it,
they had cancelled it. The explanation was perfectly satisfactory, and LoRD DERby
might have waited for it, and saved a speech. But it may be observed that the
Duke of ARGYLL, with that excess of zeal peculiar to subordinates, and not much
admired by the late M. DE TALLEYRAND, took upon himself to dash out with the
information, that the paper was a mere copy of an old paper.
of 1810, and that it was too absurd to suppose it referred
to the present time. For the which Zeal you may be sure
the Lord of DERby did not forget, when the explanation
came, to give the Duke a pleasing little box on his ducal
car.
The Bores are making desperate efforts to protect them-
selves against the natural hostility of the House. To-night
MR. BENTINck of Norfolk tried to carry a motion for
discouraging the Count Out, by printing the name of the
Member whº does that service to humanity. No, no,
thank you, BENTINck, said the House emphatically, that

IR. LINDsay elicited a promise from Sir GeoRae
Lewis to endeavour to improve the Transport Service,
and MR. DANBY SEYMoun of Poole (N.B. copy the ad.
dress) proposed a resolution in favour of Consolidating the
Ecclesiastical Law. SIR. Roundell PAIMER resisted
this, but pledged the Government to partial action upon
the subject.
...Government then indulged themselves in the luxury of a
little defeat. Mr. Cowper was compelled to withdraw
his Bill for cutting a road through Kensington Gardens.
The Nymphs thereof, who had very º began to be
ululant, may now use their pocket-handkerchiefs.
Jºſednesday, MR, ADFIELD's Bill, for taking away from
Visiting Justices the power of whipping criminals, came on
for Second Reading. It was opposed, except as to one
portion, by SIR. George GREY. The accomplished’AppleLp
made a singularly wise observation, as might be expected.
He said that, whipping was a punishment inflicted on the
children of the poor, and not on the children of the rich.
This will be news to the poor people who send their sons
to Eton and Harrow, #. Punch begs º to state
that he has an undying enmity to the system of corporal
º save under certain exceptional circumstances,
ut he disclaims the alliance of reformers who talkmonsense.
MR, 'AppleLoad tº withdrore the hintended Hact.
Our Cºx made a little speech on a Bill for improving our
Metropolitan Local Management, and urged the desirability
of still further lowering the qualification for Westryman.
Our Cox thinks that a man's being rated is enough to
constitute him a parochial Senator. Considering what
qualifications our Cox has found sufficient to obtain the
votes of 4556 electors in a Parliamentary, contest, it is
not remarkable that he should think anybody good enough
to be a Westryman.
Gºvernment then indulged themselves in the luxury of
another little defeat. The taste for luxury grows with
indulgence. The Bill making it unlawful for a candidate
to cºnvºy voters to the poll was thrown out by 160 to 130.
MR, 'Apprelp gained a little victory. His Bill for
abºlishing the declaration by corporate officials that the
will not destrºy the Church of Hingland was carried by 14
to 127. The declaration is as ridiculous as its abolitionis
Animpºrtant. All such declarations, from the Coronation
Oath downwards, are now expounded by the light of com:
mon sense and conscience. But it is as well to get rid of
absurdities, and so the mover “shall be Jack again"—
or rather Hºrrºp, until his next offence against SIR

one of MR. Zadkiel-URIEL-RAPHAEL-Cumming Punch's
Prophecies was fulfilled. The CHANGELuoh brought in, as
redicted by Mr. Punch, a Bill for Amending the Law of
unacy.
1st. MR. SAMUEL WARREN and gentlemen of his
station are no longer to have their souls vexed
with Lunacy investigations, as such matters are
to be handed over to the consideration of the
sterner Judges of the Land.

eginning of the inquiry instead of the end thereof,
according to the present lunatic practice.
3rdly. The doctors are not to be sent for, except when
other evidence as to facts cannot be had, and then
they are to swear as to what they know, instead of
delivering highly improving and scientific lectures
on the theory of insanity.

of Proverbial, Philosophy, the investigation is to extend over
Two years only—the two years preceding the inquiry.
These propositions were favourably, received by the Law Lords.
Reference was of course made to the Windham Case, touching which
LoRD ST. LEONARDs sweetly remarked, in defence of the proceedings
therein, that “It was a matter of perfect indifference to the Court
whether MR. WINDHAM were ruined or not; all that could be regarded
was the due administration of justice.” A nobler and more philosophic
observation, was made by Mr. Punch, who, observed that, perhaps,
Lunacy Reform was the Final Cause of Windham.
Wicked Gloucester, having been once more permitted to elect Mem-
bers, showed its gratitude by giving the Liberals a sensation which
they have not had for a long time, mamely, that of victory. An
Honourable BERKELEY and MR. J. J. Powell, were returned, after a
good battle. Wicked Wakefield, however, did not follow the liberal
example, but elected SIR. J. D. HAY, a Conservative. The North
Riding and Canterbury have now each to choose a man, so our elegant

A long squabble followed as to when the Education Question should

Nayy Estimates. And then a Bill which demands respectful mention,
and which every one will desire to see passed as rapidly as possible.
An immense number of Commissions require the Royal Signature. The
hand that relieved the QUEEN from this drudgery, can relieve her no
longer, and it is proposed to render the sign-manual unnecessary.
Friday. EARL, RussBLL said that MR. SEwARD did not mean to sink

LoRD LYONs, that though the Blockade is frequently, broken, there
is no present intention to consider it as ineffective. Perhaps, when the
Ninety Days that are to extinguish the Southern Confederacy have
run out, we shall hear more on this subject. Just now, the White

MR. MILNER GIBSON stated that we were not engaged in any negotia-

it appears that drainage is looked upon as a sort of

stigmatised as “drainists.” The word occurs also in the

“They ought to pass a very strong resolution on this matter.”
So they did; and Winchester is the stronghold of anti-

The motion for inquiring into the possibility of draining
Winchester, will perhaps to most minds, less nearly re-
semble an attempt to get, in the thin cmd., of the wedge
than an endeavour to introduce the thick end of the broom.
We wish we could present the world with a portrait of the
gentleman who was not going to be diddled into drain-
age, and who admits that a partial drainage might be done
for convenience, mind, but not on account of health. Fancy
might depict him in a fossilised state—a Megatherium, if
that Great Beast were discoverable in the Winchester
chalk formation. That chalk, if the Town Council of
Winchester would allow itself to be diddled into drainage,
might perhaps be considerably enriched by those treasures
which now waste their sweetness on , the Winton air,

hose laurels are new, as his pedigree’s ould !
From his father's demesnes, where a beautiful babby
He played in the iligant halls of Knock-Abbey—
From the fields of his prowess on Italy's marches—
He brings you his valour, his voice, and his vartues.
Will Erin forget all he said and he done?
The Brigade that he dthrilled—and the pace that they run ?
How like wather their blood for the Pope it was spilt,
Yet—thanks to the Saints—sorra’ one of them kilt 1
How long widout rations—not e'en a potato—
Three hundred to thousands, they held out Spoleto:
Wid’ all the Sardinian big guns at 'em blazin',
And poundin' away, in a manner amazin’.
Such a chief as O'REILLY it’s idle to seek—
Not LEONIDAs' self—that immortal ould Greek;
To whom Godless Colleges give the monopoly
Of glory 'ginst odds, in the sthraits of Thermopoly.
More by token LEONIDAs wasn't a Grecian,
But like Myles O'Reilly, a raal ould Milesian:
And the best Maynooth scholars has settled that, only
For base Saxon thricks, he’d be known as “Molony.”
O’REILLY's three hundred—it’s proved clare as print—
From the boys of Thermopoly tuk their descint;
But more 'cute, Hof the Greek, the three hundther all bled,
Whin not one of the Oirish got knocked on the head.

So they upped every man the Sardinians floored,
As brave as a Lion, as bould as a Lord!

Calls their valour all bletherumskyte, brags and loyes;
But if Saxons saw miracles, how would they know 'em.”
More by token, the Saints they would ne'er stoop to show 'em.
Then it's up wid’ O’REILLY and down wid the scoffers!

To the Saxons a curse, to Sardinia a rope,

Oh, bad cess to the Saxon—his scoffs and his menaces !

The Pope wants more mimbers—we'll soon gure that want if
You'll act like good sons of that ill-used ould Pontiff.
The Saxons would broibe you wid wages and work:
To timpt you to college and school-house they lurk;
Of your grievances rob you, till none you’ve to show,
Any more than the sthranger that thramples you low !
But prove to them Erin has made ": her moind. -

“A large number of persons, nearly all women, placed under our charge by their

“Dypsomania, or the peculiar form of insanity brought on in many constitutions
by long indulgence in intoxicating liquors, is now frequently spoken of among
medical men as requiring a mode of treatment not hitherto adopted. While the
duty of providing infirmaries for the sick and asylums for the insane has been uni-
versally recognised, it is remarkable that for this class of patients, whose
condition is equally urgent, no public provision of any kind has been . Let

no one be startled at the idea of habitually intemperate persons bein
the sick and insane. The opinion of the whole medical º, is decided upon this
subject, and the truth is at length being forced upon the community at large. If
the love of intoxicating drink, especially ardent spirits, shall have obtained an
ascendency over a mºn, it is well known that no consideration whatever will keep
him from it. . He becomes incapable of managing his own affairs, careless of the
obligations of social life, and, in fact, as mad as, often more so than any inmates of b
a lunatic asylum. He may attempt his own life, he may put the lives of his family
in daily jeopardy, and this for years; but the law does not recognise it as a case for
compulsory seclusion. Philanthropy, even, has not as yet stepped forward to offer a
refuge. Strange to say, he is allowed to run his course, just as if to destroy him-
self, to bring his family to destitution, to leave his wife a burden upon the parish,
and to train up his children, thieves, beggars, or worse, were a matter of stern
necessity and by no means to be interfered with.”

the disease, and while they are themselves so conscious of their danger, as be

“Some few private asylums exist where individuals are boarded at considerable
cost, under more or less surveillance; but no public institution offering due security.
The directors of the House of Refuge proposed a few years ago to establish an
asylum of the kind, within the boundary ºil. of the Queensberry House premises,
for women in respectable circumstances (such an establishment for men ought to be
placed in the country), and opened a subscription for that purpose. The scheme
was approved at a public meeting; but the committee have not succeeded in raising
the sum required to enable them to commence operations. In the meantime our
limited accommodation º: us to refuse numerous most distressing applica-
tions. It is proposed to call the new building (which would be cut off from the
House of Refuge, and have an entrance of its own) the Queensbe Lodgings. It
will be simply a retreat, uniting safe custody, the best daily medical aid, kind treat-
ment, and cheerful employment, where the intem te member of a household
may be placed (with her own consent) for the purpose of reformation, or even simple
security. The large j. of the directors and officers of the House of Refuge
in this class of cases exten over so long a period enables them to proceed with
confidence in the proposed undertaking. $º. #º is only money to build
and furnish. Once erected, the institution will wholly self-sustaining. The
sum in hand is somewhat more than £1,600. A few hund more would justify
them in commencing operations. I earnestly hope that the scheme will commend
itself to the notice of philanthropic individuals who have both the will and the
means to promote such an object.”
“When I come to read this ear BILL says to me says, he, i wonders

sat sometime at the “Green Lying” before they read the “Noosépaper.”
It appears to us a rather beery supposition to think that “public

stated that at the Queensberry Lodgings, the inmates will be furnished
with “cheerful employment,” we think the inference is clear, that the
will have in some way to work for their own, livelihood, a fact whic
would in our opinion very much increase the claim of any Charity for

tice, his Holiness's Government has behaved in a very liberal manner
with regard to the Great Exhibition. It has, so a credible, letter from
me says, admitted all foreign artists or artificers established there tº
the advantages offered to native Romans, insomuch that “they will
have their works conveyed to London at the expense of the Roman
Government, exhibited, and, if unsold, brought back to the residence
or studio of the exhibitor without costing him a bajocco.” Handsome
is that handsome does; and there is a light in which, we are happy to
recognise in the Holy Father a Fº: old gentleman., , ,
ow ugly by the side of the Pope and ANTONELLI led in that
light, appear the British Commissioners! The authority already
quoted further states that “PRINGE ToRLoNIA has decided at the last
moment not to send his splendid plate, because the Commissioners
would not ensure its safe, return, or the value, into his hands.” The
wonder is that PRINCE Tokionis ever thought of sending his F. to
e shown at Brompton at all. That, is not the only wonder, use
it is still more wonderful that, the Commissioners should have
dreamt of supposing that he would do anything of the kind without
the most ample security for the loan of his property. Shabby! is
the exclamation which an idea at once so extravagant and so 8.
simonious will generally evoke. We caricature the Pope and, Car
dinals on the Fifth of November; but in the handsomeness of hand;
some doing his Holiness and their Eminences will cut fine figures in the
Exhibition of 1862, whilst the Commissioners will come out in the
character of Guys.

SHAKSPEARIUS RESTAURATUS.
A.MR. SAMUEL BAILEY has written a book On the Received Tert
of Shakspeare's Dramatic Writings and its Improvement. , MR. BAILEy,
like many other critics of logical and limited intellect, runs his
little head against that stone of offence to the correct dulness of
commentators, the “gross inconsistency,” as he calls it, in the famous
S :-
“Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them.”
Of this portion of the received text of SHAKSPEARE's dramatic
writings, MR. BAILEY proposes an improvement, which he thus
praises:–
“The emendation is not inferior in tone of thought or force of expression to what
it displaces, or to the context in which it is inserted. It does not relax the tension
of the soliloquy, notwithstanding its taking away what may be dear to the ear of
many an admirer, the sounding phrase, a sea of troubles."
MR. BAILEY may call a sea of troubles a sounding phrase, but others
who can iii. sense from sound feel it to be a grand metaphor.
How has “a sea of troubles” come to be a stock expression, MR.
BAILEY, if it is only a sounding phrase ?, There is doubtless a bull in
the figure of speech which makes a man think “to take arms against”
an enemy so very impersonal as “a sea of troubles; ” but would not a
bull be very likely to be made by anybody talking to himself in that
state of mind in which he would be when meditating the commission of
suicide? SHAKSPEARE's text, as it stands above, evinces a natural
confusion of fine ideas. As iºd by MARTINUs SCRIBLERUs—no,
by SAMUEL BAILEY, it stands thus:-
“Or, to take arms against the seat of troubles,
And, by a poniard, end them."
Quite correct. A great improvement on SHAKSPEARE, no doubt, in
the opinion of every stolid pedant. The play of Hamlet with the º
of Hamlet left out is matched by the speech of Hamlet divested of
Hamlet’s poetry.
O SAM BAILEY!—unfortunate SAM BAILEY!
ENGLAND'S ILL-WISHERS.
AMONG REUTER's telegrams the other day, there came from Paris
One, º; a speech in the Senate, which struck us with the force
of a flash of lightning, and we wonder that it had not produced on the
electric wire, through which it ran, the effect of fusion. According to
that thundering telegram:—
“M. DE Boissy regretted that France had assisted England in revenging herself
on the Chinese. He was of opinion that the money expended in the ea and in
Italy would have been better applied towards a descent upon England."
M. LE MARQUIs DE Boissy, is a violent, Ultramontane, and his
religion, or the passion of º: servility to the Pope which supplies
the place of it, is the cause of his hatred to England. It is that which
inspires him with the wish that we might be robbed and murdered.
There are perhaps too many gentlemen of M. DE Boissy's persuasion
in the French Senate, and certainly there are too many in the British
House of Commons, unless it may be said, that their ravings in either
assembly serve to disgust humanity with them and their cause. Should
MAJoR MYLEs O’REILLY be returned for Longford, we shall rejoice to
see him exhibit an exceptional rationality.
Why do the Ultramontanes detest England so bitterly P England has
not despoiled the Pope or persecuted his adherents in these times; has
allowed them to talk as much nonsense and sedition as they chose, and
in her foreign policy has carefully let the Holy Father alone, England
does not even enforce the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and there is no
other Act by which she can have given the Pope's people any offence.
The offence, however, which that Act has given them is mortal, no doubt
because it was a defeat which has greatly damaged Papal consequence
and credit in Europe., Political wiseacres sneer at the Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill and its authors, but Ultramontanes curse them.
A “SELECT" Joke.
WE hear that the Grand New Joint Stock Library Company have at
last selected their motto. It is Sic transit gloria Mudi.

There are some who will smile, and some who will be pained at learning that
Northumbrian miners resent the Punch caricatures which have caused so much
amusement. Of course we always endeavoured to ify our sensitive friends by
explaining that Punch illustrated life in Staffords not in the Northumbrian
mining districts. But usually this explanation was regarded as nothing more than
a kind ly attempt to heal the wounds of their self-love. ‘Ay, thee beest vara

COPYRIGHT IN THE COUNTENANCE.
The Lord Chief Baron the other day, summing up in MAYALL v.
HIGBY, thus laid down the law — y p
“It had been said that a man had a sort of copyright in his own face, and that if
he had his picture taken it could not be published without his consent ; but he
doubted if a person who could take the likeness of another, in the jury-box or wit:
º:#: instance, would not be at perfect liberty to publish it if he thought it
worth while.”
A man would have a . of his own face, and might be entitled
to an injunction against anybody for infringing it, if anybody could do so.
But there seems no method by which it would be possible for one man
to pirate another man's face, and publish it. A book accurately
pirated is the same as the original, but no º of a face can be equal to
the face itself. . A frontispiece may be pirated, but a frontispiece is not
a face, except in the dialect of pugilism. The thief who steals your
works can mutilate them and hurt you, but no º: can rob you of
i. face and cut off your nose, by cutting off that of the face which he
as stolen. If a man is not the author of his own face how can he
claim any copyright in it? . It is true he may make a face, but there is
no law to hinder anybody else from making another like it, or else one
clown in a pantomime might sue another zany for copying his grimages
and grinning like himself. If, on the other hand, a man composes his
countenance, that circumstance alone does not give or tend to give him
any º: therein, unless he composes it in order to have alikeness
of it taken, and gets that from the artist who produces it, and in whom
alone is ºft. yested all possible copyright in faces. ...A caricaturist
can take of a man's face against his will without being liable to indict-
ment for so doing, nor would any assault be committed in damaging
anyone's face, except in damaging the face with which he was born,
although a person damaging another's face anyhow might be liable for
amageS.
Grounds for Tenderness.
THE Ex-QUEEN OF NAPLEs may be occasionally a little wild and
eccentric in many of her pranks, such as beating servants, horsewhipping
menials, shooting cats, and the like; but still, we should not be too
hard upon her. If her Majesty is a little flighty now and then in
her head, we should make every generous allowance for one who is
still labouring under the loss of her crown. Where is the head, pray
royal or otherwise, that would be exactly sound, having lost its crown?

WIVE LA GAETA
WE notice that some English ladies of high distinction, sympathising
with the Ex-QUEEN of NAPLEs, have presented her with a testimonial
in the form of a turret-shaped diadem, that was intended to be “em-
blematical of Gaeta.” We should have thought ourselves that
something adapted for masculine use would have been more acceptable
to her deposed . A diadem is an ornament that ladies generall
wear, and it is well-known that, MARIE SoPHIE AMELIE is above, suc
petty effeminate weaknesses. Now if our aristocratic sisters had pre-
sented the manly wiſe of FRANCIS THE SEcond with a brace of gold
º or a silver cigar-case, or a jewelled dog-collar, or a diamond
ilted riding-whip, or a beautifully-enriched poniard, we could have
understood the meaning of the offering. There would have been point
and purpose in the testimonial. There would have been both utility
and ornament combined. But where is the object of giving a diadem
to one who has lost her crown. It looks as though there was a rim of
mockery round the gift. However, we are pleased beyond expression
to find, so universal has the practice of charity become, so extended is
the range of benevolence in the present day towards the very meanest
things, that there are actually human beings who can find sympathy
and heart-tribute for a Bourbon' It will be FRANCIs’ turn next, of
course—and we do not even despair of the KING, of DAHQMEY being

shouldn't go unrewarded.
AN OILY CANDIDATE FOR ROYALTY.
A MR. BERTRON, who resides in the Département of the Seine (or
Insane, rather, as the reader will presently exclaim), has put himself
forward in opposition to the ARchi UKE MAXIMILIAN, as a candidate
for the throne of MonTEzuy A. . In his electioneering address, which he
has just published to the “Mexicans,” he says naively enough:—
“I have been told that you absolutely want a King. If you do, take me. [That's
cool ') I am not of royal race. I am only a propriétaire of Sceaux [there seems a
slight contradiction here, for we do not see how the Sot and the Sane can be possibly
combined in the same department], and extract Oil from the Filth of Paris.”
The only things we know “cktracted from the filth of Paris.”
are French novels and romances. That oil could be got out of the
gutter is certainly to us a completely new extract from the “Mysteries
of Paris.” We suspect that MR. BERTRON is himself only a romance-

THE LOVE OF COMPARISON.
ThE Americans are seemingly fond of com-
parisons. We are told by the Times, corre-
spondent, that it is no wonder they should be so.
He asks:—
“Why should they not measure by the standard of the
Old World, from which they came, the men and deeds
of that New World, which, as yet, has created no standard
of its own 2"
We will not talk of standards, but just now
they haven’t even a flag of their own. The one
they once had is now rent in two. The “Star-
spangled Banner” is shorn at present of many of
its stars and spangles. Jon AthAN should look
to our Union Jack. Leave off fighting, make
it up, and try to have a Union.”
. However, JonATHAN is welcome to measure
himself by our standard as much as he pleases,
but so long as he does not behave better than he
has lately done, we must beg that he will not
think of reducing us to his.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MARCH 3. Monday. LoRD CRAN worth, whose motto is Post nubila
Phabus, came out like Apollo from behind his cloud, and proceeded to
throw such light as he could upon the subject of Conveyancing Reform.
PHOEBUs. CRAN worTH had his plan, which is to enable every person who
has the fee simple in land to get a declaration of his title to such fee
simple by paying a simple fee to the Court of Chancery. . He then
shone out a second time, with a Bill for the Security of Purchasers, by
which, on the principle on which a Magistrate, marks (not half often
eno º a cabinan's conviction on the back of his licence, it is enacted that
any dealing with the property shall be noted on the aforesaid Chancery
declaration. Then came Lord CHELMSFORD with his plan, which is to
create a Landed Estates Court, to consist of eminent conveyancers, and
he also proposes a º which of course he thinks is a better
one than that of LoRD WESTBURY. The CHANCELLOR did not coincide in
that opinion, and º the two ex-Chancellors for endeavouring to
undermine his Bills while they puffed their own. LoRD KINGSDown
made, as usual, a sensible remark, condemning the system that paid a
conveyancer, not for the artistic skill he was called upon to exhibit, but
by the len ñof the deeds which he perpetrated. Finally, Six out of the
Seven Bills on this subject were referred to a Select Committee. LoRD
PUNCH feels that one of these days it will fall to his lot to settle this
uestion, and he intends upon º occasion to follow the precedent of
the good and great Pantagruel, when he ended the controversy between
the two Lords, whose quarrel had occupied “a rabble of old lawyers for
six and forty weeks.” And he doubts not that the result of the deci;
sion will be, similar, and that “the counsellors and all the learned
doctors in the law will be so ravished with admiration at the more
than human wisdom of Pantagruel Punch, as to fall into a trance and
sudden ecstacy and to remain so for three hours, until revived with
* and rosewater.” However, let the Committee try its hand
SU.
In the Commons the Church-Rate fight was #. oned until the 14th
May, which is the anniversary of the Battle of º, where, as MR.
Cox. rightly supposes, Hexameters were first used as weapons of
conflict. R. LAYARD stated that the Moors at Tangiers had, on
demand of the American Consul there, arrested two persons who had
landed from the Southern pirate vessel the Sumter, and had let them go
again; but the special object of the operation was not expounded.
French and feminine influences have upset the BARON RICAsoLI, and
SIGNOR RATAzzi is the Italian Premier. So, of course, it is the
business of journalists to show that the man who could not succeed in
keeping his º was unfit for it. As Punch, like true Thomas, suffers
(unfortunately for a good many persons) under a total inability to say
untrue things, he observes, on this passage of history, that BARON
RucAsoLI is a perfectly honourable, ſº stern, i. nobleman,
and just the personage to be insufferably objectionable in the circle
whence he has been extruded. But he will be wanted again when the
wind gets up.
Army matters were then discussed, and as Materfamilias may like to
have a figure or two to poke in the face of Paterfamilias, when, duly
instructed by his journal, he is pompous, at breakfast about our “mag-
nificent military establishments, my dear,” that lady, whose aſſifi.

last-mentioned sum, and say whether you see the prettiness of that
penny. The House of Commons sees it, and voted 145,450 men to
spend a good deal of it in soldiering. And ifr, Punch is afraid that we
can’t do the work, and protect your teacups and geraniums from a
hostile world, for a less figure. MR. WHITE proposed to knock off Ten
Thousand men, but instead of causing a Retreat of the Ten Thousand, he
had to retreat himself, in a very dilapidated condition, at the head of
select party of Eleven—who fled before an overwhelming force of 139.
A strong appeal was made in behalf of the Volunteers, for whom
some Government aid was asked, in consideration of the heavy expenses
they were obliged to incur. MR. Buchan AN, of Glasgow, declared that
unless Government did something speedily, there would be a i.
diminution of the Volunteer force. Governments have often made
strange nautical blunders, but the worst they make is when, as too
often is the case, they spoil a ship to save a haporth of tar.

Tuesday. EARL DERBY, in remarking on some legal redundancies in but surly the Legislature cannot think itself included in that defini-
a law #ff. modestly described himself as “an unlearned person.” Altion. It abolishes itself, however, on Ash-Wednesday.
nobleman who can read Italian newspapers, and can translate Odes of
HoRACE into elegant English verse—he call himself unlearned Eh,
MR. Cox * hº were quite proud of our Learning, weren't us, the day
we found out that the Bill of Rites was not the Act of Uniformity.
But the unlearned DERBY made the lawyers cut away the superfluous
bosh, which turned out to be “words of explanation,” and of course
darkened the business. ---
We don't spend, all our money in soldiers, Mrs. Materfamilias.
Government gives about £800,000 a-year in aid of education; that is to
say, a good deal less than a sixteenth part of the Army expendure.
And recently there has been an endeavour to render this expenditure
more profitable. The Education Scheme is a teaser, M'm, for those
well-informed young men who come to your dinner parties, and talk so
fluently about everything, to the admiration of dear BLANCHE and
LAURA. It is a subject that cannot be got up by a rapid glance at the
speeches during one's after-breakfast weed. And you may have re-
marked, though you were too good-natured to notice it, how poor
Augustus CAcKLEBY, who tried a little confident talk on the matter,
at dinner on Tuesday, was floored by that reverend and grim country
parson, M.R. GRUBBERY SHRURBERY, who is compelled to comprehend
the whole business. Gussy made a gallant bolt of it with that joke about
ºther and a young lady's Eyes, but the table adjudged him
Sat upon.
To-night, M’m, the Bishop of Oxford delivered a large speech
upon the subject, and without boring you with details, or pretending
to mean to coach.MASTER AUGUSTU's for his next dinner, we may
mention that the Bishop attacked the Reform which, the Government
have sought to bring about. The plain English of the matter is, that
we have ludicrously neglected the Three R's in our laudable British
zeal for a Fourth. We have not managed to insert much Reading,
'Riting, or 'Rithmetic into the children of the poor, but we:-all denomi-
nations—have worked hard at something which is called Religion, but
which does not approach the noble thing which that word should
mean. So, when the Schools are examined, we find the children ex-
tremely intimate with JEhos APHAT, but on distant terms with Cock ER,
MAvor and CARSTAIRs. This awkwardness, and a variety of evils
that help to produce it, Government tries to do away, and , of
course battle is given y º who are—many of them—thoroughly
in earnest in their belief that the old system works well. The Bisho
made himself their mouthpiece, and was very eloquent, and not at |
convincing. There is to be much debating over the matter, before the
Amended Revised Code is finally accepted, but we think, M'm, that
you will observe that the Reform is in the right direction, and a
sensible woman, like yourself, cannot fail to perceive the necessity of
carefulness in education—thank }. M’m, a little more sugar.
MR. CowPER stated that he had denied a site near St. Margaret's
Church to some persons who wished to erect there a statue of the late
Joseph Locke, the engineer. Considering that, as MR. CHARLEs
KNIGHT, remarks in his invaluable Cyclopædia, “MR. Locke's name
must hold a chief place in any record of the development of our Rail-
way system during the last }. of a century,” it does not much
matter whether an official refuses or denies any particular corner for a
statue to such a man; but a more appropriate locality might easily be
selected than the gardens in which CowPER's Winter Morning's W.
is taken., M.R. LAYARD stated that a miscreant who had fi'i an
English doctor at Pisa would be duly dealt with by the authorities, and
that a Sardinian captain who had wopped a Maltese editor had been
fined ; in each case BARON RICAsoll behaving as might be expected.
The first offender, ought to be º abbreviated, but we should
like to know a little more about the second case, in which one DEBONo
was the beaten *. brutality is detestable, but some of the
Maltese are brutal slanderers.
Then came a goodish bit of Anti-ultramontane spite. Maynooth had
sent an address of condolence on the late national loss. MR, WHALLEY
demanded whether SIR RoPERT PEEL had ascertained that this
was not a *ś, as from Maynooth's notorious disloyalty (in proof
of which MR. WHALLEY cited a song sung by the students), it was
not probable that the College would express itself properly on such an
occasion. SIR ROBERT merely vouched for the genuineness of the
document, but MR. BERNAL Osbor NE, with no great felicity, attempted
to rebuke the querist, and on a subsequent ni f had to correct nearly
every one of his own allegations about MR. WHALLEy. But the latter
should not air, upon needless occasions, the mantle which has descended
to him from Mi. SPOONER—the moths are annoying.
An interesting debate followed on the question whether BRITANNIA
ought not to expect such of her colonies as have grown up, to defend
themselves, instead of relying on her, and a resolution to the effect that
at all events they ought to assist in their own external defence, was
agreed to. MR. Locke KING then got Counted Out.
Hºdnesday was the anniversary day on which by order of GREGoRY
THE GREAT there used to be a sprinkling of ashes, as a commencement
of Lent. The day was called the Dies Cinerum, or Ash-Wednesday.
The ashes were abolished at the Reformation as being “a vain show,”
Thursday. The Bavarian Wick, which the Powers took so much trouble
to stick into Greece, is in a splutter, and may probably fº a bad
odour. That is to say, many of OTHQ's subjects and soldiers are in
insurrection. If the two parties would extirpate each º: Pan
were not dead, it would be an elegant thing to restore the old temples
and altars, and fit up Greece as Classical and Mythological Gardens
for the recreation of mankind. And we would make * * * * *
the Curator, because he is the Greatest Heathen we know. Whom do
we mean? Find out.
Army Estimates, and good debates thereon, in the course of which
LoRD PALMERSTON º as detailed and practical an explanation of
certain defects in the Armstrong gun, and their remedies, as SIR
WILLIAM himself could have given, and if PAM had not a perpetual
retainer from Us, and had not bound himself to write for no other
journal, we should have thought that he composed the narrative which
appeared in the Times about the demolition of the Fairbairn target at
|. ess. SIR GEORGE Lewis was facetious about “large bores
and small bores,” and said that experiments with both were then going
on, at which the Committee laughed. Later the Government were less
facetious, receiving a defeat, by 81 to 53, and being compelled to knock
£10,000 off the estimate for Sandhurst Čollege, SElwy N, Member
for the Cambridge Colleges, leading the attack.
MR. Cowper asked for and got £2000 to make a temporary Road
across Hyde Park. It is for Exhibition purposes, and the Van Demons
are not to use it, but all yehicles carrying human beings to the Show
may. The vote was carried by 78 to 28.
Friday. The Education Question was again raised in the Lords, this
time by Lord LYTTLETON, a thoughtful and scholarly noble who has
#." much attention to the subject. His was a very different oration
rom the showy, gushy harangue of the Bishop, and he dealt in no
wholesale commination. He was answered by LoRD GRAN VILLE, and
ultimately withdrew the resolutions he had proposed. The best and
shortest answer to all objections to the Reform is in the facts that out
of 15,952 existing schools only 6897 are aided, and that only a fourth of
the children in these aided schools are re ucated in return for
£800,000. So reports the Canon of Bristol, who has been for 35 years
an active educator. -
The Longford election has been carried by MAJOR O’REILLY, and
the priests, with the aid of the gentler suasion of bludgeons, occasional
remonstrances being made in the shape of charges i. the dragoons.
“It is very ſit that the Committee hear a riot,” and we presume the
Pope's Major will be unseated—meantime SIR Robert PEEL under-
takes to prosecute the rioters.
Then game a long debate on the question of the American Blockade,
which Mr. GREGORY, in an able speech, endeavoured to prove no
blockade at all. . He thought that if it had been one, we were one-
sided in recognising it, but being both unjust and ineffective, the House
ought to declare against it. Divers speakers exerted themselves, and
the Solicitor-General, SIR. RoundELL PALMER, who has a special repu-
tation for international law, had his first opportunity of coming out with
his learning. He thought that we ought to remember the difficulties in
which the inſ. States Government had been placed, and argued that
there was no valid reason for condemning the blockade. LoRD Robert
CECIL professed extreme admiration of the “splendid” speech of MR.
GREGORY, and the eloquence, and learning of SIR. RouxDELI, and
talked of the distress occasioned by the present state of things.
ADMIRAL WALcott called the Stone Fleet a blot on the American
escutcheon, and the debate ended. The English Commons evidently
mean to wait, but not to be dumb waiters.
“HERE'S A COIL, MY MASTERS!”—shakspeare.
THE Pythoness writes to us to complain of the impertinent intrusion
of MR. ScLATER upon her privacy; . She does not see, she says, why a
poor serpent is not to be permitted to hatch her eggs in her own way,
'...'... AND ZAMBRA’s thermometers being thrust in upon
her maternal coils. , No wonder, she says, that some warmth, may be
detected in her under such persecution. She feels it especially hard,
when every lady in confinement is left to take her caudle in peace, that
a poor Pythoness is not to be allowed her egg-hot without letters in
the Newspapers. . We have pleasure in giving expression to these
feelings on the part of the interesting lady Python at the Regent's Park.
A Literal Correction.
WHEN PRINCE JEROME was charged with putting into the mouth of
the people, on the return of NAPOLEoN THE FIRST from Elba, the cry
of “d has les pretres 1’’ he declared that what he said, or meant to say,
was “à has tº traitres”. Prince jenoºr should really mind his
“p’s”—his cues he is understood to take from the Tuileries, whatever
appearances may say to the contrary.

WALKER, the com-
mander of the Forces
of HER MAJESTY in
Scotland: for at .
religious meeting in
Edinburgh the other
day, he occupied the
chair, and
sion thus to open
pious fire:—
“Before reading the
first Psalm,
WALKER rose to make a
statement expressive of
regret at having allowed
his name to appear re-
cently as a patron of
private theatricals among
the military, as he had heard that this had been a stumbling block to many Christians.”
allant Mawworm said that the theatricals
ose (and doubtless charity will cover even the great
going to the play), and that he was not present at them, although assured
that nothing in the least degree objectionable would be introduced, but for which
assurance perhaps he might have gone. In further plea moreover he put forth his
opinion, that whereas it was profanity to see a play in
public, theatricals in private it was no sin to see:–
“While he . called a theatre a den of iniquity, he did not
wish it to be supposed that he said the same of private theatricals.”
So, according to this Mawworm, it is not the play itself
but its being acted publicly that is so pernicious. When
the tickets are sold privately there is no harm in the drama;
but when vended by advertisement they are passports to
the devil. For this logic the best comment is simply to
ejaculate the fitting name of “WALKER!”
In his fit of pious fervour, MAJOR GENERAL MAwwormſ
very probably forgot the soldier in the saint, or he would
not have called a theatre a “ den of iniquity.” The
QUEEN, whose uniform he wears, has ever been a patron
and frequenter of the playhouse; and, let the saints say
what they will, HER MAJESTY has done good service to her
country by so lending her best influence to purify its
plays. Had she abstained from being present at well-con-
ducted theatres, the effect of her discountenance would
have been to, bring discredit and debasement on the
stage. The influence of the playhouse on the people is
undoubted, and the nation has in great measure, we think,
to thank its Sovereign for the purity with which its plays
are now performed. Who is this GENERAL MAwwormſ
that he should call a theatre a “den, of iniquity,” well
knowing as he does that his QUEEN has been so often
to it? By letting drop such mawkish cant to please a
Mawworm meeting, he uses words unworthy, of a º

LE LION DU QUARTIER LATIN.

My Lion! There’s one time for roaring,
Another for holding the tongue.
At the Eagle yourselves set a-soaring
In vain paper-pellets are flung.
These workmen #. dosy with flummery,+
These troops won with praises and pay,+
These trials so summary
Dispensing with all legal mummery,
Make your roar very much like a bray.
“The student,” you say’s, “the forlorn hope
That leads on the masses unquiet;”
But how, when the best have forsworn hope,
And the rest prefer slav’ry to riot?
When the power of the purse is surrendered,
And the power of the sword given away,
When the yoke's on the necks that you tendered,
And the habit’s engendered
Of kissing the rod day by day?

While Society, weary of shocks, p

And flies from THE LION,
To put itself under The Fox.
For your Lion's a terrible wildfowl
To be let to go loose in the streets.
If Fox do now and then bag a mild fowl,
What are vulpine to leonine feats?
Dull bourgeois who’ve seen constitutions
Worn out ere they well were tried on,
Sick of red, white, and blue Revolutions,
(The vile Lilliputians !)
Only say to the Lion—“Begone !”

And the old “Whiff of Grape” you remember,

And Thermidor's Lions laid low
THE SENSITIVENESS OF OSBORNE.
IN the debate on the Army Estimates, on the discussion that took
place relating to the alteration of cavalry uniforms, BERNAL QSBORNE
is reported to have said, “this is a matter which qught not to be joked
away.” It is a rich thing to hear the member for Liskeard complaining
of “a matter being joked away.” Of course, he never by any accident
jokes himself. He is the very last man to do it. Parºenpi, is he
ealous of any one else joking? It may be that he is envious of
WHALLEY, or THE O'Donoghue, and wishes to have the exclusive
monopoly himself. In other respects, we must sympathise with the
sensitiveness of our injured friend, HERNA. He is quite right in
complaining of the joking that takes, place in the House. "It is
generally detestable; and, if it is painful to read, we can easily under-
stand that it must be doubi painful to listen to. If he can only put a
stop to the nuisance, all those who, like ourselves, are compelled to
read the debates, will be everlastingly his debtors. To carry out so
benevolent a purpose, let him be the first to show a example, and
for the future heroically refrain from joking himself. We defy you,
BERNAL, to do it.

CARDINAL WISEMAN cannot understand why the EMPEROR NAPO-

canonisation of Japanese Martyrs to come off in May next, when the
Pope has invited the prelates of France, and all the rest of the world

alias JUDAs IscARIOT, as some of the Ultramontane French clergy call
their Sovereign, may entertain some apprehension that if the Pori, were
to succeed in getting, all the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church
congregated at Rome, his Holiness, whilst their hands were in at the
canonisation, might induce them to join him in an obiter decretum esta-
blishing the last new dogma of the temporal sovereignty, and pronounc-
ing all who dare gainsay it anathema? Cannot, CARDINAL WISEMAN
conceive NAPOLEoN to be possibly of opinion that the best way of keep-
ing the French Church, Gallican is to keep the French bishops in Gauſ?
he Holy Father, will not evince infallible policy in canonising the
Japan Martyrs whilst his own live subjects are kept under by liability
to a cannonade. He will give thinking people occasion to observe that
the martyrs contrived to propagate the faith unprotected by artillery
and bayonets, and that their example seems to be much rather extolled
than imitated by the author of their beatification, who, always com-
laining of the lacerations of his paternal heart, keeps, and long may

We are requested by the RIGHT HoN. B. D-sh–Li to state that
he is not “the tyrant BEN,” who was alluded to in a theatrical trial
a few days ago. He may have ruled with a rod of brass, but never
with a rod of iron. The Toole, from whom the statement in question
proceeded, had never the honour of belonging to the Tory party.
CONSERVATIVES AND DERBYITES.
advice to ELECTORs.
CANTERBURY has returned a Conservative candidate, and it is of the
utmost importance to the Ex-KING of NAPLEs, the EMPERQR of
AUSTRIA, the Pope, and CHIAvon E, the chief of the Bourbonist
brigands, that the North Riding and Wycombe should follow Canter-
ury’s example. . It is sometimes asked, what is a Conservative *
Many honest but ignorant electors imagine that a Conservative is what
a Conservative, always was an upholder of all valuable old English
institutions. A Conservative is no longer any such kind of person.
A Conservative means a Derbyite, and what a Derbyite is was made
manifest the other night by the EARL of DERby himself in the House
of Lords, when he took occasion to put a question to EARL RUSSELL
calculated to eligit an admission damaging to Italian unity; a question
which if we had had to guess who put it, we should have named the
venerable NorMANBy... A Conservative, so called, is a gentleman who
wishes to reverse the foreign policy of this country, and reduce rebel:
lious Italy under subjection to its BoMBALINo, and Duke , and
Kaiser, and Holy Father. A real Conservative, in the obsolete sense of
the word, is a supporter of LoRD PAIMERSTON and EARL RUSSELL, for
whose removal from the Establishment in Downing Street, to be
succeeded by DERby AND Co., so many pious Irishmen of THE
Q'D9Noghue's persuasion, and so many Roman Catholic, priests,on
the Continent, are praying and preaching, with a view to the humilia-
tion of proud 'England. i.e. alielectors who wish to contribute to this
result rush to the poll, and record their votes for the Derbyite candi-
date who calls himself a Conservative.
Gradually Making Way.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
D EAR PUNCH.-It is as-
tonishing when once a
play has hit the public
taste, how it is relished
in whatever shape it is
resented. The ever-
asting Colleen Bawn
has been “recited' as
a song, and played as
a burlesque, and adapt-
ed as an opera, and in
each form proves at-
s tractive. It only re-
mains now to serve it
- up as a ‘sensation ”
ballet, and let the
* - business of the Cave
Scene be transacted in
a graceful #. de deur
by Danny Mann, and Eily; or else to represent it in the fashion of a
hippodrama, and let the gallant Myles-na- en take his header upon
horseback, a la MARgus CURTIUS his jump into the gulf. . In this case
the hunting chorus introduced by Mā. BENETICT might be made still
more effective by being sung on horseback, and a real fox might break
away in terror at the row. *::::: knows that when a southerly
§ and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting morning, Qur hunting men
are wonted to assemble in long red coats reaching to their heels, and to
sing a stunning chorus with a whip-cracking accompaniment, precisely
as they do in MR, BENEDICT's new opera, or as the Jägers in Der
Freischütz do, as doubtless he has heard. And this hunting scene
would certainly be far more like to life, were the singers all on horse;
back, as at Astley's they might be, and their prancing steeds all
trained to beat time with their hoofs. -
“By the newspapers I see that the Lily of Killarney is an opera far
cleverer than WEBER could have written, even if RossINI had helped
to guide his hand, and MEYERBEER or ¥ſozºnt had been by to give a
hint. No praise is esteemed too high for such a work; and nothing
has been wanting by the management or audience to ensure, for the
chef d’auvre a most rapturous success. Eight pieces, with the over-
ture, were re-demanded the first night; and if you fancy that the song:
sellers had any hand in all this clapping, the critics doubtless are
ready to make an affidavit such could not have been the case. Poor
MR. BENEDICT!. How, he has been buttered! What a nuisance it
must be to any rightly thinking mind to find oneself the object of so
much soft soap ! Were he a humbug and impostor who º: his
bread by puffery, the critics scarce could have beslavered him much
more than they have done. And being, as he is, a really good musician,
and therefore fully competent to feel his own, shortcomings and to
judge of his own work, how it must have pained him to receive such
ulsome praise, well-knowing that the public were too wise to be
misled by it ! -
“Despite defects, however, which the critics have not hinted at (and
of what value is criticism if it fails to point out errors which thereby
may be stopped P) the Lily of Killarney is likely to attract: not so
much perhaps because it has much pleasant music, as from the fact
that doubtless most Fº who’ve seen the Colleen Bawn will like to
take a look at their old pet in her new vocal dress. There is nothing
very striking, or startling, in the opera; and one does not, come, awa
from it whistling the tunes. Sentimental butcher boys will not find it
quite so easy to lay hold of MR. BENEDICT as they do of MR. BALFE;
and though “Eily Mapourneen’ is a fairly pretty air, it will not, thank
goodness! be so popular with organ-men as the melodies which haunted
us when first the famed Bohemian Girl was by BUNN THE GREAT pro-
duced. Still, the music, is well written, and adapted to the drama
which it has been the task of the librettist to adapt; and this perhaps
is plainer English than saying that the music is marked by ‘charac-
teristic local colouring throughout;’ which, as it is difficult to see the
colour of what one only hears, I fear that people's ears, in general will
be too blind to perceive. indeed it may be doubted if any one in
England could have written better music than MR. BENEDICT has
done, considering the subject on which he had to write. To compose
“sensation” music to accompany the Cave Scene would of course have
not been difficult; but the chances are, sublimity would have suggested
ridicule, and MR. BENEDICT was wise to pursue a calmer course.
Danny Mann he was compelled in a great measure to idealise, or there
would have been no scope for a good singer in the part: and nobody
who hears the fine scena thus suggested can feel regret, that a mere
boatman is made a sentimental tender-hearted ruffian, with an exquisite
bass voice. . His duet with Hardress is another charming piece, and st
more tuneable and lovely is the ballad “I’m alone, which Miss PYNE
sings in a way to drive young ladies to despair. Every one is aware
that MR. BENEDICT well knows the resources of the orchestra, so I
need not say how cleverly his work is instrumented; and as the Covent
Garden Band is worth takin º: to write for, he has perhaps been
more than usually careful with his score.
or the manner of Fºllº. of the work, I give full praise
and this alone will doubtless prove sufficient to secure it, a goo
run, when, as it is sure to be, it is next season reproduced, Miss
Louisa Eily PYNE never can sing badly, though she might sing
even better if she gave herself more rest. Doubtless her late illness
was caused by lack of this, and her voice is now so valuable that the
Sublic must feel anxious to have her take more care of it. Next year
hope to hear more of her deputy Miss THIRLwALL, who is a pains-
taking and improving singer, although (as critics say) not “gifted with
an organ’so powerful in tone. MR. SANTLEy's scena is a thing that
should be heard by all who have a taste for good music well sung; and
as for MR. HARRISON, who as head man of the theatre, of course
undertakes the ‘header, I think he well deserves full credit for the
way in which he struggles with what must be a most ungrateful part.
It is no joke to crack jokes that have been cracked by MR. Bouci.
GAULT, in a house so large that half their pith is lost in the expanse.
What becomes of 'quiet humour’ when speakers have almost to shout
to, make, their talking audible; and who can find much drollery in a
delicate “aside, when, to reach one's ear, it must be given forth with
rotund mouth P
. “As I have been lately entertaining country visitors, gifted with
insatiable § for plays, I have, besides the Lily, seen the Dublin
Boy and Red Riding Hood. As touching the Adelphi, if such boys as
MBs, Boucicault's now run about in Dublin, I’m sure it is no wonder
that the girls should fall in love with them as soon as they grow up. In
such a part the pathos seemed less natural than the fun, }. few critics
could speak harshly of such prettily pleading looks and sweetly sympa-
thetic voice. As for the burlesque, it has much lovely Irish scenery,
and many wretched #. puns; but the story is so twisted that
few }. minds can follow it. However, it is sure to hold the stage
till Easter; and so I need say no more about it for the present, except
to throw out a mild hint that the man who has an eye, and likes to see
a pretty face (and º lissome legs to boot), and who yet neglects
to give a look at the Lyceum and §. LYDIA RED RIDING Hood,
is a fool whom it were flattery to call a brainless ass.
“ONE WHO PAYs.”
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
We are glad to read that the Pope, out of the 300,000ft., which were
collected for him by the Peter's Pence Committee at Lyons, has re-
turned20,000ſr. The refunded money was for the benefit of the Lyonnaise
operatives now destitute of employment. It is true the Pope still
retains the Lyons' share. A handsome balance of 280,000fr. is not a
bad hiº, in the hour of trouble, to have by one to draw consolation
from. me ill-natured people may say, with the distress existing in
the town where the money was collected, that the Pop E might have
remitted more, but we mean to say that it only proves how keenly alive
PIUs must be to the sufferings of his fellow creatures, when he sends so
much as 20,000ft. It has always been a staunch principle with, the
Church, andonéto whichÉ. º of all denominations adhere
with the most tenacious fidelity, that there is to be, at the church doors
as at the theatres, “No Money Returned.” It is the one theological
point upon which all creeds agree. In spite of this, however, and in
spite of his own pressing wants, for which he must require every penny
that St. Peter can scrape together, for him, he still has the magna-
mimity to part with the above § sum. Nothing but conscience
could have prompted this sacrificial parting, and it is, therefore, under
the head of “Conscience Money” that we embalm the precious act.
The surrender may be simply le commencement de la fin. Having re-
stored the 20,000ft., the Pope's next act of surrender may be that of
his temporal power. So good a beginning should be followed up by
even greater sacrifices. In the meantime, how agreeable to note down,
amongst the marvels of this wonder-exciting age, that a Pope is not
destitute of a Conscienceſ
“THE RIVER TO THE OCEAN OF HIS THOUGHTS.”
At the grand fancy ball given in Paris by the Countess WALEwski,
we read that a certain Count LUPOLT (or some such name), went
“in the dress of a river-god.” We hardly know what the dress, of a
river-god may be, unless it is a bathing-dress, and that would hardly be
the thing for a ball-room, even though it were glacé'd for the occasion.
If the ball had been inside a theatre, of course we can understand the
river-god would have retired into a baignoire at once. Did he walk
about with that traditionary urn tucked under his arm all the evening *
We have heard of “dancing waters,” but a dancing, river is ..";
quite new on the tapis, and we shouldn’t think it would have the effect o
much improving the latter. Probably, after all, this Count only assumed
this dress of an aquatic god in order to be able to display what the
French call his rivières de diamants, which of course were all of the .#
first water. At what time, we wonder, did this river retire to its bed

was described as a “Manufacturer of Crino-

perverse indulgence in confirmed bad habits
will ultimately lead a man to. He cannot
long escape his doom. He is sure to be caged
at last. In other words, the Bankrupt above

THE HAPPIEST OF MEN 1
WE copy the subjoined letter of introduction from the French papers.
It certainly deserves being included among the choicest belles-let/res of
France :-
“My Dear Victor-EMMANUEL,
“Receive DUMAs. Ho is my friend—as well as yours, “G -
Anibaldi."
' (The above is an exact Copy.
“ALExANDRE DUMAs.)”
Happy DUMAs; Not only does he associate with kings, but with
eat men like GARIBALDI. The latter takes an honest pride in calling
im his “friend.” It must be a proud title for the same man to be
called “the author of Monte Christo, and the friend of GARIBALDI.”
However, such an accumulation of honours, under which any other
pair of shoulders, less Atlas-like, would be weighed down to the earth,
does not make ALEXANDRE in the least proud, and, in giving a friend a
facsimile of the above letter, he takes particular care to testify, for fear
of the world, or posterity, being deceived, that it is..." an exact copy.”
And the world does now know, as posterity will, that, DUMAs is
GARIBALDI's friend, Victor-EMMANUEL's friend, everybody's friend,
in short: of everybody, at least, who has read his charming books.
He is, in truth, everybody’s friend, even including the bailiffs, for they
seem to run after him more than any one else. Indeed, the attentions
of the latter almost take the form of persecutions. In spite of the
huissiers, however, DUMAs is the happiest of men. Not a day passes
but some paper says something about him. He is uniformly successfu
in making people talk about him. It is true that it is not always praise
that is bandied about in public in connection with his name; it is
equally true that, when his character is canvassed in print, it is not
always sugar that is sprinkled over it. But what of that? is he not
perpetually talked about? and do we not know that to be º
talked about is considered in France the very greatest height of human
happiness attainable in this world?
es, ALEXANDRE, thou art the happiest of men. The above letter is
for thee a sure passport to Fame, and fortunately thy modesty does not
prevent thee showing it. Great genius, we envy thee!, Indeed, so
;: is our envy, that we feel, prompted to borrow the words of
IoGENEs, and, basking in the blaze of thy world-illumining splen-
dour, reverently to exclaim: “If we were not Punch, we would be
ALEXANDER!”
HESITATION IN A GENTLEMAN'S SPEECH.
THE proceedings in the Court Martial which has been held at Dublin
on CAPTAIN, Robertson of the Fourth Dragoon Guards, on a charge
which, in substance though not in terms, is that of not having promptly
enough challenged aºft". who had insulted him to fight, a duel, have
been º at full length in the Morning Post. The subjoined
extract from that journal is an example of faithful º which we
should like to see generally followed. A “Round, Robin,” having for
its object the removal of CAPTAIN Roberts@N, signed by the officers
of the regiment, and addressed to the Colonel, is the document, alluded
to in the President’s question, addressed to the witness, CoLoNEL
BENTINck himself:—
“By ‘unanimous,” did you mean that LIEUTENANT RINToul, ought to get the
other officers to sign it, or did you mean that it would be no use unless it were
unanimous 2
“Witness. I have only a ſhint recollection of speaking to LIEUTENANT RINTopL
on the subject, and to the best of my belief my idea at that time was that it ought
to be—ah—ah—unanimous, in fact, that—ah—ah—every officer ought to sign it."
CoLONEL BENTINck's explanation of the word unanimous, as
applied to the signature of a document, reminds one of that which
Bardolph volunteered to give of the word accommodate, “Unanimous,
in fact, that—ah—ah—every officer ought to sign it” is a definition, as
lucid as the gallant Colonel could have pronounced if he had clothed it
in the very words of Falstaff’s red-nosed follower:-
“Unanimous; That is, when officers are, as they say, unanimous; or, when
officers are, being—whereby—they may be thought to be unanimous; which is an
excellent thing.”
What a pity it is that Parliamentary speeches cannot be taken down
by a sort of phonography, so that they might be published in the papers,
and read as they were actually spoken # Honourable Members knew
that their eloquence would be faithfully reproduced next morning for
the amusement, ſº as much as for the instruction of the British
public, they would soon unlearn their hums and haws and unnecessary
aspirates, and would learn to sound the letter h in its place. -
ry debates and º are enlivened for the reader } being
reported with the literal fidelity, above instanced, preserving the gro-
tesque character of a reply which, pruned of redundances, might have
been a straightforward answer to a simple question, and not at all
diverting, but which, as it stands, comprises and combines the fun of
Bardolph and Lord Żundreary.

WISEMAN OR WALKERP
IN the Lenten Pastoral just issued by CARDINAL WISEMAN, a com-
position fuller of flowers of speech than a schoolboy's, theme, there is
one particular flourish that looks very much like the figure hyperbole.
The Cardinal tells his flock that to the imperfect observances of indi-
viduals are added, on their behalf, at this season of mortification, the
afflictions, prayers, and penances of “noble souls,” “cloistered vir.
gins,” and “religious cenobites: ”—
“But more than all, the uncomplaining moans of clergy and people crushed and
despoiled, of homeless monks and roofless nuns cast out, expressly to perish—as a
class that must be destroyed.”
Namel name! Your Eminence. What clergy and what people are
crushed and despoiled P What homeless monks and roofless nuns are
cast out, or rather, to put your question into intelligible English, what
monks and what nuns are cast out of their homes and from under their
roofs, expressly with the intent that they may perish, as a class that
must be destroyed? Do you mean the people, or any of the !". and
clergy of Italy: Is, it true that the inmates of suppressed convents
and nunneries have been actually turned out of their houses without
provision or compensation, and left to starve? If it is true, and you
can prove that it is, you will deprive Victor-EMMANUEL of any more
support that he can derive from Punch. If it is not true, whom do you
mean, and, whom do you, accuse? Mr. Punch pauses for a reply, and
trusts, in the mean time, that Fabiola is your Eminence's last romance.
Yet one more question, by favour of your Eminence. What portion
of the Roman §. § and people is that which utters uncom.
laining mgans? Is it the French ultramontane Bishops who call the
MPEROR NAPOLEON, HERop, and JUDAs IscARIOT, and PoNTIUs
PILATE; is it they and their spokesmen in the Senate?...Is it the
refractory Italian prelates and the Bourbonist brigands? If not, who
are §. uncomplaining moaners? Who? Why—bless us—how could
we be so dull as not to twig your Eminence's allusion! Sure, and it’s
ARCHBishop CULLEN that your Eminence has in your eye, and ARCH-
Bishop M'HALE, and the faithful Irish.
A Nuisance that Requires being Told to “Move On."
MR. WHALLEY is dearly fond of a noise, always beating that Mºi
mooth gong, of his, until he fairly deafensus, an º the o
women of the island out of their propriety. He evi ently is not what
Mr. Jem Baggs, in the Wandering Minstrel, calls “the W(H)ALLEY of
peace and quietness.”
PHILOSOPHY STOOPING TO PICK UP A PUN.
THERE never will be so brilliant a Session as the present. It has,
in addition to other attractions, for which we are kindly indebted to
MEssRs. PEEL, O'DonqGHUE, WHALLEy, Osbor NE, and a large
talented comic company, been illumined with a witticism from the lips
of the War Secretary. ... We should as soon have expected a joke to
drop from the mouth of a cannon' Such a thing has never occurred
before, and probably never will occur again. Here it is, in all its efful-
gence, undiminished of a single ray:—
“SiR G. C. LEwis said the Hon. Gentleman wished to elicit his opinion as to the
relative merits of a large bore and a small bore. (Laughter.) Experiments were still
going on. (Renewed Laughter.)"
What a pity SIR GEORGE CoRNWALL did not describe the nature of
those experiments. y did he not give us examples of “the large
bore” and “the small bore ?” It can only have been the embarras
du choir that puzzled him. SIR GEORGE should have followed his
success up, and have given us a description of the “smooth bore.” If
he had not been so nervous, and flurried with the applause, he would
doubtlessly have pointed to the First Commissioner of Works as a
all very good specimen of the latter.
SIR GEORGE was complimented on all sides for his successful first
attempt. Amongst others by-
“MR. GRIFFITH, who was glad he (the War Secretary) had been fortunate enough
to elicit a joke from so dry a subject. (Laughter.)"
It strikes us vividly that GRIFFITH is looking, out, for an appoint-
ment. We wonder how the poor astonished philosopher felt at
receiving an encouraging pat on the shoulder from the hands of a
GRIFFITH ! Wouldn’t he have liked to have recalled his pretty little
maiden witticism P - - -
However, anxious to encourage rising merit, we shall be only
too happy to engage SIR GEORGE as a constant contributor...If he can
let us É. a couple of gross of puns every week (only a trifle of pun:
ency superior to the sample above quoted), we have no doubt we shall
e able to come to terms. We can promise him that his salary shall
be better than his present one, and moreover he will have a rare º:
tunity, one that does not often present itself, of making for himself, a
great reputation. It is a pity that nascent talent like his should be
allowed to remain dormant.

GENTLEMAN. “I am not going to wade through that Mud.”
CAD. “Bill, pull up a bit nearer to the near side for a Swell as Cleans his own Boots."
GREAT BRITAIN IN BANKRUPTCY.
That highly estimable newspaper, the New York Herald, has been
keeping up its character for trut ſful information by putting forth a
statement that this country is now standing on the brink of national
bankruptcy: citing as authority for making this assertion the paragraph
that #. from our Western Times:—
“BANKRUPTcy.—The enormous length of the list of bankrupts trenching so much
on our we omit it. The Gazette of Bankruptcy will afford a great treat to
those fº of this sort of reading.”
The Gazette of Bankruptcy is a most useful publication, and one that
stands unequalled for sticking to plain facts. There is no romancing in
the statements which it publishes, and every word in it can be supported
by positive full proof. 1. truthful as its statements indisputably are,
the Gazette of Bankruptcy does not afford quite a true picture of our
national condition to those who may be unacquainted with the state of
English law. If the writer in the New York Herald, whose comments
we subjoin, would take the trouble to consult his learned fellow-citizen
MR. Edwin JAMEs, he might learn that by an Act which was passed in
our last, Session the distinction between trader and non-trader was
abolished, and the Insolvent Debtors' Court and the insolvent juris-
diction of the County Courts were stopped. The effect of this has been
that every small debtor who gets into a mess has his affairs adjudicated
by the Court of Bankruptcy, and his name is Pºlº brought
before the public, which under the old law would not have been the
case. If the New York Herald writer would take in the Gazette whose
words he uses for a text, he would see that fully nine-tenths of its list
of bankrupts are made up of entries such as “ 3. STUBBs, chimney
sweep” or “Timothy SMITH, tinker,” and the like names of small
note, which, a year ago could not have had the proud distinction of
being publicly presented at the British (Bankrupts) Court. ..
But not having the advantage of subscribing to and reading the
Bankruptcy Gazette, the New York writer, on the faith of the extract
we have quoted, acquaints his readers with the following by this time
world-known facts:–
“The truth is that England, financially and commercially, was never in a more
rotten condition than she is at the present moment. Her people are staggering
under such a load of taxation that they are unable to support any further burdens.
With her cotton mills closed or working on short time, her exports to this country
reduced by one-half, famine decimating the Irish portion of her population, and
starvation º over her English operatives, she was in no condition to pick
up the gauntlet had we chosen to fling it to her. She might, it is true, have
damaged our navy, temporarily obstructed our commerce, and wrought us some
injury on our seaboard ; but à. cost of all this, like ‘the last straw that breaks
the camel's back,' would have so ground down her people and bankrupted her
º that rebellion and revolution at home º ave been the inevitable
result."
How, true is the “truth” which this ingenuous writer tells of us;
the dullest of observers with half an eye may see. Of the “famine’
now in Ireland all our newspapers are full, and the way in which the
people there are daily being “ decimated” the sad debates in Parlia-
ment abundantly attest. In England too “starvation” stares us in
the face. Our work-houses are all as full as they can hold, and not the
“operatives” only,
our swells, may daily be seen clamouring for entrance at their gates.
Our soup-kitchens are thronged with a crowd of hungry applicants,
some of whom were a while since the greatest gourmands of the day.
By the present dearth of food, the Lord MAYor. is reduced to a bread-
and-water diet; while dozens of the Aldermen, and other lovers of good
dinners, may daily be seen chalking “We are Starring” in the streets.
Every one is looking for rebellion to break out, and some of our more
sanguine revolutionary organs have fixed the fatal day for the beheading
of LoRD PALMERSTON, and for proclaiming a republic under MR.
RobespierRE BRIGHT. In fact, the New York Herald but very faintl
pictures our miserable plight; and we only hope when next this fran
and friendly paper talks of us, it will try to speak more nearly to the
actual truth.

ſective Blockade, and that this is unfair to Richmond. New York
may muddle up a quotation and say:-
“Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond, for the selfsame England
That lours at me looks sadly upon it.”
LoRDABINGER made a statement which must enchant the Americans
both North and South. He had travelled in the States, and had formed
a favourable opinion of both populations, and therefore he did not wish
us to raise the Blockade, but thought that the time for recognising the
South had come. The Foreign Secretary defended his conduct urged
that the Federals had certainly done their utmost to make the Blockade
effectual, and that three thousand miles of coast are not easily guarded
so closely as to make infringement impossible. But the vessels that
have run the Blockade were ſew, and of no important character, and a
better proof still was, that somehow the Southern Cotton did not get
out, although England and France were eager for it. The Earl hoped
that in three months, or sooner, we might see an end of the war, and
that the Separation of North and South, whose old feelings it would
be impossible to renew, might be accomplished peaceably. We hope
so too; but the North, after a series of disasters and disgraces, is now
coming down on the South, in such an overwhelming force, that we
fear there for a time at least we shall have to say, Wae victis.

| “THE PLAY'S THE THING.”
We read that there have not been less than three suicides
this year at Homburg from gambling. We have heard of
“the hazard of the die,” but, the above calamities would
indicate that there was very little “hazard ” indeed about
it. Is it not rather “the certainty of the die?”. So many
end their days fatally, who lend. themselves to the madden-
ing pursuit, that we should be inclined to pronounce it “a
dead certainty.” . Of all follies, gambling would seem, with
E. painful truth, to be the most suicidal. Those German prin-
cipalities, that º: themselves by the produce of the

popular melodrama, called Wingt-cing ans de la vie d'un

feverish existence of a gambler. If you were to limit it to
as many days, we think it would be much nearer the
mark. The play of the Gamester is never one that has a
long run.
of the districts from which the despots have been ejected, and it is
remarkable that when the liberators, very wickedly, take a leaf out of
the cruel book of the old dynasty, our Opposition is affected even to
tears, though in the old days, ten times as much atrocity was wrought
without notice from the tender-hearted Tories., Now, the latter are
quite right in protesting against cruelty, but they have been a good
while in finding out that it hurts.

the subject should be reconsidered on the following Thursday. . It
seems that the authorities of our Universities are desirous to assist in

his friends, with short memories, for objecting to the provision, for
trying lunatics by Judges, when the same provision was introduced into
a # brought "... by SIR Hugh CAIRNs when LoRD DERBY's
law-officer. LoRD, DERby instantly retorted that the charge was un-
founded, and that the Chancellor's Bill was peremptory, whereas SIR
Hugh's was permissive only. There was some smart sparring, LORD
Westºry accusing Lond DERby of speaking on “imperfect infor-
mation.’

courts of justice, ãº
“Friends meet to part. Love laughs at faith.
True foes, once met, are joined till”
the next meeting of the upper division of the legislature. The Bill was
read a Second Time. -
At length the Chinese, Rebels are to be prevented from destrºying
every place they can lay their hands on. They have ruined one of our
Treaty Ports, Ningpo, though the cruel dastards could have been blown
into Tartarus by a few yolleys from our marines. ...But, now that they
threaten Shan łº, orders, have been given, as MR, LAYARD stated
to-night, that #. lace, which contains millions of British property, shall
be protected. }. strange inconsistency which drives off these
scoundrels at one time, and at another permits every º; is only to
be explained by the fact that China is a long way off, and therefore it is
lucky that the new telegraph is likely to bring it a good deal nearer,
LöRD Robert Montagu is a conscientious man, and is touched by
the fact that though Parliament pretends to look after the public money,
it really does not. He is also a man of the world, and knowing that
you might just as well expect Honourable Members' wives to give up
crinoline (until ordered to do so by their milliners) as to expect
Honourable Members to give up their time to watching the disposal of
such money, he evasively proposes to appoint a Committee to do the
duty supposed to be done by the House, and to revise the accounts and
estimates. Needless to say that all the Men of Business were up in
arms, SIR F. BARING, FRED. PEEL, GLADSTONE, all opposing the plan
or that it was rejected by 96 to 31. Natheless, despite the men o
business, there was a good deal to be said in its favour, and one of these
days it will be discovered that amid all the complex machinery for
managing the national accounts, there is a Missing Link somewhere, h
and that John Bull is done a good deal browner than is supposed. .
Then began a solemn debate, originated by MR; HoRsrALL, who is a
Conservative mercantile Candidate, and who will have the support of
the CoBDEN and BRIGHT º: some other º: if MR.
DISHAELI sees fit to extend it. The question is one of International
Maritime Law. Privateering has been abolished—the abolition being
confirmed by the Declaration of Paris in 1856, to which Seven European
Powers are parties, but not America. The neutral flag covers an
Enemy's goods, except contraband of war, and the Enemy's flag protects
neutral goods, with the same exception. Now just remember,this,
Cox, because it is a bore to have to be always explaining to you that a
neutral bottom does not mean the bottom of the sea around neutral
round, and that a privateer does not mean the Private Tier of boxes.
ow, observe. MR. HoRSFALL, for Liverpool, and MESSRs. Cobden
and Bright for others who recognise nothing except the interests of
trade, desire to go further, and propose that, private property of an
enemy shall not be taken out of an enemy's ship. Do you see what
this means? It means that BRITANNIA, who rules the waves, shall not
rule them any more, and that it shall cease to be any concern of any-
body's save the professonal combatants, whether war goes on or does
not. LoRD PALMERSTON declared that the #. if carried out,
would deal a fatal blow to the naval power of England, and be an act
of political suicide. So it was arranged to have a long debate on the
subject, and the following, Monday was fixed for that event, MR.
CoBDENA" having the floor.”
Wednesday. The Wife's Sister was disposed of. The Widower is
not to marry, her. There was a short debate..., MR. MonsELL stated
his view of the marriage tie in the language of the poet,_
“Wedded love with loyal Christian lady is a mystery rare,
Body, heart, and soul in union make one loving pair.”
but he didn't say, whether “rare” meant “seldom found,” or
“exalted,” nor did he explain the difference between a loving pear and
a º: º he talked some other nonsense, and instanced, as
a possible result of an alteration of the present marriage laws, a case
like that of the gentleman in Prussia, who sat down to i. whist with
his wife and two other ladies who had been his wives. As he was
quoting hereby, without any particular application, he should have
cited from SIR BULwer Lytton touching this interesting partie carré,
“In the game called Woman
Diamonds are always Trumps for Hearts.”
SIR WILLIAM Jolliffe gave support to the Bill, MR. GREGson said
that a million had petitioned for it, and only 140,000 against it, and
then the House threw it out by 116 to 148.
MR. Bouver IE º in a Bill for relieving a clergyman, who
should happen to turn Dissenter, from his canonical obligations. At
present a Bishop can serve out such a schismatic rather severely, By
all means relieve conscience from all fetters, but we suspect that if
a Bill could be passed for † Dissenting ministers to become
clergymen somewhat more simply than now, the Church would gain a
many more recruits than it will lose by the above Bill. The fact
is that, Dissent is not genteel, and Churchism is, and when a man gets
on in the world, and marries a lady, they find out that they owe it to their
family to get among the superior classes. Can't the Bishops see this?
Thursday.—Lords DERby and WESTBURY went at it again, and after
some very sharp exchanges on both sides, delivered with the utmost
malice and suavity, LoRD WESTBURY reproving the Lords for not
being able to sit still while he was speaking, and LQRD DEBBy ironi-
gally observing that the CHANCELLOR could not speak from imperfect
information, LoRD WESTBURy felt compelled to allow that “a small
ovation” was due to the Earl. This is the first turn-up that has
º: º the two º º: tº: º: in
* House, and gives promise of much sport for the legislatorial Fancy.
The ons availed themselves of SIR. G. C. Lewis's polite invi-
tation, and rescinded their vote against. Sandhurst. MR. C. ForTEs-
GUE explained that a system of local self-government is to be given to
the New Zealanders, and MR. HENLEY, in speaking of educati venti-
lated an epigram of his own, describing the present system as " and
Sham,” which was not so bad for our old friend Grumble and ble.
Friday. A short and decorous debate on the Reyi e, LoRD
St. LeoNARDs does not like the grouping of children by for
examination, and the Bishop of LoNDoN thinks that there'sh be
two grants, one based on examination, the other on atten The
Bishop, said that he knew much of the state of public and
believed it had undergone, a great change, lately, in favour ºf the
Revised Code, which, with some modifications, would it. ly
satisfactory. Such testimony is simply invaluable, s settle
the question for all clerical malcontents—of course it must be fought
out with . who make it a money discussion. -
The Misgellanea of Friday night did not comprise much interesting
matter. MR. LAYARD declined to ask the Italian Government any
more questions as to whether the EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH was trying
to obtain Italian territory, as satisfactory assurance to the contrary
ad been already given, MR. LAYARD also had an opportunity of de-
claring his belief that Turkey was going on well, that the new SUITAN
was a wise man, that the finances of the country might easily be placed
in a sound condition, and that the Turks were honest men. “He had
great hopes for Turkey.” An excessively unsatisfactory statement was
made by the ATToRNEY-GENERAL on the subject of the Consolidation of
the Law, and we doubt, whether three per cent. of our Acts will be
wiped out, so as to qualify the Statute Book to be called the Three Per
Cent. Legal Consols. LoRD PALMERstoN *:::: that the bigotry
of the Spanish priests prevented any successful interference for certain
Protestants who had been thrown into prison in Spain. We rather
think, however, that these unfortunate individuals had really been
breaking the laws of their country by, reading the Bible to congrega-
tions, large or small, and though such a ground for imprisonment is
shocking to us, we ought to place Qurselves in the position of a nation,
with a faith which a certain preaching is ...”to bring into con-
tempt. The Bible describes Popery as a lie. Are the Pope's servants
impolitic or illogical in preventing the Bible from being read?, Finally,
MR. CowPER brought in a Bill for providing money for building new
Courts of Justice between the Strand and Carey Street. Have we not
heard of something of this kind before?
A Printing-House of Correction.
“The RE is but one Journalist in France (said M. JULEs FAvRE), and
that is the EMPERoR.” He is sometimes known, also, by the name of
“Monsiguit. CoMMUNIQUAE.” However, not only is Louis NApoleon
a Journalist in his way, but he is likewise a Printer on the very º:
scale, for no one possesses in France to the same extent as himself the
power of stºpping the press whenever he likes. But then this must be
said in the EMPEROR's favour, he never thinks of stopping the press,
unless it is with the humane §: of correcting it.
F In more senses than one, Louis NAPoleon is the Moniteur of
rance,
“The Schoolmaster's Abroad.”
At the time of his going, º the Schoolmaster has been absent now
so long, that we fancy it is high time he returned home), he wrote in
chalk over his door:-‘BACK AGAIN IN AN EDUCATIONAL MINUTE.”
However, that minute, like a lady's, when she º: she won't be a
minute putting on her bonnet, is such a precious long one, that we
confess we have nearly lost all patience in waiting.

A. WHISPER IN THE EAR OF THE EMPEROR.
A FRENCH newspaper receives a warning for what is called a “délit
de la presse.” So arbitrary are many of these punishments that we
think it would be much better if, in i. º which any one
connected with the Press will instantly understand, all these délits were
for the future “deleted”—that is to say, struck out, and done away
with altogether. That would be literally “a correction” of the Press
—a correction in the light of a great improvement... We fancy, that
Louis NAPOLEoN’s government would gain greatly in popularity by
adopting the hint we are now generous! giving it. At present, any
one would imagine that the French Editors were no better than his
servants, for he is always giving them warning. . In England, the posi-
tion is rather reversed, for with us...it is the ministers and public men
who are rather the servants of the Press. It is we who are always
giving them warning, and iſ they are troublesome after that, we tell
them very plainly to go about their business. this way, many a
º ?remier have we made leave his !". at a moment’s notice.
I was our painful duty about a fortnight ago to warn the THE
O'Donoghue, and you see he has been very quiet ever since.
Useful and Ormamental.

suppers, who opens the oysters with his chisel, and makes beautiful
cameos out of the shells afterwards.

WHISTLING FOR A WIND.
A Nautical Ballad.
It's of the good ship Guv'ment, and how becalmed she lay,
n Eighteen hundred and sixty-two, at her berth in Sessions Bay;
It’s little we expected, when articles we signed,
That we’d be lying here becalmed, and whistling for a wind.
CAPT'N PAM was our Commander, and a pleasant man was he,
For more nor fifty year he'd been a follering of the sea;
And if so be he warn’t so young, mayhap, as he had been,
His timbers still was tough enough for years to sarve the QUEEN.
He had been a dashing Captain as ever cracked along,
With all sail set, alow, aloft, though the gale was piping strong:
He'd laugh at reefs and breakers, at white squall and typhoon;
And caught the trades, when lubbers would get kitched in the monsoon.
There was some folks called him risky, and he did think danger fun:
He’d hug the land uncommon close sometimes to make a run;
Sometimes he'd shove his ship in where the shoals lay thick about,
As if to show his seamanship in bringing on her out.
But now he walks the quarter-deck, and he looks from sky to sea,
“The barky harn’t got way enough to steer,” he says, says he.
"Sooner than lie like this, until we grounds on our beef-bones,
I’d see it blow great guns, and have it out with Davy Jones.
“Under bare poles at fifteen knots I’ve run the gale afore
I've filled and backed, and wore and tacked and clawed off a lee-shore;
I’ve often faced shoal-water, with breakers 'neath my bow,
But ne'er lay like a log, afore, as we’re a lyin' now !
“We aren't no good to nobody: both officers and crew,
For want of occypation, will go to blazes blue; . -
They jaws and jokes and grumbles, and quarrels with their grub,
Turns up their noses at the grog that’s arved out at the tub.
“I ketches Gunner Lewis, at his guns when he should be,
A studyin' of the Ancients and their Astronomie; . . . . .
And Purser GLADSTONE, paying out Greek lingo just like winkin',
When ºwing: and candle-ends he’d ought, to have been
t 1ng.
... I sets 'em to pick oakum, and overhaul old stores,
To mend the sails, and holy-stone the decks, like dairy floors;
To polish every ringbolt, round-shot, and carronade, -
But can't find work to keep ’em out o' mischief I'm afraid.
“There's that sea-lawyer BRIGHT, he goes º: at his ease :
He calls us QUEEN's hard bargains, and lubbers our A.B.s;
Tells the waisters and loblolly boys, each officer’s a rip, , ,
That if they’d pluck they’d mutiny, and seize upon the ship!
“A wind, a wind, oh for a wind | No odds what wind it be—
So I see the catspaw creeping like a ripple o'er the sea!
I’ve set Bob Low E on the look-out to whistle strong and clear,
If he don’t raise the wind, I know, 'twill never blow this year.
“Methinks on the horizon I spy a little cloud-
And hark, a tiny whisper that pipes in stay and shroud! .
Now, whistle Low E and GRANyiLLE, now whistle once again—
Here comes the wind—a creeping on in flaws across the main.
“Turn up all hands! Lay out aloft, and let the barky feel
Each yard of duck, from deck to truck—clap on, until she recl
We're moving now ! about her bow once more ſhear the seat
Here comes the Education gale—reeſ, boys—and Helm-a-lee l’’
A Matter of Liquidation.
NExT door to the Union Bank in Argyle Place, and lº. close to
the entrance, there has been recently scooped out of the wall a drinking-
fountain. Over the flowing tap, some would-be wag has been writing:
“ALL DRAFTS HERE PAYABLE ON DEMAND.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VOICES OF THE DEEP.
Mong other interesting. news, that
“amiable pirate” Galignani prints
the following:—:
“The Voice of Fish.-DR. DUFoss?,
whose researches on this curious subject
we have mentioned before, has addressed
anotherpaper to the Academy of Sciences,
in which he lays down the following pro-
sitions:—l. The sounds of fish, result-
ng from the vibration of the intrinsic
muscles of the pneumatic bladder, are
distinguishable from the others by their
purity, their duration, and the variety of
their tone. 2. In those kinds of fish
which emit such sounds, the mullet, for
instance, the pneumatic bladder consti-
tutes a distinct apparatus for the gene-
ration of sound. 3. The intrinsic muscles
of this apparatus are different from the
others, and the nerves which animate
them are peculiar to it, 4. It is these
muscles which produce the sounds in
question 5. The pneumatic bladder has
a very perceptible motion, frequently
repeated when the sounds are heard.
The intensity of the sounds produced by
a large mullet or other fish of the Trigla
or Zeus genus, may be heard from a dis-
tance of about twenty feet. 7. The fish that are most perfectly endowed with the
property of emitting sound can vary it to the extent of an octave. .8. These sounds
can either be instantaneous, or last for several minutes. 9. The pitch of the sound
varies not only according to the individuals, species, and genera, but also during
the same emission. 10. The Trigla lucerna possesses the gift of sound in the high-
est degree.—Our author seems not yet to have exhausted his subject."
Exhausted his subject! No, we should think, not. We trust that
before long the learned DR. Dufossé will be enabled to oblige us with
some samples of fish talk, and let us know what sort of language it is
that they converse in. For of course if fish have voices, they must, be
supposed to talk: and no doubt, too, they can sing, if it be true that
they can vary so their tone of voice as to compass the emission of a full
octave of notes. We did not hear the Talking Fish that was shown
here not long since, but we think that piscine orator could scarce have
been so “perfectly cndowed ” with vocal powers as is mentioned of
some finny families in the statement we have quoted. If we remember
rightly, his vocabulary was limited to the words “Papa,” “Mamma;."
and though these no doubt are highly useful in their way, they would
clearly scarce suffice to carry on a conversation for any lengthened
time.
We recollect that in that highly scientific book which, as translate
is now known to us as the Arabian Nights, there is given a report o
the speeches of some fish, who actually talked while they were being
fried. Perhaps if DR. DUFossé continue his investigations, he may so
well interpret the sounds that fish emit, as to acquaint us with their
nguage, and enable us to understand the current talk in all our trout
streams, and ascertain what are the standing topics in our standing
pools. , Quite a new source of interest will be given to our rivers, when
they who fish in them can understand the conversation of their captives,
How old Isa Ac WALTON would have joyed to write the dialogues that
took place in his trout-basket, and how pleasantly would he have
moralised on what he overheard |
SHAKSPEARE speaks of books being found in * brooks, and,
perhaps if fish can talk, they can also read and write. Indeed there is
no saying how well they may be educated, or what labour they may
take for the improvement of their voice. For aught we know, the
turbot we had yesterday for dinner may have been a music-master in a
family of flatfish, and have assisted many a mullet in the practice of its
scales. Every one has heard of the Whistling Qyster; and after what
has been revealed to us by DR. DUFossé, we shall daily now expect to
hear a singing salmon, and perhaps a warbling whelk, We only ho
that any finny vocalists that come before the public will, like good cold-
blooded creatures, take care to keep their tempers cool; and if they
feel disposed by jealousy to º will be careful how they give their
feelings vent in words, for of all talkers alive surely fish are the most
likely to know somewhat of “Billingsgate.”
That a cod fish can produce a sound, we certainly do not dispute;
and we are quite willing to take evidence to show it has a voice. "Any
of our readers therefore who may happen to get hold of a fine fish of
this description, and feel a doubt if it can speak, are, in the interests of
science, begged to forward it at once, carriage paid, to us in Fleet
#: * they may rest assured the matter shall be carefully
1scussed.

ONE OF SHAFTESBURY'S CHARACTERISTICS.
THE EARL of SHAFTESBURY is known to be a serious nobleman,
but few, º: know how very serious the noble lord is. The sub-
joined extract from a speech which his Lordship is reported to have
delivered on the º
ness so profound as to
Bill in the House of Lords exhibits a serious-
e impervious to a joke:—a
“He recollected perfectly well, as showing how little the greatest medical
authorities were uainted with what was º on in the world, that when the
sanity or insanity of a lady was in question, he (the EARL of SHAFTEsbury) was
maintaining strongly that she was sane and fully capable of managing herself and
her affairs, when a medical gentleman came up to him and said, “But, my Lord,
you do not know that that lady has subscribed to the conversion of the Jews?"
(Laughter). If that gentleman had been acquainted with the world he would have
known.. hundreds of thousands of persons of the most sane minds had done the
same thing.”
Innocent LoRD SHAFTESBURY | If that nobleman had been better
acquainted than he is with a wicked world, he would have discerned
that the question insinuating subscription to the conversion of the Jews
to be an act of insanity was banter; that the practitioner who ventured
to put it to him was in doing so, ing the liberty of, as the common
; say, chaffing him. It is most likely that the medical wag was
sufficiently well acquainted with the world not only, to know that

PERHAPS THE MOST IMPERTINENT THING ON RECORD.
STREET Boy. “Carry yer Sword 'ome for yer, Sir?”
MEANS FOR A GREAT MONUMENT.
It is proposed that the British public should go to
Mull for the monolith to be erected under the form of an
obelisk in º Park. If they do, it is to be hoped that
the name, of the place whence that national monument
will have been derived may not turn out to be a term of
all denominations the most applicable to the memorial
when completed. Wheresoever they have been begun,
most of our testimonials, whether to departed or living
worth, have hitherto ended in a Mull.
It is said that not enough º has as yet been sub-
scribed for the purpose of fº. the monolith at Mull,
and conveying it to Kensington. Heretofore we have at
least been always, able to pay handsomely for a failure;
can we no longer do even that? If we have not the skill
to carve a stone of moderate size handsomely, have we not
the wealth sufficient to cut out and hoist a huge ugly one?
If there is any limit to the subscription for the contem-
plated monolith but that which is determined by the
expense of the undertaking, it must be that of insuffi-
ciency of means, to meet, that expense. classes of
persons will gladly contribute to so popular an object,
in proportion to their means. The means of some are
slender; but that consideration will not prevent them from
subscribing a certain amount, if only those means are
certain. Others, however, there are, whose means are not
only slender, but *...". and these persons, who may
live to be old and lose their employment, and many of
whom have families to provide for, feel bound to save every
farthing of which they are not deprived by Schedule D.
The House of Commons is mainly constituted ºf gentle-
men of fixed property, and always must be, notwithstanding
what MR BRIGHT says, until its majority is composed ºf
people who live º their earnings, which it is not likely
ever to be, even if the working classes are num y
represented. Who can earn his bread, and at the same
time represent his constituents, unless they, pay him well
enough to make it worth his while? Cheap luxuries com-
pensate an independent gentleman's Income-Tax, but not
the Income Tax of those who can afford no luxuries at any
#;" A generous demonstration in the form of a mono-
ith is a luxury. In that luxury, however, tº numbers
of persons who now abstain from it might enabled to
indulge if the Government could possibly manage to effect
an equitable adjustment of direct taxation.
s
A WELL-MEANING WIRITER.
THE subjoined curiosity of construction occurs in a leader in a con-
temporary journal relative to the working classes:-
“Hence the patience and fortitude with which they have borne the privations
of the past winter, but which we trust will soon be at an end.”
The º h may be said to afford a butt to the critical
sharpshooter. But for the “but” in it we should of course suppose
it to express the hope of a speedy cessation of the still remaining W.
vations of the past winter. e will cherish that supposition. e
will not allow ourselves to be misled by a superfluous conjunction,
We will believe that the writer of the passage above quoted, intended
to represent himself and his coadjutors as trusting that the privations
of the past winter will soon be at an end, and not as trusting that there
will soon be an end of the patience and fortitude with which the work-
ing classes are bearing them.
SOMETHING “IN NUBIBUS.”
. A SHORT time, ago, we were distressed to read that Saturn had lost
his rings! . Whether that steady-going old star had dropt them at one
of his periodical Saturnalias, or whether he was obliged to part with
them under a temporary financial pressure, our telescopic mind is at a
loss to say; but we are sure our readers will rejoice with us at learning
that Saturn has got his rings back again. They shine as brilliantly as
ever, (in fact, many of the diamonds are to the full as big as stars, and
sparkle not. less lustrously,) and from their increased brilliancy, we
draw the bright reflection that Saturn may probably have only sent his
rings to be cleaned; or it may be, since Saturm is the wearer of the
belt, and consequently is the Champion of the Celestial Ring, that his
love of fair play made him take his rings off, insomuch as he had been
challenged to have a round or two with some refractory, star, who was
ºut sky-larking. We wish PROFEssoR AIREY would throw a light on
this misty subject, for we are forced to confess that at present it is
terribly clouded in obscurity.
“THE EARS OF DIONYSIUS.”
[Advertise:MENT.]
MR. Dion Boucicault feels it, necessary to give, notice to the
Public that he prohibits them, for the future, from speaking of any of
the group of dramas invented or edited by himself, in º which may
imply that such work is dependent upon scenery, action, effects, or any:
thing else but the genius of MR. DION BoucICAULT for its unequalled
success. Any violation of this regulation will be punished by MR.
DION BOUCICAULT by the giving orders to the menials of the theatre
not to admit any person who may have been guilty of such impertinence.
MR. D10N BoucIGAUIT begs further to announce that the police have
instructions to take into custody any º who may have the pre-
sumption to retire from the theatre until the fall of the curtain and the
appearance of MR. DIon BoucICAULT before the same. MR. DION
Boucicault earnestly hopes that the populace of London will see the
wisdom of obeying his instructions, and not subjecting him to the
unpleasant necessity of punishing disobedience.
3rd Monday in Lent, 1862. DION BOUCICAULT.
A RESPECTFUL QUERY.
IF every gipsy who haunts our areas and inveigles silly servant-maids
into having their fortunes told, or every, tuppenny-h'apenny impostor
who professes to cast, nativities for half-crowns, and discover stolen
goods for shillings, is liable to, and frequently suffers punishment as a
rogue and vagabond—why should MR. ForsTER, who is now turning
over the circulating medium to such a very handsome tune, pocketi
his hundreds from the silly swells of both sexes who attend his spiritua
séances, be allowed to go scot-free? It would becurious to ascertain if
this ingenious gentleman would find the spirits as ready to turn the
crank, or work the treadmill for him, as they are to spin the commoner
articles of furniture. Surely he who has turned so many tables, deserves
to have the tables turned, at last, on him, till he has tested how long
spiritualism can be kept up on a diet of skilly, and whether spirit-hands
are amenable to “the darbies.”

In the Court of Bankruptcy, the other day,
occurred a case wherein the bankrupt was
described, as a “literary author,” the liabilities
being declared to be “about ; no assets.”
It was stated that “some arrangements were
in progress for paying the creditors a composi-

ties of this literary gentleman, the composition
which arrangements are in prºgress for paying

- THE GALWANIC CRINOLINE
. THE French admire ideas. Their, Empress, according to the sub-
ined extract from the Athenæum, is about to astonish them with a
rilliant one:— -
“Amongst the curious items of Paris gossip is a statement that the EMPREss,
desirous of shining even more brightly than being set in diamonds, is having a
coronet constructed that will be irradiated by electric light. It is to consist of a
row of small glass balls, through each of which flashes of electric light will pass.
This is easy of comprehension, but, as we are not told from whence the electric
light is to be derived, it is not so easy to understand how her Majesty is to carry
about the necessary battery. Perhaps a voluminous steel hoop may be made
subservient to the purpose."
We are about to make a man's fortune. There are several con-
ceivable contrivances by which a lady might manage to carry about her
rson the battery necessary to illuminate the diamonds on her head.
ne, for example, might consist, not, indeed, as above suggested, of a
steel hoop, but of a series of double lº each of them formed by a
zinc and copper hoop in combination. The hoops, might be enclosed in
gutta percha or India-rubber tubes, containing diluted sulphuric acid,
and, properly connected by wires likewise insulated, would constitute
at once a battery and a crinoline.
But there is already in existence a galvanic combination, more con-
venient than hoops, and º capable of being converted by an
arrangement of insulating tubes into a crinoline. Need womention it;
MR. Pulveºach ER ought to come down handsomely to us for thus
puffing his Galvanic Chain.
“Who’s dat Knocking at the Door?”
SPEAKING of the new Ministry in Italy, the Patrie says the following:
“sigson Ratazzi has decided to take the initiative in all European combina-
tions which may bring about a diplomatic solution of the Venetian question."
Stripped of surplus verbiage, this statement simply means that, at
every council chamber where he thinks he can get audience, for his
views regarding Venice, Signor RATAzzI will soon be giving a
rat-tat.

say, that I am more than sorry that such a document came out except
in your pages.

truculent wretches, but I should be ashamed of replying to them in an
un-Christian or impolite way.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MARCH 17. †. LORD NORMANBY º. his belief that the
late Governments of Italy still reigned in the hearts of the people, and
he abused the Government of VICTOR-EMMANUEL. It is needless to
say that, still less, how, LORD_RussBLL, disposed of the NoHMANBY
twaddle, but it had, also the effect of calling up LoRD MALMESBURy,
who declared that when in office he did everything to promote peace in
the south of Europe, and that if his advice had been tº. at least one
hundred thousand men, killed in the Italian war, would have been alive,
He had been charged with Austrian partialities, but both Austria, and
Italy had found fault with him. Upon which we may remark, with
deference to the amiable MALMESBURY, that though doubtless a judg-
ment from the bench ought to displease both sides, it is not an irre-
fragable proof of a man's having done his duty by two parties that both
agree that he has done it to neither.
An º by MR, LAYARD shows that the Americans have had
a little MAson and SLIDELL affair at Tangier. He had, on a former
night, mentioned that two persons from the Sumter had been seized at
Tangier on the demand of the U. S. Consul, but that they had after-
wards been set at liberty. The only error in the statement lay in the
last little sentence. Instead of being set at liberty they were set on
board a Federal war-vessel, the Ino, and by her transferred to a mer-
chant ship, to be sent off to the United States. The act was a gross
violation of the right of asylum, and MR, LAYARD hoped that the
American Government would act, rightly. After the M. and S. affair
it would be premature to say, that, they will not—only the fleet of
Mogh'rib-el-acsa (quite right, Cox, that is the native name of Morocco,
or, as you accurately say, Marocco) is not a very large one, and we are
not aware that there is a MULEY BEN RUssell, to intimate clearly that
the “fellows' must be i. up.
MR. MorFAT, the tea-dealer, &mded when the Budget would be
brought in. MR. GLADSTONE replied, that he hoped to let his cat out
of the bag on the third of April.
Then was resumed the HoRsFALL debate on International Maritime
Law. But MR. CoBDEN, who was to have begun, was hoarse, so MR.
LINDsay, for the shipowners, contended that *private property ought
to be respected in time of war, but he only asked that the present state
of the law might be declared unsatisfactory. . The LoRD Advocate, in
a very able speech, exposed the absurdity of the first proposition, and
declared the second to be vague and useless. After several speeches,
in which the same things were repeated with more or less dilution, MR;
BRIGHT signified his adhesion to the HoRSEALL proposition, and charged
LoRD PALMERSTON with having, when “starring in the provinces,”
uttered glowing admiration of the Declaration of Paris, and expresse
a hope that its principle would be carried further. SIR. Roun DELL
PALMER made an able onslaught upon the innovators, and LORD
PALMERSTON frankly admitted that he had entirely altered his opinion
since his speech at #. Needless to say that MR. DISRAELI
made the most of this admission, and informed the PREMIER that in
future his most solemn warnings could have little weight in the House.
iſ But no battle was given, and MR. HoRSFALL withdrew his resolution.
Tuesday. After a strong and valuable º by Lord Overstone
in favour of the Revised §. there was a slight conversation on the
Second Reading of a Bill for making it unnecessary to send (as in the
case of ANDERson, the escaped slave), writs of habeas corpus to any
colony in which the Havehiscarcass is in use. LoRD CHELMSFORD-
notice this—made agentle suggestion for improving the language of that
Bill, and LoRD WESTBURy—notice this—as gently assented. But this
amiability was only—
“The torrent's smoothness ere it dash below.”
A few minutes later, and LoRD CHELMsFord, in the presence of a
large House and a good many ladies, who had mustered on the under-
standing that º objectionable was to take place, was well into
a savage attack upon the LoRD CHANCELLOR, nominally on behalf of
those officials of the late Insolvent Court who have been done out of
their incomes through an omission in the new Bankruptcy Act. LoRD
CHELMsFoED must have imagined himself, back into MR. THESIGER,
for he quite forgot his coronet manners, and imputed to LORD, WEST-
BURY, whom he must have regarded as only MR. BETHELL, negligence
ignorance, insincerity, untruthfulness, incivility, tyranny, slander, an
a great º bad things, of which a nobleman must be entirely
incapable. But LoRD WESTBURY is not entirely incapable of self;
defence, and when LoRD, CHELMsFoRD had done, and his backers had
finished applauding, the CHANCELLOR, rose,
“With eye, though calm, determined not to spare."
And it cannot be said that he exactly spared either MR. THESIGER,
or the rod. His Lordship accused his assailant of hating the LORD

CHANCELLOR, of having been in daily and conſidential intercourse with
him for weeks, without hinting at an intention of making this malig:
nant attack, of being actuated {!}. and of being guilty of a series of
perversions of fact and truth, of violence, and of insinuations which the
respondent was ashamed to hear. As in the old days, a schoolmaster
expounded the gerunds and supines to the negligent scholar, between
the swishes of the birch, so did LoRD WESTBURY explain the case, of
the clerks, every now and then warming up LoRD CHELMsFoRD with a
singing slash. When Loºp Wesraury had done with the offender
LoRD DERBY rose to protest against such severity of punishment, and
urged upon the tº...". desirability of being more courteous,
and especially of not ing use of language lºſiº belief that
he was infinitely the superior of those whom he was addressing. LoRD
GRANVILLE, in return, described this lecture as undeserved. LoRD
Russell, far too lofty to be stirred by the combats of mortals, simply
intimated that Government were spotless in reference to the business
the Duke or SoMERSET managed to toss a taunt of suppressio veria
LoRD CHELMSFORD, and it ºf then about nine o'clock, the aristo-

ah! Why—0, yes—they are to wait, and in fact, do the best they can,
and cºol; feels regret and all that... But didn't, the great, lawyers
o at one another in style, and wasn’t it worth while coming down for
that sort of thing?
As for the Commons, they did comparatively flat, business. LoRD
HENRY LENNox made a speech, urging that one Minister of the Crown
ought to be responsible to the House in regard to all estimates in
reference to Education, Science, and Art. Except in regard to SIR
CHARLEs EASTLAKE, who was attacked and defended according to
formula, the discussion may be called a British Museum Debate.
LoRD HENRY's chief attack was on the trustees of that establishment,
who, he thought, neither did nor could do their duty. MR. GREGoRY
seconded him, remarking that the House had plenty of time to con-
sider the subject, as there was nothing to do, . there was not to be a
Sensation Budget., MR. GLADSTONE, a trustee, replied with much
skill, and vindicated his colleagues, but the most important point in his
speech was the announcement that a great department of the Museum
is to be transferred to, another site. T
This, of course, means that what
an Irishman would call the Dead Zoological Gardens are to be got rid
of. Well, while the Government is turning out the beasts, would it be
kind enough to do something of the same kind in the noble Readin
Room. At present this apartment, intended for the student, is .
with a mass of boys, and others, who exclude the students, and who
use the Museum, chiefly because the room is warm and comfortable,
but partly to study such recondite works, not elsewhere to be procured
as Kºś Latin Dictionary, MR. Bohn's translations, and
GUTHRIE’s Geographical Grammar. There really should be a clearance.
We would not effect this upon a question of age, a boy who wants to
look through half a dozen of the Fathers is more worthy of a seat than his
Father who wants to turn up a passage in DRYDEN's Virgil. Let us
look through the tickets and see what sort of books fellows ask for.
The result would show whose tickets may advantageously be cancelled.
MR. CoNINGHAM made a smart speech, and characterised the Inter-
national Exhibition Pºliſ as a monstrous architectural abortion,
and the result of the art-school at Kensington. MR. DISRAELI spoke
up for the National Portrait Gallery, but intimated his belief that
ºd was too large, too busy, and too engrossed with the great
affairs of the world ever to be very great in Art, which flourished only
in small communities, like Athens and Florence. for HENny withdrew
his proposition. Thus, the House of Commons was discussing painting
and comparative anatomy, while the House of Lords was enjoying a
gladiatorial combat.
A debate on the condition of the British merchants in China gave MR.
LAYARD an opportunity of stating his opinion of the Chinese Rebels,
whom he described as a mob of murderous scoundrels, without any
object but plunder, and whose pretended religion was the merest
hypocrisy. To be sure on one point they are more civilised than divers
nglishmen, as they have a law that no man is to kick his wife when
she is especially helpless. It would seem that we are to put a decided
stop to the atrocities of these Taepings, at least in the districts in which
we have colonised.
MR. CowPER brought in his Bill for Embanking the Thames—of
course MR. AYRTON and SIR.John SHELLEY tried to hinder it, and they
were very º rebuked by DR. BRADY, who said that without a
grand opening of this sort London would never be what it ought to be.
Cox thought it would injure the foundations of Canonbury Tower—
no, by the way, he said London º but one was as likely as the other.
MR. Coning HAM, who called himself Member for London-super-Mare—
which means Brighton, supported the Bill. Then SIR GEORGE Bowy ER
brought in another for the better Government of the Inns of Court, and
for Constituting a Court of discipline to deal with cases in which a MR.
Edwin JAMEs, a MR. DIGBY SEYMOUR, or other gentlemen of the Bar
may come under the unfavourable notice of the Benchers. . And lastly
the Lord Advocate introduced an Educational Measure for that par
of England called Scotland (eh, PROFEssoR BLACKLE!). It is to pro-
mote an extension of the old Scottish system, which everybody who
understands the subject knows to work admirably.
Wednesday was a quiet day, the only business transacted was the rejec-
stion of a Bill of MR.AYRTON's for making employers liable to compensate
workmen or their families for the results of accidents. The present
law affords compensation where negligence is proved on the part of the
employer, and the House held this to be sufficient, and SIR MoRTON
Peto, as a large employer of labour, said that the carelessness of the
workmen was simply incredible. . In blasting, they would not use the
patent fuse, and would smoke amid barrels of powder, and their reckless
usage of the safety lamp is notorious. The Bill was regarded as a bit
of Tower Hamlets clap-trap, and treated accordingly.
Thursday. The ground-swell after Tuesday's storm still felt in the
Lords, the CHANCELLOR advancing a series of dates to show that he
had not such knowledge of the case of the afflicted clerks as was all
t|and LQRp DERBY replying that he ought to have had. The Lords t en
applied themselves to the question of the Education of the People, and
the Bishop of Oxford had another fling at the Revised Code, but was
|. º: up. Also some inconceivable joke was exchanged
etween the Bishop and LoRD GRANVILLE about a parable and a para-
bolic curve, which joke Mr. Punch invites the Prelate and the President
to put in writing and send to him, for at present he cannot see either
its fun, or its connection with the religious education of the poor.
MR. CowPER explained that the people in Hamilton Place had no
idea of permitting their quiet cul de sac to be cut through to let people
come down Park Lane to the Exhibition, but that he should like to widen
the lane, itself. , The House then went into Committee on the Irish
Fairs Bill, which related to weights and measures. It does not seem
to allude *''' Donnybrook, nor is there the least reason why
it should. The Bill for giving Čopyright in Works of Art went
through Committee, and if Cox was facetiously inclined to move a
Negative about the Photographs, he withheld that practical epigram.
Friday. Apropos of him, Wycombe has been carried by MR. REMING-
TON MILLs, who was vanquished by the terrible. Cox in Finsbury.
This leaves parties as they were. But a Conservative, MR. MoRRITT,
has come in, rice MR. CAYLEY, Liberal, for the North Riding—do you
observe that, MR, BRAND F
Nothing to-night in the Senate, except that LoRD ELLENBoRough in
presenting some ridiculous petitions, against the Revised Code, took
care to state that he had not the slightest sympathy with the prayers
of the cacklers. Certainly not. As the nursery book says,
“The Elephant is Wise."
LoRD Normanby, a fitting messenger to send on—well, an unwise
man's errand, brought a petition from MR. URQUhART against the Bill
for relieving the QUEEN from the clerkly drudgery of signing commis-
sions, URQUIIART has probably some crack-brain notion that the
abandoning the signature is a device of Russia, who will, in war-time,
persuade our officers that they need not fight for a QUEEN who has not
actually signed their warrant to serve her. “How blest are we that
are not simple men.”
That deloightful pleece of recreation, the Phaynix Park, is to be
adjyorned with trees and other conſectionaries in the hoighth of
iligance, and at the expinse of Government.
Qame a debate on the question whether England ought to pay for
Colonial fortifications. SiR GEORGE LEwis very properly said that no
rule could be laid down. Half the blunders and bothers of the day
arise from attempts to lay down rules for everything. If Mr. Punch
had leisure for codification, the thing might be done, but nobody else
should speak dogmatically. Everything depends upon circumstances—
though, as circumstances are surroundings, we consider that phrase to
be an Irishism. As a finish to the week, MR, MILNER GIBSON brought
in a Bill for amending, the Merchant Shipping Acts. The subject is
highly important to the commercial-marines, who have Mr. Punch's
liberty to read MR. GIBSON's speech—the civilised reader need only be
told that it was about pilots, and lights, at sea, and damage to cargo,
and liens on freights, and all that sort of stuff.
UNPARALLELED EPIGRAM.
IN a leading article in the Star (a sensible one too) upon the loan of
lordly names to projects for gulling the public, there occurs a gem of
such translucent effulgence that we must set it clear. Speaking of the
EARL OF SHREWSBURY's tact in giving his name to a scheme in which
he took care not to be entangled, the writer says,
“THE EARL was shREwd As well. As SHREwsBURY.”
Will the writer who performed this extraordinary feat come over to us
immediately on Pºi these lines, and if we are notin, will he go up-
stairs, consider himself engaged for the rest of his life, and begin
throwing off similar brilliancies for us. Salary no object. Shrewd as
well as SHREwsBURY | We have laughed one hour by the clock of the
capital of Shrooshire.

THE PRINCE AND THE PYRAMID.
A Poem composed upon reading in the Times (a daily newspaper), dated
Monday, the 17th ºf March, 1862, a description of the PRINCE of
WALEs’s Egyptian Tour. ,
BY MARTYR FAKEER. CUPPER.
Now Sol from yonder grey horizon winks,
And ALBERT Edward rises near the Sphynx,
He leaves the tent the Pasha's care had raised,
And looks upon the desert quite amazed. -
Gaze on, brave Prince, the thought must surely strike
That in your country there is nothing like
Unto that Pyramid whose curious pile
Has stood so many years beside the Nile,
Or like the sand that makes the thought occur,
How fast our sands of life are fleeting, Sir.
You now are far from Windsor’s hoary towers,
Saint James's brick, and Osborne's beauteous bowers,
And on your mind must come this feeling high,
That land and sea 'twixt you and England lie.
And yet what is it practically, sire?
I should say, Sir) with that electric wire?
, when the Pharaohs swayed this region fine;
Or CLEOPATRA dropped that fishing line;
Or the young MEMNoN by Achilles' hands
Fell, though his bust in the Museum stands;
Or when AMENOPHIs, the fierce and brave,
With all his chariots sank beneath the wave,
Here let me scorn the Essays and Reviews,
hat seek to steal that :::::::::: the Jews).
Or when in later times stern MEHEMET
Slaughtered the Mamelukes, ungrateful set,
There was small thought, O Prince of England, then,
That lightning e'er should write with iron pen.
'Tis sweet to think that standing on these sands
You can send messages to distant lands;
And while they go, can muse, on SHAKspeARE's plan,
And say, “O what a piece of work is maniº
But up, young Prince, before the hour is late,
Behold yon string of dromedaries wait,
The matutinal meal discussed and done,
Now for the Pyramid, and meet the Sun.
How many sums have shone since that was built,
And shone, alas, on many scenes of guilt.
We reach the base; ascend as well you may,
That corner's broken stones present the way.
For youth like yours exertion hath its charms,
And you repulse those Arabs' dingy arms, .
You climb alone, and swift the height you gain,
Your panting suite toil after you in vain;
And now upon the apex, Sir, you stand,
And rapidly survey old £gypt's land:
Yonder is Cairo, as you may suppose,
And at your feet the Nilus riverflows.
No English Heir Apparent to the Crown
Ever before upon that scene looked down.
Omens are heathen things, but Opermit
A thought from Poet-lip not all unfit.
Even as the platform on that mighty block
Rests on a basis firm as any rock,
So may the Throne of England long endure,
Built on foundations solid and secure.
ſºmeback, my muse, and wear a sober brow,
That dazzling flight of Fancy’s overnow.
Paid is the visit. On yon loftiest stone
Names are cut deep-our Prince has gut his own,
Or modestly (lest he might seem to claim
What's ABBA's Pasha’s, by his full-writ name)
Quts his initials—Vowels—then descends
Accompanied by his respectful friends.
And so to Cairo. On his princely way
What thoughts arose ’tis not for me to say,
But for myself, delighted and amused,
The story of his journey Iperused,
Cried, “Might I join his party—would I could!
A proverb now and then might do him good.”
But, circumstance o'er which I’ve no control
Prohibits what I wish with all my soul,
Not that I’d seek, of course, with envious teeth
otear a leaf from CANoN STANLEY’s wreath),
“No,” I exclaimed, “but I shall do no wrong
If I embalm the tale in deathless song,
And 'neath a Prince's Vowels bid folks see
A Poet's Consonants, his M. F. C.”
NOTES.
Line 1. Now Sol. The Latin word for the Sun. Luna is Latin for the Moon.
Consult Ainsworth, LITTLEros, and SMITH.
Line 4. Quite amazed. I hasten to disavow the slightest idea of implying that
the Prince's amazement was undignified, but I believe that no person, however well
educated and prepared by reading and reflection for beholding a new scene, can
gaze upon it for the first time without sensations of a novel character.
Line 12, Beauteous bowers. I have not had the advantage of examining the
locality, but from the good taste of the Royal Family, and the scenery of the Isle of
Wight, I am justified in the use of the phrase.
Line 18. That fishing line. The angling contest between ANTony and CLEoPATRA,
and the diverting stratagem, by which the Roman hero was made ridiculous, are
fully described in Rollin's Ancient History.
Line 23, Essays and Reviews. At the same time I am far from asserting that it
is impossible that some of the authors should not be unimbued with convictions
that they are not unjustified.
Line 33. Before the Hour. It would be much to my regret were this e sup-
1.4% impute indolence to the Prince, whose activity is as proverbial as my phi-
osophy.
Line 44. After you in vain. ... I mean no disrespect to the physical capabilities of
the gentlemen in attendance, but it is reasonable that they should be outstripped
by a young man. Indeed the line is a compliment, as recognising their being grave
and reverend seniors.
Line 51.0 permit. If I have ventured too high into the realms of fancy, the
generous reader will remember that the Pyramid is one of the very highest edifices
in the world, and will allow for the excitement of imaginary exaltation.
Line 60. Has cut his own. This e has Fº me much uneasiness. I have
no knowledge that the Prince did anything of the kind. Yet several persons of
my acquaintance, and of a princely character, have done it. The verse shall stand.
If the statement be erroneous, it can do little harm, and if not, in a few years the
circumstance will be forgotten, as when the loose stones on the top of the Pyramid
are covered with inscriptions, the Arabs turn them over to offer a tablet for new
arrivals, thus leaving no stone unturned to obtain backsheesh.
John Bright in his Place.
It seems a pity that so clever a man as MR. BRIGHT should remain
excluded from office; yet he could hardly be a member of any Cabinet
resolved to maintain the national independence and defences. Should
the Derbyite opposition turn out LoRi, PALMERston's Government, as
º the help of Irish, priest-ridden mobs, abetted by English Conservative
electors, they will do, if Conservative electors continue to return
Derbyite representatives, then, indeed, there would be a chance for
the Member for Birmingham; who should supersede MALMEspury.
MR. BRIGHT, no doubt, would prove himself a truly Foreign Minister.

WHY is a certain sporting newspaper, folded in another, like a pretty
girl's first ball? - -
Because, don’t you see, it is an Era in a Belle's Life.

REVIVAL OF THE CANINE-FANCY.
Great Match at the Swell Westminster Pit, between Lord D.'s dog
“Chelmsford” and the “Westbury Pup.” From the Westminster
Bell's Life.
This aristocratic place of sporting-resort for the tip-top nobs and
swells, who encourage the true British sports of the canine-fancy,
which have lately gone sadly down in the world, owing to the spooney.
ism of modern milk-and-water manners, which proscribes such sports
as “low”-Heaven save the mark! (“an ounce of civet, good apothe-
cary!”) is once more, we rejoice to º, on its legs .# is now the
scene on two or three nights weekly, of canine “mills,” which recall
the palmy days of 1832, and the old days of the famous dogs of the
“. Reform” breed, whose game “sets-to” used to gather such crowds
of aristocratic backers about the venerable, pit, which preceded the
present rather “gingerbread” erection. Since those halcyon days,
the memorable matches between those game old bulldogs Broughan.
and Campbell, have reflected a temporary lustre on the faded glories of
the eanine-fancy, in this its aristocratic “crib,” but still it was not to
be denied, the “sport” had waned, and our “nobs” were growing too
dainty to handle º without kid gloves. Biting a tail was voted
low, and choking off a biter not to be thought off. Few indeed would
even confess to breeding, much less backing, canine combatants of the
old Tearem strain-dogs that would pin º: on four legs, and
defied human force to tail or choke em off, when once their tushes had
met in their adversary’s “beef.”
But “a change has come o'er the spirit of our dream,” and “the
game's alive again,” in the nobby new Westminster fit. A bull.
terrier of extraordinary game, and go, has been lately entered for
matches at, this, pit, who certainly recalls the best performances of the
celebrated dog Brougham, and is, if anything, a quicker dog on his legs,
sharper in his bite, stronger in the jaw, and immeasurably nastier in
temper, than that old canine hero. The Westbury Pup, as the new dog
is christened, gained his early laurels in a long series § combats in the
numerous pits about Lincoln's Inn Fields and Westminster Hall, at
which he won every match he was entered for. Here the Westbury
Pup, then known as Kewsey, was backed at long odds, against man
dogs who have had their day-varmint of the regular hard-mouth
long-winded, artful sort, most in requisition for the butchering style o
me carried on in these well known sporting neighbourhoods. Thence
the Pup worked his wa º: victory } victory, till he fell into the
knowing hands of the %. eholder,” who was then superintending the
matches in the Saint Stephen's Pit, next door to the nobby crib at
which the Pup is now figuring. The “Bottleholder” was very cock
about his new dog. He kept im dark at first—entering him as Litt
Bethel, and backing him heavily for all sorts of pººl.
monkey-worrying to rat-killing—to say nothing of a host of matches
against the gamest and wickedest dogs that could be brought into the
Pit, any breed, or weight... Under the “Bottleholder's" judicious
handling, the Pup's style of §§ improved; he got less “rushy,”
and less given to snap right and, left, and waste his strength in biting
without purpose, which is the danger with him, for he is so fond of
fighting, that rather than not fight, he’d f in at an old woman's petti-
coat, or a French poodle. The Pup is still understood to be under the
“Bottleholder's "charge, but now that he has been entered at the
nobby crib where he now figures, the “Bottleholder” no longer
handles him in the Pit, or appears personally as his backer. This task
has devolved on little Johnny Russell and GEORGY Gower, alias
“The President,” who are understood to make matches for the Pup,
and wait upon him in the Pit. An impromptu match was made, the
other day, to #. the Pup against Rupert, the well-known and high
bred British bull-dog, which ended in a worry and a wrangle, the stakes
being claimed on both sides, but retained by the umpire.
Since this little event there have been a series of matches on the
tapis between the Westbury Pup's backers and those of the well-known

game dogs St. Leonards, Cranworth, and, Wensleydale, and some very
exciting little “mills” are understood to have come off in the private-
rooms attached to the crib, from which the public have been excluded.
But the interest of all these encounters is thrown into the shade by the
timatch which came off on Tuesday, the 18th ult, between the
up and Chelmsford, a well-bred, and stilſ game, though not fresh, dog,
the property of a nobby lat, who have started an opposition, in the
canine line, to the “Bottleholder.” -
Chelmsford had been heavily backed by this lot, at evens, but John NY
and GeoRGY were nuts on their pet, the Pup, and tabled their money
freely. It was whispered the Pup had suffered heavy punishment in
one of the private matches we have already, alluded to, in which
Chelmsford had had the best of it; but though the latter is a powerful,
and sharp dog, there is nothing in his public performances to warrant
his backers in laying odds on him against so terrible a punisher, as the
Pup, who never uses his teeth without leaving his mark, The “crib."
is not generally attended by a large muster even of the aristocratic
Fancy, who keep up the House; but on Wednesday night there was an
unusually large attendance, and great interest was shown in the match,
and a good deal of money change hands, Chelmsford being, if anything,
the favourite, but the Pºp's backers getting on, whenever they could,
and bouncing a good deal. - - -
On the dogs being brought into the pit, Chelmsford stood higher, in
the ºff. and showed less beef about him; but he is a less powerful dog
than the Pup, and his jaw is not so well made for gº; nor did his
grinders, as far as we could see, look so formidable. He is, however, an
uncommonly quick dog on his legs, works round like a skip jack, an
sticks well to his work, showing both dash and bottom, but these will not
compensate for want of beam and ...; in horse or dog. Though an
old dog, and having fought no end of matches, he does nºt shºw anymarks
of punishment about the nob, but looks good tempered and inoffensive.
he Westbury Pup is a shorter, thicker, roomier dog, with a good deal
of the terrier, mixed º the bull in his figurehead. His power of
#. is tremendous, and his range of ivories in sº order. He looks
ike fighting, every inch from stern to muzzle. He has less dash in his
action than his adversary, but gets into his dog in a quiet, insidious,
easy style, which it is a treat to watch, but when he does get within
grip, the way he makes his teeth meet, is what our transatlantic friends
would call, a caution.
A TILT AT THE TURNPIKES.
Fall fish the pike
is themostgreedy
and voracious.
- And certainly
these epithets
may with e mal
Sº,
\s -
justice be applied
to the turn-pike.
This rapacious
monster, ever
keeps its jaws
open to receive
its prey, and no
amountof victims
ever seem to sa-
tiate it. What
myriads on the
Derby Day are
grabbed to fill
its maw, and yet who ever heard of its showing signs of surfeit?
The other day a deputation called on SIR GEORGE GREY to present
a memorial from people in South London, praying that the Sºrey
turnpike-gates might be abolished. Our good friend, Wiscount WIL;
LiAMs introduced the deputation, and showed himself, much more at
home in thejº of South, London and parts thereto adjacent,
than he seemed the other night to be in that of Squth America when,
in a debate on the Packet Service estimate, he doubted whether Buenos
Ayres and Callao were in the latter country, a doubt which MR. CRAW.
Ford was so kind as to clear up. In the course of his remarks, which
were very much more sensible than are some he now and then is wont
to let drop in the House, the Wiscount said that the memorialists-
** Felt that the continuance of these †. constituted a peculiar grievance in the
midst of a §: neighbourhood, and what they asked was, that these gates and
these side-bars might be omitted from the Continuance Act of the Surrey and Sus-
sex Trust. The ds on which they did so were that eleven years ago, an Act
was d which continued these gates, in order to pay off certain debts owing by
the Trust for these roads. All the debts had now been paid off, and the Trust were
anxious to have the power of continuing those bars; for what purpose the inhabi-
tants were not aware. They were prepared to take and maintain the roads by levy-
ing a common rate. They were now obliged to pay for the curves, and stone pave-
ments, and the Trust only maintained the middle of the roads. The toll-bars were
a great nuisance, and a vast number of vehicles went over the bye roads, which had
to be maintained by the parishes, in order to avoid paying the tolls, and they thus
broke up the roads and caused a great additional expense to the parishes over which
The fight was a very lively one, and we have seldom—in any pit—
seen a greater amount of punishment inflicted in the same time.
Chelmsford made a rush, as soon as his backer let him go, and pinned
the Pup by the scruff of the neck, shaking him violently. The Pup
was evidently taken aback by the suddenness and impetuosity of the old
dog's rush, and seemed “in queer street” for a few seconds, duri
which the old dog º his punishing visitation on the Pup's he
and body. (“First blood” was called for the old dog.)
But the Pup was not long in pulling himself round, and when he did
get his wind, his return on the old dog's weak points was terrific. He
rushed in º and again, and left his mark after every grip. The old
dog managed to shake himself loose, but never again to get a chance of
punishment at the Pup, who worked him round the pit, worrying him,
in terrific style, and at last : "...i him down in the corner, and ap-
pearing resolved to make an end of him altogether, when the backers
interfered, and LoRD D. got his dog away, GeoRGY being forced to bite
º * tail for at least a minute before he could be . to relax
ls in Old.
The old dog was carried out of the pit bleeding heavily, and a good
deal mangled about the head and jaws. The Pup showed comparatively
little signs of punishment, but his backers had great difficulty in getting
his muzzle on, as he repeatedly attempted to break away from them,
and seemed bent on finishing his worry by chawing up the old dog, from
his snout to the tip of his tail.
Though the old dog is no match for the Pºp now, whatever he may
once have been, a gamer fight, while it lasted, has seldom been recorded
in the annals of the canine-fancy—since the great mill of the cele:
brated Kilkenny Cats, which by the bye belongs to the “Feline”
fancy, rather than the “canine.” . It might, indeed be called “short
and sweet,” and now that this manly and truly, British sport, so long
banished from the haunts of a fastidious, and effeminate mobility, has
been thus brilliantly inaugurated in our noble sportsmen's own pit, we
trust that we may often be entertained by as spicy a set-to, as that
which we have recorded, under the ambitious title, which it really
deserve, ºf a, REVIVAL OF THE CANINEFANcy!”
The “Bottleholder” is understood to have objected to the match
altogether, and to have cut up rough with GEORGY about allowing the
Pup to fight. But as GEORGY says, in his quaint way: “If the warmint
will 'ave it, he must 'ave it; 'cos nobody can’t 'old Hinº
they would have to pay if the traffic were allowed to take its natural course. The
Trust meant to introduce a clause for the continuance of these Trusts in the Annual
Continuance Highways Act, and what the deputation asked was, that the Right Hon.
Baronet would be so good as to prevent them from doing so.”
That toll-gates are a nuisance surely no one can dispute, and that a
Turnpike Trust is not always to be trusted, a statement, made by MR:
BRADFIELD, the zealous parliamentary agent of the Toll Reformers, will
perhaps suffice to show:—
“The debts, for the payment of which the Continuance Act had been passed, had
all been paid off four years ago. The Trustees now let the tolls for from £22,000 to
£25,000, while the repairs of the roads only cost £13,000 a-year. The parishes were,
he believed, willing to take this expense upon themselves ; and there was no
reason why a sum so mauch in excess of the actual requirements should be levied by
the Trust. In fact, the whole case of the deputation would be found in the report
of a select committee of the House of Commons, signed by Sir G. C. Lewis in 1850,
with reference to the tolls on the North side of London. They asked no more than
was done with reference to these tolls; and the special reason for the continuance of
the South London tolls having ceased to operate, it was but just and reasonable that
the tolls should cease to exist also. .
“SIR. G. GREY. Where does the difference of the sums collected and that spent on
the repairs of the road go to ?
“Several Gentlemen. Ah! that is just what we should like to know. (Laughter.)"
Persons partial to arithmetic may find in this a puzzling problem to
work out. If the repairs cost £13,000 and the tolls are annually let
for £25,000, where, pray, does the difference of £12,000 annually go,
and where do the trustees themselves expect to go? Certainly until this
little sum be solved, the Trust must be esteemed as one of doubtful credit.
How much trouble is occasioned to the nation by the toll-gates, and
how many tempers are lost yearly through, the loss of a toll-ticket, is
another point suggested for patient calculation, but which we have no
leisure now to pass under review. The elder MR. WELLER considered
that the man who keeps a turnpike-gate must be a gloomy misanthrope
who wishes to revenge himself for being crossed in love, or for having
suffered some other slight or insult, by hiding in a toilhouse, like a
brigand in his cave, and levying black mail upon all who come within
his clutch. “Stand and deliver!” is the cry of these highwaymen
who stop all those who ride or drive on the QUEEN’s highway, an
with no fear of the gallows, say to any traveller, “Your money, or
your wife's ' ". How many more Derby Days will pass before the
public is rid of these road-robbers, we cannot undertake to guess, But
as SIR GEORGE GREY, when he dismissed the deputation, said he had
“the utmost desire to do justice to all parties, and to promote the
convenience of the public,” of course we may anticipate that nothing
further will be done until there is brought to bear a pressure from with;
out. The Government just now is not much given to reform; and
unless the nation itself take up the matter, we fear, that, little will be
done to help the Toll Reformers in their tilting at the gates.

º friend MRs.

has a bare competence and half-a-dozen children left her to support. How must she be
tempted to expend a couple of stamps in applying for “particulars” as to how by a small
Qutlay she may make an easy fortune. Supposing she applies, what, think you, will she get
in return for her spent twopence P Why, believe an º she will get two flimsy scraps
ºf foreign-printed paper, the one entitled “Scheme of the two iºd and forty-second
Lottery of the free, city of Hamburgh of 34,500 tickets and 18,500 prizes, Guaranteed by
Government,” and the other, a short letter. directing her “kind notice” to the same, and
Fº out the many benefits she may derive from the said scheme. Likewise it will refer
er to a business, firm in London for satisfaction that the lottery is a legitimate affair, and
really guaran by the Government of Hamburgh, having actually existed for 120 years.
How many easy fortunes have in all that time been made by it, Mrs. JN-Es is left at liberty
to guess... But as the highest prize obtainable is two hundred thousand marks, which Mrs.
J-NEs will very likely take to mean two hundred thousand pounds, the chances are she will
not trouble herself with any calculations of the odds there are against her pocketing that sum,
but will forward at once the price requested for
a ticket, and will consider it a certainty that
the “easy fortune” will very, soon be hers.
Two hundred thousand, anythings, whether
pounds or pennies, she will think so large a sum,
that she will scarcely give a thought to the
“small º to secure the chance of
getting it. at are a few shillings to such
a princely income, as two hundred, thousand
pounds? for doubtless MRs. J-NEs, like many
other fair accountants, is in the habit of mistaking
a fortune for an income, and of considering that
any sum which falls into her hands will produce
a yearly income equal to itself. So away will
É. the shillings, and back won't come the looked-
or two hundred thousand pounds: and mean-
while in the expectancy of 5.f such a sum,
MRS. J. will doubtless have bought, new clothes
for her children, and have very likely moved
them to a larger house. So that when the dis-
jº. at may be expected comes, and
she discovers, as the odds are, that she has drawn
a blank, it is probable that she will have expended
all her sayings and, be sinking into debt, from
which with her small means it will be difficult to
free herself.
Pray, then, my dear Madam, assist me in pre-
venting poor weak, and thoughtless ladies, like
our young friend MRs. J-NEs, from answering
advertisements such as the above, and º
away postage stamps (which they can ill affor
to waste) in obtaining the particulars of how an
“Easy Fortune may,” if there’s no tricke º
ssibly in one case in ten millions, “be made.”
Such details are a, sad temptation to poor
widows, left with a large family and very little
means. That it is for the fair sex these snares
are chiefly set is shown by having such adver-
tisements put in the Lady's Newspaper, which
is presumed to come especially beneath the
female eye; and now that their true import has
been faithfully exposed, may we not expect that
their appearance there will cease?

RESERVED SEATS WITH A RESERVATION.
Most visitors of the theatre #. there to be amused; but they .#
often meet with diversion besides amusement. Seated in the secon
or third row of the boxes, after the play has begun, whilst they are
closely following the performance in a peculiarly effective part of it,
their attention is suddenly diverted therefrom by a party of people who
have taken places in front, and who, coming in late, oblige everybody
intervening between their seats and the door, to get º and make
room to lefthem pass. This is a diversion which is not only additional,
but entirely opposite to the amusement which is afforded by the players;
it provokesgrims and not laughter; clenched teeth, which hold in lan.
guage that if uttered would perhaps incur the penalty of a crown.
adies and gentlemen who prefer the amusement of listening to the
drama to the diversion ºf mind occasionally, as above, described
experienced in theatres, will read with some satisfaction the annexed
brief report of a little lawsuit, the result of which affords them hope of
future deliverance from that unwelcome diversion:-
“MANAGERs AND Playgoers.-On Saturday, at the Westminster County Court,
was tried an action of YouNow. Buckstone, lessee of the Haymarket Theatre. The
plaintiff, on the 3rd of February, took certain places in the boxes, for which he paid
35s, and received a printed receipt bearing on it the numbers of the seats. Plaintiff
and his friends arrived at the theatre after the first act was over, and found his
eng. seats occupied. He was offered others, but he declined, and demanded
back money, which was refused, and he brought his action for the amount.
The attention of the Judge was called, on the part of the defendant, to a note in the
º which said, “Places secured until the end of the first act only." The Judge,
MR. F. Bayley, held this to be fatal to the plaintiff's case, and entered judgment
for the defendant, calling upon the plaintiff to pay the costs of four witnesses who
were in attendance from the theatre to give evidence, if necessary.”
º
MR.
Playgoers, who are accustomed to go to the play really for the
of seeing and hearing it, ought to be Fº obliged to
oung, the plaintiff in the above-cited case of Young v. Buckstone,
for having generously, out of his own pocket, obtained a 1 decision
which, if MR. Buckstone's good example is º ollowed by
ma rs, will, in some measure secure them in the undisturbed pur-
suit of their object ºf course the plaintiff did not ha pen, to notice
the condition under which the seats were reserved, noted in the receipt
for his 35s, and his lawyer, doubtless, overlooked it also. MR. Young,
doubtless, never expected, or was advised, that the letter of the law
would bear him out in ignoring so just a stipulation. Otherwise we
should most heartily congratulate him on having lost his cause, and had
to pay MR. Buckstone's costs as well, as his own, and the costs of
MR. Buckstone's four witnesses, besides having lost his £1,154, and
being deservedly laughed at for his failure in a mean and shabby
attempt to “ §§. ” MR. Buckston E.
THE WULPICIDE.
(A Hunting Song.)
THE month was March, and South the wind,
Light clouds o'erspread the sky.
The fox before, the hounds behind
Were chasing in full cry.
For many a mile o'er hills and dales
The hunters' course had been,
O'er hedge and ditch, and double rails,
With prickly fence between.
A sportsman gay from London town,
as roaming with his gun;
He brought the tuneful thrushes down,
And blackbirds floored like fun.
A fine hen-pheasant chanced to stray
From out a neighbouring wood;
With steady aim he blazed away,
And bagged her where she stood.
Ah! hark the music of the pack,
And huntsman's sounding horn
On º devious track,
Upon his ear are borne.
Tº come, o'eryonder corn-field green!
elists the wild halloo,
And now sees what those outcries mean:
The fox is in their view.
Exhausted by the lengthened chace,
; Reynard comes that way,
With panting sides and slackened pace,
Which sorefatigue betray.
Five minutes more, and then the hounds
Their prey will surely gain;
When º ! the Sportsman's piece resounds,
And lo! the fox is slain.
The hunters keen, not at the death,
Comein, but after that:
And each man shouts with all his breath,
And waves his cap or hat.
Forthwith the fox's brush they hew
From whence that tail had grown;
And fix the same our Sportsmanto,
So as to seem his own.

A SPIRIT RAPPING SEANCE I
Mr. Fozer (a Medium). “OH DEAR 1 THERE's A SPIRIT NAMED WALKER writing on My ARM I"
DEATH OF A NONOGENARIAN.
DIED, on Wednesday, March 19, at her residence in the Strand,
MRs. MoRNING CHRONICLE. Born in 1769, the deceased has had a
lºng and a varied career, Her father was the celebrated WILLIAM
WooDFALlº, who did all that a fond parent could do for a child, and
after her alliance with MR. JAMES PERRY, she became a motoriety for
her wit and spirit: , For many years she was connected with many of
the most distinguished politicians of the Liberal side, and her album
boasts the autographs of LoRD BROUGHAM, LORD CAMPBELL, MR.
THOMAS MooRE, and numerous other illustrious persons. Later in
life, her connections became of a somewhat different kind, and she was
understood to have imbibed some of the then fashionable religious
tenets of what was called Puseyism, but it is due to the shrewd sense of
the departed lady to add that these never led her into absurdities in
connection with secular matters, in which she was always true to her
ancient convictions. During this period of her history she lived ver
expensively, and took great pleasure in surrounding herself wit
younger, persons, of intellect, whose prospects, she forwarded very
materially. With the close of this epoch in her life ended the bright;
mess of her career, and it would have been well for her reputation had
her career itself then terminated. But she became connected with a
lawyer of no great eminence or talents, and her position in society was
materially deteriorated, after which the senile caprices of old age made
her addict herself to a favourite who º to be a foreigner, and
under whose dictation she did not tº: to avow shameless and un-
English sentiments. Abandoned by her French protégé, the unfortunate
old lady fell into the hands of the owner of a penny picture-paper, and
it is painful to linger over the later.scenes of her life. Her debility
became excessive, and she would delight to tell long and dreary stories
acquired from the journal º to her last connection. It was felt
that the end was coming, and this person's bankruptcy was the final
blow. On Wednesday the poor old lady spoke for the last time. We
are not aware that any persons are placed in mourning by her demise,
but what relics of fortune she may have possessed will probably fallſ to
M. ST Esq., formerly her neighbour, or to D. TeLLYGRAFF, Esq.,
of Fleet Street. It would be pleasant could we draw the curtain over
the last part of her life, as we should then have only to biographise her
as of hônourable parentage and marriage, and as having acquitted
herself with courage, honour, and intellect, in the difficult relations of
her life. But her misfortunes were not her faults, and many are living
who will preserve, a respectful recollection of the departed. Her
mortal remains will be interred in Basinghall Street after a post morten
examination.
PRAISE WHERE LEAST EXPECTED.
THE New York Herald has been kind enough to allude to us in terms
that we feel to be almost too complimentary. It talks of our “shabby
wit, low sarcasm, and serious caricatures.” We hardly know what we
have done to deserve so much kindness, for to be abused by the New
York Herald we consider as the very highest praise that any conscien:
tious journalist, who does not scruple i.; to speak the truth and
expose humbug, can possibly receive, in this ungrateful world. We
accept it as the ſitting reward of a long life *} º: After
having been abused by JAMES GoRDON BENNETT, Punch feels with
glowing pride that he hasn't lived in vain. We could wish for no greater
eulogium than the above abuse to be inscribed on our tombstone. But

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MARch 24, Monday. Mr. Punch has to remark that whether the
cause be the impending Exhibition, or the great news from America,
or the contemplation of MR. PEABODY’s munificence, or the appear-
ance of MR. GYE's programme, or the incubation of the Pythoness, or
some other disturbing influence, "...iº. of the country is, in a
state of mild collapse. He would really hardly consider it worth his
august while to issue any Essence at all this week, were it not for a
somewhat important fact which occurred on the Friday in connection
with the Education question...MR. WHITESIDE. rather neatly described
the stagnation of things political, when he said that chickweed was
upon the face of the Session. - - -
The CHANcellor has pushed his Lunacy Bill through Committee,
defeating his beloved friend LQRD Clielmsford, in an attempt to
knock out the two years and no-doctor clause, but declining to insert, a
provision suggested by, LoRD SHAFTESBury, who seems to dislike
physicians, and who wished to declare that no “opinion” of a medical
man should be taken as proof of insanity... . -
It seems that the promoters of the Edinburgh, Dunfermline and
Perth Railway Bill, have decidedly defied the Ständing Orders, but
hoped to be forgiven on the ...i of the extreme desirability of the
measure. They were strenuously withstood by the stern PATTEN, who
is also a Clog upon the hasty foot of the Legislature. Dunfermline is a
town in which a king sat
“Drinking the blood-red wine,”
and in which the present inhabitants have very hospitable habits, and
Mr. Punch regrets that there should be any impºdiment in the way of
a scheme for connecting them more closely with Edinburgh, whence they
procure the blood red and other wines which they dispense so freely.
Still, their attempt to seize the Queen's Ferry, instead of buying it,
savours more of the days of the king above-mentioned than those of
QUEEN VICTORIA, and Mr. Punch must recommend to the Dunfermliners
a course of practice less chivalrous, but more in accordance with effemi-
nate motions of justice. The BRUCE, that is to say MR. CUMMING
BRUCE, led them on upon this occasion, but not to a Bannockburn (save
that their own bannocks were burned) but rather to a Flodden. But
never mind– -
“If it was na weel bobbit, weel bobbit, weel bobbit,
If it was na weel bobbit, we'll bob it again.”
The ATToRNEy-GENERAL stated that the reason why the Bankruptcy
Bill had not worked last year so well as it should have done was, that
three out of the five London Commissioners attended very irregularly,
and because more Registrars were wanted. , New Registrars can easily
be had; and, unless the other parties mend their manners, Mr. Punch
would also recommend new Commissioners.
• A little Irish row is a thing to be grateful for in these days, and the
House was quite pleased when a debate arose on a modest proposition
that Irish workhouse chaplains, of the Catholic religion, should not be
appointed or dismissed until the Government should have ascertained
the will and pleasure of the Roman Catholic bishops on the point. A
od bit of #. audacious impudence does one good, and the
ouse warmed up, and let MR. MAGUIRE talk nonsense about a
“badge of slavery;” and a Catholic who did not desire the change
being a “slave at heart,” and similar trash. Qf course, SIR Robert
PEEL “respectfully” declined making any such concession, and those
who asked it did not carry their assurance into the lobby.
On the Mutiny Bill big M.R. WHITE moved the omission of the
clause which authorises ſlogging in the Army. SIR. G. C. LEWIS
stated that this punishment was becoming rarer and rarer, in conse-
quence of what we may call the filtering arrangement by which soldiers
are divided into classes, and º to maintain jº. But
he declined to take away the power of inflicting the lash; and, on divi-
sion, there were 67 for the Government, and 14 for MR. Wire.
Tuesday. A Bill for enabling the Trustees of that queer-looking place
in Lincoln's Inn Fields, called SIR John SoANE's Museum, to lend to
the International some of the articles hoarded in that den by the
crabbed old architect, was forwarded in the Lords. And LoRD CAR-
NARVoN made a speech in favour of Poland, to which LoRD RUssBLL
replied at great length, but to the effect that we could do nothing, but
that much might be hoped from the benevolence of the EMPEROR. If
all that we hear be true, there is room for an unlimited expansion of
such benevolence, for certain continental journals state that a gentleman
named ZAMoyski has just been literally cut to pieces with rods, at
Warsaw, for having published a liberation journal called the Pilot.
The House of Commons kept the appointment made by MR.
WALPole for an Education debate. #. brought forward certain
resolutions in opposition to the arrangements, proposed by the
Revised Code. Mr. Punch is not going into an analysis of the debate,
for MR. Lowe’s statesmanship shall be tested, as he proposes to test the
schools, by Results. The result of the debate, or of the conviction ob:
tained by Government as to the power of the so-called “religious”
party, was that on Friday night, MR. Lowe, though menaced with no
hostile division, announced the submission of Ministers upon certain
important particulars. He proposes to give a part of the §.
grant to a school on a report of the Inspector, and a part on an examina-
tion—he will not insist on grouping by age—and he will take care of
the interests of the pupil-teachers. Victory is claimed by the opponents
of the scheme, but possibly MR. Lowe acted as tradesmen do in the
case of ladies who are known to be addicted to “bargaining”—the
seller adds ten per cent, to the º he means to receive, and takes that
off in compliance with the haggling protests of the fair economist. But
the whole operation does not speak well for the confidence of Govern-
ment, in its own strength, or in the wisdom of MR. Lowe, and it was
felt that a case of dignus rindice had occurred, so it was arranged that
LORD PAIMERSTON, unfortunately troubled with the gout, should come
down on the following Monday, and say something pleasant. Of course
MR, WALPOLE was all smiles, and Mr. Disnxiºs the Quintessence
of Parliament, solemnly complimentary, in his very best manner.
The debate, which occupied º and Thursday night, was ex-
tremely dull, and was almost entirely left to the Bores. Perhaps the
Wesleyan bishops, who ordered their flocks to put the screw on, were
right, and few Mºmbers had opinions of their own upon the Education
question. Mr., Punch, merely places on record his protest against cer-
tain Cant which has been talked during the discussion, and utterly
refuses to assent to the proposition that it is not a Religious Education
that makes a boy clean, orderly, prompt, and intelligent, or that it is a
Religious Education that teaches him to call over the names of the
children of Pahath-moab, the children of Kirjatharim, the children of
Azmaveth, the children of Adonikam, and the children of Bethjeshi.
moth. No way insensible to the value of certain arguments § the
º of secular education, Mr. Punch nevertheless maintains that
the three R.'s help the fourth R. much better than MR. Roebuck's
friend JElios HAPHAT can, do. But the agitation has done incalculable
good, and the schools will be electrified into wholesomer life than they
have ever cnjoyed.

Thursday. Except as aforesaid, and an intimation by MR. LAYARD

interest of the Italian Brigands had better be asked in the free Par-
liament of Turin, there was nothing worthy of crystallisation.
Friday. Another blank, save that MR. Low E “came down,” as
hath been mentioned. MR. HENLEY remarked that it would be
“almost a sin” to make the Education question one of party. We

afraid to come. . With which remark Mr. Punch concludes the abstract
and brief chronicle of the Parliamentary Week, his work resembling
that of the respected ancestors of M.M. RothschiILD, M.P., SALOMONs
M.P., and GoLDSMID, M.P., when one of the Amenophizzes require
them to make bricks without straw.
MORMONITE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT.
THE American news in the Times one day last week contained the
announcement that—
“On the 3rd BRIGHAM YouNg was elected President of Utah, and HEBE C.
KIMBALL, Lieutenant-Governor.”
Until we read this item of intelligence we were unaware that, to the
extent which it indicates, Mormonism acknowledged the political rights
of women, HEBE C. KIMBALL, we presume, is a lady about to become
one of the already numerous Mesdames Enignº Young. When
HERE CHARLOTTE KIMBALL exchanges the name of KIMBALL for that
of YoUNG, it may be that YouNG will adore his new spouse, but the
American HEBE, inasmuch as YoUNG is rather old, will not therefore
become the Goddess of Youth. The Mormonites showed some com-
laisance in electing, BRIGHAM's new consort, to be his Lieutenant-
vernor, or, to speak perhaps more correctly, Governess. This is the
first authentically recorded appointment of a female to any kind of
Lieutenancy, for iii. reliance can be placed on the statement, in the
opular ballad which narrates the promotion of the sailor girl to be
st Lieutenant of the gallant Thunderbomb. -
It is not without some misgiving that we publish the foregoin
account of Miss KIMBALL's election to the Lieutenant-Governorship o
Utah. The prospect of obtaining such a situation as hers may allure to
the borders of the Great Salt Lake too many young ladies who cannot
get married, and have no more agreeable lot before them at home than
that of an English Governess.

MERRY AND DREARY ENGLAND.
“MR. PUNCH,
“THE lamentable statement subjoined has perhaps met your
eye, and extracted a tear from it, as it did from mine. Inasmuch as it
appeared in more than one morning paper, no doubt it has spoiled the
breakfast of many a lover of nature:–
“Exclosures.—The Enclosure Commission report that the following proposed
enclosures are expedient, and that a Bill will be prepared for sanctioning them :-
2,500 acres in the township of Kirkoswald, Cumberland; 82 acres in the parish of
Great Amwell, Herts; Llanfechell Mountain, Anglesey, containing 282 acres; waste
land of the manor of Huntingfield, Suffolk, about 59 acres; about 600 acres in the
sh of Chigwell, formerly part of Hainault Forest; 170 acres at Wouldham, Kent;
ingwall Common, Cheshire, 25 acres; , Plenmeller Common, Northumberland,
3,128 acres; Barking Common allotments, 529 acres; and D am Common
allotments, Essex, 48 acres. These ten enclosures amount together to 7,418 acres.
The commissioners state that since the passing of the Acts (in 1845) enclosures of
389,188 acres have been confirmed.”
“All this enclosure of waste lands, so called, that is to say, the
conversion of so much wild country into cultivated soil and building-
ground is very melancholy. There will soon not be an acre of heather
and gorse, of forest, swamp, or snipe-bog, in all England. ...One half of
the face of the earth will be crowded with human dwellings, coated
mostly with stucco and compo, intermixed with smoky, factories, and
still worse nuisances, and the other half covered with agricultural
produce; corn, kohl-rabi and mangold wurzel, or overspread with the
#. or its native equivalent, whence that produce will be raised to
atten cattle and feed human beings little above the cattle. For what,
much better than animals, are the human, beings likely to be, amply
provided with bodily meat and drink, but destitute of needful spiritual
refreshment? How are you to have any poet, when the wild prim-
roses, cowslips, violets, cuckoo-flowers, marsh-marigolds dog-roses
- mosses, oak, elm, beech,
woodbine, brambles, ferns, lichens, ash, an
other timber, woodland, cover, thicket, and º º swamp,
morass, and mountain wilderness, are all gone? “ We don't want
poets,” says your shrewd man of business, and so does your man of the
world, who tºº. with poor purblind old JQHNson, that a grove of
chimneys is better than a grove of trees, who likes the hum, and indeed
the humbug, of men better than the hum of bees, has no reverence for
the sylvan gods, but worships his own stomach daily at his club.
These fellows may not want poets to help them get money, or cook for
them and otherwise pamper their bodily appetites; but, not wanting
poets, they are incipient brutes, and their posterity, without any poets
whatever to keep humanity up in them, will ultimately descend nearl
to a level with the beasts—not of the field but of the stye. They will
become, as it were, pigs; creatures that, when turned out in a forest,
see nothing in it but the acorns and mast which they hunt among the
fallen leaves, and the roots which they turn up with their snouts out of
the earth. Their very features will most probably by degrees acquire
a hoggish type, so that their eyes at last will come to be set obliquely
in their heads, the British cast of countenance resembling the Chinese:
all along of the want of º and the extirpation of poetry from the
British soul, occasioned by the total enclosure of waste lands.
“Don’t tell me that the more numerous population the soil can be
made to support, the better. Quantity may be obtained at the expense
of quality. I am a lover of my species, but had rather not be confined
with a large number of them in a small place. A crowd makes the
atmosphere sultry. That of England is getting so, and if I had to live
much longer, it would soon get too hot to hold me. Already it is
growing difficult to find fresh, air, and the trout-streams are fast, be-
coming open sewers. The wild animals are nearly all extinct; there
are no vermin but rats, mice, and pettifoggers. Oh, yes! I am behind
my age, I know-averse to progress. To be sure. I am, Mr. Punch,
averse to progress which is simply degeneration; but I also am your
regular subscriber,

officers in the Federal army, of their own º: written in a style
which closely resembles that wherein clever thieves are accustomed to
relate their adventures. One of these vile expressions is the spurious
noun-substantive “Secesh,” or “Secesher,” meaning a person who has
seceded from the American Union, and who, in correct and established
English, would be called a Seceder. The other is the genuine adverb
“quite,” i. used as an adjective; as “quite a number,”
meaning a large number. It is hoped that this notice will render all
loyal Englishmen careful to eschew these two abominable Americanisms.

AMong the protectionists in the French Legis-
lative body, one of the leading orators is a M.
Pouyer-QUERTIER. Here is a remarkable
passage extracted from a speech which this
gentleman made the other day:-
“Had the advantages accorded to England by the
treaty made her a more faithful and reliable all The
answer to that question might be found in what was
now passing in the British Parliament, which was voting
enormous armaments. Could they consider themselves
at peace, when the coasts of France were surrounded by
lish gunboats and plated frigates? Were those the
fruits of the alliance? Let the s of Free Trade
answer the question. The fruits of the treaty were not
only commercial disasters but increased financial bur-
dens. There could be no hope of economy while England
kept on increasing her armaments. On the contrary,
their burdens must be increased."
With change of names, merely, the words
above quoted might have been uttered by an
º: of the French treaty in our House
of Commons. , Indeed, one seems to have read
them over and over again in the Parliamentary
debates, º º º: º: º;

M. PourER-QUERTIER, surely is either a pla-
giarist, or a wag. he idea of the French
coasts surrounded by English gun-boats, and
plated frigates, and of France, laden, with in-
creased financial burdens in order to keep pace
with English armaments, is certainly droll. It
did not apparently occur to M. Pouyºkºuen-
TIER to º if it did to consider, who first began

THE END OF NAVAL WAR.
(To the Peace Society.)
GENTLEMEN, .
THE action Merrimac v. Monitor, tried between the Confede-
rates, and Federals, conclusively proves that one iron-clad ship is a
match for several wooden ships carrying more and heavier #!"; and
that two iron-clad ships may pound one another about for hours
without material result.
Iron transports big enough and numerous enough to land an invading
force of any magnitude on these shores would be inconveniently expen-
sive necessaries for the acquisition of glory or plunder by the conquest
of England. Wooden transports are pervious to missiles discharged
from Armstrong guns, and the effect that would be produced by one of
those missiles, particularly a three hundred pound bomb, in a transport
full of enemies coming to rob and murder us, is something delightful to
contemplate. We may rejoice in ...; the havoc which one
Warrior would create amongst a whole fleet of timber vessels crowded
with invaders.
., Still more pleasant is the prºspect of the progress which is now
likely to take place in Naval warfare. If there are no ships of war but
ironships, and iron ships are mutually shot proof, how are they to fight?
Hostilities might perhaps still be carried on by means of , shells
charged with †† silver, regardless of expense. Such shells, #
big enough, would no doubt knock a hole in the iron sides of any
vessel; but as fulminating silver goes off with much less friction than
what will kindle a lucifer match, there would be rather too much diffi-
º lil †: shell with it.
It remains to be seen, if the science of .#. destruction should
be thus arrested, what plan the human brotherhood will then invent
for smashing, burning, or sinking one, another's fleets. Some new dis:
covery in electricity, some artificial lightning for example, which will
Smite through ribs of steel, may possibly be found to answer their
benevolent purposes; but there really does seem some ground for
hoping that, ships being rendered practically, invulnerable, any two
vessels of war b *ś to hostile, nations, will, hereafter, meeting on
the high seas, each find herself unable to injure the other, and therefore
be obliged to part in peace, the result of their collision having been as
nearly as possible the º; to that of the conflict between the Kil-
kenny Cats. Congratulating you most sincerely on the prospect of this
happy result, I am, gentlemen,

“ MAY AND DECEMBER.”
Sir C. Cresswell.
SIR PUNCH PUNch seldoms interferes with the Court of his friend
SIR CREsswell. CREsswell, feeling that SIR. C. C. is perfectly com-
petent to manage that tribunal without SIR P. P.'s aid; and having
also a natural indisposition to advert to topics of an unedifying de-
scription. To the facts of a case which has just occurred before his
friend, SIR.P.P. intends to make no reference at all; but as the parties
move in the same exalted circles with himself, it would not be selon les
règles to ignore the matter altogether. Without proffering to the
ARQUIs of DECEMBER any undue condolence on the undesirable
result of his union with Miss MAY, now relegated to her own i.
in society, SIR PUNCH PUNCH affectionately asks the Marquis why on
earth, §§ he wanted to marry, he descended to earth, and wedded a
child of the people? SIR P. P. hopes that he is, not compelled to
interpret this into a distrust, of the worldly, wisdom of LoRD DE-
cEMBER's own Order. Could the Marquis have imagined that he
could not find in the Peerage, the name of some, lady, young,
lovely, and pleasing as plebeian Miss MAY, and equally ready to be-
come the MARCHIONEssor DECEMBERº Could he think that because
he was seventy-six, there was no aristocratic beauty of twenty, who
would have devoted her spring of life to making him happy. SIR P.
P. hopes—hopes that LoRD DECEMBER was actuated in this matter
by caprice only, and did not wed plebeian twenty from any idea
that patrician twenty would, remember his seventy-six, and forget
his coronet. ... We affectionately conjure him to show that such a sus-
picion is unfounded, and to let it be known that he desires to marry
again. Let him give his Order a turn this time, and SIR PUNCH
Punch can assure him that he may at once order the orange blossoms,
and that at least a dozen Dowagers are ready to, advise—were
advice needed—their lovely young charges to regollect that a Marchio:
ness's coronet is not a thing to be lightly rejected, even if it be proffered
by a shaky hand. Come, my Lord, let us soon read that “A marriage
is on the tapis between the º: MARQUIs of DECEMBER and
the young and lovely daughter of the HoNour ABLE MRs. ExCELSIOR
CLAMBER.” Do justice to the Dowagers.

they please, take for the “Devil's Tattoo.”

THE DOOR OF FREEMASONRY BATTERED IN BY A
LADY'S FAN.
THE Italian Freemasons have acted with a gallantry that should put
all our Brºthers in England to the blush. They have determined upon
admitting ladies into their different lodges. There are now to be sister
matrons, venerables, great mistresses, &c., &c. This is but right and
fair. . It is a well-known rule in all houses, as well as lodges, where
love is supposed to prevail, that Brothers never conduct themselves so
well as when they have their Sisters with them. Besides, is it not the
natural and graceful sphere of woman to wear an apron? What
beautiful patterns the darling dears will make to be sure! Freemasonry
will indeed be an Order now that ladies will be present, always to
maintain it. It will be their special duty to º to the music, and
to make the coffee, and to see that the gentlemen do not drink too
much, for we have heard strange stories, founded on strong female
authority, about Masons, who had undoubtedly taken several degrees of
we will not say what, experiencing the greatest difficulty, on .#
home rather late, in fitting the keyhole with the latchkey. They coul
open a lodge in less time than they could do their own door.
The gentlemen, too, will have to look to their ornaments, handsome
as the latter unquestionably are, and to rub them up with greater pride
than ever, for if there is one article that women care ºf understand
about more than any other it decidedly is jewellery. What "...i
firmaments of glittering stars the lovely creatures will turnout on gran
installation occasions. Not a Masonic spade then but what will turn
up diamonds! Each lady's º will be a walking jeweller's tray. In
fact, it will become doubtlessº requisite to'''" some limit to this ex-
travagance, for what Man and a Brother could possibly refuse, to part
with his hammer, or his compasses, or his cross, or his trowel, let them
be ever, so valuable, when the request was prettily prefaced with the
musical inquiry, from the lips probably of a Grand Arch-Mistress of her
art, of “Am I not a Woman and a Sister?” ...We beg to congratulate
the Italian Freemasons upon beautifying their Lodges by having wisely
added to them these beautiful chaste wings (angels' wings, as worship-
pers, we will call them). Their classic walls will shine all the more
ſº for being surmounted by this animated series of “Lodge's
Portraits,” framed in the rarest Italian beauty.
For more reasons than one are we greatly delighted to hear of the
lovely Signoras having beaten down these i.i. barriers of
–
selfish seclusion. First of all, because the example may be imitated in
England. The time has gone by when gentlemen should continue to
meet in secret, like a lot of tippling monks, or sour-minded conspirators.
Another reason is, that now probably we shall very shortly learn the
awful secret that has been so jealously guarded for hundreds of cen.
turies. At all, events, the admission of our sisters into the mystic
ceremonies of Freemasonry will put boldly to the proof the old-disputed
§: as to whether Woman can really keep a secret? Even if this
oul º 1S º from the fair sex, it will be a great point
ained by this new Masonic, move, and it will be an additional ostrich.
eather of triumph in the ladies' caps. Let us hope, they, will, answer
this challenge in the right sense—that is to say, by not making an
answer to it at all.
“HAIL STAR OF NEW BRUNSWICK!”
It is said that the Colonies are capable of self-defence. We should
like to know what defence one of the Colonies, namely, New Bruns-
wick, will make to the following charge in the Times:–
“Among the articles sent to the International from this Colony is the bed on
which the PRINCE or WALEs slept during his visit."
This charge may be met in two ways. One is to deny point.blank
that the manly colonists of New Brunswick can be . ty of such
miserable flunkeyism. The other is to urge that the colony is anxious
to show that, though a long way from England, it knew what were the
requirements of civilisation, and of a 5. bedroom. In that
case, however, the New Brunswick Exhibition will be incomplete, as
evidence of advance, unless a further consignment be made, and the
.* MR. Sydney WHITING be furnished with the following
additional list of articles from New Brunswick:—
2. Flat candle and extinguisher, from the Prince's bed-room.
3. Ends of wax-candles from the Prince's mantelpiece.
4. The Prince's sponge bath.
5. The Prince's flesh brush.
6. The Prince's royal towels, smooth, rough, and Turkish.
7. The Prince's wash-stand.
8. Bottle of iced-water, filtered, same as tasted by the Prince.
9. Pictures from the Prince's bed-room.
10. The Prince's looking-glass. Ladies to be charged Sixpence for use of it.
11. Large tin in which hot-water was brought for the Prince's footbath.
12. Small ditto with ditto for Prince's shaving.
13. Shaving paper, partially used by the Prince.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 5, 1862.
_-
INTEREST.
MID his many ver
duties, while Parlia-
ment is sitting, it is
but seldom Mr. Punch
can spare a half-hour
for indulgence in such
light and pleasant
reading as the articles
contributed to scien-
tific magazines. The
other day, however,
Mr. Punch did just
find time to skim a
pageor two describing
a novel apparatus, the
use whereof is briefly
summed up in these
words:—
“The Absorbometer is
intended to determine
the volumes of liquid
absorbed during succes-
sive intervals of time
and to find the rate at
- which liquids are trans-
mitted through the pores
ºf of different absorbents.”
A MATTER OF ABSORBING
|M||
|||||
| in Having naturally
the cause of science
much at heart, and
taking a deep interest
in all scientific instru-
ments, Mr. Punch has
recently been ºf
someexperiments wit
the view of testing
practically the powers
of the Absorbometer,
and ascertaining how
faritislikely to prove
useful to the scientific world. Among many º interesting facts he has elicited, Mr.
Punch may mention, that he gave the other º a little dinner down at Greenwich, and the
amount y liquid which was found to be absorbed was discovered to be nearly three bottles-
ful per man. The rate at which the liquids were absorbed in this.experiment was found to
vary very much with the various absorbents, as well as with the liquids that were variously
tried. #o: instance, port-wine was absorbed much more slowly, than champagne; and to
show at what pace liquids are “transmitted through, the pores,” it may briefly here be
stated that, while one of the absorbents took his claret in small sips, another of them
actually transmitted down his throat a dozen glassesſul in twelve pours. . . -
While treating of absorption, Mr. Punch would fain suggest to his scientific friends that
they would do the social state considerable service, were they to succeed in perfecting an
instrument, by which absorbents might beforehand determine, their capacity, on ºccasions
such as wedding breakfasts and the like, when their powers of absorption will be called into
full play. Far too frequently it happens, that for want of some such knowledge, absorbents
take more liquor than they well can carry, and their proper equilibrium thereby is disturbed.
At present it is only by experience that such knowledge is arrived at, and this experience is
usually expensive to obtain. Were absorbents, by some clever scientific apparatus, to be
made aware precisely how much liquid they could take without being upset by it, what a
number of bad headaches would the social world be saved, and how many a good bottle
would happily remain to be absorbed another day, when more appreciation might be given
to its merits, and its absorption could no longer be deemed a waste of wine.

RAILWAY RAILLERY.
How prone are people to defame! What a mistake it is to call our Railway Companies
ping and umgenerous! Here have some of our contemporaries been censuring the con-
duct of those who have the management of lines North of the Thames, so different to those of
the South, in resolving not to run excursion-trains in May, whereby people might be tempted
to come and pay an early visit to the World's Exhibition. This, say the writers, clearly shows
how the Railways strive to fleece the unprotected public, and how powerless are the latter to
prevent such base extortion. It is very fine to sing that “Britons never will be Slaves,” but
the truth is that we all of us are kept under the thumb of a monstrous Railway ºy,
which having the #". of popular conveyance now does just exactly what it chooses with
its slaves, the British people...Everybody knows that everybody out of it will have to come
to London to see the Exhibition, and unless they “come early,” as the showman used to
say, the chances are there hardly will, be room to hold them; and so these greedy ping
º: #. to keep up their full fares, because they know full well that the public must
submit em.
This is what has been alleged by a few unthinking people; but we need hardly contradict
a statement so preposterous. Of course, to any one who thinks at all about the matter, it
is quite obvious that the Railways have no such end in view. They, will so largely benefit
by the Exhibition, and by the increase of trade which it most probably will cause, that they
of course will do their utmost to make it a suc-
cess, and will carefully avoid whatever may seem
hurtful to it. Now as nothing can advan
it so much as cheap Excursion trains, so nought
can do it injury so surely as withholding them;
and the railway men would simply be cutting
their own throats were they, to refuse chea
journeys to the public. This the Railway Boar
are not so wooden as to do; and we therefore
view, their so-called “resolution” as a joke,
which, as it came out first in March, was pub-
lished rather prematurely, since by rights it
should have reached us on the First of April.
CLOSE, THE POET,
ANTIANTHROPOPHAGUs.
AND so you deemed that I was dead,
My haughty masters all;
Northought my fame should still be spread
O'er this terrestrial ball.
Indeed, my Proud, but no such luck,
I mean such luck for you:
Again the Poet's harp is struck,
And you shall hear it too.
I sing not now of base ARGYLL,
Or baser GEORGY GREY
Who kept my books with haud and guile,
And yet would never pay.
Dishonest rogues I hold they are,
Unworthy of my Muse,
To take a Poet's precious ware,
And payment to refuse.
But to a nobler theme I turn,
And meditate to sin
The lofty thoughts with which I burn,
Concerning of a KING,
The KING of Bonny is my Sire,
His Laureate I was made,
But now I feel Imust retire
From that respected trade.
For if the papers don't with jokes
Seek readers to enmesh,
He has been killing several folks,
And eating of their flesh.
This is not conduct for a Chief,
Iſho should behave as such,
When veal and mutton, pork and beef,
Are all within his clutch.
And though I was a butcher bold,
I never was the pa
Of one who fellow creatures sold;
In fact, a Cannibal.
So KING of Bonny, in your den,
'Tis fit that you should know it,
While you É. on a eating men
I cannot be your poet.
But if hereafter you repent
And put away that meal,
Why then I likewise will relent
And list to your appeal.
Meantime, although a cannibal,
I think you are not worse
Than those vile tyrants of Pall Mall
Who robbed the Poet's Purse.
A Quibble.
. MR, Cox, M.P., is to his honour as much de-
lighted as anybody else at the liberality of MR.
Peabody, but wants to know whether a gift for
the “amelioration” of the condition of the poor
means a meal or ration. The distinction savours
of attorney subtlety.

general act in concert, the latter generally ſº the credit of having
layed first fiddle, and his division of the band is generally reputed to
ave taken the lead of the other. Whether, fact in this respect is
always in strict accordance with ſame, may be doubted by some of our
countrymen, of course from Fº but prejudice excusable when
founded on a statement such as the following, made by the corre-
Hº! of the Morning Post at Paris, relative to GENERAL SIR HoPE
RANT, who has lately passed through that city on his way to India,
and GENERAL (now Count) MonTAUBAN, who co-operated with him in
the Chinese expedition —
“It ap that GENERAL SIR Hope GRANT proposed, with the forces under his
command, to attack the strong forts with his Armstrong guns, and then storm
them. The French general strongly objected, and even in the presence of the staff
wrote a protest nst GENERAL SIR. Hope GRANT's plans of operation. The º:
commander simply put the protest in his pocket, carried out his plans, and y
accomplished all he intended. GENERAL Montauban, after the success of the
attack, wished to have his protest returned, but SIR HoPE GRANT refused to do so.
The English General complained of no mention having been made in the official
despatches of the fact of the British Sikh cavalry having saved the French army
when surrounded by hordes of Chinese, which force, accompanied by a couple of
troops of English cavalry, cut through the mass of Chinese, and delivered their
French brothers in arms.”
If the above account, could be trusted, we should be obliged to
believe that it is not lº. our troops that are saved from being cut
to pieces by our gallant allies, but sometimes rice persä. We might
also be inclined to lend an ear to the whisper which has asserted that
Sebastopol would have fallen long before it did if LoRD RAGLAN's
counsels had prevailed.
GENERAL MonTAUBAN, doubtless, distinguished himself at the
Summer Palace; witness the glittering trophies which he bore away
from the sack of that stronghold, and which he gave away so gene-
rously that it might have been said that fortune, in throwing diamonds
in his way, made a mistake equivalent to that of casting º before
Swine. R. so. On the contrary, if the General, having been made a
WHEN, conducting º
Count, shall, after all, obtain his dotation, there will be good reason for
the observation that GENERAL Count MonTAUBAN has really driven
his pigs to a very pretty market.
FRENCH FOREIGN WINE.
SPEAKING in the French Legislative Chamber on the condition of the
manufacturers of France, M.BARoche, as reported in the Moniteur,
after stating that, in 1861, there was a very large quantity of foreign
wine imported into France, observed:—
“These foreign imports are demanded in France for a reason I would rather not
say, and I hope you will excuse my silence. (Adhesion.)"
Why this reticence on the part of M. BARoghiº; reticence of which
the prudence º to have been acknowledged by the “adhesion”
of his audience? Was its cause the modesty of the Imperial Minister?
Is it true that France, inspired with a generous idea, sends us all her
own wine, the best in the world, and contents herself with a cheaper, if
not an inferior beverage, imported from other wine-growing countries?
Certain Hungarian wines are advertised here in London at from 18s.

judges to be indistinguishable from choice Burgundy, Perhaps they
are good enough for our frugal neighbours. Perhaps they form a con-

into France. Of course they constitute no part of the wine exported
from France to England as French produce. If they did, they would
indeed be demanded in France for a reason which we can quite under.

naturally applaud him for drawing the veil over an operation which in

of the foreign imports of wine which are demanded in France. If we
are to have any of our Claret and Burgundy from Hungary, we may as

“We congratulate our readers
on another defeat of the Whig

The answer to the above question may be inferred from the congratulation which the

A HIT AT EXETER HALL.
THE Concerts given by the Sacred Harmonic Society are without
exception very praiseworthy performances, and Mr. Punch feels always
pleasure in lending them his ears. . To hear good music well performed
is as refining to the mind as it is pleasant to the sense; and two hours
... once a fortnight cannot well be better spent than in hearing the Elijah,
Israel, or Stabat Mater. , Were Mr. Punch inclined to criticise, which
he happily is not, he might Fº complain that the band at Exeter
Hall is apt to overwhelm the chorus, and that the organ would soun
better if it were less loudly voiced. ft appears to Mr. Punch that what
is written for “accompaniment” should not be brought into such promi-
nence as to give one the idea that the singers are intended to be kept
in the º: and the less that they are heard by the audience
the better. In a chorus the voice-parts should surely be most audible;
and the Exeter Hall Concerts would be certainly improved, were the
choristers more numerous, and the orchestra reduced. Despite defects,
however, there is, plenty of inducement for a father of a family to
improve his daughters' minds at this Harmonic Hall, where MEN-
DELssoHN and HAYDN may be listened to with profit, and where
HANDEL is so often turned to good account.
But the more tempting are, the Concerts which are held at Exeter
Hall, the more troublesome will it be found for families to get away
from them. If MR., PATER be a gentleman, and not so selfish as to
cause annoyance to his neighbours by stumping out while the music
is proceeding, the chances are that he will waste some five and twent
º minutes in squeezing through the narrow labyrinths by W.
e has to make his exit. First a push along a passage, then a crush
round a sharp corner with six elbows in his ribs, then a header down a
staircase, which seems about as steep as the outside of the Monument,
and where he feels he would fall headlong if he were not so wedged in,
then a blockade in a corridor where he can hardly breathe, and, to com:
#. his torture, a mauvais quart d'heure spent in standing near a
raughty doorway, and in tele º: to his footman, if he fº. one,
or to some Jack-in-waiting to ; a passing cab. Thanks to its clever
architect, a man who goes to Exeter Hall can scarce more easily get
out of it than could STERNE's starling from its cage. nd an
4larm” of fire on, any crowded night (and the Sacred Harmonic
Concerts are ſº." and it were terrible to calculate the
loss of life that might be caused by it. In such event, were Mr. Punch
upon the jury, his verdict would be, manslaughter against the men who
own the building, and who by spending a few pounds might soon make
proper vents to it. If it should º by some accident, that at one of
the May Meetings a Bishop should be crushed, doubtless steps would
then be taken to throw open extra staircases, and to facilitate the
public in their egress from the place.
As the Sacred Harmonic is of all Societies the one that most uses the
Hall, and best pays those who have the letting of it, a word from t
Society would surely have great weight with the holders of the building,
who are in reality the persons to be blamed. Mr. Punch would there-
d fore call upon this able-lunged Society to raise its voice against the
way in which its patrons are accommodated; and to avert that whole-
sale slaughter of the music-loving world which, a cry of Fire!, might
any night occasion at its Concerts, and which Mr. Punch himself feels
somewhat anxious to escape. Meanwhile, º;', he loves, good
music much, he loves his Judy more; and Mr. Punch will certainly not
risk her precious life more often than she really obliges him to do, by
taking her to Concerts which he can’t get her away from without the
chance of fractured Crinoline, if not of broken bones.
HOMAGE TO GENIUS,
THE London Review has a capital article on the “Periodical Press in
Italy,”, from which, with the generous view of rewarding talent, we
make the following extract:—
“We have frequent sallies of good genuine humour in some of the comic pa
especially the Fischietto and P ino, both of Turin, two papers which easily leave
the Chariwari, the Ktº. and other periodicals in the same style, far behind,
and often attain the excellence of Mr. Punch, in the happiest moments of that
veritable genius.”
There,†. might read the Saturday Review every day of your life, and
never find in its columns, and they are not always destitute of merit,
anything so wisely discriminating, so rºspectfully º: or so
fearlessly just as the above. “Veritable Genius !’ n our word, the
truth has had such an effect upon us, that nothing less than a dinner
at “The Clarendon” will satisfy us. To-day we will have the best of
flºº. Would that we could secure the society of the Editor of
the London iew, so that we might, also, enjoy the best of good
company. “Weritable Genius” as we are, we will guarantee he is in
every intellectual and prandial respect worthy to join us in a good
tête-à-téte dinner.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MARCH,31st. Monday, MR. SMITH that was, LORD Lyveden that is,
Mr. Punch dislikes small suspicions and unworthy suggestions. If a
person deserves to be trusted, trust him; if he does not, cut the con-
nection. It seems that y reason of an informality the legislative acts
of South Australia are of doubtful validity, and the DUKE of NEw-
çASTLE introduces a Bill to remove the doubt. SMITH that was,
IXVEDEN that is, hinted that the error might be a studied design on
the part of the colonists to frustrate the . of the Home Legis-
lature. The Duke at once smashed him by stating that the error was
qne made not by the colonists but by the Governor, and that it was
detected and pointed out by a colonial lawyer. We imagine that SMITH
that was, LYWEDEN that is, must be sorry he spoke.
LORD PAIMERSTON refused to give any papers about the persecution
of Protestants in Spain, because there were no such papers. Our repre-
sentative at Madrid was simply charged to lose no opportunity of
hinting in a civil manner that the Spaniards ought to be ashamed of
themselves. We have no idea what may be PAM's estimate of the
number of social epigrams likely to be required before the unfortunate
Protestants can be reparteed out of prison, but if he really thinks that
such weapons will do, he is at liberty to put the Ambassador into com-
munication with one of our young men, who will turn on wit until the
º fly open. But more men have been joked into gaol than
Out OI it.
Then came on an interesting and important discussion. SIR FREDE-
RICK SMITH called attention to the fight between the Merrimac and the
Monitor, American vessels, and demanded to know whether our Govern-
ment were learning a lesson upon the §. of invulnerable º:
SIR. G. C. LEWIs made a *{i, It is not often that Mr. Punch has the
pleasure of agreeing with BRIGHT upon Military and Naval
questions, but that, gentleman's observations upon the fight and the
speech of the War Minister were most proper. He said that the man
must be particularly stupid who did not see the importance of the inci-
dent in the war, and that the speech of SIR. G. C. Lewis was most un-
satisfactory. SIR GEORGE thought that on the strength of a few days'
experience the Government ought not to rush into costly experiments.
But less than a few days has sufficed to arrive at the certain knowledge
that (in smooth water) an iron clad ship can demolish a whole fleet of
wooden ships as easily as Mr. Punch demolishes any enemies that ma

Afterwards, on Estimates, MR. CowPER recorded the solemn promise
that though the Trafalgar Square Fountains are now eye-sores, they
shall, in May, be something ‘of which, every º will be

ommittee. What in earth, or in water, is CowPER going to do to the
squirts? We are afraid to guess, and must wait till May for leave to

House of Commons, a Prig. But we thought that the honourable
party had some brains, after all. , What will be said, when we relate
that this Bouverie actually asked the House to provide a compendious
record of Parliamentary proceedings—a sort of Handy. Boo
debates!!! The House was too much phlabberghasted tº meet the
proposition in the way it deserved, and indeed was actually, stunned
into allowing Bouverſe to have a select Committee on the subject–so
much for sudden audacity. The next morning PAM. sent, a special

either “him or that.” Bouverſe will next be moving that there ought

Trustees of SIR John Soane's Museum thought it necessary to express,
through MR. TITE, the eminent architect, their reluctance to assent to
the Bill enabling them to exhibit their Ho arths, which nevertheless
they wish to send to the International. We have almost forgotten
what else they have got in that queer house of theirs, but must over:
haul the place. If there is really anything worth having, they had
better send it in to the British Museum, as there will be room for it
now that the beasts are to walk.
Thursday. His Grace of SoMERSET made a more satisfactory speech
than that of SIR GEORGE Lewis upon the Iron Ship Question. He
stated that we had four iron war-vessels which would be ready in
August, that six more were being prepared, various improvements being
adopted in them, the Cupola included,—that Government were fully
aware of the importance of the subject, and that we need not be
alarmed, for that we had many vessels that could be converted into
iron-plate ships at very short notice. This statement, though by no
means all that could be desired, was far more to the purpose than the
speech of the War Secretary, and so the EARL OF MALMESBURY
º the Duke.
o an inquiry, what had become of the Monument to the DUKE OF
WELLINGTON, ow PER replied that, in 1858 a gentleman, was

educating himself for the purpose. People are unreasonable, do they
expect to hear anything ºf the Wellington Monument yet awhile? Why,
LöRD NELsoN was killed in 1805, and his Monument is not yet finished,
nor likely to be.

GLADSTONE, after talking pleasantly through three columns, came to
the statement that the probable revenue for next year would be
£70,190,000, inst an expenditure of £70,040,000, the Commons
began, as he said, to Buzz. As the Book of Nonsense has it:-

were urged with some spirit, MR. WHALLEY came out with some ultra-
Protestantism against the fresco of the baptism of the Saxon ºf
by S. AUGUSTINE, declaring that we were Protestants in England (an
if we heard the Hon. Member right, had the Common Prayerbook an
Church-rates) five hundred years before AUGUSTINE, SIR. M. W.
RIDLEY complained that the statues of Fox and GRATTAN “pointed no
moral and adorned no tale,” which was uncandid, because a tail adorns
the reverse, of each statue. ..., SIR. Joseph PAxton, very properly
demanded that the place in the Victoria Tower for the reception of
Records should be fireproof, and after a good deal more rather pleasant
chit-chat of the kind, even, Cox *†† to rise and say something-
but the House was instantly and successfully Counted Out at 2:15.
Friday. After one of LoRD Normanby's little Acts of Accusation
against the Government of the KING of ITALY had been rather loftily
disposed of by EARL RUSSELL, who seemed to-night in no temper to be
tolerant of nonsense, the same Earlstated in answer to LoRD KINNAIRD,
that there were two versions of the case of M. ZAMoyski, one to the
effect that he had been flogged to pieces, the other to a reverse purport.
As he did not know which to believe, he preferred to give credit to the
less painful story—which may be regarded as a prudential and conve-
nient course, and which has, moreover, the merit of being opposed to
the usual practice of society when anything disagreeable is narrated.
MR. LAYARD explained that England did not intend to interfere with
the internal affairs of Mexico, and that as our men had done all that
they were sent to do, they had been withdrawn, with a small exception.
He did not say whether the prospects of the Austrian Prince, who
wishes to be MAXIMILIAN of Mexico, were improving—the impression
seems to be rather the other way.
We suppose that, the reference to the Wellington Monument re-
minded ADMIRAL WALcott that there had been such a person as
NELSON, and prompted a question to MR. CowPER. The latter res-
ponded that SIR. Edwis LANDSEER undertook the Lions in 1858, and
was still attending, very regularly, at the Zoological Gardens, to see
what lions are like.
MR. DENMAN made an able, speech in favour of Poland, and LQRD
PALMERSTON replied that Poland had much to complain of, but had
better Wait.
Government have been fairly waked up at last, upon the subject of
the ships, and a rumour that got about, we have no idea how, that Mr.
Punch intended to make a demonstration upon the subject in the sha
of a marvellous cartoon representing ... ". Iron, finally decided the
Premier's course. SIR GEORGE Lewis was invited to hold his tongue,
and BERNAL QSBORNE was invited to come out strong upon the ques.
tion. Then, PAM, choosing the right moment, as he always does, rose
and declared that Government were intensely alive to the importance
of the subject, that CAPTAIN CowPER Coles's Cupola was a capital
contrivance, that the Forts should be suspended, and the Floating
Defences should be taken in hand. This was as much as could be
expected, but MR. BENTINck wanted a little more, and was told by 74
to 13 that when you have killed your hare with one barrel, there is no
need to fire the other barrel into her. So, on the whole, Mr. Punch
thinks himself #. in closing the chronicle of the present week
with the remark, Hooray!
CRINOLINE ASHORE AND AFLOAT.
WE’ve mail-clad vessels; iron grates
Our ladies' robes conceal;
Our ships' sides fenced with armour-plates;
Our girls' with ribs of steel.
Steel ribs will safe from capture make
HER MAJESTY's marine,
And whom do you expect to take
A wife in Crinoline?
A Profitable Transaction.
Accorping to MR. HUBBARD, out of the sum total constituting the
new Turkish loan, which has been so erly subscribed to in this
country, only 60 §: cent, after deductions for interest and commission,
will “be applicable in Turkey.”. For £8,000,000, therefore, it follows
that the Turkish Government will only get some $4,800,00). Our big
bill discounters, amongst them, thus sack 40 per cent. Will it not be
truly said that the Mahometans have fallen into the hands of the Jews?
On the Stock Exchange, however, it may be remarked, that we have
rather turned Turks, because we have received a profit from the
Mussulmans.

ºS |lººse it has been his wish to see
pictorially treated:—
The Quaker's Dream., Grand historical cartoon, representing the election of JoHN BRIGHT
as the perpetual president of Great Britain, consequent on the annihilation of the Throne
and House of Lords. (Note. The artist will be pleased to represent J. B. in a fine heroic
attitude, with a smile upon his face, and pointing to the Crown with a gesture of contempt,
after the manner of O. CROMwell saying, “Take away that bauble !”)
Battle of Bunker’s Hill. Total defeat and utter rout of the entire British Army by a
handful of Americans led by GENERALWASHINGTON. Cowardly flight of SIR JOHN BURGOYNE,
leaving all his guns and wounded on the field. -
Sea-piece showing the famed action of the Shannon and the Chesapeake: wherein the former,
a gigantic British frigate of sixty-seven guns was captured by the latter, a little. Yankee

guised, when encountered by as many small American corvettes.
Dastardly retreat of General Wolfe after his attempted storming of Quebec. (Wide GENERAL

The Glorious Signing of the famous Declaration ºf Independence (from a sketch by an eye:
witness, who was present, as reporter for the New York Penny Tomahawk). Grand historical
picture of England's humiliation and America's emancipation from the British tyrant's thrall.
. French Landscape; with a view of the Column at Boulogne, erected, to commemorate the
invasion of England by the French (helped by the Yankees) in 1805. (Note by MR. BRIGHT.
English writers have declared that the invasion, though intended, never actually took place.
That is no business of the artist. There stands the Column, whatever be the fact.)
Picture showing the Printing of the {. Penny Newspaper; invented by America to civilise
the Universe; with a view in the background of some few of the many million comforts and
advantages which society has gained from this inestimable blessing.
-The Breaking of the Duke of Wellington's Windows, by a few of the free citizens who were
sent, over by the States to assist the British people in their #.º. for Reform. (Note
MR. BRIGHT. The artist will have the goodness to depict the Iron Duke half-fainting with
sheer fright, and the patriots throwing stones at him are to be dressed in evening costume,
with camellias in their button-holes and opera-glasses in left-hand.)

APRIL FOOLS.
Trºiles and ways of ancient days
Shift with time's ceaseless flow;
Old almanacs are no more true
Than history, we know.
But two Spring fashions hold their ground,
Though change all else may rule-
Still March doth snare her frantic hare,
And April boasts her fool.
The spring-life’s stirred in beast and bird,
Buds burst their barky screens,
Nor only trees, but nations boast,
The freshness of their greens.
From either Pole, to where her waves
Our own BRITANNIA rules,
I look around and see the ground
Alive with April fools.
France gapes to see her EMPEROR
With Freedom's cornice crown
His new Bastile which has replaced
The old one she pulled down, .
Figs upon thistles ſº. on thorns,
eeks, at his bid ing cool—
Upon such sleeveless errand sent,
hat's France but April fool?
Italy, still the battledore
Guelph and Ghib'line hands,
Betwixt an Emperor and Pope
Perplexed and panting stands.
Of her that trusts to BRENNUs's sword,
Orleans on PETER’s stool,
'Tis hard to say which Italy
Is greater April fool.
Grave Germany, 'twixt pot and pipe,
Book-led and KANT-o'errun,
Pores o'er the problem, still unripe,
How to make many one.
Professor while in Prince she’d find,
Or sovereigns in her schools,
There’s Germany, bemused and blind,
Greatest of April fools.
Turkey, where diplomatic snips
With new cloth patch the old,
Beneath the Great Powers’ smiles and frowns
Alternate hot and cold,—
While Franks and Moslemin she trusts
With even hand to rule,
And hopes by loans to shake off debt—
Is sure an April fool.
And thou with Bunkum swoll’n and fired,
, JonATHAN, my son!
Spending thy million a day,
Half frenzied, half in fun:
Union who seek'st in civil war,
Freedom in Slavery's school
What, oh my JoWATHAN, art thou,
If not an April fool?
And lastly, Mother England, thou
That sav'st wax-ends and chips,
While spending thirty millions clear
In soldiers and in ships;
If hoping to see Income Tax
(Neatest of taxing-tools') . .
Hung idly up on º walls,
Thou’rt worst of April fools :

A SEA-SONG OF THE FUTURE.
Go, patter to soldiers and swabs not at sea
*Bout danger and fear and the like, . .
A full head of steam and good iron ship five me,
And 'taint to three-deckers I’ll strike! -
Though such shot on our iron sides smack, smash, and smite,
As would shiver a frigate of wood, .
What of that ? sheathed in plate we’ll right gallantly fight,
Till our foes for the fishes befood.
In armour cased for’ard, amidships, abaft,
In our sides neither crevice nor crack, .
All safely we steam in our blacksmith-built craft:
Naught to fear now has Iron-clad JACK.
I said to my Poll, for you see she would cry
When last we were ordered to sea, - -
What’s the good, PQLL, of sniv'ling, and piping your eye,
When your JACK is as snug as can be?
Can't you see how we’re armed; iron plates over all;
Shot-and-shell-proof from sternpost to stem?
Not a man of us now by a broadside can fall:
And for small arms, we’ve no fear of them.
With sheathing well shielded both for’ard and aft,
On the furnace fresh fuel we stack,
Then running stem on sink the enemy's craft,
While in safety sits Iron-clad JACK.
Wº: I heard our ship's blacksmith ºf one might
That the strength of our sheathing was suc
That, shiver my rivets says he, when we fight,
Not a shot can our timbers ere touch.
Should a foe heave in sight, to our guns we may fly,
Nor of splinter nor shot feel a dread: -
Pound away as he will, boys, we’ll never say, die!
For we’re proof º: steel, iron and lead.
We’ve no woodwork to riddle, alow or aloft,
No canvas to shift or to tack;
Not an inch in the ship that is º; or soft,
Shot and shell proof is Iron-clad JAck!
OPENING OF THE INTERNATIONAL, EXHIBITION.
By a notice in the Gazette, we learn that the Five Commissioners
charged with the Inauguration of the Building designed as a Temple of
Industry, Science and Art, are as follows:—
MR. FAIRBAIRN.
MR. FARADAY.
MR. RICHARD Owen.
MR. ALFRED TENNYSON.
MR. DANIEL MACLISE.
The report that the Ceremonial was to be under the superintendence
of a Soldier, an Arch-bishop, and some Lords, is contradicted, and the
above list appears in ample vindication of the good sense of the Directors.
FISCAL FUTURITY.
THE Serpent used to be the emblem of Eternity. Now, however,
the Serpent is superseded in that capacity by the Income Tax, of which
there is to be no end. The symbol is one which may be said to cor-
respond to Eternity of the wrong sort.

A NICER SORT OF BREAD.

man baker. t

make him bread.

“Putting all these things together, -
bakers' grievances are coming to an end by a better means than an Act of Parlia-
ment; ºthere will not be a speedy end, if an end at all, to home-made bread, but
the kneading will not long be done by the cook's stout arm."
This is yery welcome intelligence. Eating bread of which the making
kills the journeyman baker, is, in a manner, eating the journeyman
baker himself. #. thought is calculated to create a disrelish for dry
bread, if not to induce us to quarrel with our bread-and-butter, Bread
prepared by means of machinery will be eaten without a shudder; and
the rather by reason of the consideration that, if in the case of home-
made bread {. is no longer done by the cook's stout arm, neither,
in that of bakers’ bread can it any more be |. by a different

men Oakers.
WHY DON'T YOU REPEAL YOUR PAPER DUTYP
It is said that the Stationery Office has effected a saving of £22,000
this year, owing, it is supposed, to the repeal of the Paper, Duty. We
are glad that the Government are the gainers themselves by their own
liberality. It is only right and fair that they should share the benefit
in common with us and others. However, our pººr bankrupt, friend,
Austria, if she were wise, (we grant that the “if” is a mighty big
stumbling-block), would borrow a valuable hint from the above preg-
nant and suggestive fact. gº always repays itself. It is sure
to come back to us, in some way or other, in the long run. Why, then,
doesn't Austria repeal her Paper Duty”. In that pauper empire, eaten
up with priests, º and Fº the Paper Duty consists in
printing as many bank-notes as she can possibly get to circulate. Let
this system boldly, be repealed, (and it is §§ which any one,
let him be ever so clever in cooking accounts, will not hesitate to confess
has, long 'ere this, been completely “done to rags”), and who knows
that the Austrian finances may also clear £22,000 next year; and a
gain like that would be a colossal fact such as has uever been accom-
plished in those impoverished States yet, within the memory of the
oldest Boeotian inhabitant
A Sea Change.
The necessary reconstruction of the British Navy will effect an
entire change of nautical phraseology. “Shiver my timbers!” will
me obsolete; and the corresponding exclamation will be, “Unrivet
my plates.” Instead of “Scuttle my coppers!” the dramatic Jack
Tar will have to say “Foul my screw I’’ or “Smash my ºft. and
whereas he used to utter imprecations on his bowsprit, he will hence.
forth perhaps invoke injury on his bowsplitter.
“THE voices oF THE DEEP.”
DR. DUFossé proves to us that fishes have voices, Lending our ears
to this fact, we wonder what language are the fishes in the habit of
speaking? We suppose it must be the language of the Finns.
TALK ABOUT THE TELEGRAPH.
PROPER people find it difficult to amuse themselves in Lent; and
this is possibly the reason why we saw announced the other morning in
the Standard that:—
“MR. AND MRs. BLANK have issued invitations for a conversazione on the
subject of uniting America and England by the electric telegraph between Ireland
and Newfoundland."
... The transatlantic telegraph, and the thousands that were sunk with
it, afford a fitting topic to be talked about in fent, which is for
Christian minds the aptest time for penitential preaching. But though
long faces were no doubt pulled at the soirée above mentioned, still
persons who were interested in º: matters might have found
grounds for consolation in the following announcement, which had
appeared a day or two before in the Observer:-
“A short time since we stated that a proposal had been made for very consider-
ably reducing the time required for the transmission of telegraphic messages be-
tween this country and the south of Ireland. The outward and homeward American
mails now touch at Queenstown, and receive or land their mails and despatches.
Hitherto the news from America has been taken by steamer from ‘Roche's Point'
at the mouth of the harbour, up to Queenstown, and thence, if intended for London,
by telegraph, vid Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Doneghadee, Portpatrick, Dumfries, Car-
lisle, and Liverpool. This roundabout 'mode of sºn ing telegraphic messages, of
course produces many delays, for rapid as is the electric spark when fairly on its
º it must º the stern orders of its masters, stop at the appointed stations,
and wait till the line is signalled to be ‘all clear." Of this series of delay one has
already been removed. The telegraphic despatches are now sent direct from
Roche's Point. The despatches are made up at New York or Boston directed to
this point, where they are opened and start directly on their journey, without
having to make another stage, upon the little panting, puffing steamer that runs
to the Cove of Cork. A delay of an hour and a half is thus avoided, and the last
American news was received in London in time for the second edition of our daily
contemporaries, and the telegrams which were published in the Observer of Sunday
last were given to the public nearly two hours sooner than they would have been
but for the completion of this small section between Roche's Point and Queenstown.”
If we can't bridge the Atlantic with a telegraphic wire, at least we
may abridge the time it takes to forward a message vid Ireland; and
. further steps are being taken for this end, the following will
Snow :-
“The other portions of the project, which include the construction of a º
overland line between Cork and Waterford and Wexford, are being pushed forward
very rapidly. From Wexford the telegraph becomes a submarine line, and will
cross the Channel to St. David's Head, on the Welsh Coast, and be continued vid
Milford to London. When completed, the average saving in point of time will be
equal to º four hours. About fifty miles of the overland wires have already
been erected by Messrs. SILVER AND Co., between Cork and Wexford, and the
whole of this section will be completed in a few days. The wires are ºr.
upon ebonite insulators, and the experience which has already been obtained proves
that those insulators possess great superiority over those made of porcelain, glass,
or other partially non-conducting substances. In one part of the new telegraph
route it has been necessary to cross a small tidal arm running into the harbour of
Queenstown. The cable which has becn made for submerging at this point is of
extraordinary dimensions. Its weight is upwards of seventeen tons to the mile,
and is formed of eighteen thick protecting steel wires, enclosing eleven conductors,
each of which is made up of seven strands of copper wire. These are insulated with
India rubber, and it forms one of the most perfect and complete specimens of insu-
lation which has yet been made for the purpose of submarine telegraphy.”
If MEssieurs SILVER be successful in their present undertaking,
we trust that before long they may be so in a larger one; and that the
“great superiority” of their ebonite insulator may enable us to hold
discourse with distant countries more swiftly than at present we are
competent to do. If they continue to improve our means of wiredrawn
intercourse, we may be able before long to waft a sigh, by telegraph,
from Indus to the Pole, and possibly transmit a kiss (in writing) from
Calcutta to Cornhill. “Speech is Silver,” say the moralists; and
whatever tales we have to tell the submarines, no doubt the MESSIEURS
SILVER will enable us to tell them,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PEER AMONG THE PAUPERS.
“”TIs a rum thing to find a Peer in a Workhouse.”
The joke is not a bad one for a poor old fellow, the re-
cipient of in-door relief, who made it on his own name.
STINGY LODGER. “Tut, tut, tut; how very careless ºf me to be sure, not to lock up the
Bottle last night. I’ll be bound that Servant Gal has been at my Cod Liver Oil 7”
It is a better joke, too, than it seems; for this Peer was
a man of mark in his day; one who was on familiar terms
indeed with the actual Peerage. MR. PEER used to drive
the Red Rover—was it not?-fast coach between London
and Southampton.
J9HN PEER, once. JACK PEER to his noble and gentle
familiars, is now an inmate of the West London Union, in
which institution he was discovered by MR. M'WHINNIE,
from whom a letter giving an account of the discovery
*. the other day in the Times. PEER was ruined by
the railways, which destroyed his professional employ.
ment, for the loss whereof he got no compensation, not
being an officer of the Insolvent Court, and having no
CHELMSFORD to assert his claims.
. His generosity prevented the accumulation of any sav-
ings, which the want of that, virtue might possibly have
enabled him to put by. He is said, on good authority, to
have once given all his money, to a young, gentleman to
get him out of a scrape, which, but for that assistance,
would have ruined him.
PEER among the paupers is the model of a gentleman
in difficulties, visibly distinguished from his compeers by
the quiet dignity and patience with which he accepts his
situation. But how much longer is he to remain in the
workhouse?. That question might easily be settled among
the many noble lords and honourable gentlemen who may
yet remember sitting on the box in the good old coaching
days, and talking with the gallant coachman of whom age
and poverty have now got the whip-hand.
R. PEER's case is noticed in BAILY's Monthly Magazine
for April, and its statement concludes with the intimation,
that any sums remitted to MESSIEURs BAILY BROTHERs
Cornhill, on PEER's behalf, will be duly acknowledged an
properly applied.
A Government Office that Pays.
WE read that this year, not only has the Mint paid its
expenses, but even left a small margin of profit over. The
same cannot be said of every public department. How-
ever, we must not express our surprise too largely, for it
is clear that the Mint must necessarily contain within itself
more internal resources for “making money” than any
other Government Office.
A COIL OF BROODING MYSTERY.
ERTAINLY it is all very well to take a great
interest in the daily incubation of the
Python, but we are anxious to know what
is to become of the eggs when they are all
hatched. It was considered a great mira-
cle of St. Patrick to drive all the reptiles
qut of Ireland. It strikes us that we are
doing the very reverse of that same miracle
-for we are doing all we can to introduce
the breed into this country. , We believe
that there are about a hundred of these said
eggs. Will, the Zoological Gardens kindly
inform us what they intend doing with this
numerous progeny, supposing every egg
brings ...tº a live #. A hundred
serpents all playing away at once will be, of
course, a very pretty exhibition for those
who have a fine ear for such instruments, and we have but little
doubt, that every member of the “Pope's BRAss BAND” will make
a musical study of going to hear them; but will the residents of the
Regent's Park like the propinquity of such slippery, and, at times,
burglarious neighbours? #. now that we would'not live in the
vicinity for any inducement. We should not be able to go to bed
comfortably for fear of waking up in the middle of the night with a
great ugly slimy boa-constrictor coiling round our body, and carrying
us off there's no knowing whither, without even having the grace to
allow us time sufficient to put on our clothes.
We really hope that the Directors will see that these pretty pets are
kept Fº safe, under the strongest lock and key, or else we mean
to say it will be a great stinging shame; for if the whole lot of them
should escape across the Park, we pity the little children and nursery-
maids with their attendant life-guardsmen, who usually gambol there.
The cry of “Mad Bull” will be an angel's whisper compared to the
noise #. will be raised on that alarming occasion |
Then, there's the dread of their hiding in secret places, and breeding
all over the metropolis, and so gradually stretching themselves over
the entire, kingdom. It's no joke when you take into consideration
that a Python lays almost as heavily as any member of the betting ring.
It will lay you a hundred at any time; of course, we are talking of eggs.
Precautions shoul º e taken in time to guard against the
sibility of any such, evil. With so strong a tendency to large
amilies, England would be peopled with Pythons in no time, and then
it might . St. Patrick himself, or the greatest serpent-charmer in
the world, to rid us of such a dangerous invasion. We might be meat
to them, but they would only be poison to us.
Qf course, when they are duly hatched, (what a consternation there
will be on that day at Östend amongst the rabbits) the Directors will
begin to think of § them away. As a nobleman sends game to his
friends, so will the Zoological Gardens send these scaly monsters to the
Jardin des Plantes, and similar congenial institutions. As for selling
them, that will be totally out of the question, for when the º ls

ESSAYS AND REMARKS.
DVICE. – There are , many
persons who continually offer
you unsolicited advice, which,
when serious, is to do what
they would do if they were in
your place, and what, if they
were so, they, not being you
would perhaps be right in
doing, more probably wrong,
but if you, not "...i they,
were to do, you would cer.
tainly be a fool.
en, in difficult circum-
stances, you ask advice,
cause you really want it, you
seldom get any of the
least use. Few will take the
trouble of trying to under-
stand your perplexity, very
few of those who try to under-
stand it will be able, and
most, if not all, of that few,
will confess that they know
not what to advise, you.
- - Plenty of people will fº
you off-hand advice, recommending, you to do something which it
is either impossible for you to do, or to which it is advisable for you to
do exactly the contrary.
Almost the only advice ever, worth anything is that which is paid for
and that is not always worth the money. One physician in a thousan
may give !. tood advice. The best advice, on º: whole, is that of a
respectable solicitor.
MOTHER CHURCH TRIUMPHANT IN SPAIN.
(For the “Tablet.”)
DEPRECATING as too severe the lenient sentence of eleven years' penal
servitude which has been passed on DoN MANUEL MATAMoRos, DoN
ANGEL. ALHAMA, and DON MIGUELTRIG9, at Granada, for reading the
Bible, the Clamor Publico asks the following impertinent question:–
“What should we say if, on the plea of reprisals, our brethren living in Protestant
countries were compelled to renounce their religion under of being punished,
for exercising it, with the brand of the reprobate and the c of the convict?"
The Clamor Publico, as a Spanish Journal, belies its name. The
clamour of which the ºl. extract is a specimen is such as
might indeed be raised by the heretical British public, but never could
have been made by the faithful public of Spain. “To the stake with
the apostates! Let the heretics' beards be singed!”—that, in such a
case as that of MATAMoRos and his accomplices, would be the natural
of the Catholic Spanish *:::.
hat would Spanish Catholics say if a British court of justice had
condemned DRs. MANNING and NEwMAN to Pººl servitude for singing
Mass? Just what we ourselves should say if the thieves were, to get
the upper hand in this country and send professors of moral philosophy
to the hulks for lecturing against Communism, and maintaining the
rights of property. That would be persecution if you like; but there is
nº persecution in punishing thieves; still less is there any in the pun-
ishment of heretics. , Heresy is worse than thievery, and a felon is less
uilty than a man who presumes to read the Bible without the leave of
riest.
If MATAMoRos, and his companions in guilt had not been justly
punished for an offence st the faith, if the punishment inflicted on
them in the name of religion had not been authorised by the Church, of
course the Pope, ever prompt in the denunciation of error, would have
reprehended the mistake of its infliction with the utmost alacrity. The
Holy Father knows, too, well that to such acts of faith as the condem-
nation of the Spanish Bible-readers is mainly owing the detestation in
which his º authority is so very generally held in these evil
times, to the continually extending laceration of his paternal heart.
He is also fully aware that the same causes account for the contemp-
tuous laughter with which the House of Commons is accustomed to
receive the complaints of intolerance, and the demands for power, which
are so tºº, º by SIR GEORGE Bowy ER, and the other
warriors of his Holiness's faithful parliamentary. Irish Brigade. Yet
the Pope is silent. Of course. How could he disapprove of the con-
º: of MATAMORQs to the galleys, without condemning those acts
of stronger faith, which, in ages of more glowing charity, would have
consigned that heretic and his associates to the flames?

NUTS FOR CONSERVATIVES.
THE subjoined extract from a weekly contemporary appears to assert
º right of a people to choose their form of Government for them-
selves :-
“We have nover disguised our sympathy with the Southern States, nor our
ardent hope that they may prove victorious in this great strugglo for their inde.
pendence in their own homes.” -
What very generous sentiments! If it were not for the fact that
the independence of the Southern States will involve the perpetuation
of negro slavery, what true Englishman would not avow the same?
But why limit sympathetic generosity to the Southern Confederation?
Cannot the contemporary from whose columns the foregoing words are
taken also affirm º: it has never disguised its sympathy with the
Roman people, nor its ardent, hope that they likewise may prove vic-
torious in that great struggle for their independence in their own homes
which they have been solong engaged in? No; for the sympathy of that
contemporary with the Southern States is something pec ; 38
appears from the continuation of the passage quoted above:-
“Our sympathy with them is strengthened by the fact that the great Liberal
Party everywhere desires the success of their enemies.”
Take notice that the contemporary whose remarks we have been
resenting to you is the Tablet. The Romans are regarded as a very
ifferent sort of people from the Southerners by the organ of popery.
In its estimation the latter are as different from the former as, white
from black; and if the Southern negroes were in revolt against their
masters, our Popish contemporary would probably sympathise as little
with them as it does with the Romans, and as much with their masters
as it does with the Pope; particularly because the emancipation of
both the niggers and Romans is everywhere desired by the great
Liberal Party. Indeed we suppose the Tablet is ready to maintain
that the Romans are niggers, which amounts to no greater absurdity
than maintaining white to be black; and that, is nothing, to a jºurnal
holding the still more inconceivable dogmas which the Tablet professes;
No doubt the Tablet, in the interests of its party, is prepared to contend
that white is black; and the affirmative of that same proposition would,
for the same purpose, be also readily voted by the representatives of
that party in the House of Commons who are banded to turn out LQRD
PALMerston's Government, to the end of reversing his foreign policy.

John TOMKINS AND ARRY BL0ATER,
Time of Queen Wicroala, 1862—not at all scarce
'Arry (in the Boots of the Period). “Yes, THEy’RE Dooced CompoRTABLE, AND THEY
grwe one A MILITARY AND RATHER Sporting APPEARANCE, I Fancy.”
NO MORE ARMSTRONG GUNS!
THE Great Exhibition of 1862 is destined to cement the
whole human brotherhood. That of 1851 was to have done
so, but did not; for it was soon followed by the Russian
ar and Indian Mutiny, and lastly by hostilities with
China. In regard to China, however, arrangements have
been made with Poo-Loo to repair every breach, as well
as to unite any other fracture that may occur elsewhere.
To promote the fraternisation of mankind it is proposed
to set the world an example, which cannot but conduce to
that desirable result. Measures are in active progress for
the embellishment of our public places with the statues of
distinguished foreigners.
The statues of DANTE, TAsso, GQETHE, Scºttºn,
RAcINE, MolièRE, CoRNEILLE, and Bāranger, will be
put up in Westminster Abbey, if there is room for them
there; if not they will be placed, with other European
celebrities, in Trafalgar Square, that being confessedly the
finest site in Europe. In this situation also will be stationed
those of CHARLEs THE Twelfth, FREDERICK THE GREAT,
Masséna, Soult, and a few more of NAPQLEoN's Generals.
With a view to paying a delicate º the statue
of NApoleon himself will be set in Waterloo Place.
The Houses of Parliament will be decorated with statues
of Voltai RE, Rousseau, MIRABeau, DANton, MARAT,
and Robespºnrºe; Pozzo Dr Borgo, METTERNICH, NEs-
sELRope, and other Continental statesmen and philosophers.
Bossuet will have a statue in Smithfiel -
The statues of as º: illustrious strangers as time
and money will allow will be reared in various parts of the
Metropolis, which will thus acquire quite a cosmopolitan
character. The inauguration of these statues will doubtless
inaugurate the reign of universal peace in the family of
Man, and impel the peoples, now armed to the teeth against
each other, to discard their armaments and rush into each
other's arms. The only possible objection to the propºsed
sculptures will be obviated by getting them executed by
foreign artists; for if we employed native talent to make
them, they might, unfortunately, chanóe to be mistaken for
caricatures. -
N.B. Mr. Punch, of 85, Fleet Street, will take care of
any money which may be sent to him as a subscription
towards the contemplated statues.

you before, no end of a Brick. - -
But I am not quite clear that I am satisfied with the definition you
laid down on Friday, in the case of the Morning Post and the lady who
did not like to be laughed at about that dog business. The result of
the trial, and the Farthing for the ill-advised lady, were all right, and
would leave nothing to regret, but that the Post has to pay its own
heavy costs, and that you, my dear ERLE, have emitted the unsatis-
factory definition.
Definitions are difficult things. SHAkspeaRE intimates that onl
very scholarly minds should undertake them, when he makes Armado
say to Moth, “Define, define, well-educated infant.”

OClety.
My dear L. C. J., surely you must see that this is to put down all
press criticism, and to bring back the law of libel to what it was in the
old days, when a libel was defined to be anything that was in the slight-
est degree disagreeable to anybody. Surely any person who is cen-
sured at all is t º made less, comfortable in Society. Even you
yourself, my ERLE, who are one of the most rational and sensible, and
also one of the goodest and kindest men going, will be (momentarily
only, I hope) rendered less comfortable in Society by knowing that I
have signified incomplete satisfaction with one of your dicta. Yet, you
would not come down on me as a libeller, my dear fellow, would you?
Besides, ought not even a rational and sensible person who does an
absurd thing (of course you and I don't talk of women as rational or
sensible) to be visited with castigation and discomfort, in his own
interest and that of society?
Besides, again, is not the comfort of society to be considered, and

Misapplication of Peter's Pence.
THE Lamoricière Sword Fund has, at GENERAL LAMoRICHERE's re-
quest, been handed over to the “Peter's Pence Association.” According
to the Tablet, the Secretary to the Lamoricière Testimonial Committee
has disappeared, and there is “a very considerable difference between
the amount acknowledged by advertisements in the newspapers, and
the amount forthcoming.” If Peter's Pence have been appropriated by
somebody else, we fear it will turn out that the party has not been
robbing PETER to pay PAUL. But suppose the pence had all reached
Rome. Would PETER not have been robbed to pay Chlavone *

The good old lady has sent it to Vulcan to have it instantly iron-

“WE’RE not won TH A RAP, AND we've got no WoRk To Do!”
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
APRIL 7th, Monday.—A Lord presented a complaint from the Vicar
of Woolley, that there is very little fleece on his flock, and he himself is
clipped very close by the tax-gatherer. The poor gentleman's case
seems a hard one, but we must hope that Providence will temper the
wind for the shorn Vicar until good fortune raises it for him. Another
Lord urged the º of military drill in public schools, and LoRD
CLARENDoN thought the system most desirable, but that it ought not
to be compulsory,
Asked, whether Government would propose, a vote in aid of the
ALBERT Monolith, PALMERSTON answered, that he did not mean either
to be rude or to reply.
MR. Disraeli then offered some criticisms on the Budget speech of
MR. GLADSTONE. Let us interpolate the remark, that one of those
calculating idiots who can never see anything without computing what
it would be if it were something else which it never can be, has estimated
most likely with perfect inaccuracy) that had the report of MR.
Lapstone's speech been printed word after word in a straightline, it
would have made 144 yards. The same fool is now calculating how
near the moon MR. PEABODy's gift would reach if it were paid in half-
pennies, and these were piled one above the other. He is next going
to calculate whether, if every visitor to the International stood upon
the shoulders of another, and this one on a third, and so up, the top
visitor would be as high as Chimborazo, and he means to complete the
cycle of absurd investigation by supposing that the poor º;
ins of having her eggs addled to amuse Sunday starers, had been
allowed to hatch them, and that each young serpent had been as long
as its mamma, and the whole family had been arranged in a line, the
tail of one in the mouth of the other, and by calculating how many
times, this line would go round the dome of St. Paul's. It is a pit
that there is no stone-breaking or other useful labour provided for suc
people.
If it be objected that these remarks have nothing to do with MR.
Dishakli's speech, we reply that we don't care, and also that they have
as much to do with MR. Dish AELI's F. as that speech had with the
*::: subsequentNº. or he applied himself to smash up
! the calculations of MR. GLApstone, to charge him with mystification,
with extravagance, with spending seven millions and a half improperly,
with stopping Exchequer money. “Hounslow fashion,” with using
rhetoric to bewilder the House, with placing us in a “terrible scrape,”
with waving an enchanter's wand, with making moonshine, with
insinuating that he dislikes the expenditure he encourages, with bein
a spendthrift who weeps over pence, with being a Penurious Prodi
with having in other, days prattled about political morality, and with
defending a system detrimental to the character of public men, and
most injurious to the fortunes of the realm. Well, these are good hard
words and hard charges, and if MR. DisBAELI believed them to be
ust (and a Member of Parliament, never says º: unjust), it was
is business, one might think, at least to take the sense of the House
whether such a wicked Minister should be allowed to push on his
nefarious schemes. MR. DisRAELI sat down.
Refreshed by a moral glass of bitter beer, that is, by a sensible little
complaint from MR. Bass against the new licence to Brewers, MR.
GLADstone then replied to MR. Disrapiſ. He scoffed at MR.
DISRAELI's talking of the characters of public men, was ironical upon
his condemnation of rhetoric and sophistry, said that he had no faithin
the financial system at which Parliament has been labouring for twenty
years, called him a Ransacker of Hansard, accused him of having
doubly blundered when Chancellor of the Exchequer, said it was not
difficit to bear censures from him, as better men had done, denied all
his allegations, and would not have complained of the speech at all, had
it been made with an honest purpose.
Hector and Achilles having fought, we presume that few desire to

SIR John SHELLEY tried to º the Second Reading of the
Thames Embankment Bill, and the division shows how admirably this
Metropolitan Member represents the feeling of the country. The Bill
was read by 116 to 9.
Tuesday. Both Houses seemed to want rest after their labours, and
besides, it was the first night of the Opera. GARIBALDI is an interesting
person, but, William Tell, a gentleman in the same line, has also his
claims on the attention of the legislature. Nothing of the slightest
importance took place in either House of Parliament, but at MR.GYE's
house TAMBERLIK was in the most magnificent voice, and in the words
of a critic, “All his previous achievements paled before his magnificent
rendering of the ramous ‘Suiver-moi;’ and here the clear º:
º vigour with which the Italian tenor hurled forth those startling
ut de poitrine,which can never fail to rouse the most torpid listener to
enthusiasm, electrified the audience as completely as though they had
never before heard a C delivered from the chest.”
hºednesday was given to Qysters, parsons, and sewers. Touching the
first, MR. Cave fittingly asked a question about the bottom of the sea,
and an equally unfathomable quarter, the EMPEROR of THE FREnch,
and was informed that a recent decree of L. N.'s had nothing to do
with our oyster-fishery convention. The Bill for releasing, from their
canonical liabilities the clergymen who desire to abandon the surplice
was debated with fairness, and was referred to a Select Committee. A
Bill for giving enormous taxing powers to the Metropolitan Board of
Works was discussed in committee, and some 86 clauses agreed to.
MR. Cox will be kind enough to look up the history of Athens, and see
what is said about the Thirty Tyrants, as it may shortly be necessary
to take some energetic steps in the direction of liberty.
Thursday. Some educational conversation in the Lords, and Peer
ELLENBorough regretted that the weakness of Government had com-
elled them to make important sacrifices of principle in reference to the
vised Code. But he believed that if F.H. would refuse all aid
to Education an impetus would be given to it, and it would be grate-
fully received, whereas gratitude and economy both walked off when
public money came in.
Qn the previous Tuesday a most important experiment was performed
at Shoeburyness. The invulnerability of the Iron-Plated Ship, when
opposed to the Armstrong Gun, was at issue, and SIR WILLIAM ARM-
strong settled the question. A target, made like the side of the
Warrior, but stronger, was set up, and he let fly at it from a non-rifled
gun, with a 150lb. ball, at 200 yards, and with 40lb. of powder. He
smashed right through the target, and had the ship been opposed to
that gun we should now have a ship the fewer. , Qn this subject there
was, naturally, the utmost interest excited, and in both Houses the
Ministers had to answer questions. As to what is to be done next
Mr. Punch begs to refer mankind to a probable Chronology which will
be found in another column. He is glad to add, that CAPTAIN Coles is
being properly treated by the Admiralty; a miracle, considering that
Coles is an inventor of a valuable affair.
Inquiries were made after the health of the Big Bell...MR. Cowper;
professed great sorrow for its condition. He had called in medical
advice, and had very properly selected DR PERcy, who is not only our
ſº but our biggest metallurgist, to examine the gigantic patient.
R. PERCY thought that the Be #: be used, but would probably
crack and come down in pieces, and this catastrophe MR. CowPER did
not like to risk, especially as the bell makes a most abominable noise.
So the large quarter-belſ gives the hour, and MR. CowPER does not
mean to do anything more with the wopper at present. Perhaps he

Then did the Government get a beating. Mr. Punch, who foresaw it,

ing, of course, that the measure would be rejected by $3 to 81 on the
tenth of April. Which it was, Mr. Punch's prophetical powers being
once more vindicated in the most wonderful manner. The putting
the Courts where it was propºsed to place them would have the advan-
tage of cutting up an abominable neighbourhood, but would cost an
awful quantity of money, whereas there is the site of Lord WILLIAM
Russeill’s execution ready for the architect. But Government have

UT from a column
of miscellaneous
intelligence in the

following para-
aph is respect-

the readers of
Punch:-
“The EMPEROR NA-
PolroN, in his º;
ment of women, held
that it was their busi-
ness to dress exqui-
sitely and to look

tart is MADAME RACHEL. It is effected by º: appliances of Arabian
#. which give a matchless brilliancy and lustre to the hair, teeth, and com-
plexion, rendering woman what she ought to be, beautiful beyond comparison."
It is not likely that the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN would have very much ad-
mired the ladies of the élite who frequent fashionable and crowded assem-
blies, if it is true that enamelling is the only way they have of displaying
their matchless beauty; a beauty which is matchless only insomuch as
it is . and a drug in the match-market. Such beauty is
precisely matched by the loveliness of a whited sepulchre...If any of
the enamelled ladies of the élite are wives of the élite, the élite are not
to be envied., A lady whose face wants mending has no business to
dress exquisitely, but ought to dress with the plainness which suits her
features; and she cannot look lovely, but may look hideous, and makes
herself look so by getting her visage enamelled. - -

that at present our means of defence are utterly inadequate. The Duke
of CAMBRIDGE said that no question had engrossed public attention
to such a degree as the question of iron plates and cannon-balls, which
sensible remark shows that to a certain extent our George understands
what is going on outside the Oss Guards.
SIR GEORGE GREY has issued an order Pºf down Perambulators.
Materfamilias, may be incensed, but he has. That is to say, he has

The week was finished by an exceedingly good Italian debate, if that
can be called a debate in which Bowyer, NNEssy and Maguire
attacked the free institutions of Italy, and these were defended by
I AYARD, GLApstone, and PALMERsrös. It was hardly fair play for
the poor dwarfs, but it was pleasant to hearthegiants come out strong.
Mr. Punch seldom quotes, out of mercy to those whose pinchbeck must
suffer i. miserably beside his gold, but he must give PAM's gallant
peroration:-
“I trust that Rome may soon be destined to exercise, not an arbitrary power
over the world, but a great and distinguished influence over Europe. I Fºthat
when it becomes the capital of Italy it will exercise its power for the development
of intellect—the encouragement of the arts and sciences—for improvements of every
kind—and for the promotion of commercial activity and political wisdom. When
that time arrives, and I trust it is not so distant as hon, gentlemen opposite expect
it to be, I shall be willing that posterity shall judge between those who may have
contributed to that result by the wisdom of their counsels—by their advice-and
moral influence; and those who doggedly resisted it, and were He champions and
defenders of eve ing corrupt, tyrannical, and oppressive in the former institu-
tions of Italy. en that time comes, I formally appeal to that tribunal for a
decision in our favour. (Cheers.)”

exactly opposite counsel, and you yourselves are by no means disinclined

ately.
You are told that you have obtained a small majority in the House of
Commons; that is to say, that on a division, if everybody came up to
the scratch and voted according to expectation, you might defeat the
Government, and make them go out.
You are told that all this means that the country desires a Tory
Government; that is to say, that we should like to see PALMERstos

BüRy, and RoundELL PALMER by
Now, please hearken unto me.
There is no doubt that, by fair means or foul, you have won a good
many elections.
I do not believe that you have a majority in Parliament, but if you
have one it is a * little one, and certainly not one on which a
Government could work.
But I dº believe that if you picked a good quarrel, and DisPAELI
managed the battle with tact, you might, with the aid of some of the
h, manage to place the Government in an awkward position, Your

have to resign, or to offer to do so.
Then you would find out how you had been done.
The country does not want your men in office.
PAM would either demand a second trial of strength, when the
country would put the screw on the House, and reverse the decision
you had obtained, or he would dissolve, and ask the country whether it
wants LoRD DERby. Then you would have the answer in a strong
working majority against you, and you would be far worse off than you
are at present.
Now, don't be angry and offended. Most of you are good fellows.

the position, if you don't. . - - -
You have not even a recognised daily organ of the slightest weight,
and yet you fancy yourselves a Party. Of course I know that there
is the dear old Standard, with its feeble paper and feebler writing, and
its bald provincial puffin of your notorieties; but even when one's
whitey-brown is exhausted, the Standard seems hardly strong enough
for shaving paper., A Party without an organ!
The English of this is, that we are ALL CoNSERVATIVEs.
We mean to preserve what good things we have got, and we know

º if a new roof or new out-buildings are wanting, we are not the

Your men are not Conservatives, and would be bad tenants.
The country knows all about this, and is quite satisfied with PAM,
who is a better Conservative than any of your men. . . . . .
If you are wise, you will be content with the situation, in which you
are º and if you are sincere you will rejoice that the country is
content with true Conservatism.
Don’t let a pack of Tadpoles and Tapers persuade you that you;

A MOUNT IN THE MIDLANDS. APRIL, 1862. DELICIOUS 1
HOW WULCAN GAVE IRON ARMOUR TO TAURUS-
NEPTUNUS.
(FROM PUNCH's HomER.)
To him the artist-god: “Each fear resign,
Secure, what Vulcan can is ever thine:
For thee, O Taurus, will I forge a plate
Whose º §§ scorn the thunder-bolt of fate;
Much more the Dahlgren ball, or onset rude
Qf any Swede who ever turnip chewed., .
Go, and thy º hither send to bring
An armour worthy of the ocean-king.” .
Then Taurus went, and thought as he withdrew,
That war was foolish and expensive too
But none might blame him, arming to defend
His loved BRITANNIA, freedom's honoured friend.
Sudden a rush of wings, fair forms appear
And silver voices break upon his ear:
The Nereids of the deep his eye surveyed,
Bearing the arms Vulcanic skill had made.
Thalia, Glauce, every watery name,
Nescea mild, and gentler Spio came,
Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,
And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.
*::::A; oto, Melita,
Agave gentle and Amphithoe gay,
And dark Janira, and Janassa fair,
And Amatheia with her amber hair;
If more than these the Limner's skill makes seen,
He’ll find more names in Iliad, B. xviii.
They brought the Iron Arms, and Taurus, glad,
Himself therein impenetrably clad.
And “Now,” he said, “come on who dares or can,
Long ranges, or close quarters, I’m his man.”
THE ATTACK AND THE DEFENCE.-GLADSTONE's Budget against
DISRAELI's Hum-budget.
ESSAYS AND REMARKS.
ApwikaTION.—HoRACE, was but partially right, in preaching Ni!
admirari. To admire º: whatever is far from being the one and
only rule that can make and keep people happy. The happiest of men
is he who thoroughly admires himself. Self-admiration would render a
woman equally happy if she could be content with that; but women
are not satisfied without the admiration of other folks. , Neither are so
many menas might be expected to be, from being endowed with the faculty
of reason, which distinguishes man from the loweranimals and the fairsex.
Indifference to the admiration of others saves you from allºunhap-
piness but what is caused by poverty, illness, domestic affliction,
punishment, and the fear of it.
A man may admire himself in the mirror with much greater delight
than that which a woman derives from the same contemplation of her
own beauty, or the ugliness which she mistakes for beauty; because he
may not care whether anybody, else admires him or no, but a woman is
always uneasy on that point, Suppose a man is caught by a number of
his acquaintance dancing before a looking-glass, as represented in
MR. CRUIKshaNK's caricature, he will, if regardless of others, feel no
vexation, except at being interru ted in ſis enjoyment, and, if the
spectators leave him alone, will perhaps go on dancing. - -
An ill-made, coarse-featured, stupid.looking man, who admires his
own person, is as happy in himself as the finest young fellow, in the
Grenadier Guards, if he is as well off, and perhaps happier if he does
not care how his clothes are made, and has no anxiety about his boots.
If you try to be admired, expect to be ridiculed. They who laugh at
each º one another's backs laugh at you behind yours. If
you are not ridiculed, you will be envied. Very likely you will be
ridiculed and envied too, - -- -
Love of admiration in a wife would be all very well if it centred
wholly in her husband; but then she would want to dress, every º at
home as splendidly as she is drest at evening parties; which wºuld be
too expensive for the majority of men: who, as it is, complain that the
milliners' bills which they have to pay are excessive.
Toast AND SENTIMENT.-Our Ironsides—the Navy and Women of
England.

A ROMAN HOLIDAY.
For daring to publish the pastoral which announced the intended
celebration of the tercentenary of the massacre of 4,000 unarmed
Huguenots in cold blood and violation of a solemn º on the day
of Pentecost, the 17th of May, 1562, at Toulouse, all honour to the
Archbishop of that see., Consistency for ever!. All honour to, the
Pope for not having condemned the pastoral of his consistent prelate.
This was none of your hypocritical effusions of rigmarole, affecting
Çhristian love and compassion for poor lost sheep. It was a bold win:
dication of what, According to the Archbishop's creed, and the creed of
the Roman See, which has sanctioned its publication, is an act of faith,
but what the world in general calls an act of murder. -
The French Government has prohibited the celebration of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew the É. so to speak, which the brave
old Archbishop intended to commemorate. erein it has perhaps
acted with prudence. It is possible that enemies and persecutors of
the Saints, if there are any in Toulouse, would have hissed the holy
man, and pelted him at the head of his procession with rotten eggs;
thus converting the triumph of the Church into a profane ovation.
The disapproval, however, of the contemplated ceremony, which has
been published in the Moniteur, must of course be understood with due
reservation. The ARCHBishop of Toulouse and the Holy See have
adopted the Huguenot massacre of 1562—are what we wretched
heretics call accessories after the fact. The ex-KING OF NAPLEs sub-
sidises the Neapolitan brigands; the Pope harbours the ex-King of
NAPLEs, and French troops uphold the Pope. The EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH cannot be considered serious in censuring the ARCHBishop of
Toulouse, whilst his arms maintain the temporal power of the Holy

THE PECULLARITIES OF A SMOKY CHIMNEY.
In a lodging-house, the following peculiar characteristics are pretty sure to be found
connected with a smoky chimney:—
“This is the first complaint that has ever been made about it.”
“It’s very strange! It never was known to smoke before!” . -
“It only, smokes when the wind is in a particular direction” (that direction being
generally all points of the compass). - -
... If the front kitchen door is only opened a bit, it will soon give over smoking.”
“It’s allowing to JANE not knowing how to light, the fire. That foolish girl will never
follow the instructions that are given her. Why will she persist in laying the coals at the
bottom, and the wood on the top?” -
“The truth is, the chimney is a little damp from the quantity of rain that has lately fallen.
Only be patient with it five minutes, and it will soon give over.” -
“Does it want sweeping? Oh! Lor bless you—no, Sir—it’s as clean' as you are—why it
was only swept a week or two ago!” - -
“It is very, froublesome to be sure!” (This is when the room is as full of smoke, as it
can hold.). “If you can throw all the windows and doors open only for a quarter of an hour
º it £,as sweetly as possible. It never does pull properly, until it has fully warmed
up to lts work.
“The cause of its smoking is, because you put on too many coals, Sir. You shouldn't put
on more than a handful at a time.” (Of course, this is when you pay a specified sum per week
for what they call “firing.”) -
“It always is the case, Sir, when they’re taking up the gas-pipes in the street opposite.
The reason is, you see, Sir, it creates too strong a ãº xx
[And many other reasons, equally ingenious, and true.
Geography Corrected.
The World, we were told at school, is divided into four quarters. This is all very well
for any one who is attached, either by birth, or association, to a particular country, but your
Cosmopolitan, your true Citizen of the World, soars far above such narrow limits or notions.
He is able to find his quarters in any part of the globe, wherever he may be.

THE DAYS WHEN WE WORE
STRAPS.
In the days when we wore straps,
MELBourne ruled the commonweal,
Taking—we were then young chaps—
Turns with WELLINGTON and PEEL;
Most of all our rising men
Puling in their nurses' laps:
Some were not in being then,
In the days when we wore straps.
Railways were a wonder new,
In those days, beneath the sun;
stage-coaches, one or two,
Did continue still to run.
Telegraphic wires were not;
Several days had to elapse
Ere our foreign news we got,
In the days when we wore straps.
Indian-rubber then was dear,
Gutta-percha not yet known;
No rare thing was good strong beer,
Brewed with malt and hops alone;
Beer of which the likeness flows
From but few existing taps;
None did bitter ale compose
In the days when we wore straps.
Science had not yet to bear
Brought the Sun's pictorial rays;
Photographs not any were
Published in those other days.
Every Christian's chin was shorn.
Saving only MUNTZ, perhaps,
Beards by none but Jews were worn
In the days when we wore straps.
Sides of ladies, robe and skirt
Moderate of dimensions, clad,
Filled no doorway, swept no dirt ;
_Petticoats had not gone mad.
Hildeous hoops revived we’ve seen,
Hoops, to hinder their collapse!
Folly wore no Crinoline
In the days when we wore straps.
Then Retrenchment was the word;
Estimates afforded room
For the censures, duly heard,
Of unflinching Joseph HUME.
Fleets and troops we durst reduce,
In our armour leaving gaps;
Ironsides were not in use
In the days when we wore straps.
Peace, if Plenty did not reign
Britain's isles with safety blest;
Ireland only, and insane
Chartists, troubled England's rest.
Tranquil were the Üniteſ States;
France to change her neighbours' maps
Sought not at those distant dates,
In the days when we wore straps.
Then, as we were wont to boast,
Was the schoolmaster abroad,
Whipping every witch andfººt
Into nothing with his rod.
Spirits, under tables heard, . .
Through a “Medium,” giving raps,
Would have been thought too absurd
In the days when we wore straps.
Though fine things of every kind
Were not, as at present, cheap,
Folks of a contented min
Moderate means would better keep;
What they did not throw away
They could save, against mishaps;
With no income Tax to pay
In the days when we wore straps.

INDIGNATION MAKING WIERSES.
We have received a very indignant, letter from an
American Correspondent, who states that, in his opinion
Poets have no right to compose verses which will not lend
themselves to paraphrase. He has been trying, he says,
all the morning, (and with his coat off.) to fit the Laureate's
Balaklava Poem to the subject of the Advance of the Grand
Army of the Potomac, and in a perfect fury he encloses
this specimen, as all that he has been able to make of it.
He considers that the conduct of the English at Balaklava
in being only Six Hundred, and that of the Laureate in
not making verses that would do for the far more glorious
Six Hundred Thousand, are perfectly offensive, and he
threatens that when the South is put down, we shall hear
more about it. Meantime, we hasten to try and assuage
his fiery wrath by printing his lines.

Into the Valley of Mud
Went the Six Hundred Thousand,
All of them awfull

But in that Virginian muck
Stiffly each hero stuck,
And all at M'Clellan's pluck
Gloriously wondered.

WIWAT REGINAT
On Maundy Thursday
among , the customary
Royal charities distributed
at Whitehall, there was a
number of white purses,
each white purse contain-
ing the “Maundy coin,”
namely, fourpenny, three-
penny, twopenny, ...and
penny pieces in silver,
amounting together to
forty-three pence, the age

contained eight-and-four-

“LET GLASGOW FLOURISH.”
GLAsgow, we believe, claims to be considered the capital of Scotland,
vice Edinburgh. , Glasgow rests its claim to the honour, we are further
iven to un erstand, upon its enormous
lathedral, its splendid supply of water from Loch Katrine, the awfully
tall stalk of a chemist's works, an erection which is either 400 or 4000
feet high, and the most wickedly tempting Luncheon House in which
a man ever spoiled his dinner. These are not bad claims to the position
demanded, and as we—in common with the world—like to heap wealth
upon the rich, we will suggest another basis on which Glasgow may
rest its claim. It seems to have an appreciation for something better
than mere trade, though that is a thing too. We perceive by the
Glasgow. Herald that there has been a large gathering, headed by one
of the Members for the city, to do honour to an individual, and to pre-
sent him with his Bust. Of course this individual was the DUKE of
BRAEMORE, or the MARQUIs of MossGIEL, or SIR DUNCAN MACsPLEU.
CHAN, or THE ToDDIE of ToDDIE. No such thing. Then it was some
highly opulent gentleman of private renown. It was BAILIE BAwbee
or CouncILLOR HADDock, or ShERIFF SAwLIE. Again no such thing.
Then it was a thunderous Minister of the Kirk, or a U.P. celebrity, the
REv. DAVID M'CALVIN, or the Rev. GoLIAh M“SABBATH. Again
wrong. The party to whom honour was done in this way, a way
usually reserved in Scotland, and in that part of the kingdom of
Scotland called England, for Śwells by birth or by accumulation, was
.# a Painter. Yes, just that. An Artist-body, DANIEL MACNEE
of the Royal Scottish Academy. There seems to have been much soun
sense talked by the speakers, but had their orations been far worse
than they were, the fact, that in a commercial metropolis, the chief
men of the synagogue are moved to assemble to do honour to a Mere
Artist, would have been eloquent enough. ...But that it may be seen
that Glasgow is quite in earnest in its art enthusiasm, and that this is
no mere sentimental spurt in favour of a friend, here is a bit from the
speech of the excellent and accomplished SHERIFF BELL:–
* When I look abroad at the present state of art in this country, I find that what
is i.º.º. of as the English school, and it is a very eminent school, should
with great truth and accuracy of language be called the Scottish school—(hear, hear)
—because I find that in every department of art the most eminent artists belong to
this country. (Applause.) en I visit the exhibition of the Royal Academy in
London, and look round its walls for the most beautiful and interesting portraits,
I find that they are painted by SIR JNo. WATson GoRDoN, the President of the
Royal Scottish Academy, by FRANcis GRANT, by GRAHAM Gilbert, by MAGNEE, by
Swinton, and by other eminent Scotchmen. (Cheers.) When I look for the most

CoNsidering what a rich reward may be obtained by acting tolerably

officer named in the subjoined extract from the Army and Mary

[APRIL 26, 1862.
A REVISED CODE FOR BOARDING SCHOOLS.
E have lately heard,
Mr. Punch, nearly as
much about National
Education as we have
about National De-
fences. If any subject
can be more interest-
ing than the education
of charity children, it
is perhaps the educa-
tion of our own. Were
all schoolmasters to be
paid for results, we
should some of us find
the schooling of our
youth come compara-
tº; cheap.
“A young gentle-
man in whose studies
I am interested, be-
tween nine and ten,
has been supposed to
be for the last two
years learning Latin.
I had occasion, the
other day, to ask him
about hic, hac, hoc, and
found that his ideas on
that subject were of
the vaguest kind... He
could not even tell me
the English for hoc at
all. This was not af.
fected ignorance. He
knew what Musa was
Latinfor, and Dominus,
but not Miamster." He
told me all he knew:
In the education of this young gentleman the rod has been entirely dispensed with. ...You will
suggest that its moderate use might have increased his erudition. I think not. Nor is he
a young dunce; but only rather idle and inattentive. Severe and merciless flogging might
have made him learn a little more; and detest learning for ever.
“I wish to propose a plan of tuition whereby the ...; idea may be taught to shoot inde-
pendently of §. twigs; these being left to flourish on the parent tree, or properly
applied in the shape of brooms. -
“All H." not idiots, will learn, what they needs must, in order to live... I would have
boys obliged to earn not exactly their bread, but their bread-and-butter. Performance of
tasks should be the necessary condition to enjoyment of butter, and not only enjoyment of
butter, but also enjoyment of pudding, or pie, or anything whatever more savoury than
bread and meat, and skyblue. º lesson remaining unlearned, no luxury allowed. ..
“The discipline of a school would thus resemble that of a workhouse, with this difference,
that the latter is simply penal and vindictive, like that of a place dissimilar to a workhouse
chiefly in being open not only to the Pauper, but also to the Rich Man. Besides the
school-system would afford a place of repentance to the defaulter, which the workhouse
does not, any more than the other place. Privation would cease on the instant of amendment.
Moreover there would be no stint as to quantity of nourishment; no semi-starvation....The
portion of indolence would be a coarser kind of food, indeed, but enough of that. Since,
however, a coarser kind of food is more filling than a daintier, it is altogether more
economical. Therefore I should think the dietetic, system, of school discipline, must
commend itself especially to principals of Classical, Mathematical, and Commercial Academies,
Establishments, and Boarding Schools in general, whose profits are in chief part derived from
arding young gentlemen, remarkable for an alacrity at alimentary consumption much
exceeding their appetite for knowledge. -
“As a friend of education, especially desirous of having youth well grounded, in the
rudiments of learning, permit me to subscribe myself, “A. B. C.”
ABD-EL-KADER AND HIS HORSE."
ABD-EL-KADER has been presenting to the EMPEROR NAPOLEON a most wonderful
Arabian colt, “whose pedigree can be traced fifty erations back, and pure from any
crossing.” This is very kind of the exiled Émir. We recollect how in the Algerian wars
with Louis PHILIPPE, ABD-EL-KADER's horse was being continually shot in the bulletins.
The French always got near enough to shot the Arab chief's horse, but, they could never get
sufficiently near to apprehend the Arab chief himself: though one would imagine that, when
a rider's horse had been shot under him, it would be no very difficult matter to capture the
rider! Why, the number of App EI-KADER's horses killed in that long war must have been
ºl. fully to the number of bulletins issued. We wonder that the equine race was not
wholly exterminated in the neighbourhood of the Kabyles. However, the above giſt
proves ABD-ELKADER to be an extremely grateful man. He displays the best form of
atitude—forgiveness of past injuries. Though the French took hundreds and hundreds of
iorses, literally, from under him, he is not above sending them the best one he can find
in return. Generosity, now, is his only cheval de
bataille.
We see that the description says that, this
wonderful colt is “pure from any crossing.
this respect, it may be said to resemble the
streets of Paris, which are also “pure from
any crossings,” though much cannot be, said
for their purity in consequence, for it is almost
impossible, in rainy weather, to cross the muddy
Boulevards. The crossing-sweeper as a ºff.;
agent has never been introduced into the Frenc
metropolis. If it were not for the length of the
adies' dresses, the streets of Paris would never
be swept at all after five o’clock in the morning.
The best tºº, is to wait, until you see a lady
going over to the other side of the Y. and then
to follow close behind her. "You will find the
road-way swept cleaner than by any broom.
ROGUES OF THE WORLD.
(A Bellow.)
My hand is ever in my pocket,
And ever out again as fast;
My war-bill, like an endless rocket,
ounts up, but mounting grows more vast.
No sooner am I out of trouble,
And thank my stars that plague is gone,
When, quick, a new woe costs me double:
Oue down, another still comes on.
I had to reconstruct my Navy,
When canvas was deposed by steam;
I poured my riches forth like gravy,
And then indulged a pleasing dream
That now ’twas all my safety needed;
But here I’m forced, too sanguine then,
Since iron wood has superseded,
To reconstruct it o'er again.
Mº. of progress all are undone
y mere demands for self-defence.
How I should like to rebuild London!
And might, except for that expense.
How fain the arts of use and beauty
Would I pursue, my huge police
Not forced to keep on constant duty,
Against the world to guard my peace!
I do not care a straw for glory;
I hate and scorn the brutes who do;
Have no increase of territory,
No gain at others' loss, in view.
I seek no pretext or occasion
To vindicate a tyrant's cause;
I meditate no base invasion
Of neighbours' liberties and laws.
Then why, oh why, with execration
Do foreign nations load my name,
And my supreme humiliation
Approaching, evermore proclaim?
Why go exhausting their resources
To injure me with effort vain?
sº still I make my forces;
d where they were they there remain.
I can but form one supposition;
And that the heart within me grieves.
Why they all compass my perdition
Is, I have wealth and they are thieves.
The more I thrive, the more I flourish,
The more I must expect to spend,
My goods, against the rogues who nourish
esigns against me, to defend.
Easter Amusements.
A BANQUET is to be given to the O'Donoghue

treat is anticipated. It is the only burlesque we

GE.-It is not true that º
woman always objects to tell
her age. Some women will
readily own their age when
they have lived to be 80 or
90 years old, and have given
up the expectation of being
married if single, or of getting
re married if their husbands
should die. A very aged lady
who has sense enough to
S know that she can, and could
under any circumstances, no
longer hope for a wooer, will
even spontaneously proclaim
her age when that informa-
tion is likely to elicit the
remark, that she is a wonder-
ful woman.
A woman will also declare
her age, if she is so young-
looking as to be liable to be
mistaken for a child. She
will not mind telling her age
if she looks very old, but is
not nearly so old as she
looks.
A girl who, if she were
much older would not tell
Age, is. ſº called venerable, and con-
sidered ridiculous. Small boys are apt, as it
were by instinct, to make faces behind the backs
of their aged relatives and preceptors, some of
whom, if they catch them doing so, are so in-
censed as to scold them, making, themselves, in
their fury, faces still more grotesque. Men to
whom age brings wisdom, which it does not
bring to, everybody, will, if their dispositions
are kindly and genial, cheerfully acquiesce in
that appointment of nature whereby the tem-
porary absurdities of their external appearance
enable them, like toys, or figures of fun, to
afford innocent but short-lived amusement to
simple minds.

THE PLEASURES OF PARIS.
MY DEAR Jones, - -
- You will doubtless, recollect how the last time that, I dined
with you we had a little talk, when the ladies had retired, about the
nuisance of one's having to turnout at ten o'clock at night to take one's
wife and daughter to a dance or an ‘At Home.’... We agreed, you will
remember, that steps ought to be taken to stop this monstrous ºustom
which is ruining our º Qur tempers, and our healths, an
which, unless it soon be checked, will probably be carried to a dangerous
excess, and tend to bring our grey hairs .# to the grave.
How right we were in nurturing these terrible forebodings, a glance at
this brief paragraph will, I think, suffice to show:—
“PARISIAN Dissipation.—A Paris letter says:—‘For the present every one here
i.ºf to the upper classes seems to be bent upon pursuing a round of dissipa-
tion too fatiguing to be sociable. The Countess PERsióNY has brought in, by giving
her last ball at midnight, a fashion in a fair way of being widely adopted, as well as
one that will make the sociability of the brilliant world more life-consuming than it
ever has been. Soirées now commence long after ten, private concerts at about
eleven, and balls at twelve. When they end may easily be inferred from the time
of their beginning. The wearing effects of such unnatural hours on the constitution
are warded off by the ladies, and, indeed, often by gentlemen, in a manner so in-
genious that it deserves to be recorded. Dinners are ordered half an hour earlier
than they are usually served, and, instead of being finished at half-past seven or
eight, are over at seven and half-past seven, so that persons of quality can go to bed
and have a long sleep before they dress to go out at midnight.’”—Globe.
There, my dear friend, is not this a truly fearful picture? Just
imagine yourself, Jones, you, who relish a fº. dinner, and, therefore,
like to take a cosy, comfortable time at it—I say, imagine yourself daily
scramblin through that meal, so as to get it over by seven or half-past,
and then hurrying off to bed in the serenity of fulness, with the cer-
§ that nightmare will afflict #. if you sleep. Then, fancy the

leisure some time in the º this point I at present cannot
undertake to prophesy, and the subject is so painful that I shrink from
giving thqught to it more than I can help. -
Meanwhile, my dear old boy, bless your stars, as I do mine, that

may have in store for us, we are at present not afflicted so severely as
we should be were we resident in Paris, and sharing the enjoyments (?)

THE CHANCELLOR'S GHOST.
Saunders' News Letter contains, a story from a “London Corre-
spondent,” which, therefore must be true. . It is stated that LoRD
WESTBURY, the Chancellor, has bought a ghost. That is to say, he
has bought Hackwood House, near Basingstoke, and in it a Woman in
Grey, who comes into his bedroom, stands against the wall, and shines
phosphorically, and is generally intrusive. The lady has, appeared to
the Chancellor himself, who, not being easily discomposed, took notes
of her behaviour, and read them after breakfast. We are rather glad
of this, because there is now a chance of a ghost-story being fairly
sifted. SIR RICHARD BETHELL, that was, is not the man to be content
with diluted evidence, or to make up his mind that he has got a ghost,
except upon full proof, cogent, enough to justify an order in Chancery.
He will either proclaim the whole affair to be a bit of correspondent’s
mendacity, or we shall have such a set of ghostly interrogatories as
have never yet been applied in a case of the supernatural. #. ghosts
have caught a Tartar at last, and we should not wonder if there were a
considerable sensation in the spirit world, and a vote of censure passed
on the venturesome ghost.

BRIGHT side of things.”

A WOMAN AND A CAT.
THEY say there is no such thing as an indisputable truth. Mr. Punch
fearlessly asserts that he has found one, and here it is.
It is better to be a Cat in Zug than a Woman in London.
A short time ago, a man in Zug stole a Cat, named ERMINE, and
having probably acquired a taste for that kind of nutriment at two-
franc restaurants during some visit to Paris, he slew Puss, and cooked
her for his dinner.
. this offence he was condemned to about nine distinct punish-
ments :-
1. He was imprisoned.
2. He was fined.
3. He was made to pay the value of the Cat.
4. He was put down in a black list. -
5. He was put for two years under the eye of the police.
6. He was forbidden to leave his own parish for four years.
7. He was ordered to receive a slight flogging.
And there were two or three other punishments, which we forget, but
a kind of Zug cat-o'-nine Tails descended on him.
A short time ago a man in London beat his wife, named ELIZABETH
HUBBARP, and dreadfully injured her eye, and she died. She was
when he beat her, and the doctor and the jury agreed in saying that she
died of fever, accelerated by disease of the heart, and the man, {º.
had tried to smuggle his wife into the grave, and to get rid of her
child who had seen her, beaten, and had been beaten himself) was
neither imprisoned, fined, put on a black list, flogged, nor otherwise
given to understand that he was a brute.
So it is better to be a Cat in Zug than a Woman in London, for very
few Zug Cats will henceforth be stolen and eaten, whereas several
London women have been beaten nearly to death since a timid doctor
and a foolish jury united to acquit MR. W. HUBBARD.

CABMEN'S INDIGNATION MEETING.
IN accordance with notice, a large, meeting of London Cabmen was
held on Friday last at the Cabman's Hall, Commercial Road. The
object of the meeting was to consider what steps should be taken to
#. the general and individual interest of the Cabmen of London,
uring the period of the International Exhibition.
The EARL of SHAFTESBURY had been invited to take the chair, but
a letter from his Lordship, excusing himself, and enclosing some tracts,
(including the celebrated Where are you Driving to ?) was read. In
the absence of the noble Earl, MR. SMout, a driver of some years
sitting, was unanimously called to the office of chairman, by loud cries
of “Jump in l’”
The Chairman said that he did not, enjoy the advantage of speaking
promiscuous which was manifestrated by the noble Earl as had been
invited, but he flattered hisself as he could come to the pint. , (Cries
of “Make it a quart/...) There was to be a great Show, which he had
heerd was called the Irrational Show at Brompton, and there would be
a vast conkus of folks from all parts, and mainly from forrin parts. He
had also heerd as there was to be the usual attempt at interferin with
the wested rights of the Cabman, which attempt he hoped the meeting
would make up its mind to drive over. He would say, no more, but
leave it to other gents to come the drydacteric. (Cheers.)
MR. GALL WINCER said that the occasion was a very interesting
one...There was a noble harvest about to be opened to the Cabman,
and if he went to work well, and had tolerable ſuck, he might make a
good thing of the X. But it behoved them to be wide awake, and like-
wise determined. He had heard of all sorts of new lists of cab fares
(hisses), yes, so they were called, though he thought a better name
would be cab fouls (laughter and cheers), and that Guides were to be
sent on to the cabstands to see that tickets were given (shame), and
that strangers knew the amount, which they could legally be called on
to pay. (Sensation.) He should like to see a fellow like that on his
stand. They mightn't agree as to a sixpence, but he'd let such an
hinterloper know º clear what a kick meant. (Applause.) As for
the waterman, he had nothing to say against him, he stood in with the
Cabman, told lies for him when he was away at the bar, and never
knew anything about, fares, or anything against cabby. But as for
Guides and spies, let them give him a wide i. What he said was,
Live and Let Live (applause), and what was sauce for goose was sauce
for gander, not, of course, that Cabmen knew much about sauce. (Cheers.)
This here X was a dodge of the swells to put money in their purses,
and why shouldn't the Cabman come in for a shareſ? Let them get
what they could out of everybody. The London folks had no call to
complain, they knew the fares, and weren't any wuss off because the
Cabman might try to make a trifle out of the Provincials and ºf:
beggars. §. he to have no hevening of life, and sit down calm under
his own tree and smoke in peace. (Sensation.) Then let the swells let
him make his A while the sun shone, and not make a shine about a few
shillings. (Loud cheers.)
MR. SPAyyin said he had read with intense disgust that SIR Richard
MAYNE had been asked to order the police to see the tickets given to
fares whether required or not... It was bad enough to have to do it at
all on compulsion, and he flattered himself that nobody ever saw him
in a hurry to obey. First he always said he was afeared he had left the
tickets at home, then he searched all his pockets five times, *.*.
fare steady in the face all the while. Then he looked in the nose ag,
and under all the cushions, and at the bottom of the cab. Once he
looked in the oss's mouth, but that time his fare happened to be an
Irish gent as gave him a such a topper to help him that he never tried
that again. Then he walked round the cab, and tried at the other door,
and need not tell his friends that if it was a rainy day, it was pleasant
for the fare by this time. But if the fare was stubborn, he got it at
last, for he, the º: kept the tickets in his hat. , (Cheers). Now
all this defensive business, as he might say, was to be done away, if SIR
Richard MAYNE was to come the arbitrary.
MR. SLASHER said that he was not much afraid of the ticket business.
Several gents present knew how that could be managed, and whether
the number on the back of the cab was always eractly that on the card,
and likewise whether, the card was writ, out quite correct in other
respects. But the public was afraid to ask for tickets, it seemed like
starting on the journey with a bad feeling. SIR. Richard MAYNE
might do as he ić but they need not care, unless there was a penalty
to an informer, and then it might, be awkward certainly. Ladies
and gents had no time to hunt a fellow down, and hang about a dirty
police court, but if an informer could do it, things would be different,
. ºped that no such harbitrary and dishonest plan would be
adopted.
MR. JoBBLE said that there ought to be a law protecting cabmen
from a great wrong, he meant from gents º: at home in their
houses in the subbubs. , (Hear, hearſ). He had lately been a wictim to
that hambush. He had drove a º, from Piccadilly to Regent's Park,
and the fare on the book was a shilling. He only charged her two
shillings, and followed her into the hall to require it, thinking of course
that in the middle of the daythere were only women in the house. Out
of a door bounced a gent who had been meanly stopping at home, and
he blowed up, took §. card, took the number, writing it down for fear
of herror, called him, the speaker, a cowardly thief for trying to impose
on helpless women, and though he, the speaker, said he was very sorry,
and . to give back sixpence, he was summonsed and fined.
(Shame!). Now he asked if it wasn't un-English, to lie in wait like
that, and trap a poor cove as was only trying to help hisself? (Cheers.)
MP. FLANKER said that they might make * their minds that a bad
time was coming. There would be some new laws soon as would make
it hardly worth a fellow's while to drive a cab. At present it was
pleasant to a fellow of spirit, as being the nearest approach to highway
robbery, like that of the good old days. But that had been put down,
and so would their freedom be. He believed the time would come when
a couple of young ladies would take a cab from Westbourne Grove tº
Whitechapel, .# not be charged a farthing over the rate. (Sensation.)
Yes he did, and therefore they had better, as another speaker said, make
their A while the sun shone.
After some other speeches, it was unanimously resolved, -
That the Cabmen of London would get as much as they possibly
could out of the British and Foreign public, ºf the Exhibition, an
would resist either peaceably or by force, as might be advisable, any
attempt to interfere with the rights of labour. - -
After a vote of thanks to Lord Shaftesbury, and after singing the
Cabman's Hymn (What though I am a Scouling Cove), the meeting
went on the rank.

A SENSATION POLICE CASE.
QN Saturday last, a gentleman who would not give his name or
address, and who sº º to feel his unfortunate position, was
brought up on the charge of having, made some unfavourable remarks
in the pit of the Adelphi Theatre, whilst the celebrated Cave Scene of
the Colleen Bawn was being performed “for the last time at present.”
MR. Dion Boucicault, who could scarcely control his indignation,
said he brought forward the matter purely on public grounds. It was
of the most vital importance to himself that no opinion, other than
favourable, should be expressed on his productions.
The MAGISTRATE ventured to inquire what was the nature of the
offence? -
MR. DION Boucicault (violently affected). Whilst I was taking my
celebrated Header the prisoner made a remark audible to the whole
house, and I nearly, from rage or nervousness, lost my balance, and
it was a positive miracle I wasn't precipitated into the Orchestra,
where I might have met with an ignominious death in the interior of a
big drum. (Great Sensation.) As it was impossible the piece could
proceed with such interruptions, I had the man removed. I have no
wish to be vindictive, Sir, but f must insist upon the very severest
penalties the law affords being enforced in this instance.
The MAGISTRATE inquired if MR. Boucicault (whom he begged
to º: on his miraculous escape, as his loss to the . never
would have been repaired, either by himself or anyone else) could prove
that there was any damage done? -
MR. BoucICAULT. No, Sir, nothing º beyond the straining
to my nerves, and a slight injury inflicted on the rope; but the dis-
respect shown—the insult, I may call it—might have the most injurious
effect upon my future works, of which I have no fewer than seventy-
two, another at present on its way from America, and another, so far
advanced, as only to require the plot to complete it—and all of which
are entirely original, being constructed with variations with the most
scrupulous fidelity, from the French dramas and Irish novels—
. The MAGIsTRATE (checking him) ventured to suggest that his ques-
tion still remained unanswered.
A FAREWELL TO THE FLEET.
BY AN OLD SALT.
Now farewell, my trim three-decker,
Sails and º and all farewell:
Iron’s proved of wood a wrecker,
Where 'twill steer us who can tell?
In glorious NELson's days, d'ye mind them,
Our tars were sailors every inch:
Stout hearts, with pigtails stout behind them,
And ne'er a man to skulk or flinch.
But now-my dear eyes! British sailors
Half soldiers and half stokers are;
And if we manned the fleet with tailors,
'Twould in a month be fit for war.
In battle now there ain't no danger,
Good seamanship is at an end:
To reefing every hand's a stranger,
For why?—no canvas now we bend.
Our ships are hearts of oak no longer,
But floating forts with iron cased:
Than Armstrong guns need be arms stronger,
Ere through our sides a shot be placed.
Bomb-proof, hull-sunk, iron-roofed, we steam on,
Nor ball nor boarder fear we now:
And when our ſoe we run abeam on,
He sinks at once beneath our prow.
Them Yankee swabs, from shot a-shrinking,
Fight under water, so they tells:
Dear eyes! our Navy soon, I’m thinking,
Will be a fleet of diving bells:
Law and Fact.
“No man can be twice punished for the same offence.”
This is a law maxim. Jones, formerly but not now a
widower, denies its truth. His only offence has been
Matrimony, and his experience, he says, negatives the
| above rule.
MR. Boucicault. Only consider, Sir, if I once were to lose the
respect of the public, what would become of mº i have reckoned
upon those pieces running up to my 87th year, and if they are suddenly
interrupted in their career, I should be the loser, Sir, perhaps of
millions. I have already made by the Colleen Baun upwards of £66,000.
Please multiply that amount by seventy-two, and you can easily con-
ceive, Sir, what my loss would be
The MAGISTRATE sincerely sympathised with him. He would like
to be informed what was meant by being original?
MR. Boucicault explained that it was an idea copied from some
one else, but improved upon a little bit by yourself, so as to enable you
to swear it was your own.
.The PRIson ER said he had merely whispered to a friend of his in the
|. that the water-scene in Colleen, Bawn had been repeatedly done
efore, and was nothing new, when he was at once seized by the collar,
dragged out of the theatre, and taken to the Station House. If he
had done any wrong, he was unfeignedly sorry for it.
PolicEMAN Q 25,478 said, he took the prisoner into custody. He
was sure he was an old offender. He saw º cracking nuts at one of
the most pathetic parts, when every one else, down to those who sold
apples, oranges and ginger beer, were all bathed in tears. He yawned,
too, once or twice, and in fact paid very little attention to what was
going on on the stage.
The MAGISTRATE said this was one of the most flagitious and heart-
rending cases that had ever been brought before him. MR. Bouci-
CAULT.deserved the thanks of the public at large for having taken the
initiative in the matter, and he would take the liberty of proposing that
a Brazen Head should be presented to Mr. B. as a festimonial. He
should be most happy to head the subscription himself with sixpence
out of the poor-box.
MR. Boucicault thanked the worthy Magistrate, and, after con:
gratulating him on his very successful “header,” of which he felt half
envious, accepted both the suggestion and the money that so grace-
fully inaugurated it.
In conclusion, the MAGISTRATE said that with regard to the unſor-

Though brothers' blazon deck the flags these adverse hosts uplift,
Though dark and dim the struggle ere in peace those flags are furled.
And with their proud and earnest dames, their gifts the planters bring
heir mules and sheaves—their hogs and beeves—the corn their
barns that fills:
Into the piled-up cotton-pens themselves the torch they’ll fling, .
Ere they shall help the Northern needs, or feed the Northern mills—
“Here’s bell-metal-cast more guns—we are wearied out at last
Qf a tie that is a ſetter on Southern souls and soil. . . . . xx
But pause on that last gift, can good come of cannon cast -
From the bells that waked the slaves to their heavy hopeless toil?
Ah, there it . —the canker that spreads from head to heel !
The leprosy that mines beneath, though with no warning smart;
The vile alloy of Slavery takes edge from Southern steel,
And Slavery's base metalties at their cannon's heart.
An ominous black shadow broods their boasts and bravery o'er,
The rattle of their arms doth seem of glanking gyves to tell:
And for all your daring against odds, still in your cannon's roar
We hear the dreary ringing of the vile Plantation Bell.
THE PULSE OF TURKEY.
It was the fashion at one time to compare Turkey to the position of
a “Sick man.” In short, we suppose, the SULTAN was no other than
the original “Habitans in Sicco.” But #"; it seems, is getting
lº round again, as every fat, contented Pasha properly should be.
n time, perhaps, she may actually get a constitution of her own, not so
robust perhaps as that of England, but infinitely stronger than that of
Spain. We beg to congratulate Turkey upon her change, which is
certainly one for the better, considering the lot of English money
which has recently been introduced into the country. . Judging from
the Turkish Loan, her circulation must have wonderfully improved.
Never dii Turkeyboast of a healthier ulse. So much the better—it

SINCE the celebrated article in the Norfolk Biffin (or whatever was
the name of the distinguished journal), which took credit to, itself for
having compelled the House of Lords to pass the Reform Bill, we have
not seen a neater thing, in better English, than this, which appeared in
MR. BRIGHT's organ of Saturday:-
“The opinions expressed in the Morning Star and Dial on Thursday last, as to the
necessity of some limit being imperatively fixed for the reception of goods, has at
length attracted the attention of the Commissioners, and an official notice has been
issued that “they will cancel all allotments of space for goods,' &c.”
We had fears for the health of these Commissioners, who seem to
have a good deal to do; but if they have leisure to study the Star, they
are not so much to be pitied—at least on account of over-work. . . .

THE BORE OF A BREWING LICENCE,
MR. GLADSTONE tells the House of Commons that:—
“The proposal of the Government with regard to a licence in respect of private
brewing was not announced to the House as one of great financial importance.”
Why did he propose it then; and why has he insisted on it? His
anSWer 18:-
“What I said to the House was, we are going to require from brewers for sale a
payment in hard cash for every pound of hops they are estimated to use, and we
cannot fairly make that demand upon them if we give to persons who choose to
brew in private a positive premium by telling them that they shall have their hops
free of duty without any payment at all.”
If the private brewing-licence is not one of great financial importance,
the liberty of unlicensed brewing would have been no great premium
given to private brewers. It would therefore have involved, no great
unfairness to brewers for sale. The private brewing-licence is a nomi-
mal tax, and will prove a source of nominal revenue. MR. GLADSTONE
proposed it, and insists upon it, merely out of abstract tº. to fiscal
symmetry. This is a cheering indication. If he cannot bear the idea
of a theoretical I. in the º: of the brewing-licence, how
will he any longer be able to stand the fact of an enormous practical
injustice in the incidence of the Income-Tax? MR. GLADSTONE is evi.
§ ready to adopt the proposals of MR. HUBBARD, or to produce
etter.
The sums to be jº. for the private brewing-licences are so small
that their amount will be of no great fiscal importance. The private
brewing licence will be therefore simply a bore to those who will be
under the necessity of procuring one, but who will, many of them,
forget to observe that P. and consequently expose themselves
to the depredations of informers. It will be necessary to take the
trouble of going and getting a licence in order to try the experiment of
making a little beer! The effect of the law imposing the purchase of a
licence on the private brewer will be that of entangling individuals in
liability to penalties, without at all profiting the public, or even the
public-house.
We will not impute to MR. GLADSTONE the atrocious design of
putting a stop to private }. and checking instead of encouraging
the production of home-brewed beer. But he has, in mere pedantry,
imposed one more restraint . his own showing, on the
liberty of the subject; and liberty, especially in the matter of beer, is
better than licence.
DEPLORABLE PREJUDICE.
“MR. PUNCH, -
“AN article in the Post upon the late trial of three unfor-
.gentlemen for forging Russian bank notes, contains the following
remark :-
“The prisoners convicted on the first day's trial were Woolff HARwitz, calling
himself a doctor, and CHLoMAN REIchberg, and ABRAHAM Josephson, jewellers—
all the three being Jews, of course.”
“Why of course? GENERAL Wolfe was not a Jew, and there are
many people besides Jews who are called HARWITz or HARRIs.
CHLOMAN is not equivalent to Clo’man, neither is it a corruption of
SoLOMON, like SLOMAN, and REICHBERG is no more Hebrew than
REIchENBAch, a name celebrated as that of the discoverer of the Od
force, and not odious through any association with clo', for it has before
it the Christian name of CHARLEs ; but even if the distinguished chemist
had been named CHLOMAN, the abbreviation, CHLo, would only have
suggested chloroform. There are plenty of Christian Isaacsons and
Josephsons, and of Christians who are named ABRAHAM ; as, for
example, ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Why, then, all three Jews, of course?
Because one was a quack-doctor, and another a jeweller, and a third
an accomplice with the other two in a forgery? These appear to be
ºonly premises which led to that conclusion. Such illiberality is too
a01.

IL PIO NONO.
WHAT operatic people those foreigners are Ac-
cording to a telegram from Rome on Easter Sunday:—
“The Pope gave a solemn benediction (urbi et orbi) in the Vati-
can to-day.
‘. The whole of the French and Pontifical troops were present.
''. An immense crowd assembled, and shouts were raised of
‘Viva il Papa '"
The scene thus described seems exactly like something
that we have often witnessed at Drury }. or Covent
Garden, or, HER MAJESTY's Theatre. We imagine the
French and Pontifical troops under arms, represented
by a corps of supernumeraries, with some of the chorus-
singers of the establishment in the front rank, whilst
the rest are stationed at the head of other supernumer-
aries who constitute the crowd; the double chorus
singing at the top of their voices Viva il Papa! to the
accompaniment of a noisy orchestra. Then, before Qur
mind's eye out in a balcony comes the old Pope in full
costume, accompanied by Cardinals, Officers, Guards, a
Crossbearer, and other attendants. Then the chorus of
soldiers and citizens leave off singing, and the Pontiff,
stretching out, his hands, opens his mouth to its utmost
width, and delivers in a deep bass recitative a few words
which we are unable to catch. Whereupon immediately
the mob and the military again strike up Viva il Papa?
and the supers who are not musical wave their hats, or
throw up their caps; all forming altogether a grand
tableau on which down comes the act-drop.
There, however, the resemblance ends. What would
complete it is the applause of the British Public; but
that is ...; There are hisses instead. The Pope
may keep the keys of a certain place, but here his own
erformance would be unsuccessful, join BULI,
19wever, would willingly shout Wira il Papa / too if his
Holiness of Rome would confer a real benediction urbº
et orbi, by resigning his temporal dominion over the
former, and leaving the latter to perform its revolutions
in peace.

THE following advertisements appeared in the same day's paper of
the Times:–
WERTÉ !—WRITE me, either here or to K. C. Tell me where, when
I can see thee. The same ever.—C. F.
It is a curious sign of the degenerate age we live in when a person is
obliged to advertise for the Truth. There are many more despairing
individuals, who, like C. F., would like to be told when, and where
they could see la Vérité. We wonder how many answers this º
lover received to his advertisement However, we have one bit of
consolation for him. C. F. is so very anxious to see the Truth, why
doesn’t he look in the pages of Punch every week?
The second advertisement tells the truth at once:—
MR MARSH, 175, Piccadilly, requests the UMBRELLA may be
RETURNED, which was taken, in mistake, from his hair-cutting establish-
ment, by a gentleman, on April 19.
The above may be cited as a proof of the old caution that it is not
advisable to speak the truth at all times. Was, it discreet of MR.
MARSH to let the public into the secret that gentlemen were in the
habit of taking away umbrellas from his establishment, even “in mis-
take?” We should be rather timid in such a place, lest whilst our
hair was being cut off by one of the oily operators, our parapluie might
be similarly treated behind our back by some other operator not less oily
and cutting in his actions. Besides, there is an absurd hopelessness in
the appeal. We know there are strange, punctilious persons who occa-
sionally send, “Conscience-Money” to the CHANGELloR QF THE

so far as to return an umbrella? The latter must have, a sharp point
to it indeed to prick any one to that extent. A child may be clever

pared to that of an umbrella that knows its own owner P
A COCK THAT DIED GAME.
At the Paris International Exhibition of poultry, our farm-wives
will be delighted to hear that the finest cocks and hens came from
England. ſº. the former there was one of the game breed, who
(we are quoting from the Morning Star)—
“Was lº to be a perfect nonpareil. But hearing his neighbours crow
continually, irritated him to such a degree that he killed himself, trying to break
the bars of his cage, and get out to fight them.”
He must have been playing at the old game of French and English,
As an Englishman in former days fancied he could thrash any three
Frenchmen easily, so †† may be sure that this cock, who was evidently
one of the old school, had been brought up with similar prejudices.
Spurred on by ambition, he was anxious to prove that he was game to
fight any number of French cocks—even including the celebrated Coq
Gaulois himself, if he would but come up to the scratch. His pluck,
being bigger than his body, was clearly the death of him. He was the
bravest of the brave, bar none. It was reported that this fine spirited
martyr of the gallinaceous tribe had been bred by SIR RoRERT PEEL,
who plumed himself considerably, it was said, upon its plucky propen-
sities. In our †. this pugnacious rooster is much more likely to
have been contributed by MR. join Bright. By the bye, the most
†† place for this exhibition of poultry would have been the
neighbouring village of Pecq.

APPEARANCE–All appearance finer than what you would sport if
you were Robinson Crusoe, with no Friday,for a spectator, is not,
perhaps, mere ostentation. Other motives than vanity may induce a
man to keep up a prºposterous or extravagant appearance; for he may
be a kind husband, and loth to, grieve his wife. Or, although single,
he may have to get his living by customers, clients, or patients, who
are attracted by splendour as moths are allured by a candle. ific
were to reduce his appearance to reasonable plainness, they would think
his business was decreasing, and accordingly forsake him; for most
people are apt to be quick in getting out of the way of anybody who seems
going to the dogs. , Many a poor and prudent person, whose calling, is
genteel, is obliged to maintain a corresponding appearance, ºij,
subjects him to be surcharged for Income-Tax; Édº. if it were as
shabby as it ought to be, he would earn no income at all.
Be sure to cultivate a professional appearance if you are a prac-
tising member of any profession, unless you want to get rid of your
practice. Particularly observe this rule if your profession is the medi-
cal, and, for example, do not go about in a shooting-jacket and a cap
or a wide-awake; for people employ you not so much for you to cure
them as to worship them, and they will be offended with your appear-
ance if they imagine it to show unconcern about their opinion amount-
ing to unconsciousness of dependence on their favour.
An excessively sumptuous appearance is not always so necessary for
purposes of business as people who are fond of display persuade them-
selves that it is. Beware of outshining those whom you wish to con-
ciliate, for they will either account for your magnificence by supposing
that you are very rich, and then they will envy you, and, what is worse,
perhaps want you to lend them money; or if they know that you are
not rich, they will impute your display to vanity and folly, and, if the
are, nettled by the superiority of your style to their own they will
perhaps also regard it as the expression of insolence, which they will
resent.

view to cheapness and convenience, regardless of every other consider-
ation. His clothes will last him as long as they are comfortable, and,
for some considerable time before they are worn out, will give him an

an appearance as fine as you can afford. But women really do not

A MART FOR ART.
JUST opposite
the Great Ex-
hibition certain
enterprising per-
sons have estab-
lished a smaller
one. It is called
the International
Bazaar, and is
intended, we un-
derstand, as a
place - where,
when a person
has seen any-
thing in the Big
Show that he
would like to
buy, he may go and perform that feat, as the Bazaar is to contain its own
specimens of all portable productions. We intend to buy an Armstrong
Gun, a locomotive, a ring of church bells, and a Shoeburyness target, the
yery first day, as little presents for young lady friends. We think the
Bazaar notion a very good one, and perfectly in keeping with the legiti-
mate objects of the Great Show, and the place is fitted up, by a French
decorative artist, in a very elegant fashion. Mr. Punch's own smoking
saloon is not much more tastefully adorned with flags and banners. But
why do not the promoters of the Bazaar complete the rivalry, issue a
proclamation (we’ll lend them a Lindley Murray), and have an inaugura-
tion, anode, and a procession? Mr. Funch would run over and take a
part in the proceedings, and would write to MR. Tupper to do a poem
at the shortest notice. Then we would have it set, and get up a little
quarrel on the subject, and HERR Von JoEL, who might be engaged
(with his whistling batton) to conduct, might refuse to conduct one of the
polkas, and the manager would have to engage somebody else, for the
purpose. MR, SPURGEON might come over and enact the Archbishop,
and though Brompton might find it as difficult to find a second DUKE
of CAMBRIDGE as Lambeth does to find a second W. WILLIAMs, the
thing is not impossible. We hear that the refreshment department at
the Bazaar is to be managed in capital style, and this is wise—men's
hearts open, and so do their purses, as wives know, after a gºod lunch,
and we would bet that most purchases are made after one o'clock. We
have no idea whether the Bazaar notion originated in a freak, but the
º itself is an extremely sensible one, and Punch hereby crowns it
with success.
THE CRY FOR CONSERVATIVES,
THE Tories once, as well is known,
Stood by the Altar and the Throne; ...
In point of Church their views were High :
But their principle was evermore “No Topcry
When Catholics, with rights denied,
Had reason clearly on their side,
The Tories, till their throats were dry,
Were accustomed to vociferate, “No Popery' "
But now that common cause unites
The Papists and the Derbyites:
'Tis time for Punch to raise the cry
Of Lord PALMenston for ever and “No Popery 1”
THE IRON AGE AFLOAT.
THERE seems very little doubt that steam and iron will between
them turn the sailors of our Navy into stokers, and sea-soldiers, and
cffect, a revolution in the commonest naval matters. If the Merrimac
and Monitor be taken, as our models, our fleet will soon consist of
mastless iron ships, and anything like seamanship of course will not be
necded in them. The duties of a sailor on board a ship of war will
be confined to work between decks, such as cleaning out the stoke hole
and keeping a good fire up. He will no more be roused out to reef
topsails, for there will be none to reef; nor will he ever have to .
aloft and hang on by his eyelids, as, if we credit the sea-novelists, he
used formerly to do.
Besides, when ships are without masts, of course the men on board
of them can no more be mastheaded, and martinets will have to turn
their minds to hit upon some other form of punishment. Funnel.
heading would perhaps be a fit thing to introduce, and men might be
sent up to sit upon the chimney-top until they were well smoked. We
can fancy what a picture a young middy would present, after dangling
his legs upon the funnel for an hour or two. Even if he had the fortune
to escape suffocation, he would very certainly be soon as black in the
face as though he had been choked. On the whole we think that
chimney;potting, as it might be called, would be quite as efficacious
and unpleasant as mastheading, and the middies will no doubt much
thank us for suggesting it.
A SNUFFLE FROM A SAINT.
To the Editor of the “Record.”
. “WERILY, my dear friend, we live in dreadful times. Calamity and
innovation (words to my mind quite synonymous) attack us on all sides.
One wonders what new danger to the State will next afflict us. Why
here the theatres have actually been opened during Passion Week and
yet we still continue to be ... a Christian nation | Painful to relate,
with, your own pious exception, the Press have not rotested, but
mºstly have applauded this new act of iniquity. Hear, however, what
a Bishop—he of Oxford—has to say of it –
“The present was an instance of the manner in which great evils were continually
§eeping ºn. The intrºduction of the concert was now the plea for opening the
theatres altogether, and, now that the other days of Passion Week were given up,
the next step would be to give up Good Friday. This was the way in which all
reverence for holy seasons was swallowed up among us.”
'. Swallowed up! yes alas! We well know who it is that prome.
nades about the country like a devouring lion, and now that he has
swallowed up our reverence for Passion Week, there really is no saying
what he next will make a meal of Good Friday will of course next year
be “given up” to him, and in the course of a brief time there will be no
such thing as Sunday. Playhouses will be open day and might through-
out the year, and, these vile dens of iniquity will cre long become so
numerous, that churches, chapels, and cathédrals will be pulled down
19 make room for them. Playgoers may allege that hearing
SHAKSPEARE is as morally improving to a man as seeing people ris
their necks on the trapeze, or indulging in a beery dance at a Casino.
Such resorts as these were until this year the only public pleasures
during Passion Week, that is to say for people who were resident in
London, for out,9f it, the theatres were suffered to be open, being
licensed by the Magistrates and not, by the Lond CHAMBERTAIN, in
whºse keeping are the morals of all dwellers in Cockaigne. But a
Bishop must of course know better than a playgoer what goes on at a
theatre, and how much less, moral harm is done by Virtuous Casinos
than by Vicious Comedies like those which ShakspeaRE wrote.
"Sir, I never go to theatres, and as the closing of them cannot in
the least, affect my comfort, I am strongly of opinion that at Christmas
time and Easter, and all other, holy seasons, their doors ought to be
kept shut. Depend on it if playhouses are open during Passion Week,
something dreadful to the nation will happen before long. I leave to
DR. CUMMING to foretell what it will be, º: I really quite expect to
live to see the time when our holy seasons will be º so irreverently
that we shall no longer enjoy a Christmas pudding or a hot-cross bun.

COSTUMES OF FEMALE NATIVES.
JAPAN has sqme name for polish, and its credit in that respect
Appears to have been well sustained by the Japanese Ambassadors in
l'aris, to whºse good taste the correspondent of the Post at that capital
bears the following testimony:—
“They consider the ordinary Parisian modes a wicked and painful artifice for
ºleforming female loveliness, and think it would be a considerable improvement if
the EMPERon NapoleoN would issue a proclamation that no Crinoline should be
bought. , Qne or two of the suite have bought specimens of these “cage 'abomina.
tions to take home as a specimen of the eccentricities of European civilisation.”
And, so the detestable cages which depraved vanity has invented to
conceal three-quarters of a woman's figure under a scaffolding for
drapery will be taken to Jeddo, and there no doubt exhibited at the
Japanese Museum, if there is such an institution at that capital, just
as the barbarqus trappings and accoutrements of Red Indians, Southsea
Islanders, and other savages, are shown at our own, British. But the
Japanese Ambassadors are coming over here, and what will they think
of our position in the scale of humanity, when they find that the women
of England have also the bad taste to screen their fair proportions with
a mechanism of steel ? Qf course they will look upon the natives of
this island as a race still more degraded than the neighbours from
whom our most fashionable ladies haye borrowed a barbarism. ...Ac.
customed as they are to regard “Happy Despatch” as a civilised
institution, they will surely wonder that we do not adopt that practice,
inasmuch as, in tolerating the cages of our wives and daughters, we
suffer female grace to commit suicide.
“THE WoRI.D's FAIR.”—It’s not true (says a confirmed cynic), for
generally speaking the world's extremely unfair.

HOW TO CHRISTEN OUR IRONSIDES.
THE reconstruction of the British Navy will require a change of its
nomenclature. Qur oak Leviathans are now to be replaced with iron
monsters of the deep. Plated, as it were, with a skin of armour, a man-
of-war will henceforth resemble, a pachydermatous or a crustaceous
animal. For a ship of the line, therefore, the proper sort of name will
be that of the Rhinoceros or the Elephant, or, wº would be still better,
the Whale, a whale being a marine pachyderm; and a steam-ram might
be named the Narwhal, as the creature so called, otherwise the Sea
Unicorn, is not only a whale, but is armed with a horn *...i
to the beak which steam-rams are to carry at the bows. Frigates an
smaller vessels could go under the denomination of the Hippopotamus,
the #. the gº." the Hog-in-Armour, the Armadillo, or even
the crº and the Lobster. Another, view, to be sure, may perhaps be
taken of the style of name which will be that most appropriate to our
new Ironsides. It may be urged with some reason, that they would be
best denominated by such titles as the Lambkin, the Dope, and the
Olive, which denote emblems, of Peace, and may, it is to be hoped, be
applicable to our iron fleet otherwise than ironically.
Sumptuary Regulation.
THE Commissioners of the International Exhibition have revoked
their first regulation, and have now decided that all salads and, mayon-
naises may be allowed the §: of admission into the Exhibition
without being previously full-dressed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPENING OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
MR. PUNch’s CHORALE, (unaccountably declined by the Commissioners, in favour of the Poet Laureate's very much inferior Ode).
I.-THE JAM OUTSIDE.
WIDEN the streets! Policemen A to X,
Bid the obstructive multitudes move on;
Norye, oh season-ticket-holders, vex .
Commissioners, who have bare time to
Oil
Their suits of Court, and the dress-sword, that
ecks
Each portly side, and now hits sharp upon
Silk-stockinged legs, now hath betwixt them
gone—
As swords unwonted wearers will perplex-
Lo! the procession waits—and Cole must
walk A one.
II.--THE CLEARING OF THE NAVE.
Clear from out the cumbered Nave,
Box and barrel, spar and stave,
Spite of all that workmen pray,
Or exhibitors essay,
Britishers who growl and swear,
Foreigners who rend the hair–
They had time their work to press
To completion and success,
ſº to bedeck and rear,
In their various ugliness,
Show-cases to glaze and dress–
Bare boards to bid disappear,
Under varnish and veneer,
Flatting white, or colour queer-
If they would not, could not do
What our orders bade them to,
They the consequence must take—
Clear the Nave, a road to make
III.--THE PROCESSION.
Lo! The great procession comes
To the sound of trumps and drums'
Lo! the Pageant's foremost actors,
Sup’rintendents of Contractors'
Sup’rintendents, too, of works,
W hom their court dress sorely irks)
chitect-great CAPTAIN Fow KE,
Fain “till jaw gae by ” he º: " )
rowned with his own dome in little,
Like inverted semi-skittle
Or the frame wherewith his greens
The careful market-gardener screens,
As if the plan that makes cucumbers swell
Would suit the fruits of industry as well.
With him Contractors KELK and LUCAS pace,
With him the daring decorator, CRACE,
'Twas his to make with polychromic skill
What first was ugly uglier still. -
For his queer building FowkE had claimed
the crown, -
But CRACE arose, and colouring, with a frown,
“The crown be mine,” said he, “for placing
ere
On Fowke's queer lines a colour yet more
queer.”
Till the Commissioners the strife bade cease,
And honoured CRACE and FowkE with half-a-
crown apiece. -
Lo! Doomed to quarrels, grumblings and es-
trangements,
Here come the Sup’rintendents of Arrange-
ments'—
And, niched 'twixt these, and Provosts and
Lord Mayors,
—The Laurel green above his flowing hairs—
Our TENNYSON his blooming honours wears!
Uneasily, from side to side,
The Poet's glances stealthy glide-
Watch him, oh closely watch—or, he'll bolt up
the stairs |
And now, a pause, until the acclamations
That greet the Muse's latest, best-loved,
son,
Unto this gathering of the toil of nations,
Their course of long reverberant peals have
run;
And while we pause, let the Macebearer by,
And eke the civic Sword held high,
The Sheriffs, and the Councils of Societies,
In all their polysyllabled varieties,
The Deputation of ten Guarantors,
Upon whose I O Us, like concrete floors,
Are reared these miles of iron, hills of brick,-
A monster monument to British Tick!
Special Commissioners and Juries' Chairmen-
And these, a crowd of tall, short, black and fair
men,
Commissioners for every realm and race
That boasts a consul or has asked for space;
Commissioners for Eighteen-fifty-one,
That saw the Hyde Park Crystal Palace
rise,
Like fairy palace sparkling to the sun
Before the world's entranced and wondering
eyes—
Say, are they here to contrast, or commend,
This road so different, to the self-same end—
Industry with her wonders here again,
But lodged as basely now, as she was nobly
then P
And Lo! a vacant space—
SIR Joseph PAXTON's place–
The brain whence, fused in quick inventions
glow
The Cºstaſ Palace sprang, all diamond-clear—
iike Biºgrus statue at the CESAR’s show,
Seen all the more, because he is not here.
Now trumpets shrill your piercingest too-too,
Doº oh drums' your rattling row-de-
OW-
Lo, the Commissioners of Sixty-two
3dvance the shapely leg, and bend the
blushing brow!
And hark! above the shattering trumpets blare,
Above the drum's sonorous roll,
A shout that stills the reverential air—
The mighty name of Cole !
The Cole that light on all things throws—
The CoIE, whom poking cannot break or
bend—
The Cole, whose undeveloped mcasures,
Subserve alike our business and our pleasures—
The Cole, that on and on and on still goes,
And never seems to come to his Walls’ end
Who after Cole, has eyes to condescend,
On Bishops, Ministers or Lords,
Or can to Royal personages bend,
Or gentlemen attending on the same,
Or, spite of breast-plates, helms and swords,
Štºop to dismounted Guards in scarlet coats
of flame *
IV.--THE MUSIC IN THE ORCHESTRA.
Now lift the pealing hymn of praise,
From brass, and wood, and string,
And let the loud orchestra raise
Two thousand throats to sing–
Though WERDI was too late,
The theme to celebrate,
And costive Costa should disdain to ply
The bºon unto BENNETT's melody.—
And what should be our song,
These crowded works of industry among,
But “Welcome white-robed Peace, to this our
º: throng” ”
Where lingers she—themeck-eyed gentlequeen-
Soft-floating, in her robe of olive-green,
The doves that drawier car, with downy wing
The noiseless air dividing;
With happy Hours, for harbingers, to fling
Lush May-flowers on the path where she comes
riding P
We cannot see her in the air,
Nor hear her at the door,
Nor smell the breath of May-flowers fair,
That strew her pathway o'er.
V-THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE.
Perhaps ye look too high—
Look down, with humbled eye :
And see, from out yon trophy tall
That lifteth an ºli wall,
All rayed with tubes and blades of war,
And many a radiant bayonet-star,
Rolleth a mighty Armstrong gun-
Whereon, as on a car of state,
Disconsolately sitteth one,
ad as a bird without her mate: .
'Tis Peace, ". queen, thus fain to ride
Upon Bellona's iron car, .
Herºdoves reluctant waved aside,
Her happy herald Hours,
{}. of their flowers,
Left weeping mournfully, forlorn and far:
Sadly and strangely º she,
On us who strangely gaze on her—
“And is this Peace—can it be she,
That sets this monster gun astir '''
“Yes, I am Peace and woe is me,
That this my vehicle should be.
Ten }. have past, since first ye reared
A hallowed temple in my name,
And at its altar I appeared,
And men to do me homage came.
Since then, in East or Western world,
The war-flags have not once been furled,
Across the Atlantic now they float,
Where brother's hand's at brother's throat,
And here, in Europe, nations arm,
In sullen, dim, unshaped alarm ;
The huge steam-hammers rise and fall,
To forge the great ship's armour-wall,
The workshops ring with eager toil,
The cannon grows of welded coil;
The shell, the fuse, the riſle—these
The produce of men's industries :
And I, invited here to-day,
Reluctantly at home must stay,
Or change seats, from my dove-drawn car’s,
For this, politely lent by Mars' "

ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.
MR. PUNCH is loth to criticise men who, like himself, work hard
to please the Universe; and he is very well aware that the gentlemen
who have the charge of the World's Show, have had a world to do, and
that their attempts to please the world, although proverbially im-
ossible, have in most cases proved successful. Anyone who saw
inside the Show a fortnight since could have scarcely thought that such
a Chaos of confusion could in a dozen working days, be brought to
anything like order; but this has been achieved by the hearty i. and
handiwork of every one concerned, from that zealousest of secretaries,
Mr. F. R. SANDFORD, down to the smallest of the small boys who have
run about on errands, or have stood upon their tiptoes to hand the
working-men their tools.
But, while extending thus his}; to all who have had anything
to do with the great work, Mr. Punch must be permitted to }. a
little laugh at the persons who º: the programme of the Opening.
Mr. Punch feels sure that, from the vagueness of the language whi i
is there employed, very many of the spectators will be grievously mis-
led by it. For instance, though it is expressly stated that “all persons
in the procession will be in Official, Academical, or Court Dress, or
tjniform,” not a syllable is said as to who will be in which ; and
Mr. Punch feels sure that every lady will agree with him that this is a
most interesting and, important point. Of course the ladies will be
anxious, if the #. are not, to know the difference between
official, court, and academical costume; and the most absurd mistakes
will happen if some, guide to recognition be not somehow pointed
out. Again, although the various processionists are in the programme
specially numbered and divided into groups, who, pray, is to tell
Number Six from Number Seven: or Number Fifteen, the Chairmen
the Juries, from HER MAJESTY's Ministers, who are Number Twenty:
three? Ífith. too late to devise some change of dress which would
make recognition easy, Mr. Punch would just suggest that a dozen of
policemen should be armed with bits of chalk, to mark on every
person's back the number in the programme whereto he belongs,
which extremely simple method would at least prevent young ladies

A PARODY which IT Is REQUESTED MAY NOT occuR To

pleasure house, also known as the International
Ethibition. After four hundred and ninety-
seven verses comes the last.)
But Cole, C.B., replied, “”Tis long, your story,

Moreover, how many of the thirty thousand visitors expected can
be counted on as knowing MR. TENNYSoN by sight; and is it not
Fºl. that when the programme tells them to behold the Poet
aureate, their eyes will by sheer instinct look for Mr. Punch * Then,
too, how on earth is No. 25, the “Royal Personages,” to be distin-
guished by spectators from No. 26, consisting of the “gentlemen who
are in attendance” on them To know at sight a Royal person from a
gentleman, is what we hope not many eyes are competent to do; and
as loyal minds must shrink from entertaining the idea, that Royal
persons are no gentlemen, the labour of distinction will be difficult
enough. Royal persons, such for instance as the King of the Cannibal
Islands, may be recognised perhaps by their peculiar costume; but
unless they wear their crowns, or are labelled on the back, more
civilised “Royal Personages” may pass along unnoticed, or be mistaken
for the commonest of commoners in the crowd. -
Perhaps, however, the most puzzling of all the day's proceedings(worse
even than the labour of catching the eye of your own footman, in the
flock of powdered gentlemen in waiting at the doors) will be, the pro-
blem of explaining to the fair creature in crinoline whom your bliss is to
escort, the real meaning of the words “Foreign Acting Commissioners,”
which are set against the numbers 17 and 18. Of course, the only
acting she knows anything about is that which takes place on the *i.

Acting Commissioner for France, while my LoRD DUNDREARY, she
will think the proper }. to be “acting” for the States, and MR.

Amiable Excuses.
We don't think that STERNIALE BENNETT has a right to complain
that MR. Costa, will not conduct him, at the Inauguration. . Costa
sometimes does not even know how to conduct himself. Besides, he
perhaps wanted to show, by making the exception, that he was not an
omnibus conductor—in spite of what might have been inferred, from
his manners touching this matter.

ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC DURING THE INTERNATIONAL
ExHIBITION.
OME additional direc-
tions have been just
issued to the Public by
the Commissioners, and
it is hoped that the
will be understood an
observed:--
1. The Public is to
walk up and down, but
not run against itself,
that is, when some are
going one way an
some another, they are
not to go both ways at
once, but any person
is to be at liberty to
o anywhere he pleases
#. to the orders
of the police) if there
is nobody else in the
way.
2. No
= make rude, remarks,
# in the building, about
the trophies in the
Nave, which are all
very beautiful, and if
the public does not
fº this, it is because they have not taken, a catholic view of
the Exhibition. But people may say what they like to one another
after they have got home. - -- - - -
3. Persons, especially the young, are not to come to this building, in
an undisciplined state of mind, but for two hours, at least, before leaving
their homes, are to peruse, improving works, upon the subjects illus-
trated in the Exhibition. The police have orders to remove any young
persons who may evidently have come for the sake of flirtation.
4. The public is not to go staring at things merely because they are
pretty, or celebrated, but is to É. regularly and reverentially through
the whole building, and is specially to make itself master of every part
of the Machinery Exhibition before venturing to examine the products
of machinery. The public will be directed in this matter by the police,
all of whom have been properly educated for the purpose.
5. Any person who makes a remark upon the difference between the
building .# and the present one, and does not distinctly declare
the latter to be immeasurably the superior, is to be immediately removed
by the police.
6. §. whatever is to be said about the Crystal Palace, and any
rson who shall propose to go from South Kensington, to the Crystal
alace shall, forfeit his season ticket, if he has one, and if not, shall be
at once conducted Qutside the building. -
No mention is to be made of any supposed difficulty between
certain musical persons. It is enough for the public to know that the
Commissioners permitted M. Costa to dictate his own terms as to the
composers whose works he would conduct, and that everything, has
been done properly. Infringement of this order will be followed by
immediate exclusion.
8. The public is permitted to refresh itself in moderation at both the
French and English restaurants, but as the International Exhibition is
al #: for business and for instruction, persons, are not to talk of
“ſunch,” far less of “dinner,”, as a feature in the visit. Any such
dº from the principles of high art will be noticed by the police.
. The public is informed that the International Exhibition is a
nd success, and the noblest thing ever heard of. The police have
instructions to enforce the universal acknowledgment of this sentiment.

THE INNOCENCE OF A BANKRUPTCY COMMISSIONER,
In a recent trial before CoMMIssionER FANE, the following elegant
conversation is reported to have taken place:–
“The CoMMIssionER. What †. mean by “duplicates?'
“Witness. The bankrupt called them duplicates.
“The CoMMIssion ER. He talks gibberish, and you talk gibberish.
“MR. THACKRAH. The duplicates were pawn-tickets.”
Is it not most charming to hear a Commissioner of Bankruptcy in-
º what is the meaning of a “duplicate?” ...One would imagine
that FANE had been sitting in a commercial Arcadia all his life, full of
flowers and sunny purity, in which the only bills seen were those of love
birds, and the only notes exchanged were those that were heard issuing
from their pretty throats. Who would expect such a Paradise of sim.
º in Basinghall, Street? Decidedly, CoMMIssionER FANE must
e a young man who has just come up from the country. For childish
j|ingenuousness, we should say it would be extremely difficult to find his
#!". anywhere; though, when found, we doubt if any one would
feel inclined, in spite of its exceeding value owing to the rarity of the
article, to make the smallest advance upon it. The next sentence
somewhat rubs the bloom off this flowery prettiness. It brings us up
by a sudden jerk from the pensive quietude of the country to the dis.
tracting turmoil of town. escarcely expected a man, who had been
dealing with bankrupts all his life, and didn’t know what “a duplicate”
was, to make use of such a term as “gibberish.”
To say the least, it is extremely low and vestry-like, and is about the
last flower of speech that we should have thought had been gathered
in the poetical garden, that CoMMIssionER FANE has evidently been
roaming in ever since he was promoted to the Bench, Again, we were
disappointed at his not inquiring what a “pawn-ticket” was. Is the
difference between a duplicate and a pawn-ticket so very great, that a
judge can be ignorant of the one, and #. be acquainted with the other?
We will not accuse. CoMMIssionER FANE, as he did the witness, of
talking “gibberish,” because we know, from the character of the
Bankruptcy Court, it is only natural to meet there (as the London
Gazette proves to us) nothing but “broken English.”
OUT WITH RUSSELL.
(From the “New York Herald.”)
RELEASED, thanks to the manly and noble conduct of PRESIDENT
LINGOLN, ſrom the humiliating presence of Russell, the British
Aristocracy's spy, we venture to predict that the Star of the Republic
will be once more in the ascendant, and that we shall have to record an
interminable series of glorious victories for the Union flag. It was
impossible for our brave generals, children of the People, to do their
duty under the cold chill of the Aristocratic º: and it may easily be
imagined that the pen which had chronicled the deeds of lords, and earls,
and baronets, and the rest of the titled herd in the Crimea and India,
turned *. to describe the feats of arms of a hero who, before
seeking the bubble reputation in the cannon's mouth, had frothed beer
into bubbles for his compatriots. But Russell is gone, and the bird
of freedom soars triumphant on exulting wings. We are in a condition
to state that New York may prepare itself to be delirious with joy, for
we have the permission of MR. STANTON, our unequalled Secretary at
War, to say that the armies of the North have just gained nine great
Victories. At least 175,000 rebels have been sacrificed upon the altar
of offended Wengeance, and we have taken 215,633 prisoners, and
twelve trains of Armstrong guns, sent out to the rebels by sympa;
thising aristocrats in Belgravia. The heroid Mºfeſſiºn has stormed
Yorktown, and will sup in Richmond at five-and-twenty minutes to
nine on Monday."New Orleans has long been in the hands of BURN-
sIDE, but the news was * in compliment to the gallant
Princes of that House who have thrown in their lot with us;, the
Mississippi is on fire from Memphis to Bâton Rouge, and the whole
of the negroes have joined the Army of the North. Now what does
the “ ††. Willain” say? Now what says MAssa GREELEY P Now
what are the base º of the fiendly BEECHER} . These are
some of the fruits of the brave conduct of the President in expelling
the Aristocrat spy, and there are more in rapid progress. The entire
rebellion will be extinct on Wednesday fortnight, and we shall then
have ample leisure to consider whether Canada or Cuba, or both, shall
be annexed in the Fall.

THE TOXICOLOGY OF SHAKSPEARE.
Of course nobody ever suspects Punch of joking, as gentlemen say
when Mr. Punch has been freading upon their corns, otherwise the
subjoined extract out of a Morning Paper, which it has been faithfully
copied from, would be set down at once as one of his facetious
inventions:–
[Advertisement.]
SHAŠ.ARE ON POISONS, anticipating the Hygeian system of
JAMEs MoRison, the Hygeist:—
“‘The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with the blood of man,
That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body;
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset,”
And curd, like eagert droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome BLOOD.'—Hamlet, Act I. s. 5.
“Issued by the British College of Health, Euston Road, London, for the Society
of Hygeists. The above sublime passage deserves to be written in letters of gold in
every city of the world.
*** Thicken. ł Sour—acid."
There can be no difficulty whatever in agreeing with the British
College of Health and the Society of Hygeists that, “the above sub-
lime passage deserves to be written in letters of gold in every city of
the world.” To be sure, most people are sufficiently well acquainted
with it to know that it occurs in the tragedy of Hamlet, and is the
Ghost's description of }. The particular poison to which it relates
they also know to be hebenon or henbane, but perhaps, nobody before
reading it as quoted in the º: advertisement, had any idea that
it ji. applicable to the medicine employed in the Hygeian
system of JAMEs MoRIsoN. It did not indeed, need a ghost come from
#. grave to tell us that pº were generally aware that MoRIsoN's
medicine is professed to be of a vegetable nature, and also that there
is such a substance as the extract of henbane or hyoscyamus, which is
poisonous, but few, if any, ever heretofore supposed that extract from
à motions' herb to be the vegetable matter out of which MoRIsoN's
Universal Vegetable Pills are made. If “SHAKSPEARE on poisons”
wrote the lines “issued by the British College of Health, for the Society
of Hygeists,” as we are told that he did, “anticipating the Hygeian
system of JAMEs MoRIsoN the Hygeist,” it would seem that, accord-
ing to the Society of Hygeists and the British College of Health; the
“juice of cursed hebenon, in a vial” and a box of MoRIson's, Pills
are yirtually the same thing; perhaps that the pills are simply the
inspissated juice of the hebenon. If this is so, the authors of the
advertisement which is the subject of these remarks, deserve great
credit for their very disinterested candour, whereunto the public is
indebted for a salutary caution which will, we trust, be posted as it
Qught to be in golden letters at least throughout every city in HER
MAJESTY's dominions. Thus forewarned the British Public would be
in no danger of drugging themselves with a “leperous distilment” cal-
culated to produce those frightful effects on the system, and especially
the circulating fluid, which are mentioned by “SHAKSPEARE on poisons,
anticipating the Hygeian system of JAMEs MoRison, the Hygeist.”

ON Wednesday last, at the Westminster Police Court, a lad, eighteen
years of age, was brought º before MR. PAYNTER, charged with

A KING WITH A STRANGE TASTE FOR MUSIC.
HERRWAGNER, the great composer, “for the future”
§ 1962), has received sharp orders from the KING OF
Axony to return home instantly. Is the King jealous
that other parts of the Continent should have so much of
the services of his Kapellmeister, and he comparatively
so little? ... He probably wishes to have, WAGNER all to
himself. Far from quarrelling with the desired monopoly,
in the cause of music we heartily rejoice at it. The royal
edict will have the effect of narrowing the evil of contami-
nating compositions. It is tantamount to a musical qua-
rantine. Travellers must not venture too near, or else they
may be infected with one of his malignant airs, which are
not so catching, perhaps, as they are lowering, leaving a
fearful sense of depression behind them. Henceforth, the
flights of The Flying Dutchman will be restricted to one
kingdom instead of half-a-dozen. ...We hope WAGNER will
be confined to Dresden all his life. Our Philharmonic
will gain from his imprisonment. It will run no further
risk of being nearly knocked on the head from another blow
of his erratic báton. However, it is but right that tourists
should be made acquainted with the above fact. If, in
their next autumnal excursions, they visit Saxony, they
will know precisely what to expect.
CLOSE ULTRAMONTANE CONGRESS.
THE following item of intelligence appears in the Tablet:
“The Papal Secretaryship of State has already received notification
of the intended arrival of 400 Bishops in Rome for the great Festival.”
At this time of day the above-quoted announcement will
be read without alarm. The mediaeval habits of Romish
bishops have been—we believe—generally discarded by their
modern successors, few of whom are now, suspected, of
wearing horsehair shirts next their skin and never having
that truly Irish linen washed: The prelates of the un-
changing Church, as they call it, now change their, un-
derclothing, however, and when the four hundred, bishops
mentioned by the Tablet meet together in Rome, there can
be no reasonable fear that they will generate a pestilence
whereof other people as well as themselves will die in the
odour of sanctity.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

: Not bad,” said PAM.
“Well, I suppose it is not bad, as you say so,” returned Mr. Punch,
laughing, “and what do you mean?”
: Don't sell a cove,” said PAM.
“Sell be hanged,” said Mr. Punch, “I never do those things.”
“Don’t you know that we met on Monday ?” said PAM.
“Bother!” said Mr. Punch.
“Fact l’” said PAM.
... BRAND ought to have reminded me,” said Mr. Punch.
“Well, you’ve lost nothing,” said PAM, “On Monday we took
some money for Civil Service Estimates, and SLANEY suggested that
one day, in the week there should be a charge for entrance to the
National Gallery.”

“Don’t stand that... There are plenty of picture collections where

“Of course. Well, we took money for the New Foreign Office and
Westminster Bridge approaches, and WHALLEY tried to knock off the
item of £500 for Catholic chaplains to gaols.”
“That would not do, of course. Why, ſiſteen per cent. of the

“Careless fellows you are. Majority ?”

“Deuced careless, I tell you, and if I go North, this year, and get

“One can't attend to everything.” - -
“No, you’re not attending to GRANVILLE's reading, for instance.
But I repeat that you ought not to be always getting yourselves beaten.
Anything else?”
“Not on Monday. On Tuesday, LAYARD told KINNAIRD. that our
Consul at Seville had been obliged to suspend Protestant Worship in
his house. We’ll have a row about that.”
“Do-for more reasons than one.” . .
“I understand, and DisRAELI is looking at us. There was the new

moved for a commission to inquire into the sale of public buildings, and
was floored by 116 to 49.” -
“There’s a good deal to be said about that, though.” .
“I dare say there is,” said PAM. “A good deal was said. I don't
care. What a lovely face that woman has, the third from the column.”
“Yes, she is a relation of mine, and thought to be like me,” said Mr.
Punch. “What did you do 3. ?” -
“Nothing worth mention-squabbles over some of the clauses in the
Metropolitan Management Bill. Sit to-night at six. Oh, here's GRANNY
at the end of his tether. Now, GEORGY, up and at 'em.” . . . .
Upon looking at the papers Mr. Punch ascertained that his friend the
PREMIER had, in his jaunty way, given a very fair account of the first
part of the Parliamentary week, and there has been nothing later which
calls for much notice. On Thursday there was a discussion on a Bill
providing a registration of births and deaths in Ireland. Mr. Punch is
occasionally written to by an infuriated Hibernian who unjustly charges
him with over-severity in regard to the Irish. Look at this bit, cut out
of the speech of MR. MAGUIRE, an editor of a leading Irish paper, and

the Mayor of and Member for the beautiful city of Cork, statio bene
ſida carinis:— -
“Mr. MAquin E said the population of Ireland would do their utmost to defeat
the measure, if the police were employed as registrars. It was true that Colos EL
Brownrico had said that the constabulary would best carry out the scheme; but
he added that it would be an auxiliary in the detection of crime. (Hear, hear.)
Would that be likely to render it popular? A Bill like the present would fill the
F. mind with, suspicion, and raise up every man of the humbler classes in
reland to defeat it if possible.”
There! What kind of pestilent savages is MR. MAGUIRE talking about?
Kaffirs, or Hottentots, or escaped Sepoys anxious to commit murder
with impunity ? No, the police-hating people are the Roman Catholic
peasantry of Ireland, sketched by one .." their own advocates, who had
not a word of condemnation for their wickedness. Don’t let Mr. Punch
be ºppelled to again, until MR. MAGUIRE's allegations have been
inct.
On Friday there was little to notice in either House. On the discus-
sion of a Bill about Dilapidations—a constant clerical grievance—the
Bishop of LINcoLN enunciated a proposition which appears to Mr.
Punch to be almost irrefragable. His Lordship said that the Bill
would not, he thought, relieve the present race of incumbents from
hardships, because, with scarcely an exception, it did not apply to them.
In the Commons, the MAyor of CoRk, who is the hero of the week
and who in fact quite makes an Exhibition of himself, brought forward
divers cases of Irish distress, and demanded public aid. SIR Robert
PEEL sought to demolish MR. MAGUIRE's case, and did so to a great
extent. Clearly, knowing what is going on among the deserving
operatives of Lancashire, we should pause before we leave them to
starve, and relieve persons who spend their money (as shown in the
debate) on masses, instead of coffins, and who shoot the landlords for
trying to i. the labourer the means of helping himself, by cultivating
improved land. The subject was “dropped.”
NOT IIALF A WORLD'S FAIR.
N consideration we
are almost inclined
to question the pro-
}. of calling the
nternational Exhi-
bition at the Brick
Palace the World's
Fair. Several essen-
tials, as they are
generally regarded,
of a Fair, are absent
therefrom. In the
first place there are
no wild beasts in it;
an omission which
in a World's Fair,
of all Fairs, is very
unsuitable. Then,
not only is there no
menagerie, but there
is no circus, and
nothing in the shape
of RICHARson's;
there is no giant, no
dwarf, no fat lady,
110 albino; nor is
there any learned
pig, or lamb with six legs; if there is any gingerbread, it is not gilt;
there are no swings nor roundabouts; there is not a dancing-booth;
there is, no greased pole to climb; no jumping in sacks; no shying
at snuff-boxes; and although some representatives of such ſº
natives as the Mongolian races have stalls in this so-styled World's
Fair, and saddlery abounds, there is no grinning through the horse-
collar; and lastly, nothing is seen or heard of that, well-known ingenious
plaything which is indispensable to the “fun of the fair.”
- – - -
THE TWO SIDES OF A “SHILLING.”
THE police authorities at Munich have compelled a coffee-house
keeper to alter the sign of his shop, which he had christened the
“CAFé ScHELLING.” They made him remove the “SchELLING,” as
they considered it derogatory to have a name so revered in literature
associated with a coffee, or beer establishment. . The Commissioners of
the International Exhibition clearly entertain a similar horror. From the
high figure at which they have fixed for some time to come the prices
of admission, it is evident they are anxious to avoid, as long as they can,
the motion o º like a Shilling being connected with a building
so extremely lofty and aristocratic. They unquestionably consider the
“Shilling” would be too lowering.
THE FIVE GARTERS.
THE following letter was received by Mr. Punch on Saturday week:-
“My dear PUNCH,-I have now Five Garters to give away. Will
you have one of them, or all? “Ever yours, affectionately,
“Mr. Punch.” º
To which Mr. Punch returned the following reply:—
“My dear PAM,-I have not Five Legs, and if I had, I always wear
socks. So dispose of your ribbon as you like, but I think John NY
ought to have a yard. “Yours, most devotedly,
“Lord Palmerston, K.G.” PUNCH.”
The Wiscount replied as follows:—
“My dear PUNCH,-Of course I will give one to John NY, and make
it additionally welcome by telling him that it was your suggestion. But
as to the other four P Do you see any objection to this list?
“Shaftesbury,

“FITzwillIAM.
“SoMERSET. -
“Or does anybody else occur to you? I should like to have it off my
mind before Exhibition day. “Ever yours,
“Mr. Punch.”
Mr. Punch's rejoinder was this:—
... My dear PAM, I have considered your list. . -
“SHAFTESBURY. Well. It’s a pomp and a vanity, rather, but if

see no reason against your decorating your spiritual adviser. He is a
brick in most respects.
“CANNING. Certainly. You could not do better. He was not
over-wise in the Sepoy business, and I decorated him myself in my own
way, but let that pass. Besides, you remember his father, and so do I.
“FITzwill IAM. Is this a mistake—you write a splendid hand, so
there’s no misreading? Who’s FITzwillLAM? I see a peer of that
name who is ºf to call himself WENTwoRTH. If you mean an
extra compliment to DILKE's family, I see no objection, but I never

“When you have cut of the five slices, if you have a little bit over,

“Ever yours,

So on the Monday morning the world was informed that the five
Garters were given as mentioned, but we have not yet heard anything
about the extra bit.
EXHIBITION OF PROTECTIVE INVENTIONS.
WARLIKE implements of destruction are very properly included
in the International Exhibition, at the Brick Palace, because in
the first place they afford a warning to those whom it may concern,
and secondly they serve to remind us how very much lower we are than
the angels, or at least that we partake of the same human nature with
some foreigners who are very little above the fiends; considerations
which should make us humble. -
If, however, we exhibit engines and other weapons wherewithal
mankind are accustomed to inflict diabolical outrages on each other,
our enemies for the sake of glory and plunder, but ourselves under
necessity of self-defence, why do we not also exhibit other machines
and instruments which we also use for protection against our evil
brethren, and which differ from arms chiefly in answering that F.
without inflicting excessive torment and hideous mutilation? There is
the crank, there is the treadmill, there is the cat o' nine tails, why don't
we show them The world is invited to inspect a cannon which blows
you into smithereens and another state of existence; but we do not
offer to the contemplation of our fellow-man the apparatus whereby, a
murderer is launched into eternity. Everyone, almost, is eager for the
display of the Armstrong Gun, but nobody says a word for the exhibition
of the Gallows.
A Pedestrian Public.
ON Thursday last week, by way of celebrating May Day, the
London Generai Ömnibus Company raised their fares on nearly the
whole of their line; in some cases to double... The consequence is, that
when the conductors cry “Benk! Benk!” the disgusted public very
generally reply, “Walker "

ESSAYS AND REMARKS.
BEAUTy.—Women, because beauty is supposed to be peculiar to
them, are called the fair sex, but throughout nearly all foreign nations
the women are no more beautiful than the men, and most of the men
are hideously ugly. In England there are more beautiful women, than
there are anywhere else; but even here female beauty is so much the
reverse of common, that a woman herself, meaning to say that another
is ugly, will term her ordinary, or as that word is too generally pro-
nounced, ornary. -
A beautiful girl, red and white, much resembles an apple tree out in
bloom; only º, fades rather faster than beauty. At twenty,
beauty, like the Gravedigger's tanner, “will last you nine year;”
rhaps a year or two more; very .# not so many }". ut its
ecay, though quickly observed, is slowly felt. , Loss of beauty is of
not much consequence to a wife; for a husband soon gets used to his
wife's beauty, and then, if ever so great, it is just as if it were not;
#. had therefore better not accept men who want to marry them for
their beauty; and a girl able to get a husband * more durable attrac-
tions is likely to be happier in marriage without beauty than she would
be with it. -
Beauty is chiefly a matter of limited roundness of form, relative pro-
portion, and colour in the right place; for colour in the wrong place is
not beautiful; for instance red at the end of the nose. When rotundity
exceeds a certain arch, the form which was beautiful grows ſunny.
Beauty of figure and complexion is best preserved by moderation in
eating, not to say drinking, plenty of exercise, and the use of soft water,
without any other cosmetic than º of which the best is yellow.
Beauty of feature is kept longest by discarding envy, hatred, malice,
small vanity, and anxiety about money matters; emotions which gra-
dually muddle the eye, and pull the outlines of the face out of shape;
anxiety about money matters especially having the effect of causing a
dull unhappy scowl, and distorting the mouth. Hence matronly beauty
is rather often s iled b engrossing attention to domestic economy;
whilst on the other hand, so very lively a beauty distinguishes unmar-
ried girls and young wives who repose implicit confidence in the sol-
yency of their husbands andfathers, as many of them do although the
income of those gentlemen depends upon their personal industry.
Habitual regardlessness of expense is the chief cause of the superior
beauty of the superior classes, especially the aristocracy, producing that
beautiful serenity of countenance which reclining in the carriages that
revolve around the Ring in Hyde Park, they most of them exhibit in
;º sº º sordid º º º: in the
ºlded and, puckered visages of those who have, as the saying is, to
pull the devil by the tail. ag ying
The only perennial beauty is that which is sublimated by cultivating
the moral sentiments and the intellect. It is very rare indeed. The
rest is merely animal beauty, and when the beauty goes the animal only
remains; the grace of the fawn is replaced by the clumsiness of the
cow, the | elegant young lady expands into the bulky middle-aged
Woman; and the fine girl that once was becomes what she and the
dandies who then dangled after her used contemptuously to call an
elderly party.” Here, a woman who had never any animal beauty to
lºse, but who has some spiritual beauty which is not to be lost, catches
the other Hº and passes her by. Ief this be a consolation to every
plain sensible girl whose personal defects are the subject of satire, if
such a girl can ever survive such satire,
INCONCEIWABLE FATUITY.
A MAN has just brought an action against a chemist for giving him
medicine which did not suit the complaint. The plaintiff stated that
he was recommendcd to go to the person in question by the Beadle !
The jury, of course, burst out laughing and found for the defendant,
who we trust has since been locked up, for a person who would ask a
Beadle for advice on any subject cannot be one who should be trusted
abroad. We are far from justifying the conduct of two low fellows
who went into the other extreme, and also into the Lowther Arcade,
the other night, and kicked the Beadle there, on the ground that he
was only a Beadle, nay, we are very glad that they were severely dealt
with. But if it be right to fine a man who kicks a Beadle, what should
be done unto the man who asks him to recommend a medical attendant?
The only extenuating circumstance seems to have been that the Beadle
in question was not also a Sexton, so the plaintiff could not exactly be
charged with suicidal intentions... We have seldom read of a case
where such hopeless feebleness of mind was manifested, in fact its
extraordinary character knocks us into a moral Cocked Hat.
The Bare Ideal
A LADY and Gentleman were looking down into the bear-pit at the
Zoological Gardens, when the º (MRs. Jon Es, of Camden Town)
exclaimed quite impulsively, “Oh, lºok at these dear little bears.
Why, what a darling lot of 'em “Yes, my dear,” answered the
gentleman, (MR. Jones, of the same locality), “I declare, it's, quite
an-ursa-ry—almost as full as our own.” The lady agreed with her
husband, and even laughed, though it was morally impossible she
could have understood the wretch's joke. We chvy MFs. Jon Es her
19norance.

SO VERY BECOMING.
The obstinacy with which, in spite of remonstrance and ridicule,
ladies persist in wearing hoops amounts to a pig-headedness which is
aptly crowned by the pork-pie hat.

A FAIR WORD FOR A FAIR PLACE.
SYNCHRONously with the opening of the World's Work Exhibition,
the Crystal Palace on May Day began another season. We hope that
no one of the thousands who were present at South Kensington lessened
their enjoyment by comparisons with Sydenham. Comparisons are
odorous, as Mrs. Malaprop does not observe, although mis-quoters have
continually put the words into her mouth; and to compare the Crystal
Palace with the House that FowkE built would clearly not conduce
to the advantage of the latter. The Crystal Palace is all brightness,
both inside and out; there is nothing ugly or unsightly in the building;
when first shown, in slightly different form, in 1851, we all thought it
still more wondrous than the wonders it contained. But as for the
New Edifice—well, we can see how it is domed, and we could wish that
it were doomed; and we only hope all foreigners who criticise it cruelly
will just jump into a cab and see our Crystal Palace, before they say
that England cannot build a handsome building.
We hope too as the Palace is a pride as well as pleasure to us, that
the nation will consider it a duty to support it. Now that season
tickets may be had for but a guinea, stingy fathers of a family have but
half the grounds they had last year to say they can't afford one. Of
course we shrink from putting forth un-Christianlike advice; but if
ladies and their daughters resºlve to lague Papa at dinner until he
buys them each a ticket, he really will be only getting his desert. And
don't let him imagine that the ..". will be wasted. People can't
well go to Sydenham without taking lots of exercise (if you doubt it,
MR. PATER, just go and count the stairs), and many a young lady has
in our belief been saved a visit to the doctor by visiting the place where
she may see the famous Fountain; at which in 1851 there were so many
happy meetings, whence so many happy matches resulted in due course.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 189
THE TWO QUEENS
MIDNIGHT in the monster Building,
The day's labour done, -
Silence, where two thousand voices
Pealed but now like one;
For the crowd of thrice three thousand,
Here I pace alone
From the orchestra deserted
To the empty throne.
Through the vasty void of silence
# hear a sound?
Was it my own ºl. foot-fall?
Fireman on his round .
Or Policeman slow patrolling
Transept, nave, and aisle -
Was that gleam his bull's-eye streaming,
Or his moon-lit tile?
Ne'er fell tread of mine so stately,
alks no fireman so:
Not thus sounds policeman's blucher,
Heavy-heeled and slow.
Never flashed from blinding bull's-eye
Radiance like that:
Never moon with such an aureole
Crowned policeman's hat.
Lo, two shapes from out the darkness
Öf the nave have grown!
Hand in hand they near the dais,
Near the empty throne. .
By the beamy crown that circles
Either radiant brow,
By their royal orbs and sceptres,
These be Queens I trow.
Strong the one of thew and sinew,
Giant-like of limb;
Coal-black is the robe upon her,
Fire her crown doth rim;
And her sceptre is a hammer
Like Great Thor's of old; .
And her feet, they clank like iron,
'Neath her garment's fold.
(On the Night of May 1st, 1862.)
Fair the other, with a beauty
Passing human far;
Star-bedropped her azure raiment,
And her crown a star.
Perfect shape with Fº feature
Blent inform,and face,
When she opes her lips, ’tis music,
When she moves, ’tis grace.
Straight to me, through their unlikeness,
These two Queens were known,
And I marked how each on other
Pressed the vacant throne.
Strong Queen Handicraft to honour
Fair Queen Art was fain: .
Fair Queen Art, with sweet resistance,
Waived the throne again.
“Yours,” quoth Art, “is this profusion
Of the fruits of toil,
Loom and forge-work, clay and crystal,
Growth of seed and soil.
Yours this spinning of men-spiders,
Honey of men's hives;
What creates or costs men comfort,
Makes or mars their lives.”
ºt º quoth Handicraft, “the roughing
Of the mass is mine;
But 'tis thy hand gives the beauty,
Moulding by design.
Thine the forms of clay and crystal,
Iron, brass and gold,
Textile pattern, woven colour,
Gorgeous to beholdi
&c. pºk'st thou sooth,” fair Art protested,
“Thou prevail'st no more;
Mine the hand which shapes the coinage,
Thine which digs the ore,
I am but a humble handmaid,

SOMETHING LIKE A MAYOR.
If we were not Punch, we would be the MAYOR OF Dover. That
eminent individual—we have not the faintest idea of his private name—
must be always ºf in a state of intellectual qui rive, which, next to
doing nothing at is the happiest state in which a man can exist.
He must always be dressed, da and night, in beautiful clothes, and his
mind must also be always in dress, and his tongue prompt with
affluent eloquence. For he never, knows at what hour of the Twenty-
four periods into which our troubles are divided he may not have to
bounce out of his hº down to the harbour to receive somebody,
and º in to thank that, Party for coming to England. The
study of that Mayor's mind would be an interesting one. His whole
life—that is while he is Mayor—must be one constant Look Out. , He
must have a neat sentence perpetually trembling on his lips, and we
make no doubt that when he is suddenly wakened in the morning by
the housemaid's knock and the announcement of shaving-water, his first
inarticulate answer shapes itself into something like a complimentary
congratulation. , His nightmares must be white horses moving in pro-
cession, and making such a clatter that his oration cannot be heard.
And we should like to know whether the Beadle of Dover knows of
a private bell which will ºf the Mayor up into smiles and eloquence
at the smallest of the small hours, if a King, or an Archduke, or an
Ambassador, or a Returned Proconsul, or a Liberator, or a Royal
Sweetheart, or an expatriated Patriot is signalled as f
better now he is in smooth water, and wanting a speech from the
Mayor in ten minutes. The Mayors of other places are not much
annoyed in this way, and, as for our LoRD MAYOR, no kings and libe-
rators and that sort of folks dare to pop in upon him—he invites them,
or they stay away. But the MAYOR of Dover never knows when he
will be wanted with something in the way of a speech from the throne,
only in good English. It is a noble position, but a trying one, and we
thought of him with sympathy the other day when LoRD CANNING
suddenly appeared, and the Mayor had to rush down with a recapitula-
tion of the #. -- - -
C’s policy as distinguished from that of all other Indian rulers since
a little
tory of India since July 1855, and an essay upon LoRD
LORD CLIVE... We should think that a tremendous re-action must set
in when the Mayor goes ºut, and that after a year of preternaturally
elaborate Fº at all hours, he must subside into a social cynic.
Instead of saluting his acquaintance with a graceful “Ah, my dear
friend, I had a presentiment of pleasure, but believe me when I assure
you that the gratification of encountering you thus unexpectedly
transcends my expectations,” the ex-Mayor will be perfectly justified
in condensing, his ecstacies for the rest of his life into “Hullo!
KNOCKER, is that you?”. Is there no special testimonial presented to
the MAYOR QF Dow ER on his quitting office There certainly ought to
be a mark of distinction for the man who when Dover's Powder has
been exhibited in the form of a Salute, comes, forward and interprets
the voice of the cannon into QUEEN’s English. And the inscription
should be Suave Mayori magno, which would in the most subtle manner
hint at the sweetness of his speeches, and the element whence the
auditor arrives to hear them.”
A COMPLIMENT TO A GALLANT COLONEL.
WE understand that, a subscription is in course of being raised
amongst the officers of HER MAJESTY's troops, and other persons
interested in the maintenance of the character of the British Army, for
the presentation of a testimonial to Colonel, BENTINCK of the 4th
| Dragoon Guards, to mark their sense of the conduct as an officer and a
. whereby he distinguished himself in his treatment of
ČArrºn Rogertson, and also as a witness on the Court Martial lately
held on that officer. The testimonial is to consist of an ebony back-
board, inlaid with an inscription in red and gold letters recording its
intention as a richly deserved acknowledgment. To this honourable
token of respect and esteem will be affixed a round robin whereon will
be emblazoned the names of the donors.

THE UNKNOWN BULL.
N the eve of May Day,
in answer to a ques-
tion from MR. KIN-
NAIRD :-
“MR. Layandregretted
to *. that information
had en received that,
owing to the interference
of thes hauthorities
at Seville, the English
chaplain had been com-
pelled to suspend the
celebration of protestant
worship on the consular
premises."
What a shame it is,
if his Holiness the
Pope has really sent
the QUEEN or SPAIN
a bull commanding
her not to allow Pro-
testants to be perse-
cuted in her domi-
nions, because perse-
cution is un-Christian,
and because Pro-
testant vernments
might be thereby
tempted to practise
º: intoler-
ance, that the British
public are kept, in
ignorance of that
signal and credit-
able act of Papal
liberality!
CUT THE CADS.
WHAT does the Morning Star say to this,
which we take from the leading New York
newspaper? After a denunciatory reference to
the recent passage of arms between Lords
WESTBURY and ChELMsFord (falsely described,
of course) the organ of Americanism (April 9)
says–
“Before the English obtained a penny press such scenes
and such language, on the part of public men and news-
papers, were unheard of.”
Is not this ungrateful? This is the return
which Americanism makes, to Englishmen who
fawn upon it. The implied charge is a lie, the
penny journals are generally written as de-
corously, if not in as educated a style, as were
their predecessors, but those who have truckled
to Yankeeism are really served right. Come,
here is a good opportunity for “sweeping the
kitchen,” and we hope to see it done with a
will. The Star will never stand this.
The Great American Question.
If the North should conquest win
In º fratricidal º: -
For the Northern debt let in
Will the South its quota pay?
Failing, will the North submit
To its burden, or eschew

Have to whistle for their due?

“MR. Punch,

“A Novel, IMPortation.—Nine magpies, seven quails, three laughing jackasses,
twelve rose-breasted cockatoos, and one wallaby have been impo into Auckland,

“Maybe as how you'll think magpies, quails, and cockatoos, with

“In this district unemployed i. labourers and itinerants are turning their

“THIS COMES HOPPING.”
We see that a deputation has been waiting on the CHANGELLOR of
THE Excheques on the subject of “hop drawbacks.” Qf course,
these allude to the ladies' long dresses, expansive skirts, and monster
crinolines; for such are the greatest “hop drawbacks” that we are
uainted with, inasmuch as they natur º: with the grace
and facility of dancing. All the great celebrities connected with our
Casinos, Caldwells, and Cremormes, who make a pursuit of Terpsichore,
were doubtlessly to be seen amongst the deputation. If poor B.A.Ron
NATHAN had been alive, how efully and pointedly he would have
described the entire thing with his toe! He need not have spoken-
he would have danced. He would have laid his grievances at the
CHANCELLoR's feet through the graphic medium of a hallet, and the
figures he would have brought forward would have had that entrainant
force and impulsive &lan in them that GLApstone must have been irre-
sistibly carried away with them!
Good Popish News.
CARDINAL DE ANGELIs Aº of Parma, has, it is said, been
chosen to succeed Pope Pius The Ninº, when the latter shall be
really de angelis. There is a sort of gleam of comfort in this, for
ANGELUs is “a name implying a duty,” and if we are to have an
more Popes, it would be convenient that they should recognise su
things as duties. Moreover, an Angel means one who is sent, and the
name holds good omen of its owner soon being sent about his business.
So, bibimus Papaliter in honour of his Holiness elect.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROZEN OUT SAILORS.
ow that floating iron
shot-towers are to
constitute our fleet,
and apparently there
soon will be no ships
used in our service,
there comes the ques-
tion what our naval
sailors are to do to
get a living, for it is
clear that they will
soon be no more
wanted in the Navy.
When there are no
more ships to sail,
there can be no more
need of sailors; and
as for paying able
seamen to man a fleet
of flat-irons with
neither, masts, nor
spars, this would be
no less, a waste of
wages than an insult
to our tars. Steam
is bad enough in the
opinion of old salts,
and doubtless many
a strong adjective has
been hurled upon the heads of the lubbers who invented it. But though
steam in a great measure has superseded sails, in the Navy it has j.
been used as an auxiliary; and until such floating forts as the Merrimac
were thought of, the Navy still had ships, and although they had steam-
engines in them they had also masts and sails. Now, however, if the
cupolas succeed, the Navy will consist of shot-towers, not ships: and
our sailors must look out for other means of livelihood, as their naval
occupation will of course be at an end... As for getting them to serve
on board of “them blanked flat-irons,” that will certainly be hopeless,
and indeed it were a waste of money if we could, for to do mere
stoker's work one does not want a skilful sailor. We can fancy the
disgust with which a man-o’-war's man, one of the old school, woul
hear that he was wanted to serve onboard a cupola'ſ. We should think
he would as lief be clapped in irons out and out, as be stewed up in an
iron barge without a to reef, or a rope to handle.
When our sailors leave the Navy then, what is to become of them *
We cannot have a lot of strong limbed lusty fellows going about the
streets in gangs, and bellowing “Got no work to do-o-o!” like frozen-
out market-gardeners., Clearly some plan must be hit upon to make
use of their muscle, and the sooner we begin to think of one the better,
It would be grievous to see sailors driven to drive cabs, or coming out
as 'bus-conductors. Yet doubtless this too many of them will be forced
to do, unless timely steps be taken to provide them with employment.
We quite expect if we live long enough to hear a “What cheer, mess-
mate!” interchanged between two 'bus-drivers, or else to hear a
Hansom cabman, stopped by a big, mountain of a piled up Pickford's

A WONDERFUL WOMAN.
WHAT remarkably queer people there must be in the world! For
instance, only look at this advertisement for one, which astonished us
the other morning in the Times:—
URNISHED APARTMENTS TO BE LET, to a single lady, con-
taining a sitting-room and bed-room in a villa residence near Westbourne Grove.
Apply, &c.
Now, just fancy a single lady having room enough inside her to con-
tain a couple of rooms. What, a very extraordinary person she must
be . Where in the world does the advertiser think he will discover her ?
Perhaps when he does so he will make an exhibition of her. She would
be fully as attractive as JULIA PASTRANA. But we rather º:

their owner finds a lady “containing a sitting-room and bed-room” to

THE PROPHETE PLAYED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY A
LADY.
We extract the following delicious morceau from a recent number of
Bell’s Life:—
THE WAY to MAKE MONEY on the TURF.—A Lady of five years
experience on the Turf, having realised a nice income, is willing to ſº
HER SYSTEM, which is very simple, to any one who will send her one sovereign.
Address, &c. Enclose a stamped directed envelope.
We have had Prº enough on the Turf, but a Prophetess is quite
a new character., What can a lady’s “experience” on the Turf be
like * We should say it §: to consist mainly in seeing that the beds
are well aired, and that the lawn is É. erly clear-starched, and similar
female occupations. , Little girls should beware of the Turf, as the
number of sharp blades that are generally found there makes it ve
lº. sport, and they might cut their little fingers. However, if
she has made “a nice income” of it, she must have had rare winnin
ways of her own. We do not like the request for the iº.
envelope”, much. It sounds mean for a lady to ask for a penny just
after she has been pocketing, a sovereign. We do not, call it being
exactly “penny wise,” though her correspondent would have every
right to be un oubtedly considered “pound foolish.” The lady does
not give her name, but we presume it must be BET. By the bye, if
this new race of prophetesses meets with public encouragement, they
will be wanting a paper of their own for their advertisements and cor.
respondence. e beg to recommend to them a Belle's Life. One of
its great features naturally would be the Ring. For ourselves, we do
not admire ladies who have anything to do with the stable. They
never should venture on the Turf, unless there should happen to be a
Nursery there.
A BIG NAME FOR A BIG PLACE.
Now that we have got our World's Show, what are we to call it?
“International Exhibition” is such a mouthſhi of a name, that no one
but an elocutionist can easily pronounce it. “International Exhibition”
may do very well for orators who like to use long words, but for 'bus
drivers and cabmen something shorter must be substituted. . Men who
are accustomed to call the City the “Stee,” and to speak of the Bank
of England as the “B'nk,” can hardly be expected to waste their
breath in . “International Exhibition.” hat they will contract
- ess only knows; but, to prevent some horrid barbarism,
it is surely time for somebody to think of some short title that will suit
the cabbies. The South Kensington Museum has been called the
..º. Bilers; and if we don't take, care, the new building may
possibly get christened “Fowke's Folly.”
“More last Words.”
THERE is discussion whether the last words of WILLIAM PITT were
a foolish sentimentalism, an unworthy §: of maundering, or an un-
necessary oath. As all the witnesses discredit each other, and as each
report is discreditable to the memory of a great man, we may fairl
reject the whole mass of senile gossip, and believe that ¥ſa. Fºrt die
like a gentleman, an idea which, strangely enough, has not occurred to
any .# the living gentlemen who have been protracting a not very
edifying controversy. Do they think it absolutely necessary that the
theatrical rule should apply, and that a man should attempt a mot at
the moment he leaves the stage of life?
A General's Head in Chancery.
A New York paper says that “GENERAL M'CHELLAN’s pºsition
before York-town is like that of a man who is plaintiff in the British
Court of Chancery.” . More like it than, probably, the writer was
aware. For, on examining the map, we perceive that at the south is
SLEEPY Hoſſe Hollow, that when we have got to HALF WAY House
we find that we have another HALF WAY House to reach, and then a
third HALF WAY House, that CoMFORT LIGHT House is far behind,
that in full view is JAIL ISLAND, and that the whole is commanded by
BIG BETHEL.
THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.
PEOPLE may not be generally aware of it, but if MR. CowPER. is to
be believed, Big Ben is altered in tone; they have raised him to
B-quiet.
A SURE WAY OF MAKING IT RICH.
WHAT is the best way of buying a currant-dumpling?
With the current coin, to be sure.

SPECULATIONS ABOUT MONEY, AND WITHOUT ANY
MONEY.
The only speculations we allow ourselves are mental ones, because
they are perfectly safe, and can always be indulged in without the
expenditure of a single penny. Besides, if they do occasionally turn
out badly, you are not compelled to put down your horse, or to drink two
glasses of wine per diem instead of three, or to exchange lump sugar for
moist, in consequence of the result. , Neither insanity nor suicide were
ever known to grow out of a confirmed indulgence of the practice.
Mental speculations may be called the art of speculating with profit
and security without any money. Amongst other harmless things, we
like to launch into the wildest speculations about money. It is a kind
of consolation for not possessing any one's self. You feel all the richer
at the moment, and are none the poorer when it is over. For instance,
here are two little speculations in which we recently invested a very
agreeable quarter of an hour whilst smoking a mild cigar:—
First Speculation. What is a Circular Note? At first, we thought it
might be a milliner's note for a lady's crinoline; but we soon discarded
that absurd idea, and, taking another puff at our Havannah, came to
the conclusion that a circular note must have been originally so framed
for the purpose of holding a good round sum.
Second Speculation. What is a “Shin-Plaster?” We had often heard
of Shin-Plasters, but never having seen one, we could not very well
nake out what they were like. A fancy struck us that º might be
plasters for the special relief of persons who had itching palms, but as
the “shin” was plainly indicated, of course, that notion instantly fell
to the ground as well as the succeeding, one that they were probably
intended to relieve persons who were labouring under a complaint of
the chest. Puffing away again, we could only solve the difficulty by
supposing that a shin-plaster was nothing better than a kind of poor
man's substitute when he couldn't get the real “golden ointment,”
and was an ingenious specific invented in the first instance by a weak
government that was on its last legs, and was obliged to resort to this
A REWIVED POET.
(See Mr. Punch ever so long ago.)
I AM the Poet of the Philharmonic,
Who some years back composed in Punch a Tonic,
whºg hoped would bring peace between BENNETT and
OSTA,
But et animosity has been permitted to foster.
Surely it is time Costa should alter his Demeanour,
And forget all that Mistake and Nonsense about Parisina.
STERNDALE is not stern, and they state has made a Sign
That he will forget and forgive if Costa behaves Benign.
Now MICHAEL should trample on the Devil of Wrath and
pleen,
Apologise like a gentleman, and let all be serene,
And as been suggested by an able Contemporary,
Make some Amends as humanum est Sempererrare,
Request the gracious MR. GYE to ask DR. BENNETT
To produce his Qde at Covent Garden, the Musical Senate,
Mr. Cost, conducting it firm and brilliant as Marble,
Which ºf: indeed be Deemed making Amende honorable.
Then the Public will rejoice at the re-union of the gifted
Secessioners,
And with one heart, turn round and cordially kick the
International Commissioners.
ANOTHER SHAM.
THE elegant phrase now used to describe a ridiculous
meal which is neither one thing nor tºother, and unfits you
for both, is a P; Dinatoire. Bother such bosh. If
eople want Mr. Punch to come to breakfast, let 'em ask
him, and he won't. If they want him to come to dinner,
let 'em ask him—and he will come or not, according to
his knowledge of their wine. But if they think that he is
going to spoil his habitually beautiful breakfast, in order
that he may eat and drink something that will spoil his
habitually beautiful dinner, they know very little of Mr.
Punch. º Dilatoire be its name, D.D. beits initials,
and “Fiddle D.D.” be any sensible, person's answer to

uack remedy with the view of maintaining anything like a footing in
the money-market. The above speculation is, we conſess, a most
elaborate one, but the extreme ingenuity of it. amused us, besides
enabling us to finish in a most agreeable frame of mind our delicious
clgar.
§ºn speculations are exceedingly harmless, and moreover they have
this great merit, that they are never likely to be the ruin, much less the
death, of any one. Eor instance, we, ourselves, after the above pro-
fitable investment of a quarter of an hour, felt as hº and as con-
tented, as if we had just been making a handsome little coup of fifty
thousand pounds on the Stock Exchange.

WHEN rogues fall out, our fathers said,

That proverb's now, by fact quite dead
Against it, overthrown.
Lo, North and South the sword have drawn,
Ånd meet with bayonets crossed
And our supply of cotton’s gone,
Our weavers’ living lost.
Another Q. and A.
“HAve we too many. Women in this England of ours at the present
day?” This is a question asked, pertinently, by a contemporary. We
reply, certainly not, but they take up a great, deal too much rºom in
this England of ours, and act as if they thought, it was an England of
theirs. Therefore we would say–off with crinoline, or off to Columbia.

MR. SLEIGH AND THE LAND THAT’S FREE.
NoTHING like true Liberalism for making root and branch
work. MR. SLEIGH, the legal candidate, who opposed MR.
DouLTON, the pottery, candidate, for fambet , and was
defeated by a slight majority of 5124 to 754, is so convinced
that the people do not understand the true value of their
electoral privilege, that he proposes to pass a law to make
every elector present himself at the poll, and, under penalty
of a fine, either vote, or declare himself Neutral. An un:
fortunate person in the crowd ventured to cry out “We
live in a free country,” and we understand that the look of
scorn with which he was instantly scorched by MR.SLEIGH
was so intense, that its vividness, combined with the heat
of the day, melted the rash man up like wax-work, and if
he had not been º removed to the nearest public-
house, his widow would have had, instead of a husband,
only two half-boots filled with liquified human nature. Live
in a free country, indeed! But we think that MR. SLEIGH
lets the offenders down too easily, and that, instead of a
pecuniary fine, a much severer penance should be inflicted
on electors, when a fiberal candidate looks for them in
vain. Should not an elector who fails to attend at all, be
soundly flogged? Should not an elector who ſº only a
split, vote instead of a plumper for the Liberal be sent to
penal servitude? And really, while we are asking questions,
should not an elector who votes for the Liberal's opponent
be drawn, as of old, on a Sleigh to the place of execution,
and be hanged? The only difficulty that could arise is
where, as at Lambeth, there were three Liberals, and a poor
elector º not know which to support—each being, as
at Lambeth, not a bit better than the others. But this is a
mere question of detail, and though MR. SLEIGH is not,
unfortunately chosen to be the Alter Fºo of MR. W. WIL-

in the Constitution, and hand it to the Law advisers of the

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAY 5th, Monday. The º attorney must be up and stirring,
and hasten to put the screw upon his M.P. For LORD WESTBURY has
caused the House of Lords to pass his Conveyancing Reform Bills, and
if these be not defeated in the House of Commons, they will become
the Law of the Land, and the Land will pay less to the Law. It is
rather awful to contemplate; but we are actually at this moment in
º of being able to make a cheap and safe title to property, and to
uy and sell it without paying as much for the sheep-skins as for the
sheep-walk... But, thank Mammon, we have a House of Attorneys
something that will show itself as mindful of their interests as they
themselves could be. ... Up, Six-and-eightpences, and at 'em!
Lambeth declared that it would not be represented by a barrister, or
any other person supposed to belong to the educated classes, but would
choose a member whose chief merit should lie in his being an exact fac-
simile of our friend, Wiscount WILLIAMs. As Nature does not make
two people alike, there was a difficulty in procuring the Jºiº. article,
and, by a pardonable confusion in the Metropolitan mind, the recollec.
tion that potter's clay was easily fashioned into any desired form, sent
the electors into a potter's yard to look for their man. There they
found the potter himself (and a very clever and eminent potter he is);
and so they invited him to potter in the House of Commons. MR.SLEigh,
the barrister, ventured to suggest that he would be a better member,
and MR. WILKINson, somewhat contumeliously called a WILKINsoN,
haughtily apprised the Lambeth public that he should neither canvass,
flatter, nor carry them, but if they liked to elect him they might. They
did not like, nor would they have MR. SLEIGH, but they, that is to say
5,124, out of 21,737, voted for MR. FREDERIck Doulton, the figulus
aforesaid, and to-night he took the oaths and his seat as Williams if
We believe MR. Doulton to be a sensible, business-like gentleman;
and we were considerably pleased with him for informing the impetuous
Electors of Lambeth that, if º thought he was going to start off at
once at a gallop, like a tailor on horseback, they made a mistake, as he
intended to be silent, and study the manners and customs of the House,
or |MR
before he essayed to improve its mind. One DEAN Swift has a couple
of lines which, without change of names, curiously apply to the debate
of the night—
“Next, here's [SIRJ Robert's vindication,
And MR. HENLEY's last oration.”
MR. RoBERT Lowe has not yet been barrownighted that we have
heard of, or, the line would be complete. To-night MR. WALPole
announced that as the Government had submitted so very obediently
on the Education Question, he should not put his foot on their necks
MR. Robert Lowe, as above mentioned, “windicated” himself, and
. HENLEY made an oration on the importance of Religious Educa-
tion. MR. WALTER very nearly carried a proposal for making the
education of the less favoured and fortunate classes, rather more casy,
but was defeated by a narrow majority–seven º in a house of 319.
In the discussion on a subsequent proposal, the Honourable Douglas
PENNANT, a Conservative, and member for Carnarvonshire, had the
courage to say that he believed the Welsh language to be the Curse of
Wales, being the great obstacle to improvement. Of course it is, but
while a pack of sentimentalists keep up...a twitter about it, and offer
prizes for Welsh odes and such like Gorilla utterances, how is the fatal
jargon to be exterminated? Here’s a health to Edward THE FIRST,
though we are sorry to say that historians now disbelieve that he did
splificate highborn Hoel, soft LLEwBLLYN, MoDRED, who made
linlimmon shudder with his dissonant ballads, and the rest of the
Welsh Bards—whose only merit was their having afforded T. G. the
subject for an ode that will outlast Snowdon.
Tuesday. MR. DARBY GRIFFITH... “Will LORD PALMeRSTON say
whether any hostile movements against Herat have been undertaken
by the Shah?”
LoRD PALMERSTON (as Echo). “Psha!”
It was all very well to say “psha” to that eternal quidnunc, MR.
DARBY GRIFFITH, but our dearly beloved PAM was a little rude to-
night, and much as we love him, we cannot allow him to take liberties.
He was asked a question about the Spithead forts, when he broke out

quite angrily, and accused the House of having been so completely run
away with § the account of the Merrimac and Monitor battle that it
was no use remonstrating, so Ministers had felt it their duty to yield
to the general feeling. But he did not feel at all convinced that they
had dome right, and then he scolded the House for taking details out
of the hands of the Government. Now, MASTER PAM, stand up and
listen to us... You are very fond of yielding, as you call it, when you
can’t stem the tide, that is to say, you concede rather than be beaten
and turned out. You have thrown over a Reform Bill, and you have
thrown over the Revised Code, and you would throw over two or three
other things sooner than be put in a hole. All very well, but if you
believed, in your heart, that these forts were necessary to the safety of
your country, your duty was to stick to them, and take, the conse-
uences. As for the defences of the country being a detail which, the
ouse is not to meddle with, that, MASTER PAM, is such ridiculous
nonsense, that we can only suppose you were out of temper, and said
the first thing that came into your head., The fight between those
ships is the most important thing in modern times, and though, the
Quarterly Review takes your tone about “clamour. and so on (perhaps
you wrote the article for your neighbours in Albemarle Street), we
shall want a good many more articles, and a good many more, snubs,
before we lose sight of the fact that the Americans have tried the
experiment which we have only been talking about. You are not
usually an offender in this way, and therefore we are content with a
monition upon this occasion. You may sit down. -
MR. LyALL wished to hand over Ceylon to the Indian Government.
LoRD STANLEY thought the Indian §º had enough to do.
The debate was useful, because it made a great number of Members
aware for the first time that § is not under the Indian Govern-
ment, but under SIR CHARLEs Wood as Colonial Secretary- and not as
Secretary for India. Yah, Cox, did you think you had caught us out?
MR. WHALLEY

And derision,
Squashed that silly youth.
Whalley's Folly was disposed of by 191 votes to 111. MR. I.INDSAY
was then defeated by 115 to 77 on a motion in favour of Harbours of
Refuge, for which he made out a very good case, but, as MR. MILNER
GIBSON frankly and fairly said,'please consider our taxes. We can only
just keep our own heads above water, and for the present the navigators
must look to themselves. At the same time we would far sooner make
a Harbour than an Armstrong battery, would circumstances allow.
The Red Sea Telegraph Bill went on a stage, and Mr. Punch mentions
this by way of peg to hang the statement that he reads, week by week,
that the Frenchmen are cutting through the Isthmus of Suez, though
PAM said it would be Suezcidal policy in England to permit it. ill
somebody question him hereon, or we shall, have the Sand cut, and an
ode by GEORGEs SAND in honour of the achievement, before we know
where we are,
Wednesday. The only subject of interest was a debate on Scotch
Public Houses, and in the course of it the º: pleasant conversa-
tion took place. MR. BUCHANAN, of Glasgow, said:–
“There was nothing more common than that a person in his own house should
entertain his friends, and that they should get intoxicated. (Laughter.)"
ºo * MR. DUNLoP, of Greenock (where it always rains) answered
that he
“Could not admit that getting drunk in a man's own house was so common as
the Member for Glasgow represented. The Hon. Member should speak for himself.
(Much Laughter.)"
We never dined with MR. BUCHANAN, but after the above genial and
jovial speech, we have no objection to inform him that we have not any
dinner engagement for next week which we will not throw over in
favour of a chop at the Reform Club. As for MR. DUNLoP, he talked
decorously, as became the legal adviser of the Free Kirk, but we’d no
wonder if he had just a taste for poultry, and we’d like fine to see his
tappit hen.
Thursday. MR. LAYARD informed the Commons that KING ABRAHAM
LINcoLN had concluded a new treaty with QUEEN VICTORIA for the
suppression of the Slave Trade, and that such treaty was really valuable,
because it gave us the Right of Search. The Ünión flag is no longer
to be hoisted to save the slaver
“From the dread English cruiser's shattering guns.”
The news will astonish divers American pirates, though they had a
hint of what was coming, in the solemn hanging of a yillanous slave-
captain the other day. Let MR. LINcoLN be duly credited with both
good deeds. The Commons cheered loudly. -
Then, upon the Second Reading of the principal Budget Bill, SIR
STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, formerly Private Secretary to MR. GLADSTONE,
rebelled against his late master, and charged him with mismanage.
ment of our finances. The rebel's Devonshire ears MR. GLADSTONE of
course boxed with considerable coolness, but then, the CHANCELLOR
being thus made safe, MR. DISRAELI thought he would have an
innings. So he let off a long accusing speech, talked of our Bloated
Armaments, and impugned our conduct towards the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH, against whom we armed, while pretending to honour him as a
trusty ally. PAM's pugnacious mood availed him well upon this occasion,
and never, did the valiant old boy go in for mischicf. more dashingly.
He pointed out that MR. DISRAELI was bidding for office, that he was
trying to catch support from all quarters, that he reserved his objections
to the Budget until he knew º would be useless, that his own late
º: SIRJohn PAKINGTON, had been, and he was proud to be called,
a chief promoter of the Bloated Armament, that we were upon the best
terms with the EMPEROR, but that Moral Power, which could be based
only on strength, was essential to England, that MR. DISRAELI and his
friends had no sympathy with the Italians, and finally that his whole
i. was mere party business, and was repugnant to the feelings of
the nation. Never came down a better shower of blows from the fist of
the old gladiator, and to borrow a popular phrase, MR. DISRAELI must
have been sorry that he spoke. Of course the Commons voted Income-
Tax, Sugar-Tax, Tea-Tax, and all the rest of the little delights.
Friday. LORD DERby made a long and elaborate speech in support
of a motion for a Committee to inquire whether anything could be done
to avert the Evil Smells caused by certain manufactures. The Com-
mittee was appointed, and we shall hear what it recommends, fountains
of Eau de Cologne, monster pastiles in public squares, or any other
cheap and practical remedy.
The distress of the Lancashire operatives—distress caused by the
American war—then occupied the attention of the House. It was
stated by MR. ALGERNoN EGERTON, of South Lancashire, that there
were 58,000 operatives out of em loy. Due tribute was paid to the
quiet endurance with which they |. their sufferings. MR. BRIGHT
said that the distress, though great, was not so severe as some persons
supposed, and that the county itself was at present able to deal with it.
MR. WILLIERs, for the Government, was of the same opinion. The
public must be content with the statements put forward by such autho-
rities; but the efforts of charity should not be relaxed, for it will be
very long before the causes of distress are removed, and pressure upon
the resources of Lancashire must not be made in undue excess. . It is
the policy of England, not of a county, that has refused to break the
blockade of the cotton coasts, and therefore we are all bound to help the
sufferers by that policy.
MR. GLADSTONE brought in a Bill to enable the British Museum
authorities to remove their beasts; and we hope that also it contains a
clause enabling M.R. PANIzzi to walk everybody, except the legitimate
student, out of the Reading Room, at present infested by a fi. of
idlers, and schoolboys, and crammers. W. have said a good deal about
this grievance, and mean to say a good deal more. But in answer to a
Prig, who .."; that young ladies come there and disturb his mind
by ogling and flirting, Mr. Punch indignantly replies that it is untrue
that there is anything of the kind; and that he should be very sorry to
see the ladies scared away by the cynical impertinence of Pecksni
Prigs. Mr. Punch is addicted º ladies, and they love him, and he
don’t care who knows it.
TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
MR. PUNCH gives notice, that several tons of stale p." all on the
subjects herein described, are now lying at his office, 85, fleet Street,

such application, will be shot at the nearest rubbish station, viz.:-

A FLYING ISLAND WANTED.
* > . . ~ - ILL somebody please
invent for us an Island
of Laputa ?
It would save a mint
of money in plated
ships, and Armstrong
guns, and Shoebury-
ness experiments. Al-
though weare at peace,
a most expensive war
is raging between
ºil. and ship-
uilders, and so far as
one can learn, there
seem but little hopes
of stopping it. First
the guns will gain the
day, and, then the
ships will be built
stronger until they
are ball-proof, then
bigger guns will come,
and then still stronger
ships ; and so the
battle will go on, and
F victories alternately
= be won by either side,
and the QUEEN’s pow-
der be burnt at a most
tremendous rate, so
long as Mr. Bui,
ees to stand the
shot.
lf the Invention
War goes on much
longer than it has
one, we quite expect
to hear of the construction of a cannon that shall throw a ball as big as the Bill upon St.
Paul's, and of a mortar. that shall, pitch a shell as large round as the dome. Indeed, we
fancy that in course of time, conical shot will equal the Big Pyramid of Egypt, and that guns
will be invented of sufficient power to throw such shot across from Brighton to Boulogne.
Now, if somebody would just invent a Flying
Island, and present us with the patent, thi
costly fight between artillerists and shield-makers would º: S00m cease. auenlº, unls
here would
be no need then of our Army and our Navy, our big guns and our block ships, our field pieces
and forts. Whenever any nation dared to pick
a quarrel with us, all that we should have to do
would be to let our Flying Island drop upon their
heads, and squash their fleets and forces flat at
one fell swoop. This is how the wise King of
Laputa waged his wars, and is it not recorded
how victorious he was f. It is true he sometimes
injured the bottom of his island, by * down
too heavily upon an enemy's domains. But no
doubt thick iron plating would prevent such
chance of damage: and even were this not to be
done, we º: follow the sage practice of the
monarch of Laputa, who gained a reputation
for mercy and forbearance by letting his island
gently on the heads of his offenders, who little
knew he really did so that he might not hurt
himself.
As wars are usually decided by the cash-box
rather than the powder-chest, the fewer, human
lives that are, sacrificed the better; and an in-
vention to annihilate an army at a blow would be
the best of peace-makers the world has ever
seen. Were the world to know that England
possessed a Flying Island, ready at any moment
to fall and crush her foes, the world would pro-
bably think twice before provoking her to fight,
and England would no longer have such pulls
upon her purse as she lately has been having, to
defray the cost of gun-founding and ship-building
experiments, and to waste,in sº pre-
parations for a war the millions she might spend
in profitable works, did she but possess a Flying
Island to guarantee her peace.
Dangerous !
Of course the International building is insured
to the full value of all that it contains. One
would fear there must be a great likelihood of
fire, as one hears that a live Cole is often found
about the place, and who is expected some day
to set the Thames on fire.
THE BEST WAY of PRESERVING MEAt.-
Invite none but Vegetarians to dine with you.
A SMACK AT DAY AND MARTIN.
AccoºDING to intelligence, from Rome, Pio NoN9 went the other
day to the camp at Porto d’Anzia, where “the soldiers knelt on the
approach of the Pope, and afterwards defiled before him.” It is to be
hoped that these warriors, after having defiled before his Holiness did
not proceed to defile their own mouths, by the lip-service which they
are thus described as having rendered to the Holy Father:—
“After the deſtle the Pontiff condescended to accept of a Zouave's knapsack for a
footstool, resting on which he presented his foot to the kisses of the officers and sub-
officers of his faithful army, who were proud to point out the scars and medals they
had earned in his service."
The question as to the defilement which is too likely to have suc-
ceeded the défilé of the Papal Zouaves Artillery, Infantry, and Dragoons,
before the Sovereign Pontiff, succinctly put, is “How about Blacking?”
PIUs had been walking in the grounds of his villa; and we are told
that he “proceeded to the camp on the sea-shore.”. It would seem,
then, that he went to the camp on foot, and if so, he Fº Wore
men's strong walking boots or highlows, for he would have hardly
danced thither in the white satin shoes which (following the steps of
PETER after a fashion) he wears on state occasions, whether with or
without crinoline. . He is not supposed to be in the habit of º:
japanned Balmorals, and it may therefore, be not unreasonably con-
jectured that his upper-leathers had been polished with some equivalent
to Day-and-Martin, or very likely with that identical brilliant prepara-
tion itself out of a testimonial-bottle presented by the S.W. P. or St.
Vincent of Paul Shoeblack Brigade, as a pious oblation, and a specimen
of the genuine article...If the Pope had had his boots or shoes thus
polished, the gallant officers who, each in succession, gave one of them
a kiss, must, for the space which was covered by their salute, have
entirely taken the shine out of it, to the necessary defilement of their
lips, especially those of the first comer, which, if he was an enthusiast
and kissed close, must have been in the state of those of the Children
in the Wood after they had eaten their blackberries, or have resembled
those of a schoolboy who has been sucking Spanish liquorice.

ESSAYS AND REMARKS.
BANTER. Mutual banter is the ordinary conversation of people who
ustly despise one another. If you are a sensible fellow, you will take
º, in good part, and gratify your banterer by lau hing at the fun
which he makes of you, which you will be enabled to do with natural
ease by considering what a ridiculous opinion of his own superiority to
yourself he must entertain to have the impudence of presuming to make
you his butt. -- - -
Banter may irritate a rational man if it take him unawares, as when
he is talking in earnest, so as to confuse and balk him, and thus, like
the zany's foolscap when it stopped the º telescope, put
him into a rage. You will be subject to be ruffled by banter # you
want sufficient presence of mind always, when attacked with it, to think
how stupid you must be to suffer your serenity to be disturbed by an
ass. Still when banter flurries a man and puts him out, it is a con-
siderable bore, and therefore he might well be vexed with his acquain-
tance for mocking him to his face, although he would not care a button
how much they chose to deride him behind his back,
Banter among the lowest class of cabmen, omnibus conductors, and
touters, and the inferior order of thieves, becomes chaff. Chaff is
unbridled banter; insolence worded without , scruple, or restraint;
scorn venting itself in a guffaw....As, in banter, smiling, gentlemen
pleasantly twit one another with follies and foibles; so grinning ruſians,
interchanging chaff, bandy imputations of º . . It is good for a
gentleman to accustom himself to stand chaff, for that will enable him
to sustain banter with complacency.
The Last Fashionable Vice.
ENAMELLING is already on the spread. We suppose the RACHEL, of
this superficial accomplishment will soon copy the example of the
photographers in the cheap neighbourhoods, and place touters at
their doors, whose business it will be to waylay ladies as they go by, and
to tempt them with the insinuating inquiry of, “Please, Mum, will you
have your face enamelled P”

EXHIBITORS AND THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS.
Is it, or is it not, the ſact that our grandly christened International
Exhibition is intended for a sale room as well as for a show place?. In
justice to exhibitors as well as to the public, we really think the actual
truth ought to be known, and as speedily as possible; if it be not in-
decorous to mention such a thing as haste to personages, so exalted as
the Royal Commissioners. At the world-famed Exhibition of 1851
orders, we believe, were allowed to be received, but people could not
offhand buy and take away the goods exhibited. We fancied this wise
rule held good in 1862, and that it was by reason of this proper prohi-
bition that there has been built the International Bazaar, where goods
may be obtained to the pattern of those which are shown across the
way... But it seems we were mistaken, or, if not, there is quite clearly
something wrong in the wording of this notice, which we copy from
the morning papers, merely altering the names of the seller and his
Wares :-
AUTION.—SAMUEL SHOLOMONS, JEWELLER, SILVER-
SMITH, &c. to the QUEEN, begs to CAUTION all persons against making or
selling any articles INFRINGING on his new PATENT for Ebony Jet Jewellery,
and also against i. imitation of his Registered Gold Water-pot. e begs likewise
to inform the public that he has no agents for the sale of the above-mentioned
goods, which are to be obtained only at his establishment, 2,001, Blank Street; and
at his Trophy at the International Exhibition.
Now, if this be really so, if MR. Sholomons' gold water-pot and other
articles of jewellery," are to be obtained at his Trophy, in the Inter:
national Exhibition,” we no longer wonder that the nave is so blockaded
with these Trophies of bad taste, built up as they are to quite the
height of absurdity. A conspicuous position in the Exhibition building
is about the very best site for a shop in all the world, for all the
world, we hear, is .."; to the place. If, then, the articles exhibited
are suffered to be sold there, the ºn.” be regarded as an
exhibition merely, but sinks into a shop. Except in point of size, there
is no difference between it and an ordinary bazaar; and exhibitors
would do wisely to do everything, they can to win the notice of the
public, and hire shopmen with loud voices to proclaim their power to
jeli. If it be permitted to MR. SAMUEL SHOLOMONs to advertise in
newspapers that he enjoys this privilege, why not let the proclamation
be made within the §. and there be given forth, if not with blast
of trumpet, at least with rotund, voice? Had Mr. Punch a º
(which, for his reputation sake, he happily has not) he would, sque:
his shrillest roo-ti-tooit to attract the public ear, and Toby should assist
him with his best bow-wow. If MR. Sholomons be right to advertise
as he has done, why should not MR. SMITH or any other .
hire a Stentor with a * trumpet to stand beside his Trophy, and
bawl out, “Hi! look here! this is the right shop!” We can fancy
what a pleasant vocal concert, there would be, if our hint were only
taken, and all the English show-men were to bellow simultaneously
such shop-cries as the following:—“Now, gents, buy, buy, buy! Here's
your little dustpans and your monster telescopes!. Here's your bran:
new bells, and your fine old crusted obelisks. Hi! hiſ hiſ look here!
Step up and inspect our mammoth muffin-maker! Here's your º
toys for pretty girls and boys! Here’s your steam engines and stom
pumps | | Here’s your hoops and howitzers! Now, my noble Capting,
come and have a squint at our fine five-hundred pounders, bran new
and dirt º and warranted to hit a fly at ten miles' distance. Hi!
look! here! look here!, try our patent sugar-plums, warranted pure
saccharine and to stand a fortnight's sucking without decreasing a
hair's breadth ! Now then, walk up, gents Don't be bashful, ladies 1
Come and see our giant Crinoline, *##". in width, and †: may be
hº up in a common pill-box. Hiſ look here! buy, buy, buy!
ere's your bagpipes cheap! Here's your ducks of bonnets!”
Commercial cries like these might seem perhaps a little out of place
in our Art Palace; but we repeat, if MR. ShoLoMons' advertisement be
suffered, other modes of winning notice surely ought to be allowed'
Devoutly to be Wished.
THE rain-drops are the §. of visitors that have as yet poured
into the International Exhibition, and they came in without paying.
Let us hope that the Shilling. Visitors will come in as freely as the
showers, and save the Guarantors from the disagreeable necessity of
“Posting the Cole.”

PROGRESS OF PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT.
EAR S. G. O., -
SUBJoINED is
part of a milliner's
advertisement, pub-
lished by my fashion.
able contemporary:
“A Parisletter in the
John Bull thus describes
a new style of petticoat
just adopted by the EM-
PREss EUGENIE :—“This
petticoat is made of
cambric muslin, is six
yards in circumference
at the widest point, and
is covered by nine
flounces of still greater
circumference, the low-
est of which is a mere
frill; the second a few
inches longer and con-
siderably wider, com-
pletely covers the first;
the third does the same
to the second, and so on
till one É. flounce
falls *...; etely over the
other eight, each one of
which, to arrive at the
standard of imperial
elegance, must be hem-
stitched like a lady's
pocket - handkerchief,
and the outer one
in addition be nearly
covered with the embroidery done by the women of the Wosges.'"
Then comes the name of the shop where this sweet thing in petticoats,
a pattern of simple elegance, is to be had. I am not at liberty to
publish it, because my valued, subscriber, PATERFAMILIAs, would
rhaps not thank me for affording that information to his wife and
ughters. . I know what he will say when he comes to read, the fore-
going description of the “new style of petticoat,” alleged to have been
just adopted by the EMPREss EugéNIE. He will say:-" Bless the
woman! What next?, Qf course she will never rest satisfied with a
petticoat only six yards in circumference without the flounces. Six
yards?—pooh!—she’ll immediately make it nine, and from nine to
twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, and square the present number, No
more than nine flounces? º; Female workhouse regulation
uniform. She must have eighteen forthwith, and ultimately eighty-
one, if she can find room for them, hem stitched and embroidered every
one. PATERFAMILIAs may be interested to know, as º these
petticoats, that the advertising milliner is “prepared to supply, them
with or without the expensive addition of hem-stich and embroidery.”
If, he should determine on treating MATERFAMILIAs and the young
ladies to one apiece, he will probably be so liberal as to elect petticoats
with and not without those additions which an uncommonly reasonable
milliner ingenuously calls expensive. - -
Expense is evidently an object in the construction of this new style
of petticoat. Although one great flounce falls º over the
other eight, and therefore hides them, that great flounce is the only one
both embroidered and hemºstitched. The others are § hem-stitched;
and since they cannot be seen, they might just as well be embroidered
too : but for considerations of economy. -
But why do I address myself to you, my dear S. G. O., about petti-
coats? Have I any cause to imagine that you are any particular judge
or authority on that subject P No.; for you are, I believe, no vestment-
fancying Puseyite ; but as a philanthropist, and philogynist in the
higher sense of the word, you are interested in the employment-of-
women question, and I should like to know whether you don’t, think
the #. glut of spinsters may be in some measure connected with
the dimensions and cost of female apparel, and is likely to increase in
proportion as the EMPREss of THE FRENch goes on extending the
circumference of her skirts 2 -

A Decided Bloomer.
MADAME RACHEL, the ladies’ enamellist, fired by the example of MR.
GIBSON, sent a contribution to the Exhibition. It was a model of the
modern Tinted Venus. It was highly coloured, of course—the flesh
tints being faithfully copied from a celebrated living Marchioness. It
Was ... however, by the Commissioners—and we must say it is
the only wise thing they have been successful as yet in carrying out.

APPEAL TO MRS. HARRIS.
PRAY, Goody, º: to aggravate the rancour of your tongue,
Still ; sparks of fury from your eyes;
Remember the galled jade doth wince, tº show her withers wrung,
hen she raves about libels and lies.
Ply me, try me,
Do, Ma'am, do decry me !
Foul air, past me,
Meant to blast me,
Innocently flies.
MRS. HARRIS'S APOLOGY.
My name is BECKY’ARRIs, and which England is my nation,
Billingsgate was my § but Shoe Lane’s my 'abitation.
I used to be respectable, tho' subjick to derigion.
By reason as my principles was Gin and True Religion.
I once was ſppence you must know, and now I’m but a penny.
I does a deal of dirty work, am 'appy to get any.
I goes to the Conservative Club, %. lights the fires,
Or serves any other purpose as the Derbyites requires.
To MALMESBURY's and NoFMANBY’s I hoften goes a charin',
For which I’ve changed my colours, now true blue no longer wearin', .
Now my cloak is Popy scarlet, and my gownd is Naples yeller,
With my old coalscuttle bonnét, and my gingham humbareller.
THE INDIFFERENCE OF LAMBETH.
THE electors of Lambeth, must have been amused by the following
remark made to them on the hustings by MR. SLEIGH:—
“The smallness of the numbers who voted showed that there was 5..."; political
#. in the borough, and proved the necessity for an extension of the franchise.
e had reflected on this subject since the termination of the contest, and as the
franchiso was a trust, he thought it should be accompanied by the condition, that
every voter should record his opinion under some pecuniary fine if he did not do so,
such fine to go to the expenses of the election."
It does not seem to have occurred to MR. SLEIGII that the opinion,
which the electors who abstained from voting either for himself or his
opponents would have recorded under a penalty would possibly have
been that there was not a pin to choose between the several jiàº.
If, as he says, the politicaſ a º prevalent in the º shows the
necessity for an extension of the franchise, excess of supply is the thing
to create demand, and the proper cure for defect of appetite is increase
of the meat which it declines to feed on.
THE CRANIOLOGY OF RACE.
According to a report of the last meeting of the Ethnological
Society, in the course of a discussion which took *i. on a paper read
by MR. BLAKE, about the character of Peruvian skulls:—
“MR. CRAwfurd strongly expressed the opinion that it is useless to attempt to
define differences between the races of man by an examination of their skulls, and
he alluded to the mistake committed by a celebrated anatomist, who pronounced
the skull of a Scotchman to be that of a negro."
Yes; but the anatomist may not have been so very far out, after all.
Perhaps the Scotchman was a BLACKIE.
A Narrowing Spectacle.
ONE of the domes in the Brick Palace is screened by a tremendous
awning, which effectually masks its height, and altogether dwarfs its
proportions. It was scarcely worth while to go to the labour of such
vast dimensions, if they were afterwards to be covered up. A common
dome, like the one that squats on the top of the Royal *...* would
have answered the same purpose. However, from the above fact, and
also from the general parsimony and shabbiness of the Royal Commis-
sioners, we should say it was a question with the Exhibition of Re
angustaº 4. -
The Heat of Academic Genius.
“WHAT is the cause of that water smoking P’ inquired a French-
man, pointing to one of the basins in Trafalgar Square., “Mon cher,
Monsieur,” answered the Englishman, “it is heated by the R. As of
the Royal Academy.” Mossieu didn't see it.
“THE LASTWoRDs or PITT.”—We can settle this disputed question.
We were passing by the Lyceum Theatre the other evening, and (we
always make a point of speaking by the board) the last words were
“PITT's FULL.”

DISRAELI’S STORIES.
WITH reference to the Ex-CHANCELLOR or THE "Ex-
chEQUER, LoRD PALMERSTON is reported to have thus
spoken in repy to that honest, upright, and straightforward
statesman's attack on the foreign policy of HER MAJESTY's
Government:—
“I utterly and entirely deny every word that the righthon. gentle-
man has said as to hostility, bickering, and quarrels between the two
nations. (Hear.) Whence he gets his information I cannot, of course,
É. to say, but I advise him to receive with great distrust any
nformation he may receive from the same quarter again. (Cheers
and Laughter.)”
No doubt MR. DISRAELI spoke from the same inspira-
tion as that which dictated his works, which are works of
imagination. His literary fame bids fair to be matched by
his reputation as an orator. He evidently derives his
intelligence from his genius; and as the man of genius
always, has faith in himself, he will probably continue, in
spite of the PREMIER's advice, to believe as implicitly as
he now does, every word of the information he may receive
from that trustworthy quarter.

WANTS OF THE WORLD'S FAIR.
THE want of order and arrangement for which the
International Exhibition has acquired a world-wide cele-
brity; the reputation for bad and dear refreshment, which
it has so deservedly gained; the want of labels appended
to the F. the bulk and weight of the catalogue
which the visitor is, therefore, obliged to lug about with
him: these and other characteristics, equally agreeable, of
the Brompton World's Fair, will probably render necessary,
as a condition to its success, the engagement of BlonDIN.
Then, however, inconveniently crowded may be the inter-
stices of the Show, the visitors, with the funambulist over
their heads, will at least have something to see for their
money.

Control Your Indignation.
WE must not be surprised at MR, WHALLEY taking such
unhealthy views of subjects, “What can you expect
(tenderly inquires our friend HADFIELD) from such a
confirmed WHALLEY-tudinarian?” Echo answers nothing.
THE DREAM AND THE REALITY.
(A Private View of the Royal Academy, suggested by that Body’s recent
Erhibition of itself.)
We are blessed with a Royal Academy of Arts, which includes forty
Academicians, and twenty Associates; which receives annually some
£9000 from an exhibition of painting and sculpture, produced by its
members and the º of British artists, and is quartered in an
extremely mean public building, in an extremely mean square, built on
one of the noblest sites of London. In front of this mean building is a
pair of still meaner ſountains, with hot water laid on to them, in
thoughtful consideration of the wants of the Academy, whether for
washing the members' own dirty-linen, for cleaning their hands (which
as painting is º work, cannot be expected to be always spotless), or
for using in their frequent interchange of amenities with outside artists,
or such organs of the British Public as stubborn Members of Parlia:
ment, and irreverent newspapers. As if still further to consult the
feelings of the Academy, the mean square, which is bordered by the
mean building appropriated to them, and ornamented by the mean hot-
water º: already referred to, is decorated with works of Art, prin-
cipally the productions of Academicians, which are meaner than either
the square, the º or the fountains. It might be thought that
the climax of meanness had been attained by these statues.
But, in that mean building of this mean square, behind those mean
fountains, and those still meaner statues, sits a body meaner in its col-
lective character (for individually those who compose it are men no
better and no worse than their fellows of the same classes and callings),
than square, building, fountains, , and statues, all together. Nor is
this Academy meaner in its local habitation than in all else belonging
to it. It is mean, in the spirit which has animated its councils from
its first, establishment; mean in its schools; mean very often in
the quality of the Art it has most fostered and engendered; mean
in the mode of admission to its honours; mean in the self-seeking
spirit of its rules of exhibition; mean in its treatment of the greatest
men who have belonged to it, and still more, of the painters outside
its pale; mean in the cliques which divide its own ranks, and the
jealousies which distract its councils... But it reaches the climax of
meanness once a-year—at its Annual Dinner—and at this year's dinner
it has capped the climax of meanness reached by all the dinners of all
the years since first the Academy dined together.
This Academy dinner is like the banquet which the poor lunatic,
whose story is told by SIRWALTER Scott, used to be set down to every
day in his cell at the asylum. He fancied his table spread with a
magnificent dinner of three courses, and eat of this imaginary feast
with great gusto; but “somehow,” he used to whisper to his visitors,
“everything tastes of porridge.”. So, at the Academy dinner every-
thing tastes of toads. And besides this arrangement of everythin
crapaudine, a universal sauce of flummery and melted butter is pou
over every plat from the toad-stool soup to the celery a la jus de crapaud.
No wonder that on these dining days, a faint, odour of Lord-worship
may be detected steaming from between the pillars of MR. WILLIAMs's
portico, almost as º: as the rich fragrance of roast meat
and gravy-soup from the underground kitchens before SIMPson's or
SAwyer and STRANGE's.
I had been reading the report of the year's Academy dinner, and had
fallen into a slumber, partly provoked by the placid flow of the Presi.
dent's eloquence, partly, by the faint fumes of the incense offered up
before the lords * gentlemen who deign to attend the board of these.
'umble artists, and partly by the monstrous koo-too, which I seemed
to my mind's eye to see some forty R. A.'s performing, slowly and
#. in the pauses of SIR CHARLEs’s measured flow of flat com-
pliment.
So I º: and I dreamed. And in º,
Royal Academy dinner, 1862, and behold I saw the President in
scarlet gown and his gold chain and medal, genial, affable, and joyous,
advancing with a brisk step, and a bright smile to welcome the distin-
uished foreign artists and men of letters brought to London by the
nternational Exhibition. To MEYERBEER, SIR CHARLEs EASTLAKE
aid a graceful compliment on the kinship of the Arts of Painting and

in exchange for a friend's violoncello; and “zolosing,” said the musician,
who is Israelite as well as Immo “by de in.”
I was delighted to see the cordial way in which IEys, the great
master of the Belgian school, (whose invitation to the dinner was but a
r and partial return, SIR CHARLEs assured him, for the profuse
onour and hospitality extended to the members of our own Academy
who last year visited the great picture exhibition at Antwerp,) was
welcomed by MILLAIs, Egg and ELMORE, WARD, and a host of our
historical painters, and what hearty cheery handshakings (which might
have been longer) passed between M.TIDEMAND, the honest, but
rofoundly earnest and tender painter of those scenes of common Norse
#. which are the chief ornaments of the Scandinavian Gallery at the
International Exhibition, and our own WEBSTER, FAED, FRITH, Hook,
and others. Nor was it less pleasant to see the kindly greetings ex-
changed between the foreign critics and men of letters—Théophile
GAUTIER, CHARLEs BLANC, Louis VIARDOT, JoHN LEMOINE, CARL
HARTMANN, and others of their confrères only less distinguished
charged to pass in review the noble collection of the pictures of all
schools and races now open at South Kensington—their hosts of the
Academy, and their English brother authors and men of letters, who
filled so large a place at the Academy's hospitable board. “This is
indeed,” I said to myself, “the visible acknowledgment of the brother:
hood which links the various Arts among themselves, and Artists of all
countries with each other. Happy the country that boasts an Academy
so prompt to open its doors to foreign merit, and so ready to express
by the honour it pays to intelligence and distinction at home in the
sister Arts of Painting and Literature, its thorough comprehension of
the tie that holds them all altogether'
“Had we been the nation of shopkeepers that foreign sarcasm rejoices
to prove us, should we see these tables, thus surrounded? It is well
that wealth at length, united with culture (tardy though the union
may have been) should be represented, as I see it here, by these worthy,
hard-headed, north country and Birmingham manufacturers, who have
replaced the aristocracy as patrons of the Arts, and in whom the Artist
finds far more liberal as well as punctualº: than ever he did
in the few Lords who have condescended to give, a modern picture a
place upon their walls! It is well that the hard-headed, hard-handed,
working Genius of our nation should meet, in the persons of these our
modern, if less magnificent, MEDICI of Leeds and Manchester, of Bir-
mingham and º with the Ministers and Statesmen, who owe
their invitations to this table less to their rank and titles, than to their
public services, and their well-won distinctions.
“Here, at one º public, dinner, at least, the snobbishness of
John BULL succumbs to the liberalising influence of the Fine Arts.
Here, the power of brain, asserts its right to its own place, not lower
than that jº to official distinction, or the proudest titular rank.
Here, ins of the Muse of Literature being thrust into the back
round, she is enthroned by the side of her sister Muses, Painting
ture, and Architecture, and bears, her pen-sceptre at an equal
; with those of the pencil, the modelling tool, and the porte-crayon,
instead of limping lamely in to acknowledge herself at the taiſ of
a string of threadbare toasts—the Army and the Navy, the dignitaries of
the State, and the dignitaries of the Church, the Lord MAYOR and the
Aldermen, our Visitors, and our noble selves, the Stewards and the
Ladies, fetters are honoured only, after the Sovereign, and the
Sovereign's Servants, her Ministers”. ... I was going on, when I
was interrupted by a burst of laughter—the expression of my own half-
conscious amusement (as one lobe of the brain will comment on the
other) at the contrast F.; in obedience to the laws of association,
by the reality and the fancies of my dreams.
The newspaper. reports of the Academy dinner lay before me, with
its small list of distinguished Statesmen, its long bead-roll of Titled
Nobodies who never bought a Fº or gave a commission to a painter;
its absence of every one of the distinguished artists rare chance
assembled in London; its ignoring of foreign letters, and its scanty recog:
nition of the respect due to native literature; its utter passing by of
the claims of the sister Arts—Music and the Drama; the fulsome
fulness of its laudations of all who can influence its fortunes by favour;
its sycophancy of rank and title and outward influence, and that in the
face of a series of cool contemptuous disclaimers of all knowledge or
interest in Art by the men before whom in succession the Academic
speaker knocked his forehead on the ground; and lastly, as if to sum
P in one unmeaning act the stupid snobbishness that marks the whole
of this Academic, entertainment; the toast, of “Literature and its
}. and influences on Art,” relegated to the very end of the
east, whenevery other institution which it can enter into the heart of
a respectful and awe-stricken Academician to bow down to has been
honoured, and when the lordly guests whom the bad dinner has dis-
agreed with, or, the President's eloquence has bored, have left the
spaces at the tables, lately filled by their august heads, vacant!
... Ah! if Mr. Punch could only stoop to attend an Academy dinner, and
if the President would only º: him to propose that toast in that com-
pany and in that place, the Academy walls should hear for once what
†. hear, except when the members are privately and confi-
dentially expressing their opinions of each other—a # of truth!
PUNCHII, CRACEM PACEM PETENTIS PALINODIA.
OF late Punch did arraign,
In a contemptuous strain,
The sheds and domes that FowkE has dared to rear;
Nor for this doth Punch repent,
Since all he said he meant,
And bad architect may be good engineer.
But the same immortal lines
That poked fun at Fowke's designs,
On CRACE's colour passed a scornful sentence,
Which fairer observation
s that teacher of the nation,
To recant upon more adequate acquaintance.
Only blameworthy is CRAce,
That on FowkE he put a face,
And gave colour to his bald array of girders;
For thus aiding and abetting,
The structure by its setting
He shares the guilt of Fowke's cruel murders.
FowkE, who quashed Invention's note,
Cut fair Proportion's throat
Smothered Symmetry beneath two big bell-glasses,
Starved poor Beauty in his sheds,
(Frames for huge cucumber-beds,)
Taste to the tails of four wild asses |
Had CRACE but made dull duller,
To the building squared the colour,
Murdered Muses he'd avenged, and slaughtered Graces;
hereas now by artful tinting,
He beguiles eyes into hinting -
Thoughts of beauty, where it clearly out of place is.
For that I should have thrashed him, w
For that I should have lashed him,
For not sinking to the depth of the occasion,
Crowning structure sad and stingy,
With colour drab and dingy—
And for “dec” giving de-dec-oration.
So Punch be
And tied
hereby to cancel
What he said of CRACE's stencil,
And owns he’s been fairly ta'en to task for it;
But reserves leave, pace CRACE,
. To regret Fowke's .# face
Should in CRACE's cunning co
our find a mask for it.
A Small Joke made at the Opening of the Great Exhibition.
AsKED the wife of a Provincial Mayor, of a stingy disposition, as she
clad him in his fur-fringed robes upon the morning of May-Day, before
he went to Court—that is, to the Procession Court—“Tell me, TIM-
MINs, if thou can'st, why dost thou resemble the ‘beloved star' named
in that pretty nigger song thou gavest me last week?. Nay, dearest,
don't look dummy! 'Tis because “thou art so near, and yet so fur !””
A cAution. To the Roy AL COMMISSIONERS.
LET them clear out the Naye as soon as possible if they value their
receipts. The International Exhibition Building is not the first over-
grown body that has sunk rapidly under a-trophy.

LOVE IN A HAZE.

both man and woman was to be always moving ratory resolutions

In the eyes of all spirited ladies.

ENGLISH MANNERS TO THE FRENCH MIND.
THANKs to the polite attention of some of our lively yisitors, correspondents of
certain Parisian journals, we enjoy the advantage, which RoBERT BURNs desired,
of seeing ourselves as others see us. We may acknowledge the favour in enabling
them to see us as we see ourselves. -
They say that we all look sad, and are wholly absorbed in an eager and incessant
endeavour to get money. To the sordid anxiety by which we are thus actuated they
ascribe our dull and miserable looks. There is some truth in this. . It is not, how-
ever, that we are avaricious, like some people who are always talking about fifty-
thousand francs. We are melancholy precisely for the reason that we are com:
pelled, against our will, to devote our whole souls to acquiring wealth; a pursuit
which is repugnant to our noble natures. We are obliged to make all the money
we can, in order to live decently and educate our children, under the pressure of a
crushing Income-Tax. All this load of taxation we have to bear from the necessity
of providing no end of national defences, imposed upon us, by those neighbours
who persist in maintaining immense armaments, not only military but also naval,
which can only be intended against ourselves. -
Our French critics are amused in remarking the taciturnity of English fellow.
passengers and travellers who are mutual strangers, associated in railway-carriages
and hotels. One of these writers says that Englishmen, waiting about in a coffee-
room, all seem trying to get away from each other. That is no doubt their wish;
and it is a proof of our politeness. Thinking men have all some trouble, present
or º and don’t want to inflict their dulness upon other people with
whom they have no right to take such a liberty. We converse, fast enough when
we are all friends, and can grumble one with another. The fact that we are thinking
men is iust that which the Frenchman overlooks. He cannot conceive a number
of people meeting together without instantly indulging the gregarious, impulse to
chatter. It does not occur to him that a man’s mind may possibly be *R.
with other things than the present moment and surrounding circumstances. Nor
has he any idea that men can be silent because of not liking to talk unless they
have something to say, beyond that which, if said to themselves, they would think
not worth hearing. No doubt a monkey, if he possessed the gift of speech, would
exercise it instinctively without reflection, and, when he came to find that we do not
do likewise, would feel just the same astonishment at our silence as that which is
expressed by the French journalist.
WHAT would BE THE MOST PROFITABLE TAx OF ALL-A Tax on Donkeys.
“GOING OUT A-SHOOTING."
The LORD CHANCELLOR, for the House of Lords, has accepted
a challenge from the SPEAKER, on behalf of the House of
Commons, to shoot a rifle-match on July 5th, at Wimble-
don, ten against ten.
IN ancient times with good yew-bows,
Our ancestors contended
And Agincourt displayed the sport,
When cloth-yard shafts descended.
But now the rifle takes its range,
From Wimbledon to Tooting,
And everybody, high and low,
Is going out a-shooting.
The Scotch and Irish have their corps;
The Devil's Own enrolled are;
SHOOLBRED’s and Swan AND EDGAR's men
For measures Enfields shoulder;
Each Civil Service Clerk turns out,
A military suit in,
The Artists fling their maulsticks down
For ramrods, to go shooting.
Where matches are on carpets thrown,
Of course the fire it catches,
Now, “on the tapis" everywhere,
We’ve nought but rifle-matches;
Of companies and regiments,
The champions are disputing,
And soon Britannia’s going out
With Caledonia shooting.
No wonder that the flame should spread,
Nor, as all fire keeps rising,
That it should reach the “Upper Ten,”
Can it be thought surprising;
Nor, howsoe'er old fogeydom
Such contest vote unsuiting,
That Lords and Commons like the rest,
Are going out a-shooting.
To see the Speaker, velvet shorts,
And fair full-bottomed wig in,
Arrayed against LORD.WESTBURY, ,
His Chancellor’s full-fig in
“Take me that bauble hence 1” cries D.,
For rifle mace commuting,
While on the wool-sack taking sights,
LoRD WESTB’RY dreams of shooting.
Let’s hope like youthful spouse, immersed
n his new match’s blisses,

204 PUNCH, OR THE
[MAY 24, 1862.
LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SKETCH NEAR LEICESTER SQUARE.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAY 12th, Monday. New Knight of the Garter Lorp Shaftesbury,
very properly called the attention of the House of Lords to the distress
among the i.i. workpeople, and while bearing tribute to the
admirable way in which their sufferings were endured, expressed his
wish for the relaxation of the labour test. This, the condition on which
poor law relief is granted, the Earl objected to as calculated to injure
the hands of those who obtain their living by more delicate wor
than that given by the Unions. LoRD GRAN VILLE said that the
question was being dealt with practically, and LQRD DERby spoke
warmly of the behaviour of the people, and declared his own belief to
- º Y.
be that greater distress was prevailing than the suffering districts had
ever previously undergone. With such a state of things existing, any
incident that seems to help on the American War to an end, or at least
to a crisis, is welcome, and the tidings that New Orleans has fallen is
doubly satisfactory.
LoRD CLANRICARDE and other Irishmen are extremely dissatisfied
with the River Shannon, and LoRD CANARD, or GRANARD, or some
such personage (where’s Dod? O, seventh Earl, the fourth was a dis;
tinguished j". no, was brother to a distinguished, admiral
who beat the fleets of Erance and Spain in 1743–very good reason,
the brother should have been Earled and pearled, but
oes not make it so clear why number seven should be anybody)
threatened all sorts of vengeance on the poor river, and LoRD GRAN:
VILLE blew him up, and said he must have a weak cause or he would
not use such strong language. A Committee is to sit on the Shannon,
and if the weather is fine, and the Committee may fish and smoke, it
will not be unjolly. LoRD DERBY's Smell Committee was appointed,
and it now appears that the grievance to be looked, into is a real one,
and thal people and land are largely poisoned by the eructations from
certain manufactories, those of soda for instance, for Soda and Man do
not agree. It is not proposed, to prevent, the manufactures, but to
invent remedies for the evil, and possibly MR. FARADAY and some of
his friends may illuminate the Lords on the subject. At Glasgow the
nuisance has been dealt with already—one gentleman who transmutes
defunct horses, and another gentleman who makes chemical evil odours,
having erected chimneys which are as high as the Great Pyramid, and
which project their smells right into the face of the moon, thereby not
only making St. Mungo comfortable, but illustrating the archer's
º in the old play that he has “sent his Shaft into scared Dian's
Orb.
MR. CowPER stated that he should not let cabs go through the lower
part of Hyde Park, near Park Lane, in order to relieve the traffic in
the latter, which he said ought to be widened. Of course it ought, but
does he think that it will widen itself, or grow wider by having too
much put into it, like a dining-out gentleman's interior *
MR. LAYARD begged that people would not believe in telegrams that
come vić Vienna, and tell of Turkish reverses. He said that he did
not know whether such things were sent for stockjobbing purposes or
not, meaning that he knew perfectly well that they were, and who send
them. It may be convenient to explain that the Moutenegrins, who
are nominally under the protection of Austria, are perpetually annoying
their neighbours the Turks, and OMER PACHA, who gave them a ter.
ible wopping some nine years ago, is likely to do it again, if the
vages do not become quiet. There can be no sentimental pity for
k|not do a hundredth part of the mischief to the Church that one ridicu-
these Black Mountaineers, for they kill prisoners, carry about heads
as trophies, and make their women the “beasts of burden.”
A Budget debate followed, and MR. GLADstone surrendered on the
question of compelling private persons to take out licences if they want
to brew. LoRD PUNCH, of course, takes Amontillado with his dinner,
and Lafitte, at two hundred shillings, after i, but he has heard that
there are vulgarians who like beer, and if they derive any pleasure from
knowing that no new obstacle is to be opposed to their obtaining this
drink, he is happy, he is sure, to inform #. that their pails, or what-
ever they mix it in, are not to be interfered with. There was also a
discussion about selling beer at races and fairs, a subject, LoRD Punch
supposes, interesting to the lower creation, but on which he will not
venture to give an opinion—so far as he understands the matter, MR.
GLADstone, urged to prevent the lower orders from º: more
than they now do, interposed some justices' certificate between the mob
and the beer-trough—the eau de Cologne, if you please—thank §:
LoRD P. *...". he had done with such a topic but remembers
that a drawback of seven shillings per hundredweight is to be allowed
on British hops, whatever they are. Ops was the mother of CEREs,
which accounts for the Series of grievances connected with 'ops.
Then came up a real grievance—the conduct of the ſellows who levy the
Income-Tax, and who charge a great deal more than even the iniquitous
law permits, in the hope that folks will not take the trouble to appeal.
Some of the Members said that this was less the fault of the officials
than of the Government, who had ordered them to put on the screw,
but MR. GLADSTONE declared that this was not the case. He refused,
however, to give any remedy, even to people who had been abomi-
nably, surcharged, and had, on appeal, convicted the officials of
cheating.
Tuesday. Late in February, our friend MR, HADFIELD, of Sheffield
(who loves Mr. Punch with an intensity that does credit to H'sed an
art,) got a little victory, as Mr. Punch mentioned at the time. He carried
a Bill for doing away with the declaration which provincial mayors and
aldermen, on taking office, have to make that they will not destroy the
Church of England. The undertaking seems a little ridiculous, because
the united efforts of all the mayors and corporations in England would
lous bigot of a parson, or one -dealing clerical Justice could inflict.
But the Dissenters are rather up in the stilts just now, because it is
just two hundred years since a mass of clergymen (who would have
repudiated the name of Dissenter) were turned out of the Church, and
Little BETHEL, EBENEZER, and MAHERSHALALHAsHBAz claim ques-
tionable, descent from these 2000 martyrs, , , Argal, the Dissenters
are making all the political demonstrations which they can, and this Bill
of MR. HADFIELD's was one of the demonstrations. The Lords do
not seem, curiously, to make sufficient allowance for the excitement of
the Sects, and incontinently threw out the Bill by 87 to 55. The
Bishop of WINchestER, Dr. CHARLEs SUMNER, brother of the Primate
and Prelate of the Garter, went into the content lobby, as was point
out by LoRD CLANRICARDE, naturally astounded at seeing a Bishop
come near him, and it turned out that DR. SUMNER had made a mistake,
and was discontent. In order to rectify the error, the Lotto CuANCEL-
LoR asked that, Bishop the three sensible questions which are put on
occasion of such accidents in the Commons, whereat the Duke of
BuccLEUCH took upon himself to fly into a passion, and scold the
Chancellor for daring to catechise a Bishop. The descendant of Lucy
WALTERs is quite º to stand up for the clergy. The Chancellor's
smiling apology was slightly sarcastic in its humility.
The Post Office Savings Bank is too good an institution for Mr.
Punch to permit its efficiency to be impaired by any official shabbiness,
and he was glad to hear FREDERick PEEL say that the Postmasters
were to be remunerated for the increased duties thrown upon them–
that is, he did not say so, because an official can never speak in a
straightforward manner, but his answer meant it. Why, in obedience
to Mr. Punch's suggestion, the saving people of England have deposited
no less than £735,253 (or nearly a quarter of Mr. Punch's annual
profits) in these banks. That does not look as if they thought that
what DR. CUMMING thinks—well, says—is true, about the speedy
extinction of this unfortunate planet.
QUIDNUNc D. GRIFFITH again. He wanted to know why PRINCE
NApoleon had gone to Pompeii. Mr. LAYARD wittily told him that
there were many objects of interest just now in Naples, and that any-
thing else he might learn from the Moniteur. MR. GRIFFITH is Member
for that clean and pretty town, Devizes, and in the middle of that
town he will see a monument that should warn persons against rash
utterances. W. S.
CAPTAIN Coles, of the Cupolas (not Cole, C. B. of the Domes)
complains, in type, that his inventions are not being fairly treated by
the Admiralty. Loºp CiArence Paget complains, in the House,
that Coles, being on full pay, should write to the Times, and moreover,
denies the charge officially. Knowing the sweet readiness of the
Admiralty to assist inventors, and the fair play invariably shown by
officials to outsiders, we are astonished at Captain Cupola's hard
heartedness in making such an allegation—nevertheless it is &. as
well that it has been made. Then came a dispute about the Hull Citadel.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
which Members thought meant the Cu
not to refer to a floating hull, but to
was not important.
Then did MR. HuBBARD once more gallantly assail the Income Tax,
and debate at considerable length upon its iniquity. Him did M.R.
GLADstoNF answer with the usual outrageous pleas, and offensive
sarcasms. Were it not, O PEELIDEs, manlier to admit that the tax is
wicked, but that under the exceptional circumstances of our finance,
we must all bear it, somehow, until it can be removed altogether. Why
insult those who are robbed, why offer Qld Bailey defence of a palpable
theft P You are a great orator, so was CICERo, so is Cox, and Cicero
observes, in language which is familiar to Cox, if not to you, “Nihil
term incredibile est, quod non dicendo flat probabile, nihil tam horridum,
fan incultum, quod non splendescat oratione, et tanguam ercolatur.” But
we allege, and Cox agrees with us, that the exception to this rule is
your eloquence about the Income-Tax, and you can do nothing with
that ugly and repugnant theme. Put your pistol to our head in a
melancholy manner, and take our money, but do not preach to us upon
the desirability of the transfer. M.R. HuBBARD took a division on his
resolution, which went to the doing away some of the wrong, and he was,
of course, beaten, getting 62 against 99 votes. . But the battle will be
renewed again and again, and will be won some day.
The rest of the evening's performances were trivial, but we may
remark—the Scotch public houses Bill being the peg—that the generous
declaration by MR. Bucha NAN, of Glasgow, touching the convivial
habits of his constituents, has doubtless delighted many of them, but
#.Kisatia: howls as follows at a Temperance Meeting in the City
la again, but the affair proved
ull in Yorkshire—the squabble
**Was our Member of Parliament in earnest when he made that statement the
other night in a Committee of the whole House on the Public Houses Bill? Oh
my country, what are we to think of thee, when thus spoken of by one of our city
Members? Alas! alas ! for the land of the Covenant and the Martyrs.”
This wretched plebeian evidently does not understand that it is per-
fectly right for gentlemen (of whom MR. BUCHANAN spoke) to do as
they like in the little matter of tipple, but that the lower orders ought
to be forbidden anything stronger than water or Temperance speeches.
Wednesday. This was a woful day for Little Bethel. To-day had
been fixed for the battle on SIR John TRELAwNY’s Bill for the
Abolition of Church Rates. Every decent compromise has been offered
to Dissent, in connection with this subject, and, notably, it has been
proposed that no person, who will state in writing that he is a Dissenter,
shall be charged with the rate. What more an honest opponent of the
impost could want it is hard to say; but, if you please, these gentlemen
who on all ordinary occasions glory in the name of Dissenter, object to
be “ticketed,” as they call it, and insist upon a law for preventing
Churchmen from paying the rate. This is thought to be carrying the
principle of civil and religious liberty a little too far, so the Church
arty rallied, and a close thing was expected. Close, because numerous
“independent” Members are compelled to swallowaclap-trapundertaking
to vote against the rate, and there are some pledges a Member is obliged
to redeem. The debate was of little consequence, except that all parties
stormed at Government for not taking up a question of so much
interest, but the division was of considerable consequence. SIR John
TRELAwNY's Bill was rejected by 289 to 288, and the cheering of the
victors might have been }. at York Minster. To show how well
the whip had been used, see here. The above numbers, with our friend
MR. DENISON, make 578, and there were 16 pairs, which make 32, and,
with the foregoing number, 610, which is a very handsome sum on
account of the 658. RouxDELL PALMER and GLADSTONE voted against
the Dissenters, and the PEELs divided against one another, the bold
ROBERT going Church and the meek FREDERIck going Chapel. Now
the name BRAINTREE will come up again, with a new significance,
that word indicating the decision by which it was settled that a
majority should bind a minority in a parish on a question of rates.
But the minority wish to bind the majority in the country, and we
cannot let the Dissenters º Act of Uniformity.
Thursday. War is proclaimed between the two Houses. The SPEAKER
and ten Commoners have defied the CHANCELLOR and ten Lords to
meet them at Wimbledon, where the rifle shall settle their respective
merits. The daring DENIson's defiance was instantly accepted by the
warlike WesTBURY. So stood the matter for two days, to the Delight
of Mankind. But, respice finem.
A Kentish family of “notorious poachers,” who have been convicted
| about twenty times, and one of whom writes to a contemporary, coolly
stating that he stole partridges “because he was out of employment,”
being far too haughly to accept the humble contributions of the payers
of }.º. had set a child to snare game. The child was detected
and the Maidstone magistrates imposed a heavy fine, avowedly intended
for the punishment of the parents, who paid it, and said that they would
have done so had it been three times as heavy. Meantime, there was
a great burst of virtuous indignation about .# a child to
prison, and one soft-hearted goose sent up the amount to the poachers,
without inquiry, probably neglecting some really meritorious needy
person near him—so much pleasanter is sentimentalibus than honest
charity. SIR GEORGE GREY was interrogated on the subject by the
patriot D1GBY SEYMoUR, and gave this explanation, for which the
Gushers might have waited.
The Bill, for amending the Shipping Acts was considered in Com-
mittee, and much objection was made to the system compelling captains
to take pilots on board, whether wanted or not. Qur friend Cox took
really a sensible view of the case, and complained that if a pilot were on
board and a ship injured a barge in the river, no action would lie, except
against the pilot, who probably had not a shilling. There is much to
be said on both sides, and the question involves something besides
money.
Friday. The Delight of Mankind was somewhat checked by a conver-
sation in the House of Commons upon the subject of the Rifle Challenge.
The SPEAKER declared that he sliould never have thought of taking
such a liberty as to challenge the CHANcellor, that Lord Elcho, who
thinks of nothing but rifles and volunteering, came up bothering him
when he was busy, and that he made some joking answer which the
* Elcho took au sérieur, and walked off with to the Lords.
ut it was not yet made clear whether the match was to come off.
Why not?
In compliance with Mr. Punch's directions, a question was put about
the Suez Canal, but the answer was not very explicit, except that it is
clear that the French have prevailed on the Pasha to give them “forced
labour,” that is, to make the unhappy natives work whether they like
or not, and for nominal pay. A particularly uninteresting personal quarrel
over, the character of a gentleman who was chairman of what is
facetiously called the Westminster Improvement Committee, and who
has been succeeded by the eminent architect, MR. Tite, occupied some
time; and finally MR, BAXTER very nearly got a vote of £90,000, for
the fortification of Alderney, knocked off, an impassioned appeal by
LORD PALMeRSTON saving the vote by a majority of 8 only in a house
of 268. This is close shaving, gentlemen of the Ministry—mind you
don’t cut yourselves one of these days.
PROGRESS AND DEWASTATION.
(Dedicated to LoRD DERBY.)
Huge factory chimneys, in each lovely place,
Belch out their foul smoke over Nature's fair face.
The soot of the ſurnace begrimes the May bloom,
The reeking “Plant” taints every blossom's perfume.
The streams, that were crystal, pollution imbrowns
With the refuse of “Works” and the sewage of towns,
And the angler no more strolls along on the brink
Of the once pleasant river that now is a sink.
For the fish there are poisoned, trout, grayling, roach, dace,
From pike down to minnow, the whole inny race.
And the spirit of old Isa Ac WALtoN hath fled
The banks now by rats alone haunted instead.
Wast chemical workshops on all sides abound,
Diffusing the breath of corrosion around; -
And their fumes, worse than locusts in swarms on the wing,
Blast, utterly, tree, herb, and every green thing.
If the struggle for life, our engrossing employ,
All that makes life worth living at length must destroy,
Cannot Science at least save some "...i. and flowers
To last the short time that remains to be ours?

ST. JANUARIUS FOR ITALY!
To the Editor of the “Tablet.”
SIR,
WILL you allow me to ask you how
you account, for this?, I mean the fact
attested in the subjoined passage out of a
letter from Naples, which appeared in the
Siècle a few days ago:—
“The King, accompanied by his aſdes-de-camp
| and by his military household, went .# in
eat state to the cathedral, where the miracle of the
| iquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, after
having once taken place at Santa Chiara, is repeated
for eight consecutive days. The King presented to
the treasurer a magnificent diamond cross of the
|value of 100,000 fr. "The saint, enchanted as it would
appear at this present, accomplished his miracle a
| second time."
What. explanation can you give of the
| liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius
occurring, as described above, in pointed an
emphatic acknowledgment of a present at the
hands of Victor-EMMANUEL, whom I think
you say the Pope has excommunicated
Possibly you will deem it necessary to as-
certain the fact before trying to explain it.
But, as Lord Dundreary would say, º
the fact ascertained, what explanation woul
%. give of it?. Should you say that, the
ING of ITALY has really not brought him-
self within purview of the Holy Father's
fulmination, and that the thunderbolt of the
Vatican, after all, has whizzed over his
head 2
Or do you think the truth to be, that
the blood of St. Januarius always liquefies
under conditions which are indicated by, a
certain figure to which they would raise the
column of mercury in a thermometer?...And
is it your º that a given º of
carbon, in the extremely pure form of a
diamond cross equivalent to a mass of silver
tantamount to 100,000 fr., could be success-
fully employed to produce those conditions?
An answer will edify, 49&Iſ?0ſłł.
FROM THE “WESTMINSTER BELL’S LIFE.”
Interesting Matches to come off.
THE ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY is open to make a match for the
Bench of Bishops, with the President of the Wesleyan Conference, and
an even number of Local Preachers, to hop over the gravestones in St.
Margaret's churchyard, Westminster; the match to come off after any
Wednesday morning service in June; right legs to be tied up : the
bishops to hop in cassocks.
BEN DIzzy is ready to make a match with the DUKE or ARGYLE for
£500 a side to run a mile, walk a mile, and trundle a wheelbarrow a
mile. The articles to be drawn in LoRD REDEsdai E's private room;
and the running, walking, and wheel-barrow-trundling to come off in
the Peers' Court of the New Houses of Parliament.
The SPEAKER of the House of Commons bets the LoRD CHANCELLOR,
even-any sum from £100 to £1000—that he will find ten Members of
the House of Commons, who will talk longer, sit closer, and gram
more facts and figures in a given time than any ten Members of the
House of Lords. The money to be staked, the articles to be drawn,

motto that the present KING OF PRussia, should, adopt, for it is
most decidedly his policy, ought to be “Backwards.” “ºber ſtºnig

BLUchER's motto and

QUACK PILLS AND POETRY.
A PERIODICAL talled the Hygeist, which is the organ of MoRISON's
Pill-grindery, contains the subjoined reference to some remarks that
lately appeared in these columns on a quotation, from a puff relative to
}º's Pills, of the description of poison, given by the Ghost in
a/l/e/ --
rtial persons.
“The animus of Mr. Punch must be apparent to all im
ygeists as follows:-
“The passage from Hamlet will be understood by all
“The Vegetable Universal Medicine, whose effect
So assimulates with the BLOOD of man,
That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body;
And with great vigour purges therefrom
The thick and sour impurities
Which affect the thin and wholesome Blood.
“How does Mr. Punch like this true reading of the passage, so sublime that
it should be written in letters of gold throughout the world? We repeat, that all
persons should take a lesson from our greatest poet."
Mr. Punch has no difficulty in admitting that the effect of the
Vegetable Universal Medicine assimulates with the blood of man. To
assimulate is to feign, to counterfeit. It is not for Punch to deny what
the Hygeist says, that the Vegetable Universal Medicine assimulates
feigns, or counterfeits, something or other in connection with the blood
of man. Mr. Punch has no idea of asserting that the medicine so-called
is not a counterfeit. -
The foregoing paraphrase of SHAKspEARE, as a composition, no doubt
exactly coriesponds to the Wegetable Universal Medicine. The former
is composed with the same regard to the laws of metre as, doubtless,
the latter is to the laws of health. That same SHAKSPEARE
says that “the devil can quote Scripture for his purpose.” To the
same end it appears that the quack can quote SHAkspeaRE, and, like
the devil, he corrupts the text, only with a clumsiness which the devil
would be ashamed of... If SHAkspeaRE were not an immortal bard
Punch might say that the quack murders SHAKspeARE, and Punch will
i. that he would advise him to take care that he murders nobody
else.

“AN ORGANIC CHANGE.”
SoMEBODY has furnished us with the following Shakspearian variº
ation, which, he is surprised to observe, seems to have escaped, the
attention of MR. J. PAYNE Collier's sagacious but impalpable Cor-
rector; it appears to us not only plausible but certain. Jessica never
uttered the sentiment attributed to her in the Merchant of Penice
(Act W. Sc. 1, according to the ordinary Editions), her real words were:
“I am never merry when I hear street music."
It would be strange indeed that she should be, but, this honest
avowal ought to advance her in the estimation of every reader or auditor
who studies “the character.”
INDUSTRIAL HANDBOOK
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.
THE Commissioners are so well satisfied with the reception of the
Handbook to the Fine Art Department of the Exhibition, that they have
determined on issuing a Handbook to the Industrial Department, based
on the same principles which have secured such a general acceptance of
MR. PALGRAVE's spirited and agreeable little brochure. They are quite
agreed on the principles which should govern the composition of the
Handbook, viz., the free use of the sternest severity of criticism, and
an inexorable stigmatising of all contributions which do not come up to
the standard applied by the judges to whom the Commissioners may
delegate the task of passing sentence upon the exhibitors. . But the
Commissioners have hitherto found a difficulty in selecting judges at
once competent and willing to sit in infallible Rhadamanthine judgment
on the vast and various display at South Kensington. That difficulty has
now been surmounted, thanks mainly to the light thrown upon the dis.
charge of a similar critical duty by the author of the Fine-Art Handbook.
An ex-analyst of the Lancet has agreed to do the Substances used
for Food. *. Wines will be taken in hand by the sleeping partner
in one of the firms contributing most largely to this department.
The Railway-plant will be reviewed by a distinguished but disap-
pointed engineer, the proprietor of a patent for superseding steam
power altogether. M.R. WHITwoRTH has kindly consented to report
on SIR. W. ARMSTRONG's inventions in gunnery; SIR WILLIAM on
those of MR. WHITwo RTH ; and CAPTAIN BLAIKLEY on those of both
these distinguished inventors. The department of Projectiles and For-
tifications generally will be entrusted to a gentleman who has for years
past been memorialising the Ordnance department in favour of an
invention of his own, which subverts the whole of our received system
of attack and defence.
A Committee of English Upholsterers has kindly undertaken to find
a thoroughly qualified person to pass in review the Foreign Upholstery
department, while the English porcelain will be reported on by the
managers of the royal works at s'. and Dresden, and the designer
of one of the most eminent Nottingham firms will judge the French
and Belgian lace manufactures. CAPTAIN ACKERLEY has agreed to
report on the philosophical and surgical instruments, and the chief
agent for the sale of MoRISON's medicines on the Pharmaceutical
Substances and processes.
The Commissioners, in selecting these and their other Industrial
judges, have made it their object to obtain the most unbiassed and
st-informed opinion on the various classes of the Exhibition, accom-
panied by that healthy and high-minded criticism, which will at once
serve as a lesson to exhibitors, and a guide to visitors. It is needless
to say that the very secondary object of information has been postponed
to the higher functions of inflicting withering censure or crowning with
enthusiastic approbation.
We are permitted, by favour of the Commissioners, to subjoin a few
specimens, selected at-random from their as yet unpublished--

Contributed by LoRDs of THE ADMIRALTY, Whitehall.
Progress || Yes—Progress—if, as Hamlet says, “like crabs we could
go backwards.” This series admirably illustrates the crass stupidity
and brutal indifference to the suggestions of inventors which has always
marked the English Admiralty, from the days of the Tudors to the
present time. Aſlihatſcan be said of the naval architecture of 1488, is that
it is abominable; but such as it is, it is immeasurably superior to that
of 1862, which is the very last expression of human baseness, showing
an ignorance of the principles of floatation, equilibrium, and hydrostatic
force generally, which would disgrace the lowest boy in the worst
of our National Schools. “Sickening” is indeed the only epithet to
be applied to this series.

PELLETS OF PAPER.
THE Japanese are noted for the many
purposes to which they can turn paper. The
Ambassadors, who are at present airing their
seediness amongst us, have, it is said, paper
collars, paper shirts, paper jº:
kerchiefs, and even paper boots. All their
money may be, for what we know, paper.
The Yankees, however, have thrashed them
in their own speciality. They have, since
they have been pummelling one another to
death, invented paper blockades and paper
victories. As the Washington Government
have absolute authority over the telegraphs
and the press, they can slay, burn, destroy,
raise up, knock down, invent, colour, falsify
anything they please. . . Give them a scrap
of paper, and the thing is done with a
stroke of the pen. Can the Japanese point
to a single sheet of paper that ever has
had the effect of killing thousands and
wounding as many more ? . The latter is
indeed a “Happy. Despatch! ” On the
ground of paper-mills º their fights, as
wº reported, are frequently, nothing better)

AN IRISH ORDERLY MEETING.
AccorpLNG to a morning paper, the annual meeting of the London
Irish Rifles took place on Tuesday evening, at the orderly rooms, 5,
Lancaster Place, Strand. The phenomena of this assembly were
peculiar. In the first place:—
“The chair was not taken for nearly an hour after the appointed time, on account
of the small number present. When the proceedings commenced there were not
40 present.”
Not at all like Irish management
Next, after the chair had at length been taken, the MARQUIs or
DoNEGALL, who occupied it, announced that:-
“Out of 509 enrolled members, only 113 had, up to that day, paid their subscrip-
tions for the current year.”
How very un-Irish -
The noble Chairman further stated that:—
“The falling off in the finances was exactly in keeping with the attendances at
parade and §. ".
In accordance with this statement:—
“MAJoR WERNER said it was absurd to march out with the musters they recently
had. He thought it would be only dis ing the corps and his countrymen to
walk through the streets of London with only a few dozen men out of over 500
whose names were enrolled.”
With reference to the pecuniary affairs of the corps:—
“MR. Montgomery agreed with ENsign GoDFREY, that one of the most practical
ways of making the corps popular, and upholding its effective strength, was the
tº: of the subscriptions; and the officers would add to their own popularity
y urging the payment by the men in their different companies. (Hear, hear.)"
This applause, to be sure, was a touch of nationality...,Irish gene-
rosity spake therein. Hear, hear!. The divil fly away with the dhirt
subscriptions! No doubt the officers of the gallant London Iris
would acquire a great addition to their popularity by pressing their
men assiduously on that subject. ---
CAPTAIN M'Sweeney said that the deplorable condition of the corps
“ was owing to the proceedings of two English agitators;” and—
“A scene of the most indescribable confusion followed the delivery of this state-
ment, during which CAPTAIN TULLY, MAJoB VERNER, Mr. LEAch, ENsign GoDFREY,
CAPTAIN M'Sween Ey, and others were speaking. It was at last put an end to by
CAPTAIN M'SweeNEY hastily leaving the room, followed by half-a-dozen friends who
besought his return. He refused to do so, stating that he belonged to the Victoria
Rifles, and he would go to them. CAPTAIN DAUBNEY, the adjutant, who is an English-
lan, was present during the ‘row,' and was labouring under evident feelings of
barrassment.”
What a contrast is all this to the sobriety which usually characterises
Irish deliberations! Finally:-
“The proceedings, which were very stormy throughout, were brought to a close
by the MARquis of DoNEGALL stating with what regret he witnessed what had
taken place that evening, and expressing a hope that if he met them again, it
would be when a more friendly feeling was exhibited. He dismissed the meeting.
There was no balance-sheet submitted.”
No balance-sheet? That is a wonder! If the corps had been a
Scotch one, such an omission would have surprised nobody; but the
idea of an Irish regiment’s accounts wanting a balance-sheet, is strange
indeed. The reader will doubtless already have noted the curious
coincidence by which this meeting of the London Irish Rifles took
place at their orderly rooms.

ELECTIONEERING INTELLIGENCE.

THEoPHILE GAUTIER, who is well-known for his quaint conceits,
says, “The International Exhibition is certainly ugly and queer
enough, but that is the very reason why I like it. ..It is so admirably
adapted for its purpose from its extreme bazaarerie.”

CAB-HUNTING INTELLIGENCE.
It is not everybody who can afford to keep a carriage; and even the
who can are sometimes forced to take a cab. Now, it is all very well
to say, “Oh! take a cab,” but the fact is, cabs are not so easy to be
taken. Of late a blackguard custom has sprung up among the cabmen
to ask, “Were d'yer vaunt to goo to?” before they let you get inside;
and if the distance or direction does not suit their book, they tell you
that their 'oss is tired, or lame, or broken-kneed, and refuse on some
lame pretext to assist your transit.
Now this has recently become so monstrous an annoyance that Mr.
Punch is pleased to see it brought before the public in a public manner.
Thanks to DR. BUCHANEN, of Widbury Hall, Ware, three cabmen have
been fined for refusing to do what they are bound to do: that is, when
not engaged, and when plying for a fare, to take whatever fare they
happen to be offered. The first of the three cases is quite enough to
quote:—
“WESTMINSTER.—CAB-DRrvers AT THE Exhibition.—DR. Buchan EN, of Wid-
bury Hall, Ware, attended to prosecute complaints against three cab-drivers for
refusing to carry him.
“Complainant said that the offences were committed at five o'clock on the after-
noon of the 7th inst. ; he had been with a lady to the Exhibition, and as it rained
heavily was desirous of getting a cab, but the drivers were determined only to take
such fares as they chose.
“John SMITH, the first of the trio, pleaded not guilty.
“DR. BUCHANEN said he hailed defendant in the Brompton Road, when he
stopped and inquired where he wished to go, and then said be would not take him.
Complainant had opened"the cab-door, but, in consequence of defendant's driving
tº:lºsed for his own safety to leave it. Defendant gave no reason for not
g -
“Defendant said his horse was tired, and he wanted to go to Stepney to change
it; the gentleman never spoke to him, and he never pulled up.
“MR, ARNoLD said that by the act of stopping, defendant was holding himself
out for hire. He (MR, ARNoLD) had not the slightest doubt that the gentleman's
account of the transaction was correct, and defendant had ºft'. his offence by
the impudent defence set up. He was, therefore, fined the full penalty of 40s. and
costs, or one month in default.
+ - - + +
“MR. ARNOLD said the public were much indebted to DR. Bucha NEN, who is a
gentleman far advanced in years, for bringing the case forward.
“DR. Bucha NEN said he had felt it to be a public duty, and had travelled thirty
miles to take out these summonses.”
Mr. Punch most willingly endorses MR. ARNOLD’s wise decision;
and will answer for it that º public, when they read the sentence in
his columns, will be very much obliged to DR. BUCHANEN for the
mingled pluck and patience wherewith he prosecuted the three drivers
whom he summoned. Cabmen usually rely upon the fact that, to a
gentleman the taking out a summons, and the attending to give evidence,
are too much of a bore to be encountered lightly; and that there exists
not one man in a hundred but will shirk such “public duty.” ...All
honour then to men like DR. BuchaneN of Ware, who though far
advanced in years,” will put themselves to the annoyance of travelling
thirty miles, in order to protect, the interests of the public; that is,
brother reader, your interests and mine, as well as cousin CharlEs’s.
Disunion is Strength.
THE Yankees are always, fancying that every nation, is filled with
malice, hatred, envy, and all uncharitableness towards them. , We can
assure them, and the saying can be applied with most painful truth, to
the North as well as to the South, that “They have no enemies in this
world but themselves.” . As their best friend, Punch advises them to
separate. . At present, the “Union is Weakness.” Apart, from each
i. probably the result may prove “Disunion is Strength.” There
is an old Latin motto, which they do well to carry into practice:
“ Divide et Impera.”
“WRITE ME Down AN Ass”-OLANT.
A Monsieur Assol.ANT, a would-be-if-he-could-be , witty Corre-
spondent of the Courrier du Dimanche, has been writing abusive articles
against the English. The next article this effervescing gentleman froths
up, we should advise him (it would be a capital nom de plume for one
phis peculiar style) to sign it not Assol ANT, but “INsolENT.”

UNPARDONABLE MISTAKE.
IGNORANT FLUNKEY (to Tomkins, who is about to leave his Carte de Visite). “Re'lly,
we don't want nothink o' the kind in your way, Young Man /"
A CROW FOR OURSELVES.
THE Foreign World has come over and had a look at
us, and has discovered that we can do nothing. France
says we can't paint China. Italy says we can't make music.
me says we can’t cut a statue. Spain says we can’t
ow olives. Portugal, says we can’t mix port wine.
witzerland says we can't carve wood. America says we
can’t talk English. Bohemia says we can't make coloured
glass. Turkey says we can't embroider slippers. And every
other nation says we can't do something or other that it can
do. To all of which Mr. Punch begs to answer, in his own
words, Very Likely, and, in the words of a deceased
Italian:—
“Excudent ALII spIRANTIA MoLLIUs AERA,
TU REGERE IMPERIo Populos, Roman E, MEMENTo,
HAE tibi ERINT ARTEs.”
Which, literally translated, means, that while the rest of
the world cooks, and paints, and fiddles, and carves, and
embroiders, and all the rest of it—
“England, 'tis thine, alone with awful sway,
To RULE MANKIND, AND MAKE the world OBEY,
Disposing Peace and War thine own majestic way.”

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAy 19th, Monday. This is an odd world. The novel and profound
remark is suggested to Mr. Punch by a recollection that a short time
back, SlR ROBERT PEEL stated that the scenes of violence at the last
Longford election (when Colon EL WHITE, who is going in for Kidder-
minster, was beaten by MAJOR O’REILLY) were ºil. and that
Government meant to prosecute the rioters, and by hearing to-night
that the petition against MAJOR O’REILLY's return was withdrawn.
“There's somethin
Shall be .
in this world amiss
by-and-by."
On the last stage of the Budget, MR. DISRAELI fired off a very heavy
gun at LoRD PAM. It was loaded to the muzzle with all kinds of
missiles, and notably with charges of extravagance, jealousy of France,
#º of treaties, and other bon-bons. Also, he was critical on
oRD PALMERSTON's style of speaking, and said that he had no humour
but a good deal of what was ed in the last century, banter, and
was now called by a monosyllabic name, which the elegant DISRAELI
would not utter. Mr. Punch supposes that he meant chaff. But if
PAM does deal in chaft, he falsifies an old proverb by catching a great
many old birds. Needless to say that PAM returned the fire, pointed
out that the last Conservative Government had given the alarm and re-
constructed the fleet, and were right in doing so, and added that the
present Government would continue doing what they thought right, but
would economise when they had an opportunity. After a little more
talking, there came a fresh exposure of the injustice by which the Income-
Tax is extorted by the surveyors, who are monarchs of all they survey
their levy no man can dispute, they don’t care a fig what you say, an
treat you much worse than a brute. Then, the Budget Bill was passed.
MR. WHITE, of London Super-Mare, promised to º MR.
DisRAELI, if he came in, and were economic, so that modern icalism
has no principles, and looks only to questions of money.
Mr. Punch last week warned the Ministers that close shaving might
end in their cutting themselves, and though his advice was not published
until after the division he is going to mention, the moral is the same.
MR. GLADSTONE moved the Second Reading of the British Museum Bill.
He proposed to turn the beasts out, of Great Russell Street, and to
send them to Kensington, where for about £680,000 (much cheaper than
the thing could be done by enlarging the present place) they–that is,
Nature, could be comfortably housed. MR. GREGORY opposed the Bill,
contending that the animalsought not to be sent away, and that sufficient
space could be obtained at the Museum. MR. Monckton MILNES spoke
for the Bill, and begged that we would not so wrap up ourselves in
the Miserable Moment as to lose sight of the future. LoRD HENRY
LENNox had the modesty to say, that he would not, put his Qpinion
against that of PROFEssoft Owen, which preternatural humility did him
honour. DIGBY SEYMoUR of course talked clap-trap, M.R., SCLATER
Booth made the sensible suggestion, that the Bill should be read a
Second Time, and the Government of the Museums should be divided.
MR. PULLER wanted to send away the sculptures, and MR. WALPOLE
said that the Bill was a positive necessity. Our Cox was for—what do
you think—yes, sending away the Books! . It is true, we never, misre-
present anybody, even a Cox. He wanted to send the Books and MSS.
to Kensington. We wonder whether he would like to move the Read-
jº also? Bravo, Cox. The Secretary at War supported the
Bill, and hinted at the Regent's Park as a good site, but said the offer
of the land at Kensington had turned the scale. MR. BERNAL OSBORNE
made fun of PROFEssoR Owen’s demand for space for whales, CoLONEL
Sykes desired that the working classes should be considered, and LORD
PALMERSTON argued that the proposal was an economical one, but he
romised to give up the whales. A final grumble from MR. HENLEY
rought on the division, and the Government were signally defeated,
the numbers being 163 to 71, and the Bill is lost.
This is a Governmental defeat, and in the old days might have
occasioned some little excitement on the º but in these
times we don’t trouble ourselves about Trifles. Ministers went on with
talk about shot-proof ships and Irish crime, as pleasantly as if nothing
had happened. Some Members º that the increase of murder in
Ireland, and the assistance which the peasantry give to the assassins,
demanded more rapid justice than is at present dealt out.

States for conceding mutual right of search, off the African coast, and
the document was received with the acclamation it merited.
MR. LAYARD admits that the French behave harshly to our fisher.
men, and says that he is endeavouring to improve matters. Considering
how bad is the fish one gets in Paris, it would better become ºur friends
to promote piscatorial free trade, whereby the high art of their, cooks
would be enabled to demonstrate itself upon a more decent article.
Sir G. Lewis proposes to try military murders at the Central
Criminal Court, so as to get them speedily sentenced. This course will
shorten matters by one month. - -
| The Lord CHANCELLOR's Lunacy Bill was read a second time, but
the lawyers found many faults in it, and promised that in Committee
those faults should be exposed with the utmost frankness., But we

| Wednesday. The interesting business of the day was an exposure of a
great and prevailing vice among the aristocracy. It seems that the
Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and other constituents of Swelldºm
are in the objectionable habit of ordering in Battles of Gin on credit,
and when asked for the money, of pleading the Tippling Act. We con-
sider that this is by no means elevated or elegant conduct, and, we
quite agree in the propriety of the measure read a Second Time to-day,
for making such a defence impossible. A Duke ought to pay for his
Tuesday. EARL Russell produced the convention with the United

Thursday. The CHANCELLOR spoke very well upon the Second
Reading of the Copyright, in Works of Art Bill, LoRD OVERSTONE
thought that the sitter and not the artist should have the copyright in
a portrait, and if Mr. Punch should write LORD OVERSTONE's biogra-
phy, his lordship would, we suppose, consider that the book should be
the |...}. of his respected executors. LoRD TAUNTON did nºt like
the Bill, and added that he had no sympathy with people who locked
up pictures from the public. Nor has Mr. Punch, whose own noble
and unequalled gallery is always open to the public, at a no
ridiculous fee, charged only in order to preserve his rights. -
| Enterprising people are now anxious to go to British Columbia, and
other enterprising people seek to profit by this wish, and make liberal
promise in advertisements of conveyance. The attention of the Govern-
ment has been called to the circumstance, and they have actually taken
steps to hold the advertisers to their promises to emigrants. We do
not know whether this is in accordance with the ºpe of free
trade or not, but we are very glad to see the course adopted.
Once more appealed to on the Church Rate question, LoBD PAM came
out with such a Pam-like speech, that we really must give it in extenso:
“Lond PALMerstos : whatever may have been the wishes that the House has
expressed upon this point, I think the House must at the same time have seen what
are the difficulties which surround the question with a view to arriving at any satis-
factory arrangement; and all I can say is that her Majesty's Government are not
prepared at present to undertake the task referred to by the right hon, gentleman.
(‘ Hear,' and a laugh.)”
What were they laughing at?...Agentleman sees that there will be a
fº. deal of trouble about a particular piece of business, and therefore
he really must decline having anything to do with it. All matural
enough, anybody else would do the same. Only this particular gentle;
man happens to be paid £5000 a-year on the understanding that Rewill
attend to such matters—however, one would not press a vulgar an
mercenary view of the case. MR. Estcourt, the vanquisher of Little
| Bethel, has given notice that he has a plan for a compromise on the
Rate question, and means to ask for a committee thereon. He would
do away with the present means of enforcing the rate, and give power
to a vestry, in which owners as well as occupiers shall vote to evy a
rate for the purposes of the church. How this º will do away
with agitation MR. Estcourt will be good enough to explain when the
time comes.
MR. FELLOWEs read a letter from, MR. HAwksHAw, the eminent
engineer, who has gallantly thrown himself into the Norfolk breach,
and Rºº. to save England from the sea, if energy and skill can do
it. MR. HAwkshaw states that his difficulties are very great, and
º hints that the people who make all sorts of amateur suggestions
or repulsing the ocean do not know what they are talking about.
Personally, we do not much care about the matter, because, we can
swim, but if MR. HAwksHAw, can save the island, we shall, in the
interest of friends, be rather obliged to him to do so.
Six hours of Irish educational polemics. Six words have described
that waste of time and breath. LoRD PALMERSto.N then rallied for a
fight for the Alderney defences, and carried his vote by 174 to 118, SIR
M.P.E.To however pledging his professional reputation that the harbour,
which is to cost a million and a quarter, will be “perfectly useless.”
|
Friday. The clamour of the Irish peasant under a distress stated
not to be excessive, contrasts with the patience of the English workman
under a distress which is admitted on all sides to be exceptionally
severe. . The Irish cry was again raised to-night, and painful stories
were told, but look at Lancashire, where people do not murder their
landlords for asking for rent, and where sufferings, moral as well as
physical, are borne with true heroism.
SIR ROBERT CLIFToM thought fit to come out with a speech against
extravagance, and was briefly disposed of by Lord PALMERSTON, who
was not aware of any “panic” exºept on the title-page of a pamphlet.
For which speech MR. CoBDEN will “owe him one”—not that Lord
PALMERSTON or Mr. Punch cares much for the enmity of anybody,
“or any other man,” as the stupid slang of the hour goeth.
SIR MoRTON, PETo alluded to the ridiculously light punishments
which some of the Magistrates inflict in cases of brutal assaults. As a
rule, it is unjust to impugn a Magistrate's decision, upon the brief and
imperfect police reports, but it certainly would seem that very great
ruffians do get off with very small sentences. The more recently
appointed Magistrates, however, do not commit this error, and some
very proper punishments have lately been awarded. SIR GEORGE GREY
had no satisfactory answer to make.
The Longford business came up again, and a good deal of abuse was
freely lavished, and the evening was thus helped on. Then a Com-
mittee of Supply ve the inexhaustible PALMERstoN the opportunity
of talking on education, explaining mechanics, telling anecdotes of
: º and generally making himself (and a vote of £300,000)
pleasant. -

the Handbook of Etiquette. When a gentleman asks you for your
ticket, produce it without making any remark, unless you choose to say,
“Here it is, Sir,” which is preferable to “Here you are, Sir.” If you
are sincerely anxious that he should have a spare ticket to use for the
purpose of summoning you in case he should lose the other, you may
safely, invite him to take two, for you will do so. in language whi
he will not mistake for that of insolence. Your friend did not know
what insolent language was. He perhaps supposed that, insolent
language was confined to oaths and foul words. The thought, never
occurred to him that there was any insolence in a jeer. If it had, it
might have saved him 10s, or seven days' imprisonment, which, if the
Magistrate had awarded him that instead of a fine, would have served
him right. Take warning by his example lest, you should incur the
penalty which he paid, if not the punishment which he merited.

“A CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED.”
(From a Sufferer ander Organic attacks.)
. HELPs has published an Essay ‘On Organisation in
Daily Life. If he lived where I do, he would be exposed to so many
Essays at Organisation in his Daily Life, that he would certainly have
paused before adding another to the number. Unluckily these Essays,
which used to be periodical, have now become daily and all day. From
six in the morning till twelve at night I am liable to the invasion of
these awful grinders. I have tried the police on the pavement, frenzied
esticulation from the windows, terrific demonstrations with the, wash-
† and malignant exhibition of a garden-engine, but all with.
out effect.
“My daily life is in fact becoming one long and most painful organ-
isation, and I do wish, under these circumstances that MR; HeLPs—a
well-meaning and kindly man I am sure—would suppress his present
Essay, and in lieu of it write one to teach me how to free my daily life

A CAPITAL TRANSFORMATION SCENE.
UR, bon confrère, Le Charivari, says
the English are flocking to Paris in
such numbers that Paris is now quite
an English, town. In the cafés you
can get nothing but beer to drink-
in the restaurants you can have only
rosbif and plum-pudding for dinner-
on the #. you hear nothing
but English spoken—and the ma-
nagers of the various theatres, to suit
the tastes of the new inhabitants of
the capital, intend going through an
entire course of the British Drama.
The Porte St. Martin inaugurates the
series with Jonathan Bradford.
However, London, it goes on say-
ing, has gained in a similar way. It
has become completely a French town.
Frenchmen swarm in the public-
houses, the theatres, the clubs, the
tableaua rivants, the police-courts
everywhere. Even the T amesTunnel
is blocked up with them. . The
omnibus conductor, instead of flog-
ging the back of his vehicle with a
- fi leather-strap, and shrieking out
...All right!” now exclaims “Complet!” in the softest Parisian tones.
The theatres are playing their pieces in the beautiful language from
which they were burglariously borrowed. M. FECHTER has been
delighting us with Ruy Blas in the original version by Victor Hugo.
The above is not only amusing, but is also another proof that one
must go abroad to learn the news. For ourselves, we would not mind
the exchange, so funnily depicted by our continental Parrain. Paris is
a much handsomer and gayer capital than London. There is only one
little drawback—there is no liberty. Besides, we are not particularly
fond of coups d'état.
Carrying, out the fancy of this double “transformation scene,” our
Parisian relation winds up by observing:—
“It is said that, during the Exhibition, the office of the Times will be transferred
to Paris, and the Moniteur will be brought out in London; and that Punch and Le
º: are in treaty with one another for an exchange of offices, artists, and
rs.”
* We feel highly flattered by the compliment, but must respectfully
decline the offer that is wrapt up in it. The benefits are not exactly
equal. There is a decided disadvantage in the relative positions. The
ricari of Paris has been lately warned. The Charitari of the French
capital is liable to be suppressed at a moment's notice. There are cer:
tain subjects which it can only touch upon with the utmost reserve, and
there are certain gentlemen of whom it can only speak in the most
guarded terms... The Charitari of London runs no such risk. The Chari.
part of the English capital enjoys the greatest freedom to say and do what
it pleases, and stands in fear of no man. We should like to see SIR
GEORGE GREY daring to preach to us, or LoRD PALMERston sending one
of his satraps to tie a piece of red tape round the jugular vein, of our
jolly periodical existence. We confess the good dinners of Paris do
tº a wee tit-bit, but where is the enjoyment of eating them with a
adlock on your lips, or with the nervous dread of a big gendarme
ursting in every minute and snatching the savoury plate right from
under your nose?
No; bien obliges, but we will stop where we are:
Punch would sooner sell his beloved Judy (the best of wives) in
field-market than leave thee!

“SENSATION” SCRIBBLING.
CALL a spade a spade, is a good old English proverb... Call a spade
an implement of husbandry, an instrument employed for turning up
the soil, this is what one learns from the slang of penny-a-liners. For
instance, see how finely they have written of the “late tragedy at Man-
chester.” Why could they not speak plainly, and without disguise, say
Murder? Tragedy, indeed! . One would t from such a .#
it was some dramatic news which they had to relate, and one naturally
looked for some account of Monsieur FECHTER, or perhaps a high.
flown criticism, setting forth the wondrous merits of such, eminent
tragedians as MR. BRooke or MR. KEAN. “Oh, yes, dear, I’m much
better: I enjoys my murders,” was the º of an old lady who loved
reading in the papers all, the details which were furnished of all inter-
esting crimes. And surely it must be for such old ladies only that we
see recorded such particulars as these:-
“The prisoners were called to the dock at half-past ten. The male prisoner stood
on the left facing the bench; his wife on the right side. They both ap d cool
and collected. The male prisoner is of a brownish complexion, and a close exami-
nation of his face, his restless eye and compressed lips, gave indications of con-
siderable emotion, which he appeared to be struggling to repress. The female
prisoner was pale, but the study of her face gave less indication of feeling than was
traceable in her husband's. Her heart seemed to beat violently for a moment. The
female prisoner wore a black velvet hat with feather, and a lace fall, a bead collar,
brown mantle, and black kid gloves. After standing for a moment or two side by
side, the male Priº spoke to his wife in a wh , and she then sat down on a
seat in the dock. Once or twice in the course of the examination he spoke to her,
holding at the time a paper in his hand, and he appeared as though he was con-
sulting her upon its contents.”
To details such as these we think there should be added a strictly
accurate account of how often in the day the prisoners blew their noses,
and whether when they did so they used white cambric handkerchiefs,
or whether they used silk. The only phrase with which we feel no wish
to quarrel is the term “male prisoner,” and that of “female prisoner.”
These words seem to indicate that creatures who do murder cease
thereby to be human, and are no longer worthy to be viewed as men
and women. This perhaps may act as a deterrent from the crime, an
therefore we commend such penny-a-liner phraseology; but the des:
cription of the dress and the demeanour of the prisoner is worthy of
the Newgate Calendar rather than the Times.
Again, we read in this to us disgusting, but to some no doubt in-
tensely interesting case-
“While giving his evidence the witness was at times affected to tears.”
If the writer had said “cried,” he would quite as truthfully have
described the fact. But, “affected to tears”, is a nicely touching
phrase, and one that ladies who delight to read of murders must take
leasure in, Well, tastes differ, that we know; but for our part, if we
ad to write about a murderer we should try to use the plainest,
coarsest English we could, think of, and not weaken the effect of an
appalling crime by speaking of it in the language of a three volume
romance.

description of that. Everyone knows it by heart, and has wandered, in imagina:
tion at least, over those ferro-vitreous covered acres. We are certainly a wonderful
people, and work, as perhaps our foreign friends will think, in a paradoxical sort of
way. It was a gardener who planned our Crystal Palace for ’51, and eleven years
later we are j for the design of another Exhibition to a soldier. A barrister
superintends the casting of our great bells, and we have an architect who is an
authority on fortification. Well, perhaps when our coasts are invaded, a bishop
may be Secretary at War, and a physician presiding at the Admiralty. . . -
I was surprised on the first “five shilling-day” to find so few visitors in the
place. Whether...our country cousins have not all come up to Town–(I beg to
inform my bucolic and bachelor acquaintance that, I have, no more room in my
chambers)—or whether they prefer waiting until the Exhibition is completed, the
hammering over, and the packing cases cleared out, I cannot say, but certain it is
that for the first few hours on Monday the 5th instant, the congregation in the
“Fowkes-pallis” was a thin one. The first “distinguished strangers” whom I
noticed were some dusky gentlemen in great coats, tight groom-like trousers, yellow
turbans, red waistcoats, gold collars, ditto earrings—say eighteen inches in circum-
ference—and no stockings. Who they were, I cannot say for certain. Policeman
double X to whom I referred on this matter, pointing to one of the party in a bro-
caded satin petticoat, remarked confidentially to me that he had heard, as how, he
was the Grand Dook of Indy. I wander down the Great Nave, which, looked
like a Brobdingmag kaleidoscope out of order, and arriving at the west end, find a
number of people lounging about on the canopied dais under the dome. . There is a
stout British ‘female’, who has already assumed the post of honour, and is perhaps
speculating as she looks about her, very hot and tired, how she, if Fate had willed
could play at Royalty. There are hundreds of her sex crowding round the stalls of
MEssrs. £º. of HUNT AND RoskELL, &c., &c. Next to wearing jewellery I
think women enjo looking at it best. What loves of rubies, what darling emeralds
rings, bracelets }. are here displayed". Ah, be thankful, husbands all, Í
ht, that sales are prohibited in the bition. ... -
...Of “trophies” there is no end. There is the military trophy bristling with
rifles, bayonets, and side-arms; the grocers' trophy piled up with cans of biscuits,
jars of pickles, sauces, potted beef and fresh ditto, preserved in a most miraculous
way under a glass case, chocolate powder, patent corn flower, wax fruit, dried
flowers, º salmon, what not-looking like the contents of ForTNUMAND
MASON's shop arranged in the form of a pyramid. As for the Toy Trophy, if I am
to be victimised as a cicerone to my young relatives, I shall take very good care
to reserve this spectacle for the close of the day, or who knows how long I may be
detained to inspect and pass judgment on rocking-horses, model farms, penny
theatres, Noah's arks, bats, il. and battledores, dolls that wink or squeak under
certain mechanical, influence, known only to the proprietors, but supposed to
assimilate wonderfully to nature for four-and-six. This collection of Young Eng-
land's resources is dedicated to “the Youth of all Nations,” who will doubtless
appreciate the compliment.—“Wive la Jeunesse /* I say, and wish my pop-gun days
were coming over again. .
In the military engineering department, there are some pop-guns of a larger
#. called Armstrong, a name which you may have heard before, and which I
are say our friends across the water have learned to respect. Here we learn the
difference, between rifled, and smooth “bores,” and see samples of gun-metal,
mortars, field-pieces, garrison-carriages, ammunition carts, and all the paraphernalia
of war. Grimly presiding over this section stands night and day bestrapped and
knap-sacked, Private Dummy of the British Grenadiers, native of cork, whom I saw
before the Exhibition opened lying enveloped in a canvass bag (he had probably

as Šmart a representative of her Majesty’s army as vermilion
and hºrse-hair can make him, and I dare say does his duty
as well as some, apparently, more efficient soldiers.

be able to offer her visitors a bed also (of an aqueous descrip-
tion), being fitted with a machine which sweeps her enemies
into the water without even asking them their business.
I don't know how long I might have stayed inspecting
Class 12, but chancing to peep down a pretty little piece of
artillery and hearing Widjº who h just come in say
sºmething about the “bubble reputation,” which is a joke
already well stricken in years, I, fled from the spot in dis-
may, and !". found myself in a wilderness of shavings
straw, and packing cases, where I was not a little amuse
by reading some of the addresses on the foreign goods.
Fancy a British porter having to decipher the following
inscription, for instance:—

W. WARSZAWIE
Na wys "awe powsze chna Londymie
Of course “glass with care,” and “this side upwards,”
were common directions, but I think the gentleman who
requested. “this side not to be kept downwards” deserves
some credit for the º of his paraphrase.
All this time I had been madly turning over the leaves
of the catalogue in hopes of finding what I wanted to look
at. This experiment proving fruitless, I made up my mind
to wander about and see everything in turn as best I could.
What did I see? What didn't I see in the course of my
peregrinations?. Revolving lanterns, naval beacons, huge
telescopes pointing right up to the roof, and half finished
fountains, which by-and-by are to throw their waters high
above an admiring crowd. Spanish saddles from Valencia,
stamped and stiched to that extent, that it would seem a
sin to sit on them. Gorgeous furniture from Turin and
wood-carving from º MINTON's Majolica, French
bronzes, Roman mosaics, Indian shawls, native dresses
from New Brunswick, and native herrings from Nova Scotia
—how can I attempt to describe them now? To say the
truth, at my first visit I could but take a general survey

PROCEEDINGS AGAINST LORD ELCHO.
WE understand that in consequence of what passed in
the Houses of Lords and Commons, in reference to the
challenge conveyed to the LoRD CHANCELLOR by LoRD
ELcho, the following Case has been submitted to the Law
Officers of the Crown by MR. DENIsoN, the Speaker.

“Your opinion is therefore requested,
“Whether I cannot go at Elcho in some way.”
ANSWER.
“We think you can. By 2 Rich, II,1378, provision is
made for punishing those who shall ‘do wrong to high
personages of the land, such as judges, peers, ministers of
the Crown, and other functionaries, by the circulation of
scandalous statements, false news, or Horrible Messages, by
which any debate or discord between them and the Com.
mons might arise.' ... It is ScANDALUM MAGNATUM. Now
if LoRD ELCHo walked straight to the CHANCELLOR, he did
not circulate his horrible º but if it can be shown
that he went round with it, we think the above words of the
statute will enable you to serve him out. And we would if
we were you.

(A Song of the Season.)
THE Cousins are coming, I fear, I fear,
For Cousins twill be a most terrible year!

They’ve so many inducements—those dear country cousins!
Are so anxious to see one—been planning so long,
To º In On one |. what they call “sans fassong **
“Then the Great International, of course, we must visit,
And it’s hardly worth coming for that only, is it?
But then, you're aware, there's the Royal Academy,
And not to see that would be really too bad of me;
And then the two Operas, both going together;
And the Crystal Palace—the place in fine weather—
With the Flower-shows and Saturday Concerts, and all,
Winding up with the Great HANDEL Festival!
And then there’s the week's Rifle-shooting at Wimbledon,
But that, in a day, one can get (if one's nimble) done,
Wound up with the Grand Volunteer Review:
For which your open carriage and pair will just do.

That we hope to be with you, next Wednesday D.V.,
To spend a week with you, or, p'raps, two or three—"
Oh, the Cousins are coming, in files and in sections !
For folks with town-houses and country connections,
The look-out for the year wakens serious reflections!
TELEGRAMMATIC TWADDLE.
The France Centrale announces that the CARDINAL
ARCHBishop of PARIs, who is about to leave that city for
Rome, has declared that if the Holy Father should leave
his capital, he would follow him wherever he went. This
announcement, if authentic, may create a crisis, and precipi-
tate the solution of the Roman question. In case the
EMPERQR, NAPOLEON believes, that the ARCHBISHOP of
PARIs is likely, in the supposed eventuality, to be as good
as his word, it is highly probable that the evacuation of
Rome by the French troops will speedily become an accom-
plished fact. As yet, however, confirmation is needed for
the rumour that, accommodation for two distinguished
foreign ecclesiastics has been bespoken in Leicester
The tall
Square.
REFORM AND THE READERS.
WE must, in this Whale and transitory Spear, take what we can get,
and get rid of what we can get to go. For the moment, MR. PANIZZI
has been unable to get rid of the Beasts, but he gives notice to eject
the Boys from the British Museum. A proclamation has gone forth,
announcing to the juveniles that as soon as their tickets are out, they
must ask their parents to purchase for them the grammars and dic-
tionaries which are at present provided at the expense of the public–
and of students—and that they must go up-stairs into their bed-rooms
to learn their lessons for the morning, instead of lounging on the
Museum chairs for which a DARwin, a BUCKLE, a FARADAY, a
MAURICE, or a PUNCH may be waiting.
All very well, and the sending the young folks away will no doubt be
found conducive to the quietness of the “balance” of readers, as the
Americans say. But MR. PANIzzI should carry his reform much
further, and clear away a whole heap of people who come choking, up
the room, and who have no more business in a Library like that than
they have in the ball of St. Paul's, nor so much indeed, as they might
have in that airy place of recreation for idle folks. By way of supplying
MR. PANIZZI with some statistics that will justify his adopting ulterior
measures, Mr. Punch took the trouble a few days ago, to walk round the
Room, and behind all the readers, and with the most perfect nonchalance
and entire indifference to their astonishment and indignation, to take up
a good many of the books, and see what was being read. He made some
notes, and here they are. Omitting Fractions, that is the Boys, this was
the account he made out, and all the readers were grown up, well-to-do

POETRY BY A MUSICIAN.
OME musicians are sup-
posed to hold Poetry in
considerable contempt,
and when they want
“words” to set, they
are thought to desire
that such words should
be of the kind least cal-
culated to distract the
attention of the hearer
from the music. Great
compassion has been ex-
pressed, in musical cir-
cles, for DR. STERNDALE
BENNETT, on account of
his having been obliged
to compose music to suit
the “far-fetched” ideas
of the Poet Laureate,
and though DR. BEN.
NETT repudiates such
compassion, and con:
siders that music and
poetry may give and
receive honour by alli-
ance, he is regarded as
an exceptional composer,
and is one. Most music-
makers like the sort of
words which they would
themselves write. And
it is unjust to say that
they would always write
rubbish. Mr. Punch has
received a poem, in
which a gentleman who
plays on an organ in the
country, and advertises
that he shall be happy
And as this gentleman comes out in a
way worthy of his vocation, Mr. Punch is tempted to reproduce the lines, only
suppressing the writer's name for fear of exciting the jealousy of his brother profes.
sionals.
“Music is both a science and an art
That refines the mind and that cheers the heart,
And keeps fearless youth from many a snare,
And relieves old age of many a care.
“How wonderful how potent 1 0, how rare
An art to diminish old age of care,
And a science, to guard the young so fairl
Then nor wealth nor honour with it compare.
“Earth's Goddess, thou dost with thy charming dart
Tempt me, for (Q, thou most delightful art)
Mine ear is pleas'd, my soul rais'd, and my heart
Is moved by thee, O, thou divinest art.”
Now, this subtle employment of poesy in honour of music is so artistic that
henceforth, we hope there will be less readiness to believe that the musician does
not appreciate the poet, and Mr. Punch is much obliged to the correspondent who
has supplied him with the newspaper whence is extracted this refutation of a
vulgar belief.
The Titan of Westminster Improvement.
It is said that MR. TITE “already fills sixteen appointments.” He must indeed
be a great man if he really does fill all the places he holds, so as, in each of them,
to constitute a TITE fit.
A FRENCH CRITIC UPON CRICKET.
EveRY reader of our newspapers, our pamphlets and our
magazines, of course is well acquainted with “the intelli-
gent foreigner.” This exemplary person is introduced to
public notice on all possible occasions, and is spoken of as
one who knows our insular peculiarities, and has a thorough
insight into all our ways. According to what we hear of
him, the “intelligent foreigner” knows a good deal more
about us than we do ourselves, and is far more fit to venture
an opinion on any point connected with our government or
habits than anyone who chances to be British bred and born.
It is however a sad fact that the “intelligent foreigner”
very rarely condescends to put his º
and that the foreigners who publish their opinions about
England are the last gº in the world to whom the
epithet “intelligent” could be with truth applied. That
we English keep fierce bull-dogs, live on raw rump-steaks,
and sell our wives in Smithfield; world known facts like
these our foreign friends are never tired of recording.
But it is seldom they report some other of our customs,
which are not less to our credit or less worthy to be known.
An exception to the rule we have however noticed in a
writer for the Temps—(M. ScHERER by name)—who, after
dilating on the magnitude of London and the valour of our
volunteers, admiringly reports that:-
TEvery Englishman who respects himself begins his day by plung-
ing into the Eurotas, we mean the cold bath, which fortifies the soul
as well as the constitution.”
It is not surprising that a Frenchman should be struck
by our habits of lavation, which to the foreign mind must
surely seem a proof of no ordinary fortitude. But hear
what M. Scheher says of hunting, cricket, and other
English field sports:—
“An Englishman would feel that he was wanting to himself if he
did not give two or three hours to a walk, or a ride across country.
If his means and his occupation permit him ever so little, he will
mount on horseback, hunt, or handle the oar. He has learnt from
an early age how to fight; not as we do, with shut eyes, and flinging
by chance his arms round his body, but in a rational manner, using
his fists at once to parry and to attack. He knows that science and
-
to teach other persons to play on an organ, (the locality is not Hogsnorton) knowledge make up for inequality in bodily strength. He is aware
in poetry, his views of music.
that in a contest with a cabman or a shoeblack he will have the upper
hand, because he has more skill; and he thus exhibits the pacific
assurance of a man who trusts only to himself. We have often thought
that the noblest present our own France could receive, the most effi-
cacious means to regenerate and strengthen our youth, would be the
introduction among us of some national sports like that of the English
cricket. It is an exercise that excites emulation, requires force and
address, calls into play every physical aptitude, invites to wholesome
fatigue and to the open air, and prepares vigorous bodies for vigorous
souls. “Without frankness," said WALTER Scott, “there is no virtue;
and without courage there is no frankness.’ He might have added,
‘and without force there is no courage.” We affirm it in the most
sitive manner, the Englishman is a magnificent specimen of human
ind, and it is cricket which has made the Englishman what he is.”
Bravo, M. SchERER! Well said, good Monsieur! That
we Englishmen are magnificent |. of humanity our
modesty of course will scarce allow us to agree; but that
it is cricket and similar field exercises which have made us
what we are, we know no reason to dispute. Strong and
healthy minds in strong and healthy bodies, such it is the
aim of wholesome field sports to ensure, and Englishmen of
course must feel great reverence for cricket. We suppose
the French will take to playing cricket, and that inter-
national matches will ºil; come off, wherein for the
first year or two eleven Englishmen will play some half a
hundred foreigners. We shall be curious to see how our
slang words are translated, and what the French equiva-
lent will be for a “wide ball,” or “Now then, butter-
fingers!”

BoFE.—In ºf that a tiresome speaker
is voted a bore, allusion is apparently made
to parliamentary practice. Yet neither the
House of Lords nor even the House of
Commons ever votes any one, albeit the
dullest and most prolix, of its orators a bore.
LoRD CHELMSFORD and LORD CRAN worth
have never yet been voted bores in the
Upper House, and the Lower House has
hitherto forborne from voting, MR. Scully
or any of the Irish Members bores; indeed
some of them are not exactly bores, because
their extravagance is rather amusing. The
gift of eloquence redeems the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequER from being the .#
bore in the House. The Budget is essentially
a bore; the longer the speech that is made
about it the greater the bore, and nearly the
greatest bore on earth is the Income:Tax.
Any sort of lecture is a bore that tells
you nothing but what you knew already, and
if every preacher bore this in mind, no con-
g. would ever be bored with a sermon.
ome gentlemen denounce as a bore any
speech or writing which informs them, of
what they don’t want to know, and which,
making them no wiser than they were, they
ironically call didactic. What is one man's
bore is another man's hobby. What a bore is

By the excellent Beak who is called Mr. Knox.
GOVERNMENT IN LODGINGS,
WHAT blunderers we English are about our public buildings! We
carry comfort to perfection in our private houses, but in all our public
edifices this is disregarded, and their costliness is hardly greater than
their inconvenience. After voting away millions to build themselves a
house, our Commons are provided with one too small to hold them, and
even this, although bran new, is showing symptoms of decay, and in a
year or two .# probably be falling about their ears. Then, not to
speak about that pepper-box affair which we degrade ourselves by
calling our “ ºt; Gallery, and not to say a word about our
Brompton Boilers, or their elegant twin-brother, the new structure at
South Kensington, just look at the miserable makeshifts we make use
of, and the sums we yearly waste in renting wretched holes, which we
dignify by grandly calling Public Offices, and wherein we transact the
business of the nation. *W. it came out the other evening in com-
mittee of supply that we are annually paying £27,000 for the lodgings
which we hire for Government to work in; and as these lie scattered
all about the town, it may be fancied what a waste of labour they occa-
sion. In the debate that we refer to—
“SIR. S. M. PETo called attention to the large amount which the Government
were continuing to pay for rent of offices in various parts of the town. . He thought
a considerable saving might be effected by concentrating the establishments, and
he would ask whether the Chief Commissioner, for Works considered he was acting [.
wisely in continuing a rental of £27,000, instead of having a building in which those :
offices could be concentrated?”
Having put this sensible question no fewer than three times, SIR
SAMUEL was favoured with half-a-dozen highly, gracious words from
MR. CowPER, admitting that the subject was “one worthy of consi.
deration,” and that, if by happy accident a site could be obtained, it
might possibly be proper for—aw—Government to—aw—think a little
more about the matter, and—aw—hear what honourable Members
might--aw—have to say about it. In other words, the question is
shelved until next year, when the Government again will have to ask
the country for the money for their rent. The Government, it is clear,
are like those lazy sluggish fellows who continue to put up with lodgings
that don't suit them, rather than bear the trouble of having to turn
out. It is, however, to be hoped that for the credit of the country,
Government ere long will be obliged to build themselves a decent block
of offices, and to move their clerks out of the cellars and back attics in
which they are at present condemned to do their work. lf it were
known what º are suffered by the elegant young swells who con-
descend to read the newspaper at the national expense, if it were known
what tortuous stairs now torture their slim legs, and through what
dark and dingy labyrinths they have to pick their daily way, ere they
can reach the dismal chamber where they pare their filbert nails and
nurture their moustache: if these sufferings were known, the just
wrath of the nation would surely be aroused, and its clerks would be

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MAY 26, Monday. The Lords read the Budget Bill a Second time.
But this was only the torrent's smoothness ere it dash below, LoRD
DERBY, having, in some extraordinary way, become so horriſſed and
astonished at the condition of our Finances, that he felt it a duty to
MR. DISRAELI and others to expound his Lordship's views and terrors.
That exposition was fixed for the following Friday. It is, extremely
gratifying that a British nobleman should display so much conscien-
tiousness, and it speaks well for his single-minded nature that he would
not be deterred rom doing his duty, by the consideration that the
Ministry is thought to be just now assailable elsewhere. He is quite
right, not to let chivalry over-ride conscience. We are sure that -
DisrAELI and others will agree with us.
Great numbers of petitions are presented to both Houses in favour of
a law which shall enable the º in a parish to decide whether and
what the minority shall Drink, That is to say, such part of the
minority as do not keep well-stocked cellars. The sale of intoxicating
drinks, at public houses, is what the virtuous petitioners desire to pre:

that a quarter of a century, back, MR, SLANEY condemned such bar-
barous folly. e new writ was moved to-night.
The LORD Advocate withdrew the Scottish Education Bill. Some-
body once asked an old woman, who had been expressing fervent admi-
ration of a sermon, by DR. CHALMERs, whether she understood him.
“Wad I hae had the presumption?” was the humble-minded old per-
son's remonstrant reply. All Mr. Punch's virtues are resplendent, but
if one is more blazing than another it is his humility, and he is inclined
to put himself in the place of the old Scottish lady in reference to the
LORD Advocate's conduct. The only light he has been able to obtain
is from a clever article in the North British Daily Mail, which saith:—
“The Lord Advocate must doubtless have sounded the depths. It may have
been that he had a dread of the Upper House. The aristocratic tendencies of that
punctilious body might have led them to view with distrust a measure interfering,
to any extent, with the influence of the landocracy of Scotland, while their latent
feeling for the Kirk might have been fanned into a flame by the apparent endea-
vour #, sap the foundations of the present Presbyterial supervision."
You may make what you like out of that, but it leaves with Mr.
Punch the idea (he having given and intending to give not the slightest
attention to the subject) that the Bill must have had some good in it.

away with that provision in the Act of Uniformity,(we do not mean that
one which Little Bethel is trying to ſº but that by which CHARLEs
THE SEcond thinned the Church), which requires that a clergyman, on
being put into a benefice, shall signify that he approves of the contents
of the Prayer Book. As usual with weak men, he exaggerated his case
largely, and laid himself open to the remonstrance of the Bishop 9F
London, and to the fiery castigation of the Bishop of OxfoºD, who
really went at him like a good one... If anybody is scandalised at this

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
around you, and how can you be under them?), let those persons know
that the Bishop himself selected curious illustrations, said that he did
not find university men “tail off,” on account of the Act of Uniformity,
and likened LoRD EBURY's imaginary array of excluded clergy to the
supernumeraries who represent an army on the stage of a country
theatre. LoRD RUSSELL came to LoRD, EBURY's help against the
hierarchs, and so did LoRD SHAFTESBURY, who, as Bishop-maker, seemed
to think that his Bishops had no right to show fight without his leave.
But the Bill was got rid of, and it appears to be the understanding
amongst the heads of the Church that you are to give your assent to the
Prayer Book not as you would sign an affidavit you are going to swear
to, but in a general way, and like a man of the world. Bishop PUNCH
§ have his own ideas on that subject, but he reserves them for his next
large.
SIR. Hugh . CAIRNs, who was LoRD DERBY’s eloquent Solicitor,
moved an ad for a Commission to inquire into the working of
the Patent Laws. There are about 14,000 patents, and great numbers
of them are said to have been obtained by way of traps to catch the
unwary, or extinguish rivals, and great numbers more are said to be
worthless, trivial, and in the way. LoRD STANLEY seconded the
motion, and SIR William Armenrös thought a case had been made
out for inquiry. Mr. Punch, will be happy to attend before the Com-
missioners and explain his Patent for delighting and instructing the
world, a patent which no pirate has ever been able to violate successfully,
though the attempt has been made a good º times.
Then MR. BERKELEY played a trick with his celebrated conjuring
box, and cleverly sold the House. He was going to make one of his
usual speeches upon the Ballot, when he happened to look at his
audience. The mass of the Members had gone away, and he was
clearly in a majority. He shut his mouth, snatched a division, and
actually §: leave, by 83 to 50 to bring in his Bill, another Bill for taking
votes by Ballot at municipal elections also being carried. The trick
was very neatly performed, and drew good-humoured applause from
LoRD PALMERSTON, BERKELEY's wisest course would now be not to
gºl with the Bill, but to trumpet his victory until next session.
Smart, and American, but in keeping.
MR. WHALLEY is growing a nuisance with his Anti-Catholic
speeches. Dear old MR. Spoon ER was all very well—he gave us one
ood Maynooth day, and there was an end till next year. But
W HALLEY buzzes about Maynooth like an enraged blue-fly, and is
always bobbing in the faces of the Catholics. This is wrong, and more-
over it is bad taste. MR. BRIGHT gave him a good flip to-night, but if
he does not stop, we shall have to spin him, and if that won't do, to
scrunch him. We have a good many objections to a good manythings
which the Catholics say and dº, but we don't nag like an ill-conditioned
. Mr. WiiALiey will be good enough to accept this inti-
Imall Oil.
The House sat a short time on the Bill about Educating Pauper
Children, and then addressed itself to Scotch Salmon. O my i.
what a good thing is a Scotch salmon! O the firmness, and O my
beloved brethren, that curdiness!, Bless the House of Commons if,
§§ to human expectation, it is doing any good in the matter of
al, Ilsll.
Iſedºesday. Fish again, but this time it was Irish fish. LoRD FERMoy
emitted the excellent dictum, that the best thing you can teach an
Irishman is that Heaven helps those who help themselves. We always
help ourselves to fish when we can. Bill intended to improve the
Irish piscatory interest was read a Second Time.
CoLONEL WHITE won at Kidderminster. MR. HuDDLEston with-
drew, having discovered that the Government candidate was to win;
but, another Conservative gentleman, MR, TALBoT, thought that the
trade of Kidderminster—not the carpet trade—ought to be encouraged,
so he good-naturedly fought the battle, and was defeated, of course, but
by a very small majority, for the electors like in their turn to encourage
candidates with money. One of these days Kidderminster will be hung
up in terrorem, as Gloucester was, and indeed so M.R. TALBOT must
have thought, if he dropped the following exquisite epigram on the
hustings:–
“THE KIDDERMINSTER KITE.
“Destined are Kidderminster's carpets
To be nailed down upon the floor;
Destined is Kidderminster's borough
To be mailed up against the door.”
Thursday, “O most accomplished CHRISTOPHER,” what is Herat to
you?, Are you satisfied now? LoRD PALMERSTON tells you that there
is nothing the matter out there, though certainly the ruler of Herat
had been, to, Foolah. Suppose you went there also, do you think
| should find yourself at home? Seriously, DARBY, do attend
Devizes, and let Persia alone. Do you apprehend us, GRIFFITH P
LQRD PALMERSTON “thought” it was not usual to sit on the Derby
Wednesday. (Laughter.) It is very usual to sit on that day while c.
is at lunch, as Lord PALMERSTON shall see if he will come up to Mr.
Punch's drag, opposite the Grand Stand, and try his Moselle.
There was a long discussion on the Irish Poor Relief Bill, in the
course of which it was suggested that if a deserted and unknown child
were found, it should be brought up in the religion of the policeman
who might discover it. . The course might be about as rational as
certain other courses which are adopted in such cases.
Friday. LoRD DERBY is a sportsman, and probably a fisherman. At
all events he knows that when we are going to fish for gudgeons, we
... the bottom, and throw ground bait about. There was
going to be a great party-battle in the Commons, and MR., DISRAELI
would like to catch all the votes he can. So on the Third Reading
of the Budget Bill to-night a debate upon our Finances was got up
and LoRD DERby expressed the terror and horror which he was kind
enough to feel, about our condition. He dwelt upon, the necessity
of economy, and went as near as was decorous to implying promises
that if a É. Government should come in, there should be con;
siderable reductions in the national expenditure. The ultra-liberal
gudgeons began to cluster round the bait next day; . The debate was a
spirited one, MR. GLADSTONE was severely pitched into by his enemies,
and not very warmly defended by his friends, and before these lines are
read by creation generally, it will know something of the result of LoRD
DERBY’s baiting. - -
LoRD PALMERStoN, by way of foiling the plans of his amiable oppo-
nents, gave notice of an amendment to the motion which was to bring
on the fray. MR. STANsfeld, the Radical member for Halifax, is to
make a Retrenchment motion, and Lord PALMERstoN, the Conserva-
tive Member for Tiverton, is to move, as amendment, that the House
is of opinion that the nation must be protected, but that it is E.;
with past and hopeful of future reductions. 'In effect, the try
moves a vote of confidence in itself. -
MR. Roebuck had a grievance. One Jones has called himself
HERBERT without buying a Royal Licence to do so—these licences are
expensive luxuries. So the Lord CHAMBERLAIN won’t let him be pre-
sented, the Horse-Guards won't call him HERBERT when he comes out
as a militia, man, and SIR GEORGE GREY won't call him JUSTICE
HERBERT. TEAR’EM says that Jon Es is wronged, and this important
question is to be brought before Parliament. - -
A debate on the Purchase and Sale of Army Commissions followed,
on a motion of gallant old SIR, DE LAcy Evans, who, Mr. Punch is
sorry to say, was almost inaudible, and SIR. G. Lewis had to re-state
the case for the veteran." ionſ, STANLEY spoke very strongly nst
the system—will LoRD STANLEY's father alter it, if he comes in P. LoRD
PALMERSTON, who has taken to quote a good deal of Latin lately, said
In dubiis siste, which MR. Cox applauded, thinking PAM meant that the
purchase arrangements were a dubious system, j that he was opposed
to them. But MR. Cox's applause was premature, as his lordship
went the other way. So did the House, having been frightened by
being told that it would take Seven Millions of money to re-arrange the
Army, and the division gave 247 to 62 in favour of non-interference.
But LoRD STANLEY prophesied that “in a quarter of a century, not a
rag of the purchase system would remain in the British ſº il
the last day of May 1887, we shall take the liberty of recalling the words
to his Lordship's recollection, in the mean time we hope he will enjoy
himself, and will begin at the Derby on Wednesday, when, if he does
not mind meeting PAM, he also may come to our carriage and liquor.
An Irish §. brought up MR. Scully, and of course “the
Honourable Member had scarcely uttered a sentence when the House
was Counted Out.”
An Out-of-the-Way Journey.
WE read that the ARCHDUKE MAXIMILIAN is coming over to the
Exhibition; . It is very strange—we didn't know that Kensington was

crown and sceptre and coronation jewels. We hope that MEssRs.

Extraordinary Gallantry of French Husbands.
A FRENgh manager has hit upon a beautiful expedient for filling his
theatre; which was §§ not patronised at all. He has advertised
that ladies shall be admitted at half price, the children at quarter price,

BEST JAPAN BLACKING !
(Being impressions de royage from the journal of TAR#-No-OUICH1-SKIMOD-ZUKé-No-KAMI,
Japanese Envoy Ertraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary).
E are now settled in our new
abode, as guests of the British
barbarians at the Yamun of
Claridge, where the Bar-
barian Government pays our
bills, and give us every faci-
lity for studying the institu-
tions of this strange country.
In obedience to instructions,
we daily record our impres.
sions of these Western bar-
barians of Great Britain, who
differ in many respects from
their near neighbours the
French, but whom, on the
whole, we prefer to their
brethren across “the chan-
nel” as the narrow sea which
separates the two countries
*lºgland and France is
€0.
“The French appear to us
less hopeful subjects for the
Sº influences, of Eastern civi-
lisation than the British,
who are at once humbler in
their natures and more imita-
tive in their habits. The
- French seem to think Paris
the centre of the Universe, and are quite satisfied with their country and themselves. The
English, on the contrary, appear to take pleasure in nothing so much as in grumbling at their
climate, their institutions, their manners, their food and usages. Three-fourths of their
journals, indeed, are filled with such complaints. Surely a people so quick-sighted to what
; wrong, is worth teaching, and will repay such missionary efforts as we have opened the way
Or.
to us worthy of record, whether for future reference at home or for confirmation of what
would hardly be believed, on the strength of description alone, however positive and precise.
Thus the extraºrdinary ugliness of these Western races would not, I am sure, be credited in
Japan, though I and all the other members of the Mission were to exhaust our language—rich
as it is in epithets of disgust and deformity—in describing the hideous faces, the absurd dresses,
and the preposterous manners which we see on every side.
“The colour or complexion of the people, of all classes, from the great Tycoon PALMERSTON
down to the lowest coolies who minister to our wants, is a hideous red and white, which our
painter has carefully imitated in the portraits he has made wherever we go, in order to
satisfy the Japanese Government and people that this colour is not only natural but universal.
No such thing is here to be seen as the rich olive green, which is the complexion of manly
beauty, as dead, white, with a tinge of yellow, like the hue of the leechee as it approaches
to maturity, is that of female loveliness. The teeth, even of the Tycoon, the Daimios and
the rich, are invariably white. The nation is, of course, ignorant of the use of betel, and
has no equivalent for that exquisite enricher of the breath, and invaluable preservative of
the gums. At Greenwich, however, MATSADAIRA Iwai.ME insisted that he observed betel in
common use among the aged criminals of the sea-service who are shut up in that place of
punishment... I cannot verify this. But, if it be true, it is only of a piece with other con-
tradictions of usage and good-sense prevalent here. To #. criminals betel would not be
more ridiculous than to cut off their hair, while those at liberty go about with their heads
unshaved. Yet this is certainly the practice of these English barbarians.
“But the red and white cheeks, the white teeth, and long hair, covering the whole head, are |W
not the only sources of that º: which impresses is so painfully. "The dress of the
males, which envelopes the whole person, is made tight to the figure, and always of thick
winter cloth, though the heat on some days renders even our silk dresses o pfessive.
Their boots envelope the whole foot, and often part of the leg. The easy and graceful slipper
is never worn abroad. Not even Daimios of the first rank carry swords, the military Daimios
excepted; but even they, strange to say, are only allowed one weapon. On the unshaved
i. a black stiff hat is worn, resembling a section from the chimney of one of those steam-
engines which the English use for so many purposes, and in the construction and employment
of which alone they may be said to manifest an a proach to intelligence.
“At the Qº. of the Great International }. (which is a Royal bazaar or place
of sale for all sorts of merchandise, taken as plunder from all quarters of the earth, and
which is kept by the º of the Mikado Victoria), we had an excellent opportunity of see
not only the Tycoon of this country, LoRD PAIMERSTON, and his Ministers, but the cousin.o
the Mikado, or spiritual sovereign, Victonia, (for they have copied our division of the duties
from the honours of sovereignty) who is the head Daimio of the military order, and man
other Daimios, civil, military and religious. Some wore dresses of red, some of blue, wit
gold lace, such as would only be tolerated on stage-players in Japan. But I must add, that
they seemed, for the most, part, conscious of their humiliating appearance. Some of the
Daimios of the Law, (which, with the usual perversion of reason here prevalent, is honoured
in this country,) carried on their heads strange fabrics of white hair, resembling the grass
head-coverings worn by our peasants and coolies in the rainy season. - -
“The women are even uglier than the men; their complexions more white and red, their
teeth whiter, their hair longer. Their dresses are also, if possible, more frightful. They are

gruelly treated. They are not allowed to chew
betºl, or to dye their teeth, or pluck out their
eyebrows; their nails are cut close; their robes,
which they are forced to wear, cover the whole
pº and are distended to an enormous size
y, hoops of steel, in which these unhappy
victims move about very much as malefactors
do among us, under the punishment of the canje
or perforated cask. We have been unable to
ascertain whether the women are ever let out
of their cages, but, from all the observation we
have been able to make, we fear that they are
Condemned to this torture night and day. At
least we have found them thus loaded at all the
houses to which we are invited, and where the
festivities continue long after midnight—for it
is one of the many absurdities of this strange
people to turn night into day, sitting down to
their principal meal after sunset, and, later still
assembling in great crowds in very small an
heated rooms, where no amusement is provided
beyond talking and stating, though food and
drink in abundance are always to be had in an
adjacent apartment. Neither are pipes smoked,
nor is betel offered, on arrival or departure, as
demanded by good manners.
‘Still, though thus repulsive in appearance,
and ridiculous in dress and usages, the barbarians
of Great Britain seem gentle, tractable, and
willing to learn. From the curiosity with which
they follow us about, it is evident that our per-
sonal charms, and the grace and convenience of
our dress have produced the strongest impres-
sion. Pictures of the members of the Mission
have already appeared in the newspapers and
are exposed for sale in the shops, and we may
therefore, hope that though nature has stamped
the race with the ineradicable seal of ugliness
they will not be long in adopting our graceful
manner of dressing the body, and arranging the
alr.
“Their machinery is certainly worthy of in-
spection. It is at present, entirely employed in
the construction of war-ships, cannon, and other
implements of destruction, We have been often
at Woolwich, and have informed ourselves as
to the manufacture of Armstrong-guns, shells,
rifles, and other weapons of war.
*The manufacture of cotton, to which the
barbarians were formerly devoted, is suspended
for the present, in order to allow the whole
means of the Tycoon to be applied to warlike
preparations. I cannot ascertain with certainty
against whom these preparations are directed.
I apprehend, however, (though there is a natural
reluctance among the Daimios to furnish, me
with information on political matters,) that these
warlike preparations of the Government are being
made against the ‘Vo-lun-teers,’ a large force
of armed insurgents, who are now gathering
themselves in troops, under military discipline,
all over the country, like the Taepings in China.
We frequently see armed bodies of these insur.
gents in the neighbourhood of London, and hear
the firing which attends the attempts of the
soldiers to disperse and put them down.” -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD DUNDREARY'S DERBY PROPHECY.
WELL now, I don't know how to º with my Prophecy, and I
almost wish that if. Funch hadn't asked me to do it for him, I mean
that I don't wish I had asked him to let me, . For I never made a
prophecy before, you know, except after it had happened, the event 1
mean, and that isn't exactly a prophecy, which means the foretelling of
events that never happen. I think that DR. CUMMING might have
done it, only you see that reverend doesn't attend races, and so he
could not be supposed to be up in the horses, for you can't have races
without horses, you know, except races of ginger, and it would be
ridiculous to prophesy about ginger, you must see that, quite ridiculous,
and you might burn your mouth like the man in the South eating the
road to Norwich—no, he couldn't eat a road, could he?-that’s not
right. Stop, doesn't Šiºrspºre-great creature, Shakspeare—say
something about seeming in running to devour the way? Couldn't de-
vour whey, you know, curds you might, though; but you can't º
about curds, except so far as sayin º are very.nasty. What was
saying?–0, yes, ginger and curds and prophecies, Well, only ºne
horse can win, that is quite certain, and he must be the winner, unless
he comes in after another; then he'll be second, or more than that
—second-hand in fact—a second-hand horse. You wouldn't like that,
would you? Stop, though, all horses must be secºnd hand, unless you
row dº yourselves. Grow them—is that right—do horses grow?
f course they do, some are taller than others, and so some of them
must be shorter, it’s ridiculous to say horses don't grow, like trees.
ertainly they do, and blow like trees also-will anybody tell me a
horse don’t blow? I dare say that Miss Todd blew—at least her horse
—she only blew up, when LöRD Knox was had up before Essex-stop,
that’s . right. Essex is a county and has calves, this was a coach-
man, he hadn't calves, footmen have calves though, which they stick-
at least they stick’em out behind. But Epsom is not in Essex, quite
the reverse, Epsom is in the Downs, where the British fleet was moored
when black-eyed Susan came on board. I like black eyes, you know,
not such as you get fighting, of course, but a lady's black eyes, though
very few ladies have #. eyes, I’ve remarked that, and a fellah that
would strike a lady deserves to be hanged—but I don’t mean that sort
of eyes, All in the downs—though—how can that be? ships can’t be
moored on dry land, but you’ll say, Epsom isn't always, dry. Anyhow
a ship can't sail there, ridiculous. Epsom Salts are not the salt º you
must see that. But about the horses, where’s the list? List, as Hamlet
says to the Ghost, because a ghost on the stage walks in list slippers,
very proper. Ace ºf Clubs—that’s a queer name for a horse-horses
don't go to clubs-asses do though, I believe. He's to prepare the way
for a Whitewall crack. What’s the good of pre for a crack in a
white wall, better stop it up, eh?-stop, yes, quite proper, then when
the crack comes you won't jump. Well, he won't win, unless, he’s
thrown down on the table, and you can't throw a horse, on a table,
though you can a pony. Next is a long word. Argo-dessay it’s a
mistake for cargo, these papers are so ignorant-stop, Argonaut.
Nought means nothing and that’s his chances. To be sure, WELLs
rides him, if he don’t ride something else, and wells are deep, you know.
WELLs? Ah! When he’s in the saddle he’s Sadler’s Wells, eh? I'll
send that to Punch. Stop, I can't do that, because I am at Epsom and
Sadler's Wells is at Islington, ridiculous, Well, here's Brighton, I
don't mean, the place, Park e super mare, you know, but the horse.
I think he has done all he knows, has Brighton, and it’s very pleasant
to go down and dine at the Bedford, and the asparagus is monstrous
good—not monstrous asparagus, I don't like that, it should be small
and green like an amethyst-no, amethysts, are not green, my aunt
wears one, and she isn't green neither, quite the reverse. I suppose I
mean an emerald, but emeralds are not like asparagus, youmust see that.
Cat-cat—yes, ºrer, that’s the comparative of cat, caterer or more
cat, very good name, easily said, sounds like flatterer, but Ishan’t flat-
ter this cat—this comparative cat—a horse a comparative, cat, con-
parisons are odious, so are cats to some people, not me, I like them,
when they don’t scratch. I don't think Caterer will scratch—horses
don't scratch, you know—I think he won't be scratched, but I don't
think he’ll be the first to scratch against the winning post. Clarissa
Colt, she must be a daughter of MR. Colt who revolved pistols in his
mind. What would be the good of that?, and what use is a pistol at a
race, unless it’s a º race, and you want to startle the men?
at least not startle 'em, or they wouldn't run well, of course; but
Clarissa-what a pretty, name, rhymes, fo. HARLowº-no, it don't
neither, what made methink of that? Well, she won't win-stop, it
isn't a she, but a colt. But they are all colts, it’s quite ridiculous
calling one by ashe-Christian name, it’s bigamy. No, it isn't quite that,
but she won't win, whether her father fires a pistol or not. "Cellarius,
that’s a good name, there used to be a polka called the Mazurka polka
—what’s that got to do with it? Now what º polking in my head?

fast horse the name is good, which comes of having a gentleman's
education. Everybody should know Latin, then we should all be gen-

Boots must be cleaned, you know, but the Latins didn’t wear boots,
which accounts for it. The Latin horse won't win. Now here’s a
long one. I should like to sneeze before I try it, for I shall never be
able to sneeze in the middle of that horse, like a Centaur. But it’s no

NAPOLEoN a humble cottage in Rome. Stop, was it NAPOLEON ? Yes,
he was King of Rome, that’s quite right, but it was ridiculous to envy
a humble cottage, he might as well have envied a humble-bee. This
horse—I can't say him in—he has been doing something at Bath,
erhaps getting his head shaved, to make him run lighter, and he
º; some of them-i am not fri htened, a nobleman ought never
to be frightened; noblesse oblige, you know, not that all the nobility is
obliging, quite the reverse; my uncle isn't, for he won't let me come into
his title, which is nepotism. This horse may win, if he can, that I am
nearly certain about. Spite, that's a good name, and easily said. I ..
Spite will win, though my Mamma used to * that it Hººd itself.
I don't know how a horse can manage that, but that’s my Mamma's
business, eh?. Now we come to The Marquis. What nonsense say-
ing the Marquis, and not saying of where—not Marquis of Ware, Idon’t
mean that, but of some place, and Ware would do as well as any where.
But º: a horse wouldn’t like to be a Marquis, I mean a Marquis
mightn't like to be a horse, and have his name in the mouths of all the
legs—stop–do legs have mouths?—I suppose so–I have heard of gout
in the gums, and that accounts for it. ell, as the Marquis is a noble-
man, that is a noble horse, he may have the Blue Ribbon, which is the
order of the Garter, you know, and it is always given to the winner of
the Derby, and LoRp DERBY is a Knight of the Garter, though he never
won, but the moral is the same. . But a Duke's higher than a Marquis,
though not higher than a marquée, or else he couldn't go inside it, you
must see that, and here is Duke Rollo. Some say WELLs may ride him,
but he can’t ride him and Gargº together—unless he puts a leg on each
and stands upright, and I don't think the Jockey Club would stand that.
Anyhow a duke is more entitled to a blue ribbon than an anonymous
Marquis, you must agree to that. Now then Zetland, he’s a free-
mason, at least Lord Zeri.And is, so Zetiand must be a free and
accepted horse, don't you see? Fancy ahorse a mason—wouldn't mind
being fired, eh? That's good, monstrous good. Now for another.
LQRD GLAsgow's c. , What's LoRD, GLAsgow’s c^ He isn't a bishop,
is he? Ridiculous, bishops don't keep racers. Dam—I don't mean
that, ſº know, but a mamma, a mother in fact, a parent as it were.
Dam by Orlando out of Broºn Bess, also another by Barbatus out of
Brown Bess. Then that must be the uncle of the other. Come, I do
understand a pedigree, if I don't understand anything else, which I do.
Then an uncle and a nephew are to run against one another. That's
more nepotism. And §. is the father of one. That's a good
father, but what the horse wants is a godfather. Why don't GLAsgow
name his horses? I suppose he's a Paedo-baptist, . As for harminster,
if it isn't a mistake for Westminster, where the Abbey is, you know,
and Parliament, only Parliament’s all at Epsom to-day—harminster’s
a winning kind of name, only you don't win with your name, except
when you are a lord, and want to be married, and as for Ensign, why,
bless you, my cousin BILL's an ensign, and he can't run a bit. To be
sure that’s right, because a British soldier–BILL’s an officer, but the
moral is the same—I say a British moral officer ought not to run. And
then Erchequer, what a name ! I’ve heard of runs on the Exchequer,
but never of an Exchequer running, though MR. GLADSTONE runs
on for any time. Fancy MR. GLADstone running for the Derby, quite
inconsistent, I, should say, and he had better be taking off taxes
han squandering his time down here, drinking champagne, which is
sure to disagree with him, and make him. fractious, like a baby when
you give him rhubarb on your finger, though I dare say MR. GLAD-
STONE's champagne is not made of rhubarb, and indeed he is not here,
which accounts for it, besides Erchequer being scratched. Neptunus
is the same as Neptune, who was the god of the inferior regions, and if
so, he must be an inferior horse, and not likely to win, though he struck
the earth, and carried off Porcupine to be queen down there. Stop,
was her name Porcupine, or Prospero? It could not have been Prospero,
because I have seen MR. MACREADY play that, but then to be sure it
was a revival, which is different. Also I think it was PLATO, at least I
know somebody reasoned well, and therefore he may win after all, for
there go eggs to the roasting of reasons. No, you can't roast reasons,
though you may bake raisins—something wrong there. Malak was
the name of MR. Costa’s º and I remember that did not run, so
perhaps this will not, and if he does not run he can't conduct an opera,
which MR. Costa can, nobody better, and here is St. Alexis. Putting
a saint in a race, what Puseyism' I suppose that’s in compliment to
MR. GLADSTONE, who has no business here at all, he hasn't, and indeed
he is not here, for it would not do to have a horse-racing LORD CHAN-
CELLOR, who has quite enough to do to feed his seals. Stop, though,
the seals feed #." have heard—I must ask DR. ScLATER the next
time I go to the theological ſº. call 'em that because Fellows
go there on Sunday. Well, that’s about all, and I should like to
sneeze. Eh P. But I haven't prophesied after all. Well, that’s ridi-
culous enough. Prophesy, let’s see, I’m to foretell what is to come,
that is, what is to come to the post, and come first. Well, noblessé
oblige, don't you see ? It wouldn’t be the thing for me—living under
his roof, don’t you see, at least you don’t see his roof, and I don’t live
under it, except when I’m acting, but the moral is the same. I mean
that it wouldn’t do, you see. Eh P. O, why, you must see that I could
only prophesy one way—it would be such a bad compliment to Our
American Cousin—at least he isn't an American, nor my Cousin, but he
erforms that part, which accounts for it. I couldn’t mention anybody
|. Buckstone. I want to sneeze.
PUNCH COUNSELLETH KING COLE.
TOUCHING THE INTERNATIONAL Exhi BITION.
QLD KING Cole, you’re a potent soul, and long may you potent be,
To wº design, in spite of the Nine, from the Boilers far
all ree
But now that from Boilers to Dish-covers you stretch your royal sway,
Attend, oh §so CoLE, to some, or the whole, of the things Punch has
to say!
The Nave to clear from its trophies queer, its telescopes, toys and trash—
Lewiſ º: and Kettle the question to settle, who made the original
lash-
Was º a work you couldn't shirk, though pity might wring your
SOul,
For the trophy-erectors whose quondam protectors, not they, should be
hauled o'er the Cole. -
But rememb'ring, oh King, who begged them to bring their furs, toys,
stuffed beasts and banners—
Poor oil and Italian warehousemen!
tanners!—
How FAIRBAIRN bored them, and DILKE implored them, how my Lords
and BARING said ditto, -
How they passed the designs, and set out the lines these temples of
taste must fit to,
By the light of facts seeing whose were the acts, that this rubbish set
In array, - -
Say, in reason fair, who the cost should bear of clearing the rubbish
Poor toy-makers, furriers, and
away
The sons of trade who have here displayed their furs, soap, pickles, and
eet,
Or the Lords of taste, who would have them placed where they have
come to grief? -
If Trophy must turn to Catas-Trophe, whose task is 't the Nave to rid,
The º * bade the Trade to build, or the Trade who but
uilt as bid?
Next, oh KING Cole, in the matter of Toll—not the bells that jingle
and jangle,
But the ºil upon printers, purveyors, and all, o'er whose charges the
public wrangle, .
Those who, here, take sticks and umbrellas, or, there, keep the doors in
a certain angle-
The toll that makes flimsy catalogues, stale buns, weak coffee and tea,
The toll on this, and the toll on that—the pervading penny fee—
Mr. Punch would suggest 'twould be obviously best, for these too keen
money-makers,
As matters stand, with the acres on hand, to get rid of their penny-wise-
acres.
Remind them, please, that this grabbing at fees, from tradespeople and
contractors,
Is what Punch has lashed play-house managers for, and other vulgar
exactors,
Who not content with a fair per cent. from their shows in an honest way,
Try each dodge and do from their subs to screw, what at last Joh N
BULL must pay. -
So,if printers, purveyors, and all that tribe, must tip the Commission a fee,
Why, printers, purveyors, and all that tribe, will gnaw it from you
and me.
Then, mild as new milk, drop a hint to DILKE (not telling him whence
you stole it), -
And instil the persuasion, that, spite of WESPASIAN, of some coin one
may say “Olet.”
More Plague than Prophet.
SEVERAL thousand lires have been given away at Naples as prizes
for the races. Our Racing Prophets, though they can scarcely be called
rizes, are the only ones that are connected with the races in Ém gland,
ut as far as that goes, we will back them against Naples, or a quack
doctor, or a tombstone, or a cheap tailor's advertisement, or even a
New York newspaper, for being the greatest liars in the world.

The great difficulty in Photography is to get the Sitter to assume a Pleasing Expression of Counte-

LEGAL PROFIT AND LOSS.
ONE attorney has been struck off the rolls
this week. That is all very well, but, then on
the other side 101 attornies have also been
admitted. That is a clear balance against the
ublic of One Hundred Attornies! This is
rightful to º though it is some com-
fort to know that there is one attorney the l
in the world. The gain is but small (it is like
destroying a single rat), but then small gains
are sometimes, the sweetest. . By the bye, we
have been º told for a long time that the
profits of the Law had been sofearfully cut down
that it was no longer worth any one's while to
follow it as a profession. The pickings must
still be plentifully large, when we find so many
hundreds ravenously eager to rush to the plun-
der. In the meantime, we look upon the above
fact of reducing the number of lawyers, thºugh
it is only by an unit, as the best bit of lº
reform that we have had for a long time. We
suppose that striking him of the rolls was in-
tended as a punishment, though it would puzzle
the wisest man to tellus whereinlies the severit
|of that punishment inflicted on a lawyer whi
consists in making an honest man of him?
A Consuming Shame,
THE Southerners have been burning all their
tobacco, not to smoke it, but to destroy it. We
suppose they would find some justification for
this under BURNs' Justice.” However, it is the
old story—the Torch of War always did its best

LORD PALMERSTON'S COACHMAN.
. (From the New York Herald.)
JEFF DAVIS (now uncommon near being hung) is not the only
so-called statesman who has had his secrets betrayed when he least
expected it. We were the first, and indeed the only journal to publish
the revelations of his Coachman, an intelligent nigger enough, and
worth a dozen, as a literary man, of such bungling writers as MAssa
GREELEY., .We gave the information º: by the nigger, who, as
he sat on his box, heard Davis confide his treasons to º: wife, and
little, dreaming that such revelations would very soon instruct our
enlightened citizens, as to the character of his infamous criminality,
Now we have caught another Coachman, Not a nigger this time, but
an Irishman. He has just arrived in our free an º: country,
and hastens to repay the hospitality which has raised him from being a
serf under the hoof of aristocracy to the attitude of a man, by di g
what is likely to interest us in reference to one of his 1. masters.
His name is PHELIM. O'SHANNERY, and he was for some months the
Coachman to EARL PALMERSTQN, while that Minister's own old driver
was ill. It was PHELIM's task to drive EARL PALMERSTON to the
House of Lords, where he initiates those financial measures which are
†: pHN Bull not without his roaring like John Qaly-into
an abyss of bankruptcy, and ruin. But that's JqHN's business, only
don't let him, after insulting us in every way, apply to us for a loan to
help him. Perhaps, if he can make out a good title to Ireland, and we
don't happen to take it without asking his leave, we º do a little
business with him in the way of purchase, but there will be time to
talk of that when we have seen how we like Canada. It will take us a
year to º; aristocratic notions out of the Canadians,
PHELIM O'SHANNERY, as we have said, used to drive his Earl and
Marchioness down to the House of Lords, for LADY PALMERSTON, like
other Englishwomen, is devoid of that retiring taste which makes our
matrons eschew all scenes of political strife. However, poor wom
she is no worse than others, and if she chose to sit in the ventilator o
the House of Lords, where our polite cousins place females, and thence
to listen to the diffuse budget speeches of old PAM, we may pity but
cannot assail her. On the way to the House (St. Stephen's "C #.
PAM used to pour into the ear of his wife all his intentions, politi
intrigues, hatreds, plots, and Macchiavellisms. His Coachman states,
that on the box he could distinctly hear, every word. He says that
LORD PALMERSTON always expresses the utmost hatred for this
country and her citizens, that he never alludes to us, even in a woman's
presence without an oath against “those Yankees,” and that he has
often told the MARCHIONEss IPALMERSTON that if he could only hear
that New York had been swallowed up by an earthquake, he should die
happy. . He used to boast to her of the sums which he had made
… #. GLADDY” (MR. GLApsTONE) take to Lord SHAFTESBURY
to be sent over to the fiendish abolitionists here, and he expressed to
her the most, indecent joy at a family affliction which, has recently
visited the White House. When MR. SEwARD's magnificent and un-
equalled despatch on the Trent question arrived, PAM burst into tears,
and cried all the way down to St. Stephen's, continually exclaiming to
his wife that he had nobody who could write like that, nobody who
could write like that On his wife's trying to console him by suggesting
that he could write much better (we smile at the womanly falsehood in
consideration of its object), he groaned still louder, and then com-
manded her to drop the subject. But it is not often that he is in low
spirits, and whenever the lying journals of the South haye reported a
reverse to our arms, he has dwelt on it º in his ride to the
Lords, and has vociferated his hope that hundreds of the infernal
Yankees have been blown to Old Scratch. LADY P. is not entirely
without womanly feelings, and urged that they were to be pitied as
fellow creatures, upon which he threatened to strike her, and utterly
denied that they were anything of the kind, but incarnate fiends. He
may think so again when our brave fellows sack Broadlands en route
for filthy London.
Such are among the revelations of the honest O'SHANNERY, but we
have not told a quarter of them, and we shall have another batch of
such sensation matter, hot and hot, for our purchasers of to-morrow.
Q English journal would have the wit to collect, or the cou to
publish such things, but indeed, it is almost unworthy, this mighty
nation to compare its majestic and omnipotent organs with the coarse
and timid rags called newspapers in rotten Old England. It is likening
the torpid, foul, sullen brook called Thames, which stagnates in slimy
course along the greasy warves of Belgravia, poisoning and stupifying
to the glorious outburst of the giant Niagara rushing in might and
majesty, and scattering millions of sparkling diamonds from the pure
crystal of its matchless waters.
The Coachman will be on view, and for interrogation, at our office,
corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets, daily from Ten to Four, on a
H. of 25 cents per visitor. elfixed, the amount at 25 cents,
ecause we happen to know that, the “Little Willain” of the Times
and MASSA GREELEy, negrophile, have not twenty-three between them
in both their ...; hº and we have no immediate
desire to have our man pumped for the benefit of the wretched rags
edited by these shining lights of jobbery and treason, . But, if MAssa
GREELEY will hang himself, like a gentleman, we will let in the “Little
Willain” for nothing.

would freely fling
their crowns into
SIR WENTWORTH
- DILKE's Exchequer
for admittance to a cricket match P." say, by Turks and Chinamen,
or Dutch and Japanese. . A grassblot might, be hired of the Royal
Horticulturists in the gardens which adjoin the Exhibition shed, and
this would doubtless be sufficient as a ground for foreign cricketers, who
are not such hard hitters as WILLIAM CAFFYN or GEORGE, RARR. We
should immensely like to see whether a Frenchman would look funky
when bowled at º a Swede, and what sort of a waddle a MyNHEER
WAN DUNGR would make of it when exhorted by the bystanders, in
Dutch, to “run it out !”. Qf course the Japanese and other petticoated
people would make use of their long clothes, when they took the place
of ſong Stop, and it would not much, surprise us to see a fat...old
Turk, who feared to hurt his hands, take his turban off, and use it as
a cup to catch a ball in. -
hat sort of an idea the Portuguese have of the game may in some
degree be guessed by the following account of it, which has been trans-
lated from a Lisbon paper. There are Englishmen in Portugal as
everywhere else, and wherever there, are Englishmen of course there
will be cricket. Clubs have been established at Lisbon and Oporto, and
it was on the occasion of a match between these clubs that a sporting
Lisbon journalist thus cleverly explained the nature of the game, for
the instruction and perhaps amusement of his countrymen:-
“CRICKET MATCH.-To-morrow there is to come off an interesting game of
Cricket Match between the Cricket Clubs of Lisbon and Oporto. The object of the
formation of these societies is the playing of the game of Cricket Match, an active,
running, driving, jumping game, which only can be played by a person having a
good pair of legs, and in a climate where warmed punch is found insufficient to
keep up the animal heat. Does the reader wish to know how to play at Cricket
...? Two posts are placed at a great distance from one another. The player
close to one of the posts throws a large ball towards the other party, who awaits the
ball to send it far with a small stick with which he is armed. The other players
then run to look for the ball, and while this search is going on the party who struck
it with the stick runs incessantly from post to post, marking one for each run. It
is plain, then, that it is tº the advantage of the party that strikes the ball to make
it jump very far. Sometimes it tumbles into a thicket, and the players take hours
before they can get hold of it; and all this time the player does not cease running from
post to post and marking points. Then those who find the ball arrive, exhausted,
at the field of battle, and the one who has been running falls down half dead." At
other times, the projectile, sent with a vigorous arm, cannot be stopped, and breaks
the legs of the party who awaits it.
“The arrangements for the Cricket Match include a sumptuous dinner in the
marquee for fifty persons, an indispensable accompaniment to every Cricket Match.
We ". ºrhaps, assist at this great battle, and hope the committee will place us
at a safe distance from the combatants, where the principles of the game can be
seen with the help of an opera-glass.”
How accurately the º: are acquainted with our habits, and
what a true conception they have of our cold climate, if they ſancy, that
warmed punch is insufficient to keep up a right, degree of vital heat,
and that we are forced still more to heal our blood by the “active,
running, driving, jumping game of Cricket Match!”. How true it is
moreover, that sometimes when the ball is made to “jump very far,'
the players take some hours before they can get hold of it, and all this
while the man who hit the ball with his “small stick” keeps on
running between the wickets—we, mean to say, the posts—until the
scouts, “arrive exhausted at the field of battle,” and he himself."falls
down half dead!” Such incidents as these are, we know, continually
occurring now at “Lord's" §. way the sporting foreigners who
chance to see this name no doubt imagine we play “Cricket Match” in
our House of Peers); and no wonder that we English are looked upon
as lunatics º other nations of the world, while they have such true con-
ceptions of the perils of our pastimes and the madness of our sports.
W v “sº
|Aw
“BIRD-CAGE WALK.”
THE only real Bird-Cage, Walk that we are acquainted with is, not
the one in St. James's Park, where there is not a to be seen,
excepting the one perhaps that officiates as a lock-up in the St.George's
Barracks; but Little, and, Great St. Andrew Streets, in the Seven
Dials, where, from the number of bird-cages that line nearly both sides
of the streets, the Lover of Promenade Concerts can enjoy, and without
the slightest charge, music of almost every clime. It is a large animated
edition of Little Warblers. The feathered, songsters are perpetually
.# and fiorituring. So intense is their rivalry, that º newer
seemingly enjoy five bars’ rest. The wonder is that they do not wear
their little throats out.
“A HARMONIC MEETING HELD HERE EveRY DAY.” would not
make a bad inscription for the vocal streets—and it is a meeting, too, at
which every one present is º." only too *::: to favour the
company with a song, and without being even as º or in the least
pressed to do so. The little MARIQs and PATTIs must be ve happy,
for we notice that they always, sing, gally, no matter where they may
hang out. In this respect, Messieurs les. Etrangers, who are over here
on a flying visit to us, and who make a point of grumbling at everything,
might take rofitably a musical lesson from these harmonious j,
monitors. e strongly recommend, those unhappy birds, the Asso-
LANTs, Táxtens, et compagnie, not to miss going to this, the only
original “Bird Cage Walk” in London, where they will be able tº
judge for themselves, how very happy the natives of many distant and
sunny countries can be, even though it is their melancholy and seedy
lot to be caged for life in the very centre of this foggy, suicide-inspiring,
wife-selling, spleen-breeding metropolis, called London. The sight may
do them good, and they maybe perhaps sofar carried away as to forget, for
a moment, their bro if cares and jaundiced ennui by bursting into
an involuntary song. They would then be cured in an instant, for it
is a zoological fact that the Frenchman who sings is himself again.
St. Andrew Street is only a vol d'oiseau from “Leysester Sguair.”
DO NOT CALL NAMES.
THE HON..AND REy. BAPTIST Noel, has been making a speech, in
which he refuses to be comforted touching the state of religion in
France. It is true that Frenchmen laugh, he says, at the priests, but
this does not indicate enlightenment, but rather a hatred of all religion.
France is given over, he states, to a "ſº Pantheism.” R.
Noel is a good man, but we suspect that Exeter Hall does not quite
understand all that it talks about... We know that every man who does
not go to three services per Sunday is an Atheist, and that every man
who is never heard to swear is a Deist, and that there is a pleasant name
ready for any other man who does not please anybody else. What
MR. NoFL and his friends call Pantheism may, in a great, many cases
be the habit of mind that is averse to appealing to, first causes and
using solemn names upon occasions, and specially on slight ones.
Persons who write that they “will come to tea, D.W.," (or who use
English instead of the Latin initials), do not comprehend the reluctance
of other persons to venture on such familiarities, and would probably
call a man a. Pantheist who should say that all the works of Nature
deserve reverent admiration. Whether there be anything philosophical
in such Pantheism or not, there is certainly none in the Christian
teacher who condemns a nation that, has got so far as to laugh at
priestcraft. It is something to get rid of Mumbo-Junibo-a worthier
culte may follow.
“PAY HERE.”
EveRY little article that enters the International Exhibition is made
to pay toll...Of course there is a food tax that the refreshment con-
tractors will have to fork out, and we should not wonder if the
Exhibitors will not be made to hand over a penurious per-centage,on
all the goods they sell. Twopence is deducted from every shillin
catalogue, and there is scarcely a portable article that enters, or is detain
at the doors, that is not charged something, even if it is only a miserable
penny. It is this spirit of greedy avarice that has characterised the
management of the Exhibition from the very outset, and tended so
effectually to lower the high purport of its mission in the estimation of
foreigners as well as ºf shmen, that we think it is time to change
the name of the Royal Commissioners. Out of deference to their
trading propensities, would it not be more appropriate to call them the
-4 Royalty ” Commissioners?
Fined Five Shillings.
WRITING on the Norfolk deluge, a contemporary says:-
“The damming proceeds very slowly, and the impatience of those whose property

A SHOWER OF COPPER.
THE Punch-bowl Plea may appropriately be recalled by Mr. Punch.
In answer to a demand for compensation for a punch-bowl that had
been lent and broken, a defendant pleaded three defences. First, that
the bowl was broken when it was borrowed. Secondly, that it was
whole when it was returned. Thirdly, that he never had it at all.
But instead of three contradictory†: being put in, just now, in the
case of Mr. Punch, he, to his no small amusement, finds three contra-
dictory accusations made against him.
He happens to have excited the simultaneous wrath of Three Public
Instructors, who instruct the public for the small charge of one penny
per daily lesson, and do it very decently—at the price. -
The Morning Asterisk has discovered, and declares, that he is an
Aristocratic Swell.
Mistress Harris has discovered, and declares, that he is a Low Radical
who has been lately bought by the Reform Club. And,
The Penny Gusher | has so named itself) has discovered and declares
that he has been told that it would be the decorous thing to turn
Tory, and that he has turned accordingly.
. Perhaps it is not for Mr. Punch to seek to weld the triple allegations
into a consistent charge, before meeting it. , And yet, with all the chi-
valric courage and generosity of his mature, he will do so.
The Star is wrath with him because he has pointed out that Peace.
...; doctrines are un-English and irrational. The Standard is
wrath with him because he has pointed out that the Tories may snatch
a few little victories, or even a large victory, but that the country has
no confidence in the Tories, and that Mrs. Harris's advocacy does them
no great good. And the Daily Telegraph is wrath with him, because he
has pointed out that before gentlemen º in for gushing apologies for
criminals, lit is well to hear the whole case, and because the Times
happens to have cited Mr. Punch's mild remonstrance, against
-- #. which process the Telegraph announces that it rather likes.
hus welded, the united complaint against Mr. Punch is, that he has
told the Truth.
He begs to plead a Justification.
And he begs to add, that he means to go on telling the Truth, and
when the Asterisk, the Harris, or the Penny Gusher will help him to
proclaim it, he will a plaud them to the very echo. -
And when they º not, he must tell it, and—he weepingly but firmly
adds—he must tell the truth of them—“ or any other Man!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FANCY PORTRAIT OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO KILLED THE
GREATEST NUMBER OF SMALL BIRDS.
[To be hung up in all Sparrow Clubs,
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 2. Monday. In reply to a question by Lond RAVENsworth
about Breakwaters, the gentle Duke of SoMERset replied in his usual
mild and affable manner, that the Breakwater Committee seemed hardly
to have known their own minds when º, came to a conclusion, that
the Admiralty had got enough upon their hands, and if they had not, it
would be ridiculous to try experiments on so small a scale as the Com-
mittee, had recommended. Private people might try experiments, if
they liked. It seems to Mr. Punch that the Duke himself would not
make bad material for a breakwater, in which all that is wanted is
rough, obstinate angularity.
Mr. Punch mentioned last week that the Conservative Member for
Tiverton, better known as LoRD PALMERSTON, had met the tactics of
his antagonists by giving notice of an amendment to M.R. STANsfeld's
economy resolution, which was to come on next day. The Tories then
sought to trump PAM's card by another amendment. They wanted to
damage and discredit the Government, but by no means, to force PAM
to extremities. So they, pro hde vice (no, dear Cox, not because he was
thought a hack, or had any vice) deposed MR. DisRAELI from the
leadership of º and wanted MR.HENLEY to take the command.
But he was unable to do so, and therefore they selected MR. WALPole,
who is what the Catholics, mean when they put R.I.P., after, the
announcement of a demise, that is, Respected in the Parish. There
was a gathering of some hundred and eighty-six Derbyites in St. James's
Square, and they agreed to support MR. WALPoLE. To-day he gave
his notice of amendment, which was to the effect that the House hoped
that Government would endeavour to reduce the expenditure, in a way
which would not only equalise revenue and outlay, but would afford the
means of reducing the Income Tax. He did not name the odious tax,
but alluded to impositions of a temporary and exceptional character,
and we all know what that meant. This was the ingenious plan which
was to make the Government as uncomfortable as possible without
bringing on a crisis. LoRD PALMERston is very fond of whistling as
he goes, though not “for want of thought,” and the policemen ...i.
in Piccadilly inform us that he whistled a new and choice selection of
airs on his way home that night. - -
The Four Conveyancing Reform Bills were read a Second Time. But
Hylar in limine latrat. SIR Hugh CAIRNs gave notice of battle, and
hinted that if MR. BRAND, the whip, had not been very active that
evening, the Government Bills º have been demolished there and
them....The struggle will be to send the Bills to a Select Committee,
or, failing that, to make mince-meat of them—in Parliamentary words
to give the most careful discussion to every clause—in Committee of
the whole House.
Tuesday, Eve of the º The whips of MEssRs. H. GRIMsHAw and
AsHMALL had a good deal to do with getting Members to London;
but neither were those of Colonel, TAYLOR and MR. BRAND idle, an
the House was crowded. While LoRD PAIMERSTON, was, on the
ºf night whistling “Come, if you Dare,” a bright thought came
into his head To-day, as soon as the decks were cleared for action,
the PREMIER rose, and with a mischievous glance at the Opposition
ranks, calmly intimated that inasmuch as MR. WALPoLE's amendment,
if carried, would be º to a vote of Want of Confidence in
Government, the best thing would be to throw over other questions,
and fight out the battle on the real point between parties. Then LoRD
PALMERston sat down.
“When this was said, no Congreverocket
Discharged into the Gallic trenches,
E'er equalled the tremendous shock it
Produced upon the Tory benches.”
. With a few adroit words, the PREMIER had run, like the Merrimac,
into his enemy—and the illustration holds water (as the Cumberland
did), for he made a great rupture in the enemy's side. MR. Disraeli
sat still, but if it be not profane to seek to dive into the recesses of his
statesmanly heart, it may be supposed that his feelings were complex,
that he was not unamused at the discomfiture manifested in the ingenu-
ous face of MR. WALPole, or displeased at the blow delivered upon the
Fº whom the Conservatives had chosen for º commander,
ut that he rose superior to such considerations, and hoped that MR.
WALPope would pick up the glove, and go in for a faction fight., His
valiant hopes were blighted. MR. WALFolº had no orders to fight on
PAM's terms, and therefore instead of opening fire, he complained ear:
nestly of the PREMIER's conduct in º: to force a vote of Want of
Confidence, which MR, WALPolº would certainly not endeavour to get;
MR. BRIGHT did his best for the Conservatives, and strongly ed
that this was not a party question, but a national one. Then -
STANspelp made his speech, which was moderate enough. He depre-
cated our heavy outlay forwar purposes intime of Fº but had noidea
of changing the Government and handing over Italy to the “tender
mercy” of MR. DISRAELI, LoRD PALMERSTON, answered with much
decorum, º that his own amendment should be carried, and
É." the invaluable promise, that if it were adopted, Government would
eel themselves bound to look very narrowly into the Estimates for next
year. This promise deals something rudely with the popular super:
stition that Governments were always bound to such vigilance and
always exercised it, but we live and learn. Then he renewed his de-
fiance, and begged the other side to be manly. - - -
MR. DisRAELI was obliged to rise, and he made a speech in which it
was evident that he had every desire to be manly, but that he knew his
men would not follow him, so he ridiculed the “queerness” of LoRD
PALMERston's language, and declared that his friend MR. WALPoLE
resembled a Derby favourite who should bolt. MR. HoRsMAN bestowed
some impartial abuse all round, and MR. Cobden, ºf him
on deserving his title of the Mirror of Discontent, supported MR;
STANsprld. But PAM had made it all safe, and men of all sorts rushed
together into the lobby with the PREMIER, eager to prevent a cata:
strophe which would send them to the country. The division gave 367
for No Dissolution, and 65 for MR. STANSFELD and retrenchment.
Some angry words followed. MR. WALPole withdrew his amendment,
declaring that LoRD DERby had not the least desire to oust LoRD
PALMERston, MR, WHITESIDE scolding and showing that he for one
would have gone in jovially for battle, MR. Osborne describing the
whole business as “a solemn sham,” and saying that the favourite had
not bolted, but had been “got at ”—our friend B.O. is not alwaysfasti-
dious in his language—MR. DisPAELI said that MR. WALPQLE ought to
have known enough of Parliament to be sure that his amendment would
be met as it had been (a well-delivered slap at the 186 who had thought
themselves so clever) and SIR. W. HEATHcote, Conservative, º
MR. DisPAELI for such censure, LoRD PAM's amendment was agree
to, the Government thereby carrying a yote of Confidence in itself, and

course everybody is bound to believe it; but it woul
took place, and from circumstances to which it is unnecessary to reſºr,
only that some of them were iced, Mr. Punch has not the faintest idea
aS % any of the other proceedings of the day.
Thursday. Festival of SS. Soda and Brandy. Some Lords met, but
the transaction of any business being repugnant to their feelings, they
handed over the Works of Art Copyright Bill to a Select Committee,
and rose for the holidays.
The Commons were livelier; but MR. Scully attempted to revenge
his incessant Counts Out by trying one for himself. . This was cruel,
because he knºw there were lots of fellows about, lying on benches,
or sleeping, and what was the good of bothering them to come from
one room to another? In they came, of course, expressing the kindest
wishes in reference to Scully's ulterior | ". and the House being
once made º on until one in the morning. An Irish debate
woke the Members up a little, and they used some strong language,
PALMERSTQN º that the Irish were so fond of protecting
criminals, that it was difficult to deal with Irish crime, LORD FERMOY
attacking SIR ROBERT PEEL for insulting the priests, SIR. G. Bowyer
complaining of the Ecclesiastical Titles' Act, and other Irish Members
declaring with much iteration that the priests were not to blame for
the incessant murders. When a thing is asserted many times over...of
- give a livºlier
colour to the case of these priests if they would one and all deliver
from their altars the most §º curse which Rome can, devise
against, murderers. . Instead of... that, the Roman Catholic bishops

which F. these offences;” and an Irish peasant, with, a gun
in his hand, and a hedge between him and the black hearted yillain
who asks for rent, may not construe that euphemism with desired
cxactitude.
Then MR. RoPBUck brought up the grievance of JoNEs, who chose
to call himself HERBERT. SiR GeoRGE GREY made some º:
but the question whether a man may change, his name without royal
licence, and how long he must have been known by his new, name
before officials are bound to recognise it, was, left in cloudiness.
Mr. Punch's opinion is, that any man who changes his name, except in
conformity with the will of a generous testator, is #. If he makes
himself a somebody in this world, his old name will become, a distin:
guished one, and if he remains a nobody, what in this world does it
signify what he is called?
Civil Service votes, and the Museum vote were taken, and MR;
WALPOLE announced that, at Fº the Library Authorities would
remain content with excluding the Boys. The course is *...' lin-
partial, and will certainly not be effective—it is not the boys who direct
circulars out of KELLY, or read the boºks that can be got at MR.
MUDIE's. Announce that all tickets will expire on New Year's º,
and in the mean time prepare a revised list, O MR, ANTONIO PANIzzi!
And so, a little after one on the morning of the Oaks' day, Members
went home to bed, in order to be off, next day to see Feu de Joie
astonish the wise men of the turf by beating the favourites, another
outsider coming in second. Nobody has been right or anything like
º this year, except Mr. Punch's |"; the LoBD DUNDREARY,
who announced with a distinctness which his rivals would do well to
imitate, that Caractacus might win if he could, and Qaractacus could
and did win, and Mr. Punch is, as usual right again; in fact he is
always right, and not any other man.
PAM AND THE MATCH.
(A Trooper's Ballad of the Great War of the Parliament.)
QII, of all the gallant captains that ever I did see,
There’s none like gallant CAPTAIN PAM, where'er the others be,
He'll laugh and chaſ before the fight, and, the hurley-burley done,
He'll laugh and chaff as gaily as before the fight begun.
'Twas in the dull year sixty-two, that we beleagured lay,
By RHPERT's horse in greater force than CAPTAIN PAM's array;
And, in our hold, lukewarm and cold we had traitors not a few,
Ready to ope a postern gate and let the Ruperts through.
BLAGK BEN he was a captain that RUPERT's colours wore
But little cared which side he fought, or what the flag he bore;
A wily blade that never staid by honest pass and guard,
But knew some woundy secret thrust to get beneath your ward.
A ready tongue, a readier hand to strike a bargain rare
Than to keep it, when from talking it came to doing fair;
And we knew that hand and tongue at work, a tampering with our men;
Oh, for such mischief-making commend me to BLACK BEN
We had sour ones, we had soft ones, some that doubted CAPTAIN
PAM,
Some li'd spited, some he’d slighted, some that called him cheat and
Snam ;
Some that liked more prayers, and some more grub, and some less money
Spent,
Some that won as how the men should know which way the money
went.
We knew BLACK BEN was at them, a poisoning their minds,
And a-spiriting up mutiny and mischief of all kinds,
And it wasn’t much surprise that soon the spark came to a flame,
Young STANSFELD 'twas, from Halifax, that as their spokesman came.
With malcontents and mutineers, that by him swore to stand,
Sour Scots and surly, English, a grim and grumbling band.
There was roaring White and crowing Cox, and nip-cheese WILLIAMs
00,
And Presbyterian BAxTER blew trumpet for the crew.
With broadswords bare and matchlocks yare, came on the rebel
But CAPTAIN PAM, for all their threats, he never turned his back
“Be-swinged or swinge, nor cant, nor cringe will I for mutineers,
Stand by your Captain who so will: he owns mo ſaint-heart fears!”
pack,
When sudden came a flying scout, with face all white and scared,
“Look to yourself, good Captain, see your defence prepared;
Here's RUPERT's horse upon us: the outer works they win:
Hard odds, I doubt, 'gainst foes without, and mutiny within'"
Then the º flash'd high in the Captain's eye. “Stand fast my rear-
rank men;
Herein I see the º of that old fox, BLAck BEN. . .
But if they think Old PAM's a wink when danger's near his post,
Both foes without and foes within, they count without their host.
“Front rank! right face! quick march!” a-pace up to the wall he
strode
Where, . in force, bold RUPERT's horse with CAPTAIN WALFOLE
rode :
They had passed the outer barbican, the advanced works they had won,
Without the swinging of a sword, or firing of a gun.
Before their host up to our post BLACK BEN he rode alone—
“Now yield the place, nor look for grace: how 'tis inside is known.
Of RUPERT's stalwart cavaliers ill º: thou bear the brunt,
With the mutineer to gall thy rear, while we assail in front.”
A scornful laugh laughed CAPTAIN PAM—“Who talks of mutineers?.
What hears BLAck BEN from RUPERT's men, if e'er he opes his ears?
But muttered wrath, and muffled scorn, and mutinous debate
How best to rid their ranks of one, detected but too late.
“I parley not with such as thou—but, CAPTAIN WALPole, hear—
I know you for a gentleman!, Ware,ere you ride too near.
Thought you to catch the old weasel asleep upon his watch?
The platform that you stand upon is mined: I hold the match'
“You’re strong, §. say, and I am weak; but weak an’ if I be
I hold your dissolution between my fingers three. . .
Advance a gun—though 'twere but one—the match is to the train,
And your host is blown in fragments that 'twere hard to knit again!
Be warmed: retire, or else I'll fire!” And, oh! 'twas rare to mark
How from man to man a paleness ran, and Ben's swart face grew
dark;
“Now charge for RUPERT!—charge!” he cried, but none struck spur
1n flank;
And deaf the ears they turned on him, and cold the looks and blank.
Then answered CAPTAIN WALPole, a civil-spoken man,
“Or weak or strong, you do us wrong, we'll not storm, if we can;
We would but ask a parley, and exhort you lend your ears,
To friendly counsel; such may come, from foes or mutineers.
“Put up . match, a spark might catch-lo i. where we retire
Troop ! threes about !” Wain BLAck BEN's shout, “Stand, cowards!
Stand and fire tº -
They never looked behind them ..... the fiend the hindmost catch!
The ground was cleared . . . and loud we cheered, as old PAM blew
out the match

The grub which they eat most of is not good for man;
it is a maggºt, and a noxious one, which devours an
amount of producevery much exceeding their little pickings.
The bushes of corn, currants, raspberries, and cherries
which used to be swallowed by them, are few in number
compared to the bushels of caterpillars which abound in
consequence of their destruction.
Goldfinches, hedge-sparrows, and other small birds, have
actually been imported into Australia from this country for
the †† purpose of consuming a troublesome weed;
for little birds, be it known to Johnny Raw, not only cat
worms but weeds also. The particular weed which they
were wanted to check, is the thistle, of which nuisance
a Scotchman, out of nationality, had sown some seeds at
the Antipodes, where, consequently, it is overrunning the
land. He was an ass, and deserved to reap the crop of
what he had sown, for food, and to eat no other; but the
farmer is, as great an ass who tries to extirpate the spar-
rows, and finches, and warblers that snap up the blight

wireworm, the green caterpillar, and the daddy-longlegs.

SINGING FOR SOLDIERS.
... A Goon deal has been said about the evil state of Aldershott, and the
ill condition of all our garrison towns. The vices rampant there, are
in chief degree assigned to the want of fit amusement to fill up leisure
time, of which our soldiers, when in garrison, have much more than
enough. We know who it is finds mischief still for idle hands to do;
and doubtless soldiers are, when idle, not more proof against temptation
than are other mortal men. What then is the remedy? What whole:
some recreation can be devised for the amusement of our soldiers'
leisure time?, Reading rooms, says one; athletic games, another;
music and part-singing is the answer of a third. Well, all these hints
are good, and the two first have been acted on in so many cases, and
with such success, that Punch may well be spared more writing in their
favour. But in teaching soldiers music no great deal has yet been
done, and as the practice of part-singing is a wholesome, healthy exer.
cise, Punch most willingly will give it what encouragement he can.
Used to obey orders, and accustomed to be led, soldiers, properly
instructed, would soon learn to sing together, and Punch feels sure
that their so doing would soon become a pleasure to them. Learning
to keep time is a pleasant way of spending it; and when men have
studied harmony, there is surely the less chance of their giving vent to
discord. Nothing lightens labour so well as a good song. It makes a
long way short, and would therefore be invaluable to troops when on a
march. Singing MENDELssohn's part-songs, and similar, good vocal
music would be a better pastime for our soldiers when at leisure, than
sitting in a pot-house bidding Sally to come up, or squalling other
specimens of stupid nigger nonsense. Men whose, business is to kill
are often troubled to kill time; and in this respect the practice of part-
singing at least would be a help to them.
With this faith in his mind, Panch would fain direct the notice of his
fifty million readers to the fact that now among the thousand and one
concerts which are almost daily advertised, Soldiers’ Concerts are at
no far distant intervals announced. In his programme the Conductor
of these Concerts “begs to state,” and Punch hereby accords him full
º so to do, that they are given “with a view to create a taste
or good choral music in the Army, and to encourage the practice
of singing on the march, and the formation of -choral classes in
garrisons, whereby much of the soldiers' leisure time might be usefully
occupied.”
Held in Exeter Hall, these Concerts were by no means the least nice
of the May. Meetings which have this year been assembled. At the
last which Punch received an invitation to attend, free admission was
accorded to a couple of thousand soldiers now garrisoned in London;
and this gift, to Punch's thinking, was by no means the least pleasant
of...the charitable donations which have this May been announced.
Without dis ement of orators who plead for funds to furnish tracts
to niggers, who can't read, Punch must own a sneaking preference to
listen to the voices that “ discourse eloquent music” to the soldiers at
these Concerts; and at the risk of the displeasure of all Truly Pious
people, Punch will own he thinks encouragement of Music in the Army
quite as laudable an object for the bumps of the benevolent as the
º straps, and braces to nude natives of Natal, or providing
moral polish for the black king of Japan.

A BITTER EDINBURGH BAILIE.
—3)
T the Edinburgh Town Council,
the other day, according to
the Scotsman, the LoRD PRQ-
vost of Scotland's metropolis
gave a long account of the
H. that he had taken to get
he original programme of the
rocession at the opening of
he International Exhibition
altered, the LoRD MAYok of
DUBLIs ousted from the place
that had been assigned him
next the Lord MAYor of LoN-
DoN, and himself, the LoRD
PRovost of EDINBURGH, put
in his place, as the position of
honour. We are sincerely sorry
to find that the meritorious
and successful, exertions of
Edinburgh's Chief Magistrate
to maintain the precedence of
Scotland met with no better
acknowledgment than the fol-
lowing effusion of cruel irony:
* Battle Blackadder said that
before Bailte Boyd should propose
his motion, he wished to move a
vote of thanks to the Lord Provost
for having represented the Council
at the ceremony at the opening of
the International Exhibition. He
had been told by those who were
resent at the ceremony that his
rdship's appearance on the occa-
sion was equal, if not superior, to the appearance of any one else there ſlaughter),
that his bearing, and the robe he wore, gave him more the appearance, of a noble-
man than º else. (Laughter. ey were therefore much obliged to his
Lordship for making such a creditable appearance, and for the pains he took toget
his proper position; and also for having exerted himself with reference to the
§º. and other matters connected with the affairs of the city."
Oh, what a BAILTE BLACKADDER thus to bite his Provost with fangs
sharper than a serpent’s tooth—more venomous than that of a gobra or
a rattlesnake! As a brother member of the Free Kirk, and ſellow
labourer in the field—we must not say vineyard-of permissive Maine:
law legislation, one would have expected this most ungracious, and
uncanny Bailie, in any remarks which he might have thought fit to
make about his superior, the Provost, to have erred, not on the side of
venom, but on that of slaver.
Innocent people, who do not see through BAILLE, BLACKARDER's
satire, and take it all for serious adulation, will say that the Bailie’s
remark, that the bearing of the Lord PRovost, and the robe he wore,
gave him more the appearance of a nobleman than anybody else, shows
that he never could º seen a nobleman except on the stage. But
of course BAILIE BLACKADDER has never set his foot in a theatre; and
in saying that the robe which the LoRD PRQvost wore gave him
the appearance of a nobleman, we are afraid he, intended to
insinuate that the object of his mock eulogy deported himself like a
pompous buffoon. FIELDING says that the º appearance of
Joseph Andrews was such that, to persons who had never seen a noble-
man, it would have conveyed º idea of nobility. . It cannot be
supposed that, BAILIE BLAck AnneR is so little acquainted with the
aristocracy as to imagine that noblemen are accustomed to strut about
in a robe like that worn at the opening of the International Exhibition
by the Lord Provost of EDINBURGH.
A. WHIMSICAL ERROR OF POPERY.
WHAT strange ideas Roman Catholics of extreme opinions, appear, to
entertain about other people. The Tablet, having mentioned that
lately the Pope held a public Consistory in the Sala Regia of the
Vatican, proceeds to make the incomprehensible remark which con-
cludes the subjoined passage:--
It was one of several consistories that will be held (the rest semi-public only)
preliminary to the Canonisation of the Japanese martyrs next month, which is at
present arousing such mingled emotions of joy and hope, rage and fear, in Catholic
and infidel hearts.”
How can an infidel, who believes in no saints whatever, be inspired
either with rage or fear by the Pope in pretending to createnew saints,
and so, as the unbeliever conceives, perpetrating a solemn humbug, or
making a fool of himself? Perhaps the Tablet accounts all Protestants as
infidels. The British Public, however, at any rate, views the canonisation
of the Japanese martyrs with perfect good humour. It regards, that
proceeding, as a grotesque mediaeval ceremony, with a kindly and not
quite irreverent derision. If the canonisation were an auto-da-fé, pro-
tected by, French bayonets, then, indeed, Britons would certainly
contemplate it with great rage, and perhaps with some fear; but, as it
is, they consider it merely an act of credulous assumption. Never-
theless, as they suppose, that in its performance the Pope is really in
earnest, they, contemplate him, therein engaged, with a certain degree
of respect and veneration mingled with hilarity, just as they look at a
work of, early. Art, representing a Bishop with his head awry, in an
impossible attitude, working a stupendous miracle by means of the
crook which he holds between the backs of his hands.
THE GEM OF THE SHOW.
CoME, grant the unfortunate Beggars' Petition,
The Royal Commissioners’, down on their luck,
Come, letus be off to the Great Exhibition,
Qur shillings will count when the balance is struck;
And really there’s plenty to see for your money,
Smart are the booths at the Kensington Fair,
And when the day's decently *...*and sunny,
You lounge up an appetite pleasantly there.
First, in the East you will witness afrolic, a
Mild “Water-Frolic,” as kitchens would say,
See the girls dart past the splashing Majolica
Fountain that threatens a douche with its spray.
Boom, on your left comes a summons like thunder,
Those Blue-bells of England your patronage crave.
When ſº got rid of the water and wonder,
Stroll with us down the kaleidoscope nave.
What is the elegant object that tickles
our fancy-those onions, and catsups, and soys?
Hush, and don't laugh at the trophy ºPickles,
But look with delight at that trophy of Toys.
Beauty in both; if you cannot discernit, you’re
Dunce of our Great International School: -
Well, here are walking-sticks, fenders, and furniture,
Now feel aesthetic and don't be a fool.
Here's something better—the jewels—but no, pal,
Think not that crinoline crowd to invade,
But, if one can't get a glimpse of the Opal,
The ancle’s a substitute freely displayed.
There is a beacon, and that thing in plaster
Is Milan-no-no, it’s the Bourse at Berlin,
That lighthouse, which looks like a great pepper-castor,
Is moved by some wonderſul º within.
You don’t seem to care—we will try iſ sensation
From painting will touch that unmalleable heart:
MR. HAwTHoRN remarks, in his book, Transformation,
“The Shallow and Hard make best critics of art.”
Now, don't pull a face as if BENTLey on Phalaris
Asked you to lecture, in classical Greek,
There isn't in Europe a sight like these galleries,
Filled with a show that is work for a week.
There’s British art—while a critic’s true pen holds his
Own, let him challenge a rival array;
Look at the LAwRENCEs, Hogarths, and REYNonoses,
Look at their pupils, the Men of the Day.
Come where the foreigners’ colour and action
Ought to relax that dissatisfied glance,
Look at their limning of female attraction,
Costumes from Eve to the EMPREss of FRANCE.
Still you seem bored. We shall kick up a shindy, a
Row, we may say, if you cut it so fine:
See you that spot in the Gallery next “India,”
See you a case where some volumes recline?
There is the Gem of the whole International,
Go, find it out, and we’ll give you some lunch.
Excited at last ! Ah, we thought you were rational.
Yes, you behold the RE-Issue of PUNCH !
Art is Long.
We should º that Art in many cases was extremely long, for
looking at the Nelson's Column and the Guards' § it would
seem that we are never to see the end of them.

to your Crinerlines, my dears. Mine's all in knots with 'em."
JAPAN AT EPSOM.
(From TAká-No-OUIchi-Ski MoD-Zukš-No-KAMI, &c. &c., Japanese
Envoy Ertraordinary, to the Head Daimio of the Department for
Correspondence touching the Barbarians. Wagasaki.)
“TRULY these English Barbarians are a wonderful people. We have
already seen the houses and feasts of their Daimios, their Parliament,
or national talking-house, their great Exhibition, their, Woolwich, their
wax-works, their garden of wild animals, their coal-pits, and their
manufactories, and we are indeed very weary, and long much for the
time when we shall return to our beloved Japan. But we had not yet
seen the strangest of all the strange sights here, what may indeed be
called the day of the going forth of the people of London—the feast
of Dar-bee.
“Dar-bee is the name of one of the Great Daimios, the chief of the
party opposed to the present Tycoon PAR-MER-STOON. But how this
feast comes to be called not after the name of the reigning Tycoon, but
of him who is now plotting to get his place and his power from him,
we, your humble slaves, cannot explain. But it is the opinion of MATsA.
DAIRA IWAIMé, a man of sagacity and learning, that the feast is in
honour of an Ancestor of the living Daimio DAR BEE, who, according
to the religion of the Barbarians fº worshipped under the symbol
of a horse, is reverenced with processions and races of horses, such as we
yesterday beheld. The living Daimio DAR-BEE much loves horses, and
races of horses, as we are told by our attendant MacDonald.
“All the Barbarians in their chief town of London are compelled to
celebrate this festival, which is held at a place called Ep-sum, seven li
distant from the capital, situated among hills, and approached by many
high roads. Those who cannot buy or hire horses to carry or draw
them thither, are compelled to go on foot, and all the inhabitants of
London assemble on the hills of Ep-sum, overlooking a smooth space
of green turf, which is an enclosure sacred to the great ancestor I)AR-
REE, and is guarded by police-men in blue garments. Even the great
Tycoon PAR-MER-STOON himself is compelled to take part in these rites
and the Councils of the Nation are closed, that all the Daimios and
A FRENCH PORTRAIT OF JOHN BULL.
THE English are a nation of shopkeepers, and their
national business is carried on by PALMERSTON AND Co.,
GLADSTONE is the cashier of the concern. DERBY AND
Co. constitute the Opposition firm. Their shopman is
DISRAELI; he mounts a platform and offers superior
articles at reduced prices, like a cheap Jacques. The
Houses of Lords and Commons employ, themselves in
making out bills. The Church calls itself an Establish-
ment, like a haberdasher's shop, and, the bishops and
clergy everywhere recommend, their cloth. Preferment
is sold by a subterfuge which eludes the simony-laws, and
prºmotion in the Army is a recognised commodity of sale.
The British Courts of Law are almost wholly occupied
in settling affairs of pounds, shillings, andT. and the
Universities have adopted a system of Free Trade, of which
the soul is competition. The English never go to war but
with an eye, to the main chance. They disregard glory
because it does not pay, and they maintain sailors and
soldiers in relation to their neighbours, as among them-
selves they keep police to protect the shop against the dan-
gerous classes. MR. Cobden is their commercial traveller,
and he advises them to consult the safety of their goods by
practising infinite complaisance towards their customers,
and punctually executing all orders received from France.
THE GAOL AND THE WORKHOUSE.
THE Newcastle Daily Chronicle contains the report of a
mendicity case, in which the defendant was an old man
named Michael GANNON. It thus concludes:—
“P. C. MACMANEMY said this morning at ten o'clock he was on
duty in the North Road, when he saw the prisoner solicit alms of a
respectable man, and he afterwards went to several houses and ad-
dressed abusive language to the servant-girls. He has been frequently
in Durham and Morpeth gaols.-ALD. Dodds. We shall send you to
the House of Correction for three months, and if you don’t cease
from your practices you will have to be sent to the Workhouse.”
The remark above ascribed to ALDERMAN DoDDs inspires
us with respect for him. We regard AIDERMAN Dopps as
quite peculiarly entitled to be styled “the worthy Magis-
trate.” He is worthy of a testimonial for a *|† Satire
that was not to be expected of an Alderman. He sends a
Old Mrs. JAMBorough (who has come up with J. to see the Exhibition). “Those tramp to the House of Correction, and threatens him with
masty scrowging Umlibusses may be wery convenient; but Lauks / they're Ruination the Workhouse. Thus, whilst he pronounces a satirical
sentence, he administers justice with mercy.
Counsellors, and all their servants, may go with the Tycoon to the feast
of the great ancestor DAR-BRE.
“We journeyed in two morimons, drawn each by four horses, wishing
to show our respect for, the religion of the Barbarians. For all the
seven li, the road was full of carriages and horses carrying them that
journeyed to the feast. They recited loud prayers, and sang odes to
the ancestor, and played on musical instruments, like to the straight
horns used by sellers of fried fish in Japan, as they moved along in
procession. For all the seven li these worshippers showed us much
respect, lifting up the fore-finger to the nose, and extending the other
fingers outwards, which is their greeting of honour in public, and calling
out “Hul-loo, cri-kee / meaning, ‘Oh, beautiful and wonderful?" They
also expressed aloud their admiration of our persons and our garments.
Our hats, which I and MATsADAIRA IwaiMé wore because of the sun
which shone this day—a circumstance not frequent in the country of
England—were much praised, and º (as º: to us by
MAGOONALD) asked at what place such hats, could º (in
the Barbarian language ‘Ooo-is-yoor-hatter?') I bade him (MAcDo-
NALD) tell these inquiring Barbarians the name of the merchant in the
Street of Hatters at Nagasaki, of whom we purchased our travelling
.# of hats, and when I see the Daimio Rus-sool, I shall propose
to him the opening of a trade in these hats, which the Barbarians so
much admire. This will give exceeding satisfaction to the Barbarians
}. our manufactures, and cause great gain to the hat-makers o
apan. Also, observing us to use our nose-papers, many asked us if we
had sufficient thereof—the words ºf in their language, ‘How-are-
yer-off-for-pa-per!’ the meaning of which words MACDoNALD taught
us, telling us tº answer in the Barbarian tongue, “You-bee-blode!”
which means. Thanks be unto you, O people, we have, sufficient for
our needs.”The Barbarian tongue, as your serenity will perceive, is
rieſ, and a few words mean much.
“Qn their way to this feast the crowd stopped at certain small
temples by the way-side called ‘turn-pike,' where invocations were
uttered in a loud voice, and small pieces of coin given to the priests
doubtless in payment for prayers, or for propitiation of the great ances-
tor DAR-BEE. At other temples by the way-side meat and drink,

offerings were made by the Barbarians. Also priests in ragged
mourning garments, with dust upon their heads, and bare-footed, ran
by the way-side, with prayers inscribed on papers which they offered to
the people for money. Of these *..."; we have bought some for
depºsit in the archives of the department for Correspondence with
Barbarians.
“When we came to the place where a seat of honour was prepared
for us, we saw that all the Barbarians of London were indeed here
assembled. The growd was as the crowd of flies about the honey-pots
in the market of Nuku Haima, and the shouting as the roar of man
waters, and the horses and the carriages more than could be counted.
And we saw the Tycoon, PAR-MER-STOON, in common garments like
other men, with many counsellors of the Mikado and Daimios, and all
the Parliament of the nation, in an enclosed *:::: below where we sat,
and many of them had little books in their hands, and they stood in a
ring, and wrote in their books, and uttered invocations in a loud voice
sounding like I-lay-five-to-one,' ‘Six to nine—on—Buckstone.”
“I-take-it-, which we believe to have been prayers or religious
exclamations, but they were not clearly explained to us, as indeed one
interpreter was not sufficient for the many strange sights we saw that
day.
N. After awhile, all the people gathered in two rows, with an open
green space between them, and a dog was let loose, and the peºple
shouted as if devoting him to the evil, powers, to which indeed
we believe the unclean animal to have been offered as a sacrifice.
Then came forth horses, of exceeding height, but, more thin than
storks or flamingoes, with men on their backs in bright ſº
and the people shouted, and the horses º loped up and down liké
the wind, more and mºre joining them, till at last º all disap-
peared round the hill in front of us, and by the aid of the glasses which
make far-off things near, we saw them, a mile and a half away.
of a sudden we heard a beii and a loudshon , and the growd swayed
to and fro, and we felt our leads go round by reason of the crying and
the multitude, and in two moments after the bell, we heard a great
roaring and a great sound of horses’ feet, and behold something rushed
before us, but whether it was horses or men, or soldiers, or railway
carriages, we knew, not, and then the people poured into the † space
which they had abstained from till now, and we were told the feast
of Dar-bee was over, and there arose a noise as of pistols, and our
hearts turned to water, but MacDonald told us to be of good º:
for it was the corks of the wholesome medicinal drink called by the
Barbarians ‘sham-pain,’ of which we have often drunk, for it is good
for the stomach in this country. Then all the multitude took food, and
the means of spreading it out before them from their carriages, and
drink, and began eating and drinking much in honour of ‘Darbee,” for
this is a part of the festival which must on no account be omitted.
"We are told that many Daimios give many thousands of taels at this
festival to the priests of Dar-bee, who tend and do honour to the
sacred horses, who are kept for this curious festival, and that there are
many Ilaimios who keep sacred horses for the feast, such as we had seen,
tall and strong and exceeding thin, and men in bright garments to ride
upon their backs... But all these things are am º to us, and our
heads stillache with all we saw and heard that day, though, we took
many bottles of the Barbarian medicine “sham-pain’ to cool us, and
give º to our bodies.
“Why all the Daimios and the people of all ranks down to the lowest
coolies flock to the festival, unless it be that it is enjoined by religion
we cannot tell. . The way of seven li is very sore to travel for heat an
dust and crowd, and MATSADAIRA Iwanić thinks it is a journey of
penance, laid upon the Barbarians by their priests, and I agree that
this is probable, though MACD9NALp, when we asked, said it was
‘sport,’ a word meaning ‘play' or “pleasure.' ... But how there can
be play' or “pleasure’ in suspending the Councils of the Nation, and
the business of the capital, and journeying seven li, through heat and
dust and crowds, to see many tall and thin horses galloping madly for
two moments like railway engines that, have run away, and in paying
many thousand taels to the priests of the horses, neither I nor MATsA.
PAIRA Iwantſ, can understand. We believe there is some meaning
in this, which the Tycoon does not wish us to fathom. Indeed there
are manythings just as difficult of comprehension, about which these
Barbarians clearly wish to keep us in the dark. When we inquire, they
give us reasons which would not satisfy children, much more men of
statecraft and learning. ...
“Of all their strange things, certainly, the feast of “Dar-bee" is the
most strange. What passed onour road home is littleknown to me. The
medicine 'sham-pain,' among other qualities, causeth sleep to descend
on the eyes, and I think Islept, for when inextremem er, I was in
my bed in the Yamun of º and my head ached exceedingly by
º of the much thought I had given to the strange things of this
y." ,

Harmony for Mexico.
The idea of the concert in which England, France, and Spain were
to take part in Mexico, has been abandoned, and instead ºthat per-
formance, France will oblige the Mexicans with a solo.
THE CAT’s WALK-
ID you ever, beloved reader
of Punch, call acat to you?
Of course you have done
so., And, supposing Puss
to be affable, and willing
to accept your invitation,
she has come, but how?
First, she looks away at
the fire, and stretches her-
self, and yawns, as if
nothing were further from
her intention than taking
notice of you. Then, gather-
ing herself together, com-
posedly, shegivesan earnest
gaze out of window, at the
#. on the housetop.
Then she comes, tortuously,
in your directi
ection, now
taking a circumbendibus
round the leg of a chair,
which she fondles, and now
making an episodical tour
round the up leg of the
table. Still purring, she
approaches you, and finally
comes tº you on the other
side from that to which you invited her. But there Puss is at last, and
you applaud her docility. -
RAbelais speaketh of certain Furred Law Cats, and speaketh well
concerning them. It was thought that the race had died out, and
lawyers have assured us, with some emphasis, that anybody who thinks
unfavourably of the Law, theoretic or practical, must.be a dull fool,
who takes up old conventional notions. If they say sº, it mºst he true.
Yet, Themis Fº us, we could not § thinking of the Cat's Walk
when we read the able judgment in which a few days ago an admirable
judge disposed of JoANNA Southcote. - -
º was an Exeter maidservant, who was born in 1750, and died
in 1814. At the mature age of forty-two JoANNA announced that she
had a divine mission. Most people think that she had no grounds for
that allegation. But solately as 1851 four congregations in England

with Law and Southcotism, he came down and delivered judgment.
He said that JoANNA was a fool, for “she had imagined that Providence
had selected her as a special instrument to promote some good in the
earth.” But there was nothing so immoral in her writings as to compel
him to declare the gift invalid for that reason. Luckily, however, a
bequest for printing works of a º tendency was a “charitable”
bequest. Had the will been properly made, the Court must have given
effect to the intended Charity. But ANN's lawyer probably knew more
of JoANNA Southcote's works than SIR. WILLIAM BLAckstone's, and
forgot the Statute of Mortmain. A devise of Land for such a purpose
was void-so. ANN Essam’s relations will have the real property, and
there will be no extra diffusion of the doctrines of the unreal
prophetess. -
oubtless, the result is what was to be desired. But, doth, not
Equity make her promenade a little in the fashion of the Cat's Walk?
The Literature of the Hustings.
MR, SLEIGH is very unfortunate in his elections. He is about to
º his experience in a volume, of "Rejected Addresses.” It will

Table-Turning Parliamentary.
THE performances of MR. Howſe, the medium, in the way of table-
turning, have been surpassed by Lººp, PAIMERston. The noble
Wiscount, the Member for Tiverton, and Prime Minister, has completely
turned the tables on the Opposition.

CoME, cheer up my lads! if to battle we steer
We’re proof 'gainst all shot, not a foe need we fear:
With armour well shielded, all danger we brave,
For who are so safe as the sons of the wave?

With guns ever ready,
We steam on so steady,
We’ll fight and we’ll conquer again and again.
We’ve no masts now to lose, not a sail, not a spar,
No splinter can fly, iron-cased as we are:
Safe and snug on we steam, ne'er turn tail, never shrink,
Unharmed, a whole fleet now with ease we could sink.

But four guns we mount, yet such big guns are they,

DIZZY'S CONSCIENCE.
In the debate on MR. STANSFELD's motion, Dizzy is reported to
have said one good thing:—
“The gentleman who opened the debate to-night, and to whose resolution I will
in a few minutes advert, really did not do me justice—not that I ever want anybody
to do me justice. (Lawghter.)”
No; we should think not. Give everybody his deserts, and an
unscrupulous place-hunter at least would not escape whipping. The
leader of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Commons may
be quite willing that some other people should be justly dealt with, but
he is far too good a judge to feel the slightest wish, and, indeed, not to
entertain the greatest objection, to have justice done to himself. We
should be very sorry to have justice done to ourselves if we had pro-
F. that the Government of England should truckle to foreign
yranny.
KING HANDEL AND KING PUNCH.
UNLIKE REx MoLUs, Rex PUNCH never º himself to puffing-
excepting when he has a good cigar between his lips. But KING PUNCH
must remind his music-loving subjects that he will soon expect their
º at the Crystal Palace, there to pay their homage to his royal
rother HANDEL. The majesty of HANDEL no one can dispute; in
simple grandeur he is certainly the king of all composers; and KING
PUNCH therefore rejoices in the prospect of a festival whereat with
fitting reverence his royal brother's dignity will be properly upheld.
Besides the truthful affirmations that we live on raw beef-steaks, and
sell our wives in Smithfield, our foreign friends have long been pleased
to say we English people have no taste for music, and that, empty
as our heads may be, we have few of us a hollow place to hold a tune
in. How far the Handel Festival will dissipate this notion, may be
determined by collectors of statistics on the subject. But surely some
among the Herrs, the Signors, and Mossoos, who in this Exhibition
year attend the Monster Exhibition of Music down at Sydenham, will
find some reason to believe in the existence of some Britons who have
somewhat of a liking for something like good music. A festival em-
ploying a couple of thousand voices, and giving pleasure, let us hope,
to at the yery least a hundred thousand pairs of ears, will surely be
some proof to the “intelligent foreigner,” that musicians like KING
HANDEL, are reverenced among us, without lessening the homage that
is yielded to KING PUNCH.
NoTE ON THE DERby.—They who depended on “prophets” have
experienced a loss.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 12th. Thursday. DR. BIRCH's young friends reassembled after
the Whitsuntide recess, and just as the Arithmetic Class was going to be
called up, MASTER CoRRY begged leave to ask a question of one of the
ushers, MR. LoRD C. PAGET. MASTER CoRRY said that the boys had
been laying out a great deal of pocket money in ships, and boats, and |h
was getting on very well in navigation. But a very important thin
connected with ships were docks, and he put it to the usher who h
charge of them when they sailed their vessels, whether the school-work:
men ought not to be told to make, some nice, large docks, as they had
nothing at present but some puddles in which the new ships could not
turn round. PAGET, the usher, answered that MASTER Corry had
spoken like a sensible and modest lad, and that the thing should be
considered, but he did not think there was much cause for complaint,
MASTER LAIRD said that at his friends' place near Liverpool they had
beautiful docks, which had not cost much money. Some more boys
spoke and MASTER J. PAKINGTON, was rather rude, and said he did
not believe that the usher meant to do anything, which was a shame, he
thought. However, as it was the first night, no notice was taken of
MASTER PAKINGTON's impertinence.
The Arithmetic Class was then called up, and "...ºf to the custom
at DR. BIRCh’s, Geography questions were interspersed. , MAstER F.
BARING gave a very nice account of Lagos, near the Gold Coast, and
told how iº. the King of Lagos, had been persuaded by the Eng.
lish, with the help of a few cannons, to gi
year. It was quite right, though MASTER BARING did not understand
it, to take this little king's power away, because he helped that wicked
savage, the King or Dºoney to steal men and women and sell them,
which Docewo could not now do. Master. Bºring made rather a silly
remark about the QUEEN having just as good a reason for taking Cuba,
as if Cuba belonged to savages, and not to respectable persons who
could be made to answer for any wrong they did. MASTER GREGoRY
explained the case very well, and nearly all the boys thought that
Ten Bºning had learned his lesson well, but could not make a good
theme out of it. A great many sums were done, and would you believe
give up his kingdom to the
QUEEN VICTORIA, who was to pay him a thousand pounds every
it, the boys sat up over the figures till half-past one in the morning:
Master Ossor NE said something which he meant for fun, and added
that he meant to moye, but DR. BIRCH reproved him rather severely for
making jokes, and MASTER OSBORNE held his tongue.
Friday. Majora canamus. Our legistators were to-night engaged on
matter for grown-up men. GENERAL BUTLER, the Yankee leader who
as possession of New Orleans, has issued a proclamation to the effect
that any lady of that city who shall manifest contempt for a Federal

Anything so brutal is not recorded in the º of any war in the Old
World or the New, and it will be difficult for the whole of Europe not
to feel itself in the position of the ladies of New Orleans, and to mani-
fest contempt for every Federal soldier until the proclamation is dis-
avowed and BUTLER dismissed. . In both Houses of Parliament to-night
the Ministers of England, amid the cheers of the assemblies, spoke
with befitting indignation of the beast BUTLER, but left the Federal
Government a loophole by imagining a possibility of the repudiation of
the proclamation. -
LoRD PALMERSTON silenced the eternal DARBY GRIFFITH very
funnily. DARBY had intended to speak about the SULTAN and the
PAshA, and to explain that the first lived in Turkey, and had a Seraglio,
and went to the Sweet Waters, and to Mosques; while the second lived
in Egypt, through which the Nile ran, and where the º: werc,
and the Sphinx, also many donkey boys, with other novel and valuable
information collected by the said GRIFFITH with patient study and by
examination of travellers... But PAM told him that it would not be the
right thing to talk about Egypt while the PASHA was staying here. So
DARBy shut up, and we hope that, hereafter, PAM will silence him again
by telling him that it is not the right thing to talk about Egypt when
the PASHA is not here to defend himself.
Then came a long and smart debate, in which most of the best men
engaged, and, as usual, the subject-matter, was infinitesimal. One

until the Italian outbreak came, and then MR, TAYLOR got into a
double scrape. He had a row with some Tuscan soldiers, his wife scolded
them, and he gave one of them a shake or something of the kind,

he was prosecuted and a heavy sentence was passed, which, however,
the Government remitted, pardoning MR. TAYLOR, and making the
prosecutors §§ expenses. Then some of the loose fish, who, under
the name of Garibaldians, behayed as loose fish generally do, landed
in the island and plundered. MR. TAYLOR considers that as the KING
of ITALy recognised GARIBALDI's acts, and the latter...recognised the

Law and Government are appealed to, but they do not see their way.

came out in defence of the Italians, while allowing the hardships of
MR. TAYLOR's case; MR. CAVENDIsh. BENTINGK, MR. KINGLAKE, M.R.

when they sing so
well at sight as those did at this rehearsal. Chorusses that long ago
have passed clean out of memory, and seldom have been sung since
HANDEL himself led them, were “rendered” in slang phrase, with a
fire and a precision that a rifleman might envy. Qne from Hercules
was given with a force it would have puzzled even Hercules to give to
it; and one from St. Cecilia's Day was sung in such a way, that, being
a good musician, the Saintess would no doubt have given her, ears to
hear it. There was a laughing chorus too (words written by MILTON,
music put by HANDEL–a fitting combination); and just fancy how a
laugh of two thousand horse power must have startled the staid echoes
of solemn Exeter Hall ! The singers indeed laughed with such a hearty
vehemence that Mr. Punch began to think that by some traitor in his
printing-office one of the jokes in his forthcoming number had been
sent to them; and the round of applause with which the laughter ended
very naturally served to strengthen this idea.
r. Punch knows no more of musical slangography than he does of
Chinese chaff, or the talk of Feejee fast men, So he will not plague
his readers by describing how the contrapuntal passages were rendered
what pains were bestowed upon the melodic progressions, and how we
the tempt were preserved throughout. It is enough for him to hint
that if the performance at the Festival at all equal the promise, it will
certainly deserve success, and will probably command it.
So Mr. Punch would say to every musical young lady, Haste thee,
Nymph, and bring with thee Pa and Ma and sisters three: Cram thy
carriage full inside. On the box let Charley ride. FREDERICK,
ARTHUR, and Augustus, if they’ve business to detain them, may rattle
down by train and meet you in the transept. Come all ye who music
love, and would its pleasures prove. Come and hear the Giant HANDEL,
and “see what mighty strides he takes” in his great works, Listen
for a while to his harmonious thunder, and let your ears be filled with
sounds that for a lifetime may prove a pleasant memory.

EMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN.
“My DEAR FANNY, - --- -
“You always readF. Times of a morning after your Papa has done with it, and
therefore know that some Frenchmen, over here on account of the International Exhibition,
have been writing to the Paris newspapers descriptions of our manners and customs, in
letters most of which are amusing from the monstrous blunders and bouncing stories which
they contain. Some, however, are fair and reasonable enough; for instance, one lately
quoted by the Morning Pºst, a paper, mind, which is, written, for fashionable readers. The
writer of this letter extols the beauty of English girls, but thinks his countrywomen have
the advantage in grace of manner, and the art of dressing. Well, my dear, this is a no smal
advantage—if they have it. Beauty, will, keep little better than mackerel, grace will last
much longer, and skill in dressing will enable a girl to make the most of herself, and also of
her clothes, so as, iſ obliged to dress cheaply, nevertheless to dress well. No, my dear, I am
not one of those old fogies who affect to ridicule girls' attention to dress, especially when it
is shown by them in making their own clothes. Certainly not. But now, here is a passage
from one of this French gentleman’s letters:– -
“Let me see how I can best give you an idea of the occupations of an English lady, the daughter of a ‘gen-
tleman." Mrs. M.'s MARY Augusta is, I think, about 20. "I find her in the morning, after breakfast, writing
letters. English young ladies are always writing letters. Then, later, she reads fashionable romances,
which, just now, are romantic histories of the clergy; a little later she is at the pianoforte singing a
German or * song. The young ladies of London will learn to sing in all languages—why, I know not-
it is the fashion. Later in the day she is at a flower-show or a concert, wherever there are most milords and
miladies. In England there are persons who Nº. to be in the same room with the first aristºrmºy. A ride
or drive in the park, dinner, and a ball or the Italian Opera close the day as in other civilised cities."
“There, FANNY, my dear, that is an observant foreigner’s description of the way in which a
large class of young English ladies pass their girlhood. Pretty spinsters, so called by the
rule of contrary, because they toil mot, neither do they spin, except round and round in
waltzes... Some, to be sure, there are who, although, like the rest, they can afford to be idle
and worthless, lead a life much above that of º . They visit the º: they super-
intend charity-schools, º attend lectures at the Royal Institution. To hear music they
o generally to Exeter Hall; to the opera now and then, when something is done there a great
eal better than La Traviata. They read good books, humorous and serious; habitually in
some measure exercise their intellect and higher affections, vehemently derided by grinning
elegant baboons. You are the daughter of a useful man, my FANNY; you belong to the
serviceable orders. You have been taught better than to fritter your time away. If you
were now to rise, or sink, shall I say?, into
the sumptuous classes, whose business, is to
enjoy themselves, such a life as that described by
the Frenchman would not be one of enjoyment
to you. No; that existence of frivolous mono-
tony would be a punishment and a bore....Some
girls in your station think they would like it;
ollow it as nearly as they can. It would be a
life good enough for them, too, could it last a
lifetime—if the butterfly could, as the silly old
ºf Says, § on roaming for ever from flower
to flower, till its extinction, poor insect! But-
terflies must be butterflies as pigs must be pigs,
and morally there is no difference between pi
and butterflies, except that pigs are profitable
whereas butterflies simply consume the fruits of
the earth. Well, now, my dear, suppose this
worse than swinish life ends, as it is meant to
end, in marriage.
“What think you, does a man marry who
marries a fashionable frivolous woman, however
beautiful? He marries a material. substance,
possessing pleasant physical properties, and no
ºthers that are pleasant to #. but a fool.
The highest sentiment that inspires it is, vanity.
He has a poor bargain. It is plump on the bust,
arms and legs, slim at the wrists and ankles,
white and red in the face. Its chief merits are
such as win º at a cattle-show, or are
highly commended by the judges. These qualities
gone, there remains a mass of matter, worse
than inanimate, for it has to be fed and clothed,
expensively. It is then like a horse eating its
head off; with this difference for the worse, that
the horse is put out of the way in a stable, as
the wife cannot be, but must be allowed indoors.
A, deluded man married her for her beauty,
taking her intelligence for granted, or fancying
he read it in her fine eyes, the large bright win-
dows of a little mind. Those eyes very, soon
ſº as dull as the soul behind them. Those
ips lose their form, and no longer impart a charm
to all the nonsense which that mouth utters.
The mouth is spoiled; and the nonsense is seen,
and said, to be dashed nonsense now...The
elegance of drill, dancing and deportment is re;
ſº by natural coarseness. The splendid girl
as fallen all of a heap into a lump, of flesh,
which is no company to its consort. Here
endeth domestic bliss. .. -
“Now you, my dear little FANNY, rise early,
get breakfast ready, read as I have said, your
Times, help make the beds, do a lot of needle-
work; lend a hand in the kitchen when you
have done work; study the literature of your
country, play one or two of BEETHoven's
sonatas, and sing, when you do sing, “He shall
Feed his Flock,” or something of that sort, go
to an evening party once or twice in the year
and out for a good walk every day. You will
marry a sensible fellow; for a fool would prefer
the material substance, in the shape of a deuced
fine girl at present, to bloat hereafter into a
martlemas of a female. Your husband will not
vote you a bore as soon as your cheeks have
faded, and you have become what the sarcastic
fops call passée. He will prefer your society to
his own, or to any other, and you will still be a
happy wife, when many, a bounding belle of
the ball has overblown into a flat-footed, gross
fat woman, with a waist like the middle circum;
ference of a beer-barrel, a short thick neck, and
no intellect: once pursued, now neglected; for-
merly the object of leering gallantry, at present
the subject of mocking fun; a being as ugly,
almost, as your affectionate Uncle,
“MUNDUNGUs.”
Out-and-out Profound.
It is not from the prosperous dwellers in for-
tune's sunshine that a wise man seeks to learn
true wisdom. When the philosopher wants to
know the temperature he goes to the thermometer
in the shade.

“DEAR PUNCH,
“Now that the Social Science Congress has just been sitting,
let me present you with a suggestion, which strikes me as a good idea
for ameliorating the behaviour of the industrious classes. The chea
excursion trains and steamboats, just now, take loads of them in all
directions, and empty them in large quantities over every spot frequented
by the right sort of people, especially watering places. Of course they
ought to be allowed change of air, though some fellows think that is not
necessary, but they have no right to poison the air which they exchange
for that of the slums with bad tobacco and onions; they should get out
of the way, and their women should not carry about children in arms,
#. i. nursing them regardless of publicity, and perhaps eating
Winkle.S.
“It strikes me that, since there is no law to punish the common people
for commiting these heinous offences, it would be a good thing if ſº.
would unite in an endeavour to º p a reform of their horrible manners
} means of practical example. I propose that, some of us fellows
should go among them as missionaries, to try and teach them better,
which would be immensely philanthropic, and quite a charity to other
fellows, who hate the sight of the People, and take no interest in elevat-
ing the masses, whilst they are inexpressibly annoyed, and disgusted
beyond measure, by their peculiarities—their language, voices, looks,
gestures, habits and ways—which no fellow can escape from observing.
“For us benevolent fellows who are not so fastidious, it would be
good fun, I say, to go and travel occasionally in the second class, with
the excursionists who have taken 38, return tickets to enjoy eight hours
wt the sea-side. Having gained their confidence by entering into conversa:
sion with them in a genial and familiar spirit, we might soon be enabled
to commence the attempt at their improvement. ith due gentleness
and delicacy we could venture to point out to them their characteristic
errors in grammar and pronunciation; the employment of a double
negative for a simple negation, the omission or superaddition of the
letter H, and saying ‘sor’ for saw. We might take every available
opportunity to give thc men a practical lesson in courtesy to the other
sex, by arranging their shawls and their parcels for instance, and by con:
siderately covering infants too conspicuously nursed with the mantle of
a travelling wrapper or a pocket handkerchief. In a little while, having
sufficiently ingratiated ourselves with our fellow-passengers, we might
take the liberty of playſully deprecating the continual munching of
bread and cheese, ind the frequent recourse to the spirit-flask.
“Arrived at our destination, we might mingle with the people, in
strolling about the streets, where we would try to prevail upon them to
lay aside their ipes, and walk along so as not to occupy all the pave-
ment. It would be well for us also to point out to them any adjacent
objects of interest, with a view to deve º intelligence in the place of
gaping wonder. We might accompany them to the neighbouring park,
Ot . assist them in opening their baskets and untying their bundles,
show them how to arrange the contents of those things in the style of a
pic-nic, and instruct mechanics and artisans in the mystery of attending
to ladies. If necessary, we could even follow them to those unknown
haunts out of which absurd persons issue, and offer you hot, water fºr
the tea which they assume you have got in your pocket! We would
school them in deportment at table; entreat them to laugh gently; and
beg them not to put their knives into their mouths.
“On the sands—by the sad sea waves—we would make it our busi:
ness to conduct them to bathing machines, not only that they might
properly wash themselves, but also their infants, instead of half
dipping them in the salt water, scraping them against the shingle, and
then, to stop their cries and screams, giving them gin, And, here,
where the working man would insist on smoking, we would, teach him
to smoke in a proper manner, with his hands put easily and gracefully
in his pockets and his hat on the right way. Arm in arm with young
journeymen, we would show them how to stroll and saunter and dangle
after the young women, glass in eye. As for those young women, with
their aunts and mothers, we would, if possible, induce our sisters or
cousins to assist our ministrations by attending and instructing them to
carry their crinoline with elegance, so as not to expose its framework
but to exhibit their ankles to advantage, for which purpose it would
further be necessary to teach them to assume correct attitudes. Most
of our female relatives, doubtless, would only be too happy to co-operate

“Your Regular Reader,
“ The Clarendon, June, 1862.” “TREMAINE.”
PROTECTION FOR THE POOR ORGAN-GRINDER.
For the sake of the Italian Organ-grinders themselves, something
ought to be done with a view to prevent the excitement into which the
nerves of irritable persons are now liable to be thrown by the music of
those interesting foreigners. At the Lambeth Police Office, on Monday
last week, a wandering minstrel of this º; class, named FRAN-
cisco Eschio, appeared to complain of a cracked crown, the effect of a
violent assault committed on him by a half-pay officer, CAPTAIN DUNDAs.
According to the report:-
“The Complainant said that on that morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, while
º: his organ, he received, he could not tell how, three or four severe blows ºn
is head with a stick, one of which had cut his hat through, and caused wound
on the top of his head.”
There was evidence enough to P. that this lesion of the scalp
which the poor fellow could not telſ how he had received, was produced
by the cane of the irascible CAPTAIN DUNDAs. MRs. ElizaBETH
HAMLIN—the Captain's next door neighbour—beheld the assault. This
lady said, “she had been in the habit of giving the poor organ-players
a few pence, but since she had discovered that the Captain, her neigh:
bour, did not like it, she had discontinued, doing so.” A kind and
considerate lady; kind, though injudiciously so, to a poor organ-
grinder, and considerate to an irritable Captain. Unfortunately she
repented of her mistaken kindness too late to avail the poor organ-
grinder. For behold:—
That morning while up-stairs she heard an organ playing five or six houses
beyond the prisoner's. In a few minutes she saw CAPTAIN DUNDAs strike the
Complainant on the head several violent blows with what appeared to her to be the
thick end of a hunting-whip. The Complainant would have fallen if some persons
had not come to his assistance.”
How dreadful 1 . How painfull How much the poor organ-grinder
must have been hurt! Two other witnesses attested the foregoing
facts. One of them, a woman of course, said that “seeing the Com-
plainant bleeding profusely from what appeared to be a deep wound, in
the top of his head,” she, like a kind creature, “took him some hot
water to wash away the blood.” What a truly touching act of tender
charity! It is gratifying to know that his head was washed. The
other witness, although likewise a woman, admitted, on cross, exami-
nation, “that she had seen a young lady point towards the Complainant,
and heard him play one or two tunes after that.”. The poor Italian
might, if he had dared, have addressed his assailant in the words of his
countryman Iago, “I bleed. Sir, but not killed.” He does not appear
to have made the remark. fieh ed, however, at any rate, and was seen
}. Police Constable, HENRY MoRTON, 63f, on the same morning, at
ower Street, Station, “with a wound on his head from which the
blood was still flowing.” Suffering victim of irritation! The last-named
witness, who took CAPTAIN DUNDAs into custody, stated that:— `
“The Prisoner was not 'the terror of the organ-grinders alone, but of his neigh-
bours also. He was in the habit of firing off a seven-barrelled revolver, and at other
times conducted himself in so eccentric a manner as to alarm those living in his
neighbourhood.”
. This statement of the policeman makes us tremble to think of the
risk that was run by theſº." organ-grinder in provoking a gentleman
in the habit of firing off a seven-barrelled revolver. The solicitor of
CAPTAIN ISUNDAs pleaded in defence of his client that the Captain was
in “a weak and nervous state.” These are conditions which organ.
grinding is particularly apt to aggravate. CAPTAIN DUNDAS sent a
young lady to request the musician to go away. The poor musician, as
those poor musicians usually do, declined to move. “Annoyed by his
refusal,” the º “in a moment struck him, and, unfortunately,
with much more force than he had intended.” Ulysses served Thersités
in the same way to stop his noise—poor Thersites | But that case is
noJºãº nothing can justify an assault, not even organ-grinding
and refusal to stir on the part of the poor organ-grinder.
CAPTAIN DUNDAs was fined £5 |. MR, ELLIOTT; who very pro-
rly observed that “it was not to be permitted to persons to take the
aw into their own hands, and commit such outrages as cutting people's
heads open with their sticks with impunity,”, so says, the law, which a
Magistrate is bound to administer. But then really the law should
remove the temptation which prompts nervous gentlemen to take it
into their hands, to the injury of poor organ-grinders. It is quite
true that, as MR. E.LLIOTT also said of the sufferer in this case, “the
Prisoner had his remedy in sending for a constable, and having him
removed or given into custody.” Yes, and then SiGNOR FRANcisco
Eschio might have been succeeded by another poor organ-grinder, and
the same remedy again applied, a third poor organ-grinder following,
removed by a re-application of the remedy, and so on all day; a remedy
worse than the disease for a nervous irritable gentleman. Šhould the
organ-grinding at last drive him absolutely mad, the possible result to
the poor organ-grinder might be fearful.
Be it therefore enacted, That a “Caution,” posted at the demand of
any nervous gentleman, shall forbid all organ-grinding within a reason-
able compass, and authorise the police to remove all poor organ-grinders
from the peril to which they now expose themselves. This would
effectually secure those tidy and cleanly children of harmony from in-
curring such sad consequences of violent exasperation as those which
poor FRANÇisco Escuit, brought down upon his head.

We canonised Japanese martyrs,
All of the olden Time.
But when it came to ousting Tycoon and flooring Mikado,
Adding temporal rule to spiritual, we were quietly told to go:
And wº i. refused, we were cruclly used, and strung up by twos
all 1 rees
Hung, |. and quartered, and variously martyred, as witness the
elligles
Of us canonised Japanese martyrs,
All of the olden Time.
So Holy Father take warning, with the Cardinals at your side,
And Bishops, whether in partibus, or faithful flocks that guide.
So long as it stuck to spirituals no risk our mission ran,
'Twas going in for the temporals that floored the Church of Japan,
And settled us J #panese martyrs,
All of the olden Timc.
'Tis a fine thung to be canonised, beatitude’s a pleasure
And a fººl sight is St. Peter's, decked with velvet'and lights and
reasure :
But we’d rather sce stronger foundations and somewhat poorer
dressings
And a good deal less of French bayonets, and more of Italian blessings,
We canonised Japanese martyrs,
All of the olden Time.
“Quod semper, quod uſique, quodal omnibus conſtelur,”
Is the rule, “ ãº Caesaris Cesari, quod Dei Deo detur.”
Then seek not after temporals, or, be sure, our counsel scorning,
You'll find yourself served out, as we did, one fine morning,
We canonised Japanese martyrs,
All of the olden Time.
Extraordinary Benevolence.
MR. BENJAMIN WEBSTER (whose name is synonymous with kindness
and liberality) has contrived to get at odds with the tremendous Dion
Boucicault, and it appears from the Chancery Reports, that MR.
WEBSTER, so far from resenting the ingratitude of his protégé, has
actually taken proceedings to prevent the GROUPER becoming the
Lessee of Drury Lane Theatre!, If that is not returning good for evil,
we should be glad to be privately informed what constitutes that com-
mendable operation

PROTESTANT MONKEY’S TRICKS,
(To CARDINAL WISEMAN.)
My LQRD CARDINAL, - -
You R Eminence is now, I believe, in the Eternal City, but as
CoBBETT said once when he wrote a letter to the Pope, if any gentle-
man happens to be going to Rome, he will perhaps be so good as to
put this letter into his pocket, and deliver it to you with his own hands.
A man signing himself “A Member of the Protestant Church of
England,” writing to the Morning Advertiser, gives an account of
some very shameful buffoonery which is being practised in your district
Hyou know I must not say diocese—and which cannot but disgust you.
He dates from Stoke Newington, and says:–
“We have in this neighbourhood a Church called St. Matthias, the interior of
which is made to resemble as much as possible a Roman Catholic place of worship.
There are an abundance of crosses, even the brass lamps are studded with them,
each burner being in the shape of a cross.”
You see, my Lord, Cardinal, that this is a Protestant Church at
which the officiating clergymen amuse themselves and their congrega-
tion-I should say audience—by playing at Roman Catholics. Here is
the above-quoted writer’s description of the performance:–
“On Easter-Sunday, which we all know is a high day in the Romish Church, so
likewise was it at St. Matthias. I attended the service, and as far as the music was
concerned, I admit it was a theatrical treat, but the mummery practised effaced all
other considerations. The principal portion of the beautiful service of the Church
of England is what they call “intoned," so that a stranger cannot join in it; large
candles were burning on the Communion table, although it was broad daylight; a
§ carried a thurible, containing incense, the smoke from which surrounded the
afficiating priest, precisely in the same manner as is practised in Popish Chapels.
They have at this Church holy water' for the congregation to use, with the sign
of the cross, also Sisters of Mercy, another name for nuns.”
Your Eminence perceives that these mountebanks don't mimic you
cleverly. They intone “the beautiful service of the Church of England.”
Why do they not intone the beautiful canon of the Mass at once, and
take you off, as the rustics say, “something like?” Why, I dare say
ou would rather have your own form of worship represented at Drury
i. or at the Adelphi Theatre, where, by the "º: the Canoni-
sation would be a safe hit, Pio NoNo represented by MR. Toole, and
MR. PAUL BEDroRD playing your Eminence.
Our histrionic parsons at Stoke Newington, however, carry their
burlesque a little too far. In continuation we are informed that:-
“They adopt the debasing practice of confession, which, while it subjugates the
intellect, is repulsive to every manly feeling of our nature.”
Some foolish people, mistaking these clerical mimes for º
Roman Catholic priests, may actually go and confess to them. Now
whatever your auricular confession may be, there can be no doubt that
the Protestant imitation of it is all humbug; a practice not only de-
basing but useless. I would suggest, therefore, the expediency of
taking some step to prevent this, Stoke Newington confessional, from
imposing on the unwary. Couldn't you have a few acolytes, in costume,
to stand outside of St. Matthias's, carrying advertisement-boards, to
apprise all whom the information may concern, that you have no con-
nection with that establishment, and, declaring which is the genuine
shop for absolution? With all possible respect,
Your Eminence's old acquaintance,

Wacancies Wanted.
THE Pope was sorely puzzled to know how to cram his new Japanese
Saints into the Calendar, already most inconveniently crowded with
apocryphal sanctity. He might make a little room by showing out
S. Napoleon, which would be a neat and safe insult to L. NAPOLE9N,
in return for his efforts to shove, out the Pope, , Punch wonders that
the ecclesiastical mind has not thought of so delightful a bit of spite.
It is not too late—though it soon may be.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REMOVAL OF A NUISANCE.
He hideous tents, that
selfishly block up the
view of the Horticul-
tural Gardens from
the windows of the
Exhibition refresh-
ment rooms, were not
used on the occasion
of the last Flower
Show. As they are
of no use then, why
should not they be
removed 2 Those who
rule Arcadia shoul
breathe nothing but
gentleness and good-
nature to others, even
though they may be
only outsiders of the
magic circle of beauty
and aristocracy, and
have not paid their
shillings to enter, the
flowery kingdom.
Flowers should surely
teach everything that
is graceful and sweet,
and we think that the
fellows of a society so
pacifying in its nature
as, *i; º
might display a little
more º fellowship
to their fellow-crea-
tures. The present
erection seems to have been prompted by the Directors after they had partaken of a liberal
repast of early gooseberries and unripe crab-apples, and had been drinking freely of the juice
of vinegar-plants, for its unsightly growth could only have been the produce of the very essence
of acidity. The sour spirit that apparently animated them was this:–
“No, gentlemen exhibitors, you may enjoy your dinners, and pay for them any price you
please; but we are determined you shall not feast your eyes for nothing. Our flowers, we
tell you, are not going to waste their sweetness gratis. You don't see one of their lovely
tints until we first see the colour of your money.”
However, we doubt if this monster bit of canvas has helped the sale of their season-tickets
in any way... We say again, let the nuisance be instantly removed. One's dinner is poisoned
by an overflow of miserable Tent whine, that is being poured out on all sides of you on
account of this huge ocular obstruction. One would as soon think of dining outside one
of ALGAR's Crown and Anchor booths. The only tent one would wish to dine in on such an
occasion, surrounded as one is with so many foreigners, should be en-tente cordiale.
CAROLLINGS FOR COCKNEYS.
AMONG other musical novelties we see announced a piece for the piano which the composer
has entitled “Carollings at Morn.” In this “morceau de salon,” as it is called in the advertise-
ments, one of the advertised “opinions of the press” informs us that “the warblings of the
birds, the huntsman's joyous horn, and the chevying of the hounds are successfully rendered.”
Now, of course such morning sounds as these are familiar enough to people in the country,
but we who live in London only have a limited acquaintance with them, and therefore cannot
take much interest in piano imitations, or say with any certainty if they be like to life. We
think then the composer, if he aim at all at gaining a good London reputation, should write
at once a sequel to his “morsel of the drawing-room,” and introduce the cries and carollings
at morn heard in Cockaigne. We are sure a pretty piece might be composed on such a
theme, and we really feel surprised it has not long ere this been thought of. How charmingly
the street-cries might be introduced, and what delightful variations might be written on
the melodies wherewith the various street merchants proclaim aloud their wares! How
sweetly “Milk below—oh l’” might be tinkled in the treble, while “Fresh Haddick | * or
“Fine So-holes!” might be blared out in the bass. The cheerful cry of “Swee-ee-ee-up !
might then be fitly heard, and an imitation given of the shriek of “Water-creeeeeeses!” or
the howl of “Hearthstones!” . Then the cry of “Any hornaments for your fire-stove?”
ought to follow as a fugue, and the carollings might conclude with a bit of a street song, such
as that infer—well, that inſerior “In the Strand!”. Every ..", is familiar with such
carollings as these, and we feel sure they might be imitated upon the piano, every whit, as
well as those more rural morning sounds which form the subject of the piece that has
suggested these remarks.

A FRIEND of mine, you understand,
Said, speaking to a friend of his,
“I know your Number in the Strand,
But know not whereabouts it is.”
He seemed to name a public need:
Be mine an Index to supply,
By which you all can see, with speed,
How that grand Artery's numbers lie.
The Strand begins with Alnwick's Lord,
Where Percy's Lion rears his tail,
Then on we go º Hungerford, .
Destined as platform for the Rail,
At Fifty comes a kind of notch,
George Court, which cut on memory's peg:
"Twixt Johnson, who will set your watch,
And Surgeon Joses, who'll set your leg.
A Hundred Houses, and behold,
Where Simpson feeds your inward man,
And ivory tickets too are sold
For yonder famed Cigar Divan.
Pass Fifty more, and One-Five One
Shows you a statue, dark as jet,
And here the Nation's work is done,
You see the House of Somerset.
Two doors before Two Hundred, see
The Illustrated London News,
A better #." could not be, .
imbelſished with delightful views.
Two-Thirty-Five completes the side,
My pensive friend, and here you are,
For whether, friend, you walk or ride,
Behold yourself at TEMPLE BAR.
Now turn we west, and back we go,
Only of course we cross the way;
The Strand has here not much to show
Whereof we pleasant things can say.
Two-Sixty-Five’s the street of Wych,
Of which we hope to see the fall;
For architectural fingers itch
To smash that dreary, dirty wall.
Narrows the Strand, 'tis here at worst,
Would that improvement's hand were bold;
And Holywell’s black dens accurst,
Lie close behind the houses old.
Two-Ninety-Eight’s the Spotted Dog,
An ancient haunt, if not genteel,
Where drink is “lush” and food is prºs ”—
What matter, if you get your meal
See the Lyceum's pit invites ...
Where high is writ Three-Fifty-Four,
There Peep o' Day two hundred nights
Hath run—may run as many more.
Now read that Greek, and answer, curt,
What portal's marked Three-Seventy-Two,
Here stands the Hall that would convert
Pagan and Buddhist, Turk and Jew.
Then count until at Four-Eleven
You halt before a favourite spot.
Performances commence at Seven;
See MRs. BoucICAULT as Dot.
Then less than fifty houses more -
Will bring your journey’s end, my child,
Four-Fifty-Seven denotes the store
Where maps are sold by Bodmin’s WYLD.
And if my meat though humble rhymes
Shall save some grains of Life's fast sand,
By aiding reference when the Times
Mentions some number in the Strand:
My object’s gained; my Muse so free
Down from her empyréan drops,
And lisps in numbers, though they be
But numbers on the doors and shops.

BLONDIN IN A BREEZE.
THE subjoined statement was published the
other morning in the principal papers,

s
“Crystal Palace. —Bloxon made his first ascent
over the fountains on Saturday, notwithstanding it was
blowing a hurricane at the time.”
The remark which this information naturally
suggests is, What a wonder it is that Bloxois
was not blown down. The circumstance of a
windy day, must add very much to the excite-
ment which is occasioned by MR. BioNDIN's ter-
rific ascents and performances in the sky. It is
liberal of the Crystal Palace Company to make
no extra charge for admission on hurricane days,
which ADMIRAL FitzRoy's, “forecasts” in the
Times would generally enable them to anticipate
the day before. The crowds who go to see M.
Blondin risk, and º break, his neck,
would be greatly multiplied if the public were
advertised as often as the prospects of the
weather would warrant, that his ascent would
take place at such an hour; a heavy gale ex-
pected. When he is dancing on the tight-rope in
a tempest, his spectators should give the space
under his rope a wide berth, considering that, if
he should chance to be º they would not
only have his blood upon their heads, in a moral
sense, but likewise, in its ponderable substance,
his material body, which would be as bad for
themselves as for Biospis, for the body would
certainly smash the heads notwithstanding their
thickness.

GENTILITY AND GOOD MANNERS.
TheRE is no, Royal Road to learning, and it would seem, that the
Royal road to learning the contents of the International Exhibition
is sometimes almost as bad as no road at all. The other day the
PRINCEsses. HELENA and MAUDE, with their attendants, yisited the
building. The young ladies were, of course, in deep, mourning, and i
ordinary courtesy were not enough to prevent Snobs from, intruding
upon them, the dress might, have suggested that special delicacy, was
due to children who were brought to see the development of the ideas
of a lost father. Hear the Daily News:–
“We regret to be obliged to add, that the Royal party were forced to leave the
building much earlier than they had intended, in consequence of the rude and
shameless way in which they were literally 'mobbed." Some of the “ladies'
rushed forward, and coolly peered under the bonnets of the young Princesses, to the
utter confusion and annoyance of the latter, and in defiance of the expostulations
of the police. The men were quite as bad, and when the police remonstrated, were
insolent and abusive, acting, in fact, as if they had an inward conviction that the
privilege of staring at the Royal Princesses in a manner which, if it had been done
to ladies of lower rank, would most assuredly have procured for the offenders per-
sonal chastisement from their male escorts, was a legitimate portion of the value of
their admission money."
ºt Well, it was very low, of course, but what can you expect from the
rabble? The canaille have no sense of propriety, and if ladies will go
into a mob of mechanics, they must take the consequence.”..
If you please, MRs. FITZBATTLEAXE, just lower that highly orna:
mental and aristocratic nose for one moment, only until you have read
another sentence or two. ----
The day in question was not a Shilling day, but a Half-Crown day
#. word “mobbed” in the above extract is followed in the original
thus, -
“by persons wearing the garb of ladies and gentlemen,"
and the reporter proceeds:—
“To the honour of the working classes, we have to record, on the best authority,
that on the previous (shilling) day, when the building was crowded with mechanics
and their wives, the Royal party 3. through the various courts comparativel
unmolested. A considerable crowd followed them, it is true, for a short period
after the quality of the distinguished visitors became known, but a single wori
from the police-sergeant in attendance was sufficient to induce the people to fall
back in the most deferential manner, and during the passage of the party through
the Courts the Royal ladies were wholly unobstructed.”
Do you see that, MRs. FITzBATTLEAxº. You observe that it was not
the “lower orders” who mobbed the Princesses, but the “genteel.”
people, the folks who are not up to the Five Shilling day mark, but
who could not for the world mix, (as PRINCEsses ALICE AND LOUISA
afterwards did) with the Shilling rabble. It was the Gents and the
Gentesses, Madam, the Snobs who endeavour to imitate you and
the rest of the beloved and revered aristocracy, but try to do it cheaply,
and certainly do it in the way indicated by the other adjective frequently
f|coupled with cheap. Half-bred Brummagem Respectability mobs young
ladies in mourning—the Half-crowners, Madam.
On the days reserved for those who may be supposed to represent
the aristocracy, and on the days given to the People, the children of
PRINCE ALBERT may walk, unmolested, among the treasures which it
was the dearest wish of their father to assemble at Kensington. But
let them beware of the Snobs, those who are not fine enough to go
among the real Swells, and who think themselves too fine to go among
the People. We hope that our foreign visitors, as also the police, wi
keep their eyes upon persons whom they may see vulgary pressing
upon such visitors to the show as the Princesses, or others in whom
ngland has an interest. Both the males and females, of the vulgarian
class that so misconducts itself look very smart, but should the police-
man, as it is to be hoped he may, lay his hand upon the shoulder of a
male Snob, let that policeman be gentle, or he may pull away a paper
collar, and a dickey with brass studs, and as for the she-snobs, let
Punch advise persons with noses and knees to keep away from coarse
º and fº crinolines. A \º will do you no particular
arm, and will make way for you when he has seen the picture before
him, and a Mechanic will thank you for telling him which is the Hogarth,
but the Gent who cares as much for pictures as a pig, will keep in
your way if he thinks you want to move on, and the Gentess, even more
vacuous, will stare at you with all the accumulated hauteur of Totten-
hamcourtrodia if you venture to press past her gentility. , Mr. Punch is
sorry that the visits of the Princesses to their father's best memorial
have furnished him with a text for such a sermon, but the ladies have
learned something by their annoyance, and the public should have the
benefit of the lesson. Beware of the Genteel !

WHO IS TO BE CORONERP
We really almost wonder that some French friend has not put it forth as his conviction
that suicide is greatly on the increase in triste London, basing his opinion on the fact that we
are going to appoint an extra coroner. What was the work of one man is now, deemed enough
for two, and Middlesex is divided into West and Central districts. Further, our French
friend might write home to his newspaper, that by reason of the number of suicides committed,
the post of coroner is as lucrative as that of Milor Mayor, as is proved by the anxiety we
show to get appointed to it. No less than three candidates have offered for each office; and
to show that applicants are not mere needy placehunters, our French friend might point
out that for the É. District two of the three candidates are a lawyer and a doctor.
Now, Mr. Punch being a Briton, of course is a free man; and there comes to him the
question for whom is he to vote? Is the doctor or the lawyer the fitter to be coroner? Both
are doubtless men of substance, and of some weight in the world: by which of the two feel
you any preference to be sate ". It might º be argued that the duty of a coroner
is to ascertain the causes of a death; and though the law's delay may send men ..".
to the grave, the healing art is ſº viewed as the more deadly. Somehow, doctors have
the reputation—quite improperly of course—of having sometimes helped to shorten a patient's
life, and so it seems but right that a doctor here and there should officiate as coroner, since no
men are more likely to know the cause of death than doctors. So Mr. Punch, as a free man,
#. his vote to DR. LANKESTER, who is a man of weight, and at the same time records
is hope that it will never be the duty of the doctor to have to sit on him. Having thus
voted, Mr. Punch may very safely prophesy that the doctor will come in, and so he will
conclude by classically saying, Finis Coroner-at Opus.
SHOCKING NEWS FROM IRELAND,
ON Wednesday last week we received a tremendous shock from the electrictelegraph connect-
ing London with Dublin, in the shape of the subjoined announcement, which caught our eye:—
“A true bill has been found against PUNCH for sending a threatening letter.”
The spasm, into which we were thrown by this most inconsiderately abrupt intimation, our
legs being under table at the time, jerked them up with such violence that they kicked it over
altogether, independently of our volition, flinging all our papers about our study and spilling
our ink. As soon, however, as our convulsion had subsided, we tried back in the Irish news,
and there discovered that the MR. PUNCH of the startling telegram above quoted was a
certain John PUNCH charged with sending a threatening letter to §. HAMILTON LANGLEY,
a road contractor. . Our composure returned. But why had it, been interrupted? Were
we not quite secure in the certainty that Punch had not been sending anybody a threatening
letter? Yes; but the telegram, relative to PUNCH as arraigned of that offence came from
Dublin, and who was to know what might not have been done by an Irish grand jury?
People in sending, telegrams which may seriously affect other people, should mind how they
mention other people's names. Our own will be vilified very much as it is, in being wilfully
confounded with that of this Hibernian PUNCH,
whom justice, has overtaken. The question
everywhere will be, Have you heard about Punch?
and the reply will be, What? and the wag's
answer to that of course will be, “He has got

ephemeral topics, but upon

sacrifice fractions of each in
order to, promote a, little
inquiry, the result whereoſ
may be beneficial in the time
to come. -
There has been more dis;
cussion about the eating an
drinking at the Kensington
Show than about any article
there exhibited. A stranger
who should read the news-
papers, would think that we
had been erecting a great
tavern, that naturally our
first thought was for the
kitchen and the cellar, but
that in order to attract, cus-
tomers, we had, stuck in
some interesting objects, and
hung some pictures on the
walls. However, this is the
Englishman's way, he cares
for little in the way of amuse-
ment unless he can somehow
connect it with eating and
drinking, and it is too late in
the day to find fault, with that part of his asthetics. He, moreover,
likes good eating and drinking, and does not grudge his money for the
same, though he grumbles when cheated too coarsely.
It was of the utmost consequence to the persons who took the Re-
freshment Contracts at the Kensington Show that BULL, to say nothing
of O'PADDY, MSANDY, and LEEks, should believe that the eatables
and drinkables there sold were of an excellent description, and sold at a
reasonable price. Whether they are or are not, Mr. Punch has not the
faintest idea, as he never takes anything between breakfast and dinner,
and dines in Grosvenor Square at 8 p.m. Some people tell him that
the things are “not bad,” some say the wines are anything but what
they ought to be, some affirm that the waiters are civil and honest, while
others allege that they are careless and cheats, and he should be inclined
to think—were the matter worth his serene attention—that the, whole
business is a little of the Scramble kind, and that you may do tolerably
well, if you have tolerance and good luck. -
But it was not in human nature that the Contractors should desire that
the stern, HALLAM-like judgment, into which Mr. Punch hath, just
condensed his convictions should go forth to the million. It was highly
desirable, and in the interest of business, that BULL, O'PADDY
M'SANDY, and LEEks should be tempted to the Refreshments, and
should be incited to bring their wives and children. And inasmuch as no-
body believes newspaper advertisements, while everybody believes news-
paper paragraphs, it was held desirable that the gentlemen who are
supposed to write newspaper paragraphs should have the most favourable
opportunity of comprehending the merits of the Refreshment Depart-
ment. Mr. Punch is .# . has never seen the arrangement in
uestion–that a “Press Table” has been instituted, and that whatever
the public may get, at that Table at all events the cookery is admirable,
and the wines are—or are in the judgment of the partakers thereof—
unexceptionable. -
Well, a good many gentlemen who write paragraphs spoke of things
as they found them (which the song recommends us all to do), and, did
not speak of what they did not know (as becomes wise men), and there
have appeared a great number of paragraphs in which praises of the
Refreshments have been enthusiastically emitted, and Bull, O'PADDY,
M‘SANDY, and LEEKs have been assured that the arrangements are
first-rate.
Had this been all, Mr. Punch might have had nothing to say.
lº." been an illustration of Humbug, but not of humbugworth
S Lazoº.
But it hath been alleged that sundry gentlemen who write paragraphs
do not only eat and drink at the “Press Table,” but do, accept their
meals and pay nothing. That, in fact they are “treated” by the pro-
prietory, and fare sumptuously, the inference being, that in return for
such hospitality, flattering and valuable paragraphs are composed.
The charge was felt to be one of Bribery, and a sensation, was
created, and strong words were written down, and much good indigna-
tion was expressed, in many cases, no doubt, honestly. But the charge
remained general, until it seemed good unto the Morning Star to desig-
nate one individual as the offender. Him did the Star biographise,
giving a noways laudatory history of him, and accusing him of being an

Irishman, and of other offences. After a time, somebody who believes
himself to be the person described, though not named, comes forth with
a terrifically long letter, in which he takes his own view of his history.
t is not a savoury one, but Mr. Punch is no analyser of such narratives.
The only important part of this person's statement is that which follows
his avowal of his own acceptance of gratis food, which he says he has
eaten,” five times on the French side, often on the English side, but
not wholly as a member of the Press Proper” (whatever the evasive
jargon means)– -
“I have frequently—very frequently—dined at the English side; twice with
small parties who were not paid tor, but for whom a previous consent had been
obtained ; other times with other parties, who, to my knowledge, were paid for at
the regulated tariff, I alone exercising the privilege which had been accorded me;
not wholly as a member of the press proper, but on other and distinct grounds to
Let it be understood that the privilege was
given me in common with many other members of the press—that I have done less
in exercise of this privilege than many of high position whom I could name. . . . .
These are facts known to all concerned. I ask, therefore, why am I singled out for
attack? Is the metropolitan press so unjust that to save itself from reproach—if
reproach be due—it seeks to make a scapegoat of a provincial editor, and save its
own character at the expense of that of a stranger? I do not wish to be personal.
- - . Else I might name names in connection with this matter that would
make people stare at the virtuous indignation so suddenly evoked. Since March or
February the system of press dinners at the Exhibition been in practice—why
is the immorality of the system only discovered in June, and then only in connec-
tion with one who has scarcely the privilege in right of the *::: Why, if
there be immorality in the system, did so many partake of the grand banquet given
a month ago?”
.There ! The man signs his name to what he writes—we have no am-
bition to add to his fame, so we do not append the distinguished syl-
lables—but there is his statement, made, as regards himself, with
evident and almost ludicrous unconsciousness that he is owning to dirty
and dishonest conduct. But he, makes a calm and deliberate charge
against others, and it is for the honour of Journalism that this person
should be shown to be what Mr. Punch desires to believe him in regard
to this matter-namely, one who knowingly makes unfounded state-
ments. There is a shorter way of putting it, which Mr. Punch will
employ when the refutation is made.
MOTHER POPE'S ALLOCUTION.
ON Washing Day last old MRs. Pope the Fishwoman, calling herself
successor to the Fisherman, delivered a talking-to, or Allocution, from
her stall to a couple of Monarchs who have incurred her displeasure.
It will perhaps be considered that Objurgation rather than Ailocution
is the title properly applicable to this discourse; which ran as follows:
-“Sacrilegious Sovereigns. The malice which inspired a NERO, a
DiocleTIAN, and a JULIAN the Apostate does not cease to inflame
the persecutors of the Chair of PETER, and especially you two. Our
heart is full of bitterness, and so is our liver, all owing to your never-
before-heard-of atrocity, Eructavit cor meum, et fervens difficili bile
tumeſ ſecur. So, then, what can you expect at our mouth P Wae vobis,
Analedicti / ... Contemmers of all law, human and divine, enemies of
heaven, spoilers and violators of the Holy Stall—We’ve no patience with
you. Aah..scelerati latrones / You impious wretches, you vile sinners,
you wicked good-for-nothing, Princes. Where do you expect to go to,
when you question our temporal supremacy regardless of the immortality
of the soul? . Reviving monstrous portents of exploded errors; exe:
crable, ſº detestable, diabolical heresies, you trample all
right and justice under your feet. There isn't a pin to choose between
you..., Arcades ambo; non est in vobis sanitas.
“As for you, Louis, we don't thank you a bit for your pretence of
protecting us... You’d betray us this moment, you Judas, if it wasn’t
that you daren't defy our faithful priests and bishops, for you know it's
as much as your crown's worth. Mind what your Missus tells you
and give us back what you’ve allowed that fellow to prig. You call
yourself the eldest son of the Church! Look at you brother there; you
are, both children of old HARRY. Abandoned reprobates. Go along
with you! /adite retro, Satanas et Beelzebub. Get out ! Apagete a
dorso neo. Bad luck to you!—unless you repent and make restitution,
you unprincipled, usurpers, you heretics, you schismatics, you con-
founded abominable hypocrites. Anathema maranatha. Fiat, fiat,
fiat. Amen /*
It is whispered that if MRs. Pope is obliged to remove her stall from
the Eternal City, she will transfer it to Billingsgate.
“Bar Bar, Black Sheep."
That eminent transatlantic lawyer, MR. Epwin JAMEs, complains
that in England he was under the cold shade of aristocracy. Con
sidering “the strictly private transaction,” as he calls it, by which he
transferred a trifle of £30,000 or thereabouts from the pockets of one of
that aristocracy to his own, we have no difficulty in admitting that there
was .a. coolness” as well as a “shadiness” about his dealings with
the British aristocracy: “The strictly private transaction” was pre-
cisely one of those “plants” which flourish best in the shade.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 16th. Monday. Recent Italian movements, , with which the
name of GARIBALDI has been undesirably connected, have given great
trouble not only to M. RATAzzi, but to the MARQUIs or NoHMANBY.
The former has had to make, in the Italian Parliament, a curious defence
of his own conduct, and the verdict seems to be, that M. RATAZZI is an
exceedingly clever man. A similar verdict is not likely to result in the
case of LoRD NORMANBy, but LoRD Russell admitted that N. had,
for once, some #. for asking questions about matters that did not
concern him. LORD BROUGHAM took the opportunity of informing the
world that he respected GARIBALDI as a soldier, though not as a states-
man, but that he had not the least respect for MAzzINI; for that as a
statesman he was a mere conspirator, and as a soldier he never ventured
to expose his person to danger. Mr. Punch has not yet heard whether
MAzzINI has felt it his duty, in consequence of this intimation, to leap
into Wesuvius. -
The DUKE QF NEWCASTLE, said and regretted that the Canadian
Parliament had rejected a Militia Bill, and destroyed a Ministry, but
the new Premier, GENERAL MACDONALD, might possibly try another
Militia Bill. These are no times for our friends the Canadians to shrink
from defending themselves—what is that we hear about the Yankees
and the widening certain canals, so as to get gun-boats upon certain
waters? That sort of Canadian Boat Song will be unpleasant to the
lovers of true harmony. - -
MR. D.AwsoN wanted SIR GEORGE GREY to promise to interfere with
the Omnibus people, who are just now charging exactly what they like.
SIR GEORGE refused. MR. DARBY GRIFFITH, addressing himself to a
matter on which there is no objection to his speaking, urged that the
omnibus fares ought to be painted outside, so that people might know
what they were binding themselves to pay. SIR GEORGE said that the
law directed the list to be affixed inside. Doubtless he has the sub-
limest contempt for such grievances as those º forward by
MESSRs. DAWSQN and GRIFFITH, but if SIR GEORGE will condescend to
go down to the Kensington Show, a little before VII, and observe the
scene in the road, he will perceive that a good many of the folks who
Pººl. salary have a strong interest in the subject. -
hen did SIR Hugh CAIRNs go in for mischief to the Conveyancing
Reform Bill, and under the pretext that he wanted to make it better
tried to send it to a select Committee. Which pretext being ex sed
by SIR RouxDELI PALMER and others, the House defeated SIR HUGH
by 180 to 124, and, going into Committee, upheld various clauses which
were successively assailed. - - -
Government are “considering” what is to be done about the British
Museum and the Beasts. When the Show is cleared out of the Inter-
national, why cannot the animals be put there? The longest whale
will have room to stretch himself between platform and platform, and
the tallest giraffe can stand up under the Domes.
Tuesday. LoRD GRANVILLE announced, with much feeling, to the
House of Lords, that the earthly tasks of the Son of GEORGE CANNING
were done. LoRD CANNING had expired, at the age of 50... On the
following Saturday, he was laid with his father in the Abbey. “A great
and just man,” said LORD GRANVILLE, and none will gainsay the words.
In the Commons there was little in which the most resolute legis-
lator could find interest., Scotch lunatics and salmon, and an attack
upon certain features in the Income-Tax by MR. HuBBARD, who tacked
his plaint to a Fortifications question, and got himself blown away by
the great financial gun GLADSTONE, helped on the evening till half-past
eight, when there was a Count. MR. A. SMITH and the patriot Digby
Sey MoUR, parties very likely to encounter Counts Out, tried to dis-
courage them by having the name of the mover taken down, but the
wise men asked this in a No-House, and were moderately derided for
the Senatorial bull.
Hednesday. The Bill for preventing the aristocracy from doing the
publicans out of the price of Gin, obtained on tick, went into Committee,
and MR. ForsTER wanted the same rule extended to beer. He says
that the Clowns who drink Beer imitate the Swells, and have no end of
that brown mess chalked up to them, knowing that the vendor cannot
recover. But the subject was considered too important to be taken up
thus lightly. MR. MARTIN carried an amendment, of which Countesses
and others will do, well to take notice—the operation of the Bill is
limited to spirits sold in quantities of not less than a Quart—so our
Butler, may be sent round to the public for a pint of Ancient Thomas,
and if he can only get hold of it, we cannot be made to pay, dear Brother
and Sister Patricians. ...Well done, MARTIN!
.The Clergy Relief Bill went through Committee, and it is a mild
kind of measure, intended to help those clergymen, who do not like
.pºsion, or would prefer another. It will hardly pass the House
Ol lords.
When MR. BERKELEY snapped his Ballot victory, a little Bill that
crawled at the heels of his one, for taking secret votes at Municipal
Elections, slipped in also. To-day it came on when there was something
like a House, and of course was promptly ejected (by 83 to 45) asimilar
destiny being in store for MR. BERKEley's own tº: )
Thursday. EARL Russell upon Mexico. He had declined to ratify
* separate, convention made with the Mexicans, because, though it was
fair enough, it connected itself with a mortgage on Mexico held by
Jncle, Sam. Further, we had nothing to do with the defeat which the
French, have sustained out there—we had withdrawn nosoldiers, because
we had never, sent any, and our marines were withdrawn before the
French decided on separate action. Apropos whereof it may be men.
tioned that our friend I.N. is going to work in earnest, and dispatches
a reinforcement of 10,000 men. This will convince Uncle Sam that the
wise and noble ruler of France is perfectly right in his conduct, and now
that he has separated himself from the selfish and cowardly Britishers,
Americans can watch his course with undiminished admiration. Touch.
ing which Uncle, EARL Russell said that we were certainly not
#ºing to give ºp the Buily St. Pierre. The Lords read the Highways
Bill a Second Time and went their own ways.
Government are “considering” whether that gallant officer, CAPTAIN
SHERARD Osboltsk, and some comrades, shall be allowed to accept the
inyitation of the Chinese authorities to go out and demolish the saw
rebels who are devastating the flowery land. Some order ought º:
taken with, these ruffians, whose atrocities are much too frightful to
be touched upon here, and a plentiful exhibition of the pill called
grape-shot, would be highly beneficial, as Doctor. Osborºse will
prºbably think. .
Therº came a joke out of the discussion in Committee of the Mer.
chant Shipping Bill. . MILNER GIBSON, in the course of an
argument, invited the attention of the Members to the Robert Lowe—
which he said was a Screw. The Committee, of course, broke out into
cathinnation-increased when MR. Gibson added, “But what is the
Yalue of, the lºobert Lowe ?” MR. DisRAELI looked as if he should
like to be called in as. appraiser. After that came a debate on
the Very important question of Cotton supply, and it was very frankly
explained tº the Indian Minister that he did not do his duty in regard
to the prºviding roads, canals, and other facilities for the conveyance of
that article. SinºHARLEs Wood was decidedly of opinion that he
did. And Lond PALMeRSTON, in alluding to the treaty with America
for putting, down the Slave Trade, declared that MR.LINcoLN's govern-
ment had behaved to us in the most handsome manner. It is to be
wished that this statement could be suppressed, as it may bring on a
shower of abuse from the New York press, inasmuch as to compliment
a person on a particular occasion implies, in ill-conditioned people's
º all ºulon that there are other occasions when compliment
1S undeserved.
Friday. QUEEN VICTORIA, having ascended the throne on the 20th
Wune, 1837, it was 9byious that the Lords could not properly attend to
business on the 20th June, 1862.
The Commons did not see the validity of this excuse for a holiday,
and sat, off and on, from twelve at noon till one in the morning.
Whether it was this long spell of work, or the detestable weather of the
month facetiously called June, that made them fractious, Mr. Punch
knows not, but there were two downright rows, such as in the old days
Would have led the parties to Wormwood Scrubs a few hours later.
There is a Greek newspaper published in London, and called the British
Star, and this belongs to an enthusiastic MR. XENos. It has merits,
but the Turkish authorities do not exactly appreciate its chief merit,
which, at least in the eyes of Russians and the Manchester School, is
its incessantly suggesting to the Christian subjects of the Porte that
the gºvernment of the latter is excessively bad, and a nuisance to be
abated. So the SULTAN's Ministers beg that England will not circulate
the paper in Turkey by means of our Post-Office in Constantinople.
This is a request we cannot refuse, and so the journal is refused transit
in our bags. The Russo-Manchester folks of course make this a
grievance, and MR. MAGUIRE and MR. BRight acted to-night as
mouth-pieces of the Greeks. MR, LAYARD made a defence which, if it
had a fault, was too ..". and indeed went into counter-attack, for
MR. MAGUIRE having abused the Turkish Government, MR. LAYARD
suggested that the Government of Rome was just as bad. -
BRIGHT complained that the Ministers were too fond of assailing
the Papists. In the course of MR. LAYARD's speech, he called MR.
MAGUIRE a man,” and though he changed this highly offensive
epithet, and said that MR. MAGUIRE was only “a quarter,” there was
quite an uproar, and DR. BIRGH had to whip both the boys. Then, in
some Irish squabble or other, M.R. M'MAhon abused the 3. men of
the north, as “rowdies,” and CAPTAIN ARCHDALE gave him the lie, in
the most distinct way, about four times, finally offering the same present
in parliamentary º MR. Roebuck very properly wished that
Ministers would take a leaf out of his book and try to be conciliatory
and courteous. On the whole, therefore, it might have been as well
had the Commons imitated the 'Lords, and had an Accession holiday,
instead of an accession of bile.

In the Times’ account of the last show of the Horticul-

“Great quriosity was evinced to see the rare flowers of the hand
tree, which was shown yesterday in the conservatory in full bloom,
the first time that it has ever flowered in this º in spite of
all the care and skill that have been brought to bear to force it into
blossom. The flowers very closely resemble the shape of the human
hand, and from this the shrub takes its name."

THE MUSIC of THE FUTURE.-Promissory notes.
LORD CANNING.
DIED TUESDAY, JUNE 17th, 1862.
ONE more strong swimmer gone down in the deep,
But not in mist of storm and breakers' roar:
He had fought through the surf and gained the shore,
His native England's windy whitewalled steep,
Which he had toiled, and borne so much, to reach.
Ah, little did we think, who cheered him in,
How busy Death, was mining all within
The while we gave him welcome from the beach.
He waived acclaim and greetings of the crowd,
And only prayed he might be left at peace,
In º 's eclipse and toil's well-earned surcease—
Toil that ſº stemmed disease, and grief o'ercowed.
We who had seen him striving with the storm,
In that dread time when England's Empire reºlºd,
Till her foes shouted: “Lo, her doom is sealed!’
And, as foul things round a sick lion swarm,
Base creatures on sore-stricken England pressed,
We who then watched him, patient, calm, and strong,
Not paying hate with hate, and wrong with wrong,
But fear and fury both serene to breast,
We deemed him steeled of body as of soul
And when Death took his partner from his side,
And left him lone, his weary lot to abide,
We said the same high heart could grief control,
That had controlled despair, and doubt, and fear;
And when we knew that his return was º:
We º him labours new and honours high,
Blind that we were, nor dreamed the end was near.
Of all the gifts that England could bestow
He has received but one—an honoured grave;
Where knightly banners in the Abbey wave
O'er dust of English worthies, heaped below,
Another worthy sleeps; the black plumes waved
Above him, cold and coffined, through the street
Where oft, we hoped, he would in council meet
For India's weal, the land that he had saved.
Not for such council, nor speech of his peers,
Comes he to Westminster, but for his grave,
Where write, “He died for duty—modest, brave,
Mild, when the good felt wrath, calm, when the brave had fears.”
A Prophet Right.
A Recent American mail stated as follows:–
“The New York Times' Correspondent thinks there is a probability of the Federal
army going into trenches before Richmond."
The latest accounts show that the prophet was very right, at least to
the extent of 2,000 or 3,000 Federals,
Monuments of Delay.
THE Temple of Diana at Ephesus, we are informed by a classical
scholar, took not less than 220 years in building. This is certainly a
long period for the completion of a monument, but we think we know
of one that, if you only give it time and fair play, will certainly beat it
by half a century at least, and that is the NELsóN Column,
THE Tories' excuse for not turning out PAM is that the .."; is
not ripe yet for a Conservative government. “Humbug! Dizzy. You
mean it isn't green enough.”
