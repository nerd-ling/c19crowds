or sleep either, with the winds in the state of ululant distraction which they manifest in this present drear-
nighted December.
What made the divine PUNCH dream of MINERVA he does not know, unless it was that he had been enjoying a
particularly good dinner at the Athenaeum, and that he dropped into slumber, fancying that he was an Owl of the most
elegant character, and feeling rather inclined to hiss at most people, and bite the others.
Anyhow, there he was, up on Olympus with his old friend JUPITER, whom he was cheering with assurances
of support, in the event of the Bishop of NATAL trying to write him down.
MINERVA, who had put on her very best spoon helmet to fascinate PUNCH (the Goddesses are as artful as
the Women), was praying and beseeching him to accept the Crown of Greece. ,
The goddess was talking her choicest Greek to him, and the polysyllables melted from her lips like bonbons
with liqueur in them. He seemed to understand her as perfectly as DR. PARR could have done, and his conversation,
though Socratic in its wisdom, had that slight Alcibiadic flavour which is not unacceptable even to goddesses of middle
age. JuPITER kept laughing, and though MR. BENJAMIN D'Ixion-IN HEAVEN, M.P., says that nectar is out of
fashion up there, the great Pelasgic Dodonean was certainly drinking it as if he liked it. MR. PUNCH has seen,
on this earth, very great Swells, whose dining-out talk is of Tokay, glue their lips to the modest pewter when at
home, and Jov E was at home. Perhaps he had taken an economical turn, in order to annoy his venerable ox-eyed
wife—let us be charitable at Christmas.
But his accomplished daughter BLUE-EYEs kept on pleading and pestering, with all the audacity of a young
English lady at a fancy-fair.
“Do take the Crown, my dear MR. PUNCH,” she said. “I will have the Parthenon put in thorough repair

“Madam?” said MR. PUNCH, as sternly as he can speak to a female.
“Had too hard a day's work for the good of mankind,” said MINERVA, mending her bid with a blush worthy
of her relative AURORA. “Do-o–o,” pleaded the goddess, pursing her handsome lips into a wheedling entreaty.
“Hoo—hoo—hoo,” said the Owl, to the best of his power imitating his mistress.
“I can't, my dear, and there's an end of it,” said MR. PUNCH, smiling, and giving the Owl a kindly little
kick. “Your father knows I've got enough to attend to without going in for King.”
“It is the neatest thing out in kingdoms,” urged Miss MINERVA, who has been growing rather fast since the
Universities took to examining out-siders. “Who could desire a nicer little domain P”
“Hoo—hoo—hoo?” asked the Owl.
“You might oblige the girl,” said JUPITER.
“You might mind your own business,” said M.R. Punch. “I have many reasons against it. I'll tell you one.
Consider JUDY. The wife of a Chief Magistrate ought to be something to look at, or she hinders him. I see WILLIAM
lłussell's delightful American Diary on that cloud, well, you know what he says about the advantage which VARINA
DAVIS has over MRs. LIN colN, and the consequent gain to the Southern President. Now, JUDY, though the best of
wives, is really 12
“I am sure you ought to be ashamed of yourself, talking so,” said Miss MINERVA. “She is a very striking
looking person, and wears a great deal better than you do.”
“I’ll tell her what you say,” said MR. Punch, “but I won't be King of Greece.”
MINERVA burst into tears, and wiped her blue eyes with her alabaster hand. “Hoo-hoo-hoo,” went the
Owl, and wiped his brown eyes with his ridiculous claw.
“Phlegethonically selfish and unkind of you,” growled Jupiter.
“If you use that kind of language, I shall not stay in Olympus,” said M.R. PUNCH, “I am not used to it,
I can tell you. MINERVA-PALLAs-ATHENA-CEcRoPIA my dear, don't cry, but listen.”
MINERVA wiped her eyes again, and the Owl drew his wing over his beak.
“I can't be King over your Greeks, but I can and will be their guide, philosopher, and friend. Take this
volume” (and a green and golden tome suddenly appeared—as such things will in dreams—in MR. PUNCH's hand)
“Let the Grecians,” he said, “study that, and they will have slight need of Kings or any such luxuries.”
The goddess smiled radiantly.
“Hoo!—hoo!—hoo!” exclaimed the smiling Owl.
The next moment MR. PUNCH awoke in the bosom of his four-post bedstead.
“Well,” he said, sitting up defiantly, “and who could do better for her than give her my

PUNCH'S ESSENCE
MON DAY, June 23rd. The LoRD CHANCELLOR, mirabile dictu, missed
** a good point. He had an opportunity of reading the Lords a lecture
illustrated pictorially. . He had to introduce a Bill for doing away with
the Queen's Prison. Just over his head was CoPE's fresco of PRINCE
HENRY misconducting himself before JUDGE GAscoigne, who committed
his Royal Highness to the prison now to be abolished. LoRD WEST-
BURy might have, done a good bit of demonstrative oratory, and been
the first to ap to the decorations on their Lordship's walls, in the
way that in the old days, Senators used to make appeals to the ex-
tremel º which was luckily burnt up, insects and all, some
years back... Now somebody else will get the first innings at that kind
of thing, Perhaps when SIR MoRTON PETo is made a lord, he will
}. to the Christening of the adult St. ETHELBERT with pardonable
aptist admiration, or, LoRD CHELMSFORD, pleading for the unlucky
Bankruptcy Clerks, will respectfully call the Lords attention to MAC.
Lise's Spirit, of Justice. However, the Bill was introduced, the few
É. in the Q. P., will be taken to White Cross Street, and it is
oped that the ground, which is worth £200,000 and more, will be taken
as the site of St. Thomas's Hospital. This will be a good compro
between the views of those who think it should be in Seven Dials or
some such den, and those who want to set it down in Salisbury Plain,
so that a patient with a broken limb may have a pleasant railway ride
into fresh air on his way to the operating table.
MR. Scully began the week ...; MR. PAGE's beautiful
new Westminster bridge is scarcely open, when Scully wants palisades
stuck "Wºº it, to prevent people from voluntarily jumping into the
river. e really demur to spoiling the bridge, in order to give such
people the trouble of going round the corner, but we cannot complain
of MR. Scully for standing up to represent the lunatic interest.
The House then went at the important question of the week, and SIR
GeoRGE Lºwis demanded leave to raise One Million Two Hundred
Thousand Pounds by annuities, for Fortifications of Arsenals. There
was, of course, a º and the questions, whether we want such
things, and whether they are of any use, and whether forts can demolish
ships as easily as ships can demolish forts, and whether our experiments
on ordnance are satisfactory, and all the rest of the arguments with
which we have been deluged since the Merrimac ran at the Monitor,
were ventilated, as the slang goes, for several hours. . PRINCE
NAPOLEON came into the House during the debate, and MR. DiskAELI

went and talked to him, while LoRD PALMERSTON, more delicately,
remained in his place (long may he remain there), and, paid high com-
pliments to France, and quoted Latin, for the greater delectation of the
owner of the Pompeian villa. MR. DISRAELI was not going to be
trumped, so he came back and made a speech reminding the Committee
that #. PALMERSION had said two years ago that we ought to arm
against France. Doubtless the Prince was edified, and the end was
that in spite of MR. Osborne, who let off a long and cleyer attack
upon the Fortification scheme, and defined “Efficiency” as “increased
expenditure,” the Government carried the resolution, giving the money.
Tuesday. The Scotch Public-houses Bill went º another stage
in the Lords, and LoRD MINTo wished it recommitted. He protested
against the repressive system, and contended that the FoRBEs
MacKENziE Act had not done the good with which it was credited.
He said—
“An improvement had no doubt been effected in the drinking habits of the
higher and middle orders of Scotland; but these classes were those who were least
influenced by any º of this sort, and if any intemperance still lingered
among them, it could not be dealt with by any measures like the present. There
was, however, on the other hand, a considerable degree of drunkenness among the
poorer classes."

e EARL or DERby complained that the country police did not, aid
in the suppression of Night Poaching. He did not want the constables
to be gamekeepers, but urged that where gangs of twenty men (not out
of employment, but colliers and others, .# fº. wages) went
about at night armed, stole game, beat and stabbed, keepers, robbed
farmhouses, and committed other excesses, the police ou it to be
ordered to deal with them. EARL BERNERs introduced a Bill with a
view to meeting such cases. DR. WILBERFORCE brought in a Bill ſor

2 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 5, 1862.
Scotland had a second innings in the Commons. The Scotch Police
Bill, which must be a kind of Code Caledonian, for it contains about
500 clauses, went through Committee. Such legislation is very sensibly
discussed at private meetings with Scotch Members, where men do not
go for the purpose of making speeches but of doing business. , What
the Code Caledonian may intend to do, those who are interested know
best, but if SIR Michaël, STEwART's allegation be correct, that “it
will tie the proprietors of land and the occupiers of houses hand, and
foot,” we scarcely see how, in that painful attitude the Scºtch will be
able to extend to their Southron friends the usual hospitalities of the
autumn. But we have all heard of a chieftain to the Highlands bound
and as his being so fastened is not recorded to have much interfere
with his comforts, we will hope that our other Scotch friends may be
equally fortunate. -
MR. SoTHERON Estcourt then tried to settle the Church Rate ques-
tion—and didn't. - - -
SIR John TRELAwNY moved for leave to bring in a Bill to allow
certain persons, to make Affirmations instead of Oaths. SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER thought such a measure would remove a very powerful means
of getting at the truth. MR. RoKBUCK thought that a person's
declaring i. disbelief in a future state was a better guarantee for his
honesty than the readiness of a hypocrite to take any oath proposed to
him. There are two sides to ihe question, of course. There are
numerous persons who suffer much injustice, and of whose evidence
others are unjustly deprived, because the former are known to be, un-
satisfied that there are future rewards and punishments. But there
are thousands who will, and daily do, tell the most, uncompromising
lies, but who are afraid to lie, much, when the oath, has been adminis.
tered. , Still, and although exceptional legislation is impolitic, means
might be devised for relieving the really conscientious, without destroy.
ing the hold which the present system gives upon a great mass of dis-
honest but impressionable persons. Leave was granted, by 88 to 59, to
bring in the Bill.
HER MAJESTY wishes to sell her Bake House in Peascod Street,
Windsor. Is this the house, where the bakers' wives lived to whom
Falstaff sold the shirts which Mrs. Quickly had bought him? And
did the street take its name from the husband of Mistress Squash, to
whom Mr. Bottom sent his compliments by little Peashlossom ? If so
MR. Colliek had better look after the purchase. MR. CowPER will
give him every information.
Wednesday. A day of disagreeable business, the record of which Mr.
Punch intends to tie up exceedingly tight. SIR GEORGE Bowy ER
moved the Second Reading of a Bill for º: the Government of the
Inns of Court. Our Government saw no case for the Bill, and opposed
it. Now it is notorious that the Middle Temple Benchers have had to
investigate certain charges made against MR. DIGBY SEYMoUR, the
ultra-liberal Member for Southampton, and that the judgment was un-
favourable to that patriot. To-day, he deemed it fit to bring his case
before the House, to defend himself, and to assail the tribunal of the
Temple. ..MR. BoyſLL, as a Bencher, replied, defended the Benchers,
and assailed the Member for Southampton. SIR GEORGE GREY, ex-
pressed what will probably be the opinion of most persons, that as there
is an appeal to a higher Court than that of the Temple, it is desirable
that the judgment of such Court should be obtained by MR. DIGBY
SEYMoUR. SIR GEORGE Bowy ER withdrew his Bill.
Thursday, MAZZIN) has not thrown himself into Vesuvius in conse:
quence of Lond BROUGHAM's ºil. of non-esteem for him, and
to-night his Lordship said that he had been informed that MAzzINI did
incur danger when conspiring. But LoRD BROUGHAM, thought him
wrong in º; Europe and provoking Austria, without securing
the co-operation of France. , So that the real complaint is, not that
MAZZINI conspires, but that he does not do so on a sufficiently large
scale... Well, let us hope that if he has any present designs on Rome,
he will secure the co-operation of NAPOLEoN THE THIRD, Emperor of
the French, and elected of the Millions,
A Fortifications debate in the Lords brought out some good speakers,
and among other orators our friend GEORGE jº. very
sensibly in favour of defences, and afterwards wrote a very proper letter
to the Times correcting a couple of errors in the report of his address.
He proposes to mass men at Reigate in case of an invasion, and in
addition to the excellent strategical reasons for this, we approve of the
course on account of the extremely good beer which may ; obtained in
that impetuous town.
The Commons worked away at the Conveyancing Reform Bill, and
also at the Petroleum Bill, which proposes to deal with a somewhat
similar nuisance, for while the attorney eats up your house, the
petroleum burns it down.
Friday. A fuss was made in the Lords about the getting some female
or other to sign a petition which she did not understand, and supposed
to ask the reverse of its real prayer. More inquiry was ordered, but if
this sort of puritanism is to be carried out, petitioning may as well be
put down by law. How many people who sign petitions could, five
minutes afterwards, write down in a sensible fashion, the substance of
their appeal to the Parliament to make or alter laws? However, in
this particular case the interests of private property were involved,
which of course makes a difference. Imperial legislation may take its
chance, but a railway cutting is a serious matter.
Another proof of Administrative honesty was afforded. The brave
fellows who took Kertell have hitherto been kept out of their prize
money, and although all the leading Lords, including LoRDs HARD-
wicke, the DUKE of SoMERset, LoRD CHELMsford, LoRD GREY, and
LoRD DERBY, unhesitatingly declared the claim to be a fair one, the
Government gave a sort of “wish you may get it” answer, and it was
more than hinted, that Government resisted this just demand, inas-
much as the cry for economy was now rather strong. The scandal is so
flagrant that we should not wonder at its enduring. It is sometimes
a misfortune to have too good a case.
The LokD CHANCELLOR announced that MR.EDw1N JAMEs's patent,
as one of the Queen's Counsel, was to be cancelled. So the last link is
broken that binds that patriot to an aristocracy-ridden and tyrannical old
rotten country, and he is free to soar upon the wings of the American
Eagle, if that dowmy bird is inclined to take him up. The New York
judges will, however, take notice of the act of the LoRD CHANCELLOR,
and may have their own ideas as to the causes which have induced him
to take a course so rarely adopted.
This Thames Embankment question is the most important domestic
topic of the day, and at the risk of being momentarily prosaic, Mr.
Punch begs to call attention to the state of the case. We want an
Embankment all along the north side of the river, from the City to the
Clock Tower at Westminster. We shall have it, but not unless Par-
liament and the nation speak out. For a wealthy Scottish Duke has
just built himself a fine house near Westminster Bridge, and he natu-
rally dislikes the having a road brought, between his garden and the
river. He and some rich friends have Bribed (with a big B, and you
can't touch us, Duke or anybody else)—have, we repeat, Bribed the Com-
mittee that had to report upon the subject. The Duke and his friends
offer £90,000 in aid of making the road, provided it is not taken
between the gardens and the river, and the Committee has been weak
enough to be bribed, on behalf of the British tax-payer, with this offer.
Not all the Committee, by the way. SIR. Joseph PAxton, SIR MoRtoN
PETo, CoLoREL BRowNLow KNox, and MR. Pollard URQUHART,
have resisted, but there were seven on the other side. Now, the Duke
of BucCLEUcII, for he is the chief obstructive, is a worthy man, and all
that, but we cannot sacrifice the Thames Embankment to his desire to
have a private garden. There will be a good fight over the business,
for he is very rich, and has immense influence, and therefore it behoves
Parliament to be wide-awake and resolute. The subscrvient Committee
are so ashamed of what they have done that they begin to defend them:
selves before they are hit, and LoRD Robert MonTAGU thought he had
done a very clever thing in attacking MR. CowPER for having held some
communication, on the subject with a gentleman who writes in the
Times, but the device was too transparent, and all that came of it was
that the House perceived that the Committee and those who º:
the Embankment are dreadfully afraid of the Press, and that a MR.
HIGGINs, who by mistake received a letter intended for the MR. Hig-
GINs, was described by MR. CowPER as a person whose acquaintance
the latter did not desire to improve. But all this is beside the mark–
the Mark is the Duke of Buccleuch until he is kind enough (and he
is a very kind Duke) to get out of the way.
MR. LAwson wants to º upon liquor in the spirit of the
Maine Liquor Law. It is perfectly clear, as SIR GEORGE GREY, told
him, that the people of this, country are not prepared for such legis-
lation. But something ought to be done, in presence of the fact that
great part of the crime of the country is attributable to drink. At
present “I was drunk,” is held to be an extenuation. . Make it an
aggravation-punish first for the drunkenness, and then for the crime,
and see whether the lesson can be learned. The Magistrates can do
this without any new law, if they be minded to try the experiment. .
SIR. F. GoLDSMID made a pathetic appeal to IORD PALMERstoN in
favour of certain Russian Jews who were accused in 1853 of a course
of murders, and who seem to have had their full run of appeals to all
the Russian tribunals ever, since. The final decision of the highest
Court is, that they were guilty, and they are sentenced to transportation.
LoRD PALMERston did not exactly see how to interfere in favour of
these interesting persons, but expressed a general and agreeable hope that
the legal arrangements of Russia would be improved, and added that the
present EMPEROR was a very humane man, which we rather think we
have heard before.
When we mention that there was an Indian debate, about soldiers,
and that SIR CHARLEs WooD came out with arguments and figures, we
are sure that we shall be excused from aiding that remarkable person
further to bewilder himself and the public.
We Live to be Deceived.
IT seems that there is no chance of securing a cab unless you happen
to be a party of three or four. This is the first time we ever knew a
cabman to evince the slightest reluctance in taking one in.

them there is one from some
persons named HARRIs—not

from a MR. Lewis Moses.
We can well understand HAR-
RIs, and LEwis Moses, in this
connection; but we have some
difficulty in understanding the
name which occurs in the
notification annexed:-

a different family from the

Another odd advertisement, also from the
Daily Telegraph, is the following:—
Fºlº DAIRY BUSINESS (without
Cows), in a first-class and rapidly improving neigh-
bourhood, for SALE, doing 17 to 21 barn gallons per day
all the year round.—Address, &c.
. They say that London milk is composed prin-
#. of sheeps' brains. If a dairy #. from
17 to 21 barn gallons of milk all the year round,
really does all that milk without cows, and the
milk is not made of sheep's brains, the ğairyman
must make it out of his own head. How he can
manage that is a puzzle. A dairy business with-
Qut, cows, must be supposed to mean one con-
ducted with only a single cow, the cow with
the iron tail, and such a dairy doing the enormous
quantity of milk above stated must also do a great
many people.
Musical Note and Query.
“MR. PUNCH,-Advertised at the head of a
list of pieces of dance musici noticed, the other
day, the title of a composition called the

“Once valued; Rejected; Discarded; Regretted:"
To which, just for the sake of marking the metre, might have been added:-
“Perhaps not yet paid for by persons indebted.”
The poetry, if not that of Levi, is quite in the style of Moses.

“Arenalla Walts.” Axenalla! Dear me, what
an odd name! Was there not a song, once
familiar among the populace, supposed to be
;}} a costermonger, and entitled, ‘I’m a
regular Az-my-eye?” Is that the ſoundation of
the waltz named Arenalla f Horrid idea!
“Ever yours, CHEVERIL.”
POLYGLOT CABMEN WANTED.
Now that London is so full of foreigners, who in general possess but
slight acquaintance with our language, we really think in mere polite-
mes something should be done towards assisting them in some degree
to comprehend our cabmen, and to understand the patois common to
our streets. How great must be the mental bewilderment of French-
men at hearing the slang phrases which, are used by cads and cabbies,
when either tly hold conversation with a º or make public
roclamation of the places they are going to. We can picture a poor
ossoo driven, almost, to despair by hearing the reiterated cries, of
“B'nk!” and “Steel” and searching vainly in his map to see in what
pºrt,0ſ the town are “Qbun”,and the “Hangel." The meaning ºf
“Old 'ard” he might more easily discover, but the dictionary would
scarcely give him much assistance in finding out the meaning of the
common phrase, “Now then, Sir!” Almost equallyH." lexing would
be the slang words used to designate our coins. His ‘. . of
our Christian names would afford him little help in distinguishing
between a “Joey” and a “Bob, nor would he be likely to discover in
his phrase-book what was actually required of him, when requested in
slang phrase to “jist fork out another tanner.”
It would have been an act of courtesy to our Continental guests if
some few score of foreign cabmen had been hired for the season, who
when they saw a Signor, a Mynherr or Mossoo, could have addressed
him in a language that he could comprehend. fut as this has not been
done, perhaps the next best step to take would be to teach our cabs and
cabbies a phrase or two of French, which they might use on being hired
by “one o' them there furring covies.” At this short notice they of
course would scarce be able to acquire the true Parisian accent; but
really one would think that with a very little practice they might at
any rate obtain so fºr a smattering of French as to say “Dippyeshywoo!”
instead of “Hi! look sharp !” and to reply with some politeness,
“Issy woosate, Mossoo /’’ instead of “Here you are, Sir!”

rather an Irish deputation, charged to present, him with a sword of
honour. The leaders of these delegates from the isle of potatoes and
Fº are stated to have been CARDINAL....WISEMAN, and DR.

enough to make a gratuitous demonstration of the friendship of Popery

commit himself and his party by such a blunder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 7
OUR (ANYTHING BUT) CRITIC AT THE HANDEL
FESTIVAL.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, - -
“If º of the nearly hundred thousand, visitors who have
been attending the Crystal Palace festival are tired yet of talking of
the pleasure they enjoyed at it, I rejoice to say that I am not one
of the number. ears have had a more than Alexander's Feast of
splendid music, and while the taste of the tit-bits is still fresh upon my
tongue, I like to chew the cud and ruminate and think how much
relished them. The proverb says, you cannot eat your cake and have
it; but to my hope, Sir, the flavour of the feast we have been having
will leave for weeks a pleasant recollection on one's palate, . HANDEI's
has been called the roast, beef of music;’ and I find his oratorios
nutritious mental food, that leaves upon the mind a lasting flavour of
sweet sounds, one of which is worth a myriad of SIGNOR WERDI’s
lollipops. - -
“I trust you did not think when you sent me to the Festival that I
was competent to write you a critical account of it. Had I been asked
to criticise, I might, not so much have enjoyed myself, for, my ears
would have been pricked up to listen chiefly for defects. As the critics
have however mostly written, nought, but praise, I am in no fear of
º; caste by echoing it. Minds unlearned in music often differ much
with learned ones; but there is that in HANDEL which affords delight
to both. While skilled ears are employed in following his fugues,
mine ignorantly revel in his grand majestic harmonies, which entrance
me while I hear them and thrill me to the bone. . If you are musical,
you doubtless must have felt this thrilling, which seems to quicken
every pulse and turn your skin to what the school-boys christen 'goose.
skin.' I am older, than I was (a remarkable fact that), and truth
. me to own that I have out-lived most “sensations,’ but I never
can hear HANDEL without a touch of “goose-skin.”
“You may call this affectation, and doubtless there are many of your
readers will agree with you. My good friend BLOBBERLY for instance
who has no more ear for music than an oyster, opens, his eyes.so wide
when I talk to him in this way that I sometimes feel a doubt if he will
ever get them shut again. BioBBERLY has told me he was present at
the festival, and felt none of the bone-thrilling, and goose-skin, I expe-
rienced; and his staring eyes expressed something stronger than sur-
prise when I attempted to convey to him a notion of my feelings.
“Even BLobBERLY, however, if his ears were not delighted, confesses
that his eyes were; and indeed I hardly know which sense found more
to charm it. Fond as HANDEL was of producing great effects, I wish
he could have lived to see that acre .*an orchestra, crammed with
hundreds zealous to do justice to his works. And a still more pleasant
sight to him it might have been to see that square half mile or so of
hearers, so many of them holding his music in their hands, § handy
littie books are those of yours, Niñ. Novello,) and reverently following
each note as it burst forth. It was a constant pain to HANDEL that his
works were not appreciated. He might have grieved less had, he
known how in a century they would be. There is no denying now that
England does him justice, The late festival and that of 'fifty-nine
have proved the fact. And I trust that now we have these festivals to
º: to, we shall hear no more stuff talked about the English people
having no great reverence for music, and that it is absurd in them to
set up their pretensions to be in any way regarded as at all a musical
nation. I hope too we shall now hear no more nonsense talked about
the Crystal Palace being quite unsuited for such, festivals... The place
may have defects—what concert-room has not ?—but take it for all in
all, pray where else are we to look upon its like? There are some
sour-minded people who delight in finding fault, and who declare they
paid their guineas' chiefly for the solos, and complain of being swindled
because they heard them badly. Well, I grant, a single voice (that of a
TITIENs excepted) can not be heard at Sydenham so well as in a con-
cert-room, although certainly the new roof very greatly helps the music
to spread its voice around.’ But, compared to the advantages, what
is that defect? You may hear a solo anywhere; but where, except at
Sydenham, can you hear such choruses? Any one singer you any day
may listen to; but it is not any day that you can listen to three thou-
sand. And to hear three thousand voices sing like one is even a
still rarer treat for ears to listen to. Yet this was what the sharpest
critics, own was heard at Sydenham. The three thousand were so
trained that they spoke all with one breath, as was proved by the plain
fact that their joined words were articulate.
“It will hardly weaken our remembrance of the festival, if we reflect
on the pains taken for securing that result. I think, consideling the
labour which he must, have endured, Commander-in-Chief Bowley
ought to be in public thanked; and gallant CAPTAIN GRoyE (one of
those ‘delightful pleasant Gāoves, eh, PURCELL2) to be at least
presented with a gold º penholder, in remembrance of the
É. good he has brought to the community. And I think, it would
ave been no whit more honour than he merited, if SIGNOR Costa had
* Query, crowns?-Punch.
been chaired as well as cheered when all was over, and if the prettiest
lips present had thanked him with a kiss.
“I hate encores in general; but to encore a whole performance is a
somewhat new idea, and good cause may be shown for the encoring of
this festival. HANDEL himself ho that men might be ‘made
better’ by the sermons he conſposed for them; and if this be their
effect, the oſtener we have the power of hearing them the better. When
I heard the Hallelujah, I wished that it were sung to an audience of
Atheists. It might have surely been the means f converting some of
them. A religion that, inspires such music must have something good
in it. And with this thought in my mind, again I cry encore to this
great HANLEL Festival.
“I º Mr. Punch, one whom you may call, but in no whit will
offend by calling “AN ENTHUSIAST.”
A DUCK OF A DOG LOST.
“Calceolaria Cottage, Monday.
O MY DEAR MR.PUNcil,
‘ OH ! I am so dis-
trest! Do just look at
this:—
N E G U IN E A R E-
WARD.—LOST, on Monday
evening at 6 o'clock, in Rotten
Row, near the Wellington Statue,
a small WHITE DOG, with pink
nose, answering to the name of
* Bellaº wearing a silver collar
with name and address, red
riband, and gold bell. Whoever
will bring the same to No. 20,
Ichabod Crescent, shall receive
the above reward.
“There now, isn't that
afflicting ! Only fancy what
an agony of grief the loss of
such a darling, must have
caused its mistress. Just
conceive her pangs at losing
her little pet's pink nose,
not to name its silver collar,
- red riband and gold bell.
It's enough to make one ſaint to think of such affliction, and I only
hope she will be able to survive it. , And besides the cruel torture of
the loss, there is the dreadful thought of what perhaps has happened
to her dog, and the misery which it may possibly be suffering. A pet
with a pink nose, silver collar and gold É. of course has fºe. most
tenderly and carefully brought up, and could not bear to rough it, as
coarser-bred dogs might. Nursed in the º % lurury—I mean the
apron of its mistress-of course the darling little duck has met with
every indulgence, and if suddenly deprived of its cream and lumps of
sugaº, it is afflicting to consider what its sufferings may be.
‘There is a Refuge for stray dogs, I understand, in Islington, or
some such outlandish district, but I sadly fear poor "Bella’ will never
find her way to it. A dog with a red riband, silver collar, and gold
bell, and accustomed to take exercise, as it would seem, in Rotten Row,
of course has never heard of such a place as Islington, or, if she have,
can hardly hope, poor thing, to get to it. ..It is very well for common,
vulgar, City dogs to have a Home in Islington which they may go to
when they lose themselves: but for runaways like “Bella’, there should
surely be a refuge somewhere nearer the West End, for little darling
with red ribands, pink noses, and gold bells of course cannot be ...:
to find their way about unfashionable neighbourhoods. -
“Trusting that your love for Toby will induce you to assist infounding
such a shelter, I remain, dear Mr. Punch,
“Yours Sincerely,
“JULIA Jones.”
...” We are ever anxious to do anything to please a lady, but Toby
tells us he knows Islington, and has no fear of being lost, and so juiſ.
must use some other argument to show us that a Refuge for Lost Dogs
at the West End is much wanted.

THE BURGLAR’s AspinATION.—A skeleton-key in every
cupboard.
SEVERAL NEW THEATRES.
Owing to the influx of Provincials and Parisians, the theatres of
London are very full just now, and if you go to the box-office and pro-
se to book stalls you are requested to come again in about five weeks,
r. Punch is therefore doing, good service to persons in search of
amusement by apprising them that if they will gº down to the Houses
of Parliament, they will witness, not in the Chambers of Debate but in
the Committee Rooms, a series of performances in which there is more
fun than can be found in most of the dramatic writing of the day. The
pieces performed have not much action, but the dialogue is first rate,
and is both directly and ". satirical in the highest degree.
The skeleton of a plot that holds them together is usually a Scheme for
making a Railway from some obscure place to another, and the fable is
composed of the efforts of one side to carry this, and of the other to
defeat it, but the main interest is in the questions put to witnesses,
who are of all kinds, from the haughty Lord Lieutenant of a .
down to the pig-jobber who wants easier transit for his grunting stoc
in trade. Counsel are allowed unlimited licence .# inquiry into
motives, family and neighbourly º personal history, and in ſact
may be as impertinent as they like, while the witnesses are never
checked for irrelevance or lº and make the most frank and feminine
revelations of local scandal. V hen the Committee have had enough of
it, they turn everybody out of the room, unless º: by a request
to come and join in the devotions of the Speaker. These É.
are real ſun, and Mr. Punch strongly recommends those who cannot
get stalls at the theatres to go down to Westminster.
Here are a few specimens, “culled at random, from the report of
an, inquiry, into some question about an Ellesmere, Oswestry, an
Whitchurch Railway. Mr. Punch knows, of course, nothing of the
merits, he has seen those names somewhere on the map, and believes
that the locality is somewhere in the direction of Shrewsbury. Elles-
mere is, he has heard, a town near a Mere, or lake, and the witnesses
declare that Ellesmere has been sinking for years, it may be submerged
by this time for aught he knows. But a heap of witnesses have been
examined, and the key-note may seem to have been given in this wise—
“MR. Rodwell objected to this being put in as evidence. As a lawyer, MR.
WHALLEY, you ought to know that such answers ought not to be given.
“MR. DENIsox. As a lawyer, MR. Rodwell, you have no business to administer
the rebuke. (Laughter.)"
Then a MR. WYNNE, who declares himself to be a Large Proprietor
was examined. The Large Proprietor appears to be now opposed to
MR. WHALLEy's views, but not always to have been so:-
“MR. Somerset. You were the man that went about Ellesmere in 1857, shouting
WHALLEY and Independence 1 (Laughter.)
“WITNEss. No, I didn't. Mr. Whalley was not there. The meeting was got up
by such as myself.
“MR. SomeRset. And is not MR. WHALLEY a man like yourself, who does all he
can for the district. (Laughter.)
“Witness. I wish I was as good a man as MR. WHALLEY. (Laughter.)"
It is always well to wish to be good—how good MR. Whauley may
be Mr. Punch has no idea, and therefore cannot say whether the Large
Proprietor's standard is a high one, or whether he is a humble-minded
Large Proprietor. Then SIR BALDw1N LEighton, a Salopian baronet,
à examined, and he has a chance of being facetious, and improves his
Chance:-
“MR. Jones. Is there any trade of any sort with Shrewsbury?
“Witness. I know of one gentleman who buys a few cigars there. (Laughter.)"
The fewer the better, if he can only get such cigars as were sold to
Mr. Punch the last time he thought he would have a weed as he walked
in the Quarry. He hurled the whole lot into the Severn, and takes
this opportunity of hoping that Sabrina fair was not made unwell by
his thoughtless act. }. aver matter came up. With the freedom of
speech allowed by this tribunal, it was urged that certain people who
took one side of the case were coerced by some magnate:–
“SERJEANT WrangHAM. You are one of the coerced tenants of Lord BR.own Low,
I believe? (Laughter.)
“Witness. I am a tenant, but I am “independent" (Laughter.) I know MR.
CofFIN; he is a shareholder in our line.
“MR. Stephenson. Has he been coerced 7
“WITNEss. He is a tenant of Lord Brownlow. You may form your own con-
clusion as to my opinion...(Laughter.) I know MR. CoPNELL, a butcher, he has
signed. . The BRowNLow trustees have great interest in our neighbourhood, and the
people do not like to go against them.
“MR. STEPHENson. Are all the 260 coerced?
“WITNEss. I won't say coerced, but there has been undue influence.
“MR. STEPHENSON. How about the REv. MR. Day 7

“WITNEss. He was a warm supporter of ours.
“Mr. STEPHENSON. Has he been coerced?
“WITNEss. Really, I would much rather not give an opinion.
“The CHAIRMAN. You cannot force this witness into answering these sort of
questions.”
“This” sort of questions would have been better. English, Mr.
Chairman, but never mind that. Then, came the great MR...WHALLEY,
and certainly he has no reason to complain that the utmost frankness of
speech was not used in his case. Previously came a little exchange of
legal amenities:-
“MR. DENIson. Let me have all these papers to cross-examine upon?
“MR. SomeRser. Anything I can do to assist you I am willing to do. (Laughter.)
“MR. DENIson. Thank you. Offers of civility are so rare t I esteem them
accordingly. (Laughter.)
“MR. SomeRset. I copy from my neighbours."
Well, they got at MR. WHALLEY. Some allusion had been made to
his oratorical powers, of which it may not be disrespectful to say that the
honourable gentleman is thought to be somewhat proud. He proceeded
to reply as to a meeting that had been held:—
“MR. SomeRs.ET. Did M.R. PIERCY recommend you as an “orator' there?
“MR. DENIson. I object to that style of question, it is put in an unnecessarily
offensive way, and the answer, whatever it is, is not evidence.
“MR. Somerset. I don't shrink from the question.
“WITNEss. I think such questions are unbecoming the position of a gentleman
like MR. SoMERset.
“MR. SomeRset. MR. WHALLEY, you flatter me !
“The CHAIRMAN. Really all this is not evidence.
“Wits Ess. There is not one tittle of foundation for all these charges, nor have I
done anything to deserve such questions.
“MR. SomeRsET. The term ‘orator' is not mine, it was MR. WELSBy’s.”
Now it so happens that MR. WELSEY is not only a distinguished
lawyer, but a courteous and accomplished gentleman, and he imme-
flººr laid a heavy hand upon this MR. SomeRSET and squashed him—
thus—
“MR. WELsby. As my name is drawn into the discussion, allow me to say that
there was nothing in my remark to justify Mr. SomeRset in asking so disreputable
a question."
A FOOL ON FORTIFICATIONS.
LL sensible persons will share
If the examining lawyers all imitated MR. WELSBY, and conducted
their examinations in the spirit of gentlemen, Mr. Punch would have no
ersonalities to set down, and he is therefore rejoiced to find that MR,
oMERSET, in reply to another observation to the effect that he was not
justified in asking certain questions replied—
“I don't care, I shall ask them.”
And to do him justice, he went on in the same amiable tone. For
instance, he said to MR. WHALLEY-
“Mr. Somerset., Do you mean to say that you were prepared to pay the £64,000
had you been called upon?
“WITNEss. What do you mean? Of course I was.”
MR. Whalley’s indignation broke forth into further remark:—
“I am at a loss to know why I am taunted, because I did not subscribe so much
as others. Nor can I see what all this has to do with the question at issue. If the
committee require it, I will prepare a statement of all I have ever paid.
“MR. Somerset. If you did, my cross-examination would be much more dis-
agreeable. MR. WHALLEY is free enough in his remarks against other people, and 1
have a right to say what I do.
“Witness. I defy you or any one else to find a word in any newspaper, or prove
it elsewhere, that I have even said one word that could be construed into an attack
on any one.
“Mr. SomeRSET. Can you say so, Sir, with that gentleman (pointing to CAPTAIN
Cust) sitting in the room, when you have week after week gone about making
charges against him?
“WITNEss. I have never said one disrespectful word about him."
All this sort of thing must be so highly conducive to a desirable
result, and information as to what WHALLEY may have said of Cust
must so materially assist a Committee in deciding whether a railway
Qught to go from Ellesmere to Oswestry, or wherever, it is wanted, that
Mr. Punch, 1ejoices to discover that there are tribunals where the
pedantic and fastidious rules of ordinary Courts are set at nought for
the advantage of the public. He repeats his suggestion to persons in
search of amusement, that they should go down to these Committee
§ and he intends to keep his own great cye upon them a little for
e tuture.

And a proclamation
the astonishment thus re-
ported to have been ex
ressed in the House of
ords by the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE:—
“The argument which has
been used in another place,
that it was derogatory to the
English soldier to fight be-
hind walls (laughter), is the
most extraordinary which I
can conceive."
Why yes, if it is dero-
gator; to the English
tº soldier to fight behind
walls, it is also derogatory
to the English sailor to
fight behind iron plates,
and even behind wooden
planks, in case those
— planks are strong enough
to afford him any protec-
tion from shot and shell.
It would be *::::::".
to the English soldier to
fight behind walls, if
there were no artillery,
and if he were outnum-
bered in no greater pro-
portion than that of three
o one, because under
t
those circumstances it is to be supposed that he would be able to beat any possible adver.
Sary.
cited by the DUKE of
- So it would be derogatory to the English sailor to fight behind either planks or plates
if he had the option of fighting hand to hand by boarding the enemy's vessel.
The argument
AMBRIDGE as having been used in another place was used in the
House of Commons, but the only place in which it is conceivable that such an argument can
have been used, with any seriousness is a lunatic asylum. The logician who used it is a
military one, and a place ought to be secured for him in the insane ward, if there is one, of
the new Hospital at Netley; in the meanwhile he should be placed under proper restraint.
He that, as DR, J9HNSON would have observed, maintains it to be derogatory to the English
soldier to fight behind walls, might as well contend that it is derogatory to the English soldier
to fight behind buttons.

PUNCH GOING TO THE DOGS.
Wish ING to give Toby a treat, Mr. Punch took him the other day to
the Dog Show at lslington. On arriving near the building (which is a
rcat improvement on the stifling shed in Baker Street, though we
fear our farming friends in petticoats and pinafores will scarcely like to
be so far removed from their loved Wax Works), Mr. Punch thought
that the cabman had mistaken his direction, and had driven him to
Barking. Such a chorus of canine sounds ſell upon his ear, that all
the dogs exhibited seemed members of the Bark Society. Every kind
of voice was heard, ſrom the baying of the blood hound to the yap of
the toy-terrier; and Mr. Punch could not help thinking in what terror
all the cats within earshot must have been, and how their tails must
have expanded with horror as they listened.
Upon entering the building, Mr. Punch made his bow; and Toby his
bow-wow; and then Mr. Punch proceeded leisurely to take note of the
celebritics, both human and canine. Among the former, Mr. Punch
was pleased to see a fair proportion of the fairer sex, who flocked as
eagerly to the show, as they would do to a Flower ditto. It was plea-
sant to see Beauty occasionally patting some pet hound that she had
recognised, or else curiously peering at some wrinkled-nosed and bandy-
legged and blear-eyed looking bull-dog, and wondering for what prize,
excepting one for ugliness, it could possibly compete.
Toby was much envied in his progress through the show, not merely
on account of his position in the world, but because of the mere fact
that he happened to be loose. Mr. Punch indeed observed that envy
is a passion to which dogs are sadly prone: for, directly any dog was
let loose by its keeper, and taken a short walk, the dogs it passed all
snapped and snarled and growled most savagely, as though they could
tºl bºar to see it getting any pleasure which they could not share.
Mr. Punch might have lectured them a little on this ſailing, but one
can’t well blame a dog for doing what one does oneself; and well nigh
faultless as he is, Mr. Punch has very often felt a pang of envy when
sitting hard at work for the improvement of mankind, he has surveyed
the outer world from the window of his study, and has seen men with
| Fº their horses, and their fishing-rods, while he was fast chained
to the desk.
DEFENCE OF CRINoLINE.-Man should receive it joyfully and grate-
fully as a striking proof that it is physically impossible for Lovely

PHYSICIANS IN STAYS.
The question as to the competency of the softer sex to receive the
diploma of doctor of medicine has been decided by the º
College of Physicians, in a majority of eighteen to sixteen, against the
ladies. . We are glad the minority was so large, for we think it was in
the right., There is no reason §: lady learned in medicine should
be refused a doctor's degree. , Nobody would be obliged to º a
medical woman in preference to a medical man. It is very true that
it is necessary that a practitioner of medicine should be endowed with
reflective faculties; but perhaps reason is not quite exclusively the
prerogative of man. Qne or two women could be named whose works
exhibit undeniable evidences of some logical faculty, and judgment of
causation. A female HARVEY, or SYDENHAM, or HUNTER, or ABER.
NETHY would possibly turn up, if the portals of medicine were not shut
in her face. - -
On the principles of Free Trade, the Edinburgh ºf: of Physicians
should reconsider their ungallant, if not unphilosophical decision. We
will not suppose that they are afraid of competition with old women
and apprehend that any diminution of their professional ºf: would
result from the concession of the liberty of taking fees to females.

Only think of FRIAR BAcon's Brazen Head writing thus of itself:—
“Another immense success achieved by the Author of the Colleen Bawn."
“On every occasion experienced a rapturous reception,” &c.
“It is on the character of GRIMALDI, and its thorough elaboration by Mr. Bouci-
CAULT, that the attraction of the piece depends, and the talent he displays in an
entirely new line is likely to cause a considerable sensation. At times the applause
was quite uproarious, and the house rang with acclamation.”.
We should advise MR. D. B., to apply for the next presentation to
the office of City Trumpeter with the privilege of blowing his own
trumpet.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June the Last (we are happy to say, only that July seems
worse). HENRY BROUGHAM, born in St. Andrew's Square, Edinburgh,
1778, (but an Englishman if you º and descended from GILBERT
DE BROHAM, of Westmoreland) has been working so well for the last
sixty years, that it would savour of the sin which is worse than witch;
craft to deny his right to amuse himself in any way that he likes. And
therefore we merely note that just now it is his Lordship's amusement
to make a strong little speech one night, and apologise on the next for
anything, that may have given offence. This evening, he spoke with
much righteous disgust of the fratricidal war in America, and on the
following night stated that some American friends had accused him of
exaggeration. We cannot say that a perusal of American papers in-
duces us to think that his Lordship's friends were justified in rebuking
“the old man eloquent.”
LoRD BERNERs moved the Second Reading of his Bill for meeting the
nuisance complained of by LoRD, DERBy and others, namely, the Armed
Gangs of Poachers. , Some of these black gangs, it seems, steal not
only the Pheasant, but the Pig, whose bacon, or saddle, may in that
case remind us of Black Gang Chine. However desirable some remedy
might be, this measure looked like a regular Front de Boeuf enactment,
for it empowered constables to take up anybody, between sunset and
eight in the morning, without warrant, on suspicion of poaching. Mr.
Punch himself might, under it, be seized in the course of one of his
i. morning walks of meditation for the good of mankind, and the
hard-boiled egg which he carries for refreshment on such occasions
would at once be evidence in the eyes of a non-ornithological peeler,
who knows nothing about birds, though acquainted with Beaks. On
divers representations by the CHANCELLOR and others, LoRD BERNERs
withdrew the Bill, undertaking that the lawyer who was to draw the
substitute should draw it mild. Later in the week he brought in
another, which will É to a Select Committee.
MR. Hopwoop, of Clitheroe, Conservative, asked LoRD PALMERSTON
whether Government intended to interfere in the American war. LoRD
PALMERSTON replied with ample testimony to the manner in which
our operatives who suffered by the war bore their trouble, but ex-
pressed his belief that they would not be benefited by any present
attempt at mediation, as it would assuredly be rejected. . .
The friends of the DUKE of BuccLEUCH, with a certain cleverness,
take every opportunity of drawing off attention from the real question
to personal questions, such as the mistake made by Lord Dundreary (as
the HQN.MR. CowPER is irreverently called by his friends) in the matter
of the letter to MR., HIGGINs. To-night there was another long screed
about it, and Mr. Punch will avail himself of a favourite contributor's
summary of the affair:-
“LoRD PALMERSTON. There is nothing in the world more calculated to lead to no
result than a discussion about what I said, and you said, and somebody else said—
º: it is quite certain that no two individuals will as to what
was said by either party. (Renewed Laughter.) I should hope the noble Lord
(Robert MonTAGUE) having disburthened himself of I will not say a recantation—
but of his explanation, that this conversation may be allowed to drop. (Hear, hear.)
The noble Lord will allow me to say, I think he has found a mare's nest.”
Just so. But the BUCCLEUCH faction are wise in their generation in
endeavouring to talk about anything rather than the facts, for it now
comes out, that one of those facts materially differs from a fact as
originally represented. It seems that the people who resist the em-
bankment do not want to º the £90,000, as formerly, alleged, but
that they want that sum laid out by the Crown agent, in reclaiming
soil from the river, for the use of which reclaimed land they do not
mind paying a good rent...We should think, they did not. It is only
patriotism, that prevents Mr. Punch from saying, that if the authorities
ill cut a beautiful garden for him from No. 85, Fleet Street down to
the river, which they can easily do by taking away St. Bride's Church
and demolishing Salisbury Square and Dorset Street (they must ask SIR
Joseph PAXTON how the land, when acquired, should be laid out), he will
pay a very handsome, rent, and also put the clerk of the works on the
free-list of Punch for the rest of the clerk's natural life. No, it is not
patriotism that prevents him, but the fact that such a proposal is not
quite so outrageous as that of the BuccLEUCH ſolks, and he scorns to
be outdone in outrageousness, even by a Duke, ..
The Fortifications Bill came on for Second Reading, and there was a
long debate, in which the same things that were said in the previous

Government carried the Second Reading by 158 to 56.
MR. Collier, we don't mean the Parliament lawyer, but the

Street? The Bill of sale was read a Second Time. Remember, MR.
CoLLIER, the owl was a Baker's daughter; Touchstone speaks of wooing
a Peascod instead of Jane Smile; the scene of the Merry Wives is
at Windsor; if those are not three sufficing Shakspearian reasons for
buying the place, we cannot help you to any better.
Tuesday. This was the first of July, and the leading Ministers were
much more pleasantly engaged than in parliamentary battle. . They had
gone to Osborne to see DR CHARLEs Thomas LANGLEY, Archbishop
of York, unite PRINCE Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt, and PRINCEss
ALICE of England and of Mr. Punch's heart, in holy matrimony.
Some Lords debated the Scotch Salmon Bill, and several of them
abused it. LoRD MALMESBURY took the º of mentioning
that he was an angler, which we are glad to hear, because all anglers
are good men, and contemplative. He thought the Bill despolic, but
so is the EMPEROR of Austria, yet LQRD MALMESBURY never assailed
him. The DUKE OF ARGYLI, ić that he once tried his hand at salmon-
reform, which piscatorial chivalry had procured him from LoRD DERBY
the complimentary information that he must be very young and very
green” to think he could carry such a Bill. Well, young his Grace
might have been, in fact he is a now, for he was born in 1823, but
green is the last colour we should ſº thought of associating with his
name. The Bill was read a Second Time. . . . .
Mr. Punch mentioned last week that his friend of Oxford had
brought in a Bill for making bishops in heathen countries. ... The
Record printed the measure, or Mr. Punch might not have seen it, for
it was withdrawn to-night and a new one was introduced. We must look
at it—the other was a curious measure, and proposed to * power to
DR. SUMNER to create bishops, of any colour, who were to be subject to
the Archbishop, but need not take the oath of allegiance. We do not
know how this would work, or whether a black priest in a white gown
would look as well as a white priest in a black gown. The only Black
Bishops we have ever seen, as yet, are on the chess-board, but we do
not know why there should not be a RIGHT HON. AND Right Rev.
QUAsh EE BUNGo, D.D. - -
The Commons had a morning sitting for enabling Irish Members to
abuse SIR. Robert PEEL. This was done, and the Irish Poor Relief
Bill went through Committee. In the evening, though MR. Scully
did not rise, there was a Count-Out.
Wednesday. As Mr. Punch did MR. BERKELEY the honour to inform
him would be the case, the Ballot Bill, on Second Reading, was not
found to have derived much security from the Snapped Division. The
speech which MR. BERKELEY suddenly bottled up on the former occa:
sion was poured out, and was not very flat. SIR GEORGE GREY said
that the ballot would not prevent bribery, and as for secresy, it was
part of an Englishman's nature to avow his politics. The House took
the same view, and the Bill was thrown out by 2ll to 126, majority
against it, 85. But, last year, 279 divided against it, defeating 154
who were for it, facts that tell two ways, and neither way tell the truth.
The Bill for amending the Act for creating the Board for amending
London went into Committee, and MR. Locke contended that the sai
Board was unpopular. MR. TITE said it was nothing of the kind.
This was apropos of an attempt to alter the constitution of the Board,
which attempt was resisted on the ground that the Board was just
now very busy down in the big drains, and it was inopportune to call
it to come up a trap and be improved.
Thursday. The victorious proceedings of to-night and of the next night,
Friday, may be flºpropriately bracketted. The Embankment Question
came up again. “The DUKE's Company” made another attempt at
leading the House away from the real question, and LoRD PALMERSTON,
fresh from Oxford (where he has been made a l).C.L.), and therefore
extra-classical, likened them to the heathen deities, who were always
trying to save their favourites in a cloud. There was a long debate;
SIR John SHELLEY showed his great concern for the Duke, and his
small regard for his constituents; and as to MR. HoRSMAN, he is ever
in extrences:
“So over-violent or over-civil,
That every man with him 's a god or devil.”
It pleased him to º up the DUKE of BuccLEUCH, who is really
a very excellent nobleman, but who, if he were only half as perfect as
MR. HoRSMAN described him, ought to be solicited to take the abso-
lute government of the country, in fact of the universe. Mr. Punch
never saw, butter so layishly poured out, as by this Radical upon the
Conservative Duke. MR. KER SEYMER abused the Press, which it is
thought, may survive his castigation. LoRD PALMERstos, gladdened
the heart of the public by declaring at the end of the first debate, that
he saw no reason for altering the original. Embankment plan. On the
following night the fight was renewed, and after a vast quantity of talk,
MR. Locke, brought the Committee to a division on his amendment,
which raised the direct issue between the parties. The Government
d not come up to the scratch as they ought to have done, and,
trying a compromise, got into a minority, and serve them right. The
numbers were,
For the Public . . . . . 149
For the Duke - - - - - 109
Majority for the Public 40
The Bill made further progress, and though we do not quite see it clear
of shoals and gulfs, its principle is safe.
The only other noteworthy matter was that SIR,GeoRGE GREY de-
clined to interfere with the omnibuses and cabs, and seemed to intimate
that as this is an exceptional year, we ought to submit to any imposition.
One would think he was an International Commissioner, casting about
for new ways to make Exhibitions popular.
PRETERNATURALLY NEAT.
oxEs, one of our Giſted Composers, was
languishing, the other day for words for
an opera which he threatened to write.
Addressing himself to one of Mr. Punch's
young men, he said: “I saw PHELPs in
a play that would make a good opera
book. It was called The Man of the
JWorld.”
Instantly answered Mr. Punch's young
man, with a pleasing smile: “That might
be a winning card, you know. For as
SENECA observes:–Erpugnet PERTINAx

known fact, here is an advertisement inserted !. in a weekly paper,
and playgoers would certainly do well to have a look at it:—

Antiques, and Silk Velvet Dresses, of first-class quality and manufacture, To

Now, you “Brainless British Public,” what have you to say to this?
If you are not ashamed of your “stupidity,” most certainly you ought
to be. Here perhaps—who knows?--you have been driving from the
stage a lady who in time, perhaps, might have become an actress. She
has talent, it is stated, although you could not appreciate it; and one
would almost fancy that she must have money too, or she could
not have bought awardrobe “regardless of cost,” unless indeed her
regardlessness arose out of the fact that she did not mean to pay for it.
If the charge be really true, that you have forced her from the stage

your right to look for something more than merely walking wardrobes

Well, if you say this, there are many on the stage as well as off it will
agree with you; and only they will call you “brainless” who are them-

SAWNEY IN THE NEW FOREST.
THE Scotch Duke is characterised by the speciality of being a great
enemy to progress; he is not only adverse to popular advancement,
to the march of intellect and reform, but also endeavours physically
to arrest the footsteps of the people and dispossess them of their right
of way. He is celebrated for barring tourists out of glens or any other
picturesque places unfortunately belonging to him, through which a
pass has existed from time #sºft so that personally even more
than politically, he is the reverse of Liberal. These remarks, of
course, do not apply to the esteemed representative of that exceptional
Scottish nobleman of ducal rank, whose posts, erected, to alleviate a
national grievance, all over his estate, procured for him the benediction
of the Highland wayfarer. -
Other Scotch Dukes, however, are content to limit the exercise of
their obstructive powers or propensities to their native land, and their
immediate neighbourhood, amongst a population which renders them
divine honours. But BucCLEUCH has the audacity to attempt coming
the Scotch Duke even here in England, in London itself, on the very
banks of the Thames, and not only In fondon, but also in the country,
in a remote corner of the county of Hampshire. The Hampshire Inde:
pendent of last week contains the following paragraph, under the head
of “Hythe Petty Sessions:”— .
“A DISPUTED RIGHT of WAY.-WILLIAM PRAGNELL was summoned on two P
separate charges of wilfully damaging some gates, which had recently been erected
across a road at Sowley Coppice, near Lymington.—MR. Davies appeared for the
defendant, and MR. LEIGH for the DUKE of BUccLEUCH, the Lord of the Manor.
The defendant formally admitted the damage, but set up that there was a public
right of way along the road, a number of aged witnesses, one of whom had attained
to 89 years, proving that for 70 years the public had used the road without molesta.
tion from any one, and that many of the inhabitants had proceeded that way to their
work, or to chapel or church, without being stopped.—The Bench, under these cir-
cumstances, thought the defendant might reasonably have º ed he had a right
of way, and declined to adjudicate.—The case occupied sever ours.”
. The Lord of the Manor of Sowley is exhibiting himself altogether
in the character of a Boar. , Sowley Coppice, in spite of its name,
which is no prejudice to it in the land of Bacon, is a lovely place, where
the hazel grows, and the mossy ground in early spring of course is
besprinkled with primroses. Through all this beauty lies the pathway,
free beyond the memory of the oldest inhabitant, which SAwNEY wants
to close, in the spirit of a pig. ... But no Hampshire hog would do such
a churlish thing, the Boar of Calydon would not have been brute
enough to be capable of so swinish an act, the attempt at which has
been made by the Caledonian Boar.
We trust that the Court above will decide the question, whereon the
Hythe, Magistrates (who appear to be a different sort of gentlemen
from the majority of the #. Embankment Commissioners) have
declined to adjudicate, against BUCCLEUCH. As SAwNEY’s design of
spoiling the Thames Embankment is frustrated, so may he also fail
§: in that of stopping the way through the primroses in Sowley
pplce.
International Imposition.
THE Commissioners of the International Exhibition require visitors
to the picture galleries to deposit their sticks, and pay a tax of a penny
for the custody of those appurtenances. This is another little picking,
additional to the per-centage levied on refreshments and the sale of
useless catalogues. The walking-stick dodge of these crafty Commis-
#. is another device by which they design to stick it into the

FREAKS OF FASBION.
We have noticed a sweet thing in parasols. It is made of white
satin, with a lining of pink . like the gills of a mushroom, the
stalk being ivory, so that altogether it exhibits a pleasing resemblance
to that elegant fungus.
In bonnets we have the pleasure to announce an exquisite novelty.
The front of the bonnet is shaped like a Church-window in the pointed
style, and trimmed at the sides, with rolls of muslin to represent
mouldin , and a dº. supported on either side by a rose in the
place of a corbel. One of the mouldings is filled with the toothed
ornament of the Early English pattern. Two trefoiled arches extend
over the head, and are surmounted by aquatrefoil, and the tout ensemble
is coquettish. This bonnet is much worn by young ladies, and is par-
| ticularly becoming to the middle-aged. y par
THIE SANDWICH HIGHLAND COSTUME.
The Post, in a notice of Messrs. M'DougALL's tartans in the Inter-
national Exhibition, mentions a fact which will be regarded with
interest on one side of the Tweed, and create amusement on the other.
With reference to those masterpieces of Scottish industry, our contem-
porary says:-
“Some idea may be formed of the variety of lands into which these famous
Scotch dresses are being introduced when we state that the identical class of High-
land dress which was worn at Culloden in the days of ‘PRINck Chaklik, the use of
which was prohibited shortly after the rebellion of '45, was actually worn but
recently by the Prime Minister (himself a Scotchman) of the King of the Sandwich
Islands on some great State occasion, and we may add, to the great delight of his
Majesty and the Court.”
Thus we see how highly native taste admires the Highland dress.
That strikingly picturesque costume does not indeed astonish the natives,
but delights them vastly. We can well understand the gratification
which the Scotch Premier of the King of the Sandwich Islands afforded
that enlightened Sovereign and his intelligent Court by wearing it on a
State occasion. If the canny Scotchman, accoutred as he was, had
danced a strathspey into the bargain, he would have, no doubt, afforded
still greater satisfaction to his royal and distinguished spectators.
But if the tartan thus captivates the Sandwich Islanders, in what a
high degree would it not be likely to charm the aborigines of the West
Coast of Africa? We should like to know what DoceMo, the ex-King
of Lagos, would say to it. So intensely is the Highland garb likely to
enrapture the negroes, that the missionaries of civilisation among the
Africans should by all means adopt it as, their travelling wear. It
would doubtlessly invest them with irresistible influence over the KING
of DAHOMEY and his sable subjects in a peaceful invasion of the
territories of that *. and people. Figuring in the fabrics of
M‘DQUGALL of the brightest pattern, smart as snuff-shop statues, and
carrying large mulls, filled with the “sneeshin’” of conciliation, they
would march triumphantly over prostrate barbarism, especially iſ, since
“music hath charms to soothe the savage breast,” they were to march
preceded by a piper of the clan, M'QRpheus, playing some of those
rayishing pibrochs which resound in harmony with the philibeg, the
spleuchan, the sporran, and the bonnet with the cairngorm stuck in it,
and the eagle's feather.

THE BAULD BUCCLEUCH.—A BORDER BALLAD.
OH ! have ye na heard o' the mild CowPER,
Oh! have ye na heard o' the keen PAxtoun,
How they ha’ ta'en Whitehall-Roadway up
When i. Bauld BuccLEUch wad ha’ put
it doun:
Had the Bauld BuccLEUCH than ae HoRSMAN,
a
To strike a stroke for each Crown-Lessee,
I trow the PAXToun for a his brains,
He ne'er had gotten a Committee.
“Now a fig for works for the public F.
And a highway frae brig to brig a through:
A road where Montague House doth stan
Shall never rin,” quoth the Bauld Buc-
CLEUCH.
Oh! a merry man was PENNETHORNE, .
When his plan had passed the Committee,
But seven-foot Higgins, that gruesome man;
Hath vowed through the House he shall ne'er
win free.
He hath drawn his pen against PENNETHORNE,
And lightly hathrun him through and through,
Though Jolliff E and SHELLEY and HoRSMAN
o' Strood
They have vowed his day’s work he should rue.
Hehath gibbeted PENNETHoRNE and his plan
On the Printing-House-Square pillorie,
And hath sent them, under bond and ban,
To the Commons, justiced there to be.
Then it’s up and spoke a lither lad,
LoRD Robert THE MONTAGUE, loose of
tongue, -
“’Twas along of thee, thou false CowPER,
That PENNETHORNE he came to wrong.
“A letter thou sent’st to the big HIGGINs,
But the little HIGGINs it came unto;
Oh! wilt thou dare this deed avouch,
And answer it to the Bauld BucCLEUCH "
“Now haud thy tongue,” quoth the mild
CowPER, -
“There's never a mare's-nest thou did'st see,
But thou must lay º hand to the eggs,
Tºuter thereby thyself should'st
>
Now word is gone to the Bauld BuccLEUch,
In Dalkeith Palace where that he lay,
How the Times hath fall’n foul o' PENNE-
ThoRNE's plan
In letters and articles, day by day.
And how big HiggiNs he hath sworn,
So help him the House and his ain good pen,
That busses past Montague House should ride,
In spite o' BUCCLEUCH and a his men.
He has tae’n the table wi' his hand,
And the GLADSTONE claretgarr'dspringonhie,
“Now my strawberry leaves to a barekail runt,
But avenged of this HIGGINs I will be
“Oh! is Montague House a gin-palace,
Shall a Duke but as ane o' the public be?
Am I BRowN, JONES or ROBINson,..
That a seven-foot HIGGINs should lightly me?
“And have they sworn that 'busses shall rin
Past Montague House that I build sae fair,
And Hansom-cabs, wi' the fares therein,
Gae º the Thames and my garden
Stall
“And have they ta'en him, PENNETHORNE 2
And have they flung his plans aside,
And forgotten that the bauld Buccleuch
Is Keeper o' Thames by Whitehall side?
“And have they ta'en him, PENNEThoRNE,
Withouten either dreid or fear,
And forgotten that the bauld BuccLEUch
Hath a gone at his back, and a HoRSMAN
near :
Oh, were there love 'twixt the Premier and me,
As well I wot that there is none,
I would slight fause CowPER and a his Works,
Though 'twere gall and grieſ to PALMERSTON!
“Oh, gin I were in the Commons' House,
Sic a flee I’d pit in CowPER's ear,
That never mair his tongue should wag
In Parliament this mony a year !
“But since I’m no in the Commons' House,
But in the Lords, whaura Duke suld be,
I’ll speak nae word in Parliament,
But ºrinoise, plan yet saved shall
e.”
He has called him seven retainers true,
The right o' BuccleucH for to maintain;
There was Montague, SHELLEY, and CRAw-
FORD,
KER SEYMER and GARNETT, JoLLIFFE and
WANE.
And eke the wild HoRsMAN he hath called,
That was worth the seven, tauld through and
... through, .
Wi’ tongue to hit, and teeth to haud,
And bile o' green, and brow o' blue.
There were four upon the Committee,
That for the roadway held outright;
And seven were for the bauld BuccLEUch,
That º, PENNETHORNE and his plan made
In front the wild HoRsMAN he did ride,
With LORD JoHN MANNERs, sae bland and
brave;
And they ha' gone to the Commons' House
Stout PENNETHORNE and his plan to save.
And as they came to the 'bateable land,
Through which all Parliament Bills must fare,
The first man that they lighted on,
Who should it be but i. fause CowPERE!
The HoRSMAN up in his stirrups stood,
And set him firm in the saddle-tree,
And cried his cry as he were wode,
And at CowPER hath ridden furiouslie.
But the Cowper he was ne'er the man
To joust, when jouking wad win the day,
Sae he louted low at his horse's side,
And the HoRSMAN's thrust it went astray.
Then on him SIR WILLIAM JoLLIFFE set,
And LoRD JoHN MANNERs, the debonair,
And SIR John the SHELLEY-four to one,
I trow such odds were less than fair!
Oh..sae sore bested was the mild Cowper,
That he scarce had breath to wind his horn,
But the blast reached stout LoRD PALMERstos,
That never brooked to see friend o'erborne,
Much less WILL CowPER, that at his knee,
As a little foot-page was wont to ride,
So he spurred right into the hot melée,
And he strook four strokes on either side.
The first SIR. John THE SHELLEY upset,
The secondit stopped LoRD John his tongue,
The third and JoLLIFFE he had enough,
The fourth from his steed the HoRsMAN flung.
There was never a stroke at CowPER struck,
But PALMeRSTON on his shield hath ta'en;
There was never a thrust for Cowper meant,
But PALMERSTON parried and gave again.
“Now a rescue! a rescue !” CowPER he cried,
And a glad glad man I trow was he,
To see the good strokes that PALMERSTON
Dealt round him on BuccLEUch's menyé.
“Now beshrew thy blunders,” quoth PALMER-
STON,
As he breathed his old but stout Destrere,
“Thou hast bred more bate, in a session,
trow,
Than I have done in fifty year!”
“Lookout! Look out! See where in selle
The HoRSMAN levels lance again,
With many a stalwart man-at-arms,
Thatºver have bound them to main-
Oh ºf was the fight, and sore the stour,
And ſoud was either slogan borne,
“Embankment—Roadway and public rights!”
“Strikefor BuccLEUch and PENNETHORNE!”
“Now a truce' a truce''' cried PALMERSTON,
“For space of a year let fighting be,
And then to the fate of PENNETHorsº,
And of his plans let both sides see.”
“Now nay, now may !” replied John Locke,
That was of Southwark, a stalwart squire,
To win his spurs in that mêlée,
Iween, it was his heart’s desire.
“No truce' no truce''' and waving high
The Roadway standard he that day bore,
He charged amain and from HoRsMAN’s hand
BUccLEUch's black pennon rudely tore.
Faint heart and stout all turned in rout,
Rescue nor rallying mote there be—
The SHELLEY he fled, and the MoxTAGUE,
And Jolliffe and WANE and SEYMER-KEY!
And PENNEThor NE he is held in hauld,
And his plans, oh they are torn in two,
And the seven wi' HoRSMAN are put to shame,
And vanquished is the Bauld BuccLEUch!
THE SELECT ATLAS.
MR. PUNCH, who sees everything (except the fitness of CHARLEY
WooD for Indian Government), recently observed, somewhere near his
own Palace, the announcement of an Atlas with the above title. It
seems just the thing that was wanted. He would like a little exclusive
geography. He would wish to do with nations what MR. Mudi E
professes to do with books, namely, to ignore any that are of a vulgar,
offensive, or disputatious character. He would desire an Atlas with no
Maps in it except those of countries in which a gentleman can really
e an interest. The volume might be thin, so much the better—he
hates fat books. “Let him have books about him that are thin.” If
the Select Atlas is prepared, upon the principle he has advanced, he
should like to see it. A good deal in the way of civilisation might be
done by “cutting ” all nations that do not conduct themselves with
grace and decorum. A Chart, entitled Orbis Puncho Notus, would be a
festimonial of character to the countries therein named, and act like
the Lord Chamberlain's new certificate that a person is entitled to be
presented at court, and it would be excessively useful for, educational
purposes, Ladies, and properly educated children, should know no
more of places not down in that chart, than they do of the Minories,
Seven Dials, or Red Lion Square. He agrees with Sir Peter Teazle,
id: is a sad wicked world, and the fewer peoples we know the
etter.” -

A muean-
MRS. GAMP'S COLLEGE,
ONE of the weekly, penny Guides to Politics and Social
Science, has discovered (and blurts, out the news, with an
infantine eagerness refreshing in its way) that the ladies
of England are no better than they ought to be, for that
ºt in the hour of need they send for a Doctor. Penny Wisdom
- proclaims that women should know better than to do any-
thing so objectionable, and that instead of calling in a
º Rs. GAMP ought to be sent for. To be sure,
Rs; GAMP is not yet quite the thing for a lady's chamber
but then Mrs. Gºiris to be encouraged to cleanse herself,
abstain from ardent fluids, read DR. BUCHAN, and call
herself MRs. DR. GAMP. At present, the scheme seems
to languish ºil." because it is not probable that many
ladies in Éngland are aware of the utterances of the
wisdom, in question, perhaps because, with the weakness
and prejudice of the sex, they cling to the belief that brain
education, and social, position are desirable attributes of
an adviser to whom the most sacred confidences are made.
However, such obstacles are in course of being overcome,
and we read (in queer English, certainly) that Twelve
Stamps have just been sent in aid of a Gamp College, and
that “a Father of a Family thinks” that much might be
done if the Times, Daily Telegraph, &c., would take up the
matter “in addition toº, Penny Wisdom, . Possibly, so
just as our friend the O'MULLIGAN thought that his beel
would be as good as gold if one of them fellows, BARING,
Rothschild, or such, would just stick their names on it
“in addition” to the O'MULLIGAN's own. Meantime we
fear MRs,GAMP must confine herself to her own sphere,
and that the QUEEN and the women of England will for
some time remain unconvinced that they act in unwomanly
ſashion in receiving aid from, the upright, skilful, and
honourable men for whom Quackery of every kind has such
a well-founded antipathy.

An Offer to the South.
RECENT scenes in Ireland compel Mr. Punch to make a
proposal to the Americans. Will they make a swop, and
ive us the niggers in exchange for the Irish peasantry?
e’ll throw in something valuable to make the bargain a
fair one. Come, DAVIsl
A VISION AT COVENT GARDEN.
HAs MR. Gye been placing Robert the Devil upon the Covent Garden
stage with a view to the settling the Italian question?... We do not
mean the question whether Italian operas and operas in Italian can or
cannot be better given at Covent Garden than anywhere else in Europe,
because that question has been settled in the affirmative a long time
ago, and even the Parisian critics are compelled to yield reluctant assent
to the decision." But we mean the question of the resuscitation of the
Pope's .# The thought certainly occurred to us, the other
night as we gracefully lounged in our stall, and if the “waits” between
the acts were not so short at this house, we might have thought the
matter out on the spot. Let us do so here, where (his looking glass
being turned up). Mr. Punch has no vision of loveliness to distract his
eye, and where, Mrs. Punch having gone to the International to annoy
: with her crinoline, he has not to take thought for his immortal
ancle.S.
. The situation of the respected Pope Pius THE NINTH is most unques.
tionably and unmistakeably set forth in that third act, and marvellous
triumph as it is of scenic effect, its esoteric merit is even a higher virtue
in the estimation of Mr. Punch. SIR BULweR saith,
“From vulgar eyes a veil the Isis screens,
And fools on fools still ask what Hamlet means.”
No such veil interposes between Mr. Punch and the subtle mystery of
the scene, and he beholds that terrible vision of the Nuns and the
Branch with one eye on SALVIANI, and the other on the Vatican. , The
process makes him squint horribly, but a true statesman is always
ready to squint in the interests of humanity. PALMERSTON squinted a
little in the direction of Nice, and may be even now thought to have a
slight Mexican cast in his eye. Why, any stupid clown can look straight-
forward—it requires genius to see both sides of a picture at once.
Yes, MR. Gyp, grateful to Italy for the demi-gods and double-god.
desses of song whom she hath sent him, resolves to repay her by lendin
his aid to a settlement of her chief trouble; and he has placed, in suc
gorgeous guise as never was seen before, the story of the Pope's sin
and trouble before the eyes of our International audiences. Let the
foreigners, when they go back, say that a Miracle play has been got up
for them, a Mystery, like that which VICTOR Hugo describes as having
been seen on §. broad stone at Notre Dame,
Behold those massive ecclesiastical ruins (BEVERLEY, our son, your
right hand, and may it never forget its cunning), stretching far back,
the arcades, the huge windows, the still lofty tower. There is Rome.
It is moonlight, dim º: for has not her, sun set There, are
scattered the tombs, in the desecrated grave-yard. You shall see their
contents anon. Enters the Tempter. He is master of the situation, and
of all the jugglery thereof. You may think it is FoEMEs, and truly that
genial owner of the portentous voice was with us †. now, but surely
this evil presence hath more of the priestly air. That sensuous, keen,
crafty face is discharged of the tenderness that redeems Bertram from
our entire hate—Bertram was a father—this is only a Monk. Do }.
not recognise ANTONELLI? But who next?, Look, this is not Robert
the Devil, but Pius THE DUPE. He is bewildered, and he does not like
the work that is set him. He has some recollections of a Will (see
DEAN Swift and Brother Peter ...} which bids him abstain
from unhallowed pursuits. The tempter ridicules his fears, and points
to the Golden Branch. There it lies in the hand of the dead.), “Take it,”
says the evil one, “and it will give you, new power and authority,
council-doors will fly open before it, and the bravest shall be struck
down into stupor at its brandishing. Go, and take it.” The tempted
trembles. “The Will forbids me. The Golden Branch—it is not a
Golden Rose—it is a Curse.” “Take it, and use it, fool.” But he will
not. With a bitter sneer Bertrantonelli steps back, waves, his hand,
and summons his allies. The tombs yawn, the arcades whiten with
spectral forms, and a crowd, ; in procession, and performing
manner of imposing antics, suddenly surrounds Roberto. Nono. , What
does it all mean? Dead superstitions, galvanised traditions, obsolete
vows, lifeless observances, mocking homage, are resuscitated to intoxi-
cate the unfortunate dupe—and, look again—those are not ruins; you
behold the interior of St. Peter's, swaddled in grave clothes, and lit
with smouldering candles, and all the Shams are dancing and careering
around Pio IL DIAvolo. The fumes of the incense go up, and the
enchantment seizes him, and he believes that he is to go forth conquer:
"É and to conquer. He snatches the Branch, and it is, as he truly said
a Curse. Brandishing it, and with his face glowing with the madness
of his false exaltation, he waves his Branch-Pius THE DUFE stands on
high, and curses the nations of the earth who do not bow down to him

and worship him. But what is the terrible red light that, is lurking in
those cloisters? What are the hideous Things that as yet are creeping,
º: to arch and pinnacle—drop the curtain, quick. The end is
not yet.
Take the story back to Italy with you, ladies and gentlemen who have
come over to our Show. d when you have preached the sermon, do
justice to the text. Say that MEYERBEER's noble opera, which has been
in abeyance for sundry reasons for many a year (is one of them a recog-
nition of the fact that the grand scene may be something too appalling
for Anglican tastes?) has been brought out by MR. GYE with a splen;
dour of illustration worthy the stage that has given us the Prophète and
the Huguenots. Say that the magnificent, and highly coloured music,is
played and sung (you may say rendered and interpreted, if you like
slang) to perfection, and that TAMBERLIK's Robert, and FoRMEs's
Bertram are each admirable—one for its chivalry, the other for its
vigorous passion—and you may speak well, also of ladies who put out
their whole powers with a loyalty more effective and more welcome
than much frigid perfection that hath been seen. Tell everybody that
everybody who is anybody sees the Covent Garden Roberto. -
Then add (it is due to the great composer, and to the greatest singer
among us) that a second homage is done to MEYERBEER by the pro-
duction of the same opera at HER MAJESTY's Theatre. That here,
there is much to praise, and that here there is one feature on which
praise is thrown away, seeing that all hath been said thereof which
cunningly devised paragraphs can set out. Say that at HERMAJESTY's
Theatre TITIENs holds the part of Alice. §. will scarcely find an
auditor to whom it is needful to say more. But should you meet such
an one, add that those who desire to see and hear an Alice, should go to
the Haymarket Qpera-house, while those who wish to witness and appre-
ciate the opera of Robert the Devil must go to Covent Garden. It might
not be unwise to imitate the first bishop of Bath and Wells, a Scot,
whose traditional answer to the KING's inquiry which of those cities he
would have for a see was so broad a reading of the first name that the
KING thought he wanted—and gave him—hauth.
Mr. Punch is instigated to add, that should the Pope's perusal of
these remarks (Punch is always translated to him by his Cross-bearer)
induce him to wish to go to Covent Garden, he must telegraph to the
box office under the Portico in Bow Street—the management cannot be
answerable for any mistake that may arise by people's º, misled
into the traps of touts. Inſallibility will please to copy the address.

that a gentleman named

as a defaulter to the
Champion Race Fund
at Brisbane, which is

which is in Australia.
MR. WARRy ought to
have paid £25, and, ac-
cording to the Stewards
of the North Australian
Jockey Club, did not
# it. They advertise
little failing, and im-
mediately under theirad-
vertisement comes this
notification from him:
THE LATE CHAMPION RACE FUND.
MR: T. S. WARRY presents his ºl. to the Editor of the Courier, in
which paper he observes himself mentioned as being a defaulter to the late Champion Race
Fund. In reply to this, he begs to state that if any Stewards or Members of the North Australian
Jockey Club will call '. him, entering by his back gate, they can have a repast with his servants,
and after refreshing themselves, if appearing sober and respectable, they will be allowed an
interview with him, in his private room set apart exclusively for the reception of gentlemen.
We hardly know whether this is an implied promise to pay, but MR. WARRY's
hospitality is unimpeachable, and if his conditions seem a little stringent it must
be remembered that Australia is a new country where there are a good many roughs,
and everybody connected with the turf is not the honest, sober, elegant gentleman,
known as the English turf-man. But the kindness of spirit, which, in answer to
a cruel insult, invites the insulter to a banquet, is truly delightful, and shows that
the bishops whom we export do their duty by the colonies.

A SLAP AT A SCHOOLMISTRESS.
MY DEAR MRs. SMITH,
You well know how tenderly I love the tender sex. All, whether plain
or pretty, young or—or middle-aged, rich or the reverse, all ladies, as you know,
are, ever held in reverence by their devoted Punch. But if I might venture to
particularise, and say what kind of woman chiefly my fond heart is prone to dote
# might, to §. you some idea of her, refer you to the following, which I
found inserted lately in the Times:–
LAP. &c.—WANTED, in a first-class establishment, a LADY, who is addicted
to authorship and strictly elegant literature. She would be required to undertake the depart-
ment of English composition, and combine if §: a keen analytical judgment and talent with
the creative and poetic faculty. Any lady of brilliant intellect and genius would meet with every
thoughtful consideration and kindness. Also Two Foreigners, to
teach German and French—one a thorough musician and vocalist,
the other to speak French always and remain with the pupils after
class. Required, also, an educated English Lady, from 20 to 25 years
of age, who would give her services in exchange for the accomplish-
ments.-Address, &c.
. Now, a lady who can pen such an advertisement as this,
is just the sort of person I am most charmed to meet.
You see, I take it quite for granted that the writer, is a
lady. , I feel certain that no gentleman would ever have
the cheek. (you will pardon my vulgarity) to address him-
self in this way, to an “educated lady,” even though it
were her evil luck to be a governess. #. you will notice
the advertisement says nothing about pay; and for aught
shown to the contrary, the “lady, &c.,” is required to
“undertake the department of English composition,” or,
in plainer words, to do the drudgery of teaching grammar
in a girls' school, without getting a farthing to reward
her for her services. If she happen indeed to have a “bril.
liant intellect and genius, she is promised kindly treatment
and thoughtful consideration.”. But of pecuniary con-
sideration no prospect is put forth : and the chances are
that if she find her board and lodging given her, she wi
have most probably to pay for her own washing and perhaps
make her own bed.
But setting pay aside, I should say that any lady
“addicted to authorship” would hardly find a girls'
school a fit place for pursuing it; and whatever be her skill
in “strictly elegant literature,” I apprehend that the place
offered her would not º her much scope for it. Young
ladies when at school but seldom learn more, composition
than enables them to write a sentimental slip-slop love-
letter; and considering the minds with which she has to
deal, i think the post of governess, even in an establish-
ment reputed as first-class, can scarce require."keen analy-
tical judgment,” or very much of the “creative and poetic
faculty.” The latter gift indeed might serve to help her
pupils at the season of Saint, Valentine, but further than
this it would, I fear, be found of little use to them.
As it has never been my fortune, to reside in a young
ladies’ school, Iknow not what are “the accomplishments.”
which may be there had in exchange for the service of a
Governess. But I should recommend young ladies, before
signing any paper of agreement to such barter, to make
quite sure that board and lodging would at least be guaran-
feed to them, Strictly elegant literature is a good thing in
its way, but beef and bread and butter are to most girls
quite as necessary; and Ifancy at a school-I beg pardon,
an “establishment”—where so much care and attention
is bestowed upon the former, it is just possible that the
latter may slightly be neglected. .
I remain, dear MRs. SMITH, with “every thoughtful
consideration,” - - -
Your Sex's ever faithful friend and ready champion,

CHARIVARI. [July 12, 1863.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
VERY SUGGESTIVE.
FACETIous TRAVELLER. “Can't find a Seat, Sir?—Well, that is provoking/
Luggage Van."
PUBLIC WEHICLES AND THEIR WICTIMS.
QNE of the most curious and entertaining sights at the Industrial
Exhibition is the exhibition of industry displayed by visitors who are
leaving, in their eager chace and chevy for an omnibus or cab. Of
course months and months ago º, was aware the World was
coming to its Show, and doubtless everybody fancied ample means
would be provided for the World to get there. The newspapers kept
telling us how vastly railways had been multiplied since 1851, and what
millions more of ſº they could now daily bring to town: and
everybody fancied that a similar development extended to the means of
transit through the streets. Some ten thousand extra 'busses and
twenty, thousand cabs were supposed to have been ordered for the
World's accommodation: and in short it was imagined that no pains
would be spared to bring the World to Brompton and to take the
World, away again with the utmost ease and comfort, safety and
dispatch.
How thoroughly these sanguine expectations have been realised, by
this time all the world is pretty ...? aware. From statistics he has
carefully collected on the subject, Mr. Punch can state with confidence
that for the World to ride in there have recently been added to our
ublic vehicles no fewer than four omnibuses and as many as six cabs.
he consequence has been that the Industrial Exhibition and the neigh-
bourhood adjacent have lately been the scene of industry unparalleled,
in the exertions made by visitors to get a homeward ride. Difficult as
it is just now to capture a cab anywhere, to pick one up near Brompton
between four and eight p.m. is a feat demanding such, great patience,
strength, skill, quickness and agility, that one had well-nigh be a JoB,
a SAMson, and a LeoTARD, successfully to do it. For every cab that
comes in sight there are at least a .. of hundred eager eyes on the
look out, and a hundred pairs of legs perform a simultaneous rush, while
a couple of hundred hands are all outstretched to clutch the prize.
As for getting home by omnibus, the only plan to do so appears to be
to walk about as far as Hyde Park Corner, and then to jump into an
omnibus that will take you back to Brompton: on reaching which you
Tell you what, Sir; get yourself Labelled, and they'll put you in the
simply pay for your ride thither, and then retain, your seat, and pay
another fourpence, or more probably a shilling, for the homeward journey
to King's Cross, or the Bank: . The omnibus proprietors thus pouch a
double fare; and this is possibly a reason why they have abstained from
putting on more extra carriages this season: another reason being the
unwillingness they show on every possible occasion to do anything
whatever for the comfort of the public.
Not of the Best Brand.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 7th. LoRD RUssell had to vindicate the Italian
Government once more from the splenetic charges made by * LORD
Normanby, whose wrath has been roused anew, probab {: by the
announcement that Russia and Prussia would recognise Italy. Of
course the answer was complete and satisfactory. LQRD HARROWBY
had recently been in Italy, and declared himself. “astonished” at LoRD
NorMANBy’s “ignorance” of the real state of things in that country.
This was a hard hit, for poor NoFMANBy of course gets no end, of
voluminous and violent notes from old foreign countesses and the like,
who consider the expulsion of the despots the wickedest thing ever done,
and he rather piques himself on being kept well posted up by the angry
old ſribbles who prompt him. The Lords laughed.
. The Commons had another Embankment Debate, and then arose a
dispute as to the clause which enacts that the architecture of the buildings
that are to be erected on the banks of the river shall be approved by a
Minister. MR. CowPER contended that it was for the honour of Lon-
don that such erections should not be left to individual caprice.
LoRD PALMERSTON took, of course, the same view, and paid an exceed-
ingly high compliment to the architecture of the Regent's Park, where
private dwellings had been combined by MR. NASH, so as to make the
union resemble a single palatial iii. We should like to have
heard MR. DisRAELI hereon—is it not in Popanilla that he has some-
thing to say upon the difference between Architecture and Parkitecture?
There is no doubt, however, that the Regent's Park is one of the most
creditable looking quarters in London, and from what Mr. Punch has
seen of the inhabitants of the district, he has the highest opinion of
their civilisation. The clause was resisted but carried by 162 to 145.
There was a snarl raised against the Templars, which they certainly do
not deserve, for they have not imitated the BuccLEUCH party in resist-
ing the Bill, though the Embankment will destroy much of the charm of
their beautiful gardens, which i. moreover they throw open in the
most liberal manner to the children of the poor. , The Committee saw
this, and by 139 to 18 put down MR. AYRTON, who sought to insert a
needless, and rather impertinent proviso. The discussion wound up
º with a very angry little row between SIR John SHELLEY and
MR. CowPER.
But this was only a pop-gun compared to what followed. There
came a Fortifications Debate, which was proceeding with much dulness
of detail, when MR. Cobden rose, and delivered a speech in which he
attacked LoRD PALMERSTON for incessantly mis-representing the
French Emperor as a bellicose personage. MR. CoBDEN adduced a
great lot of figures to show that the French had never armed, on the
scale supposed, and repeated that he proposed to “arraign” the
PREMIER, whom he also charged with knocking people down with Latin
uotations. SIR John PAKINGTON interposed a brief defence of LORD
ALMERSTON, and pointed out the unfairness of some of MR. CoBDEN's
arguments, and then the arraigned PREMIER went to work on his own
account, declared himself proud of being attacked by MR. CQBDEN,
who never had an idea that England ought to be defended, who was
in a state of blindness and delusion on that subject, who understood
Free Trade, but that was his Last, to which he ought to Stick, for
when he went beyond it, he went into matters which he could not
understand. PAM also quoted Latin again, as became an Oxford D.C.L.;
and pointed out the awful cost of the War in America, on account of
the nation not having been prepared for such operations. He ended by
saying that if we had put the country, economically, into a, state of
defence, we had achieved even a better thing than MR. CoRDEN's
Treaty of Paris. . It may be imagined that this ...; method of
laying on the lash was not calculated to º the flagellated party,
and the next morning MR. CopDEN’s organ declared that LoRD PAM
had opened an impassable gulf between himself and CoBDEN, that he was
a flagrant offender against the moralities of debate, and an outrager of
Parliamentary decencies. We immediately sent, down to Cambridge
House to know how the PREMIER felt, and were delighted to hear that
the article had not spoiled his breakfast.
Tuesday. The Commons to the rescue of the Commonſ, SIR THOMAs
WILSON is at it again. A Bill has been introduced into the Lords for
enabling him to grant long building leases on Hampstead Heath. The

lawyers support it, of course. Mr. Punch need only tell the Commons
to be ready to scrunch the measure; but he will add that menace, is
now being used, and the advocates of the Bill threaten that when SIR
Thomas W. is himself enclosed, his successor will build all over
the heath, unless we now allow SIR THOMAs, to erect villas, which will
be valuable on account of the waste being kept open. Sufficient. for
the day is the Wilson thereof—we trust to write, in due course—“the
Bill for stealing the Heath from the people was then rejected.”
The Code Caledonian was read a second time in the Lords, who
seemed delighted to be told, that it had been so carefully prepared that
they need not waste their valuable time in reconsidering it.
Iond PALMerston said that Russia had recognised Italy, but that
he had no official information on the subject from Turin. There is a
motion abroad in the world that this recognition is a clever moye on the
part of our friend CHARLEs the Elºv ENTII, of France. Itussia will be
leased to be friends with Italy, if Italy will undertake not to extend
|...} in any way that may be disagreeable to her neighbours. GARI:
BAIDI has just made a fiery speech, in which he declares that the Despot
of France is no friend of Italy. The Ultramontanists of France are too
angry at Italy's being spoken to at all to heed any of these under-
currents, and they denounce Russia in choice priestly Billingsgate-
showing that the successors of the Fishermen talk the language of
fishwomen. -
It may be convenint to the public to know, that we are going to
have another Chinese War, large or small. If we are to carry on trade
at all with China it is necessary to defend certain points against the
marauding savages called Tae-pings. And this we are certainly going
to do, or to help the Imperialists to do. The whole business is a dis-
agreeable one. The Taepings are cruel miscreants, but the Imperialists
are also atrociously cruel, and the things that are done on both sides
make the blood curdle. But Commerce must be lº, There was
an interesting debate raised by M.R. WHITE, in which Colon EL SYKES,
and of course MR. Coppºs, took up arms against the Governments of
England and China, and MR. LAYAiud made an animated onslaught upon
the Taepings, and a clever defence of the policy now announced. Lond
PALMERSTON ingeniously retorted on those who said that our former
wars with China had weakened its Government, that if so, we were the
more bound to support it now. M.R. WALPole would not support M.R.
WHITE, but declined to support a war policy. The Government was
sustained by 197 to 88.
In revenge a good bit of rough justice was done. Government fenced
very objectionably with the Kerteh Prize Money question, and SIR
John |. compelled them to assent to what was really a vote of
censure upon their conduct in keeping the soldiers out of their money.
LoRD PALMERSTON tried to fight, but was put down by an honest
shout of creditable impatience, at any further resistance being offered
to a just claim.
The Dissenters are not at present to do as they like with the Church
Yards. SIR Monto.N PETo buried his Burials Bill.
Jednesday. The little Bill for allowing a clergyman to get out of the
Church if he wished to take up some other vocation, was never very
healthy, and to-day it was put out of its unsatisfactory existence by a
majority of 98 to SS. M.R. NEw DEGATE then had to give up his attempt
to deal with the Church Rate Question, and MR. Wh ALLEY had a vic-
tory over M.R. HENN Essy, the latter's Bill for facilitating the Introduc-
tion of Catholic priests into gaols, being rejected. MR. ForstER's
Becr Bill occasioned some smartish discussion—some Members treating
it as a boon to morality, others as an interference with the poorer
classes, but the former view triumphed by a majority of 3 in a House
of 183. The Bill, it will be remembered is to prevent people from
getting beer on tick.
Thursday. PAM said that Russia had not, he believed, imposed con-
ditions and restrictions on the KING or ITALY, but that satisfactory
explanations of policy had been given. Ha! Your finger on your nose,
thus. Ha! Exactly.
There was then another Fortifications Debate. MR. Osbor NE said
some smart things at considerable length, and was told by Lord PAL-
MERSTON that such talk was just the thing for a club or a dinner table,
but was not the thing for the House of Commons. MR. CoBDEN,
whose exacerbation was increased by the news that his American friends
had not only been beaten at Charleston, but had run away with great
velocity from the Confederates at Richmond, delivered another speech
in abuse of LoRD PALMERstos, who told him in return that he was an
ill-conditioned party—that a gentleman who was attacked tried “to
give as good as he got ” and then went home and thought no more
about it, but that CopDEN sulked. This was so English and true that
the IIouse cheered heartily, and the Government got 110 to 62 on
division. There was some more discussion on the Embankment Bili,
and a clause was inserted preventing steam engines from running on
the new road. -
What passed on Friday night Mr. Punch will mention next week, for
the fact is he went down to the Prize. Giving at the International
Exhibition, and got so fearfully intoxicated with delight at the
Honourable Mention that was made of himself in every direction, that
he had to be removed to his house, at a late hour, under the guidance
of X 555, whom he hereby thanks for his attentions, though he regrets
that the intelligent officer pulled him away from the lamp post in
Grosvenor Place before he had half done explaining the currency ques-
tion, the true principles of cosmogony, and the beauties of BABBAGE's
inaCIllne.
GRAND AMERICAN PUZZLE.
THE Americans say that they have not only taught the wretched Old
World how to make War, but that they propose to teach us new prin-
ciples of Arithmetic. We shall be very glad to receive some elementary
instruction upon the subject, for we are in an awful puzzle already.
There haye been, as readers of the papers are well aware, a variety of
great and small battles (if anything American can be small) during the
war which is not exactly over. #. Punch, with reverent observance,
took, week by week, a note of those battles, and with the most confiding
and implicit faith in the accuracy of the New York press, affixed to
each glorious name the number, as given by that noble institution, of
the heroic and devoted soldiers of the Republic who fell in each cn:
counter. In order to explain his difficulty, he must reproduce the roll
of glory, with the numbers signifying the losses:–

We are utterly unable to bring our addition to the same result as

SACRILEGE AT NETLEY ABBEY.
S__you are aware, Mr. Punch,
Netley Abbey has been said by
incorrigible offenders to be so
named because it was overrun
with nettles. Now, however,
both those and all the other
weeds by which the ruins were
choked, have been removed; the
ivy, and wildflowers, and bram-
bles, trees, and shrubs, which
adorn them, only being left to
remain. The place has been
cleared, and cleaned without
having been Cockneyfied; it has
been furnished with convenient
and inconspicuous seats, and
rendered permeable throughout,
and provided with a pump which
supplies water for tea, or grog,
refreshments for which right-
minded people, though, would
repair to the contiguous public-
house. At the entrance of the
Abbey is a porter's lodge, where
a turnstile lets the public in at
the small charge of 2d. a head,
which goes to pay the expense of
putting and keeping the place
in order, and would, it might be
hoped, exclude the rabble, the
riffraff, the tag-rag-and bobtail,
the cads, the blackguards, the
swell-mob, and the spoiler.
“Thieves, however, Mr. Punch,
do nevertheless find their way
through the turnstile at Netley
Abbey. The removal of the
- rubbish out of the Lady Chapel,
disclosed a piece of encaustic tile pavement, near the site of the altar, of which
several pieces have been stolen by some robbers who had procured admission in
the disguise of respectable-looking people. These bits of ancient pottery have
oubtless been taken and carried away to serve as specimens. The rascals who
steal such things are not ordinary thieves; depredations of that kind are notoriously
committed by antiquaries, a class of learned gentlemen too many of whom are
regardless of the rights of any property whence they can pilfer an addition to
their collections, ºf in that case do not stick at sacrilege. The truth is that your
mere antiquary is a person whose acquisitiveness just takes the turn of affecting
relics of the past instead of contemporary watches and pocket-handkerchiefs.
Such a fellow covets and desires other men's goods, if those goods are antiquities,
and when encaustic tiles and things of that sort come in his way; he cannot keep
his hands from picking and stealing. -
“Now, º not an officer of the Hampshire constabulary be appointed to
perambulate and protect the remains of Netley Abbey? A pºliceman-in plain
clothes—among the ruins would not be more incongruous with them than you-
or any other man. It would be a gratifying spectacle to behold some learned
F. S. A. caught with a piece of the Abbey in his pocket, collard, walked off to
the bench, summarily sentenced to a º hard labour, and finally working in
a copious perspiration at the crank. - - - - -
“It is devoutly to be wished that the same degrading and afflictive punishment
could be inflicted, instead of any fine, on the gents and snobs who still get into
the Abbey in spite of the turnstile, and cut their insignificant names out on, its
venerable walls. A course of discipline at the House of Correction is required to
put down the offence of defacing public buildings, and ought to be mercilessly
inflicted on every fool who records his worthless existence on any object of the
kind, except perhaps the London Statues. It is with great disgust that I fre-
quently notice among these vile inscriptions that of a name under which, in the
capacity of a pedestrian tourist, I subscribe myself,
“Your humble servant,
“WALKER.”
REPUDIATION IN DOWNING STREET.
WE have for a long time been criticising the repudiation of brother JonATHAN,
if furious Jonathan will still allow us to call him brother; but whilst crying out
on the beam in brother JonATHAN's eye we seem to have been unconscious of a
certain mote in our own. We even live under a repudiating Government. What
but repudiation...was the attempt of the Treasury to evade the ſº of the
Kertel and Yenikale Prize Money, and what else does the delaye distribution of
that due to the victors of Delhi amount to? Our Government repudiates the
debts which it owes to its most deserving creditors, our heroic soldiers and
sailors. This bad faith, as the House of Commons calls it, is surely calculated to
depreciate the value of our public securities, and, if persisted in, must produce a
al' in Consols.

Too strong in shooting and in sight
Was Scotland yet to yield the field,
Her noblest shots are here;
Men who to miss were seldom known,
Brave, Ross, the far-famed champion,
And Deathsman of the Deer:
There MUIR and Moir their rifles raised
H. Ross the trigger pressed, and blazed
And ANDERSON, who ne'er looked dazed,
A hundred made, or near :
With FERGusson of marksmen best
Where Tom na Heurich rears his crest;
And Loyal's Master stood confessed
His rivals’ worthy peer:
And PETERKIN to victory pressed,
A graceful soldier, neatly dressed,
Although his name is queer.
But calmly England stood, and shot,
And sternly snuffed out every Scot
Who tried the desperate game,
For HALFORD sent the fatal lead,
And HEATON put his foes to bed,
And HALLIDAY unceasing sped
His balls with matchless aim.
Lord DUCIE shot, by all admired,
LORD BURY raised his arm untired,
And BEASLEY’s eye was true,
Brave SMITH upon the target broke
Ball after ball with lightning stroke,
And Wimbledon's old echos woke
As Rowe's swift missiles flew.
And when the umpires reckoned o'er
Scotland's and England's well-made score,
Hurrah for England then
The North had but Seven twenty-four,
The South upon her banners bore
Nine hundred, all but tem.
Woe to a foe who dares our shore,
When, side by side, those rivals pour
On horses, uns, and men,
Such bolts of fire as those that tore
The air in Surrey's glen.
ESSAYS AND REMARKS.
Boots.--To get good boots, the best plan, perhaps,
would be to find out who makes those of PROFEssoft
FARADAY, or PROFEssoR Owen, and employ him, if there
is any such particular person; for a philosopher should be
the best judge of the fitness of things, including boots. But
there may be no such person; for many philosophers are
accustomed to buy their boots ready made; true philosophy
seeking to discover, by the shortest process, where the shoe
pinches, and rejecting that shoe or boot for another which
does not º
Durability of boots, is a quality undervalued by inex-
perienced, or unwise dandies, because they never half test
it. No new boot is so comfortable as an old one in sound
condition. , Old boots are like intimate old friends, and
hand-and-glove is not more the symbol of intimacy than
foot-and-boot. Never, if you are undesirous of corns and
bunions, discard well-worn boots whilst their upper leathers
are whole. The EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, and the chiefs
of the British nobility would never have had occasion to
attest the skill of EisenBERG, if they had always made a
point of having their boots forepieced and heelpieced, and
soled, and otherwise mended, so long as they would hold
comfortably together. It is remarkable that the names
assigned to different kinds of boots are mostly those of
K. or soldiers, as Coburgs, Bluchers, Wellingtons, and
Napoleons. The resent fashionable ºtharnus of ladies is
called a Balmoral. But no boots are ever named after
men of eminence in science and letters; there are no Macau.
lay boots, no Brunels, no Stephensons, no Liebigs, no
3rownings, no Tennysons. Perhaps it is the confined idea
of nobleness and distinction, thus evinced by some leading
shoemakers, which has earned for their respectable and
useful fraternity the too sweeping denomination of Snobs.

A POETICAL PETITION.
JUST before it rose, one of the French Chambers had to receive a
report upon a new kind of Petition that had been º to it. A
certain M.LEQN WALMy had something to ask of the legislature, and,
dissatisfied with the ordinary prosaic form of appeal, }. his petition
into Poetry. . It was referred to a committee to say whether this sort
of thing was to be tolerated, and the Committee, which must be sweetly
sentimental, reported, through M. DE ST.GERMAIN, that the petition
was of a novel kind “but not inadmissible.”
This is well, and though we are sadly afraid that MR. DENIson
would proceed somewhat more harshly than M. DE ST, GERMAIN,
we should like to see our own House of Commons addressed in Poetry.
How would a Petition, in verse, look? It would be necessary to pre-

W. us a “sensation; ”
You ſight with foes, 'ginst brothers tre
The dogs of war unbridle,
When your finance is reckless, ours
Is right down sooicidal.
Unlike thc Old World states of whom

We fust to spite our foemen dared
To cut off our own noses:
We fust escaped the ups and downs
In Old World wars regretted,
By always havin' our defeats
As victories gazetted.
We fust, when debt forced to contract,
Exulted in its figger:
And liked our ministers the more
The more they made it bigger:
And, pride of prides, we were the ſust
That tried repudiation—
A principle susceptible
Of wider application.
NApoleoN had some idee
Of florid bulletinin',
But that pint in the art of war
We’ve beat the gin'ral clean in.
We ſust in fame as in finance
True valley gave to vapour,
And when big deeds and coin ran short,
Paid in big words and paper.
So here we sits, and spits, sublime,
On auguries of disaster:

But we have King Shinplaster.
For all King Cotton's works and ways,

Our trust is in our righteous cause,
Our prayer, “So help us, Bunkum!”

EAR MR., PUNCH,-I feel, at least I
hope, I do not ‘transgress the bounds
of feminine propriety’ by bringing
under your notice an offence against
good manners, which, I am sorry to
say is but too common among several
of my (shall I confess it?) admired
countrymen, more especially that
delightful race of young gentlemen,
who frequent our fashionable prome-
nades in all the glory of the realisation
of the fondest dreams of tailors,
hatters, and gautiers, who wear an
eye-glass, through which they endea-
vour to look their “killingest,’ and
who occasionally indulge in a cigar,
most elegantly held between the
fingers of an exquisitely gloved hand.
I wish you to understand, dcar Mr.
Punch, I am not one of those fasti-
dious young ladies who pretend to be
pºisoned by inhaling the scent of a
fragrant weed;’ on the contrary, I
would not deny to any gentleman of my acquaintance any pleasure he
may Pºiº erive from filling his mouth with smoke when he pleases
—no! ‘Quand on n’a pas ce que l’on aime, il faut aimer ce que Pon d’—
it is not this habit which raises my indignation—it is—that, not content
with expelling the smoke from their mouths, they also expel the salira,
which they tell me is increased by the act of smoking, and that, regard-
less of place, and the necessary length of ladies' dresses—this often too
in our public promenades and most fashionable out-door resorts | | |
Were I speaking, dear Mr. Punch, to any other gentlemanthan yourself,
I should expect a sarcastic question relative to the length of my last
new dress, &c., but I have no such fear in addressing you—in telling
you of this grievance.
“They tell me the evil is most apparent in our great thoroughfares-
no doubt others are to blame, besides that particular portion of the
human genus I have mentioned; but it is by their example that the
evil must be remedied. Will they not oblige us for the future by stepping
on the kerb before relieving their overcharged nerves”. By so doing they
will lay the axe to the root of what has become a public nuisance felt
not more severely by any one than by
“Your very sincere friend,

ART FOR THE MILLION.
... WE understand that a celebrated modern sculptor, perceiving the
interest excited amongst the visitors to the International Exhibition by
PIETRo_MAGNI's “Girl Reading,” will shortly open to the public a
series of models and marble statuettes, in which he has endeavoured to
render the usual subjects of the sculptor's art in a more modern and
less conventional manner than usual. We have been favoured with a
private view, and may mention the following as especially worthy, of
notice. Instead of a “ \!. Preparing to Bathe,” we have “A
Maid of All Work Cleaning Herself;” a delightfully homely domestic
subject, which the artist has treated with the utmost felicity. We
would especially call the attention of the critical, spectator to the
expression of the girl's face, where we see blended pleasure, caused
by the needſul ablution, and pain, the effect of friction with a huckaback
towel, the texture of which, admirably represented by the chisel, is
worthy of the closest attention, as is also the soap and soap-dish.
“The Death of Agamemnon” is vividly, depicted in a plaster, group,
where the ill-fated hero is represented struggling under a shirt which
the washerwoman has sent |. buttoned at the neck and wrists.
“A Child at the Bath, Saturday Night,” marble statuette, is another
subject which will go to the heart of all mothers, and is rendered in so
life-like a manner, that we could ulmost affirm the contortion of the
child's face was caused by the intrusion of a minute particle of soap
beneath the eyelid, producing, as we can vouch from personal experience,
excruciating agony.
THE ROSE OF LANKESTER.
MR. PUNCH having pronounced for DR. LANKESTER, it is needless
to state that there ...?be but one issue to the conflict. The tremen-
dous denland for the number of Punch in which his opinion as to the
candidates was given prevented his being in the hands of all the free-
holders, but DR. LANKESTER having stated from the hustings that Mr.
Punch was with him, the contest was virtually at an end, and the frantic
and hysteric exertions of the attorney-party were ludicrous rather than
formidable. Mr. Punch attended in Portland Place to see the Doctor
swear, and is happy to state that he swore very audibly from the parch-
ments elegantly presented by MR, SHERIFF Twenty MAN, and that MR.
Lewis, in the noblest manner, afforded the new coroner his first case,
for MR. Lewis himself was most decidedly Sat Upon.
CountER-ATTRACTIONs.-For the gentlemen, they consist of good
articles, moderate prices, and pretty girls; and for the ladies, the counter:
attractions consist of “Enormous Failures!” “Alarming Sacrifices!”
“Fearful Bankruptcies!”, “Awful Bargains l’ and big-whiskered
shopmen, who have no right to be there at all, doing women’s work.

that
Stu -
º: charity in question is the Dramatic College: a college which º the added
epithet of Royal, it being under the especial patronage of HER MAJESTY THE
QUEEN, In her happier days, HER MAJESTY has ever been a lover and a patron
of the drama, and her people have to thank her much for her judicious patronage,
which has served so well to purify and elevate the Stage. Now, it is a fact, not
unknown to Mr. Punch as well as other great philosophers, that actors, if they
live, grow old like other people; and are not more free than other people are from
the ills, and chills, and bills, to which all human, flesh is heir...It is therefore to
assist them in their sickness and their age that this Dramatic Charity has been set
on foot. There are tragedies in, private life as well as on the Stage, and many, a
tragedian has cause to carry to his home the sad and mournful bearing which he
that never got his fill of fighting. So it is well that a Dra-
matic refuge should exist, where, when youth and health
and strength begin to fail, the needy actor may at ease play
out the great drama of life, and, until the curtain drops on
the last scene of all, be fostered and maintained in honour-
able comfort.
This being the aim of the Royal Dramatic College, it is
çnough for l/r. Punch to add that rooms are now complete
for receiving twenty pensioners: and it remains for cha-
ritable people to determine how many a score more they
wish to put on the Free List.

meeting will be graced by the presence of Aunt Sally and
other fashiºnable members of the fairer sex. In fact it will

at shopkeeping is alone a tempting sight: and, who can
grudge to pay a guinea for a sixpenny wax doll, if it be
bought of a Queen Catherine or a Lady Macbeth & More-

supported: ſor actors after all are the servants of the public,

SOCIAL SCIENCE CONGRESS.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“WHEN IORD BROUGHAM, lately presiding over the Social
Economy Department at Guildhall, invited me and other gentlemen pre-
sent to speak, Iconfess that I felt ashamed to remain silent...I had come
Fº with an elaborate Paper on the Employment of Women, and
ully intended when opportunity offered to stand and deliver. I am not
a very nervous orator. I have held some few briefs in petty larceny
cases at Quarter Sessions; and though my clients have all been fellows
of most villanous aspect, you would have been affected by their grateſul
humility, when to their astonishment they were pronounced not guilty
by a ſat Jury of small Farmers–a result I was told, and am strongly
inclined to believe, entirely owing to my ingenious rhetoric, I never
contemplated, however, addressing a Jury of Ladies. Indeed, it strikes
me that if a Baroness instead of a Baron of the Exchequer sat to try
causes at Nisi Prius before a special Jury composed of £50 governesses,
those whom legal etiquette condemned to wear stuff gowns, would look
remarkably small before those who º dresses of a more costly
material. Had not my self-possession failed me when taunted by LoRi,
BROUGHAM, I should have shown his Lordship and his fair audience
that one very important phase of the question had entirely escaped
everybody's attention. Let me explain:
“Notwithstanding her taste for medicine, I have no hesitation in
asserting that woman's forte is turning in general!. When we say in a
#. *. metaphor, that she can turn a husband round her little
nger, her position is at once recognised at the lathe (so, to speak) of
connubial diplomacy. Now if Woman be giſted with this wonderful
power of turning opinions, and shaping ends, agreeably to her own
charming designs, why should her country not derive some benefit from
the cold chisel which nature has so kindly placed in her cunning hand?
Could not a treaty of Commerce be carried out by that discrimination
and tact we as juvenile recipients have so much admired at a treat of
cherries? Would she who has achieved such triumphs over the wool
of Berlin, be worsted in a Congress at Wienna? Who so fitted to hold
out the olive branch of Peace? If we must mediate between North
and South, why should not the acknowledged Sisters of Mercy step
between the angry American Brothers, and gently bid them drop their
vengeful steel?
“To sum up, I would not close a single avenue now open to female
talent and industry; but I would certainly allow them free access to
that dark tunnel ugh which secret service money is popularly sup-
posed to be conveyed. , Our Ambassadors should be at once recalled,
and their places taken by chaperons of distinguished ability...I am sure
that LORD DERBy would be highly gratified at so economical an ar-
rangement, and the Tories, who have been so suddenly smitten by a
wholesome horror of extrayagance, would hail with gallant joy, a corps
diplomatique, whose appointment is desirable, whether regarded as a
question of finesse or finance.
“Yours ever,
“Leopard's Inn.” “AMICUs HUMANI GENERIs.”
DINNER PLATITUDES.
Twice of soup is vulgar, but three times of soup implies that you
must be more than double-plated with vulgarity. Such a thing was
never known, not even at the Trinity Board, and Turtle is not the
slightest excuse for your pushing things to such a vulgar length. An
Alderman would really blush for you. - - - - -
A soft answer turneth away wrath, and an invitation to take a glass
of wine will frequently restore warmth between two friends where only
coldness existed before. - -
No matter how plain your cook may be, so long as your dinner is

A few compliments go a great way. A little savoury páté is quite
enough. Try too many, and you’ll find they'll prove heavy.
When the ladies retire from the dinner-table, it is not usual for you
(supposing you to be a gentleman) to retire with them. In this in-
stance, the same law extends to the mistress as to the servants:—“No
Follow ERs ALLowed.”
A gratuity well bestowed frequently has a happy effect. The servant
that is fee’d well takes care that his master does the same.
In the hands of an inferior artiste, whether an omelette turns out

HYMN TO APOLLO.
On a late Sunless day.
PHOEBUs APOLLO, surely thou hast driven
Thy fiery steeds beneath the Western wave,
Never to climb the vault of Heaven;
Thou hast put up at Neptune's palace-cave;
Thy team is stalled with horses of the sea,
º thou, reclined upon a coral throne
Drainest the bowl j Nereids fill for thee,
Therefore from us the light of day hath flown.
There thou and old Poseidon lie and tope,
Smoking sea-weeds, Havannas of the deep,
We rural swains, meanwhile, are losing hope
Of crops which we require thine aid to reap.
Drink up thy liquors, beer or sparkling wine
Or grog, that Ocean brews thee, Lord of Day,
Cast thy cigar upon the foaming brine,
That Æolus may blow our clouds away.
To thee the Sea Nymphs, as thoutwang'st thy lyre,
To thee the Sirens, joined in chorus, sing,
Whilst here we are obliged to have a fire.
Winter returning on the close of Spring.
Oh! if asleep in Amphitrite's bed, , , , .
Soon may old Triton wake thee with his horn,
Or Ceres will deplore her fields o'erspread
With white for yellow; snow instead of corn.
MRS. HARRIS A RADICAL.
OUR excellent friend, Mrs. Harris, was taking great credit to herself
the other day for not writing in the old hack Tory way, and for suitin
her utterances to the enlightenment and liberality of the . “Which
what I says, M'm,” writes Mrs. Harris, “is this, and, what I says I
stands to, Mºm, for I never denyges my declivities which is Tory, M'm,
but young folks is young ſolks, and won't be no wiser till they ceases
to be such, whereby blow thc babble and save the Party, M'm, is my
motter.” We cordially congratulate the old lady on her advanced
#º. but we think that like all converts, she is inclined to go a
ittle too far. Punch may have had to complain of the conduct of
certain aristocrats, but he never branded the “distinguished world,”
en masse, with lunacy. This is what the radical Mrs. Harris now, docs.
Here is her account of the attendance at the International on a day at
the close of June:—º-
“The numbers yesterday were 26,849, of whom 5,721 entered by season tickets.
Among the distinguished visitors were the WICERoy of Egypt, who remained until an
advanced hour of the afternoon, LoBD and LADY Fol.EY, the Hon. CHARLEs MURRAY,
and a party of Hungarians, who evidently enjoyed the brilliant scene that expanded
before them as they entered. Another party of lunatics, from DR. ARMSTRoNG's,
Peckham House Asylum, were yesterday enabled to see the Exhibition by the
kindness of the gentleman under whose charge they are, and we have to
notice with satisfaction that the poor creatures bore themselves with the utmost
quietness of demeanour."
CRINOLINE FOR CLOWNS.
“MR. PUNCH,
- “HERE's a good 'un. This here advertismunt, as apeerd
in the Marnun Pucooast t'other day. I’ve coppied un word for word,
'cept the neam, 'cause as how I dwoan't want to puff the fellcr:—
OBSON'S PATENT CROWN CRINOLINES.—“MESSRS. Hobson's
Skirts, manufactured under HER MAJESTY's Royal Letters Patent, are pro-
nounced the lightest and the best in the world; and are worn by all the leading
circles of society in Paris, London, and America.”—London and Paris Magazine of
Fashion, January. To be had of all first-class drapers.
“Strikes me there be two or dree pints in this here notusification as
is wuth your 'tension. In the fust pleace, Crown Crinolines. What
be they Crinolines at five shilluns a piece? I dwoan't know whether
or no that’s reckoned cheap; but I calls um dear at any money. Or
do’t mean that these here crinolines is wore by the Crown? Tºo all
I can zay is the moor's the pity, and if so be as how the Crown ood
º plazed to lave um off, what a good example the Crown
zct the female subject
“Next we betold as how these here Crown Crinolines is ‘pronounced
the lightest and the best in the world.” What’s the sense o’ that?
Pronounced easier and better than other Crinolines? Of all the Cri-
nolines I ever heerd on, one sart is as easy to pronounce as are another;
besides what advantidge is there in pronouncun one Crinoline better
nor another? Them as wears the comfortablest, I should think, was
the kind to choose, not them as is easiest pronounced.
“Thirdly, Mr. Punch, I can’t make out the zignification of these
here Crown Crinolines beun ‘worn, by the leading circles of Society.”
Why, bless me, a Crinoline be a circle, bain't un; at least a framework
of circles one atop o' tºother? How circles is to wear circles passes
my, understandun., Round about a beer barrel is a circle to be sure,
and the hoop outzide o’ that’s a circle around a circle; what then, is
the “leading circles of society?” zummut o' the barrel shape? Ah
I be afeared they be but empty barrels; or any rate nothun in um like
good beer; nothun no better nor wues than the wust o' swipes; wot
we calls ‘sims’ down htreabouts.
“Lastly as to “first-class drapers.’ Is there classes o' drapers, ſust
second and third, like railway-carridges? Then I take it the differunce
chiefly is that the ſust-class drapers is the most expensive, and accord-
. that fine ladies as wants Crown Crinolines must expect to pay
Or um.
“Just below the foresaid advertisement there was another about
Crinoline, puffun up “The Crinoline Boot and Antigropelette’--what
a word! It said:—
“The Crinoline Boots are made for Ladies, Gentlemen, and Children."
“Gentlemen's boots have been the fashion for ladics for some time
now ; and the same boots now-a-days is generally made for gentlemen
and ladies—'cause I spose a little shoe and a sandle was thought to
make a girl's foot and ankle look too pretty. The Crinoline Boots
that’s now made a purpose for gentlemen I spose is boots wiCrinoline
to boot. Thcn the gentlemen too must ha taken to wearun petticoats.
Otherways what call have they got to wear Crinoline Now we
sartainly have got some cxcuse to do so; and mark my words what
Crinoline's comun to ; next time you comes down vrom Town 'tis like
enough you’ll zee we country bumpkuns clodhoppun over the ploughed
fields in our smock-frocks wiCrinoline under um.

FEDERAL MARBLES.
THE money article of the Times one day last week contained the
following quotation from a Yankee newspaper:—
“A large number of workmen are now busily cngaged in preparing for the placing
on the dome of the Capitol CRAwford's col statue of Freedom.”
What a seasonable proceeding ! But why should Freedom stand on
the Capitol alone? It is true that the habeas corpus has been sus-
)ended in the North, that the Press is gagged, and that the Federal
States are trying to reduce the Confederates to subjection. But to
accomplish this end they are fighting and not conquering in a fratricidal
war, spreading devastation, inflicting and suffering ruin and slaughter.
Therefore why do they not place a statue of Peace by the side of
liberty, a statue of Victory, and statues of Mercy and Prosperity, if
there is room for them? And since they cherish a feeling of hostility
towards this, country, as rancorous as it is groundless, statues of
Justice and Charity might be added, and, inasmuch as the Yankecs are
violating every {{#. of Christianity, the º might be completed
with a statue of Religion. These sculptures would cost some money,
but expense can be no object to a Government running up a debt which
will be limited only by a panic and ultimately repudiated.

THE SENSATION BALL :
THE LATEST PLEASANTRY IN THE PUBLIC STREETS.
HAMPSHIRE HOGGISM.
A WILE crime has been committed at Fordingbridge.
The scene is visited by hundreds of persons, who have
carried away all the bark of some trees that stand near the
spot, and—listen to this: “two cows, which are said to have
manifested excitement at the time of the deed, are also
objects of much curiosity.” So says the MorningStar. The
“curious” fools must be the legitimate descendants of the
people who paid to see the fork that had belonged to the knife
with which PEG Nicholson tried to wound KING GEORGE
THE THIRD, and with which she founded the order of “PEG
Nicholson's Knights.”. Surely if that admirable institu-
tion, the Asylum for Idiots, needs a valid appeal to the
popular purse, the directors would find one in a repre-
sentation that Idiotism is so lamentably prevalent as is
shown by this news from Fordingbridge, in which town,
by the way, in addition to a fine church, “are chapels
for, Wesleyans, Independents, and Quakers, ... National
*: British Schools, and a Literary and Scientific Insti-
ution.”
The report adds, however, that the “poor children”—the
adjective is appropriate—are better occupied than in attend-
ing either the National or the British School. They “make
much money by guiding visitors to the spot,” and of course
by explaining the details of one of the foulest crimes ever
committed by the Chaplain's Pet, the ticket-of-leave man.
Could not a commission, under the new L Act, be
issued to inquire into the mental condition of Fording-
bridge, with a branch investigation into the sort of teaching
administered in church, chapel, school, and institution?
Farinaceous Gunpowder.
SoME German chemists are said to have discovered that
starch, by being peculiarly treated with nitric acid, becomes
converted into an explosive substance which promises to
supersede common gunpowder. This starch, if employed
§ warlike purposes, will prove a stiffener for many a tall
ellow.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 11th, Friday. Everything that Mr. Punch does turns out for the
best. He is like Thomas the Rhymer who, despite his piteous protest that
the gift would disqualify him for the society of ladies and of statesmen
received a tongue that could not lie. º: most carelessly droppe
remark of Mr. Punch invariably consolidates into an adamantine truth,
and his most playfully conceived picture becomes, on the day it appears,
at once a pregnant record of the most important incident of the day
and a subtle prophecy of the results of such incident. If he attends a
public celebration or ceremonial, it proves to be of the most extraordi-
nary interest, if he stays away, it turns out to be something not worth
a moment's, attention. So with. Parliamentary, matters. When Mr.
Punch is in his place, the proceedings of the Legislature are as dignified
and significant as such things can be, but let him give himself a holiday,
and the sense, gravity, and wit of Parliament, take holiday likewise.
He cannot go wrong, or stay wrong. This mild and altogether inade-
quate tribute to his prescience is drawn from him by his recollection that
instead of attending at Westminster on the above mentioned Friday, he
went to º (with consequences which are a secret between
himself, the world, and policeman X555), and his perceiving, on aglance
at Saturday's papers, that nothing occurred on the Friday night that is
worth his notice. 'Except, indeed, that he rejoices in having been
absent from the House of Lords, for on that evening his friend the
Bishop of Oxford brought forward his new Bill for creating in heathen
parts English bishops who were not to owe allegiance to their Queen,
and his friend the LoRD CHANCELLOR, ever vigilant, tackled the bishop,
charged him with trying to get in the thin edge of the wedge for sepa.
rating Church and State, and having thus proved the Bishop of Oxford
to be a dissenter compelled the right reverend schismatic (not without
the exchange of some painfully smart language) to surrender his mea-
sure., This scene, Mr. Punch is truly glad to have escaped, nor would it
have been particularly pleasant to him to sit in the Commons, and hear
unsatisfactory replies to uninteresting questions until the House was
Counted Out. Q
Monday. Jamaica is one of the West India Islands, at least Mr.
Pºnch humbly yentures to think so, although he makes any geographi-
cal statement with extreme timidity, ever since his friendly antagonist the

gation that Brisbane was in New South #. Well, wherever
Jamaica is, it owes us a lot of money, and has not the slightest, inten-
tion of paying us, and we are going to compromise the debt, by
arranging that Jamaica shall pay the salary of its Governor. LORD
DeRBy made a smart speech on the matter this evening, and was
answered by LoRD TAUNToN, formerly MR, LABouchERE, and the two
3 nobles, like knights in an ancient tournament, were up in each other's
mottoes, the Knight of Derby asking his antagonist why he did not
remember his Passibus citis sed aquis, and the Knight of Taunton
retorting that his noble enemy had not forgotten his own Sans Changer.
A Bill on the subject was read a Second Time in the Commons, MR;
HADFIELD, like an attorney as he is, protesting against indulgence, and
wishing to issue execution against the poor Jamaicans.
Another Fortifications debate–Latin quotation, by SIR. G. LEWIS,
English quotation by MR. Osborne—a Government victory, 132 to 50,
and £110,000 voted. The Lunacy Reform Bill, went through Com-
mittee, and publicans, will be happy, to hear that the Bill for pre-
venting the obtaining beverages on tick was withdrawn.
Tuesday. The Houses, with a view to getting at the grouse, are
getting through business, and in consequence the proceedings are useful
and º LoRp Robert MonTAGU º interrupted this
onward course of events by a speech on Mexico, assailing Ministers for
having tolerated the rule of brigands there, but with having interfered
as soon as a constitutional government arose. He also remarked, with
some little strength of language, . that we had combined with the
Murderer of his Country's Liberties to raise a despotism in Mexico
that would be abhorred by men, and bring down the vengeance of
Heaven. MR. LAYARD did not enter into a purgation of the character
of His MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENch, nor into an exegesis
of the book of the prophet MonTAGU, but explained that we had done
all that was prudent, and likely to keep us out of entanglements. MR.
FITzGERALD thought that our withdrawing from Mexico was the most
graceful part of our proceedings, and he showed that, though a scholar
and a prizeman, he had forgotten his Macbeth, for he mentioned that it
had been "wittily remarked of some one, that nothing in life, became
him like the leaving it.” We don’t think Malcolm meant a joke when
informing the gracious Duncan that CawdoR had met the fate of
CoRDER. Another Count Out.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Second Reading, and the Game Preserving Instinct in the Commons was
strong enough to carry the measure, against the Government, by 149
to 94. Parties were divided, however, and that º: honest and
shrewd old Tory, MR. HENLEY, strongly opposed the Bill, thought it
much too * and also calculated to diminish the efficiency of the
police, who had plenty to attend to already. Some of his statistics
were so funny that Mr. Punch must cite them:-
“In the metropolitan districts there was a policeman for 504 people—a very good
fºllowance—but they could not stop thieving. In the rest of England the proportion
was one to 1,111. In London there were 13,700 belonging to the dangerous classes
and 6,000 policemen. In all the rest of England there were 15,000 police and 109,000
belonging to the dangerous classes. The proportion in London was two and one-
fifth, or two grown persons and a small boy—in the rest of England the proportion
amounted to seven and a small boy. In London, with a population of 8,000,000 odd,
there are 2,950 known thieves, 222 receivers, 7,096 trariatas, 1,974 suspected persons
1,463 vagrants—in all, 13,700. Really, as this is the age of soirées, he was su rised
SIR. Richard MAYNE. did not get up an entertainment at the Crystal P
(laughter)—and bring those 18,700 persons and the 6,000 policemen together. (Hear.)"
SIR. John PAKINGTON, on the other hand, maintained that the
poaching gangs were a demoralising nuisance, and made enormous
profits #: sale of the game they stole. SIR GEORGE GREY said
that the Bill would require much alteration.
Thursday. Since Christmas Day 1670, when SIR John CovenTRY,
M.P., was attacked in the street by SiR Thomas SANDys and some
other ruffianly friends of the Merry Blackguard CHARLEs THE Second,
there has not been a “sensation case” like that of to-day. It was
announced by LoRD H. LENNox that in the middle of the night of
esday, MR. PILKINGTON, the Member for Blackburn, on his way
home from the House, had been attacked near the Guards' Monument
in Pall Mall by two scoundrels, one of whom knocked him down and
left him nearly insensible, while another stole his watch. No policeman
was at hand, SIR. GeošGE GREY seemed to think that such things
could hardly be helped—“it was impossible to have a policeman every-
where where a gentleman might be in the four-and-twenty hours.” The
“Who goes home” will cease to be a form, if these outrages continue,
and they are very prevalent just now, thanks, to the ticket-of-leave
system, which returns us the criminal with all the accomplishments
: education and the grand tour. Members must see one another
Ome.
SIR.CHARLEs, Wood then addressed himself to show, at vast length,
and with that pleasing and distinct oratory for which he is celebrated,
that MR. LAINg's defence of his Indian Budget was unsatisfactory. The
various journals take opposite views of the case—according—not to
arithmetic-but to their Indian politics. The real question is, does
India promise to be really solvent, and, on the wº echo may
be considered to answer in the affirmative.
Pridº, The Canadians were censured in the Lords for refusing to
pass a Militia Bill, and divers apprehensions were expressed for which
Mr. Punch hopes that there is no cause. The ladies of England have
done so much towards promoting the Volunteer movement here that
Mr. Punch is inclined to ask the darling Muffins of Canada whether
they cannot take a similar course, and refuse to smile on any man who
does not support the Militia. That would be coming down with Sledge-
hammer force on the unwise recalcitrants.
MR. LAYARD said that the Foreign Office had no information as to
the alleged surrender of GENERA. M'CLELLAN's army. Later, Mr.
LINDsay persevered in bringing on his motion to the effect that it was
time to mediate between the §. and South. As this motion and
the debate which it occasioned may be the beginning of some serious
history, Mr. Punch will record that there were eight speakers—MR.
LINDsay, the mover; MR.P. TAYLOR, who vehemently opposed inter-
ference; Lord VANE TEMPEST, who urged it from motives of
humanity; MR. W. ForsTER, who strongly contended for adherence
to non-intervention: MR., WHITEsſDE, who, thought that a solemn
proffer of mediation would burst the War Bubble; LoRD PALMERston,
who deprecated angry debates, and hoped that a question of such
importance and delicacy would be left in the hands of the Government;
MR. Fitzgeralp, who thought the Confederates had earned a right to
recognition; and MR. Hopwood, who implored the Government to
take some action. MR. LINDsay then withdrew his motion. It is
difficult to ascertain the truth from telegrams and despatches manufac-
tured to order; but the news of the War seems to make it exceedingly
probable that “the beginning of the end” has come.
ST. SWITHUN AND SCIENCE.
(To the Editor of the Tablet.)
HE tradition, Sir, º:
the dependence of fine or
wet weather on St., Swith-
un's Day is hardly, I believe,
defide; but, not having been
ever condemned by the
Pope, is it, not a pious
opinion, which may be true,
and cannot be denied with-
& Qut Vºl. injury to the
faith? If so, what do you
§ say to the following state-
§ ment, which has been lately
published?—
“St. Swithun's 'day' falls in
a month in which more rain
- occurs than in any other in the
º year: nevertheless the records at
!y the Greenwich Observatory show
that, taking the average of the
last twenty years, of the forty
days which followed the 15th of
July, the greaterpart were rainy
when St. Swithun's Day was fine.
º period spoken of
there have never been forty con-
secutive wet or dry days after
the anniversary, whatever the
condition of the weather may
have been on that day.”
This dangerous if not per-
nicious statement occurs in
the Athenæum ; a heretical
- literary and scientific journal
which I suppose has been put into the Inder Expurgatorius, like almost every other
º paper but yours and mine. It rests, you will have observed, on the
aut º ºf the astronomers and meteorologists of Greenwich Observatory, which
is one of those pestilent institutions where the Book of Nature is read and inter-
preted under no condition of restraint or guidance by ecclesiastical authority.
If it ºught to have rained more or less on every day for forty days after St.
Swithun’s ‘Day whenever any rain fell on that day, as it ought if the Holy See
should ever decide that it º does, then the observers of Greenwich Qbser-
vatory have recorded facts which º; never to have taken place, º
an never, have occurred, and therefore ought never to have been published.
ere, perhaps, for aught we know, are phenomena brought into collision with
faith; meteorology at variance with, Catholic doctrine.
Such a contradiction would be impossible under a system
9f Catholic teaching, and, hence the necessity, for a
Catholic University of which the Charter is, with such
obstinate bigotry and intolerance, withheld by LoRD PAL-
MERSTON, but will, we may trust, be conceded by DERby
and D13RAELI, if ever they have the chance of making any
concession of the kind. When the facts contradict the
faith, so much the worse for the facts. ...That, I appre:
hend, is the principle on which our deputation, that waited
the other day upon the persecuting PREMIER, insist upon
...; privileged to conduct education, and form the human
mind. That is the way—is it not?—to train the risi
generation, so as to prepare it for the study of Nature,
for the perusal of
49&NCB.
Feast of St. Swithun, 1862.
A QUESTIONABLE COMMITTAL.
A CoRREspondent asks “Can Mr. Punch tell me under
what act this comes?—
“MARY DAY, of Longnor, was sentenced to three months' im-
prisonment for sleeping in the open air, on Tuesday night, the 8th
instant.”
The Vagrant Act. The report is taken from the Burton
Advertiser, under the head of Special Petty Sessions. It
is somewhat concise. Therefore, had the Magistrates who
disposed, of the case been stipendiary, we should have
presumed that there were circumstances, unreported, which
justified them in committing the accused as a rogue and
vagabond. But knowing of what a country bench is
capable, we are free to confess, using parliamentary lan-
guage, that we cannot say that we are not sure that the
judgment above recorded is not a specimen of justices'
justice. But for ourgentlemanlike and opulent appearance,
we should hesitate a little to take a siesta on a . º
# º could find one this summer in the neighbourhood o
uxton.
You may well Say That.
Wººl M. GALLAIT probably behave in a disgraceful
manner
Because, after being fêted in England, he’ll go home and
tell Leys?

CHARIVARI. 33
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
EAR PUNCH,
. “In the interval
since my last let-
ter but little has
occurred of much
dramatic note.
Thanks to country
visitors, old pieces
still keep run-
ning, though their
charms, to London
lay-goers, must
ong ago have
ceased. Stoke
Exhibition, , , of
course delights to
i. ". º:
la Peep o'Day
and the Porter's
Knot, while our
old friend Lord
Dundreary nightly stammersforth his smalltalk for the benefit of Slushborough and
Stickley-in-the-Mud, Indeed in a dramatic way, but few things have of late been
more attractive to the Londoner than the fancy fair and fête for the Dramatic
College, an institution which all playgoers I think ought to suppºrt. If one could
count up all the hearty laughs heard mightly at the theatres, what an amount of
cachinnation one would find . early cause! Now, there are few things of more
value to good health than a good laugh, and if a halfpenny per laugh were handed
over to the College, there would be little fear of actors who have lived to give such
pleasure ever dying in distress. -
“Mention of this charity induces very naturally a word anent its Master, wh9m
I rejoiced the other night to see again at his own house in the Dead Heart...MR.
WEBSTER has long ranked among the best of English actors, and it is well our
foreign friends should see that we have still goºd acting, left in England, and
that it is not mere sensation only that can fill ºtheatre. With his calm collected
bearing and passionless cold voice, MR. WEBSTER very certainly makes the most of
Robert Landry (and very ably is he aided by the ABBé Day.In Fish ER, who always
is painstaking and tries to act his best); but one almost feels regret to see him
where his talents are not allowed more scope, and they who have had the fortune
to see him in Tartuffe will not confine their admiration to his acting as they see it
in a piece like the Dead Heart. - -
“I was glad to find the house so well filled when I went: but the Adelphi is so
comfortable that it is no wonder people flock to it, no matter what may be the
attractions of the stage. You have room to stretch your legs there, and can
breathe and hear and see, without having to sit sideways and crane your neck, and
bend your back, and generally distort yourself as is the case at other theatres,
You are charged a fixed price for your seat, and, this paid, you are never called
upon for extra, sixpences. I am sure the small exactions by book-keepers, often
d to the dislike which many comfort-loving people feel to gqing to the play.
“I am not aware iſ foreigners still cling to the old notion that we of England are
by no means a music-loving people. If so, such of them, whº are among us now
had better count how many gongerts there are announced daily in the columns of
‘ze Taimes’ (what a "Jubilee’ was that of yours, Professon Philharmonic
BENNETT how WEBER, Spohr, MENDELssohn, Glºck, Beethoven, and Mozºt
would have rejoiced to hear their works performed by such aband as yours, he ped
by Joachinſ and ANDERson, TIETJENs and JENNY, Lindl); and besides countin
the concerts, let our foreign friends take note that both our operas are open i
that the two together lately have been giving eight or nine performances: * -
At HERMAJESTY's Miss PYNE and MR. SANTLey have been showing that iºnºi
has some singers who can, sing Italian songs; and here RossINI's Fº
sisters MARCHIsIQ, have been warbling Semiramide like a couple of twin night-
ingales, on the might; when FRAULEIN TIETJens has rested her sweet voice.
Hºw Meyerº's Robertº has been done at Covent Garden, hath not Punch
already told? And here ADELINA PATTI, that pleasant piquant little party, has
been singing as Amina, and Norina, and Zerlina, and Rosina (are there any other
characters that rhyme with ADELINA?) in a way; to bring down nightly on her
pretty little head a whole.Covent Garden Marketful of rapturous bouquets. More-
over, here is MAR19, deliciousest of tenors, who sings in such pure style and with
such exquisite good taste; and in addition, here is, TAMBERLIK-ARNOLD. Don
OTTAvio TAMBERLIK—with his famous high chest C, and his fashionable ribrato,
which makes his fine yoice shake as though it had the ague. Terribly infectious
are these shaking fits, it seems, and nearly every new singer appears to catch the
malady. To me these vocal shivers are exceedingly distressing, and I shall heartily
rejoice when the disease has quite died out.
“ONE WHo PAYs.”
A Stream of Ill-Luck.
THE Metropolitan Railway has been inundated so often that it is a kind of
misnomer to talk of it as the Underground Railway. A more fitting appellation
would certainly be, The Underwater Railway.
OLD ABE AT THE BAR (OF PUBLIC
OPINION).
Young, JonATHAN, in liquorin’ tastes,
as long dropped beer and mocked ale,
For julep, sherry-cobler,
Gin-sling and brandy.cocktail;
Gum-tigkler and chain:lightning,
º and leg-tangler–
And scores of other compounds known
To each 'cute bar-room dangler.
Until at last his liquors he
Has grown so fond of mixin',
He scorns the charms of alcohol
Without some artful “fixin',
Some sugary aid to make it sweet,
Some acid smack to sourit,
Till each drink needs two jugs at least,
And two smart hands to pour it.
We see how fashion spreads and grows,
Till all around it catches,
So Jonathan's new taste in drinks
Has now reached to despatches.
His palate too fastidious
For unadulterate factis,
And mixing truth with lies has grown
His barman's constant practice.
Where dull John Bull would measure out
Defeat’s unmingled bitters,
In water from truth's well, despite
Britannia's tears and twitters,
The caterers for JonATHAN
With bunkum brag and bluster
Spice up defeat to victory,
And call it “raal eye-duster.”
There at the bar in Washington
Sits one as honest ABE known,
From his rail-splitting Springfield days
As truthful as a babe known—
But “at the bar ’tis as the bar”—
So honest Abe in fixin'
Despatches up for JonATHAN
as learnt the art of mixin'.
From Victory's goblet to Defeat's
This way and that he tosses
Retreats, advances, fronts and rears,
Facts, figures, gains and losses.
Is the draught harsh? Ahonied lie
akes º palates placid:
aſſes the draught cloy?, Throw in a dash
Of partial loss for acid.
And when he’s stirred the stuff about
Till Staunton's taste approves it,
Or SEWARD's, who bad news can fix
As Jonath AN best loves it;
The mixture's handed from the bar,
So cunningly compounded, ... .
Few can pick ºut the truth with lies
The lies with truth confounded.
“Truth, cºld without, Sir,” says old ABE,
“With Jonathan is scaarse, Sir:
He’s used to take it with a dash
Of hot sensation saarse, Sir.
I guess his stomach 'twouldn't suit,
erhaps bring on the shakes, Sir,
So palatable at our bar
he naked truth we makes, Sir.”
A Silk Gown that is only Worsted.
It is not only unfair but ungenerous to condemn MR.
Edwin JAMEs for his defence, simply because it happens
to be extremely lame, and impotent, and ludicrously
laboured and evasive; for it is *H clear, º: BARon
BRAMwell, ever since the late M.P. for Marylebone
has been disbarred, that his arguments can be little
better than ex-Q.C.’s (ercuses).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 37
THE LAST FRENCH ROMANCE.
WILL you hear of a lovely young lady of France,
For whom knights in old days would have levelled the lance,
And she had great riches and beauty beside,
And an Empress's Chamberlain wanted a bride,
Singing, Vite en carrosse, rite à la noce!
Now CLAIRE had a lover already, small blame,
Or none, to the darling for having that same:
An able young statesman, but poor by compare.
With toadies who fawn round an Empress's chair.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce
She had also an uncle as kind as could be,
A General Receiver of Taxes was he,
His name as you spell it was FontLNALLAT, -
But of course being French it must not rhyme with that.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce/
The beautiful EMPREss she listed the prayer
That she’d have her gay Chamberlain married to CLAIRE,
Grand-niece of DUKE PASQUIER, and as hath been told,
No end of a fortune in silver and gold:
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce /
Then smiled the fair EMPREss, and promised to use
Her counsel to CLAIRE as to whom she should choose:
Nothing doubting the maiden would gladly obey
Her Sovereign's behest, and immediately say
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce /
But CLAIRE, in the presence, made blushing admission
That she loved, and . only her young politician,
And i. that MADAME would select, for her pearl
Of Chamberlain-courtiers, some other rich girl.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce /
The beautiful EMFREss felt mightily riled, -
And feared the young lady was what you call spiled :
“To think, when the Court has the goodness to choose
A spouse for a virgin, the girl should refuse.
To sing, Vite en carrosse, vite à la noce '’
Alarmed at the point in the EMPREss's words,
Poor CLAIRE hurried off to the “Convent of Birds,”
And sought the protection of padlock and grate
For a flutterer invited to choose a wrong mate.
Wite en carrosse, tite à la noce/
But, alas for the lover of worried Miss CLAIRE,
She entered a trap when she took herself there;
And the H. Superior, by night and by day,
Conjured and implored the poor girl to give way.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce/
The Lady Superior, when baffled, brought in
A burly Archbishop, who talked about sin,
And preached to Miss CLAIRE that the Devil alone
Made her shy at a marriage advised by the Throne,
That said Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce /
Yet still the young lady was constant and true,
And vain was the ecclesiastical screw,
But they worked it so hard that at last the poor maid
Wrote off to her uncle to come to her aid.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce/
He i. the sad letter, brave FoxTINALLAT,
He dashed out an oath, and he dashed on a hat,
And he dashed in his carriage to call on his Chief,
The Minister, Fould, of the Hebrew belief.
Wite en carrosse, cite à la noce/
AcHILLEs was out, but PATRocLUs was there
Who knew the whole story of #. Miss CLAIRE,
And informed the brave uncle his place would depend
On his }. the Chamberlain's champion and friend.
ite en carrosse, cite à la noce /
“There are some things,” says HoRAce, "too awful for verse,”
And one’s when a Frenchman commences to curse;
But if oaths may be pardoned it’s when they’re let fly
At a rogue who would make you his tool and ally.
ite en carrosse, vite à la noce/
MoNSIEUR FONTINALLAT ºf blazed like a bomb
Informed poor PATRoclus (with horror struck dumb)
That having imparted his notions at large,
He should seek his hotel and await his discharge.
f
Wite en carrosse, cite à la noce.
It came in an hour-ere another had past
He had CLAIRE in his unclely arms safe and fast,
And he took her away, the poor true-hearted dove,
And swears she shall marry the man of her love.
Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce/
And if with a moral you’d like to be bored,
See Court, Priest, and Minister awfully floored;
For trying what threat and corruption would do,
To force a young maid, in Eighteen Sixty Two,
o say, Wite en carrosse, vite à la noce /
PETTICOATS AND PICKPOCKETS.
WHAT is enough for one is enough for two, is a saying supposed to
warrant any man in marrying who is able to live. hatever truth
there may once have been in that maxim, there can be none now when
wives have become so expensive as º are rendered by their excessive
drapery. Of that, to be sure, it may safely be said, that what is enough
for one is enough for a half a dozen. No wonder that the Employment
of Women question presses, and that young ladies are singing “We’ve
got no h’ork to Do,” and “Nobody Coming to Marry Me.” This excess
of º: threatens to be as everlasting as the Income-Tax; which it
sorely aggravates. It is really a great bore... In every thoroughfare, it
establishes an effective blockade. It constitutes the fuel of that fire
through which, Fashion passes her children to Moloch. That may
serve them #. and be of no more consequence than the moth's
extinction in the candle; but it is too bad that redundance of petticoats
should bring a respectable man into trouble, as it did one day last week.
A gentleman, called in a police report “a Member of the Society of
Friends,” in business with his father at Macclesfield, was pulled up
before DAYMAN, at Westminster, on a charge of havin , at the
Brompton Exhibition, attempted to, pick a lady's pocket. ChowNE
º E. 5, a detective in plain clothes, “had his attention directed
to the prisoner,” who was in the Machine Room among some, ladies
looking at the machinery. ChowNE saw him there by the side of a
woman “whose pocket it was his impression he was trying to pick;”
and accordingly the officer took him up. He was ºf off to the
station, searched, taken before the Magistrate, remanded for a week on
bail in two sureties of £250 each, and reappeared on remand, when :-
“MR. SMYTH, on the part of the prisoner, stated that his client had only come to
town a day or two previously, and was there on the day in question with his sister,
brother, and friends, to see his brother's machinery. His client could have no
motive for committing a robbery, as he possessed considerable property, and bore
at Macclesfield a character unimpeachable for integrity. At the time alluded to by
the officer his client was pushing aside the hoops of the lady's crinoline in order that
he Inight have a better view of the machine.”
The evidence of MR. CoBDEN and several other members of Parlia-
ment, and gentlemen, as to the character of the accused, fully bore out
this defence, and the worthy Quaker left the Court, as MR. DAYMAN
said, without a stain on his reputation. Yes; but not without a scar
on his feelings, left # seven long days’ anxiety and fear. And all this
grievous annoyance this gentleman incurred merely by pushing aside
the hoops of a ºf nuisance, and unpunishable social evil.
All men visiting the º Exhibition, unless they want to be
arrested for picking ladies' pockets, should keep their hands carefully in
their own. How to dispose of your hands in an omnibus, where the
muslin of your female neighbours extends over your stomach, however
convex, is a hard matter. Entirely to preclude suspicion, you may
perhaps resort to the expedient of holding them up over your head, and
then you had better tell the passengers why you do so, lest they should
think you a fool. A better plan will be to carry about with you a number
of Punch, and, as soon as you have seated yourself, take it out and read.
Éverybody will allow that nobody can read Punch, and pick pockets
too. Crinoline makes it necessary for you to guard yourself against
imputations which may be cast upon you, by any officious observer or
malevolent woman. No doubt the huge hoops and enormous skirts of
women do afford facilities to pickpockets. That would be a goºd thing,
because it would very soon reduce petticoats within compass, if ladies
ockets, as fast as emptied, had not generally to be filled by their
usbands and fathers.
Change of Name.
If the “Board of Works” deal in such dirty jobs as this Montagu-
House business, we shall have to make an addition to their Title. “The
Board of Works of Darkness” would be highly appropriate.

in their descriptions, I hope the next one published will change all that) I feel convinced that
there must be machinery inside, which will cause the extinguisher to fall at the proper

“FOR PRINCES SHOULD BE FREE.”
THE Orleans Princes have left the army of the Northern States, and have returned to
Europe. For doing this their Royal, Highnesses are of course, sneered at by the American
organ here, and are, doubtless vilified by its friends of the Northern press. But it is difficult
to understand why the Princes should have remained, or indeed how they could have done so.
# avowedly went out to learn the art of war, and they found their teachers the most
helpless, blunderers that ever undertook what they could, not perform. Any apprentice is
legally justified in breaking his indentures, if he can show that his master is incompetent to
teach him a business. ... No, European master of war would take into his service a
young person with no better military education than the Princes could ſº in America,
and it was due to their own character to leave as soon as they discovered how they had been
swindled out of a premium—the prestige of their names. But in addition to this, the Orleans
Princes are gentlemen, and it must have been odious to them to remain in a service where
the boldest lying instead of the boldest fighting was in demand, and where it was possible
for them to have come under the orders of a ruffian like GENERAL BUTLER, who might have
desired a Count of PARIs and a DUKE of CHARTREs to see to the execution of brutal orders
ainst French and other ladies. We have no desire to see any change in the dynasty of
rance, but these Princes have certainly not lessened their claim to the respect of their
countrymen, by quitting a service in which, while they were serving, they behaved as became
gallant i. but from which they retired as soon as they were completely convinced that
they could study ſittle but blunder, braggadocio, and brutality

M. JULEs GÉRARD, the celebrated tweur de lions,
has been commissioned by MR. CowPER to pro-

he may have the good luck to meet with. They
are then to be ed in the hands of a skilful

placed on the vacant pedestals of Trafalgar

his leonine studies at the Zoological Gardens.
So lon #. is it since these lazy lions were first

A WORK FOR THE DRAWING-ROOM.
HERE is shortly to
be brought out as
a companion to the
well-known French
publication, called
“Les Français peints
ar eur-mémes,” an
nglish series under
the title of “Les
Anglaises peintes par

Every specimen will
be highly coloured,
no plain copies being
allowed under any
circumstances to be
seen by the public.
Some idea of the
extravagance of the
work may be drawn
from the fact that
as much as £160 and
£200 will be spent
on some of the
single specimens.
º will be issued
in the very richest
covers, and alto-
gether will be brought out utterly regardless of expense.
SIR CHARLES WOOD’S TRIUMPHANT REPLY.
(Taken by our Special Reporter).
MR. SPEAKER, or at least, Sir, because Mr. Speaker is not here, and
we are in committee, I wish to explain Indian affairs, at least I don’t
mean Indian affairs generally, except so far as they may be what you
may call financial affairs, and in fact I want, Sir, to show you, and when
I say you I don't mean you_particularly, because you may or may not
take an interest in Indian affairs, and if so you have probably been in
the Indian gallery at the International, where, there are some P.
things, very pretty things indeed, but I mean the Committee. I want
to show the Committee that MR. LAING when he attacked me, at least
I attacked him, but he answered me, and I will be judged by gentlemen
in private life whether it will do to allow servants to answer you: I
don’t mean that he is my servant, brushes my trousers and that, but he
is a subordinate, and he takes Fº himself to say that I don't under-
stand the accounts upon which I have taken him to task. Sir, what I
may understand or may not understand is not now the º suffice
it to say that I wish the Committee to understand that I am not going
to be put down by a subordinate º because he has taken a leaf out
of the book of my right honourable friend the CHANCEllor of the
Exchequer, and has cooked accounts neatly but not º as some-
body said when he Fº his tail pea green. If there is one thing
in the world which I hate it is confusion either in ideas or language,
and I hope the Committee will bear with me, while I endeavour to
mystify—no I don't mean that, I mean clarify—the account, as presented
by Mr. LAING. If you take a deficiency of £6,500,000 and deduct it
from a deficit of £4,000,000, that leaves you a clear balance of
£2,500,000—no, stop, you can't do that, because that, of course, as the
committee sees, would be taking the smaller sum from the larger—no,
the larger sum from the smaller, which can’t be done, but of course we
arrive at the same result."Weil then, if you take the military charges
I think you are bound to treat them in a civil manner (laughter). f
mean that you must look upon them in the same way, and of course, if
a rupee is only one and ten-pence, which I need hardly †. is twenty-
pence (hear, hearſ). Well, I know as well as the hon. Member who
cheers me that one and ten is eleven, but how does that bear upon
my argument?. A rupee is a rupee, and I cannot understand how MR.
Laing brings in the question of muskets. He calls this one of the
proper charges, but I do not know whether he means the charges
which ought to be put into the muskets, but if he does I for one
am always averse to interfering with the regular military authority.
But, allowing this, and as I said showing a deficit, I mean of course a
surplus, if £5,200,000, no, £2,500,000-yes, that is right, and if you
deduct the licence-tax, and the railways, and the police of India,
altogether amounting to £400,000,000—no, I mean £4000-stop, it’s
º but the ink has run into the oughts and made them look any-
how—I say that if MR. LAING) does not choose to subtract properly,
and sends over a deficit, by which I mean a surplus, which he cannot
vindicate, I cannot help that. I saw a Mr. Saunders the other day,
I don't mean MR. Jacky SAUNDERs who was at the Adelphitheatre,
quite the contrary, but a man who had been asked to look at Indian
cotton, and what did MR. SAUNDERs say? Why, Sir, he said, “We
require nothing of the Government.” I do not myself see the bearing
of that, observation upon MR. LAING's balance sheet, but I have pro.
mised the Committee that I would put them in possession of all the
information in my power, and I have redeemed my pledge, and I will
add too, Sir, that though Mr. Lºng says there is a deficit (an hon.
Member “A surplus º eh? yes, you—at least the hon. Member is quite
right, I mean a surplus, and it is my painful duty to differ from him,
still as LoRD CANNING was a º man, and as I have every reason to
believe that there...is no rebellion going on at present in India, Ihope
this Committee will feel that I have demoralised—no, Imeandemolished
the arguments of MR. LAING, and that India and England will ever
hereafter be sources of benefit to one another, especially England
(Loud Cheers).
THE JUSTICES, JUBILEE;
OR SUCCESS TO Tile NIGHT-Poaching BILL.
HURRAH! Hurrah! For our game preserves,
Hurrah for the fat battue,
A flush of pheasants at every hedge,
And for each man loaders two
Hurrah for the Bill that makes the police,
Assistant-keepers all—
And pays 'em out of the County-rates,
That on the farmers fall—
The Bill that helps sport for the big,
And spoils it for the small!
There's never a man along the road
Shall venture now to fare,
A carrying under his landlord's nose
A pheasant or a hare.
The constable will pull him up,
And dearly he’ll pay his shot,
When 'tis for him to prove to us
That a poacher he is not,
And that from our preserves the bird
In his hand was never got.
There’s nothing that doth run on wheels
Along the Queen's highway,
But a constable in search of game
The vehicle may stay.
At their perillet snobs a pheasant dare
To order from market-town,
Or bid the poultererPºliº. or hare
To their villas send 'em down;
Let the carrier who brings’em of squalls beware,
And the Justices' . frown!
And let each man that deals in game
At penalties turn pale;
(Except the landlords who wholesale sell
What the tradesman vends retail)
We’ll force him to keep a register
From whom his game he buys,
Of course of pheasants in the egg
he’re free to find supplies,
No questions we ask of egg-sellers,
And so we hear no lies.
“From other duties the police,”
Says HENLEY, “’twill distract,”
What duty equals taking up
A poacher in the fact
What property so stands in need
Of law's protecting arm,
As pheasants, hares and partridges
hat do nobody harm, -
Save grumbling tenants who complain
That they won't let them farm?
A Valuable Animal.
STRANGE are the wants of the advertising public. For instance, look
at this announcement in the Daily Telegraph :-"Wanted, a Youth, to
Look after a Horse, that can drive,” &c.—“A horse that can drive l’”
Perhaps the next thing we shall hear of will be a horse that can harness
himself, or accomplish his own grooming. Really if we can manage
to keep horses without having to keep servants for them, a stable will
be within the most limited of means, when horses are no more trouble
to attend to than are clothes-horses.

POLYGLOT POETRY.
THE Times is very good-natured, but then it comes out every day,
and has got a very large sheet. it is all very well for the Times to
ratify the parents of clever little boys by inserting their Greek and
atin Exercises on TENNYSON, but Mr. Punch has no room for such
things. That was a very meat Greek version by MASTER C. C. CLARK,
of the Inauguration Ode, though we think, without wishing to indulge
in severe criticism, that had he regarded some of the poet's ideas in a
different light, he would probably have employed other phraseology, and
a similar remark applies to the Latin version of MASTER WHEweLL,
who, M.R. Cox of Finsbury thinks, has introduced in the last line an
allusion to “beet” root, which Mr. Cox of Finsbury cannot find in the
original. We should like to please other young gentlemen, especially
MASTER MoRDECAI MEPHIBosheth, who has sent us the ode in
Hebrew (is shobhus quite elegant for “day of rest”?). MASTER HELI-
PockMARKIDos PHILANTHROPophagos, who forwards us the ode in
modern Greek (and does not pay the postage), and MASTER CRWM-
MYLLwygww.MTH, of Mold, who alleges that with a Welsh version of
the same composition, he encloses a cheese, which has certainly not
come to hand, for we cannot regard his verses as the cheese. We are,
lºſſ. that the youth of Europe are studying so admirable a
poem, and we wish the best poet of England the same good wish that
was expressed to the worst poet of Athens: “Bless thee, ‘ALFRED,’
bless thce—thou art translated.”

with the representatives, corresponding to that which they have acquired over the

carry out. The advance was made in the identical direction as that in
which the rebel army were proceeding, and was achieved, I need not
say, with the most complete success." Astonishing to say, the whole of
our front line escaped without a hurt; and with the exception of a few
slight wounds and bruises in the rear, I really have no casualties worth
mention to report. A good deal of our baggage and some few hundred
stand of arms we left upon the field for a strategic purpose, and we
likewise abandoned about a score of field-pieces which were found to
impede the rapid movement of our troops.

EARL OF DARNLEY, of the foundation of the New Ragged
School about to be built, at Gravesend. The Clergy and
Dissenting Ministers of the town were invited, and plenty
of the latter came; but the former were conspicuous by
their absence, and particularly two of them, who did not
even answer the invitations they had received. "A reverend
nonconformist had to perform the suitable devotions.
The noble Earl, professing himself “a strict Churchman,”
regretted to find that the Gravesend clergy “were totally
unrepresented on the occasion,” and “that amongst other-
wise pious and godly, men a system of exclusiveness
revailed.” What is the meaning of all this? Had the

A MUSICAL PETITION.
MY DEAR GLADSTONE, - - -
THE Royal Academy of Music is in want of funds, and I
hear that a Memorial has lately been addressed to you to notify the fact.
Of course I need not ask if you have read this composition, for I know
that as a conscientious servant of the State you carefully peruse every
paper put before you, with as much pains and attention as you do your
weekly Punch. need therefore scarce remind you that, besides a
number of equally good grounds for claiming aid from your Exchequer,
it is urged in this memorial:—
“That the good effect upon the million of the introduction of practical music into
the course of national education must afford HER MAJESTY's Government perfect
satisfaction with this important measure. . As the public power of comprehending
an art increases, to elevate the character of those whose duty is both to form the
public taste and gratify it becomes more and more indispensable. Music has made
prodigious progress in England during the last forty years, and it now holds promi-
ment importance in the intellectual development of the country; coincident with
this course of advancement have been the workings of the Royal Academy of Music
and the national advantages that might issue from such an Institution would
increase with the natural capacity to benefit by them. The revived importance of
Church Music is a significant feature of this progress; and another is the improve-
ment in the Music of the Army; in both of which departments it would surely be
of value to the authorities that have the granting of appointments, could they refer
to certificates as to the competency of candidates for such appointments from an
Institution like the Academy, which was ified by the countenance of HER
MAJESTY's Government. In the consideration of the desirability and the capabilities
of the Academy, the immense importance of music as furnishing occupation to the
industrial classes must be taken into account, many thousands of the population
being at present engaged in the facture of musical instruments, the engraving and
printing of music, &c., and the extent of employment of this nature increases with
the increase of the knowledge of the art throughout the country.”
Surely, my dear GLADSTONE, for these reasons alone the Academy of
Music is deserving of support; and although, only a few nights of the
Session now are leſt to you, I am, sure you will name one of them to
bring the application for a grant before the House. ...What is wanted
the Memorialists have taken care to state; and you will not doubt their
competence to judge of it when you see among their signatures such
names as BENNETT, GARCIA, SMART, BENEDICT, MACFARREN, LESLIE,
MELLON, WALLACE, TIETJENs, and JENNY LINd:—
“The Academy is not now to be considered as an experiment; the forty years'
experience of its operations, through all its vicissitudes of fortune and of man
ment, is a sufficient test of its capabilities. These capabilities are restricted by the
extent of its funds, and qualified by the necessary means of acquiring these funds.
It is not always the most gifted individuals who have the best pecuniary resources
and it is therefore deeply to be regretted that the present large rate of ann
payment (three and thirty guineas) should be required from the pupils. While,
therefore, the grant by Government of a building for the j on of the opera-
tions of the establishment (a support enjoyed by all the scientific and artistic bodies
in the metropolis) would greatly relieve the academy of its apprehensions, the
concession of yet more liberal assistance would give the power of diminishing the
charges to students, and increasing the number of free scholarships, and thus vastly
enhance the benefits of the Institution.”
Being devoted to “the spreading of a pure knowledge of art and the
extending of its refining influence,” the Academy of Music, if helped
liberally by Government, might really work such wonders as one hardly
dares to guess at. If only properly encouraged, there is very little
doubt that its “refining influence” might eventually be extended to
street-singers and musicians; and that, being instructed in a “pure
knowledge of art,” these performers would no longer cause such tor-
ture as they now do to the ears of all who hear them. Much as I now
loathe, detest and execrate street-music, I should not complain if
JoAchim came once a week or so and played a bit of, BEETHoven
awhile beneath my window; nor should I growl or grumble iſ a MARIo
or a SIMS REEVEs were now and then to serenade me with RossINI or
MozART. Well, you see if the Academy of Music be supported, there
really is no saying how the JoAcIIIMs and MARIos and SIMS REEVESEs
may be multiplied; and, I am sure that this reflection will be in itself
sufficient to incline a liberal Government to be liberal in its grant.
Music, it is said, has done much for the million; and something short
of a million might do much for music. -
With just a nudge to PAM to back you in the matter, I remain, my
dear GLADSTONE, yours most sincerely,
49&Mºb

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 2, 1862.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HE 21st July. Monday. LoRD
ChELMsFord (motto “Spes et
Fortuna,” it should have been
rich MR. Hope's) objected to
part of a Bill which it seems
permits the Board of Trade,
now the possessors of Rams-
gate Harbour, to make railways
through that aristocratic water-
ing place. ... As usually happens
when lordly or other lawyers
oppose schemes, some selfish
interest is at the bottom of the
business, and Lord STANLEY
of ALDERLEY (motto “Sans
Changer”) pointed out that this
opposition was not Ramsgate's,
but for some ship-owner's pri-
vate benefit. "LORD SANs
CHANGER having made the
law lord take his change out of
that, the DUKE of MonTRQSE
(motto “Ne oubliez”) having
shown that he had not for-
gotten the facts, and EARL
GRANville (motto “Frangas
non flectes”), intimating that
he had not the least intention
of bending, the Bill passed.
The only reason Punch can see
for not introducing a new rail
into Ramsgate is, that, everybody there is on the rail from morning
to might, railing at the landladies’ charges, cribs, and cribbings. Note
to Sojourners. When a landlady, with some ostentation, has given you
a Bramah key of the cheffonier, and hoped you will be very careful in
locking up your brandy and so on, draw the article of furniture from the
wall and examine the rear. Some of these depositaries are i.
made to open with a flap at the back. We wouldn't have peached,
MRs. BUFFINs, but you were so rude as well as so exacting, and you
know you stole that champagne. Six hundred and fifty-five Ladies of
Berkshire, signified, viá LoRD ABINGDON (motto “Wirtus Ariele For:
tior”), that they would (circumstances favouring) marry their deceased
Sisters' Husbands.
The Scotch Salmon Bill passed the Lords, the EARL or GALLOWAY
(motto “Wirescit vulnere virtus”) having tried to get the Solway taken
out of the measure, we haye no idea why. Love swells like the Solway
and ebbs like its tide, as Loch.INvAR fils, observed, but we do not see
the bearing of the fact upon salmon. The Bill is law, and we hope
LoRD GALLOWAY's Wirtue will Flourish all the more for this extremely
slight Wound to his self-importance.
M.S. Fitzgiºn inquired what measures were being taken for the
protection of English, subjects and property at New Orleans. A very
proper inquiry, considering that #. ladies may be there, and that
GENERAL BUTLER certainly is. The answer was rather mystical, but
assurance was given that the subject is being attended to by the
Government.
We pay £39,747 to Dissenting ministers in Ireland. MR. HADFIELD,
Punch is bound to say, with consistency, moved in Supply that this
vote be refused. ... SIR Robert PEEL's happy faculty of saying graceful
things again availed him, and he managed to intimate that the gift was
a sort of political boon to the Irish Presbyterians. “A grant for
bribing them, in fact,” said our plain-spoken Wiscount WILLIAMs.
“I did not say that.”, “But that is what, you meant,”, continued the
downright nobleman. “You bribe them to be loyal, and this is needless,
for there is not a disloyal man in the kingdom.” Bravo, our dear
Lord, but this comes of conferring hereditary honours on patriots. If
you did not wear a glittering coronet, such an utterance would be an
honest honourable testimony from a man of the people. Of course the
vote passed, despite PEEL the Putter-of-foot-in-it,
A capital bit of LoRD DUNDREARY. Everybody knows that DANIEL
MACLISE has put up a most noble work at Westminster. Opposite to
it is a lancet window, which throws all kinds of intrusive colours upon
the painting. Complaint is made by Lord H. LENNox, and DUN-
DREARY CowPER says that a fellah can't do everything, no fellah can
be expected to do everything, you know, he had ordered a deaf person—
stop—no he had ordered a blind person—no, no, a blind person couldn't
see a picture, you must see that—it was a blind, not a person, that’s
right, at least he had ordered a person to put up a blind, and that most
inadequate—stop, he wasn't inadequate—inadvertent, that was it—that
*...* person had gone, at least he hadn't gone, and not put the
thing up.
LoRD PALMERSTON, in reference to Belgrade, said that the authorities
seemed to have got an unpleasant way of bombarding the townspeople,
but that the Consuls were to intimate that this was rather like adminis-
trative eccentricity.
The Royal Academy then came to grief, LoBD ELcho carrying a
motion for a commission to inquire into its goings on. MR. CowPER
surrendered without a blow, but amiable Lord John MANNERs, cer.
tainly without intending it, said the cruellest thing. He “hoped that
the Royal Academy would not be again attacked while there were so
many distinguished foreign artists in London.” Just so—while every-
º feels uncomfortable in mentioning before foreign artists the name
of the Academy, which actually refused M. MEYERBEER, a ticket for
the Dinner, and excluded other “distinguished foreign artists” in order
to make room for people who had as much business at the board as the
beadles in the hall. A cruelly hard hit, Lord John, and highly calcu-
lated, as your respected motto says, “Pour y Parvenir,” if that means
to Attain the Qbject of serving out your protégés.
LoRD PAM having “chaffed" MR. g. upon his exertions in
favour of Cork, and MR. Solicitor-GENERAL having rebuked MR.
SoLICITOR Cox for acting as the organ of some Law Stationers, in
opposition to certain Chancery Reforms, there was more Supply. The
PREMIER told a gay story about a sailor's wife, and complimented the
young diplomatic service, which MR. LAYARD said had long ceased to
deserve the “ cigar and kid-glove” conventional reproach. But there
is a certain order of Dull Dogs who will no more surrender this bit of
wit than they will cease to describe aldermen as having protuberant
stomachs, will abstain from throwing a light upon the subject, when they
turn on gas, or will desist from º: a thing, “far-fetched,” because
they cannot understand it. Our young friends the diplomatists must
continue to writhe under such epigrams, as those of MR. WHITE, of
Brighton. Then came a little Fortifications debate, and LoRD PAL.
MERSTON informed MR. BERNAL Osborne that he was known to have
a “mania” on the subject, and that his opinion was valued accordingly.
Tuesday. The Thames Embankment Bill came before the Lords for
Second Reading. The Duke of Buccleuch, (motto, “Amo”) came
amiably out of the controversy, complaining that he had been misrepre-
sented, and that though he certainly saw great practical objections to
the scheme, independently of his natural objection to the disturbance
of his privacy, he bowed to the decision of the House of Commons.
The Prince's Bow, and the Beaufort Bow were—and Mr. Punch's Bow
is—among the Marvels—the Buccleuch Bow shall henceforth take its
place among gracefulnesses. Other lords talked, but not over wisely,
and so, it sufficeth to say that the important feature in the Bill is now
officially declared safe-safe it of course, in fact, was from the moment
Mr. Punch's eagle eye fell on the dispute. -
CAPTAIN GRANT says that he has improved Army Cooking, and the
House, by a majority of one only, supported the Government in its
decision not to give him any more money than reimbursed his experi;
ment expenses. ... But the monovote has obtained him an official
rehearing. MR. MILNER GIBson does not consider that railway engine-
drivers, who are very highly paid for their skilled labour, and who,
if º work extra hours, do so voluntarily and for extra pay, have
any claim to the attention of Parliament. MR. GLADSTONE has the
same idea in reference to the Postmen, whose complaints SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER brought up. The CHANCELLOR of The ExchEQUER thinks
that they are very well paid, considering that they are of “a low class”
of men, and have nothing in the way of brain-work to do except see
that they knock at the door indicated on the letter, and moreover, are
better º than the Policeman, who has every kind of work to do, from
the fighting seven Irishmen at once, to the directing a Mossoo from
Bethnal Green to Belgrave Squarrr.
MR. CHARLEs, PEIHAM WILLIERs, President of the Poor Law Board,
then brought in his Bill for relieving the distress in the Manufacturing
Districts. The relief is confined to Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the
plan is to work out the noble old plan of the Elizabethan statesmen.
A parish overweighted by poor rate is to be able to call on the Union,
and an over-weighted Union is to be able to call on other Unions. MR.
Bouverie, who formerly held the same office, did not think that a case
had been made out for such a Bill, The House of Commons thought
otherwise. The Bill was introduced, and was debated on º night,
and read a Second Time, the Committee being fixed for the following
Monday. It is at present forbidden to England to mediate between
those whose fratricidal strife is the cause of the distress, but at least it
is permitted to her to interpose between starvation and those who have
hitherto bravely borne the hardest form of sorrow.
Hednesday. A small attempt by MR, HADFIELD at an interference
with the law of judgments having been pronounced “most objection-
able” by the Attorney-GENERAL, and MR. HADFIELD being snuffed
out, it was proposed to go into Committee on the Night. Poaching Bill.
A regular row ensued. There is a large majority in favour of some
such measure, but the minority is strong and determined. ... So the
House went at it hammer and tongs. The same disruption of parties,
to which Mr. Punch has before alluded, occurred. "LoRD STANLEY
opposed the Bill as bad, and also impolitic, MR. BAss, on the other
hand supported it, owning birds as § as beer, and MR. NEwdegate,
a keen sportsman, wished the Bill made more moderate. The scene in
the House was edifying, and the noise made by some of the antagonists

was preternatural. Nevertheless, there was a majority of 90 for fº

70 on other fights, and the battle was renewed on the next evening
when the Committee fought over the First Clause.till three in the

Thursday. Bills pass as fast as cabs after the opera. A little Diyorge

collusion cases, gave LoRD REDEspalº (motº? Equabiliter et Dili.

angry Diligence in abusing the new system of Divorce. Living at Bats-
ford, he is rather shortsighted. - - - -
Sir George GREY promised a Bill, next year, for abolishing Metro-
olitan turnpikes. . So these, nuisances will be done away, and that
}. at a pike which might be named, who keeps had half-crowns to
change for the good ones tendered to him, and bullies until he gets
good money for bad, had better look out for a new ocºupation; sºlº
thing highly genteel in the garotting line Punch would suggest. Mr.

Rogougi (motto, Compositiºn jusfasque animi) not only wishes to Unite
Íaw And Equity but also to unite complete safety for England with
judicious economy. He seemed to disapprove of the outlay for our
Educational army of “3000 stalwart men and strong-minded women.”
He was also good º to give some excellent advice to the EMPEROR
of The FRENCH. The DUKE of SoMERSET (motto, Foy pour devoir)
declared that the Navy was conducted upon principles of the strictest
economy, and the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE (motto, Dieu et mon Droit)
was of course instructed to say the same for the Army. ... LoRD MAl-
MESBURY (motto, Ubique patriam reminisci) did not doubt the EMPEROR,
but the French of the Future. EARL. GREY (motto, Ile bon pouloir
servir le roy) served the country by showing ill-will generally, and EARL
RussBLL (motto, Che sara sara) believed that what will be will be, but
that if we have a good militia and home resources, and defend our
arsenals we have little else to fear. The Bill was read a Second Time.
. In the Commons there was an interesting Canadian debate, in which
divers great guns discharged themselves. Šº GEORGE LEwis thought
that there was no immediate danger of hostilities with the Northern
States of America, for though they were awfully riled at our recognising
the South, as lº they would see that we could do nothing
else, especially as the North did the same by not treating the Southern
vessels as pirates. . It was intimated that we had sent all the men to
Canada whom we intended to send, and that it would be well for that
Cº. to take note of the fact.
A dialogue between MR. C. BENTINck and MR. CowPER on the
Parliamentary Frescoes brought the week’s discussions to an end.
MEssRs. MacLise, Cope, and WARD received unqualified praise. MR.
HERBERT's delay in º: his work was attributed to his honour-
able anxiety to make it as perfect as possible; but MR. Dyce, who has
had all his money, but has not done his work, and is keeping the QUEEN
out of the robing-room, was not quite, so politely spoken of, though
MR. CowPER, like the nobleman in Love's Labour Lost—
“Chides the Dyce in honourable terms."

more appropriate citation.
A SWELL’S COMPLAINT.

noble extraction—you will

ºf take it for granted that you
are tremendously aristo-
cratic, and that you will
sympathise with me in the

press.
“What a very disgusting
thing it is that we resort to
the lowest class for all our
slang phrases and other as-
sistance to wit. Upon my
– life, it is not exactly to the
credit of Swelldom that no
word that ever becomes
popular can be traced to the
gilded saloons and all that,
but comes from the public
house, or the prison, or the
cabstand, or some such low
quarter. Iremember no ex:
ception, since his lamented
Grace the DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON certainly made

of the day.
“The statement in reference to universal serenity, the inquiry as to
the information possessed b one's mamma as to one's absence from
home, the intimation that a lodging was not open to a person named
MR. FERGusson, the expression of disbelief comprised in the mention
of the name of Mr. Wºrker, the ironical demand whether you are
not anxious to obtain the matter in question, the suggestion for placing
your friend's decision in the tube that contains lighted tobacco, the
semi-classical reference to the sinister shoulder, the apocryphal corrup-
tion of Mihi et, Beate Martine, the allusion to the symbol of mourning
encircling the hat, the solicitation to use a hatchet upon the organ of
sight, the direction to cease conversation (evidently the mere, order to
close a shop) are all, as their very nature shows, phrases taken from
the inferior orders. Yet, how large a pºli. they have in their
time gained among us, and indeed but for them how many lively youn
gentlemen (swells-even that word is a thief’s term) would have small
claim to wit. And this senseless ‘Any other Man’ is, I understand, a
mere catchword of some black-faced buffoon at a singing house.
“Don’t you think, Sir, that it would be to the credit of the class to
which you and I belong, if the Aristocracy would invent something
od, and save us from the humiliation of owing all our fun to the
ower orders?

“CoRIOLANUs Cocky.”
THE UNDERPAID POSTMEN.
Nobody can possibly be underpaid by any payment which he chooses
to accept. The only way in which anybody can be underpaid is by
paying him less than the sum that he was engaged for. These are the
reasons why the present pay of the postmen is not, as SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER maintains, inadequate; and they also demonstrate that 98.
a week is enough for a Dorchester labourer. But the labour-market is
the labour-market, and, by leave of MR. GLAnsroNE, what is sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander. The country would be right, if it
would be safe, in taking the lowest bidder for the office of CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER. "It might obtain a statesman of sufficient ability
to frame an equitable scheme of taxation on reasonable terms.
In a certain sense, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the post-
Inell are º: A postman cannot keep a carriage and an opera-
box, or send his son to Eton, on 18s. or even.50s, a week: he cannot
afford Lafitte, or even MR. GLADstone's smallest claret. He is paid
more than a policeman; but what is that to the purpose?. It may prove
not that the postman is paid better, but only that the policeman is paid
worse. Considered as a human being with an appetite for turtle and
venison, a relish for champagne, a love of splendour, and an admirer of
female beauty, how very few people are sufficiently paid! Think how
scantily a soldier or a sailor is paid. Yet he takes º he can get, and
the nation gives him as little as it prudently can. So tailors sweat
their journeymen, and man-milliners cut their needlewomen down. ..It
is all right; but the defenders of their country, as well as the needle-
women and the stitching tailors, are sadly underpaid in proportion to
their capacity for enjoyment. According to this standard all public
servants are deplorably underpaid, except some of the upper servants,
: the Bishops, the great Law Officers, and the Ministers of the
rown.
Neck Deus Intersit.
The American War is now virtually over, and we can only ask why
it was not put a stop to sooner. The Senate has stepped in at last, and
effectually finished the business by a simple enactment. All the Con-
federates were to lay down their arms in sixty days, and all who did not
were to be hanged as rebels. The Federal Government has but to carry
out this law, and there is an end of the struggle. How very odd, that
nobody thought of this earlier! However, never too late to mend the
Union, even with a rope.

MoRAL. It is better when you have a difference with a Cabman, to give him your Card, and let him Summon you.
THE, FoRENsic school. For slander.
WHILST the Press must not call a rogue a rogue, the Bar in its wig
and gown, is privileged to libel anybody as much as it likes. Mr. Punch
has always thought that there ought to be some limit to the lies and
slander which counsel are permitted to utter on behalf of their clients.
SIR. C. CREsswell appears to be of the same opinion on this point with
Mr. Punch. In the Court of Probate and Divorce, the other day, was
tried a suit for dissolution of º: and damages; SPEDDING (clerk)
2. SPEDDING and LANDER. On behalf of the defendant, according to
Law report:-
“DR. WAMBEY addressed the Court in mitigation of damages. This was the first
time a clergyman of the Church of England had come forward, without blushing, to
ask a jury to appraise his honour, or to avail himself of the action for criminal con-
yersation, an action which an eminent judge had declared to be a disgrace to our
law and manners. The probability was, that DR. LANDER was as much the seduced
as the seducer; and if the jury gave the reverend gentleman 2,000 farthings it
would be 1,999 too many."
In summing up, however, SIR. C. CREsswell, said:—
“There certainly could be no reason why a clergyman in a humble station in the
church, who had been left to bring up a family without the assistance of his wife,
should blush to ask damages of the º: who had deprived him of her society.
They might rather ask whether the adulterer ought not to blush, when for the sake
of saving his money he instructed his counsel to vilify the woman he had debauched?
The co-respondent was not present, but he (SIR. C. CREsswell) could not help look-
ing to see whether the learned doctor who represented him did not blush when he
put forward such an argument. (A laugh.) e learned doctor had resorted to the
3. low, vulgar, and miserable cry that it was the woman who had been the
ucer.”
Counsel engaged in defending a blackguard before SIRC. CREsswell,
or any other judge who is both a judge and a gentleman, will perhaps
in future beware how they obey their client's instructions to the extent
of resorting to a common, low, vulgar, and miserable cry, and venting
calumnies which they know to be falsehoods that have been fabricated
by him or his attorney, if not by themselves. If their impudence can
stand the rebuke of a judge, their self-interest º ſet mind the
decision of a jury. The jury in the case above-cited, believed so much
of what the advocate for the co-respondent asserted, that they found a
verdict for the petitioner, with £1,000 damages. Hence at least gen-
tlemen of the long robe and lax principles may derive a warning to take
some heed of the service for which they let their ºf. and not
befoul their venal mouths with unscrupulous abuse, to the sole end of
prejudicing the cause which they have to plead, and obtaining an
adverse verdict.
MILITARY MERIT REWARDED.
WHAT did SIR. G. C. LEwis mean by the subjoined argument, which,
if correctly reported, he urged against GENERAL, LINDsay's motion for
requiting the services rendered to the public by CAPTAIN GRANT, in
the invention of cooking apparatus and improvement of cookery for the
Army 2–
“CAPTAIN GRANT had already been compensated for all the expenses he had
incurred. He was originally on full pay and was now on half-pay, and he could not
therefore be said to be unremunerated for his services.”
SIR. G. C. LEwis's logical abilities oblige us to suspect that there
must be some mistake in the last sentence. Should it not have been
“He was originally on half-pay and was now on full pay. That
readin º 18 º: by the deduction which follows—"Therefore
he could not be said to be unremunerated for his services.” To remu-
nerate an officer by reducing him to half-pay is to grant him the remu-
neration which was awarded to CoLoREL BENTINck. Is the improve-
ment of army cookery and culinary, apparatus, a service of the same
nature as that of bullying and intimidating an officer? The remuneration
. consists in reducing a man's wages looks rather like the reward
of demerit.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
AFTER trying three and twenty different schemes for seeing the
Exhibition systematically, I have come to the conclusion, in a very
Dundreary-like humour, that it is one of those things no fellow can
accomplish unless it be some one of indomitable patience and a
regular “grinding” organ of Individuality, as for instance the ingenious
editor of BRADSHAw's Railway Guide, the Perpetual “Grand Vice ’’ of
the Statistical Club, or one of those painstaking gentlemen who always
know how to do everything better than anybody else. As for me, I
roam through the World's Fair as I should like to do through the
world itself, somewhat carelessly—taking things as I find, them—hard-
ware, machinery, fine arts, food and clothing, silks and velvets, woollen
and worsted—each and all are interesting in their way, from the rudest
fabric of New Zealand to the latest conceit from Sèvres. I wander
about the great building, I say, note-book in hand, as becomes your
faithful correspondent, on shilling days and half-crown days, and meet
a score of worthies who wag their heads knowingly, and suppose I am
registering jokes by the hundred. Only the other morning I encountered
LADY MARESNEST (widow of the celebrated civic functionary of that
name) who, observing me examine some mineral products with atten-
tion, thought fit to twit me about getting up an article for Punch.
“Good Heavens, M'am,” I said, “what fun can Imake out of arsenical
mundic? Do you suppose there is a vein of humour running through a
Durham coal-field P” But that is the way with some unreasonable
people. I declare ever since I have had the honour of being connected
with your journal, I cannot make the commonest observation to certain
friends without its being, misconstrued, and the other day on asking a
young lady whether she had been to see BLONDIN yet, she replied, “Go
ong, you funny thing—do,” a sentence which I have since vainly
attempted to interpret.
Having heard of the piping bullfinch in Switzerland, I made my
way to that department on Saturday last, and found a crowd of people
assembled round a little casket, where the automaton songster appears
to roost for five days in the week. “Aw! When ith he going to thing '"
asks some expectant swell with “Piccadilly weepers” of the most breezy
character and beautiful gamboge coloured gloves. “Toosdays and
Fridays,” answers policeman X, who has mentioned those days about
ten times over during the last minute. “Aw' Can't he lay an egg now
—or do thomething else to-day?” continues he of the whiskers. “Toos-
days and Fridays” repeats the peeler very sternly. “Aw'_Wewy well.
’Spose better turn up 'gain; ” and here our friend went off muttering
something about a “mons’ous baw.”
There must be something peculiarly attractive to our national taste
in the ascent of high places. I never met an Englishman at Rouen who
did not want to mount the cathedral flèche, nor, at Florence but he
must go to the top of GIOTTo's tower. So in the International, our
countrymen are climbing up the Tasmanian wood trophy, and insist on
swarming into the revolving lantern from morn till sunset. Luckily
there is no staircase to the Domes, or I am convinced there would be a
shower of ačrolites in the shape of pocket flasks and catalogues falling
from the hands of enthusiasts on our devoted heads below. As it is
we sit in peace under the shadow of the Liristona Borbonica, and
listening to MENDELsoHN's famous Wedding March as the music rolls
forth from the pipes of WALKER's organ, we can see in one comprehen-
sive glance Zolverein and Hanse Towns, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland
and France represented under one capacious roof. I look up the S.W.
transept, and round its huge window see inscribed these words:—
“DEUS IN TERRAM RESPExIT ET IMPLEVIT ILLAM Bonis suis.”
What a cheerful homily might be preached on that text—what a grate-
ful . would assemble at such a shrine! hope the
reverend gentleman who is destined to occupy that beautifully carved
pulpit from Louvain will remember where it has so long been standing,
and shape his first discourse accordingly. If there be sermons in stones,
how much more in the countless wonders we see around us here?
“Impletić illam Bonis suis,” and yet DR. MAw-wortME would have us
believe that everything is hateful, ici-bas / I think this world seems to
each of us—what we make it, and whenever I hear a man sigh over its
º, I fancy he must have been some time grubbing in the soil
himself.

... An ingenious German exhibits some drawings and statuettes to
illustrate his theories about the growth of that interesting animal—
Man—from the age of fifteen to three hundred months, showing what
;. we ought to be at various stages of our life. Like most of the
philosophical propositions emanating from Waterland, this seems a little
far-fetched, and how our statistical friend could have arrived at his
average without separately studying the various effects of climate,
parentage, gymnastics and premature grog–to say nothing of such
exceptions as ToM THUMB and the Cremorne giant—it would puzzle
anyone to imagine. For my part, having completed my 300th month,
and standing, as I do, about sixty-five inches in my Balmorals, I am
disinclined to believe in any standard but that which Nature and my
bootmaker designed for me.
Qne, cannot help being struck in strolling through the various courts
with the great display of candles–English, French, and German—
“short sixes,” “long fours,” and “double wicks,” wax, tallow, and com-
posite, piled up in all directions. One grand columnar trophy of this
description bearing the inscription of Apollo KERzeN UND SEIFEN,
leaves, us in doubt, whether the soap and candles referred to are named.
after the god of light or whether the firm which supplies them is really
that of Apollo and Sun.
I don’t much care for French art as applied to manufacture. Most
of the articles in the S.W. court which ladies admire as “elegant and
tasteful,” are the silliest gim-cracks ever seen. There is the old leaven
of the last, century about them—the spirit of Roccoco with its shep-
herds and shepherdesses, its perverted shapes and misplaced ornament.
I saw a huge carpet representing an episode in the life of NAPOLEON
THE THIRD, and although, where that potentate is concerned, no one
knows what may be upon the tapis, I must submit that rugs are not fit
vehicles for pictorial illustration. Our English schools of design are
attended by better results. I preſer HART's and HARDMAN's metal
work to GAUTIER's bronzes, ºf MINTON's majolica to modern Sèvres,
It is in classes 20 and 24 that our Gallic friends are stronges, and
when I lead my beloved Unknown to the hymeneal altar she shall don
the silks of M. M. SAvoy E AND RAVIER, and wear one of CHEvaLIER's
priceless veils.
ELIXIRS OF LONG LIFE.
MUCH valuable information on the Art of Prolonging Life may
perhaps be derived from HUFELAND and FLOURENs, but by far the
most eligible way of attaining to a good old age is indicated in the
subjoined extract from the Times relative to Duke PAsquier, who
has just departed this life at that of 96.
“THE VIRTUEs of A Good DINNER.—The fashionable Paris journal Le Sport
mourns over the death of DUC PASQUIER as an irretrievable loss to the lovers of
good dinners. He was remarkable for his hospitality, and was particularly fond of
having at his table three times in each week members of the Académie Française,
and was known at “la fourchette d'or. His dinners were remarkable for their
taste. . He was fond of good living, and attributed his long life to his alimentation.
He looked upon the digestion as the centre of all the affections, feelings, and ideas.
He presided over the organisation of his kitchen himself, leaving the manipulation
to a female. ... His excellent dinners were said to have had much influence during
his Ministry.”
Biography, in the foregoing paragraph, is gastronomy teaching by
es. Öd CoRNARo dieted himself, and so it seems did old Pas-
QUIER, but on a more scientific and much preferable principle. CoRNARO
put himself on low diet, eating nothing that could hurt him; PASQUIER
on full, ºf care that all, he ate should do him good. As to old
PARR, with whose name certain Life Pills are associated, it is probable
that he owed his length of days to taking no pills nor any other medicine
and to not eating any delicious Revalenta Arabica Food instead, for #
in his time there had been any food of the kind to eat, it would have
done him no good, and certainly there were no such pills to swallow:
LoRD BYRoN mentions early rising as conducive to longevity, and
pleasantly tells you that you may
“When coffin'd at fourscore,
Engrave upon your plate you rose at four.”
PASQUIER was coffined at fourscore and sixteen, and his executors
might have engraved upon his plate, which ought to have been a dinner
plate, that he dined at seven, or whatever was his dining-hour, and
used always to have the best dinner that he could obtain. fºurg
PASQUIER appreciated the importance of digestion. He knew that—
excuse the variation of a cherished couplet–
“Sauces and spice, and all meats nice,
Are what the greatest men are made of."
Our food turns into our blood, our blood into our solid substance,
including our brain, and as our brains are, so are our minds. Mentally
and bodily our quality depends upon what we eat and drink. The
digestion is, as PASQUIER believed, the centre of all the affections,
feelings, and ideas. There we consume the fuel that works the whole
machine. Let us mind how we stoke ourselves. In PASQUIER's long
life we see the fruits of good living. We should endeavour to follow
his admirable example. Let us preside over the organisation of our
kitchens ourselves, and leave only the manipulation to a female. What
is to hinder us from adopting that salutary system but the want of time
and means? But so it is, unfortunately with some of us, whose best
and wisest resolutions are frustrated by an excess of occupation and
a deficiency of £ s. d, . Happy is he who can afford to be his own head
cook. It is in no witch's kitchen that the elixir of life is brewed.
Every gentleman can concoct it in his own.

DIVERSIONS OF DRILL,

AN OVATION TO AN AMBASSADOR.
AccorDING to a news letter from Rome:—
“At Frascati the national party offered an ovation to Count Kis-
SELºrf, Russian Minister, on the occasion of the recognition of the
kingdom of Italy by the Cabinet of St. Petersburg.”
. The statement that certain persons offered a man an ova-
tion is something new in the phraseology of penny-a-lining.
It is generally said that So-and-so ... or that his
admirers gave him, an ovation. That may mean that the
|. gave him a p.": with stale eggs, as we have
efore suggested. Even at Rome the Romans themselves
would now no longer decree an ovation or minor triumph to
a general ſor having gained a small victory, that is to say,
if they had any generals of their own to honour; though
they would doubtless be ready enough to give any one of
the generals who dragoon them under the Pope an ovation
of the other kind. Such an unsavoury ovation as that,
however, is not the sort of ovation which the liberal Frasca.
tians could º have offered to Count KissELEFF on
the strength of the recognition by Russia of the Italian
Kingdom, or indeed to anybody on any account whatever,
because it is an ovation which eve {j would decline.
The ovation offered by them to the R.H., Minister must
have been one which they expected that his Excellency
would accept; a savoury not an unsavoury ovation: per-
haps it was a savoury omelet.

PURITANS AND PLAYERS.
(From the “Quarterly Review” for August, 1885.)
THE Bicentenary Celebration of 1862 by which (as we showed at the
time) the Dissenters of all classes, in imitation of the Pope of RQME,
sought to consolidate their forces, was productive of the most brilliant
results, and did great honour to the prescience of the farsighted M1ALL,
WAUGHAN, and BRIGHT. In a few years their triumph was complete,
and the Church of England was reformed, church organs were destroyed,
the beadle was i.e.: in decent black, and prayer-books ceased, to be
adorned with velvet and § Perhaps, had the new Puritan Fathers
stopped here, there would not have been much to complain of, but the
intolerant spirit broke out into violence, and, as in old days, ruthless
war was waged against all who differed from the fierce bigots in power.
As heretofore, the poor Player was the victim of the persecuting
Puritan. In spite of the intercession of the benevolent but feeble
LoRD EBURY, This now tyrannical allies proclaimed war against the
Theatres. ShakspeaRE, SHERIDAN, KNow LEs, and TALFOURD were
for a time allowed to be performed, but all lighter representations were
suppressed. MIAIL himself, hymn-book in hand, rushed upon the stage
of the Lyceum at the thousand and second representation of Peep o'Day,
and with a savage joke made, as he said, “shipwreck of FALCONER.”
DR. WAUGHAN, attended by a violent mob offmatical young students
from Homerton, broke into the Princess's Theatre during a performance,
and though for a moment delayed by the belief that Mr. Kººs was
reaching, they no sooner discovered that the Corsican Brothers was
eing played, than they rushed upon the stage, scattered the affrighted
actresses, and even the tears of CARLOTTA LECLERCQ only so far
softened the rugged schismatics as to permit her and her sister-per-
formers to º unharmed on condition of their immediately Å.";
the Abimelec º Union. At the Haymarket, Bubbles of
the Day was attempted, but BRIGHT suddenly entered, and with the
voice of CROMwFLL (at whom he now dressed) he cried, “Take away
those Bubbles.” The gallant LoRD DUNDREARY, as became a Cavalier
of long descent, drew a pistol, and but that his habitual unacquaintance
with technicalities made him fire it into the ceiling instead of at the
tyrant the triumph of the latter might have been brief, had not the
Earl also forgotten to put in any bullet. The hardships sustained by
some of the actors were very sad. The Adelphi theatre was seized by
SPURGEON, who contumeliously offered MR. PAUL BEDFORD (with a
flippant jest at his Christian name, after the manner of Elephant Chapel)
the place of clerk, but the brave actor punched his head, likened him
to PUNSHON, and escaped. Less fortunate was MR. Toole, who was
consigned to, the Tabernacle Museum, and compelled to explain
Otaheitan idols and other heathen curiosities, to the penny visitors,
for nearly eight years, when he sprang out of window into a hay-
cart, and was carried into South, Wales. MR. Robson was brought
before the Court of Star Chamber, (an odious memory revived in
honour of MR. BRIGHT's paper,) and commanded to assume a real
Porter's Knot, and *R*, from Clapham to Islington. . The fine
elocutionary powers of MRs. STIRLING were made a pretext for setting
her to teach reading to a wretched school class, where Miss Louis A
PYNE was also sent to instruct, the jeering urchins in DR. WATTs’s
Songs. MR. BUCKSTONE vowed a revenge, and, affecting to be con-
vinced of the error, of his ways by the arguments of DR. WAugHAN
succeeded in so far blinding his persecutors that they actually allow:
him to address a crowded attendance of the Band of Hope and Juvenile
Abstainers, when he suddenl º the “Country Fair,” threw his
audience into convulsions, and sent home a thousand youthful mission-
aries to clamour in their households for reasonable recreation. For
this offence Buckston E was set in the pillory, but the *::: pelted
him with roses, and cast bonbons into his mouth with affectionate
precision, of aim, Mº. Boucicaulº, haying joined the Baºists, was
permitted for , some time, to give the "Water ºre Senº under a
pretext that he was teaching the doctrine of his new sect, but his
underhand device did not prosper, and, the theatre was taken by the
Board as a place, for practising the lungs and oratory of youthful
reachers. The Dramatic Authors would no doubt have equally suf-
ered, only there were none, a machine having been invented and

exhibited at the International Show of 1872 for taking the plot and dialogue out
of a novel, without the aid of a pen, and the general diffusion of the French
language, consequent upon the French Treaty, having, enabled managers to adopt
the plan of MR. VINCENT CRUMMLEs, and give out the originals of the English
dramas to the performers. The hatred of the ºf Union to the drama was
however, manifested in every possible way, and woe to the unfortunate little child
who, having heard from an elder companion of the glories of Fairy Spectacle or
the fun of Christmas Pantomime, ventured to express in the , presence of a
Puritan an innocent wish to behold such things—assuredly the Solomonian
counsel was not forgotten. Such were among the results of trusting to the
moderation of Sectarianism. -
SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS OF THE WEEK.
ASTRONOMICAL.
=--
-
N Monday, the President in
the Chair. _A paper by
HERR Won ORBITz on the
Utilisation of Comets was
read, the author contending
that by the attaching salte
wires to their tails and con-
necting them with ships,
-
might be largely assisted.
Mr. PEEPONIGHT laid on
the table some beautiful
saucers of Star Dust, and
PROFEssoR NUBILUs, of
Leipsic, a large piece of the
Perihelion of Mercury. MR.
Owls reported on some
analytical tests which he
had applied to liquid from
the Milky Way, which he
stated, to be strongly fla-
voured with turnips. A
memorial from the Great
and Little Bears, repre-
senting that they were not
like bears at all, and solicit:
ing more appropriate and
pleasing names, was read,
and referred to a select
committee. A discussion
ensued on the proposed
formation of a Lunar Al-
pine Club, and it was men-
tioned that a site for a
club-house had been, pro-
cured in the neighbour-
hood of Hanwell. MR.
- GLADSTONE's resolution for
compelling Shooting Stars to take out licences was generally condemned.
ZOOLOGICAL.
Tuesday. The President in the Chair. It was officially announced that the
Phoenix, which has been so great an attraction during the season, had finally made
up its mind to burn itself on Sunday the 10th, and as the bird is of an exclusive
character, Fellows were requested to be very particular as to the persons to whom
they gave orders for that day. The health of the large Whale was stated to be
satisfactory, but the small one is melancholy and seems always going to blubber.
MR. C. TATIUs suggested that the absence of the PRINCE of WALEs from this
country might have ...; to do with it. MR. MEEKE complained that some-
body, really ought to look after the tigers, which now went, about loose, several
members of his family having been eaten in the course of the last fortnight. It
was promised that this should be seen to, and yery gratifying accounts were given
of the condition of these beautiful animals. The lamprey pond was not thriving,
and an interesting discussion arose as to the best means of feeding these fastidious
fish. MR. Cotton WALTON recalled the fact that one of the Roman Emperors fed
his lampreys with slaves, and the honourable Fellow in the most liberal manner
offered his boy-in-buttons for the experiment. A vote of thanks to him (MR. C.
WALTON) was recorded.
GEOLOGICAL.
Wednesday. The President in the Chair. ... MR. MUDpleby, on his admission
as a member, read a *. on Primitive Trap, and showed a drawing which
exhibited the trap as a brick supported by a thread on which pease were strung,
and the mouse biting the thread brought the brick down upon him. As there
seemed some mistake, the member was thrown out of window. A paper on the
Use of Basalt for pickling purposes was read, as also some Studies on the Marbles
of our great schools, and the iety engaged in ring-taw and other experiments
for testing the comparative forces of the Alley and the Commoner. Some thunder-
bolts found on Mount Olympus were exhibited, and the eagle's clutch was clearly
sailing in , Great Circles|P
traceable in their centre, as were the marks of fulminating
powder at the extremity. A somewhat animated debate
then arose upon the possibility of fracturing white marble
in rhomboids, and several members produced hammers
and proceeded to demolish their host’s most beautiful and
elaborately carved mantel-piece, just erected, in order to
demonstrate their theory, but in spite of some severe
observations to the effect that all ought to give way to
science, the noble owner resisted, .# the meeting, sepa-
rated in no very good temper.
GEOGRAPHICAL.
Thursday. The President in the Chair. M.R. DEscARTEs
§: a map which he had drawn of the interior of
adagascar, but it being elicited in discussion that he had
never been there, and had composed the map from imagi-
nation, it was directed that the expenses of engraving it
should not at present be incurred. CAPTAIN FLUELLEN
read a paper on the Subterranean Confluence of the La
Plata and the Don. , MR. GURGITY, then brought forward
his motion on the Maelström, and expressed his strong
conviction that it was the duty of the Society to throw
iſ itself heart and soul into that whirlpool, and remove the
reproach to science that we know nothing about the bottom
of it. He should have been happy to lead the exploring
arty, but had a particular * elsewhere, but he
invited, members to sign and bind themselves to go down.
We did not observe that the invitation was complied with.
The Secretary regretted to say that a person whom he had
sent to ascertain the depth of Pen Park Hole, supposed
fathomless, had either Fº down it, or had spent the
money elsewhere; at all events he had furnished no report.
It was agreed that the Secretary himself be directed to
descend the chasm, and iſ possible, to attend at the next
meeting with the particulars.
STATISTICAL.
Friday. The President in the Chair. MR. Cocker read
a paper showing that out of 121,374 persons who passed
through Trafalgar Square every day, 119,187 made offensive
observations about the No Lions. MR. DUMDIDDY pro-
duced his promised paper as to the number of persons
who were asleep in London at half-past 11 p.m., and also as
to the number that breakfasted in bed, but the member
having unfortunately left the page with the figures upon
it at his own residence, no immediate result was obtained.
MR. LYNX adduced statistics which clearly showed that
there are 7951 panes of glass in Upper Baker Street (not
counting the lamps), and that it would take 59,311 Scotch-
men, of average º: and laid at full length on the road,
to reach from Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, to Primrose Hill.
The hon, member was highly complimented for his zeal.
SIR NAFIER BONEs then read an interesting paper, in which
he stated that out of the 658 members of Parliament, 267
wore white hats, and of these 92 had black bands round
them, and that the average of persons who, on fine Sunday
afternoons, lie down in the Parks to those who stand up, is
23:30. , PROFEssoR W. WIMBLE regretted that, he had not
been able to do much since the last meeting, but he had
counted the people who went, by his house on the tops of
omnibuses in one day, and had ascertained that 62 per
cent. of them wore no gloves.
THEOLOGICAL.
Saturday. The President in the Chair. The REv. Ig-
NATIUs BLAzes produced some of the charred faggots of
the pile at which SERVETUs was burned. SIGNOR Fuoco
exhibited a photograph of the edict in revocation of that
of Nantes. MR. White HEET showed one of the poniards,
and an arquebuss, used at the Massacre of St. Bartholo-
mew. MR. LAFEU displayed a beautiful model of the
Martyrs’ Memorial at Oxford. MR. GRILLUM read a paper
on the Anabaptists of Munster, and the iron cage of John
the Prophet, adding a well merited compliment to SIGNOR
TAMBERLIk for his masterly personation of the unfortu:
nate fanatic. The Rev. Mr. EMBERs brought an original
copy of the Act of Uniformity, MR. IGNiss read some
extracts from the tyrannical ordinances of the Puritan
Fathers, MR. DE LAWA showed a portrait of ARchbishop
LAUD, and MR. FYER BRAND exhibited photographs of
MR. MIALL and DR, WAUGHAN.

DISCOUNTING ONE'S MARBLE.
WE read in the Bath Chronicle that in the Abbey
Cemetery (which we take not to be exactly the place
where ACREs thought there was “snug lying”)
a citizen of Bath has erected unto himself a tombstone,
upon which he has recorded all that is usually placed
there, .# a blank for the day of his demise. And
this memorial by anticipation the brave Bath brick occa-
sionally visits and reads. We do not hear whether he
has indulged himself, in epigraphic eulogy, but why
should he not do so?. He must know himself better
than anybody else can know him, and may speak of his
own virtues with, the calmness of certainty, whereas
his executors, could only guess at them. Let him put
up “R.I.P.”, whether that, mean Respected in the
Parish, or as in Roman Catholic inscriptions, implies an
unpleasantly warm operation undergone in the inter-
mediate state. Or stay. Why not take the other line P
He is a strong-minded man, and not afraid to rebuke
Tombstone flatteries. We have not the slightest or
faintest idea who he is, and therefore cannot annoy
him by our wildest supposition. Let us suppose him
a Humbug. . His decorous executors may or may not
know the fact, but certainly will not allege it, vid chisel
and hammer. What a splendid moral lesson he might
read—thus:–
Here Lies
What is Mortal of
PIGGE DE BLADUD, ESQ.,
Of this City,
He had a bad temper and a good wig:
He knew which side his bread was buttered:
He was thought rich, and undeceived nobody:
Hence he was feared admired, respected, and made
hurchwarden. And
Dying on the Blank day of Blank - *
And . to ; behind him,
Is now called an awful old Humbug,
And does not care a farthing what he is called.
Now, there would be true courage in a man who
should put up anything of that sort, and we believe
(unless seeing Robert le Diable has made us super-
stitious) that the hypocritical tombstones around this
revelation would be ſound to have twisted round and
turned their backs upon such vulgar frankness. De
mortuis nil misi Werum, is a rule to which we have not
yet attained; but if the living took to writing their
own epitaphs, we might approach that wholesomeness.
At any rate we are obliged to our friend at Bath for
utting the notion into our minds, and in return we will
that it will be a good while (if such be his wish)
before the date is chiselled into the stone mentioned in
the Bath Chronicle.
AN ACT FOR THE INCLOSURE OF COMMONS,
COMMONLY TO BE CALLED PETER BELL’s ACT.
WHEREAs, on the petition of PETER BELL, of the County of Cum-
berland, Potter, this House hath resolved and determined and doth
hereby declare that a certain Flower of a Yellow Colour called a Prim-
rose, growing and blowing on the brim, brink, or margin of a river, is
a Yellow Primrose and nothing more, and further, that the said Prim-
rose, and all other flowers of whatsoever names and colours, growing
and blowing wheresoever, are only such, flowers of such names and
colours, and not any other things, except in as far as they may be used
and applied in the Arts and Sciences:
...And whereas the said Primroses, and other the like flowers, growing
wild, are for the most part either noxious weeds, or at least unservice.
able for the food of Man or Beast, and of no Use whatever except those
which, being Poisonous, are used in Medicine, the rest serving only to
º the vain fancies and conceits of unprofitable Writers and
oets :
And whereas there are and remain in divers
of Her \}.}}| UEEN, sundry and several Waste and Uncultivated
Tracts of Land called Commons, in derogation of the Name and Dig-
nity of this, House, being the Common Property of the neighbouring
People and belonging to no particular Person, and whereas the Produce
of the said Commons, besides Heath, Gorse or Furze, and Thistles
consists principally or entirely of the said Primroses and of other Wild
lowers, as Cowslips, Wiolets, Buttercups, Daisies, Dandelions and
Dog Roses:

And whereas Small (Children, and other Wagrants and Idle and
Disorderly Persons, are accustomed to roam, ramble, lurk, and wander
up and down and about the said Commons and squander and "...
their Time in Plucking and gathering, the said Primroses, Cowslips,
Dandelions, Dog Roses, and other Wild Flowers aforesaid: ...
And whereas it is expedient to Prevent such Waste and Mº.
ment of Time, and to turn such Commons and Waste Lands, if possib
to some Profitable Account, by clearing them as well of all Gorse or
Furze, Thistles, and Heath, as of Brambles, Bushes, Trees and Under-
wood, and by eradicating the said Primroses, and other Wild Flowers
aforesaid, on the said Commons or Waste Lands growing and blowing,
or lying rooted in the .."; the end that the same may be converted
into Arable, or Building Land, and either laid out and covered with
Bricks and Mortar, or p oughed or digged and spread with Manure:.
And whereas in cases wherein the said Soil is incapable of Cultivation
or unfit for Building Purposes it is desirable that the said Commons
should be converted into Game Preserves:
Be it therefore enacted, That the said Commons and Waste Places
shall all and each of them no longer be the Common Property of the
neighbouring People, that all existing rights of Common shall cease

Forests shall be, and are hereby, authorised and empowered to Sell the
said Lands to the Best Bidder, to the end that all the said Commons

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 9, 1862.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HE 28th July. Mon-
day. To EARL GREY,
upon our little China
ar, the DUKE QF
So MERs ET made
reply to the effect
that if we are to
have any commerce
with China, we must
help the Chinese
Government against
the Taepings. LORD
STRATFoRd DE RED-
cLIFFE approved the
answer, and there
the matter might
have ended.
EARL RUSSELL, con-
sidering that the
Session was nearly
over, and t he
should not have
many more chances
of , , distinguishin
himself this year, resolved that he would not avail himself of this
splendid opportunity of holding his tongue. So he went into a picture
; Chinese affairs. He said that the Government of . PRINCE. KUNG
was behaving very well to us, that our trade was growing, that in 1855
it was only £7,500,000, and in 1860 it was £18,000,000, and that there-
fore it was no light matter. , The Taepings were treacherous, blas;
phemous, and cruel, and though the Chinese were certainly a depraved
and degenerate people, the Government had shown great civilisation—
and the result, is that our gallant friend SHERARD QSBQRN (not
BERNAL, though his sire was intimately acquainted with china) is to be
sent off to smash, pound, and annihilate, any Taepings who come near
our Treaty Ports. We are sure he will cover himself with honours–
not so sure that we can cover LoRD Russell’s propositions with a
shield of logic, but the £18,000,000 answers the purpose better. . .
Who is the EARL or LEITRIM P He brought on something, which,
misprinted by, a contemporary, reads so ghastlily that, we were just
going to ring the bell for somebody to be in the room with us, when
we tried another paper:—
“A Bill to enable a coroner to raise from the parish the Body of a Murdered
Man-"
But upon examination it seemed that the omission of a couple of
words had brought in the horrors, and that the proposition was simply
ludicrous. It was to enable the coroner to raise from the parish in
which such a body might be found, compensation to the family of the
deceased, if you could find out who he was. This extraordinary pro:
posal could not obtain a seconder, and after LoRD GRENVILLE had
made considerable fun of LQRD LEITRIM, the Bill was squashed, and
serve him right for frightening Mr. Punch. . At the end of a London
season, one's mind is in the highest state of gladiatorial strength and
agility, but one's nerves are in the corres ºniº. degree sensitive, and
such paragraphs are not to be encountered with impunity. The moral
whereof is, no doubt, Labandon work, and get away to the Sea, and we
didn't expect to come to so agreeable an end of a paragraph beginning
with the EARL OF LEITRIM.
LoRD WENSIEYDALE has earned our good word. On the Juries'
Bill, he insisted on exempting Pharmaceutical Chemists from serving
on juries. This is quite right—the pharmaceutical chemist is a gentle-
man who ought not to be called away from his responsibilities. We
do not mean that everybody who sells corn plaster and soda water is to
plead exemption, as SIR.GEORGE GREy, rather pertly observed (when
fighting this clause, on Thursday) would next year be the case, but the
superior chemist is a very valuable practitioner, especially to the hum-
bler classes. , LoRD WENSLEYDALF's Clauses passed the Lords, and
being opposed by the Government down-stairs, was carried in defiance
of the said Government.
Another little Chinese debate, brought out, for the benefit of the
Commons, the same facts which had been paraded before the Lords.
SIR GEORGE Lºw Is spoke up for the Armstrong gun, and then there
was a prolonged discussion, in Committee, on the Bill for the relief of
the Operatives, and it was strongly urged that the measure was not
sufficient, and that the power of raising Loans should be granted.
LoRD PALMERSTON was sternly opposed to borrowing, but as will be
seen, had to give way, -
.The Night Poaching Bill was considered as amended, and Nine
divisions were taken upon various points, but the friends of the Bill
were victorious, in all cases. The struggle kept, the House up until
. three in the morning, which was in itself night-poaching, or
poaching the night's rest, in an inhuman manner.
But | Bill
Thesday. Hungerſord Market has had a pretty good innings. It was
built in 1680, but it did not prosper, and in 1720 we find that “Covent
Garden hath got the start, which is much resorted unto, and well served
with all fruits and herbs, good in their kind.” Rebuilt in 1831, the old
market had another chance, but people did not seem to have much love
for it, and its great merit was that it was a cool, dusky retreat, in a hot
day, while you were waiting for any Duchess who ha promised to pick
you up as she returned with the Duke from the House, and drive you
down to Richmond—there used also to be good shrub at the right-hand
public-hºuse at the end of the market. We know nothing of the penny
ices. All is swept away; while we write the place is one vast gap,
covered with white dust, from the Strand you can see the bridge that is
§. ºiſºn, and to-day the Charing Cross Railway Bill was read a
nd Time.
...And, Londoners and others, to-day the Embankment Bill was read a
Third Time and&: When shall we finish—nay, when shall we
bº. Riparian Operations?
To-day the Royal Assent was given to the Conveyancing Reform
Bill introduced by the CHANGELLoR, and also to the Declaration of Title
But the “permissive” character of the registration will make
the measures almost valueless except as a place for future leverage.
Said, not Mr. Punch that the attorney interest would be too strong
for the reſormers?
The º ht in Works of Art Bill is also law. Artists, you have
. or life, and seven years afterwards, but you must register
your rights.
jºi of interest in the Commons, save that MR. CowPER an-
nounced that as soon as the Show shuts, he shall shut the new road
agross the Park. He may do so if he likes, for it is horribly inconve-
nient, but he (or his successor) will have to make another, one of these
days, for Mr. Punch has been looking at a house near Victoria Gate,
and it is needless to say that should he take it, he is not going to be
#. round by Park Lane, or Silver Street, when he is coming to the
oliers.
SIR, MQRTON Peto, much lauded and
the, Myddleton fountain at Islington by MR. GLADstone, found out
that there are differences in audiences. He was discoursing wisely
upon Naval Reform, when the House was found to have gone away.
Wednesday. The Operatives Relief (or Rate in Aid) Bill came on
n, and MR. PULLER moved its recommittal, in order to introduce
clauses enabling the guardians to borrow money. MR: WILLIERs and
the Government resisted, were beaten by 95 to 88, and had to ask for
time to insert the suggested alteration. In the course of the debate
LORD PALMERSTON said this:—
“We know that in the county most fortunes have been made by the manufac-
turers. ... I do not agree with the Hon. Member for Stockport that it has all been
invested in the mills. On the contrary, they have accumulated much more than
their mills could have cost. There are enormous capitalists in the county—(Hear,

their gates, and anticipate worse distress as coming, have actually, for the sake of
rofit, sold and sent out of the country-cheery-the cotton which they ought to
ve used for the employment of the people. (Cheers.) I say, why are these people
to be exempt, and not be made to contribute to the distress which they see around
them? (Cheers.) They have ample means to do so.”

LoRD PALMERSTON as unjust, reckless, and incorrect, but gave notice

SIR John SHELLEY was heard on the Embankment, and now the
Bill is Law there is no reason why this exceedingly empty baronet
should not take an exceedingly empty room, and declaim on the subject
as long as he likes. He declared the whole scheme to be a “take in,”
and generally went on in the decorous style of a cabman who has seen
a fare carried off by his rival. If it were not too hot to get up and go
to the bookcase, we think we could find a passage in the works of his
relative, the SHELLEY, that would do substantive justice—but the ther-
mometer saves him. MR. CowPER º it him, however, rather
warmly, and told him that he, the Member for Westminster, had over-
looked the interests of his constituents in his regard for private interests.
This will be a good line for a placard at the next election.
Friday. The Lords read the Rate in Aid Bill (which had passed the
Commons that morning) a First Time, and had a little Cotton Debate,

entirely to private enterprise. The DUKE of ARGYLL thought cotton
could be grown almost everywhere, and hoped that there would be

plenty in a few years, an off-hand and pleasant way of disposing of a
question that threatened to be a Bore. - -
In the Commons there occurred just that sort of scene which will
sometimes happen to the discomfiture of a well-meaning host who has
assembled a family party at his country-house., All has gone tolerably
well during the days of the visit, and by dint of keeping certain relatives
apart, having pleasant excursions, bringing in neighbours to dinner, and
general watchfulness, any rumpus, has been avoided. But when the
rty is about to break up, and at the last breakfast, while the carriages
or the station are at the door, suppressed ill-nature breaks, out--some-
thing is said about the tea-service (which has been produced by mistake),
one thing brings on another, and there comes a jolly spiteful cross-
bombardment, in the course of which all sorts of rankling grievances are
frankly ventilated. That codicil to UNCLE BUNCKLE's will, never quite
understood, the lawyer's bill for SAMUEL's lease of the Grove, the dis-
appearance of the four miniatures, AMELIA and MARIA’s not having
been asked to, Louisa's wedding, the meanness of Cousin Epward
about the Brighton lodgings, the impertinence (of course not his own
idea, my love) of young FRED. DARLINGTON about MRs. PETER’s black
gown and bugles, the cheap school to which some people can send other
people's #. now that their nearest friends are in India, the readi-
ness of other persons to accept kindnesses they are in no hurry, to
return—all these agreeable things go flying and sputtering across the
table, and affectionate relations go away without shaking hands, and
forgiving one another only as Christians, and even forgetting to tip
the servants. - -
It was thought that the Session might end without any particular
row, but people under-estimated the vitality of ill-feeling. MR, COBDEN
had been snubbed much too often not to determine on giving the House
a piece of his mind, LoRD PALMERSTON is always ready for a fight, and
even the sweet nature of MR. DISRAELI did not prevent his taking the
last opportunity of saying a few amiable things. So there was a very
good go-in. The points taken by the three combatants were as follows:
MR. CoBDEN.
I am no party leader, but we must have party, and a party without
principles is a "nuisance.” - -
Let us Liberals look back to our principles.
|Here, say the papers, came a most doleful and melancholy." Ear,
ear!” from MR. ADFIELD. Everybody ...; and MR;
CoBDEN complimented the enemy of aitches on being the friend
of reforms.]
We write on our banners, Economy, Non-Intervention, Reform. . .
The present is the most extravagant government that ever existed in
peace time.
This is all LoRD PALMERSTON's fault. -
He is always interfering, and getting up sensations. . .
If the Liberals do not disentangle themselves from this system they
will “rot out of existence.” -
LoRD PALMERSTON knew that there would be no American war, and
the money spent on the Canada expedition had better have gone to
Lancashire. - -
But the fact is that the Tories keep him in office, and have more
confidence in him than in their own chief—they admit this in the
smoking-room.
He is puffed by a clever and noisy claque...
All the questions dear to Radicals and Dissenters have gone back-
wards, under his leadership. He says to the Tories, “I am not with
these low people, I sit here, but am doing your work.” -
This sort of thing must not go on next year. My friends, unite with
me in declaring that it shall not. -
would as soon have MR. DisRAELI in office.
LORD PALMERSTON.
MR. CoBDEN has not been rude and personal to-night.
His remarks will do me with the country.
We have no Reform Bill because the country does not want one, and
because MEssRs. BRIGHT and CoBDEN have weaned great numbers
from reform.
True economy does not mean not spending money, but spending
money wisely.
I have always done so, and have always been zealous for the honour
of the nation, and therefore the nation likes me.
I never interfered º -
here, was no proof that the Americans meant to act properly, and
we owed it to their Government to show that we were in earnest.
I think the ballot would be an immoral thing...
There is a large majority for the Night Poaching Bill. ... I have not
voted against it, and I am not going to “lose my sleep” in stopping
here for the purpose, under the circumstances, , . -
The state of parties has changed, the old “dualism” is impossible
and Governments cannot act upon the slavish and jobbing system of
buying unity of support by submission in conduct.
he present Government has carried a great many useful Acts in the
last three years.
The country is with us, and now that MR, CoBDEN has relieved his
mind, I hope he and his friends will reconsider their grievances, and
come back with different views.
MR. DISRAELI.
Counsel having been heard on both sides, allow me to be Judge, and
sum up.
. Government is in a painful position, and I don’t want to hasten its
inevitable decomposition.
But...LORD PAIMERSTON was enabled to throw out the Derbyites, on
condition (made at Willis's Rooms) of passing a democratic Reform Bill,
and extricating the country from its dangerous relations as to France.
. He has carried no Reform Bill, and we cannot tolerate his frivolous
jests and levity...I don't wonder the Liberals are disgusted at the
contempt with which he treats them.
Nonsense about MR. BRIGHT-he is frank enough, fatally so—it is
absurd to say that he hindered reform.
Then as to France. There are great misunderstandings with France
upºn, Italy, Mexico, America, and the Eastern question.
I do not think that LoRD Pºintenstonis insincere, but he has much
tact. But if the Liberals are cheated, that is their business. If he has
ñº satisfactorily, the verdict of the country will be with him.
as Ile ºf .
Qur financial prospects are dark and critical.
Qur fleet (he admits it) is in a most unsatisfactory condition.
His diplomacy has involved us in a new war with China.
The Treasury is at loggerheads with the Admiralty.
The Woods are at loggerheads with the Works.
The Indian Secretary is *:::::: the Indian Chancellor.
One Minister would cast off ada, the PREMIER would keep

There!, And having thus had it out, the great men were silent,
some small speeches were let off, five divisions were taken on the Night
Poaching, Bill, which was read a Third Time, and the House rose at
five minutes past four in the morning.
UNPARALLELED HONESTY.
Is the world really coming to an end? One would almost think so;
for only look at this advertisement in the Times of Thursday, July 24:
THE UMBRELLA TAKEN, by mistake, from a shop, in Fleet Street,
on the 21st July, was RETURNED the same afternoon, and left for the owner.
Comment is superfluous. A man who having taken an umbrella
“ by mistake” not merely returns it the same aſternoon, but goes to
the expense of advertising he has done so, is a being so angelic that his
mere existence leads us to agree with DR. CUMMING in believing the
Millennium is closely now at hand.
Proper Names :
WE trust the observation we are about to make will not provoke the
Yankees to declare war i. England, and if it does, we shall make
it, nevertheless. The belligerent parties in America should now be
designated—
South: SE-CEDERs.
North: RE-CEDERs 1 There !
Credit when it is Due.
WE see that MR. Cobbold has been asking the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER some questions about “Malt Credits.” As several of our
readers may not be profoundly versed in such matters, we beg to tell
them that there is only one form of “Malt Credit,” that, properly
jº , should go down with the public, and that is, the Credit
that Malt is entitled to when it is engaged in the brewing of good beer.
GAME PRESERVERS AND POACHERS,
SoME interesting, experiments on incubation have been tried by
certain country gentlemen who have been the most active in pressing
the Bill for the additional protection of Game. We may state that
many of these respectable 'squires have succeeded in hatching poached
eggs.

A PARALLEL CASE.
lf one may believe their newspapers (and nobody of course would
ever dare to doubt them) the Northerners are continually giving vent
to outcries against foreign intervention, and declaring that England has
no right to interfere, and protesting that France had better mind her
own business, and not meddle with a matter wherein she is not con-
cerned. Indeed to read what has been written, one would almost
think that intervention had begun, and that the Northerners had been
stopped from achieving any more of their glorious successes which look
so vastly like defeats. #. rumbling reminds one of the Yankee
conversation, which their Joe Nº. reports:–
“KrziAH. Ha dun neow kissin, Josh, be quiet du !
“Josn. Why, I'm not kissin' you.
“KEziAH. Wal, but ain't yer going tu !"
France and England, common sense and charity, justice and com-
passion, have not interfered as yet; but the Northern Apprehensiveness
seems mightily like wishing that they were “going tu.’

A GAMEKEEPER RATE WANTED.
AyLNG, proved ...of

een proposed to

the House in its

that the Govern-
ment is sensibly

ate, the Police
will be engaged in looking out for poachers near LoRD Baeronºw; preserves,
or in patrolling the bye roads which lead to CAPTAIN CRACKshot's. How heartily
the burglars must bless SIR, BALDw1N LEIGHTQN for bringing in his Bill! What a
jolly time for cracksmen will there be in rural districts, when the Police are all on
duty in their gamekeeping ...; and out of hearing of alarm-bells and the cries
for help! of householders whose plate-chests are .#. Hear what SIR GEORGE
GREY, our vigilant Home Secretary, has to say on this point:—
“There were other objections to the Bill which remained untouched, and, among others, the
objection which had been so ably urged by the Right Hon. Member for Oxfordshire, that the Bill
would entirely alter the nature of the ..º. of the County Police. (Hear, hear.) The Police
now patrolled singly, and they were generally popular as the defenders of life and property; but
it would be impossible for one policeman to cope with gangs of poachers, and if the Bill were to
be carried out, there must be large bodies of Policemen combined together, which would render
indispensable a large addition to the force. Should the force be increased it might be necessary

tar, *.
In this view SIR Joseph PAxton heartily concurred, and
rº ºf had the management of º: game preserves, was
satisfied that the Bill, if passed into law, would create dis-
turbances throughout the entire kingdom.” Certainly
although of the most angelic temperament, Mr. Punch W
be “disturbed” from his habitual serenity if he be called
on at his country house to pay a quadrupled Police rate,
because his neighbours chance to entertain a liking for
battues. On this point also SIR GEORGE GREY has spoken
like a man of sense:—
“He had no wish to throw his shield over poachers, but he believed
the evil was caused by the over-preservation of game, and the remedy
lay in the hands of the landowners themselves. (Hear, hear.) Nobody
could desire to prevent agentleman from preserving game for the pur-
pose of sport, but Parliament ought not to flº #. protection
to those who maintained great preserves order that they might
have the pleasure of reading in the newspapers towards the end of the
season, that they and their friends had, in the course of two or three
days, killed 7,000 or 8,000 head of game. (Hear, Hear.) The result of
over-preservation was, that it exposed a sort of qualified property to
depredation. When other kinds of property were unduly exposed,
the thief, of course, was punished, but the judges condemned the
practice, and it appeared to him that if large preserves were to be
maintained, they should be protected at the expense, not of the rate-
payers, but of the owners themselves. (Hear, Hear.)”
Hear! hear! Yes, the House can cheer good sense, but
will the votes be guided by it? Land and law are repre-
sented pretty strongly in the Commons, and both land:
owners and lawyers as a rule are fond of shooting, and
would doubtless like to save their pockets if they can by
having county-paid policemen to look after their game.
The most radical of §. becomes a staunch Conservative
when thinking of his pheasants, and few members are so
liberal as to pay a private gamekeeper, if they can get a
ublic constable to execute his work. If the Burglar-and-
É. Bill be passed, there will be raised anew
the cry of Agricultural Distress, for many a tenant farmer
will feel grievously afflicted by it. Why not call a spade a
spade, i ropose at once to levy a Gamekeeper Rate, SIR
BALDw1N, for this is what the money for additional police-
men will in point of fact amount to ?. Qh, you think the
country wouldn't stand it, do you? Well, in that thought
Punch will certainly agree with you; but as Punch detests
to see good sport degenerate to game-slaughter, he will
not agree with you or any otherman in encouraging battues,
nor will he give his countenance to any bare-faced scheme
for preserving rich men's game at the expense of their poor
neighbours.
CRUMBS OF COMFORT FOR COUNTRY COUSINS,
WHO CAN'T COME UP To The ExhibiTION.
“MY DEAR Count Ry Cousins,
“QF course I shall be only too º to receive you. Come
when you like. At present, I regret to say, 1 haven't a spare room or a
spare moment, my house being not less occupied than my time. How-
ever, I. promise you, when you do come, that I will do my best to
entertain you; and by all means bring the baby with you.
“However, seriously speaking, if you are wise, you will stop where
you are, and i will give you the reasons for this advice, which, I assure
you, is perfectly disinterested, and entirely for your own good.
“London was never so uncomfortable as it is at the present moment.
First of all, it is so full that the people are glad to sleep in steamers,
in boats, on the º: under the arches—anywhere. There was a
talk of bringin the Great Eastern | the river and turning it into
a floating hotel. It was calculated that, by tight packing, it might
possibly be made to accommodate between 14,000 and º persons;
and, aſter all, what would that be?
. “The streets are impassable, from the millions that keep pouring
into them. Temple Bar is sometimes blocked up for hours. The
Police have to direct the people which side of the street to take, just as
they direct the carriages on a QUEEN's Drawing-Room Day. The innu-
merable º: the opposition omnibuses racing against one another,
the reckless cabmen º their maddened steeds to death in order to
make the most of their valuable time, the PICKFORD's vans tearing
along with the speed of fire-engines, the countless vehicles put in
motion to supply the wants of this agitated throng, all tend to strew
every crossing with accidents such as none but the hardened cockney,
whose pulse has been steadied by a life-long residence in his native city,
ever succeeds in triumphantly getting over.
“The accidents in consequence have been endless. The number of
mothers, that have lost their children is something awful to contem:
late! Painful instances, too, of husbands and wives being separated
or days, and days together-of servants disa ing, and never being
heard of again-are, occurring every day. However, the newspapers
will acquaint you fully with these heartrending cases, so I will not
frighten you unnecessarily by pointing out the extreme risk you run
by coming up to London, whilst the Exhibition is going on. -
“Of course, you have heard of the many robberies that take place
almost in the broad day-light? So large a concourse of people has
naturally attracted all the thieves of the world, and really, it is not safe
to go out with a watch or anything of value about one...The mere fact
of a Member of Parliament being brutally assaulted in the presence of
the statue of one of our late lamented Royal Dukes should be sufficient
to make you pause before you venture on a journey attended with, so
many perils to purse as well as person. You know...I am not an alarmist,
but candidly I should be sorry to guarantee that all of you would return
to your happy homes alive again... - -
“Of course, the great consumption has increased the price of every:
thing. Provisions are almost at famine prices. Herrings are selling at
the price of salmom. #. are as dear as peaches, and so on. As
in this busy season of pleasure-seeking, one cannot dine at home, this
is a point well deserving of consideration. -
-- #. do not let me dissuade you from coming, my dear
Country Cousins,—only for your own sakes I thought it was better
that you should be made acquainted with the real state of affairs. But
if, in spite of the danger and discomfort that certainly await you, you
are still determined to come, you may rely upon everything being done
to lessen the désagrémens of your trip by
“Your sincere, but affectionate Town Cousin,
“BENJAMIN BowBELL.”
“P.S.. I know your great eagerness to see the sights of London; but
there might as well be no sights at all, when it is utterly impossible
for one to get about to see them. As for the Exhibition, believe, me,
that beyond some guns, a piping bullfinch, and a few pickles and toys,
there is positively nothing in it. Don't rely upon any amusement at
. theatres either—every place is booked in them for two months in
advance.”

THE PRESENT CHARMING FASHION OF LONG SKIRTS,
Honestly, now—which of the Two ought to apologise to the other
“A CHARITABLE STAR.”
PLEASE to read this, which was in the Morning Star:-
“At present, Lord PALMERston does not profess to care even to
conciliate either his own colleagues or his avowed supporters. He
draws his encouragement and his cheers from the illegitimate in-
fluence of the Tory party. He is like a saucy servant who thinks she
can afford to disregard the lawful authority of mistress so Jong as
she secures the admiring glances and the secret support of master.”
Well! for a respectable and pious young paper, brought
up in a decorous Dissenting family, and especially patted
on the head by a Quaker, this is what may be called rather
spicy. In what highly proper grocer's establishment where
the sugar is sanded before Evening Privilege, did our young
friend ever see anything of the kind The describes so
amusingly P Because such things never occur in a gentle-
man's house. We fear that he must have been carelessly
apprenticed. So, the Tories are Master, and the Liberals
are Mistress, and PAM is House-Maid. And who is the
broken down. Baker, who was a very useful tradesman, and
liked at the House, while he kept to #. own line, but having
got into speculations he did not understand, has made a
mess of it, and who abuses the House-Maid because she
likes to see the soldiers go by. Eh, Richard P
THE LAP OF LUXURY.
WE, notice that in the Western Annexe of the Great
Exhibition that there is “a machine for milking the four
teats of a cow at the same time.” It is said in point of

hand” ſis lightness of touch, too, is wonderful, combining,
as we are informed, the “suaviter in modo” with the four:
teater in re in a style that is sure to cast every dairy-maid
in the kingdom out of the milk-pail of society. We are only
thinking if a few of these milking-machines could be intro.

themselves in their own milk-pails.
THE School of ADVERSITY-Want of gold, occasioned
by democratic extravagance, may teach the citizens of the
Federal Republic the value of a Sovereign.
UNJUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.
To the PRINCE DE JoinviLLE.
MY PRINCE -
THE Baily Telegraph has published some letters writen by you
to the Duke D'AUMALE, describing the battle of the Chickahominy,
and extolling the valour of the Count DE PARIs, and the DUKE DE
CHARTREs, displayed in that engagement. If it is not too impertinent
a question, allow me to ask: What business had you there? That of
making political capital, and learning the art of war, I am informed.
But pray what right had you to study the art of war at the expense of
the Confederates, and to make political capital out of their blood?
I find you writing as follows:–
“I was admiring the grandeur of the scene spread out before me—we had about
35,000 men engaged, a numerous artillery, the reserve of cavalry, the lancers with
their floating pennons—all in the midst of a most picturesque country, and the
whole illuminated by the blood-red rays of the setting sun."
Certainly it was very polite of the Sun to place himself in keeping
with the scene which was affording you so much satisfaction. A most
accommodating Sun to look down on a scene of fratricide, and emit
blood-red rays to match. It did not occur to you perhaps, absorbed in the
interesting spectacle of Americans cutting Americans’ throats assisted
by your nephews, who were in the thick of the fight—to examine your
own fingers. Physically, perhaps, they were of my colour, but viewed in
a moral light were they not stained with the blood of people who had
done you no *f; were they not, in short, crimson with murder?
If not, how am I to understand the ensuing passage in your letter.
When the Federals and your gallant nephews ran away, you say:—
“I joined a few officers who attempted to check the artillery, and we succeeded
by absolutely barring the way and seizing the horses by the bridles. By that
means we were enabled to 3. two or three pieces in position on the slope of a hill,
and with them we harassed the enemy by the last rays of day.”
Harassing the enemy with , pieces in position means § and
wounding those on whom you fire. What harm had the Confederate
troops ever done you that you should kill, or wound them? What
authority had you to shoot them, any more than I have to shoot you,
and if I did should not I be a murderer?
Having saved yourselves from the pursuing Southern troops, you
proceed to give your brother and me the ensuing information:—
“We embark upon the Galena. While there a report is sent from the rear, an-
nouncing that a powerful body of the enemy is advancing towards the position
occupied by Port ER. Immediately we re-ascend the river in order to throw the
weight of our cannon-balls into the scale, and open a fierce fire."
Do you? And what excuse have you to plead in extenuation of
your gratuitous ferocity ?, And was the scale into, which you were
pleased to throw the weight of your cannon-balls that of Justice or
Tyranny ? The conclusion of your adventures on board the Galena is
less glorious than amusing:—
“The lieutenant is at the mast-head with a signal officer, who º: with
the men who work Porter's º which are placed on the roof 2 a house in
order to direct our fire. I also climb up to the mast-head, in spite of my jack-boots
and spurs.”
I wish one of my artists could have seen you:—
“In the heat of the action the helmsman forgets to steer straight, and the Galena
runs ashore. A disagreeable thing, as immediately the enemy covers the neigh-
bourhood with sharpshooters. We at last get off, and Porter's fire slackens.”
The remainder of your “pitiful story” is briefly told. You and your
nephews show friends and enemies a clean pair of heels, and decamp,
or, as your late allies say, absºluotilate. PRESIDENT LINCOLN very
properly refuses to receive you; but he should have done that before
when you offered him the swords of amateur assassins, I would say, i
I thought you had killed anybody. But I will cherish the hope that
your balls flew wide of the mark, and that you have really eaten as
many Confederates as you killed, so that the guilt which you have by
your own account incurred, may not amount to more than shooting
with intent, and you are only on a par with an offender who deserves,
though by the law of England he is not liable, to be hanged. -
Accept, my Prince, the assurance of my distinguished disapprobation,
33&HNC#.
P.S. One of our poets has said that—
“They who in quarrels interpose,
Must often wipe a bloody nose.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BARREL-ORGANS FOR BABIES.
EOPLE with inquiring minds and
energetic legs, who explore the
nooksandcorners of the World's
Show down at Brompton, may
have possibly discovered a re-
mote * of the building,
accessible by ascending a few
†: of stairs, and con-
.# esides photographs, a
reat lot of toys and school-
ooks. These latter the cata-
logue, with more elegance of
language, describes as “educa-
tional works and appliances; ”
and perhaps they are exhibited
at so very great a height be-
cause to elevate mankind is
the aim of education. Desks,
drawing-pads and cricket-bats,
globes, orreries, and footballs,
marbles, maps and magic lan-
terns, grammars and backgam-
mon boards, writing tablets and
wax-dolls, conjuring tricks and
copy-books, these are some out
of the very many articles of
interest contained in this col:
lection; but in the visit which we paid it a day or two ago, we failed
to notice if among the “educational appliances” there is exhibited
that highly useful implement, the birch. - - - - -
One however of the objects of chief interest in this Class is a Barrel-
Organ shown by a scientific gentleman, who has apparently devoted no
small portion of his life to the study of the science of “Euphonic
Education.” This science he explains to be a method of instruction by
the help of music; speech and spelling being taught to children in the
cradle to the accompaniment of tunes on a chromatic barrel-organ,
which, it is presumed, will have the power of impressing whatever may
be wished to be impressed upon the mind. A book called the Infant
Drama is exhibited therewith, and in this entertaining work, we find
the ºwns description of how a baby is supposed to be euphonically
taught :-
“SCENE II.-Joseph INE's Apartment in the Gardener's Cottage. Morning.
“Joseph INE and the INFANT PRINCE.
“ (The clock strikes sir. Joseph INE takes up the baby.)
“Josephine. What I is my little angel awake, opening his beautiful, sweet, blue
eyes, looking for his dear Joseph.INE? Come, then, my little sweet one, he shall
have some comforts. (JEANNETTE enters.) JEANNETTE, my love, get ready the bath;
let the water be only just tepid, and bring the sponge and a piece of old Windsor
soap, and warm, the towels for drying baby; and be as quick as you can, dear, as
I have got a great deal to do, so that every minute is precious. [Brit JEANNETTE.
“(JEANNETTE re-enters, with the things.)
“Jeannette. Mother, here is the bath, just tepid—the sponge, the soap, and soft
hair-brush; the towels quite hot, and th: powder-box.
“Josephine. Thank you dear, that is all I want. Now, my sweet baby, I must
take off the pretty night-gown and night-cap, and put baby in the bath. (Joseph INE
washes the baby, and tells JEANNETTE to turn the organ, which plays “Garry Owen,” the
national Irish air : takes the baby out of the bath, and dries it very tenderly, talking to
it as fast as she can upon the different parts of its body, quite in the language of endear-
ment, and counts all its toes and fingers in the usual nursery way.) JEANNETTE, dear,
take away all the bath apparatus, rinse out the bath, and J. it by carefully; put
everything back in its place, and hang the wet towels to dry, and then come back
immediately. [Brit JEANNETTE.”
It rather puzzles us to fancy what a child can learn from hearing
“Garry Owen” played while it is in the bath. HANDEL’s “Water
Music” would be clearly more appropriate, and equally instructive, at
least so we should think. Equally instructive too it must be found to
read Pope's Homer and MILTON's Paradise Lost to a baby in the cradle,
upon the philosophic principle this dialogue puts forth:-
b ..ºry Why, surely you don't mean to read poetry of that difficult nature to a
aby?
y
“Josephine. Yes, indeed I do: the philosopher says it makes no difference what
language or what kind of poetry you repeat: one is just as easily imbibed as the
other. Therefore you may just as well read the best as the worst poetry. Both
science and literature come under the head of language, and all languages are just the
same to a baby; it imbibes any one, or all of them, with equal facility.
“Mary. Well, I see now, clear enough, that the Euphonic system will do wonders,
as it appears, from your explanations, that philosophy has fully developed its power
and process.”
Well, if mothers take to reading Pope and MILTON to their babies,
fººt times by way of a change they will read a bit of TUPPER;
and this, we grant, would have some benefit, for * child of sense
would soon be sent to º by it. But, reverting to the barrel-organ,
we find alleged as one of the chief reasons for its use:—
“That infant man is entirely an imitative being of the highest order—that he is a
living musical instrument, su sing all musical instruments ever invented; that
he is a perfect organ, with a nat bellows, of constant motion, with a musical
larynx, and a tongue the most marvellous, susceptible of millions of variations of
sounds and harmonies, that no PAGANINI could possibly come up to."
A portion of this statement every father will endorse. “Infant
men,” when teething so continually do cry, that they may very well be
spoken as living musical instruments, with bellows of constant motion,
- W; organs” for the noise and nuisance they create.
Whether the Euphonic system, if it succeed with babies, be adaptable
to schoolboys and to students quite grown-up, on this point The Infant
Drama says but, little to enlighten us, “Grinding” is however not
unknown at College as a means of getting knowledge, and possibl
students may take to organ-grinding, if it be fancied that such
music really aids the memory, and instructs the mind. Euphonic edu-
cation would however be attended with certain disadvantages, were it
practised by Collegians, or even at large schools. College students
might of course have private rooms to play their organs inj, a conve-
nience which school-boys could in few cases enjoy, and could only be
allowed to have an organ for each class. But, knowledge, if acquired
by the hearing of a tune, might only be recalled by the recurrence of
that melody; and unless students could bring their barrel-organs with
them when they went to be examined, we fear the chances are they
would infallibly be plucked. Indeed, even were the privilege of bringin
them conceded, it is doubtful if the organs would prove of muc
assistance when º ed in open hall. For just fancy what distracting
discord there would be if a couple of hundred organs were all played in
the same room; and how horribly your memory and mind would be
disturbed by hearing “Jim Crow” with your right ear and a psalm
tune with your left, while you yourself were grinding “Scots wha hae”
or “Garry Queen” to help, you in remembering the fifth problem of
EucLID, or the date when Rome was built, or the “watch” argument
of PALEY, or the paradigm of riºrrw.

How to Restore Order in the House.
If there is insubordination amongst Members of Parliament, or any
murmuring symptoms of mutiny, which probably may threaten the
existence of “the ruling powers that be,” the most effectual way of
restoring order is for the PRIME MINISTER to begin playing the
“Prorogue's March.” It is astonishing the moment, a few notes of
that melting—or we may say, dissolving—air are heard, how extremely
quiet the most refractory mutineers become?
“AULD LAING synE.”
SoME time ago, says, MR. LAING, when in India it was nec
resort to torture in order to squeeze the taxes out of the natives, the
pressure of the rates was so heavy that the population to a great extent
É. case-hardened to the business;, indeed, one whole sect to his
nowledge became quite Hindoorated!
“AND so say ALL of Us.”
We are told that Game is not property...To this absurd legal fiction
we beg to give the flattest contradiction. For instance, there is Punch
who is the very best game in the world, and yet where in England will
you find a finer property?

IMPERTINENT LITTLE SwerPER. “Broom, Mumf Would yer like to 'ave mine, Mumf Shall for a Joey /"
SHOPPING AT THE WORLD'S SHOW.
MR. PUNCH, a few weeks since, called public notice to the fact that
some of the exhibitors at the World's, Show down at Brompton were,
as he imagined, breaking faith with the Commissioners by advertising
that their goods might, be “obtained” within the building; thus
leaving it to be inferred that customers were served at the various
stands and trophies, and might take away the goods they purchased, as
they would from a mere shop. Mr. Punch's dozen words put a stop to
these advertisements, but he regrets to find that the practice of “ob-
taining” goods is still in operation; and, as he believes this is obtaining
goods under false pretences, he begs SIR WENTwoRTH DILKE AND
Co., to 190k into the matter, as soon as they can spare five minutes so
to do. It is clearly to their interest that the custom should be stopped,
for there is no doubt, it deters people from visiting the building.
Mr. Punch is ever anxious to improve his mind, and although the
crinoline plays havoc with his legs, he would very often spend an hour
or two at Brompton, for the Exhibition clearly is a most instructive
place. But Mr. Punch, as a fond husband, cannot go without his wife;
and he is afraid to take that lady because of touting tradesmen, who
tempt her to buy things for which he has to pay. The jewellers are
specially intrusive and obnoxious, and a walk among their cases with a
lady on one's arm is quite as perilous to one's pocket as a promenade
down Regent Street in quest of a lace shawl, or a duck of a chip bonnet.
For woman's flesh is weak, and when she sees a brooch or bracelet
glittering before her, and hears it whispered by the tempter, “Only
thirty guineas, M'm, and reelly very sheap,” she cannot well help
feeling a desire to buy the bauble, for which unfortunate AUGUSTUs,
John or WILLIAM has to pay. Besides, in some cases the tempter is
not content with luring her by what he publicly exhibits, but he pro-
duces other baits from a t-bag or coat-pocket, and then perhaps
assures her that the “articles” he shows her are duplicates of some
made for the Countess of Cornelian or the Marchioness of Malachite,
names which he well knows are sure to tickle female ears.
Now by dealings such as these the International Exhibition is sunk
into a shop. Husbands can no longer walk in it with safety, and their
minds are vexed and harassed instead of being bettered by it. One's
dread of pickpockets of course becomes considerably enhanced when
one carries about a thirty guinea trinket in one's pocket, and, as the
touters let their goods be taken away when bought, this fear is often
added to the nuisance of the purchase. If sales in jewellery be suffered,
and removal of the goods, sales in furniture and ironware should also
be permissible; and exhibitors of these, latter have a clear right to
complain, if the sale and the removal of their goods be not allowable.
There might be some slight bustle if all the tradesmen in the buildin
acted like the jewellers, and not merely took orders, but accompani
their sales with the delivery of their goods. But clearly in strict justice
this should be conceded to them, for the maker of a bedstead has as
much a right to sell, it and to let it be removed, as the maker of a
brooch. A husband could not, it is true, well put a bedstead in his
pocket; and its removal from the building might be difficult to effect
without the knowledge of the police. A brooch or bracelet, may be
easily concealed and smuggled out; but until Mr. Punch has the leave
of the Commissioners to carry away a bedstead, a chandelier or steam
engine, he will rigidly abstain from buying either brooch or bracelet,
having no wish to take part in any underhand transaction, or to help
a touting tradesman to turn dishonest.pennies by sales which, Mr.
Punch believes, are contrary to law. Himself being an exhibitor (
and see Class 28, front row in North Gallery, near to Eastern Dome),
Mr. Punch of course has an interest in the matter; for if the World's
Show is a shop where sales may be effected and things purchased there
removed, Mr. Punch will claim the right of attending at his trophy, and
there selling to the universe his own immortal works.

PAM AT SHIEFFIELD.
LoRD PALMERston, the Indomitable (if the Cabmen will pardon us
for using a word that has given them so much offence), scarcely waited
for the doors of Parliament to be closed when off he rattled to Sheffield,
to dine with MR. John BRow N, the excellent Mayor of the City of
Knives. There was a splendid banquet at the Cutlers' Hall, and the
Members for Sheffield, the Aldermen, numbers of Mayors, and others of
the élite of Yorkshire were present. The Morning Star says, “His
Lordship entered freely into conversation with the gentlemen present,
and was in excellent mood for cracking jokes, many of which were pro-
vocative of much laughter.” The Star, perhaps undesirous to say more
than was necessary in honour of MR. CopDEN's friend, the PREMIER,
unkindly suppresses the jokes in question, but Mr. Punch, who is impar-
tial, and would cheerfully record an epigram by MR, HADFIELD or MR.
Cox, if either gentlemen could make one, begs to supply the omission.
LoRD, PALMERston, having entered the reception room, and made a
general bow to all present, shook hands with each gentleman who was
resented, and made a facetious observation in each case. “Ah, MR.
hERIEF Twenty MAN,” said his Lordship, “you here. Glad to see

A ROTHSCHILD IN THE PRIZE RING.
To live like a fighting cock is an expression not yet, obsolete; but when one
wishes to describe a luxurious existence, assuredly ere long the best comparison
will be to say that Mr. So-and-so is living like a prize-fighter. What con-
tinents of venison and what oceans of champagne may be afforded for the diet of a
pugilistic champion, may be seen by this announcement in the Sporting Life:–
“ToM SAYERS's 200 MEN AND HoRSEs' FAREWELL For A TIME to HIS TRUE BRITISH Soil.-
ToM SAYERs's company and horses are engaged, together with the veteran agent, to visit Australia.
The great English boxer and his troupe, consisting of 160 men, sixty horses, and two elephants, go
to Australia. The ship Alexandria, 1,500 tons burden, will convey the mighty hero and suite to
the land of novelty September 6, 1862, at the termination of the Exhibition. Mr. SAYERs is
engaged at the sum of £85,000 for twelve months, exclusive of the voyage each way in the ship
Alexandria. Therefore, under these circumstances, he will for a time bid farewell to the land he
loves, wishing to return with the laurels of a far distant soil emblazoned on his breast, which
will add to the comfort of his declining years, surrounded by the affluence he so richly deserves,
as one who has upheld to the letter the honour and bravery of his dear native land."
Five and eighty thousand pounds is no bad sum to et for a single year's
engagement, and we heartily congratulate the worthy MR. SAYERs on the prospect of
good living which appears to be before him. . Even if he have not saved a penn
out of all the money he has pocketed by sparring and by starring in “the provinces,”
he may now look forward to º; from, Australia with ample means for his
indulgence in every kind of luxury, from the costliest of claret to the tiniest of
terriers, and the gorgeousest of garments that ever have been sported º a swell of
the Prize Ring. We only trust that MR; SAYERs will abstain from living “not
wisely but too well:” for people blest with sudden affluence have been known to
get the gout, and intº is skill in the art of self-defence, MR. SAYERs should
remember that in most cases the gout is an awkward sort of customer, and when it
gives a knock-down blow no science can avail against it.
But while we congratulate him upon his good fortune, we really think the
“mighty hero” might have managed, to announce, it with more modesty of
*; than he has cared to use. We don't so much object to his parading to the
world, his tremendous amor patriæ, or, to his bragging of the affluence which (in
his opinion) he “so richly deserves,” and which he anticipates will certainly surround
him when he returns to settle in his dear native land. But inasmuch as MR. SAYERs
is merely hired to show himself and his horses in Australia, and as he is to § in
quite a peaceful way, without the least idea of being called upon to fight, we don't
exactly see what laurels he can win there, and we are
therefore slightly puzzled to know why such things should
be “emblazoned on his breast.” If the possession of some
laurels, of Antipodean growth would i. “add to the
gomfort of his declining years,” we should advise MR.
SAYERs to challenge the Antipodean champion, (if there be
one), or at any rate to hunt up some one who will fight
him, so that he may come home with another triumph
added to those he has already gained. Unless he does
so, his laurels, if we ever chance to see them, will be of
very little value in our eyes: indeed we shall be tempted to
regard them as mere greens, to which the term of “cab-
bage’ might appear not inappropriate.
AN UNFAIR QUESTION.
To any man this question put,
If you would touch him near,
And tempt his irritable foot:
How much have you a-year?
If self-control restrain his ire,
His thumb he will apply
Unto his nose, and you desire
To catechise his eye.
There’s nothing that a Briton true
More hates than to confess,
Required or ordered so to do,
Or driven by duress.
'Tis this that makes him Priest and Pope,
So cordially detest,
Because they want to search and grope
The depths within his breast.
No power on Earth can force JoHN BULL
His conscience to expose,
But rather he his sins would tell,
Than his affairs disclose,
His income would you ascertain,
Its sum why he should show
Good cause indeed you must explain
That he may let you know.
Then if you want him to declare
His annual revenue,
Taxation's load that it may share
In measure just and due;
You may expect, with many a sigh,
With many a grunt and groan,
With growl and grin and faces wry
The truth at last will own.
But if your tax, like Schedule D,
Be partial and unjust,
Then may you calculate that he
Will tell you—what he must.
And you, if more you’d have him say,
With thumbscrews and with racks
Must wring it out, to make him pay
Unequal Income-Tax.
Then wonder you that his returns
Thereto should be so small P
His cheek with shame, suppose you, burns f
He blushes not at all.
Would you the full amount extract
Of his precarious pelf?
Then ask him not for ground of fact
Whereon to cheat himself.
The Danger of Joking with One's Wife.
MR. Dove, seeing on a Masonic Lodge's emblazoned
charter, the well-known motto, “Audi, Vidi, Tace,” recom-
mended it hopefully to his wife for her future adoption,
but the dear creature did not see it; on the contrary, in
a loud and voluble strain that lasted for at least if:
hour, she proceeded to call upon MR. Dove to translate
those dark insidious words; and furthermore she insisted,
in a tone of authority. that seemed to inspire more fear
than respect, upon being instantly informed as, to what
was MR. Dove's little meaning in expressing a hope that
she should adopt any gibberish like that, as her own?
Up to the hour of our going to press, the dispute was still
pending.

SKETCH ON THE SEA COAST DURING THE GALE.
Lord D–ndre-ry (to his Bwother). “A-A-A, I THAY, THAM WATHER A DITBPLAY or FIGGER—EH !”
REVIEW OF THE SEASON.
Most of the newspapers, as soon as Parliament closes, give a review
of the Session. A; little has been done this year, the summary on this
occasion has been far from a lively one. In the fashionable world, the
result has been very different. e are enabled, from favoured sources,
to give a titled Lady's review of what has been going on :-
... The present Season has been a most severe, a highly fatiguing one.
“It is impossible almost to enumerate the many calls we have had
upon our time by friends from the country, and foreigners from the
Continent, as well as from the innumerable exhibitions that have
been open.
“The consequence has been, that no lady who owes anything to
i. has scarcely had a moment to herself that she could fairly call
er own.
“The International Show has monopolised a great deal of our time,
which it is to be º has been profitably and instructively spent,
especially the many delicious hours we have passed in the Jewellery
Department. It would be a source of great regret, after inspecting
with ever-increasing delight the varied intellectual stores of Messrs.
EMANUEL, HUNT AND RoskELL, STORR.AND MoRTIMER, and others
of not less dazzling fame, if ladies, generally so impressionable to such
inspiring scenes, have not carried away with them, many happy remi:
miscences of them upon which their memories as well as their eyes will
not fail to dwell hereafter with a fond gratification that will brighten
their recollection of the memorable season of 1862, with a lustre such
as shall never fade. These treasures ought to be for ever hoarded up
with jealous care in the valued jewel-box of memory.
“The two º: have monopolised most of i. evenings that we
have not been able to devote to }. parties, and conversaziones, and
fêtes of a more sociable nature. To Parti and TITIENs, to MARIO, and
not less beloyed GIUGLIN1–our thanks are most gratefully due. Their
cherished voices, as they ring thrillingly again in the ears of our recol-
lection, should stimulate us to cultivate, our own during the quiet
pauses of the recess, when Fashion, kindly allowing its most ardent
votaries to retire to the country, gives them breathing time to recover
from their fatigues.
“The Handel Festival, as well as the Piping Bullfinch, must have

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MoRDAY August 4th. The Lords, who had a special sitting on the
previous Saturday, to read the Distress Bill a Second Time, suspended
all rules, hastened it through Committee, and passed it to-day, some of
them complaining that Government had been tardy in bringing forward
the measure.
LoRD, CAMPBELL, or STRATHEDEN, made a speech in favour of a
recognition of the Southern Confederacy, but the Lords considered that
the subject should be left in the hands of the Government, and EARL
Russell expressed his obligations for that mark of confidence. -
. The Commons had a short meeting, and as at the St. Stephen's Club it
is the custom to discuss everything, the case of the lady to whom Ireland
ves and Scotland denies the name of MRs. MAJoR YELVERTON was
rought up, and MR. Whiteside made a speech in the interest of his
late client. SIR. RoundELL PALMER admitted the absurdity of havin
three systems of marriage law, and wished the English system adopte
throughout the three kingdoms, but gave no pledge to attempt º:
Mr. Punch is unable to ...i why a .#. should not be
required in all cases—that is to say, a registration before a civil officer
—and then the subsequent ceremony might beiºſi to the feelings of the
ties, who might please themselves with the graceful splendour of a
atholic marriage, the solemn ritual of England, the drawing-room
benediction of Scotland, or, the gymnastic performance across the
emblem of household cleanliness.” He certainly thinks that people
ought to know whether, they are married or not, although he admits
that doubts on the subject are exceptional, and that the housekeeping
books exhibit a series of certificates which are perſectly convincing to
most men.
Both Houses rose until
Thursday. When in the Commons the Attorney-GENERAL (a Dis-
senter) had to defend the Bishop of Oxford for his order for a Silent
Prayer for the restoration of peace in America. SIR WILLIAM said
that “it was to be presumed that the Bishop had not issued the order
unadvisedly,” and one's defender could hardly say much less for one. MR.
NEW DEGATE takes up the Church Rate question, and introduces a Bill
for the settlement thereof. M.R. Osborne once more tried to burst
the Armstrongs, but SIR George Lewis stood to his guns. LoRD
PALMERston said that he and Lord SHAFTESBURY had not *: filled

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
E-----
MARINE ASSURANCE.
FROM Vera Cruz a naval
Correspondent forwards us
the following, extracted, as
he tells us, from a transat-
lantic print:—
MATRIMONIAL.
YOUNG NAVAL OF-
FICER, of excellent family
and associations, is desirous of
entering into a correspondence
with some young lady in a similar
position, with a view to a nearer
and dearer acquaintance here-
after, the lady must be pretty,
and possessing a good education,
and blessed with a gentle and
loving disposition. Address —
U. S. S. Minnesota, Hampton
Roads, Va. Irish or German
aristocracy need not apply.
Pretty and well educated,
disposed to gentleness and
love, surely these Fº qua-
lities should satisfy a man,
iſ found united in a lady of
good family and “excellent
associations,” whatever the
may be. There is a smac
of over-nicety in this young
officer's exclusion of the
titled girls belonging to Germany and Ireland from, the extraordinary
rivilege of being blessed with his handwriting, and then possibly his
É. A pretty, gentle, loving girl, born of a good family and educated
well, is not a person to be sneered at because she happens to belong to
the irish aristocrac , or to claim relation to some §. prince or
lord. A young officer in the navy of the Northern, Untied States,
whatever be his merits, can hardly be so great a catch that he need fear
to be besieged by so many pretty loving girls of noble birth, as to
render it desirable to exclude at least two countries from competing for
is hand. We hear a good deal nowadays about marine assurance, and
if this advertisement be taken as a sample of it, there is very clearly no
lack of assurance in the navy of New York.
MORE YANKEE SLANG.
ONE serious evil resulting from the abominable Civil War still raging
in America, is its tendency to corrupt the English language. Despatches
written by Northern generals are published in English newspapers, and
almost all of them contain disgusting Yankeeisms, which are copied
by many British journalists who ought to know better. Some new
solecism is continually turning | in these illiterate compositions, and,
being adopted and repeated in other writings of the same description,
soon becomes current Yankee coin, as base as shinplasters or cardboard-
stamps, which must not be suffered to pass in this country with sterling
English. Some of these counterfeits have been already nailed to our
counter, and we must now affix one more. -
The last new mintage of American vocabulary smashers is the verb
“To claim,” used as signifying to allege, assert, or maintain. Such and
such an officer, for instance, is said to claim that he has taken, so many
guns and prisoners. To F. that he has taken them is what might
naturally supposed to be meant; because “to claim” is to “demand
of right,” to "require authoritatively;" and when it is, said that a
man claims to have done something, and, especially something that is
improbable, what seems to be implied is that he demands credit for his
statement to that effect, which is doubted. -
In a sort of Prospectus of a “General Basis of the Society of the
Lyceum Church of Spiritualists, Boston, U.S.A.,” occurs the following
sentence:–
“The members of this Society claim that the soul of man is immortal.”
, The ludicrous misuse of the word “claim,” above instanced, may
serve as an example, which gregarious, imitative, and unthinking
writers, who are too apt to contract vulgar and villanous idioms, are
hereby implored to avoid.
−
They Stoop to Conquer.
PEACEMONGERs at any price, may say what ill-natured things they
please against the Rifle Shooting Association, but at all events they
cannot accuse the Members of passing altogether “an aimless
existence.”

THE MANIFEST DESTINY OF THE YANKEES.
JonATHAN.--'Tis now some while since I’ve heard anything, from
your Yankee statesmºn and stump-orators, about the manifest §
of the United States. The destiny of your Model Republic, your
go-ahead people, the freest and most enlightened nation on the globe,
which seemed manifest to those eloquent and impassioned patriots, was
that of º; over the whole American continent by the annexation
the wise called it), of your neighbours' territories. The manifest
estiny of the cup, friend JoNATHAN, is sometimes too confidently
H. to be reaching the lip; but, as a prae-Tupperite philosopher
as remarked, a casualty frequently occurs between the one and the
other, so as to prevent the vessel from reaching its destination.
The Model Republic, that was to chaw up Creation, and swallow the
universe like an infinite Python, or the Great American Sea-Serpent, is
severed in twain, and of its two writhing pieces, each, become an indi-
vidual snake, is now writhing and struggling, with all the might of its
coils, to crush and chaw up the other. The manifest destiny of both
North and South is to “spill much more blood,” and become “wus.”
as you pronounce the word, and spend much more money; and one
destiny which apparently if not manifestly awaits you is national bank-
ruptcy, and the consequent necessity of caving in. -
The ultimate destiny manifest to mankind at large as that which is
reserved for you Yankees is not that of going where all good niggers go.
I am sorry to inform you that the general opinion is that the applauders
of GENERAL BUTLER will go where they will meet NANA SAHIB. On
such a subject, however, I will not be so Fº as to talk like
Matoworn and the Pope. But I may and must say, friend JonATHAN,
to judge by the way in which f. are going on, that, as regards this
world, at any rate, your manifest destiny, a destiny in evident course of
accomplishment, is that of descending to the very lowest place. It has
for some time been said that, in form and features, your people are
approaching the Red Indian º and I now find you exulting in the
worst brutality of Sepoys, whilst you also emulate their malignant
ferocity, in howling for British blood, and whooping over British
distress, F.". burning to glut your bloodthirst upon this country,
by way of return for our petting and pampering you, humouring your
whims and extravagance, treating you with the utmost kindness and
forbearance, and making you every possible concession.
Thus, JonATHAN, you see, you are sinking from bad to worse, from
savage to lower savage, and your manifest destiny, at that rate of
decadence, is the zero of humanity. But will you stop there, JonATHAN ?
If there is any truth in the theory of the “Origin of Species,” there
may be an inversion of the originating process, you know. Degeneration
is as possible, as development, and American citizens, if they go on
raving, º murdering, burning, and wreaking foul unmanly
vengeance, may, after having passed through the phases of Indian
North and East, Nigger, Bosjesman and, Earthman, arrive at a point
below. M. DUCHAILLU's Fans, who eat their own kinsfolk; JonATHAN
cuts the throats of his already. The countrymen of WashingtoN may
decline into Gorillas, and the future Australian traveller who sketches
the ruins of Faneuil Hall may find them infested with grinning and
gibbering baboons whose ancestors were citizens of New York. Your
manifest destiny, unless you return to reason, is all of you to be turned
to apes with foreheads villanous low. You will be up a tree indeed,
holding on with your feet as well as your hands, like the other quadru.

Something Like a Menace.
AN Exhibitor at the Show, dissatisfied with the opinion expressed
upon his property by the Jurors, put up a protest. The Commissioners
immediately covered up his article in a canvassacking, and set a *:

he shall, for once, follow the example of the Commissioners, and if they
manifest the slightest impertinence on account of his strictures upon
their conduct, he will cover up the whole Exhibition with a sack, and
set Toby as guard to prevent MR. Cole, or anybody else, from taking

GREAT POLITICAL CRICKET MATCH.
PAM's TEAM AGAINST THE AMALGAMATED DIZZYITE8.
This exciting match has been commenced on the St. Stephen's
ound, and up to the time of the º of the stumps it will be seen
that PAM's team have clearly had the best of it. . The veteran has
indeed by far the stronger side, having pretty nearly had the pick ºf All
England, by whom he has long been held as a prime favourite. When
well warmed to his work there are few more slashing and hard hitters
than old PAM, and he has shown himself this season more cautious in
his play than it was formerly his wont to be. -
Dizzy's underhand sneakers and insinuating twisters have proved of
no avail against PAM's bold and forward batting; and while he has been
ever ready to hit out, we think that all who have enjoyed an opportunity
to judge of it must have much admired the skill and style of his defence.
We were not at all surprised to find him, when the stumps were drawn,
carrying out his bat: for the veteran is one of those who when they get
well in are generally found by no means easy to put out.
On the whole, we think PAM's team have pretty fairly satisfied the
hopes their captain formed of them : although he knows as well as any
one that there are one or two uncommonly weak players still among
them. Young PEEL is much too reckless to be trusted in a match, and,
though he makes at times a fairly average good score, old Wood is
sadly clumsy and unscientific. LEwis, is a rather slow old-fashioned
sort of player, still at some points we admit he is not without his merit:
but CowPER is so generally unlucky (if we may not, say, unskilful) in
his play that his place might very easily be filled with some one better.
Littlejohn NY Rüssell is a good old steady player, and from his long
experience he has of course acquired a thorough knowledge of the
game; but we think, next to the captain, BILL GLADSTONE is decidedly
the best man in the team, and though rather apt, like WESTBURY, to
show a little temper, he must º be viewed as an uncommonly
fineſº: and one who very rarely will, let slip a chance, of scoring.
Well knowing his weak point, Dizzy did his best last spring to aggravate
him with his “teascrs; ” but BILL was on his guard for them, and
wisely took good care to keep within his ground, although, certainly, we
must admit, at first he seemed inclined to hit cut rather wildly.
On the other side we find but little to commend, although we certainl
admire the pluck that Diz has shown in playing what he knew woul
be a losing game to him. His tactics have however been a long way
from first-rate, and on, more than one occasion the absence of good
generalship has proved of fatal damage to him. . What could be more
absurd than the putting on of WALPole as a bowler at old PAM, who of
course made mincemeat of him the first over ? Moreover, there must
be something faulty in the captain, when a team are so unruly as the
Dizzyites have shown themselves. To play well together, an eleven
must have confidence in the captain who commands them. "This confi.
dence the Dizzyites have failed as yet to feel; and we therefore cannot
wonder at their finding themselves beaten. By getting Cobden on
their side and another one or two of the Manchester Eleven, they doubt-
lessly made pretty sure of putting PAM's team, out before #: hour
came for the drawing of the stumps. But though a clever bowler, and
making a good contrast with his slows when he is put on as a change
withijizzº's sneakers, CoBDEN is by no means now so powerful as he
was, and certainly old PAM is not the player to be funked by him.
It is understood that the match will be resumed next season, but
unless Dizzy contrives to get his men more up to work, there seems very
little hope of his º any good with them. Their fielding is at present
far from being at all first-rate: indeed so clumsy have they showed
themselves in much that they have done, that one might really have
imagined the AMALGAMATED DizzyITEs must have a close connection
with that other team of cricketers, who have elected to be called the
Amalgamated Duffers. As has before been stated, PAM carries out his
bat with every chance of winning; indeed some of the members of the
St. Stephens’ club are quite willing to bet that the veteran will be
reported as “Not Out” all next season. -

THE CAB CONSPIRACY.
GARIBALDI may please himself in Sicily, JEFF. Davis may go on
# the North, and the Montenegrins may continue to announce
that they kill eleven thousand Turks every day. We have business at
home, and had better mind it. The Cabmen of London menace
insurrection.
There is no time to inquire into the origin of their disaffection, but
it dates from the time when their Glorious Three Days of strike pro-
duced the tyrannical Act of Parliament which compels them to be
tolerably honest and civil, except when their fares are women, strangers,
or other unprotected persons. The foul wrong which placed means of
redress within the reach of any person who has plenty of nerve and
perseverance, and a week to throw away, has rankled in the minds of
the Cabmen, and the exaltation into which they have been thrown by
the plunder which they have made this Exhibition year, has brought
them to exploding §: They now announce, in fiery !. headed
“Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen,” that they are resolved and united,
and that they are about to make a great demonstration in ſavour of
their right to commit highway robbery.
When cab men conspire, good men must combine.
They announce that they are going to meet, several thousands strong,
in Exeter Hall, and that on the day of their meeting, no Cab shall be
brought out after twelve o'clock. They say, in print, that they wish
“to give the public a notion of the inconvenience of having no cabs.”
What the innocent public has done to deserve that the whole business
and pleasure of a great city should be stopped, in order to promote the
interests of the pockets of any set of men, is not worth discussing. We
are told that on this day of the Exeter Hall meeting, we shall not go
to railways, theatres, or friends’ houses, that if a physician is wanted
in haste there shall be no means of getting at him, that a child shall
not be able to hasten to its dying parent, and that the most important
business journey shall be rendered impossible. And all this that Cabby
º, be able to cheat in future to a larger extent, and with impunity.
r. Punch has a recollection that when the Cab, Act was passed, a
clause was proposed for dealing rather summarily with, any such
demonstration as the strike that brought on legislation. He has not
the Act at hand, and forgets whether the clause was inserted; but the
HoME SECRETARY for the time certainly said in committee that any
repetition of the strike would be in the nature of a conspiracy, and
punishable accordingly.
. Be this as it may, §e licensing authorities have the matter pretty
much in their own hands. If the cabmen want the Law altered, the
same means are open to them that are employed by her Majesty's other
subjects for obtaining a revision of the law. But if they proceed to
conspiracy and coercion, they should be made to comprehend that the
law of cabs is made for the benefit of three millions of Londoners, not
for that of three thousand drivers. -
Suppose Somerset House announces that the licence of every Cabman
who strikes, as threatened, shall be, ipso facto, cancelled.
Doubtless there will be some inconvenience to the public for some
time. But we shall be relieved, at once and for the future, from a
system of extortion and ruffianism, new vehicles and new drivers (there
are thousands to be found at short notice) will be placed upon the ranks,
and London, whose cab system is a disgrace to us, as Manchester, Paris,
Liverpool, Glasgow, and Birmingham tauntingly tell us, will be the
ultimate gainer.
We will hear the Cabman, if he speaks reasonably, and respectfully,
and if he can show a real grievance, we will aid him in getting it
redressed. But if he is inclined to try with the public en masse the
tactics he tries, when he dares, with individuals, we will trouble him
not for his ticket, but for his licence.

THAMES ELEGANCE.
| WE perceive that a new Company called the Thames
Express, Steam Boat. Company is launched, with a highly
respectable-looking list of directors. Mr. Punch wants to
know more about this project. He learns that the boats are
to be of a high class, so he concludes that it is intended to
make Thames steamboating genteel. In this case he would
like to see the rules. He hopes that, the passengers will
all be expected to appear in elegant though careless morn-
ing dress, that the best cigars, only, will be allowed to be
smoked, that no volunteered music, (and especially none
of those filthy and impudent Ethiopians who are allowed to
infest the existing boats) will be allowed, but that profes-
sional vocalists from the operas will be º that the
engine-smoke will be self-consumed, that the captains will
be manly but graceful officers, and that all the little boys
will be accustomed to the use of a pocket handkerchief.
Further, the genteel boats must stop at no low places, but
must have exclusive landing piers, with lighted tunnels
leading into respectable neighbourhoods. Also, credit for
|fares must be given, or at least there must be subscription
| tickets, for the payment of ready money is revolting to a
refined nature. If attention be paid to these, and a few
other º and the Thames is properly cleansed, and
embanked, river, navigation may be once more possible to
#r. Punch and the rest of the aristocracy.
WHAT’S TO BE OUR NEXT TROUBLEP
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, -

|ling and destroying one another and the comfort of a poor
old woman like me? “MARTHA CADDY.”
However, BETTER LATE THAN, NEVER.—WHAT would
ou call the Government’s detention of the Delhi Prize
§§ ? Extremely Delhi-tory.
WAR TO THE WIFE AND CHILDREN 1
The principal merchants and lawyers of New York, assembled in a
sort of caucus, have passed a string of resolutions, of which this
is one:–
“Resolved—That every day's delay complicates our relations both foreign and
domestic, gives the rebels strength, and is wasting hundreds of good and true men;
and it is far better that every rebel should perish than that one more loyal soldier
should die.”
For that reason it is but logical to resolve that the most prompt and
expeditious steps ought to be taken to preclude the death of any one
more Federal soldier by effecting the entire, extermination of every
Confederate. From the premises above stated, accordingly, is deduced
the following conclusion:-
“And therefore it is that we, with entire unanimity, most respectfully and most
earnestly call upon the President to act in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of
the Army and Navy of the United States, and immediately issue the order which
will take from the rebels their great source of strength, while it will diminish their
army, by calling to the defence of their homes large numbers of rebel officers and
men."
That is to say, they call upon the President to decree the emancipa-
tion, and excite an insurrection, of the negroes. To carry the war into
the enemy's camp is bold generalship, but the foregoing invocation
demands something bolder. It is a request for carrying the war into
the enemy's parlour, the enemy's drawing-room, the enemy's boudoir,
GENERAL BUTLER, of course, would be the fittest leader of those black
bands, the alarm of whose rising would call the “rebel” forces “to the
defence of their homes.”. It would be a service of danger to the
gallant General, however, for he might ; taken prisoner, and fall into
the hands of the exasperated Southern ladies—in which case who can
tell what might not happen to him?
The Yankees who propose to rouse the Southern blacks to mutiny
and massacre, and Sepoyinvasion of the domestic sanctuary, are described
as including “all the leading men in the commercial and legal commu-
nities of New York.” It is surprising that such persons should be
inflamed with a loyalty so enthusiastic as to smother every other
human feeling, except devotion towards the Almighty Dollar, which
is doubtless, an equally powerful motive impelling them to exhort
others to fight for . in order to maintain the Union, and consequently
the Tariff whereby they desire and expect to thrive at the expense of
the South. But Southern loyalty is as staunch as their own, although
not so truculent and atrocious. Why call their antagonists names?
Why term them “rebels?” . The Confederates are as loyal to JEFF.
Davis as the forefathers of the Federals were to WASHINGTON, The
principal Yankees of New York, indeed, may consider, for their own
part, that the perdition of every individual in the Southern States is
preferable to the decease of one of their own mercenaries. This senti:
ment they expect will be endorsed by, “the whole civilised world.”
They seem to have formed very, peculiar ideas of civilisation. The
whole civilised world will º wish that it could buy such highly self-
appraising people at a just valuation, and sell them at their own.
A European Operation.
A DISTINGUISHED Surgeon has urgently advised Louis NAPOLEON
immediately to withdraw the French army from Rome, on the ground
that it excites that inflammation in Italy which is necessarily produced
by the presence, in any important part, of a foreign body.
THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS DAY.
It is said that there is nothing new under the sun, but CAPTAIN
Fowke happily enables us to put an end to that monotonous saying,
for there is no, denying that to him belongs, the rare merit of being,
(as proved by the International Exhibition,) the dish-cover-er of a new
style of architecture.

THE MARRIAGE MOVEMENT AMONG THE
PRIESTS.
The old saying, that when the cat is away the mice will play, is plea-
santly verified by the facts recorded in the subjoined extracts from a
news-letter dated at Rome:—
“A correspondent of the Osservatore Romané, writing from Bologna, announces
the marriage of a priest, named ANToNio GiovaNETT1, with a lady named Domenica
CAPANNI. The witnesses were a DR. ZANI and an ex-monk, now a heretic, named
Pompºo Rossi. The correspondent observes that the last act in apostacy, as in
comedies and farces, is always a marriage.
“Certainly there are individuals to be found in every class who are eager to take
advantage of the new state of things in Italy, and the change could not be more
ºł. than by the public marriage of a priest in the quondam dominions
of his Holiness, or the public preaching of Protestant doctrines in the heart of
iº,:* now the case every evening in a palazzo in the Toledo, near the Largo
e .”
According to a vulgar British adage, matrimony and hanging go by
destiny....What led i. artificer who made that saw to connect matri-
mony with capital punishment it is difficult to imagine, unless it was the
hazy discernment of a certain analogy between a wedding and an
execution; the hymenteal knot and the hangman's noose: the altar and
the halter.
The correspondent of the Osservatore Romano, for his part, associates
marriage with apostacy in a remark which is unintelligible further than
as apparently intended for a sneer. It is a wonder that so satirical a
rsonage neglected to interpolate an additional N into the name of DR.
ANI for the sake of making a sarcastic remark on the curious coinci-
dence by which the marriage of a priest happened to be attested by an
ex-monk now a heretic, and a zanni or zany.
Many priests have petitioned the Pope to let them marry. He
refuses. Hence. Protestantism and marriage are evidently going
together, at a rapid rate, in the former dominions of the Pope and those
of his friend BoMBA. We see that, no sooner is the Papal and Bour-
bonic pressure removed, than priests marry and are given in marriage
and preach the Gospel. #. also an ecclesiastic, M. l'Abb
BRou DE LAURIERE, has successfully asserted his right as a French
citizen, though a priest, to take to wife MADEMOISELLE ELIZABETH De
FREssänges. Happiness to their bolster!, His Holiness would do a
deep thing in sacrificing an absurdity, which is not a #. to com;
mon sense. The celibacy of the clergy is only a point of discipline, and
of discipline not particularly conducive to morality. Why does, he not
decree the abolition of enforced clerical bachelorship P. It would be a
splendid coup d'Eºlise... He has made many a bull, but this would be no
blunder, no mistake. This would be a much, brighter idea than that of
the Immaculate Conception. What a lot of both religious and political
capital the Holy Father might make out of that easy concession of
practice, not principle, to Christian liberty! By compounding for
superstition with human nature he might long retard the dry-rot of the
chair which he calls St. Peter's... But no. He will not throw an empty
tub out of the bark of PETER, albeit for the sake of catching a whale,
or even of preventing the whale from upsetting the vessel. He
is asked to let his clergy marry. He cannot say Non Possumus to
this reasonable demand; but like an obstinate and unwise old gen-
tleman, he replies Non Volumus. How much more worthy of...a
Holy if not a Heavy Father to tell the priest who wants a wiſe
“There, take her and be happy,” and give the couple an apostolical
benediction in the words “Bless ye, my children l’” -
Nobody can foresay what is possible or impossible. There is no
knowing where the marriage-movement in the popish priesthood will
end. A future Pontiff will perhaps sanction sacerdotal matrimony, and
then what will there be to hinder him from taking, the benefit of his
own act? Then the Pope will indeed lead a happy life, with his lawful
lady at the head of his table, children climbing his paternal knee, and a
nursery somewhere at the top of the Vatican. Then will his Holiness
the Pope be a Papa indeed.

The American organ in London (we don't mean the London American,
Northern, or the Inder, Southern Journal) has re-printed some verses
which it says are by MR. BRYANT, the poet. We rather hope that it
is misinformed. MR. BRYANT has written so many admirable things

really clever man make a mistake. However, MR. BRYANT's or not,
here they are, and we don't like them.
TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
On his Demand for 300,000 men.
We're coming, Father ABRAAM, we're coming all along,
But don't you think you're coming it yourself a little strong?
Three hundred thousand might be called a pretty tidy figure, .
We’ve nearly sent you white enough, why don't you take the nigger?
Consider, Father ABRAAM, and give the thing a thought,
This war has just attained four times the longitude it ought;
And all the bills at Ninety Days as you have draw’d so free,
Have been dishonoured, ABRAAM, as punctual as could be.
We've fought, old Father ABRAAM, and fought uncommon bold,
And gained amazing victories, or so at least we’re told;
And ſº whipped the rebels for: twelvemonth and a day,
We nearly found 'em liquoring in Washington in May.
Now, really, Father ABRAAM, this here's the extra ounce,
And we are almost sick, § see, of such almighty bounce;
We ain't afraid of being killed at º times and seasons,
But it’s aggravating to be killed for MAC's strategic reasons.
If you’d be so obliging, Father ABRAAM, as to write
To any foreign potentate, and put the thing polite,
And make him loan a General as knows the way to lead,
We’d come and list. Jerusalem and snakes' we would indeed.
But as the matter stands, Old ABE, we’ve this opinion, some,
If you say Côme, as citizens of course we're bound to come,
But then we want to win, you see; if Strategy prevents,
We wish you’d use the nigger for these here experiments.
Hereditary bondsman, he should just be made to know
He’d convenience us uncommon if he’d take and strike a blow.
The man as will not fight for freedom isn’t worth a cuss,
And it’s better using niggers up than citizens like us.
So, Father ABRAAM, if you please, in this here game of chess,
You’d better take the black men against the white, I guess,
And if you work the niggers off before Rebellion's slain,
Which surely ain't expectable, apply to us again.
OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
THERE is an old saying to the effect that extremes meet, and it is
certain, that rencontre takes, place in the International £xhibition.
When John Bull, is tired of his machinery he rushes off to the gallery
of pictures. With a patriotism, which I do not care to disavow, I in.
spected our own collection first. True there are hundreds of works here
which we have seen before, but who can say they have less interest on
that account? Why are Morma and in Sºnnamihui, and jo, Giovanni,
and Il Barbiere sure of drawing houses? Because we know their
music by heart: because Ah . is the same plaintiff appeal that we
heard twenty }. ago, and when Figaro begins his tol de roling we
recognise an old friend... LESLIE, LANDSFER, Hunt, and MILLAIs have
long been favourites of the British public, and our eyes return again
an º to their canvas with pleasure. ...Here is “Sancho Panza” the
friend of our youth, and there is good “Sir Roger on his way to Church.”
We are in." Bolton Abbey” º; prospectively on savoury venison,
or “Shooting deer in the forest of Glenorchy.” Seven years have not
robbed “Autumn, Leaves” of their luscious colour, and our “Apple
Blossoms” are still in, flower. In the corner there is a little crowd
which is eager, but does not jostle, which admires, but in no noisy
mood, for we are standing before “The Light of the World,” perhaps
the most famous picture of our school in Sacred Art.
But there are two names in our Fine Art Catalogue, the ſame of
which is not confined to England or to Europe—two men who will be
remembered as long as the limner's art exists. HogaRTH and REY-
NoLDs died before the age of Exhibitions, but their works would be an
acquisition to any #"; in the Universe. Between the stern satire in
the “Marriage à la Mode” and the charming simplicity in the “Age
of Innocence,” there is a great hiatus; but how wonderfully true to
nature is each in its way. HogaRTH taught Englishmen how to paint,
and, let us hope, how to live with honesty. . REYNoLDs first showed us
how our women and children might be admired, without being deified,
On canvas.
Look, at the , incidents in Hogarth’s “Strolling Actresses,” the
truth, the fun, the humanity of the picture. The pretty tragedian to
the left learning her part, and the vixen to whose caresses even pussy
will not submit. There is another lady anointing her hair with a tallow
candle before a broken, glass, while she clutches, the flour dredger to
complete her toilet. There is Cupid mounting a ladder to get a pair of
stockings, and here is the *'' dragon feedingababy (St. George's?) with
a pap-spoon. Such scenes have passed from among us now. Even
Richardson is on the wane, and hair powder only lingers on the heads
of lacqueys; but as we look at this picture, we feel it is, no made-up
º no hacknied composition; and we sympathise with the sturdy
little painter and his contempt for the grand school, when he struck out
in a line of his own, even if it were not that line of beauty of which
he fondly prated.
Oh, that our modern portrait painters would take a hint from good
SIR Joshua, who when he had to paint a lady, did not forget that she
was a woman and not a milliner's doll! Here is the Duchess of
DEvoN with her baby romping and crowing on her knee; and the first
thing we learn about her is, not that she wears, a coronet, but that she

exceptions, we have not limned the like since
M“CLELLAN CUNCTATOR.
By one of REUTER’s Telegrams from New York we are informed
that—
“The popular confidence in GENERAL M'CLELLAN appears shaken by the late
events before Richmond, and many of his admirers now assert that he is not the
man of action."
None but the admirers of M'CLELLAN, however, could, we should
think, make that assertion. M'CLELLAN was for a long time a man of
inaction; but he has now gone into action only too often, Fighting
is action and running away is action, and M'Clellan has both fought
and run away. It is absurd to say that a general who executes a
strategic movement is not a man of action, although the action is that
of retreating. Whilst GENERAL M'CLELLAN remained inactive, his
countrymen called him, the young NATOLEoN, in anticipation of the
victories which he had not achieved. They would have had better
reason for calling him the young FABIUs; but events haye, shown that
the latter nº is as inapp icable to him as the former. It has not been
the lot of M'CLELLAN 'to win like FABIUs, by delay;” for the cunc-
tation of M'CELLAN CUNCTATOR has ended in a stampede on the
Chickahominy.
“Muggy Weather."
To most persons this particular kind of weather is most oppressive,
not fit to do anything upon, but a photogra her, takes a very different
view of it. He calls that weather “muggy” which is the best adapted
for taking a person's “mug.”

THE UMBRELLA QUESTION ;
Or what it would have come to, if Some People had had their way.
MARRIAGE BY ADWERTISEMENT.
. Do people ever answer matrimonial advertisements?. For instance,
is there any lady living who would ever condescend to forward a reply
to such a one as this?—
WAN TED, by a Widower, to Correspond with a Lady, in the middle
ranks of society, with a view to Matrimony. Must be between 35 and 45 years
of age, of good character, moderately educated, and of a cheerful disposition. This
is bond ſide, and the strictest honour will be observed.—Address A9, at the printer's.
“Beware of widows,” was the caution of the elder Mr. Weller; and
to judge by this advertisement, ladies who fear insult on the subject of
their age, had best beware of Widowers. What a brute the man must
be to ask a lady to confess to him that she is five-and-thirty! We
recoil from such a monster with virtuous disgust, and cite another
notice, cut from the same sheet:—
A YOUNG MAN, aged 23, with an income of £300 per annum, wishes
to meet with a Young Lady, with a view to Matrimony. Those wishing for a
portrait must enclose 13 stamps.-Address X, Post-office, Sheffield.
There are sharp blades at Sheffield; and X is clearly one of them.
To our mind his advertisement reads simply like a trap to catch a lot
of postage stamps; for curiosity is by no means an uncommon female
#. and many a girl, we fear, would forward him the thirteen
stamps, if only just to see if X be good-looking or not. , We should
ourselves incline to hazard a guess that he is not; for whatever be in
other points his symmetry of feature, it seems plain enough to us, from
: ture of his notice, that he has a most enormous quantity of
eek.

OUR Scottish friends certainly know how to do some things plea-
santly. We read in the Interness Courier that there has been a gathering
in the Island of Eigg in honour of a gentleman named MAceh ERson.
The proceedings were of the most Rabelaisian character, and the good
PANTAGRUEL, FRIAR John, and PANURGE, would have enjoycd them-
selves thoroughly. Audin' 6 bone. There was a capital dinner; then
came bowls .reeking º ; the party then retired to the Green, where
they heard an eloquent a dress from the above Mr. MACPHERSON,
“On the importance of an early education,” and then they instantly
began “dancing reels with real Highland glee to the strains of the
bagpipe.” Who says that there is no fun in Scotland P. Where is this
Eigg, and is it the place we used to know as Egg, and put in a
geographical leash with Rum and Muck? We intend to visit Eigg
the first time we are in the Hebrides. and we are the more desirous to
find it out, because we read that the bravehearted Eiggites are jolly in
spite of what would be considered by the effeminate as trying circum-
stances. “The poor people,” says the Inverness Courier, “who are
not able to buy coals are very ill off for fire, as last year's peats are
done, and great doubts are entertained whether they will get any this
year.” This is not as it should be. We always feel inclined to snub
a party who tells you of his misfortunes in a melancholy manner; but
a man who suffers jollily deserves to be helped. There is a worthy
minister in Eigg, the REVEREND MR. GRANT. We wonder whether if
any of Mr. Punch's readers sent him a Post Office Qrder to help the
§.3. Eiggites to buy coals, he would get it, and be glad to get it.
e dare say that SIR. Rowland HILL's Early Education would enable
him to forward the letters to the right quarter. Try it, somebody, and
tell Mr. Punch the result.

AN instrument has been invented which is called a Debuscope; and
unscientific persons possibly imagine that it is something in the
nature of an opera-glass; as an opera-glass is often used in witnessing

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August llth. In the House of lords the Head Charwoman
took her seat on the Woolsack about two o'clock, and declared that it
was heart-breaking to see how the dust got into everything, and spoiled
a place that had cost so much money. Charwoman BRiggs suggested
that the remarks did honour to the heart of the previous speaker, but
that it was no particular business of theirs. dº WoRBLER,
who had been sitting on the bottom of a reversed pail, moved, as an
amendment, to the cross bench. Beer was then introduced, drunk a
first time, and the vessel was ordered to stand upon the table. It being
º: by a Chargirl that the pewter would make rings on the
walnut wood, notice was given that she had better shut up. The
House then rose, and was left scouring.
In the Commons, Window-cleaner SMITH took a general survey of
the work to be performed, and made some severe strictures upon the
new works at Westminster Bridge, which tended to increase the
amount of dust. Assistant Jones said that he was unable to detect
the utility of cleansing the windows until the Nobs should re-assemble,
but was vehemently called to order by Assistant BRown, who professed
the most unhesitating contempt for any person who having undertaken
a task, objected to complete it. MR. Jones said he had made no ob-
jections, and º that in all probability it was MR. B.Rown's
desire to get his head punched. MR BROWN having denied this, and
in the alternative, disputing the capability of MR. Jones to perform that
office, an acrimonious debate occurred, which ended in mutual expla.
nations and beer.
Tuesday. In the Lords, Duster-in-Chief RoBINsoN laid all the cushions
on the table, and retired early.
In the Commons, the debate on the utility of cleaning the windows
until after the winter was resumed by MR. PuTTY, who said that in
another week they would be as dirty as they then were, especially if
that kind of weather were #. to last. MR. GRUBBLE did not see
what call MR. PUTTY had to make obnoxious remarks upon the weather,
He himself had cleaned the windows in that House for many years, and
could unhesitatingly affirm that there was always some kind of weather
or other. MR. Dobbs expressed his unalterable conviction that MR.
PUTTY had been, was, and always would be an old pump. MR PUTTY
said that those persons would in all probability be disappointed who
expected . from a pig but a grunt. In reply to an inquiry who
the honourable speaker, meant by pigs, MR. PUTTY recommended the
querist to find out, as in that case he would certainly know.
Wednesday. A petition was presented from ToMMY and ETHELINDA-
AUGUSTA CLINGH, younger children of MRs. CLINGH, of Westminster,
stating that their mother was engaged during the day in scouring the
Royal Gallery, and requesting that they . be permitted to be
present with her, as it was so dull to be locked up in an attic. A
considerable discussion arose, and MRs. CLINCH was called in and
examined by the Duster-in-Chief RoPINson...She stated that she was
no party to the petition, but would feel gratification were it granted.
Being asked whether she would pledge herself for the decorous conduct
of the petitioners, she replied that she had not herself known much of
angels, except such as were seen in pictures and on tombstones, which
ou were not like yourselves, and you could not expect children to be,
ut though she said it as shouldn't say it, two better conducted children
was not to be found in the liberties of Westminster. The assurance was
objected to as somewhat vague in terms, but upon the witness's under-
taking that the petitioners would throw no stones at the statues or fres-
coes, and that personal correction should follow any screaming or other
objectionable demonstration, the prayer was granted until further notice,
MRs. Duster, DoRBINs observed that there was no saying what
the sight of them statues might perduce upon children, and it might
bend their minds to become painters or what-not. MRs. Duster Flick
concurred, and related an anecdote in her own, family, one of whose
members had become a respectable painter and glazier from inspirations
received while seeing a relative paint a door.
In the Commons, the Head Charwoman stated that the cleaning that
chamber was another thing from cleaning the House of Lords, and that
the state of the floor was perfectly awful. Charwoman WobbleR said
she believed that the Lords were much greater gentlemen than the
Commons, that they never wore a pair of shoes twice, and came to the
House in beautifully carpeted carriages, which tº: the cleanli-
ness of it. Charwoman BRIGGS's husband worked for a shoemaker,
and knew that some Members of Parliament had the meanness to let
their shoes be soled and heeled when wearing out. The Head Char-
woman observed that they were much more careful of their own money
than of other people's. Charwoman WoRBLER replied that the Head
Charwoman might say that. The Head Charwoman was quite aware
of the fact that she might, and when she wanted information she should
apply to some other shop than MRs. WobbleR's for the article. Char-
woman WobbleR said that she had meant nothing. Charwoman
BRIGGs thought that if she meant nothing her best way would be to say
nothing. Charwoman WoRBLER requested Charwoman BRIggs to
mind her own business, adding, that there was such a thing as pretend-
ing to scour and leaving a place so that, somebody else had to go after
one. An animated discussion arose, and the Head Charwoman ex

her authority in vain, when the proceedings were brought to an end by a
message from Charwoman WobbleR's husband, to the effect that if his
dinner were not ready in five minutes, the delay might not conduce to
MRs. WobbleR’s physical comfort.
Thursday. A report was presented in the Lords upon the subject of
the admission to the Royal Gallery yesterday fº. to the younger
CLINCHEs. MRs. Duster DoRBINs observed that she brought up the
matter unwillingly, having been strongly in favour of the admission
but when she found that it had been stretched to include a kitten an
a cart full of oyster-shells, she felt bound to, mention as much., MRs.
CLINch was again summoned, and stated that she had not thought
there was any harm in the kitten, as it was blind and could not walk,
and had therefore been in, the youngest petitioner's pinafore, all day;
Pressed on the oyster-shells, the witness fenced with the question, and
made a statement to the effect that they must have been left in the
House of Lords by one of the Bishops or the LORP CHANCELLOR, as
no child of hers had brought them in. She was ordered into custody
of Duster BLOBBINs j. Duster DoRBINs was constituted a Com-
mission for the examination of THOMAs CLINCH. She shortly returned
and stated that the infant in question understood the nature of an oath,
an amount of education due to the emphatic conversation of his parents,
and that he had frankly admitted that the oyster-shells, were the
leavings of his mother's supper of the previous night. The witness
CLINCH denied this, and offered to º in the whole Court in which
she lived to prove that she could not bear hoysters until there was a
haitch in the month, also volunteering a statement of her resolution to
teach THOMAS CLiNCH, a lesson which he would not easily forget.
Duster FLICK then said she should interfere in the interest of the
petitioners, who appeared to have done no jºi She moved that the
oyster-shells be thrown away, and that unless MRs. CLINCH. gave an
undertaking not to punish the petitioner THQMAs, she be discharged
from her situation in that House. The undertaking having been given,
the matter dropped.
In the Commons a conference took place between the Housekeeper,
on the part of Government, and the scourers generally. The proceed-
ings were confined to a strong expression of opinion on the part of the
former lady that of all the lazy and careless people ever employed in that
edifice the present party showed themselves least mindful of their duty
to the country and the constitution, and to an intimation that whether
the floors were done or not done, the scourers would not come there
after that day. Some criticisms added by the Housekeeper upon the
character of the washing at certain points were given in a conversational
tone inaudible in the Gallery. Something like “all very fine talking”
reached us, as the Housekeeper left, but there was no further observa-
tion, and the increased vehemence of scrubbing induces us to believe
at once in the justice and the efficacy of the censure.
Friday. MRs. Duster Dobbins wished to enter into a personal expla-
nation. It had been her misfortune, from her youth upwards, to be
afflicted with spagms, as was well known to her afflicted husband and
the whole of her neighbours. She scorned to deceive the House, and
was in the habit of carrying a small bottle of peppermint, in which there
was the slightest addition of gin. When engaged in her duties yesterday
afternoon, and feeling a recurrence of disagreeable sensations, she had
recourse to this remedy. A Party whom she could name, but would
rather not, had remarked in the most unfeeling manner, “Laying the
dust, old girl, eh?” She was not an old girl, but a respectable married
woman, and her lines could be seen at Standrewobun, which they might
send for them if they liked, and she did not think that any one could be
expected to do their duty by them stained glasses if they were to be
agitated by personal remarks. The Head Duster thought that work
§: not to be interrupted to listen to botherations of that kind, and
if MRs. Dobbiss's skin was so thin that she could not bear a joke, she
had better get a thicker. . Dobbins at once declined to accept
this advice, and should retire from the House. MRs. BLOBBINs thought
it possible that they might contrive to find some consolation even
should such an event happen. MRs. Dobbins was not in the least
anxious to be placed in possession of articles of such small intrinsic
value as MRs. BLORBINs's thoughts. MRs. FLICK said that she could
º: bring a painful discussion to a pleasant termination. She had
been the person, to use the language complained of, but so far from
intending anything offensive to MRs. Dobbins, whom indeed she had
always loved and venerated next to her own mother, she had intended
to finish her sentence by saying that she could offer her somethin
better to lay the dust with than that chemist's stuff. What she sai
she meant, and no person could charge her with insincerity, and if
MRs. DoEBINs were agreeable, she would on the adjournment of the
House stand anything she liked to put a name to. MRs. Dobbins,
much affected, begged pardon of everybody present, and in a voice
almost inaudible for sobs, lamented her sensitiveness, but protested
that her heart was in the right place. The Head Duster suggested
that if the last speaker's duster were in the right place, instead
of being used in the light of a pocket handkerchief, it would be as wel
and MRs. DoEBINs, remarking that when people got up in the worl
§: arts too often got gruel and gallows, resumed her operations on
e stained window.
In the Commons, the Housekeeper, entering at half-past :
expressed a feeling of satisfaction that the scourers had got out, mingle
with one of dissatisfaction at the way they had done fl. work. She
then moved the House into Committee, consisting of herself and two
housemaids, to consider how the table should É. cleaned of the ink-
stains. Miss Rosa Teigh said that the Ministers must be very dirty
men; in fact, pigs. Why could they not wipe their pens on their coats,
or in their hair, instead of flinging them down, and making a mess of
the furniture?, Miss NELLY GRAY expressed a decided conviction that
they did not do such things at home, and she offered to be bound that
LADY PALMERSTON, or MRs. GLADstoNE would say something if they
saw an inky pen dashed down on their mahogany, Miss LEIGH called
attention to the fact that there was very little ink on the opposition
side, which showed what she had always said, that the Tories were
gentlemen. Miss GRAY said that it showed the notorious ignorance
ºf the Tories, who could not write, and so did not use pens. Miss
irich dared say. Miss GRAY said we knew. Miss LEigh said we
knew, a good deal, no doubt. The Housekeeper requested that they
would hold their silly tongues. The question was, how was that ink to
be got out?, Miss LEIGH said that she would advise sending for a
carpenter, and having the table planed. Miss GRAY had heard a riddle
bearing on that—she forgot how it went ; but it meant that the car-
penter would be much uglier after doing it, because he would be a deal
plainer, Miss LEIGH said the table was not of deal. , Miss GRAY had
not said it was...The Housekeeper had a good mind to try lemon juice.
Miss LEIGH said that would play the juice and all with the colour, and
amid, the laughter which this observation excited the House resumed,
the Housekeeper taking up her . and porte-monnaie, and Miss
IgEIGH and Miss GRAY polking together until they knocked up against
the Bar, when the House adjourned to dinner at one.
“OH, MY TOE!”
CoRRESPONDENT of the Hampshire Advertiser, under
the initials of J.S., abuses us angrily for having as:
cribed the sacrilegious abstraction of certain bits of
encaustic pavement at Netley Abbey, of which we
had been credibly informed, to archaeological acquisi-
tiveness. He charges us with “malignity,” and with
speaking of antiquaries “in a style that one would
scarce expect from a costermonger, and certainly not
- ... from a gentleman.” We also are apparently meant
by him in describing certain visitors to Netley Abbey as “those who
make a mock at truth, and for the sake of a laugh tear down those thin
which, though, trifling in themselves, are valued for their rarity by
those who really can appreciate them.”. We cannot make out this
latter accusation, or understand on what it can be founded besides the
mere feeling which has §º J. S. to vituperate us for suggestin
that the relics of which Netley Abbey was said to have been ;
had been stolen by antiquarian thieves. We are afraid we have trodden
on this gentleman's corns.
“NOW THEN, YOU Two!”
ALDERMAN FINNIs! ALDERMAN FINNIs! What, man, hast no
more reverence P. What do we mean? Why, we mean this. The
newspapers say that a man was brought before, you the other day, you
Magistrate, charged with sticking up a placard where he had no busi-
ness to put it, and that in the course of your objurgatory remarks,
you said:–
“Every gentleman's Fº paling is chalked over with puffs of HARPER Twelve-
TREES's preparations. h I had HARPER TWELVETREEs in that dock. I'd let
him know, &c.”
FINNIs, is this the way to talk of the great vermin-powder, maker
and philanthropist? Punch wonders that some prodigy did not happen.
He is surprised that, the “little insects did not come out” of the
ceiling of the Court (there are plenty), and give praise, rubbing their
legs together,” as was written in a hifti article in the Cornhill.
They must have exulted in this defiance of their enemy. We admit that
you have something of a grievance. Mr. Punch himself has been offended
while serenely gazing upon a country hedge, and watching the small
birds, (and execrating the stupid clowns who kill them) at reading a vilely
written invitation to try HARPER TwelvetREEs's something or other.
Mr. Punch has vainly tried to imagine a person who has recourse to
such vulgarities as a dignified philanthropist, who makes speeches, and
has hopes of Parliament. But the Doc FINNis, would be rather a
strong measure. Let TwelveTREEs, however, take the Aldermanic
hint, and abstain from chalking park palings, or, if he will do it, let him
write better, for his puffs are reall j. in a way that revolts an
admirer of education. If he thinks to come into Parliament and be
smiled upon by PAM, he must improve his writing, for PALMERSTON
notoriously declares that “a man who writes a, bad hand is a fool.”
Consider this HARPER, and you, FINNIs, be moderate in your wrath.

must not exceed 6s. per week. Address, &c.
We trust we may presume that this Governess, although a daily one,
is not required to work on Sundays. If this be so, she will but have to
teach for eighteen hours a week, in order to secure her weekly stipend
of six shillings. Fourpence an hour, it is true, is no great pay; but
then just consider how easy is the work for it. For instance, teachin
French to an adult who cannot read: what can well be easier than such
a daily labour? An hour a º would surely be quite ample to suffice
for it; and there would still be left so much as half-an-hour apiece for
English, and the Reading, and the Music, and the Singing. The only
danger seems to be that the mind of the adult might somewhat be con.
fused by learning five lessons at once. But possibly the studies might
in some way be amalgamated: and as the multiplication table is some-
times set to music, perhaps the same thing might be done with LINDLEY
*: rammar, and with early reading lessons both in English
and ln rrencil.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SUICIDE BY CRINOLINE.
N the name of common sense, dear ladies, hear
what DR. LANKESTER, the Čoroner whom Mr.
- Punch brought in for Central Middlesex, has to
ST say upon the subject of your crinoline excres-
cences:–
“CRINoLINE ACCIDENT.-DR. LANKESTER, the Coroner for
Central Middlesex, held an inquest at the Bank of England
Tavern, Cambridge Place. Paddington, yesterday, touching
the death of MRs. SARAn PADLEY, 18 years of age, residing
at 6, Buckingham Terrace, Bayswater. Thomas SPENCE
alodger at 6, Buckingham Terrace, deposed that on Sunday, at 11,20 A.M., he hea
loud screams issuing from a room on }. first floor. He ran to the spot and found the
clothes of the deceased in flames. He seized a piece of carpet from the floor, enveloped
her in it, and threw her upon the landing, by which means he succeeded in extinguish-
ing the fire before life was quite extinct, but not until every particle of the dress of the
deceased, except her boots, was completely consumed. The body was frightfullyburnt.
Two rooms had been set on fire. On the arrival of the husband (who was absent at the
time) immediately afterwards, he set to work to extinguish the fire, and succeeded
in doing so. MARIA MAsoN, a sister of the deceased, said she was wearing at the
time a muslin dress, extended by crinoline, and having occasion to cross the room,
the skirt of her dress got ignited from the fire in a grate. The flames spread rapidly
before assistance arrived. The Coroner said it was, as he feared, one of those nume-
rously distressing casualties from the use of the dangerous crinoline. Such cases
were very much more numerous than the public generally supposed, because, being
ublic journals. If
now of them, and
abandoned. The jury, acting
death
now so common, many of them were never reported in the
every fatal crinoline accident were reported the public would
then he felt assured that crinoline would soon be
upon a suggestion from the Coroner, returned a verdict of ‘Accidentii
through wearing crinoline.’”
When Fashion enters the door, Common Sense too generally flies
out of the window. . So of course Punch cannot wonder that you ladies
will wear crinoline, in spite of all the danger and the nuisance of your
doing so. But some of you do sometimes heed a medical opinion, when
other warnings fail to penetrate your brainpans; and possibly a few of
you may be deterred from wearing crinoline by thinking of the caution
R. LANKESTER puts forth. ...You ladies are not given much to reading
of the newspapers, yet possibly, the plan which DR. LANKESTER sug-
gests, that every accident through crinoline should be mentioned by the
}. might help somewhat to frighten you and bring you to your senses.
mproving on the hint (what is there Punch cannot improve upon P)
Punch would suggest that every paper should set aside a column for
these crinoline reports, and, to mark it out for notice, should edge it
with deep black. “Baths through Crinolint.” Punch thinks, should
be chronicled apart, so as to catch the eye of the most hurried and most
hasty reader. . As another strong deterrent, Punch also would suggest
that, when crinoline is plainly proved to be the cause of death, the ver:
dict of the jury should be simply that of “SUICIDE.”. It might be well
perhaps in some cases to add the words “committed in a Ét of fash.
ionable insanity;” for, after all that has been said about the danger
and the nuisance and the ugliness of crinoline, the mind of any woman
who still persists in wearing it cannot possibly be held to be at all in
a sound state.
MORALS AND MUSIC HALLS.
(A Confidential Letter to ToM TURNIPTOPPE, Esquire, late of Greenley
Bottom, Blankshire, and now of Blackstone Buildings, Temple.)
MY DEAR ToM,
You are a ..ºf man from the country, and have seen little of
town: I am-well, say thirty, and have seen a good deal of it. You
have come up, as you say, to “read” at MR. BLUEBAGGE's Chambers
and among the various papers which you will there peruse, you will of
course take care to read your weekly Punch. So what I have to say
now is as sure to meet your eye as would be MR. SAYERs' mauley, if
you put on the gloves with him.
As your memory is young, you may not have forgotten that the other
night I talked to you upon the subject which the heading of this letter
serves to indicate; still I think it is as well to put in writing somewhat
of the sound sense I imparted to you, for “segniès irritant—” (you
know what our friend #. says), and after a good dinner and a
glass or two of Claret, the voice of wisdom sometimes fails to reach the
ears of youth.
You were telling me that evening in sentimental confidence that you
really "rather liked” your pretty Cousin Jessie, and that, now she is
away from town enjoying the sea air, you found your evenings at your
uncle's, where you are living “awful slow.” ere it not that the Old
Buffer (I think that was how you christened him), allowed you to go
out directly after dinner, and let you have a latch-key, ind come in
when you liked, you said you feared you might be tempted to cut your
#." or swallow half a pound of prassic acid, just to pass away the
line.
Qn this hint Ispake, and asked you where you mostly went to spend
* the "ºf as you young men call the hours between nine p.m. and
three. Well, I was not sorry to learn that, as you are not a dancing-
man, you do not much incline to visit the Casinos. But I was not
so pleased to ſind that forasmuch as Yºº like singing, you now and
then drop in at what are called the “Music” Halls. My dear boy,
º can’t fancy you hear music at these places. Stupid, sense.
less, silly, coarse and vulgar comic songs are surely not entitled to the
name of Music; any more than clap-trap chorusses, with every singer
squalling out of time and tune, or noisy nigger melodies with bones and
tambourine kick-stamp-and-jump accompaniments. And pray, what
music is there in the feats of Bounding Brothers, and gymnasts who
ape gorillas, and contortionists in j and clowns who dance in
clogs? These are the chief attractions at the Music Halls just now
and what music is attempted is performed in such a din of talking
tongues, and bustling boots, and jingling glasses, that scarce two notes
together can ever reach the ear.
No, nº, mydear boy, don't try to deceive yourself or think to gammon
me. It is not the * music,” as you call it, that you go for. Nor do
you attend there as a votary of Bacchus or of baccy, for the drinks are
simply beastly, and you get your smoke at home. What you go for is
society, and to speak out, more, particularly feminine society. You are
young: you can talk; and (if the lips be pretty) you are fond of being
talked to. While, JEssie was in town you were content with her
society; nay, I will so far give you credit as really to believe you pre:
ferred her conversation, simple prattle as it is, to the fast jokes and
coarse slang, which with Music Hall frequenters pass for epigrams
; wit. But now JEssIE is away, yº. elsewhere for conso-
at 10n. -
Well, well...Such is life, and such is human nature. Boys will be
boys, and * will have its fling. There were no Music Halls to go
to in the ays when I was young; but there were dirty dens of vice
called “Theâtre Saloons,” and Ifancy that in some respects Saloons
and Music Halls were about much of a muchness. So I’ve no mind to
throw stones, or to preach a flinty sermon to you. But will you at
your leisure just ask yourself the question, will your Music Hall society
do you good, or, harm, and is not your indulgence in it just a little
selfish P Is it fair to Jessie, who you think does “care a little” for
you, to seek in questionable company a solace for her absence? Will
you thereby make yourself more fit for her society, and at all enhance
§ for her pure companionship?. After the fast company the
Music Halls afford you, may not JEssie's artless prattle appear a trifle
slow, †. fill her ears be charmed or shocked by º slang your tongue
ls used to
Qh, there really is no harm in a Music Hall, you, say. It's not like
a Casino or a Bal, immoral. Well, peradventure it is not; although in
one, and that the worst, respect I own I have my doubts about it.
But is it quite the place for a gentleman to go to, or even for a green-
grocer, a chimneysweep, or costermonger, or “any other, man,” (as
your nonsensical slang goes), who entertains a liking to be thought
respectable * A husband has of course no secrets from his wife; but
when by any accident he drops in at a Music Hall, do you think she
always may depend upon his mentioning it? Would you like Jessie
to know that you frequent such !. ?—especially if she have seen the
following description of them, which was prominently printed not long
since in the Observer:—
“It is, however, in the disgraceful scenes enacted in the drinking bars and sa-
loons attached to these “halls' that the greatest evil exists—evils which cannot fail
of exercising a fatal influence upon the frequenters of these places, of both sexes,
who, in the first instance, “go to hear a song,' but become initiated in vice and im:
morality, rendered more easy and dangerous by the seductive influences with
which they are surrounded. The more * respectable', the “hall' the more promi-
nent is this feature. These saloons are filled by “men about town' of all ages and
conditions, with and without characters; there may be seen the young and inex-
perienced clerk and the heartless skittle sharp and blackleg, the patrician roué and
the plebeian ‘fancy man; "... . . This mixed crowd of folly and vice keep up a con-
tinued chattering composed of obscene jests and vulgar repartees, to the great annoy-
ance of the decent tradesman or working man, who, accompanied by his wife or
sweetheart, may have visited the “Hall' in the delusive hope of hearing some good
singing, but whose ears are thus polluted with vulgarity and slang. It is this sort of
thing that has driven, and is ... the respectable portion of society from
these “Halls,' and it is to provide attraction for the more “spicy” patrons that
' comic ladies' and other “sensation performances', have been introduced. . . In
these saloons the scenes that used to be enacted in the lobbies and saloons of the
theatres are reproduced even in a worse and more offensive form."
Now, if a tithe of this be true (and, so far as I have seen, there has
been no denial of it) I think the less you go to Music Halls the better
it will be for you, and the better will it be too, for your wife—when you
are blest with one. Mind, l don't say stick at home too much in solitude
and smoke, and mope yourself to death while JESSIE is away from you.
But I do say, when you take your pleasure out, go, take it as an honest
gentleman, and never enter places where you would (at least I hope so)
blush to have her see you. At your age men can blush, and the power
is so enviable, that you should take care of it. Music Hall society is
fatally destructive to it, for there are few worse snares to youth than
the vice that tempts a man by aped and acted modesty.
So when you want to hear a song, or have a social smoke (both good
things in their way, if that be not a bad one), I say go to Qovent
Garden and inquire your way to Evans's, if you are still so verdant as
never to have heard the name of PADDY GREEN. There is entertain.

CONSCIENCE AT THE COUNTER.
By some mistake the following appeared the other morning in the
#, Telegraph. It seems obviously intended to have been sent to
watch :-
( ROCERY. —WANTED, a Conscientious, Energetic young man
" (member of a school preferred), also not particular what he does, for a
COUNTRY GENERAL SHOP. Unless good tempered, active, and obliging, need
not address, wages not high. Apply, &c.
Out of our own columns, it is not often that we come across so good
a joke as this. Activity and energy we can understand to be required
in a ſº man assisting at a grocer's; but the idea of wanting con-
science in him seems to us most ludicrous. When one knows how prone
are grocers to sell their sand as sugar, mix with lard their butter, and
manufacture sloe-leaves into fine pure Pekoe-flavoured family black
tea, one surely, never would have dreamt that, conscience would be
asked for in a shopman, who, it is expressly said, is “not to be par-

The Council of the Society of Arts have sent Mr. Punch a set of
questions upon the subject of awards for merit.
write can answer a letter, says MR.

Any man who can
W. SHAKSPEARE, and Mr. Punch's
being indisputable, he can hardly escape from replying to the
ut, he is by no means certain that his responses
give
unlimited satisfaction to the querists:—
Questions.
1. Are you of opinion that
awards for merit, by medals or
otherwise, in International exhi-
bitions, are desirable?
2. State the reason for your
Oplmlon.
3. Ought works of fine art and
designs to be excluded from the
awards?
4. Can you suggest any better
method than, the appointment of
jurors for making the awards?
5. Can you, suggest any im-
provement in the constitution or
proceedings of the jº.
.6. Is any appeal from the de-
cision of juries desirable?
.7: If you think awards unde-
sirable, can you, suggest any other
means by which meritorious pro-
ductions may be brought to the
notice of the public?
ave you any further sug-
Answers.
1. No, Council.
2. Because, Council, they are
always given to the wrong people.
3. Yes, Council, because a party
capable of such works wouldn't
thank stupid judges for twopenny
medals. -
4. Anybody is better, Council,
º a juror, as juries go in these
ays. - -
5. Yes, Council, kick them into
the street.
6. Yes, Council, to Mr. Punch
and common sense.
7. Yes, Council, let the best
specimens presented to Mr.
unch.
8. Yes, Council, that you abstain
gestion to offer on the subject? from meddling in the matter.
If the above replies, given with Mr. Punch's usual ready º:
prove of the least use to the Council, he is satisfied. He has certainly
embodied the popular opinion upon the subject. To judge by the
incessant and angry protests against everything that has been done,
it would seem that the public have a fine classical sense of the deriva-
§. of le word Jury, and regard it as meaning a Party to be
Worm at.
IT IS NEWER TOO LATE TO AMEND.
DURING the last sitting of Parliament occurred the following pluie de
perles in the way of amendments:--
“On the order of the day for considering the Lords' amendments to Commons'
amendments to Lords' amendments in the Juries Bill,
“MR. CRAUFURD moved that the House do disagree with that amendment, &c."
With the above embarras de richesses, it must have been rather
puzzling to know what was the first clause that was originally amended.
The Bill that required the help of so many “amendments” to knock
it into something like acceptable shape, must have presentcd, when
finished, a rare piece of legislative cobbling. When Pope exclaimed
“The Lord mend me!” an old woman is reported to have said, “ Mend
you! It would take much less time to make a new man altogether;”
and so we should have been inclined to say of the above measure.
Surely, it would have been a quicker operation, instead of patching and
tinkering up the old Bill, to have drawn out a fresh one at once? How-
ever, if our Houses of Parliament are not better institutions than they
are, one cannot say that it is from the want of sufficient “amendments.”
NEW AMERICAN DISCOVERY.
-- #. ** says in his long letter (to which LoRD John answered
umph”), “After all, the Insurgents are Men."
This is a discovery which the Federal minister deserves great credit
for making. Its accuracy was confirmed a little later by observations
taken by GENERAL M'CIELLAN in the course of a week's rather rapid
journey across a certain peninsula. Perhaps continued study on the
subject may induce MR. SEwARp to believe that the insurgents are not
only Men but Brothers, and then a fratricidal war may come to a
termination. What a thing it is to be able to think!
“They are Coming, and they are Three.”
“TheRE are three Men in Europe,” said NAP to CAvour,
As they smoked their cigars after lunch:
The Count has left Euro the mot may endure,
For NAPOLEON asserts that he meant—the deep cure—
Himself, Wiscount JAUNTY, and PUNch.

ROMAN PASTORAL POETRY.
IGH ecclesiastics, some
of them, are not im-
properly called old
women, but there is
strong reason for re-
garding the ARCHBI-
shop of NîMEs as a
loung lady. That pre-
ate has addressed to
his flock, which should
consist of geese, a pas-
toral couched in the
usual flowery language
of Ultramontane hum-
bug; a pastoral which
no pastor, one would
thin could have com-
posed but a CoRYDoN.
It contains the follow-
ing description of the
Pope's personal attrac-
tions:—
“That limpidloving look,
that enchanting smile
which beams eternally,
whilst from his lips fall dis-
tilled honey, words which
scatter the perfume of his
heart.”
This cannot be the language of a man writing about another man. It can only be
that of an enthusiastic girl describing another girl. The Pope is a very charming
person by that account. What else could you expect from such a pretty Pope than
distilled honey and odoriferous language?—though to heretical noses the perfume
of his heart would, if perceptible, be not very agreeable: for heretics hold the only
heart that smells nice to be a calf's heart stuffed. Well; why, perhaps one would
he inclined to suppose that so beautiful a Pontiff would, as the ARchbishop or
NiMEs informs us that PIUs does, rather frequently give vent to “tears, sighs,
burning expressions of tenderness.” Such a gushing Pope as this never before
existed, unless we are to believe in the pontificate of Pope JoAN. A Pope with a
“limpid loving look,” and an “enchanting smile,” lips which shed “distilled honey,”
and feelings that find expression in “tears, sighs, burning expressions of tender-
ness,” is surely a Pope affected with hysteria, a Pope under whose nose it is often
necessary to burn feathers, a Pope who is obliged to take much sal volatile, a
Pope well qualified to bear the name of JoAN, or JULIA. Petticoats and white
satin shoes are apparel suitable to the sex of a Pope of that description; who might
sit in the Chair of Peter for Wenus attired by the Graces, inclusive of her GRACE
THE ARchbishop of NiMEs. .
The liberal world would rejoice if effect could be given to the aspiration thus
expressed by this epicene if not feminine prelate, with a characteristic interjec-
tion :-
“Ah! it makes us wish to melt away and become nothing for the honour and grandeur of
our beloved Pontiff."
The gratification of this wish would leave the EMPEROR OF THE FRENch, unim-
peded by seditious churchmen, at liberty to deal with the Pope, alone; would be
quickly followed by the emancipation of Italy and the pacific settlement of Europe.
That desirable consummation would doubtless ensue iP the ARchbishop of NiMes
I
and all the Papist clergy were to melt, thaw, and resolve
themselves i. a dew, or evaporate and, as the Yankees
say, leave nothing of themselves but a little grease spot.
“ROME OR DEATH !”
IF GARIBALDI fail, .
So Chiefs have failed before; -
Not always doth the Right prevail,
And what can we say more ?
Forsooth that he was rash,
By generous madness led
Against the might of France to dash
His blind heroic head.
The fight has oft been fought,
And yet the battle won;
When all onlookers justly thought
That hopeless risk was run:
The odds of high emprise
Not on the surface show, -
Lie somewhat deeper than the wise
Can always see, below.
There are the Priests, whose ban
To shake NAPOLEON's throne
Might happen, should December's Man
Yield Italy her own ;
And those imperial bands,
That work his will, are strong
And prompt to do what France demands,
Her bidding, right or wrong.
Hearts, on the other side,
And souls there are, to fire, .
With zeal above vainglorious pride,
With courage to inspire
Nerving each true man's hand
To fight for hearth and home,
To dare the worst for Fatherland,
And set his life on Rome.
This spirit set on blaze
Will burn how far, how hot? .
And then how much against it weighs
The force of Frenchmen's shot?
Learn that, ere you decide
The good cause has no chance,
Yet has that issue to be tried
Of Italy with France.
Spread but the sacred flame
And France will not withhold -
From strong Italian hands, the claim
Of hearts resolved and bold,
Enkindled, one and all,
With Freedom's fiery breath,
Incensed by GARIBALDI’s call
His cry of “Rome or Death!”
SATISFIED SPECTATORS.
They have got it at last. They, the gaping numskulls, who, for
more than twelvemonths, have been thronging to stare at performances
of which the special attraction was the .

“Last night an event took place at Highbury Barn Gardens, which not only pro-
duced the greatest consternation among the visitors, but has resulted in the most
serious if not fatal consequences to Miss SELINA YouNG, or, as she is styled, the
“Female Blondin,” the celebrated rope-walker, who created such a sensation at
Cremorne Gardens last season by crossing the Thames on a tight-rope.”
Attired in a “suit of armour,” having wheeled a barrow in the midst
of blue lights and fire-works, on a rope at the height of 100 feet, Miss
YouNg consummated the amusement which she had been affording her
spectators, as follows:—
“A third time she crossed the rope, covered with a sack, and then commenced
her final tour to the starting point, in the midst of fireworks discharged from each
end of the balancing pole she carried in her hand. She had arrived within about
twenty feet of the western stage, when the catherine wheels at each end of the
pole had reached their greatest velocity, at which moment reports were heard, and
stars of various hues were emitted. At this instant it was plainly observable that
there was a fearful oscillation of the pole, as well as of the unfortunate performer. A
general cry was raised that she was falling. The pole fell from her grasp, and the
performer toppled over. For a moment she appeared to cling to the rope, either by
the legs or bands; but, whether from fright or otherwise, in another second she
was seen descending head foremost into the midst of the lofty trees beneath her.”
The rest is—Surgery ! -
LéotARD, who was also engaged in astonishing weak minds at the
Highbury Barn Garden by hazarding his neck, nearly broke it in his
trºpidation, by trying, to jump, after he had been, “indiscreetly
informed” of what j ha ºf to the “Female Blondin.” Another
“trapëze” accident had §. an unlucky mountebank the week
before. The accident at Highbury Barn would have been prevented
if any warning could have operated to its prevention. But there
is only one warning which could produce that effect; that is to say if
it could possibly happen. Sensation rope-walking could only be stopped
by a martyrdom—the most awful of examples. The spectacle of a
dance on the tight-rope at the elevation of a cathedral spire, termi-
nating in the precipitation of the funambulist to the ground, would have
to be exhibited by a Bishop !

A SHAKER OF THE INFALLIBILE CHURCH.
BEFORE the popular mind had abandoned itself to negro melodies,
there was a comic song of the “Billy Barlow,” or "Raggedy oh!.
species which stood in high ſavour under the title of “Shivery Shakery.”
A letter lately in the Bristol Times contained a statement suggestive of
the idea that a modification of the canticle of that name might be sung
with the most happy effect by an eminent divine, a convert to popery
who has recently declared that “Protestantism is the dreariest of all
religions; the thought of the Anglican service makes him shiver, and
the thought of the Thirty-Nine icles makes him shudder.” Our
Bristol contemporary's correspondent thus writes:–
“It may be profitable to review the history of the person who has given vent to
his animosity against our Church, in terms not unworthy of the most furious of the
Liberation spouters. NEwMAN, it is well known, was originally a Dissenter. Not
being satisfied with his position as a Nonconformist, he became ambitious to occupy
higher ground. Having taken his degree at Oxford, he was ordained; and he began
his career as "an evangelical." The principles of the opposite party, in all proba-
bility, made him “shiver and shudder.” In a few years, however, we find him
hoisting his high-church flag as a Tractarian. While thus engaged, he was seized
with a fit of trepidation at the doctrines of ‘the evangelicals;” for he abused them
ood set terms. He professed also to hold in abhorrence the errors of Romanism,
compared the Pope's church to a demoniac, possessed and governed by the
Prince of Darkness. Shivering and shuddering, he warned us to avoid her as a pes-
tilential synagogue, which had established a lie in the place of God's truth. He
pronounced her to be crafty, obstinate, wilful, malicious, cruel, and unnatural, as
madmen are. He declared that in the corrupt Papal system we have the very
cruelty, the craft, and the ambition of the old Republic. One might suppose that
as a matter of course he would have shºuldered at its crimes."
in
The autobiography of the reverend D. D., sung in his ecclesiastical
costume, with the burden, introduced at due intervals, of “Shivery
Shuddery,” would be highly amusing, and could possibly do no harm
by perverting any simpleton, however weak, who is acquainted with
the subjoined statement of the writer above quoted respecting that
shaky captive of the papal Fisherman, and theologically loose fish:—
“ARchbishop WHATELY, who was his contemporary at Oxford, assures us that
“by the confession of his friends in The English Churchman (Oct. 16, 1845), MR.
NEwMAN had been for four years at least, a member of the Roman communion,
before he openly avowed his conversion; during which four years he suffered him-
self to be looked up and appealed to, as the head of a party who styled themselves
the only true sons of the Church of England ' ' . His various pranks at Oxford are
recorded at full length by the Archbishop in his Cautions for the Times, xiii. Did
the Reverend Doctor ever shiver or shudder at his own duplicity and hypocrisy
during the period here referred to, and while he was comfortably pocketing the
revenues of the English Church 2 If he did not, then I shall be loath to believe that
the Thirty-nine Articles can possibly give a man of his brazen constitution a fit of
the ague. Of one thing we may be quite sure; his capacity for straining at a gnat,
and swallowing whole camels, is unrivalled.”
A polemic who is known to shiver and shudder so violently without
capse, and not to tremble at all when he should, is unlikely to shake the
făith of the most foolish fellow who is not also crazy. The most absurd
of Ranters or Jumping Methodists may henceforth expect to catch as
many flats as are likely to be hooked by our great Romanist Shaker.
SPIRIT OF BLACK DIAMONDS.
A Bottle of brandy and a bottle of smoke are generally considered
to be very different things; yet it appears that they contain certain
elements in common. A young French chemist, named CoTELLE, of St.
Quentin, has discovered a method of extracting alcohol from coal gas;
which, an Irish contemporary will perhaps observe, is an odd way of
getting spirits of wine. CotelLE says that he can sell the spirit thus
produced thrice as cheap as the cheapest at present made, at which rate
gin, that vulgar liquor, will become still more low. The extreme
cheapness of coal-spirit will render it a profitable export for consump-
tion by the Red Indians, who will, with especial propriety, denominate
the intoxicating fluid derived from coals fire-water.
Bringing 'em Up with a Round Turn.
A DEPUTATION from º recently waited upon Lord PALMER-
STON to represent to him that navigators to and from that port required
an increase of basin accommodation. PAM replied that he held many
offices, but that he was not yet a steward of a steampacket. The
deputation retired, and are at present engaged, with their coats off that
they ºw think the harder, trying to find out what His Jauntiness
meant.

A Real Blockade.—That which is keeping
patriots in America.
A Paper Blockade.—That which is kceping
NEWS AT LAST FROM AMERICA.
FROM a recent number of the New York Herald, we take the fºllowing
astounding piece of intelligence:—
“They (the American people) know that when this rebellion began the aristocrats
of England took advantage of the chance to destroy us, and joined heart and hand
with the slaveholding rebels. They know that this rebellion was born in Exeter
Hall, nurtured }. the English aristocracy, armed from English arsenals, and sup-
ported by English sympatly and assistance.”
. This is the first genuine bit of news we have received from America
since the war broke out. It is all news, for we must confess that every
item it alludes to is to us completely new—so much so, that if it had
not been for the kindness of the New York Herald, we probably never
should have heard a word about it. For the future, we shall rely on
American papers only for our supply of English intelligence. They con-
tain a great deal more than our stupid hum-drum home-grown journals,
that slavishly restrict themselves to the truth. How true it is that one
must go abroad to learn the news ... We wish that our Scotch-American
friend, the Herald, had carried its kindness a little further. We should
like, to have been furnished with the names of these same “aristocrats
of England,” who are so anxious to “destroy” the Northerners, and it
would also have pleased us to have been told who are the same “rebels.”
that they are accused of being joined “heart, and hand” with; for it
strikes us that their hands and hearts, to be able to stretch so far, must
have properties of expansion not less elastic than the principles of truth
such as are generally observed in an American newspaper-office, like the
one we have gratefully quoted from above. Other interesting particu-
lars are similarly wanting, the absence of which leaves the information
sadly incomplete. Why not have let us into the secret as to who were
the nurses and anxious parents who assisted at Exeter Hall at the birth
of the above-mentioned “rebellion?”. Exeter Hall has many wicked,
reprehensible things to answer for, but we little suspected that anything
could be laid at its doors that was half so monstrous as the civil war
that is at present casting a blot on America almost as black as that of
slavery itself! Then, who are the members of “the English aristocracy,”
we are anxious to learn, who so fondly nurtured this rebellion? Out of
justice to the House of Lords, their names should not be kept unre-
vealed, any, more than, “the English arsenals,” which supplied the
arms, should be shielded from public obloquy. The information might
be Fº conveyed through the medium of a Who killed Cock Robin f
ballad, and such a poetic form would admit of the additional richness of
illustration. ... In some future edition, we hope that MR. GoRD9N
BENNETT will fill up these disa .# lacunes, and we will promise
him that they will produce in England an effect fully equal to that of
any sensation paragraph that was, ever spiced up at New York to
meet a depraved appetite in his highly-seasoned columns.
We trust these omissions will shortly be supplied, as we should be
sorry to look upon the above startling information as having no more
value or reliability attached to it than if it were a common Government
despatch, or a war bulletin, or “ANOTHER Glorious. Victory” con-
cocted in some back-office in the Broadway. In addition to the other
calamities inflicted on the country by the war, we hope that the sound
of the cannon has not startled the Truth out of America. The next
mail will bring us comforting assurance that she is still tarrying yet
awhile in the Editor's room of the New York Herald.
SOME GOOD ACTING.
A Good Man .# with difficulties is said by the ancients to be a
sight the gods loved. It served such ill-natured deities right to be
abolished. But what shall be said of the sight of a good Woman in such
a condition? Not only the gods of our time, but the pit and boxes also
revel in the spectacle. Mr. Punch owns to having enjoyed it also, an
mentions the St. James's Theatre as the locale, and MRs. FRANK
Matthews as the Woman. Go and see her. She has been fitted, and
very dexterously, from a French store-house, with a P. in which a
woman's gallant struggle against a wife's sacred duty of submission, is
so set out, that, although #. accident which gives the rebellious ſemale
a temporary triumph brings disaster to her innocent lord, you cannot
grudge her the victorious innings for which she has worked so well, and
you are with her, even in the moment when the truth, comes out and
she is repentant—or as repentant as a defeated and therefore injured
woman can be. The contest for mastery is well waged, and the majestic
and elaborate eloquence of her spouse, if it does not silence her, at least
keeps her in check—but in an evil moment he becomes love's ambassador
for a peccant friend—and the battle is given to the hands of his wife,
It is worth going to the play for the sake of hearing one speech of
intensely condensed vindictiveness. “That you were a Brute, MR.
KERR MUDGEoN, I have long known...That your personal appearance
is the reverse of attractive is beyond dispute. But I did—yes--I did
believe that you had Morals.” }. Punch has not the faintest hesitation
in penning a paragraph which is not only a Puff, but meant to be, and
designed to send people to see Bristol Diamonds, and with the same
minking courage is begs to return thanks to Mrs. FRANK, and to
her brave É. ortunate husband, for some of the best comic acting
he has seen for many a night. He has praised Endymion before, but a
silvery vision of Diana, or Miss HERBERT, or both, has been gliding
through his dreams, and rendering them extra-beatific.

A very pleasant incident, and we are happy to have inspected it. The writer's
hope is gratified, and as he is in our debt, Pºlº he will allow us to request a
gratification in return, namely, a cessation of his valuable correspondence.
Qur next correspondent is good enough to supply us with a hint for an engraving,
which he considers “may tend to put down that which endangers the lives and
persons of the community.” Mr. Punch would be more than happy to supply the
picture, but the fact is that all his artistic young men are out of town, and he
IS unwilling to lose a moment in producing a remedy for a crying evil:—
“My suggestion is JoHN BULL in fear of the Garotter.—A conveyance drawn by a

would please the public, at the same time caution them."
Punch has made his apology for the absence of the assistance of one of his cele-
ir, marked
brated artists, and feels that the idea of his correspondent
is so vigorous that it needs no pictorial illustration. He

wady Reading Room and Library, when MR. KERHUsroo NowRojee
will read his paper in Guzeratee, on ‘Man and Woman compared."
The attendance of the public is requested.”
Our correspondent wants to know the meaning of the
above. We have sent a copy to SIR CHARLEs Wood, with
orders to explain in a private letter: if he does not, or if,
as is more probable, his explanation is ten times more
puzzling than the text, he will hear from us in a way he

Seventeen correspondents to-day, twenty yesterday, and
about a hundred previously, have sent us an advertise-
ment in which—here it is:—
ATRIMONY.—A Lady of Rank, having, under peculiar
circumstances, been asked by the friends of a handsome
fashionable, and amiable young gentleman of distinction to effect a
marriage, will be glad to hear, confidentially, from a lady of fortune
wishing a really good and happy position.—Lady X. X., Posto
Restante, &c.
Mr. Punch himself, or rather Mrs. Punch, inserted the
advertisement, wishing to marry off and settle one of their
young men who was getting a little too fond of his club, and
our friend PADDY GREEN. The result has been most for.
tunate, a very beautiful girl was selected by Mr. Punch, out
of a garland of twenty-seven who answered the invitation,
and the marriage was solemnised straight off and will
be found announced in the Times of Saturday last. He is
sorry to have given his correspondents so much trouble, but
has charged himself with the interests of the other twenty-
six young ladies, and is open to receive proposals for their
hands—they all have money, and eleven of them have brown
hair-correspondents will specify the colour they admire.
Mr. Punch at the same time inserted the following adver:
tisement, which has also been sent to him by scores of
astounded friends:—
A LADY of High Birth and Title, will AFFORD any Lad
of adequate fortune, desirous to become settled in a good posi-
tion in society, the BENEFIT of peculiarly advantageous INTRO-
|-DUCTIONS to exclusive circles.—Name and particu (in confi-
dence) indispensable. Lady W., &c. .
Mr. Punch is restrained by peculiar considerations from
stating as yet the result of this announcement, but “Lady
W.” (Mrs. Punch) has had numerous applications in reply,
and has had to decline several propositions on the part of

"
ladies of neglected education, and may say here, once for all, that aitches
are indispensable.
Here is one which he did not put in:—
APARTMENT. with a pension for attendance required; nearly rent
free; coals, candles, and washing (put out) free; forming a very cheerful and
comfortable home. A retired old gentleman, who has never been an invalid, offers
FIVE good-sized ROOMS, furnished or unfurnished, in a nearly new house, at 7s, a
week, to avoid the trouble he has had with servants. For the greater chance of a
permanent arrangement, he would prefer a lady past middle age, with a º
well-bred children, who can give him good attendance, and very good plain cooking.
A small present will be made every week to each person employed, according to
merit, terminating in a single pension at the end of two years. No other ºis:
taken. Apply by letter only, describing family, to A. B., &c., Islington.
“Dear Punch,-You who know everything, do oblige me by unravelling this
tangled skein, which is given up by Mamma and myself as unfathomable. Make it
clear, there's a dear creature, to SARAH ANN.”
Mind your metaphors, SARAH ANN-skeins are not unfathomable.
We have a notion that this retired old gentleman will be found to be a
Cannibal. Who in his senses invites a family of children unless he
means to eat them. Well-bred children, too. Just as he would stipu-
late for dairy-fed pork. Decidedly A. B. is a Cannibal, and it is clear
also that an old gentleman who has never been ill must be a savage, no
man in civilised life lives to old age without occasional illness. “Ter:
yminating in a single pension at the end of two years.”. Just so, he will
have eaten them all except one by that time, as the Cyclops promised
to serve Ulysses—
“When all thy wretched crew have felt my power,
Outis shall be the last I will devour.”
The Islington Cannibal! Don't you go to his house, SARAH ANN,
let your Mamma go, as she is probably a lady past middle age, and not
good eating. We are glad to have saved you from being devoured
and in the satisfaction of having done a good action, and knocked
together an article, Mr. Punch will now go and throw a few more
harmless stones into a smiling sea.
Stop! he has one other stone to throw, not into the sea, People who
send him valuable contributions like the above have a habit of asking
him to return, them if he does not want, them. He has repeatedly
said that he will do nothing of the kind, and begs once more to º:
the Public that what he does not print goes to the Butterman of the
hour. To how many more bothering idiots must he tell this. Their only
chance for recovering their rubbish is in a stamped, and directed
envelope, so that he can return the enclosure without looking at it.
TWO PRIEST.S.
THE longer Mr. Punch lives the more frantic becomes his admiration
for the Romish Priest. He considers that individual, whether he be
the Pope cursing from the chair of the heathen deity, or the Irish
peasant bellowing anathemas over his whiskey toddy, to be one of the
most remarkable creations ever sent on earth for the improvement and
edification of mankind. This week, Mr. Punch has the felicity of con-
templating the Priest in his most exalted and most debased position.
Curiously, in both cases, he appears as a fierce enemy of the present
Government. - -
..MR. MAGUIRE has been making a speech at Skibbereen, at a dinner
given to a Roman Catholic bishop, and the honourable gentleman said—
“The Pope himself declared to me that the PALMERston Government is the worst
enemy of the Church of God upon the face of the earth.”
This is a dreadful statement from the |. of Infallibility. The only
comfort is, that His Holiness has said the same thing of so many
ople... Any soyereign or subject who happens for the moment to put
yspeptic Infallibility into one of those “rages” of which the Romans
make such unbecoming fun, is immediately declared to be the worst
enemy of the Church. WICTOR-EMMANUEL has long been given over to
Diabolus, GARIBALDI, of course, has not a chance hereafter, and it was
only the other day that the Eldest Son of the Church, Louis NAPOLEON
himself, protector of Rome, was indirectly informed by the Pope that
his Majesty was “in league with the Devil.” Lord PALMERston
comes in only for the tail of the storm. But let us be more charitable
than our friend the Pope appears to have been, and suppose, not a cleri-
cal error–that would be rude, but a ty #. one. Suppose that a
mistake has substituted the most sacred of names for the name “Rome.”
We know that whether the Pope said this or not, it was what he meant.
In that case, LoRD PALMERstoN ought immediately to write a hand-
some letter to MR. MAGUIRE, with the PREMIER’s best thanks for pub-
lishing so valuable a certificate of his character, and giving him a new
and indisputable claim to the regard of all honest and religious persons.
While PAM is considering his course, let us see the Priest in another
light. The amiable feelings of the Irish Catholics towards the son of the
man who gave them emancipation are pretty well known. But a little
illustration of those, feelings may be acceptable to the collectors of
curiosities. Some folks pin scorpions and other vermin into paper boxes,
some preserve specimens of Irish priestcraft. Here is one of the latter.
Qne JoHN CoGHLAN, a so-called Archdeacon of Achonry, writes to a
Dublin paper:—
“It is reported that SIR Robert PEEL is to come to shoot here this season.
Wºwhat a howl of execration will the fellow be met, if the people can recognise
The “fellow’’ condescended to inquire whether this letter were reall
the production of the person whose signature was appended to it, an
the answer is, an admission of the letter, and abuse of SIR. RoBERT for
“morbid sensitiveness with reference to expressions of grief and indig-
nation wrung from a clergyman.” The priest, however, hastens to
repudiate a construction which a Dublin paper has, he says, put upon
the passage about shooting, as he did not mean a suggestion that SIR
RoBERT “should be shot at.” We might hesitate to accept the
riest's own denial, inasmuch as it might be the result of well-grounded
right; but to do him justice, we do not believe that he meant to
recommend one of those murders, to the “causes” of which the Irish
Catholic bishops have lately announced that they are not blind. We
think that he only meant a clumsy taunt in connection with SIR
RoBERT's º imputed indifference to the sacrifice of human life.
But the priest pleads § to the charge of writing what is an incite-
ment to an ignorant rabble to raise “a howl of execration” against an
unoffending gentleman. ...And we know what an Irish howl of execra-
tion means. It was raised the other day against some young Pro-
testant ladies in Ireland as they came home from bathing, and they
scarcely escaped with life. CoGHLAN is not worth prosecuting, or the
Castle could pin him against the wall of a gaol as easily as Mr. Punch
g. him here, but it is better to let such creatures alone. But should
IR ROBERT choose to shoot in Skibbereen, and should he be mal-
treated, we should think, that ARCHDEACON Coghlan would require
legal assistance, and we should suggest that its efficacy be tested before
an English jury. -
ope or priest, the minister of Rome is, as Mr. Punch has remarked,
an extraordinary being, and, our frantic admiration for him needs no
more justification than is to be found in the above paragraphs.
SENSATION PARAGRAPHS.
The roar of the Lion in the forest
in the dead stillness of the night
inspires terror—the lightning,
that strikes the mast, in a storm
at sea, produces feelings of the
liveliest alarm—the explosion of
a bombshell, scattering destruc-
tion around,will make thestoutest
heart quake, with fear—but i.it
haps no sight in the world is
so terrible as that of a hungry
man who has been kept waiting
more than five minutes for his
dinner
The Maelström may be fa-
thomcd, – Big Ben even may
ultimately be sounded—but
Woman's heart never !
It requires courage to lead a
ſorlorn hope—no little firmness
is requisite to break, some fatal
= news to a suffering friend—and a
deal of moral heroism is wanted to
forgive an injury in one who has
*A, been dearly loved—but what are
these compared to the superhuman effort that is needed at some fancied
sound of alarm, to descend alone at three o'clock in the morning into a
kitchen that we know to be swarming with blackbeetles?
Some like Sparkling champagne best, whilst others give the preference
to Still ; but *. ohl twice happy, is he whose conscience combines
both qualities—one that is, at the same time, both sparkling and still !
A Good Confederate Cry.
According to the Correspondent of the New York World in Virginia,
“GENERAL Pope's order for the army to subsist on the country, has
caused indiscriminate plundering all through the Virginian valley.” The
Yankee Pope is worse than the Roman Pontiff. His Holiness does not
at any rate openly and avowedly wage war by means of an army of
brigands. Atrocities such as those trated by GENERAL Pope's
marauders cannot but provoke a cry of “No Popery !”
a WARM IMAGINATION.
“VERY hot in the Exhibition to-day?” said one friend, to another
over his International dinner. “Wery 1” replied the latter, “the Nave f
declare, reminded me of Central Africa—the heat was quite Trophycaſ.”

And “Death!” is the reply of France.
Yes, death, my friends, for #. strong;
France is resolved to have her way;
Her will is law which, right or wrong,

Your claim of Rome I must refuse,
For I don't want you to become
Too independent, and I choose
To keep you underneath my thumb.

If you desire to bite the dust,

AcTUALLY, the Eastern Counties Railway is no more! Don't be

last Session, that Railway is in future to be known as the Great
Eastern. Don't frighten your wife, ToMKINs, by saying that whereas
you thought of taking her to Lowestoft, you now intend to treat her to
a trip by the Great #: She might not like the notion of going to
New York just now, with the chance perhaps of seeing you a conscript
for M'CLELLAN. So, when you speak of the Great Eastern, mind you
mention the word Railway; and meanwhile join with, Mr. Punch in
hoping that the name of the Great Eastern will stand higher in the
j world than that which it succeeds; and, as one way of insuring
this, let us hope that express trains will not be bound to stop five times
in forty miles, as, Mr. Punch has heard, they used to do upon the
Eastern Counties.

DISCOVERIES IN LONDON.
“My DEAR PUNCH, “Lisbon Hotel, Fleet Street.
“I SEE in the newspapers all sorts of letters from fellows who
think it will interest the world to know that they have been bitten by
fleas in Switzerland, have tumbled off mules, in the Pyrenees, and have
been without clean shirts in Paris because their luggage has been sent
on to Marseilles. I suppose they sincerely imagine that what is, so
uncommonly interesting to themselves must dilight everybody else, but
I never did write in that fashion, although I have been to a good many
places, the Himalayas, Constantinople, Pernambuco, and California
among them. But when a fellow has made a real discovery of unknown
parts, I think he may be allowed to write about it without seeming a
Negºtistical Hºss. -
“Of course I was in Scotland last week shooting. Then comes a tele.
am calling me up to London—then comes the limited mail, and here
am. I mustmention is because it would create a natural prejudice
against my character as a gentleman, at the outset of my letter, if I
represented myself in town now without some extraordinarily good
reason, Fact is, that an aunt, from whom I have great expecta-
tions, had chosen to come up and see the Show, of which she had spoken
and written with the most serene contempt during the decent months.
It was the thing for one to come up, old man, and the grouse may go
to the deuce. If all goes well I may have moors of my own some day,
but not if I neglect Aunt GRAZINGSTOck. -
“Well, duty is duty, and noways pleasure, and I didn't expect much
gratification from showing Aunt GRAziNGstock the Koh-i-Noor and
Armstrong's guns. But I thought I might manage somehow, and she
goes to bed about the time one goes to dinner.
“But, my dear old man, when I called on Aunt GRAZINGSTOCK at
this hotel (which I never heard of before, but it seems her mother used
to go to it, I suppose in the time of QUEEN ANNE–you'll laugh, but
it’s near your own office), I found that she had ºf up a young lady
with her. Pretty girl, uncommon intelligent, and knows a precious
deal more of many ãº than yours truly does. I ought to add that
she turned out to be a cousin of mine, whom aunt has adopted, and
means to do the handsome by. Her name’s GRAZINGSTOCK too, 'Miss
HESTER GRAZINGSTOCK, if you please.
“Well, her face put a new face on matters, rather, for I am not
ashamed to say that I like the society of a pretty girl who can talk,
and her being a cousin of course relieved me (as...I '...} from
lºnal danger. So at it we went, sight-seeing like anything you
ve
“The Show was soon done with. I fancy they were rather disap-
Fº with most things except the pictures. But Miss GRAZINGSTOCK
ad never, been in London before, and I was ordered to do London
sights with her. Aunt chose generally to stick at the hotel window
and see the cab-horses tumble down, and then open the window an
scold right out at the people for not helping the poor beasts up again;
so my cousin and I saw the sights by ourselves. Now I had no more
notion what to show the girl than if I had been taking her through the
moon, but I had a conſidential chat with a waiter down-stairs who had
been showing London to his little boy, and he put me up to a good
many things.
“My dear old man, there is a deal to see in London. I have heard
the names of some of the places, but of course I never went near 'em,
and thought that they were something the lower orders did, like Green-
wich fair, where I have been, and ridden in a roundabout with Members
of Parliament. But I assure you, and I have seen all the capitals, that
there is a wonderful deal to look at in London. Do you know that the
inside of St. Paul's is worth seeing—some rummy statues no doubt,
but a grand effect, and the view from the top is immense. Did you
ever go to the Tower? ... You must have seen it on the left as you have
gone down to your whitebait. I swear to you it’s a most historica
place, full of real curiosities, and something interesting at every turn. I
thought I should never get HESTER out of that dungeon; and she was
so awfully well up in QUEEN ElizaBETH, and all that sort of thing,
that the show-ſellow was quite deli ſited, and asked her to take his
place; and didn't she look pretty when the colour came up—what's
that to you, old man? But did you ever go over Westminster Abbey?
Well, now, you can easily get there—take a boat from near your place,
and tell them to put you out at Westminster Bridge. You’ve no idea
what a fine church it is ; talk of Notre Dame, and St. Stephen, and St.
Sophia—it’s worth all three; and there are tombs of all the chaps you
read about, and poets, and no end of talent. Well, my boy, there are a
lot more things. I dare say you never heard of a place called Guildhall.
It’s in the City. I forget the street, but the cabmen know. Go and see
that. There are two of the most outrageous Guys you ever saw, called
Gog and Magog, and there is a lot of antiquarian things that, if they were
in a private house, and only to be seen by interest, everybody would be
after. But there’s another place that we found out. It is in a beestly
part of the town, I allow, near Tottenham Court Road; but, when you
f into the building, you forget all that, and you can go in a close cab.
t is called the British Museum. My old man, there's no such a col-
lection of everything in the world, from a silver penny to asarcophagus,
in any part of Europe. Wonderful old writings, autographs, statues,
coins, medals. I can't tell you what a show there is. ere you ever
taken over the Bank? I declare I wouldn't have missed that sight
for ninepence. There’s a thing that weighs sovereigns, and spits out
the light ones, and then a thing that cuts them . a split shot—
it does everything but speak; if they'd take it to Piccadilly, and charge
a bob for showing it, they’d be able to pay the national debt in a year.
Then we were told to go over London Bridge, and see a marvellous old
church in Southwark. I only know I’ve driven miles in foreign parts to
see something not a quarter so fine, and yet I never knew of this—it is in
a hole on your right as you go to the Brighton railway. HESTER knew
all about it, and the Lady Chapel. Go and see it, old man. Well, I am
scribbling at their table while they are dressing for dinner, and here
comes the soup, so I must conclude, but I think I have justified my
writing to you, and do §'. know that I have a good mind to write a
book about London, and take credit for having invented it. HESTER
says I may have her share of the honour, and she will look up all the
facts and copy them out for me. What do you think, old man?
“Agréez, &c.,
“PEREGRINE FALCON.”
“P.S. HESTER says I might as well º her. I don’t know what to
say. To be sure we might write delightful travel books together, like
MR. and MRs. CARTER HALL. If she would be as jolly afterwards as
she is now, I wouldn't much mind. But I hear club fellows say that wives
grow so awful cold and sulky. What do you think, old man? To-night
we’re going to the Wax-works. Fancy the Honourable P. FALCON at
gas-lighted wax-works. , But HESTER says she wants to be able to say
she has seen them, and people in the country think a deal of 'em,
HESTER says.” -
CRINOLINE KITES.
THE attention of our junior male readers is called to the annexed
paragraph out of the Dover Chronicle; because it records an occurrence
which suggests a new amusement:—
“BLowN INTo THE SEA.—On Tuesday, as a lady was walking down the lower ste
of the jetty at Margate, the wind, which was blowing almost a gale at the time, caught
under her crinoline, and she fell into the sea. In falling, it is supposed, her head
came in contact with one of the boats, as she received a severe cut over the eye.
One of the sailors, as soon as he saw what had occurred, jumped into the water and
brought her out.”
If the wind will lift a lady into the air by catching under her crino-
line, it will of course, when its force abates a little, drop her, unless
caused to sustain her by some contrivance calculated to effect that
purpose under the operation of physical laws. . A kite is a familiar
example of an object so constructed that the wind may be made to sup:
port it by being brought to act upon it in a certain direction. Now, if
the wind will lift a woman by a common-sized crinoline, it will raise
her still higher when its power is exerted upon one of larger dimensions.
By a sufficient extension of a girl's crinoline, in short, it would be easy
to convert her into an actual #. Here, then, is a new idea of pas-
time and recreation for youth of both sexes. On any fine day, with a
sufficient breeze, boys might be enabled to divert themselves by flying
their sisters, and sisters' young friends. The young lady employed for
the purpose would only want to have on a crinoline a very little exceed-
ing the circumference at present in vogue, furnished with a tail con-
sisting of bows of ribbon, and with an adequate length of cord affixed
by a hook to the centre of her girdle. The cord might be wound upon
a winch or windlass; and after she had been hoisted a little way,
which would require the united pull of several boys, she could be let
out by means of that engine to any required height by a single tolerably
strong boy. If the cord should snap, she would probably come down
| like a parachute; but, to obviate the ill consequences of a too rapid
descent, it would be as well always, if convenient, to fly her over the
sea a little clear of boats, where, in the event of her falling, she would
not be hurt, and sailors, seeing what had occurred, could jump into the
water and bring her out with little difficulty. - . . . .
A young lady of a scientific turn, whilst enjoying an airing in the
upper regions of the atmosphere, might also take advantage of her
position to make barometrical and hygrometrical observations, and
ascertain the quantity of ozone existing in that situation.
The remark may perhaps be made, that a very Fº name for a
young lady constituted in the manner above described a Kite, would be
ITTY.
An Army that is Well-Crammed.
It seems that the principal support of the Federal army is salt, pork
and “crackers.” We suppose that by the latter a complimentary allusion
is intended to be paid to the invigorating effect that M“CLELLAN’s des--
patches have had upon the spirits of the Northern heroes; for such
veracious documents as generally turn defeats into victories, and
retreats into “strategic movements,” cannot be looked upon otherwise
than as most substantial “crackers.”

THE NEXT THING—EVERY MAN HIS OWN ADVERTISER,
PAPAL SPORTS AND PAS-
TIMES.
By advice from Civita Vecchia,
we learn that:—
“Yesterday afternoon, being the De-
legate's birthday, that prelate ordered
some aquatic sports for the amusement
of the public—such as sailors runni
up a soaped bowsprit to get a flag, an
tumbling into the sea; his reverence
condescended also to fling 40 or 50 live
ducks from his balcony into the water.
where they were eagerly pursued by the
almost amphibious ors and fisher-
men.”
One wonders how many of the
pontifical sailors were kind enough
to contribute to the amusement
of the public by tumbling into the
sea in the attempt to run up a
soaped bowsprit gratuitously, or
anyhow for nothing better than a
worthless flag. The Delegate of
his Holiness at Civita Vecchia
might have created more sport,
if, to stimulate competition
amongst the faithful tars, he had
stuck an indulgence on the top
of the bowsprit. Then, after that,
if he had flung the ducks into
the water, the beholders would
have been amused with a consum-
mation of quackery.

ANSWER THIS.
When is a needy shoemaker
like a dying whale?—When he is
spouting his last.
A NOVELTY IN JOURNALISM.
The exploits of GENERAL Pope, performed on paper, the “strategic
movement” of M'CLELLAN, which proved to be a “stampede,” and
the Federal telegrams in general, converting defeats into victories, have
suggested the idea of starting a new º which, deriving its
'. from the nature of its contents, shall be called the Imaginary
etta. -
The º News will be constituted on the principle of supplying
people with the intelligence they wish to receive. There are many
persons who are sick of the abominable battles, with their hideous
accounts of killed and mutilated, the frightful accidents, the dreadful
murders and other atrocious crimes and offences, which abound in the
existing journals. In their disgust and impatience they are ready to
exclaim against the writers who serve them with this everlasting mass
of horrors:–
“Out on ye, owls; nothing but songs of death !”
They hunger and thirst after good tidings. They want pleasant things
to at breakfast to give it a relish, and not displeasing facts to spoil
it. The newspaper for their money is one which, in the hotel or the
railway carriage, would be a cheerful and not a dismal companion, a
wet blanket, a damper, a killjoy and a bore. They don't want to hear
of fires and conflagrations which put them in fear for their own homes,
or to be told that the funds have fallen and there is a panic in the City,
or that anything else has occurred, or is going on anywhere, likely to
ruin them or reduce their circumstances. They had rather not know
of deficient crops and potato blights and a terrible Cotton famine, or
any other form of distress which harrows their feelings and annoys
them with the º: of being called on to subscribe for its relief.
Detestable in their eyes are all the narratives of wars, and rumours of
wars that make them tremble lest this country should be involved in
hostilities, and threaten them with the aggravated penalty of an in-
creased Income-Tax, Considering that the disaster apprehended very
seldom happens, and that the disaster which does happen, is generally
unforeseen, they think they had better be made comfortable than un-
comfortable in the meanwhile, Hence the demand for a consolatory
and cheering journal, such as is contemplated in the foundation of the
Imaginary News.
The columns of the Imaginary News will be exclusively composed of
ſº information. The space devoted to its leading articles will
filled with observations conceived in a joyous and hopeful spirit,
calculated to inspire a happy frame of mind.
The subjoined announcements will exemplify the sort of reading to
be afforded by the Imaginary News.
We congratulate our readers on the certainty of a more than abundant
harvest, in fact the most ample ever known. Large quantities of
English corn will, it is certain, be this year exported to Odessa...
ENERAL GARIBALDI has entered Rome amid the acclamations of

THE LAST OF THE 'MERICANS.
From an Historical Romance preparing for Publication.
At length this internecine warfare came to its inevitable close. Of
all the eight, and twenty millions who had struggled and stamped
throughout the terrific conflict, a solitary unit now survived. eW
York and Memphis, Richmond and Pennsylvania, were heaps of broken
bricks on which announce boards were erected with the pathetic inscrip-
tion “For Sale.” LINcoLN and DAvis were locked in a last and (let us
hope) affectionate embrace. STANTON alone remained. The celebrated
feline duel in Kilkenny was eclipsed, for only one tail was left to tell the
dread catastrophe. JonATHAN's big bonfire-America—was extinguished,
but from its ashes rose a Phoenix-Empire, bearing the negro-classico
name of Pompeii. By no servile revolt, but by a natural law of com-
ensation, HAM became the acknowledged guardian of the public weal.
#. personal representatives, who, like, ELIZA on the wood-crowned
height, unmoved by cajolery or bribes, had been passive and dignified
spectators of the frantic fight, were now absolute masters of the soil
they had so long gratuitously tilled. Pompey THE FIRST was monarch
of all he surveyed' -
As STANTon, emerged from the War Office, his , features, bore
traces of deep dejection and remorse. “Oh, Stars and Stripes!” he
said, apostrophising a tattered banner which lay neglected at, his
feet, “we thought our Stars were fixed, and lo! like Lucifer, they have
fallen, and the Stripes we meant for others' backs have descended on
our own.” ś had, he given utterance to these veracious words
—the first of a series—when some Irish lacqueys in scarlet and gol
(the King's livery) politely requested his attendance before their royal
master. Escorted by these flaming menials, he quickly reached the
Saccharine Palace (built entirely of sugarcane), and as a lion, by in-
stinct knows the true Prince, mechanically the Yankee bowed before
the throne of Pompey, who like BLoNDIN-serene though greatly ele-
wated—was the first of his line.
Penetrated by compassion, for the lonely wight, the magnanimous
monarch held forth his soft dark hand to which in token of allegiance,
the eager, Yankee pressed his loyal lips." " " “The last of the
'Mericans,” as º tenderly called him, was then motioned to
depart. He now hºlds an engagement as Fire-reporter to the Press,
which in the hey-day of official prosperity, he had treated as a sick
child, and by the vehicle of military despatches, had compelled to
swallow the most nauseous stuff.
His sable Majesty, having drunk his sangaree and donned his purple
robes, then set º: É open. Parliament, supported by Silver Stick,
and preceded by t sher of the Black Rod.
THE ROYAL SPEECH.
-- M; Lords and Gentlemen,
... " In summoning you to our Councils, we congratulate you that our
faithful subjects, the coloured people of Pompeii, having set their
liberty upon a cast, have secured their independence notwithstanding
the hazard of the dye.
“We daily receive assurances of amity from Foreign Powers, with
whom our diplomatic intercourse is, distinguished by an amenity not
indigenous to any part of this great Continent.
“Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
“We had directed estimates to be prepared with due regard to
economy and the efficiency of the public service. While making ample
H.". for our , national defences, we are not unmindſul that
he Government which maintains vast military and naval armaments
solely for the acquisition of Glory or Territory derives its inspiration
from either a simpleton or a knave.
“Profiting by the º of an august ally the EMPEROR OF JAPAN,
we have made considerable retrenchments in diplomatic expenditure,
as the European States to which our ambassadors are accredited, now
deſray the entire expenses of the enbassy.
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“The export of our staple production, cotton, we are gratified
to learn, has immensely increased under our Government—the º:
being no longer regulated by physical force. Instead of hoeing with a
lash over his shoulder, the agricultural labourer now works with a
dollar before his eye. Golden syrup is a better stimulant than bitters.
Of this fact we have evidence in black and white.
“Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
“The financial affairs of the country, which under democratic
misrule had created universal alarm, are now placed on a sound and
satisfactory footing, and that without having recourse to the aid of a
Sponge.
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“Our Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has received a com-
munication from the Papal Nuncio expressing the gratification of his
Holiness with his recent visit to Pompeii, and intimating his inten-
tion to take up his permanent residence in this favoured land, where
wise and liberal reforms tend to consolidate our Institutions, and where
freedom of opinion is the birthright of all our sons.
“Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
“Our eldest, daughter, the PRINCEss of FloripA, is about to
form an alliance with our illustrious Poet Laureate. While recognising
the omnipotence of Love, we cannot but feel that our Royal House
will derive a lustre from its union with genius, more resplendent than
any jewel in our crown.
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“Sensible of the impolicy of sumptuary laws, we have never-
theless deemed it expedient, owing to the crowded state of our Hos-
pitals, to instruct the Aſtorney-General to prepare a Bill for the im-
mediate, abolition of Hoops, and (subject to the approval of Her
Majesty's Maids of Honour) for the substitution of some efficient mode
by which Hearts instead of Heels may be taken captive.
“The Early Closing Movement has always received our strenuous
support, and we should be glad if its advantages could be exten to
both Houses of Parliament, having frequently had occasion to remark
the evils connected with late hours of business, and being painfully
conscious that the evening's legislation will not always #. the
morning's reflection.”
Signs of Peace.
MR. WENDELL PHILLIPPs accuses his President of being “a turtle.”
MR, LINcoLN has been making a speech at a meeting, so the Bishop
of Oxford will be pleased to think that “the voice of the turtle is
dl heard in the land.”

MR. PUNCH, he scarce need say, has little wish to lessen the liberty
enjoyed by any free-born British subject. But the liberty of knocking
Mr. Punch upon the head, or of garotting him by gaslight, or of using
other violence against his sacred º, for such liberty as this Mr.
Punch has little sympathy, and he always will do all within his power
to diminish it. So, when Åir Punch observes that the libert extended
to incarcerated prisoners, released before the expiration of their sen-
tences by virtue of certificates which are called their tickets of leave—
that this liberty is used by its fortunate possessors as a means to bruise
and batter helpless people in the streets, and to perpetrate all sorts of
crimes and savage cruelties, Mr. Punch then feels inclined to look upon
such liberty as a wild and savage licence which ought not to be suffered
in a civilised community, and which in common sense and justice ought
to be suppressed.
Oh but, say philanthropists, you ought in charity to give the poor
unhappy criminal a chance of reformation. Yes, granted, so that this
does not involve the chance of cutting other people's throats, or using
fancy ways to bludgeon or garotte them. It has been ascertained that
twenty out of every hundred prisoners, who have been set free with
these certificates of leave, return to crime again when they possess their
liberty; and it is suspected by those competent to judge, that more than
fifty in each hundred of them actually do so. A large percentage this
for the philanthropists to fight against, when they try to make us fancy
that the ticket-of-leave system works, most admirably well, and that
very few, if any, evils are occasioned by it. Surely it is misdirected
sympathy to feel compassion only for those who are criminal. Ought
there not to be compassion for the innocent, who now nightly run the
risk of being strangled in the streets?. And ought not means for their
protection in pity to be thought of, before the interesting criminal who
threatens them be cared for?
Tickets of leave are granted durante witá bene actá–upon condition
that those blest with them shall properly conduct themselves. No || Read
fresh vice is needful to cause their being cancelled. It is legibly
endorsed upon each of these certificates that if the holder “associates
with notoriously bad characters, leads an idle and dissolute life, or
has no visible means of obtaining an honest livelihood, it will be
assumed that he is about to relapse into crime, and he will be
at once Apprehended, and recommitted to prison under his original
sentence.
In Ireland, says a writer in the Times, who seems acquainted with
the subject, these sensible conditions are rigidly enforced. In England,
he affirms, they are completely disregarded. Will SIR RICHARD MAYNE
inform us kindly, why? Have we in Pºlº not police enough to
watch the gaol-birds who are liberated? If this be so, SIR RICHARD,
ray get what more men you want, and let us know the cost of them.
riminal prevention is better far than cure: if tickets of leave dºcure,
which at present there are grounds for more than half denying. To pay
for more police is a less painful operation than to have one's eye gouged
out, or one's neck garotted. So, if need be, let us clap on extra peeler
power expressly to look after these interesting criminals, who by gam-
moning the governor, and coming the religious dodge to please the
chaplain, have managed to obtain a leave of absence from our gaols.
The police, by the late Poaching Act, will be obliged in some places to
put on extra bulls-eyes to see aſter the pheasants; and were some
extra men employed to watch the gaol-birds out of cage, p. there
might be less of poaching on our pockets, and garotting of our throats.

MONG the varieties of humbug
which have lately come under
our cognisance may be men-
tioned a letter, which has ap-
peared in the Bath Erpress,
under the signature of H. S.
FAGAN. It is a puff of the
seudo-catholic Church of All
Saints, Margaret Street, which
MR.FAGAN highly recommends
to Bath people staying in Lon-
don. He observes that:-
“The service must delight even
the most unartistic person, unless
strong preconceived prejudice pre-
vents his joining in it heartily. The
I'salms he will be especially pleased
with. While joining in that rapid
well-managed Gregorian, he will
feel that he enters more into the

better their use and value in congre-
gational worship than ever he did
before.”
And subsequently MR, FA-

gests the Jesuit decoy-goose,
indulges in the subjoined im:

“And this is the service which

of burning daylight, and otherwise aping popish rites and ceremonies. How the Psalms are

He is inclined to suspect that the in. admired
by MR. FAGAN at All Saints was a somewhat
similar performance in the key of D, or Donkey.
THE FEDERAL FELONB.Y.
THE brave army under the command of
GENERAL Pope, does not stint itself to plunder
with the strong hand. In a Federal newspaper,
even, it is stated that, “the troops also pass
among the population large quantities of forged
Confederate notes, manufactured in }.
hia.” The forces of GENERAL Pope had better
organised by distribution into divisions, each
destined to carry out a special operation. One
squad of these scoundreſs, selected for service
requiring the muscular strength of powerful
ruffians, might be formed into a brigade under
the denomination of Heavy Burglars; whilst
another set of thieves, designed for nimbler
depredations, might take the name of Light
Prigs. There might also be a scientific corps
of Pickers and Stealers, capable, doubtless, of
stealing anything but a march on the enemy;
but particularly expeditious, in stealing away.
This higher department of Pope's rascalry
should include a body of Faussaires who could
forge as well as utter counterfeit shinplasters;
and with these might be associated a regiment
of Smashers, if it were supposable that Federal
soldiers are paid in a metallic currency.
t is not, probable that any of GENERAL
Pope's villains march wide between the legs,
because, under the present humane conditions
of penal discipline, none of them could have
been accustomed to have gyves on. There is
doubtless more than a shirt and a half in each
company of them, because, if they heretofore
wanted underclothing, b this time we may be
sure that they have found linen enough on every
chanted at All Saints. Mr. Punch does not know; only knows that MR. FAGAN is pleased |h
with them; and surmises that the music which charms his ears may be peculiar. P.
once heard a foreign Priest, officiating in the genuine service of which that which delights

will soon have led his ragamuffins where they
are peppered.

“WHY SHOULD OUR GARMENTS,” &c.
“The Artists of the Nineteenth Century” have issued a declaration
(published by our friend, Miss EMILY FAITHPUI, and it was delicate to
use a lady's printing press in such a matter) “On the Influence of cos.
tume and fashion upon High Art.” The declaration is signed by a
great number of eminent men at home and abroad, and its point is to
insist that people of the present day dress so hideously that they will
not make pictures. A transitional change is recommended, and the
Declarers affectionately remind the public that so long as they make
Guys of themselves at the instigation of tailors and milliners, portraits
have no value except as family memorials, whereas, if we dressed pro:
perly, the artists would make us into tailean, which the whole world
should admire. All this is perfectly true, but what is to be done?
How are we to extricate ourselves from the tyranny of the tailor and
the milliner? This the Declarers do not tell us, nor was it to be
expected perhaps that they should advise us how to conduct a rebellion.
But why do they not tell us how they would like us to dress? Men
for instance. Are they to come out with a choice array of colour, an
with a picturesquely cut garb, and that general, ampleness and noble-
ness in treatment of costume, which bespeaks the grand and heroic in
the wearer? In that case, and unless the Declarers have something
better to recommend, which we humbly conceive to be impossible, there
is one garb which fulfils all the above conditions, and renders the
owner a subject for the pencil of the grand school. Need Mr. Punch add
that such costume is His Qwn. My brethren, what a world this would
be to live in and to paint if we were All Punches—except the Judies.
A Ticket-of-Leave that Really is Wanted.
We think that a Ticket-of-Leave might be granted with great effect
to his Holiness the Pope. A little travelling at this time of the year
would do him a great deal of good. . The French troops might accom-
pany him on the trip. They would be not only company for him, but
would be able, also, to protect him. Should the Pope be prevailed
upon to withdraw his holy person as well as his holy escort from Rome,
#|shot in the act of attempting, to stay bloodshed, by persuasion.
then the Pa º might be significantly translated into the three French
magic initials P. P. C., which, we all know, are the fashionable slang
for “Pour Prendre Congé.” The sooner he takes that congé the better.
SAINTS LAID DOWN TO MELLOW.
AMONG the news from Paris we read that:—
“The tomb in white marble, erected in one of the chapels of Nôtre Dame to the
memory of MoR. AFFRE, killed at the barricades in June, 1848, is now terminated.
The archbishop is represented in his soutane with the olive branch in his hand, and
in the act of falling mortally wounded.”
Why did not the Pope, the other day, canonising the alleged Japa-
nese martyrs, whilst his hand was in, canonise the real *† in whose
memory the above-described monument has been erected * The Japanese
sufferers are said, truly or falsely, to have been robbers and pirates, and
executed as such; but there is no doubt that ARGHBishop AFFRE #.
ls
Holiness might at least as safely, have declared the undoubted peace-
maker blessed as he affirmed the beatitude of the questionable victims,
There is a relic, too, of APFRE, preserved at Nôtre Dame; a portion of
his spine perforated by the shot which killed him, and which is fixed on
the point of a golden arrow that threads the perforation. No doubt
this relic is as miraculous as any other in existence, and will be found
so three hundred years hence, if there should then still be a Pope, who
may deem it expedient to canonise a martyr to all appearance meritin
the crown of one so well as the original proprietor of that section 9
vertebrae. It generally takes about three centuries to prepare the world
for the discovery that miracles were notoriously wrought with the
bones of a Saint immediately after his death. Perhaps, however, it is
less likely that ARchbishop AFFRE will be canonised in 2162 than that
the honour of sanctity will be conferred on some of those Irish martyrs
who have lately attested their faith, if not that of their, spiritual
teachers, on the gallows. That is to º provided always that there
shall at that ſuture period be a Pope in being, as there may be if the
physical force of civilised, France is eternally to uphold popery and
priestcraft in the Eternal City.

. It is well knownto physi-

any habitual outgoing from

that which is caused by

suddenly occurring, is apt
to occasion dangerous dis-
eases. Corresponding effects
in the body politic are to be

fact that the flow of emigra-
tion to the United States of
America has now ceased,
and many emigrants are
actually coming back again.
The retention of all those
injurious agents that the

give off to the United States
is likely, if not remedied, to
be a source of serious dis-
order.

A BLANK DAY WITH THE BLACK COCKS.
“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“. By the kindness of my ſriend CRAcksHQT, who has Govern-
mental influence, I have enjoyed a day's blackcock shooting down at
Coolmer Forest, and for the benefit of Cockney sportsmen, like myself,
I purpose now to give you some account of my enjoyment. Coolmer,
as of course you know, is near the old coach-road to Sherrysmouth ;
and, if any of the old coaches had been extant, on that road, I think
they would have carried us pretty well as quickly, and certainly more
smoothly than the railway carriage did which we were forced to trayel
by. Remembering the old saying about the early bird, and believing
that the Blackcock family were birds that§. up early, and might then
best be met with, we passed the night at Nosehook, or a place of some
such name, and started for our º: in the cool of the morning,
with the thermometer at scarcely more than ninety in the shade. Our
virtue in performing this feat, of early rising proved to be its own
reward, for nothing else rewarded it. With the exception of a donkey,
which a short-sighted sportsman might have shot at as a deer, the .
game we found in the first hour and a half was a couple of wild ducks,
which we might certainly have bagged if they had but been tame ones.
But except §. WILLIAM ARMSTRONG's, I know of no breechloader
that will kill at half a mile, and this is usually the distance at which
wildfowl think it safe to rise and fly away from one.
“I don't know how M'GREgoR felt when he had his foot upon his
native heath; but I must say for myself that walking on a moor is not
by any means so easy as walking along Moorgate Street. Perhaps
wading is a fitter name to give to it than walking, for one is more than
half submerged in a perfect sea of heather, and every here and there
one flounders into scarcely fathomable deeps, where a sportsman of
small stature, becomes ºil; immersed. CRACKSHOT, who has legs of
about the length of lamp-posts, of course progressed more favourably
than I could hope to do, and I fear that there was more of sarcasm than
sympathy in his repeated queries as to how were my poor feet.
“I have heard that on the Scottish moors the midges are a nuisance,
but I’ll back the flies at Coolmer to be found by far a greater one.
My head was all day long enveloped in a cloud of them, and you can't
think how I suffered from the buzzing biting big, and little children of
Beelzebub. I wished that Nature had provided them with better occu-
pation than spending a whole morning in plaguing and tormenting us;
but flies are not the only idle creatures in the world, that ji to
spend their time in plaguing other people.
“But, after all, the Blackcocks were themselves the greatest torment
to us. We were under strict injunctions not to shoot the hens, and
you may fancy what our feelings were at seeing five hens in five minutes
rising each to a dead point, and flying off unaimed at by our deadly
double-barrels. I hope that all who shoot at Coolmer are as virtuous as
we were, and with as noble resolution keep their hands from hen-
slaughter. The cocks too were as tantalising as we found the hens;
for they kept on getting up just ten yards out of shot, and not even a
wire cartridge could ‘perwail on them to stop” with us. In a part of
the ground called Pigmoor (which owes its name to Roger BAcon
calling for “more pig' when he was at a pic-nic there), I spied a fine old
cock upon the low bough of a fir-tree; and, like the admirer of the
hapless Lucy Neal, I thought if I were by his side how happy I should
feel. But when he saw me trying to stalk him, he waggled his old
head in the most provoking manner, as much as to say ‘You are a young
man, but you don’t get over me.’ So after wading for eight hours in a
Turkish bath of heat, our day's blackcock-shooting ended in our not
; one of them; and when I tell you as a sportsman that besides
black game, we saw partridges and pheasants which we also might not
shoot, and plover, snipe, and wild duck which kept safely out of shot,
you may conceive that our position made us somewhat think of Tan-
talus, and fancy that historments could have scarcely equalled ours.
*There is nothing vastly funny in this narrative, it is true. But at
least it serves to show what Englishmen will . submit to in
their ardour for le sport; and a blank day's blackcock-shooting is a ſar
more healthy pastime both for muscles and for mind than a morning
spent with dominoes in the manner of our neighbours, or with the
scarcely more laborious exercise of billiards. With which beautiful
reflection, -
“I remain, my dear Punch, yours most sincerely,
“RAMROD.”
“P.S..Grouse-shooting was clearly a classical amusement, for we
find it said of CAESAR that ‘ad Mauros projectus est,’ which evidently
means that he went sporting on the Moors.”
Muscular Christianity
AMONG the parties into which the Clergy are divided there is one
whose members are called “Muscular Christians.” What is a Mus-
cular Qhristian?...The best answer we can give to this question is,
that a Muscular Christian is a Strong-minded tº:

MUTTON IN DANGER!
No danger more, sensibly affects us than that which threatens, our
bread, except the danger which threatens our meat, but this is perhaps
more dreadful than the other; for most Englishmen, and all Irishmen
would rather lose their bread than their meat, provided that they could
preserve their potatoes.
For all that is said about English beef, the most popular form of
animal food in England is undoubtedly mutton. Terror and alarm,
therefore, cannot but be created in the minds of her MAJESTY's subjects
by the known fact, that, small-pox has broken out, and is still raging,
among certain stocks of sheep in Dorsetshire and Wiltshire. Our
mutton is in danger!
Now, if anybody expects that Mr. Punch is going to make any attempt
at joking on this serious subject, as by saying that the poor sheep are
much to be pitted, by perpetrating an antithesis between measly, pork
and variolous mutton, or by recommending the vaccination of lambs
along with little children, he takes Punch for a greater fool than he is—
according to the various rogues, pretenders, hypocrites, humbugs, .
quacks, pedants, and coxcombs whom Punch has annoyed.
What Mr. Punch does wish to do with regard to the disease which
menaces him with the #.". of his chops, and his haunch, his leg,
his loin, his neck, his saddle, is to deprecate the madness of attempting
to arrest, it by inoculation. It is said that PRofessor SyMONDs has
advised this proceeding; but such advice seems to Punch less worthy
of a PROFEssoR SYMONDs than of a Simple SIMQN.
Qn this subject Mr. Punch's opinion is fortified by that of an authority
no lighter than that of SIR. J. * TYRELL whose views of Protection, so
far as sheep and small-pox are concerned, are identical with his own.
SIR JoHN states, in the Times, that sixteen years ago, when the disease
occurred in Essex, a neighbour of his, whose sheep were inoculated,
whilst his were not, lost ten in a day to his one; and he says:—
"I have given orders that the moment the disease appears in my flock tho animal
shall be destroyed. I should as soon think of inoculating for the plague or the
yellow fever, now said to prevail in the River Thames.”
Inoculation, as a preventive of small-pox in the Christian, and our
fellow-subjects of every other denomination, having been abandoned
and condemned, why should it be practised on sheep? If the parson's
flock are not to be inoculated, why should the farmer's be?, The latter
ought not to be inoculated for the same reason as that which forbids
the former, namely, contagion; of which it, is said that the poison is
conveyed by starlings and blow-flies. No doubt there are many other
vehicles for it than the bluebottle in which the disease is bottled, and
the bird of the air which carries the infectious matter. The inoculation
of sheep would probably result in the diffusion of small-pox over, the
South Downs to begin with, and thence throughout the kingdom.
Mutton is quite dear enough as it is, and butchers thrive whilst veter
rinary surgeons have quite as much to do as they should. Surely
none of the Wiltshire farmers will inoculate their sheep, except the
lineal descendants of those famous bumpkins who tried to rake the
satellite of this planet out of a pool.

WE recollect that there was published years ago a novel, by Max-
well, called Stories of Waterloo. Looking at the many fine imaginative
passages in Mons. Thiers' Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire, espe-
cially in the latter volumes, we think that the above title would indicate
their contents with most felicitous justice. The word “Stories” woukº

PROBLEMS FOR PLAYGOERS.
ERTAINLY the best news-
paper for breakfast is
a theatrical one. If
it does not satisfy one's
desire for news, it
never fails to furnish
ample food for reflec-
tion. For instance,
here are four advertise-
ments taken from one
sheet, two addressed
to gentlemen, and the
other two to ladies. In
gallantry of course we
give the first place to
the latter:-
ANTED, a good
LEADINGLADY, for
the Summer Season. Also,
Chambermaid to sing be-
tween the Pieces; Second
Low Comedian to sing.—
Address, &c.
ANTED, a LADY CHARACTERISTIC SINGER and DANCER,
a Comic Singer, and a good Nigger. Good References. No stamps. Silence
a negative. F.s.ºires cºnnºrs ºn write.
The meaning of this Postscript we are puzzled to make out. Is
ability to write so unusual among actresses that Miss CRUMMLes
thinks it needful to advertise thus publicly that she possesses, the ac-
º: If this be really so, the next debate on Education
surely ought to bear some reference to the appalling, fact. Then pray
why is a “Chambermaid” required to sing between the pieces? Would
not a housemaid do as well or a kitchen-maid or cook? We º:
that if one asked a chambermaid to sing, which is about the last thing
in the world one ever would require of her, one might naturally expect
her to sing some “chamber music; but this is not at all well suited
to the stage, and the requirement of a song from her is therefore the
more perplexing to us. -
The notices to gentlemen of which we spoke are these:–
ANTED, IMMEDIATELY, a Gent for the Entire Lead, and two
Single Men for utility.—Direct, H. P.
WANTEP. a GENTLEMAN for the LEAD. Also, a Walking Gentle-
man to combine Responsible Business.-Apply to “The Lessee." Nostamps
required. Silence a polite negative.
What is the stage difference between a gentleman and a gent? There
clearly must be some distinction, or they would not thus be separately
specified. In common civilised society, we should hardly think a gentle.
man would ever think of offering to fill a place intended for a gent; but
possibly in theatres the terms are more synonymous. Again, why only
single men are wanted for “utility” we cannot well make out. Surely
it cannot be that actors, when they marry, cease to be of use? And
then, in what respect does a “gentleman for the lead” differ from a
“walking gentleman?” Is it that the former, as befits a leading per-
son, is required to keep a carriage; and fºr the credit of the theatre,
is not allowed to walk? What “responsible business” is intended for
the latter, and how he is expected to combine it with his walking, these
questions quite defeat ouringenuity to solve. The business of a bill.
sticker may be combined with ambulation, and country players, as we
know, sometimes distribute their own bills. But such business, though
responsible, is hardly such as needs a “gentleman” to execute it: and
we should think a walking small boy would quite as well suffice.

lands in question are those of France, which have become less profitable
now that the American War has lessened, the consumption, and the
rice, of articles used in dyeing. Thus much it is neces to explain,
or, considering that the Yankees may make up their minds to lose the
South, you might naturally suppose that those madder lands, in which
experiments for raising cotton are about to be tried are the frantic
Northern States. The madderlands of America surpass any that could
be found in the most sanguinary of Red Republics.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HARPOON FOR WALES.
..We are informed by the journals that circulate on the frontier of the
district called Wales, that there is going to be held somewhere in the
Principality a gathering, which is called in the barbarous language of
Wales an “Eisteddfod,” or assemblage of Welsh Bards, as they call
themselves... This is a nuisance of an ordinary character; but the
special meeting inW." is to be very large, indeed larger than has
been ever held in Wales. We think we read that between six and seven
hundred of the abominable Bards, who help to keep up what a Welsh
Gentleman in the House of Commons had the sense and manliness to call
the Curse of Males, namely, the Welsh Language, are to meet at this
Eisteddfod. This is well, We shall have a suggestion to make upon
the subject presently, in the mean time we should like English readers
to have a notion of the kind of bosh which these Bards emit. We read
in the Oswestry Advertiser, which works well for the cause of civilisa.
tion by giving much prominence, to the absurdities of the Cambrians,
that a lot of Bards, mixing up Bardery with the ºff Interest,
held an Eisteddfod in a Congregational Chapel at Bala. .The Bards
with a sweet adherence to the lofty impartiality of the poetic character,
addressed themselves to a glorification of a sectarian demonstration.
As citizens they had a perfect right, of course, to sing at a Dissenting
tea;party or any other gathering, but a Bard, a Bard striking his harp
and hymning MR. MIALL and the Anti-Church-rate Association! There
was a Dissenting minister in the chair, who was quite justified in
availing himself of whatever capital was to be made out of the Bards;
and after an address about the Bicentenary, he “called upon the Bards
to repeat their poetic effusions.” “Which,” says the report, furnished
we presume by a Welshman, “was complied with by Eos WYN and
Rhisiant Dou.” This latter gentleman may be some relative of
RODERICK or some other Doo, but we are not ſavoured with his lyric.
Divers Bards followed, and one got ten, shillings for the best
“englynion” to “Corwen and Bala Railway.” We have of course no
idea, , and desire, to have none, as to the meaning of the word
** º but it may be something in the way of compliment, and,
at all events, a Welsh poem is |*|| and naturally addressed to
Sleepers. But later in the day the following Bards repeated some
poetry. DYPNWALTEgip, DUET, MoELwyN, Eos WYN, and J. Evans,
CAstell. The last Bard has put his Welsh ideas into English, and here
they are-
“What is the distant murmur,
Falling as from the skies,
What is the voice that bids us
Children of Cambria arise;
What is the bidding that echoes
From ages long gone by,
What is that voice which calls us,
Rise to conquer or die.
'Tis the voice of your fathers long dead,
Calling from the * of the graves,
Ye children of Cambria arise,
Defy them to call you their slaves;
We do our fathers, we rise,
Hark, hark, to that echoing cry
- We are up like our fathers of yore,
We are up to conquer or die.
Where are those that bid us he slaves,
While we stand on the earth of the frce,
In the sound of wild Tegid's waves
Where murmur Trywern and Dee;
Our hearts are as free as the breeze
That bid Tegil's wild waves arise,
Then where is the man that would bid us
Be slaves, 'neath the freeman's skies;
We scorn your sways, we can despise your terrors,
There take your chains, pray keep them for your errors.”
Now what does Bard CastELL mean by all this 2 As for the murmur
tumbling out of the skies and requesting the Welsh to get out of bed,
we have no objection to that or any other poetic image. But when the
Welsh are out of bed, and we will add dressed, what are they to do?
Open their shops and sweep the same, and proceed with the ordinary
business of life. Certainly not. They are to “Conquer or die.”
Conquer what? Their obstimacy and ignorance, or the difficulties of the
English language, either of which operations would much tend to the
improvement of the Welshman. “Or die.” Never say die, Bard
CastELL. What do you want to die for P Live to drink many a draught
of muddy ale, three days old, and sputter much more Welsh. But, go
on, Cast ELL. 'Tis the voice of your dead fathers, calling out of their
graves. Why, you old humbug, you said just now that the sound came
out of the sky. That won’t do, Sº, unless your respected fathers
were ventriloquists. And what do they say? “Arise.” What -
Ah, they know your habits, and won't believe you get out of bed at the
first call. Welſ, and having arisen, what? ... “I)efy them to call you
their slaves.” jjefy whom Your fathers? That is the only gram-
matical construction of the passage. But if not your fathers, whom P

tion of the same insane question, CASTELL. Who’s “TEGID,” CASTELL?

scorn your sways.” Whose sways? Have you taken heart for another

can despise your terrors.” . But we have no terrors, CASTELL, except
terrors of hearing canticles like thoseº chant in the Congregational
chapel. Terrors, indeed! But you only wanted a rhyme to errors, an

tion of your splendid Sabbath waistcoats. Bosh, Cºrsii. You mean
“Take your change.” That, said respectfully is more becoming the mouth
of a decent little Welsh shopkeeper. But we come to your final epigram.

SOMETHING SUPERFLUOUS.
MR. PUNCH perceives in the papers of this week a London advertise-
ment beginning “FIRST Cousins WANTEp.” What extraordinarily
lonely man can have put this in. At the end of a season in which every
house in London has had more first cousins and second cousins and
third cousins in it than any non-insane architect would have declared it
possible to cram into the existing arrangements, a man deliberately
advertises for First Cousins. We #. he must be a bad man and of
kin to the Islington Cannibal against whom we had to warn a young
lady last week, and we recommend his affectionate cousins to keep out
of his way, especially if they stand in his light in the family pedigree.
Nobody in this International September can be advertising for cousins
for any good purpose.

A HOUSE AND A WIFE FOR LITTLE.
It has been long decided that, under certain circumstances, a man
may marry on £300 a year. How to marry and keep house on that
sum is another question, which, for many of our readers, perhaps
remains to be settled. In the interest of matrimony, as our neighbours
say, we hasten to propose a solution of this problem, which may be
accepted by some young men superior to vulgar prejudices. -
How to marry and keep house on £300 a-year? First, get your wiſe?
No. First get your house: for how can you expect that a sensible girl
will have you, if you have no home to offer her ? You want a good
house at a moderate rent. Well, there are such houses to be had. It
is well known that there are many houses at ridiculously moderate terms.
Nobody will take them, for the simple reason—the very simple reason—
that a horrid murder was committed in them some years ago, or that a
skeleton has been found under the hearth. First, then, how to get a
house to live in 2 Advertise for a HAUNTED HOUSE. -
Next, how to get a wife with only £300 a-year to offer her? That is
a small income in these days of crinoline and other sumptuous habits.
It will leave a small margin for ostentation and self-indulgence. Never
mind. So much the better. If you marry an inexpensive wiſe it is just
the same as if you married. ‘a girl with tin,” as a rich §." lady is
termed by juvenile sages. Girls may be cheap and nice, and all the nicer
and dearer for being cheap... Such girls there are with nobody comin
to marry them, nobody coming to woo, because of a peculiarity which
the ancient Romans adored. HoRACE would have jumped at a golden-
haired maiden. Advertise, then, for a wife with golden hair; call it
auburn if you like, and say that you are not º to a shade, but
prefer the tint which most nearly approaches that of a familiar
vegetable. -
aunted houses are almost always picturesque, and snug, the finest
old places that can be to smoke º in and drink real wine out, of
antique flagons. . Some golden-haired girls are among the most amiable
and intelligent of their sex, and also among the most beautiful to those
sensible young fellows who entertain no stupid objection to golden hair.
In your old Haunted House, with your young golden-haired bride, you
might be as happy as doves in a cage, or owls in an ivy-bush.

NWAR NENS
A YANKEE HICCUP.
ONE of the electric wires belonging to MR. REUTER has
been the unconscious instrument of conveyance for the sub-
joined ravings uttered by MR. Cassius M. CLAy, in a
speech which he lately made at Washington:—
“England is the most unfriendly nation on earth. Her conduct
on the slavery question is hellishly damnable hypocrisy. She is
looking for America's downfall, but France protects America. He
would not desist speaking against England. When England threat-
º *: national existence, Napoleon was the firm and fixed friend
or America.
“Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?” is the
uestion which will occur to every Englishman who reads
the maniacal invective delivered, as above reported, by
the Yankee Cassius. The style of this furious fool re-
sembles nothing ever heard in England out of Bedlam,
except the noisy truculent drivel of a violent imbecile
drunkard, in a paroxysm of delirium tremens, belching
frantic impotent abuse in the tap-room of a low public-
house. MR. Clay, apparently, is excessively given to
moisten that base clay ridiculously adjoined to the name
of a noble Roman, with brandy-smash, and otherinfatuating
and infuriating beverages. In this way he may be regarded as
a practitioner, though not an ornament, of the American Bar.
No sober Northern American gentleman, of course, could
speak of England in any other terms than those of the most
ardent gratitude for the marvellous forbearance which she
has exhibited towards those who, loving their own pride
and purposes, have subjected her to the cotton famine.
Only a drunken Yankee blackguard could abuse and blas-
pheme her in return for the romantic generosity with which
she has abstained from supplying the South with the ships
and the weapons which were ºf that they wanted for the
swift discomfiture of Yankeedom, Cassius M, CLAY may
pass for a stump orator; but it was evidently from no
stump that he howled the false nonsense above quoted. He
must have been rolling in the kennel or sprawling on the
ground; it is clear that he was unable to stand or go,
manifest that he was lying.
The SEAT or WAugh.-A pleasant country-seat, out of

PITY THE POOR FOREIGNERS.
WE hear a good deal said about preventing cruelty to animals; but
nobody appears to think a bit about preventing cruelty to foreigners.
By the care and labour of two charitable societies, cab-horses are saved
from being *. to death, and dogs that lose their way are tenderly
looked after and conducted to a reſuge. Now, when such care is
expended upon other living creatures, surely some one ought to start a
scheme for picking up stray foreigners, and conducting them in safety
whither they may want to go, and for saving them, if possible, from
being much fleeced when they get there. Members of a London Geo-
graphical Society should be placed at certain distances on duty in the
streets, to look out for unfortunate Mossoos who have lost their way,
and are as helpless as stray sheep, and quite as likely to be fleeced.
As it is, the poor Mossoo has only the police to guide his wanderin
steps; and a policeman, as a rule, knows nought beyond his beat, an
no one in a hundred of them could tell Mosso, the way he happens to
want to know, which most likely is the shortest cut from Leicester
Square to Limehouse. Besides, even if he know what directions should
be given, pray how is a policeman, who cannot speak one word of any
language but his own, to make himself intelligible to Mossoo or
Mynherr, who, it is nearly as presumable, does not know a word of
English. Of course, the consequence is usually that Mynheer and
Mossoo are in desperation driven io commit themselves to cabs, and it
may faintly be imagined what miles and miles they go before they reach
. destination, and how dearly, when they do so, they find they have
pay. -
THE PENNY-A-LINER'S BEST FRIEND.
FROM the number of accidents that are continually occurring, we should
say that the very best friend the Penny-a-liner ever had is Crinoline. The
mere fires alone that have resulted from wearing that fatal garment must
have cooked him many and many a dinner. . In fact, we suspect that on
several pccasions, when at a loss for a genuine accident, that it has also
fired his imagination, since it is almost impossible to believe that the
innumerable casualties recorded nearly every day in the papers can all
have been founded on fact. Considering the number of persons it has
consumed alive, crinoline seems to have inherited the secret of the
patent of Nessus' shirt—a secret that we always,thought had been for
ever extinguished with the life of its first Herculean wearer. It is a
cruel fashion, that, judging from the number of its unfortunate victims,
must have had Vºl. for its original inventor. However, though it
may have been death to hundreds of ladies, still º.
historian of the hebdomadal press it has proved a positive life-preserver.
in fact, our old friend JENKINs, declares that he is reconciled to the
fashion, out of gratitude to the large profit he has derived from it, and
candidly confesses that, if crinoline only continues in existence another
year or two, that he shall be able to retire from the profession he has
so long adorned, with a very handsome fortune.
A SNUG PLACE FOR A SMALL EATER.
We have heard a little lately about clerical preferment, and the snug
laces that sometimes are stepped into through the Church. Here
º, is a place which few would care to be preferred to, though it
is within the giving of a Member of the Church:-
ROOM and GARDENER WANTED, to attend to two horses and
two carriages, clean, boots and knives, and Puº daily, to wait at table occa-
sionally, and valet a gentleman, in a small family. ages C18 per annum, livery
and stable clothes, to lodge and board out. Address the Rev. Curate, – Recto
N—bury.
Plenty to do and little to get:, this appears to be what they who
answer this advertisement must look for. For a man to act as groom,
and gardener, and waiter, and knife-cleaner, and shoeblack, and valet to
agentleman, besides having to pump daily and look after two carriages,
he had need be pretty quick in his locomotive habits, or the odds are
he will never get half through his day's work. Figaro sº, Fºgaragiº,
Figaro qua, º lä. He must be here, and there and everywhere,
and always on the move, Sir, and able to do at least a dozen, things at
once. The power of ubiquity, combined with a small appetite, this he
ought to have to fit him for the place. Eighteen pounds per annum is
not quite a shilling a day, and this is no vast ºn tº buy one's board
and lodging with. There is a text which says, “The labourer is worthy
of his hire.” but whether such a hire, as is offered in this instance be
such as any common labourer would think worthy to accept, we leave
“the Rev. Curate” at his leisure to find out.

The Scene represents the Parlour, Hall, and doorsteps of a genteel house in
the suburbs of the Metropolis. Various bores, done up in white and
corded, also portmanteaus and carpet bags, also a bonnet-bor, and a
bundle of umbrellas, sticks, and a fishing-rod, are disposed in the Hall.

Mrs. N. (looking as objectionable as a woman always does when she has
a travelling dress on, no gloves, and a cross aspect). Well, what if it is

Mrs. N. That’s ten minutes to ten.
Mr. N. No, it isn't.
Mrs. N. Yes, it is. -
Žr. W. I tell you it is twenty minutes to ten, and we have got to
get to the Station. -
Mrs.N. You need not tell me that. Do you think I suppose that
the train starts from this door? -
Mr. N. No; but if we are to catch it, we qught to be off.
Mrs. N. What nonsense ! As if we should three-quarters of an
hour going there. - - -
Mr. N. %. no, for if we are, we shall miss the train by five minutes.
Mrs. N. No, we shan't, but you are always in such a fidget, and you
like to be an hour before time. -
Mr. N. Better so than an hour after it. Are you ready?
Mrs. N. I don't know. What’s that noise *
Mr. N. The Cab. I sent for it. ---
Mrs. N. That you might have to pay the man for waiting half an

Mr. N. If you are going to keep him half an hour, say so.

Mrs. N. No, it will not; it will be yours.

Mrs. W. Why, you keep nagging at me, and bewildering me till I
don't know whether I’m on my head or my heels. Have you got the I
bunch of keys?
Mr. N. I’ve never seen the bunch of keys.
Mrs. N. I gave 'em to you in the bedroom.
Mr. W. You did nothing of the kind. There they are in your basket.
Mrs. N. Then you must have put 'em there.
Mr. W. How could that be when you had the basket on your arm all
the time. But you’ve got them—what else have you got to dawdle for *
Mrs, N. Oh, there ! I declare. I had rather stay in town all the rest
of my life than be hunted and driven like this. Have you written the
directions for the luggage?
Mr. N. Lor, woman, yes, and stuck 'em on an hour ago.
Mrs. N. I dare say they'll all come off in the journey.
Mr. N. I dare say they’ll do nothing of the kind.
Mrs. N. You know they all did when we went to Boulogne.
Mr. N. I know that one did, which, was your own putting on.

I desired the servants to stay up-stairs with the poor things, that they

Mr. N. Bosh! I was only saying how could the children have gone

one room to offer? - • * - -
Mrs. W. And you were so eager to accept that invitation, while if we

because it, was throwing away money, but his father can give anything
to an insolent cabman.
Mr. N. We shall have a break-down with all that luggage as sure as

A MAN TO BE SOLD.
The intelligent foreigner of course is well aware that we are used to
sell our wives in Smithfield when it pleases us... But that men as well
as women are sometimes sold in England, the following advertisement
will place beyond a doubt:—
OTICE.-If MR. F., who took apartments at 44, C– Street, don't
come for the DOG which he left there within three days he will be SOLD, to
cover the expenses.
If we believe our LINDLEY MURRAY, we must see quite clearly that
the “he” who “will be sold” is unhappy “MR.F.”. And unless the
advertiser intended to write slang, we must imagine that the sale will
be a mercantile transaction, resulting in the passing of MR. F.'s own
person to the holding of whoever offers the best price for him. Seeing
this with his own eyes stated in a public print, will not the intelligent
foreigner º home with the conviction that the Slave Trade does evist
in England, however we may try to give denial to the fact?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
PS.
E observe that at a meet-
ing of the officious noodles
constituting the Interna-
tional Temperance and
Prohibition Conference,
assembled at the Hanover
Square Rooms, in the
course of the much speak-
ing by which those fussy
busybodies exposed their
folly, the following espe-
cially remarkable absur-
dities were uttered. Ac-
cording to report, in a
paper É, the DEAN or CAR-
i Isle on “Legislation on
the Liquor Traffic,” sug-
gested by the House of
Commons in 1834, which
was read by the REv.
CANoN JENKINs:–
“The dean said that time had
exaggerated a hundredfold the
reasons for legislation which
existed in 1834.”
Considering the noto-
rious decrease of drunkcn.
ness which has taken place
during the last cight-and-
twenty years, DEAN Close evinced little judgment in asserling that time had exaggerated, the
reasons ſor legislation on the liquor trade. The less Close says about exaggeration of those
reasons the better. Tinie tclls only the truth. We also read that:-
“MR. HAUGHTox, of Dublin, could not understand on what principle of logic or common sense after
hundreds of Acts of Parliament, men could seek a continuance of restrictive measures.”
So far so wise. One wonders to hear such reason from the mouth of a teetotaller.
thinks one has met with a sensible advocate of temperance.
MR. HAUGHTON bewrayeth himself:-
“They must have free-trade or prohibition—he said the latter.”
Anybody endowed with the least logic or common sense would say the former. If hundreds
of restrictive Acts of Parliament have failed, the presumption is, that a prohibitive Act of
Parliament would succeed no better. But MR. HAUghton comes from Dublin. A less
rational gentleman never came from Cork with his coat buttoned hind-part-before.
Tectotal Ireland having spoken by the mouth of MR. Haughton :-
“DR. Figg, of Scotland, asked if it was not inconsistent with equity and British law that persons convicted
of crime committed whilst they were intoxicated should be subjected to punishment, and whether they ought
not to be treated as lunatics?”
Equity, DR. Figg, has no jurisdiction in cases of drunkenness, and though the LoRD
CHANCELLOR may direct the disposal of a lunatic's property, the Magistrate only can order an
A PARLIAMENT OF PUM

But in the very next sentence
investment, on the part of the drunkard, in the
Stocks. "Drunken persons ought not to be
treated as lunatics when they get sober, and
whilst they are drunk they are liable to get shut
up as it is (as Mr. Punch has elsewhere recom-
mended that they should be). It is not onl
consistent with British law, but it is a º
law-maxim, that drunkenness is no excuse for a
crime, but aggravates the offence. A very im-
becile person, who talks idiotic twaddle, ought
to be taken care of equally with a sot affected
with delirium tremens. Thou art answered, FIGG,
according to thy figgery. A fico for thee, FIGG!
The REv. F. Bishop, s ing of the Maine
Law in Yankeedom, said that:—
“The law was enforced at Worcester. He attended a
military festival there, at which sentiments were spoken
to without wine being drunk, and all the officers assem-
bled at breakfast next morning free from headache."
Wonderful! Does MR. Bishop imagine that
officers are generally accustomed to get drunk at
military festivals overnight, and come down to
breakfast with a headache next morning P And
are total abstainers never troubled with head-
aches—even after having listened to a long speech
made by a simpleton?
dreadful witticism was perpetrated by
another reverend gent:—
“The Rev. H. GALL objected to the disfranchisement of
publicans, which contemplated their existence, which it
was intended to terminate. (Laughter.)"
MR. GALL apparently proposes to terminate
the existence º º by starvation.
O GALL, thou didst make a bitter bad joke, and
art, indeed, the very gall of bitterness! Thou
also, GALL, art answered according to thy
quality.
After the inanities above quoted, we are happy
to present our readers with a bit of ſun, related
very seriously by a MR. SINCLAIR:—
“In explanation of the fact that liquors could be
obtained at Delavan House, New York, he said that MR.
DELAvAN had let the house on a lease which stipulated
that intoxicating drinks should not be sold there, but the
tenant evaded the terms of the lease by purchasing tho
next house and making a communication between them."
He knocked a hole through the wall. So, let
MR. SiNCLAIR and his allies be well assured, will
a coach-and-six, or a railway-train, be driven
through any Act of Parliament, bearing on the
liquor law, which interferes with the liberty of
the subject.
A TEMPTING OFFER FOR THE MILLION.
HERE is an advertisement that has been running about the French
and English newspapers. It beats in coolness any day that we have
had this extra-hyperborean summer:—
To BE SOLD, for 10,000,000 francs, the chef d'oeuvre of Raffaele and
of painting, an unknown original, representing the DEATH of ST. JOSEPH.
The person who first offers the price demanded will possess the picture without competition.
The right of reproduction will be disposed of separately. On view at Paris, at the
Galerie —, 17, from 1 till 9 o'clock every day, except Sunday. Monday and
Thursday will be reserved for those who, wishing to see the picture at leisure, but
without exceeding half an hour, will pay five francs for admission.
-
We advise, therefore, all those who have 10,000,000 ſrancs to spare,
not to lose a moment's time, but to make an offer at once. He who
comes first will have the honour of being knocked down ſirst. If the
second bidder were to make an advance of one, or two millions, his
offer would be indignantly rejected. The “competition” to possess
it is already so great, that if you hesitate one tidal train, the picture
may be for ever snatched from you. So attractive are its charms, that
You are not allowed to admire it for more than half, an hour at a time.
Tarry one ecstatic minute longer, and you are infallibly charged an extra
five francs. If we hadn't been to Paris already eight times this year,
we would rush over incontinently, without waiting to kiss the children or
say good-bye to Judy, purposely to see the chef d'oeuvre. It is true that
oNs. PAUL DE SAINT WICTOR says that the picture in question is not
worth 40 francs, but then Mons. PAUL is an art-critic who does not
understand anything about it... It is very clear that he hasn't ten
millions of francs to give, and, therefore, in his rage at not being able
to possess the invaluable treasure, he does his shabbiest to depreciate
it: , It is the usual spite of the world. In our opinion, we have not the
slightest doubt that this highly-priced tableau is in fact priceless—that
it is par earcellence one of those master picces that no money can

‘I have had the misfortune to become a bankrupt, and a brief report
of the circumstances appeared in the newspapers. I subjoin the material

“The bankrupt, a young man, had spent nine thousand pounds in about as many
months. The creditors consisted of hosiers, jewellers, publicans, bill discounters,
and others. No person appeared to oppose, and the examination was passed.”
“Just so, Sir, and I think it would have been very hard had any one
opposed. Í do not dispute the accuracy of the statement that I spent
nine thousand pounds in about as many months, but I contend that
this cannot be called an extravagant expenditure. Nine thousand
months, Sir, as I need not tell you, make seven hundred and fifty years,

I flatter myself that I cut rather a brilliant figure upon that interestin

Because we are, as we recede,
Advancing all the while.
The fiery comet rolls, on path

So we pursue our course of wrath:

SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST.
It was the intention of the Comet, when it originally
started on its holiday trip, to have paid a flying visit to the
Earth, but it became, on the very first glimpse it caught
of this terrestrial globe, so dissatisfied with what it beheld,
that it immediately turned tail, and is now hurrying away in
an opposite direction as fast as it can, Far from regret-
ting this estrangement, we are delighted to notice this
increasing coolness on the part of the Comet; for we are
confident if the Earth and its fiery friend were ever to meet,
that either one or the other would be sure to suffer dread-
fully from the consequences. It is peculiarly one of those
cases in which the farther two persons of quite contrary
#. are kept apart, the more likely they are to remain
rtenois.
that for the honour of England I shelled out the tin on that festive
occasion, and I had to pay rather jº when QUEEN Bess wanted
money to fight the Spaniards. I paid away money a good deal during the
Civil W. and KING CHARLEs the Second borrowed a lot of me,
which I need hardly tell you I never saw again; I own to having been
done in the South Sea Bubble, but we all make mistakes sometimes,
and I atoned for my fault, by subscribing, liberally to the defence of
England against the Pretender. I could not, I put it to you, stay away
from the coronation of GeoRGE THE THIRD, and prices were high in
those days, and I had my pocket picked in the No Popery riots of 1780.
I suffered also by the commercial embarrassments of 1810, and by some
of the companies, especially one for importing quicksilver from the
planet Mercury, in 1825, and this brings me on to the present time,
when I have also had my troubles. - -
“Now, Sir, I do not think that nine thousand pounds in seven

A Lesson to Auctioneers.
At the Mansion-House, one day last week, WILLIAM BRACKLIN, an
Auctioneer, was charged with an assault on a MR. Thomson, which con-
sisted in hitting the complainant a violent blow on the mouth. Defendant
pleaded guilty, and was fined 40s. and costs. Serve him right. Auc-
tioneers must be taught not to knock people down.

IT seems very strange that at the present moment, in America, when
they are experiencing the greatest difficulty in raising the wind, that every
one should be rushing away as fast as he can “to get out of the draft.”

A FEDERAL TRIUMPH.
A FEDERAL, warrior writes the New York Commercial a letter con-
taining the following account of an exploit in which he assisted at
l)onaldsonville on the Mississippi:—
“CAPTAIN BRoomE, with the marines of the Hartford, landed, and immediately
roceeded in search of one Philip LANDBAY, a noted guerilla captain, and a very
esperate character. We came upon him as he entered the lane l g to his house,
before he had time to gallop out of the gate, and as his horse could not jump the
fence, he left his horse saddled and bridled, also his sword, all of which we captured.”
What, all? That was a seizure indeed for the marines of the Hart.
ford, with CAPTAIN BROOME at their, head! It appears by the fore-
going account, that they not only took the horse of the guerilla Captain,
saddled and bridled, but likewise the whole of his sword., What a
quantity of plunder! Having accomplished this wonderful capture,
our hero tells us:–
“We then proceeded to his house, which was handsomely furnished; we burned
his house, furniture, stables, outhouses, and sugar refinery valued at $100,000.
While engaged in burning his property, a party of guerillas fired upon us from the
bushes, but at too great a distance to do any damage. We suppose they imme-
diately ran off, as we could find nothing of them afterwards.”
Is it possible that these warriors would have run off too if one or two
of them had been shot by CAPTAIN LANDRAY's guerillas “while
engaged in burning his property?”
The gallant fellow says in conclusion:—
“We burned, besides, some 24 houses, including hotels, saw-mills, &c., destroying
over half a million dollars' worth of property, and returned to the fleet without
losing a man.”
There is or was a political section of Americans rejoicing in the name
of Barnburners. Perhaps this party has taken military service under
the Federal Government, and the author of the above-quoted, tale of
arson practised on private houses as a warlike operation, and his com-
rades, together with their leader, CAPTAIN BROOME, belong to the corps,
which has been draughted into the marines of the Hartford. There is
a genuine Yankeeism in the unconsciousness of a ludicrous self-exposure
remarkable in his description of the manoeuvres carried out against
| “PHILIP LANDRAY, a noted guerilla chieftain and a very desperate
character.” The narrative evinces partly the self-complacency of a man
relating his share in a pleasing and meritorious transaction, and partly
the gust with which a felon details his crimes. With what a relish, having
described himself and his companions as having “captured”. CAPTAIN
LANDRAY's sword, he goes on to say, “We then proceeded to his house
which was handsomely furnished,”—evidently gloating on the value o
the furniture they destroyed—“we burned his house, furniture, stables,
outhouses, and sugar refinery, valued at $100,000!”. How keen is the
enjoyment with which he dwells on the injury which they inflicted on
the Confederate officer, “while engaged in burning his property,” and
with which he mentions that they burned numerous other houses, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
REPORT ON HASTINGS.
By oun own special, COMMISSIONER.
O THE HON. M.R. PUNCH.
“SIR,-l. You having
commissioned me to visit
this ancient and celebrated
Cinq Port, and to report
upon its general condition
with mention of any special
circumstances which might
seem to me desirable of
notice, I have the honour
to make such report, as
follows:–
“2. I number my para-
§: as usual in official
espatches, and for more
convenient reference. .
“3. For reasons inex-
plicable to myself, you
desired me to depart from
my ordinary rule of select.
ing as my quarters the most
distinguished Hotel in the
place, and of affording its
proprietary every oppor-
tunity for displaying its re-
sources, and you instructed
me to take lodgings and live
quietly. Repulsive to my
own feelings and habits as
was such a course, I have not hesitated to obey, for reasons that will
occur to yourself or your respected cashier. -
“4. There were no lodgings to be obtained on my arrival in Hastings
but towards nightfall I watched a family out of a house, and I rushed
in before any other candidate could arrive. I secured a back parlour
and a closet, which it would be flattery to call a bed-room, for two
guineas and a half a week, kitchen fire, shoe-cleaning, gas, and most
other things of course extra. I could have lived more cheaply at an
hotel, mais tu l'as woulu, M. Punch.
“5. There are six families in the house, and they all insist on taking
their separate meals at the same hour. There are eleven children in
all, from a hobbedyhoy with clumping boots and a heavy voice to a baby
whose incessant shrieks indicate rather a very bad disposition or a
totally indifferent nurse. They begin to get up at six, after which there
is no peace. I mention this martyrdom among the special circumstances
referred to in Paragraph 1.
“6. The cigars sold to visitors in º are, so far as I have yet
had opportunities of ascertaining, simply abominable. Whether the
vendors have better ones for the residents. I know not, but I have
not allowed price to stand between me and decent tobacco, as you may
be aware it was not likely I should do. I am exceedingly unwell in
consequence of this local peculiarity.
“7. I think I have never seen so many pretty girls in any given
watering-place as are now, in Hastings...That I can appreciate this
fact, under the moral disadvantages implied in the paragraph No. 6,
may I think be taken in proof of my impartiality as well as of m
º: They mostly wear hats, have lovely hair (much golden, hair
is visible) but the new sea-side jacket of blue with its little brass
buttons is not much worn, save by those who have few other attractions.
“8. This is a place rather for aristocratic sorts of people than for
common holiday makers. This statement is not my own, but was
tendered to me by my landlady in return for my complaint that several
articles were about twice as dear here as at Brighton. I was instantly
silenced, or rather convinced, and I, replied, “O, of course, we don't
care what we pay, aw, but we like the best of ſeverythink, a sentiment
which obtained that lady's admiration.
“9. The Local Board of Health is said to have doneagood deal for the
Drainage, which used to be outrageously bad. There are awfully fishy
odours in Hastings proper, and there is a vast pipe in front of Hastings
elegant, and I º: it is all right, but I have not ventured near. I
detect nothing objectionable in the general atmosphere. The Board
has painted its name in large letters on the backs of all the seats along
the sea-seats may have no obvious connection with a Board of Health,
but the dodge is a good one, as it perpetually reminds visitors that
there is a Body watching over the º condition of the place.
“10. The boatmen are not very troublesome, and if you make a
tolerably loud and abusive answer to one tout, the others will let you
alone. You are not much annoyed by the vendors of shells and pin-
cushions: I suppose they find it hopeless to bother us, the aristocratic
sorts of people. The balming machines are very bad, but the curators
thereof are extremely civil. Decorum of all kinds is strictly enforced,
a contrast to most watering-places.
“11. The hired carriages are very good, indeed. Most of the drivers
have red faces. The turnpikes are numerous, and the roads are, on the
other hand, badly made and badly kept. Perhaps, if the pikes were
done away, the roads might be better. They could hardly be worse.
“12. The Dripping Well scarcely drips, and Old Roar doesn't roar.
Both are humbugs, but the scenes, in which they are placed are pretty.
The Lovers' Seat is connected with the dullest and stupidest common-
place story of an elopement, but the view is an out-and-outer. -
“13. The Hastings Guide Book is the worst ſever bought. It is
padded out with antiquarian rubbish, and the careful detail and advice
which alone make a guide book worth having is absent. But the con-
coctor may have purposely left it unexplanatory, in the interest of
º biped guides, and the like, in which case I admire him as a man
of Hastings, while I object to him as a man of letters.
“14. The Volunteers work very gallantly, and have the most, de-
lightful shooting place. To lie on the hill-side, near the sea, and look
at them, makes one feel quite ardent in the cause of patriotism, and the
more so when one has a good weed, presented by an officer, from his
London remnant. I believe that if the battle of Hastings had to be
fought over again, the Volunteers would do better service than the old
Archers, and then, when the order came for an advance with the Bills,
wouldn't the lodging-housekeepers make the foeman bleed?... .
“15. The Circulating Library keepers are excessively obliging, and
get the new books and let you have #. at the shortest notice. They
do not seem to think it a favour to let you have a book, and they do not
insult you for expressing an unfavourable opinion upon, one which they
may place in your hands. In a word, they know their business. Con-
sequently, there is great reading in Hastings... I saw one of my own
works, though by no means my finest, in the hands of eight very
handsome ladies. [? Blitor of #, -
“ 16. Dover is within sight of Hastings, and letters from H.E.
to Dover are sent round by London, so that you get an answer on the
third day. I don’t know that it much matters, as nobody can be in a
hurry to hear from Dover, but I mention it as a curiosity of the post.
“17. I am happy to say that there are no public amusements here,
except throwing stones into the sea, so that I am spared the necessity
of º provincial abilities or London intolerabilities.
“18. The cigars are abominable, but the girls are very pretty.
“I have the honour, &c.
“Bohemia, Hastings.” “PEREGRINE FALcon.”
GARLBALDI DOWN
ALAs the love of Italy lies bleeding,
But not in vain; his wounds are mouths, that speak,
With an ungenerous Patron strongly pleading,
The stronger that the Prisoner's voice is weak.
He fell, a forlorn hope of patriots leading, -
Whose cry for Rome had fallen on ears unheeding.
How long ! And must they Rome still longer seck?
A hero's venture, not a madman's freak,
The world had named his high . succeeding.
It has not failed, a captive though he lies,
If niggard France relent. NApoleon, hear
The noble blood that out upon thee cries,
And thy base policy, which right denies
To Italy, if not thy baser fear.
SUFFERING AND SYMPATHY.
THERE is, in Galignani, an account of an accident which happened
near Brussels to a foreign nobleman, who was riding in his carriage,
when his horses took fright at the discharge of some firearms, and ran
away with him; whereupon, says Galignani:-
“The count jumped out, but being struck by the wheel, he fell violently to the
ground, breaking one of his legs and receiving other injury. His condition, how-
ever, does not inspire any uneasiness.”
Doesn't it? The condition of a man laid up with a broken leg, not
to mention any other injury, may not inspire any uneasiness, but must,
one would think, involve not a little.
The Progress of Slang.
A MARRIAGE in high life is called, an alliance. People being gene-
rally prone to ape, their superiors, this foolish word will soon come to
be applied to marriages in middle life and low life. The necessary con-
sequence will be, that a married couple will be called Allies. y
we speak of Captain So-and-So and *. Lady instead of his Wife. It
will next be Captain. So-and-So and his Ally, and ultimately “Me and
my Ally” instead of “My Wife and I,” or “I and my Husband” will
be a customary form of speech amongst the lower orders.

the Prayer Book in the spirit of men of the world, and did not scan-

SCIENTIFIC STEALING.
The subjoined extract from a police report
relates to a not very common offence:-
“THAMEs.-Yesterday, George Wallis, aged 41, a
º: and gardener, was charged with stealing 500 feet
of gas.
We have heard one schoolboy ask another,
whistling a tune, “How much is that a yard?”
but in the case above quoted we find an air, to
wit, carburetted hydrogen, measured by the
foot. It is lucky for the gas companies that
aériform fluids are capable of being measured
somehow, so that a thief who s a volume
of gas may be tried and punished as effectually
as the fellow was the other day for stealing
books out of the British Museum Library. But
when gas is superseded by electricity, how will
that be measured It can’t be weighed, being
one of the “imponderables;”. it has no dimen-
sions, and the electric fluid is incapable of being
meted by ſº and quart. The electrometer
does not divide it into quantities, but doubtless
invention will keep pace with discovery, and a
suitable instrument will serve to indicate the
amount of electricity which a rogue has fil
from a wire. We may trust the science of the
future to take care of its own.
Obvious.
SoMEBody advertises some tinted spectacles
which he states to be used by tnumbers o
the aristocracy, “including RD PALMER-

diately to send for a pair, for we like to see

HINT FOR AN EXPERIMENT.
THE London Magistrates are, as a rule, just, intelligent, humane gen-
tlemen, who desire to discourage, as much as possible, the crimes they
have to punish. And they one and all declare that at least two-thirds
of such crimes are committed in consequence of Drink. These pre-
misses granted, does it not seem odd that the following is virtually, if
not in words, the dialogue which passes day after day in our Police
Courts P
Magistrate. Prisoner, you are proved to have beaten your mother,
kicked the constables, and otherwise behaved in a most brutal manner.
What have you to say?
Prisoner (doggedly). I know nothing about it
Magistrate. You were drunk?
Prisoner. Very drunk.
Magistrate. O, well, if you were drunk, that makes a difference. A
drunken man does not know what he is doing. It is very wrong of you,
however, to get drunk, and I fine you twenty shillings, which I hope
will be a lesson to you.
The prisoner immediately paid the fine, and went away, as he said, to
wop the witnesses.
This is really what the usual conversation between the Magistrate
and the Prisoner amounts to, and the ridiculous fine is the result. But
suppose º Mr. Punch throws out the jº. with all respect for
the excellent Magistrates) the dialogue should take this turn :
Magistrate. You say you were drunk?
Prisoner. Yes, I was.
.Magistrate, Very well, you plead guilty to that offence, and I
will deal with it first. A man has no right to get drunk, because
drunkenness is in itself a crime, and exposes him to the danger of
committing other crimes. I send you to f
drunkenness, and when that term #. expired, we will take the other
offences. .
The prisoner was removed, declaring that all justice was at an end, if
a fellow was to be treated like that for what he did when he didn't
know what he was about.
Suppose this experiment were tried—it could do no harm, and it
might do much good, in the way of disabusing a large mass of persons

A HOPELESS HUNT.
The Morning Post publishes the subjoined announcement:—
“We have authority to state that the MARCHIoness or QUEENsBURY, who has
lately become a Roman Catholic, left her residence, near Weybridge, last week,
clandestinely, taking with her the three youngest of her six fatherless children
and leaving no clue to her place of hiding. There is no doubt it is in the power of
the guardians and the nearest relatives of the late marquis to trace her º:
flight, and, through the strong arm of English law, to rescue the children an e
them wards in Chancery.”
The relatives of the late Marquis º be able to trace her ladyship's
flight, but although they may follow her they are not likely to catch
her. The pursuit of a Marchioness who has turned Papist, and flown
off with her little ones, must be a wild-goose chace.
JUSTIFIABLY TERRIFIED.
THE ºf awful apparition in the pulpit is recorded to have been
lately witnessed:—
“Yesterday morning, at a Church at Forest Hill, the Communion Service was read,
and the Sermon preached by a Clergyman wearing a black beard and moustache.
His hair was parted down the middle."
Some of the papers that have noted this *Rºllip; fact, describe the
congregation as º: been “alarmed.” MR. PENRose, and others
who advocate the adornment of churches with pictorial works, may find
an argument in such alarm. Did the terrified suburbans ever see a

NATURAL INTEMPERANCE.
THE Total Abstinence spouters talk about toasts and sentiments being
drunk without wine. So, if talking bosh is any sign of drunkenness,
are most of their drinkers.

THE JOLLY JURISTS OF GERMANY.
According to “honest Iago,”, England is the country
indeed they are most potent in potting.” Although “your Dane, your
German, and your swag-bellied §erº excel most other nations in
that accomplishment, they “are nothing to your English.”. Whatever
may have been the relative capacity of this and those other nations
for drinking in the time of SHAKspeARE, and whether or no “your
English,” at the present day, retain their former superiority in strength
to tope over “ your Dane,” and “your swag-bellied Hollander,” there
is reason to believe that now at any rate there is nobody better able
to stand a considerable quantity of liquor than “your German.”
The United Kingdom Alliance, established to obtain a law prohibiting
the sale of fermented, drinks, is a body which, being accustomed to
mind other people's business, will be naturally interested in the infor:
mation afforded by the following paragraph, relative to foreigners, and
illustrating Teutonic prowess in potation :-
“where
“Eleven hundred German jurists are now in Vienna. In the evening of Sunday
they and 700 Austrian jurists sat down to a supper given by the municipality of the
jº. and the 1,800 persons managed to dispose of 80 casks of beer, 3,600 bottles of
red and white wine of the country, and 1,050 bottles of first-rate champagne. The
supper with music, cigars, &c., cost the city no less than 40,000 florins (£4,000).”
. Certainly “your German,” as represented by these sages of the law,
is at least as potent in his potting as any modern Englishman. The
achievement above narrated could not have been surpassed by a sym-
º of British judges. For of course the jolly jurists did not get
k, because it was Sunday, and besides any symptoms of intoxication
exhibited by them would have been noted, for, ſun. No doubt, they
were as sober º: as we say, meaning by the sobriety of a judge
the state of self-possession which a judge retains after having taken
wine enough to make several ordinary men drunk. If they had talked
nonsense, the Press would have published it; but we are only told that,
after having consumed nearly £4,000 of wine and beer:-
“The Germans learned in the law have talked much since they have been in
Vienna, but nothing worth repeating is reported.”
The soberest legal disquisitions may be not worth repeating. We
may safely conclude that the speech of the German jurists, during their
carouse, consisted in utterances of the prosaic wisdom and weighty
jocosities characteristic of and suitable to personages of their ponderous
nation, and dignified profession, over their cups. No doubt they held
a solemn supper, and drank an enormous quantity of wine, every one
of them with a profound gravity, the centre of which never at any time
became vertical to a #. outside of the base of support or chair which
maintained each erudite jurist in the position of an upright judge.
The Health of the Potatoes.
ExAGGERATED statements have been made of the reappearance of
the Potato Disease. Under the º of ATUBER, a correspondent
thus writes:– “They say that the blight has attacked some of us, but

a feminine contortionist,
whom you had been to see
at the Allshambles Palace.
No doubt too you have seen
Monsieur BlonDIN on the
high rope, and considered
his performance as one of
an artistically elevated cha-
racter. Well, tastes natu.
rally differ and are not to
be accounted for, and what
one man, thinks disgusting
another finds enjoyable. But
has it ever crossed your
mind that by attending
these performances, you are
aiding and abetting to put
human life in danger, and
encouraging, may be, a taste
for secing suicide? It is
very well to say that men
s like LEOTARD and Blon-
DIN, by constant practice,
have their nerves and limbs
completely in control, and
what were death to you or
me, to them has little danger. I grant you that the peril is much
lessened by their usage to it, but the danger still exists, and may any
night prove fatal. With all their skill . practice, Monsieurs LEo-
TARD, and BLQNDIN cannot make themselves proof against the freaks
of nature; and, to say nothing of the fact that ropes are not inſallible
and by accident will break, pray what human skill can guard against
those physical contingencies which every human frame is heir to: A
sudden cramp or spasm, or a momentary giddiness, would suffice to
stretch the acrobat a corpse upon the floor, an I make every spectator
feel as though he had been an accessory to manslaughter.
Besides, performers are in general by no means so well skilled as
LeoTARD and BLONDIN; but while there is a craving for “sensation”
feats like theirs, of course there will be found, men, willing to attempt
them, and ready at a price to put their necks in nightly danger. While
Music Halls are crammed to see the Wondrous LeoTARD, and in con-
sequence he pockets, say, his twenty pounds a night, depend on it his
ſeats will be copied more or less by Muggins the Miraculous, or the
Bounding BugGINs. . Now, the trapeze, at first sight seems innocent
enough. . It simply is a series of swinging bars, a dozen yards apart,
whic .# set in motion, the performer grasps in passing, and swiftly
flies along from one bar to ... without touching the ground. But
exciting as his flight in mid air seems at first, spectators soon get tired
of seeing the same thing; and when its novelty wears off, the dish has
to be spiced with a dash of some more danger in it; and so trapeze-
performers practise summersaults and turnings, and tumblings in their
flights, and nightly introduce fresh perils in their º until the
climax of attraction and of danger too is reached. All may go on safely
until at length some evening, excited by applause, the performer tries a
ſeat which he has barely practised. There is a slip—a ſall—and then
the strong man is picked up a bleeding, senseless, huddled heap, and
perhaps a wife and family are left without support.
Now, I would not undervalue feats of strength and skill, nor the
courage that is needed to practise and perform them. An acrobat must
have no ordinary pluck, or he could never face the dangers of the tours
de force required of him; and as an Englishman, of course I can't help
liking pluck, wherever I may find it. Still I think that in such exploits
as those of M. BLONDIN and those of the trapeze, there is more risk
than is allowable for human beings to incur, unless there be a vital
reason for their doing so. A soldier mounts a breach, or a sailor goes
aloft in the midst of a typhoon, because it is their duty to put their
lives in peril. But these things are exceptions, and are not done daily
for mere sake of exhibition, and that crowds may go and gape at them.
Again, there is great danger in well, nigh every field sport. A bold
rider is fortunate if he escapes a broken neck, and, with the modern
catapultive round-shot style of bowling, a cricketer may generally thank
his lucky stars if he suffer nothing worse than being beaten black and
blue. But these are healthy sports, and are none the worse to my mind

º
for the danger there is in them, which puts a man's endurance and
courage to the test. The risk is not injured for the mere sake of
getting money, and of affording an unhealthy cKcitement to a mob.
Moreover, in the hunting field as well as in the cricket one, there is
a F. to those occupied that far outweighs the peril. Ruſ, with
all his nonchalance, and coolness when at work, who believes that M.
BLONDIN feels a pleasure in performing, or that M. LEOTARD is not
glad to get to supper without a broken back?
Another reason why I object to these performances is because of
their unhealthy effect upon spectators. We call a Spanish bullfight a
brutal exhibition, and hold up our hands in wonder, that gently-nurtured
ladies can affect to take delight in it. But in a bull-fight it is mainly
brute life which is threatencq; whereas in the trapeze and M. BioN-
DIN's case, the sole risk that attracts is that of a man's neck. Yet
ladies highly born have flocked to such º: and have sat
through them with rather enjoyment than disgust. And can you think
they did so without some mental detriment? Do you not imagine that
accustoming the eye to such exciting sights, blunts and blights the
better feelings of the heart, and hardens all the tender sympathies of
nature?...I believe that, man or woman, whoever is accustomed to the
sight of life imperilled, loses gradually the sense of º it should waken,
and grows callous to the sight of human suffering and pain. The most
tender-hearted beings after going to a course of Perilous Performances,
would see an accident to limb or life without feeling much sorrow; and
would regard it rather less as a misfortune than a fault. If a man fell
from a ladder, or a jockey from a horse, they would criticise the clumsi;
ness and not pity the ºlº; and instead of feeling º and
crying “Oh, poor creature l’” would be more inclined to call out
“What a stupid muff!”
. Perhaps you say you are only doing what your forefathers have done
in going to see feats like those of LEOTARD and BLONDIN. wili
grant you there is nothing very new in their performances. Any middle-
aged young man who has a score of years of memory must recollect
rope-walkers at Vauxhall and Cremorne, who went nearly if not quite
to the same height as M. BLONDIN; and men whose heads do stoop a
little on their shoulders, and the shadow of whose waistcoats is more
convex than of yore, can tell how MADAME SAQUI used every night to
make her “terrible ascent,” surrounded by a halo of flying squibs and
crackers. It is not the novelty but the chance of neck-breaking that
appears still to attract. I would no more let my girls attend these
Perilous Performances than I would allow them to go and see a prize-
fight. But, as I said, tastes differ; and the crowd that thronged the
É. Palace when BlonpıN, first performed was one of the most
fashionable ever there assembled, and quite as many ladies as gentlemen
were present. Strange as it may seem, it has been ever thus, as any
one well up in history can vouch. Still, within the last half-century
we in England have been bragging about our March of Intellect, and
boasting of the strides that Education has been taking with its seven-
league stepping boots. There arises then the question-Aſter all, does
Education in reality refine? The love of Perilous, Performances so
rampant still among us is merely a new form of the old gladiator gusto
with which the bloody Circus scenes were relished in old Rome. We
lift our eyes in pious horror at the cruelties wherewith the heathen
matrons were wont to feast their eyes, but how many highborn mothers
In º: Christian land have brought their girls to see (perhaps) a broken

Whether the taste for quiet pleasures is dying out among us, killed
by the excitement of the battles º in business, now that, the
money-getting mania is inſecting every brain, I leave to other moralists
with more leisure to inquire. i. there is certainly a growing taste
for, pleasures spiced with peril (such as M., BLONDIN's omelette
cooked on his high rope), and to my thought this is clearly a viliated
º betokening a most unhealthy state of palate, and one which
only a strong purgative of common sense can cure. I would say then,
my dear ToM, that the less that you or any other young man from the
country go to places of amusement with the chance of seeing suicide,
the better it will be for you and those with whom you have to do.
When you are in Spain, be a Spaniard if you please; and go to see a
bull-fight, and what brutal sports you like. But do not carry home
your relish for Perious Performances, or, by giving them your patronage
encourage their existence. It is surely hardly decent for a well-bre
Christian gentleman to show a taste for seeing necks put needlessly in
peril, and visit places where his presence may stimulate performers to
commit sensation suicide, or at least to get their living by what is very
likely to bring about their death. - -

Holiness been as attentive to Christian as to Mosaic work.

RIEND. PUNCH,
“I Do not question
the benevolent motives of
the United Kingdom Alli-
ance, and other tempe-
rance societies, that have
lately been holding their
conferences, but it strikes
me that they are some-
what peremptory, if not
tyrannical, in the enuncia-
tion of the various reforms
that they wish to see prac-
tically carried out.
“Suppose that every
class of hobby-mongers
were as dictatorial as they.
The consequences would
probably be as confused a
cavalcade as the following:
“The vegetarians would
denounce the consumers
of animal food, and the
latter would inveigh just
as loudly against the
former. The vegetarians
would petition Parlia-
ment, praying that no one
should be allowed to take
the life of a periwinkle or
a sucking pig, whilst the
partakers of fish, flesh, and fowl, would, moved by the same charitable feelings,
call upon our legislative rulers to prevent the lovers of greens and carrots con-
demning themselves to a slow but certain death by persisting in such a wishy-
washy unnutritious diet. - -
“Again, the publicans, the wine-merchants, and the great brewers, might, with
as much justice, insist upon the teetotallers drinking nothing but spirits, wine,
and stout and porter, as the disciples of FATHER MATHEw display in attempting to
exact a legislative enactment that, because they like water themselves, and believe
it to be the true fountain of health, so consequently that every one else, whether
they like it or not, shall drink nothing but water;
“We know how doctors disagree, amongst themselves. , Are, the homoeopaths
then to bellow and agitate against the hydropaths? Are the allopaths to raise a
loud cry of grievance because there are a i. class of medical dissenters who dare
to thin ºf ractise differently to themselves?
“Are the believers, also, in certain infallible remedies to be continually waging
Žº
warfare with each other? Are the devotees of MoRIsoN to be perpetually pelting | Fr
with abuse the fanatics who place implicit faith in Hollo-
WAYP ockLE to be incessantly arrayed in arms
against OLD PARR, DR. JAcob Townshend, MR. FRAMP-
toN, and DR. Jongh, each of whom devoutly believes that
he holds in his pocket (money paid in advance) the only
true specific for arresting disease and prolonging human
life? Because DB. Du BARRY can prove in black and white
his ‘50,000,000 Certificated Cures,’ is that a reason why
we should all be compelled under strong penalties to take
for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner, nothing but his Reva-
lenta Arabica? Kind angels, forbid!
“No, the days of prohibition are over, and let there be
Free Trade in eating and drinking as there is in everything
else. Let every one do as he pleases, and if a man is doing
himself an injury, the cure will in time work itself, for
bunishment has a wonderful quick effect in hastening the
hour of correction. Is the Thames to be closed up, ſor-
sooth, because a few unhappy creatures commit suicide, in
it every year? Prevent them if you can, but do not prohibit
me, inasmuch as I do not entertain any particular craying
for shortening my days, from fishing, or rowing or bathin

Kingdom Alliance gentlemen are doubtlessly very good,
worthy, well-meaning gentlemen, but I do not want them
to dictate to me what i am to drink, nor to lay down laws

SUICIDE
O A. YoUNG LADY.
MY DEAR Miss
SMYThe, Of course
you have been to see
the Exhibition—no, I
don’t mean the one
under the Trafalgar
Square twin pepper-
boxes mean the
one which lies beneath
the two big domes
that Fowke built.
And of course you’ve
secn the Koh-i-moor,
and all the other
ducks of diamonds,
and the exquisite lace
shawls, and the beau-
tiful mixed pickle
trophy, and the girl's
hair six feet long, and
the rabbit that beats
a drum, and the little
bird that stirs about
and sings upon a
snuff-box. And be.
sides all these instruc-
tive and wonder-mov-
ing sights, you have
º your mind
- still further by sitting
in the nave, and staring at the swells who keep on walking up and down in it, and who
look as though they ſancied that of all the marvels shown there they were best worth looking
at. And having done, this, and just peeped at the pictures for a bit, and possibly been brave
enough to win some gloves of cousin CHARLEY, by spending, say, six minutes in the smell of
the machinery, having done all this, you fancy you have “dome” the Exhibition, and that
really there is nothing you have left unseen there.
Well, I am sorry to disturb, this notion, and to give you further labour; but have you
ºn the Grecian girdle expressly manufactured for the EMPREss of Austri A.F. No, you’ve
| not? Well then, you'll find it—or at any rate, a facsimile—if you will ask a kind policeman
to present you at the Greek Court, to which he is invested with full power of introduction,
The reason why I ask you to go and see this girdle, is not so much because it is connected
with an Empress (although of course that fact alone must serve to make it vastly interest-
ing), as because it only measures sixteen inches in its length, thereby showing that her
Majesty is the possessor of a waist which my joined thumbs and forefingers easily could
clasp. Now, very possibly her Majesty was born with a small waist, and I will have the
charity to fancy inat she was. Her portrait is exhibited among the foreign pictures, and
one shrinks from speaking harshly of such a pretty creature as, if her artist may be credited,
the Empress certainly must be. So I will assume that her small waist is a natural deformity,
and has not been produced by artificial means. But for fear lest her example set the fashion
for wasp waists (and I know how prone you ladies are to follow any fashion, no matter how
unsightly, which an Empress leads), do i. let me remind you and others of your sex, that
a small waist when produced by artificial means invariably causes a great injury to health.
Tight lacing may indeed be considered as a crime, for i. who wantonly destroy their
health are guilty of slow suicide, inasmuch as by degrees they shorten their own life. And
after all, what beauty is there in a É. waist?, To my eyes it is simply as monstrous
a deformity as the squeezed foot of a Chinawoman, or the § tecth of married ladies in
Japan. If I were a young man, I would no more think of marrying a girl with a wasp waist
than I would make an offer to JULIA PASTRANA, supposing that attractive person came again
to life. I should know that, if my wife had a waist my hands could clasp, the chances are
her doctor's bills would annually increase; and that, to say nothing of the sorrow of having
a sick wife, her small waist would occasion me a very great expense.
Pray then, my dear young lady, do just bear my words in mind; and whenever you see a
girl beginning to wear stays, and to deform herself and kill herself by squeezing in her ribs,
do pray tell her that the smaller she contrives to make her waist, the smaller will her chances
be of getting married; for believe me that in this matter, as well as every other one, all
men of sense will always agree with your friend,
390ANTH}.
TELEGRAMS TO COME.
PARIs.-The prolonged occupation of Rome by our brave troops has terminated in a solution
of the Roman question to be regretted in the interests of Catholicism.
Impatience of the necessity, which withholds their desired Capital has at length prevailed
on the Italians to inquire into the basis of those spiritual pretensions on which is reared the
superstructure of the Pope's temporal sovereignty.
They have accordingly addressed themselves to the study of the New Testament.
They find that there is no such word as Pope in the book. -
Everywhere the populations have renounced their '#;" allegiance to the pºpaſ. Multi-

The people of Italy has proclaimed that it embraces genuine Christianity.
The whole Italian nation, including the
§ºns, has been excommunicated by the
PE.
. The unity of Italy has thus accomplished itself
in a spiritual sense; but our arms, which have
unfortunately achieved that result, will not cease
to perpetuate, for the welfare of Christendom,
and the glory of France, the situation which
caused it, in consequence of which the Sovereign
Pontiff is now a monarch whose subjects are
heretics.
Arrangements have been made, by the despatch
of. large reinforcements, for the permanent esta-
blishment of the Holy Father, under the protec.
tion of French artillery, at Rome as a Pope in

So that slow fable you must drop
That we are taught at school.
But GLAishER’s pluck, and Coxwell's teo,
Is something to admire;
As high as eagle ever flew
Those fellows went, and higher.
One kept on reading at his glass,
Whilst he could see or stand;
The other's teeth let out the gas,
When cold had numbed his hand.
'Tis true that these two men did go
Six miles towards the sky;
But as for IcARus, we know
That story's all my eye.
Then what’s the use to read about
Old heroes' ſabled acts,
When now they’re beaten, out and ont,
By wonders that are facts?
The Height of Humility.
WHAT would CARDINAL WisemaN say to a
converted convict, who had become a saint, and,
in order to exhibit a memorial of his disgrace,
stuck his ticket-of-leave, framed and glazed, over
his mantel-shelf?
Would not his Eminence say that, after the
saint had been canonised, his ticket-of-leave would
make a splendid relic?

-
“A STUPID FRolic.—The Malta Times gives the following account of a cruel prac-
tical joke played off at Rabbots, in the Island of Gozo, by a party of officers of the
garrison. For the amusement of an idle hour they adopted the not very original
expedient of throwing hot copper coins from the windows of the Imperial Hotel, to
be scrambled for by a crowd º:
The pastime above described certainly is one which is neither intel-
lectual nor benevolent. Circumstances, however, alter cases, and a
roceeding, which, practised for amusement, is wanton cruelty, becomes
audable when adopted in self vindication. The eminent mathema-
tician, MR. BABBAGE, is notoriously the subject of continual annoyance
from dirty Italian organ-grinders, who station themselves before, his
house, and, though told to É away, keep on tormenting him with their
noise, to the distraction of his mind, and the interruption and confusion
of his calculations. A º may often derive a hint from fools,
and the next time MR. BABBAGE, finds himself plagued by one of these
rascals, he might advantageously employ the same, expedient to rid
himself of a nuisance as that to which the officers at Malta resorted for
the purpose of killing time. What MR. BABBAGE might do with satis-
factory effect, other gentlemen might be advised to try when molested
by organ-grinding vagrants. It is true that the officers who played the
trick above recorded, and burnt a number of little boys in the hands
and legs, were deservedly fined £5 each by the *...* but an

applied that appellation to us not altogether without reason. We may

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WISE MAN'S WORDS.
... IN a late publication from the pen of CARDINAL WISEMAN, we are
informed that the late QUEEN or NAPLEs, and a certain Neapolitan
beggar-boy named NUNzio Sulprizio, are contemporary candidates for
canonisation. They both died in similar states of sanctity: —
“And so the Queen, and the mendicant, one mass of gangrene, were admitted
together on the same day; and passed in their matriculation for the sublilne degrees
of beatification and canonisation."
This is CARDINAL WISEMAN's own statement; no burlesque.
The mendicant above-mentioned, whilst an inmate of a hospital, ac-
cording to the Cardinal, “contrived to practise all virtues in a heroic
degree on the wretched pallet which he never left.” . All virtues. The
practice of all the virtues, even within the compass of the most spacious
four-poster, would be a sufficient miracle... It would beat any perform-
ance that a Spiritual Blondin could exhibit on the moral tight-rope.
CARDINAL WISEMAN says, further:-
“Now, perhaps the Queen and the pauper, who thus met at the threshold of the
Church's judgment-seat (Prov. xxii. 2), and were admitted together, may continue
to walk on together, and share the honour, one day of a joint canonisation, Perhaps
the lame and bed ridden patient may run quicker in the race, and attain the goal
before his more agile and graceful competitor.”
Upon our honour, upon our circulation, the ſoregoing words are
CARDINAL WISEMAN’s own, and not those of Punch.
THE NAGGLETONS OUT.
A SEA-SIDE DRAMA.
The Scene represents the Breakfast-Table at MR. and MRs. NAGGLE-
TON's lodgings at a J/atering-Place. The distinguished couple at

a “Times” and all the copies had been sold to unknown persons, whou he
therefore hates). What bad tea! f
Mrs. N. There’s coffee.
Mr. N. That’s worse.
Mrs. N. It was not my fault that water didn't boil, I suppose.
Mr. N. No. But I suppose it was your fault for using water that
didn't boil. -
Mrs. N. Do you want to have a fire in the parlour with the thermo.
meter at 70° 2 or do you wish your wife to go down into the kitehem of
a lodging-house, and heat the kettle?
Mr. N. I only wish to have decent tea or coffee.
Mrs. N. You have managed to drink both, such as they are; so if I
were you I would say no more about it. -
Mr. W..I am much obliged for your advice, and should be more
obliged if you would condescend to attend to what I believe is a
woman's department.
Mrs. N. If you had gone to an hotel, you could have had all the
luxuries, the want of which makes you so amiable.
Mr. W. faidn't choose to go to an hotel.
Mrs. N. Then you must take things as you find them.
Mr. N. I have had good breakfasts at the sea-side in other days.
Mrs. N. I am happy to hear it. That makes it all the fairer that you
should sometimes put up with bad ones. Not that the breakfast has
been bad to-day, only your temper. - -
º M. I say it has been bad. The shrimps were anything but
fresh.
Mrs. N. Do you wish me to get up early in the morning, and go out
shrimping?
Mr. N. I certainly wish you would get up early in the morning, as it
is ridiculous to be breakfasting at ten o’clock at the sea-side.
Mrs. N. I don't see why people should come to the sea to make them-
selves uncomfortable.
Mr. N. Nor I; nor why they should make other people so.
Mrs. N. Well, as you are in a sweet humour, I shall take my novel
and go down to the beach and read, and perhaps you’ll be in a happier
frame of mind by lunch-time.
Mr. N. When a novel-ſit is on you, it is useless for me to expect any
attention. If you imitated some of the perſection you are so fond of
reading about, it might not be amiss.
Mrs. N. Very neat, dear, and very new, and very much calculated to
make an impression.

fact). Of course. Any scribbler's sentiments have more weight with
you than your husband's.

for regrets now. But (arrested in the midst of her victory, and angrily)
it’s too early to begin smoking that abominable pipe.
Mr. N. (arailing himself of the enemy's indiscretion). I observe, my
dear, that the names of things vary with the temper of the speakers.
This is a pipe, when you are in a rage, but it is a Meerschaum, when
you are going to fill and light it, preparatory to some little domestic
in anoeuvre.
Mrs. W. A man who deserved to be called a husband would not make
domestic manoeuvres necessary, and a husband who deserved to be called
a man would not reproach a wife with any little display of kindness.
However, such a thing will not occur again.
Mr. N. In that case I shall lose on my fusees, and gain on my
banker's book. Ha! haſ
Mrs. N. You are easily pleased. -
Mr. N. Then you must reproach yourself with not oſtener trying

Mrs. N. I am glad you mention it. I did not see the joke. Such
things are not much in your way. - - -

polite. -
Mrs. N. Oh, there ! I didn't say it. I’m sorry I spoke. I know

make the pleasantest answer that can be made, and looks happiest when
she has done anyone a kind turn.
Mrs. N. And she marries a man who can appreciate those qualities,

Mr. N. Why, she’s as old as you are. Marry again, indeed! How-
ever, as there’s no saying what folly a woman may commit, I make no
doubt that John BLokER has taken care to fortify her weak resolution
by some anti-matrimonial suggestions in his will. Goose as she may be,
she is hardly goose enough to suppose that anybody would think of her
except in connection with his savings. What do you think? (The above

Do you know, Monsieur, what this droll Society does? A number
of persons organise themselves into a league for the purpose of
encouraging one another to drink nothing stronger than tea, and
also of preventing other people from drinking what they please.
This latter *}. which consists with their idea of British freedom,
they seek to effect by procuring laws for the annihilation of the liquor
trade. They would make it criminal to be a wine-merchant, or the
landlord of any but a Temperance hotel. The first of their objects,
mutual, encouragement in abstinence from exhilarating fluids, they
accomplish by ºf declaiming, and ºf to declamations on
the evils arising from the use of fermented, drink, which they enor-
mously exaggerate; also, sometimes, by marchin about in procession,

ginger-beer, soda-water, tea, coffee. Take the pledge; pass it round,

If, indeed, these silly and frantic busybodies cried, “No black

destroyed if the Legislature were so mad as to yield to the noisy
agitation of the impertinent boobies who desire to have a preposterous

day, at Montbrison,
in the department of

called the Forez, pre-
siding at the inaugu:

“So, as the CAMPBELLs

FOREIGN TRAPS FOR ENGLISH FLATS.
IN common with many wise and also, he much fears, with many
foolish people, Mr. Punch is very frequently receiving invitations to
lay out a small portion of his large weekly earnings in the purchase of
a “chance” or a few dozen of “chances” of winning him a prize in
some continental lottery; . This invitation is commonly conveyed in
vastly courteous terms, which seem to keep the word of promise to the
ear, but are . in most cases to break it to the hope. The last of
these polite epistles wherewith Mr. Punch was favoured was phrased
in tempting language thus:–
“Frankfort on the Maine.
“Sir-we take the liberty of enclosing for your perusal a Prospectus of the Great
Brunswick Money Lottery, guaranteed by Government, and we beg to call your
attention to the great advantages offered to investers by this speculation; with such
a small outlay, viz., £1 for a whole share, 5s, for a quarter, you are enabled to win
the highest prizes mentioned in the Prospectus, viz. 100,000 $, 80,000 $, 70,000 $,
68,000$, &c. &c. The first families in England have already invested in this
speculation.”
Have they, indeed? Well, we have no means to negative the state-
ment; excepting just to say that the family of LORD PUNCH have not as
yet subscribed, nor are they likely so to do if his Lordship can prevent
them. As Macbeth says, his Lordship has no such “speculation in his
eyes,” not having any green in them. But besides the strong induce-
ment in the thought of doing that which the first families have done,
the letter under notice further tempts one by asserting that—
“These Prizes will be paid to you [i. e., if you win them] in ready money, through
th ºker in London, Edinburgh, Dublin, or through any other channel you may
preſer.
“The Drawings are performed publicly, under the direction of a Government
Commission appointed for the E. and we assure you that every Shareholder
has a fair and equal chance whether present at the Drawing or not.
“An ‘Official List' bearing the Government Arms will be forwarded immediately
after the Drawing to your own, or any other address you may desire.
“You may rest assured that we will do our utmost to promote your interests, and
promising that the strictest secresy shall be observed,
“We remain, yours, very respectfully,
“Schwin DELMANN UND SPITzBuBE.”
Great must be the comfort even to a loser to have the privilege of
receiving this “official list” of all the winning candidates, with the
is Clan Forez; minus
ich the CAMPBELLs have; for we all know that CAMPBELL is only an alias, as the
celebrated thief Rob Roy might have remarked
when he stated that his foot was now on his
native heath, and his name was MAC GREGoR.
M.DE, PERSIGNY and his fellow clansmen of the
Loire, had better have taken a genuine original
Scotch name, Mac and all; and there is one which
would have just suited them: the most original
name for any clan that could possibly be selected,
and one jº. according with PERSIGNY’s
ideas of blood and pedigree—MAC ADAM.
Rich Muffs, Please Copy.
NATURALISTs have just discovered that the
Glow-worm, feeds on Snails. Some apologetic
sentimentalism is the result of the announcement,
but Mr. Punch (who is a diner-out) sees great
fitness in this arrangement of nature. The slow
folks of society are the proper parties to furnish
dinners for the Brilliant.

names and weights of money to which they are entitled. And great
must be the solace to those who have not won, in seeing the list headed
with the Government Arms, as a surety that no black legs have put
foot in the lottery. In the prospectus which accompanies the letter it
is stated that “the shares are signed by Blank, Director, and Asterisk,
Inspector, and are provided with the Government wº ” (this
doubtless being intended as a synonym for “Arms”). W

them, Mr. Punch will º grant; but he inclines to think the art, is
not of a high character, an
hat these drawings have some art in
not to be compared with the art wherewith
his own artists weekly charm the world. The drawings in his window
are in his eye far superior to those in foreign lotteries, and each
one of his Numbers is a prize, and not a blank. Any one who has spare
money to invest may invest it much more safely in Mr. Punch's drawings
than in those which are described in the prospectus above quoted; and
as gambling is illegal in the eye of º | law, Mr. Punch would
recommend all those who have a taste for drawings, to look for them in
Fleet Street and not Frankfort on the Maine.

reads that MR, Bishop, an Englishman, convicted by an Italian Court of

MR. PUNCH observes, with much satisfaction, that the Report of the
Decimal Committee has been published, and further that the Committee
recommend the Government to prepare the popular mind for the recep-
tion of the Decimal System, These preparations are to be made in
divers ways, the Post-Office is to introduce the system, in the case of
foreign letters and books, and it is to be taught in all schools that
receive Government aid. Moreover, gentlemen who wish to cnter the
service of your country, you must get up the Decimal System, for it is
to be made a feature in your examinations. What do you think of
that? As babies have corals to cut their teeth upon, as debaters in
embryo have their club discussions, and as young Ministers are allowed
to deal with Irish affairs and the like before they are entrusted with
real business, students in Decimals had better go into training, and form
their minds for severer work. By way of helping them, Mr. Punch has
dashed off a few queries of a searching character, which he submits for
the advantage and instruction of his young friends, and if they can
answer, these off-hand, he has good hope that they will distinguish
themselves in the new line about to be opened to them.
QUERIES FOR YOUNG CANDIDATES.
What are Dated Greek º." and describe the ecliptic variety.
What is your idea of the Purbeck Mammalian genus Plagiaulax P
What has become of the Library of MATTHIAs CoRVINUs?
What was the actual and what is the market value of a tetradrachm

Now, send in answers to the above (you may write, print, or litho-
graph the replies, but we will not have them on scented paper), and we
undertake to return private or public certificate, as may be desired, to
the merits of each respondent and his chance of passing an examination in
the Decimal System.
PRIZES FOR WIRTUOUS PEASANTS.
TheRE is something to be said for LoRD, John MANNERs's opinion
that the practice of rewarding agricultural, servants with the prizes
distributed at the meetings of Farmers’ Clubs is not “one that is
more honoured in the breach than in the observance.” There is some-
thing dramatic and picturesque in the distribution of prizes to, a meri-
torious and happy peasantry. That is, at least, there would be if it
were arranged to take place with proper scenery, dresses, and decora;
tions; .. old and young, in holiday attire, and the lads and
lasses suitably trimmed with ribbons. Moreover, the prizes should be
sufficiently elegant. Corduroy trousers are not the sort of donation
that lords, and 'squires, and wealthy farmers, patrons of a rural festival,
should present to successful shepherds and º ploughmen... A
flowered dimity waistcoat would be the right kind of thing; and to this
might be added a pair of white ditto smalls, blue ribbed cotton stockings
and glazed pumps.
The American Appeal.
THE weather is warm and cool things are welcome. But perhaps
there is an excess of coolness in the latest, proposition from the
Federals. They ask that England, France, and Russia shall mediate
“upon the basis of the submission of the South and its return to the
Union.” That is they, unable to “whip” the South, , want, the
European powers to obtain for the North what it cannot get by fighting.
Yes, this is Refrigeration in ercelsis—may, MR. GLAISHER, six miles
aloft was not so cool as the American petition.
ExTREMELY FRIvolous.-We have no . for the art-critic who,
being shown the beautiful figure of a black girl by SIGNOR Monti,
called it a Monti-negro.

ALARM AT SCARBOROUGH.
ScARBOROUGH has been more than usually lively this season on
account of several sharks having recently visited the coast. They pro-
duced the greatest commotion in the water, especially amongst the
bathers, who became particularly animated at their approach, though it
was noticed that but very few evinced a buoyant alacrity to enter upon
closer terms of intimacy with their new marine acquaintances. There
was a shyness and backwardness rarely displayed at the sea-side, where
everybody is so ready to swear “eternal friendship” on the spot, after
seeing each other for the first time.
The general feeling seemed to be an extreme coolness, approaching to
an unmistakeable empressement to get out of their way as much as pos-
sible, though in other respects the new visitors had no reason to complain,
for if they had been royal º: they could not have been more
stared at, or scrutinised like wild beasts, than they were. It is said that
the shortness of their visit was owing to their having accidentally caught
a glimpse of several of the lodging-house keepers of the place. They
instantly retired, modestly feeling after one glance that it would be
utterly impossible for them to get a living amongst the natives, so long
as they were exposed to such fierce competition. This discernment does
º . credit, proving them to be regular, old, sea-going monsters
of the deep.
The º: of these same voracious lodging-house keepers have
acquired now such a degree of wide-spread notoriety for the Queen of
Watering-Places, that there is a strongly-expressed desire, out of
compliment to their taking and toothsome ways, to change the name of
the town to SHARKsBoRough.

why BlonDIN left America?—Because he felt that Europe wanted
BLONDIN, and that he, also, wanted a new rope.
WOL. XLIII.
CURRANT NOTIONS OF BEAUTY.
IN Colonel ToRRENs' Travels in Kashmir, &c., we read that, when
they had arrived at a place called Lé, they ,
“Saw that the faces of the Ladák women were smeared with a sort of black glu-
tinous varnish. not unlike currant jelly, and the writer inclines to believe that it is
done, against their inclination, to mitigate the fascination of their charms, in the
interests of their susceptible spouses.”
We know that in England it is the custom to take currant jelly with
venison, so with the like reasoning a Kashmir swell may fancy that
currant jelly may also have the effect of improving one’s “dear.” W
dare say that the ladies in England, who smear their faces with “the
dews of Sahara,” and other abominable washes, do it with a similar
benevolent object, and “against their inclination.” It’s smearly done
“to mitigate the fascination of their charms.” It must be laid on with
this view, for it certainly does not enhance them. The motive clearly
is to prevent their “susceptible spouses” falling too desperately in love
with them. By the bye, the process must require constant renewing:
for, as the enamel gets hardened, and is liable to chip, and star, and
splinter, the Porcelained One would certainly, in one sense, be pointed
out in society as “a crack beauty,” and the * susceptible spouse.”
would, consequently, become more fascinated than ever. However, it
is the first time, we have ever heard of husbands complaining of
their wives being too pretty.
The Reverses of the Northerners.
It seems that all the regiments of the French army now include pho-
tographers and telegraphs. So, we believe, do the Unionists' regiments,
though they do not appear to have done them much good. Certainly the
photographers have not yet succeeded in taking the South, and as for the
telegraphs, they were completely useless, inasmuch as they never told
the truth. The photographic apparatus would have done the work of
the latter much more naturally and efficiently, if, for all the telegraphic
reports of victories that were dispatched, they had simply forwarded to
Washington so many negatives.

IMPERIAL ROME.
TUPID. M. DE LA GuéRoNNIERE, writing in the new Parisian º
La France, makes the very great mistake of stating that the unity o
Italy is impossible, because:-
“It would introduce serious perturbation in European order and the national
power of France, who would be compelled to demand compensation from Italy and
to change established territorial limits, in order to guarantee herself against several
powerful neighbours.”
In these words M. Dº I.A. GuérºnnièRE has either uttered a mis:
chievous fiction, or he has, as indiscreetly as fortunately, let the cat
out of the bag. Whichever of these things he has done, he has com;
mitted an enormous blunder. The pen of this gentleman, is suppose
to express the mind of the EMPREss of THE FRENch. If it does, it
has been the instrument of betraying her husband's secrets, in revealing
the treachery which she is trying to get him to commit. We, of course,
suppose that it expresses nothing but the impertinent conceptions of
M. DE LA GUfRONNIERE. -
The name of the EMPREss of THE FRENCH is taken too much in
vain. The following inconsiderate statement about that illustrious
lady appeared the other day in the Tablet:-
“When the Manchess Perout made his visit to the Imperial Court the other day
§ on his bootless errand, he found himself in conversation with Her Majesty the
Empasss-Eugénie, who said, ‘I do not understand or like the policy of your º
M. le Marquis, I prefer GARIBALDI's policy to yours, for he names his object an
makes straight at it. Then, his cry is ours too. “Roma o morte” is our cry as well
as Gasunaudi’s.’
“The Marchese was uncomfortable. The conversation was taking a turn that
was anything but pleasant to him, and as gracefully and quietly as possible he edged
himself away, but not before the EMPREss had repeated her Imperial mot-' Rome
or death, Marquis. That is our cry as well as GARIBALDr’s.”
The Tablet is lucky in not being a French newspaper. What would
Napoleos have said to the Monde if it had made the mistake of pub-
lishing the above-quoted story?... “Rome or death, Marquis!” hat
a speech to put into the mouth of EugéNIE after the attempt of ORsNI'
Of course the EMPREssor THE FRENgh never said anything so foolish.
Her Imperial Majesty is much more likely to have exclaimed “Crinoline
or Cremation!” in answer to some remonstrance against absolutism
in that petticoat government, which occupies her whole attention, and
affords her rulius abilities such ample scope.
DISRAELI'S DEXTERITY.
IN the after-dinner address, delivered the other day by MR. Disraeli
to the squires and farmers at Buckingham, occurs the ensuing
remark:—
“The tenant farmer does not think it an indignity to gain the silver cup for the
best crop of roots; and I do not understand on what principle the labouring class
is supposed to be insensible to that spirit of emulation which is the origin and
foundation of everything that is excellent in man.”
, Whatever may be thought of the practice of allotting agricultural
| labourers petty rewards for long and faithful services, a slight objection
may be taken against the foregoing apology for it. Is the spirit of
emulation really the origin and foundation ofeverything that is excellent
in man? Does not something of human excellence arise from the love
of good? Is there not such a feeling as the sense of duty which con-
stitutes the foundation of some of those things which are excellent in
man?, Has MR. DisPAELI no idea of it?
In the above-quoted specimen of the eloquence of the Conservative
Leader of the House of Commons, we may however notice, with due
}. the dexterity with which an anticlimax is avoided. “ The tenant
farmer,” observes the Member for, Bucks, “does not, think it an
indignity to gain the silver cup; and,” he continues, “I do not see on
what principle the labouring class is, insensible to that spirit of emu-
lation which is the foundation, of all that is, excellent in man.”. A
speaker less practised in the oratory of humbug-would, with a fatal
simplicity, have "...; “I
labouring classis insensible to the value of a pair of corduroy breeches.”
CURIOUS CAB-COINCIDENCE.
May difference of opinion never alter friendship. This novel sentiment
is extracted from Mr. Punch by his observing in the same newspaper
first, that the Cabmen have held a meeting at which they have agree
that the Badge shall be done away; and secondly, that SIR, Richard
MAYNE has, issued an order notifying that the wearing the Badge
conspicuously on the breast is too much neglected, and that, the police
are to pull up any driver not displaying that ornament., Perhaps the
belligerents will come to some compromise. Couldn’t, the cabman be
relieved from wearing his number on his breast, and have it, worked.
very large, on his back instead, where he could not very well see it?
Any reasonable concession should always be made; but this, we think,
is as far as the public would willingly see SIR RICHARD go.
A RAMPANT IDOLATER.
AN old maniac at Turin, the other day, in the midst of a religious
festival, astonished the multitude by rushing upon a statue of the
Virgin and Child with a hatchet and hacking and hewing it to pieces.
Of course he was instantly cut down by a faithful dragoon, but, having
luckily not been killed, turned out to be not a Protestant iconoclast,
but a Roman Catholic simpleton, who had gone mad. This unhappy
fool had been for a long time praying to the idol above-mentioned for a
terno secco, or three lucky lottery-numbers, and at last got them, on
a scrap of paper, said to have been affixed to the drapery of the shrine
at the feet of the image. The terno secco turned out, a blank, every
number, instead of a prize; whereupon the infuriated, fanatic, jºi
quite frantic, vowed vengeance against his deceitful fetish, attack
tried to demolish it in the manner above described.
This story will really be a good case for the Spiritual Magazine. How
did the delusive lottery-number get to be stuck on the image? BARON
GULDENstuBBé—no relation of Baron Munchausen—is asserted to have
obtained written answers to questions on pieces of paper placed on the
statues of deceased persons. Very i. he did, if any wag, of his
acquaintance happened to be aware of his necromantic practices. The
allocation of the lottery-numbers, may as easily be accounted for on the
same supposition. Otherwise the lie which some hand unseen had
affixed to the Madonna's curtain must be, considered to rest between
the priests and a tricksy spirit—too probably distinguished by horns
o not see on what principle the and tail.
A DISAPPOINTMENT.
It was thought that at length there was a change in the American
telegrams, and that we were going to hear of a Federal success. The
wire brought the following words:--
“General M'Clellan has taken—”
Then came a hitch, but the spirits of the friends of the North went up,
and the Morning Siar, began a,beautiful article of triumph. At last
the wire got right again, and adde
“The Field / .”
Whereat the Morning Star put its beautiful article into its pocket until
further notice. However, things might, have been much worse, for
though we did not *. the º (and ill-used). M'CLELLAN to take

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BULL-FIGHT AT BAYONNE.
MR. PUNCH, happening to be at Bayonne the other day, took the
opportunity then afforded him of witnessing a bull-fight, which came off
in the presence of the EMPEROR and EMPRESS OF THE Fiesch. . If he
had known that he was going to see a cruel, and filthy exhibition, he
would still have gone, not for amusement, but for instruction, as he
oes into the slums, to study human nature, and as surgeons walk the
É.i. and cultivate morbid anatomy. But Mr. Punch, superior to
prejudice, considered that the common English notion of a bull-fight
must be quite a mistake, or that spectacle would never receive the
countenance of the representatives of a people which esteems itself to
be at the head of civilisation. - - - -
The bullfights at Bayonne take place in a circus similar to that in
which the British Public contemplates performances of horsemanship,
gymnastics, and buffoonery...The shadyside of the amphitheatre is the
fashionable one—in the torrid season. Thereon stood the imperial box
fitted up with crimson velvet and gold; thereon also, of course, sat Mr.
Punch, who wanted to have a near view of their imperial Majesties
and not to be broiled.
The performance commenced with the entrance of the Toréadors, or
whole company of the establishment, horse and foot, who advanced across
the ring; and then knelt to the EMPREss, or saluted her. Are Eugenia
Imperatria, morifuri te salutant certainly was rather more than their
salutation meant; still, inasmuch as the Spanish bull-fighter rums some
risk of the fate of the Roman gladiator (fourteen Toréadors have been
killed during the present season), EL-TATorgets £300 for his day’s
work, and CALDERON, the principal Pieador, £200. Qur Toréadors
were all of them prettily attired in-gold-laced velvet, like so many
ballet-dancers, save that the Picadors, or equestrian spearmen, wore
iron boots cased with wash-leather, which gave their lower extremities
the look of being affected with dropsy or elephantiasis. Their feet were,
in addition, protected by large iron stirrups. Therest had on pink silk
*f; and shiny pumps.
Her Imperial Majesty tossed a key to one of these male coryphées,
which it picked up and danced off with. A few moments elapsed, and
enter the bull. #: was two-and-a-half years old, had been bred on
purpose for fighting, and was quite wild....As he entered, a Picador
stuck a dart into the nape of his neck. They weapon was tastefully
decorated with a white satin rosette, intended to make the bull smart
and also look pretty, as he kicked and plunged. "He was then gently
excited by the Banderilleros, flourishing their scarfsini his face; they,
when the bull made at them with his horns, effecting their escape by
vaulting over the inclosure of the arena with elegant agility.
The task of tickling up the bull; a little more seriously was now
undertaken by two Picadors who alternately attracted his attention,
and each of whom, when the bull rushed on him, turned him from his
horse with the point of his spear, inflicting several severe wounds on his
head and shoulders, which the bull took in very ill Fº roaring, snort-
ing, and stamping furiously, to the delight of the beholders. One
unlucky Picador, however, had the misfortune to incur their indignation
by not at once shortening his lance so as to allow his horse to be gored.
#. yelled, screamed, whooped, and shouted “Coward l’” “Willain!”
*Šćoundreit * blew catcails and in trumpets, and made all manner of
noise expressive of frantic displeasure. So the Picador complied with
their demand; shortened his weapon to three feet, and with his steed,
was consequently rolled over by the bull. The rider was uninjured; the
horse rose with blood spouting from his chest and side; fit for .#
but dogs’ meat. This was enough for one bout. A trumpet sounded,
and in tripped the Banderilleros. They confronted the now infuriated
bull, with great, spirit, dancing about him very prettily, whilst they
stuck into his body as into a fancy pincushion, some eight or nine
barbed darts, ornamented with coloured papers so as to resemble large
bonbons, The tortured beast tried to rid himself of these truly piquant
decorations in vain, and sued the Toréadors, that is to say, the
whole lot of miscreamts who were engaged in tormenting him. In-
#. authority deeming that he had now been tortured enough, and
ad better be put out of his misery, the trumpet again sounded, and
in came EL-TAto the chief, and popular Matador, to perform that act of
mercy. This artist, a well m e, handsome man, with calves that a
London footman would º dressed in a purple jacket braided
with gold, and breeches which were mauve behind and gold laced
before. He was armed" with a sword, and carried a red in
ja º Hºttº ºil i.e., "h"ºf
hair gathered up in a knot behind, like that of a female. He also
danced before the bull, and dodged him with extreme activity; on one
occasion, when the buil stopped short, taking the opportunity to strike
an attitude, and stand with a coquettish tenure of his scarf in relation
to the bull. This pose drew down thunders of applause, which were
repeated when he sat down on the ledge of the arena facing the bull,
and kissed his hand to him. After some further capering, he proceeded
to business, and made an unsuccessful blow at the bull; but his second
thrust was a home one. He stuck his victim over the left shoulder
apparently through the heart. The animal fell dead. Three horses
decorated with flags, and harnessed to a long bar, were then galloped
in, and the bleeding, quivering carcase, attached by its head to the bar
was dragged twice round the arena, and then out. ELTAto, with his
blood-bºdraggled flag and blood-stained sword, then knelt to their
Imperial Majesties, and the spectators shouted their applause. So
ended the First Part of this º entertainment, of which |. witnesses
in great measure consisted of the most fashionably attired ladies, in
addition to the Authoress of Crinoline. One of them threw her fan
into the ring as a testimonial of her approbation of EL-TAto.
..The Second Part was a repetition of the first, with additional atro-
cities. To enhance the gratification afforded by the spectacle, the
mangled horses were again ridden in, until one of them fell from mere
wounds, and was then kicked off. The second Espada who came to
kill the bull after the torture inflicted by the Banderilleros, was a muff.
He made five or six ineffectual stabs, inflicting a wound each time,
Imtil the poor beast streamed with blood. i. cries were raised for
ELTAtoto give the Cachete or coup de grâce; but professional etiquette
prevented him from obeying them. At last the bull, exhausted by
bleeding, fell, and, yells of disapprobation greeting the clumsy slaughter,
one of the Toréadors thrust a short dagger into his medulla oblongata,
and killed him. . .
Part the Third differed from the others only in the circumstance that
one of the Picadors, more miserably mounted than the rest, walked his
horse, a poor white beast, which seemed resigned to its fate, delibe-
rately up to the bull to be gored. Streaming with blood from its lace.
rated chest and side, this horse was led in front of the Imperial box,
and could scarcely stagger from the arena.
During Part Two, El-TATo cut a caper too much. His foot slipped—
as well it might—and he was within an ace of being gored. Other Toréa-
dors, however, diverted the bull’s attention, and debarred the ingress of
daylight into EL-TAto's interior. Another less satisfactory bull would
not show fight, and the spectators howled and shouted Otro toro /
mad as demons.
Mr. Punch went away at the end of Part Three. He had seen as much
as he could stand. The results of the day's sport were, he understands,
i. *sed bulls and seven gored horses; but no injury to any human
rute.
If anybody wants to see a bull killed, Mr. Punch recommends him to
go to a regular slaughter-house, where he will at any rate witness the
slaughter of an ox, if the butcher does not happen to deal in bull-beef.
The stalwart exercise of the poll-axe, and the happy despatch of the
victim will please him more than the stiletto practice of embroidered
ancing-men. ... As to the horses, whose death and torture are as essen-
tial as the bull's, they are by no means the fiery steeds they have been
represented. There would be no harm in simply killing them, if they
were only taken to the knacker's at once. -
Justice requires Mr. Punch to observe that the beastly spectacle
which he has above described did not appear to be much relished by the
purely French part of the spectators. It was the Spanish, and the
mongrel Spaniards, chiefly, who howled like fiends and gloated on the
torment and the blood. So their ancestors revelled in the spectacle of
heretics burning alive in their robes of mockery painted with devils and
flames. Their descendants cannot carry their faith to the extent of an
auto-da-fé, they can only show forth its fruits in the zest with which
they gaze on the pangs of quadrupeds inflicted by bedizened effeminate
varlets, who stand a good chance of being slain themselves. They are
what their priests have made them.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO POPES.
THERE is an American Pope, and a Roman Pope. The one is always
retreating, and the other, persuade one ever so charmingly, cannot be
made to see the advantages of a foreign retreat. Now, if these two
Popes could only be induced to change places, how invaluable they
would be ' What the Americans particularly want is a Pope that won’t
retreat, and what the Romans are above all things anxious for, is a
Pope that will run away. Each Pope would then be exactly the
Right Pope in the Right Place.
One Pope decamps with loss of bag—
A precious prize for Southern scoffers!
Another Pope delights to lag, . . -
And spurns the sack which friendship offers.

OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
WHEN OVID sang–
“Intactae fueratis aves solatia ruris,”
he may have been a sincere admirer of Nature's charms, but was cer-
tainly no sportsman. It is in quite another sense that winged creation
becomes a solace to the Cockneys who can manage to §: º from
desks and counting-house at this season of the year. . Nor is that the
only source of pleasure open to him. Many coves who have no eye for a
covey—many gentlemen who decline to carry a #". have no objection
to handling a rod—and for those who prefer to ſet others provide their
trout and partridges are there not bathing machines at Brighton,
Dawlish, Ryde, Llandudno, and a host of other “acres by the sea?”
But the unhappy Londoner who can't leave town—a miserable wretch
who passes under Temple Bar like the captive beneath his yoke every
morning at 10 A.M.–what is his “solatium ?”
The pleasures of Cremorne are brief and hollow. If you dined at
Greenwich every day (I address those whose income is under ten
thousand a year) you would soon have nothing left to § for breakfasts.
You know the American Cousin by heart, and the Clubs are empty and
cheerless. One comfort alone remains–
You WILL FIND ROOM AT THE EXHIBITION ON SATURDAYS.
I speak from experience, having just come back from Arcadia—sheep,
shepherdesses, Pan, and piping with infinite regret, and this is really the
only fact which has at all reconciled me to my return.
What a difference a few weeks will make in many matters—the growth
of one's moustache for instance,—the length of MR. BUTCHER's bill,
the warmth of CHLoe's letters. A month ago one scarce had elbow room
in Kensington, but now on “half-crown” days the World's Fair seems
half deserted. An air of listless languor pervades the place. Where is
the bustling crowd that once assembled in the Eastern Dome? MIN-
ToN’s great fountain—once the rendezvous of countless swells—now
drips lazily down before a few idlers. Our patron-saint George at the
top there, as depressed in his spirits as he is elevated in positio .
* spearing his dragon for four months, feels in his turn a little bor

I have two official catalogues with me, which I carry resolutely about
under my arm, just because I have done so on previous occasions, an
because every one does so—not because I ever found them of the
slightest use. I want to see the Reading Girl, the “Skull of Con-
fucius,” the antediluvian, exhumed and immortal Frog, an I can get no
information concerning those objects of interest. I wander carelessly
through the building in the hope that something may turn up to look at,
and come upon a sort of ogre in effigy, suggesting a partial metamor-
phose of MR. PAUL, BEDFORD into a young light-house. It is a French
diving dress for which a medal was awarded to M. GABIROL of Paris.
With heavy leaden boot-soles and a huge lump of the same material
hanging round his neck, the wonder is, not that the gentleman who
Wears i. costume can reach the bottom of the ocean, but that he can
ever rise to its surface again.
In Peru there is a large diagram representing a series of portraits of
the Incas, as for instance, #º. NGA THE SEVENTH and
WIRAcochA YNGA THE EIGHTH, which have evidently escaped the notice
of MR. ToM TAYLOR and other Art-critics. In the features of these illus.
trious swells one is struck by an extraordinary family likeness, which is
all the more notable from their general and striking resemblance to
court cards.

of Brobdingmag reels of cotton and roofed like a Swiss cottage? It is a

P. I could ask is Miss ARRowsMITH BUTLER, a friend of mine who

Would that I were scientific enough to describe the various machines
which I saw. The thrashing machine—invaluable to Papas and peda-
gogues. The washing-machine, which “gets up”, your shirt fronts
with such rapidity and so well that it will probably be known as the

“Bachelors' bosom friend.” Then there is the celebrated chaff-cutter,
warranted to protect its owner against the insolence of London cabbies
and bargemen on the Thames: the mowing-machine, from which the
patentee expects to reap a profit: the portable locomotive which first
carries you, and then may be carried itself: the corn-crusher for refrac-
tory, old gentlemen, and the creaming machine from Denmark, interesting
to philanthropists because it enriches the pure milk of human kindness
before it degenerates into the “butter” of artificial life, or becomes the
cheese in fashionable society.
If the above is not quite an accurate description of the ingenious
contrivances aforementioned, I beg leave again to observe that I am
not a scientific man and really in the Machinery Annexe, what with the
burr of wheels, the busing of visitors and the plashing of water, I had
but a vague idea of what was going on around me. There are those for
whom the great centrifugal pump has more charms than the Majolica

PEOPLE fond of puzzles may derive some entertainment from a
glance at this advertisement:-
A LADY, Residing in a Small Cottage in a pretty village, fifteen miles
from town, containing four good rooms, with servant's room, kitchen, two
| capital cellars, and small garden, and partly furnished, to be TAKEN for four
months at 20s. per week.-Address.
It has been said that language was invented to conceal one's thoughts.
and certainly this notice is somewhat of an instance of it. Only see in
what a labyrinth of words this lady hides what she has doubtless in her
mind to say, and how difficult it is for ong to find a clue to it, . Pray,
Ma'am, is it the “small cottage,” or the “pretty village,” which you
say is partly furnished, and contains a capital cellar as well as a small
garden, in addition to a kitchen and some half a dozen rooms? A
garden in a house is somewhat of a novelty, and invalids who can't go
out of doors might find some comfort in it. But far more puzzling
than this is the problem as to who or what is to be “taken for four
months at 20s, a week.” This momentous question we have, vainly
tried to solve, and we now leave it to our readers to think about as
much or as little as they like.

at such a thing is perfectly possible, by relating a fact
which has occurred º my own family, and, I may say,
under my own eye.
“The nights have been cold of late, and on Tuesday last
I thought it would be pleasant to have a fire. This was
accordingly lighted, and my servant, a most respectable
female (dily christened, and with an excellent character),
brought up the coal-skuttle. It had remained in an out-
house during the summer. She placed it in one corner of
my room, behind my arm-chair. About an hour afterwards
I rose to put on some coals, and I beheld, perched upon a
large lump of Wallsend, a remarkably fine Frog. . It was
alive, and did not seem afraid of me, and, indeed, I fancied
that it winked at me as I approached it. If there could be
any doubt that this frog had been in one of the coals for
six thousand years at least (my servant thinks “nearer
seven”), such doubt would be removed by the creature's
fearlessness. . It was, of course, in the poet's language,
‘so unacquainted with man,’, upon whom it had never
looked since this orb was called into existence. -
“I would have stated this convincing circumstance in
addition to the similar evidence which I transmitted to the
Times, only it had not occurred when I wrote, ... I hasten

A LAWYER IN A PUZZLE.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“I AM a º: Barrister. You are popularly supposed to
know everything, and I, beg to apply to you for information upon a
subject which has recently forced itself upon my notice.
“Let me premise that I intend (clients ...) to practise very
largely before the Criminal tribunals of our justly beloved country.
“I am therefore interested in asking you to answer the following
question, *: :—
“When do the duties of an Advocate to his client end, cease, and
determine?
. “By way of explaining myself, I would say that I have recently read
in the newspapers, the reports of certain trials which have ende
unfavourably for the accused. Not to put too fine a point upon it, the
latter have been sentenced to be removed from this mundane sphere.
Previously to this, of course, their counsel exerted themselves to the
utmost for the defence, and all arguments having been, exhausted, the
udge and the jury were left to deal with the cases. I should naturally
aye supposed that the barrister's work was then complete.
“But it appears that the Fee to Counsel is held to bind him to do a
great deal more. , Paragraphs (which I am far from saying are likely to
injure the learned gentlemen who are their subjects, on the contrary,
may tend to procure them other . have been issued, stating
that the Counsel for the defence have attacked the Home Secretary, in
the interest of their convicted clients. In one case, indeed, a Barrister
whose exertions in this court of appeal were not noticed, actually wrote
to the papers respectfully soliciting the attention of the public to the
fact that he had been quite as zealous as the other Barrister whose
doings had the good fortune to be recorded. The results were not
exactly alike, for in one case the person who had been sentenced was
let off by the Home Secretary with transportation for the rest of his
earthly career, while in the other case, a very large assemblage of wit-
nesses beheld an opposite result.
“Now, Sir, I need hardly remark that I have nothing to say upon
the question of such punishments, or upon the merits of the special
cases. . But, as a young barrister, fdo want to know whether it is con-
sidered by the profession that a barrister is bound to do anything more
for his client than is to be done in the face of the Court. Because, Sir,
if it be so, I flatter myself that I have a good many advantages which
will make me highly serviceable to any otherwise unfortunate party
who may employme, and may be convicted.
“I have got money, and therefore I can easily get into Parliament.
It must be admitted, Sir, without in the slightest degree impugning the
high principle and strict justice of a Minister, that it is not in human
nature that the representations of a lawyer who can make a good speech
against him, and give a vote against him (which in ticklish times may be
critical), should not have more influence than the voice of a nobody. If
there is a doubt in the case, I think you will allow, Sir, that the most
honest man is more inclined to give it a weight, when it is urged by a
valued and powerful friend than when put by somebody one knows and
cares nothing about. If I myself had the misfortune to º into a scrape
I should certainly desire my attorney to retain an M.P. who could
not only make a speech for me in Court, but in the House of Commons
and elsewhere.
“Then, Sir, I have a very persuasive manner and a very sympathetic
voice, and if the Minister of the day happened to be an impressionable
º: (and we have seen such), I flatter myself that I could work upon
is feelings of pity or terror in a very remarkable degree. I could draw
a most agonising picture of the temptations of my client, and the sorrows
of his family, or I could saturate the Minister's mind with the essence
of a perpetual night-mare, to sit upon him in case he should not lean to
mercy.
“Well, Sir, these and other advantages, to which Ineed not now more
particularly refer, will be at the service of my clients, if I can satisfy
myself that it is my business to employ any other influence in their
ſavour than such as is derived from the arguments I should offer in
Court. Upon this point I demand your opinion.
“One thing is certain, namely, that the criminal is very lucky who
obtains the services of barristers inclined to follow up his case, inas-

much as he gets a new and excellent chance of escape. And another
thing is certain, namely, that the criminal is very ucky, whose
attorney does not provide him with such zealous friends, but confides
his defence to an old-fashioned lawyer, who believes that when he has
done his utmost to get his client's case successfully through the machine
of !. he has earned his fee. But these considerations are beside
the mark. -

water-cure, and the best of way for taking it is certainly a yacht.
But then, mind, you must go prepared to rough it, and to bear a ready
hand in whatever work's aboard, and not to sprawl about and smoke
and serenely play the swell. I have seen men wear gloves and dress
for dinner when out yachting, and I have pitied such poor simpletons,
and wished them safe on shore. Fellows proud of their white hands,
and afraid to soil their fingers by the touch of a tarred rope, had better
stick to steamboats when they go to sea, for a º: trip can bring
but very little pleasure to them. Why, half the pleasure of a cruise
consists in living, free from cramping shoregoing restraints. It is the
utter change of life you can enjoy on board a yacht that does your
mind and muscle goºd, and so soon makes a new man of you. Cooking
your own meals will give an added relish for them, and if you help to
scrub the deck and do the other sailor-work, you won't complain, as some
do, that—aw—there’s nothing for a fella—aw—to do on board a boat,
and you’ll find you'll sleep more soundly wrapped up in a blanket with
a spare sail for a pillow than you do on your luxurious spring mattress
when at home. There are no organs at sea, and no street-cries to
worry you, and you are out of reach of creditors, and not have
our breakfast spoiled by seeing in the Times that the girl you love
as married that beast Moneybagge after all, or that the senseless
British public has given further proof of its besotted imbecility by
refusing to see more than the first scene of your new play.
“I see you frown, my Punch, and screw your lips up ominously; but
no, I’m not going to spin you a tremendously long yarn, and to
weary you and worry you with full details of our cruise. Yours is not a

across the English Channel four times in a week (a thing which has, I
fancy, not been done by many yachtsmen), and that in one of these four
trips I assisted in the capture of a Portuguese Man-of-War. As our
craft was but a cutter of three-and-twenty tons, and the only gun we
garried was a single-barrelled fowling-piece, there may be some ground
for wonder as to how this latter exploit was achieved; and when I
explain that the capture was effected with a bucket and a boat-hook, I
fear the explanation will serve little to diminish the surprise I may
have caused. Fact is fact, however, and I have witnesses to prove the
truth as I have stated it. Only I should add, before the Government
of Portugal seek reparation for the loss they think their navy has sus-
tained, they should ask of some sea-naturalist the meaning of Physalia,
which I believe to be a synonym for Portuguese Man-of-War.
“Another novel circumstance connected with our cruise was that,
having carefully left all our charts at home, the only one we had to
steer by was the railway map of Bradshaw. By this we shaped our
course from Dover to *::::::: and from Shoreham to Dieppe, and
had no more trouble in making both those ports, than has a wine
merchant in making with Marsala “nutty” sherries. As the fine old
song might say, but doesn’t:—
“Bradshaw was our only Guide,
Across the swelling Channel Sea,
It told us even the time of tide,
And saved us many a pilot's fee.”
"Travellers complain of Bradshaw, and sayit sadly puzzles them; but
wif as a yachtsman I am sure that I have every reason to speak
well of it, and would say that its directions are remarkably plain-sailing
ones. j by Bradshaw is a novel sort of notion, but, now it has
been mentioned, its very novelty will doubtless serve to make it fashion-
able, and ere long SOme W. yachtsman will no doubt be heard
|asserting that—
“I fear not but safely I'll sail to the shore,
I’ve a Bradshaw to steer by, and what need I more?”
“Being shut up in a prison with the chance of being drowned may
possibly to some Johnsonian-minded people not appear a * pleasant
way to spend a fortnight's holiday. But we are not all DR. Johnsons,

Sie donee they put their feet on shore again, of course can't much
appreciate the pleasures of a cruise, nor should I much desire to
have, them for my shipmates. ... But to those who can enjoy it, a
month's cruise in a yacht is a delightful way of º; and though
you can’t well sail through Switzerland, or get º Mont Blanc by water,
there are other foreign parts quite worth going by sea to see. There’s
nothing like a breeze at sea to blow the smoke of London out of one:
and, in cruising about watering-places full of insect life, a yacht has
this advantage, that you take your own bed with you.

Stereoscopic Company. They have taken photographs, capital ones, of
all that is worth seeing in Fowkeria, and you can just buy these and a

OUR SPECIAL AT BRIGHTON.
“My DEAR MR. PUNCH,
- “I, LIKE the excellent HARBEN of Haverstock Hill, have becn
frying experiments with Weeds on the sea-shore. The result has not
been satisfactory, except in the case of those which I surreptitiously
obtained from your ivory box (which I don't at all believe to be ivory—
the world is a Sham) and brought down in my cigar-case. do not
know whether these will answer as substitute for cotton, but as I spoiled
my lunch by smoking too many, I may say that they replaced a usually
capital twist.
“The alchemists did not find out how to make gold, but their experi-
ments helped them to many more useful discoveries. I do not know
that I have invented anything here, except excuses for not coming back
to my work (as rather pointedly invited by yourself to do), but I have
ascertained a good many facts º Brighton, and they are entirely at
your service. Lodgings, I beg pardon, Apartments, are being let at
rates which argue that the owners think well of their residences, though
I believe that, as, a rule departing sojourners are not lavish in the
expression of similar opinions. But you can be very comfortably housed
in Brighton, if you like to pay about three times as much for a couple
of rooms as you pay for your entire house in London, and so far as my
own experience goes, I find that, content, with this grand plunder, your
hostess lets your cognac and cold shoulder alone. I think, too, that
living in the vicinity of London has tended to soften the manners of the
natives. At Hastings, and other distant places, you are robbed with a
savage surliness, and in everything, from rent down to cigar-fusees, but
here, though you sit, no doubt, at a rack-rent, it is taken with a smile,
and I have even found on my mantel-piece in the morning the same
Ilumber of weeds I left there over-night. Perhaps they were supposed
to be Brighton ones.
“My chief resort—the weather has been lovely (which I am happy
to say that few of my friends who insulted me with their preparations
for Sveaborg, Switzerland, and Sicily, report as their experience)—has
been the shingles in front of the Bedford Hotel, whence indeed I ought
to have dated, but for circumstances—but I do not reproach you. Here
is the great crowd all day, for it is here that the ladies chiefly bathe,
and in addition to the hundreds of nursemaids and thousands of children
who congregate, the male population of Brighton, especially the younger
portion, regularly and faithfully assemble, in order to be ready to lend
manly aid in rescuing any virtuous female who may be carried out to
sea by the tempestuous billows of a proverbially dangerous shore. The
untiring tenacity with which these brave gentlemen keep watch at this
point reveals united Fº: delicacy of character. But this is not
the only attraction of the Bedford plateau. I descend from the dusty
Parade, plunge through the shingle, and in a careless but unavoidably
graceful attitude ſling myself ãº in the shadow of one of the
numerous row-boats, the Here We Are, or the Jolly Larks, or the Too
Poor Feet, or some other of the playſully christened fleet, built, like the
pirate vessels of old, for plundering London Adventurers. Little thinks
that noisy crowd who is in its midst, Little think those three lovely

side jacket, each with her raven or auburn locks drying in the wind,
that yon intellectual face under the semi-pumpkin lat, and yon semi-
pumpkin form-pooh, yon elegant form, to which justice is scarcely

did, would Louis A laugh so wildly, would BLANCHE chide her Skye
with such merry petulance, would ADELAIDE reply so frankly to the per-
tinacious vendor of lace-collars? Why should they not?, Am I one

the divine SHAKSPEARE counsels the lover to go for counsel–
“Neither too young nor yet unwed.”
By the way, my dear Mr. Punch, burn your blotting paper. I described
myself, truthfully, as a married man, at a certain boarding-house, and
was subsequently informed with much maliciousness that I was known
to be nothing of the kind, the proof being that the blotting-book re-
vealed that I had begun a letter “Beloved and Adored One.”. Sir, I
am sorry ſor those who could not believe that one so addressed the wife
of one's cheque-book, but that is not to the purpose. Burn your
blotting-paper. -
“Stretched, Sir, beside the Here We Are, and with one of your

anything, except that I think three-quarters of an hour, too long for
any female being, except a mermaid, to cling, almost motionless, to the

matter for the family doctor... The peripatetic salesfolk and mendicants
are a nuisance, because indiscriminating. Let them besiege
natured excursionists, tender fathers, unsuspicious countryfolk, when
they will, but why do they come to me? Do I want boxes stuck oyer

stale buns, toy windmills, dead star-fish or live Actinia, or am I likely to
bestow out of my limited funds alms to a dirty little girl, because, she
sings vilely by the side of a dirty old man who plays worse, or to a dirty
long boy because he shows me a dirty box containing nine beetles
pinned therein” Let them go to softer folks, and, take with them the

gradually, from my gaze like a beautiful dream. For I am tolerant, I am
patient, I am listening. I hear, in the group of nursemaids and children,
divers of the former speaking with almost exaggerated kindness to the
latter, and calling them dears, and seeming delighted at their talk, while
divers other attendants are stern, or sulky, or snappish with their charges,
and menace them with dire punishments. I look closer, and I see that
the Mammas of the first children are seated within ear-shot, or º

There are sweet passages in that book, that Sherry and Bitters, but for

blue-eyed youth with the black dog—he, I mean the youth, somewhat
resembles what I was a few years ago. I listen too, and in honour, for
folks talk to be heard, here. I learn that M.R. WAGNER's church is so

virtuous girls, and after talking virtuously through the three volumes,
they married, the plot being that a young clergyman was going to pro-

I cannot be delayed from the lawyer's hydraulics.

THE SAVAGES IN THE BACK SETTLEMENTS,
IN Gray's lnn Lane, on Sunday night last week, a fight took place
between two colonies of sav who have settled in that neighbour-
hood; the Kerry Indians and the Tipperary Indians. These tribes
have been for some time at variance, which at last broke out into open
war. To prevent, them from slaughtering each other in a civilised
capital, the police interfered, and thus attracted their animosity towards
themselves. The frantic barbarians attacked the peace officers with
their bludgeons, and desperately wounded several of them. According
to a report of the disturbance:–
“Sergeant 5 G had several of his teeth knocked out, and was severely bruised
about the head and body by being jumped upon. Nos. 157 and 195 G division were
also so *...'...'. that they were taken to the hospital, and two constables of
the city police have been frightfully knocked about."
Qf course these savage rioters were ultimately overpowered, though
all but one managed to make their escape, aided by their squaws, who,
we are told, were indefatigable in supplying them with weapons. What
a dreadſul,thing it is that an English police-officer should be subject to
be jºyed upon and have his teeth, knocked out by these inſuriated
Yahoos!. Like the other natives of the Hibernian wilds, both these
tribes of savages have their spiritual medicine-men, whom they call
Fathers, and beneath whom they all alike grovel in the most abject
rostration. What are these reverend Fathers about to allow the
erry and Tipperary savages to run so rampant?
“Nolo Episcopari.”
A “HARVEST. Home Festival,” according to a newspaper paragraph,
was held the other Sunday in Clare Market Chapel; Clare Market,
observe, not Haymarket, which might be thought the ſitter locality for
such a celebration, if it were forgotten that thanksgiving for a good
harvest is as due in one place as in another. The sermon, we are told,
was preached by the Rev. C. M. RoRINs “who has declined the Bishop.
ric of Central Africa.” Has he? Sensible man.
Heads and Tales.
MR. St. John, writing of the Dyaks, says that those interesting
people are not to be accused of savagery in respect to their favourite
practice of cutting off any head they can get at. They say that this is
simply a refined amusement, “Just as white folks read books, we seek
for heads.” A course of sea-side reading enables Mr. Punch to state
that no two amusements can be more unlike.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GOVERNESS ABROAD.
UT of their own country,
prophets, it is well known,
only obtain honour. A simi-
lar remark, we ſear, applies
to Governesses; but their
case is still harder, inas-
much as unlike some pro-
phets—those, for instance,
of the Raphael School or
Academy of high Astrologi-
cal Art, they don't receive
in lieu of honour any tan-
gible equivalent. e are
not surprised, therefore, to
hear of a great Governess
Emigration Movement.
Our colonial dependencies
have wisely declined to ac-
cept our periodical compli.
mentary offering of convicts.
While appreciating our
Sheffield cutlery, they are
not to be dazzled by
N the sharp blades bearing
the recognised certificate
“Town Made.” We shoul
T fancy, nevertheless, that
they would joyfully hail all
£) tº argosy freighted with re-
_`fined and intelligent spins.
- ters. Now that we are at
liberty to ex º our Looms,
- Engines, and Presses, there
is no reason why the machinery of education should be kept at home under lock
ey.
Adelaide and Victoria, however, we are told by some rude observers, do rot
require accomplished governesses. Those pretty young colonies are perfectly com-
petent to manage the kitchen garden, and can very well dispense with a con-
servatory for some time to come. We think that this conclusion is not well
grounded. Who would not be pained to see Victoria and Adelaide a pair of romps
with bright,ºyºs and sun-burnt cheeks, and splendid appetites, but aggravating
poor letter H. beyond all endurance, and making fearful havoc with their papa's
yeal, wine, and vinegar? Of course, the mother country don't contemplate sending
her wealthy daughters a parcel of blue stockings. They might, however, surely find
room for a few “Ologies” without disturbing their culinary stores. DR. Buck-
Asp and Mrs. GLASSE could go together arm-in-arm. To be conversant with
languages does not imply inability to pickle tongues. An acquaintance with con-
chology, one would think, would be a fitting preparation for scolloped oysters,
and as for pastry, that need not deteriorate by the fair manipulator's having had an
insight into the crust of the earth.
Another and still more unpleasant class of censors insinuate that the intending
emigrants carry two faces under one hood. While ostensibly going out to cultivate
the waste lands of mind, their real destination is the Eden of Matrimony. It is
rumoured that their ambition is not so much to enlarge the circle of knowledge, as
to fºrm a little circle of their own. That, in fine, they are bent on making per-
sonal conquests rather than in teaching the nascent idea how to shoot." We
don’t believe a word of it. But admitting it, for sake of argument, what does this
lºfty impeachment amount to? Simply that they aim at permanently promoting
the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Then it is asserted that the
nomadic tribes, who wander about in quest of nuggets, eschew marriage, and are
not prepared to execute a settlement. If this really be so, we have nothing
further to advance. We would not recommend our gently nurtured countrywomen.
a wanderer's life in a gipsy's tent; and although in this tight little Island there
may be a scanty crop of offers, comparing the iº of the Serpentine with
the Rovers of Swan River, it can scarcely be doubted that a beau in the hand is
worth two in the bush.
HARPY HOTELS.
At Doncaster, during the late races, according to our sporting friend “Angus,”
the hotel-keepers, “thoroughly maintained the high reputation they have ever
maintained for skinning their visitors.” For example, some of them charged
“four guineas for four nights' º; accommodation,” and at one establishment
the landlady and her whole household united in a vain attempt to make a spirited
łº: lieutenant “pay 1s. 9d for a bottle of seltzer water with a dash of brandy.”
making these charges-more absurd and audacious than the Balaclava charge–
hotel-keepers may well be represented as “skinning” their guests, because they
more than fleece them.
Touching the extortion exemplified, as above, by the Doncaster hotelkeepers, and
practised, more or less, by most others, we may venture to submit to our legislative
readers the following questions by a correspondent:-
“Wot difference is there alween drivin a Weehicle for Ireland keepin a Notell?

THE subjoined piece of intelligence has appeared in the columns of a
contemporary :-
“RELIGrous Toleration.—The Jews of Kattowitz, in Silesia, have just inaugu-
rated a new synagogue in that town. In a procession from the old place of worship
to the new, the Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy walked behind the four
rabbis, who carried rolls of parchment on which were written the Five Books of
Moses. After Divine Service a repast was offered to the persons who had taken part
in the cerelnony, when expressions of toleration, fraternity, and neighbourly love
were exchanged.”
The New Jerusalem has surely commenced in Kattowitz, where such
brotherly union exists between Jews and Christians as that indicated in
the foregoing ºil. it is not a hoax... In point of liberality
Kattowitz highly excels the British capital itself. When shall we see
the Chief Rabbi and the other Rabbis of London marching to open, a
synagogue in Shoreditch with CARDINAL WiseMAN, DR. CUMMING, the
Bishop of LoNDON, and a multitude of Church of England, Roman
Catholic, and Dissenting clergymen walking behind them? Never
perhaps, for there is some reason to fear that the ultra-Christian humility
of bringing up the rear of such a procession could, only have been im-
puted to ministers of Christianity playfully, by that modest assurance
which is regarded as rather characteristic of the Jewish race.
A CONSPICUOUS NUISANCE.
THE music-shop windows afford a gratuitous exhibition of very
peculiar works of art. These are the pictures which adorn the backs
and illustrate the contents of the music books. There is somewhat in
the best of them that is considerably repulsive, yet they are not alto-
gether and simply disgusting. The pretty men attired in the height of
evening dress, or brilliant fancy costume, and the ſashionable ball-room
beauties or stage heroines, represented as combining with them in
elegant positions, are too absurd to excite unmitigated, abhorrence.
They are ludicrous as well as offensive. The imanity with, which the
epicene warriors and ruffians are depicted knitting their brows, and
trying to look fierce, and the vacuity expressed in the faces of their
gesticulating female associates, suggest, that their originals were
animated dummies, actuated solely by the love of displaying their
clothes. The dancing dandies and their blooming partners look like
ideal portraits of tailors' wax-works endowed with semi-consciousness.
The imbecility of these figures is transcendent; its delineation evinces a
genius of a sort; it amounts to the sublime and something more: and
is so ridiculous as to provoke our disdainful laughter.
Among these illustrations in the music-shop windows there is one,
however, that causes no laughter whatever, although it exhibits a
laughing face. But the laugh is a horrid one, and the face is that of a
man with long whiskers, who is dressed in a lady's clothes. There is
not the least fun in this laughing face, but it wears an expression that
is unspeakably odious. This print is entitled Lady Dundreary, and the
less besides º we say about it the better.
Wilkes with Wings.
By accounts from Yankee Land we learn that:—
“CoMºMoDoRE WILKEs had been ordered to take the commando flying squadron
on the West India Station."
Is that because CoMMODoRE WILKEs is a goose?

JACTITATION OF MARRIAGE.-EXTRAORDINARY CASE.
MATRIMONIAL CAUSEs court.
FEDERALs v. South (Otherwise REBELs).
Before SIR JonATHAN BUN.com BE.
JActITATION of marriage, it may be necessary to inform our non-pro-
ſessional readers, is defined by civilians as being a suit where one of the
parties asserts that he or she is married, which the other party denying,
and no adequate proof of the marriage being brought, the offending
party is enjoined silence on that head.
The circumstances are briefly these:—FEDERALs, the pursuer, and
Miss South, the defendant, are very distantly related (8th or 10th
cousins), FEDERALs having much common Irish and German blood in
his veins, while MIss Souths has a fine blue aristocratic tinge. About
eighty years ago, FEDERALs, and Miss SouTH ran away from home,
FEDERALs having first shockingly abused his mother. The pursuer
contends that matrimonial rites were duly celebrated, and that the awe-
inspiring words “for better or worse, until death us do part,” were
employed and assented to. In support of his case against Miss South
the pursuer alleges that DR. FRANKLIN was present and gave her
away. Miss SouTH retorts by asserting that DR. FRANKLIN never
ave anything away – that, didn't belong to him, and challenges
i. to prove that he did.
Miss South (who is properly so called, REBELs being a nom-de-guerre
flung at her by FEDERALs in the heat of passion) indignantly denics that
she ever had any real attachment to the pursuer, and jºi; aSSC-
verates that there never was any union of hand or heart, nothing in fact
beyond a contract of Partnership—a simple amalgamation of joiars.
For some time Miss South has been in the cotton trade, and is perfectly
competent to maintain herself and manage her own affairs, should the
Court pronounce judgment in her favour. FEDERALs, as most persons
are aware, is a noted manufacturer of wooden nutmegs. Their pecu-
niary interests are not exactly coincident, for while Miss South
demands a large stall in the market for her cotton, FEDERALs having
no such want for his wooden nutmegs, has long been endeavouring to
prevent her from occupying more than a corner. That Miss South's
is a state of slavery no one can deny, though it is not pretended that
FEDERALs is altogether responsible for that.
Again, Miss SouTH a strong-minded female, stands in need of no pro.
tection. FEDERALs, a nervous irritable man, who regards his best
friends with suspicion, on the contrary, has always been crying out that
there must be more police at the custom-house, and that if something
is not done, he shall certainly be robbed. Miss South says that she has
enough to do looking after her cotton, being a dainty fabric, to keep it
from the blacks, without being annoyed by the “delicate attentions” of
FEDERALS, who is given to vapour and smoke. Finally, Miss South
declares that her passionate admirer the love-sick FEDERALs is com-
pletely deranged—that he raves and is given to stamping—that he
often runs like a Bull, and that certain colours— British ones in
particular, will cause him to roar.
The Court after hearing the pleadings, which are very voluminous,
took time to consider.
It is rumoured that the costs—of FEDERALs especially—will, as in
the case of another suspected Lunatic in the English Court of Chancery,
be literally "stunning.”
NoTE. Since these proceedings were commenced, the position of
FEDERALs has been so altered, that instead of the “Pursuer” he
might perhaps now be more properly called “FEDERALs the Pursued.”
Imperial Present to the Pope.
AMONGst other valuable presents, we are informed that the EMPREss
has sent Pigs, as a further proof of her affection, a magnificent crino-
line with all the latest improvements, so that he may wear it on all
great festivities of the Church, under his sacerdotal robes. It is of the
very largest dimensions, and we have no doubt will look every bit as
well under the Pope's petticoat as under any other old woman's. The
present must be taken only as another indication of the prevailing idea
that rules in the mind of the EMPRESS that it is absolutely impossible
to make too much of the Pope.
“ UNE ERREUR PRONoncée.”
EveR since LoRD JoHN’s elevation to the Peerage, he obleeges more
than ever, He seems to be under the influence of the old aristocratic
feeling Noblesse oblige. It wouldn't be a bad motto for him.
WHAT Is A SHIN-PLASTER P-Xt is a favourite American remedy, a
kind of Poor Man's Plaster, and one that gives but poor relief, which
is now being, applied in all cases of tick-dollar-oux. It has the effect
of materially lowering the circulation.
DANCING IN DEMENTIA.
At Biarritz, the other day, in the course of a grand ball given at the
Villa Eugénie, we are informed that a cotillon was danced before the
EMPRESs, apparently, and that:—
“An innovation has been introduced into the figure which is likely to become the
rage in the Paris salons this winter. It consists in offering to the ladies, on inviting
them to dance, small flags of different colours. One of the gentlemen carries a staff
surmounted by ten ribbons, also of different colours, the ends of which are held by
the gentlemen and ladies taking part in the dance."
We should like to know whether it ever occurs to any one among the
gentlemen who take part in this extremely imbecile proceeding, and
especially to the one who carries the bauble, “a staff surmounted by
ten ribbons,” that he is making himself a deplorable fool. According
to the communication above-quoted, “the EMPEROR was not present,
ſceling a little indisposed.” If Napoleon had been there, the spec-
tacle of such fatuous, fiddle-ſaddle would have endangered his life.
Perhaps this silly cotillon will be “the rage” in the salons of Paris
this winter. It would probably be still more popular in certain insti-
tutions devoted to psychological medicine, at which dancing is found to
be a remedial amusement, and it might, no doubt with peculiar advan-
tage, be introduced into asylums for idiots.

HOMOEOPATHY AT SEA.
HERE is a piece of news which may interest our homoeopathic readers,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DAY AT DIEPPE.
Y. N
“‘They manage these things better in, France,' remarked my excellent friend Jones, as
we the other day were looking at the bathers down at Bullsgate. ‘We English are most
moral people, and all that; but in bathing we are certainly less decent than our neighbours.
Just you come with me, old boy, and spend a morning at Dieppe, and then acknowledge that
the bathing here is not of the first water.”
“So across to France we went, my Punch, and so “calm was the glassy ocean’ that Joxes
could not refrain from saying it was quite a mer de glass. Even this bad joke however failed
to excite in me any nauseous sensation, and I landed without having to call out for the
Steward, excepting once or twice to bring me a petit rerre de cognac, just to drink to Jones's
health and wish ourselves bon voyage. As I mean to write anonymously, I don’t much mind
confessing that I never in my life had set my foot in France before. So Jones had some slight
trouble to make me walk about with him at the pace which, as an old traveller, of course he
wished to go. It was evening when we landed, and the quay looked gay and pretty with its
lamps lit and its groups of people walking underneath the trees, or sitting comfortably
smoking just outside the Cafés; and while we marched along, as Britons always do, in the
middle of the streets, there were no touters to pester one with “Nice accommodation, gents,’
and the women looked so pleasant in their bonnetless white caps, and the blanchisseuses were
so industrious at their windows, and things seemed all so different to what º were at
Bullsgate, that I allowed myself to suffer most unusual pangs of hunger before I let Jones
drag me into our hotel. -
“After supping, among other extraordinary things, upon ‘Epigrammes d'agneau' and hot
stewed ‘flageolets,” (I ºi. fried flutes would follow, or boiled ophicleides perhaps,) we
were told there was a bal that night at the Casino, to which, it being a juvenile night, of
course we felt we ought to What would pious Clapham say if it heard that Jones and I,
two most respectable married men, had been seen at a Casino, and there had met the Misses
Caunch Mouse, attended by their Maſſ in London those dear indies would sooner commit
suicide than go to a Casino, or even to Cremorne. But the Casino at Dieppe is quite another
thing, of course; and rigid care, is taken that whoever, likes to dance may find a decent
\tº for a waltz or a quadrille, without the possibility of finding the reverse. . The
isses Church Mouse, bless them! are much too proper-minded ever to dream of dancing in
a public-room in England. But the twenty .. of water, you know, makes all the
difference; and one may dare to do in France what Society in England would shudder to see
one.
“Well, next morning, after making no end of a good déjeńner (by the way I felt quite
}. to find how well the garçons understood me when I trotted out before them my fine
ritannic French, which, as they all of them spoke English, there really was no need, Jones
said, for my displaying) we lit up our cigars, which we had luckily brought with us, for what
they call cigars in France are most unsmokeable and vile, and then set forth on our mission
as inspectors of Les Bains. As anyone may for a trifle go and sce them for himself, I shall
not waste your valuable space by a description. Enough to say that decency and comfort are
more studied at Dieppe than they are at any bathing-place that I have seen in England, and
that French girls as a rule when they get into the water can do something more than stand
and bob their bodies up and down, which is all that British lady-bathers in general can do.
I saw plenty of girls swimming and taking splendid headers from a boat kept for the purpose
and I thought such bathing must be far more healthy and enjoyable than the bobbing around
business which is popular at Bullsgate. - -
“But there are other things to do in a day spent at Dieppe than to sit and smoke cigars,
and make inspection of the bathers. So leaving
Jones to show his genius in ordering a dinner
(for when a man has time to dine, a table d'hôte
1s a º I prowled about the town, and
peeped into the clurches, and pottered about the
cliffs, and popped my nose into the castle, and
worked my legs as hard as Englishmen when
pleasuring are prone usually to do. I found no
street-boys to º me when Istopped and stared
about; and in a stroll outside the town along
the road to Rouen (which is not the Road to
Ruin, for I hear the fine old city has been of late
so modernised that old tourists scarcely know it),
I found the peasants vastly civil in showing me
the way, and the bows some of them gave me
when I wished them a bonjour, were such as
English clodhoppers might vainly try to imitate.
I have heard complaints of Frenchmen of a some-
what higher standing being selfish and uncivil to
tourists whom they meet; but sofar as one day's
walk enables...me to judge, the peasantry at any
rate seem willing to oblige.
“You are well aware, monami, how I love la
chasse, and pride myself not vainly on my prowess
as a ‘sportman.” Conceive then my delight at
seeing PENsion Des CHIENs stuck up as the
signboard of a cottage near the harbour. There
were nets strewed at the front, and appearances
outside, I own, looked rather fishy. By a peep
over a paling I saw a row of little pens, looking
less like dog kennels than poultry coops or º
styes, but the growls and yelps and barks which
were emitted thence were what no porcine throat
could possibly give vent to. At the gate there
stood a yellow-faced lean man in a blue blouse,
looking far less like a dog-keeper than a jealous
butcher. ‘ Montrez-moi les chiens,” said I to the
master of this canine hotel, “Jesuis un chasseur,
moi, et, mon ami, je reur voir les chiens de la
chasse.” Upon this heart-touching º: ot
course the gate was opened, and the Pension
with its inmates lay patent to my view. How
shall 1 describe the noble animals I saw, or give
you an idea of my ecstacy at sight of them?
There was Azor, le bel Azor, with emaciated
carcase, and a pair of lanthorn jaws, such as
would make light of crunching scores of ducks
and chickens. There was César, a cross-breed
between a pointer, and a poodle, with blear eyes
and broken teeth which told of long, long service.
How many a plump partridge hast thou con-
sumed, my César, or more likely larks and linnets
and other smaller game-birds? And whence,
my noble Beppo, came thy long hound's ears
and thy fuzzy poodle's legs and tail of a Skye
terrier? Verily it is a wise French dog that
knoweth his own father! Nay, yelp not, pauvre
chien, I would not insult thvancestors. Cult,
me querelis eranimas tuis. Silence done, mauvais
bete / Go home and chain up, Uglyſ Wert thou
mine I should soon wish thee in the land of thy
forefathers. Surely such a mongrel must have
come from far Mongrelia.
“A French chasseur, my Punch, is a wonder-
moving sight. As a sportsman it rejoiced my
sympathising heart to see the brave ALPhosse
and Théodore starting for the chace, with
velvet hunting caps of green, and velvet shoot-
ing-coats to match, with purple gloves, long
tellow leggings and capacious yard-broad game
ags buckled at their backs. In France the

me that the days are few and far between when
brave Alphonse and Théodore return with a
full bag. Larks, thrushes and tomtits are no
doubt nice to eat, and of course a French
chasseur would never leave such trophies of his
skill upon the field. But it would take a thousand
thrushes, linnets and tomtits to fill one of the
game-bags which les chasseurs love to carry;
and savagely as the warfare against small birds
has been waged, I fear ALPhonse and Théodore

POLITICAL EVERGREENS.
A RARE old plant undoubtedly is the Ivy green, but how superior in
point of verdure is the venerable Palm'. There are sermons in stones—
even in a GLAD-stone—and if there is no homily in Palm, it is because
aj. spirit inspires it with songs of joy. Autumn comes—flowers
fade on their stems—leaves loosen from their stalks—desolation reigns
over the Woods and Forests, but, the P. of the country are
cheering, and why? because there is stilſvigour in its Palm.
Palm is found in all places, and has been for more than half a century
—Home, Foreign, and Colonial. Yet there is nothing parasitical about
the rare old plant, and if it clings to the House, certainly the House
derives additional respectability and value from its attachment. It is
wooed alike by the courtly zephyr and the popular gale, and while
around it, branches blown from Dizzy heights are spread, somehow or
other, “eternal sunshine settles on its head.”
Of another evergreen we are reminded that “the stateliest building
man can raise is the Ivy's food at last.” This, we suppose, refers to
BARRY's new Houses of Parliament, and doubtless that legislative
structure furnishes sustenance, to Palm, and will, we hope, for many
pleasant years supply him with his dew. Nervous Politicians when
they see a time-honoured institution covered with lichens, are apt to be
distrustful of its stability, but when connected and fortified with Palm,
they feel that the Church is in no danger—and still less are the Ministers.
hough this perennial rises to a considerable altitude, and has an
aristocratic bearing, being picked out with strawberry leaves, it is
remarkable for its genial warmth, rather than that cold shade at which
plebeians shiver. The blessing invoked for the Oak we all desire for
the Palm while we gladly sing:—
- And still flourish he, a hale green tree,
When a hundred years are gone.”
Foreign nations may proudly repose upon their laurels, but BRITANNIA,
who delighteth more in peace than in power, leans with complacency
upon her Palm.

A PERVERTER OF “PUNCH.
MR. PUNCH lately animadverted on the impertinence of a pseudo:
tºº. coxcomb, the author of a letter in a Bath paper signed
H.S. FAGAN. The same quack, under the same signature, has yentured
to have another fling at Punch; his missiles chiefly consisting of second-
hand suds, derived from Mrs. Harris's pail. Among them, however,
there is this original aspersion:—
“If any of your readers do read Mr. Punch's letter press, they may have s as
I accidentally did, an account (21st June last, I º headed, “Protestant Monkey
Tricks,' containing, amongst other choice bits of absurdity, the following: “On
Easter day, which we all know is a high day in the Romish Church, so likewise was
it at St. Matthias.” Now, as a clergyman, whose Easter services were not so long
over, I could not read this unmoved. I had, in my simplicity, imagined Easter day
to be a high day, not in the Romish Church and at St. Matthias only, but all over
the Christian world—‘a day to be highly remembered among us.” No doubt Mr.
Punch, and those who form their views on his statements, and reciprocally react on
those statements (for he is always true to the sentiments of the class for which he
writes), have, like the Doctor in MolièRE, long ago ‘changed all that.'"
The remark about Easter, which MR. H. S. FAGAN above represents
as that of Punch, occurs, not in the language of Mr. Punch, but in a
quotation, the subject of Punch's comment. MR. H. S. FAGAN cannot
be such a fool as not to have been perfectly well aware of that fact
when he alleged a different onc. #.. s, instead of MR. H. S. FAGAN,
Punch ought to write the Rev. H. S. FAGAN. MR. FAGAN dates his
letter “Charlcombe Rectory,” and calls himself “a clergyman.” It
does not therefore follow that he is one. MR; FAGAN may be no more
a clergyman, than Mr. Punch is the author of the “absurdity” imputed
to him by MR, FAGAN. If, however, he is a clergyman, he is evidentl
one of those clergymen who affect the character of Romish priests. He
may be expected to preach their opinions. , Let those who may think it
worth while to hear the Rev. MR FAGAN hold forth, be careful to take
a Bible with them. When MR. FAGAN gives out the text, let them
look, it up, lest perchance they should find that the preacher has cited
words not to be found in the book. The old original Deceiver, we all
know, can quote Scripture for his purpose, but he would be more likely
to misquote it; and so would any ecclesiastical Humbug who mis-
quotes Punch.
Mr. Punch proposes for the consideration of MR. FAGAN, or the
*::: º: S. FAGAN, the subjoined variation of part of a popular
Canticle :-
“Speak the truth, and let speech be free;
ou can, prove Punch a pagan:
But don't you sit there and tell lies about me,
Deceitful and impudent FAGAN.”
There, MR. FAGAN, if you are fond of intonation, intone that!
A LIBERAL PROPOSAL.
“A RAILwAY DIRECTOR,” writing to the Times, emphatically says-
“We are running some monster trains at a loss to the shareholders and a risk to
the passengers. Of course, we have done what we can to render their working safe,
but for one I maintain that this cannot be done. As our manager says, we had
better give them their fares to stay at home."
We do not mind entering into an agreement with this same railway.
Let them only send us the fare of each excursion-train they run, and wº
will solemnly promise “to stay at home.” We have no doubt, if
the above liberal offer were more generally known, that there are
thousands who would be too glad to accept the terms of the company at
half-price. The shareholders shouldn’t grumble, because if the present
system is (vide suprā) a loss to them, the fewer persons that travel by
such trains, the more their loss is likely to be diminished. In fact, we
believe it would be a positive gain to many Railways, if they closed
their premises, and ceased running their trains altogether. Better..do
that, than pay £60,000 a-year, like the Great Western, incompensation
monies for accidents. - -
We hope shortly to receive a letter from the Secretary of this rail-
way, stating...that our proposal has been before the Board, and the
Directors will be most happy to close with it.

THE HAYMARKET AND THEREABOUT.
THE FROG IN THE BLOCK OF COAL.
It is not fº. known that, the frog, whose untimely decease the Commis-
sioners of the International Exhibition are now mourning, continued up to the day
of its death to express itself in the Welsh tongue, with a degree of fluency the more
extraordinary when we consider the very lengthened period of its incarceration.
The public is aware that on its first liberation from the block of coal, it made a
communication in Welsh, supposed to relate to the cause of its being so immured,
but in consequence of no person present understanding that language, this interest.
ing piece of antediluvian history was lost, for since then the Frog exhibited an
evident repugnance to touch upon the topic, which may we therefore suppose
have been a tender one. As soon as it became known that the language it spoke
was Welsh, an interpreter, one DAVID AP MoRGAN AP REEs, i.". offered
his services, and it is from him that we have learnt the following interesting
particulars.
DAVID AP REEs informs us that the Frog from the first, displayed a great desire
to ascertain the public opinion concerning itself, and on hearing that some sceptics
deemed it an imposture, it swelled visibly, foamed at the mouth, and exclaimed in
a most excited state “cwmddrwellydd llanwrst y dwyhdcswrt,” which our infor.
mant tells us is a malediction of most fearful import. A few days later it introduced
the subject again, and on Rees telling it that public opinion had changed, and now
inclined to consider it the identical Frog who was swallowed up by the lily-white
duck, it appeared very uneasy, but assuming an air of nonchalance, it said the report
was a canard. Rees judging from the agitation of the Frog when it heard of its
brother's tragical end, and the concern and dejection depicted on its countenance
as it was told the nature of his ill-fated journey, says he considers the Frog had
been crossed in love, and that that had something to do with the abnormal position
in which it was found. This, however, is merely a conjecture.
The Frog was visited during its short sojourn in the International Exhibition
by several distinguished men of science, among others, by SIR Roderick Murchison,
who after a careful inspection of the block of coal, and its late tenant, went away as
much a disbeliever as he came, for he was heard to exclaim, with great emphasis,
“Blue lias,” alluding, we suppose, in a somewhat hasty manner, to the exhibitors
of the Frog and Coal. Not so MR. Max Muller, who held a lengthened conver-
sation with the Frog, and pronounced it to be of the Aryan family, and a disciple of
Zoroaster.
... About, a week before its death, MR. BuckLAND, the naturalist, hearing that
it was ailing, sent a messenger to inquire whether, in the event of its decease, it
would wish to be stuffed, or preserved in spirits; offering in either case to perform
the operatiºn. The Frog returned no answer; but became from that period very
nervous and hypochondriacal, took to feeling its pulse, changed colour when a
Frenchman passed, and showed every sign of a confirmed croaker; and shortly
after, to the deep regret of Her Majesty's Commissioners and the public generally,
it breathed its last.
PALACE AND PRISON.
In the fort of Varignano,
On a hard and narrow bed,
Brooding thoughts, as a volcano
Broodeth lava-floods unshed,
Lies a chained and crippled hero,
Balked and baffled, not subdued,
Though his fortune's sunk to zero,
At blood-heat still stands his mood.
In his sumptuous sea-side palace,
Where Biarritz looks o'er sea,
With all splendour, for such solace
As from splendour wrung may be, a
Sits a crowned and sceptred sovereign,
Strong in arms, more strong in art,
Wrapped in thoughts past men's discovering,
With a marble stone for heart.
From her centuries' sleep arisen,
Clenching half unfettered hands,
*Twixt that palace and that prison,
Flushed and fierce Italia stands.
Brave words she has owed that ruler,
Brave words and brave deeds as well,
Now she doubts he fain would fool her
Of the hopes he helped to swell.
So with visage dark and lowering
She that palace-threshold spurns,
And with tenderness o'er-powering
To the fortress-prison turns.
Ne'er a doubt of the devotion
Of that chained and crippled chief,
Clouds her love's profound emotion,
Stays the passion of her grief.
What’s an Emperor's word, whose action
To his utterance gives the lie?
But this chief for love bade faction,
Prudence, policy stand by—
Blind may-be, but blind for brightness
Of the goal to which he strove,
All his life is one long witness
Life to him is less than love.
Then what wonder to the prison
From the palace if she turn?
'Tis her star that newly risen
O'er that ſortress-cell doth burn.
The true prison is that palace,
And that prisoner is true king !
Were his pallet-bed a gallows,
There Italia's heart would cling,
Not to yon man dark and callous,
Girt by his base courtier-ring.
THE PARTY AT THE PAVILION.
LoRD RANELAGH has been feasted at that exquisite
edifice the Pavilion, at Brighton, by nearly three hundred
Volunteers. They presented Joses the Avenger with two
swords in testimony of his services to the cause of Volulu-
teering. One weapon was splendid, and for show, the other
serviceable, and for use. His Lordship -
his speech in acknowledgment, said that he expected to find
his picture in Punch, and that he should be represented as
a Japanese, wearing the two swords which indicate merit in
Japan. Mr. Punch obliges him with literary, rice pictorial
immortality, but in so doing has noidea of ridic
man who in his way, not perhaps always the most bland
(but Riflemen can't be made with rosewater,) did very much
towards promoting the introduction of arms of precision,
before it became fashionable to patronise them, and who
is a very energetic and useful officer of Volunteers. There
is such a thing as having a little too much self-assertion,
and a little too lively a sense of one's own merits; but on
in the course of
a noble-
the other hand it is a very good thing to be in earnest, and
it is doubtless aggravating to be treated to the cold shoulder
by Swells who take up one's own ideas and get kudos by
doing so. Mr. Punch might pick a crow or two with his
friend Jones the Avenger, touching several matters, but
he abstains from any ornithologi
as*:: cheerfully to stick this feather in LoRD RANELAGH’s
schako.

weak and elderly maiden lady to be frightened into fits and high strikes by seeing through
her spectacles such a nawful piece of intelligence as this:—
“Courageous Conduct of AN OLD LADY.—At M., near N., an elderly lady, Miss X., resides in a semi-
detached house in — Street. The only other occupant of the house was a maid-servant. About two o'clock
on Wednesday morning week Miss X. was awoke by a man's arm being thrust under the bed in which she
was lying, the intruder on being questioned, saying he was in search of money. The fellow at once made
off, closely pursued by the old lady. On the way out he seized a poker, and (having apparently previousl
prepared for his escape) succeeded in locking the street-door from the outside, taking away the key. Miss º
at once opened a window and leaped into the street, but was so stunned by the fall, which is several feet,
that she for some time was unable to give chase or alarm. The burglar got clean away, and from the finding
of the poker on the Scarborough Road it is presumed he has gone thither. The man is supposed to have been
secreted in the house overnight, as he had made sure of locking the street-door after him. He had lit a candle,
which seems to have been burning an hour. He had ransacked all the house, but failed to discover the plate
and money; but has got together and carried off about £50 value of watches, brooches, lockets, chains, rings,
and sundry articles of jewellery. The East Riding constabulary are in hot chase, and are stimulated by a
reward which has just been offered for the capture of the burglar.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NAGGLETONS ON THEIR TOUR.
The Scene represents the Interior of a First-Class Carriage. The distin-
guished Couple hare it all to themselves, and are going from one
Seaside place to another at an hour's distance.
Mrs. Maggleton. Of course you’ve left the keys behind.
Mr. Waggleton. Why of course? Because you always do?. It happens
that I haven't, for here they are. What else may be left behind I can't
Say.
Mrs. N. No, you took care to have business to go out about when
you might have helped me in packing. -
Mr. N. Yes, for the last time I made the offer, you sent me packing
myself. Ha! haſ - -
Mrs. N. You intend that for some kind of joke, I suppose. It would
be a very good thing if people didn't attempt what they don't under-
stand. But because WYNDHAM WAREHAM says clever things, all the
“Flips” club must try to imitate him, which is very pitiable.
Mr. N. I thought, my dear, that having (ironically) so many accom-
plishments, you could afford not to set up for a judge of wit.
Mrs. N. I know real wit when I hear it, and I know that it is very
unlike the ridiculous and vulgar banter that for it at the “Flips,”
at least if I may judge by the specimens you home, though to be
sure you may spoil them in bringing; likely enough, considering the
state in which you come home.
Mr. W. There are so many counts to that indictment, my dear, that
I will plead to the last only, and say that you never saw me the worse
for what I had taken at the little social meeting that always excites
your spite. if
contrary, if you
uch inclined
Mrs. N. I didn’t say you were the worse. On the
ſºme rather foolish, you are good-natured, and not m
to talk.
Mr. M. Your amiability, my dear, is an encouragement to me to per-
severe in pressing these little holidays upon you. A cheerful companion
more than repays any trouble or expense she may occasion.
Mrs. N. I understand your manly and generous, meaning, MR. NAG-
GLEtos. But I am neither vexed nor surprised. I require no new
proof that your earlier life was not passed in good society. The idea
that, in return for her railway fare, a lady is to amuse you, is so essen-
tially commercial that it would make one smile, but that the children
are in daily danger of imbibing such lessons.
Mr. W. If they imbibe nothing worse than my teaching, Mrs. NAG-
GLETON, they will do no harm. I can’t say as much f they imbibe
what ſhave seen you giving them at lunch, namely, Burton ale.
Mrs.N.I believe that I am responsible to their medical attendant |th
for their dietary, MR. NAGGLETON.
Mr. N. Has your own dietary included a º swallowed by
mistake, my love? Because you are bringing out the long words, un-
common, this ºf;
Mrs. N. I can well understand (smiling) that you had no such com-
plaint to make of the first MRs. NAGGLEton. I think she spelt coffee
with the same letters as cough, did she not, dear?
Mr. N. It’s untrue. And whatever she spelt coffee with, M’m, she
inade it with hot water, which is a precious deal more than I can get
her successor to do.
Mrs. A. Her successor should have been a kitchen-maid, my dear.
Mr. N. Well, in the matter of tongue and temper, that might have
involved no great change in my present happiness, my love.
Mrs. M. WYNDHAM WAREHAM must have given you quite a heap of
his old sayings, which he has worn threadbare, and can't use any
longer. Are they the perquisites of his followers ? You come out quite
smart in them. What a pity it is you forget them before company, and
try nonsense of your own!
Mr. M. Ah, my dear, when we want to wound we shouldn’t show
that we are in a rage. Calm yourself down to your usual ill-temper,
and you may be more disagreeable. At present you are a study—and I
may add, thanks to sea air, a brown sº

Mrs. N. (sadly). If anything should happen to you, *... I will

Mr. M. Indeed, love? Well, I promise you this. I’ll try and post.

Mrs. N. Yes, it is very well to talk so, but I assure you, HENRy, the
thought comes to me very often, and prevents my taking notice of
many many a thing which I ought to resent.
Mr. M., Deuce it does?'. You resent most things, and grumble at the
rest. What was that station we passed ?
Mrs. N. Tinkleby. ... Couldn’t you read that ? How your eyes are
failing, and what childish vanity not to wear spectacles.
Mr. N. Vanity. Ha! haſ what have I to be vain of 2
[Meaning a hitter satire on his matrimonial acquisition.
Mrs.N. (accepting the challenge). I really don't know. And pride,
which is a nobler thing, I do not suppose you are capable of feeling.
I have read that it is much dulled by the instincts of commerce.
Certainly WYNDHAM WAREHAM, your model, did say that you had reason
to be proud of your marriage, but it is not for me to recal such
expressions of opinion.
r: M. Well, strictly speaking, my dear, it is not, but their rarity
shall be your excuse. And WAREHAM’s so good a judge on conjugal
matters that he has kept himself single, and means to do so.
Mrs. W. Ah! a joke redolent of spirits and water and tobacco-smoke,
and would suit the “Flips” at two in the morning.
Mr. N. Your ridiculous animosity to that harmless meeting is per-
fectly unaccountable, MRs. NAGGLETON.
Mrs. M. Animosity ?—no. But I regret that the children are liable to
hear, through servants, who may learn it from tradesmen, that you are
in that kind of society. I wish you could pass by another name than
your own among such a set.
Mr. M. (furious). Set ! By Jove, MRs. NAGGLEton, you talk as if
you had been born in the purple—that is to say, to suit your under-
standing, as if your uncle had been a marquis instead of a man—
Mrs. M. The department of the medical profession more especially
pursued by my lamented uncle, is one which can afford to disregard the
scoffs of vulgarity.
Mr. N. Another burst of dictionary talk. Do you think it proper in
a first-class carriage. If you cut your words in proportion to the fares,
I should like to travel third.
Mrs. N. I make no doubt that in the third-class carriage you would
find companions who would suit you...You might even fancy yourself
at the “Flips,” humbly listening to WYNDhAM WAREHAM. .
Mr. N. That’s about the tenth time you’ve dragged in that man's
name by the head and shoulders. What has he done to offend you?
Mrs. M. He Nothing. I shouldn't speak to him if we met, for I

TO BE SOLD-THE MATERIALS OF THE GREAT GLOBE.
“The Great Globe itself,
Yea, all that it inherits, shall dissolve,
And like the baseless fabric of a vision,
Leave not a wreck behind.”—SHAkseeARE and Dr. CUMMING.
THE composition of the crust of the Great Globe, and the nature of
its contents have long been matters of curious interest to the geological
student. A fine opportunity is now presented for investigating both the
one and the other.
From our own observations (in Leicester Square) we are forced to
the conclusion that the theories hitherto prevalent as to the composition
of the Globe's crust are entirely erroneous. The real substance of that
crust is neither silurian nor igneous rock, neither trap nor basalt
gneiss nor hornblende, slate nor shale, but fir balks, with lath an
plaster filling up their interstices. The contents of the interior of the
Globe, instead of mineral substances in a state of fluidity and at a great
heat, as our geologists have hastily inferred, turn out to be tattered
canvas, ragged bits of framework composed of profiling and battens,
lime dust, scaffold poles, trestles, old shoes, rags and rubbish, and
as the very core of the squalid mass, an object which is ignorantly
described as a statue of GeoRGE THE SEcoSD, but which we conclude
to be an oddly formed preadamite boulder, with one of those faint and
accidental resemblances to humanity, which are often found in masses
of natural stone.
Appeal Against Wrong.
WE hear that MR. W. F. WINDHAM has lodged, notice of appeal
against the harsh decision of the tribunal that declared him capable of
managing his own affairs. We hope that this gentleman, will succeed
in reversing an injustice, and we think that he is not likely to fail for
want of evidence. The wishes of all decent folks are heartily with
him.

At the conclusion of a Coroner's #3. held § the East of London
HARLOTTE URIPPIN-
“The jury returned the following special verdict—That deceased expired from the
effects of inflammation of the stomach, accelerated by the want of the common
necessaries of life; and the jury unanimously censure the conduct of MR. BLANK,
the assistant relieving officer of the Local Union, in the matter, and consider that he
did not perform his duty; and the jury further desire to recommend that in future
the Board of Guardians should make due inquiries as to how inmates of the Union
are likely to be taken care of outside the house, before ordering their removal
from it.”
In the above extract we have disguised names, because the relieving
officer, whom we call MR. BLANK, denied the statement by one of the
witnesses, whereon the censure of the jury, was grounded, and also
because, as the servant of the Board of Guardians, he most likely acted
under his masters’ orders, or at least, according to their instructions.
|
|
But if the evidence against him and them is credible, here is a case of
criminal breach of duty which contributed to the causation of a pauper's
death, and that under extremely horrible circumstances.
In summing up, the Coroner stated that:—
“It was clear that the deceased and her family, º in extreme starvation,
presented herself at the union-house, and represented her husband as starving her.
Without the most ordinary inquiry as to whether he was doing so from neglect or
through necessity, the Board of Guardians ordered CRIPPIN to be proceeded against.
MR. BLANK, the relieving officer, went to CRIPPIN, and under a threat of three
months' imprisonment, compelled him to remove his family. They were placed in
a room and there had to undergo such dreadful starvation that deceased died of the
effects, and they would have all perished had not their groans attracted the attention
of the neighbours.”
If MRs. CRIPPIN had been what Society calls a respectable person,
and had met her death through a railway accident caused by an over-
sight or blunder on the part of a guard, an engine-driver, or a signal-
man, would not, the coroner's jury have returned a verdict of man;
slaughter against the unfortunate rather than culpable official P Had
the accident arisen from his gross carelessness with the aggravation of
savage brutality, would not a higher and more rational Court have
confirmed the verdict P Of course it is quite possible that the censure
pronounced as above on MR. BLANK was wholly undeserved. But if
the evidence really proved that the deceased was starved to death by
his fault, the verdict ought to have gone beyond mere censure. It
ought, indeed, also to have implicated the Board of Guardians still more
highly than their officer; but no coroner's jury can be expected to be
consistent enough to criminate a Board.
NEITHER FISH, FLESH, NOR GOOD RED HERRING.

ticular, but I should be sorry to sit at the same table with a person who
could eat a Bat. I suppose he was going to order the lady a roast owl

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNIVERSAL ALLIANCE
FOR THE DEPRESSION OF ANIMAL SPIRITS AND ENCOURAGEMENT
OF GLOOM.
A DDRESS.
IN modern times, when uninterrupted sunshine, celestial and com;
mercial, is apt to engender a too felicitous warmth, the Universal
Alliance for the Depression of Animal Spirits and Encouragement of
Gloom, deem it desirable by the damp blanket of expostulation, to repel
hilarity and º: the jocund glow a check. With this object in view
we reverse the telescope, and contemplate scenes that are brightest
through its diminishing end.
The Universal Alliance with which is incorporated the “Anti-joking
Society” (registered in accordance with the Fº of the unfriendly
Acts) was established by a few low-spirited and smile-despising men
assembled for mutual consolation on a foggy evening under the shadow
of the Exeter Arcade. For many years past, their efforts to displease
have been abundantly crowned with success. It is now proposed, to
supplement individual exertion, by legislative restrictions. ith this
intent, application will shortly be made to Parliament to impose
penalties on all persons exhibiting animal spirits above a certain
standard–grin-proof-or provoking in others that exhilaration which
no member of this Alliance has ever been known to display.
A few examples, showing the evils complained of, and sought to be
abolished by the Universal Alliance, may here be quoted their
Quarterly Review:—
A vivacious young Lady, the niece of a High-Church Canon, with
whom she resided, in a fit of temporary insanity furtively drew away
the easy chair in which he was about to deposit himself. The conse-
quences were disastrous. The Canon subsided on the tapis, and the
spectators were thrown into frightful convulsions. Worst of all, the
anon never quite recovered his dignity, and the name, of his niece
having been expunged from his Will, a loss was entailed upon her
amounting to not less than one thousand pounds!
And again. A "...º. boy, sitting at his grandmamma's
feet, as, she was reading her Herald with a severe countenance, enun.
ciated the following quely from AEsop's Fables: “If a nut . speak
what would it say?”, “Hold your tongue” was the natural reply;
to which however the boy demurred. “Wrong, you are, Granny,” #:
observed, “it would say, Hold your jaw'” The delinquent was in-
stantly whipped and sent to bed, where his screams became so terrific
as to frighten the spirited horses of a troop of dragoons marching along
the road, seven of whom were dismounted with a broken skull!
If further argument were required to prove our position, it could be
supplied. It is true that the Registrar-General occasionally reports a
case of quinsy cured by the exercise of the risible muscles, and we
have no wish to banish any remedial agent from the London Pharma-
copaea. A joke may at any time be taken medicinally, provided always
that the invalid is a free member of the Alliance (one of seven years
standing), and his annual subscription is not in arrear.
To the EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH the grateful acknowledgments of
the Alliance are due, for the gloom cast over Europe by his prolonged
occupation of the Papal territories. The Pope of RomE º the EM-
PEROR OF AUSTRIA may also claim credit for the tacit recognition of
the Alliance, by their repressive form of government. Chiefly, however
to the American people the Alliance look for sympathy in their hour o
- So long as one section of that soft-hearted nation, resolves on
securing harmony of opinion by martial law, and on annihilating at any
sacrifiee all political dissenters, the Alliance can afford to groan at the
derision of its most cheerful adversaries.
In conclusion, the Alliance cannot refrain from expressing the mental
anguish which they suffer owing to the gay and sportive tone con-
tinually adopted by HER MAJESTY's Prime Minister. Petitions of
remonstrance are now ready, and lie in the dark chamber of the Council,
to which signatures are earnestly desired. The conſidence which the
country at large has derived from the Volunteer movement, still acts
rejudicially against the interests of the Alliance, and large numbers who,
§: it originated, were inclined to give us their adherence, now
regard us with a lively air of scorn. One provincial town, however,
which lucus à non lucendo, while looking, on the Bright side of things,
wears the dullest aspect, is still honourably bent on keeping faith with
the Alli by not manifesting any patriotic spirit at i. It is hoped
that the º Member for Rochdale will, next Session, succeed in
extinguishing the present crowing administration, and that the down-
fall of the playful Bottleholder, will restore that gloom to our political
prospects, which if History may be credited, his Tory Opponent since
the repeal of the Corn Laws, has for any considerable time been
powerless to create.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mogen's PET. “Oh, there's Ma on the Beach looking at us, Alfred; let's make the Boat lean over tremendously on one side 1"
BOLTON AND
THE spinning-mule made Bolton.
spinning-mule. -
SAMUEL CROMETON lived a struggling, over-reached, and harassed
life, was supported in his old age by charity, and owes the unshaped
block of Lancashire grit that covers his grave, and symbolises the
rugged, unyielding, but massive mind of the man, to the same fund
which found him in bitter bread during the latter days of his ill-starred
and ill-requited labours.
SAMUEL CROMPTON, died in 1827 at the age of 74, and now Bolton,
whose master-manufacturers cheated him living, houours him dead by a
statue. On that spinning-mule are built up her acres of mills and
her miles of machinery, the wages of her tens of thousands of hands
and the fortunes of her hundreds of Cotton Lords. Nobody can say
that Bolton has been too quick to pay even this much of her debt to
SAMUEL CROMPTON, but better late than never. It would be ungracious
to remind her how SAMUEL CROMPTON was allowed to live, and
in what circumstances he died. But SAMUEL CROMETON left more
behind him than his great invention, and the memory of his wrongs and
struggles. He begat sons and daughters as well as invented mules.
He died a pauper, and they have fared as the children of those who
die paupers are apt to do.
Of course it will be supposed that when Bolton takes to honour
the memory of SAMUEL CROMPTON with an image of him in granite, the
images he left of himself in flesh and blood have not been forgotten.
But Bolton does not visit the benefits of the father upon the children.
One of SAMUELCROMPTON's sons is living a dependent on charity, as his
father died. Somebody bought him a suit of clothes that he might
make a decent appearance at the inauguration of his father's statue.
Besides this son, there are living some half a dozen grandchildren,
some dozen great-grandchildren, of the inventor—all, with one excep-
tion, in poverty of the meanest, most pinching kind. Not one of them,
son, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren, was invited to the inaugu-
ration of SAMUEL CROMPTON's statue. It seems that only by accident
was the fact of their existence made known to the meeting which
attended the unveiling of the monument:
The Committee, no doubt, were equally ignorant. If they had known
that SAMUEL CROMPTON had a son living, and had been cognisant of
ITS BENEFACTOR.
SAMUEL CROMPTON made the
that son's plight, and the plight of the grandchildren and great-
grandchildren, of course they would have sought them out, with help
and encouragement—would have kindly seen that they had places at
the inauguration and the feast, would have taken care that some ray of
the warmth of gratitude, now tardily turned towards the inventor of
the mule, should reach and cheer the cold hearths of his descendants.
It would be an insult to the good taste and good feeling of Bolton to
suppose that while any of SAMUEL QRoMPTON's children asked for
bread, Bolton could, wittingly, have offered them a stone—even in the
flattering shape of SAMUELCROMPTON's statue. - -
Bolton will, no doubt, prove that we are right in attributing to igno-
rance the absence of all recognition or help to SAMUEL CROMPTON's living
descendants. We shall soon hear of the Crompton Fund for assuring
bread, clothes, and shelter, to the son, and education, and a º
hand in life to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren... Nor need
the contributions to such a fund be confined to Bolton. All Cottonia
owes its pounds and its mites to the same cause. En attendant, let
Bolton and the cotton counties remember, that while SAMUEL CROMP-
ToN’s statue looks down on one of SAMUEL CROMPTON's children,
whether in the first, second or third generation, wrestling with distress or
growing up in the ignorange of grievous poverty, it is rather a monument
of their own shame than of SAMUEL CRomPTON's inventive power.

A BRUTAL LMPROVEMENT. |
|
THE attention of farmers and landed º is called to the
subjoined extract from the report of a speech, made at Melton Mowbray
the other day, at the Leicestershire and Waltham Agricultural Asso-
ciation dinner:— |
“The noble Duke also adverted to the fox-hunting for which the country round
Melton was famed. He complained that the custom of erecting wire fences was
atly injuring sport, as they were extremely dangerous to the horses and to
uman life.”
Steel traps and spring guns have been abolished by Act of Parliament.
If the lives of country gentlemen are not worth very much, they are at
least more yaluable than those of thieves. To procure the needful
abolition of the wire fences which barbarous agriculturists set in
horsemen's way, the fox-hunters throughout the kingdom, should form
themselves into a Fox Club in opposition to a practice which is as bad
as that of digging pitfalls.

ouR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
EAR PUNch,--That excel-
lent actor, MR. BENJAMIN
WEBSTER, has, for one day
only, been performing in
the provinces with most
complete success.
character which he ap:
eared in was that of
aster of the Royal Dra-
matic College, which on
Monday week was opened
under his direction, in a
manner that I thought Was
well deserving of applause.
The first seven of the
twenty who are there to
beannuitants were received
and housed without form-
ality or fuss, and so were
made to feel that the homes
which are provided are in-
tended for their comfort,
and that, they will not be
disturbed by any flourish-
ing of charitable trumpets
in their ears.
ti “Of º: *...*.
ous people Sa the
College *. tº: built
more for the glory of its
founders than the comfort of its inmates, and that the money which has
been laid out in bricks and mortar might have been better distributed
in doles of out-of-door relief...I don't think this myself, for mere alms-
iving is not the object of the charity, which is intended to provide a
ouse for such old actors as by God's will are left homeless in the last
years of their life. A second object is to furnish, education for their
children, and I hope to see the time when the College down at May-
bury will turn out as good. scholars as Trinity itself. But in the
theatrical as well as other #. there is many a poor struggler in
want of weekly help; and if the captious people who object to bricks
and mortar would find the funds for giving out-of-door relief, the
might emulate the good work of the patrons of the College, whic
surely would be better than merely finding fault.
“As you know everything, my Punch, of course I need not tell you
that when actors first appeared in England, some three centuries ago,
they were by law permitted to play only in the yards of churches or of
inns. Hamlet was not written then, or the grave scene might have
fittingly been shown in a churchyard, and perhaps a real clergyman
would have consented to appear in it. This is really not improbable,
for actors then were more in favour with the Church than, it is feared
they are at present: a fact which, so the cynics say, is partially accounted
for by the º that the clergyman received a handsome fee when-
ever his churchyard was occupied by players. Let us hope this favour
may in due time be revived, and that the clergy will be sensible what
help in moral teaching the stage, if rightly managed, is able to afford
them. Segniis irritant—you know how HoRACE puts it: and much as
many parsons may now condemn and execrate it, 1 am sure that a good
play well mounted and well acted is capable not merely of giving people
pleasure but of doing them much good. At any rate our clergy ought
not to forget that Charity will cover a multitude of sins: and when they
fulminate their wrath against the evils of the play-house (which daily
are decreasing, and will I trust ere long die out) let them bear in mind
the fact that of all trades and professions there is none which is in
charity so liberal as the stage. Its members may be vain, may be weak,
may be erring: few have such temptations, none are more in danger of
being spoilt by popularity, and ruined by applause. But whatever be
their faults, their charity should serve to cloak them from the sight of
those less hardly tempted, 'º.'". not less liable to fall. Many
a poor player from his two shillings a night will freely give a poorer
layer help when in worse need than he is in himself: and how actors
elp each other and work for a good cause this newly opened College is
now a standing proof.
“Merely hinting that the College is not yet quite completed, and that
there are several acres in the hands of its trustees quite fit to be built
over when the public finds the funds (the name of the treasurer is J. W.
ANSON, so draw }. cheque-books, gentlemen, and prepare to sign) I
remain with the best wishes to the stage and all its charities,
“ONE who PAYs.”
“P.S. For the benefit of posterity. I must just note the fact that Lord
Dundreary has been playing for two hundred and fifty nights, while Peep
o' Day will reach three hundred before the month is out. I would add
too, as a fact remarkable in history, that Italian Operas have been heard
The Mell
this year, in London the first week in October: while at the Royal
English Opera, old and young men from the country may hear those
purely English operas Fra Diavolo, and Dinorah, not to mention, La
Sonnambula and Les Diamans de la Couronne. Sweet-voiced Miss
Louisa PYNE never could sing badly if she were to try; and having
recovered from her illness, she now sings all the better for not singing
every night. As for MR. MELLON, his orchestra is really now so
rich in goºd performers, that one may almost call him an orchestral
onaire.”

DEWOTION TO SCIENCE.
At one of the meetings of the British Association last week, Dr.
Edward SMITH said—
“In certain cases tobacco acts as a stimulant, and may supply to the Literary
Man the state of system at night which would be induced by a moderate quantity
of alcoholic stimulants, but when the body is of full habit it must lead to disturbed
sleep and may lead to apoplexy." -
DR. PUNCH said that as a literary man of full habit (applause) he
should like to ask his friend DR. SMITH, whether the unpleasant con-
sequences he indicated might not be obviated by taking both the cigar
and a moderate quantity of alcoholic stimulants.
DR. Edward SMITH said that he had not directed his attention to
that question, and thought that experiments bearing upon it might be
conducted with interest and with advantage.
DR. PUNCH, in the most liberal manner, immediately undertook to
prosecute them, and departed to his hotel with that view. . He was
shortly joined by DR. SMITH, and the distinguished philosophers pur-
sued their investigations until a late hour.
FOLLOW MY LEADER.
A GRAND ball was held the other day at the Imperial Villa at
Biarritz, and according to a letter from that place:–
“The toilettes of the ladies were richer than ever. Hair powder seems to be
coming into vogue again, for many of the ladies used it on this occasion.”
Very probably. The admirable revival of hoops should naturally be
followed by a return to hair-powder. The sequacious gregariousness
with which the French ladies follow their leader, and the English ladies
them, is, though a goose-like, a º attestation of their attach-
o
ment to the Crinoline Dynasty. Venus forbid that the EMPRESS OF
THE FRENch should wear rings in her nose;
but if she were to adopt
such ornaments her example would doubtless be followed by our wives
and daughters.

A SKETCH AT BIARRITZ.
THE END OF EVERYTHING.
DEAR DR. CUMMING,
WHAT are you about? Resting on your oars, I hope in smooth
water, and reposing after your pull upon the uncertain but profitable
sea of prophetical speculation. Well, the scarlet old Person seems
likely to have to remove from the Seven Hills with her basket of fish
before long; though she won’t take the broad hints that have been given
her, and has not as yet had actual notice to quit. So much for her;
but now let me congratulate you on the triumph which has crowned
your labours in the ſalidical line it is recorded by the Times, in a
paragraph of which I have great pleasure in quoting the subjoined
commencement:–
“ DEMoLITIon of the Great GLoBE.—A number of workmen have been engaged
during the last few days in the destruction of this well-known building in Leicester
Square, and yesterday the hazardous operation of stripping the dome of its metal
covering was completed.”
The º year is earlier by a few twelve months, I believe, than
that which you fixed for the end of the world; but what of that ?
Astronomers, in foretelling the return of a comet, cannot be exact to
Greenwich time; and not, every sporting Wates is able to state the
precise length of head, head and neck, or shoulders, that the right horse
for the Derby will win by. The Great Globe has been demolished at a
date quite near enough to that which you fixed for the destruction of
our earth, H. to verify your prediction with sufficient accuracy.
And, what I consider º interesting, this satisfactorily explains
the inconsistency which certain shallow critics have remarked in your
prudent investment, of the money which you have earned by your
literary industry. The Great Globe is demolished; but your invest-
ments remain. Long may they remain, and long may you live to enjoy
them, and to read the observations of your admirer, 33&ANC#.
P.S. ZADKIEL is just out. So are not you.

A LADY º BEDFQRD SQUEERs) defends the present extravagant
length of ladies' dresses by saying that it is a very old fashion, originally
brought into vogue by NINoN DE LONG CLOTHEs.
1854 AND 1862.
AMONG the distinguished visitors who are just now honouring us with
their presence in this country (come, Punch can do the elegant thing
when he likes) is that gallant Russian officer, GENERAL LIPRANDI, who
is shooting in Scotland. The valiant commander's name was, a few
years ago, associated with a day on which he tried, in the service of his
own Sovereign, to do us all the mischief he could, and he went at his
work like a man, and it is no discredit to him that the result was not
quite satisfactory to the EMPEROR of ALL THE RUssIAs. Mr. Punch
commemorated the event in a little poem destined to live to all time, but
as that tremendous hero, CoLoREL North (whose unutterably glorious
military achievements entitle him to be heard on such a subject) objects
to memorials of the Crimean war, and thinks that the Sebastopol
cannon, now sprinkled over the country, ought to be called in, like the
old copper coinage, Mr. Punch, begs to modify his original strain, and
to make it polite, in honour of a brave soldier no longer an enemy:-
“Remember, remember
The Fifth of November,
Inkermann, powder, and shot,
When GENERAL LIPRAND1
Fought John, PAT, and SANDY —
And—gave it ’em awfully hot.”
A Smooth Way of Getting Out of it.
A PoET, who is prematurely bald, excuses it in this ingenious and
complimentary manner:—“Baldness (he says) is only a proof of polite-
ness paid to the beautiful sex. Is it not the duty of a gentleman always
to uncover his head in the presence of the ladies?”

CUTTING—VERY.
“So Mary Jane, your Policeman has been taken off this beat/ As you're fond of Low Company, you had better ask the new 'un to Supper.'
MONSIEUR JACK KETCH, HOMME DE LETTRES.
THE French are great devourers of Mémoires, we are well aware, but
we little suspected that their taste would ever sink so low as to devour
Les Mémoires de Mons. Sanson. The SANsons have held in France
the hereditary post of public executioner for ages past. Long before
the Reign of Terror, the CALCRAFT of France was represented by a
SANson. It would seem, however, that business has lately been so
bad—the stereotyped tag of circonstances atténuantes which a French
jury almost invariably appends to its verdict, even in the most flagrant
cases, has robbed the executioner of so many of his dread perquisites—
that the family has in despair been compelled to send in its r-signation.
Distress has driven the SANsons to adopt as their motto “Live and
let Live;” and hence, by way of eking out a living, the publication of
these revolting memoirs. At one time we had our Newgate school of
literature that made heroes of thieves and highwaymen. In the like
manner, it would seem that the literature of France, after frequentin
the lowest of low haunts, and revelling in every possible profligacy j
vice, has at last gone to the gallows. It has received its final coup de
gráce.ſrom the guillotine. Does, it not, appear only a just gradation,
and fit termination, in scaling the ladder of immorality, that writers
like DUMAs fils and the authors of Fanny and Madame de Bovary, should
be succeeded by a SANsoN ?. It is the growning degradation. The last
act of justice that Mons. SANSON, before retiring from office, should
have performed, ought to have been to burn his own Mémoires. .
Soon Done with Him.
The following advertisement appears in the Times, and admits of the
promptest answer:-
IME AND CAPITAL.-A gentleman, having £500 at his command,
is anxious to employ that and his time advantageously. Address, &c.
Let him call at 85, Fleet Street, hand the £500 to the publisher,
receive in return the back volumes of Panch, and occupy himself in
reading those books until the end of what will thus be made a happy life.
SYKES ON THE SPIKES.
It is extremely easy to find fault with people, who have done much
for not doing more, but Punch has seldom seen a case in which this
pleasing duty was more coolly performed than by Coloneſ, Sykes at
the British Institution. The discourse was on MR.GLAIsher's
balloon ascents, and that gentleman had modestly detailed his per-
formance with MR. Coxwell, and how they had been almost frozen
to death at a height of six miles, beyond which he did not believe it
safe to ascend. “Oh, bother,” says Colonel Sykes, “people may f
up at least seven miles and a half. You two fellows may have felt cold,
perhaps, but then I dare say you’re a chilly lot. Don't limit folks by
your own personal feelings.” Hearing this, Punch naturally began to
consider who the brave Sykes was, and remembered that he was a
gentleman of 72, who had been a gallant soldier in India, variously dis:
tinguished in civil matters, and who sat for Aberdeen. But Mr. Punch
was unable to discover any particular motive for the Colonel's scoff at the
aéronauts, until, looking to DoD, the former read, “Served gratuitously
as a Foºl Commissioner in †. A gentleman who would attend
to lunatic matters for nothing may be permitted wild ideas about the
ease of approaching the moon.
The American Chess-Players.
ALTHOUGH of conquest Yaukee North despairs,
His brain for some expedient wild he racks,
And thinks that having failed on the white squares,
He can't do worse by moving on the Blacks.
A QUESTION FOR CATTLE CLUBS.
A FARMER in the neighbourhood of Lyons is said to have discovered
an expeditious method of fattening cattle, which consists in giving, them
cod-liver oil. Perhaps the good done by this substance in phthisis
pulmonalis is more apparent than real; but experience will show
whether its administration tends to promote or arrest the consumption
of butcher's meat. .

COCKNEY CRITICISM.
AMONG. the notices of new music wherewith some of our contempo-
raries at times delight the world, we see it said of one “morceau pour
le piano,” that— -
“The sparkling roulades of the birds are rendered with great effect.”
“Sparkling roulades of the birds !” Well, what next we wonder
We suppose we shall soon hear of the vibrato of the nightingale, and
the sostenuto notes of the blackbird or the thrush. Qr we may live to
see it said of a Prize Canary Show, that such and such a feathered
songster had an exquisite organ, and won repeated plaudits by the
vehemence and clearness of its ut de poitrine. Song-writers may, more-
over, be catching the infection, and may speak of sylvan harmony in
thejargon of the concert-room, and apply to nature the hackneyed terms
of art. Instead of the simple ...,
“Hark, the lark at Heaven's gate sings,”
we shall be hearing some such stilted stuff as this:—
“Hark, the high soprano lark to Heaven's gate upward flies,
And executes his brilliant fioriture in the skies."
The boshiness of ballad-writing long since has disgusted us; and
nonsense such as this would be really scarce more silly than much of
the fine language we have lately seen in verse.
MEMBERS FOR SALE.
CHELTENHAM has a Member, we don't know why, but it is genteel
to have one. The place, however, is rather too near Berkeley Castle,
and its influences, to make its Member of any great political signi-
ficance. We did not think, however, that the successive Members for
Cheltenham were liable to be sold, like crops, growing and future, until
we came upon the following advertisement:—
Mºś BEADEL and SONS are instructed to SELL by AUCTION,
at the Mart, London, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, at 12 for one, first in one lot, and if
not so sold, then in several lots, the following very valuable PROPERTIES:—The
manor of CHELTENHAM CUM MEMBRIs, with all royalties, courts leet, courts
baron, &c., &c., &c.
There! Cheltenham Manor, and the Members. All going. We shall
attend, and see what FRANK BERKELEY fetches. He's a good ſellow
and a Boodle, and sooner than see him knocked down for a song, we’
have him, and he shall sit for Punch, an honour to which his relative
HENRY BERKELEY aspires, but he is not up to the work. But, talk of
the Southern States, here are white Members disposed of by public
auction. We live in times which, not to put too fine a point upon it,
may be designated-rum.
THE WAY TO ROME AND VENICE.
CoME, there is something in the annexed passage from MAzzINI's
Manifesto to the Italians, not altogether so absurd:—
“If at GARIBALDI's first generous cry you had risen º willing and unanimous—if
the ardent and languid alike, forgetting for the time all strife, º understood that
that cry must either not be raised or rendered irresistible, at this moment Rome
would be yours without war, and history would not register the shameful record,
which long sacrifices alone can cancel, that GARIBALDI, the living incarnation of our
unity, was wounded by an Italian bullet on the path to Rome."
It is not too late, for the Italians to take the really by no means
extravagant advice which is implied in the foregoing words. What is
to prevent every young man Jack orgiovanotto-every man indeedable to
bear arms-from learning how to use the rifle? Qut of upwards of twenty
millions, if every man whose voice is for Italian unity could back it
with a hand capable of putting a bullet anywhere near a bull's eye at a
few hundred yards, Rome and Venice too would very soon be theirs
“without war.” Our Italian friends should, without delay, turn to,
and enrol themselves in volunteer rifle corps. If the EMPERoR or The
FRENCH persists in holding Rome any time, they will have that time
to practise in, and will ultimately be in a position to invite him to go
away, and likewise to send the EMPEROR of AUSTRIA a polite request
to walk out of Venice. Their Imperial Majesties will not disregard the
invitation of a people including more than a million of riflemen.
A MAD BULL IN THE CITY.
TheRE is not generally much that is lively in the Money Article of a
newspaper. An exception to that rule will perhaps recognised in
the subjoined statement, which occurred one day last week in the
“Money Market and City News” of the Post:—
“We stated a few days since that a ‘bull' account to some extent was opened in
Consols by a respectable broker, who was somewhat eccentric in his dealings. The
amount of stock open is now understood to be £250,000 Consols. The party alluded
to addressed a letter to the Committee of the Stock Exchange, which is stated to
have been couched in very unusual and incoherent terms as regards the making up
of his account, which had the effect of depressing the market to the extent of nearly
a quarter per cent., as the stock open will doubtless have to be closed ; and until
this is done it is likely to keep quotations somewhat unsettled."
A bull account indeed!—or rather a bull's account, to speak, more
accurately. A gentleman “somewhat eccentric in his dealings,” who
opens an account and unsettles the Money-Market to the extent of
£250,000 Consols, and then, with reference to the making up of that
account, writes the Committee of the Stock Exchange a letter “couched
in very unusual and incoherent terms,” seems fearfully likely to turn
out to be, so to speak, a bull in a China shop.

having been lighted, and a plentiful supply of beer. and spirits being ordered, the
business of the meeting was commenced by a discussion as to who should be
invited to occupy the Chair. After a dispute, which was at times, rather highly
spiced with personalities, the choice, ultimately rested upºn MR. Twistex
STRANGLEs, otherwise known to the Police as the Knock-knee'd, Knockemdowner,
who is one of the most accomplished garotters now in town. In his opening speech
the Chairman called attention to the fact that there was now existing, as he thought,
a most objectionable wish upon the part of the respectable, classes in the country
oans) to deprive himself and pals of many of their privileges, and among them
their invaluable certificates of leave. (Hear!) He for one protested warmly against
such interference with his liberties and rights as a freeborn British subject; and he
would call on any gentleman who had anything to say upon this important subject,
to s up like a man, for no police were present. (Hear!)
R. WILLIAM Sykes observed that, as a burglar of long descent, he thoroughly
concurred in what the Chairman had revealed, as to the great value to himself and
other members of the housebreaking community, of those certificates of character
which were called Tickets-of-leave. He, MR. Sykes, was himself a living instance
of their excellence and worth. (Hear!) But for them he would that ºf have
been buried in seclusion in a chamber, at his friend's the Governor of Cold Bath
Fields, instead of comfortably sitting at his usual house of call, and enjoying the
society of old and valued, chums. (Hear, hear! and cries of Here’s your 'elth, old
brick/). For a trifling indiscretion committed in hot youth, when, after an attempt
to crack a country crib, he had knocked down a policeman and stamped upon his
stomach, he (MR. SYKEs) was sentenced to imprisonment for life; but by coming
the religious dodge, and gammoning the chaplain, he had obtained his freedom after
three years spent in gaol, and had resumed his old vocation with encouraging
success. (Cheers.) - -
MR. GRAB concurred in thinking that the Ticket-of-leave system was most
eminently serviceable to gentlemen of his profession, and ought by all means in their
power to be fostered and encouraged. He would suggest that LoRD PALMERSTON
or some other noble swell should, ifſ: be got at, and be asked to pass an act
for the protection of tters, and for facilitating the acquirement of certificates of
leave. He thought that if a cove attended chapel regular, the first month he was

entitle him to have a ticket, and his § should be rewarded with, to say the least

beer to him, if it did him no more good. , (Hear, Hear ſ!
MR. CENTREBIT remarked, in a casual sort of way, that he had cracked as many
cribs as any gentleman he knew, and for his expertness in pursuing his vocation he
was indebted mainly to the Ticket of leave system, but for which he would be still
a resident in quod. (Hear. -
MR.JUDAs SMouch obsherved that he had long enjoyed the happinesh to deal
with MR. CENTREBIT and other shentlemen who wanted to disposhe of.shtolen
oods: and he felt pershuaded that his intereshts would shuffer if the Ticket-of-
eave shystem were to be abolished. - --
MR, SMASHER said that as for England, being a free, country, he indignantly
denied the fact. Coves bragged about the . enjoyed by British subjects, but
at every street.corner you were safe to see a crusher ready any moment to cart you
off to quod. (Shame /). He, MR. SMASHER, had no wish to complain; but a cove,
you know, must live (a voice, “Ercept as he gets scragged”), and he really thought
that parties who called theirselves respectable, had no right to take such pains for
the protection of their property (hear, hearſ), and so deprive him and his pals of a
comfortable livelihood. (Cheers.) If it wasn't that by means of a certificate of leave,
a cove could now get out of quod almost as soon as he got into it, England reall
would become a country not worth living in; for what with patent safety locks, an
crushers, and detectives, people took such blessed care of their own º: that
they scarcely gave a cove a chance of getting hold of it. (Cheers and cries ºf shameſ)
Swag concurred most fully with the words of the last speaker, and he might
perhaps have added a few words of his own, but he and MR. CENTREBIT had a job
on hand that evening, and so their time was precious. ... He would therefore briefly
i. the following Resolution, which his old pal SAM the Scollard had helped him
O graw up:— - - -
“That, in the opinion of this honourable meeting, the Ticket-of-leave system
works most admirably Well, and is essential to the interests
of thieves of all descriptions; and this meeting considers
the attempt which is on foot to deprive them .# their pri-
vilege is a, flagrant violation of the rights of free-born
Britºns, and as such ought to be opposed by every proper-
minded person.”
The resolution, being Seconded by MR. FILCHER PRIg,
was then put formally to the meetin , and unanimously
carried; and the Chairman was ji. to elect a depu-
tation for waiting upon Parliament with a petition in the
matter, when it was suddenly announced that the Police
were approaching, whereupon the meeting separated in
some slight confusion.
JOHN BULL TO GARIBALDI.
MY DEAR, GARIBALDI, what shall I do,
Beyond what I’ve done, to satisfy you?
For many a year have I stretched my hands
To shake them with men of all other lands.
My Brothers, I’ve said, arise and be free,
Observe what I do, and imitateme.
Lay tyranny prostrate, and priestcraft low,
But bide ye your time ere you strike the blow.
Qh, kick all your despots off and afar
That drag you to die for their fame in war;
Renounce the vain glory that makes you slaves,
And tools that subserve Imperial knaves.
I’ve called ...France, º holloaed to Spain,
0 Germany cried again and again,
I call to the Yankees every day;
They turn a deaf ear to alſ that 1 say.
I'm evermore crying, Now, then, my mates,
Do, pray, leave off coating vessels with plates,
From forging new cannon let us all cease,
And carry on business, trading in peace.
Ferocious abuse and truculent threat
Is all the return I ever had yet,
Except from one Hero, true man alone,
Whose favour, received, these lines are to own.
CONVERSION OF THE FRENCH.
Young France's Hebrew Guardian, M. Fould, has
actually pulled the gay young fellow’s accounts almost
; and is teaching him to save money. We are
delighted with the balance-sheet just issued, and expect to
see edifying results. In private life most of us have had
the 3. of beholding such reforms. Some prudent
friend takes hold of young CHARLEY RATTLETON, and con-
verts him to economy, and how we smile. CHARLEY, who
never had any money in his pocket, except just enough to
muddle away in º cabmen too much, buying cigars
when, he should have stuck to Cavendish, and travelling
t-class when his betters were going second, suddenly
becomes prudent-looks at the change that is given him,
wears his second best hat on a wet day, and actually walks
instead of taking a Hansom. He gives you, mysterious
hints about his stock-broker, pretends to read the share-
list, and in general conversation tries, it on with Bank-
parlour slang, which, as no two people mean the same by
any financial definition, answers very well, and awes the
women. We hope to see young France come out in
similarly respectable fashion, and instead of talking swagger
about shooting in Mexico, volunteering in Italy, and other
expensive diversions, begin to be grave, and speak of Postal
Savings' Banks, Water-company Shares, Street Drainage,
and such like desiderata in Paris. Talk of Converting the
Jews, what shall be done unto a Jew who has converted a
Christian nation—and a lot of its debt?
Books for the Sick.
(A joke attempted by “a bad sailor” coming over to Folkestone.)
We see a long announcement of Books under, this title.
We had, for an obvious reason, thought that all Educational
works deserved the name. For what is education except—

ABE'S LAST CARD; OR, ROUGE ET-NOIR.
JUST THE FAITH FOR FRANCE,
It is too commonly asserted that our lively neighbours, the French,
have no religion. If this assertion were true, their want of a faith
would now be in the way of getting very soon supplied. According to
the Paris Correspondent of a contemporary:—
“A prophet from Utah, º: to the Parisians the mysteries of Mormonism,
has appeared in this novelty loving metropolis. Fearing that the police would not
allow the public dissemination of the marvellous doctrines of his sect, he has com-
mitted to the press a volume which seems to promise to have an extraordinary
circulation, if its contents are correctly stated. M. BERTRAND, the missionary in
uestion, is a Frenchman, and BRIGHAM YouNo has dispatched him from the Great
t Lake to preach the doctrine of the last days of the saints, and to prove that
polygamy and public property ought to supersede the old European doctrine of a
single * and every man keeping for himself what his honest industry can
accumulate."
If the French drama is a mirror which reflects French Society, it is
not too much to say that Mormonism is just the religion that the people
of France, as many of them as have none, might be expected to º:
They have been quite prepared to receive it by the preaching of the
“Emancipation of the Flesh;" a doctrine which has become very
popular. M., BeRTRAND will doubtless make many converts to the
creed of Joe SMITH, and would make more iſ the Ultramontane priests
were allowed to roast him; for the dripping of heretics is the prolific
principle of heresy.
There is one expression in the paragraph above-quoted, which we are
anxious to, rectify. Polygamy is placed in antithesis to, “the old
European doctrine of a single wiſe.” We must be allowed to remark
that the old doctrine of Europe in general is that of a married wiſc.
the doctrine of a single wiſe prevails anywhere it must be in Ireland.
In ºrs this observation, we trust we shall not be deemed hyper-
critical.
Forgiveness of Injuries.
So an amnesty is granted to GARIBALDI. Wery good. In England,
when we have trodden on the toe of a great man, we beg, his pardon.
In Italy you pardon him when you have shot him in the ankle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A THEATRICAL ELECTION.
MR. PUNCH observes that the paternal Government of France (which
obligingly interferes in everything, from an astronomer's theories on the
movement of the world to the sou balloons flown by the children in the
Tuileries #. has stepped into one of the provincial theatres. There
has been a Tweedledum and Tweedledee battle, touching the comparative
merits of a brace of “robust tenors,” and the partisans of each have
resorted to that form of criticism which is expressed by hissing every note
of his rival. So awful a crisis demanded the deuser machiná, and he has
appeared. An edict prohibits anybody from hissing at all, and “the
votes of the º: public” are to be regularly taken at a
bureau, after which the successful candidate will be declared duly
elected, and entitled to sing, with the whole force of the Government
of France for a claque.
Mr. Punch laughed, of course, and then began to speculate upon the
exceedingfood fun which might be got out of some similar arrangement
in England.
Suppose that MR. CHARLEs, KEAN and MR. Robson were engaged at
the same theatre, and it were desired to produce some play a little above
the range of either artist, but still one in which respective admirers
might like to see their favourite. Let us say Othello. To please both
sides, the management has put up the tragedy every night, the two
actors alternately playing the Moor of Venice. MR. Robson’s friends
have commented upon MR. KEAN's readings with a volley of Barcelona
nuts, and MR. KEAN's admirers, who are stated to be more of the aristo-
cratic order, have retaliated with the best Seville oranges. The public
is scandalised, the papers daily make mirth or seriousness of the “dis-
raceſul proceedings,” and at length SIR. RICHARD MAYNE clears the
theatre, and SIR GeoRGE GREY orders that an election for the Repre-
sentation of Othello shall take place, appointing MR. PAUL BEDFORD
(by the kind permission of MR.WEBSTER) Returning Officer. The day
of election is fixed for Michaelmas Day, being the Festival of St. Michael
º All Goose, and the place of voting is 85, Fleet Street
by the kind permission of Mr. Punch). The play-going public is
commanded to choose between Robson and KEAN.
The votes are taken over Mr. Punch's counter, and as the clock of
St. Bridget, or Bride strikes ten, the doors are opened by the Boy,
who saves his life by a miracle of Leotardiness, and the foremost
electors, forcibly º: by the behinder ones, hastily bang their
stomachs against Mr. Punch's mahogany, and are brought up short,
and with red faces.
“Take your time, my
after-breakfast cigar. “

“I believe you, my boys!” remarks the Returning Officer.
“For whom do you poll,” is duly asked of a stout party who has
described himself as John Świrh, of Highbury.
“Robson l’ roars SMITH, in a determined manner. There is a
#. shout for first blood, and Mr. Punch, jumping on the counter,
eclares that he will have none of those indecent manifestations of party
feeling. They are convoked for a solemn duty, and there is a police
station just over the way.
The next voter is PETER WILcox, of Brompton.
respºnd; - -
º Weil, Sir, I think MR. Robson plays some characters very finely,
and indeed in his own line—”
“We don't want your theatrical opinions, but your vote,” thunders
Mr. Punch.
“Mrs. Wilcox, Sir, who is more of a playgoer than I am—”
“More shame for you, leaving your poor wife to go to the play by
herself. You are an unworthy character, and shan’t vote. Turn him
into Fleet Street,” exclaims Mr. Punch.
“My name is Jersey WoRBLEToN, I live in the Temple, and I vote
for CHARLEs KEAN, because l knew his father.”
“The assigning such a reason is proof of idiotcy,” remarks Mr.
Punch, “and disqualifies the voter.”
SAMUEL VERTEBRATE, of Clapham, also tenders his vote for MR.
KEAN, on the ground that he did not know his father.
: Then you ought to have known his father,” roars Mr. Punch.
“But, Sir, I am only five-and-twenty.”
“More shame for you, and don’t do it again. You may vote.”
EBENEZER CULLCHIckweed, of Hammersmith.
“I object to that vote,” says a voice. “The law says a play-goer.
That party ain't no play-goer. He objects to theatres, says they are
. of vice, and at best a waste of time. He has no right to say
nothing.”
-- Fºº, EBENEzeR,” says Mr. Punch.
“I admit the facts, and vote for MR. KEAN, because, being less
attractive than MR. Robson, he will ensnare the fewer, Sir.”
... Have you been to the theatres to discover this?”
. “Yes, Sir, but to avoid encouraging their wickedness, I always went
in with an order, and hissed.”

noise mean?”
Some Voices. “Women ought not to vote.” -
“But they shall vote,” storms Mr. Punch, in a fearful rage. “It is
a woman's question. The theatres are *f; up by the women, Who'd
go to a theatre when he could smoke, at his club in peace, if he hadn't
to convoy his females? Come up, M’m, and I'll disfranchise anybody
who even pushes you. What's your name *
: MATILDA JEMIMA JUDKINs, Kennington Oval.”
“I believe you, my girl! ” said the Returning Officer.
“And you vote for ——,” asks Mr. Punch.
“MR. Robson, of course. Bless you, Sir-"
“I am sure I am very much obliged to you, M'm. -
“Oh, he is so funny. I declare that when he played in something, I
forget the name of the piece, but I think it was something about
Mr. Benson, so it might be the Clockmaker's Hat; no, it couldn't be
that, because it was something about obliging Mr. Benson. Well, it
doesn’t matter what the name of the piece was, but I know I laughed
till the tears ran down my face.” - -
“And, therefore, M’m,” said Mr. Punch, smiling, “you think he
ought to play. Othello 'º'
“Well, a clever man’s a clever man all the world over, and a person
who can play one thing can play another.”
“Can you play cribbage, MRs. JUDKINs?”
“Yes, Sir, pretty well... I like it.”
“Can you play the ophicleide, MRs. JUDKINs 2" - -
“You ought to be ashamed to ask a woman such a question, Sir.
What, that great snorting thing?—Lor! are you mad?”
“As is cribbage to ophicleide, so is Benson to Othello, M’m; but you
do not argue badly for a lady critic, and as I am aware that you
express the sense of a large portion of your sex, you may vote.
Eh, PAUI,?” - -
“I believe you, my boy!” said the Returning Officer.
Various incidents maiked the day's polling, and some trouble was
occasioned by a young gent from an attorney's office who insisted that
MR. Bedford ought to play. Othello, and who would vote for nobody
else. A splendid testimonial that had been presented to MR. KEAN, by
his friends, was paraded before the door in the course of the day, but
was instantly removed by Mr. Punch's orders, as being an intimidating
device. Several actors voted, but under protest that though their can-
didate might be better than the other, neither was fit to hold a candle
to themselves. Two Shaksperian commentators desired to make their
votes conditional on the candidate's coming to the voter, and being
coached up in the part, of which, in the voter's opinion, he knew nothing.
Three fast men, who understood that the play was Othello according to
Act of Parliament, refused to poll when they heard that it was only that
awful old blank-verse bosh. An admirer of new readings insisted on
the candidate for whom he voted undertaking that Othello should hang
himself, but was utterly smashed by Mr. Punch's reply that the Moor,
at the time of his suicide, was already suspended from the command of
the Venetian army. The candidates kept pretty near together, and the
struggle waxed very fierce as the hour of closing drew near, when
bribery was said to be freely resorted to, partisans of MR. Robson
offering tickets to see him in Daddy Hardacre, and friends of MR. KEAN
tendering admissions to his performance of Louis the Eleventh. Even
on these terms, the best either side could offer, no very great difference
in the numbers occurred until 3:30, when Mr. Punch, throwing away
the butt-end of his seventy-fourth cigar, demanded to vote. The crowd
gave way,
“I poll for MR. KEAN. (Sensation.) Unhesitatingly. . His per-
formance is after my own heart, and (modestly) I do not think that I
could play Othello much better than he does.”
From this moment the election was j} settled, and when St.
Bride's struck four, and Mr. Punch ordered his now triumphant Boy
to avenge his morning wrongs by kicking the public into the street,
it was º that MR. KEAN was elected to play. Othello. The
declaration of the poll and the addresses of the candidates were, of
course, postponed. -
“A hard day's work, MR. BEDFord,” said Mr. Punch. “Will you
come up to my room, and have some Hock and Seltzer?”
“I believe you, my boy!” said the Returning Qfficer.
Why shouldn't we have this sort of thing in England? Why are the
French to have all the fun?
The Bishop Most Eager for Translation.
No, we don't mean you, Doctor —. It must be that poor little
foolish converted English Bishop whom his Popish employers have used
as a Bourbon tool, and who is lying in an Italian prison under a heavy
sentence. Couldn't he be let out, Italia? You don't keep cages for
such very helpless little rats as that ? RATAzzi, for the sake of your
name, let him go. Translate that very little Bishop, and give him
letters dimissory to Rome. Please let him out. We wouldn’t ask it
if he were other than harmless, but what can be feared from such a
“convertite?”

SABBATARIAN ASSERTION.
At Edinburgh the other day, a meeting was held by numerous enemies of
religious liberty. The LoRD PRovost, according to the Times, presided over
them, and the assembly of bigots, comprised, the leading members of the Presby-
terian and other sects, including adherents of the Free Kirk desirous of abridging
the freedom of others. The object of these fanatics was to oppose a petition
signed by 1,400 of the working classes and addressed to the Lords of the Treasury,
asking that the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens shall be open on Sunday. This con-
course of Sabbatarians was harangued by Doctors MUIR, GUTHRIE, THQMSON,
and Begg, and by some sanctimonious and stupid bailies. They had the folly to
vote resolutions:—
“Expressing t and alarm that the gardens should be sought to be opened on the Lord's
Day . . . . and setting forth that such a proposal was opposed not only to the Divine command-
ment, but to the law and usages of Scotland, and the convictions and feelings, of the great
majority of the Scottish people, and that setting aside the authority of the Sabbath as a Divine
institution would remove the only efficient barrier which protects the working man from uninter-
rupted labour.”
The only truth which the foregoing statement contains, if it contains any, is the
assertion that a tyrannical Scotch majority is desirous of shutting the minority
of Scotchmen out of the Edinburgh #. Gardens on a Sunday. We trust,
however, that not even this is true, and that the population of Scotland does
not chiefly consist of fools no better than real thistle-eating asses. The last of
the above-quoted assertions is one of such a nature that those who concurred in it
would agree in saying anything, regardless of veracity, Why, Kew, Gardens have
long been open to the English Public on a Sunday. Does the English workman,
then, lead a life of uninterrupted laboul ? Perhaps the LoRD PRovost of EDIN:

In gymnastics your first notorieties.

If their feats rouse the public to frenzy,
What rapture a gibbon should raise!

Where monkey or man shows the way,

But from all points of difference one turns

For distinctions of brain—cerebellum—

THE MISSING LINK.
oUBT not which is the pre-
ferable side in the Gorilla
controversy. It is clearly
that of the philosophers who
maintain themselves to be
the descendants of a Gorilla.
This is the position which
commends itself to right-
minded men, because it
tends to expand the sphere
of their affections, inasmuch
as it gives them a broader
view of theirspecies. Hither-
to, however, there has been
one argument against the
Gorilla theory very difficult
to get over, namely, that
there is no known fact what-
ever which affords it the
least foundation. This is a
deficiency which we trust
we are about to supply.
A gulf, certainly, does ap-
pear to yawn between the
Gorilla and the Negro. The woods and wilds of Africa do not exhibit, an
example of any intermediate animal. But in this, as in many other
cases, philosophers go vainly searching abroad for that which they would
readily findiffney sºught for it at home. A creature manifestly between
the Gorilla and the Negro is to be met with in some of the lowest dis-
tricts of London and Liverpool by adventurous explorers. It comes
from Ireland, whence it has contrived to migrate; it belongs in fact
to a tribe of Irish savages: the lowest species of the Irish Yahoo.
When conversing, with its kind, it talks a sort of gibberish. It is,
moreover .#. animal, and may sometimes be seen ascending a
ladder laden with .. of bricks. - - - -
The Irish Yahoo generally confines itself within the limits of its own
colony, except when it goes out of them to get its living. Sometimes
however, it sallies forth in states of excitement, and attacks civilised
human beings that have provoked its fury. Large numbers of these
Yahoos have been lately collecting themselves in Hyde Park on a Sunday,
and molesting the people there assembled to express sympathy with
GARIBALDI and the cause of United Italy. The Yahoos are actuated
by an abject and truculent devotion to the Pope, which urges them to
fly at all manner of persons who object to grovel under the Papal
tyranny, and all others who assist or even applaud them in the attempt
to throw it off. Nevertheless they will howl for their own liberty to
do what they please like so many Calibans. They were organised by
the Pontifical Government to fight the Italians, at Castelſdardo, where
they failed, perhaps from want of sufficient dexterity to handle a rifle.
Here they assail the friends of the Italian monarchy with the weapons
which come more natural to them; clubs and stones. In this sort of
warfare they are more successful than they were on the field of battle;
and their numbers, strength, and ferocity have struck such terror into
the minds of the authorities, that the latter have judged it expedient to
yield to them. They have accordingly succeeded in the attempt to
stifle the expression of public sentiment by intimidation. It is not
wonderful that creatures so like the Gorilla should frighten anybody;
let alone the LoRD MAYoR. -
The somewhat superior ability of the Irish Yahoo to utter articulate
sounds, may suffice to prove that it is a developement, and not, as some
imagine, a degeneration of the Gorilla. - -
It is hoped that the discovery, in the Irish Yahoo, of the Missing
Link between Man and the Gorilla, will gratify the benevolent reader,
by suggesting the necessity, of an enlarged, definition of our fellow-
creatures, conceived in a truly liberal and catholic spirit.
Too Bad, Really!
Look alive, Yankeeſ work is not so slack -
That you with fancied wrongs should hold communion,
Think of a fellow with a good broad back
Whining because he's turned out of the Union!

THE PURIFICATION OF PARIS.
The Paris correspondent of the Times writes word that:—
“A new system for laying the dust without watering the carriage-way has been
for some time in operation in the Avenue des Champs Elysées. It consists of
sprinkling the road with chloride of lime, which, being remarkable for its power of
absorbing moisture, soon becomes damp, and thereby prevents any dust from rising
even in the hottest day."
Whether this plan will answer or no remains for a drier season than
the past to decide; but if it succeeds in laying the dust, let us hope,it
will be introduced throughout Paris. Chloride of lime has, besides the
property of absorbing moisture, that of destroying unpleasant odours;
and in sprinkling it about the French capital to lay the dust the
scavenger will, as it were, kill two birds with one stone.

MILITARY IF NOT NAVAL INTELLI-
GENCE.
A Pontoon bridge has been made, from the
designs of CAPTAIN Fowke, for the Viceroy of
Egypt... This bridge was lately tried on the
Serpentine in Hyde Park, by the First Middlesex
Engineer Volunteers and a party of the Royal
Engineers. . The newspaper account of the pro-
ceedings informs us that the bridge having been
laid down over the Serpentine:—
“The pontonniers ‘fell in.'”
This was before they got upon the bridge, ob-
serve, civilian reader. No accident occurred.
CAPTAIN Fowke's bridge, we are happy to find,
did not break down. In continuation, we are
told that the pontonniers were marched and
trotted across it." ‘four deep, subjecting it to
the greatest possible strain, º it bore without
wetting a plank.” . Although, therefore, our
brave pontonniers fell in, the gallant fellows
happily escaped a ducking.
Fashionable Intelligence.
THE new name for Crinoline promises to give
that elegant style of dress a fresh lease in the
devout and fashionable world. On dit at Paris
that an Illustrious Lady has presided in the
Camarilla, wearing a magnificent vestment, ex-
tended on hoops of vast circumference, and
figured with the genuine pattern of the San-
benito, copied from the original design of the
Spanish Inquisition. It is whispered that this
pretty garment was a present from Rome in-
tended as a reward of filial devotion and valuable
services, to which its national and ecclesiastical
significance render it a most suitable testimonial.
LECTURES FOR RUFFIANS.
MR. D'EYNcourt had before him the other day a case in which
two fellows were charged with certain acts of cruelty to a poor animal.
To the biped beasts, for their conduct to the quadruped, the Magis-
trate said—
“What ought to be done to brutes like you is this. You ought to be flogged up
and down the place where you committed such atrocity.”
Mr. Punch, though no advocate for indiscriminate chastisement, is of
opinion that the excellent Magistrate was right. But it occurs to Mr.
Punch that inasmuch as the object of all punishment is instruction and
example, the lesson which MR. D'EYNcourt would give to cruel men
and their friends, might be most advantageously administered in the
most calm and argumentative form, that of a sort of Lecture. There
should be no anger, no vengeance, but all should be done gently and
with precision.
For instance, take one of the above ruffians, and, undraping him. to
the requisite extent, lead him into a circle, to be kept by the police.
His friends, the roughs, are around, but will be deterred by other cir-
cumstances from any interference.
Professor Punch undertakes to deliver the Lecture. He enters,
attended by a broad-shouldered assistant, MR. SLAsHER, who has
selected a good whip from the laboratory of the Professor.
The ruffian, whose name is JAMEs BLIGHT, has been convicted of
cruelty to a horse.
The Professor addresses him.
“BLIGHT, listen to me.”
..MR. Blight probably grants his entire permission to Mr. Punch to
visit a locality in which good intentions form the pavement.
The Professor takes no notice of this permit, but proceeds.
“You, BLIGHT, have been shown to have treated a horse with great
cruelty. I am willing to believe that your act arose, as do very many
similar crimes, from ignorance. You are not aware, probably, that
when a whip descends violently upon the skin, either of man or beast,
great pain is caused. I could wish you to comprehend this thoroughly ;
and my young friend and assistant here will conduct an experiment
which I am induced to hope will elucidate this matter for you. If you
please,” says the Professor, with a smile to his co-operator.
Seven hearty cuts descend upon MR. BLIGHT’s shoulders.
“Thank you!” says Mr. Punch. “Now, MR. BLIGHT, may I pro-
ceed, on the understanding that you are convinced that the operation
in question is painful?”
MR. BLIGHT, with a very red face, discharges a volley of very irrele-
want and irreverent language. -
“Ah!” says the Professor, regretfully. “I have failed, but (apolo-
getically) experiments will occasionally fail, and the philosopher’s duty
is undiscouraged to repeat them until success rewards him. If you
please, MR. SLASHER.”
Seven more cuts descend upon MR. BLIGHT.
f i º here, hold!” bellows MR. BLIGHT, “do you want to kill a
ellah?”
“Qbserve,” remarks Mr. Punch mildly to the crowd, “the difficulties
which beset the philosopher. He either fails to attain his object, or he
attains too much. I merely desired to prove to our friend that this
kind of operation was painful, and he jumps to the conclusion that it is
fatal. I trust, however, to bring him to that via media, which is
tutissima. If you please, MR. SLASHER.”
Aºir application, by the assistant, renders MR. BLIGHT tolerably
Oclle.
“You now are convinced, I hope, that I was accurate in stating that
whipcord, violently applied, hurts, MR. BLIGHT * *
“I should think I was,” growls Mr. BLIGHT. -
“Ah! you do not admit it fully—only in a qualified way. You
should think that you were convinced—you will not allow that you are
convinced. I fear I must trouble you again, MR. SLASHER.” -
But MR. BLIGHT stays the uplifted weapon by a vehement declaration
that he has been hurt like fun. - -
“If you think it, fun, MR. BLIGHT, I am afraid I must dispute the
accuracy of your illustration, and offer you the means of correcting it.
If you please.” -
ut MR. BLIGHT expresses his readiness to say anything. He allows
that flogging hurts very much indeed. - -
“In that case, MR. Blight, and gentlemen, I think we may bring
the lecture to a close. I am quite sure that it will not be forgotten,
and that, after this, no one before me will be guilty of cruelty, now that
he has seen the suffering it causes. I will only add that should any one
so far forget himself, fam authorised by Professor D'Eyncourt to
say that the experiment of to-day will be º with additional
apparatus in the shape of a cºmine tails. I have the honour to wish
you a good morning.”
Whether a course of lectures of this description might not be ſound
available in cases of extraordinary brutality, is a subject which Mr.
Punch hereby assigns to the British Forum as one for debate.

CHARIVARI.
FOXES MARTYRS.
HERE are minds so destitute
of moral sense that they re-
gard the most awful atroci:
ties as funny. A Bideford
Correspondent of the Morn-
ing Post writes a letter to
that journal, in which part of
it appears headed “Novel
Capture of Foxes,” and
commencing thus: – “The
Braunds of Bucks, or the
foxes and fish-hooks, properly
delineated, would make an
amusing comedy.” And then
it proceeds to relate the fol-
lowing horrible story:-
“Not long ago, JAMEs BRAUND,
a fisherman residing at Bucks, in
the Parish of Parkham, North
Devon, having baited a hook with
THE COUNTRY MAGISTRATE.
(By a Policeman who is expected to recover.)
WHEN a poacher stands in the Sessions dock,
By a stalwart Bobby with stiff black stock,
And around him gaolers and beadles wait,
What a thundering Jove is the Magistrate |
Q, how from his high and well-guarded chair,
The Magistrate storms at the criminal there,
And how does our garrulous friend dilate
On Property’s rights; does our Magistrate.
So stern his look and so bold his phrase,
Such promise of valour his glance conveys,
That you feel quite happy to think one State
Holds you and that terrible Magistrate.
But if you'd see that Magistrate cowed,
See him brought up to a lawless crowd, -
That hints with brickbats and pieces of slate
a ling's maw, “tilled' it on the
beach to catch gull, or any other
sea bird. He buried the greater
part of the maw, which concealed |
the treacherous hook, in the
shingle. When he came to loºk
after his hook, and to see what he
had caught, he was not a little
surprised to find a fine fox danc-
ing and capering about at the
extent of its tether. He deemed
it the surest way to secure his
* prize to shoot it, and soon got his
gun and bagged the vixen.”
Who will envy the feelings
of a writer who could pen
such a narrative as the fore-
going, and put a simple full
stop at the end of it, and not
a note of execration? But
this historian of a shocking act of vulpicide actually speaks of that crime as if it
were a sporting exploit. The unhappy' BRAUND had the misfortune to catch a fox.
He “got his gun and bagged the vixen' What would any man of well-regulated
mind i. done under the circumstances? He would, of course, have carefully
secured the fox, and extracted the hook, or got a veterinary surgeon, if necessary,
to remove it by an operation under the influence of chloroform. Instead of that
this monster, BRAUND, shot the fox'

nity, to shed more. Accordingly we are told, in continuation, that:-
that in his efforts to draw out the fish he drew up the loose net and entangled himself, and the
“Last Tuesday MR. BRAUND had another and almost º strange fox adventure. His
fishing nets had been spread to dry, and as is the custom, the dog-fish had been shook out, but
it is supposed that one of these must have been under the net, and attracted a fox out on a forage.
At all events, CAPTAIN BRAUND found a fine old dog fox rolled up in the net. It is thought
more he struggled to free himself the more inextricably he became entangled. On seeing the
nature of the prisoner, “Here's a greyhound, Lucifer," said BRAUND, and then, looking at the
fox, added, “Thee 'rt not content with faesting on LADY ELwes's hares and rabberts these eight
or ten years, but have been scouring the baich for visch ; I'll cook thy goose for tha now.'
Whereon, as BRAUND afterwards said, the cratur looked so vashous that I vetched my gun and

repented him of his act.
How forcibly this wretched clown of a fisherman must remind the fox-hunter
who is familiar with the poetry of Cole RIDGE of the tale of that spell-bound ancient
But the slayer of the albatross
Not so the destroyer of two foxes. The writer who,
in a tone of unfeeling levity, relates the slaughter of those victims, thus describes
the way in which the perpetrator of that deed disposed of the last of them:–
“It was what is called in the locality a greyhound dog fox, of mature age, weighing 12 lb.,
and a º beauty in symmetry and appearance. Mr. BRAND has presented the ani to a
Bideford printer, who intends to have it preserved and set up.”
The captor of a dog fox, of mature age, weighing 12 lb., and a regular beauty
in symmetry and appearance, not only shoots the fox, but glories, in the act, and
gives the animal to be stuffed and preserved as a memorial of what he deems a
creditable achievement! And the chronicler of his crime expresses the opinion
that it would make an amusing comedy. Vulpicide in jest! Fox-hunting readers,
think of that ' Imagine a human being so destitute of every feeling of propriety as
to conceive the idea of making fun of shooting a fox!
“Parlez-Vous Francais ?”
IF so, you will appreciate the following:-
“What has liſted M. DROUYN DE Lhuys into the Ministerial chair vacated by
M. THOUVENEL ** asked DE MoRNY of PERsigny.

...Brought up,” says I, and indeed it’s true
That bringing him up’s not easy to do,
When missiles threaten the sacred pate
Of our terrible, terrified Magistrate.
Down go houses and stores and shops,
Battered the brave policeman drops,
But, the deuce a thing but cackle and prate
Will he do, our bumptious Magistrate.
Those burning houses have thrown new lights
On his worship's views of Property’s rights;
He thinks of his windows, and stacks, and plate,
And “won’t stir ill-feeling,” the Magistrate.
Q, what a change from the Session chair
Is the sight of the white-faced gentleman there:
“Hoping excitement will soon abate”—
What a thundering sneak is the Magistrate!
But, what’s the use of my making rhymes
You’ve learned the lesson ten thousand times,
That the thing you buy at the dearest rate,
Is the non-paid Noodle, a Magistrate.

TRAIN ON THE RAIL AGAIN.
. The notorious TRAIN, the would-be introducer to this
side of the Atlantic of Yankee street-railways, Yankee puffs
and Yankee log-rolling having got off the rails here, gone to
smash, and been taken back from White:Cross Street to
the United States for repairs, has been blowing off steam
at Philadelphia, which condenses into a stream of dirty
water, aimed at England and the English. The following
Yankee flowers of eloquence from TRAIN's choice bouquet
deserve culling:—
“The English are a nation of cowards, and have been so all the
days of their lives. Where have they ever fought? Show me a battle-
field ! . . The whole country is pauperised; they are a nation
of beggars. . . . You may slap them in the face aud kick them :
and there is no fight in them. Ought Americans to fight
them? We must take men of our own size. We are educated as
children, never to strike women or old men, and we ought to kee
hands off of England (sic), and leave the Irish to whip her. - - º
believe sincerely that Lord PALMERston poisoned PRINCE ALBERT for
the purpose of usurping the throne. PALMERsroN was out of
ºffice at one time, and, a scurrilous pamphlet, appeared against the
QUEEN, which he took to her, and said, ‘Your husband is a dead man
in ten days unless things are changed.” In four days he was back in
office again, but the QUEEN hates º, and has not spoken to him
since PRINCE ALBERT's death. This is well known in England
- By-and-by European capitalists, lords and princes, will be
coming over here to invest their money. . . . The English people
are a nation of liars, and I have told them that right square in their
teeth. I am going back one of these days to tell them so again.”
From this it is plain that the TRAIN we had considered
shivered to smithereens is on the rail again, with a venge-
ance. It is evident that, however familiar with smashes,
neither this TRAIN nor its Yankee drivers, have any motion
of a break, or it would have been pulled up short in its
rabid and random career.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR CHARLES COLDSTREAM ON A NEW
SENSATIONAL SYSTEM.
Most people will remember I was miserably “used up”. when some
years ago I visited Vesuvius, and could see “nothing in it.”., I,then
married, and within five years º: been blessed once with dupli-
cates). I found myself surrounded by seven smiling olive branches.
My old enemy was now pretty well subdued, my ennui was rapidly
evaporating. Still as Pope says, “Man never is, but always, to be
blest.” Occasionally I felt that aching void which, a fireman's dog
might experience if chained to a kennel when the engine turns out. I
accordingly arranged with the district Policeman to call me, whenever
he saw a vivid illumination in the skies, without regard to distance or
time. Not content with this kind of volatile salt, l have recently given
orders for a Fire Escape of my own, and hope with the assistance of
my gardener to be of some service if my neighbours will kindly apply
their lips to the speaking tube, which they will find immediately under
the Visitors' Bell.
This is the age of dynamics. Intellect has had its march. Muscles
are now on their stretch. Genius doubtless is very attractive, re-
sembling in that respect a magnet. Round SHAKSPEARE what bright
particles gather Genius however is no match for gymnastics, which
as a transpontine manager shrewdly observed, “draw like a blister.”
The agile adapter of the Colleen Batch, before he took his celebrated
header, must have calculated to a nicety what impetus was required to
carry a body into the carpet of popularity. Passion, poetry, and that
sort of thing, were considered pretty by GEORGE THE THIRD and his
subjects, when the fine old English gentleman used to take the little
Princesses to a provincial theatre. CUMBERLAND must often, I fancy,
have shed grateful tears to see so many plumed heads modding their
º of his sentimental comedies, SIDDQNs and O'NEIL-Katherine
and Belvidera—are associated with our inflexible grandmothers, with
black velvet and point lace, with minuets and buckles, Bath chairs,
harpsichords, long-stage coaches, pigtails, and such like remnants of
Arcadian simplicity, Audiences had then evidently much moisture...in
their composition. They dissolved at Jane Shore and Isabella like
isinglass. Five Act tragedies were not merely endured—they were
enjoyed. It seems almost incredible, but my physician, who has a
jºy recollection of JoHN PHILIP as Coriolanus, assures me it's a
act.
Players now, I am told, have to pay a double hazardous premium on
the insurance of their lives, and the Policy is vacated if they spring
from the “flys.” It is hard upon those glowing aspirants who can
only catch notoriety by o’erleaping the modesty of nature. They must
be “up” to the mark of public expectation, and must follow their leader,
the Spirit of the Times, wherever that Spirit vaults. . Fine acting was
formerly compared to flashes of lightning, but I question if the electric
fluid pur et simple would now melt anything more stubborn than a
cook. It really demands a thunderbolt to “bring down” the galleries,
and as for the pit “rising” at an artiste, such a phenomenon is never
seen until he is several feet above it.
Men who have been admitted to the best Schools of Anatomy may
have little relish for these sensation spectacles. To fellows less for-
tunate a coup de theatre is perhaps highly acceptable if it result in a
brilliant surgical operation. It would not become me to disparage such
popular entertainments. At one period of my life I would have ap-
º first step to a dislocation, and have freely encored the most
jlundering mode of attaining a compound fracture. Nemo mortalium
omnibus horis sapit. Thank goodness, I can now live and let others
live, no longer considering that those who hold the mirror up to nature
derive lustre from a spinal contortion or a cork arm. If a cow can
jump over the moon, I shall be pleased to see her, but I wouldn't
encourage my milkman to do it. Some may suspect that these are
the morbid sentiments of an anchorite. Permit me to say they are
mistaken.
My prime resources in my hours of gloom are however of a much
more perilous nature. My wife's mother, I rejoice to say, exhibits, a
magnificent hoop, of which the periphery corresponds with one of the
larger wheels to PickroRD's Vans. never take her arm without
anticipating every moment to put my foot in it. Then I have secured
shares in several new companies, and having paid the deposit money,
and signed the Deed of Settlement, I am in hopes that with visions of
a Chancery imbroglio, and summonses to show cause why I, SIR
CHARLEs CoIDSTREAM, Bart., should not be enrolled among those
Joint Stock Martyrs, whose, names will descend to, posterity on the
imperishable “ list of contributories,” my mind will be kept at fever
heat for some years to come. A little piece of land, which wanting a
paddock, I bought of the reputed Devisee, my Solicitor now informs
me, is likely to be required by the Heir-at-law, there being some in-
formality about the Will, which was not at all signed by the Testator,
whose signature was . to give it validity. Once in the vacation
I treat myself (and only myself) to a trip in a cheap Excursion train,
and seldom return without feeling my blood warmed, partly from com-
passion for my unlucky fellow-travellers, but chiefly by indignation at
those white cravated gamesters, in the disguise of Managing-Directors,
who stake “compensation” against “dividends,” and play in Tunnels
and on Embankments with human bones for dice.
In conclusion, let me ask one pertinent question. So long as these
salutary expedients exist for simulating the circulation, why shoul
people rush nightly, in crowds to form a Society for promoting the
destruction of Tumblers from rope or wire? I'let a discriminating
public direct, their admiration to commercial instead of bodily flights.
Then if the Gymnasts fall, they will at worst only lapse into bankruptcy,
and if they lose their balance, it will be felt at their bankers, and not
at their backs.

FEDERAL ROMANCE.
WRITING to MR. LINCOIN’s Government aſter the battle of the 14th
of last month, the Federal General stated that the “rebel” army was
totally “demoralised ” and utterly “routed.” Subsequently a New
York telegram informs us that:–
“The battle was renewed on the 17th by the Confederates with great vigour,
lasting till four o'clock in the afternoon, when the Confederates retired, leaving the
Confederate General LoNostral. ET and part of his division prisoners.”
This telegram itself is an illustration of the saying, particularly
applicable to American news, that we should never believe more than
half of what we hear. Part of it is true; but that is only the first part.
The battle was renewed with great vigour by the army which M'CLELLAN
had described as demoralised and routed—an extraordinary army!
GENERAL LONGstEEET and his division were captured by GENERAL
HookER—who commanded a division on the Federal side—with a hook.

LIBERTY FOR WISEMAN'S LAMBS.
THE friends of civil and religious liberty will be sorry to see that the
right of the Irish Roman Catholics to the free exercise of their religion
has been grossly interfered with by the police at Birkenhead, , ,
The British Parliamentary Debating Society persisted in holding an
adjourned meeting to discuss, the question whether GARIBALDI was
entitled to praise or blame, well knowing that this is a question not to

Accordingly, the faithful Irishmen of Birkenhead, arose with one
accord, i triumphantly confuted, their heretical, opponents...by
breaking windows, throwing stones and brickbats, sacking and looting
shops, and cudgelling, cutting, and wounding the passengers in the
streets generally, and the police who tried to prevent this expression of
their conscientious opinions. -
As the Catholic Priest, Robert WRIGHT BRUNDRITT, justly observes:
“If misguided fanatics choose to calla meeting by large orange-coloured placards
headed ‘Sympathy with GARIBALDI,’ in the very centre of at least 15,000 Catholics,
they must take the consequences, and be answerable for them.”
Of course. So, likewise, or nearly so, says that ornament of the British
Legislature and the Catholic Church, SIR. GeoRGE Bowyer. -
Notwithstanding, no less than eleven of the faithful Irish, concerned in
the Act of Faith at Birkenhead, have been taken into custody, and will
doubtless be too severely punished, according to persecuting Law
administered by Protestant Magistrates.
This is too bad. These captives are the same gentle creatures as
CARDINAL WISEMAN's lambs, his “dear Irish children,” his “dear
children,” his “children of St. Patrick,” and “cherished Irish children.”
of the Pope. They are innocents who ought all to have their way. It
is not enough that the Cardinal's own particular pets have been allowed
to stifle the expression of British opinion on the Roman question. The
flock at Birkenhead and everywhere else must enjoy the same liberty.
At Madrid Joseph ALHAMA and MANUEL. MATAMoRoshaye, just been
condemned to nine years' penal servitude for the practice of Protestant-
sm. Until the like outrage of Catholic feeling is equally punishable
in this country, the principle of toleration, rightly understood, requires
that the Irish Catholic mob shall be allowed to take the law into their
own hands, and vindicate the honour, and interests of their Church by
†: of spoliation and destruction, and by the means of shillelaghs and
SUOIles.

When he hounded to mischief the rabble of Birkenhead?
One has outrage of Anglican Church and Scotch Kirk in head,
But none like this outrage of Rome's church at Birkenhead,

While specials and soldiers were chafing and perkin' head
To look out for the justices' orders in Birkenhead,
And the sapient beaks gravely wagging and jerkin' head,
Agreed to do nothing to keep peace in Birkenhead!
So obfuscate the wits, so Cimmerian the mirk in head.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
S PA
FROM TWO DIFFERENT POINTS OF WIEW.
“I)EAR PUNCH, “Spa, October 17, 1862.
“I Don’t think I shall ever come back. When you see me
you may expect me. Please tell the Income Tax Commissioners of my
intended absence, so that they may no longer trouble themselves in
sending me any more of those unpleasant quarterly reminders for non-
payment of an odious, iniquitous, inquisitorial —-
“But why talk of taxes in a place where such plagues are unknown?
Here the only tax the traveller undergoes is the one that, is levied on
his patience to partake of as many pleasures as he possibly can during
the course of four-and-twenty hours. Like a school-boy at a feast, there
are so many good things that he is puzzled to know what to begin with
first Would that iſ could pocket a few, so that I might quietly ..
them when once again I return to that abominable big seminary, called
London, where the prizes are not at all equal to the tasks that one has ||
to go through They say that school is the happiest time of one's life,
but I can only say that if all schools are like London, in which one has
to ſag so very hard, and where one gets, so very little in exchange to
eat or drink, I for one have not the slightest desire ever to go back
again.
“In my opinion, the best part of school are the holidays. They are
the happiest time of one's life, if you, like. The happiness would be
complete, if there were no Black Monday hanging up, like a birch-rod
against the wall, in the background.
“Spa is just the place for a holiday. The little ‘boys and girls come
out to play” all day long. The boys are of all sizes—the girls are of all
ages. From morning to night there is some game going on. Laughter
is heard on every side, such romping and racing and rioting as would
ull the starch out of even a Quaker's habits, and make him join in the
un. Every one is drest in his holiday clothes, and Mamma is generally
close by to see that no one dirties them, so you can imagine that the
romping is of that quiet nature such as would not ruffle the serenity, or
rumple a single anti-macassar, of the most delicately-arranged drawing-
room. The rioting is gay without being noisy, like the chirping of the
birds at that grand place of assignations, the Pantheon Conservatory,
in Oxford Street. 8. might accept the situation here of
Master of the Ceremonies, and not be ashamed of his disciples.
“The place is a kind of open-air boudoir, curtained all round with
thick folds of trees, and made bright, with innumerable little crystal
streams that do duty very well for looking-glasses. In this same
boudoir every variety of ornament is to be found. The paintings
alone on wood, make it quite a petit Louvre des, dames. Work-boxes,
fans, needle-cases, screens, glove-boxes, scent-bottles, are scattered
about in every direction; and if you occasionally find a cigar-case
amongst them, it is some gallant cavalier, who has heedlessly left it
behind him. The air thrills under one perpetual serenade. You go
to sleep with the sounds of melody whispering soft lullabys in your
ear, and you wake up with a military band inviting §. to ‘Come to
the Fountain,” where by dipping a tumbler into the bubbling spring,
you can have a champagne breakfast for nothing. Health and pleasure
ance hand-in-hand together. The celebrated Fontaine de Jourence
trickles down every mountain. People drink here, not only to get
merry—for many of the springs have a more exhilarating effect even
than the best, ‘gingerbeer from the ſountain’—but to grow young
again: Invalids, who have drunk deeply of these re-juvenifying waters,
have been known to wash the accumulated snow of many winters off
their heads. Under the influence of its gentle irrigation, a head
that at first was a perfect barren Mont Blanc, is gradually converted
into a luxuriant Primrose Hill. -
“The trees have a most magnificent effect at present. Green below,
and tipped with gold at the top º Autumn is Nature's best gilder),
they remind me, not inaptly, of the railings round the Tuileries.
“The Redoute is a handsome building, whose hospitality is open
equally to all. Rich and poor alike are welcome to enter. CRoCKFord's

the side of it. . It is clothed from head to foot in gold, like a royal foot.
man. ... The gold overflows everywhere. Even the tables are deluged
with it. I must confess a little playing goes on here, but every one
looks so happy that I defy the most carping cynic to pick a hole in the
green baize that constitutes the playing-ground. No lawn can look
more inviting to gambol upon. What universal happiness! The ladies
even lose their few francs with such a smiling grace that they could not
choose a happier moment to have their photographs taken. You have
all the newspapers in the world here, and if you are put in a momentary
passion by some angry leader, you are quickly softened down again into
good humour by the strains of soft music, whose notes come acceptably
to the ear as the announcement of a large legacy., Floods of light and
literature; a constant rippling cascade of melody and money, the one
not less winning than the other; the most coquet costumes in the world,
as though the prettiest coloured pictures in the Paris fashion-books had
been suddenly endowed with life; six-footed, fat-calved Johnnies in
dazzling liveries, &la milor, waiting upon you at every step ! enſin, you
haven’t anything like it in Englandſ And mind you, Mr. Punch, all
this exhaustless splendour without its costing the enraptured visitor a
single sou /

partie. de chasse is waiting for me at the door. The French horn is
sounding. Adieu.
“Yours happily,
“ANACHARSIs THE YoUNGEST.”
“DEAR PUNCH, “October 18, 1862.
- - - "I AM off to-morrow. I am tired of this place. The truth is
it is a hollow deception, a snare baited by the devil. The Redoute is a
haunt of thieves that, once visited, is only bon a redouter. The croupiers
are enough to frighten one. Their long shovels are like vulture's claws,
that clutch hold of everything that comes within their greedy grasp.
The servants have the villanous appearance of banditti dressed up in
ivery. Even the players have yellow faces, like parchment that has
been stained to pass muster for some Roupell deed of forgery—there is
not a line of truth in any one of them--they are all counterfeit coun-
tenances of honesty. I declare the presiding Lucifer of this gaming
Pandemonium had, to speak by the card, exactly the photographic
appearance of the knave of clubs. Well, may they have music playing
all the while !
º overpower the groans of those whom they have ruined. I
eft the place in sickening disgust, only too happy to have my eyes
opened to the reality of the wicked snare. To increase the mockery,
the band, as I slammed the door with awakened indignation, was
playing with jarring irony, “L’orest une chimère.”
“At the bottom of the sumptuous staircase were two black looking
boxes. One was marked ‘Trone pour les Paurres;” on the other was
inscribed ‘Trone pour l'Hôpital.’ Could you wish for a better moral?
I wonder how much La Banque, whose receipts last year amounted to
1,250,067 francs, puts into these poor-boxes? Not much, Ifancy, for the
froncs were as small as a loser's chance of ever winning back again what
he has lost. Besides, what can an actionnaire in a gambling joint-stock
company know about ‘conscience money?’
“I would not live here for any consideration. The only talk at
the table d'hôte and elsewhere, is about le jeu. One madman talks of
being able to casser la Banque; another simpleton, as green as the
cloth on which he has been squandering the means he has been hoarding
up for months, complains of being complètement rasă. Now, he is
drinking cold water. A day or two ago, flushed with a monetary
success, he was draining champagne out of goblets. The whole air
rattles with the sounds of play. The leaves, as they murmur, seem to
imitate the shuffling of the cards; and the streams, as they leap from
stone to stone, convey to the ear a mocking sound of the ji. of the
dice. The seats in the avenues and allées have for their dorsal supports
playful representations of serpents and vultures, and well they may,
for whoever ventures to rest here will have nothing better to lean back
upon. It is nothing but stinging and clawing, and lucky is he who
escapes with a whole skin. Everything here is serpentine, even down
to the walks. . On my word, when I took my final stroll through this
coupe gorge of a town this morning, I thought all the houses were
numbered Trente et Quarante /
Good bye, dear Punch. Lejeu est fait. I hasten home quickly to
enlist your powerful aid to write down these infamous dens, of which a
liberal Government, like Belgium, ought to feel ashamed.
“Yours, in anything but a playful mood,
“ANACHARSIs THE YouNGEST.”

LORD DUNDREARY MARRIED,
“Why, Georgina, here's another letter from my buother Sam / And I’ll tell you what it is,

A LITTLE QUESTION.
THE ribald bankrupt Yankee TRAIN
Declares us English fools and knaves;
Sneaks, who when struck won't strike again,
Gluttons and blockheads, brutes and slavés.
Swears that Lord PALMERston would make
His way, by poison, to the Crown;
But TRAIN has hopes that Pat will wake,
And tread the English tyrant down.
The fool were fun, if not so coarse,
So were the patriots of the North,
Who cheered and cheered till they were hoarse
The idiot trash he bellowed forth.
We’ve crawled, no doubt, we Saxon worms,
And have been trampled for our pains;
Is it worth while to keep on terms
h'ith friends who cheer such terms as TRAIN's 2
The American War a Case of Scissors.
THE North and South were a couple of sharp
blades that, when united, formed a beautiful pair
of scissors, that cut through every obstacle that
intervened between them, working admirably
together; but which, the moment they were dis.
united, became a pair of daggers, the one turned
murderously against the other. The thing now
is to endeavour to separate them and prevent
i. inflicting any further mischief upon each
Other.
“THE CREATURE’s AT HIs DIRTY work AGAIN.”
TRAMway TRAIN has been vilifying the Eng-
lish. As he was known when here to be the
greatest liarin Christendom, his abuse is received
as the most fulsome flattery.
THE IMITATION MANIA.
–E really wish that somebody
would somehow manage to
do something to stop the
imitation mania which is
raging so about us. People
suffer from its influence
terribly in trade, and there
is scarcely a profession that
escapes being affected by
it. Anything original in
manufacture or in art—be
it a steam chaffcutter or a
Punch cartoon, a self-acting
spring bootjack, or a Lord
Dundreary— is certain, if
successful, to be copied by
the imitators as closely as
the law, which is far too
lax, will let them. In any
trade or art, from a tinker
and a tailor to a poet and
a painter, any one who hits
on an original idea, and by
his cleverness succeeds in
carrying it out, is sure to
find it followed by a swarm
of imitations, which simply
vulgarise the notion and
injure the true interests of
trade as well as art. Let a Lord Dundreary charm us with his whiskers
and yacuities, then a host of Lord Dundrearies instantly arise and live by
trading on the likeness that they bear to the first lord. A feminine Dun.
dreary also starts forth at the Music Halls; and, as coarseness mixed with
crinoline rarely fails to please the frequenters of those places, the feminine
Dundreary achieves a great success. When once a “star” appears in
the theatrical horizon, a dozen denser bodies shine by borrowing its
light; and as the public seldom, takes the trouble to discriminate, the
copy is admired almost as much as the original, and people cheer the
clumsy plagiaries they really ought to hiss.
wº-
Original ideas worked out in literature or art are far less easily pro-
tected than those of manufacture. A pair of bellows is a visible and
tangible production, and an infringement of its patent may be readily
detected. But there are scant means now of patenting, for instance, a
Dundreary, and of preventing feeble copyists from assumption of his
title, his whiskers, and his stutter, and from passing themselves off as
his brother or his wife. Other titles are moreover assumed besides his
lordship's : for the servile herd of imitators (serºum pecus, eh, old
HoRACE P) will filch the smallest trifle that they think will serve their
end. The title Once a h’eek sounds well, so out comes Twice a Week of
course, and this will doubtless soon be followed by Every other *.
and we may naturally expect that the Monday Magazine will soon
treading in the footsteps of the Saturday Review. Such literary piracies
should be stamped with a black flag, that people might avoid having
anything to do with them.

MR. MANSFIELD AND THE MUSICLANS,
“MR. MANSFIELD, London Magistrate.
“This is not the first time, by a good many, that Mr. Punch has
{ had occasion to applaud you, Sir. He was rejoiced to see that you did
not mew regrets over the ill-advised ruffians who, in the Pope's interest,
broke peaceful Englishmen's heads in the Park, but that you sent those
ruffians to gaol. Nothing escapes Mr. Punch, MR. MANsfield, and
though he may not express his sentiments º everything at the
moment it occurs, it is laid away in the faultlessly arranged and exqui,
sitely indexed cells of his memory, to be produced at the proper time
for the exaltation or confusion of the parties concerned. Sir, you had
his silent approbation for the mode in which you dealt with those Irish
blackguards, who are CARDINAL WISEMAN's lambs, and the O'DUN-
DERHEAD's protégés,
“Mr., Punch, however, takes immediate occasion to thank you for
having dealt in a most righteous manner with a gang of street musi-
cians who are constantly set on to annoy MR, BABBAGE, the great
mathematician. What sort of animals the neighbours of MR. BABBAGE
must be Mr. Punch cannot understand. They must be some kind of
Gorilla, and he and M. Du CHAILLU may take a walk up in that direc-
tion one of these days, and under pretence of inquiring about lodgings,
ticket-of-leave-men, or something of the sort, may have a good look at
these, creatures. For the state of barbarism in which they are sunk
| would be almost pitiable, were not the means of instruction within
their reach. That they cannot comprehend that MR. BABBAGE's genius
is an honour to the country, and that, his name, and inventions will be
known in our history is bad enough; but that they must persecute the
Fºl. must endeavour to disturb his studies by hiring dirty
talians to grind organs, or dirtier Englishmen to shout through trumpets
before his house, amounts to savagery. Is there female malice in it,
for such, persistence in petty annoyance is almost below the malice of
violent but forgiving man? Is there some vulgar shrewish Mater-
familias who “will have organs,’ and would have them if NewTox
were at work in the house to her right, and PAscAL expiring in that to
her left? Mr. Punch cannot understand it. But, MR. MANsfield, he
rejoices to see that you laid hold of an entire gang, and fined each of
them Forty Shillings for so offending. Pray go on in the same way, for
though the fines may be paid at first, the supporters of the Musicians
will soon be tired of being hit to the tune of ten pounds per evening's
annoyance. Your health, MANsfLELD.”
A FRIENCE FLOWER-GIRL,
SOFT HANDS AND HARD LABOUR.
HERE is a rare chance for any active-minded and active-legged young
lady, who wants a place as maid-of-all-work—we mean to say, as
Governess:—
YOUNG LADY WANTED, in a farm.house, to instruct four
children in music, singing, French, drawing, and dancing. Address A. B.
“Speed the plough” was once a favourite toast with agriculturists:
t we imagine they now couple it with that of “speed to the piano.”
Well, we see no harm in farmers' daughters being taught to play and
sing, or in their learning the French language, dancing, drawing and
deportment. Perhaps, it would be well if a knowledge of the dairy
were instilled into their minds as well as of the dance: and as an addi-
tion to their drawing-room accomplishments, we think it might be wise
to give them some acquaintance with the kitchen, and supply them
§ſº in the culinary art. As farmers' daughters mostly
have the chance to marry farmers, it would be well, besides accom-
plishments, to teach them their domestic duties; for however much
young Corydon might like to hear his Chloe play and sing and talk in
rench (and the chances are the latter would be utter Greek to him),
we fancy he would like still more to find that she was competent to
give him a good dinner, and to take care that the dairy work and house
work were well done. - - -
But granting that accomplishments are of use in a farm-house, it
seems to us absurd to think that one young lady can properly teach
four children how to draw and dance and play and sing, and moreover
to talk French. Doubtless hiring a young Governess is in many cases
cheaper than sending a large family of small children to a school. But
really there should be a branch of the Humane Society especially
employed for the protection of poor Governesses, and for the prevention
of the cruelties they suffer in the way of overwork. As it is, a Governess
gets scarcely better wages than a common maid-of-all-work, and there
is very little difference in the amount of manual labour which they both
have to go through, and the way in which they mostly are treated by
their missuses.
The Future of Yankeedom.
It may be confidently, predicted that, the triumph of the Black
Republicans in the Federal States will lead to a rivalry in the struggle
for the Presidency, between Pompey and CESAR, and finally, in the
establishment of an American Empire, under the despotism of either
CAESAR or PoMPEy; it will not much matter which, for no doubt the
resemblance between Pompey and CAEsAR will be very close, although
perhaps especially remarkable on the part of Pompey.

Insurance Ticket with my love.
I haven't forgotten him, and if anything happens to me, there's a Thousand Pounds for him?”
SCOTCH SABBATOMANIACS.
SABBATOMANIA is the only word that is fit to ºrg. to the pitch of
extravagance which Scotch fanaticism touching Sunday has at last
amounted to; having become a complete craze, the national mental
disorder of Scotland. No other expression can describe the moral and
intellectual state of the frantic bigots, or raying hypocrites, who signed
a memorial, which, got up by a section of the religious body ironically
calling itself the "free Kirk,” was, according to the Dundee Advertiser,
presented by a REv. DoNALDson Rose the other day at a meeting of
the Brechin Parochial Band, and read by the Secretary. This pre-
posterous document actually stated:—
“That the attention of the Session has been directed to a motion laid on your
table at last meeting to the effect that the Cemetery be kept open on the Sabbaths
the same as the other days of the week, except during the hours of divine service
in the forenoons and afternoons. That your memorialists believe that such an
opening of the Cemetery would be an unnecessary and gratuitous innovation on the
sanctity of the Lord's Day, and calculated to countenance and foster Sabbath dese-
cration. May it therefore please the Board to refuse to pass said motion, and to
continue the present regulation by which the Cemetery is kept shut on Sabbath.”
It seems, possible that such a requisition, as the above could only
have issued from a set of Presbyterian lunatics. The discussion of so
rampant an eruption of frenzy could, one would think, have taken place
nowhere out of a Calvinistic Bedlam. The prayer of this mad
memorial, however, was not only seriously debated, but granted in part.
A motion proposed by a sane gentleman named BLAck, for opening the
Cemetery on Sundays “except during the hours of divine service in the
forenoons and afternoons” (an exception conceded to the Sabbato-
maniacs) was voted for by a minority of five. The motion of a poor
creature, a MR. W. Steve Nson, for keeping the Cemetery closed as at
present, was carried by a majority of thirteen. Finally, it was agreed
on the motion of a gentleman not quite so far gone as the greater part
of his associates, Professor GUTHRIE, “that the Cemetery should be
open between one and two o'clock on the Sabbath, and that the Com-
mittee be instructed to make arrangements with the keeper for that
purpose.
. Now then, if HERyey could come out of his own grave, wherever it
is, and betake himself from his present place of sepulture to the Brechin
Cemetery, he would be able to pursue his Meditations among the Tombs
there on a Sunday only between the hours of one and two. This limi-
tation would perhaps suggest to him a reflection on the shortness of
time, and the length of ears which had prescribed the brief duration of
the span allotted him to meditate in by Scotch Sabbatomaniacs. -
An hour's meditation among the tombs may be sufficient for people in
eneral, who do not share the partiality of HERyey for that amusement.
ut they, many of them, have a fancy for visiting the graves of their
relations, which the working classes mostly have no time to do except
on a Sunday, and the interval between one and two is just that which
they usually spend in discussing baked shoulder of mutton, roast
potatoes, and onion sauce; or ºf analogous.
The perversion of those feelings which have the highest relation, is a
painful subject, on which it is well to say no more; except this; that
unhappy officials and others who have got so bad as to shut the public
out of a Cemetery on Sundays, ought to be taken care of, and that none
of the members of the Brechin Parochial Board, who voted for the out-
rageous proposal to close their burial ground on the Sabbath should be
suffered to shave themselves, although they would perhaps get better if
their heads were shorn.
Postscript.—We are informed that the signatures to the petition for
opening the Botanical Gardens at Edinburgh on Sundays were 14,000,
not, 1,400 as stated in our last Number. It rejoices us to see that
Auld Reekie contains so many persons of sound mind in proportion to
Sabbatomaniacs.

swimming-ground he had inadvertently trespassed) whom he at first took
for one of those terrible creatures that have recently visited Scarborough.
A MODERN URBAIN GRANDIER.
(For the Spiritual Magazine.)
THE Paris, Correspondent of the Morning Post tells a story which
will perhaps be quoted by prejudiced materialists as making against
spiritualism, and by narrow-minded Protestants as evidencing Roman
Catholic superstition. He gives the following narrative of certain won-
derful phenomena which have occurred at Morzines in Savoy:—
“It appears that about the year 1857, a mysterious epidemic, characterised by
convulsions (like your ‘revivals’), and a train of symptoms usually observed in
hysteria and epilepsy, raged with such violence that in seven months 27 persons
exhibited the form of the disease in its worst character. Seventeen were cured by
the virtues of exorcisers. So delighted were the inhabitants of the commune at the
success of these crafty deluders that they were called to show their skill upon the
dumb animals of the district that were supposed to partake of the malady. Before
the conclusion of 1860, 110 persons, mostly children, were victims of the epidemic."
This state of things continued, getting worse and worse, until some
account of it came to the ears of the Minister of the Interior; who sent
DR. CoRSTANs to see about it. As this physician is Inspector-General
of Lunatic Asylums, it was perhaps natural enough of a sceptical Home
jº,# entrust him with such a mission. DR. CoRSTANs went,
and, Denoid 1–
“On his arrival at Morzines he found the whole population in a state of the
utmost depression, every one believing himself possessed by a devil. The munici-
al council, with the utmost gravity, assured the learned doctor that if he only
rought with him the ordinary remedies of science his treatment of the disease
must fail; that hitherto success had only attended exorcisms, pilgrimages to holy
shrines, and animal magnetism.”
The foregoing statements, however, will be cited by Spiritualists,
too, against incredulous people, to prove that the supernatural virtues
of exorcisms and holy shrines are ºi by animal magnetism. Incre-
dulous people, to be sure, will adduce it to demonstrate the same thing
in confutation of both Spiritualists and Romanists, and will no doubt
consider its subjoined sequel as a clincher of their argument:—
“The experienced physician's prescription was as simple as it was efficacious.
The first item was the removal of the curé of the parish, followed by the arrival of
a brigade of gendarmerie and a detachment of infantry. The epidemic has dis-
appeared.”
“Ha, ha! Cured in an instant Yes, it is all very well of shallow
materialists to jump to their lame and impotent conclusion with a gra-
tuitous laugh; but do they suppose that epidemic hysteria is curable
by the arrival of a body of police and a troop of soldiers in the affected
district P Are they blind to the significance of the fact that, the dis;
appearance of the disorder coincided with the removal of the curé,
The cause was taken away, and the effect ceased. Of course they will
turn this fact into ridicule by attempting to account for it on the sup-
osition that the curé had turned his people's heads, and that is soon as
e was gone they came round again. This is the view that will be taken
by stolid common sense; but we know, better. The manifestations
stopped on the removal of the medium, The narrator of the preceding
particulars expresses the wish that such a treatment as that adopted in
this case “ I.F been followed in the days of CARDINAL RICHELIEU, when
the unfortunate URBAIN GRANDIER, a curate of great merit, was burnt
alive, being imagined by the nuns of the Ursulines to be the demon that
afflicted them with a similar epidemic.” URBAIN GRANDIER was burnt for
bewitching the Nuns of Loudon; not because he was imagined to be a
demon, for if his judges had entertained that idea of him of course they
would never have thrown faggots away upon him, which they would have
looked upon as more .# than carrying coals to Newcastle. It was
stupid cruelty to burn him, when if he had been set down to a table and
furnished with a planchette, he might have been utilised. The enlightened
Spiritualist does not doubt that GRANDIER was a medium, and, in, his
explanation of the marvellous influence exerted by the curé of Morzines
upon his flock, will also be guided by the truly golden maxim, medio
tutissimus ibis.

ºf we care not to de-

“Liquid Rouge has the advantage of being perfectly uninjurious to the skin, and at the same

must be allowed to repeat that this liquid does not injure, and that it produces so perfectly a beauty, to please us,
“Ladies, when your cheeks get pale,
Try the rouge we keep on sale: .
You’ll find it quite a first-rate tint,

How
In Japan when women marry they pull their eyebrows out
and blacken all their teeth: and really this is scarcely a more
barbarous proceeding than using artificial means for colour-
ing the cheeks. Indeed when we hear of ladies reddening
their knuckles and their elbows, we think them scarce
more civilised than were the ancient Britons, with whom it
was the fashion to dye themselves sky-blue.
Tastes differ, we all know; but for ourselves we can’t
designate as “beautiful” the bloom which is
produced by the agency of rouge: nor should we consider
that a girl “improved” the look of her knuckles or her
elbows
of
y giving them an artificial redness by its use. A
must be a beauty without paint: and
natural appearance that a magnifying glass may be used without detecting the fact, that rouge' as for the assertion that a magnifying glass might be used
and not nature has
greatly improved by its use. It is sold at 1s. per bottle, and can bef

If, in spite of all its virtues, this liquid rouge hang fire in sale (which, for the

Marked you her roseate elbow too?

iced the beautiful bloom upon the skin. The knuckles and elbows are
orwarded per post for 1
§ without detecting the presence, of the pi t, this fact
in no way serves to lessen our dislike for it. We should
never dream, ourselves, of carrying a magnifier for the
purpose of convicting any girl of using paint: and we should
fancy few young ladies wouldpuffer an admirer to inspect
their skin as though it were a subject for a microscope, and
were not to be regarded simply with the naked eye. Were
we SIR CREsswell. CREsswell, we should hold a sham

THE NAGGLETONS AT BRIGHTON.
The Scene represents an Apartment in the Hotel at Brighton. MR. NAG-
GLEToN has put on his Hat and Glores, placed the “Times” under his
left arm, and his cigar in his mouth, and he now takes his stick, and
is about to go out. Mrs. NAGGLETON, ºrho is reading the Supple-
ment, has carefully watched all his preparations, but has abstained
from speaking until he is quite ready to go.
Mrs. * (in an icy tone). I want a cheque, HENRY.
Mr. M. Very well, my dear, I’ll give it you when I come in.
Mrs. N. I want it now, if you please.
Mr. M. O, bother, won’t it do an hour hence?
Mrs. M. For the third time, MR. NAGGLEros, your wife has to solicit
money from you. If you wish her to request it upon her knees, you
had better state that such is your wish.
Mr. W. (throwing down cigar, stick, and “Times,” and tearing off his
gloves). ow can you use such idiotic language? Why couldn’t you
have mentioned it before one had one’s hand on the door?
Mrs. M.. I am too well aware of what would have followed any allusion
to the subject during your breakfast, MR. NAGGLEToN. I should have
been insulted for not letting a man have time to swallow his coffee before
dº for money.
Mr. M. (slightly conscience-stricken). Where is that wretched ink-
stand? You are always shoving it out of the way.
Mrs.N. I will fetch it from the bedroom. I do not regard a six-
penny inkstand as an ornament to a sitting-room. I will fetch it.
Mr. M. (venomously). Readily enough, I make no doubt, now. Yesterday,
when I wanted to write a note, you had not the slightest idea where the
thing could be, and referred me to the waiter who seemed on such good
terms with me. -
Mrs. N. £º. That a person calling himself a man should bottle
up such trifles to reproduce them for the purposes of malice!
Mr. N. Never mind what I bottle, my dear; get the *}. h

Mrs. M. (sadly). Oh, dear! I know not which is worst—such serious-
ness or suc }% [Erit.
Mr. M. (which shows wires that it is unwise to leare a man to his own
reflection; when money is wanted). By the way, what the deuce does she
want with another cheque to-day? It’s oily Thursday. I pay the
hotel bills. I don't quite see it in that light. Any how, we’ll hear.
Re-enter MRs. NAGGLETON, with the ink.
Mrs. N. There is the inkstand, HENRY. -
Mr. M. I say, my dear, I move that this House do go into Committee
of Supply.
Mrs. N. (not having yet got her cheque). Just what I want, HENRY.
There is paper.
Mr. M. No, no, I’ve got my cheque-book.
Mrs. N. (in spite of herself). You have / You had no packet by this
morning's post, and last night you had left your book safely locked up
in town. But I never profess to understand the mysteries of commercial

you please.
Mr. N. (epading the charge offiction). This is Thursday, MARIA.
Mrs. N. I am perſectly aware of it, HENRY, and I deeply regret that
your keeping me company here should deprive you of the happiness of
attending at the “Flips.” Had you not better go up by the 330 train?

Joke.
Mr. N. (now robur et as tripler). This is Thursday, MARIA, and you
had a cheque on Saturday. #. do you want another so soon?
Mrs. M. (briefly). Because the last is spent. -
Mr. N. Unless you have any very special reason for wishing it, I
should prefer not drawing until Saturday. -
Mrs. N. As you please. (Resumes seat and Supplement.) That it
should come to this! [Handkerchief demonstration.
Mr. N. Come to nonsense, MARIA. Can't a husband ask a plain
question without a wife's turning on the water-works.
Mrs. N. does not speak, but the paper quirers with her shuddering
remonstrance against his unfeeling º,
Mr. M. Now, don't be childish, there’s a good creature?
Mrs. M. (sorrowfully). Creature, indeed! [Heavy sigh.
Mr. N. I rather suppose myself to compliment you by talking to you
in a business-like way—letting you into my little confidences—but one
never knows how to deal with a woman. There is the cheque, however,
MARIA. They’ll cash it for you down-stairs.
Mrs. N. No, no. Take it back, and let us pay our bill and return to
London by the third-class train. Ring for the bill, if you please.
Mr. M. Now what’s up? -
Mrs. N. O HENRY, this is your mean way of acquainting me with
your embarrassments, perhaps ruin. What is to become of the poor
children? Pray, ring for the bill.

Mr. N. ſº with rage). MRs. NAGGLETON, I do not quite like to
say what I think you are, but certainly you are not a blessed wise
person. What on earth have I said to justify such nonsense? I usually
prefer to draw on Saturday because a good deal of money is paid in to
my account on Fridays, (observes MRs. N. making a mental mem at??!
of the statement) that is, on some Fridays—and so-
Mrs. N, O, don’t take pains to mystify me, HENRY: I told you I
knew nothing of commercial matters, not even how a book could get
out of a locked drawer and come to Brighton without hands. I only
spoke for the sake of the children, of whom you never think.
Mr. N. No, of course not, except from ten to six every day of my
life, when I am working my hardest for them and their mother.
Mrs. N. (humbly). I am sorry we are such burdens to you.
Mr. W. (erasperated). Who the D, yes, a large D, MRs. NAGGLETON,
for the case deserves it—who ever said you were burdens? You have
no right to charge me with want of heart.
Mrs. W. If I seem to have done so, dear, I have expressed myself
unfortunately. You have heart enough, it is your poor head that is
too often in fault. - - - -
Mr. N. (At least twenty times more enraged with this imputation.) I—
I—am very much obliged to you, MARIA ; but º: opinion of my
intellect is, excuse me, not so valuable as it might be, if your own were
of a higher order. (Snorts.) - - -
Mrs. N. Recrimination, HENRY, is ever the resort of irritability, but
it is no argument.
Mr. N. Argument, indeed! No, I do not know that I am called to
argue with my own wife as to whether I am a fool or not.
rs. W. (smiling.) No, dear, it is not necessary. . . ---
Mr. M. And, although your opinion on the subject is valueless, it may
be well for you to know that it is certainly not that of my friends.

sidering the time that has elapsed. - --
lº. N. (not swerving from the charge.) They were something like
“No listening senate heeded what he spoke,
But the club hailed him master of the joke."
To be sure you are not master of the joke where MR. WYNDHAM
WAREHAM is, but I dare say your friends (as you say) at the “Flips”
would give you a character for a sort of smartness. I alluded, how:
ever, to real intellect; and perhaps as you do not quite understand
me, we had better change the conversation. What a funny noise that
man with bull’s eyes makes.
Mr. M. MARIA, you of all women in the world-
Mrs.N. My dear HENRY, I have no affectation, but you are always
using the word woman; it is not quite the thing; and, although it is
natural that you should, from your antecedents—
Mr. N. Hang my antecedents, Madam, look at your own relatives.
Mrs. N. To see that you have studied grammar, if only for the sake
of buffoonery, is so gratifying, that I abstain from further remark.
Mr. N. I was going to say, 'Mrs. Nºggiºros, that you of all—ladies
– in the world are best entitled to deem me unwise, but that you also
of all-O, ladies—ought to feel bound not to use your privilege.
Mrs.N. Which means, I presume, that, having honoured me with
your alliance, I am never to express my sense of some of its dis-
advantages.
Mr. N. I know of none.
Mrs. N. Ah!
Mr. N. But I know that many women envy you.
. Mrs. N. Envy is always a proof of weakness of mind; and, in this
instance, most particularly so, my love.
Mr. W. I tell you one thing, MRs. NAGGLETON. In the old times,
my holidays were periods of unmixed enjoyment, now they are occasions
of incessant wrangle.
Mrs. N. If the first MRs. NAGGLEToN had neither sense to perceive
your deficiencies, nor spirit to point them out, HENRY, it is not my
fault that I am successor to one who seems to have been but a few
removes from an idiot.
Mr. N. I wish there were more such idiots in the world.
Mrs. N. (points to beach). I dare say you will find plenty down there
—at least this is about the time the nurserymaids and that sort come
out. Have you spoken to your friend the waiter about dinner, love?
Mr. M.. I think I shall go up to town.
Mrs. M. (smiling). As I was quite sure that you would not dare to
be absent on a night when WYNDHAM WAREHAM is in the chair, I
arranged to take an early dinner, and go round to SARAH BALTIMORE’s.
Mr. M. You might have asked me first.
Mrs. N. I might, certainly, but it didn't occur to me to do so. Still,
I can send SARAH a note, if you find, by-and-by, that you have courage
to stay at Brighton with your wife, in spite of your friends and their
sarcasms. Please yourself.
Mr. M. It being matter of perfect indifference to you ?
Mrs. N. My feelings being matter of perfect indifference to you, I
seldom trouble you with them.
Mr. M. Such is life? And what is marriage?
Mrs. N. Well, if you ask me, I should say it was—wedlock. Go and
take your walk, and see if you can bring in a better definition, and,
*º bring in some better prawns than those you bought yesterday.

SHALL WE GIVE UP GIBRALTAR.?
ARE we going to give up Gibraltar P. Of course,
If we mean to dispense with our maritime force.
For of what use to us can that distant rock be
When we cease to maintain a dominion at sea?
As Gibraltar is close to the border of Spain,
It belongs to the Spaniard—what pikestaff more plain?
the four Channel Islands, you see at a glance,
Are not much more remote from the borders of France.
Then we must, if of lºgic we cherish a spark,
Give up Jersey as well; Guernsey, Alderney, Sark—
Common prudence would also that course recommend;
It were best to return what we couldn’t defend.
We’ll surrender at once, then, to stand in no need
Of invasion, the whole of Great Britain indeed,
Letting Erin's green Isle be annexed to the land,
If there is one, whose Rulers will take it on hand.
But though forming a part of Iberia's º:
In the first place Gibraltar belonged to the Moor,
So we don’t see our way, in resigning it, plain,
To restore it to either Morocco or Spain.
In the meantime we own it in fact and by right,
And at present intend to keep hold of it tight;
And what tenants, in all the wide world can you find,
Who would hold it so much for the good of mankind?
THE BISHOP OF DURHAM ON STRAIT-LACING.'
THE primary Visitation Charge of the RIGHT REv. DR. BARING,
the ºw Bishop of Durham, delivered the other day, contains these
Words :-
“What manner of persons ought, then, the Clergy to be above all others in holy
conversation and godliness—”
Which nobody can deny. His Lordship continued:–
“How ought they to shun all recreations and occupations which, though possibly
innocent in themselves, might be likely to cause a weaker brother to fall !”
What are the recreations and occupations which Bishop BARING
alludes to? When Parson Trulliber, taking Parson Adams for a cus-
tomer come to buy pigs, insisted on his going into the pig-stye to examine
its occupants, amongst which Adams fell down, Parson Trulliber was an
occasion of stumbling to Parson Adams, although the latter can by no
means be said to have been a weak brother. There are few occupations,
besides keeping pigs, that a Clergyman is at liberty to pursue; now
does the Bishop of DURHAM mean to class pig-keeping among those
occupations which, though possibly innocent in themselves, are likely
to cause a weak brother to fall: Suppose a º does a little
horse-dealing, is that an occupation which the Bishop considers likely
to cause the fall of a weak brother? Not, surely, unless the reverend
gentleman sells a horse that has been down on its knees. It may be
said that the clerical horse-dealer constitutes himself, a temptation to
the professional one, by whom he exposes himself to be cheated; but
that cannot be, when, as is generally the case, the parson is much too
sharp to be taken in. . - - - - -
The game of skittles is a recreation closely connected with the imbi.
bition of beer; but even if that recreation, innocent in itself, may
occasionally conduce to excess in liquor, it does not appear to be one
against which the Clergy need to be cautioned. In taking a fence, a
§. out hunting may himself come to grief; but he is not .#
to cause anybody else to fall, weak brother or strong. And althoug
indeed, he may, in playing cricket, indirectly occasion the fall of a
brother to whom he gives a run, and who slips in taking it, being weak
on his pins, yet perhaps this is not exactly the sort of fall which the
Bishop means. It is to be feared, however, that he does mean to dis-
courage the participation of his Clergy in athletic sports and pastimes,
for his above-quoted remarks about recreations, smack rather of nervous
than muscular Christianity.

uxine billows and Mexican waves
Whitened beneath the keels of his braves:

Slightly troubled with vain remorse,

Wrongs he wrought, but let history add
That some of his acts were not so bad,
And men believed that the god would choose
The righteous course—while it suited his views.
Meanwhile he ruled with the club and sword,
A silent, stern, and resistless Lord.
Hercules had a mind to wed,
And whom should he raise to the Purple bed:
None of the maids of royal line
Were wooed to listen to vows divine.
From a great peninsula rich—in fame,
Where an ancient Pillar still hears his name,
His fancy minded a bride to seize,
And he bore her over the Pyrenees.

A proud young beauty, whom every voice

SOME ODIOUS COMPARISONS.
BY A CONTRIBUTOR JUST OFF HIS. BioLIDAY RAMBLES.
We all know pretty well what John BULL thinks of foreigners—their
railways, their hotels, their cafés, their hats, their coats, their cigars and
their civility.
But I should be very curious to know what the foreigner thinks of
John BULL in these and the like particulars. Not the Assolant kind of
foreigner, the feuilleton-writing gentleman, who is nothing if not
epigrammatic, and looks at things with exclusive reference to their
effect in an article; but the honest, average Frenchman or German who
has been over here this year on International Exhibition business or
pleasure. I should like to compare notes with him on English hotels,
restaurants, refreshment-rooms, lodging-houses, and so f. i
... Fresh as I am from a couple of months on the Continent, spent most of
it in France and Italy, I should be very curious to know whether Eng-
lish ways and, waiters, rooms, and refreshments, bed-rooms and bills,
hotels and lodgings, strike him, as compared with those of his own
country, in the way they strike me.
I suppose that is, as Lord Dundreary would say, “a thing no fellow
can find Qut.”. But, I know, at any rate, what I think on these points
myself. And I think it worth saying, because I believe there is an
immense deal of cant afloat on these matters—conclusions that won’t
hold water-complaisances that "won't wash”—conceit that calls for
snubbing, and }; hollow pretentions which would be all the better for
having the wind let out of them.
Now, I am not a decrier of Britons and things British. ... I have main-
tained before, and I am ready to maintain again, against all comers, and
at all weapons, that Englishmen and women, of the class gentlefolk, are,
as a rule, the cleanliest, neatest, best dressed, and best behaved travellers
in the world. l aver, too, and will maintain that in point of speed
civility, and comfort, allowing for the higher chances of a smash, an
the inferiority of our second-class carriages—the English railway system
is immeasurably to be preferred to the French or German. †. I
know nothing half so striking in the way of distinction between matters
at home and abroad, as the contrast in the demeanour, voice, and
behaviour of everybody about the railway-stations, when you change the
lines on the other side the Channel for those on this. I look upon our
English railway-guards and porters as the modern Chesterfields. I
knºw no class equal to them for good breeding, patience, chivalrous
fº. to women, fine manners, and sustaine temper. ... I
aven't an idea how this consummation comes about. It can’t be the
Directors—they are a dreadful set of harpies and vultures, as we all know
from the leading-articles and letters in the newspapers. It can't be the
influence of the occupation, which is hard and wearing, exposing the
men to all weathers when in motion, to dreary, monotonous watching and
waiting, when on station duty. It can't be the prospect of the “tip,”
which they are forbidden to take, and which everybody is determined
to give. I dismiss the idea of that motive as § insulting and in-
sufficient. But what can it be? The virtue is universal with the class.
I have sometimes observed a snappishness among the young
men who give out the tickets at the pigeon-holes. - -
must be owned they are very hardly tried by sudden examinations in
Bradshaw, and difficulties about change. But the porters and guards
never fail one. They are all absolutely lambs, doves, angels in ribbed
corduroy or blue broad-cloth.
Abroad, on the other hand, from the moment your coiture sets you
down at a station, you feel yourself a mark for imposition and extortion,
a helpless victim of despotic forms, the bond-slave of a set of haughty
#. in uniform. They are all alike, from the ticket-clerk behind
the grating, who contemptuously thrusts you out your tickets, and is
quite capable of cheating you in your change, when you pay for them,
to the luggage-registering clerk in the cage, who makes out your luggage.
ticket, and blows you up, if you fumble with your billet, or have an
difficulties in handing him the exact amount demanded for trunks an
portmanteaus. When you have run the gauntlet of these tyrants, there
is the man on guard at the waiting-room door, who will not allow you to
pass in or out without showing your ticket, who separates you from
the wife of your bosom or the friend of your youth, supposing them to
have accompanied }. with a view to an affectionate farewell at the
last moment; and then, when you have been swept in the rush out of
the waiting-room on to the platform, you find yourself out of the
º in the fire, in the hands of a despot, and slave-driver, to
whom the oppressors you have hitherto had to deal with are meek and
merciful. This is, of course, the guard, who orders you about, crams
you with fiendish satisfaction into the last place of a crowded carriage,
with an empty one on each side of it, clamours down your remon-
strances, gives you the lie direct, separates your party, laughs at your
discomfort, and seems altogether to revel in the opportunity of making
you feel that for the time being the power is his, and that he means to
abuse it. Fleas may be a nuisance, beggars a bore, musquitoes an
infliction, small wash-hand basins an evil, pestering ciceroni a torment;
win ordinaire is not, as a rule, delicious;–but I declare solemnly, that
as far as my experience, goes, travelling has no nuisance, irritation and
discomfort comparable to the foreign railway official. He is at least as
open to a “tip” as his British brother; but the one is civil to you,
though you never offer him, a sixpence; the other is uncivil, though
you try to propitiate him with five-franc pieces.
The contrast between the two puzzles me.
son and JoHNNY CRAPAUD into a Legree. As for the German railway
people they are, if possible, worse than the French—because they
are clumsy and stupid, besides being overbearing and oppressive.
If the difference be caused by the fact that "Engian is a constitu-
tional country, and France and Germany paternal despotisms, I can
only wonder that the difference should be felt so much in this and so
little in other things.
But whatever the cause, the difference I insist upon is more marked
and more operative on a traveller's, comfort, than any other distinction
between this tight little island and the big loose Continent beside it.
But I admit it is at this point the balance must be struck, if one means
to keep up the old notion that England is the country for neatness,
cleanliness, kindliness, practical good sense, and all other things that
conduce to comfort. If one goes further—to the refreshment rooms,
the hotels, the eating-houses, the shops with their ministering spirits,
waiters, and shop-men and women—and their appliances—beds, fur-
niture, bed and table linen, washing, cookery, service, &c.,. &c.–then
I am bound to own that England stands, fearfully below neighbouring
Continental countries. I am forced to the conclusion that in all that
relates to the accommodation and enjoyment of the traveller, England
cannot hold her own for an instant with foreign parts—that she falls
below them as far in comfort, cleanliness, convenience, and common-
sense as in cheapness. I throw this paradoxical proposition down at
the end of this paper, and give the reader a week to digest it. Next
week I will tell him on what grounds I maintain so seemingly unpa-
triotic a doctrine.
The Celtic Water Cure.
CAPTAIN HAss Busk, of the Victoria Rifles, writing to the Times
on the subject of suppressing riots, observes:—
“As soon as a popular tumult assumes a threatening aspect, nothing mor is
necessary in order to quell it than a couple of fire-engines, supported º a detach-
ment of police, who have only then to direct a steady horizontal jet water full
at the head of the mob.”
A capital suggestion. We will only venture to improve upon, it by
recommending that the fluid employed to disperse riotous Irish Yahoos
should be particularly pure, because those creatures have a peculiar
antipathy to clean water.

A PLEA FOR CRINOLINE.
“MR. PUNCH, SIR, - - -
“It’s really horrid and disgraceful and audacious—and I wonder how
you can dare (yes DARE, Sir) to do it—and I’ve a great mind to say that I’ll never
forgive you!—and—but I forgot I haven’t told you yet what I mean: Well, what I
mean, is, Sir, the way in which you presume to talk about our Crinolines. It was
only last week, or the week before, that you had the atrocity to say that Crinoline
was the very “worst lady's habit, and the sooner she threw it of the better.”
Why, I never heard anything so shocking ! But that’s not the worst of it—
you’re always poking your fun at our dresses, or our bonnets, or our walking:
sticks (as if we hadn't a right to have walking-sticks as well as you) and it’s
hypocrisy, Sir, and you know it is. Why, if we were to be such geese as to give
up our “hen-coops’ or ‘expansions’ or whatever you choose to call them, you
would be the first to laugh at us—like that wretch of an EMPERoR when his sweet
Eugenie came down to breakfast one morning without hers, all to humour his
whims—you would be the first, to be making your jokes about ‘walking May-
poles,’ &c., whilst the dirty little boys would call after us ‘There goes another
guy!" or “There go several other guys!’ as the case might be.

the wall-flowers, who huddle round the ſender because they can't get partners enough
to keep themselves warm. Besides, what do people want with fires in ball-rooms at
all, as if it wasn't always hot enough without? and if they must indulge in their
Salamanderish propensities, why can’t they just put a screen over the grate, and
roast in security. Moreover, even admitting (for the sake of argument only) that
our balloons are a little dangerous or so, in case of Fire, are they, not º:
salvation in the case of Water: Think how many a girl gracefully buoyed up by
her expanding dress has escaped a frightful death, and, as one of your poets says–
“Floated down the river like a water-tight Ophelia,
For her Crinoline sustained her?”
“Then again, Mr. Punch, as to those absurd stories of fat boys being swept off
jetties and so forth-I don't believe a word of such stuff, and if our “steel-traps,”
as they call them, do sometimes, hurt the lº of the
opposite sex a little, why so much the better! Why can’t
they keep at a respectful distance, as they are obliged to do
when they go to see that sweet Koh-i-Noor, or the Tinted
Wenus, or anything else that is too precious and exquisite
to be endangered by contact with their Bear-ships? For
my part I always consider this one of the strong points
of the invention.
“Then as regards ‘Dress-makers’ bills,” and “extra-
.." prices,’ and all that rubbish that the men are eter-
nally braying about, it’s amere bagatelle to what they spend
on themselves and their horrid cigars, and their clubs, and
their vanities. Who is it, I should like to know, all the
world over, that delight in bedizening themselves and
langing themselves in chains? Answer me that, Mr.
Punch,-and honestly if you can for once? Who is it
that love to deck their sinful bodies in feathers, and nose-
rings, and fripperies: whilst their poor Squaws are left to
do all the dirty work at home, and carry the papouses?

| signals of distress.
THE WIND AND THE WATERING-PLACES.
He effects of the late gale
have been terribly disas-
trous. The calamities at
sea which the newspapers
have chronicled have been
by no means the only losses
which have been sustained.
At nearly all the watering-
places on the Southern and
the Eastern coasts much
valuable property has been
utterly destroyed, and
many a lady's toilette has
been made a perfect wreck.
Not for many seasons has
such a storm been wit-
messed, and the amount of
damage done to parasols
and petticoats is more than
has been known by the
very oldest bathing woman.
We subjoin from various
sources some authentic
details, which will serve
to show how great was the
fury of the storm.
At Folkestone, it is
stated, for several days
past the shore has been
completely covered with fragments of costume, which have been torn
away by the violence of the gale. Bits of bonnets, brims of hats and
scraps of artificial flowers have been picked up in great quantities upon
the pier and on the Leas, and fully a ºyards of Crinoline,
carried from its moorings and abandoned by the owners have been dis-
covered in small pieces along the beach and cliffs
At Hastings and St. Leonards sixty-seven new umbrellas were blown
inside out on Sunday in coming out of church, five-and-twenty hats
were whirled across the street, and eleven false moustachios were blown
into the sea.
At Scarborough, on the twentieth, when the gale somewhat abated,
| the Mary Ann contrived, by skilful seamanship and pilotage, to reach
the bookstall at the Station, and make her passage home with a cargo
of new novels, without sustaining any damage further than the springing
of a small leak in her shoe. Later in the day the same voyage was
attempted by the Jane Jemima, a somewhat smaller craft, and carryin
more top-hamper, in the shape of a spoon-shaped bonnet. She stoo
out well at first, but, in rounding a street corner, she caught a sudden
uff, and was very nearly thrown on her beam ends. Righting herself
ravely, she bore on for a while, but was soon observed to throw out
Observing this, the Arthur, that had been on the
look-out, gallantly bore down to her assistance, and, having shortened
her head-sail by taking in her parasol, eventually succeeded in towing
her to port.
At Lowestoft several casualties are reported to have happened; but,
although the slates, and tiles, and chimney-pots have been flying in all
directions, no personal calamity is known to have been ºi On
the pier eleven wide-awakes were blown from their moorings, and of
these but three were saved, the others sinking one by one within sight
of the shore. How many ladies' hats were carried away, or otherwise
destroyed, has not been ascertained with anything like accuracy, but it
is feared that the number of total wrecks is very great.
From Eastbourne we are told that the storm raged with great force;
but, as the visitors for the most part kept prudently at anchor by their
own firesides, but little loss of property has been hitherto sustained. It
is, however, stated that a score of new umbrellas were blown clean
inside out, and one unfortnnate Skye terrier was carried off its legs;
and, but for the blue ribbon which moored it to its mistress, there is
little doubt that it would have been lost.
At Dover several bad collisions are reported to have happened, and a
number of small craft, through press of Crinoline, have been for some
time in great danger; but, assistance being ready, no wrecks have
occurred.
From Ramsgate we receive the like calamitous intelligence, testifying
to the violence and fury of the gale. Three fruit-stalls were capsized at
various street-corners, and several parasols were seen to go topieces with-
out the possibility of rendering any help. Among othermishaps, a couple
of craft of small tonnage—or rather of small poundage—the }.}.
and the Charley, were riding (upon donkeys) in safety on the sands,
when a furious gust caught them, and carried away their head-gear;
but they held on bravely (to the pommel of their saddles) and escaped
being wrecked.
The reports from Brighton have not yet fully been made up. We
have, however, learned that among the mishaps occasioned by the gale,
on Monday afternoon a nursemaid, who was coming alongside of a
soldier, by a sudden, squall was carried right into his arms, and there
quietly remained without sustaining any damage further than a furtive
kiss. Another nursemaid, finding her perambulator difficult to steer,
immediately, hoisted signals of distress. These being observed by
Policeman Z. 11, that gallant officer at oncemade sail to her assistance,
and did not leave her side until he saw her safe in port.
THE BRITISH BULL-DOG TO THE PRUSSIAN
EAGLE.
AREyou true Eagle of aquiline race,
With a beak that spurns bars, a wing that snaps tethers,
And an eye to look Royalty’s Sun in the face?
Or are you a chicken in Eagle's feathers?
Are * an Eagle, whose home's the sky,
...Who loves free flight and air that is pure;
Or a buzzard that has but soared so high,
The swifter to stoop to a royallure?
Is that beak but meant to guzzle and gorge?
Hold you those claws at your master's will,
To carry the bolts your Jove may forge: .
Bearyou that head to be hood-winked still,
As fits a bird of perch and mew, -
Tamed and trained for the sport of a king,
To strike the quarry he tosses you to, .
And then at his whistle to fold your wing?
With ruffled feathers I see you stand;
Your foot is on a parchment roll:
And I see your master reach his hand,
Out of your gripe to wrench the scroll.
With characters fine and flourishes fair,
I read “Constitution” writ therein:
And the world for the upshot sits a-stare.
Will HoHENzoLLERN or Eagle win?
List, Eagle of Prussia, if not too proud,
By the British bull-dog advised to be;
The time has been, when had I been cowed,
The Sruº had kennelled and collared me.
The never a parchment scroll had I
With Constitution fairly spelled,
But I had a bare bone of liberty,
And betwixt my teeth that bone I held.
My master STUART bade drop that bone,
Or, dog as I was, I should be shent.
I told my master to leave it alone;
Or meddling might breed him discontent.
He liſted his hand, I showed my teeth,
He strode a step, I stretched my chain:
He drew his sword from out the sheath,
I warned him to put it up again.
He raised the blade, my fangs Ibared,
He came; I broke the chain that held :
He struck; but ill with his crown it fared:
I swallowed it, and the head it held.
To collar and kennel I’ve since returned,
As bull-dog should, at my own good will:
But the sweet bone that day's tussle earned,
That bone I keep, and will keep it still.
There, Eagle of Prussia, I’ve said my say,
For you and for him that wears the crown;
Let your bite be worse than your bark alway,
But keep your foot where you’re set it down.
FAULTS on Both sides.
MAN and wife are like a pair of scissors, so long as they are together,
but they become daggers so soon as they are disunited.
Why Is IT Expensive to KEEP PIGEONs –Because you must have
a housemaid (house made) specially for them.

THE GRAND CUSTOM OF SPAIN.
ThE KING OF DAHOMEY was informed by a Missionary that the
EMPEROR AND EMPREss of the FRENCH had lately presided at a
Spanish bull-ſight, the incidents of which, being detailed to His
M º afforded him high gratification. He said, “Berry good; berry
good; keep good customs: bull kill mans more good customs. Gorriº
The following passage relative to the QUEEN OF SPAIN, extracted
from a British journal, was then read to him:—
“Her Majesty attended Mass yesterday at the Cathedral at Malaga, and visited
several charitable institutions and industrial establishments, inaugurated an exhi-
bition of works of industry, and late in the day was present at a bull-fight.”
“Good dat last,” cried KING BADAHUNG; and he rolled his eyes, and
grinned from ear to ear. “Berry good customs,” he remarked.
“White Queen keep customs some good. Not so good customs as
Black King, though. Yah! French Empress–Spanish Queen—come
here! Teach um keep grand customs proper. Ghaw!”. The King
then uttered a loud roar, when a dozen captives were º brought
before him, given a glass of rum a-piece, and beheaded with a, blunt
chopper, after which he set to laying at footbali with their heads, one
of which he kicked rather too hard, so as to hurt himself, and then he
lay down and bellowed.
SYMPATHY WITH IRISH RIOTERS.
A MEETING was held one day last week at a public house in Holborn
for the #. of getting up subscriptions to pay the fines incurred b
the faithful Irish, §: WISEMAN's Lambs, in breaking the he
of Garibaldian heretics with their pious shillelaghs. It is much to be
feared that the object of the respectable Irish gentlemen who coun-
tenanced this assembly will in future be frustrated by Magistrates too
anxious to protect the peace of the public against the assaults of Irish
Catholic zeal. There is every reason to apprehend that, instead of
fining devout Irishmen for cracking the crowns of British liberals, their
orships will exercise their optional discretion of giving those dear
children of the gushing Cardi | imprisonment and hard labour.
We may state that, at the pro-shillelagh demonstration above alluded
to, some mention was made of another subscription now in progress for
erecting a memorial to the late DANIEL O'Connell. It was proposed
that the memorial should consist of a statue; and a Member of the
Irish º: Brigade who happened to be present, judiciously suggested
that, as O'Connell was in his day the #.;; of Ireland, whereas
Irishmen at present are ready to fracture the skull of anybody that
dares so much as to shout for the Liberator of Italy; therefore, the
statue to the memory of DANIEI. O’Connell, should be composed of
brass, and planted upside down.

THE REFEREE'S DECISION.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I say, you are always a friend to us youngsters, and I want
}. to make things square between me and the Governor. He is the
est old party in the world, but he don't always see things in a right
light, don’t you know, and times have changed since he was a boy,
tempora mutantur, and all that. He will insist in writing on his letters
to me, ‘Master SwitHIN LANE; ' and the other chaps at the school
chaff me like fun (only it isn't fun to me), and say that I am a nice
little child, and why doesn’t the nurse come to see me, and no end of
that. I say, you have been young yourself, you know, and you might
say a word. I have spoken to the Governor, and asked him to write
‘Mr.” (I didn’t go in for “Esquire,’ though some of the chaps have
their letters so), and he talks about ‘Mr.’ meaning an adult, and that
I am only fifteen, and that it would be a positive wrong.' I should
like to know which is wrongest, doing a little thing like that, to oblige

THE name of the old French hat has for years past been Gibus, .
The new French hat, however, has been the target, or the head-piece,
rather, of so many jokes, at the expense of the poor Mossoos, that they

A PUZZLE IN THE COURT CIRCULAR.
THE subjoined extract from the Court Circular is indistinctly con-
clSe:–
“Osborne, Oct. 30.-The QUEEN walked this morning.”
In labouring to be brief, the chronicler of the Court movements
becomes obscure. “The QUEEN walked this morning.” Well; but
HER MAJESTY has hitherto, happily, been accustomed to walk every
morning. The information that “the QUEEN walked,” as , if our
Sovereign had been for some time keeping her bed, was calculated to
create anxiety and alarm in the minds of HER MAJESTY's subjects. In-
stead of being apprised that the QUEEN walked in the abstract, they
ought to have been told that she walked in the castle grounds or where
else soever it pleased her to walk. Some persons, accustomed to ex-
press themselves in idiomatic language, when they read the statement
that the QUEEN “walked,” too probably misunderstood it to mean, that
HER MAJESTY went away. Avoid slang.
A Lady's Postscript.
IT is said that the meaning of a lady's letter always peeps out in the
Postscript... It may not generally be known, but there is an insinuating
motive in this. The dear creature, after indulging in a quantity of
elegant nonsense, ties her meaning tightly up in the Postscript—thus
evidently wishing that everything she has of truth, or interest, to com-
municate, may be taken literally au pied de la lettre. . And who can say
ºin º as in all other things, the dear creature is not quite right

FOX-HUNTING
~~
IN FRANCE.
EoPLE who delight in
the entente cordiale,
and hail with rapture
every step made to-
wards Anglicisin
Frenchmen an
Frenchifying English,
must have seen with
immense pleasure the
, following quotation,
CA tº
Ž% 2. made lately by the
º º º º Paris Correspondent
º 2% sº X of the Times:—
“A Havre paper says
there is serious talk of
organising in Normandy
fox-hunting in the Eng-
lish style. The object of
this is said to be to form
hunters and chargers on
the model of the famous
English hunters. The
hunting-field is to serve
as a complement of the
training school and of the
steeple-chaces, already to
some extent introduced
into France. It is pro-
posed to form a com-
Inittee in Normandy, con-
sisting of the princi
landowners of the dis-
tricts in which the hounds
should be kept, in order to obtain the right of traversing the country; also to
regulate the question of compensation for da e done. One or several kennels
should be formed by persons specially º: for the purpose; the season to be
from November to March.”
- º º
Knowing somewhat how la chasse is pursued across the Channel, we
can picture to our mind the ludicrous absurdities French “sportmen”
will commit, in the way of hounds and horseflesh, customs and costume,
ere they succeed in hunting foxes à la mode anglaise.
Fancy a French tailor's notion of a hunting-coat, and what monstrous
eccentricities his scissors would indulge in when first cutting out the
“pink!”. Then what years and years of training must a chasseur
undergo before he brought his figure down to proper hunting weight,
and what practice j it take him to learn the art of facing a “bul.
finch” without flinching, or to take his “timber” as coolly and com-
placently as though it were a walking-stick!
If by luck he ever managed to clear a five-barred gate, how he would
glory in ºf his achievement of the feat, and what stories of his
prowess in the field would he narrate, when he reached that time of life
which we may call his anecdotage! As for getting him to hunt without
a big horn at his back, that of course would be past hoping until after
many seasons: and we can . how each chasseur would fancy himself
the huntsman, and act as though he solely had command of the whole
pack. We can conceive too with what clamour the hunting field would
echo, and what curious imitations would be given of the cries which
foxhunters in England are accustomed to emit. How would the “view
holloa.” be translated into French * or if les chasseurs du renard in pre-
ference adopted the English cries themselves, how would they pronounce
such words as tally ho! hark for 'ard! gone away! or Yoicks!
These and other questions of like national importance are suggested
to the mind of the meditative reader upon seeing that the French are
about to take to fox-hunting a la mode anglaise. Well, we really see
no reason why they should not try to imitate us, in this or any other of
our national accomplishments, and we wish them all success in making
the attempt. Whatever their shortcomings and their, ſailures in the
field, fox-hunting is at any rate a better sport than bull-baiting, which
for the credit of the country we hope it will supplant.
SHILLELAGHS IN CONTROWERSY.
OUR Ultramontane contemporary, the Tablet, with reference to the
change in the policy of the EMPERoR of the FRENCH on the Roman
uestion supposed to be signified by his appointment of M, DROUYN DE
Huys in the place of M. ThouvèNEL, makes the wonderful remark
ensuing:-
“The Liberal press does not conceal its vexation: it admits that the EMPERoR
has deluded it, and it is ready to take its revenge by breaking somebody's head.”
The Liberal Press, will be amused at finding itself accused of a
| readiness to break heads by that particular journal which is the pious
apologist of WISEMAN's lambs.

MUSICAL GYMNASTICS.
“DEAR J Ack,
“WHAT a muff are! Why didn't you come up last week?
Oh, the partridges be hanged! You might have left them for one day:

Brompton, though, thank º, ! that shop's shut–except for swells
who want to buy a three-hundred-guinea sideboard, or a self-acting
steam muffin-cutter, or something of that sort. The sight I mean was
down at Sydenham, at the Crystal Palace, and here is the official adver-
tisement thereof, extracted from the programme I purchased in the
building:—
“CRYSTAL PALAce. Wednesday. * * * Half-past three: LEotARD in his
Wondrous Trapeze Performance across the Centre Transept, accompanied by the
Orchestral Band of the Company.”
“There, you g fellow! Now, pray, wasn’t that a sight worth coming
all the . from Slushbury to see? Just picture to yourself, my boy,
the Wondrous LÉotARD, flying across the transept "accompanied by
the orchestral band. Can't you in your mind's eye see them in the
act?—conductor with his long hair floating in the breeze; performers
with their instruments close upon his heels, all ophicleides and oboes,
kettle drums and cornets, bassoons and double basses, all accompanying
the Wondrous in his trans-transeptal flight? Was there ever known
a musical performance such as this? HERR STRUMUNDTHUMP's gym-
mastics are nothing in comparison, yet you know what his contortions
are in playing the piano, and how actively he jumps from the tip top of
the treble to the bottom of the bass. How on earth—or rather in air–
the fiddlers can have managed, with their fiddlesticks in one hand and
their fiddles in the other, to catch hold of each trapeze bar as they
swung themselves along, is really more than I feel competent to guess.
By way of musical agility, the feat is quite unparalleled, and for the
wer of adhesiveness they manually displayed, I incline to think the

ALARMING INWASION.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“AFTER reading of the doings of the Federals and the Con-
federates, the state of poor GARIBALDI’s ancle, the fury of the gale, &c.,
in this morning's Daily Telegraph, I stumbled upon a paragraph which
caused me to upset half a cup full of Iceland cocoa over my new and
much admired shawl dressing gown (a present from FANNy) and to kick
a very elegantly worked slipper (ditto from EMILY), which was at that
moment gracefully poising on my right foot, into the fire. The cause of
this unusual excitement was the folloming announcement, headed PRINCE
NAPOLEON-"The screw yacht Jerome Napoleon, having on board PRINCE
NAPOLEoN and PRINCEss CLOTILDE and suite, arrived at Southampton
on Saturday morning from Cherbourg, and proceeded to London by the
South-Western Railway.’, Gracious Goodness! and is it possible that this
ocean monster has arrived at the Waterloo station during the QUEEN’s
and LORD PALMERSTON's absence? What base treachery has been at
this sort of thing is to be allowed, we shall have the Gloire and the
entire fleet of Impregnables conveyed to Charing-Cross and Hyde Park
by some monster Excursion Train one of these dark winter nights, and
then indeed Mossoo will be avenged! Fancy a steel-plated frigate
blazing away, simply moored on a huge railway truck—fancy the horrid
monster traversing the kingdom and pouring destruction along its in:
land track, slaughtering the peaceful clowns of Leicestershire and
bombarding Birmingham. The bare idea is enough to appal the stoutest
heart, and has quite spoiled my breakfast.

CLERGYMEN IN CRINOLINE.
WHY don't clergymen wear crinoline? Surely it would add much to
their personal appearance. A pet parson .# find his gown sit ever
so much better, if he were to spread it over an extended petticoat. In
the pulpit the improvement would perhaps not be discernible; but in
walking up the aisle, and in standing to officiate at a marriage or a
christening there is no doubt that a parson would appear to great
advantage, if his gown, were º out to the present width of
fashion. We are afraid to think what havoc a clergyman in crinoline
would play with the soft hearts of his feminine congregation; and how
many pairs of º their tender hands would work for him. In the
opinion of most ladies a good personal appearance is one of the main
points towards making a good preacher;

'A STRANGE CAT.
THE subjoined advertisement extracted from the Times, suggests
various reflections to the thinking mind:—
LošTº TOM CAT, on the night of the 30th ult., from 6, Park Cottages,
Park Village East, N.W. Light grey coat, with black stripes: answers to the
name of “Johnny.” Whoever will bring him to the above address slall receive
TEN SHILLINGS REWARD.
There was, of old, a liquor which, our ancestors said, “would make a
cat speak, and a man dumb.” It may be doubted whether even that
beverage would make a cat answer to a call. Cats are generally slow at
answering to their names; and it must indeed be an uncommon ToM
that answers to the name of JoHNNY. ToM and JoHNNY in conjunction
are equal to John Thomas; and a lightgrey coat with black stripes
would indicate a cat less distinctly than a livery-servant. We may add
that the reward of ten shillings for the lost John NY is liberal. It shows
dear John NY to be made much of, insomuch that one John NY is con-
sidered worth ten Bob.
Alleged Sacrilege by the Eldest Son of the Church.

SPORTING INTELLIGENCE,
(From Bell's Life.)
, THE Sporting world is still excited in reference to the International
Exhibition, Bets are freely offered that even at this late period of the
show, the Commissioners will yet manage to do something new in the
way of shabbiness, or blunder, or both. Indeed, on the double event
money is risked freely. This is F. sportsmanlike venturing, after
what has been already seen. The achievements of the Commissioners
have been so remarkable that it looks like tempting Fortune to bet
upon their again making themselves ridiculous. And yet we have such
confidence in their staying powers of absurdity, that we do not like to
discourage our readers in putting on the pot. They must calculate
for themselves, caveat melior, let the better take care. The pickle
business, the stick and umbrella business, the no-admission-to-assistants
business, the libellous-catalogue business, the refreshment exaction
business, the refreshment-smash business, the Cadogan-scandal business,
the refusal-of-Sunday-tickets-to-students-without-season-tickets' busi.
ness, the lavatory-extortion business, the prizes-muddle business, and
about a dozen more businesses of the same kind, seemed to forbid hope,
yet * the last hour we are told that MR. MoRRISH is not to sell pork
ples durin
sends the betting up, for it shows powers of invention. Perhaps we
shall hear that a royalty, or toll is exacted in respect of every
purchase made in the building, perhaps we shall find that though
articles may be sold, they may be wrapped up only in whitey-brown
paper to be procured of the Commissioners at ſourpence a sheet. We
cannot give a decided opinion on the safety of betting on the Commis-
sioners, but fortune favours the bold, if it does not (as hath been shown
at Kensington) favour the stingy. The º: may perhaps be right in
putting a monkey on, the rather that the public monkey has been so
often up about the moribund show.
OUR BLOATED ARMAMENTS.
WHAT, if we let our CoBDEN charm us,
And, listening to his witching coo,
Believed no neighbours e'er would harm us,
Should we, the British nation, do?
Our fleet and troops we should abolish,
'Twere less than wisdom to reduce:
With no invader to demolish,
Our Armstrong guns would have no use.
To arm at all 'twould be a blunder,
Were we secure from every foe:
ship, not enough to serve for thunder,
*Twere idle waste to keep for show.
For oh! what people in their senses
Would pay for armaments too small
To well suffice for their defences?
Ours must be vast, or none all.
Can we pursue our peaceful courses,
Nor need for self-protection care #
Why then, indeed, to foreign forces
Öhrown should no proportion bear,

THE POOR MEDICAL ACT.
IN the police reports, one day last week, it was stated that DR.
HENRY SCOTT, Upper Woburn Place, came before MR. CoRRIE at Bow
Street to complain of a quack namesake, with whom, to his great annoy-
ance, he was often confounded. The doctor, on one occasion, receive
a lawyer's letter, meant for the quack, written to demand payment for
a year and a half’s rent. The Magistrate suggested the application of
the Medical Act to punish the quack's assumption of the title of doctor.
DR. Scott remarked that the Medical Act was a dead letter. Just so.
We believe we are warranted in supplying a defect amongst authorita-
tive announcements by stating that the Registry created under the
Medical Act has been removed to the Dead Letter Office.

With a holster

SOME ODIOUS COMPARISONS.
BY A CONTRIBUTOR JUST OFF HIS HOLIDAY RAMBLES.
CHAPTER SECOND.
I UNDERTook last week, to maintain, among other unpatriotic
opinions, the superiority of the Continental Hotel system to our own.
I know how I shall be met on the threshold of my argument.
“What,” I shall be asked, “were the hotels of France, Italy and
Switzerland, before the English introduced wash-hand basins, foot-
baths, tubs, towels?—”. - - - -
Stop, my friend...I admit that the Foreign Hotel owes infinite obli:
gations to the British traveller, One may measure how vast the debt
is, by adventuring upon the hotels in out-of-the-way places where John
BULi, his voiturier and his courier, his MURRAY and his Mackintosh,
his plump purse and patent-leather, portmanteau, are still unknown.
Here the wash-hand basin yet holds the consecrated pint; the foot-bath
is a mystery, represented, when you have at last managed to convey the
idea of what you want, by the copper caldron that will shortly receive
the pasta for your minestra, or the tin receptacle which is destined to
take the débris and dirty-plates of your dinner-table. The tub in such
places is an institution which it is idle to attempt to make cameriere
or padrone even conceive. Washing from head to foot in cold water is
by them regarded as a discipline to be inflicted upon madmen by their
keepers, not by same men on themselves,
Ten to one that your bedroom floor is unswept, and foul with the
dust of twelve months—if nothing worse; that the salle-à-manger is
waste and dreary; the table furniture antediluvian. If you dine, the
dishes will arrive in an order to you eccentric and incomprehensible, the
fish after the roast, and the sweets before the entrées, and the vegetables
apart from the meat. The name and nature of joints, and viands will
be as puzzling to you as their order. You will strange meats set
before you, and pass irresolute from a chump of what you are inclined
to think donkey, to a mess of what you are well nigh convinced is cat.
Entrails, and brains will furnish, three-fourths of your entertainment,
and ten to one you will be pressed to taste, under the name of “funghi,”
a dish of what you have always considered ºl. toadstools,
and hideous orange and yellow, Agarics, or veritable brown Lycopods
and funguses such as grow on the trunks of trees. I say no g of
fleas. You will soon be familiar with them at bed and board, and learn
to regard them as slight and necessary evils. Ten to one your room
will open into a gallery looking out upon, the stable-yard, or you may
absolutely have the mules, in the story under your feet, jingling their har-
ness, kicking and squealing all night, and as odoriferous as they are noisy.
I defy the most determined Anglomaniac to paint the genuine foreign
hotel, as unimproved by the travelling Briton, in blacker colours than
many features of it deserve, or than I am prepared to a § to them.
But even in these remote, unsavoury, ill-appointed dens of dirt and dis-
comfort, the chances are a hundred to one that §§. find excellent coffee,
a clean and comfortable bed on an iron bedstead, beautifully white linen,
at bed and table, and lots of it, a courteous welcome, the most kindly
and unwearied attention from everybody about the place, and a humble
solicitude about your comforts that goes far to make up for dirt, dust,
discomfort, frowst and fleas. Why, if there were nothing else than the
readiness and handiness, the absence of solemnity and pretension about
the waiters' -
Shall I ever forget, when, travelling in a valley of the Piedmontese
Alps, with two ladies under my charge, we arrived wet through at
the Albergo—how PIETRO, that most peerless of cameriere, carried down
from our rooms load after load of soaked boots, wet wraps, drabbled
linsey-woolseys, and even moist crinolines, and did the work of an ani-
mated clothes-horse for hours, patiently turning them and himself before
the blazing wood-fire till all were dry and fit to be worn again by the
poor signorine whom he waited on with the agility of a man and the
delicacy of a woman -
When I forget thee, PIETRo, and thy delight in contributing to our
comforts, thy quick step, bright eye and pleasant glancing smile, thy
cheery voice and light hand, may I be condemned to a British railway-
hotel and a British waiter for the resiof my travelling life! There was
not a woman servant in the inn apparently. But here was a male
attendant waiting upon a brace of British, females—not, of the
strong-minded order, either—and refined enough to minister to them,
even to the drying of their crinolines – without giving rise to a sug-
gestion of impropriety, or leaving a shade of embarrassment. |

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Find me a British waiter from whom you can conceive woman accept-
ing, such service, and enjoying it. And yet these ladies, Ivow, were
quite happy in PIETRO's care, and confessed to me they never felt the
want of a chamber-maid. --- -
Still it must be owned that all the politeness and ready good-will in
the world won't make up for grievous material discomfort, especially in
the way of abundance of dirt and lack of water. I admit that it is
only where John BULL has passed that you find yourself rid of these
drawbacks to comfort. It is John BULL who has made those wonderful
Swiss caravanserais—a cross between barracks and palaces—which count
their bed-rooms by hundreds, and whose table d'hôtes accommodate
guests by the battalion—John Bull, who has created accommodation
and even luxury for the traveller, in places where a few years ago the
chamois skipped, and the marmot made its burrow—where you can
hear the avalanches falling as you read the last French novel in the
smoking-room, and step on to i. glacier out of your verandah windows
º º as those of the Riffelberg and the Faulhorn, Zermatt or
e tº lºn1.
It is John BULL to whom, in great measure, the world owes the
combined comfort and magnificence of such perfectly ordered establish-
ments as the Europa at Turin, the Ecu or the Bergs at Geneva, and the
Ville at Milan. It is true, he has left his trace on the bills as well as
the comforts of these gorgeous abodes, which swallow up house after
house, for their lodgers, and create fortune after fortune for their
landlords. It is John Bull who has planned and planted, furnished and
purveyed for those pretty cheerful halting-places on the Italian Lakes
at Bellagio and Baveno, and Lugano, with their lovely views, their clean
light apartments, and their well-appointed tables d'hôte; John BULL who
has set a going the pensions of Lake Leman and Lucerne and Inter-
lachen; John Bull, who has distributed the comfortable travellers'
rests that await your arrival at the end of the day's journey on every
great vetturino-road. Yes, I admit it is John BULL who has brought
about that consummation which I maintain is now attained. He has
rfected the foreign hotels, but then he has neglected his own. He
as been so busy spreading the faith in tub and foot-pan, in smart
service and good cookery, in airy rooms and well-swept floors, in the
hotels abroad, that he has overlooked the ill-smelling feather-beds and
antediluvian four-posters; the untubbed, stuffy, frowsy bed-rooms; the
horse-hair sofas, *. towels, triangular wash-stands, and stony soap;
the dirty German silver, uneatable viands, and undrinkable wine; the
jº waiters, and pert, over-dressed, mincing chamber-maids;
the stupid mismanagement and shameless extortion in the average
hotels at home. It has been with John BULL's travelling-accommo-
dation as with his religion. He has sent missionaries to Boriobooloo
Gha, and passed by the back-slums of Westminster. In his anxiety
to supply the little Feejeeans with moral pocket-handkerchiefs, he has
forgotten that his own City Arabs were growing up without pocket-
handkerchiefs or morals either. And just in the same way he has made
foreign hotels all that English hotels ought to be and are not—has
well abroad, English comforts at foreign prices, and left us, at
ome, discomforts that should be foreign, at prices excessively and
exorbitantly English.
THE FAIR SEX AT A DISCOUNT.
WHAT is it to be a “lady”: , Will, any one please tell us? The
question may seem simple, and the definition easy—until you try your
brains at it. There are several doubts that must be cleared away
before the truth is clearly visible. For instance, may a maid of all work
be regarded as a "lady”: . If not, there, surely must be something
faulty in the wording of this notice, which we found the other day
inserted in the Times:–
A. Liberal HOME and her laundry expenses are OFFERED to a well.
informed English lady, who would in return teach her own language, and make
herself useful in the management of a gentleman's family. Apply, by letter, stating
age and particulars, to A. Z., etcetera, Leamington Spa.
You see this “lady” is not only required to act as governess, but to
do the work of nursemaid and perhaps too maid-of-all-work; for the
“make herself useful” is somewhat an elastic one, and might
easily be construed into meaning that a maid-of-all-work's duties must
be done. So besides “good information,” this “lady,” we should say
must have good health and strength, and good strong arms and legs, as
well as a good head. The “management of a family” implies some
good hard work, and any one to be of use in it must be capable of going
through much daily manual labour. So the “lady” who is lucky
enough to get this situation may expect to go to bed as jaded and
fatigued as though she were a nursemaid or a maid-of-all-work. Indeed
the only difference between the latter place and hers is that she will
have to work and not get any wages. A “liberal” home and washing
is all that is held out to her, and however liberal the promised home

MUSICAL THIEVES,
THE Street Musicians, emboldened by the discreet indulgence of some
of the Magistrates, have ventured on an advance upon the common
enemy, the public. They have added swindling to insolence. With a
sordid cunning, they are availing themselves of the sympathy felt for
the poor Lancashire operatives, and are obtaining money under false pre:
tences. Most persons in London have remarked that of late an increased
number of brass bands have been growling and snorting near public
houses at the corners of streets, and that one of the performers hoists a
placard declaring that the players are distressed workpeople from, the
North. The poor, whose kindness to the poor is proverbial, are daily
victimised by these dirty swindlers. It is a case for police interference,
as the following report will show:—
“MANSION HOUSE.
“As the LoRD MAyor was about to leave the bench, a gentleman, who said his
name was MR. RAvell, said he wished to call his Lordship's attention to what he
thought was a great imposition upon the public of London. He came to London
last week to see the Exhibition, and he had seen a number of bands of itinerant
musicians sº about the streets. Two or three, he noticed, had large boards
informing the public that they came from Staleybridge, and other distressed dis-
tricts in cashire. He himself resided in Dukinfield, which is near Staleybridge,
and knowing the names of several of the mill-owners, he was led to question the men
! of one of those bands. He asked them at what mills they had worked. One of them
mentioned the name of a firm, but the others said it was so long since they had
been employed that they forgot the names. He mentioned several names of firms
with which he was acquainted, but only one was recognised by one of the men.
He thought, therefore, that these men were impostors, and therefore that the
public ought to be informed.
“His Lordship said, if that was the case, he concurred with the opinion of MR.
RAVELL.”
Mr. Punch is º to help in informing the public touching the Band
Swindle. He would say, to any kindly natured person who has but
“coppers” to give, that it is a pity to throw even coppers into the gin-
shop, and that they can always be turned into postage stamps, and sent
to the LoRD MAYOR, by whom they will be properly disposed of in aid
of the poor operatives. As for the musical impostors, they ought for
the first time in their lives to be introduced to machinery, but it should
be of the class of which a “crank” forms a prominent feature. The
public is obliged to MR. RAVELL for unravelling a rascality.
ELEGANCIES OF SPORTING LITERATURE.
AMoNgst the “Answers, to Correspondents” of a sporting paper,
called The Eclipse, we find the following striking advice:–
“NIMROD-Punch his head."
It is laconic, and decisive. It is a real bit of muscular Christianity.
But, supposing the correspondent, following up the Editor's recommen:
dation, did “punch" somebody's head, and, by so doing, got himself
into mischief, would the Editor be answerable, as having instigated him
to commit a breach of the peace? Or, supposing that the “...i
in trying to carry out the experiment suggested, had got his own h
“punched,” would he have had an action for damages against his pug-
nacious adviser? To guard against such accidents, the Eclipse had
better open a MILLING DEPARTMENT at the back of its office, with
an assuring notification, “A NoToRIOUs BRUISER ALways KEPT ox
THE PREMISEs.” A list of prices, also, might be extremely useful, so
that the timid, or the weak, might be able to see confidently at a glance
at how much eyes were blacked, or heads punched, per dozen. The
Editor would flourish extremely well, we should say, in the mining
districts, for his advice to NIMRoD to “punch his head” has certainly
not been equalled since the ejaculation of the miner, who, upon seein
a º, recommended his black-looking friend to “eave arf a bri
at him.’
Question for Cobden.
No doubt, to abolish commercial blockade,
Other nations would gladly agree;
But which could to keep that agreement be made,
If they had our command of the sea?
SHALL DILKE HAVE A statue?
THE Guarantors will probably think it quite unnecessary to raise a
monument to more than one º connected with the Exhibition, and
as they are likely to have to Post the Coal as it is, it is probable they
will not insist on hoisting SIR. C. W. DILKE on to a pedestal.

. It is said a lady's ball-dress, which (as many of them are)
is coloured green with arsenic, will in one rattling waltz or
polka throw off enough poison to kill a dozen people. As
the girl goes whirling round, the arsenic is whisked off her,
and in a cloud of powder floats about the room... Now, if
ladies will persist in wearing arsenic dresses, a ball will be
as deadly and destructive, as a cannon ball, and nearly
every one who dances will be food for (arsenic) powder.
We are past the age ourselves for such gymnastic exercise,
but we like to see young people actively enjoy themselves;
and we believe that there is nothing they more heartily
enjoy, when they are brought together, than a galop or a
waltz., For sanitary reasons, too, we think a à. COIn-
mendable. Sudorification is at times a healthy process,
and not many modes of exercise promote it with moré
certainty, and quickness than, the dance. We, therefore,
trust that poisoned dresses will soon go out of fashion, and
that we may hear no more of ladies introducing the arsenic
dance of death. However pretty a young lady may look
“with verdure clad,” we cannot łoś admire her tastein
wearing what is poisonous. If impregnated with arsenic,
her dress may prove as deadly as the shirt of Nessus; and
were we a young man, we should certainly abstain from
choosing as a partner any girl who took to arsenic to make
herself look killing—which there is reason to believe she
might prove literally to be.
CIVILISATION ON THE MARCH.
THE following passages occur in the speech lately
delivered by CHARLEs XV, KING of SwedEN, at the
opening of the Swedish Diet:-
“Commissions composed of competent persons have been ap-
pointed to examine into the state of our means of defence, as well as
the improvements of which they stand in need. The formidable
increase of armaments in other countries will impose on us consider-
able sacrifices.
“The incessant progress of society in all its branches constantly
gives rise to new exigencies which you will be called on to satisfy."
The two immediately foregoing statements may be

ments of Europe increase. Society is º like a

A CoNTRADICTION IN TERMs.—Man and Wife.
GENEROSITY OF A CORONER'S JURY.
THE generous indignation and uncalculating sympathy for which the
verdicts of respectable coroners' juries, in reflecting on any hesitation at
self-sacrifice in the interests of humanity, are remarkable, will appear to
great advantage in a case of which the particulars, taken from the
Times, are subjoined:—
“The REMUNERATIon of MEDICAL MEN.—Yesterday, at the Fox Tavern, Paul
Street, Finsbury, an inquest was held by MR. H. RAffles WALTHEw, the deputy
Coroner, touching the death of Richard CLARKE, aged two years. MRs. M. CLARKE,
94, Paul Street, said that on Thursday last her son became ill. He had received a
fall some time before. On Friday morning, at half-past three o'clock, she noticed
the child getting stiff, and sent for DR. Buss. The doctor did not come for some
time. The delay was occasioned by his getting her husband to sign a paper .#
himself to pay 5s. The child was dead when he did come. The witness's husban
was a mechanic."
It is easy to understand how this simple statement so powerfully
affected the benevolent gentlemen to whom it was made as to prevent
them from considering the facts which it comprises with the calmness
of cold-blooded reason. They naturally felt that when a medical man
is informed by a poor mechanic that his child is ill and requires, attend-
ance, an instant inclination to rush to the child's bed-side should over-
whelm every other idea in the mind of the medical man. At such a
time, to be capable, for one moment, of thinking about so paltry an
object as that of securing a five-shillings fee, of course they considered
him, a mean unfeeling fellow. Accordingly, perhaps, they overlooked
the little circumstance that the delay of the doctor in going to see the
child was somewhat increased by the time which was occupied in getting
the child's own father to engage to pay the five shillings.
The facts, as above stated, were admitted by the medical man who
had been summoned to attend the deceased child, MR. HENRY Buss,
M.R.C.S. He pleaded, however, that:—
“. He was obliged to act thus to guard against imposition. He had to live by his
profession. Those who could not pay ought to apply to the parish doctor. If a
person asked him to go purely as an act of charity, he would attend.”
WOL. XLIII. X
This last declaration on the part of the witness the jury appear to
have entirely disregarded, in their large-hearted excitement created by
the notion of a doctor not .# jumping up and running off
without question or consideration to see the mechanic's child that he was
summoned to attend. Some of them might have been, Fº
mechanics themselves; who knows? Be that as it may, when the
coroner had summed up, and told them that the course pursued by DR.
Buss was not peculiar to that gentleman, they returned the .."...i
special verdict casting censure on the mercenary medical man, an
evincing fellow feeling with the poor mechanic:-
“That the deceased died from effusion of serum on the brain, and the jury desire
to express their regret that medical men should refuse to attend the r without
guaranteed payment. The jury consider that as such refusals are frequent, the
parish authorities should take it upon themselves to pay the fees for first visits of
medical men to poor persons in urgent cases, and the jury are of opinion that such
a provision would be the means of saving lives.”
The jury cannot be suspected of having had any conception of what
effusion of serum on the brain meant. Had they known that, their
minds might have been composed by the assurance that no promptitude
of attendance would have availed the patient. Perhaps, if they had
considered, their verdict less under the disturbing influence of their
higher feelings, they would have a little enlarged the expression of their
regret, above quoted. . They might have expressed their regret that any
medical men should have to depend upon their profession for their
living, and should be obliged to refuse to attend the poor without
guaranteed payment, in order to guard against ... The majority
of these liberal and enlightened jurors are probably tradesmen. Perhaps
there is a baker among them; perhaps there is a cheesemonger. , If so,
we may be sure that the baker is in the habit of supplying bread to the
hungry without stipulating for payment, and the cheesemonger is always
ready to contribute more than his mite, and add a bit.of gratuitous
double Gloucester to the eleemosynary loaf. Likewise, if those gentle;
men of the coroner's jury comprise a tailor, he is doubtless accustomed
to clothe the naked on the same unselfish terms.

pents' teeth are things,
in the words of my
friend a º
nobleman, resident in
the Haymarket, (I don't mean the wicked old Marquis whom you call the 'Hermit’
of that neighbourhood) which no fellow can be expected to understand. ...But as
for ingratitude, Sir, I think I have known a little of that—for instance, fellows in
trade, whom I have dealt with, and recommended, and puffed by wearing their
goods for years, have turned round upon me like serpents, and brought actions for
their mean bills. And, Sir, I have just seen a flagrant case of ingratitude to which
filinki should like to cali your attention.
“A lot of tenant farmers in Shropshire, in fact at a place called Ludlow, have been
getting into hot water with some º: neighbouring gentlemen. I don’t want to
into the cause of quarrel, but it seems to me that some of the farmers have been
etting their tongues go a little too valiantly over their liquor, and have forgot the
respect due to ifier betters. The end of it is that a gentleman, with whom I have
not the honour of being acquainted, SIR CHARLEs Boughton, and his brother have
withdrawn themselves from one of those agricultural societies down there-things
I could never understand, and which I am free to confess always seemed to me the
greatest bores in the world. But that is their business. Well, Sir, there does not
seem to have been any of that regret expressed that might have been expected, and
on the contrary, the principal offender with his tongue, a MR. MATTHEw Evans,
who, I understand, is a tenant farmer and an hotel-keeper, has forgotten his
manners so far as to write a letter, of which the following ungrateful passage is a
bit. You will excuse my having cut it out and sent it you, for though, like Lord
PALMERston, you have I dare say no time to read anything that is printed, you
cannot expect a fellow to copy all this.
“MR. MATTHEw EwANs says: —
“I have nothing to do with SIR CHARLEs's resignation, as I never hiss a gentleman or any
other man when speaking in public ; but I would warn Sir CHARLEs and gentlemen of his class,
to listen in time to their real friends, and not to a set of toadies, who are always ready for a day's
pleasant shooting and a dinner once a year to fawn upon the great man and persuade him that
his real friends, the poor farmers, are his greatest enemies, and always grumbling about game
that cannot injure any crop. SIR. B. Leighton I consider as long as he represents the county
public property, and as a freeholder I claim a right to express my opinion of his political acts."
“Now, Sir, I am not going to make any remark upon the rudeness of that sort
of writing. As for ‘toadies,” I suppose that when you go and see agentleman who
gives you shooting and dinners, and you can’t return the obligation in kind, having
neither shooting nor dinners to give, you are bound to be as civil and pleasant as

ODE TO FATHER THAMES.
ON HIS APPROACHING PURIFICATION.
OLD Father Thames, now long enough
Hast thou been pouring to the sea
Thy waters, tinged with hue of snuff.
By all of London's outshot stuff,
Save so much as she drinks of thee.
Soon must thou bear it all away,
And yet, a silver stream once more,
Fit thirst of mortals to allay,
Wash but the simple sand and clay
Of Middlesex and Surrey’s shore.
Thy tributaries, as of old,
hall be the rivulets and rills
That spring from crystal fountains cold
Or wind their way through virgin mould
Amid the verdure of the hills:
Not sluices, yielding thee supply
From chemic reservoirs and tanks,
Of odour strong and deep of dye;
Not fictile pipes, which underlie
The mighty cities on thy banks.
Their effluence all thou shalt receive,
Far hence, to mix it with the brine,
No dainty nostril there to grieve;
Unworked while husbandmen yet leave,
Unheeding swains! a plenteous mine.
Blackwall shall then a purer breed
Behold, in thy pellucid tide
Of whitebait, for the cleaner feed,
From ſeculent admixture freed,
More delicate than ever, fried.
The passenger of Chelsea boat
Unwonted salmon shall admire,
Where dogs and cats he used note,
Defunct that on thy breast did float,
Emitting exhalations dire.
Get thee, old Thames, another urn,
More gracious than thy present pail,
To pour fresh lymph; and no more churn
Pollution; for thy near return
To sweetness, BAzALGETTE all hail!
An Error on the Part of Mr. Smith.
“MAN,” says ADAM SMITH, “is an animal that makes
bargains.” We always thought it was lovely woman, who
evinced the greatest partiality, and certainly the greatest
skill, in making bargains. And what is a Bargain?—but
in most instances the temptation to buy something you do
not want, because you can get it for a trifle less. The most
expensive of wives is one who has the organ of cheapness
largely, we may say, unnaturally developed. It is supposed
to come under the head of Domestic Economy, but in most
cases it is domestic economy carried to extravagance. With
such a wife, you may go without your dinner, so long as she
can pick up a stuffed alligator as a Tremendous Bargain.

HAIR COOKED
LA MODE.
oME people have
singular ideas of
what is natural.
For instance º
- look at this ad-
vertisement:-
“THE SHILLING
HAIR-WAVER produ-
ces a beautifully-na-
tural wave of the
hairina few minutes,
without hot water or
anything injurious.”
The motion that
a “beautifully
natural” wave of
the hair can be
produced in a few
minutes by artifi-
cial means is one
that persons with-
out sense might
possibly put faith
in, but which peo-
le who have
A brains must find
* it hard to enter-
tain. This fact,
however, will not
much affect the
sale of the hair-
waver, for none
ut senseless
idiots would ever
dream of spending
money in the pur-
chase of an article
wherewith to give a wavy appearance to their hair. But, curling
fluids and hair-wavers, and all such useful articles, are expressly manu-
factured for people without brains, who, not having anything, inside
their head to cultivate, may be excused for the bestowal of such care
on its outside.
TARRAGONA AND TARRADIDDLES.
MR. PUNCH's intense conviction of the honesty of everybody who is
connected with tº: and his profound hatred and unutter-
able contempt for any - - -
evidence, that queer things are sometimes done on the Turf, induce him
to pounce with frantic avidity upon a new proof
that the Sheet with which we are so often told a field of racehorses
might be covered, is of the most snowy and dazzling whiteness. ...
ś evil persons (and in this golden age of forgery, garotting,
puffery, and swindle, such persons insist upon existing) have been
spreading certain scandals touching a recent race. It seems that two
noble animals (quadrupeds) named respectively Tarragona and Michel
Grove, contended for victory, and that according to the report of the
Duke of BEAUFoRT, LoRD, GLAsgow, and three other nobles of the
Jockey Club, there was an “extraordinary expression of public feelin
just before and during the match,” such expression taking the form o
‘loud hooting” directed against the jockey who rode Tarragona. Blaz-
ing with a just indignation, but, as became noblemen, eager to launch it
at the º heads, the stewards of the Jockey Club demanded an expla-
nation of this indecent phenomenon. A Committee was º: and
it took evidence. To the horror and disgust of the Turf noblesse, the
been made, and that Zarragona had been “pulled by her rider,” pulling
meaning the being held back from winning. No such thing had ever
been heard of in the racing world, since the days in which LORD
Ulysses, LoRD TypIDEs, and the other Greciansporting men peppered
LORD Achilles before the match between that, swift-footed party and
the horses, when—
“In all his arms arrayed,
The cumbrous equipage of war,
His speed he o'er the sand displayed,
Contending with the harnessed car.”
Consequently the amount of flabberghastation among the Lords of the
Turf was appalling. They rallied, however, their, blushes cooled, and
they went to work in the determined way that might be expected from
the blue blood. They called up the persons chiefly affected by the
#. belief, two gentlemen known as Colonel, Burnaby and the
onourable CAPTAIN ANNESLEY. and required their betting-books to be
given up for examination. An "expert, ’ that is, one of the individuals

autographs, was instructed to look at the entries in the books, which he
did with all optical advantages in the way of microscopes, telescopes,
stereoscopes, stethescopes, Raleidoscope, and any other kind of scopes
that were within his scope, and, moreover, ADMIRAL Rous, the
Rhadamanthus of the turf, not content with the expert's expertness,
looked at the books through his own opera-glass or something, by way
of treating himself to aº conviction on the subject. The result
shall presently be stated, but in the mean time, “the rich blood of peers
was set afire... by some observations which had been made on the sub-
jeet by MR: WILLEs, the great Turf critic, who keeps the wicked in hot
water by his contributions to the Morning Post, wherein he styles him.
self ARGUs. ... So, at a general meeting of the Jockey Club, whereat
about three times, as many Lords were present as are usually to be
beheld at prayers in the House at Westminster, there was a preliminary
debate about ARGUs, whom LoRD WINchelsea, formerly"our friend
Wiscount MAIDSTONE (and rather a free hand with the pen in the old
Jays, but never mind that now), wanted to castigate in some way.
Certainly, milder counsels were put forward, and the aristocratic meeting
was asked to resolve that it “was of opinion that it was not expedient
to take notice of anonymous writers in public prints.” Now as in the
circles where such matters have interest, “ARGus” is just about as
anonymous a writer as “S. G.O.” for philanthropists, “MERgator" for
money folks, “S.” for Americans, or “JAcob OMNIUM" for sensible
to get rid of the fiery WINCHELSEA by a little side-door. But on the
division the common sense of the Lords and their friends prevailed, the
anonymous plea was scouted, and it was less wisely agreed by 13 to 7
that ARGUs should be asked to apologise. Then,
“ARGus slain for all his hundred eyes,”
the meeting adjourned—the Herculean task having exhausted it.
“Stradbroke undoes his vizor clasp
And Coventry for air must gasp,
And CHESTERFIELD has quit his spear,
And fails thy falchion, Rous severe,
The blows of Uxbridge fall less fast,
And gallant Wilton's bugle blast
Hath lost its lively tone,
Sinks, WINchELse A, thy battle word,
And GREVILLE's shout is fainter heard,
“The Public shan't be done l’”
Refreshed, like the sun, or a giant, the Club met again, and proceeded
to its real business, the washing of the Sheet. And after a debate in
which the evidence was considered, and the matter, argued with all the
energy, which belongs to a Lord in earnest, the following decision was
arrived at:—
“It is not proved that Colonel Burn ABY intended that Tarragona should be
pulled in her match with Michel Grove, or that he made a fictitious bet with CAPTAIN
ANNESLEY."
“Not Proven” is the Scottish verdict returned in the Tarragona
0.
To which Mr. Punch can only add that it was very thoughtless of
oRI, MAGAULAY, not to write a line that would admit of a closer
parody, and therefore Mr. Punch must manipulate the poet, and say—
“Ho! friends of Tarragona
Is not the Sheet washed white?”
THE MODERN BABYLON PROWED QUITE A BABY.
AMONGst our multifarious reading, we have picked up the following
instructive fact, which reduces our overgrown metropolis to the small
dimensions of a Little Pedlington:—
“The largest city in the world, says a Spanish journal, is not London, but Jeddo,
the capital of Japan, which consists of 1,500,000 houses, inhabited by 5,000,000 souls.
Several streets are twenty-two miles long.”
A street “twenty-two miles long " must be a pretty stiff Long Aere
or a postman, who has to deliver letters in that district. It must be
rather awkward, too, for a drunken man, who mistakes his end of the
*: and has to walk to the extreme end before he can find his right

Episcopal Fragment.
“DR. ColeNso, Sir, don't talk to me about him,” said a rather
worldly prelate to the unworldly Bishop, PUNCH, “he ought to be sent
to an asylum, Sir DR. Tuke ought to have charge of him, and stop
his scribbling.” “DR. ColeNso has already met your Lordship's views,”
said Bishop PUNCH meekly; “he has been giving up the Pen to Tuke.”
“If you can joke on such a subject, Sir,” said his Lordship, turning
into his stockbroker's, “why—”

THERE are hands by hundred thousands
In the crowded North,
Empty, idle, yet for labour,
ot for alms stretched forth.
Hands all thin and white and bloodless,
Free from stain or soil, -
Hands struck helpless, yet so willing
If they could to toil!
Hands that failing fitting labour,
Cannot long forbear,
Or to clench in desperation,
Or to fold in prayer.
Whirr of working wheels is silent,
Chimneys smoke no more:
Famine and her sister Fever
Knock at every door.

Here are hearts by hundred thousands
..Full of ruth and pain,
Till those hands struck sudden idle,
Are at work again.
Humble hearts whose mite is ready,
Hungrier mouths to feed: -
Haughty hearts, brought low by thinking
Oſ their brothers’ need.
Hearts that only seek for channels
Wherein best may go,

Charged to overflow.
Then to work through clay and gravel,
Dull rock, thirsty sands,
From these brimming hearts make passage
To those failing hands.
JUDGES’ JUSTICE.
A CASE is tried before MR. JUSTICE CROMPTON, and a verdict is
iven for the defendant. One of the jurymen thereupon writes to the
ucky defendant, with a “Please to remember the poor jury, your
Honour. They found your Honour a mice, clean verdict.” In other
words, this juryman asks the winner to pay the jury money. The other
jurymen are indignant.
“The Box impeach him, SERIEANT P. harangues,
The Court condemns him, and the Juror—
No, not “hangs,” like Sir Balaam, nor was it to be wished, but we
think that he ought not to have been exactly rewarded. It is asked
that his name be mentioned, MR. Justice QRoMPTON orders that his
name be concealed, thereby leaving the other jurors under the cloud of
suspicion, and, further, MR. Justice CROMPTON directs that the juror
in question be not put on a jury any more, an exemption which
hundreds of honest men would gladly give fifty pounds to purchase.
Had the judge who thus rewarded the juror been one of our country
justices, we, in our impartiality, should have felt it our duty to be

The out-going proprietor having only had a terminable interest, has
not laid out upon the property any of the income arising out of the

development of its resources.
The Mineral and Agricultural Resources are Enormous, only requiring

There is a trifling debt on the . but this might be extinguished
on easy terms, the interest being considerably in arrear, and º

or one who can command English capital and securities, will met

SLAVERY AND SOHOOLING.
WE believe the height of impudence has been variously defined; but
an example of it clearly is a notice like the following, which a corre-
spondent sends us from the Islington Gazette:–
OVERNESS.—WANTED, a Person to instruct Children three hours
daily. Terms, 30s. per quarter.
It is not stated what this “person” will be required to teach, nor
how many are the children whom daily for three hours she will have
under her charge. There may be ten or twelve of them, for aught
that one can teli. and the “person” may be wanted to instruct
them all in every branch of learning and accomplishment, and every
known language from French, say, to Feejee. Drawing, dancing, and
deportment, plain cookery and crochet, mathematics, music, and the
. of the globes, instruction in all these may be required for the
children, whose number is indefinite, as are their ages and their sex;
and four or five of them may possibly require some special teaching, say
in horsemanship, gymnastics, swimming, dancing on the tight-rope, or
feats on the trapëze.
For this instruction the “person” who undertakes, the place is
promised the allowance of one pound ten per quarter, which (supposing
she is not required to teach on Sundays) will yield her, as we calculate,
not quite a penny ha'penny for each of the three hours wherein her
services as governess are daily in demand. , Well, this a free country,
and we know there are no slaves in it; but the “person” who accepts a
situation such as this will be treated like a slave in one respect at any
rate, that is in working pretty hard without getting any pay for it.

A COMIC TOWN COUNCIL.
THE late DANIEL O'Connell, in a war of chaff with a notorious
beldam, succeeded in upsetting his abusive antagonist by telling her that
she .# a hypotenuse in her house. A strong family likeness, in point
of intelligence, may be recognised as existing between this old woman
and a gentleman named in the subjoined extract from the Post:-
“At a special meeting of the Gloucester Town Council, last week, a warm dis-
cussion arose with regard to a certain tender for ironwork, in the course of which
MR. KENDALL maintained, notwithstanding the dogma of a certain MR. SMITH, that
he was perfectly right in ascertaining whether the Town could save any portion of
this outlay by accepting a tender for the ironwork alone. A MR, HAwkins then
rose and said, ‘I cannot sit here and hear such a word as “dogma” applied to MR.
SM1th. (Laughter.) When I once asked a question, Mr. Krºndall, spoke of his seven-
teen years' experience at this table ; and I say it is not creditable to any person
who uses such inflammatory language as “dogma." (Oh, oh / and loud laughter.)"
MR. Hawkins, by his last quoted remark, appears to have meant to
express the opinion that the use of such inflammatory language as
“dogma” was not creditable to anybody who had had seventeen years'
experience at the table of the Gloucester Town Council. Taking
“dogma,” with that gentleman, as an opprobrious expression, we have
no doubt that he was quite right, and that the Gloucester Town Council
is creditably distinguished from most other similar bodies by abstinence
from the use of strong language. MR. KENDALL, however, cannot be
considered to present a very striking exception in this respect to his
municipal colleagues. His ensuing reply to the accusation of having
used such inflammatory language as dogmais certainly milder than what
would have been given by a disputant more studious of conciseness
than of forbearance:—
“MR. KENDALL. Does the poor man know the English language? Will you tell
us the meaning of the word? I venture to say you do not know.”
(Not a very bold assertion, MR. KENDALL.)
“You wanted to say something, and did not know what. You are an ignorant
man.”
Whether MR. KENDALL did or did not “suspect” MR. HAwkINs's
“ place,” he did, perhaps, more than suspect his ears; yet he only gave
the reporter occasion to write him down an ignorant man.
To the accusation of ignorance, we are told that “MR. HAwKINs
attempted some reply, but amidst the confusion and laughter which
revailed he was quite inaudible.”. This is to be regretted; for if he
ad been heard he would very likely in justifying his protest against the
word dogma, have said something else as good.
MR. HEANE, a peacemaker, then rose and said:—
“I am not fond of quarrelling, and I now rise to throw oil on the troubled waters.
MR. PAx Ford SMITH is an old friend of mine—much more so than MR. KENDALL,
but I think on this occasion MR. SMITH is decidedly in the wrong.”
MR. HEANE's oil appears to have had the desired effect of making
matters smooth, unless the breast of Town Councillor HAwkINs re-
mained ruffled by the remembrance that he had been called an ignorant
man, and the anticipation that he would be º written down.
The interpellation thus terminated, together with the debate:—
“MR. KENDALL. Mr. Mayor, will you do me the favour to say whether the mean-
ing of the word “dogma' is offensive 2 (Laughter.)—The MAYor. I think MR. HAw-
KINs has made a mistake and put a wrong meaning on the word. (Renewed Laughter.)
The resolution was then put and carried mem. con."
His Worship the MAYor, it appears, declined to commit himself to
the express decision that the word dogma was not offensive; though he
thought that MR. HAwkINs was mistaken in regarding it as inflammatory
language. We are afraid there will prove j. no mistake about it as
far as MR. HAwkINs is personally concerned. It is too probable that
whoever mentions the word dogma to him henceforth will make him
very angry.
The Municipal debates reported in the local papers, are mostly, dull
reading, because they are very lengthy and relate to insignificant
matters; but they would afford considerable amusement provided that,
as in the case which has suggested the preceding observations, they
consisted chiefly of the altercations and personalities which, with the
exception of the Town. Council of Gloucester, are the rule at the
majority of such assemblies.
A Skedaddle Ticket.
WE should advise DR. CUMMING to emigrate, for on the principle
that “no man is a Prophet in his own country,” he may be a very good
Prophet abroad, since there is not the slightest chance of his ever being
one in England. The only question is whether, as a Prophet, the
Doctor has not been abroad all his life.
House-To-House VisitATION.—No one does it so regularly, so
effectually, so perseveringly, so punctually, as the Tax-gatherer. The
fellow seems to have quite a call for the business.

agree to run over with MR. WINDHAM WAREHAM to Paris for a

mised to rejoin her at Brighton. MRs. NAGGLETON instantly came
to London, and, on the night of the following interview had gone to a
party. The scene is in the parlour at South Kensington. MR. NAG-
GLEToN has been pacing the room for about two hours, occasionally
smoking, trying to read, and looking savagely at the clock. At length

ou had called at your place of business in the City—that is, if you
have one, everything is kept a mystery from me—you would have found
a note saying 1 was home.
Mr. N. I hastened down as fast as I could.
Mrs. N. Then, don't abuse me for not having supposed that you
would act in that schoolboy fashion. After staying away a week, you
might have stayed the additional hour it would have taken you to call
in the City.... .
Mr. N. This is my return for an endeavour to show you attention.
Mrs. N. My dear HENRY, I take your intentions and all that for
granted, and you need not have recourse to awkward demonstrations.
Mr. M. Why did you leave Brighton
Mrs. N. Because I pleased. It does not suit me to be left at an
hotel by myself.
Mr. N. I wrote from Paris to tell you to ask MRs. BALTIMoRE to
come and stay with you for the few days I should be absent. ..
Mrs. N. Did you? I didn't have the letter, as you have discovered,
and if I had I should have done nothing of the kind. "Why am I to
pay MRs. BALTIMORE’s hotel bills?
Mr. N. You ?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And after what you confessed at Brighton of the
state of your affairs, I felt that it was not for two of us, HENRY, to be
spending money in travelling and at hotels. If you require that costl
º it is for your wife to make up for it by economy and self-
enlal.
Mr. M. If you can spoil my holiday, either when with you or without
you, MARLA, you do. Had I the slightest wish to shorten your
sea-visit *
Mrs. N. (in hopeless resignation). I—don't—know, but you took, the
most direct means to do it. You must be out of your senses to think
that I should be staying at the Bedford while you are, living, at the
Louvre. That is indeed what you would, I suppose, call igniting the
candle at each extremity.
Mr. N. The Louvre You might as well say that I had been at the
Tuileries. We went to a quiet # class bachelor hotel behind the
Opéra Comique, and dined at three francs. Isaved so much upon the
Brighton week that I actually bought you a ring with the surplus. . .
Mrs. N. As I detest Palais Royal jewellery, perhaps you will get rid
of it in some other way. I am not quite a baby, to be insulted for a
week, and then to have my mouth stopped with a piece of paste.
Mr. N. What do you mean by insulted, MRs. NAGGLETON ?
Mrs. N. What I say. A man who leaves his wife under a false
retence that he is going to town for the night, and then skulks off to
}. without giving her the chance of accompanying him, may not be
the sort of person to understand that he insults her, but if he has any
respectable friends he had better ask their opinion. I could see what
CAPTAIN and MRs. SILVERDALE thought about it, though they had too
much good taste to say anything.
Mrs. W. º
Mr. W. CAPTAIN Silver DALE’s opinion of what is due to a woman is,
certainly valuable, for his first wife had to sue him for maintenance.
Mrs. W. The mind that delights in the reproduction of forgotten
scandals must be indeed low, but I suppose such information is part of
the advantages of your bachelor travelling.
Mr. W. Y
from tºº, grating influence of your incessant reproaches. . .
Mrs. N. Do not say that word, HENRY. The time for reproaching
you has long gone by-we reproach only where we hope to impress.
Sometimes in self-defence against unjust charges, I may venture on a
word, but it is met with a violence which makes me shudder, and it is
but seldom that Irisk it. - -
Mr. M.. I never used a violent expression to you in all my life, but
by Jove, if .." can’t see that it º make any fellow angry to get no
answer to his letters, and be made run up and down to Brighton for
nothing—
Mrs. W. What is the fare to Brighton and back? -
Mr. N. It isn't that, and you know it, a sovereign is nothing, but—
Mrs. N. Stop the amount out of the next cheque you give me
for my housekeeping, and please say no more about it. I will gladly
º some little personal comfort for the sake of a cessation of
attack.
Mr. M. Such a cruel and unfair speech requires no answer.
Mrs. N. Being neither cruel nor unfair, it admits of none. How long
have you been home?
Mr. N. Above two hours. - -
Mrs. N. And what train did you go down to Brighton by ?
Mr. N. The three o'clock.
. Mrs. W. Ah!. Then with all your hurry you managed to stay and
dine at the Bedford, and I hope you enjoyed yourself. ... Perhaps you
took MR. WINDHAM WAREHAM, and treated him, out of gratitude for
his taking care of you at the Louvre.
Mr. N. I. repeat, MRs. NAGGLETON, that I never set my foot in the
Louvre, and as for dinner, I had had nothing to eat since an exceedingly
bad breakfast at Boulogne.
Mrs. N. Pray don't apologise to me... If I ever º against the
squandering of money I am instantly silenced by a fierce reminder that
it is you who earn it. I suppose that the children will be brought up,
or º ed up, some way, though I suppose I ought not to mention
§: children to a father who comes home and never even asks after
€rn.
Mr. N. As if I had not seen them all two hours ago, while their
mother was diverting herself at a ball.
Mrs. N. You don't mean that you have been cruel enough to disturb
them at this time of night....Are you wild?
. Mr. M. (triumphantly). The fact was you woke them all up with your
ringing bells and calling servants, while you were getting ready to go
out at eleven, instead of going to bed as you ought to fº done, an
they were all alive and i. to see me. Also, they were good enough
not to reject some little things I brought them over.
Mrs. M. (seriously º Upon my word, HENRY, you do not
deserve to have children. declare I never heard of anything so
wº wicked in the whole course of my life.
p Mr. N. Rather a strong expression, considering that you read the
apers.

the whole district of the Seven Dials who, to gratify his own selfishness,

Sleep.
Mr. W. Ha! haſ No, my dear, not their first, but wº for what
would have been their second, if their mother had been a littleless noisy
in her eagerness to go out and dance among the other young people.
Mrs. N. It may be enough answer to your coarseness to say that I
have not danced the whole evening.
Mr. N. I am glad that you—or partners—had so much sense of the
fitness of things. I trust that you made a good supper.
Mrs. N.Yes, for, MR. S.NotchLEY knows how to give aº supper,
and is neither profuse or niggardly in the wrong place. He considers
that half his guests are ladies, and arranges for their comfort, instead of
thinking mainly of providing his male friends with the means of taking
too much. It was a beautiful supper, and though its merits would have
been lost upon you, I wished you #. been there to take example from
MR. SNOTCHLEY how to attend to everybody.
Mr. N. Ah! dearman, and it is the more to his credit, as everybody
makes a point of not attending to him when he gets on his legs.
Mrs. N. If you mean that he is too much of a gentleman to conde-
scend to retail jokes, and to repeat prepared buffoonery, you are right:
he has mixed in the best society.
Mr. N. Mixed what? Punch, or only grog? I know he was some-
thing in some Swell's household.
Mrs. N. He was tutor to an Earl and a Wiscount.
Mr. N. I neverexpected to feel so much pity for the aristocracy.
Mrs. N. You may sneer, but ladies know how to distinguish between
yulgar smartness and the highbred pleasantness of one who has moved
in gobd circles. A lady near me said that MR. SNOTCHLEY’s manner
reminded her very much of the Bishop of Oxford.
Mr. N. I don't know why it shouldn't, for SNOTCHLEY's father was a
soap-boiler. -
MRs. NAGGLETON considers for a moment, and then the ºffeet of this
; of irreverence and vulgarity is too much for her, and she retires
hastily.
Mr. N. (enjoying his vile victory). Well, the idea of likening that
platitudinous ass to a splendid fellow like Saponaceous SAMUEL! but
women are as great fools in their likes as their dislikes.

A STRONG MIND AND A WEAK WRITER.
We thought that strong-minded women were somewhat dying out,
but here is a clear proof that the race is not extinct:—
O FREE-THINKERS and Others-An intellectual and accomplished
Lady, aged 35, wishes for EMPLOYMENT, Literary, Educational, or Domestic;
... or non-resident. Would give German or Music Lessons, for two hours daily,
for a home.
A lady who will own in print that she is aged thirty-five, clearly
must be one possessing a strong mind. We doubt if even Mrs. Blimber,
when she advertised for pupils, had the courage to put forth a statement
of her age, at least aſter she had passed the feminine climacteric,
which, we will assume, is twenty.
The lady does not state if she lierself be a ſree-thinker, but there is
very little question of her being a free-speaker; for it is evidenced
not only by confession of her age, but by the latitude she gives herself
in speaking of her wishes. From the statement she puts forth we
have some trouble in deciding if she wants to be a governess or a maid-
of all-work; and although the terms are in some cases synonymous, we
think an “intellectual” lady should not wantonly confound them. By
saying that, she wishes for “domestic employment” the advertiser
plainly may be held to be desirous of a place as cook or housemaid; and
if this be her, ambition, she ought, besides informing us that she is
“intellectual,” to have made especial mention that, among her, other
qualities, she is “accomplished”, in the art of making pies and pud-
dings, and in doing other work which a domestic has to do.

ease with which he changes his coat every year. The number of colours

A FRIENDLY NOTICE.
THERE are at least some Manchester men who have not
been backward in coming forward to relieve the terrible
distress in Lancashire caused by the Cotton Famine. “On
the 14th of 10th month, 1862,” at a meeting held by a body
of Manchester Friends, a committee was appointed to draw
up an Appeal to Friends in general on i. of the starv-
inig sufferers. The remark obviously suggested by this
proceeding is that a Friend in need is a Friend indeed; but
an observation more, perhaps, to the purpose, which we
may make, is, that the Committee in question is composed
of the Friends whose names follow:—
“Treasurer:-Josiah MERRick, Spring Gardens
“Secretary:—FREDERick Cooper, 28, Brown Street.
“JAMEs Bryce, Oldham Street.

BACHELORS BY CRINOLINE.
MY DEAR MRs. Dovecote,
MANY are the objections which brutes of men have raised
against the amplitude of dress and the protuberance of petticoat which
have lately been in fashion with your charming sex. But there is one point
which has been but sparingly alluded to, and yet it |...}. is the one
which, I think, would have the greatest weight with ladies like yourselſ.
If Crinoline were viewed as an impediment to marriage, surely it would
find but little ſavour in the eyes of ladies who, like you, have daughters
to dispose of. And are there not fair grounds for believing that big
petticoats have hindered many a young man from taking the bold
§ which would put an end to his bachelor existence? Many a
ellow thinks he can afford to keep a wife, but finds his courage fail him
at the thought that he will also have to keep her wardrobe. When
starting for Chamounix with his alpenstock and knapsack, he sees his
old friend ToMKINs, who last Spring committed matrimony, setting
forth for a month's travel with his wife and eighteen boxes, to say
nothing of shawls, dressing-cases, parasols and work baskets, and other
articles of luggage which are always being lost. He then thinks, could
he afford a tour with such expensive luxuries? and if a wife requires so
many dresses when she travels, how vast must be her wardrobe when
she is at home ! So he º: his pipe * way of consolation for his
solitude, and as the graceful wreaths arise, he meditates on marriage as
a bliss beyond the reach of such poor devils as himself, and resolves
therefore to make his miserable life happy as a bachelor best may.
Now, my dear MRs. Doy EcoTE, is not this a sad, sad picture: and
should we not in charity do what we can to help these poor benighted
bachelors, and remove the hindrance which prevents their entering the
blissful marriage state?... Crinoline itself is not a costly article, but large
dresses require more silk or stuff than small ones; and the wider are
the dresses, the longer are the bills for them. Moreover, there is a
belief, it may be an unfounded one, that ladies with large dresses want
large houses to match; and so through press of Crinoline, men often
pay more rent than they can well afford, and sometimes get thereby
presented at the Basinghall Street Court.”
WOL. XLIII.
Viewing, therefore, Crinoline as being in some sort an impediment to
marriage, my dear Madam, pray exhort, your matronly acquaintances
to lose no time in getting up an anti-Crinoline Society, which, every
British mother should be desired to join. Some people think that
ladies will never leave off Crinoline until they are ordered by their
dressmaker to do so. But if mothers had the courage just for once to
act in defiance of their milliners, I think that marriageable daughters
might be found in more request.
I remain, my dear Madam, the ladies' best companion and adviser,

“DON'T BOTHER ME.”
TheRE is a capital story going round the papers touching what is
called the restoration of the power of speech to an aged person, called
MARY DEAN, at a place called Oreston. The old lady had been dumb
for fifty or sixty years, but on her being at length moved to wrath by
being told to go on an errand, indignation brought back her faculty of
utterance, ...; she exclaimed “Don’t bother me!” It is refreshing to
hear of a person having been silent for half a century or more, and then
breaking silence to request that she might not be “bothered.” Mr.
Punch has an idea that the statues of a good many deceased celebrities,
whose silence has been genuine, but to whose supposed beliefs, opinions,
prophecies, and sentiments, reference is perseveringly, made by their
escendants, would if “stones were known to speak,” open their
mouths to much the same effect as MARY DEAN, in answer to the ma.
jority of appeals now made to them. Possibly MR, Pitt and the DUKE
of WELLINGTON, after hearing Conservative orations, MR, Fox and
MR. GRATTAN, in reply to Liberal invocations, and certainly GEORGE
WASHINGTON, when buncombe spouters to an acre of mob are clamouring
to his Shade, would be inclined, “from information received,” to say
“Don’t bother me.” This is the only moral Mr. Punch has been able
to distil from an anecdote upon which about eleven thousand correspon
dents have desired his opinion, and he begs in conclusion to repeat the
words of MARY DEAN.

SOME ODIOUS COMPARISONS.
18Y A CONTRIBUTOR JUST OFF HIS HOLIDAY RAMBLES.
CHAPTER THIRD.
WHEN I gave a title to these articles I proclaimed their comparisons
to the world as “odious.” It seems by the following letter that they
have been found so.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, “Manchester, Nov. 7, 1862.
“A great many of your articles are very good and most amusing, but the
two you published in this and last week's numbers, on railway travelling, hotels,
&c., on the Cºntinent, are such perfect nonsense, that you should really be deeply
ashamed of making a fool of yourself in printing them in your journal. You criti.
sised in a biting style MR. AsSoLANT's articles, and rightly, for they deserved it well,
but allow me to tell you that your Englishman's observations are such stuff, that
anybody'who knows a little of these matters and who has less prejudices, will at
once see that these observations are as stupid, or even much more stupid, than any
of MR. Assol.ANT's or AssoMANT's, as you please to call him. Confer the latter
title, to your rambler, you would but serve him well, and by this express the
opinion of
“ANYBody who has been ABRoad.”
Is this crushing blow administered by a Manchester-German, who is
outraged by my strictures on foreign railways, or by a Manchester inn-
keeper, who revolts at my attack upon English hotels?
In either case I console myself by the thought that my arrow must
have gone home, or it would not rankle. I bow meekly to the imputa-
tion of stupidity. I don't profess to be brilliant. I only attempt to tell
some truths, as they seem to me, in matters much affecting the com-
forts of all who travel.
If there be people—not German—who consider foreign railways—
especially German railways—pleasant and well-man ; or English
hotels comfortable and well-ordered, I can only say that their experiences
have been ſortunate, or that their tastes are peculiar. Of course, if m
critic be a German, his wrath is intelligible. He doesn’t see the hard.
ship of being bullied by a man in uniform; and considers it the normal
condition of railway travellers to be crammed ten in a carriage and to
go sixteen miles an hour.
But after all, he my Manchester friend British or Deutsch, there is
nothing like conflict of opinions. Smart collisions knock the dust of
prejudice out of ideas, and by much attrition the fire of truth is likeliest
to be lighted. With this good-humoured comment on my angry com-
mentator, let me continue, pace Mancunii, my “stuff and nonsense.”
The truth is, I ſancy, that English hotels may be expected to improve
as soon as John BULL begins to travel in En ń. i.e., to journey for
his pleasure and otherwise than by railway. Even now there are a few
British caravanserais which can stand comparison with foreign ones, for
comfort and cost. These are all in the few and favoured parts of these
islands which John Bull, visits for enjoyment as heyisits foreign parts.
You will find such oases in the Lake Country, North Wales, the High-
lands. Here are still hotels, to which, the Englishman may take a
foreigner without blushing—places in which a smack of country home-
liness and heartiness leavens the hungriness and hard measure of hotel.
keeping—where a trace of the farm-house, or way-side public still corrects
the hollow pretentiousness of the bran-new and many-windowed barrack,
that tells .." excursion-trains and sudden influx of the cheap holiday-
keeping masses. In such places we may still see grey roofs, a lawn
with flower-clumps and well-kept turf, and climbing roses about the
windows. Here is to be found something like the comfort of an English
fireside eyen in a coffee-room; some relish of honesty and fair dealing
in the things given you to eat and drink–wholesome bread and unlarded
butter, well fedweiſkilled well-dressed roast and boiled, barn-door fowls,
barley-fed bacon, genuine tea, real cream and sound beer, clean linen
and tolerable attendance, and all at a cost not altogether beyond the
stretch of modest purses. - -
Of course, in such places, the intelligent traveller will bound his
expectations and demands by the ways and means of the establishment.
He will not ask for entrées, or cheap table-wine, or for a well-ordered
dinner in any artistic sense of the word. He must take, a rustic
banquet, but hº good are such, when they are #}. of their kind! In
these lies the real strength of our country if she did but know it, Abroad
in the humblest establishment, you find the man-cook installed, and all
artistic conception of dinner, as consisting of the established elements—
soup, entrečs, fish, roast, º and dessert, in their local permuta-
tions and combinations. The dinner may be detestable and dirty, but
it is regularly composed. The mischief is when the same sort of thing
is attempted at home, without any true sense of its requirements, any
aptitude, or needful appliances for it. And this mockery is growing
in London, as one my see from the adyertisements of such would-be

This sort of thing is as yet abominable masquerading and make.believe

that “ici on parle Français” is the inscription on the gates of the lower

the door of these London dining, establishments which publish French
bills of fare. The old English Chop-house is a native institution, like
nothing else, and having merits and meats of its own unattainable in
foreign countries. We are getting too fine for this; and yet the popular

mind has not in fact advanced beyond it. When we leave this safe
solid semi-savage region of plain joints, chops, and steaks, we middle-
class English wander in a limbo º culinary Shams, and what CARLYLE
would call “wind-baggeries and wiggeries” of the kitchen; we have
lost our hold of the “veracities,” and come to grief, as may be
cxpected. - -
Now in the English lakes, among the Welsh mountains, and in the
Highland straths and glens, this aping of foreign ways is, still happily,
almost unknown. If the traveller will content himself with the rustic
fare of the region—the ſish of the lake, the mutton of the hillside, the
fowl of the barn-door, he may eat wholesomely, nay, enjoyingly, and at
moderate cost. But he must eschew made-dishes, and stick to home.
brewed. Light cheap and wholesome wine, it is conceived, has not
yet made its way to these places. Then the traveller must hardly
yet, in any of these places, as far as I know them, expect a rationally
furnished bed-room. The faith in the four-postcr still lingers in even the
best of these houses of entertainment. Indeed, the homelier and honester
they are, as a rule, the more old-fashioned their furniture and fittings."
ust as unfamiliar in these hostelries as in
The tub, I need hardly say, is
the remotest regions of Calabria or Auvergne. Tub! Why even the
opening of bed-room windows is a practice still frowned upon, and con-
sidered unwholesome in such houses. Ten to one, you will find the
ſcather-bed uppermost, and the pillow as much too limp as the bed is
too plump and puffy. These, however, are matters on which the mis-
sionary labours of intelligent travellers may be expected gradually, to
diffuse light. There are regions of the Highlands in which the tub has
all cady been preached; and the light iron-bedstead and hard maltrass
|. º successfully implanted, I believe, in more than one Lake
lotel.
In these and other matters whereon light is needed, there is, at last,
some hope for the country inn. MURRAY has begun to publish a series
of Handbooks for England. It was only natural that he should have
been long in coming to this. He has produced his invaluable series
much in the order of travelling-resort, beginning with the Rhine,
Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, then going on to less trodden
regions, as Spain and Russia and the Scandinavian kingdoms, next
reaching father a field to Syria and Albania, Greece, Egypt, and the
Holy Land. And now, having mapped out the travelling geography
of these comparatively frequented routes, he has come to the terra
...” of England, in which the English traveller has yet to break
ground. -
MURRAY may do much to undo the work of the railway. As the
latter has ruined the enjoyment and excitement of home-travelling, the
former may gradually revive the fashion, and open up to his country:
men districts now as strange to all but the natives of them as Central
Africa or the Australian middle . as rich in glories of natural or
cultivated beauty as Italy or Rhineland, as full of buried treasures of
architecture and art as Nineveh or the two Sicilies. -
But the railway has hitherto been the real blight of home-travelling.
Can MURRAY resist the railway ? That is a very doubtful question.
The evil influences on travelling and its comforts, of the rail, that
ruling power of our iron-age, are too serious to be dealt with at the
fag-end of an article.
OUR ANCESTRY.
To M.R. PUNCH.
“SIR,
“I THINK we are at length getting rid of the great difficulty—
What is man? for there seems good reason to believe that he is radically
and really a fish.
“Read from MR. DARwin on The Origin of Species the following
#: which does not seem to have attracted as yet that attention it
eserves :-
“I can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have
descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype, of which we know
nothing, furnished with a float-apparatus or swim-bladder."
“This doctrine may, at first view, appear startling to some; but we
should be cautious in refusing it our belief. Had Mr. DARwiN, in
addition to the facts he adduces in support of his views, wielded the
hilological argument touched upon by DEAN TRENch, in his Study of
ords, he might have made his case stronger, and to many more satis-
factory. For if we can, from the careful study of a people's language
pretty correctly conclude what they were, or whence they sprang,
think we must admit that MR. DARwin has the philological argument
on his side in this matter. What is more common than to hear an
individual characterised as “a queer fish,” or, addressed, ‘Give us your
fin?’ Then how easy it is, in the case of any two individuals appa.
rently little dissimilar, to make “fish, of one and flesh of another.’
Under certain circumstances and conditions of life, an individual is
described as getting “pale about the gills,” or being ‘like a fish out of
the water,’ and that, according to M. DARwin’s theory, in a sense
more appropriate and profound than may generally be attached to the
expression. To what source then are we to trace such usages of
anguage, if we reject his theory? He must be a dull man indeed who
does not perceive, that they are strongly in favour of it. And, more.
over, when we take these usages in connection with the fact that we
lately had amongst us an actual live talking fish, it appears inconsistent
with sound reasoning to doubt that that talking fish was the missing
link, in this quarter, found; and that the question as to our ancestry is
thus decided.
“You, yourself, Sir, did good service, the other week, to the cause of
this scientific investigation in its more advanced stage, by pointing out
that, the missing link between man and the Gorilla is undeniably found
in the Irish Yahoo. And it is to be hoped that, as ray after ray of
light, thus dawns upon us, we shall in due time be able to complete the
family register.
“I am, Sir, your Obedient Servant,

Mov. 15th, 1862.”
A REAL NATIVE.
LIMERICK LITERATURE.
It may not seem to most persons very important what an leishman
says about anything. But when what an Irishman supposes to be his
thoughts get into º the warning brogue is lost—one would not
insult the rattlesnake by mentioning the warning rattle—and a hasty
reader may feel annoyed at what he supposes to be an English or Scotch
utterance. A newspaper published in Limerick has been sent to
Mr. Punch, and this paper actually keeps a correspondent, who has
yentured on some comments on one of Mr. Punch's immortal poems.
The correspondent calls bad names, which he consistently spells badly,
but one would not be hard upon such an animal. The only point to
which Mr. Punch would advert, is the evidence the correspondent
affords of the standard of general and historical information in Papist
literature. He quotes Mr. Punch's affectionate description of Queen
Omphale, and aſter the lines
“And of all the kings of the southern land,
Her beau ideal was FERDINANd."
adds,-
“Just so—because FERDINAND was the victim of a vile conspiracy. His noble
wife is now, and has been for some time, at Marseilles for the benefit of sea air; but
the liars of the English press say she has gone into a nunnery in Germany.”
The poor Papist is not even up in the history of his own saints and
martyrs. He has never heard of the FERDINAND the petticoat
embroiderer to whom Mr. Punch referred. The Limerick enlightener
thinks that Mr. Punch meant the wretched BoMBALINo. Now, as any
history would tell the cultivated gentleman, the FERDINAND, who
embroidered petticoats for the Virgin was FERDINAND VII. of Spain,
and if his ºi. wife is now at Marseilles, it is very odd, as she was
supposed to have been poisoned by her priests in 1806, on account of
her enlightened opinions, and at all events was buried in that year.
However, no great matter. But if the Limerick editor does not think
his elegant correspondent quite good enough for those who read him,
Mr. Punch may conſer a service by mentioning that another Gorilla has
landed, alive, at Liverpool (a place in England) and may be open to an
engagement.

PET-LOVE.
Old—what shall we call her? “RUN, Robert RUN | THERE's THAT DARLING PLAYING WITH A STRANGE CHILD!"
ENGLAND, THE TIGRESS.
(From the New York Herald.)
ANother insult to the citizens of this mighty and glorious republic,
another outrage from perfidious Albion, as she is well called by noble
and gallant France, the home of freedom and civilisation. Qur blood
would boil over if it were worth while, on perusing the despatches
brought by the last mails, but we have concluded to treat the miserable
...i. with the contempt they merit. Yet, American citizens should
comprehend the depth of brutality and cowardice to which England has
descended, in her hatred for this great and mighty country, which she
has plunged into war through her diabolical machinations, at the accursed
bidding of her fiendlike aristocracy.
ENGLAND HAS REFUSED TO JOIN FRANCE IN ASKING US TO LEAVE OFF
FIG htLNG.
Do you hear that, men of America? Do you hear that, heroes of a
hundred fights? Íño you hear it too, you five acres of freemen who
stood to listen to the spirit-stirring eloquence of the Irish warrior who
dwells among you. England, appealed to by France to intercede between
us and the rebels whom we are going to crush, and in ninety days to
annihilate from off the face of the earth, refuses' And well she may
refuse, the dastardly, bloodthirsty tigress. When the leopards, in
her foul. shield became lions we know not, nor care by what
solemn lie the , fools called, heralds juggled one beast into the
other at the bidding of the knaves called kings, but it was not the
lion but the savage yet crouching tiger that should have been
the type of England. Yes, the Ajº. tigress howls because France
desires to spare us any more bloodshed, she howls her cry that we
be left alone, and that the utmost amount of woe and misery may be
inflicted upon those whom she hates begause they love freedom. Had
she her base will, we should go on fighting iſ doomsday. She will
make any sacrifice rather than help on a pacification, and as Robert
CoBDEN, the member for Birmingham, recently told a vile mob at
Rochford in Essex, the aristocracy are feeding the starving operatives
with venison and turtle rather than their sufferings should bring the
war to an end. We know the tigress, and when the time shall serve,
we may add a few new stripes to those upon her all-fired back. . Mean:
time, we have to put down her emissaries the rebels, whom she pays
with the gold wrung from the wretched Irish and Indians.
But she was right, in another respect, for concluding not to interfere.
We wonder for our part that one of nature's noblemen, like Louis
NApoleon, the descendant of CIIARLEMAGNE, CHARLEs the Twelfth,
and other real kings (whatever their faults may have been), could have
contaminated his hand by offering it to a female of the House of Gulph.
However, he can afford to condescend. But it showed a becoming
humility in the servile.courtiers of Sj. James's, and specially in the
feeble toady and sycophant PALMERSTON, not to pretend to share in the
mission of the Emperor, but humbly to beg him to take his own course.
It was a compliment, indeed, that the greatest sovereign in Europe
should ask a miserable Government like that of England to join with
him and the godlike ruler of Russia in any work, but PALMERston
knew his place better than to accept such a compliment. That buffoon
.." with Louis and ALEXANDER! Fie upon 't, give us a civet
cat, and take away the apothecary, as SHAKESPEARE says. No, we are
glad that PAM had that virtue of humility, though it is only a footman's
virtue at the best.
Well is it for England that she spared us the crowning outrage of
joining in this petition that we should not utterly crush the rebels.
Well for her Indian fleet in the Pool, well for her proud docks at Man-
chester, for her steel manufactories in the Clyde, for the thousand fur:
naces that nightly illuminate Salisbury Plain. We are no boasters, and
perhaps it is the fault of Americans that their exquisite sense of humour
and their quiet gentlemanly habits prevent their giving due utterance
to the praises deserved by themselves, or to the menaces which should
curb the pride of other nations. But for once we will speak out, and
in the name of America say that had the despicable old beast and
tigress, England, dared to thrust her contaminating hand into this fray,
her doom had come sooner than her rotten system will otherwise brin
it. We have a score of armies in the field, and any one of them woul
have marched from Gravesend to Glasgow, or from Land's End to

of the last accidents oc-
curring º this cause,
and the case deserves the
notice of the charitable
public:—
“THE FEMALE BLONDIN.-
On Friday last the heroine of
the Crystal Palace in 1858, and
of the transit of the Thames
on a tight rope 2,000 feet in
'ength in August, 1861, was removed on crutches from St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
a cripple for the rest of her life, from the accidental fracturing of the neck of the
thigh-Bone, more than two months ago, at Highbury Barm, while obeying the
morbid and romantic desire of the present age for perilous adventures. The
fractured limb is three inches shorter than the other, and perfectly useless. The
heroine, with a courage truly characteristic, wished the surgeons to amputate the
limb, if it could not be rendered serviceable, rather, as she observed, than have it
dangling uselessly by the side of the other, and requiring ...}}. which she might
find very difficult to obtain for the maintenance of the sound one. What renders
the case of this unfortunate artist the more distressing is, she was the ouly support
of an aged and infirm father and an invalid sister.—Erpress.”
We trust that this last statement in the paragraph we quote will not
ong escape the eyes of the benevolent. . It is a bad enough misfortune,
we think, to break one's leg, and limp about a º the remainder of
one’s life. But the misery is worse when one's family is injured by it,
and when not oneself alone, but others who are dear to one, are left
without support. How far this thought may influence the persons

your business is. Sir, it is to tell me how much per annum, in these

pay for not getting his boots mudded. - -
“That in common with yourself and all other decent º
I pay a tax-gatherer a vast sum for a Highway and Cleansing Rate,
which seems to be always coming in, and to be charged in some mys-
terious way which, makes seven quarters in every year, I need not say.
If I didn't, I should be sold up.
“London being therefore supposed to be cleaned properly, I have
further to state that my place of business is about two miles from my
gentecl residence, N.W. That in walking from the latter to the
former, as my intelligent medical man (with objectionable allusions to
my pinguitude) desires me to do daily, I have to cross a good man
streets. At every crossing I am assailed, with a demand for a toll.
The demand is urged in every variety of language and tone, from the
respectful ‘Sweeper, Sir,’ to the clamorous and whining ‘O, your
!onour, do spare a apeny for the poor sweep this morning, your honour;
do your honour, nice clean crossing, and I have had nothing to eat for
three weeks.’
“Taking the shortest route, Sir, I go over thirty crossings. If I
pay the toll of a penny at each, this is half-a-crown a day, or fifteen
shillings a week, in addition to the tax which I pay in my own—well,

ousemaid in it, but have to wait, on the threshold till she has taken
her crinoline out of the way, I will use the less pretentious word.
“There are two reasons, Sir, why these thirty demands of toll are
obnoxious to me.
“First, Sir, although I am not going to tell you what I am, I may
be one of several things. I ponder over my daily work as I walk
to it, and the interruptions suddenly thrown in my way are most
outrageous. -
“I may be a Lawyer, and may just have worked, out a lovely proof of
the innocence of somebody whom I know to be guilty. I have just, shall
I say, concocted, a sweet bit for the intelligent jurymen. “And now,
gentlemen, in the interests of society, and in obedience to the purer
and higher instincts of our imperfect nature, let me adjure you to cast
aside all entangling prejudices, and to make a clean sweep of —’

this instant the hideous form of the Dalmatian came in sight. The

like ſingers writhed in fiendish, eagerness for a death-clutch upon, the
maiden's alabaster throat. With a piteous shriek Roncibella, shud-
dering, exclaimed,’
“‘Give the poor sweep a brown this cold morning to get something
to thaw him, your honour.”

some measure relieve her from the misery she must feel. All who went
to look at her encouraged by their presence her dangerous

had stayed away and had not patronised the sight, the poor woman
would have taken to another means of livelihood, and would not have
been tempted to try the ſeats which crippled her. . . -
The taste for seeing fellow creatures put their lives and limbs in
danger we cannot call “romantic,” but view rather as disgusting.
Persons who enjoy the sight of such “adventures” would most likely
love to see the bloodshed of a bull-fight. It is not so much the skill of
the performer that attracts them, as the peril he is pººl. and the
chance of seeing his neck broken. 1f monkeys could be trained to do
the tight-rope and trapeze business, they would soon eclipse the feats of
LEQTARD and BLONDIN. Monkeys are by nature better fit for such
achievements; for they have more muscle than men, and having ſewer
brains, have not such fear of falling. Surely, we repeat, it were a goo
thing for humanity if acrobatic monkeys could be trained up and
exhibited. The lives of human beings then need not be endangered,
and the public might be weaned from its present brutal taste for seeing
men ºf women, imperil, their existence by, attempting ſeats which
monkeys could achieve with perfect safety, and far more ease and skill.

THE QUEEN OF PORTUGAL’S CLOCK.
Among the magnificent presents which the Pope made to the
Princess PIA, his godchild, now the young QUEEN of Portugal, is,
says the report,
“A timepiece of exquisite workmanship, the hours of which are each represented
by a relic.”
Mr. Punch was so fascinated by this conception, that he immediately
wrote off to his friend CARDINAL WisłMAN to know whether the
statement were true. His Eminence has in the most obliging
manner furnished the following diagram, which, though it does not
represent the elegant workmanship of the Relic Clock," shows the far
more precious gems which give it true value in the eyes of the faithful.
Explanations.
Hour Hand.—Tongue Scraper of St. Harris.
Minute Hand.--Toothpick of St. Walkerius.
I. Glass eye of St. Hilarion.
II. Crystallised bandoline of St. Bathilde.
III. Hair from the wig of St. Ildefonse.
IV. Eyelash of St. Pancrace.
W. Piece of trousers of St. Pantalcon.
VI. Little toe-mail of St. Euphrasia.
VII. Gold tooth-stopping of St. Onisephorus.
VIII. Finger-stall of St. ( gº;
IX. Bit of spectacles of St. Fiacre.
X. Little finger-nail of St. Honorine.
XI. Eye-tooth of St. Theodule.
XII. Corn plaster of St. Petronille.
* H. E. apologises (unnecessarily, we think) for the rudeness of the aesign, on the
plea that he is an incxperienced draftsman, and has moreover mislaid his compasses.
MORE SPORTING NEWS.
(From Bell's Life.)
The truly sportsmanlike way in which the Betting world ventured its
money on the Commissioners of the International Exhibition has been
vindicated by the result. It was thought that after the Show had
closed, and what had always been more or less, of a shop had been
formally declared to be nothing else, it would be almost impossible for
the Genius of Blunder (on a visit to England by the kind permission of
Hibernia) to help his pet f. to any new mistake. But sportsmen
were bold, and betted, and fortune favoured them. They wagered that
the Commissioners would once more put their foot in it. They did so.
The shop was opened for a class of customers who can or will only come
forth to buy late in the afternoon, say, from two to five o'clock. So,
the Commissioners seized on the brilliantly novel device of slamming the
door in the faces of such customers at three o'clock! We rejoice that
the courage of the Betting world has thus been rewarded, and that they
have made the pot of money which the Commissioners would not allow
the Exhibitors to make. Audaces fortunajurat.
NOWEL NOMENCLATURE.
THE literary world is at its last gasp for titles to bestow upon the
thousand-and-one works of fact and fiction wherewith it annually
chokes of the reading appetite of the British public. In years pastour
ancestors were content to label their productions with a few simple
words expressive in plain language of their scope or design, but nous
atoms changó tout celd; such primitive notions would be entirely dis-
creditable to the inventive genius of the nineteenth century. Some-
thing “sensational” must be hit off now-a-days, coſite qui coºte;
something that sounds striking—startling; suggestive of cxcitements,
–soul harrowings—unnatural homicides;–or at least hinting at six out
of the scwen deadly sins being to be found within its covers: but before
all things it must be new. These mines of inspiration, however (rather
above delicately sketched out, than described), are becoming decidedly
exhausted. Romantic, spasmodic, alliterative, have all been pretty
nearly worked to death; and the eccentricity of literary patronymics
may be considered to have reached its climax in the recent work of a
popular novelist which its author has actually christened by No Name
at all! After that, well may poets exclaim “What’s in a name?”
These momenclative distresses are principally due to the pedantic idea,
still lingering amongst a few of our writers and publishers, that some
slight link of sympathy must exist—or be presumed to exist–between
the subject of a book and its title. Such antiquated notions, should
hcmceſorth be dismissed as unworthy of an enlightened age; and Punch
suggests whether a new style might not in future be adopted, designa-
tible as the “the ſunny-facetious” style, the component, parts or
epithels of which should be selected rather with regard to their intrinsic
appositeness and appropriateness, and to the general fitness of things,
than to any connection, real or imaginary, with the matter or authorship
of the volume, unless, indeed, in cases where the latter can be made to
subserve to the common symmetry of the structure. Thus works of
general interest, might perhaps be distinguished by a sort of philoso-
phical haziness, or universal unmeaningness in their superscriptions:
novels by smart flashy witticisms, and so forth. In fact, |. art wants a
little new life putting into it, and as it is Punch's mission to enliven
everybody, he throws out a few suggestions, par erample, to be scrambled
for amongst the crowd of literary celebrities who are ever ready to
pounce upon his lightest word.

1T does not appear to have occurred to any of the disputants in the
late controversy about orthography and gambling, that whilst Reindeer
is the name of an animal, Raindeer appears to be that of “a plant.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
–
THE MEMBER FOR SOUTHAMPTON WATER.
ECENTLY the gentle-
men desirous of the
honour or advan.
tage of representing
Southampton, have
been haranguing the
electors of that once
worthily represented
orough in the
Carlton-hall there.
Among others, ac-
cording to the Times’
report:-
“As announced by
posting bills, MR,
GeoRok Thompson and
- M:t. Harpert Twelve-
: Trees addressed the
electors last night in
the above-named hall.
The meeting was largely
attended, but there was
a strong and decided
feeling against either
gentleman. It is under-
stood that they were
brought down by the
supporters of the United
Kingdom Alliance for
the Suppression of the
Liquor ffic with a
view to Mr. Thompson coming out as a candidate in that interest.”
We should think that MR. THOMPson would stand a very good chance
of being returned for Southampton in the interest of the United
Kingdom Alliance for the suppression of the Liquor Traffic. Only, in
order to obtain, the honour of being associated with MR. Digby Sey-
MoUR, it would be advisable for him to advertise copiously the principle
on which he aspires to represent such constituents as those to whom he
has offered his services. He should post up plenty of placards, and
send men about carrying lots of banners, having # upon them
the popular party cries of “No Beer!” “No more Wine !” “Down
with Grog," which last exclamation would be echoed with enthusiasm.
It would be expedient for him to chalk about the walls “Destruction
to the Publicans; ” a body of men exercising small influence in South-
ampton. This kind of inscriptions might be accompanied with “THOMP-
son and Toast-and-Water,” “THQMPson and Tea,” and other similar
combinations. At the dinner on the opening of the Hartley Institution
the other day, MR. GEORGE THOMPsos would have been in his element,
namely, the water of which the assembled, guests partook so freely in
preſerence to the intoxicating fluids of the highest quality which they
were liberally º with, MR, Thompson might count on being
warmly supported by the established parsons, who dislike port, and also
by all of the dissenting clergy, who are at least equally remarkable for
the same aversion.
ORTHOGRAPHY IN THE ARMY.
THE subjoined account, in a letter from the EARL of PortsMoUTH
to Apºſinº. Rous, of the origin of the Reindeer bet, about which, so
much fuss has been made even in society external to that of gambling
circles, is worth preserving. It was obtained by LoRD PoRTsMoUTH,
his Lordship informs the Admiral, from “those who were in the omnibus
going from Mamhead to the race-course: ”—
“Colonel, Burnaby and MR. STEwART started the subject of the difficulties of
spelling, and then ColoneL BURNABY said, he was a very bad speller, and always
took a JoHNson's Dictionary about with him to assist him in writing his letters.
Then they started the spelling of the word Raindeer, M.R. STEwART thinking it was
spelt with an e. Colon EL BURNABY bet that it was with an a, referable to John-
son's Dictionary.”
The book which the gallant officer above-named may be presumed to
be in the habit of composing is one chiefly of an arithmetical nature,
and involving little scope for the exercise of orthography, so that its
perusal would not be very likely to yield very much amusement such as
is occasionally derived from the published correspondence of servant
girls. Any letter, however, which that gallant officer might be obliged
to, write somewhere when he had happened to leave his Johnson
behind him, would be not unlikely to contain numerous words which
might afford the fortunate receiver considerable diversion of that nature.
If the proprietor of Reindeer should ever take partin private theatricals,
as officers occasionally do, the piece selected for him to appear in might
be the Fish, out of Water, in which he would doubtless be very suc.
cessful in playing the Cook, who produces a highly comic situation by
his reference to Johnson's Dictionary. “It isn't the orthography
but it’s that dashed spelling!” is an exclamation which the É.
would doubtless deliver naturally and with feeling.
The circumstance that, in a society of presumably high caste, two
officers of a crack regiment should have “started the subject of the
difficulties of spelling,” may be thought little calculated to confirm the
general idea that there is a great improvement in the education of gen:
tlemen in the Army. The time was thought to have gone by when, if
the naval service had peculiar occasion to complain:
“How hard it is to write,”
the military with equal cause, though for a different reason, might utter
the lamentation:—
“How hard it is to spell.”
But now that “the subject of the difficulties of spelling” is found to
have º ed the conversation of officers and gentlemen, one of whom
acknowledges himself to be obliged to take “a Johnson's Dictionary
about with him to assist him in writing his letters,” it will perhaps be
suspected that Captains, and Colonels, in their knowledge of letters,
and especially of those which are necessary to be employed in forming
words, are nearly where they were in the days of Swift. This would
be too hasty an inference. It is not as officers that certain guardsmen
and their compeers find themselves perplexed with “the difficulties of
spelling.” The same difficulties are likely to be experienced by the
majority of those gentry and those blackguards who devote their lives
to laying wagers. Orthographical difficulties probably beset alike the
officers at the top of the class, betting men, and the cads at the bottom.
Spelling is learned by reading, and only a very moderate proficiency in
it is likely to be attained by any men whose acquaintance with books
is equally confined to those books in which they enter their good things,
which º no jokes, especially to those at whose expense they are
contrived.
PUNCH'S PRISON DISCIPLINE.
CoNFINEMENT and low diet are the punishment of paupers in the
workhouse. The workhouse system is said to work well in the preven-
tion, to some extent, of pauperism. What if paupers and convicts were
made to change places?. It is probable that pauperism would increase
enormously, and that crime would greatly diminish.
The treatment of criminals in gaols appears to be based on the humane
theory that crime is the result of moral disease. . The heads of the
patients, or prisoners, are closely cropped, they are kept upon a whole-
some and nutritious, though not iº. iet, and made to perform
an amount of labour not exceeding the bounds of healthy exercise.
All this would be very well, provided that it answered; that the effect
of prison-discipline was in general the cure of criminals, and the preven-
tion of crime. In that case the benevolent system of treating offenders
might be carried further; the convalescent might be allowed light and
savoury soups, broths, jellies, and made-dishes, with wine and beer in
moderation. They might be encouraged to amuse themselyes with
music and dancing, to get up private theatricals, and practise sundry
other elegant and innocent recreations. The only limit to improvement
in this direction would be that of the expense which it might neces.
sitate.
But the regimen to which convicts are now subjected, unfortunately
does by no means operate in curing thieves of roguery and felony, thereby
deterring their associates from following their example... Is it, then,
advisable to punish them with the same severity as that which paupers
are punished with ? If they are to be reduced to workhouse-diet, their
exercise must be discontinued, lest it should kill them. The cheaper
and more merciful plan would be to hang them at once.
The present keep of convicts is so dear that the Government, for
economy's sake, lets them out of gaol long before their sentences, have
expired. As soon as they have been turned loose with tickets of leave,
they go about the streets knocking passengers down, garotting them,
and rifling their pockets.
How to avoid the expense of keeping a felon comfortably, correct the
offender himself, and constitute him a caution to other villains? That
is the question. There seems at present to be only one, answer to it:
Imprison him on pauper's allowance, and whip him. Tie him up, and
flog him, as you flog a bad soldier. ff it is right, to flog a soldier it
cannot be wrong to flog a ruffian. Does flogging in the Army answer
its purpose ? Is the power of ºf it necessary to be retained at
least in the face of an enemy? If the fear of flogging will control
soldiers, it will restrain civilian scoundrels. The lash is not too bad for
the back of the miscreant who cracks your skull. Robberies accom-
panied with violence, and all brutal assaults, at any rate, might
deservedly be rendered punishable by whipping. That chastisement
the convicted savage might undergo upon a public scaffold, or it might
be inflicted on him in the prison-yard; and tickets of leave for admission
to see it might be distributed by the police amongst the frequenters of
thieves' lodging-houses, and taverns. The spectacle of one sound
flogging administered to a garotte-robber, would prevent many, a
ferocious outrage and cruel murder. Benevolence might accept the
execution as an economy of pain. It would not, probably, have to be
repeated very soon.

LORD MAYOR'S SHOW.
GIWE.
Is Lancashire liberal?. Outrace her,
Giving two crowns to her one.
Is Lancashire stingy? Out-face her,
Giving much to her none.
Be it little or much, let's be striving.
Five money, or blankets, or prayer—
All but reasons for not giving,
Though they be never so fair.
If the North pour her wealth without stint,
The want passes all her powers:
If the North's heart be hard as flint,
More need of softness in ours.
Then be there no cry but one
Heard through this struggle to live,
The cry of the horse-leech alone—
A sore cry of Give! Give! Give
Rich men, give of your millions,
Poor men, let your mites be flung,
Lords and labourers, soldiers, civilians,
Men, women, old and young.
Give for love of your sister and brother,
Give for your neighbour's shamc:
Give in rivalry of each other—

PASSAGLIA AND THE POPE. “Not We,” will doubtless be the papal response. “Non possumus.”
WHEN the Pope was pleased to decree the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception, he employed Father PAssaglia to enunciate that bright
idea as a theological fact. Adding to the articles of the Romish faith.
whilst his hand was in, his fióliness, had he possessed the giſt of
PAssaglia and the Passaglians continue:–
“You alone can be he, most blessed Father, as you alone can efficiently repeat
that voice which you inherited from the Prince of Shepherds, and which, starting
from the Vatican, would fill heaven and earth with exultation. Let, then, this voice
be heard from your lips, O Pius! Let Italy, which looks upon you with filial love,
intuition as well as that of infallibility, would perhaps have made one' and prays to you, hear this word—"Peace!’ Yes, Father, do you announce peace,
more addition to
had to deal as */ as he knew all about the Madonna, it is likely that
PIUs would have coupled his declaration concerning her with one
relative to himself, affirming the necessity of the temporal power. By
that device he would have estopped PAssaglia from doing what he now
does in beseeching the PoEE to renounce his Kingship, and yet, at the
same time, professing unimpeachable orthodoxy. Had the Pope but
had the gumption officially to proclaim his twofold sovereignty indis-
soluble, Father Passaglia would have been forced to hold ſis tongue,
or else he would now be in the position of a heretic, and to the address
which he has lately got up, and offered to his Holiness with the
signatures of 10,000 priests, the Holy Father might have contented
himself with replying Anathema / As it is, he can only return the old,
old answer, which he gives Louis NApoleoN. PAssaglia and his
associates appeal to the successor of St. PETER as follows:–
“Behold, most blessed Father, from one end to the other of this our Italy a
unanimous voice resounds—a voice of religion, of Catholic piety,–“Long live the
Pope 1" but another voice is also heard, a voice of patriotism and of national inde-
pendence—“Long live Rome, the metropolis of the new Kingdom . "
“Non possumus /* That is the sole reply which the Pope can make
to the hint ſoregoing:—“We know what you want Us to do, but—
Non possumus. We can’t do it!”. He may, however, still say so much
as that, and that, probably, is all they will get out of him.
The petitioners go on to say:–
“If these two voices, instead of joining in unison, are łº, and conflicting,
there is no spiritual or temporal evil that we may not fear; there is no national and
religious blessing that we may reasonably hope for. Who, then, shall be the holy
man destined to bring these voices to harmonise, to turn them into a .#
;tº.º:* great a happiness for the nation and for the Papacy, for society an
or
apal Christianity. Knowing the man with whom he and we, in our own name and that of Italy, swear to you immortal gratitude."
“Mon possumus /* There is no hope—or fear—that any other voice
than that will be heard from the lips of the SoverEIGN PONTIFF in
acknowledgment of any such invitation. “Mon possumus /’” he will
tell them, making, perhaps, the sign of the sight, after the pºpular
manner. Or, getting into a rage, he will vehemently repeat—“Non
possumus, non possumus, non possumus.” and, taking off one of his white
satin slippers, shy it at the heads of the deputation kneeling before
him, and tell them to go, with an unapostolical malediction.
It is of course earnestly hoped by all zealous Protestants that the
Roman Pontiff, seeing Whose Vicar he affirms himself to be, will go
on answering Non possumus to every request to resign an extremely
ill-governed kingdom which is of this world. There is considerable
likelihood that the result of perseverance in that course will be the
creation of a Church of Italy distinct from that of Rome. To organise
and govern such an Institution, it may not be difficult for Victor-
EMMANUEL to find a CRANMER, possibly in the person of PAssaglia
himself, who, even in the event of any revival of Popery that could
occur in these days, would be incombustible.
The Wonder of Wonders.
WE rejoice in being able to record the fact of a Scotchman having
made a joke. Some one was advocating the new theory that the best
way to treat certain criminals would be to whip them, when our friend
from the North exclaimed, “Richt, mon, the best dessert would be
Whipped Creaminals.”

low people, who wished to subvert the Altar

Mr. W. But as there is no Throne in the United States—
Mrs. W. Ah! that is just your vulgar habit of word-catching, which,
excuse me, HENRY, is quite apart from the manners of good society. I

Mrs. N. I, HENRY. No. I am not complaining—
Mr. N. That's a comfort.
Mrs. N. But to compare the pleasurable excitement of Mits.
SNOTCHLEY's life with my monotonous existence is perfectly absurd.
Mr. M. Comparisons are odious, my dear, and so is bad femper. But
I merely meant to say that on the present occasion MRs. SNotch LEY’s
leasurable excitement will be derived from reading the letters her
usband may write her from abroad.
Mrs. N. He writes beautiful letters, for he is a man of polished
education, and it is delightful to read them. And it is very considerate
of him not to drag her abroad with him in this uncertain weather.
Mr. M. One man may steal a horse and another is hanged for looking
over a hedge.
Mrs. N. I have heard, that wise men make proverbs, and—those who
are notwise men-quote them. Idomotaffect tounderstand your meaning.
Mr. N. No, there is no affectation about you, everybody knows that.
I mean that SNOTCHLEY is praised for leaving his wife at home, while I
was abused for doing the same thing.
Mrs. M. That is what a man calls an argument! The weather during
your Paris trip was lovely.
Mr. N. It rained four days out of six.
Mrs. N. The Paris letters in the Times did not say so, HENRY, but I
have no wish to convict you of deceit. We have more important
matters to speak of.
Mr. N. More important than my character for honesty and truth,
Madam : What do you mean by that 2
Mrs. N. Do not be so violent. Suppose the children heard you.
Mr. W. How can they hear me, when they are in their breakfast-
room?—you talk nonsense.
Mrs. N. Wives always do, of course; do not the “Flips” hold that
as an article of belieſ? But this wretchedly built house allows everything
to be heard from one room to another, and that brings me again to what
I wanted to say. Have you given notice to the landlord?
R. M. (with the Times). The news from Americals
Mr. W. Notice of what, that we can hear through his walls?
Mrs. N. (firmly). Notice that we leave his house at Lady-day.
Mr. N. Certainly not, because we don't.

Mr. N. That is my name, MARIA. It was given me by my godfathers

I thought you knew better things.
Mrs. N. HENRY, be serious, if possible, not for mysake, I should not
think of mentioning myself, but for that of the children for whom you
profess some ...i. and for whom, whether you care for them or not,
the world expects you to show some consideration. It is unmanly to go

happiness. - -
Mr. W. You have said nothing about their health. As for their happi-
ness, that shout of laughing—there it goes again-does not seem to say
that they are particularly miserable.
Mrs. W. A child will sit up on a sick bed and laugh.
Mr. N. Yes, at a doctor like PETER GRIEvous, and well he mny.

in it to oblige me. - -
Mrs. N. (solemnly). I hope that I know a wife's duty. It is to accept
the lot which her husband may force upon her, and to live, as long as
she is spared, where his caprice dictates. -

Mrs. N. HENRY, it is well that you abstained from adjuration. Let
your own conscience tell you whether it was not you who insisted on
moving here, and whether I did not beseech for a house lower down.
Mr. N. Yes, at two hundred and ten guineas a year. To do you
justice you did, but one of us was not insane.
Mrs. N. I am left utterly in the dark as to my husband's means, and
it is manly in him to reproach me with having believed in his own
accounts of his prosperity.

as I have said, it is my duty to remain with you. Let it be so, and do
not give the notice. But I have also a duty as a mother, and I cannot
see my children falling away under (tremendous shout from the children

A MATTER OF OPINION.
Diana. “YES, DEAR–I MUST SAY THAT I THINK A GIRL Never Looks so well. As She DoEs IN HER RIDING HABIT 1"
THE POSTMASTER'S REMONSTRANCE.
WE have been requested to publish the following correspondence
between the Postmaster-General and the Home Secretary:—
“40, Dorer Street, W.,
"DEAR SIR GEORGE, “Wednesday.
“THAT you should neglect your duty to the public in reference
to this Garotting business, and indeed most other business, may be all
# enough. trust that I could not be sufficiently unmindful of
official etiquette and, the good feeling that should subsist between
fellow-officials to make any impertinent comment on what does not
concern me. Petimusque damusque vicissim, as our friend HoRAcE
ays.
“But, if you please, you must really attend to matters which concern
a collaborateur. .
“The other night one of my Postmen was dodged by some of your
garotters, knocked down, and robbed. Now this sort of thing will not
do, and I must really trouble you to take some precautions in favour of
those who like ourselves are public servants, though, unlike ourselves
!. zealously discharge, for very little money, all the duties they
undertake.
“A Postman's hands are full, and his cape prevents his using his
arms; he is therefore doubly helpless. And he is the bearer of valuable
documents, therefore his safety is a question, of general interest. . We
shall all get into a mess if he is not protected, and again I say that you
really must see to it.
“You have had some good hauls of garotters lately, and they are
under lock, and key. Why don't you have them soundly flogged in
public? The voice of the nation is loud for this kind of thing, and the
experiment, if it did no good, could do no harm.
‘However, I will not take the liberty of dictating details. You must
be good enough to protect my Postmen, or Ishall speak to PALMERSTON.
“Believe me, your affectionate friend,
“Sir Geo. Grey, Bart., M.P., “STANLEY OF ALDERLEY.”
“Home Secretary.”

“DEAR LORD STANLEY of ALDERLEY, “14, Eaton Place, S. W.
“IN answer to your letter, I beg to say that I deeply sym:
pathise with the poor. Postmen whom you underpay so shamefully, and
that I pledge myself immediately on the meeting of Parliament to
introduce a Bill for enabling the Police Magistrate to ſlog the garotters
in public, as everybody seems to think this a case of fiat erperimentan
in corpore vili.
“Meantime, I have ordered SIR. Rign ARD MAYNE to request a
policeman to keep near every Postman while engaged in his laborious
and ill-requited occupation.
“I have the honour to remain,

REAL DISTRESS IN LANCASHIRE.
The subjoined advertisement, from the Manchester Guardian, repre-
sents one of a class of cases the most painful, perhaps, of any that are
connected with the dearth of Cotton :-
RAVEL.-A Gentleman, whose Son, *. 17, is thrown out of occu-
pation by the Cotton famine, would be glad to meet with One or Two other
Young Gentlemen to accompany his Son on a Tour, for five or six months, in the
Mediterranean, or elsewhere.—Address, F. 127, at the printer's.
The poor gentleman whose boy, thrown out of occupation by the
Cotton famine, has no resource but that of a trip up the Mediterranean,
appears to be one of those distressed millionnaires, who, because their
mills have ceased working, declare themselves destitute mill owners,
and devolve on the squires and farmers, and the British Public, the
duty of rescuing their unemployed workpeople from starvation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEWS FROM AND FOR THE UNIVERSE.
WER anxious to procure for
Roman Catholic literature
the widest publicity si-
ble, Mr. Punch, who always
goes in the most direct way
to work, reproduces, in his
world-read page, suchPapist
gems as are not unfitted (by
the nature of the subjects
discussed, or º the manner
of discussing them) for pre-
sentation to the eyes of
decent people. e is
frequently prevented from
such republication, because
Protestant and other civil-
ised readers have an objec-
tion to that olla podrida
of profanity, malice, and
vulgarity, which forms
the staple, of “popular ”
Roman Šišić journalism.
When, however, Mr. Punch
ſºlº F = . upon º
º º cleanly writing on the part
- * ºp Nº - - of the ultramontanes, he
º, IT 2% º takes it out of his Inder
Brpurgatorius, and gladly
lays it before his readers, in
the conviction that the more widely Papal literature is read, the more
the interests of humanity will be served.
The London organ of the ultramontanists (Mr. Punch need not for
the hundredth time assure the educated Catholic that nobody supposes
him to regard such publications with other than Mr. Punch's ownsenti.
ments), is peculiarly rich just now, the writers being excited by the
triumph of Irish patriots over English meetings, and by that of foreign
H. over the EMPEROR or the FRENch. The Universe, No. 102, Vol.
I, now lies (in, every sense of the word) before Mr. Punch, and lest
English readers should imagine that the journal is merely a product of
that gentleman's fertile but conscientious imagination, he begs to add, in
the interest of the world, that the Universe is printed and º by
D. LANE, 43, Lamb's Conduit Street, London, on the left hand side as
you |. QAPTAIN CORAM. It is a folio of eight pages, and is
devoted to the interests of Catholicism.
Mr. Punch has picked up a great deal of valuable information, besides
deriving much harmless amusement from a perusal of the Universe. He
strongly recommends the Catholic organ to Protestant readers, and by
way of tempting them to patronise it, he offers them a few selections
frºm the number before him. The first page is given to a Catholic
calendar, on which Mr. Punch will only .. that one of the days is
set apart as for “Plenary Indulgence and Abstinence,” and he would like
to know how the two things can be accomplished at once, Perhaps the
indulgence is to take place at a jolly good early dinner, and the absti.
nence afterwards, which is very rational, and beneficial as regards
digestion. We then have ". for prayers for the souls of certain
persons, whose advertising friends aré, of course, the best judges of
what the individuals may have deserved, and then we have a compen.
dium of American news, fairly done, and probably cribbed from a Pro-
testant journal. But then we come to the cream.
There is an article upon the close of the International Exhibition.
The writer by no means confines himself to the building, but goes into
politics and other matters. He says, interalia:-
“THE EMPenon, or the French possesses one quality which is not always to be
fºund in a monarch, viz. –he is able to get his own living if he were kicked off the
throne to-morrow, and Tom Norris often told me that if he took to shoemaking, or
tºilºring, he would be as accomplished a knight of the shears, and as useful aſson
of Crispin as ever took a closing awl, or a thimble in his hand. This is what the
world calls cleverness, and few men possess more of it than Louis Napoleon, one
of the wisest things he ever did was to take the stroke-oar in the bark of St. Peter,
and make friends of 250,000,000 of men, the Catholics of the .* His son
will have no one to dispute his inheritance if this policy be continued.”
We are sure that the EMPEROR will forgive the slight familiarity of
this paragraph for the sake of the political advice, and of the informa.
tion that he is now pulling stroke in the “bark” of Saint Peter,
“Wife at the prow, and Pontiff at the helm.”
{}
Øs
Next we come upon a piece of real news:–
“I ..º. you are aware that Rome carried the day in the Great Exhibition.
To Rome belonged the best painting and the finest sculpture there; in those mosaics
which astonished and delighted the visitors from every land, she surpassed all rivals,
and left little to hope to any competitor of ever uiring her excellence in this
department of ‘art.'. Thus you can see that Rome has her glories everywhere—with
.#. shifting of the scene, we behold her as triumphant on the banks of the
Thames, as on those of the Tiber, and may she continue so, and flourish like the
palm in perennial beauty."
That some good things come from Rome there is no doubt. The two
statues in her court, the Cleopatra and the Sibyl, were meritorious, but
we fear that MR. StoREY is a Protestant, and there was another Italian
statue which we are almost afraid to mention, for the crowds who used
to stand round it were actually doing silent homage to the daughter of
–of–there is a policeman in our hall—of GARIBALDI, The Universe
critic does not mention this little fact, practising, of course, mental
reservation. - - -
Later, we come to a leading article, in the boldest letters, on the
Birkenhead, riots. These, we deluded Protestants had #. Were
caused by the ruſſianly incursion of a large gang of brutual Irishry upon
a peaceful discussion in a hall taken by Englishmen for the expression
of their sentiments. It seems that we were wrong.
“The details of the unprovoked outrages lately offered to that portion of the
population of Birkenhead (who, because they are Irish, are aliens in this country)
reflect equal discredit on the authorities whose duty it was to protect and not mal-
treat them, and on the Orangeman, whose brutality on this occasion is to be paral-
leled only by former excesses. Every precept of religion and every sentiment of
humanity is banished from his bosom to make way for this horrid hatred and burn-
ing vengeance which rages uncontrolled from infancy to manhood, and, like the
thirst of the panther, can be slaked with nothing less than blood.”
This is the Catholic way of describing a quiet,inoffensive meeting of
people who admire GARIBALDI, and wish Rome left to choose her own
ruler. And this is the way the Englishman treats the priest who happens
to come in his way:-
“The minister of religion, with bowed head, and voice modulated to meekness,
in the imitation of his Divine Master, crosses the path of these murderous wretches
whilst engaged on their mission of violence and destruction, and he is respected no
more than a rabid animal—the wretch even goes so far as to raise his baton to beat
out the brains of the man of God, and scatter them on the pavement beneath his
feet."
We had not heard, that any thing of the kind was done, that any
|priest's brains were otherwise troubled at Birkenhead than by whiskey,
or that the more difficult operation of discovering the brains of any of
his dupes was performed, but the Universe knows best... But the climax
represents in the most awful manner the conduct of the police in
removing to prison the Irishmen who were smashing church windows
and beating Protestants—
“But hold I Shall we talk of the constitution to the injured Irishman, whom the
authorities (the police we mean) treated with brutality in his cell, and took advan-
tage of the gyves that held his hands to subject him to the bruises of the bastinado
What to the Irishman is that constitution, under which he inherits the curse of
Swirt, together with that appanage of prejudice and intolerance of himself; his
creed, and his country –the kicks and cuffs of the Orangeman—the blinding blows
of the bigot—the stripes of the authorities—and the grinding hoof of power, which
crushes him to the earth and lays him in the dust.”
That last outrage, that completion of the crime is fearful indeed, and
is only paralleled by the case of the Irish gentleman, who was stated
by the #. papers of other days to have “dropped down dead, and
instantly expired.” The imaginary spectacle is too dreadful to dwell
upon, and therefore majora canamus. Let us leave this world for
another. - -
Mr. Punch, is not joking....He never jokes upon sacred subjects. It
is not his fault if the profanities of the Faithful read like jokes. He
proceeds, scarcely expecting to be believed—but he has given the
address of the journal—to record that the conductors of the Universe
have a correspondent in Heaven, Yes, a correspondent who dates from
the place of rest. He states himself to be out of the body, and—nay,
he shall speak for himself:—
“Now to the fulfilment of my office, and I pass on to relate to you the judgments
which are here given of the immortal Pius the NiNth. I am commanded to write
to you, in the first place, what the angels think of him, then what the saints believe
abºut him, and, finally, what the devils say concerning him; and I will endeavour
to compress into one single letter these three parts, asking you pardon if I should
be a little too long.”
He is indeed too long, for his blasphemies º nearly two columns,
but it is not for that, as it seems to us that he should ask pardon.

Faithful:— -
“But now I can tell you that Pius THE NINTH can well repeat that he has
become a spectacle to the angels. These Bow THEMselves Down REveRENTLY
-
when Evert they heart his venerable NAME Phonounced."
There! The angels in Heaven bow themselves down whenever they
hear the name of }. THE NINTH, congratulator of the Perugia mur-
derers. We scarcely like to quote more, yet here is another scrap of
what is printed and published in London in 1862:—
“I know also that there reigns in Heaven a noble emulation among the angels to
protect this great Pope. The angel of most holy MARY wishes always to be at his
side, because he ºimºi “Immaculate Virgin' her whom he announced so
many centuries mother, &c. &c. The angel of St. Joseph, who admonished him in
his sleep of the persecutions of Herod, watches most attentively to admonish Prus

stands ready to guide him in the journeys, which he might consider prudent to
undertake; and £. famousangel of Israel, who scourged so mightily the tians,
is preparing the scourges for the defence of the Pope; and St. Michael says that the
surrender of Ancona took place on the day of his feast, and that sooner or later he
wishes to take his revenge."
This is the sort of thing which is published for the use and edification
of Papists. Mr. Punch feels strong objections to reprinting it, for the

BRIGANDAGE IN THE INTERESTS OF FRANCE,
M. DROUYN DELHUys will have been much gratified in reading his
Times, to meet with the following statement in it, written from Turin,
of a grand immolation which some brigands have lately celebrated in
the interests of France:—
“A very painful sensation has been caused throughout the country by the tidings
of a massacre of a detachment of forty infantry men of the Royal army by a band of
two hundred brigands near St. Severo, in the province of Capitanata. The unlucky
soldiers had been led into an ambush by a spy, who informed them that ten brigands
were lurking in a wood called Il Bosco della Grotta, between Santa Croce di Mag-
liano and Maglianico. Surrounded by a force five times their own number, in the
thick of the forest, the brave men endeavoured to cut their way through the midst
of them. Twenty-one of them were shot or cut down on the spot, thirteen were
taken prisoners and burnt alive at no great distance in a straw loft."
Thus it will be apparent to the Imperial Minister for Foreign Affairs,
that the Power which the French troops are maintaining, and intended to
maintain for ever, at Rome, in the interests of France, does not want
avengers and executioners to put the excommunicated heretics, who con-
stitute the Royal Army of Italy, to death in the good old way. The
religious brigands who ravage Southern Italy in the interests of France
and of FRANCIs late of Naples, the guest of the Pope, know how to H
Fº the enemies of the Holy See. M. Drouys of ingys cannot
ut rejoice in the reflection that the policy of which he is the instrument,
and which prevents the suppression of the faithful bandits, has permitted
the exemplary death, in lingering agony, of thirteen soldiers in the service
of Victor-EMyANUEL. The act of faith by which they perished in the
flames comprehended, it seems, an arch-heretic; for thus proceeds the
narrative, with reference to those thirteen victims, roasted alive in
the interests of France:—
“Among the latter was the officer in command of the detachment, CAPTAIN
Rota, a Garibaldian, who was one of the famous Thousand of Marsala.”
A live. Garibaldian leader burning—what a fragrant holocaust for
the Holiness whose dominion is upheld by the agency of M. DROUYN
DE LHUYs in the interests of France! Thirteen sacrilegious champions
of Italian unity all suffering cremation at once in the interests of France
and of the Pope—what a sweet savour from such a sacrifice must also
have affected those nostrils, in the breath of which M. DROUYN DE
Lhuys lives! Something like it is smelt when a fiery death occurs in
consequence of enormous skirts catching ſire. Really it might almost be
called Bouquet de Crinoline. And, from the despatch of M. DROUYN DE
Lhuys in answer to GENERAL DURANDo's circular, that ultramontane
perfume appears destined to mingle for an indefinite period with the scent
of Fleurs d'Italie.
RATHER A. TALL PARTY.
IN the Chemist and Druggist, Mr. Punch, who sees everything, sees
this advertisement on the part of a Chemist's Assistant:-
YOUNG MAN, aged 22, height 25 feet 10 inches, accustomed to
Dispensing and Family Trade. References unexceptionable. Address, stating
full particulars, to R. S. T., High Street, L–.
Now we know that some of the chemists of these days go great
lengths, but we own that we were unprepared to hear of a chemical
gentleman twenty-five feet ten inches high. That his address should be
igh Street, is natural, but it is odd that the place he dates from,
whereof the initial is “L.” is not Long Houghton, or Long Preston, or
Long Stanton, or something equally appropriate. We hope he has got
a good engagement, and have no doubt of his being much looked up to
wherever he may settle. Should he deliver his own medicines he will
have great advantages, in being able to put the Mixture as Before in at
the attic window without troubling the servants, and this will help to
make him popular. The awful thing will be to see him called out of
church in a hurry, and we trust he will be careful not to rise suddenly,
or he may carry away with him the tiles of the sacred edifice in addition
to his own. We should like to see his diploma, for it is clear he never
rose by degrees. Perhaps he will look down on us the first time he
strides up to town. If disengaged he should try Wapping, as he would
certainly make a wapping chemist.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
EAR PUNCH,-Pray what cele-

cigar, because, I think you
said, ‘the more he is puffed
the worse he draws?' Well,
there’s no such thing known
now-a-days as puffing a bad
actor: a glance at any
that fact. But I wish that
our good actors (and their
name is not quite Legion)
would not shrink from being
praised when really they
deserve to be. Here is MR.

tiring, from Sadler's Wells

What posters and adver-
tisements and laudatory
paragraphs would have pre:
j #. universe to bid
farewell to the great man'
But MR. Phelps slips out of º with neither flummery nor fuss, and so modestly takes
leave of us that we have scarce the opportunity to say, how much we liked him. -
“From the few words which he said about himself the other night when he retired, we
learned that in his managership, thirty-four of SHAKSPEARE's plays had been produced at
Sadler's Wells, and had been performed there pretty near four thousand nights., Pray, is not
this alone sufficient ground ſor our esteem, and ought we not to thank him for the service he
has done us?, Do you suppose that, SHAKsPEARE could publicly be played for some four
thousand nights without some sensible advantage accruing to the public.? ...When MR.
PHELPs took Sadler's Wells, he found the audience as coarse in their dramatic likings as in
their relish for the foul fied fish wherewith they were refreshed. The most murderous of
melodramas formed their chief delight, with lots of broadsword combats and broad dialogue
to match. Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard were the heroes they applauded, and were some-
times led to copy, as the prison-sheets could prove. I recollect myself, seeing Rookwood at
this house, and the gallantry of Turpin so impressed my youthful mind that I felt immensely
sorry when he came to grief. I had enjoyed †: education and the best of moral training,
}. to bring poor Dick to justice seemed a foul thing in my eyes. And what must the effect
ave been on minds around me, educated in the gutter and blest with no good moral healthy
influence at home, to counteract the º they were drinking from the stage?
“Well,...MR.P.HELPs has changed all this. With the goodly aid of SHAKSPEARE he has
purified The Wells, and cleansed the taste of those who wallowed in the filth. With
straitened stage resources and small scope for scene “effects,” he has produced the best of
plays in a most creditable manner, and with far more taste and poetry than we have seen
displayed at many a more pretentious house. Most zealous and painstaking in the drill of
his subordinates, he has filled the lesser parts with evenly fair actors, and has not tampered
with the text to make ‘fat’ for himself. Moreover—and the fact should surely cause the
British º to reverence his memory—MR. PHELPs in his long management has, but
produced one single piece “translated from the French.' . No “interesting incest’ has been
witnessed on his stage, nor smack of foreign monkey-morals been permitted to intrude. In
short, whether as actor or as manager, he has fairly earned high praise: , and I really can't
help wishing he would give us one more chance of publicly applauding him. As a rule, I
hate ‘ovations,’ as the penny-a-liners call them: but a man like MR. PHELPs it is not easy to
replace, and he has done the state, of the drama such ſº service that his merits should, I
think, he acknowledged more substantially than by the recent leave-taking which almost
passed unnoticed. One bumper more at parting he really ought to have: , and however big
the house may be, I'll bet it will be filled, whichever of his characters he choose to make his
last appearance in, whether it be Macbeth, Macduff, or better still, Macsycophant. . -
.“Well, the Brompton shop is shut, thank mercy! and the theatres are once again becoming
visitable to us Londoners, of course any old stock pieces sufficed to please the country folk,
and we townspeople thereby have been dramatically houseless, for of all our score of theatres
scarce one had any novely. Italian opera in November were rather a new thing, and I really
almost feared that TITIENs and GiugiiNI would be fº by the fog and frost, and robbed
of their best notes. But I heard them on the last of their last final farewell nights, and both
Lucia and Edgardo sang without betraying the least symptom of sore throat. Our English
prime donne of course are more acclimatised to our Novembrian air: and I rejoice to find the
early frosts we have been pinched by have in no way injured the sweetness of our PYNE.
Critics talk about her ‘register’ as though she were a stove, and tell me that her ‘compass’
is not quite what it used to be. But I am happily not one of those who can’t enjoy a puppet-
show, because they will look at the wires: and when a voice is so delicious as Miss Louis A
PyNE's, I never strain my ears to listen for defects. To hear her warble her duet with
MR, PRATTEN's flute is alone worth turning out for, even on the darkest night and from the
cosiest of chimney corners: and the way in which she sings the pretty ballads she is given,
must make the MissEs BRowN and Jones all sigh with envy and despair. What would those
young ladies give for her clear shake? and when they buy the ballads, as they are sure to do, how
brated actor was it that |T
paper will convince you of |h
their heart would be rejoiced if they could buy the
skill to sing them as sweetly as Miss PYNE does!
“The new opera, Love's Triumph, is really well
worth hearing, not alone because she sings in it.
he music is throughout light, pretty, bright and
sparkling, and upon the whole it is extremely
well performed. I think myself that spoken
dialogue is somewhat a iº. especially for a
large theatre where half the words are lost. But
then, somehow, English singers never will sing
recitative, at least as they should sing it, and con-
versations that contain such words as “pocket-
andkerchief” perhaps are hardly capable of
being set to music without making people laugh.
MR. PERREN’s voice is weak, but he sings with
much good taste, and many a better tenor would
like to, own, his shake. MR. ON acts
well (which is more than MR. PERREN does, “or
any, other man, upon our operatic stage), and
in the concerted pieces his voice proves of good
use. The chorus would do better if it had more
bass; and this phrase might be stereotyped, and
used for every band of choristers that one has
ever heard, except, º: Cologne and MR.
Leslie's choir. MR. MELLON, why not make
yours an exception to the rule *

THE WIRTUE OF INTOXICATION.
Is drunkenness a virtue P Are ruffians who
get drunk and then commit most brutal outrages,
entitled to plead drunkenness in palliation of their
crimes, as they might put in a certificate of pre-
vious good character? 8. of our Magistrates
appear just now to think so, and among them, we
are quite º: to see, is MR. TYRwHITT. In
sentencing a brute the other day for an assault,
this usually good judge forgot himself so far as to
say the nonsense following:—
“He should send the prisoner to hard labour for six
weeks, and, had it not been that the prisoner was drunk,
he should have sent him for a longer period."
In future, when a drunken brute is, taken up
for an assault, it would be as well to charge him
not merely with the outrage but with the being
drunk. There is by law at present a penalty for
drunkenness; and a fine of five shillings, with the
option of imprisonment, may be imposed on any
one found tipsy in the streets. Had the prisoner
in this case been charged with j drunk,
MR. Tyrwhitt would have been obliged to take
judicial notice of that which, sofar from excusing
aggravated the assault.,,. Thus, being calle
upon to punish it, he could not have viewed the
runkenness as a palliation: and while he pro:
ceeded to committal of the prisoner, he would
have spared his friends the pain of seeing
commit himself.

“Yes, there are two of 'em, if not three, by the Footsteps, and one of 'em is Blowing into the Keyhole now.”
THE KING AND CONSTITUTION OF PRUSSIA.
THE KING OF PRUssia's boots, beneath whose soles the Prussian
charter has just been trodden in the mire, have, in recognition and
honour of that glorious fact, lately received a loyal cleaning from the
tongues of some of his Majesty's most humble subjects in divers dis-
tricts of Prussian Saxony. #. following is part of KING WILLIAM's
acknowledgment of that gratifying act of adulation:—
“I have sworn to uphold the constitution received from my brother, his late
Majesty, and I shall conscientiously keep my oath in the sense expressed in my
programme of November, 1858. . But it is also requisite to govern constitutionally
so as to promote the welfare of the country. The sovereign alone can do this in
Prussia. ... The representatives of the people should assist him by constitutional
co-operation in legislation, and not Hill. obstruct his government.”
The Sovereign alone can govern constitutionally so as to promote the
welfare of the country in Prussia—can he f_If he can, the Prussians
are lucky-luckier than the Chinese. The EMPEROR of ChiNA may be
said alone to govern constitutionally in that country, but can perhaps
hardly be truly affirmed so to govern as to promote the welfare of his
subjects. . Besides the Chinese Autocrat, there is hardly any other
monarch in the world, just now, who governs exactly like the KING of
PRussia. The CzAR is effecting the liberation of the Russian serfs,
whereas his Prussian Majesty is engaged in a political proceeding of
§. an opposite character. To find a ruler with whom we can match
ILLIAM of PRussia, we must go back to the Great Mogul, or to
HaRoun-AL-Raschid, the Commander of the Faithful. The represen.
tatives of that potentate's people, namely his courtiers, confined their
patriotism to assisting him by constitutional co-operation in legislation;
that is, by º to his decrees.
Qnly the Caliphate of Bagdad could boast, with truth, of the merit
which is claimed for the present Prussian Monarchy." The Caliph
alone did really govern constitutionally so as to promote the welfare of
the country. #. there is no denying that the CALIPH of BAG-
PAD's representative at Berlin is a thoroughly constitutional king, by
his own account of himself. He is, according to that statement, the
most constitutional king in Europe or the .# ; ay, every inch a con-

GAROTTING AND THE GALLOWS-CURE.
If Mr. Punch disapproves of the gallows, it is not because he does
not see how strong are the arguments, on behalf of that old English
Institution. The strongest of these is the manifest truth that the
cheapest thing you can do with a worthless rascal is to hang him. By
hanging him you rid society of a nuisance altogether. Not only will he
never commit another crime, but he will never cost another sixpence.
Then there is no doubt that capital punishment will suppress crime,
as persecution will put down heresy, on the same terms. You must
hang as you would burn if you were a Spanish Inquisitor. It is neither
enough to roast a LATIMER and a RIDLEY or so alive, nor to hang two
or three GREENACREs, RUSHEs, or PALMERs. Week after week, year
after year, reign after reign, you must go on consigning every heretic
§ stake, and likewise persevere in sending every criminal to the
gl :—
A little scragging is a useless thing;
Hang oſt, or use not the cannabian string.
Hang without mercy, hang like fun, and you will check Garotters as
effectually as Sepoys.
The practice of hanging as at present pursued betrays a grievous con-
tempt of logical dependence. You hang a ruffian for a murderous
assault not unless it happens to cause death; and then you hang him
not for a crime but an accident! What is the justice that hangs on
such a principle as this, much more discerning than the justice of rogues
and thieves?, Suppose you can prevent one ruffian from knocking my
teeth out by hanging another who has broken the jaw of somebody else,
ought you not to hang that ruffian? Certainly you ought, unless you
can as effectually preserve my grinders and incisors by some other
means.
...Are there any other? That is just the question on which the neces-
sity or needlessness of hanging depends. Doubtless there are other
means more terrible than hanging. "You might break Garotters on the
wheel. You may, without killing them, punish them more severely
than you could by hanging them. Truly penal servitude would be a
punishment worse than death. Where is the murderer who was hanged
the other day? Nowhere, thinks the unbelieving ticket-of-leave man.
The religious malefactor thinks that perhaps he may be in Heaven.
They both know that a prisoner in penal servitude is not, in a very
happy state, however....Only, to be thoroughly effectual, penal servitude
must be exemplary. The hardships inflicted on the convict should be
very great, and his existence, ought to be made, extremely miserable;
moreover, his misery should be notorious. This latter object might be
effected by means of suitable lectures illustrated by dissolving views of
scenes of prison-life rendered as unpleasant as need be, and prison dis-
cipline sufficiently'stern. Many philanthropists, friends of the morally
lower orders, would no doubt take a benevolent pleasure in delivering
courses of such lectures in the slums, -
At any rate, for the prevention of garotte robberies and all other
crimes, one step might be taken somewhat analogous to the treatment
proverbially recommended for that other complaint, the Influenza,
which is just now likewise so prevalent. “Stuff a cold,” says the
popular adage, “and starve a cough.” At present the moral reverse
of this rule is observed in penal economy. You stuff a convict and
starve a pauper. Wouldn't it probably answer better to allow paupers
sufficient food and put criminals on low diet? Thus you may be enabled
to get on without the gallows.
“Grosser and Grosser Still.”

THE SQUIRE AND THE COCKNEY.
HE Bridgend Chronicle re-
ports a speech made at the
late annual meeting of the
Bridgend Labourers' Friend
Society by C. R. M. TALBOT,
Esq., M.P., in which that
honourable and cereal gentle-
man informed his audience
that one antagonist of socie-
ties such as theirs was “their
facetious friend, Mr. Punch.”
If MR. TALBoT really believed
Punch to be an antagonist of
agricultural societies, it was
very gentlemanlike and civil
of him to speak of Mr. Punch
as “their facetious friend.”
Suppose that belief on his
art were warranted by facts,
º would have been quite jus-
tified in mentioning him as
that fool, Punch. But to
point out the absurdity of
pretending to reward the in-
dustrious heroism of a long
life by presenting a meri-
A torious old carter with a pair
of corduroy breeches, is not
to gainsay or disparage the
wiser and more generous op-
erations of associated farmers.
Mr. Punch is as much the
antagonist of any Labourers'
Friend Society as he is of the
- Society for the Prevention of
- Cruelty to Animals. MR.TAL-
Bot is further reported as
having done Mr. Panch the
honour to make the following
observation about him :-
“He did not mean to say with regard to the remarks of Mr. Punch on agricultural associations
that they were deserving of very great notice, because they all knew Punch was a Cockney, and
therefore, what could he know about agriculture?"
Time was when a Cockney was defined to be a person who was born within the
sound of. Bow-bells. That definition will now no more hold water than a .
sandy soil with a substratum of limestone. Railways have made citizens of London
citizens of the world. ALDERMAN MEchI is not a Cockney, and if he lives, please
the pigs, a Farmer will one day be the Lord Mayor of London. -
No, MR. TALBot; it is not because people are Cockneys that they know nothing
about agriculture. Their ignorance of agriculture is what constitutes them Cockneys.
When you represented Punch as knowing nothing about agriculture because of
being a Cockney, whether you were right or wrong in your estimate of Mr. Punch's
agricultural knowledge, anyhow you put the cart, before the horse. Do you call
that the act of a countryman, Sir? Punch may or may not be a Cockney;
but if he is one, you are another.
A GROWL AT THE UNDERGROUND.
MR. PUNCH presents his respectful compliments to the Directors of the Under-
ground Railway, or Metropolitan Railway, or Sewer Railway, or whatever they call
the thing that has been making such a horrible mess in the New Road for the
last few . and strongly advises them either to open that line to the public, or
to give the public, through some official or other, a decent reason why they keep on
postponing the opening... If neither be done, the affair will get into as bad odour
as its intrusive, friend, Fleet Ditch. He informs, them, in confidence, that along
the district under, which this railway, is supposed to go, the ſollowing are among
the reasons generally assigned for the delay:- *
It is said that the entire tunnel has fallen in; that Fleet Ditch, aforesaid
has again poured in, and now permeates through the whole length; that two of
the fattest Directors, trying to pass in the tunnel, have stuck, and are being reduced
by starvation in order to their being got out; that the place is full of Garotters,
who have established a robbers' cave, and, will, have to be drowned out; that
indignant neighbours, enraged at their cellars being invaded, have bored holes
through which they mean to shoot at the trains; that Mr. Tiwaries has
bought the thing, and annexed it to the main drainage scheme; that the Pneumatic
Company have taken it for experiments in transmitting parcels by air-pump; that
the hideous erection opposite Trinity Church is so like the International ºil.
building that the Commissioners have fallen, in love with...it, and want it for the
Exhibition of 1872; that the rats have rushed in by millions and eaten all the
clerks, porters, and ticket-takers; that the General Omnibus Company, fearful
of injury to their monopoly, have bribed the Great Western people to block the
*w line up; that DR. CUMMING has found out prophetically that the opening of
the line will bring on the end of the world; and that
somebody or other is blundering, or squabbling, or jobbing,
or going to law, and there’s no knowing when the thing
will be opened.
Now all these reasons may be right, or º: them
may, but it would be a great comfort tº the Road
to know the truth, and specially to the fasty gentle-
men who, propose to use the subterranean and
who already playfully speak of their intention to take daily
three pen’north of sewer. Mr. Panch vites
the Directors to open either the railway or their º
A NICE STATE OF THINGS 1
OR THE STREETS IN 1802.
Oh, I’m an Anti-Garotter so bold,
if shiver and shake, 'tis but with cold,
I don't know such a feeling as fear,
But I warn Garotters not to come near!
I carry sword-blades in all my sticks;
I wear round my neck a steel collar with pricks;
Revolvers in both coat-pockets I bear,
And a bowie-knife that will split a hair.
I won't trust to laws or police, not I,
For their protection is all my eye;
In my own hands I take the law, .
And use my own fists to guard my jaw.
Is that a footstep behind my back?
It must be one of the strangling pack;
Is that a lurking villain I view,
Crouched in the doorway of number two
Here’s somebody coming! He’d best beware,
I’ll give him a warm reception I swear.
Where’s my revolver?, Good gracious ! I see
He’s bringing his pistol to bear on me !
Hold hard, put up your weapon, Sir, do–
I am an Anti-Garotter too!
We carry both sword-sticks and bowie-knives,
And we both of us go in fear of our lives!
A nice state of things, Sir, this I call;
Turning out like a walking arsenal,
With pistol and dagger and cºllar of steel-
It has a most un-English feel!
To SIR Joshua JEBB I wish no wrong,
But I must say he comes it rather strong, -
When he tries to prove that the rogues and thieves,
Ain't a bit the worse for their ticket-of-leaves.
He may talk until he's black in the face,
The Garotters are there to upset his case,
And British householders forced to go
Armed, like Hamlet's ghost, from top to toe!
While such is the state of British law,
Let the British Lion hold his jaw,
On the safety to property life and limb
Enjoyed by those who live under him .
Here’s Paterfamilias, poor old boy,
In self-defence must weapons employ,
More like, by the way in which he potters,
To damage himself than the Garotters.
An Englishman's house used his castle to be;
Now that castle in state of siege we see.
There are burglars in the back-yard at work,
And on the front-door step Garotters lurk.
And Paterfamilias walks the streets
In dread of every soul that he meets;
In dread of each foot-fall he may hear,
Lest it herald a rush in on his rear-
A pair of hands flung round his throat,
A dig in his wind and a tug at his coat,
With, ten to one, a fractured jaw
From a Knuckle-duster or Indian Claw.
We’re highly civilised people I know;
And the nineteenth century's trumpet we blow;
But while the Garotter performs his feats,
Let us silence our brag till we’ve purged our streets.

not be the reason of the love
which fast young men now have

If the mania for seeing these Sensation feats continue, there really
is no telling to what dangers it may lead, and what a faste for savage

and the tight-rope will be voted stale and, slow, and tiger-fights and
gladiators will ". in request. In feats like those performed by our
trapèzists and rope-walkers it is not so much the wonder as the danger
that attracts; and the morbid taste for seeing human life in peril is one
of the most debasing of all depraved tastes. ... It blunts the sense of
sympathy and deadens sensibility, and gradually paralyses all the finer
feelings which it is the aim of education to evoke.
The craving for Sensation is a most unhealthy appetite, and public
injury is done by all who pander to it. , Might not acrobats be charged
with attempting to commit suicide, and, in the case of their suspension
over other people's heads, might not an attempt at manslaughter be
added to ihe charge? Perhaps SIR GEORGE GREY at his leisure,
having stamped out the Garotters, will consider this moot point. Bru.
talising pastimes demoralise a nation, and ought on public grounds to
be discountenanced and stopped.
MY STARS AND GARTER 1
MR. REUTER’s latest telegram from America informs us:-
“The journals represent Richmond to be in a very lawless condition, no persons
venturing out after nightfall.”
Our American cousins would seem to be no better off than we are. It
appears to be equally dangerous to move out “after nightfall” in the
New World as in the Qld. In that respect we are, as much prisoners
in London as they are in Richmond. e dare not leave our houses for

the other. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves for attempting to kill
one another with the same zest as Americans ! Why don't the Garotters
unite themselves into a corps, and emigrate to America? They would
be a formidable body there, and the greater the number of lives they
took the more highly would their services be appreciated, whereas it is
just the reverse here. . We can assure both North and South, that they
are heartily welcome to such arms as these nocturnal marauders em-
that we have received for a long time from the other side of the water.
if they will but relieve us of their disagreeable presence. We shall
not mourn much over the loss, or expatriation, of gentlemen, whose
hands are always P. raised against every man’s throat. In
England, they are useless, and only in the way; in America, so long as
the war lasts, they might be turned to valuable account.
The atrocities of the one are not less dreaded than those of Jud

AN 'OWL FROM THE ORGAN-HUNTED.
“The Prefect of Police at Paris has issued an order to all locksmiths, copper-
smiths, tinplate workers, and all operatives using heavy hammers, and to aii persons
following trades or occupations which require the employment of machines capable
of disturbing the repose of the neighbouring inhabitants. . . The decree further
forbids any person to play a noisy instrument during the same hours.”
HAPPY land, º land, whate'er the Emperor be,
Still my head, with organs racked, will in envy turn to thee,
Where, the copper-smiths are silenced, and the tinplate-workers
ump, - -
From sunset till the milk and the morning sparrows come.
I think upon the orders of the Prefect of Police,
That bids the tired Parisian rest in stillness and in peace,
In my frequented thoroughfare 's distraction, din, and woe,
From the moment that I ope my eyes to cries of “milk below”
Through the misery of my mornings from the clamour that ne'er
ceases,
Of “Hearthstones,” “Fine fresh Mackarel,” “Old Clo’,” and
The 44 Wºº. dersh d
agony of afternoons by or inders haunted,
And German-bands, and ; nigger minstrels chaunted.
And thus I sit, and curse my fate, and tear my hair and sigh,
For the Paternal despotism that rules in lands hard-by,
And could almost greet Imperialism, that brought me a police,
With power to silence organs and bid bag-pipes go in peace.
JUDICIAL COMEDY.
AMongst the comic institutions of London, there is an entertain.
ment which consists of the mimic proceedings of a British Court
of Justice. A * improvement on this diverting representation
would effected by substituting, for the similitude of a British
tribunal, that of a French Assize Court. The late trial of the Dug DE
GRAMMONT-CAD shoussº, and the other º: concerned in the fatal
duel between that titled turfite_and the sporting editor, DILLON,
accurately, reproduced, would afford an English auditory immense
amusement and perhaps some instruction, for it might teach them duly
to value the usages of their country. No burlesque or parody of it
would be at all necessary; the simple repetition of the dialogue between
the President and the accused would be quite sufficient for the purpose
of raising laughter, For instance, take the subjoined questions and
answers, translated by the Times from the Constitutionnel. The
ºntº are the principal prisoner at the bar, and the presiding
udge:—
“Q. But you admit your letter was too violent. Would it not have been advisable
to publish the modified letter?
“A. I was placed under the necessity of giving it as it was written. It was said
that I refused to give satisfaction to MR. DiLLoN, because he was not of my position.
All men of honour have a right to ask for reparation, and I never conceived the idea
of shielding myself behind my name and position.
“Q. We admire this language, and accept it; it is that of an honourable man." '
This outburst of sentiment on the President’s part is surely much
funnier than the solemn rebuke which the LoRD CHIEF BARON would
administer to a witness or a P. for asserting, in terms such as
those above quoted, the duty of duelling.
Again, what absurdity that ever occurs even in a trial at any county
Assizes, can equal that of the following quip and repartee?—
“Q. However, it may be, you have handled a sword before, and your opponent
was a man who had never held a sword in his hand.
“A. Mr. President, do you think it would have been more just to place me
opposite to a man who was notoriously known as a crack-shot with the pistol 2"
“I think I had him there,” aside to the jury, for the foregoing
lively conversation was carried on before a body of that name, is the
only conceivable addition by which the prisoner under examination
could have heightened the effect of his retort upon the examining
udge. - -
The preceding specimens of the last French, cause célèbre will
suffice to demonstrate the expediency of occasionally varying the
buffooneries of the Judge and Jury Club with a faithful enactment of
that scene of mutual raillery, altercation, and recrimination between
the President and the culprit, which, diversified with the enunciation
of moral sentiments by the one and the other, and everybody else
concerned, is exhibited in the administration of justice as practised in
rance.
Of course, the conclusion of M. DE CADERousse's trial was as absurd
as any that could have been come to at the mock Assizes in the Dust-Bin,
or wherever they are held. The accused were all acquitted. That
result might be expected as the verdict of jurors who would probably
find murder complicated with adultery to be homicide under extenuating
circumstances.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PENNY-A-LINER AT HOME.
An Imaginary Narrative Suggested by the reports of Recent Tremendous
Conflagrations (large fires).
THE Penny-a-Liner had finished his labours for the night, and having
provided sensation for the breakfast table of the public, calmly sat down
to his own supper. - -
“I am anxious to express to the intelligent and affectionate partner
of my existence,” he remarked, “my conviction that the ordinary period
of refreshment has been somewhat objectionably pºstponed.”
“No such thing, JIM,” †. his pretty wife, “and don't hurry me,
there’s a good boy, or I shall spoil the rabbit.” -
“Does your observation imply, my dear, that the banquet in course
of preparation consists of the rabbit from the Cambrian,Principality, or
the four-footed quadruped from a seaport not a hundred miles from
Ostend ?”
“Welsh, JIM, dear.” - - -
“So far from giving utterance to any feelings of disappointment at
the substitution of the less nutritious but more gustatory edible, my
dear JANE, I am gratified that upon the present occasion you should
have selected the former, and I wº only remark that the least amount
of procrastination the more satisfactory will be the result.” -
“Two minutes more, JIM,” said his wife, “and calm your mind by
pouring out the beer.” - - - -
“Experience of the irregularities of feminine computation of time,
my dear, induces me to defer that operation until your c ry duties
shall have been completed, as any effervescence which may be generated
by the transfer of the liquor from one vessel to the other will certainly
have subsided before your preparations will have terminated.”
“You’re another,” .."his wife, setting the hissing cheese before
him, and giving him a playful box on the ears by way of grace. -
“I am disinclined to believe that the oldest habitué of the Cheshire
Cheese ever addressed himself to a rabbit that better ſulfilled the condi-
tions prescribed by the sages of nutrimental lore,” replied her husband,
smiling. “Let me transfer a portion to your plate.” . -
“A wee bit, dear. To tell truth, I had something with the kids.”
“That is a violation of the engagement, both expressed and implied,
JENNY, that our concluding meal should be taken simultaneously.’
“Well, I’m here, am I not, grumble?” . . . -
“As the immortal bard of"Avon has felicitously expressed it, you
keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to the hope. , But the
quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands, and let us drown all
unkindness in the flowing bowl.”
“Ah! mind my nice clean cloth!” -
“As another poet less familiar to the general public than the sweet
swan of Avon observes, ‘A little water takes the sin away.’”
“Very fine, but you don't pay the washing bills.”
“Base is the slave that pays, that is to say except when he remune-
rates the purveyor of information for the sensational literature, which he
furnishes, and makes the basis of such remuneration the original quantity
of matter supplied, not that to which the fastidiousness of his vitiated
taste or the urgencies of an advertising public induce him to condense
the narrative .# his contributor.” -
... Anything up to-night, JIM, dear? I hope so.” -
“I am gratified to be able to communicate the information that your
anticipations are not doomed to disappointment. I, was privatel
apprised by one of the guardians of the public peace, whose early intel-
ligence I have frequently secured by a slight compensation, that much
excitement prevailed in the immediate vicinity of Gray's Inn Lane, in
consequence of a report that an establishment for the retail sale of
spirituous liquors was in a state of conflagration.”
... Gin-shop caught fire, elf" - - -
“Hastening thither, I was fortunate enough to recognise in an
intelligent official (who was bellowing, in a general manner, at the top of
voice, for any kind of assistance, but without specifying the particu-
lar character of the aid desired) the respected beadle of a distant parish,
who by a concatenation of circumstances upon, which it is not now
necessary to dilate, happened to be in the proximity of the establish-
ment. He obligingly favoured me with information which in addition
to the results of my own observation, I.combined in a statement which
ave reason to believe will materially assist you in the purchase of
that elegant novelty in the light of a bonnet that you have long been
anxious to eliminate.”
“You are a dear old long-winded, duck, and that’s what you are,”
said his pretty wiſe, kissing him. “And now come to the fire and
have your pipe.” - -
“I recommend you as a preliminary arrangement to concentrate the
devouring element, my dear.”
'' Poke the fire together?, Do it yourself, lazy bones.”
And the meritorious couple sat down with their toes upon the fender
for a conjugal gossip.
[The smartness of the above satire is no excuse for its injustice...In
the first place, the honest fellows who cook up the sensation writing
for our breakfast-tables are just the very last persons to talk the bosh
which they write: in the second, everybody ought to be very much
obliged to them for running about half ſi. nights to make articles for
us: and lastly, we believe that the majority of the public love long
words better than short ones, and on the whole consider the use of
vestry-man's jargon a proper compliment to themselves. Now then,
Mr. Contributor.]—Punch.
LINES TO A LEADEN BULLET.
“Pisa, Nov. 26. Atten o'clock this morning Dr. ZANETri successfully extracted
the bullet from GARIBALDI's wound.—Reuter's Telegram.”
WHAT gold or gem, discoloured lump of lead,
Now in a hero's wound no more to rankle,
Outshines thee, drawn to light from that deep bed,
Where thou hast lain in GARIBALDI’s ankle
Thy lustre is such glory as redounds
rom hangmen's tools that wrought a Martyr's passion,
Clear of the doubt that commonly surroun
Those trinkets of ecclesiastic fashion.
No fable 'tis that thou didst strike him down
Against oppression strong and shameless, leading
A hope forlorn; what Saint e'er won his crown
In juster cause more generously bleeding?
By thee he fell upon his march to Rome,
Where the Elect of France expounds her mission,
Trampling the right by which he reigns at home;
Propping by force the rule of superstition.
True Relic, how unlike that spurious Cross,
he Legionary badge false France wears on her!
That bauble's but the mock of Honour’s loss,
Thou art the emblem of all lost but Honour.
REDRESS, NOT UNDRESS.
THE Police of Newcastle-upon-Tyne have grievances, which they
appear to have set before their superiors in a sensible and respectful
manner, and which, generally speaking, Mr. Punch considers reason-
able. The constables want a little more time for tea, and this is a proper
request, as nothing is more disagreeable than to burn one's iº. and
a policeman rushing to administer the law, with his mouth full of bread
and butter is certainly deficient in the dignity which should appertain
to the Executive. They also ask for a fair hearing, and a right of de-
fence, when complained against, and on the whole Mr. Punch deems this
not to be an outrageous demandon the part of an Englishman. They
further beg to be treated civilly by their superiors, and not to be intimi-
dated or sworn at, and there may be something to be said in favour of
this petition, as also in favour of a prayer that when a night constable
has to attend in court the first thing in the day, he may be allowed to
go tº bed at four o'clock in the previous morning. So far, Mr. Punch
is all with the Newcastle police. ... But their concluding suggestion
demands pause. It is this:-
“That the inspection of clothing be abolished, as a more disgraceful thing canno
be than a Police-constable carrying his clothes continually about the streets.”
If this applies only to the night police we do not know that there is
much to say against the proposed arrangement, except that the nights
are yery cold º now, and that an undraped policeman must, one
would think, be rather uncomfortable. Still, if he likes to ſº about
without clothes aſ a time when, except the police none but bad charac-
ters, who are not sensitive, are likely to be about, we do not object, the
less that we don't live in Newcastle. But in the interest of that respec-
table city, Mr. Punch would protest against such an arrangement for
the day time, and he ". it to the intelligent constables whether, dis-
graceful as they may think it to carry their clothes about the streets, it
would not be almost as disgraceful to walk about without conventional
integuments. The statuesque has its merits, but it is hardly suited to
the police-force. This is the only serious objection which Mr. Punch
can make to the memorial, and he hopes to hear that the authorities
have attended to all the other complaints, which, if well grounded, do not
N: well for the good sense and good feeling of the police s of
ewcastle-upon-Tyne.
A Shakspearian Query.
In Hamlet, Act II., Scene 2, is this:—
“King. He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's disternper.
“Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main.”
Does her, Majesty imply that Hamlet suffered from sea-sickness?
This would be an interesting hint for the next revival.

A HINT
TO PARTIES WHO RESIDE IN A GAROTTING NEIGHBOURHOOD.
SENTIMENT'S PET.
CoME let us be merry and drink while we may,
More punch, ToM, and see that it’s hotter,
| And hope going home we shan’t meet on the way
| Sweet Sentiment’s pet, the Garotter.
At present proud London’s a criminal's den,
We envy the home of the cotter,
His fare and his couch may be humble, but then
He don't apprehend the Garotter.
We once sent such rascals across the broad sea,
But prigs took to preaching and potter,
And now not a decentish thoroughfare’s free
From the fruit of their bosh, the Garotter.
A gentleman’s walking, perchance with a crutch,
He’ll suddenly stagger and totter;
Don’t think that the gentleman’s taken too much,
He’s unluckily met a Garotter.
A lady beside yonder crossing you note,
That rascal has chosen to “spot” her,
One scream, but the next is suppressed in the throat
Fmbraced by the brutal Garotter.
There are but three ways to get out of his beat,
| Turn coachman, or tiler, or yachter,
For no one who walks on HER MAJESTY's street
| Is safe from the scoundrel Garotter.
Mrs. Gamp, though a wretch, was by no means a fool,
And “Live and let live was her motter; ”
But." I'll live and you shan't.” is the rascally rule
Of society's foe, the Garotter.
Many ways are proposed to extinguish the pest,
And punish the ruffianly plotter;
But this is the cheapest, §§ uickest, and best,
And will finish the dastard tter.
Just take a good cord, and divide her in nine,
Let a skilled boson’s-mate rig and knot her:
Then lay the sound lesson of “line upon line”
Into Sentiment's Pet, the Garotter.
WANT OF HOLY WATER.
AN enormous concourse of Irish Yahoos assembled on Sunday last
week at Blackheath, in order to make a demonstration against the
demand of the Roman people that the French troops should go away
and leave them to choose their own Government. This truly monster-
meeting consisted of several thousands of those horrid creatures, who
had congregated at Deptford, from Dockhead, Bermondsey, Rother-
hithe, and other places in the neighbourhood, at which, they have
established hordes. Having reached their destination, the bulk of the
herd arranged itself about a mound, which was occupied by some
twenty of the leading Yahoos. Their orgies commenced by the utter-
ance of loud hurroos for the Pope of RomE and hideous yells and
groans for GARIBALDI. -
Four chief, Yahoos then harangued the herd in, furious gibberish,
accompanied by violent gesticulations. Their gabble, as far as it was
ãº was understood to signify their determined sympathy with
their Holy Father, as they did PIUs THE NINTH the honour of calling
him, and their hatred to that GARIBALDI whom they honoured much
more highly by calling him a buccaneer, and other abusive names.
They boasted that they had come there quietly, without their shille-
laghs, to vindicate Popery and the tempora absolutism of the Pope by
mere howling; for which they were prepared to, shed the last drop of
their blood, if the perpetual enslavement of the Romans should require
that precious sacrifice. -
A scarcely articulate resolution of sympathy with the Pope, in his
antagonism to Italian unity, was then agreed upon, and carried with
an unanimous whoop, and the herd of Yahoos, though they screech at
the Reformation, then re-formed, and marched off the heath, amid the
derision of the spectators, in a dirty procession consisting of tag, rag,
and bobtail. -
Whilst the Irish Yahoos were holding their congress, order was
maintained by a large body of police, mounted and on foot, which had
been got ready to protect them from º possible interference on the
part of the British public. This was a highly proper precaution, and
would have been a very just arrangement, if it had not been one-sided.
But the police have orders to disperse the crowds of people who sym-
pathise, with the Italians, , whilst they are employed, to guard the
assembled Yahoos during the continuance of their hullaballoo for the
papacy.
Perhaps the better plan would be impartially to disperse both parties.
For this purpose it might be judicious to adopt MR. HANs BUSK's
suggestion of a fire-engine to open water on either side. In the case of
the Yahoos this proceeding would be peculiarly advantageous. Not
only would they derive some bodily benefit from a sprinkling with
clean water, but their spiritual interests might at the same time be
promoted, at least to their own satisfaction. Their priests have recom-
Imended them not to hold these open-air meetings, and therefore should
º of the peaceable, dispersion of such assemblies. To that end,
if the authorities should resolve to employ a fire-pump, would the
reverend gentlemen be so obliging as to consecrate its contents, and
then work it?
THE TEXT FOR THE TIME.
DoN'T rob poor PETER to help poor PAUL,
But find, as we can, our mite for all:
Nor pass hungry mouths and bare backs in the South,
To help in the North, cold, hunger, and drouth.
If there’s new need far off there’s old need at the door:
Then let those give now who ne'er gave before;
And those who gave always now give more.
Each purse that the starving are free to use
Will |...} be sure, a widow’s cruise,
Still filled from some mysterious hive, .
As folks give more they’ll find more to give.
ONE REAson why THE Pope should BE DIVESTED of HIs TEM-
PORAL Power.—Because it takes four crowns to make a sovereign,
and he has only three.

ow many people have
short memories in
these “Sensation”
craving days. But
we have probably
some readers who
recollect the Cri-
mean War, and to
them the paragraph
which follows may
be interesting:—
“DEATH or A WeTE-
RAN.—Died, on the 9th
instant, at the Cavalry
Barracks, Cahir, “Cri-
mean Bob," the oldest
#. horse in the
British cavalry. This
veteran commenced his
career in the 15th
Hussars, and on their
embarcation for India
was transferred to the
14th Light Dragoons,
and from that regiment
to the 11th Hussars in
like manner when the
14th were ordered on foreign service. He first joined the army, on the 2nd of October, 1833,
making a total of military service of nearly 30 years, during which period he was all through
the Crimean campaign, and was ridden in the memorable charge of Balaklava, and at the battles
of Alma and Inkermann by the present farrier-major of the regiment, and during the whole of
the campaign was never once struck off duty through sickness. On the return of the regiment
to England he was shown to his Royal Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief, who would
not allow him to be cast, but ordered him to be retained in the regiment until his death, which
occurred on Sunday morning from old age and general decay, to the sincere regret of all ranks
of the regiment, from the colonel down to the youngest recruit, with whom the old horse was a
universal favourite.-United Service Gazette.”

Army historians have chronicled the lives of many asses, but this is the first | N
time that we have ever known them to biographise a horse,
and we rather wish that fuller details had been given anent
the animal whose brief but touching memoir we transcribe.
We should have liked to know #. ºf: and early
education; what sphere of life he filled ere he became a
troop-horse, and how it happened that he entered upon
military work. Bob must certainly have had the constitu-
tion of a horse, or he never would have gone through
the campaign in the Crimea without even once being put
on the sick list When we recollect the hardships and the
sickness that were suffered then, we can hardly compre-
hend how any animal escaped them; and we can hardly
help suspecting that a telegraphic order was sent out from
the Horse Guards, commanding the Crimean men to “take
care of Bob.” We can scarcely think it likely that Bob
lived on board a yacht, as certain others who survived the
Balaclava charge were said to do; but at any rate Bob
must have been especially, provided for, and must have
somehow got full rations, while his comrades were engaged
in eating one another's tails. Our military veterans are
not always, it is whispered, well cared for in retirement,
and we are glad to see that Bob was comfortably pensioned;
for now that they have treated a quadruped so well, we may
trust that the authorities will serve their bipeds better
than they may as yet have done. Many a human veteran
half starving on half-pay, must almost wish himself a horse
to live in luxury like Rob; who, petted as he was, must
have felt always pretty bobbish.
We repeat, we wish Bob's pedigree had been supplied by
his biographer. Considering his long connection with the
Army, it would be pleasantly appropriate to show he was
in some way descended from Bucephalus, or some other
fine old war-horse. As it is, we must content ourselves
with thinking him related to the race of GENERAL HAY:
GNAw, or ſancying him connected with the family of
EY.
WILD SPORT AT COMPIEGNE.
The chords of that heart which has any love of noble sport in it will
always vibrate in unison with the burden of the brave old song:—
“Hey ho, chevy |
Hark forward, hark forward, tantivy I
This day a stag must die.”
A stag died the other day at the forest of Laigue near Compiègne
after a chase which certainly ought to have made everybody concerned
in it cry tanti The following description of this truly wild hunt is
from the pen of an eye-witness:–
“Just when the deer started, His Majesty, who was in plain clothes, re-entered
his carriage, while the EMPREss, the PRINCEss ANNA MURAT, and PRINCE Joachinſ
MURAT, who were on horseback, followed the hounds. After a rapid chase the stag
threw itself into the Aisne, but, being alarmed by the cries of the persons assembled
on the opposite bank, returned to land, and again took to the forest. The dogs
were for a time thrown off the scent, but afterwards recovered it, and the stag was
at length come up with on the banks of the river. It again plunged, but, ortu-
nately, was killed by a shot from a rifle, and disappeared in the water.”
And so the stag that was destined to die that day, died amid the
cries of the spectators assembled on the other side of the river, by the
rifle-shot of some forester amongst them, who, of course, was instantly
decorated with ribbons as a successful marksman. In the meantime
the EMPREss, the PRINCEss ANNA MURAT, the PRINCE JoAchim
MURAT, and the other ladies and gentlemen whom we may suppose to
have been in at the death, were no doubt also giving utterance to their
emotions in shouts, than which none could have n more suitable
than such approximations to our own inspiriting halloos as Hého chivá /
Arcq forwad, arcq-forwad, tantité! As to the hounds, they must have
been equally excited at º; the stag shot, and it may well be
i. that every “little dog laughed to see such sport.”
no doubt have equally amused the EMPEROR, if he had witnessed it,
but his Imperial Majesty, for whom such headlong-harum-scarum work
was probably rather too much of a good thing (like the bull-fight)|
stayed behind in his carriage, attired in plain clothes, and not in the
frogged hunting-jacket, the plumed cap, and the jack-boots, with the
cutlass at his side, and the ophicleide on his arm, befitting a greater
than grand reneur on such an occasion. He came in, however, for some
of the ſun, for we read in continuation that:—
“The body was not found until the next day, when the curée took
by torchlight in the court-yard of the Palace. Their Majesties an
guests witnessed the scene from the balcony.”
Here was more chevy if not tantivy to divert his Imperial Majesty;
#: was Chevy Chase, in so far as, according to our ancient tºld of
name:-
lace as usual
most of the
“To the quyrry then the PERsſ, went
To se the bryttlynge off the deare.”
It would
|Only instead of the case being that “a hondrith fathartes ded ther
lay,” to be paunched and quartered, the fact was that there was only a
jº. stag, though that one most likely looked, plump enough, as it
been soaking twenty-four hours in water. The clown who likes to
See a dead pig cut up, would prefer witnessing that spectacle by day-
light, and immediately after the death of the animal; but pork is not
venison; and tre curée of the stag that had been fished out of the river
was no doubt a rich treat to the eholders, if in a certain peculiarity
they lesemble those first Norman kings of ours of whom it was said
that they “dearly loved the high deer.” It is to be hoped that the
hunters and huntresses of Compiègne enjoyed their haunch.
THE MILDNESS OF OUR MAGISTRATES.
WE of course should never dream of recommending such an outrage
but really it would be a good thing for society if somebody or other would
just garotte a Magistrate. From the mildness of the sentences inflicted
for assaults and robberies with violence, one is almost led to fancy that
the Magistrates imagine that garotting is a harmless and quite yenial
amusement, and they who practise such º ought but lightly
to be punished for it. Knocking a man down and stamping on his
stomach is a little ebullition of boisterous hilarity, to which robbers in
rude health are naturally prone. The other day there was a case of
robbery with violence, where the thief was sent to prison for six months
for the robbery, and for only one month extra on account of the assault.
This is quite the usual proportion now for punishments, and the most
savage act of cruelty is dealt with far more leniently than the slightest
act of theft. In the magisterial eye one's person is of much less value
than one's purse; and to filch one's pocket-handkerchief is a crime
| worse than half-strangling one, or nearly bludgeoning one's brains out,
Had Magistrates to use their brains more often than they seem to do,
they possibly might place a higher value on the article.
A man who earns his livelihood by exercise of thought may be robbed
of a year's income by a rap upon his head; and his bludgeoners, not
merely will rob him of the cash that he may chance to have about him,
but may deprive him of the power to earn enough to pay the doctor's
bill for healing him. By a blow upon the brain-pan, or a throttling of
the throat, a clever money-earning man may be made a helpless º:
and perhaps his wife and family be left without support. Surely if the
Magistrates thought more about the misery, a ruſhan may cause, they
would think less tenderly about the brute himself. Mercy to the mis-
creant may prove a savage cruelty to helpless you or me...What, we
want just now is justice, and not maudlin generosity. As it is, the law
appears to be more careful of Bill Sykes and his comfort and well-being
than it is of SMITH or BRowN who are law-fearing, honest men; and
ruffians are petted, worked little, and well fed, while the men whom
they half murder, for aught we know, may starve.

SCANDAL OUT OF THE SERVANTS' HALL.
WE read in the Morning Star that MR. GeoRGE THOMPsoN was to
lecture at Finsbury Chapel on last Thursday evening—the subject being
º American War”—after which we are told by the same paragraph
at :—
“WILLIAM ANDREw Jackson, ex-coachman to JEFFERson Davis, President of the
rebel Confederacy, is also announced to address the meeting.”
We think this practice of setting up servants to inveigh against their
former masters is extremely undignified, if not snobbish. The fact of the
servant in this instance being a black one, does not in the least lighten
the offence, because he is evidently put forward by the anti-slavery
arty with no other object than to make out JEFFERSON DAVIS to be as
lack, morally, as WILLIAM ANDREw Jackson is physically. How
would M. George Tºrsos like his own ex-coachman to tell the
public everything he knew about him, mixed up with a great deal of
what he did not know? It is true that coachmen, when they assume
the elevated seat of their directorial functions, are allowed to turn their
backs º their masters, but that is no reason why a former flunkey
should be permitted to do the same before a crowded assembly, or
encouraged by applause to lay the whip about the shoulders of his
master’s character as much as his servile imagination pleases. We
doubt if MR. WASHINGTON WILKs himself would be an admirer of a
similar system, supposing any discharged butler of his made a practice
of informing his audience what quantity of wine, or grog, his master
consumed every day, and how many servants he was in the habit of
kicking down-stairs before sallying out of an evening to lecture on
Civil and Religious Liberty. -
Such a system of secret-telling, though probably very entertaining,
would be condemned as most disgraceful, and those who listened .
be blamed even more than those who talked. The sooner this tittle-
tattle of the Servants' Hallis put a stop to, the better. It is only what
JENKINs does in private life, when surrounded by an admiring circle of
milliners' girls, or chamber-maids. It may be true that “no man is a
hero to his valet-de-chambre,” but that is no justification why we
should demean ourselves so low as to encourage the valet to throw out
all his master’s dirty linen in our presence merely to gratify our dirty
curiosity. Listen to every valet, and you will soon be left without a
single hero.

mindful of what is due to glorious artists even though they may not be
all that they were in their very best days. Perhaps both France and
Spain are better judges of the bull-fight, so dear to their masters
mistresses, than the opera. Certainly in MARIo's case, we may say,
Laudaturah hiss.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PROTECTION FOR PEDESTRIANS.
IF, in spite of penal servitude, these street outrages continue, it is clear that
we must arm ourselves against garotting ruffians, and that our.weapons, for the
warfare must consist of something more than a cane or an umbrella, a doorkey of a
toothpick. In the savage days when London was infested by the Mohawks, gentle-
men wore swords, and knew how to use them ; and clearly, some such fashion as
this must be revived, if we would escape being either maimed or murdered, Metal
collars with long spikes must be worn instead of paper ones, and great coats made
à-la-porcupine must be likewise introduced, with spring daggers at the elbows and
sharp spikes all up the back, ready to start out and stab, the Thugs whº may attack
us. The Anti-Garotte suit will be advertised by tailors, and gº
dressing for suburban evening parties will be advised to make a trial of SNIP AND
Co.'s steel helmet, or recommended to provide themselves with SNooks's coat of
mail. Nobody will deem his costume as complete without having a life preserver
or stout bludgeon to his wrist, and belting round his waist a cutlass or a broad-
sword. Tailors will turn armourers and swordmakers and gunsmiths.; and to their
question of “Any other article to-day Sir?” they will add the wish that you would
try their razor bowie knives, or will beg you just to look at their bayonet-
revolvers, or will say they have invented a sweet thing in the bludgeon way and the
neatest pair of knuckle-dusters that have yet come out. - -
Really from the outrages which have been lately º one might think
that one was living now in London as it used to be a hundred years ago; and one
expects to see the managers of theatres and concert-rooms give notice as of old,
that stout fellows armed with cudgels will be in waiting nightly, to escort such of
the audience as wish it to their homes.

EGYPTIAN BONDAGE.
. In a communication from Alexandria giving an account of the progress, if that
is a proper expression, of M. Lesseps's Suez Canal, the number of labourers
emplo f on that desperate undertaking is estimated at 40,000 fellahs; and, we
are told :—
“These labourers are paid by piecework under their respective sheikhs.
Government collects
and conveys the men to the i. punishing all fugitives with hard labour in chains, which
proves that the service is not voluntary.” -
Poor fellahs! Part of so little of the cutting as has been already made,
extends through a tract of driſt-sand, and amounts to a ditch, whereof the
gentlemen when ||
dimensions, according to the authority above cited, are
“from 14 to 15 metres wide on the water line, and two
metres deep,” at present; “but a casual simoom may at any
time reclose the thoroughfare.” The compulsory toils of
the Danaides, and the penal servitude of the demon whom
the magician, set to work in making ropes of sand appear
to have found their match in the unproductive labour of
those pitiable fellahs who are so pitilessly fagged at the

THE POOR GAROTTER.
THE poor Garotter, fierce, and rude,
How shall we soften that man's mind,

And teach him to be good and kind?
Oh let us send him to a place,
Of refuge, not to call it gaol,
And treat with gentleness his case,
For fear severity might fail.
We 'll clothe him warm, and feed him well,
If not on sausages and tripe -
Though against beer we close his cell,
And wean him from his nasty pipe:
Give him good books and tracts to read,
And teach him texts on texts to string,
Repeat his prayers, recite his creed,
And psalms and hymns with unction sing.
We’ll practise him in heaving sighs
Remorseful, and compunctious groans,
We’ll school him. to upturn his eyes,
In going on his marrowbones,
To use the pocket-handkerchief,
Snuffle, and blow his nose, and weep,
And trust we’ve changed this blessed thief
Out of a wolf into a sheep.
In healthy, not excessive, toil,
His strength we’ll use him to exert,
His easy labour shall not spoil
His hands; for he must not be hurt.
And oh! on no account the Cat
Across his shoulders would we lay.
Score naughty soldiers' backs with that;
The poor Garotter never flay.
Corrected, chastened, and subdued,
Converted, rendered meek and mild,
Repentant, humbled and renewed,

The period of his sentence o'er
Not half, we’ll pity and forgive,
Bidding him § rob no more,
But like a Saint in future live.
Ah! what if he resume the track
Of crime, which he before had trod,
And if again we have him back,
Within a month or so, in Quod?
Then, how are we, whose hearts have gushed
Towards this brute, with overflow,
To cure the throat his †† has crushed,
Or cranium fractured with his blow *

Here’s no whining, wailing, shamming,
Think what sorrows underlie
“Welly Clamming.”
In our prisons rascals sleep
Amply fed, well-nigh to cramming,
Honest hearts in silence weep,
“Welly Clamming.”
Shameless beggars bellow loud,
Thoughtless benefactors bamming;
These § fireless chimney bowed,
“Welly Clamming.”
Shameless paupers enter bold -
Workhouse doors behind them slamming,
These sit shivering in the cold,
“Welly Clamming.”
Clothe them; blankets, jackets, hose,
In a kindly hurry ramming
Inlo bags sent off to those
“Welly Clamming.”
Feed them. Round no Union door
They stand jeering, jostling, jamming;
Send them food, and hear no more
“Welly Clamming.”
Were the stream of gold, I wis, .
E’er so near to check and damming,
It must flow in flood at this—
“Welly Clamming.”
Help them. Spring will soon be here,
Smiling, greening, flowering, lambing,
You'll be paid, to miss that drear
“Welly Clamming.”
These are forced and feeble rhymes–
Let the faintest praise fall damning
On them, so their moral chimes
“Welly Clamming.”
Mr. N. It is about their welfare that I wish to speak seriously, if
you would let me. WALTER’s education ought to be taken in hand.
Mrs. N. I had always supposed that a boy's education was his
father's business, not his mother's.
Mr. N. That is too good, when you have doggedly opposed every
roposal I ever made for having the boys taught anything. You and
}. GRIEvous together have made such a clamour whenever I sug-
fººlins like teaching that I wonder the lad knows B from a
l’s foot.
Mrs. N. (with a grimace). I hope, poor things, that somehow they
will be taught enough to preserve them from vulgarity.
Mr. N. Well, I don't stand on the bull's foot, it was a plurase of the
last generation. I retract the bull, and again I say that WALTER, if
not EDGAR, ought to go to school. -

Mr. N. I am not, but with spiteful nonsense.
Mrs. N. That you never hear from me. I do not know, of course,

Mr. N. Ah! One might think WALTER and EDGAR were children by

Mrs. N. A mother can despise such a wicked imputation. If you
could be cool for a moment, and permit me to speak, I would tell you
that I have been consulting MR.S.NotchLEY about the children.
Mr. N. And why should you consult that prig P
Mrs. N. That prig, as you coarsely call him, has had the superinten-
dence of the education .*children of first-rate persons, and his advice
must therefore be valuable.
Mr. N. I am not a first-rate person, and his advice may go–(rather
ashamed of himself)—may go where it is wanted.
Mrs. N. (looks at him, but for once makes a golden bridge for a flying
enemy). You cannot be so cruel, HENRY, as not to desire that your
children should be brought up better than you have been.
Mr. N. (taking the bridge). Well, in some senses, I do desire it. But
I should not like them to be SNotch LEYs.

Mr. N. I’ll tell you about that when I hear what it was.
Mrs. N. He recommended that the boys should not be sent to
school.
Mr. M. Well, he doesn't keep one, certainly.
Mrs. N. I should be ashamed of such, paltriness, HENRY. He says
that the schools about here are not the thing.
... Mr. W. What thing? The thing his notion of a school would be,
silver forks, and parsing out of the Peera -
Mrs. N. Even if it were so, no child is the worse for knowing the
names of the aristocracy.
Mr. W. No, for when he gets into business, he'll be better able to
avoid discounting their bills. - - -
Mrs. N. As I believe our º: are not going into business, that
radical and unjust sneer is quite beside the question.
Mr. N. There are some very good schools round here. CHARLEs
HElstoy was saying so the other morning on the top of the buss.
Mrs. N. (almost sublimely). And you would send a child to a school
recommended on the top of an omnibus!
Mr. N. Ha! ha! haſ I can’t be †. with you, my dear, in the
face of such, a noble sentiment; , Yes, HELSTON says that there's, a
capital school round here in Rockton Grove-Aſiany, I think, was the
name, but you can send and ascertain particulars. -
Mrs. N. (sarcastically). I need not send far. The younger children of
RHATANY, the chemist, go there. I know that for a fact.
Mr. N. A very good recommendation, , RHATANY is a very clever
man, and would certainly not send his children where they would not be
well taught and treated.
Mrs. N. Thank you, HENRY. I have no wish that my children should
come home smelling of rhubarb, and magnesia. can give them
nothing else, I will give them the education of gentlemen. Perhaps
you would like to ask MR. RhATANY to dinner?
Mr. N. 1 should, dev–I should like very much, only he’d be bored
with such talk as is mostly heard here. RHATANY attends lectures by
FARADAY and Owen, and might not much care for Dundrearyism. But
if ALLABY won't do for you and the DUKE OF SNOTCHLEY, there’s
another good school, not much farther—the ReverEND MR. PIPUs's.
Mrs. N. The name would be, enough, but are you aware that the
Reverend MR. PIPUs, as you im, is a Dissenter? -
Mr. N. That’s truly awful. But as Dissenters do not, for being so,
as yet come under the actual operation of the criminal law, I think we
might inquire whether the monster has any redeeming points.
Mrs. N. HENRY, I know well your levity on all serious matters, but
here my duty compels me to speak. My children shall be gentlemen
and Christians.
Mr. N. PIPUs took honours at Cambridge.
Mrs. W. The more shame for Cambridge, HENRy, to allow such
things, §º know that it was always considered a low College.
M. Was it, dear I didn't know. But if you say so, that settles
PIPUs, though he wrote a º to Essays and Reviews.
Mrs. N. I may not approve of that work, but it is like MR. PIPUs's
impertinence, living in a back street at Brompton–
Mr. M. (Maliciously). South Kensington, dear. -
Mrs. W. To take º himself to answer the clergy of the Establish-

utionists.
Mr. W. (grately). I don't know that I exactly wish it. What have
you to propose, then?
º M. Any proposal of mine will of course be met with outcry and
SCOII.
Mr. N. Never mind, make one, and be a martyr.
Mrs. W. I think that a tutor might come in and instruct WALTER
and EDGAR for a few hours in the day,
Mr. A. A private tutor. Hm, I hear the voice of SNOTCHLEY.
#. N. Certainly it was his advice. I have no one else to ask coun-
Sei trom.

Mrs. W. Pray do.
Mr. W. You are a very highly educated wo—no, lady—you can't deny

RATHER SATIRICAL.
CAPTAIN Swellington. “What a beautiful Muff, Miss Merriton—Charming Muff—there's something very delightful in a Muff."
Miss MERRITON. “Dear me, Captain Swellington, is your Trumpeter dead?”
SIR JOSHUA JEBB'S PEN OF PRIZE LAMBS.
(At the Metropolitan Fat-Cattle Show, Dec. 1862.)
WHAT ELLMAN of Glynde was as au improver of our short-woolled
Southdowns, BAKEwell, of Ditchley as an improver of the old long-
woolled Leicesters, and CULLEY of Fenton, or JonAs WEBB of Babra-
ham, as crossers of the long and short-woolled strains, SIR Joshua JeBB
may claim to be in the case of his favourites, known as the Dart-
moor or Portland variety of the old black-legged, coarse-featured, bull-
headed, thick-necked, Newgate breed,
A pen of SIR Joshua’s lambs just now on exhibition in the Metro-
olis (and delineated on the opposite page º our Artist), are considered
y all the judges as the most perfect examples yet seen of what may be
done to develope the animal by careſul selection of the stock in the first
instance, and then by cultivating the natural qualities to the utmost
by high feeding, the greatest attention to warm, dry, and well-aired
housing, cleanliness, and every other condition of health and comfort.
In order to be able perſectly to estimate what SIR Joshua JEBB has
done for his favourite Portland and Dartmoor breed, we have only
to contrast, his pen, either with one of the old Newgate breed, scantily
fed, miserably housed, and harshly used in every way, or with one of
the native stock of the district about Portland and Dartmoor, un-
kempt, unwashed, ſaring hard, ill-lodged, and generally uncared for.
Sri joshua’s lambs are the very perfection of development: the some-
what coarse and heavy face and bull-neck run in the blood, but the fine
clear skins and short wool, the fat well laid on to the ribs, loins, and
quarters, but not in excess of what is required for perfect health and
symmetry, the sleek, round legs and forearms, and the general air of
content and well-being, are entirely due to SiR Joshua's admirable
system of diet and housing. SIR Joshua’s lambs are very free feeders,
and fatten very quickly, in spite of their heavy bone: they carry a short
fleece, but the present pen being shearlings, must be judged rather by
their symmetry than their wool. -
They are however a very costly breed, and this, with their confirmed
tendency to break bounds and run wild, at present militates much against
their popularity. SIR. Joshua has completely dissipated the notion
formerly prevalent that lambs of this class ought to be kept hard, and
would improve most rapidly on coarse and scanty fare, rough lodging,
and generally severe treatment. On this system we rarely saw the
qualities of the animal developed to anything like the perfection to
which SIR. Joshua has succeeded in bringing them. The Portland or
Dartmoor lamb remained a stunted, poor, meagre specimen of his race
ragged in coat, low in flesh, dull and gº!. in eye, carriage an
demeanour. The best proof how highly SIR Joshua's improved breed
is appreciated is the number he is annually enabled to let (loose), the
figure they cut in the (police) reports, and before the most eminent
judges, and the number that are annually sent abroad, which would be
much greater if our colonies had not somehow contracted a prejudice
against the breed, which has thrown a great deal too many on the home
market of late. SIR G. W. BRAMwell has lately borne striking
testimony to the merits of a sample, pen of SIR, Joshua's, lambs,
which came under that excellent judge's eye, and stood A 1 at the
last show in Newgate market.
In a word, it may be said of SIR Joshua's lambs, that wherever they
enter the field they floor everything that comes in their way. . Nothing
can stand against them. ... SIR. Joshua’s great secret after all is feeding
and lodging. Instead of the coarse and carelessly prepared “skilly”
which with bread and water constituted the food of the old Dartmoor
and Portland breeds, SIR Joshua’s improved lambs have a diet-table
varying daily, which includes a great variety of carefully prepared
mashes, and all the roots in season, to say nothing of other and more
substantial aliments. Then for the dark, damp, cold, and gloomy
quarters, once thought good enough for these animals, SIR. Joshua
has substituted clean, dry, spacious, airy and warm houses, in which
his lambs are, as a rule, far"better lodged than the labourers who are
employed about them. It is no wonder, if under this costly and careſul
system SIR Joshua’s lambs lay on meat freely, and exhibit the very
perfection of highly developed animal condition.
At how many pounds every one of these lambs stands we should not
like to guess, but it is certain they must come very heavy. The only
danger is, that such very high feeding may develope inflammatory

tendencies. SIR Joshua declares, however, that this high feeding is
necessary for the health of the animal when kept under, cover, and
fattened in the house. He would not advocate it for animals left to
run at large, . In short, if asked to point, to the most consummate
animals in this show we should turn to SIR. Joshua's pen of prize

GENEROUS DIET
|N GAOLS.
He following obser-
vations were made
JUSTICE
BYLEs, the other
day, in his charge
to the Grand Jury,
delivered at , the
Maidstone Assizes:
“It is said, gentle-
men, that the prisoners
live too well and better
S than paupers; but I pre-
* sume that your medical
officers will inform you
that with the infliction
of the separate system,
a diet, more or less gene-
rous, is to the bulk of
the labouring classes,
absolutely indispensa-
ble. If you deviate from
it, it may be that you
deprive the labouring
man of his only wealth,
his constitution, and,
in comparison to such
a sentence as that, to
sentence him to be
hanged would be a com-
parative mercy."
Just so, Brother BYLEs, and that is precisely why we do not want a
garotte-robber sentenced to be hanged. It is worse to have your skull
cracked, or a vessel in your brain burst, and to be rendered an idiot, or
to have your jaw smashed and †. teeth knocked out, and to be made
miserable for life, than it would to be killed outright. The punishment
suitable for a savage miscreant, who commits robbery accompanied with
atrocious outrages, is one to which that of hanging would, as regards
this world, be comparative mercy. No doubt, as you say, you may de-
Fº him of his constitution if you ſeed him upon a diet in some degree
ess than generous. Thereby we, agree with you that, if he were a
labouring man, you would deprive him of his only wealth. But he is not
a labouring man; he is a thieving man, and if you weaken his muscles
you will only diminish, the force with which he will clutch the throat
and batter the heads of people as soon as you have let him loose upon
society. By all means, therefore, let him be fed on the less than gene-
rous diet and not on the more. . - - - - - ---
Again, Brother BYLEs, we quite coincide with you in the proposition
that:- -
“The moment we begin to inflict cruel or unusual punishments we offend against
humanity and the Bill of Rights. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights is that
no Englishman shall be subject to cruel or unusual punishments.”
Therefore flogging in the Army, as it is certainly not an unusual
punishment, so neither is it a cruel one. If there is anybody who de-
serves flogging, it is the worst of scoundrels. Until, therefore, the
cat-o'-nine-tails shall have been formally voted to be an inconsistency
with the Bill of Rights, let the back of the arch-scoundrel Bill Sykes
be liable to its infliction, Let the punishment of a violent, robber be
fifty stripes, with penal servitude for life to follow. Don't hang the
wretch—give him a chance of * but no opportunity of testing
its sincerity in this world at the peril of HER MAJESTY's subjects.
Hold him fast, and keep him fasting—upon a diet neither more nor less
generous, but very spare. Seclusion, with low diet for internal remedy,
and the lash } way of outward application, that, Brother BYLEs, is the
treatment for ferocious ruffians.
. A labouring man betrayed by temptation into casual theft, or poach-
ing, undoubtedly had better be kept on a more or less generous diet,
in order that he may be enabled to work honestly for his living as soon
as he is discharged from the House of Correction. But, Brother BYLEs,
perhaps you will, on consideration, be inclined to allow that the crime
of theſt, or even the offence of poaching is at the best more heinous
than the fault of poverty, and that if ordinary convicts ought to be
allowed a more or less generous diet, the generosity of their dietary
allowance should be less, and not more than that of the proportion of
nutriment allotted to paupers.

LEGAL LIBERALITY.
WE take the following advertisement from the Law Times : —

drawing deeds, and a fair accountant. Salary £1 week. Office hours, 9 to 1

exceptions to its rule of liberality, and one of these exceptions is the

day to the abstraction of the cash-box, and, besides the other deeds with
J. he was entrusted, he might execute the deed of drawing a forged
cheque.
Moderate Charges.
MR. Punch, who, after his labours in the sphere of absurdity, seeks
recreation in serious reading, was much diverted with the Bishop of
LoNDoN's Charge. For tolerance, good sense, charity, and freedom
from cant, it is quite a curiosity of its kind. Mr. Punch never before read
any Episcopal Charge, not consisting of mere platitudes, so moderate.
ndeed, Bishop TAIT's Charge is as moderate as the charge of 3d., or
4.d. stamped, which is the charge of this celebrated periodical, and is all
that Mr. Punch will ask for his magnificent forthcoming Almanack.

Silver streams and streams of gold,

“SIR, “The Vatican, Dec. 5.
“I HAVE to request that you will present my acknowledgments
to EARL Russkit of the new proof which he has given in the des-
patch of the 12th ult, of which you were instructed to leave a copy
with me, of his interest in the affairs of the Government of his Holiness,
and that you will convey to him my grateful thanks for the admirable
lecture on Constitutional Government contained in that despatch, and for
the various Qutline or draft constitutions, which EARL Russell, has
had the condescension to submit for the acceptance of his Holiness.
Any further proof of interest in the affairs of his Holiness was
unnecessary from the author of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, under
which the Hierarchy of the Church, one and indivisible, enjoy in
safety.their present dignities and emoluments in Great Britain. The
stitutional lecture, invaluable as it is, is superfluous, as I have
already had the inestimable privilege of gleaning the substance of it from
his.Lordship's published works and Parliamentary speeches. The
draft constitutions are unhappily inappropriate to the dominions of
his Holiness. I return them, as his Lordship may find use for them
in his communications with other Continental governments, for which
he may be anxious to frame constitutions. The suggestions for the
suppression of brigandage here, I also return, with a request that
..}. they are put into force in the capital of his Holiness, they may
be tried in London, where his Holiness has observed with pain, and
something as near indignation as is compatible with Apostolic meekness,
that armed brigandage reigns unchecked in the streets, defying the
authority of the law, and daily assailing peaceful and orderly Citizens,
while engaged in their innocent avocations. , I have to request that you
will convey to EARL Russell his Holiness's indignation at a state of
things so incompatible with government and so seriously com-
promising the cause of law and order. Whatever may be the condition
of his Holiness's dominions or capital, he believes it will be admitted
by all who know both Rome and London, that the latter city is
|just now the less free from the dangers of robbery and assassination,
and that the number of persons º: to carry arms for their pro-
tection is larger in London than in Rome. I have at the same time to
request that you will convey to EARL Russell his Holiness's profound
and painful surprise at the system in force in the prisons under
the British executive. His Lordship, . will remember , the very
energetic remonstrances and, protests which he considered it within
his duty to offer against the treatment of prisoners in the king-
dom of Naples. I ſº to request that you will remind his Lord-
ship that if humanity may be outraged by harsh usage of the inmates of
a prison, common sense may be equally outraged by the pampering a
over-indulgence of the same class. His Holiness has observed with
deep pain, not unmingled with disapprobation, how entirely common
sense º been disregarded in the prison-system of England, where the
aged and infirm labourer, compelled to close a life of toil in the work-
house, is treated in that asylum of destitution with less consideration
and kindness than the sturdy and habitual breaker of the law in what
should be his place of punishment. -
“His Holiness, in his conviction that such a system must lead to
demoralisation, and that it is likely to tempt his Holiness's Irish subjects,
more especially, to purchase by crime those comforts which are denied to
virtuous poverty, has charged me to convey through you to EARL
Russell, for transmission to Her Britannic Majesty's Government,
this expression of his hope that energetic measures will forthwith be

If the Yankees believe

the EMPEROR or THE FRENch in a proffer of mediation between the hostile States,
inasmuch as, by our co-operation in that friendly overture, we could not aggravate
the determination to return us evil ſor good, which according to the New York
Times, is already as strong as it can be. Indeed, we could not do worse than
we are now doing if we recognised the Confederate Government at once, and

broke the blockade. On the contrary, we should do a
great deal better; because the only consequence of those
steps would, at the worst, be war with the Federal States,
which would be much less inconvenient for us now, than
it will be some time hence, when the Yankees will drag
us into a war with them for a year or two, or three, or four,
or more probably longer, with the view of finding an effec.
tive gure for their sectional heartburnings. For now we
et the South for an ally; whereas then we should
have to fight the Yankees single-handed.
But mind, Jonathan, the above logic is all conditional.
It rests only on the supposition that the New York Times
represents you. We believe no such thing. The idea
that you would dream of enforcing reparation from England
for the Alabama's depredations is as absurd as j be
the notion that we meant to call upon the United States to
indemnify us for the damage done through contraband of
war supplied during the late Crimean struggle by American
citizens to Russia. As if, too, you would be such a fool as to
complain of the sale of the Alabama to the Confederates,
when you know how much more of the means of warſare,
in the shape of gunpowder and weapons, is sold, on precisely
the same principle of neutrality, to you. No, Jos AthAN :
the malignant nonsense above quoted from the New York
Times could only have been conceived and uttered by a
particular species of mischievous, ill-conditioned unscru-
pulous blackguard.
It is the characteristic howl of the Yahoo, or Irishman
of the baser sort, who, for the good of his own country,
and for the bane of yours, has transported himself into your
midst. . He occupies many an Editor's writing desk, but
would be much more suitably situated in your gallant
army, where he would serve as food for Southern powder.
The fittest position of all for him would be that of suspension
at some altitude from the ground by a ligature embracing
his neck with a running noose, and maintaining him in
antagonism to the force of gravitation.

SOME REALLY USEFUL WORSTED WORK.
MY DEAR MRs. SNookELEY,
- THE other morning when I called on you I found you sitting
in the breakfast room with your three charming daughters, who were
all of them engaged in what # take to be their usual morning avocations.
EvangBLINE MATILDA was embroidering a slipper, intended I believe
for the curate of Saint Reredos, HoNoFIA MARIA was putting raven
ringlets on a º: worsted bandil, whose handsome features I may
some day have the happiness to sit upon, while AGNES ANGELINA was
reading aloud a thrilling chapter from a fashionable novel, whereof a
od deal of the melodrame (as well as of the morals). I have very little
oubt was of Parisian extraction. Of course I would not mar the har-
mony of this domestic scene, but as I walked away I could not help
.#. young ladies might perhaps find better things to do than
reading French morality and working blue-eyed bandits. And with this
thought, my dear Madam, just let me draw your notice to the followin
}; ſºn, which a correspondent sends me from the Liverpoo
tly Post:—
“MR; J, has fabricated a novel and warm blanket for the distressed poor in the
cotton districts. It has the advan of being strong, warm, and-costs nothing.
“It is made solely out of woollen Iist, remnants that in tailors shops are thrown
jº. or given to rag collectors. The mode of construction is simple, and the result
really pretty, not to say beautiful. The list is platted; and, by using divers colou
the blanket or quilt is made to look picturesque. A few stitches keep the whoſe
strong and perfect.
... By preserving the list in the tailors' shops throughout the kingdom, half-a-
million such b ets could be made in a week or a fortnight."
"List Q List,” young ladies!, Surely here is a kind of worsted work
quite as pleasant and more useful than making Berlin bandits and em.
broidering swell slippers for some clerical poor feet. Ask papa to tell
his tailor, to let you have, some list, and then set to work at once and
plat it into blankets for the poor folks in the North. Two pence a
pound, my correspondent tells me, is the price now asked for list by
tailors who want ". for it: and as nine pounds he informs me, are
enough to make a blanket, a pair of blankets of your making would cost
papa as little as a pair of gloves. List blankets may doubtless not be
quite so warm as Witney ones: but they will serve at any rate to keep
É folks from freezing, and, to a grateful fancy, the warmth of your
ind fingers will linger in the work.
Fondly ºf: my dear MRs. SNookELEY, that these few words of
mine may list a host of girls besides your own in this work, I
remain with all devotion to you all, -
Your faithful,
apūNeº.

GAROTTER HUNTERS WANTED.
(A Conſidential Letter to FRANK FALLowrDELD, Esq., of Cyder Court,
Devonshire.)
“DEAR FRANK, -
“You recollect what ſun we had with old SQUIRE DINGLE's
otter hounds that day by Brawley Bottom, and how, you blackguard
ou kept chaffing me about my Cockney way of living, and wondere
#. a fellow ever could be fool enough to waste his life in London,
where there was no chance of his enjoying any sport. Well now, if
you'll just come and spend a week with me this Christmas, I think I
can convince you to the contrary of that. I can't give you any otter
hunting, but if you want a new sensation, what d'ye say, my boy, to a
night's Garotter hunting *...We have got together a splendid ack this
season, and the game is still so pientiful that I’ll bet we’ll show you
some really first-rate sport. - - - -
“To tempt you up, old chap, I’ll just describe the way in which we
go to work. The meet takes place at some man's rooms, at eight
o'clock p.m. (on foggy evenings generally we meet at six o'clock) and
when we’ve got our pack together, we throw off in the direction where
we think it likeliest that we shall see some sport. To start the game,
one of the hunters, who is armed with a spiked collar, and has a spine
of little daggers bristling down his back, proceeds at a slow pace along
some quiet square or street, assuming as he does so a rather tipsy gait.
His corkscrewy gyrations are sure to start the Garotter if there be one
in sight, and when the vermin has once broken ground and fastened on
is, prey, the pack, who are provided, with stout hunting-whips and
cudgels, rush in and give the brute a thundering good thrashing, and
then pass him over to the hands of the police.
“If Garotter-hunting clubs were established about town, I think
that they would soon exterminate the animal; for łºś by the way

being soundly thrashed. This you know he never is when hunted down
by the police, who have orders, I believe, to treat him with all tender-
ness, and not to hurt a hair of the precious creature's head. When run
to earth in gaol he is well fed and never thrashed, and so of course the
breed is largely on the increase, and there is little fear at present of
there being no Garotters found to hunt. If we wish to clear our streets
of the vermin that infest them, we must get beaters and set them
well to work. So, as you have a good biceps, I hope that you’ll come up
and have a jolly run with our Garotter hunting pack; and meanwhile
believe me, my dear boy, -

SUBTERRANEAN NEWS.
MR. PUNCH invited the Underground Railway people to come forth
with a statement of their reasons for delaying the opening of their line.
With the usual deference which all well-regulated associations show to
any suggestion by Mr. Punch (it is in fact so suicidal in any person
to neglect Mr. Punch's slightest hint that the not answering him and
the appearing in the Gazette of Bankruptcy is one and the same thing,
to quote. Miss Miggs) the railway people immediately issued an apology
in the Times. They state that the Fleet Ditch irruption delayed the
completion of the Farringdon Street terminus, but that all is now ready,
from the lunch, that is to welcome Mr. Punch on the opening day
(he trusts that this remark does not apply to the oysters, as he has a
predilection for fresh ones) to the velveteen trousers of the porters.
The directors hope to open on the 22nd. In his turn, Mr. Punch hopes
that they wily, keep all their officials in a high state of temperance
during ºne, Christmas week, and even if extreme speed has to be
sacrificed while experience is being learned in the Sewer, the motto had
better be “slow and sewer,” rather than swift and smash., Being
deeply interested in this great bore, he makes no excuse for the hint,
indeed catch him making excuses for anything. The notification that
the rail is to be open has produced a most extraordinary phenomenon
in the New Road, and he has heard, but of course allows for exagge-
ration, that seven omnibus cads have spoken civilly to passengers
during the past week, and that one, to whom a threepenny piece was
tendered by mistake for fourpence, requested the other penny without
a single offensive expression. Competition is the true missionary of
humanity.

A RUINOUS
INQUIRY.
GREAT deal has been written
of late in the Lancet, the Corn-
hill, and other publications,
on The Effect { Railways
on the Health. poor dis-
heartened shareholder wishes
that some great analytical
inquirer would start another
scientific investigation, which
is no less important than
the above, and that is The
#. of Railways on the
ocket. He is convinced
that the result would be to
the full as disastrous, and
even more ruinous, in the
latter than in the former in-
stance. He doubts, as far
as he is concerned, whether
his monetary system will ever
be able to get over the shock
it has received from having
continued to trust itself so
long to the mercies of rail-
ways. He , wishes most
heartily that his pocket had
never had anything to do
with them. The constant collisions, the numerous accidents, the
alarming ups and downs of the Stock Exchange, the incessantvibrations
of the railway, market, that no break, or number of breaks, could
possibly control, have all conspired to shorten it to that extent that
all its functions have become completely paralysed. Every symptom
of circulation, he says, has long since ceased.

ROYAL SPANISH BRASS.
IRELAND has long, with some reason, enjoyed a peculiar celebrity.
The poet sings of
“Hibernia, famed, "bove every other grace,
For matchless intrepidity of face."
The effrontery, regarded as rather a natural characteristic of the Irish,
is well understood to be entirely peculiar to the sons, and quite other.

Observing as I did so, A.I.
wise than distinctive of the daughters, of Erin.” This consideration
prevents us from asking whether the QUEEN QF SPAIN, has any Irish
element in that azure fluid which, circulates in her Royal system, since
it was ible for her Catholic Majesty to utter, before the Cories the
other day, the following words, which were put into her Royal mouth
by her Ministers:—
“In continuing the system already commenced of liberty and toleration, and of
the sincere execution of the constitutional law; in accustoming the different classes
of society to the exercise of the rights which raise their dignity; and in inculcating
on all the principles of morality and of Christian religion, Heaven, witnessing our
conduct, wind to bless the efforts made.”
For example, Heaven will deign to bless the efforts made, on a system
of liberty and toleration, to convince MANUEL MATAMöRAs and his
companions, by punishing them with penal servitude, of the error which
they have committed in reading the Bible. On this mode of ...i
the principles of morality and the Christian religion, the constitution
Queen of Spain has the face to say, that she expects the blessing
of Heaven. ...What a face it must be!. One for which the best pos-
sible cosmetic, if it wanted such a thing, would surely be vitriol—
the fluid commonly to clean brazen utensils; a wash that, if strong
enough, might bring some little colour into the cheeks which it purified:
Tºšpanish Sovereign, on the part of her Government, also informed
her faithful Cortes, that she implored Divine goodness to hear their
§ “to bring about a cessation of the tribulations of the Sovereign
ontiff.” . This consummation, which she so devoutly wishes, might
possibly be expedited if the Sovereign Pontiff would bestir himself
to put a stop to the tribulations of other people, such as MATAMoRAs,
HAMA, and their partners in suffering for conscience'sake, who are per-
secuted in accordance with the system of liberty and toleration which
exists inlº under the sanction of that priesthood of whom the Pope
is the head. As long as persecution exists in a popish country unre-
buked by the Pope, civilised Europe will be of opinion that the Holy
Father's tribulations *#. cease only in their accomplishment by
the exoneration of his Holiness from the cares of temporal power.
Whereas a restoration of the papal sovereignty over the whole of the
Roman states is probably, that cessation of the tribulations of the
Sovereign Pontiff which is implored in the orisons of that unblushing
Queen of persecutors, the Catholic IsabelLA THE SECOND.

DETERMINED ATTEMPT AT GAROTTING,
DESPERATE RESISTANCE of THE VICTIM.
[N.B. The above is well authenticated, and not got up by penny-a-liners to alarm the public.
ON A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, on His own GROUNDs.
A COURT FOR FOOLS.
It appears to Mr. Punch that the Police Magistrates of the present
day have, thanks to galotters and other missionaries and evidences o
civilisation, almost enough to do, without being called upon to sit in
judgment in cases where abject folly complains of tempted knavery.
He scarcely ever takes up a newspaper without finding a report of a
case in which some Downright Ass comes before a Magistrate to make
a statement which, so far from entitling the complainant to pity, would
really justify the worthy Beak in deciding that a Fool’s Cap be placed
upon the plaintiff's head, and that he be summarily kicked out of court.
But, as mildness is the fashion of the day, and as Sir GeoRGE GREY
thinks that a remonstrance is the severest treatment which a ruffian
should receive, it would not do to be dreadfully harsh with idiots.
Therefore Mr. Punch proposes that a sort of Court of Ease be esta-
blished, in relief of the Police Magistrates, and that the Judge of this
Court be empowered to deal with cases which ought not to impede the
legitimate business of the regular tribunals. To this Court of Fools
Mr. Punch proposes that all complainants be sent whose allegations
begin in this way, or at all like it –
“I was looking over London Bridge, staring at the steamboats, and
a decent young man next me made a remark as I answered. We then
thought we would have a glass of ale together, and while we were
taking it at a house he recommended, there came in another man, who
had some ale too, and said he had got more, sovereigns than anybody
in the place. Now I had twenty-three pounds; so,” &c.
“I was looking at some billiard playing at the Shark and Blubber
tavern, and made an observation about the play, when a man near me
said I was quite right, and he could see I was a judge of the game, and
if I liked to see some ºº: play, and not i. that of these fools
he would show me some. We went, and he stood a glass of brandy and
water. It tasted rather,” &c.
“Seeing a crowd in the street, round a horse that had fallen, I
pushed in of course; not that I could be of any use, but I thought I had
as good a right to look as anybody. The ſellows were clumsy at it, and
Isaid so. A man said that he agreed, and that it was a shame to see a
noble animal like a horse ill treated. We had a little talk, and he said
f|he must go for his horse, and he should be proud to show it me, as I
seemed to know how horses should be handled. We went a long way,
and at last he took me into a dark stable, and then a man got up from
the straw, and before I could speak I was knocked down,” &c.
“Feeling hungry, I went into a coffee shop, and while I was having
a bit a man asked me if I minded his sitting opposite. I said no, and
he ordered something, and said he was waiting for a friend, who was
the son of a clergyman, and in a bit of trouble, but they hoped tº make
all right, and his friend had gone to see a rich relation and ask for a
loan.” I’saidi hoped he would get it., Presently the clergyman's son
came in, quite delighted like, and said that his uncle had been very kind,
had reproved his follies, and had stood a twenty-pound note, which was
more than he wanted. He was anxious about getting it changed, as a
bill had to be taken up to save his honour, and as the landlord hadu't
it, and time pressed, and he said he would give half a sovereign to save
that day, I J. I would,” &c.
Now that is the class of Idiot who, Mr. Punch thinks, ought not to
be allowed to waste the time of MR. MANsfield, Mr. ARNOLD, or
MR. KNox. But as justice ought to be done to everybody, there should
be a special Court for such matters, and when a booby presents himself
before a Police Magistrate, and begins in the above fashion, any of
those gentlemen, or their colleagues, should be able to cut him short-
“Go to the Court for Fools.” Not that we would punish the knaves a
bit the less (unless SIR GeoRGE GREY particularly wished it) but that
we consider a Court of Justice to be a tribunal for men, and not a
refuge for Donkeys.

PROTECTION FOR CABBY.
The demands of the Cabmen for the redress of their grievances are
now before us in the - modest and moderate are they, that
the subjoined quotations of them will doubtless be supposed to be the
offspring of our jocular fancy. But, in sober seriousness, the Cabmen,
represented by their delegates in a meeting at the Whittington Club,
actually propose the introduction, into an amended Hackney ºf:
Act, of a series of clauses, which we proceed to state, with the
necessary explanations:—
“l. The present 6d hiring to be abolished, and no driver to be compelled to let
his cab for than 1s., but to be bound to go two miles for that sum if required."
This stipulation may be admitted to be based upon a reasonable
sense of the dignity of a Cabman's profession. To be sure, by
the rule of vulgar arithmetic, as two miles are to one shilling, so is
one mile to sixpence. But sixpence is certainly a small sum, and a
Cabman has as much a right to decline such a fee, as a physician has to
refuse half-a-guinea.
“2. The metal badge now worn by drivers to be abolished, it being no proof
that the driver wearing it is the person duly licensed, and that in its place a cer-
tificate, containing a description of: rson licensed, be given to every driver on
receiving his licence which he shall uce when called upon to do so.”
A most considerate proposal. The Cabmen find that the badge now
worn by drivers does not É. in practice a sufficient means for the
identification and citation before a Magistrate of any member of their
body who now and then happens to disgrace it by extortion and
insolence. The proposed Certificate will ensure that desirable object.
Only, because the study of the Cabman's features, and the comparison
of them with a written description, would take some time, that
document had better be accompanied with a carte de visite.
"8. No driver to be deemed plying for hire unless standing upon some place
authorisod by the Police Commissioner.”
This article, to be duly appreciated, must be considered in connection
with the next:-
“4. That all special agreements between hirers and drivers be binding on both
parties.”
A Railway Station is jº. property, and Cabs are authorised to
stand there by the Railway Company, and not by the Commissioner of
Police. A driver not, deemed plying for hire might pick and choose
his fares. If any special agreement which he might make with a hirer
were binding on both parties, he would have to be content with any
remuneration which a railway traveller had engaged to give him,
however inadequate and calculated on a mistake as to distance.
“5. That the distance of four miles from Charing Cross be measured by the road
instead of the radius.”
In that case the Cabman would be enabled to display his honesty by
always going the shortest way.
“6, 7, 8. That children be charged for as upon railways. That all packages be
º 2d. each. That all dogs carried in or outside a cab be charged at the rate of
d. each.”
At present an inſant, a cigar-case, and a terrier, are so many objects
which would afford a Cabman merely an arbitrary pretext for asking
sixpence each;, altogether eighteen-pence. The proposed enactment
would legalise the change and exempt it from the stigma of ridiculous
extortion.
‘‘9. That any driver proving his case before a Magistrate, shall receive compen-
sation for himself and witnesses."
. An admirable arrangement ſor proving the Cabman's case under any
circumstances whatcver.
“10. 11. 12. That every driver shall receive notice of the unfitness of his cab or
horse for public work before becoming liable to prosecution. That none but hirers
be empowered to prosecute in any dispute between themselves and owners. That
a cheap power of appeal be granted from magisterial decisions.”
The foregoing provisions are so many devices for facilitating the legal
settlement of disputes between Cabmen and hirers. This, in particular,
is much impeded by those lawyers whom prosecutors now generally em.
ploy instead of conducting their own cases against defendant Cabmen.
“13. That whef any hirer refuses to pay his fare or to make compensation for
any damage to a cab, the driver to have the power to compel him to go to the
nearest station-house, where he shall deposit the amount of such fare, or give
security, previous to going before a Magistrate.”
The last regulation, if adopted, would have the , happy effect of
preventing, the imposition which is too often practised on Cabinen by
persons calling themselves gentlemen, who happen to be in haste to
catch a train. Altogether, the proposed improvements of the Hackney
Carriage Act, above-quoted, will, if effected, obviously tend to the comfort
and accommodation of a class of men for whom the community ought
to exist, and will, at least, set some limit to the insolence and imposi-
#.ºil. Cabmen have too generally to put up with on the part of the
uſolic.
REAL ROGUES AND SHAM REFORMERS.
WHAT is reformation? Can a thief when shut up in a prison, where
he cannot steal, really give a proof that he is a reſormed man, and is
proof against temptation to go and pick a pocket? We see gaol-birds
set at liberty before their sentences are out, and if we ask the reason
we are told it's their “good conduct.” But so far as thieving goes,
how can any thief act wrong in a gaol, where he has no chance of thiev.
ing? To say he is reformed is to jump to a conclusion which cannot,
it is clear, be logically reached. You might as well cage up a magpie
and say he is reformed, because, being so confined, he has not stolen
anything. How BILL SYKEs must chuckle as he takes his ticket of leave
to think that he is viewed as a really reformed character P : What a
pleasure it must be to a pickpocket in quod to think that by his absti-
nence from thieving while in prison he may beget the fond belief that
he is to be trusted . To test whether a rogue be in reality reformed
he ought to be so placed that he may give vent to his roguery; an
until there be steps taken somehow to provide such tests, we shall put
very little faith in the ed reformations, for which we have to
thank our Ticket-of-leave system, and which increase our risk of being
robbed and murdered in the streets.
DENOMINATIONAL DISTINCTIONS.
The Rev. JAMEs CRONshAw writes to SIR. J. KAY Shuttleworth
to ask whether it would be better to have “Denominational,” or
“Mixed”. Sewing Schools in Manchester. What next in the way
of Sectarian classification? Regiments, perhaps, ſormed each of
a peculiar sect; denominational corps. There is a precedent, for it in
the Cameronians. We might have ºff. as well; Methodist
Brigades, Baptist Battalions, General and Particular, Light and Heavy
independent Dragoons, Supra and Infra:Lapsarian Calvinist Lancers,
Unitarian Hussars, Roman Catholic Artillery, Evangelical Engineers,
and Puseyite Sappers and Miners. To these might be added an Eben-
ezer Squadron, and Little Bethel and Salem Divisions. There would
be small difficulty in organising denominational troops of all, kinds,
except one, a force derived from the Society of Friends: no denomi-
nation but the Quakers objecting to destroy their fellow men. If there

Denominational Prisons, where convicts might pick oakum exclusively
with brethren of their special denomination, instead of performing hard
labour, as they do now, under the general denomination of rogue; for
there are, unfortunately, too many rogues of all denominations.

“What's o'clock, you Scamp f Just struck One.”
FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUILDING.
ANOTHER street of palace-domes
Is added to the outward splendour
Of Paris, rivalling old Rome's
For which Rome freedom did surrender.
Alas, how London lags behind |
Cry some, our humble structures scorning;
But here a man may speak his mind,
And Punch tells truth without a warning.
True, Paris is the finest place
In Europe and the world, to look at;
At none folks play with truer grace,
None do they better dance and cook al.
In most fine arts they much excel;
No finery than theirs is finer:
But we in greater freedom dwell,
Though our magnificence is minor.
While France in building leads the way,
Behold, by general resolution,
What homage Greece unites to pay
The fabric of our Constitution.
That edifice, which praise has won
From such an unexpected quarter,
We Britons would exchange for none
The proudest pile of stone and mortar.
Great Theatrical Sensation.
(A Prophecy.)
The French version of the Battle or Waterloo is pro-
duced at Drury Lane, and meets, with the greatest
success. We need not say it is brought out as a burlesque,
and is received throughout with shouts of laughter. The
dénoiment, in which the French win the battle, is pro-
nounced to be one of the greatest bits of ſun since the
days of Mother Goose.

A NICE FOOTMAN FOR A SMALL PARTY |
How we wish that we had lots of money and were living in Bengal!
Wouldn't we just rush, to Raneemoody Lane and beg to see the
gentleman who puts this notice in the Hurkaroo a short while
since :
FOR SALE, at No. 3, Raneemoody Lane,
AN Enormous ORANGOUTANG, (or commonly called a Man of the
Woods,) brought from “Java." This animal is quite tame, and has been taught
to dance, play on a Bamboo Flute many savage tunes, also many wonderful tricks
with Bamboos, and plays games of all kinds to perfection, dressed in savage cos-
tume, and can wait at the Table, and is also able to dress gentlemen and attend to
them at the Toilet.
What a charming creature! Oh, how we long to have him ' What
a nice surprise we should provide for our old uncle, when he next
comes to dine with us, by dressing up this monkey in a footman's
livery and getting him to come in with the sºup and wait at table!
How delightful it would be too, when dressing for a party, to have this
hairy Walet to attend us at the toilet ! Wouldn't he just curl our hair
and brush our clothes for us—and then probably proceed to tear them
all to bits and throw the brushes through the looking-glass, or perhaps
into the street.
MAGNI EST VERITAS.
OUR fair friend the Reading Girl (it may not be generally known that
what she is reading so intently is Punch, though perhaps it is obvious that
anythingles absorbing would have failed to ſix even a statue’s attention
while amillion of people were crowding round her) has actually got into
Chancery. Somebody who calls himself a cousin of HER MAJESTY, but
who has followed the modest occupation of assistant to photographers,
has been surreptitiously translating her es into piratical pictures.
Wood, however, comes to the rescue of M. and Vice-Chancelloit
Woon has stopped the unlawful process, at the suit of the young lady's
next friend and guardian,” MR. NottAGE. As a girl of that age
can't be too *. what Company, she keeps, we are glad to see
that she is to keep to the Stereoscopic Company. Mr. Punch takes so
much interest in her as his most Constant Reader, that he rejoices at
her now being a lesson not only to sculptors but to pirates.
ANOTHER OF OUR BULWARKS GOlNG.
What is the use of a jury? it may possibly be asked, when nearly
every week one sees that the verdict of a jury, by appeal to the Home
ScCretary, has been set aside. We used to boast that trial | Jury was
one of the chief buiwarks of the British Constitution; but while Home
Secretaries pooh-pool, our juries as they do, we think that such a bul-
wark is at best a rather shaky one. Serving on a jury is not a pleasant
occupation, and is quite a waste of time when verdicts are ignored as
they recently have been. If ſurther evidence he ſurnished, to prove the
innocence of a prisoner, the new trial should take place before the jury
who ſound guilty: so that they, if they think proper, may themselves
reverse their verdict. Trial by Sir GeoRGE GREY is not trial by a jury:
and it is by jury-trial that all persons who are charged with being felous
should be tried. We Britous oſtcn boast about our “twelve men in a
box”: but while their decisions are looh-poohed by higher powers,
twelve men in an omnibus might talk about the case, and their verdict
in the matter would do every whit as well.
EXTRAORDIN AIRY EXHIBITION.
The Dividend of three per cent. that has just been declared by the
Crystal Palace Company, making not less than eight percent. for the en-
tire ſº will shortly be exhibited at Sydenhan. The court, selected to
display it, will be ille Alhambra, as being the best adapted to the
marvellous nature of the exhibition. MR. Bowley, the sleepless secre-
tary, says it will be the greatest novelly ever yet shown within the
walls of Penge Palace. He doubts whether BioNDIN ever would be
able to mount as high as this Dividend in safety, or without running
imminent risk of failing half way in the perilous ascent...There will be
an additional attraction about this extraordinary exhibition consisting
in the fact that very few shareholders will believe it until they see it.
The thousands that will be thus attracted by curiosity to the spot, it
will be impossible to calculate. We only hope, for the benefit of an
institution which is most admirably conducted, and which should be a
source of honest pride to the country that has produced it, that a like
Exhibition may be repeated for many lustres to come, and that the
shareholders may take a deeper interest in it every year.

THE NAME OF THE BOULEWARD.
To Mr. Punch.
“SIR, -
“ConsiderABLE and lamentable misapprehension haying been
found to exist in reference to the name of the new and beautiful Boule-
vard, so touchingly inaugurated by his IMPERIAL MAJESTY, on Sunday
week, I invite you to offer to the English people the following correct
version of the EMPEROR's speech on that occasion. I transmit, this
document to}; who are above all suspicion, as since that little
affair of the Morning Chronicle, the British papers have become unfor-
tunately sensitive. - - - -
“Receive the assurances of my most distinguished consideration,
“DROUYN DE Lhuys.
“Paris, Dec. 16th.” “Minister for Foreign Affairs.”
THE EMPEROR’s SPEECH.
In resolving to dedicate this new and noble Boulevard to the memor
of PRINCE Eugh NE, I have been actuated by considerations which will
recommend themselves to the heart of every Frenchman.
It has been circulated that I had intended our new Boulevard should
bear the name of a PRINCE EUGENE who was a member of my own
family, and whose image for that reason, as well as for more obvious
ones, must be dear to the people of France.
This is a total and complete error.
I inscribe upon this beautiful Boulevard the name of PRINCE EUGENE;
but it is the name of one who has otherwise made his mark upon French
1story.
The PRINCE EugèNE of our new thoroughfare was born in the year
1663, and after a military apprenticeship passed in services against the
Turks, was sent by the EMPEROR LEopold. THE FIRST with an army
into Italy. A French army happened also to be in Italy, for such things
will º and PRINCE EUGENE_defeated our generals in July and
September 170i, and in February 1702 took prisoner our celebrated
Winoi. In 1704, Prince fugine gained the Battie offilenheim (an
English commander named MARLBoRough rendering him some slight
co-operation), and subsequently the Prince won the Battle of Savoy,
and compelled the French to evacuate Italy, a course, therefore, on
their part, for which there is precedent. He §btained a variety of other
successes over the flag of France, and was fighting us on the Rhine,
another suggestive remembrance, so late as 1734, but died covered with
glory two years later.
I have stated these facts because the history of PRINCE EugèNE has
been, for reasons, more carefully preserved and studied by our affec-
tionate neighbours across the Channel than by ourselves, and it may
not be so familiar to all of you as the deeds of commanders who have
fled from before the French banners. For the same reason, and because
I do not find that our own memoirs do sufficient justice to the personal
Fº of the Prince (a statue by one of our noblest sculptors shall
shortly redress that injury), I will translate to you a few lines from a
classic work of ex”.aordinary repute among our neighbours, and called
the Spectator. - -
The editor oſ hat work had beheld PRINCE EugèNE when on a visit
to London, and a celebrated English statesman º friend of the editor)
SIR. Roger DE CoverLEY, had been enchanted with him, and declare
him “a greater man than ScANDERBEG.” The Spectator says, “The
Prince is of that stature which makes a man most easily become all
parts of exercise: has height to be graceful on occasions of state and
ceremony, and no less adapted for agility and dispatch; his aspect is
erect and composed, his eye lively and thoughtful, yet rather vigilant
than sparkling.”
The English, who have few heroes, make the most of those few, and
are never tired of singing, their praises and christening linendrapers'
shops after them. #. istinguished ByRoN must drag in the name of
the Prince into a tale,
“CoMoURGI, he whose closing scene
Adorned the triumph of EUGENE,”
And the remarkable SouTHEy, in a foolish poem tending to disgust
mankind with the legitimate glories of war, says–
“Great praise the DUKE of MARLBoRough won,
And our good PRINCE EUGENE."
Now it will be asked why I have chosen to dwell upon the military
exploits and fame of a Prince whose laurels were gained at the expense
of our own. -
I reply, because a Napoleonic Idea has been carried out.
Blenheim is avenged.
PRINCE EugèNE won Blenheim, but what follows P
PRINCE EUGjºn E was the PRINCE OF SAvoy.
Savoy is a Province of France.
To the memory therefore of PRINCE EugkNE, of France and Savoy,
I dedicate this beautiful Boulevard.
The EMPEROR then retired amid the cheers of the multitudes, the
bands playing “Malbrook.”

success, a series of ſº. at Paris. A celebrated Critic says,
“Her singing is full of so much lightness and sweetness, that the

PRACTICAL FAITH OR FRENZYP
We should like to have the opinion of the British Judges and the
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons on the question of the sanity or
insanity of a convict whose case is subjoined. The man's name is MIRA-
PEIN; a short time since he received sentence of death for two murders
committed at Sgualada in Spain. Against this judgment the prisoner's
counsel appealed, on the ground that his client had acted under the
influence of monomania. The case having been referred to the Academy
of Sciences, the decision of the referees was that the prisoner had com.
mitted the crimes of which he had been found guilty while,labouring
under a religious homicidal monomania, and was not responsible for his
actions. The newspaper paragraph whence the foregoing particulars
are derived, thus ... the facts on which the conclusion of the man's
insanity was founded:–
“From the statement of the public prosecutor, it ap that the prisoner had
long been tormented with apprehensions that he should die in mortal sin, for want
of the usual religious ceremonies before his death; but having reflected that con-
demned criminals were always prepared to die as Christians, he resolved to secure
to himself the same advantage. He i.º. purchased a knife, and stabbed one
of his friends at a coffee-house. He then took to flight, but fearing that the wound
he had given might not prove fatal, he resolved to commit another murder; and after
having realised his purpose on the person of a young man whom he met in the
street, he delivered himself up to the police. e Court has now annulled the
Fº sentence, and ord the prisoner to be confined to a lunatic asylum
or life."
Where was the monomania? We think HERMAJesty's Judges would
say that, in doing the above-mentioned murders, for the reasons above
stated, Minºrs knew very well what he was about. The Faculty,
we suppose, would ...' agree that, in committing those acts
he proceeded upon a perfectly logical deduction from his premises. If
he was mad, then, his madness lurked in the belief of those premises.
But the Spanish Academy of Sciences should not have called it a mono-
mania. Is it not, if a mania, a mania in which some—how many ?—
170,000,000 human beings—is not that the number?—are supposed to
belºve? It would please us to ask CARDINAL WISEMAN and
Westbury, C.; Fathen Newman and Dr. Forbes WINslow; DR.
MANNING and Dr. Tuke, to dine with us at the Star and Garter at
Richmond, and argue out this interesting case of orthodox Romanism
or raving madness, over a sufficiency of claret after dinner.
OUR OFFENCE TO THE YANKEES.
WHILE wrath distorts thy visage lank and haggard,
by grin at me, and glare with evil eye?
Why, in the strain of a malignant blackguard,
J on AthAN, threaten and revile me—why?
Why so vindictive is your roaring flood
Of ſoul abuse? What have I done, that makes
You keep declaring that you’ll have my blood,
More venomous in spite than maddened snakes?

You were hard pressed in battle for the right,

A SECURE ASYLUM AT STRATFORD."
IF you want a safe retreat from thieves and garotters, seek it in
Warwickshire. The neighbourhood of Stratford is an Arcadia in which
the shepherds are innocent of sheep-stealing. So great an offence as
that is impossible where a respectable labourer gets committed for trial
as a criminal on a very doubtful charge of having stolen one quart of
milk, value \d. This assertion of the sacredness of property was pro-
claimed at the Stratford Petty Sessions, a few weeks since, when,
according to a local paper, present SIR ROBERT N. C. HAMILTON,
BART., K. C. B., and J. CAVE JONES, Esq., Thomas BECK, albeit a
swain of good repute in his native village, was accused of having per-
petrated the crime above-named at the expense of MR. RoberT Rºa.
toN, farmer, of Eatington. It appeared that the milk had been given
to the man by MR. RIGHTON's maid-servant; but her master withdrew
the charge against her, and “the lass was dismissed after having been
duly icoſured.” As tº the prisoner, BECK :—
“Defendant pleaded not guilty, so he was committed to take his trial at Warwick
in January next, but MR. ARCH, farmer of Eatington, kindly became bail for him.”
It is much to be apprehended that the laxity of a British jury may
possibly grant this culprit an acquittal, or that even if they find him
guilty of stealing all that milk, his stipendiary judge will sentence him
to some punishment short of penal servitude. A ë. of Justice may
decline to back the Warwickshire Justices in enforcing against the
alleged purloiner of this jug of milk the principle of jug for jug. Those
same worthy Magistrates will perhaps hear more about this jug of milk
likely to gratify them. Five months hence, doubtless, all the nightin-
ales in the surrounding groves will unite in serenading them with
‘jug, jug, jug.” The Justices of Warwickshire seem not to have
departed from the traditions of their predecessors, who sat to SHAK-
SPEARE for portraits which we need not name. Marry, masters, these
be no milksops. Long life to them; and at its conclusion may they
be translated to the skies and erected into a constellation, to be called
Astraea in the Milky Way.

QUESTIONABLE CHARITY.
SoME people have singular ideas of what is charity. For instance,
look at this advertisement:—
THE LANCASHIRE DISTRESS.
THE Undermentioned GROCERS, at Hartlepool, have agreed perma-
nently to discontinue the practice of giving Christmas Boxes to their Custºmers ;
and, in lieu thereof, to contribute an equivalent in money, to the Fund for the
Relief of Distress in Lancashire. (Here follow the Signatures.)
Such charity as this is somewhat in the way of robbing PETER to pay
PAUL. Christmas-boxes may or may not be objectionable, but the Lan:
cashire distress is no excuse for getting rid of them. . If the grocers of
Hartlepool mean really what they say, and wish to give the full “equi-
valent” of their yearly Christmas presents, they ought to calculate the
probable duration of their lives, and how much each of them would pay
away in Christmas-boxes in all the years they have to live. The total
thus summed up should of course be the amount of their subscription
to the fund, else by ridding themselves “permanently” of an expensive
custom they will actually profit by the Lancashire distress.
CONWICT CRANIOLOGY.
IN the description of penal servitude at Portland, given the other day
in the Times, particular mention was made of the conformation of the
convict’s heads as conspicuously different from that of ordinary people's.
The generality of the rogues were described as characterised by low
retreating foreheads. Now, is it or is it not a fact, that persons whose
brains are deficient in certain regions are practically found to be stupid,
brutal, and vicious? Because iſ that is so, when once such, persons
have given you a justification for .# them under lock and key, and
ou have got them safe, you had better keep them there. , Till when :

THE MORAL OF THE WORKHOUSE.
IF reason and justice presided over our penal arrangements, and if it
is just to punish poverty as crime, still one would think that as com-
pared with felony, destitution would be considered and treated as the
minor offence. Accordingly, the transition from the workhouse to the
gaol may be supposed to be of a nature similar to that which is described
in the popular saying, “out of the ºft. into the fire.” How far
this supposition is from being correct, will appear from numerous facts,
amongst which may be mentioned the expressions of gratitude which
were lately, addressed to a learned Judge by certain wretches for pro-
nouncing the doom which was to transfer them from the position of
paupers to that of criminals. MR. Justice Keogh, the other day,
W. sentence upon two women, inmates of the South Dublin Union
orkhouse, ANNE DUFFY and fin CAREy, who pleaded “Guilty”
to the charge of setting fire to that benevolent institution. According
to the Times correspondent:—
“The prisoners were delighted, and immediately said, “Thank your Lordship,
we have got out of hell, at all events.”

Seventeen male paupers were then brought up for the same offence, and were
sentenced to the same punishment. Several of them cried out, ‘Thank you, my
Lord and gentlemen of the jury, we have got out of a house of persecution.”
The thankiulness with which the paupers received a sentence of penal
servitude may suggest the thought that the reverse of the saying above
uoted would prºperly represent the exchange of quarters which awaited
them, But the frying-pan as compared with the fire is much less com-
fortable than the Model Prison in proportion to the Union. Workhouse.
The ſormer of those two establishments relatively to the latter is con-
siderably milder than Purgatory may be imagined to be, in contrast with
the other place which the prisoners mentioned. Quod, in comparison
with the Abode of Want, is quite a tolerable sort of Limbo. hat is
the moral of this arrangement, in the apprehension of the classes who
have to live by their own exertions? Whatever you do, keep out of the
Workhouse. Garotte anybody rather than apply to the Union.
PITY A POOR BRIDGE,
WE really wish that MR, BABBAGE would at his leisure, calculate
what wealth is yearly wasted by the London Bridge blockades, which
in spite of the police are growing every day more frequent. Time, we
know, is money; and the amount j. is thus spent would annually
serve to pay the taxes of the nation, besides affording Mr. Punch a
handsome pension for the services which he has done the state. Every
block on London Bridge, and there are fifty every day, detains ſur
several minutes several hundred waggons, omnibuses, drays, carts,
carriages, and cabs. What amount per minute is consumed by Keeping
stationary this locomotive plant, we leave to MR. BABBAGE at his
leisure to determine; and he is likewise free to calculate how many
trains are missed by means of these blockades, and how many a good
dinner is, by being, thus kept waiting, annually spoiled. Moreover,
besides the foss of time, there is the loss of temper which these stop-
pages occasion; and in considering the injury they cause to the coin-
munity, the harm they do in this way must be kept in mind. . On this
account as well as for mere monetary reasons, the Bridge should be
relieved as much as may be from the traffic which now greatly over-
burthens it. . - -
We, think its neighbour, Southwark Bridge might assist towards
its relief; but Southwark Bridge is stopped up by a penny toll, which
virtually prevents its doing any good io anybody. It is clear that
public * should widely be awakened to pity the condition of
poor, ill-used London Bridge. It has long been the most put upon
of all our public thoroughfares, and if we don’t take better care of it,
the poor ". certainly will break down under the extraordinary
pressure that is laid on it. The case is one of real distress, as any one
who daily has to cross the bridge can testify; and if, despite its coal-
tax and its hundred other means of revenue, the City be too poor to
open Southwark Bridge, or find some other way to diminish, the vast
traffic which oppresses its poor neighbour, a London Bridge Relief Fund
must in charity be opened, and steps be taken to excite for it the bumps
of the benevolent.

I
THE SONG OF THE GAROTTER.
II, meet me by moon-
light alone,
Af then I will give
you the hug,
With my arm round
| your neck tightly
roWll,
1’m as up to the work
as a Thug.
Behind you I softly
* , will creep,
And, taking you q
unawares, ..
On my ń. like a
tºº."
If I happen to choke
you, who cares?
uite
I’m out with a ticket
of leave, ...
Which, by ſº the
chaplain I got,
And I’m free tº
maim, murder and
thieve,
For a cove he must
live, must he
not?
So meet me by moonlight alone,
Kind stranger, I beg and entreat,
And I’ll make all your money my own,
And leave you half dead in the street.
THE BRAHMINY BULL AND HIS DRIVER,
A FABLE FOR JOHN BULL AND His DITTO.
Founded on that Triumph of Military Tailoring, the cutting down of the
Indian war expenses by four millions.
THERE once was a Brahminy Bull,
With a mighty big waggon to pull,
Wherein for a load,
Mother Company stowed
Her protégés—such a coach full?
The roads they were heavy as lead;
The sun it was hot over-head;
And poor Brahminy Bull
With his thund'ring coach-full,
Groamed “Another half-mile, and I’m dead l’”
Twere as well he had cried to the stones,
Lash and laughter replied to his moans,
Till he felt fit to pitch
The concern in the ditch,
Whatever the cost to his bones |
Mother Country who chanced to come by,
Overheard the poor Brahminy's cry;
n a rage up she ran
To the cruelty-van,
And first blew up its drivers sky-high.
Then she flew at them like a she-dragon,
And bundled them out of the waggon,
And quite red in the face,
Took the box in their place,
And bade the Bull merrily drag on 1
“Now you’ve nothing at all of a load,
And I’m sure it’s an excellent road;
So all you’ve to do,
Is to labour ſor two,
In return for the ease I’ve bestowed.”
The Bull gave a tug and a strain,
But unmoved still the drag did remain:
... Marm,”, quoth Bull, looking blue,
“You’ve kicked then down, it's true,
But you’ve put on their luggage again.
“A like load, sure, was never laid tire on:—
and powder, and heaps of old iron,
Swords and bayonets and guns,
By hundreds of tons—
Such rubbish were best flung the fire on!”
Hold! hold!” Mother Country replied—
“”Tis as . protector I ride;
All this cargo of arms
ls to guard you from harms
That surround you on every side.”
Quoth the Bull, “Better danger to meet,
Than to 'scape it be worked off your feet;
So no longer I’ll drag
...All that soldierly swag,
*Till I fall in the collar, dead-beat.”
Then he coaxed-"only lighten my load,
And see how I'll bowl o'er the road;
You’ll say, never Bull
For a long and strong pull
Such bottom and stamina showed.
“You say you’re my friend; act as sich :
And if ever you get in a hitch,
Pra'ps poor Brahminy Bull
May be destined to pull
Old John BULL’s lusty self from the ditch.”
The Bull paused: Mother Country reflected:
“h'ith this load, º can't be expected:
If we can’t go ahead.
I shall soon be baked dead,
And Bull by the Vultures dissected.
So here goes.”—Word and blow ! On the road
Was flung over the terrible load,
And each thew of the Bull
Seemed to grow fresh and full,
As the war-rubbish round him was strowed.
And off like Express on the rail,
With a bellow and cock of his tail,
Did the Brahminy scour,
Twenty mile to the hour,
Till the pace made his driver turn pale !
MORAL.
Suppose, English Bull, some fine morning,
From Brahminy Bull you take warning,
Tell your Drivers you’re blowed,
If you’ll still drag the load,
Which so long your broad back’s been adorning.
On such hints they are certain to frown,
Talk of risk to your old coach—The Crown,
Never heed that reproach—
Say you’ll look to the Coach,
Norsue them in the case of break-down.
Too ºf and too hard you've been punished,
Till with dead-weight you’re nearly finished,
Which dead-weight, without ceasing,
Has increased, is increasing,
And, decidcdly, should be diminished.
MEDIAEWAL AND MODERN DOCTORS.
THE subjoined announcement has appeared in the daily papers:—
“THE SPIRITUAL PEERAGE.-The ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY and the ARch-
Bishop of York will take their seats in the House of Lords at the commencement
of the next Session of Parliament in virtue of their respective sees. DEAN ELLIcott,
the new Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, will remain without a seat, under the
Manchester Bishoprics Act, until another see becomes vacant."
The Mediaeval Church boasted of her Angelic and Seraphic Doctors.
Her British substitute and successor has doubtless as much cause to
glory in her doctors of .# DR. LoNGLEY of Canterbury and DR.
Thomson of York are as good as THOMAS AQUINAs and DUN's Scotus.
DR.ELLIcott, the new Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, perhaps can
hardly be properly called a Seraphic or Angelic Doctor just yet, because
at present he remains without a seat, in which predicament he is mani-
festly rather qualified to be entitled the Cherubic Doctor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REMARKABLY
“SENSATION " SUICIDES.
“I say, Punch, old cock, what d'ye mean by ...; into the Sen-
a
sation Sights and Supper-rooms, which have sprung up lately to delight
the British public. f
the national taste, and debase all those who go to them. Of course
everybody twigs that you only write in fun, and nebody believes that
you mean really to be serious. Your business is to .# us jokes and
not to preach us sermons; and I’ll tell you what, old boy, your sale
will soon fall off if you turn moralist and tract-monger. When I ask
for Punch, I want something smart and spicy, and if you go on preaching
I shall give up buying you, and shall patronise the Record.
“Well now, just look here. I’m a young chap about town, and don't
know where to spend my evenings. I don’t care much for theatres,
because I can’t afford the stalls, and the pit is awful crampy, Besides,
the pieces have such runs, that it’s only once a year or so that one can
see a new one. And then one ain't allowed to smoke, and that’s an
awful nuisance. So I just drop in at EASTON's or the Gallopbury Hall,
or have a quiet pipe and glass of grog at the Alarma. Here one hears
a decent song,” and one sees some comic acting, and one can stretch
one's legs and talk and socially enjoy oneself. Then later in the evening,
when one’s getting a bit sleepy, }. acrobats come in and wake a fellow
up with their sensation tricks and tumblings; for of course, you know,
a fellow can’t well keep his eyes shut when he has the chance of seeing
a chap's neck broken.
“Now, old cock, you call this last a low and brutal pleasure, and you
say that coves who like it would enjoy to see a bull-fight or a gladiator
combat. Well, I dare say that they would; I know I should myself;
but as these foreign pastimes ain't allowed in England, we must make
the most of the sensation sights that are. Now I hear it said of certain
of our acrobats, that their feats must most inevitably end some day in
death, and as really it can’t matter much whether a chap's spifflicated
one day or the next, I would suggest to the proprietors of our sensation
* And sometimes the reverse.-Punch.
t’s all bosh, you know, your saying hº

IDEA
supper-rooms, that doubtless they might do a tidy stroke of business by
engaging a performer to break his neck in public on such and such an
evening, which should duly be announced. Such a notice would, I
doubt not, prove enormously attractive; and if by any accident the
acrobat escaped, and only smashed a leg or so, instead of breaking his
backbone or dashing out his brains, as he had been announced to do,
the spirited proprietor might return the entrance money, or issue
tickets for the suicide which should take place some other night. As
the feat would be announced for the finale of the evening, the proprietor
of course would sack a handsome profit by the extra pints of beer and
goes of grog he would have served, through his having a crammed
room; and the spectators, I dare say, would not grumble very much, if
they were to see a ſellow crippled, say, for life, although he disappointed
them by not breaking his ..
“Trusting the Alarma coves will act on my suggestion, and promising
my patronage the evening when they do so, believe me, my bo-o-o-oy,
“Yours, all serene,
“JACK RATTLER.”
“P.S. The Alarma had best be quick about it, for I see our blessed
Magistrates are talking about stopping all these dangerous perform-
ances, and shutting the sensation shops where they are allowed. Just
as iſ a fellow hadn't a right to risk his life in the earning of his living !
If he kills himself, it’s his look out, and no affair of ours. And besides,
you know, he’s paid uncommon well to do it.”
A Pardonable Mistake.
The young “Swells” of the New Cut are delighted with MR.
BoucicaulT's announcement.
“Dion's one of the right sort,” said CLYFAKER to the NobbLER.
“Ashley's is to be open for nothin', for look here, he calls the front of
his theater the order-toriam.”
