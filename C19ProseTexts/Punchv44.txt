RE
REALLY, MR. PUNCH ”-said FATHER NILE.
“And really, FATHER Nile,” said Mr. PUNCH, “and now what 's the matter with you, you old Myth and
Mystery. Light another pipe, and be sociable. Are you smoking tomboc ? If so, give it an extra wash and
squeeze in your own river; for it's strong, and makes you surly, and we won't have Surley Hall on the Nile.”
“ You make me laugh,” said FATHER NILE, “ but you are uncommonly familiar.”
“ Familiar, but by no means vulgar," returned Mr. Punch, lighting his cigar with a dry reed. “ Nobody
can say I'm vulgar. I have all the exquisite ease of society that is too high to care what anybody thinks. And so we
know all about you at last. Do you know that you remind me of a sensation novel ; when the secret ’s out there's
nothing in it?"
Come, I won't be talked to like that,” said the Nile. “I am a most respectable old river, and if I am not
what I was, that is not my fault. Six bundred and thirty years before your era, there was a Milesian factory upon
my Bolbitic branch.”
“ Bother your Bolbitic branch," said Mr. PUNCH. “Do you consider it a credit to have been patronised by
the Irish of the Future ?"
“I drowned CLEOPATRA's first husband in Forty-Seven."
“ If you had submerged the entire ménage, the world would have lost a bad woman and a good play.”
“ Then PROBUS, who conquered FLORIAN"
“I never could do that, but then I hate all French books, except RABELAIS.”
“He improved my navigation—"
“ In otio et negotio Probus, just like me,” said Mr. Punca.
“ Didn't I defeat the Fifth Crusade, by an overwhelming majority ? ” said Father NILE, indignantly.
" Who's a denying on it?" responded MR. PUNCH. “What an edgey old man you are—there's no talking
Don't I hold you in all reverence ? Honor est a Nilo—do you remember that, your honour ?”
The placable old creature recovered his equanimity, and said, smiling, “At my time of life we are, perhaps, too
apt to believe that we are not treated with due respect."
“ Certainly, there's no fool like an old fool," answered the incorrigible MR. PUNCH. “But I tell you I have
the utmost veneration for you. Don't I remember what JUVENAL, whom I strongly resemble in all his few good qualities,
said about your mouths-rari quippe boni—and the gates of Thebes ? "

PREFACE.
“ He didn't mean my Thebes, MR. PUNCH."
“I know that, you quarrelsome old watering-pot. He meant Thebes in Bæotia, where a good many of my
literary friends come from. Well, are you not much obliged to my Anglo-Indian friends, CAPTAIN SPEKE and CAPTAIN
Grant, for inventing you, and bringing you up into fashion again, and getting you talked about by Sir RODERICK
MURCHISON, in the presence of the most distinguished and intellectual Swells of the Metropolis of the World ?”
“Do you mean Alexandria ? " said Father Nile, languidly.
“ Alexandria be-obliterated! No, I won't say that, because it gave my friend CHARLES KINGSLEY the scene for
Hypatia. Alexandria, indeed! Why, one of your own hippopotamusses could tell you better, if it corresponds with its
cousins in the Regent's Park. I mean London, Mr. Nilus, the Capital of the Universe."
“ Never heard of it, and please don't scold me," said FATHER NILE, pretending to be affected.
Come, come," said Mr. PUNCH, " that won't do with me. Is that a crocodile I see before me? TOBY, look
out, or that animal 'll be a-biting on you."
“Ha! ha! ha!" roared FATHER NILb (giving his urn such an extra shake that the man at the Nilometer
at Cairo ran out bellowing that the inundation had come without notice, for which indiscretion he was, we are happy
to say, well bastinadoed), " there's no selling you, Mr. Punch."
My publishers could tell you another story,” said Mr. Punch, modestly, "and could inform you that I am
sold wherever the English language, or even what, in America and Belgravia, is supposed to be the English lan-
guage, is spoken."
“ Done this time, however," said FATHER Nile, radiantly. "I know all about you, and how the nations
worship you, and your dog Toby, who reminds me of Anubis- latrator Anubis, as Ovid says.
“ The Dog of the Nile. I'm,” said Mr. Punon. "Don't growl, TOBY, Sir, the elderly gentleman means
to be complimentary, and doesn't know that you have the entrée of the British Museum, and have seen Anubis.”
“ I heard,” said FATHER NILE, " that the very first sight which the Prince of your country showed to his
beautiful bride, on the day of her arrival, was Yourself, crowned, like a priest, with flowers.”
"We don't crown our priests, except sometimes with powdered wigs,” said MR. PUNCH, “but on other
points you are accurately informed; and though I don't care a piastre for Alexandria, I value the smile I received on
that day from ALEXANDRA at the price of the Pyramids."
“ You deserved it," said the Aged River.
“ Without self-conceit, I believe that I did," said Mr. Punch.
“ You resemble Me,” said the Nile. “ Year after year I send forth, for joy, and for comfort, and for fertilising,
my magnificent Volume-2"
“ So do I," said Mr. Puncı, " and here is my
Forty-Fourty Volume."

“He stood on the bridge ot midnight,
mounted the stone coping, and beheld the
river below him, rushing, bubbling, hurry-
ing on its way. He drew from his velveteen
jacket pocket in succession the bottle of
poison, the revolver, and the long bowie-
knife, for he had resolved to shuple of this
mortal coil, and to quit the scene of his many
unmerited afflictions. Did no still small
voice arrest bim in his fierce resolve, and
bid him live and retrieve his errors, saying
To err is human, to forgive divine. Alas, who
shall say? He waited in his fell determina-
tion until a huge barge, then before the
towers of the Archbishop's Palace, where
the proud priest slumbered in purple and
fine linen, nothing heeding the wretched
outcast, should glide beneath him, to make
assurance doubly sure. Dashed against her
side, he thought, the waves will receive me
lifeless. Then with one wild cry the wretched
man drove the dagger into his bosom,
swallowed the fatal poison, discharged the
pistol at his head, and sprung into the
gloomy abyss. But his time was not yet

IRISH TEMPERANCE OF A YANKEE.
The subjoined statement, extracted from the American
Correspondence of the Times, is commended to the attention
of the United Kingdom Alliance :-
“One of the most rabid of American declaimers against the British
Government and people, whose morbid vanity it is not necessary to
feed by the mention of his name, was elected, a few days ago, a
member of an Irish temperance society in this city."
And this rascal, on the strength of unſermented liquors,
launched out into the quasi-drunken rant below quoted :-
"In acknowledging the distinction conferred upon him, he actually
lectured his Irish friends upon the absurdity of their peaceable pro-
pensities. * You must,' he said, have no more bloodless revolutions.
DANIEL O'CONNELL made a great mistake. Moral suasion won't do with
Englishmen. Keep on your bayonets, boys; old Ireland shall be free.''
The members of the Society for the Suppression of Pub-
lic-houses are invited to consider whether fustian more
villanous tlıan the foregoing was ever yelped forth amid the
reek of gin, or hiccupped out amid the fumes of brandy-
and-water? Could the strongest ale, or even the vilest
swipes, inspire a maudlin scoundrel with more truculent
drivel! This precious example of the effects of total
abstinence indeed received a suitable honour in being
elected a member of an Irish Temperance Society. His
speech was an effusion of truly Irish temperance, which is
indistinguishable from the worst results of whiskey.
Consideration of such a fact as this fellow should induce
the agitators for Permissive Maine Law Legislation to
dissolve their conspiracy to rob a poor man of his beer.

THE HAIR AND MANY FRIENDS.
AMONG other inventions to beautify the person, we see a
'Vegetable Hair Dye” announced by some perfumer. It
is not stated of what vegetables the compound is composed,
and this, we think, is a great slip on the part of the com-
poser. A hair-dye made from colewort might, if so an-
nounced, sell well; because the idiots who dye their bair
might be led to think that colewort would doubtless give
their head the blackness of a coal. But who, unless he
loved a mermaid, and to please her wanted to bave his hair
dyed green, would ever dream of using hair-dye manufac-
tured out of cabbage ; and surely few people would ever
try a “vegetable Lair-dye,” if there were a suspicion that

following satisfactory account of him in reading their Times :

His first official act was to go to the Army of the Potomac
under BURNSIDE. There he inquired fully into the health of the horses,
and has adopted a new system to check the mortality among them.”
We rejoice in the assurance, derivable from the above
statement, that MR. RAREY is, as our bumpkins say,
alive and kicking, whilst he is teaching wild horses not
to kick. When he has succeeded in putting the horses
of the Army of the Potomac to rights, perhaps ABRAHAM

BUTLER IN BODILY FEAR.
We trust that the following 'statement in the Times,
about GENERAL BUTLER, is founded on correct infor-
mation :-
“ His personal safety is so precarious that, like other great
tyrants, he has tasters' to prove the harmlessness of his entrées
and ragouts, and the innocence of his wines, wears a bullet and
dagger-proof coat of mail under his uniform, and sleeps with re-
volvers at his pillow, and armed sentinels at his door, to prevent
midnight assassination."
How pleasing to know that the Yankee Haynau lives
in continual fear for the life which he deserves to lose!
But it is to be hoped that nobody will assassinate him ;
because, if half of the tales of his atrocities are true, his
blood ought not to be shed by bullet or dagger, or curdled
with complimentary poison. BUTLER's circulation should
be arrested by a legal ligature; at least if it is right that
the law should be finished by that means on the person of

The Conservatives, as they call themselves,

DERING) has been elected for East Kent. He
has overthrown SIR NORTON KNATCHBULL, a
baronet of a mere mushroom family which cannot
be shown to have held Mersham Hatch, the
seat, earlier than the second year of HENRY

was divided by the Reform Act, East Kent
selects a Liberal. This seems truly awful, but
the Tories must find balm in Gilead, that is to
say comfort in Kent, in the consideration that
the electors were the true aristocrats, could not
put up with a novus homo like Sir NORTON, and
chose the descendant of ETHELWARD. It would
be bad taste and bad manners to sulk over a
defeat like this. If SIR NORTON bad been

And guards you from plunder by night and by day,

For light is his wages, and hcavy his toil.

IMPERIAL COURT DRESS.
On the occasion of the Imperial reception at the Tuileries on New
Year's Day, according to the Paris Correspondent of the Times :-
“The regulation for the costume of the magistrates and the functionaries par-
ticularly required that they should be in fuil dress, but without their whito
pantaloons."
We are told, in continuation, that “the Grand Master of the Cere.
monies of course meant the prohibition to apply only to the colour of
the garment.” This is not so certain. An Empire professing to be
based on democracy may have wished to symbolise its respect for the
sans culottes. No fashion could be too preposterous for the Court that
lias revived Hoops. Certainly the edict which forbad gentlemen to
wear their white pantaloons did not prevent them from wearing black
ones; but perhaps they would have given greater satisfaction had they
appeared in petticoats, after the manner of Highlanders, with a differ.
ence, consisting in the expansion of their philibegs with ample Crinoline.
They would thus have paid a graceful compliment both to the populace
and to the petticoat Government which controls the EMPEROR's Italian
policy.

THERE was a Young Lady of Leigh,
Who behaved rather rudely
at tea;
Called the footman, Old Chap,”
Spilt her tea in her lap,
And cried, “ There goes my blessed Bohea."
There was an Old Girl of Carshalton,
Whom conceit to absurdity brought on;
She said, “If I chose,
I could write verse or prose,
That would not disgrace Mrs. NORTON.”
There was a Young Lady of Cheadle,
Was deeply beloved by the beadle :
But she scoffed at his
prayer,
Left her work on his chair,
And the beadle sat down on the needle.
There was an Old Girl of South Kilworth,

And cried, “ You old snob, you 'll
Be off with your globule ;

There was a Young Lady of Pandy,

And her hair, that was black, became sandy.

“THE STOCKS. --HAMPSHIRE BARBARITY.-At the weekly Petty Sessions held at
Andover, on Monday, the 15th ult., THOMAS COLEMAN, a young labourer residing at
Charlton, was fined 58. for drunkenness, and in default of payment within fourteen
days sentenced to six hours in the stocks. The money not being forthcoming at the
appointed time, the delinquent was escorted into the town on Saturday last, by the
Charlton policeman, and expiated bis offence by lying on the cold fag-stones of
the market-place, with his poor feet' safely ensconced in the ancient engine of

us hope that he was at least provided with that accommodation by the

which alleges the contrary is a mistake. Thus, the sting would have
been taken out of what certainly would else have been a very gross case
of "Hampshire Barbarity.” A tipsy clown had better be set in the
stocks for six hours than sent to gaol for a week. But the question is
whether the youthful rustic, THOMAS COLEMAN, ought to have sat in
the stocks alone. He had got drunk, of course, on beer. How much
had he taken, and what sort of liquor was it! For if, like the beer of
most Hampshire beershops, the draught which intoxicated THOMAS
was abominable stuff, then the vendor thereof was more responsible
than THOMAS for THOMAS's drunkenness. Then, by right, that villanous
beer-monger should have been adjudged to a share in the stocks with
young THOMAS.

OLD KING COTTON.
OLD King Cotton one raw morning got on
His fluffy throne-in a huff was he,
As he looked askance there was scorn in his glance,
And all gazed with awe on his Majesty,
"Bobbins and Jenny and Mules, though many
May groan, lock up with this iron key.
None sball work," quoth he, “in my territory,
Till North and South live in amity.”
A Royal Speech is, history teaches,
A soothing potion certainly,
So lull'd by poppies, the King did drop his
Head, and dreamt-like you or me,
Of war-hounds panting and one hound wanting
His clench'd ear to be set free,
Their red tongues showing hatred glowing,
And the biggest brute named “Unity."
Bunkum spouters, Government touters
Shouted with ferocity,
List, ye darkies-that loud bark is
The death-knell of slavery.
A French observer cried with fervour,
“ This sight is shocking, mon ami.'
When a Yankee rowdy
answer'd loudly,
Pinch my dog's tail, and then you 'll see."
As Intervention prudent men shun,
King Cotton started nervously.
“ Call my daughters, I'll change my quarters,
What a horrid row about Unity!
Up, Bobbins
and Jenny! No longer any
Shall pine till North and South agree,
With Briton's Lion, new soil we 'Il try on
Which to plant our royal tree.

His Indian throne and sings with glee:-

The very worst Patient that can be."

BISHOP MAWWORM'S APOLOGY.
Why, when I signal Railway Boards to stop,
Excursion-trains on Sundays with my crook,
Inviting other men to shut up shop,
Don't I at home with equal strictness look,
In mine own household showing forth a due
Observance of the Sabbath, like a Jew?
How, you demand, can a right reverend sire
His kettle on the coals permit to sing,
Or toast his soles before a Sunday fire,
If Judah's lawgiver forbad the thing ?
With quiet conscience how can he enjoy
Hot dinners, which must servants needs employ?
Ere he indulge in the forbidden feast,
Why should a menial, decked in blue array,
Drive him to Church ? 'Why makes he man and beast
Thus work for him upon the holy day,
When, going on his legs, he might express
With Jewish rigour, Christian lowliness ?
Whilst thus he violates the day of rest
Let him stand forth, and honestly explain
Why he presumes the stoppage to request
Of every cheaply running Sunday train,
Sole means whereby the masses can repair
To country, or sea-side, for change of a'r ?
My too freethinking, and consistent friend,
You need not push these obvious questions home,
Can you imagine, or do you pretend
At all to fear that anything would come
Of that memorial, which, you ought to know,
Was meant for nothing but a stir and show ?
Why, don't you read the price of railway shares,
And their returns per cent., you serious goose ?

Do aught that could their dividends reduce?
There, never fear that aught that we can say
Can make them sanctify the sacred day!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BLANKETS AND BROAD SHEETS.
AMONG the hundred hints put daily forth to
help our suffering poor, we notice a suggestion
in the Manchester Examiner, that people without
blankets should use newspapers instead of them.
One correspondent states that, having placed a
couple of journals underneath bis counterpane,
he was as comfortably warm as with an extra
pair of blankets: and another writer mentions
how, his blankets having been consigned to the
keeping of his uncle, he used newspapers instead
of them, and slept like a top.
We hope the knowledge of these facts will
in no way check the charitable flow of blankets
to the North ; for however warm a newspaper
may be by way of covering, we should fancy a
well woven Witney blanket must be warmer.
Still, people without blankets may find comfort
in the broad sheets of the Times and other jour-
nals; and those of us who don't know what to
do with our waste paper, might as well send it to
Manchester as let it lie useless at home. We
wonder if the warmth which a newspaper im-
parts be affected by its politics or the style used
by its writers. The cold cynicism, say, of the
Slashaway Review, must surely be less warming
than the genial glow diffused throughout the
drawings and the literature of Punch. There
may, however, be advantage in using rather
heavy writings for a bed-cover. For instance, we
conceive that the poetry of TUPPER would, no
matter how applied, be found a first-rate soporific.

CLEVER fellows, these Jesuits! M. VICTOR HUGO's new
romance, Les Misérables, contains matter highly prejudicial
to the character of the Order. So the Jesuits buy the
right of translating the book in England, and of course
the translation appears without the objectionable part, but
with the angelic Bishop in all his impossible sweetness.
Now this is really a neat douge, and as it is also a piece
of abject homage, on the part of the Jesuits, to the tre-

circulate the information all over the world. Simply
because M. Hugo's French is very beautiful, and not at

MEMBERS of the Geographical Society are possibly aware that there

leader of the bell-ringers the following curt note :-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WORD ON A DEMONSTRATION.
EXETER HALL has been crowded to suffocation with an
assemblage desirous to repudiate the idea that Eoglishmen
bad abated one jot or tittle of their old batred of Black
Slavery. Mr. Punch is not only desirous to speak with
respect, but with honour, of the thousands who joined in
this demonstration. He, at least, may appeal to his own
pages, and ask whether any denunciation of the Accursed
System has been heartier than his. He rejoices that the
people are of one mind in this matter. But he happens to
be fearless enough to regret, openly, that some of his fellow-
countrymen see but half a truth at a time. “Down with
Black Slavery!" is a noble cry, but why is it necessary to
stultify it by the cry “Up with White Slavery!" l'his
is what those cried who were induced by persons who
should have known better to carry a resolution condemning
the Confederate struggle for freedom. Surely the white
man has as much right to liberty as the black man. The
South only asks to be let alone, and this is not an out-
rageous demand on the part of those who complain that
hordes of Irish, Germans, and the ruffianism of New York
are hired to cut the throats of native Americans, merely
for interpreting the Constitution differently from certain
attorneys in the North. Black Slavery is doomed, and
dying, but Mr. Punch will be no party to the establish-
ment of White Slavery instead, and he stands too well
with his countrymen to be afraid to tell them that a good
many of them are, from a right motive, doing a wrong

thing.
Taffy in the Jury-Box.
The writer of a letter, signed “ CYMRO," in the Morning
Post, complains that " a good deal has been said by learned
Judges against Welsh juries.” On the other hand, perbaps,
at least as much has been said by Welsh prisoners and
Welsh defendants for them. If the nursery poem truly
declares that-
“ Taffy was a Welshman,
Taffy was a thief :"
If that statement is true of Taffy in general, then, un-
doubtedly, every rogue that is tried by a Welsh jury enjoys
anyhow the advantage of being tried by his peers.

cheerful tone by the junior portion of a studious and enlightened publie.
No doubt, as the learned Professor says, " the pills is a great purifier
of the blood;” as will subsequently be proved. At present we are more
particularly concerned with the Ointment; and now for the discovery
of the grand secret-its ingredients. We resume the thread of the
Times' narrative :-
“On the receipt of the ointment, the law of France prohibiting the sale of secret
remedies, it was submitted to the authorised French chemists to be analysed, and
it was found to contain BUTTER, LARD, BORDEAUX TURPENTINE, WHITE Wax,
YELLOW WAX, AND NOTHING ELSE."
And so this, after all, is the composition of HOLLOWAY'S Ointment.
Butter, lard, Bordeaux turpentine, white wax, yellow wax, and nothing
else! PROFESSOR HOLLOWAY says no. He declares that there is
something else. Very likely there is. We do not question PROFESSOR
HOLLOWAY's word. But we had rather rely on the analysis of the
French chemists, which assures us that, besides the substances above
enumerated, HOLLOWAY'S Ointment contains nothing material. No
ATLANTIC
wonder that, as our authority goes on to say:-
“On finding these to be the constituents of the ointment, the fear of the French
against secret remedies fled at once, and DR. SILLEs obtained a brevet or patent for
the sale of the ointment."
No preparation could possibly be more bland. Indeed, if PROFESSOR
HOLLOWAY'S Ointment were not just the mild compound which it
appears to be from the exposure of its components by French chemistry,
how could it, without producing dangerous irritation, be, as the Pro-
fessor says that it should be, rubbed on old wounds “like salt on
meat?" "The part affected would soon be in a pretty pickle.
And now for HOLLOWAY's Pills. The simplicity of the composition
of HOLLOWAY's Ointment, as ascertained by the analysis of French
chemists, prepares us to place implicit confidence in the subjoined
extract from The Family Doctor under the head of NOSTRUM:-
“8. HOLLOWAY'S Pills, which are vaunted as a remedy for all diseases, consist of
aloes, and a vegetable matter like scammony, or jalap, and soap."
There! No more patent or any other medicine-except HOLLOWAY'S
Pills and Ointment; which we now know how to make for our-
selves. PROFESSOR HOLLOWAY's cat is out of the bag. Hence-
forth we shall be able to cure all our own diseases. The Ointment
alone would enable us to do that, without the Pills. It is evidently
the finer thing. Defendant recommended plaintiff " to concentrate all
his efforts to procure permission to sell the Ointment." That is

Many years ago a Company was started by an enterprising gentleman named WASHINGTON,
on the cther side of the water, and which has ever since claimed and enjoyed a monopoly as
carriers to the Government. It seems, however, to be generally admitted that the vehicle
employed for this purpose was a very heavy and cumbersome piece of machinery, which, though
it might go smoothly enough along a wide and level road, was pretty sure to break down in
the event of a collision. What was long dreaded has now actually occurred. An active young
Cotton Merchant, named South, being disgusted with the mode in which affairs were managed
by the Washington party, got up a new Company, whose men, notwithstanding the opposition
offered by the old rickety conveyance, still stand firmly in the van. Greatly exasperated

(To be continued until every Town in the Kingdom has been immortalised.) MR. A. W. KINGLAKE'S NEWLY OPENED PHOTOGRAPHIC ESTABLISHMENT
AT MESSRS. BLACKWOOD'S, LONDON AND EDINBURGH.
MR. A. W. KINGLAKE, Photographic Artist to the Upper Circles
of England and the Continent, begs to invite the attention of Crowned
Heads, Statesmen, Diplomatists, Generals and Admirals, Members of
Parliament, and other persons holding conspicuous public positions, to
his establishment for producing life-like resemblances in small or large,

solar and oxy-hydrogen apparatus.
MR. KINGLAKE has already been honoured by the patronage of the
late EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS, and that of His Majesty the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, who has been photographed singly and in

principal officers of state, as LE DUC DE MORNY, LE COMTE PERSIGNY,
COL. FLEURY, M. DE MAUPAS, ST. ARNAUD, formerly Le Roy,&c.&c.&c.
In the class of diplomatists and statesmen, MR. KINGLAKE has been
favoured with sittings from the late EARL OF ABERDEEN, LORD STRAT-
FORD DE REDCLIFFE, the DUKE OF NEWCASTLE, VISCOUNT PALMER-
STON, PRINCE MENTSCHIKOFF, and many others only inferior in

IIUMANITIES OF THE HUSTINGS.
THERE has just been an election for Reigate, not perliaps
a very exciting affair in itself, inasmuch as both candidates
called themselves Liberals, and appealed to a constituency
numbering a vast throng of 747. But the exquisite
amenity of the proceedings entitles the election to an im-
mortalising word. MR. Wilkinson, formerly of Lumbetli,
was one of the candidates, and at the nomination one of
the speakers, MR. PHILLIPS, said:-
“He conjured MR. WILKINSON nut to go to Parliament, inasmuch
as his age was such that any shock would unsettle and perhaps prove
fatal to him."
Not to be behindland in politeness, MR. WILKINSON
replied that lie-
“Was much obliged to MR. PHILLIP's for being so very considerate
with regard to his health, but he assured the electors that he felt
completely able to conduct whatever business might be imposed upon

him.'
The electors, however, were not to be outdone in
courtesy, and scorning to take advantage of MR. WILKIN-
SON's good breeding, furnished the returning officer with
instructions to make the following announcement. MR.
LEVESON GOWER 345, MR. WILKINSON 333. Mr. Wil-
KINSON declared that he had been beaten with honour,
and Mr. GOWER was awfully complimentary to everybody
concerned. This is a gentlemanly way of doing ihings.

PICTURESQUE NOOKS AND CORNERS. Now, whO WOULD EVER THINK OF COMING OUT HERE FOR A MERE WALKI”.
HENRY, MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE,
BORN JULY 2, 1780; DIED JANUARY 31, 1863.
Low lies the grey head that had borne so well
Its weight of years and honour, from far days
That seem as alien to our blame or praise,
As days whereof books only live to tell.
How one hy one, Time's tooth eats througb the chain
Whose links unite our lives to that grey past !
A golden link was this, that parted last,
Leaving a void, not to be filled again.
He stepped into the senate from the school
As great men's sons did in his early day,
Putting the College exercise away,
To take the helm of empire and the rule.
He knew the great ones, that loom yet more great
To us through mists of time; he spoke the grief
Of England, o'er the tomb of her sea-chief,
Who crowned at Traſalgar his fame and fate.
He fought with Pitt, he served with Fox; he shared
The struggles of a fiercer time than ours,
When party severed chiefs and sundered powers
By gulfs, set thick with sharp hates, barbed and bared.
Thence passed he to the calmer times we know,
Calmer by dint of all that such as he
Have won, from victory to victory
Passing, with measured steps, secure and slow,
Leaving no fort half-ta'en, post half-secured:
Wherever they passed, turning old foes to friends ;
So reaching to still larger loftier ends,
That vantage ne'er was gained, but it endured.
He knew to sweeten strife, by gentle port,
Fair speech, kind judgment even of his focs,-
By tolerance, from trust in truth that flows,
By breeding, that nor asks nor payeth court,
By the wide teaching that makes rude men tame,
By letters and amenities of art,
Whose grace infiltrates to a nation's heart,
And rounds the angles of a Country's frame.
Such were the gracious influences brougļit
To bear by him and those with whom he stood;
For love of all things noble, fair, and good,
Ran in his veins, and like an instinct wrought.
Not his the book-worm's passion for dead books,
The connoisseur's mole-eye that gathers light,
Groping in ways where common eyes lind night,
But on God's work-day world turns blankest looks.
Where he loved books he loved their writers too,
From the great art of bye-gone days he learned
To prize the living art, which he discerned,
In days when critic-cant denied its due.
Even in the heat of party-strife he kept
That gentler mood, which calm o'er conflict brings,
As oil o'er stormy waves spreads smoothing rings,
Till side by side old feuds and passions slept.
And when life's evening came, 'twas girt about
With trust and reverence and troops of friends;
The young loved this old man, who on the ends
Of life and great affairs, yet sought them out,
And gave them kindly greeting, counsel, aid,
Yet not as some that stoops from high to low,
But as a friend 'mong friends he loved to know,
With whom we feel ashamed not, nor afraid.
And so passed slow and softly to its end, '
Serene and summer-still, his long-drawn day.
While England mourns a Nestor past away,
How many, high and low, lament a friend!

This seems all right enougb, if the donors
were allowed to bave a voice in the decision.
But when asked for their collection were the
children also asked for which of the two objects
they desired to subscribe! A church in Mada-
gascar is no doubt a needful thing, but bread
and meat in Manchester, some think, are still
more necessary: and although the Fish Street
children, to their honour be it said, have sent
some funds to help the Lanashire distressed,
that surely is no reason why, if they wish to do
so, they should not send some more. With all
their knowledge of geography, we suspect that
their ideas of Madagascar are but dim: and were
they told the Madagascar people wanted a new
meeting-house, and that there were folk in Man-
chester who wanted bread and meat, we think
that we can guess to which their generosity would
naturally incline. To ask a school child to con-
tribute to the building of a church for a set of
semi-savages is, to Mr. Punch's thinking, neither
very laudable nor inordinately wise, and has in
it a smack of something close akin to cant: but
to ask a child to help a child who is not far
from starving, is an act of which no teacher has
need to be ashamed.
Mr. Punch has been politely begged to modify
the comments which he made upon this subject,
and he does so in so far as his words were
thought to bear upon the Fish Street congre-
gation, since, it appears from recent evidence,
they ought to touch the teachers only of the Fish
Street Sunday School. With regard to these
good people, Mr. Punch's sole fear is, that they
are possibly too good: and he doubts the Fish
Street teaching must be a little fishy, if the
lessons there imparted convey no better doctrine
than that we should give a stone for church-
building when we are asked for bread.
SCOTCHING THE SNAKE.
WE learn from the Scotsman that a newspaper
proprietor has been denied a deacon's office in
the Crieff Free Church on the ground of having
suffered unchaste and quack advertisements to
be inserted in his paper. This decision being
come to at a meeting of the elders, the proprietor
"craved extracts” (whatever that may mean),

as well as those of common sense, Mr. Punch
sincerely trusts that the appeal will be no go
(he would use the proper law phrase, if he only
knew it: Scottish friends in reading this will
please supply the break-jaw words). It is mainly
by advertisements that quacks exist and thrive,
and every newspaper admitting these uncleanly
puffs and lies, abets the filthy trickeries by which
sham doctors live. Mr. Punch regrets to say
that there are certain English journals defiled
in the same way, and he would vastly like to see

MUD THAT WON'T STICK.
F course, most
people have seen a
capital old carica-
ture representing
a debtor behind
prison-bars, and a
drunken soldier
leaning against the
outside of the gaol.
They are cackling
politics, after the
fashion of the
Gushers of our own
time. The Debtor
says, “I am dread-
fully alarmed for
our Liberties.”
“Hang (or some-
thing) our Lib-
Liberties," hiccups
the soldier, “itsh
our holy. Religion
I'm afraid for."
Mr. Punch must
reproduce this pic-
ture one of these
fine days, adapting
it for the benefit
of the Gushers. They are in such a dreadful state of mind about our
sacred institutions," of which Gushery has appointed itself the
maudlin curator. One of the Gushers has been let loose upon Mr.
Punch, and this is a ladlefull of the mud-flood :-
“The cankered jesters who write such venomous caricatures as 'The Naggletons
-who show us a brute of a man and a fiend of a woman, wrangling, snarling, and
tearing each other to pieces with their forked tongues, from morning till night and
from year's end to year's end—may have drawn their morbid diagnoses from solitary
experience or exceptional observation; but their Ghastly Phantasmagoria are the
exception; and attentive and healthy study of the real world and its ways will
suffice to convince those who are not incurably splenetic and saturnine, that the
rule is one of honesty, cheerfulness, faith, and love."
" Itsh our hic-holy marriages that I'm-hic-hic-afraid for.” Poor
dear MR, and MRS. NAGGLETON ! Only to think that their harmless
sparring should put a sentimentalist into such a condition. Hear him
again :-
"For better, for worse,'—what a depth, an Awfulness of Significance lies in
these four simple words ! The Romanists hold marriage to be a sacrament; and
what, indeed, can be more sacramental than the solemn compact of love and union
which are to last for life—the earthly type of the love and union of the hereafter,
and which shall endure for ever? For better, for worse.""
Truly Awful! And what a new discovery is thus touchingly announced!
The Gusher quite affects us, and it is delightful to observe the ecstacy
of an awakening mind. When the Cockneys found the skeleton of a
donkey on Hampstead Heath, they looked pensively upon the anatomy,
and one of them, (he must have been a Gusher,) exclaimed "Ab, SAM,
we are fearfully and wonderfully made ! There is an Awfulness of
Significance in a donkey." .
Still, sewers have gates, and all kinds of muddy gush should have
some limits. We almost think that "GHASTLY PHANTASMAGORIA” are
tall words for a conjugal squabble. But there are some sentimentalists
who can never resist a polysyllable. If it prove nothing else, it proves
that the writer can spell. Otherwise, we might take exception to such
a thunderous, blue-fire description of a scene of fire-side chat. Never
mind. As SIR EDWARD LYTTON observes-
“ From vulgar eyes a veil the Isis screens,
And fools on fools still ask what Hamlet means.”
The esoteric Naggletonian.mystery is hidden from the Gushers. They
do not perceive that those wonderful dialogues are printed with a
purpose of Awful Significance. The “Naggletons” is one long warning
against the use of objectionable language; and now that we have
revealed this, Mr. Punch will, he is sure, have the sincerest plaudits
from his friends the Gushers, whose abusive words above-cited, would,
were they not used with an Awful Significance, procure the user a
prompt exclusion from what is venomously and morbidly called the
society of gentlemen, but which are sanctified by the high moral purpose
that underlies them. If they seem to the outside world a little behind
the taste of the day, a little more suited to certain defunct publications
of the street of the Holy Well, it must be remembered, first, that such
language has an Awful Significance, and secondly, that the journals
from which they may seem to be taken, no longer exist to afford scope
for Gushers. It is a misfortune to be before one's Age--and Satirist.
So, with permission, Mr. Punch purposes to continue to exhibit his
Ghastly Phantasmagoria, despite objections from those whom the West-
minster Review brands as Bohemians, but in respect of whom Mr. Punch
employs a milder name—at present.

A Plea to the Merchant Princes.

And set on end the Lion's mane.

Will be forbid to have bis Lark:

That luckless man 's the Banker's Clerk.
For he it seems must plod about,

Writing "No Orders, “ People Out,"
And seeking cash from absent tills.

With endorsees, from dawn till dark,
While he must poke about, the scoff
Of city boys, that Banker's Clerk.
A chain is round his manly waist,
A black portfolio by bis side,
What boots it that the Prince comes graced
With ALEXANDRA as his bride ?

Shoving small papers, JONES on BROWN,"
Through sported oak, our Banker's Clerk.

(To be continued until every Toron in the Kingdom has been immortalised.) every move is on the square. Our inability to comprehend the special

utter ignorance of the manners and customs peculiar to this class of
tradesmen in Erin's very green isle. Do all the retail grocers in Ireland
wear masks? Haven't they got the face to appear before their custo-

see it all! Doubtless a Jesuitical method of inveigling the grocers'
daughters into a nunnery, so that being tired of the hills of life they
may take to the veils. And the Euclids ! Education for the middle

and fans in their hands, sitting on two T chess-boards, studying a

SINCE the publication of MR. DARWIN's work
on the Origin of Species Horticulturists have been
making rapid strides in the improvement of the
races of vegetables and plants. In that scientific
journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle, there is already
advertised a “student parsnip” and “pedigree

trying to improve their national symbol, the
thistle, so as to develop more of its prickly
propensities, when handled too roughly. The
Trish shamrock will, no doubt, by careful cultiva-
tion, be made to show four leaves when SAMUEL
LOVER, who sang

will be enabled to make an universal trial of
his philanthropy. The rose now boasts of being
named after post of the celebrities before the
public, but with all its fine names, we question
whether it yet smells any sweeter than the old
cabbage rose. The geranium is immortalised by
baving two of its best bedding varieties named
respectively Punch and Judy, but being of a too
fiery nature when together, they do best put into
separate beds. The Phlox is likewise honoured
by having one of its best sorts named Mr. Punch,
but Toby is yet unrewarded, although that faithful
animal's name ought to stand high on the list.

Jones (living in the plebeian locality of St. John's Wood).'." I AM ALSO EXTREMELY
PARTICULAR ABOUT MY WINDOWS—IF YOU ENTER MY SERVICE, I SHALL EXPECT
YOU TO CLEAN THEM VERY CAREFULLY."
John Thomas (from Belgravia). “OH, OF COURSE, SIR! YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
WINDOWS CLEANED IF YOU LIKE-BUT IN BELGRAVIA-WE PREFERS THEM DIRTY
- IT'S CONSIDERED MORE ARISTOCRATIO I"
A Ballad for the Brutal Classes.
The crime of highway robbery
We find increased of late,
Accompanied by violence
Alarming to the State ;
The practice of garotting
Has grown to that extent,
A Bill's brought in to check the same
By Corporal Punishment.
The practice, &c.
The Member for North Staffordshire
Has framed the intended Act,
Which makes all base Garotters
Liable to be whacked.
It has passed the second reading,
So now, my coves, beware ;!
You 'll get a precious good híding'
If you don't take precious good care.
The practice, &c.
Oh, won't you cry and holloa,
And twist like any eel,
Receiving of that correction
Which the Cat will make you feel;
As many as fifty lashes,
Inflicted at a time!
Garotters, when your backs are scratched,
You 'll then lament your crime.
The practice, &c.
The stripes will sore affect you,
Although a hardened bloke.
You'll find the Cat o' Nine Tails
Is not at all a joke.
Or a joke that only stings you,
But others may call it fun
To see you brought to wince and wail
For the cruelty you've done.
The practice, &c.
In for three several floggings,
With time to think between,
When you've received your sentence,
Won't you be all serene !
The pleasure of expectation,
Beforehand, will be sweet,
Which, when the happy morn'arrives,
Experience will complete.
The practice, &c. :
When resting from hard labour
Within your prison cell,
Especially after having
Been whipped already well,
You 'll know how the Cat then tasted,
And have to taste still more,
With leisure for to think upon
The treat for you in store.
The practice, &c.
The thoughts will give you appetite
To relish your hard fare,
Not succulent any longer,
In future coarse and spare.
No currant jelly with your mutton,
Or luxuries like that,
Water-gruel to cherish your stomach,
And to warm your back the Cat.
The practice, &c.
We trust LORD VISCOUNT PALMERSTON
Will suffer the Bill to pass;
For the Lash is most effectual
To deter the ruffian class.
That terror discontinued
Assaults upon the QUEEN,
And soon would banish Garotting from
This sublunary scene.
The practice, &c.

CHORUSES AND CANT.
“One of the Ministers” of Inverness has been writing a long letter to the
Courier of that ilk, complaining that a class which has lately been established there
for practising part-singing has "to the surprise of its sober-minded and genuine
Protestant members,” been developing a sadly Popish tendency of taste by-
“ The singing of most unctuous Roman Catholic hymns, in which the aid and protection of
blessed Saints are fervently involved, and the omnipotence,
omnipresence, and whatever other
divine attributes the Holy Virgin may possess, are duly set forth and extolled."
Upon inquiry it appears that these so-called "unctuous hymns,” are simply
operatic pieces, such as the chorus “ Santa Maria," in the opera of Dinorah. "In
the letter we refer to the singing of these pieces is denounced as "idolatrous,” and
it is hoped that the "good people who abhor idolatry,” will abstain from joining
in such "Popish exercises." It is evident, moreover, that in the writer's estima.
tion, rather a brimstoney futurity is in store for the misguided
men who practise such
part-songs, and convict themselves thereby of being Roman Catholics.
Now, if the singing of such pieces be Papistical and bad, surely there must be the
like evil in the hearing of them : and any one who goes to hear
the opera of Dinorah
is guilty of assisting in an unctuous Popish exercise. Moreover any one who joins
in singing or in hearing sung such glees, say, as "The Curfer," or "Mark the
merry Elves,” plainly betrays a faith in the existence of the fairies, and may, therefore
clearly be regarded as a heatben. Upon the same ground, too, whoever sings
“Sweet Spirit, hear my Prayer," from the opera of Lurliné, may be viewed as
a believer in the art of spirit-rapping : while the vocalist who warbles “I'd be a
Butterfly,” may be held to entertain a strong desire to commit suicide, in the hope
that, through the transmigration of souls, he may become the insect which he
aspires to be.
We have little fear of people turning Catholics through choruses, and so we
won't ask MR. Costa to revise all the librettos of the operas which he intends this
season to perform. As for the pious gentleman whose letter we have noticed,
were it not that he resides at Inverness, we might have fancied him officiating
somewhere in the province of Cant.

DELIVERANCE FROM FRENCH FASHIONS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS ALEXANDRA has come
here to be the PRINCESS OF WALES just in time. She will, of course,

"THE ROSE IN SUN.” *
(In St. George's Chapel at Windsor, March 10, 1863.)
The burials have been many,
The bridals have been few,
Beneath this roof, wrought with the skill
Those old-world carvers knew,
Between whose hands the stubborn stone !
To leaf and flow'ret grew.
Along the key-stones of the vault,
The blazoned scutcheons run,
But in the shields of gartered knights,
And kings, the foremost one,
Bears gallant EDWARD's cognisance-
The silver rose in sun,
Time was that badge with fancies
Of blood and strife was fraught,
Of days when York and Lancaster
Beneath the roses fought-
Of kingly lines contending,
A realm by war distraught.
Henceforth St. George's chapel,
Where that device it shows,
Speaks of a brighter sunlight
Upon a fairer rose,
Unstained by memories of strife,
Undimmed by war and woes.
A rose in sun, we saw her
While joy was o'er the land,
Beneath her veil of bridal white
Before the altar stand,
Her bridal nosegay, trembling,
With the trembling of her hand.
A northern rose, the sweeter
For memories of the sea,
By the side of which it blossomed,
With the keen winds blowing free
O'er the stern soil that reared it,

THE FEAST OF LANTERNS.
(Being the original of MACAULAY's Armada.)
ATTEND, all ye who wish to hear our noble London's praise,
I sing of that great Tuesday night that saw her in a blaze,
When the Archbishop's benison had linked, in bridal chain,
Young ALBERT EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, and our sweet bright-eyed
Dane.
It was about the chilly close of a half-foggy day,
When London's myriads all came out to see the grand display:
From sleepy Hammersmith, and from the Dogs' amphibious Isle,
The east and west they poured along for many a muddy mile.
The aristocracy for once the pageant deigned to grace,
(Except a few who fled from town and joined the sylvan chace).
Each wide-awake and travelling cap was taken from the wall,
Each wrap and bearskin was brought down and ready in the hall,
Many a gay visitor came up from province and from coast,
And on that night SiR ROWLAND HILL he stopped the local post.
See, mounted on his charger tall, the proud Inspector comes,
For sterner work than aiding swells to get to balls and drums,
His constables essay to clear in every street a space,
And shout his orders with much more of Henergy than grace';
And haughtily the dandies sneer, and slightly scream the belles,
As round the crested carriage the plebeian torrent swells,
See how the Lion of the Park attempts with half-a-crown
To bribe his way from streets his coach should never have gone down.
So looks he when in scarlet rage, upon the hunting field,
His priceless hounds he struggles from a Cockney's charge to shield.
So glares he when on Epsom Downs in wrath he turns to bay,
And swears his carriage shall be moored where last year's race it lay.
O keep your temper now, my Swell; and don't be scared, fair maids,
A BLACK HAT-MOSPHERE.

For on this day the Royal PRINCE OF WALE-

And 'tis the proudest moment of his life.

Where sea-mews sbriek and Neptune hoarsely roars,
A fair Princess across the main hath come,
To make the tea in ALBERT EDWARD's home!
Ab, happy maiden ! happy maiden, ah!
Thou weep'd'st no doubt to leave thy Pa and Ma,
But never mind, though they're across the water,
BRITANNIA now accepts thee as her daughter.
And see what splendid nuptial gifts we bring
To thee, fair bride of Wales, our future King !
What ducks of diamonds, and what pets of pearls,
What rubies red are thine, thou gem of girls !
And thou art welcomed by the entire British nation,
E’en from the great LORD Mayor and City Corporation
Down to the umble poet who sits here,
And fain would drink thy health in strong and luscious
beer.
But, lo! old Pam bave robbed me of my pension,
(For poetry is past his comprehension),
And, meanly swindled by that baughty Lord,
The poet poor can scarce a drain afford.
Smile on him, Princess ! send him balf-a-crown,
That he may drink thy health in stout so brown;
And then his Poems he to thee will send,
And hopes you 'll read them to the very end,
As many a Peer and Peeress too bave done,
And likewise Dukes, and said they were great fun.

as being sold as low as one-and-six.
Now, if ladies be attracted by announcements such as
these, why don't the drapers carry out the dodge a little
further, and turn to trade account some other Church
observances ? “CRINOLINES FOR CHURCHINGS ” would be
a taking placard to stick up in a shop-front, and “Bom-

A hundred of the like attractive catch-lines might be
thought of, having some connection with the ceremonies of
the Church; but we abstain from doing more than merely
throwing out the hint, because upon the whole we think
that such announcements somewhat savour of profanity, and
we don't care much to help an advertising tradesman who
tries to make a profit out of pure religion, and turns to
trade account the orders and solemnities appointed by the
Church.

DANGEROUS DONKEY RIDING.
That instructive sporting writer, Argus, in an article
relative to the Grand National Steeple-chace, observes :-
“. Jerusalem, over a natural country, would cut a good figure, I
believe, but here the fences are too small and intricate to suit him,
and at the finish something speedier is certain to be found."
In an ordinary race wherein the competitors belong to
that particular species of the equine genus to which the
term Jerusalem is commonly applied, the successful can-
didate is the hindmost. If the same rule obtains in a
steeple-chace, contested by the same long-eared quadrupeds,
the individual Jerusalem above-named ought to stand a
chance. That is to say, unless that steeple-chace is, as most
steeple-chaces may perhaps be said to be, one in which
the riders and not the ridden are to be ranked under a
denomination convertible with that of " Jerusalem pony."

POLAND'S CHAIN-SHOT.
THE ring-dove swells and spurns the foes
That on her nest intrude :
The mother-ben defies the kite
That hovers o'er her brood;
The tamest beast that nature knows,
Savage at bay will stand,
'Gainst aught, how strong and fierce soe'er,
That on its young lays band.
A mother's heart, that softest thing,
To sternest thing can grow,
By common pulses that pervade
Creation, high and low;
And who shall deem these pulses pure
In brutes their limits find,
Nor thrill where'er a mother's heart
Beats among
humankind ?
The Czar forgot that mother's rage,
When his command he gave,
Tear Poland's son from Poland's heart,
For soldier and for slave.
The chain for those that dare hold back,
The stick for those that go-
March, conscript-dogs!” Spite of her chains,
The mother shouted “No!"
She leaped at her oppressor's throat,
Round his her arms she flung;
Trod underfoot, about his feet
With desperate grasp she hung,
She clutched bare blades, nor recked the blood,
That through her fingers poured;
Her manacles she gathered up
To brain the Cossack borde.
An eye that knows no fear of death,
Hath palsied armed hand.
A nation's heart made desperate
With wrong who can withstand ?,
So with a heart made desperate,
And death-defying eye,
Unarmed, unaided, Poland rose,
And Russia turned to fly.
Like bees about a baffled bear,
Thick swarm the Kossinaires ;
Their scythes' long sweep lays swathe on swathe,
In Russian line and square ;
Now ply the file on fetter-lock,
And smite the rivet through,
And loose my manacles to cram
The cannon's mouth into!

With iron hooped and bound?
Of cannon-balls I have but three;

One shot for KosciUSKO,
For CZARTORYSKI One,
And one for gallant LANGEWIECZ-
And then let burst the gun !
“ And up and out, bold Kossinaires,
And on with sweep of scythe !
The dew is red, the heads are close,
The reapers brave and blythe !
And when your harvest-work is done,
And all the fields are bare,
Your mother, Poland, waits to bless
The few that home shall fare.”
There's not a heart, with veins that thrill
For courage or 'gainst wrong,
But beats with Poland's in accord,
And prays her arm be strong.
No nation lives-let statesmen pause,
Weigh, write, howe'er they will-
But yearns to strike a stroke for thee,
The unconquered Poland still !
And if Diplomacy must bow,
When might doth right o'ersway,

DIED AT PAU, MARCH 11,
BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY, MARCH 25, 1863.
Blazon another name upon the roll
Of those who for pure fame have nobly striven;
Cancel another life from off the scroll
Of lives to duty and true service given.
Such lives make up the coin of untold worth
With which our England buys the place she holds :
Now, like a prodigal, she flings them forth,
Now, miser-like, in red-taped parcels folds,
And hides away, unused, to fret and wear
With friction of the band that counts, and rings,
But shrinks to spend, medals so fine and fair,
Till they waste down from grand to common things.
Sometimes, rare chance, this precious coin is ta’en
To purchase what no meaner wealth could buy
Some great renown, some conquest pure from stain,
Some sacrifice, whose lesson cannot die.
Then, and but then, we feel—whate'er our lack
In losing that which all around us craved,
That which the wealth of worlds can ne'er buy back-
What is well spent is better spent than saved.
One of these precious lives, gone to good end,
Was OUTRAM'S: from the time that he began
His soldier's service, never known to bend
From the straight course of true and noble man.
'Twas little that he fought his upward way!
As one of many, knowing not of fear :
'Tis more, that poor and weak found him their stay,
That fierce tribes, at his bidding, dropped the spear
For spade and sickle, owning him their chief,
Proving him just as generous, strong as kind :
From whom wrong suffered never lacked relief,
From whom wrong done its sure award would find.
Nor is it much that when war's work was slack,
Singly he braved the tiger in his lair,
And bleeding bore those bloody trophies back,
Which he, the winner, was the last to wear.
He faced worse foes than tigers driven to bay,
Wrong leaning upon power, injustice throned
In justice's high seat ; for many a day
He fought that fight, single, unhelped, disowned,
But fearless in his faith, bearing his breast
Under the armour of a conscience pure;
True knight-with stainless shield and lance in rest,
That no gainsayer might for long endure.
What if he bore worse scars from that long fight
Than tigers' fangs or claws could leave behind ?
He had done but his devoir: to uphold the right,
With health and wealth, life had been well resigned.
The strife was long, but victory was sure,
It came, and honour followed in its train.
The white face flushed, pain felt a sudden cure,
When duty bade him gird on sword again,
To strike between the living and the dead,
When England's hold on India seemed to fail
And tens 'gainst thousands stood, but no man fled,
And many felt despair, but few did quail.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CRACK FOR A COLONEL.
COLONEL DUNNE, step forward. Salute your superior
officer, General COMMANDER PUNCH; and, if you can,
explain, Sir, what you meant by saying this the other
evening, on occasion of the Vote for the Volunteer Ser-
vice :-
“ COLONEL DUNNE fully admitted the patriotism of the Volunteers,
which appeared to be valued at 20s. per head. (A Laugh.) He believed
Volunteers would be quite as ready to fight the enemies of their
country as soldiers could be, but the virtues of the force were civil-
not military. The great value of the movement was, that it taught
the people how to assemble in masses in case of invasion. (Hear, hear.)
In the meantime men were not made soldiers by clothing them in
suits of blotting-paper, arming them with old muskets, or teaching
them to take up four times as much ground as soldiers would do.
(Laughter.)"
Is this language, Sir, becoming an officer and a gentle-
man? Pray, what right) have you to sneer at Volunteers,
holding as you do a commission from HER MAJESTY, by
whom the Volunteers have been encouraged and approved ?
Do you pretend to know more than HER MAJESTY's ad-
visers (including GENERAL PUNCH), who have ever thought
the movement worthy of support? It is a fool's taunt in
you to jeer at the old muskets and blotting-paper uniforms
with which, as you allege, our Volunteers are furnished.
Pray, how long is it since the “Regulars were similarly
accoutred ? and for the improvement there has been in this
respect, you may mainly thank the outcry which was raised
throughout the country through the influence of the Press.
Now, both the country and the Press admire the Volun-
teers; and Army men, if they are wise (you will pardon
the hypothesis that some of them may not be so), will
abstain from casting ridicule upon a force which both the
Country and the Press hold in respect.
Hear what a civilian has said upon the subject :-
“MR. W. WILLIAMS was astonished to hear members complain of
an expenditure of £321,000 upon 160,000 men, while there were
£14,000,000 asked for in connection with the maintenance of the
regular Army, which numbered only 148,000 men. For his own part,
he thought the Vote for the Volunteers constituted the most econo-
mical portion of the expenditure embraced in the Estimates. (Hear,
hear.)"
Now, Colonel, is it not just possible that other civil
persons may, entertain this notion ? And may it not just

A PROPOSED REFORM ACT.
Bit by bit reform may be acceptable to some timid folks, but Mr.
Punch's noble and capacious mind repudiates such make-shifts. He
desires to make a clean sweep of all kinds of offences whatsoever, and
he strongly suggests to the Legislature that instead of trying to pass,
with infinite clamour and confused inarticulate noises, a heap of little
bills for making people good, sober, church-going, pheasant-respecting,
non-garotting, frugal, and grammatical by Act of Parliament, that body
should deal with such questions in a lump, and start us all fair. He
recommends some such Bill as this :-
AN ACT for Improving the Public generally.

but simply middling ; neither unsightly nor having any
beauty to lose, and therefore likely to be little altered for

for the advertiser must, nevertheless, be well built, tho-

she bring a great addition to his pecuniary resources, to
get about independent of cabs and omnibuses.
She will not need to have been much educated, iſ willing
to learn, and capable of applying general principles to par-

means need apply. Must be, or be determined to become,
well versed in cookery and needle-work. Accomplishments
will be acceptable, but are not expected; and good taste in
matters of art, as for instance music, will be infinitely
preferred to executive ability, which can seldom be main-
tained after marriage, and even then affords very limited
amusement.
She must be prepared to live quite cheerfully without the

gladly to concur in practising economy, when required, by

of comfort. Must be resolutely set against yielding grega-

PAM'S INCUBUS ON ITALY.
What a wonderful difference there is between Scotland and Ireland !
After dinner, at Edinburgh, in acknowledging the toast of his health,
our illustrious Pam took occasion to say :-
“We have recently given our moral influence to the Italians who were struggling
for freedom. There is unfortunately an incubus which weighs on part of that beau-
tiful and noble land, on the part which ought to be the capital of the kingdom."
It was unnecessary for the noble speaker to explain to an intelligent
audience that the incubus to which he alluded was the Old Man of the
See called St. Peter's. The first of European statesmen then proceeded
to make, for the benefit of those who are keeping the Incubus on its
place on Italy's bosom, the remarks which are thus reported :-)
“I cannot believe that error and wrong can be everlasting. I cannot but believe
that truth and justice must in the end prevail ; and, therefore, much as I lament
the shorn position of the Italian kingdom, I cannot but believe that a brighter
time is in store for it, and that a time will come when all those who are concerned
in regulating its destinies will feel that it is for their advantage, as well as for the
advantage of the Italians, that Italy should be in full possession of its capital. (Great
cheering, the whole company rising to their feet and joining in the expression of approval
of the sentiments expressed by the noble Viscount.)”
Suppose the assembly to which Pam addressed the foregoing utter-
ance of aspirations for Italian liberty, instead of having been composed
of Edinburgh citizens, had consisted of certain other subjects of HER
MAJESTY, who call themselves hereditary bondsmen, and do, in fact
inherit bondage under the incubus which LORD PALMERSTON mentioned.
Wouldn't they have started to their feet too; but with shouts how
different from hip, hip, hip, hooray! Immense and hideous would have
been the howling of the yahoos. As it is, no doubt, they will howl
frightfully enough when the eloquence above transcribed is repeated
to them.
Louis NAPOLEON is represented by MR. KINGLAKE to derive politi-
cal inspirations from Havanna cigars. He had better put our PREMIER'S
hint, to "all those who are concerned in regulating the destinies” of
Italy, in his pipe, and smoke it.
In the meanwhile, the Romans, and rest of the Italians, between
them, might do something towards making Pam's prophecy, touching
the rightful capital of Italy, come true. Why don't they concur in a
formal protest, to be published in the face of Europe, against the
election, by a constituency of Cardinals, of any successor to the present
Incubus; of any new Incubus in a Triple Hat, to squat on their
country's breast, when the Incubus whi now squats there shall have
been gathered to its predecessors ?

And we don't kill a pig every day.'

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The candid Medium told us
To look another way
For he felt towards the ceiling
Borne by the spirits' sway.
AT HOME WITH THE SPIRITS.
(By a Competent and Candid Observer.)
We sat about the table,
Till it seemed the force of Rapping
In a still and solemn ring,
Could really do no more.
Prepared
to swallow spirits,
Raps, Hands, or anything
"Are there spirits here?” awe-stricken,
We were not of the sceptics,
Spake the Medium-and lo!
Who scorn on mysteries fling.
“Yes' yes "-was rapped on all sides,
And the table to and fro,
Closely we screened the fire-light;
Heaved as a great ship heaveth,
The curtains close we drew.
When stormy winds do blow.
If the candles had been lighted
We felt they would burn blue,
It was awful in the darkness,
To know those spirits near ;
As when lights are set to spirits,
The loud and lusty rappings
They invariably do.
Of their airy hands to hear,
There was a Medium present,
And we all expressed a longing
But his name I will not tell,
For something to appear!
Lest the unbelieving scoffer
Our séance call a sell;
Sudden from out the darkness,
On the right or left hand side,
But I feel profound conviction,
That a lie he'd scom to tell,
Arose above the table,
At the Medium's command,
So long as there was daylight,
A white something, and we knew it
The spirits kept aloof:
Was a shrouded spirit-hand !
Though frequently requested
It moved along the table,
To put us to the proof
It wavered to and fro,
To tap us neath the table,
Or to float us to the roof.
It tickled those who asked it,
And all present seemed to know
But as daylight drew to gloaming
That hand--the hand of some one
Betwixt the dark and light,
Departed long ago !
We were conscious of a feeling,
Half hope and balf affright-
One knew it was her father's,
As if spirits were about us,
By wristband, form, and growth;
One that it was her mother's,
Though yet denied to sight.
Was ready to make oath,
We had talked of ghosts and goblins,
And I my affidavit,
In all ages, faiths and lands,
Will take that it was both.
Of spirit-haunted houses,
Strange sounds and shadowy bands,
I may not tell how sweetly
Tbe accordion it played ;
Of sigils and of pentacles,
Crystals and magic wands.
How strangely-knotted handkerchiefs,
Upon our knees it laid,
And as the darkness deepened
In the dark beneath the table,
How to and fro it strayed.
And twilight vanquished day-
Till what you saw or saw not,
Nor let the scoffing sceptic
'Twas difficult to say,
Say, darkness served as frame
And your neighbour's face loomed dimly,
To a conjuror's apparatus,
And his voice seemed far away-
Or helped a trickster's game;
Our Medium strove by candle
Our feelings waxed more eery,
And touch such doubt to shame.
And a casual finger-tap,
Seemed to vibrate through the system, He bade us ope the shutters,
Like a sudden thunder-clap,
The candles kindle bright,
And at this awful moment
But the spirits rapped, requesting
We heard-distinctly—“Rap!"
Decrease of eartbly light;
He begged us grasp—the spirits
“Rap! Rap !" above the ceiling-
Rapped, “Squeeze us not so tight.”
Rap! Rap!” beneath the floor!
“Rap! Rap!” outside the window !
And when the hands had finished
“Rap! Rap ! ” inside the door,
With their mysterious play,
We looked away, obedient,
And lo, from out the gloom,
We heard his voice above us,
And far off in the room,
Proclaim “I am uplifted,"
Sceptic-remember HOME!
And some are sure they saw him,
Float through the darkened air,
And others felt his bootikins,
Light on their shoulders bear,
And that he had been flying
We heard bim say, we swear!
Then he bade the lamps be lighted,
And-sceptics to appal-
We found him calmly seated
Where the spirits let bim fall,
And his name upon the ceiling
Pencilled was read by all!
I who have seen these marvels.
I who these raps have heard,
Shall I misdoubt my senses,
Because it seems absurd,
That spirits should take sights at üs,
Or a man fly like a bird?
I sat there in the darkness,
I saw the lights put out;
Felt tables move, heard spirits
Their messages rap ont,
And heard the Medium from mid air
Speaking, rebuke my doubt!
With all this proof conclusive,
Can candid souls remain,
Still crushed beneath the burden
Of bigot reason's chain,
Nor to the mighty Medium
Bow, of believing fain?
What WILLIAM HOWITT vouches
And SAMUEL Carter HALL,
And SIR EDWARD Bulwer LYTTON,
Is surely proved for all-
Though BREWSTER be uncandid
And FARADAY be small.

THERE are many other miser-
able people in the world besides
those whom VICTOR HUGO has so
cleverly been picturing.
How miserable, for instance, are
the eleven hungry guests who by
a stupid social rule are kept wait-
ing for their dinner because the
twelfth-the snob-is late!
How miserable is the man who
having to take his wife and her
two aunts to the Opera, finds him-
self condemned to a back corner
in the box!
How miserable is he who, having
his mauve trousers on, has to ride
inside an omnibus, where each
crinoline that enters leaves a mud
mark on his knees !
How miserable is he who,
when about to pop the question
in the tenderest of whispers, hears
a barrel-organ squeaking the dole-
ful air Love Not!
How miserable is he who, being
told "you see your dinner," eats
two helpings of tough mutton and
then smells a smell of stuffing and
sees brought in a fine goose!
But, as a climax of misfortune,

HARD LABOUR IN HIGH LIFE.
How doth the ever busy PAM
Employ each leisure hour
In journeying from town to town,
Like bee from flower to flower!
How cleverly his tale he 'll tell
Where'er a speech he makes,
Showing how England must excel
While his advice she takes !
While others waste their leisure hours,
Or idly mischief brew,
Pam actively the country scours,
In quest of hearers new.
Thus in hard work his holiday
Is virtuously passed ;
But let us hope a Peerage may
Be his reward at last.

HOMAGE TO BUTLER!
INTELLIGENCE from New York, dated April 3rd, has
delighted the partisans of the North with the statement
that-
A large ovation was given last night by the Loyal League and
the citizens to GENERAL BUTLER, at the Academy of Music."
GENERAL BUTLER might have had an appropriate recep-
tion at the New York Academy of Music, but it is to
be feared that he did not. We believe we may safely say
that his entrance on the scene of harmony was unaccom-
panied by the Rogues' March. Neither can we entertain
the pleasing idea that he received an ovation in any proper
sense of the word. There is no reason to suppose that his
admirers gave him an egging.

HOW TO SAVE CONSCIENCE MONEY.
In an article very justly arguing that the Income
Confiscation ought to be remitted before the Malt Tax is
reduced, the Post makes the following remarkable observa-
tion :-
“Habit leads a man to consider four shillings a pound a legitimate
price for tea, but habit has never yet, and probably never will, recon-
cile a man to the idea that only nineteen shillings and threepence
out of every sovereign which is paid to him is all which he is properly
entitled to call his own."
This is quite true. Nobody has ever been, or ever will be,
reconciled by habit to the idea of deducting ninepence out of
every sovereign which he receives, and laying that money
by in order to pay up the annual sum total as duc for his
Income Tax. It is, however, too much to be feared that
the habit of putting that idea into practice is by no means
so general as it ought to be. No doubt the Income Tax
is, as far as Schedule D goes, a monstrous extortion. Still,
its victims are bound to submit to it, and surrender their
incomes to its entire incidence and operation. If, for
instance, your income is above £200, no matter though
you derive it from a source which will expire in twelve
months, you should punctually pay sevenpence (reduced
by MR. GLADSTONE from ninepence) Income-Tax out of
every pound of it. And besides that, you should deduct
the same sum out of every pound you may casually receive,
and put it by at the time, for fear you should forget it. This
is what you ought to do, though you may see the work.

imposes a tax regardless of equity, that is no reason why,
in paying it, you should disregard arithmetic. Let your
conscientiousness shame the dishonesty of the State; and

In Nature's livery, due at Spring,
The groves bud out, the orchards blow;
Then is the season for the Ring,
The time of year for Rotten Row.
Oh, tell me how a fellow can
On plants and brute creation pore,
When he might go and gaze on man,
And woman's loveliness adore !
Man's highest form, in yonder ride
Affords the critic's eye a feast;
And horse appears in equal pride :
So there you have both man and beast.
And, then, to view each high-born fair
So gracefully direct her steed,
And little bat and habit wear!
That, that's the thing, wealth, birth, and breed.

On a disgraceful object dwell;
Yon pug-nosed costermonger vile,
Compare with any high-bred swell;
Look first on this laborious lass,
And then upon that gentle maid !

their little minds by giving them a lesson in the Athalie of MENDELS-
sohn, which, on that occasion, will be performed more grandly than it
ever yet has been.
A MOST ALARMING QUESTION.
“MR. PUNCH,
“WITH horror and alarm indescribable, I observed, the other
day, under the head of Parliamentary Business in my daily paper, the
following Notice of Motion :-
“SIR J. FERCUSSon. To ask the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER whether there
is any intention of altering the existing machinery by which the assessment for the
Income-Tax is imposed ; and if not, whether that assessment will in future be made
under all the schedules by the local authorities."
“The next day, to my inexpressible relief, I read, in that morning's
paper, that SIR JAMES FERGUSSON having, on the previous night, put
the preceding question, The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said
that there was no present intention of altering the existing machinery
by which the assessment for the Income-Tax is imposed.'
I breathed again.
What I had feared was that SIR JAMES FergUSSON might have
reason to believe that the ordinary inquisitorial machinery, whereby
confessions are extorted under Schedule D., was, (under the provisions
of an Act of Parliament, to be obtained by Ministers for supplying its
inadequacy) to be exchanged for the rack and the thumb-screws. -
Don't say, pooh-pooh! The time has not gone bg for imagining the
possibility of physical torture employed by Government to enforce
unjust taxation. The idea may be ridiculous; but so is the wickedness
of a tax that cuts as much out of the precarious income of an artist,
author, actor, or medical man, as it does out of the life-income of a
placeman, and even out of the everlasting income of a fundholder. I
see no reason why the House of Commons, which enacts so cruel an
imposition, should not further enact that the thumbscrews, and the
rack, and, if necessary, the boots, should be substituted for Income-
Tax papers; or that the assessor, instead of going round with the latter,

A HAIL FROM ADMIRAL NELSON.

CC
VEILED SATIRE.
“I say, Master, jist ring this 'ere Fust-floor Bell for us, will yer ? I can't reach it."
FROM his mast-head gazed the Admiral
Down on Trafalgar Square,
Where from bis base the buttresses
Diverged all blank and bare.
They have got down the hoarding
That screened tbe man and boy:
They have got up the bas-relief's
That formed their life's employ.'
But yet I wait the Lions
That should keep watch below:
Still latent in SIR EDWIN's brain,
Till into bronze they grow.
If Statue pun may venture,
Thus pondered in their plan,
They should be the most ponderous
Lions e'er cast by man.
Had I been long in taking
The guns of which I'm cast,
As they've been slow in making
And rigging up my mast,
BRITANNIA would have grumbled,
My bull-dogs would bave growled;
JOHNNY CRAPAUD been radiant,
While John BULL stormed and scowled.
"What care I if bronze-lion-less
My statue still they leave:
With BRITANNIA'S airy Lion
Beside my empty sleeve.
What bronze can match that lion
Which every Briton sees
When he looks up to my image,
And thinks upon the seas?
“But now the buzz arises
Of a monument to be
To a good Prince and a gracious,
I say-be warned by me!
Heave, oh-with a will, boys-cheerily,
Pay out-hand over hand :
But your course laid down, hold to it
As long as sticks will stand.
“ We sailors have a saying
Of folks with fickle brain,
That they work Tom Cox's traverse,
Of 'there and back again.'
That's John Bull's favourite traverse,
When a public work's in view;
What to-day has done, to-morrow
Takes a pleasure to undo.
“Of Academic artists
Distrust the world allows,
With National Gallery a-starn,
And HAVELOCK 'neath my bows.
I well may venture warning,
Who the contrast have to bear,
Or my Trafalgar battle,
And your Trafalgar Square.
“So here I seize my trumpet,
To try if 'twill avail
With R. A.s and M.P.s, alike
To try a roaring hail.
'Vast heaving, you Committees :
You artists, there, belay!

And MISTER BULL, stop pay.

A LOW STYLE OF NIMROD.
EVERYBODY knows that the Jockey Club has warned "Argus,” the Sporting
Correspondent of the Morning Post, off the Heath at Newmarket for the high
crime and misdemeanor of having called the judicial conduct of the Club in question ;
with considerable reason, as events afterwards proved, for so doing.
The magnanimity of this act of revenge is enthusiastically asserted by a 'wor-
shipper of the Jockey Club in a remarkable letter wbich he writes to the Post
under the signature of “OXONIAN." Who “OXONIAN” is, we need not say;
what he is will be apparent to everybody from the subjoined effusions of his
veneration for that aristocratic body whose nperious treatment of a Member
of the Press he defends. “Without them," he says, "the Turf would soon become
a barbour for thieves, into which no gentleman could intrude without blackening
bis character." Very likely. And what then? Why, then, says " OXONIAN :"
"Surely, then, 'any attempt to sneer at their decisions, or lower their noble influence, by
which alone the 'Turf is preserved from utter corruption, deserves reprobation."
The authority of the Jockey Club is supreme. Its decisions are to be reverenced
as the decrees of Omniscience. Any expression of disrespect for them is pre-
sumptuous, and deserves reprobation.' Does not Oxonian always go down
upon his knees when he ventures to address any person belonging to the Jockey
Club? At any rate he stoops low enough in thus, as it were, blacking, not to say
licking, the boots of that society :-
Even granting that they were not absolutely right in their decision-for no one sets up for
infallibility-still they were more likely to be in the right than your single-handed correspondent.
If humiliation was what galled' Argus,' let him reflect that it were better that our Turf
Reporter should lower his colours than a whole body of Turf reformers."
The Turf Reporter is to knock under to the Jockey Club, even if the Reporter is
right and the Club is wrong. “OXONIAN” concludes the uprighteous flunkeyisms
above cited with a maxim which the reader would naturally suppose to have been
appended to them by Punch:
“Fair-play is a jewel."
Enough has been said to show what “OXONIAN” is. He is a character notorious
enough by name at the University which can scarcely
be proud of him. “OXONIAN"
is evidently a mighty bunter before the nobility. He is, however, no mere Fox-
hunter. The object of his pursuit is not the Brush, but the Tuft.

PROSPECTUS OF A NEW JOURNAL.
IT must be admitted by all, that a new Journal is one of the necessities of the age, that it is imperatively called for, and that there is plenty
of room for it. Actuated by these considerations, the Proprietors of the Journal about to be introduced, beg to announce that on Thursday
the 14th of May (anniversary of the execution of RAVAILLAC by torture), will appear the first number of
The
Sensation Times,
AND CHRONICLE OF EXCITEMENT.
This Journal will be devoted chiefly to the following objects; namely, Harrowing the Mind, Making the Flesh Creep, Causing the Hair
to Stand on End, Giving Shocks to the Nervous System, Destroying Conventional Moralities, and generally Unfitting the Public for the
Prosaic Avocations of Life.
Its columns will be enriched with carefully selected Horrors of every kind, from the English and Foreign newspapers, and with the
most remarkable narratives of what is (perhaps uncharitably) called Criminal Adventure,
The Editors flatter themselves that there is no mock delicacy about them, nor any real delicacy either, and therefore their Subscribers
may be assured that no record of an interesting nature will suffer by any of the fastidious revision which weakens a narrative, or by any of
the timid manipulation which substitutes the hiatus for the description,
Murder, of course, will have in these columns, the foremost place, and the aid of photography will be used in order to present with
an accuracy hitherto unattempted, the most faithful portraits of the actors and victims, and the most vivid representations of the scenes where
such tragedies may be enacted.
But no class of sensational record will be neglected, and readers may rely upon receiving the most graphic accounts of all Crimes with
Violence, merciless Corporal Punishments (especially in the case of children), Revolting Cruelties to Animals, and other interesting matters.
Accidents, if horrific, will also be duly registered.
Arsenical Literature will find in these columns its best exponent, and all Poison Cases will be watched by a staff of special reporters
who have been medically educated. Cases of suspicion will also be treated, and the Editors are happy to say, that they are already in com-
munication with the butlers in several aristocratic families in which it is suspected that persons are endeavouring to dissolve the nuptial
contract without recourse to publicity. This department of the Paper will be under the direction of an eminent sensation novelist, who will
shortly be at liberty under a ticket-of-leave.
A Sensation Novel itself, in which atrocities hitherto undreamed of, even by the most fashionable fictionists of Paris, will form a feature
in the new journal, and a large sum, under the name of a subscription, has been handed to the Society for the Suppression of Vice, in order to
ensure its non-interference with the forthcoming tale.
The Police Courts will be watched, but the columns of the Sensation Times will not be encumbered with the dry details of mercantile
fraud, commonplace larceny, and similar uninteresting matter, and reports will be given of such painful cases only as Paterfamilias, having duly
enjoyed them, tells his family " he thinks they had better not read.”
It is needless to say that the proceedings in the Court over which Sir CRESSWELL CRESSWELL presides will be given in full, where
they have interest, and a distinguished lady novelist has undertaken to do justice to the sentimental features in such cases, points usually
neglected by the hard and cynical male reporter.
Some extraordinary revelations of the habits and actions of exceedingly Low Life will be offered, and a special detective has been
retained in the exclusive interests of the journal.
An eminent Vivisectionist has undertaken to supply a series of papers, setting forth his own experiences in his art, which he will continue
to practise upon various portions of the inferior creation, for the sake of supplying truthful details to the readers of the Sensation Times.
The Editors, fearlessly throwing themselves upon the Public, unhesitatingly embark in an attempt to supply the evident want of the age,
and pledge themselves to spare no efforts in promoting the cause which has hitherto been left to the vigorous but is dequate efforts of the

SOMES'S THREATENED SUNDAY.
(To MONSIEUR VOISIN.) -
MONSIEUR, you envy JOHN BULL his free Press,
Which dares, unchecked, the Government attack,
Although it must-the Judges rule no less-
Not impute quackery to a glaring quack.
Aha! Monsieur, so we enjoy, you see,
A very great deal too much liberty.
Therefore some busy friends of this JOHN BULL,
Called “Ministers of all Denominations,”
And other drolls, of zeal officious full,
Wish to set limits to his recreations,
But most severely to restrict his way
Of passing through his Sunday holiday.
They've shut his own Museum in his face;
They've locked up his own pictures from his view;
But, harder still is Brother Sawney's case,
Excluded from Botanic Gardens, too.
Ob, sin to gaze on foliage coming out!
Plants should on Sunday cease to bloom, no doubt.
And now, Monsieur, these serious buffoons,
Who do the funniest things with gravest faces,
As though possessed with FORBES MACKENZIE's lunes,
With dismal groans and dolorous grimaces,
John Bull, on Sundays, woefully implore
Against himself to close the tavern-door.
Because some brutes are steeped in gin and beer,
Exceptions to the British Workmen's class,
They bid him suffer them to interfere
Between his thirsty lips and moderate glass,
Crying, “Oh, save the Workman from his Pot!”
As if the British Workman were a sot.
Fancy yourself, Monsieur, some Sunday fair,
(Alter you have performed your sacred duties),
Having walked out intent to breathe fresh air,
And feast your eyes upon the country's beauties,
You seek a restaurant's—you cannot dine ;

my family, one to send to Hawarden Castle, and one for myself. Some-
body (I suspect the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY) must have removed
the latter, and I could not procure another copy. I borrowed my
children's, and read that most complete, cogent, convincing argument
against the Club-Tax. Why, why did you not send it me privately ?
The whole case was at once before me. Need I say that I shall abandon

SCHOLARS IN THE ARMY.
THE authorities of the Horse Guards have issued a
programme of the branches of learning in which they
SECOND CLASS.
require every candidate for a direct commission to pass
an examination. Latin and Greek, Mathematics,
English, French, History, Sciences, Drawing. These
are the divisions of human knowledge, in each of which
the candidate is invited to attain proficiency; but he is
absolutely required to be somewhat up in Mathematics,
and in his native language. Henceforth, therefore, it
will be necessary that the head of the British officer
should contain some brains; but the practice of the
military profession essentially consists in exposing brains
to be blown out. Any intelligent brain has a natural
objection to this exposure of itself, and that objection is
overruled by a strong sense of duty when the officer who
feels it remains under fire. Even then it is calculated
to disturb the cool self-possession which it is desirable
for him to maintain.
Courage, your Honours, what is it? May it please
your Honours, courage is the capability of an impulse of
opposition excited by danger, excluding consideration
of the consequences of danger. Its measure is, cæteris
paribus, the excess of combativeness over caution. Your
honours expect an officer in future to know the meaning
of cæteris paribus ; so of course you understand that, in
the case of two men respectively endowed with
caution and combativeness in the same proportions, their
courage will be equal provided that their intellects,
among other things, are also equal; and not else. Other
things being equal, the stupider man will be the
braver.
Your candidate who bas studied the sciences has
learned to forecast the effects of causes. It may be well
that, on duty, an officer should not always think too
much about them. In action, for example, his mind
should not be too keenly alive to the effects of rifle
bullets and cannon shot, and jagged pieces of iron, shell,
on bones, nerves, bloodvessels and viscera. You exact
certificates of preliminary theological attainments.
Except in the case of a military saint, secure of the
future, is knowledge of that kind, attended with belief
in it, likely to augment intrepidity in the cannon's
mouth?
Considering these things, would it not be as well if

In the Book of the Peerage, according to Dod, it is
written that
“ The EARL OF BRIDGEWATER bequeathed large estates to the
present peer's father, LOHD ALFRED, under certain conditions as to
obtaining a new creation of a dukedom or marquisate of Bridgewater
but the House of Lords set aside these conditions in 1853 as being
conditions subsequent' and ' against public policy.'"
If, then, the EARL OF BROWNLOW is now to be created
MARQUIS OF BRIDGEWATER, are we to suppose that the
conditions which, in the case of the noble Earl's father, were
subsequent, have, in that of the noble Earl's father's son,
become antecedent; and that, whereas, in the former case,
they were against public policy, in the latter they jump with
it. These things being supposed, the conclusion must be
that the EARL OF BROWNLOW is a meritorious young
nobleman, who has done the State some service, though we
do not know it.
COINING DISEASES. !
THE Austrian Gazette tells us of a curious case of con-
tagion, communicated by some bank-notes, which a woman,
ill of the small-pox, had been in the habit of keeping in
her bosom. There is some money which seemingly never
does any good, and the finance of Austria must be largely
included in the sum total of what is generally considered as
" bad money." However, we all knew that the Austrian
circulation was in a very unhealthy condition, and the
above fact fully confirms it. There is evidently more plague
than profit about its financial system. As far as our own
feelings are concerned, we must say that an Austrian bank-
Bo
note was one of those things which we never could take to
kindly. We bave such a horror of it, that we never allow
ourselves to touch it by any accident. Whenever we
have done so, we know we have suffered seriously for
it, and have been invariably laid up several days afterwards

GENERAL ROON (MINISTER OF WAR).- I have not the least objection to the Presi-

agitation and loud cries on the Left.) Gentlemen, 350 voices are louder than one. I
demand my constitutional right. According to the Constitution, I may speak when
I please, and nobody has a right to interrupt me.
"Vice-PRESIDENT (repeatedly brandishing his bell). I interrupt the Minister. When
the President speaks all here present must be silent, and all-no matter in what
part of the House they sit-must obey the President. And if anything had really
occurred here which was contrary to the orders of the House, it would have been
my business to reprove it. I did not do so, and consequently the previous speaker
(VON SYBEL) was not out of order. ( Bravo' on the Left, hisses on the Right.) I now
grant the right to speak to the Minister of War.
“Roon. I again protest against the right assumed by the President with respect
to the Government. I mean that his authority extends, as was already on a former
occasion said, up to this table and no further ! (Violent contradiction from the Left,
and hisses from the Right. Great agitation. The Vice-President puts on his hat, and all
the deputies rise, amid loud' Bravos !' from the Left.).
“VICE-PRESIDENT. This means that the sitting is adjourned for an hour. (The
deputies make for the doors of the Chamber; the Minister of War stands still for awhile
looking around him. Then he puts his papers into his portfolio, and quits the Ministerial
table, conversing, as he goes, with the Minister of the Interior, CounT EULENBURG, and
with two staff officers in attendance from the War Office.)" —Scene in the Prussian Parlia-
ment, May 11."
The world has wondered, while Prussia blundered,
What issue time would bring,

Would Ministers put down Members,
Or Members lay Ministers flat,

The difference is plain and pat:
Our English sore came to a Head
Your Prussian to a Hat.
Perhaps you suppose as Swiss freedom rose
From ĠESLER's plumed chapeau,
That after awhile from the Dollfsian tile
Pruss liberty may grow.
But you must be aware, if you come to compare,
This case of resistance with that,
That from bat to man Swiss resistance ran,
While Prussian may end in Hat.

Which you mistake for pluck.

AN ICE YOUNG MAN.

Birthday. All letters treated confidentially. Address (till Monday),
enclosing Carte de Visite, M. S. S., &c. &c.
It just occurs to Mr. Punch that this Young Man is a
decidedly, cool young man, though that may be the result
of his coming to Scotland from India. He says nothing
about himself, except that be is a returned Indian, (which
usually means an awful bore) but he expects young ladies
to send their pictures, and to await his gracious selection.
His Oriental ideas are in a fine state of development. The
advertisement, however, may only be a dodge for the purpose
of filling his photograph book cheaply. If not, we should
not be sorry to hear that he had been invited to an inter-
view at which the other party had been, not a Scotch lassie,
but her masculine relative, who had rewarded our Oriental
friend's impertinence by a process that would not make
him very anxious to sit for his photograph for some little

CONSTITUTIONAL DEMONSTRATION IN
MARYLEBONE.
At a meeting of the Marylebone Vestry, which took
place yesterday, a resolution was voted unanimously, ex-
pressing the sympathy felt by the representatives of the
rate-payers of that important borough, as a deliberative
body, for the Prussian Chamber of Deputies, in the struggle
which that popular assembly is now maintaining for the
defence of its constitutional privileges against the encroach-
ments of the Crown. With that expression of fellow-feeling
for the Prussian Deputies, the Vestrymen of Marylebone
combine an indignant protest against the insolence with
which their brethren of Berlin have been treated by Von
BISMARK, and his Minister of War, Von Roon. They
conclude with a declaration that they would just like to see

The jaw-bone wherewith SAMPSON smote,
We knew (before COLENSO wrote)
Once hung an ass's head on;
But this French jaw is human-one
That wagged beside the Mastodon,
And Mammoth meat has fed on.
Awful to think! This blackened bone,
With all but its one molar gone,
In days before the Flood,
Beef of Bos longifrons did cram,
Hyæna steak or cave-bear ham,
And, p'raps, pronounced it good!

When reason was less rife than rime,

And Welsh antediluvians friz
Amidst perennial_snows.

The things be ate, the sights he saw,
The life he lived reveal,
How he went clad, unclad perhaps,
How carved his meat and picked his chaps,
With flint instead of steel!
Tell what queer molluscs Pleiocene,
Or huge crustaceans Meiocene-
Stood him in oysters' stead,
Or figured in his lobster-salads.
What were primeval bards and ballads ?
What was their board, their bed ?

After these thousand thousand years,

And find one jaw which, silent all,
Geologists can still bid fall
To doubt about its drift.

remarkable Leap in the Annals of Sport.

With teeth and tongue to wag between,
And if they could have wagged !
How many a fame now high were low!
What proof how little 'tis we know,
In spite of all that's bragged.

A Feat of Strength.
A WELL-KNOWN ticket-of-leave man, with a bludgeon in his hand, being pursued
by the Police, at a tremendous pace tore up the pavement of a street which had just
been laid down by the workmen. In spite of his fearful weapon he was ultimately
captured.

Punch never puffs : but Punch may just re-

MR. LUMLEY has, for three nights only (one of
which was Monday last), resumed at Drury
Lane the reins of operatic government, which at

Punch need but state the fact that these three

ensure his having a benefit in the very fullest
sense. Frequenters of the Opera, in the Lindo-

to whom they owe their memories of charming

guineas to the gentleman who introduced that
little lady to our operatic stage. Their little

they will ever have of hearing her, Punch need
say no more to tempt them to the theatre; and
all that Punch need add to ensure its being
crainmed, is to say that MR. LUMLEY never yet
has had a benefit, and is certainly entitled to
have a good one now. And so, ladies and gentle-

A BALLAD ON A BISHOP.
THE BISHOF OF ROCHESTER thinks it's the ticket
To hinder his Clergy from playing at cricket;
That parsons should bowl well, or make many notches, ter-
Rific appears to the BisuOP OF ROCHESTER.
The BISHOP OF ROCHESTER 's awfully skeared
At the thought of the clergymen wearing the beard :
Nor cares for the plea of heretical railer
That they've done it from AARON to JEREMY TAYLOR.
The Bishop prohibits, with Claphamite rigour,
The spring to the saddle, the touch on the trigger,
Nor, Fishers of Men," he remarks,“ do I wish a man
To angle, though PETER, I know, was a fisherman."
To the Bishop a parson, as strong in the arm
As he is in the pulpit, says, “ Pray, may I Farm ?."
No, Sir, you shall breed neither small ewe nor big rain
While I'm your diocesan,” cries DR. WIGRAM.
Replies the bold parson, “ Please, Bishop, to mind
That the Church hath a glebe to the pastor assigned,
Which means he's to farm it: -a brave rara avis
Appears, by the way, this recalcitrant Davies :
Says the Bishop, “Look here: it's reported to me
That you mix with coarse farmers too much, MR. D.”
My Lord, some false notions you've taken aboardship,
I do no such thing, I declare to your Lordship.
“I don't buy or sell. I don't hunt, fish, or sboot.
Won't you leave a poor parson one manly pursuit ?
But the Wisdom of SOLOMON backed by young SIRACI
Would never have moved the inflexible hierarch.

The latter well rammed in his ears must have gotten,
For in periods as swollen as elephantiasis
He turus MR. DAVIES slap out of the diocese.
“ With how little of wisdom in State or in Creed
The world may be governed,” said Axel the Swede,
And this Bishop, who useth episcopal pen so,
Owns he doesn't know Hebrew, but censures COLENSO.
His Brother, the BISHOP OF PUNCHESTER, waits
To see how he'll get out of Davies's Straits ;

POOR POET CLOSE.
THE Poet CLOSE we've often chaffed, :
And bantered sundry times,
Much at his tuneful measures laughed,
And joked upon his rhymes ;
Which when we did, we did not know
That Poet CLOSE was poor,
For then we should not have done so,
As we shall do no more.
Unless we find, what's like enough,
And what will please us well,
Our pen bas served his works to puff,
And make his poems sell;
Then shall we do as we have done,
That people more may buy,
And always go on making fun
Of CLOSE's poetry.
Oh! then shall Poet Close provide
Continual sport for us,
Whenever he shall take a ride
Upon his Pegasus.

sketches of the works in preparation, all of
which of course will be hung "upon the line."
From the brief notes we append, some notion

him the same liquors he tasted in sample, and if he did not have his
bills checked by a firm of accountants, he would be fearfully cheated,

would like to know what other minds suggest. He reads in the report
that-
“Schools with a large number of students' were allowed to enter and form a
separate class, and to have special examinations. Of this privilege DR. YEATS, of
the Upper and Middle Schools at Peckham, had availed himself, and as the result,
the Dean of the College would have the pleasure of introducing, for a certificate of
honour, MR. EDWARD M‘DERMOTT, one of that gentleman's pupils who had earned
that mark of distinction in the discussion of the Principles of Commerce."
Well, MR. EDWARD MÄDERMOTT, you have a certificate of honour,
and Mr. Punch congratulates you. But he particularly begs to know,
either from you, or from your respected instructor DR. YEATS, or from
MR. LLANDAFP WATSON (a doubly episcopal name), who was a prize-
holder in respect of the same study, what you all recommend for the
improvement of Mercantile Morals. How is Mr. Punch to get a gold
chain, a good watch, a cigar of tobacco, honest wine, and accurate bills ?

expresses his excessive approbation, and to which he invites all bis

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A QUESTION FOR THE KING OF
PRUSSIA.
What wants a King, that he may reiga
Without a Constitution,
And gag the Press if it complain,
Yet fear no revolution,
His realm though he should isolate
From each enlightened nation,
Subserving one barbaric state
With base co-operation ?
He wants an army staunch and strong,
Resistance prompt to stifle,
Support him, and enforce his wrong
With bayonet and rifle.
Obey their Monarch's will as law
Superior to all other,
The trigger at bis bidding draw,
And shoot down sire and brother.
He wants dragoons, to override
Their kinsmen, friends, and neighbours,
And right divine, by homicide
Impose with ready sabres ;
And wealth he wants, to keep in pay
His host of gladiators,
And hold them true to him as they
To Fatherland are traitors.
To keep disfranchised subjects down,
O Majesty of Prussia !
Whilst you with law below your crown,
Betray the Poles to Russia,
May give the army, you require
Some work; and you may rue it:
Have you one big enough, then, Sire,
And base enough to do it ?

We are sorry to record a sad accident that happened during the past week, in
one of the Great Matches at Lord's. A well-known long-stop attempted to make
a catch. The ball, however, which was travelling at a fearful speed, passed right
through his hands. We fear that he will not show in the field for some time.
Another Casualty.-A distinguished member of the Quidnuncs while getting his
band in by practising a catch, put out his arm.
The Tice. - The Tice is almost a full pitch, and will take the player by surprise,
especially if he has had no-tice beforehand.
Style Bowling. - Round-arm bowling is undoubtedly English, but Gend'arme
bowling is peculiarly French.
Running –When you've made a hit, rụn; it doesn't matter where, go anywhere
as long as you only run. The invariable rule for a batsman is,
Cut and run.
Leg Hits.-Cricketers, who disdain the protection of pads, must consider every pain-
ful blow caused by receiving the ball upon their ancles, as a punishment for their shins.
Out.-At the commencement of every innings the umpire shall call “play.'
According to the rules of polite cricketing society, if anyone is “out,” the umpire
must call again.
Trap and Ball. - This is one of the sole amusements permitted to the Austere
Trappists. Hence the name. Perbaps Brother IGNATIUS, of Claydon, may get a
hint from this. The game adapted for a Mother and her Daughters versus Paterfa-
milias is thus played : Let Mamma and her feminine offspring lay a trap for Papa
in order to get him to give a Ball. If he gives one, the petticoats win, although,
it may chance, that the younger daughter of the house will come out. A good
ball thus given is never entirely thrown away, as it will be returned by one or more
of the guests.
Croquet.- Grand match at this exciting game will be played, during the ensuing
month, by the ladies of England, on the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY's lawn.
We warn our fair readers that if during the game of Croquet the grass is damp,
they will find themselves very croaky next morning. We anticipate a glorious
example of Fair play.
The Turf.-At Exeter Hall it was lately stated that very Correct Cards were
never seen at races. We, in our capacity of “Noble Sportsman” deny it.
Racing.-Several horses in training for Goodwood, at Hitchin, have been
scratched.
CRAWLEY AND LILLEY.
WHEN your flesh seems to creep and grow chill,
As if something was nigh to appal ye,
The mysterious presage of ill
Folks describe by the words “I felt CRAWLEY.”
But henceforth that word “CRAWLEY” should move
More horror in blood and in breath,
As tbe name of the Colonel who drove
SERGEANT-MAJOR JOHN LILLEY to death.
'Twas an old Greek belief that there lay
In men's names omen true of their lives,
And from CRAWLEY and LILLEY, we say,
The Greek doctrine some countnance derives.
How the name "CRAWLEY” calls up the thought
Of some slow, slimy, cold, creeping thing,
Big with venom, to wrath slowly wrought,
And with all of its strength in its sting:
Of the adder coiled under the stone,
Of the slow-worm tbat crawls in the dust,
All that prompts every heel to tread down,
Or raises each gorge in disgust;
of the wriggling circuitous coil
As the creature approaches its prey ;
Or, its game if the by-stander foil,
Of its dart to concealment away;
The quick double tongue in its head,
The gleam of its cold cruel eye,
The foul fetid slaver o'erspread
The victim 'twill crush by-and-by.
Then “LILLEY”- the name seems to breathe
Of purity, sullied in vain ;
Of the flower that thy tombstone should wreathe,
Good soldier-a name without stain.
With that emblem the Church doth endow,
Her martyr-confessors of fame,
And a true soldier-martyr wert thou,
Though humble thy rank and thy name.
Dying man-dying wife-let them lie,
Close-pent in their casemate of doom,
Night and day ’neath the sentinel's eye,
Though the sun to white-beat fire the room,
Till stilled is the labouring breath,
And the fevered blood clots in the brain,
And the stout soldier 's freed by grim death
From arrest, and from anguish, and pain.
Lay him down; his wife will not be long,
Ere she shares his cool grass-covered bed;
But, that nought may be lacking to wrong,
Write “Drunkard

And for proof-here's the long brandy score.
Filteen quarts in the month! Did he swim ?
True, the doctor prescribed it for her,
But 'twill back up the charge against him!

Nor the Horse Guards itself can deny,
But must think of the ill-fated bird,
Stricken dead 'neath the snake's cruel eye?
What man with the heart of a man
But feels his blood tingle and glow,
With the longing to do what he can
To bring this iniquity low?,
What man with the heart of a man
But feels the blush burn like a brand,
Reading how this wrong-doer is left
“On trial,” but still in command ?
On trial! This heart hard as stone,
Whose sin no excuses can leaven!
This accused-whose accuser has gone
With his wrongs to the High Court of Heaven!
On trial! This tyrant whose bate

Will it Wash?
The Americans have discovered the power of manufacturing washable bank-notes.
The secret, it appears, consists in covering the paper (Green-backs, or otherwise),
with a solution of india-rubber. This may, in one sense, tend to an expansion of their
credit; only they must not over-stretcli this easy solution of getting out of their
difficulties. However, this washable process throws into tbeir bands a very tempting
means of wiping off their liabilities. It is the only probable source, we see, of
liquidating their enormous National Debt. A bit of sponge, and the thing is done

OUR VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION.
In the course of his speech in a case in the Queen's
Bench, the other day, MR. COLERIDGE, who is pot in the
habit of exaggerating, or speaking without knowledge, said -
“There were noble personages who were the pride and flower of
the land-who were truly the leaders of the people—whose lives
adorned the history of the country, and whose great station naturally
made them the thinkers and actors in all matters that tended to
the development of the material and intellectual resources of the
country.”
This, of course, was literally true, and LORD Punch is
the pride and flower of them all. But-
“ But on the other hand there were noblemen who were a scandal
and a disgrace to tbeir order, and a discredit to society, whose high
rank only made their vices and crimes the more notorious, and uni-
versally detested-men of bad hearts and base minds, and who used
their influence, their power, and their authority for dishonourable
and licentious pursuits, to oppress the poor, and corrupt the innocent."
Good gracious, MR. COLERIDGE, you don't say so? We
wouldn't have believed it, if any less respectable authority
than yourself had told us. You shock us more than you
can conceive. We thought that all the
nobility were perfect
persons, and we are quite sure that Mrs. Fitz-JONES, of
Gentility Square, thinks so, and will deem your remarks
most incalled-for, ungenteel, and what she calls obnoxious.
She wishes you would not say these things, disparaging her
betters, whose footmen look so grandly beautiful in the Park
that she is sure you cannot be speaking the truth. Pray,
COLERIDGE, please to moderate the rancour of your tongue,
and do not try to make us believe that any coronet is other
than the best gold and purest jewels. Dross and paste,
indeed! MR. COLERIDGE, you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LUUT
NORTHERN PROCLIVITIES.
ACCORDING to the Journal de St. Peters.
bourg, PRINCE GORTSCHAKOPF has addressed
to MR. CLAY a despatch expressing the satis-
faction of the Czar at the reply of MR.
SEWARD to the proposal of France, that the
American Government should join the diplo-
matic intervention in favour of Poland. Tbat
invitation appears to have been declined by
MR. SEWARD, in language which, of course
regulated by all the politeness of diplomacy,
in effect informed the French Government
that the Yankees would see Poland hanged
first. As they themselves say, that's a fact;
and, says GORTSCHAKOFF :-
“ Such facts draw closer the bonds of sympathy
between Russia and America. The EXPEROR knows
how to appreciate the firmness with which MR.
SEWARD maintains the principle of non-intervention."
The bonds
of sympathy between Russia and
the Federal States appear to be those of bond-
age, in which the great autocracy on the one
hand, and the considerable Republic on the
other, want to retain peoples who claim inde-
pendence. MR. SEWARD could consistently
do no otherwise than maintain the principle
of non-intervention between Russia and
Poland. Does he not expect that, in the
subjugated South, Yankeedoodledom will
soon have a Poland of its own ?

STUCCO-STRICKEN.
(4. Chaunt for KELK AND LUCAS.)
BOTHER that Pam, what did he mean
By talking about stucco?
The word is dinned in people's ears,
And rings like note of cuckoo.
Had he gone in, the building praised,
With his accustomed pluck, oh
The House had voted “Buy, buy, buy," —
But to fall back on stucco !
Of terra-cotta had be talked,
Or to mosaic stuck, oh
The purchase-plan had ne'er been baulked,
As 'tis by talk of stucco.
The vision rose of brick first spread
With garb of sable muck, oh,
Soon to be shabbily arrayed
With short-lived coat of stucco.
One long balf-mile of villa-front
The House with horror struck, oh,
Not even Patience in a punt
Could swallow so much stuceo.
In summer suns 'twill peel and go,
The winter rains 't will suck, oh,
From MADAME RACHEL's bills we know !
The cost of mending stucco.”
So round the House the whisper's dropped,
Reiterate as the cuckoo-
And our defender's mouths are stopped
With stucco, stueco, stucco !
PROPOSAL FOR A CAT SHOW.
We have had a Dog Show: and when the new Security from Violence
Bill has passed into law, it is to be presumed that we shall have a Cat
Show. An exhibition of the cats (each provided with nine tails), which
are to be laid upon the backs of the garotters, and are to scarify the
savages who bruise and beat their wives, will probably be held as soon as
the Bill passes, and will doubtless be productive of very good effects.
The exhibition should be held as publicly as possible, and placards
should be posted in all the courts and alleys, "rents," " buildings," and
back-slums, inviting the attendance of all ruffians to inspect it. The
cats should be displayed in their most ferocious aspect, and particular
attention be requested to their tails: the notice of the observer being
specially directed to their flexible condition, and the bigness of their
knots. "It wonld be well too if a boatswain's-mate attended at the
show, to explain the actual way in which the cats were used, and give
a vivid picture of the feelings they produced. For this purpose a lay
figure might be put up to be fogged, that the visitors might see how
very pliably the cat tails intertwined about the ribs, and what cruel lace-
rations they were able to inflict. Coloured models might be added also,
taken from the life, to show the actual condition of men who have been
flogged: and, to add to the effect, large drops of waxen blood might
drip at stated intervals, after the manner of the miracle of the good
Saint Januarius.
By attention to these hints, which might easily be amplified, the Cat
Show might be made a most instructive exhibition : and many a brutal
ruffian might be bettered by inspecting it.
A Joke by a German.
A GERMAN friend of ours has made a little joke in English, and as an
encouragement to other foreign students of our language, we spare our
friend an inch of our immortal print. Some one was talking of a brewer
who had married a young lady related to 'a peer, when our friend
remarked, " Ah, yes, a very broper match. Of jource a brewer ought
to be connected with the Beerage.”
