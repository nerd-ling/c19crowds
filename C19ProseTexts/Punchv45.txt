THE SCENE represents the most unapproachable of all MR. PUNCH's deep solitudes and awful cells. He has, after a
slight refection, comprising some oyster soup, a wild duck artistically sauced, and a few glasses of “victorious
Burgundy,” retired to meditate, nec sine fumo, upon his own goodness and greatness, the folly of mankind, the
chances of the pantomimes being good, and other Christmas topics. To think the more profoundly, he has closed
his illustrious eyes to material objects.
A Voice. MR. PUNCH !
Mr. Punch (opening his eyes). He hears with ears, as my friend BILLY-(opening his eyes very wide indeed, and then
immediately recovering his miraculous self-possession)—as You say; and how do you do, my dear WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE P
and I am very glad to see you, if I do see you, and mine eyes are not made the fools of the other sentences, as you say.
Shakspeare (appears in a chair, opposite). Did I say sentences? It seems nonsense; but the Commentators have so
bewildered me, that I forget what I wrote.
Mr. P. I forget nothing that you wrote; and shall, while memory holds her seat in this distracted orb,
Shak. (musing). What did I mean by that, now P The world, or the man's head P
Mr. P. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, but make thyself as comfortable as possible. Wilt drink up Esil, eat a
crocodile; or is there any other refreshment I can offer you?
Shak. I should like a smoke.
Mr. P. The fatal instrument is in thy hand. (And, by PUNCH magic, the Poet is instantly seen smoking a noble pipe.)
Shak. My lad, I will tell you what I am about.
Mr. P. Four yards and more.
Shak. Nothing is so offensive as an inappropriate quotation, dragged in merely to show that you have learned it.
Mr. P.. I am tame, Sir; pronounce.
Shak. It appears that I am to come to London next year, to be praised, and honoured, and commemorated.
Mr. P. What imports the nomination of this, Gentleman P
Shak. I will tell you presently. Of course, I feel the compliment, and all that; but, inasmuch as I consider you my
representative, not to say legitimate successor, I shall take no step without consulting you,
Mr. P. Your wisdom should show itself the more richer to consult itself only, which indeed is the root, source, and
ever-springing fountain of discretion. But of course, if I can put you up to anything, put a name to it.
Shak. I suppose that I am to have a Statue. Where are you going to place it
Mr. P. Why, you see that you were so unmindful of posterity as to write plays for theatres that stood in a quarter
which no civilised person now knows. I believe that it is covered with warehouses. Argal, we must beckon you to a
more removed ground.
Shak. Certainly. I am the last person to be honoured by archaeological pedantry of any kind. If ever there was a

man of the world, I am one. But there goes reason to roasting of eggs. The monument ought to be on a site which I
have made memorable, and also where all the world can see it.
Mr. P. Sir, your reasons are sharp and sententious, pleasant without scurrility, audacious without impudency—
Shak. If I remember aright, the Temple is near this place. - -
Mr. P. Very. So please you, we will finish our tobacco there, or as you say, smoke the Temple with our sacrifices.
Shak. Nay; sit still, and perpend. Do you know the First Part of HENRY THE SIXTH P
Mr. P. Sir, I am much deceived but I remember the style. Shall I recite the play ?
Shak. At your peril. But you may recollect that the Fourth Scene of the Second Act is laid in the Temple Garden,
and that SoMERSET and PLANTAGENET and the other nobles pluck the white and red roses, and that I thus set out before
the eyes of the audience the origin of the great war.
Mr. P. Sir, its definement suffereth no perdition in you. The scene is one of the most significant in your volume,
and hath a national interest for every Englishman.
Shak. Then I think that it will be hard to find a better site for the Memorial than in the Temple Garden, which is
seen from the river, and will be seen from the embankment.
Mr. P...And thy advice this night I'll put in practice, and—as you say—"break into the Press” with the hint.
Shak. Thank you, in advance, for undertaking the trouble.
Mr. P. The labour we delight in physics pain. And how do you get on in Elysium ?
Shak. (slightly yawning). Well, the yellow meads of asphodel and amaranthine bowers are very delightful places—
couldn't be more so, I'm sure—but when one has heard everything that everybody has to say—you understand P
JMr. P. Bone º: bene) intelligo, Domine. PRIscIAN a little scratched—"twill serve. The fact is that for a Party
who exhausted worlds and then imagined new, the Fields may be a limited sphere.
Shak. Put it that way, if you like, or any way, but comprehend that one can't be always hearing WIRGIL say over
the Æneid, or be always laughing at LucIAN's Dialogues.
Mr. P. What need the bridge much broader than the flood? I see your drift, MR. Divine WILLIAMs.
Shak, Why then rejoice therefore.
Mr. P. Who's quoting himself now? Well, Sir, be you patient, it may be I have that may serve your turn.
Shak. You seem to be getting very drowsy. '
Mr. P. A heavy summons—sits—like lead—upon me. I don't find—it easy to—talk, Speak—yet again, not all
thy—former tale—but this one word—whether thy tale be true.
Shak. Extremely incoherent and irrational. I shall leave you to yourself.
Mr. P. Sit down—and feed—and welcome to—our table. I will show you a chamber and a bed—
Shak. Really, Mr. Punch 1
Mr. P. Well—if you must go—sweetest morsel of th' night—leave unpicked—take this book—and read it—and
it will make your Elysée—Elysium I mean—very happy. Read it, WILLIAM (weeps), don't read it for an age but for all
time-and let poor old VIRGIL see it—and LucAN—not LoRD LucAN, you know, we call him LucKUN,-and LUCIAN,

I'm afire, I’m burning, I'm——(Recovers his senses, and his composure, and smiles.) I've dropped that baccy and
burned a hole in my trousers. That’s certain. I must have taken forty winks. I thought BILLY SHAKSPEARE was here,
and, talking about his Statue. And that he was bored, and to confort him I was going to give him—nothing ridiculous
in that, though, indeed a very clever notion, and I’ll drink my own health and a merry Christmas to myself for it (does
so.) Good Burgundy that—ha! haſ I was going to give MASTER SHAkspeaRE my
forty-fift tolumt.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MON DAY, June 22nd. Parliamentary swearing causes a º deal of
trouble. LoRD STRATHEDEN wishes to alter the Oath-law, which
has º been modified (in favour of the Hebrews), by resolution only,
His Bill was read, but is not to be proceeded with this year. The proud
yet prudent Peers properly passed the provision for pressing priests on
Popish prisoners.
MR. CowPER said that the New Palace at Westminster had not yet
fallen into the Thames, but that sufficient time had not elapsed for dis-
covering whether M.R. SZERELMEY’s application would continue to pre-
serve the stone. CoLoREL CRAwLEY is recalled, to be tried by Court
Martial in this country.
Russia has sufficient grace left to hasten to declare that MoURAVIEFF
(who is not the brave soldier of Kars) has not yet issued an order for
the knouting of Polish ladies, but our Government has information
confirmatory of the accounts of other brutalities.
To-night there was to have been a grand Polish debate, and MR.
Pope HENNEssy, who is all for freedom and humanity when the victim
is a Catholic, was charged with an oration. LoRD PALMERSTON,
According to promise, moved the orders of the day out of the honourable
Pope's way, when private Members suddenly interfered, and MR.
BEAUMONT, M.R., KingLAKE, and LoRD, ENPIELD desired him to be
silent. And the House, dividing, decided by 165 to 110 that he should
hold his tongue, as it was inexpedient to raise such a debate in the
present state of negotiations. Then did HoRsMAN rage, and Robert
CEGIL epigrammatise, and MR. CoNINGHAM, make irreverent allusion
to the readiness of Ministers to discuss a Court Job at Kensington,
though they avoided important questions. Other men clamoured, but
the PREMIER, rising, declared that the decision of the House had
astonished him as much as º that he had seen no objection to
debate, though addresses on the Polish question, might, if carried, have
stopped negotiation, but that he would reveal to the House what the
Powers had recommended Russia to grant; namely—
1. A general and complete Amnesty.
2. National Representation under the Treaty of Vienna.
3. A satisfactory Polish administration, and the placing Poles alone
in public offices. ,
4. Full Liberty of Conscience.
ā. Use of the Polish language in public transactions, and education.
6. A regular and fair system of recruiting, unlike Conscription.
WOL. xi,W.
The Powers have also recommended a cessation of hostilities. On the
subject of cruelties the Wiscount said that the Russians were very bar-
barous, but that reprisals were committed. MR. DISRAELI, of course,
did not think that *. debate had been stopped without Government
sanction. He did not see how hostilities were to be ended, while the
Russian Government had no communication with the insurrectionists,
and he saw only two alternatives, Russian Unity or Polish Independ-
ence. After further discussion it was arranged that no more should be
said until we have the reply of Russia. -
The South side of the #. is to be embanked, legislation on the
subject Fº and as you would like, MRs. BULL, to know how
beautiſully the Men of Business mind your business, we would just
mention that in the clause jº" Board of Works to borrow
money, the figures inserted were £700,000. MR. Cox thought this too
much, and MR. CowPER said, O yes, the figures must have been
inserted by mistake, and he would alter them to £481,000. What do
you think of that trifling error, M’m ?
Tuesday. Orders have been sent to the Ionian Isles that their present
Parliament be dissolved, and a new one be convoked, before which is
to be laid the proposal to hand them over to Grecian GEORGE. -
The West Hartlepool Harbour Directors seem to have been acting
with splendid unlawfulness, and laying hold of millions of money.
The Thunderbolts of the flaw, launched by the Government, are to
descend upon the wicked — it technicalities will permit. More Men
of Business, and Business in excelsis.
. There are also women of business whose arrangements must belooked
into. Public indignation has been excited by the accounts of the death
of MARY ANNE WALKLEY, a girl employed by MADAME, ELISE, of
Regent Street, wife of one Isaacson, and a notorious dressmaker,
“Long hours in an overcrowded room and sleeping in an ill-ventilated
bedroom,” said SIR GEORGE GREY, “caused the young girl's death.”
What is to be done? LoRD SHAFTesbury in the Lords, and MR.
BAgwell in the Commons, called attention to the system under which
such girls are killed; and the man Isaacson, who seems to fill a similar
office to that of Mr. Mantalini, and who writes. English of which that
gent would be proud, issued a letter full of impertinence and bad
grammar, in defence of MRs. Isaacson's place. Thereupon the parish
requested other testimony, and DR.I.ANKESTER examined the premises,
and found the dormitories rather better and the work-room rather
worse than had been expected.

attractions of the crypt by playing a hurdy-gurdy there.
An Irish debate in the Commons. The old nonsense about, Tenant:
right, met by the old sense about Communistic doctrines, and the r
opinion of the House tested by the division, which showed 128 to 49.
Wednesday. The Dissenting army, under GENERAL BouverIE, once
more retires, for strategical reasons. The Confederate Universities
have repulsed the attack upon the fellow-ships. MR, HADFIELD is
much wounded. MR. GöschEN, the new Member for London, came
under fire for the first time, and behaved well. -
If, contrary to orders, a servant takes oats out of his master's bin,
and gives them to his master's horses, the servant is by law a felon.
MR. STANILAND, finding it difficult to get convictions in this state of the
law, proposes to let the evil servant off with three months' imprison-
ment for slight offences. This is a wise mitigation. But iſ a servant
takes Madeira out of his master's bin, and gives it to himself, and it is
such Madeira as Mr. Punch keeps in the deep solitudes and awful cells
under 85, Fleet Street, (only nobody else can get such,) we incline to
think that the offence should be High Treason. -
The Board of Admiralty is not to be inquired into this year. Threat-
ened Boards job long.
Another muddling meddling attempt to arrange the Hampstead
Heath question was defeated. But something ought to be done, for
the next SIR. Thomas WILsoN “whose Christian name is JoHN’’ will
be able to enclose the Heath in spite of you all. See here. London
has clearly a beneficial interest in the life of SIR THoMAs, why not
assure his life for a vast sum, and therewith buy the Heath of his
successor P LORD CHELMSFORD, next night, introduced into a Real
łº Bill, now before the Lords, the clause which has so often been
tried in favour of SIR THOMAs, and this will be duly excised by the
House of Commons. Look out, LORD ENFIELD–it is fit that Enfield
Chase should protect Hampstead Heath.
Thursday. The Lords removed from the Volunteers' Bill the power
of taking sites. Do their Lordships think the practice vulgar?
The poor dress-making girl’s case came up again, and MR. BAGwBDL
wished that MADAME ISAACson-ELISE and her delightful husband
should be prosecuted for, cruelty. SIR GEORGE GREY was not in a
fº to say whether the facts were º obtain a conviction.
e would inquire. The ventilation of the subject will at least improve
the ventilation of other work-rooms beside those of MADAME
ISAACSON.
There was discussion on the other painful case—that of LILLEY, and
some Members urged the great expense of holding the Court Martial
here, while others thought it an insult to the Indian army to suppose that
the trial of Colon EL CRAwley would not be fairly conducted in India.
MR. CAVENDISH BENTINCR objects to the sixpence charged at St.
Paul's for showing the Wellington Car., M.R. CowPER said that the
charge was for taking care of visitors to the dark crypt. MR. Osbor NE
jested at the car, and recommended MR. CowPER to increase the
LISE-
answer to taunts at many foolish things is, that they are harmless, and
that harmless people are interested by them. The whole world is not
composed of gentlemen of faultless manners, patrician, polish, and
exquisitely refined taste, like MR. BERNAL Osbor NE. -
Toney votes followed, with the usual girds at the National Gallery
pictures, and those in the Portrait Gallery. SIR F. BARING is shocked
that the gallant CAPTAIN WILMot should have visited a Sovereign like
the KING OF DAHOMEY, who daily murders, his subjects. Wii Sin

The House gave leave to borrow a Million and a fifth of a Million in aid
of Lancashire. The Tories to-day won Lisburn by a large majority.
Friday. LoRD SHAFTESBURY walked into Bedlam—we don't mean
physically, but in the way of showing up the wretched mismanagement
of noble charity. Returns were ordered, and the managers of the
aSylum

had better set their house in order. LoRD Russell said that he had
not changed his opinion as to recognition of the Southern States. If the
invasion by LEE prove successful, the next thing will be PRESIDENT
ſº demand not only that we recognise the South, but “cut” the
orth.
The Commons had a long Scotch debate about the woman
M“LAchlan. The LoRD ADvoCATE said that the upper classes in
Scotland had been against her and the lower classes for her, and
that immediately on the reprieve , the storm had shifted. Some
well-put comparisons of English and Scotch jurisprudence made the
debate not altogether uninstructive. The character of the Church of
Ireland, and its efficacy as a spiritual teacher and a missionary, then
came on, and as the subject is one of a comic nature, it was appropriately
taken up by M.R., BERNAL Osborn E, who excited roars of laughter.
MR. CARDWELL thought the matter should be treated more seriously,
but he has old-fashioned notions. The debate was adjourned, but we
suppose that it will end in the referring this Church subject to a Select
Committee, consisting of LoRn DUNDREARy, MR. PAUL, BEDFORD,
MR. BERNAL Osbor NE, MR. Buckstone, and (by way of justice to
Ireland) MR. Toole.

What business is it of yours, under corsage and berthe to stare?
What am I doing here with my tibia and thighbone clean?”
Who are you dares push your question past the bounds of Črinoline ?,
You don't mean to say the skull peeps out under wreaths of the rose

Qr that the rouge isn't thick enough to hide the sigmoid bone?
Have you no consideration—no proper feeling at all—
To annoy people by reminding łł. that Death is at the ball?
It’s true I wasn’t invited, not, at least, in my own name;
But I must presume that Madame la Mort is welcome, all the same.
And not at the Guards' Ball only, but wherever twinkling feet,
Bright eyes, and glossy tresses, and brilliant toilettes meet.
But *::: so welcome as when with train, diamonds, lappets and

Entre nous, ’tis I who have more to do than most people are aware
With these rapissantes toilettes that these charming creatures wear;
There's scarce a house of business, that a West End connection boasts,
But Madame la Mort is there to keep the young ladies at their posts.
I’m at home in the crowded work-rooms, where my pupils their needles
ly;
Let mº, throb and brains go round, so no fingers idle lie.
I’m at home in the up-stairs dormitory, where the sleep lies heavy as
lead;

They come up frºm the country so gamesome, so fresh, and full of glee;
At first sight of this pale face of mine they’ll have nothing to say to me.
They're not aware 'tis my place to sit among the young ladies still; ;
But the weaker ones soon draw to me; they’re very often ill.
Some take to me so kindly—and lay their cheeks to mine,
As a child its face to its mother's will lovingly incline:
Sºme struggle hard to keep me at arm's length; but in the end,
They learn that, after all, I’m their best and staunchest friend,
Poor dears! Where'er º enter while thus they work and sleep,
To my house of business, after all, they’re but too glad to creep.
o no wonder if I’m privileged º my employers fair
To visit the scenes which I furnish with these toilettes rich and rare.

Had a subject they used to call “ La Danse Macabre” long ago;
In which—like pauriens as they are, those artists—they made free,
With all conditions of life, as, at last, being led away by me.
I should like to suggest to our painters—(we’ve some clever ones they

On the one side the House of Pleasure; scene, the ball-room; and

comfort in the operation, it would be the first time, since its erection,
that the building had ever been magnified.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
\
THE SPEKE-AND-GRANT NIGHT.
sents Mr. Punch as
he intended to ap-
pear, enlightening
the scientific world
at the Geographical
Society's meeting in
honour of CAPTINGs
SPEKE and GRANT.
That picture (vide
end of this article),
represents him as he
did appear under the
circumstances here-
on this picture and
on that.
The other Monday
might, as everybody
knows, the Society
met to receive the
brave SPEKE and the
bold GRANT, the
heroes of the Nile,
on their return to
England. Mr. Punch,
though he had al-
ready struck.a Car-
toon Medal in their
honour, of purer gold than the medal very properly sent by KINGVicroR,
and though he had!". their noble exploits in Pindarics of undying
glory, had determined, for once, to go into that most ugly and uncomfort-
able room at Burlington House, and add his shout to the applause of the
geographers. Judina must have unguardedly mentioned this, and the con-
sequence was, that the public began to assemble at the preposterous hour
of 5, and when Mr. Punch's fiery horses dashed into the area at 8:30, the
room was crammed, and the loveliest ladies in the world in white Bur-
mands, Bernooses, what do you call 'em, were perched on the window
cills, and on chairs, vainly trying to see into the chamber, while others
iovelier sti , were wandering about the area, and scolding their natural
protectors for not making them come sooner. The celebrities in that
yard on that º: as plentiful as the lack of ALDERMAN SID-
NEY’s aitches, and the police, utterly bewildered, gave up anything like
keeping guard, so that the public rushed into the sacred enclosure,
chaffed the philosophers, and withdrew their handkerchiefs. The porter
had enough to do to keep the windows from being broken, and could not
even do that, for ever so many panes were smashed by an infuriated long
young Irishman with a bald head, who revenged his being thrust down
from the cill, and the detention of his hat, by demolishing the windows
with a ladder, for which act Mr. Punch, and the ladies who were
stifling inside, much praised the ardent youth.
Mr. Punch lit a cigar, and walked about between a small Duke and a
great Publisher, telling them where the Nile was, and soon, until it was
announced to him that his friend, SIR. Roderick MURCHIson, had
concluded an address. -
“Now, my noble friends, I shall goin,” said Mr. Punch, and he
rushed upon the people at the door, like the Armed Man in the Pilgrim’s
Prºgress. But, willing as they were to make way, it was impossible.
“At least tell us what you can see,” said Mr. Punch to a gasping
nobleman who was nearly in. -
“I see a black boy with a Persian cap on,” said the gasping noble-
Iman.
Persicos odi, puer, apparatus,”, said Mr. Punch, to the joy and
delight of the crowd. “Well, I will try elsewhere.”
e ran along under the windows, and white hands were held out to
him, and soft voices and bright smiles invited him to climb. Half the
aristocracy hurried to give him a back up, or a leg up, or anything that
would aid him in mounting. -
“Let me exert my own energies,” said the gallant Mr. Punch, with
a -natured smile. -
ou will behold the result in the delineation opposite sketched on the
spot by an artist whom he had expressly taken there at a vast expense
of Cavendish.
Finally he got in, and perching himself in mid air, like an intellectual
LeoTARD, he heard the long applause which greeted the brave CAPTAIN
SPEKE, and beheld that conqueror rise, and modestly prepare to narrate
the achievements of himself and friend.
* Bravo, SPEKE!” roared Mr. Punch, nearly tumbling into the room,
in his energetic demonstration. “Bravo, GRANT: "
“Remove that person,” said SIR Roperick Murchison.
“Bravo, MURCHIsox 1° cried Mr. Punch, returning good for evil.
“Bravº, black boy! Bravo, everybody!”
*Will you be quiet?” said the Bishop of Oxford.
His Picture repre- N
inafter related. Look |h
“Bravo, Bishop!'” shouted Punch. “How's ColeNso?”
“I say, my dear Mr. Punch,” said MR. LAYARD.
º º Under Secretary 1” bellowed Mr. Punch, like a Bull of
ineven.
“My dear friend,” said MR. GLADstone, “there are three courses
open to you; to stop and be silent, to go away, or to be removed by the
police. Now I am free to confess—”
“Bravo! GLADSTONE!” exclaimed the irrepressible Mr. Punch. He
would, in his enthusiasm for science, have gone on shouting until now,
for the meeting was in convulsions, and a policeman, who respectfull
approached from outside to lay hold of his leg, was met by one wink
which sent him roaring into Piccadilly.
At that mºment there leaned towards Mr. Punch, the youngest and
loveliest of all the angelic beings who were presented to the Princess at
the last Drawing-room. The exquisite being was perched on a happy
chair, and her tiny right hand rested on the happier shoulder of her
º the EARL of what business is it of yours what Earl
e 1s
“I wish, dear,” she whispered, laying her fairy left hand on Mr.
Punch's arm, “that you would let me hear CAPTAIN Speke.”
“Do you,” said. Mr. Punch, with that exquisite melting tenderness
of tone which has broken so many hearts and mended 'em afterwards
till they looked as good, as new, and better. “I am dumb. SPEKE,
speak. Cigar in the Albany afterwards, and bring GRANT.”
"Lipopper sumerang boomerang dak jopps lohwhackee yowl tipsi-
rainiferos,” said CAPTAIN Speke, which means in the Unyoro dialect,
“I am far from delighted at being lionised in this fashion, but the
thought of seeing you afterwards will keep me up to the mark, you old
hippºpotamus.” - -
“Snagdol bokins wimpole bifudder,” added CAPTAIN GRANT, who is
a man offew words.
“Of course, both L.L., and poteen,” replied Mr. Punch. “Go it,
my Nilometers,” he added, and with one glance of intense admiration
at his lovely neighbour, he sprang, with a Professor Wilsonic leap over
the heads of the circumambient peerage, and rushed away to his West
End Chambers. -

everywhere, and there is not a subject he touches, but what he turns
politically to profit. He is the most successful of all travellers, and
seems to succeed best in difficult exploits, in which others have failed.
We wish him “Bon Poyage” in every fresh journey he heroically
undertakes.

PLEASANT.
Friend (to Novice at Salmon Fishing). “I SAY, OLD Boy, MIND. How YoU WADE; THERE ARE some TREMENDous Holes, FourTEEN or
FIFTEEN FEET DEEP.”
OUR SUFFOCATED SEMPSTRESSES.
THERE are no slaves in England, oh dear no, certainly not. It is true
we make our milliners work fifteen, hours a day, and twenty-four upon
emergencies, but then of course you know their labour is quite voluntary.
That is to say, the girls—we beg pardon, the “young ladies”, who
slave—we mean to say, who serve in these establishments, are obliged,
that is “expected,” to do what is required of them, and this means, as
we have, said, to work for, fifteen hours a day, and to work all day and
night whenever press of business calls for it. This is the trade rule,
which has but very few exceptions, and the slaves, that is apprentices,
are “expected” to conform to it. But then of course you know there's
no compulsion in the matter... This is a free country, and the “ladies”
who “assist”at our great millinery establishments of course are quite at
liberty to leave off working when they like, only if they do so they must
also leave their places. And as they most of them are orphans and have
no one to look after them, and see no likelihood elsewhere of getting
easier employment, they seldom find the courage to resort to this
alternative, and so—quite willingly of course—they submit to being
worked to death, instead of being starved to it. -
For, bless you, yes, qur slaves—we should say, our young ladies, have
the best of food provided them, and as far as mere good living goes
there’s no fear of their dying. Perhaps they don’t get turtle soup and
venison as a rule, but of wholesome beef and mutton they’ve as much
as they can eat, in fact a good deal more, for they have not much time
for eating. The only food they are short of is the food that feeds the
lungs, and for want of this it º: now and then, that they are
suffocated. After working, all day long in close and crowded rooms,
they sleep two in a bed, with the beds jammed close together; and so
they should get used to stifling, for they have certainly enough of it.
But somehow now and then they are found dead in their beds, in spite
of all the care that has been taken for their comfort. It is very
ungrateful of them, to say the very least: because, when such mishaps
occur, there is sure to be a fuss made at that stupid Coroner's Inquest.
And then their dear good kind employers, of whom they always speak
so well, (as do schoolboys of their masters, in the usual holiday letter)—
these tender hearted Christians, or Hebrews it may be, are called all
sorts of horrid names, and almost accused of manslaughter! But poor
dear injured men, how can they help such accidents? Why, M'm, they
take the greatest care of their young people, and, always have a doctor
handy for emergencies. Yes, M'm, fresh air is the thing, but how are
you to gº it? Rents you know, M’m, is hawful figh, and every
hinch of 'ouseroom is uncommon precious. We do hevery-thing,
we can, M’m, we do assure you that we does, and as far as morals
go, combined with every hother luxury, our young ladies is most
comfortable, you may take our honest word for it. But you see, Mºm,
There 's a deal of competition now in trade, and when one 'ires
expensive 'ouses, one 'as to make the most of 'em. And so you see
M’m, our young ladies must sleep pretty thick; but for cleanliness an
comfort their rooms is quite a pictur !
So the tale is told, and so will it be repeated, and when another
slave is stifled, good MR. MANTALINI will heave a sigh of sympathy,
and say he's reelly very sorry, but—but how can he help it? Of course
by increasing the number of his work women, which would lessen
his profits, and hiring extra houses, he might give his slaves more
sleeping room and prevent their being stifled. But, dear kind thought-
less creature, he will never, dream of this, until an Act of Parliament
obliges him to do so, and the spectres of his work-rooms have a
Government Inspector.
Odd Challenge.
THE other evening when a fashionable and highly aristocratic com-
pany were assembled in the drawing-room of a well-known leader of
ton, one of his men-servants dressed in livery came into the apartment,
and without any provocation called his master out. The mystery will
soon, we hear, be cleared up.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 7
CHARITIES AND CHATTERERS.
The man who seeks for something funny may discºver it at times in
the most unlikely places. For instance, who would dream of ever
finding anything to laugh at in the Grocer! Yet the other day we
this in that interesting paper:-
“A TEN GUINEA Speech.—The proceedings at the dinner of the Grocers' and
Teadealers' Benevolent Institution were considerably enlivened towards the close of
the evening by one of the guests Fº to make a speech. He was with some
difficulty prevented continuing a prosy harangue, and at the termination ºf the
festival he declared that had he been allowed to have finished his speech, the Charity
would have been better to the extent of ten guineas. Some gentlemen said that
they had given their money without any fuss, and why could he not do the same.
He replied that he had his moral—“No speech, no ten guineas.'"
Subscribers to a charity are seldom influenced by motives of quite
unmixed benevolence. One man gives his guineas by way of an adver-
tisement, while another does so possibly by way of conscience money for
some secret peccadillo. Others may subscribe because they like to be
thought generous, and enjoy hearing their names applauded when the
Secretary reads them at º: charitable dinner. But what an odd idea
of charity that man must entertain who insists on boring people with a
horribly long speech, and makes that a condition for his giving his ten
guineas' Å subscription on such terms would be no charity at all, fºr
the speech which the subscriber would inflict #. his hearers would
neutralise entirely the benevolence of his gift. If all after-dinner spoul-
ing could for ever be abolished, what a step in civilisation it assuredly
would be ' But while people will make *. and make their doing
so an absolute condition of their charity, there should at charitable din.
ners be some private rooms provided where each subscribing orator
might be .*. with a reporter, and, so, without annºying the com-
º assembled, be allowed to take his ten or twenty guineas' worth of
gaD.
OUT-OF-DOOR GAMESTER
AND SUMMER SPORTING REGISTER.
Caution to Cricketers.--Tone.—The Captain of an Eleven, on the
Cricket-field remarkable for his powers of throwing, pitched his voice so
high, that no one could catch what he said.
t is now positively settled that SHAKSPEARE was a great lover of
the noble game of Cricket; among numerous allusions to this sport
that occur in his works, we single out three, and leave the industrious
player to make the remaining extracts for himself. , In, Coriolanus,
Act i. Scene 1, Menenius Agrippa, so called because of his having such
a hold upon the Public, asks the |Roman citizens-
“Where go you
* With bats and clubs?”
Of course Cricket Clubs are here intended. Again, at the close of this
scene, the same gentleman observes that—
“The one side must have bail.”
Doubtless in the Great Poet's time, the use of more than one bail
was unknown. Another quotation will suffice; King Lear, in Act, iv.
Scene 6, puts the question which should be in every batsman's mouth:
“Is this a good block 2"
If all Commentators, following MALONE, have failed to remark the
above passages, we can only say, with the author of that highly satirical
poem Beau Peep, “Let them, MALONE!” -
Hot Potations on the Field—When the cricketer is warm, let him
beware lest he sit down to partake of liquor: he should invariably take
a spoon and stir his stumps before à.g. (Note from Bishop
BEVERAge's Works.)
Cricket.—July. Matches to come:–
Tunbridge Wells v. Surrey’Ills;
. At Bury, Raw Coffee v. The Ground;
The new Cricket Club at Hampton Wick is to be called the Hampton
Wickets. This is as it should be.
News from the House of Lords.-The M.C.C. are about to take into
consideration the following proposed Rule:—
“That Non-Cricketers shall not be allowed to go about in their carriages on the
ground, but that players during a match shall be allowed a drive.”
Hints:-The Cricketer's true politeness—Whenever any player bowls
a "maiden over,” you must immediately run and pick her up.
The Compliments of the Cricket Season.-If ypu wish to pay a pretty
compliment to a slow bowler, you may say to him, that º eyes are
as, black as his own slows.” Should they, however, not be of this
colour, give him a pair, if he will allow you.
Pedestrianism—jui, 1st. Splendid Foot Race over meadow land
at Runnymede. Stout overweighted competitors will be guided by the
unchangeable sporting Laws that govern the Runny-Medes and
Pursey'uns.
(Advertisement.) We believe that Walks-hall is to be let for Pedes-
trian Matches.
4quatics:-Regatta off. Cowes by the Butchers' Yacht Squadron.—
“There will be,” writes the Secretary, “a match between the butchers,
which is in course a joint affair. Each yawl is to be fitted with leg o'
mutton sails; and, in consequence of our customers having bought
nothing, but haunches lately, we purpose having several sales of the
line.”. The time fixed for this Regatta is the first day when there is a
% sea. The favourite yacht for the first race is the Cheops of the
ſtated.
The Annual Dinner to Steerers of Eight-oared boats will take place at
the Nine Helms.
Launch of a New Ship—A young lady of Ryde after having received
a present of an elegant boating hat, went out in a Transport of delight.
COSMETIC ARCHITECTURE AT SOUTH KENSINGTON.
(To LoRD WIscount PALMERSTON.)
MY DEAR LORD, -
THERE is in this town a lady whom I will venture to recom-
mend to your Lordship as exactly the person to answer your purpose in
case you buy the International Exhibition Building and design to give
it that ornamental covering which you, named to the House of Com-
mons. , You said that the exterior of the above-mentioned edifice was
“ plainly and simply constructed,” and that “it was proposed to
ornament it with cement.” The “coating of cement” thus given to it,
you declared, would be “durable and pleasing to the eye.” Yourepeated
that “No doubt the face of the building would be improved in appear-
ance when it was covered with cement.”. In short, you propose to
enamel the International Exhibition Building.
Well; you are justified in thatP. by analogy. The exterior of
a building, as you say, plainly and simply constructed, corresponds to
the face § a plain woman. That of the structure in question is certainly
very plain, in the female sense of the word. In plain English it is
horribly ugly... The plain woman has her face enamelled: and so may
you have the Exhibition Building.
You know LADY BARDOLPH, whom I met at your house the other
evening, and who begged me to dance with her. For twenty #." up
to within the last month or two, as you are aware, her Ladyship's face
was all bubuckles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames of fire; in a state
of alcoholic efflorescence, not to sayfºr Now the LADY
BARDOLPH has had her face enamelled. Her plain exterior has been
ornamented with cement; embellished with a coating of cement, which
is durable and pleasing to the eye. Mark, not only pleasing to the eye,
but also durable. This is just what you want...Let MADAME RACHEL
enamel the shed at South Kensington, and, in the words of the title of
a work which she has addressed to the taste and intelligence of the
British female. Aristocracy, she will render the plainly and simply con-
structed exterior of that fabric, like the plainest of faces, “Beautiful for
ever.” I am ever yours, 490ANC#.
P.S. It is probable that MADAME RACHEL's charge for enamelling
the Exhibition Building would be something considerably under the
sum that its decorations and repairs, mismanaged as usual, are likely to
cost you in the end.
Black and White Slavery.
WE understand that the KING OF DAHOMEY intends sending over a
deputation to this country to remonstrate against the slavery that is
carried out in our workshops, with a view of * an end, if possible,
to the horrors and atrocities that are, with a degree of barbarism
unworthy of a civilised country, practised there.
EMPLOYMENT For LADIEs.—To order their dresses a week or so
before they are wanted, so that the poor sempstresses may not have to
sit up all night to finish them.

A BROAD HINT.
This is the way our friend Scrawley (a fellow of some humour for a Swell) appealed to

“IFS" AND “ANDS.”
(Apropos of the International Erhibition Building, and the
buying up thereof)
If a hundred and fifty thousand
The public hadn't paid up,
For the old Brompton acres where KELK
And LUCAs have run their shed up—
If the Old Exhibition Commission
Was not John BULL's own trustee,
And their sixteen and a-half acres
Already his propertiè—
If the building had drains and foundations
The damp from below to remove;
If the building had roofs and sky-lights
To keep out the rain from above-
IF it wouldn’t cost more money, |
Betwixt doin’ and undoin',
To fit the old shell for our uses,
Than it would to build a new un’—
If MR. HUNT's Estimates hadn't

If the Domes weren’t quite so ugly;
IF DILKE weren’t quite so pompous—
If we’d half a million to play with :
IF those who spend had to earn it too:
IF our money burnt holes in our pockets:
IF we’d no better use to turn it to—
Then, IF all these IFs were disposed of,
And no more IFs could be found,
It might be well to invest in
The Building, and pay for the Ground.

Suppose we took the acres,

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
DURING the ensuing Term, Bar-maids will be allowed to practise in
Westminster Hall. This is no Inn-ovation as Bachelors of Civil Law
have from time immemorial possessed the same privilege.
MR. E.T., SMITH has engaged the services of the Longest and
Shortest Nights in the year for a joust at the forthcoming Tournament;
which was ſº. what he wanted; he has also, we believe, applied to the
Royal Geological Society for any’Ossyfied gents that they may have by
them....The Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, has, with his usual
liberality, made a proposition for furnishing a few mathematical riders
for the occasion. A large Tailor's Establishment will supply the Lists
at Cremorne.
The Spaniards are about to do honour to a distinguished man, and
have determined upon setting up a Column to CHRISTOPHER CóLUM:
BUs. The motto on the base is to be taken from SHERIDAN’s well
known play of The Critic, where Puff implores the actor to “keep up
his Christopher.” The Line is most appropriate.
In a late interesting case in one of the House of Commons Com-
mittee rooms, it was thought that the name of Railway Contractors
ought to be dropped in consequence of the numerous “extensions”
which they were perpetually advocating.
The SPEAKER wishes to enforce the old rule, that “no Honourable
Member shall bring a pea-shooter into the House.” The order will
meet with a vast amount of opposition. If the attempt were made to
introduce the same into the House of Lords, the Peers would unani-
mously resent it. It has also been suggested that the Members might
be accommodated with refreshment at the bar of the House.
In compliance with a time-honoured custom, the LoRD CHANCELLOR
will, on the last day of the Session, pledge every one in a pint of his
own Wool Sack.
The Whitebait at Greenwich have this season been remarkably fine;
these queer fish are going to give a grand amateur performance in aid
of digestion; the first piece will be the well-known Nigger Opera,
the Do-minnow Noir.
GALLUS WESTER EGO.
THE MARQUIs of HASTINGs (who is the Patron of Ten Livings) has
just been fined for fighting Twelve Cocks. This battle of Hastings has
caused some sensation at Loughborough, and despite the eloquent and
ingenious efforts of MR. C. G., MEREwetHER in his noble client's
; the Magistrates mulcted the Marquis in the sum of five pounds.
It was urged that cock-fighting, is not cruel in the ordinary sense of
the words, inasmuch as cocks like to fight. This may be so, but the
real cruelty is practised upon the public, because it does not like to
read of such sanguinary combats. The Marquis is under age, and will
robably know better in future, but we suppose that living near Ashby-
...}. he thought he would get up a small tournament of his own.
A Plantagenet, however, should love nobler sport, and win other
spurs than ornithological ones. Nemo bis verari and so forth, and we
are not going to punish his Lordship, who has been dealt with º the
law, but we warn him that some French dramatist will infallibly bring
him on the Parisian Stage, with a coronet on his head and a cock, under
each arm, and saying “Godam, I shall go to Westminstare and fight Cox
in the House of Commons, yes, rosbif, wee.” Such is the result of
incaution on the part of great people.

THE DRAWING-R00M AND THE DINNER TABLE,
E read on Monday
morning last,
nearly three co-
lumns of the Morn.
ing Post filled with
descriptions of
the dresses worn
by the ladies
who attended the
QUEEN’s Draw-
ing-Room on the
- ºf Satur.
: day. Of course
; every dress were
Nº furnished by the
ºf wearer to the
Post for publica-
! tion. To what end
§ ladies of fashion?
In order that un-
fashionable la-
dies, the wives
§ and daughters of
§ mercantile and
§ professional men
5 may be enabled
the more accu-
rately to imitate
their costume?
If so, this condescension is very kind and considerate of the fashionable
ladies to those who benefit by it, whose husbands, however, may take
another view of the suggestion of expensive finery. -
It might be supposed that the object of ladies who think it proper to
inform the world how they were dressed when they went to Court is to
advertise themselves. But the number of those among them who are
married is at least equal to that of the single. The latter only can have
any need to be puffed, the former having already gone off-some of
them very much so. - -- -
The persons who really want the advertisement which the details in
|. afford fine ladies, are the milliners who make their Court
resses. Handsome is that handsome does; and if the beauties who |W
figure before the world bedizened in type wished to do the handsome
thing, they would affix, for publication, to the account of their clothing,
the name of the milliner by whom they were supplied with it... At the
end, of every catalogue of dresses worn at a Court Drawing-Room, it
is also desirable that the Morning Post should publish, a is of the
killed, and prostrated; namely, the dressmakers and needlewomen who
have been worked or stifled to death almost or quite, in the task of
getting up all that elegant apparel against time. -
Some men have a notion that the enumeration of the particulars of
ladies' dresses worn on any grand occasion is intended, and serves,
merely to gratify a peculiar female propensity delighting in such details;
the taste in dress. This may be. On the same principle, perhaps, at
Lord, Mayors' feasts, and other grand dinners, the bill of fare is pub-
lished by the .. in order to afford gratification, to a faste
supposed to be more characteristically masculine; the appetite for food.
The analogy, however, is imperfectly carried out by the Press: A list
of ladies' dresses would be exactly paralleled by an account of the dishes
which the gentlemen had individually eaten; each gentleman furnishing
a specification of the viands whereon he had regaled himself. As for
instance:-
“MR. DEPUTY GUTCH. Turtle, claire and purée. Salmon and lobster sauce, with
cucumber; stewed and spitchcocked eels, turbot dla créme, flounders, water-souchet,
soles d la tartare, mackerel à la maitre d'hôtel, rissoles of rabbit, oyster-patties, roast
and bashed venison, boiled turkey poult, capon, d l'estragon, roast peacock, ditto
swan, mutton cutlets and sauce piquante, stewed breast of veal and mushrooms,
ducklings, toad-in-the-hole, gooseberry pie and custard, sweet and savoury omelettes,
souffle of rice cream. Charlotte Russe, Maraschino and Curaçoa jelly, blancmange,
leveret, salad, bread-and-cheese. Iced punch, sherry, hock, champagne, ale, half-
and-half, stout, port, and claret.”
Many old gentlemen, perhaps, would gloat over a registration of
gluttony, like the foregoing, just as ladies, old and young, love to pore
3ver the records of fiddleſaddle. There is certainly some difference
between such gentlemen and such ladies. So there is between butter-
flies and pigs.
Art Terms.
A LADY Artist, who had been for some time abusing the make of a
certain tall gentleman's cranium, on seeing him suddenly stoop as he
passed under a very low doorway, quickly changed her mind, and
exclaimed that it was “a duck of a head.” Parium et mutabile semper

A STRONG MAN AT COURT.
It is generally known that the
LoRD CHIEF BARON carries his
years uncommonly well. At Her
Majesty's Drawing-Room, on
Saturday last, the venerable and
learned President of the Court of
Exchequer showed convincing
proof of his ability to carry some-
thing more. The Court Newsman
delights and astonishes us by the
information that:—
“The Lord Chief Baron wore his gold
collar of S.S. with the portcullis.”
Fancy SIR FREDERICK Pollock
marching along under the load of
a portcullis' Which of us youth
could perform such a feat of
strength as that P The like thereof
has not been seen since the days of
Samson.
A PLEA FOR THE “MONDAY POPS.”
WHAT is popular music? “Oh, nigger-songs, of course,” says Jon Es,
“and melodies of the Music Halls, like ‘The Black Gal togged in Blue,’
or ‘The Scavenger's Great Granddaughter.’” Well, Jones, you may be
right, and music such as this may (more’s the pity) be thought popular.
People without brains may like hearing brainless music, and, as “more
: than swans do live, more fools than wise,” senseless jingle-jang-
ing tunes must doubtless become popular. But that epithet has lately
been applied to better music, and it rejoices us to notice that the appli-
cation daily is becoming more well founded. Twenty years ago good
music was supposed to send people to sleep, and only Philharmonic
lunatics were thought able to endure it. Nowadays, however, good
music is known better, and therefore better liked. A sonata or concerto
of quite twenty minutes' length is listened to without a gabble or a

HELP FOR THE HOPELESS.
THERE is a so-called “comic” song which is termed the “Perfect
Cure,” and there are unhappily many persons in the world who can
never hope to sing that song in character. These poor sufferers have
ailments or deformities which no human skill can cure, and for their
relief an asylum has been founded, where patients thought incurable
may be permanently lod At all our other hospitals cases such as
these are inadmissible for treatment: at the Hospital for Incurables
none other are received.
To aid the not too º funds of this admirable Charity, a fancy
fair was held last week beneath the Domes that Fowke built, where a
score or two of ladies played at shopkeeping awhile, and sold shillings.
worths for sovereigns with the usual fair dealing of the fair sex at a
fair. Moreover some few score of gentlemen made hobby horses of
themselves, and turned acrobats and actors, and men wise in their
vocation of both law and art and literature, consented for pure charity
to try and play the fool. -
Punch merely notices this fair to call attention to the Hospital for
which the fair was held, and which he knows to be deserving of liberal
(as well as of ...) support. ...And if this be given as freely, and
with as excellent good-will as the stall-keepers and showmen gave their
presence at the fair, the Hospital for Incurables will be considerably
benefited, and many a poor sufferer may hope to be relieved by it.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 29. Monday. The sight of the stalwart and intelligent Maori chiefs, who
are among the lions of the season, probably induced LoRD Lyttleton to ſº up
a New Zealand debate. He urged that certain settlers at Taranaki should be pro-
tected against the natives. The DUKE of NewcasTLE was sorry for the settlers, but
thought that their troubles were their own fault. EARL GREY praised the Maories,
and was for amalgamating them with the colonists. Much uglier fellows than the
chieſs who are visiting us get married to very eligible English girls.
The Solicitor General, who is thought founderstand International Law almost
as well as Mr. Punch, is not dissatisfied with the American Prize Courts. There
was a debate on their decisions, and MR. Cobden, in return, assailed the charge of
Chief BARon Pollock, in the Alexandra case. MR. Seymour. Fitzgerald
thought that Lord Russell’s language, on the subject of British rights, was more
energetic than his deeds.
The Irish Church debate was resumed, and of course there was a good deal of
laughter. SIR. Robert PEEL made a rattling speech, suggested a Cartoon for Mr.
Punch (for which we are º and made fun of MR. BERNAL Osborne “with
pious tears galloping over his theological cheek.” SIR Robert declared himself the
determined champion of the Church of Ireland, and reminded the House that the
total expense of that grand engine against evil was only the price of a single armour-
plated vessel. The logic was exactly suited to the House, which after some, more
talk, decided by 228 to 67 that the debate should not be adjourned, and then a
motion, for the adjournment of the House finished off the affair altogether. The
Tories have won Berwick-on-Tweed.
Tuesday...Mouraviery seems to be a Russian GENERAL
BuTLER. That eminent Federal, who hopes to be President,
had a special method of dealing with the ladies of New
Orleans, and MQURAylery has an equally special way of
persecuting Polish ladies. The latter are addicted to wearin
mourning for their slaughtered relativesorfortheir oppress
country, and the symbol is hateful to the Russians. So
they have commanded that all women of an infamous life
shall wear, black, and consequently any lady in black is
liable to the utmost insolence of the police. Can we
wonder at hearing that the Poles sometimes avenge them-
selves terribly?
Loºp DERby made a meat protest against the surrender
of the Ionian Isles, which, had he been in office he would
have seen it necessary to cede, and LoRD, Russell, who,
had he been in Qpposition, would have felt it his duty to
protest against the cession, made the defence which, in the
other case, would have fallen to Lord DeRBY.
LoRD GRANVILLE stated that the case of the Milliners and
Dressmakers had been referred to a Royal Commission now
sitting on similar matters. The employers of the girls like
the one destroyed at MRs. Isaacson-Elise’s have tried
to lay blame on the ladies, but Lady ELLEs MERE states
that no matter, how long a notice a lady gives, the dress:
maker will not begin the dress until the last moment, and
hence the terrible pressure.
Edinburgh's claim to precedence over Dublin is now
finally allowed by the heralds. Probably the Scottish
metropolis will shortly claim precedence over London, as
England is described as “an appanage to the Scottish
crown.”
Then came the question, raised by John ARTHUR Roe-
BUCK, whose name is TEAR’EM, “Shall we recognise the
Southern Confederacy?” He moved a resolution to the
effect that we ought to do so. His reasons were various.
Among them were these:–
Tºº BRIGHT thinks himself the salt of the earth,
and 1811 p.
That the South had conquered the North, and now
menaced Washington.
That it was for our interest to be on terms with a State
that produces sugar, cotton, and tobacco.
That the Northerners hate the slaves.
That the Northerners are hypocrites.
That he, Roebuck, had resolved to prevent the recon-
struction of the Union.
That he and MR.L.INDsay had been to Paris, and asked
the EMPEROR whether he had changed his mind, and that
the EMPERoR had said that he had not.
That in ten days we could sweep every American ship
from the seas.
That the Northern armies are melting away.
That the Lancashire distress will increase, and in that
case LoRD PALMERston's popularity will collapse.
Well, here are reasons of all kinds, large and small, and
to and from the purpose. A great debate followed. Lord
R. Montagu was for neutrality, as was MR. CLIFroRD,
who, however, affirmed that public opinion in this country
was strongly in favour of the South. MR. GLAnstone
urged the necessity of being passionless, testified to English
admiration of the heroism of the South, but adverted to
the counter-current of anti-slavery feelings. He had not
been afraid of the Union, nor desired its destruction, and
at all events he deprecated any argument, based on selfish
grounds. He also protested against the House taking into
its own hands the business of Government. He rebuked
MR. Roebuck, and said there was no doubt as to what
would be the issue of the war, but that there ought to be
no undue interference. MR. Forster made a stron
anti-slavery speech, and threatened us with the angero
Heaven if we encouraged the slave-owners. LoRD Robert
CECIL called him a fanatic. MR. BRIGut, in one of the
ablest speeches he has ever made, castigated MR. Roebuck
in a hideous manner, and contrasted his present language
of adulation of the EMPERoR with his expression of disgust
sometime ago that “those perjured lips should touch the
hallowed cheek of our Queen,” MR.BRight, of course,
made a strong, Federal speech, and introduced as illus-
trative of the horrors of slavery a pretty picture of his
own fireside with six little children there. He argued, of
course, upon what slave, parents must feel. All very well,
but it does not follow that because MR. BRight loves his
six charming children (to whom Mr. Punch sends his best
love) he ought to encourage people who hire the scum of
Ireland and Germany to cut the throats of those who have,

in ten thousand households, little children, as dear to them as MR.
BRight's to him. He implored the House not to aid the South in
“the most stupendous act of guilt which history had recorded.” SIR
George Grey contradicted a queer statement by MR. Roebuck that
the EMPEROR had complained to him that LoRD Lyons had improperly
exhibited to MR. SEwARD a French despatch. Next night MR. LAYARD,
repeatedly and very petulantly interrupted by MR. Roebuck, set the
matter beyond doubt by reference to dates. Nothing of the kind could
have occurred. As we believe that MR. Roebuck, is incapable of
untruth, we conclude that the EMPEROR inconsiderately talked French
to him, and that he had left his French ear in England. . The Tuesday
debate was adjourned till. Thursday, but the Westminster cooks had
other fish to fry on that night, and it stood over till the Monday.
We have to inform Materfamilias that LoRD RAYNHAM's Bill for
abolishing the Cane in favour of the birch was somewhat summarily
rejected, the House saying, majora Canavius.
Wednesday. The House of Commons did that which next day threw
millions of stupid people into an ecstacy of wrathful bewilderment...It
read a Second Time a Bill for abolishing all the arithmetical tables which
drive little boys to distraction, and substituted a simple and uniform
system, based on science, and in accordance with the standard of other
civilised nations. It is proposed to give England Three Years to learn
what any boy of twelve years old could easily learn in a week. Of
course Government had too accurate an idea of the stupidity of the
eople to believe that such a measure would be acceptable, and it will
É. ãº this time, but if the Boys of England have true British
pluck they will demand to be taught the metrical system, and, will
meantime refuse to learn the ridiculous old one. And if any School-
master dares to flog a Boy for such resistance, let Mr. Punch have the
name and address of that Pedagogue, and he shall be mailed up ºn
terrorem, and one school shall ſollow the fortune of that of Mr. Wack-
ford Squeers. While the British Blockhead is making up his mind to
the new system, at least let it be taught in all the schools we pay for,
and let all candidates for all offices be examined in it.
Thursday. There are to be great improvements in our part of the
New World. There is to be a Constitution for Vancouver's Island
and British Columbia, the Atlantic and Pacific are to be connected by
a railway through British North America, and that most gigantic of
Game Lords, the Hudson's Bay Company, has consented, for the small
sum of a million and a half, to allow, its wilderness, of animals with
valuable skins to be opened up for Colonisation. MRs. BRITANNIA,
adam, - --
“These be celestial arts and worthy thee.
And now Mr. Punch, with his habitual self-reliance, but still with an
adequate sense of the greatness of the work before him, addresses him
to a brief history of
THE GREAT REBELLION.
“It had been known that the Leaders of Parties had, viis et modis,
been won over to the scheme which, according to the bias of those who
spoke of it, was described as the International Building Purchase, and
the Kensington Court Job. But the Leaders of Parties are not every-
body. Excitement pervaded England, and agitation against the scheme
had spread far and wide. The wily PREMIER had fought and won a
battle which it was hoped might decide the fate of the campaign, for
he had secured the assent of the House to the purchase of the Land.
Then, with increased wiliness, he became a little unwell, and left the
greater, battle to be ſought by his Lieutenants. It had been delayed
more than once, but the Chariot of the Hour arrived at last, and
Jupiter struggled in the fierce clutch of Demogorgon. On the
night of Thursday, the second of July, and the eve of the Dog Days,
R. GLADSTONE asked a Committee of the House of Commons for
£105,000 for the purchase of the domed and doomed International Build-
ings. . His elaborate argument, though delivered under an evident
consciousness that he was casting away his subtle eloquence, comprised,
it may be safely said, all that could be urged in favour of the measure.
The gallant Volunteer, Lord Elcho, moved the rejection of the vote.
He was º: by Bºnfiscº the Tory, and ShellEY the Radical.
The gentle Cowper came to his comrade's aid, and was assailed by
BENTINck secundus, and Doulton of the Pots. The brave LoRD HENRY
LENNox boldly declared he voted for the scheme because the late PRINCE
Consort had approved it. GREGoRy’s swashing blow was delivered at
the Domes, and then it was felt that valour had lost the fight, but that
skill might retrieve it. SiR STArroRD Northcote tried to postpone
the decision, but the enraged Committee shouted him to silence, and
similar was the fortune of MR. Lowe, and even of MR. DisrAELI, who
has never before been reſused a hearing since the day when he said
“The time will come when you Shall hear me.” This awful sign spºke
the doom of the domes, and told how far the mutiny had spread. The
indomitable leader of Opposition measures rushed to the front, and
sought to persuade the Commons that they were in a hasty mood–
something was said of a reduction of the vote, something of a Select
Committee—but the battle was lost, and victory hovered above the
banner of the insurgents. Then, amid the momentary lull which pre-
cedes the death-close, HENLEY, and his yellow waistcoat, deserted their
chief, and joined the ranks of the mutineers. All was over. GLADstone,
chivalrous to the end, went down fighting, and the last tremendous
charge was made. , “The Guard turned and fled. Tenminutes later the
International was lying dead upon the field, with 287 bullets through
its heart.”. But it had died game, and had fired 121. Such is the
chronicle of the Great Rebellion?
Friday. EARL RussELL made one of his little moves in the direction
of a reſorm. He presented a petition for doing away with the sub-
scriptions required for academical degrees, and thought that at some
future time the statements in that petition might serve as the basis of
a measure for doing away with the tests. LoRd Denby, as Chancellor
of Oxford, was obliged to object to any such improvement, but did so
in a way which showed that he knew it was desirable, and there was a
debate, in which the Bishop of Losoon displayed his usual courage
and liberality. - -
In the Commons, Irish Fish and Indian Cotton were the materials of
debate, aud.the week was pleasingly wound up as follows. Aſr. Panch
quotes the Morning Star. A squabble on the LILLEY and CRAwLey
case was thus concluded:–
“Mr. BERNAL Osborne. I rise to order. I protest in the name of the hou. gen-
tleman's own client against his being allowed to go into that case again.
“MR. Conisah AM. It is the hon gentleman who is out of order, and I recom-
mend him to confine his attention to the Irish Church, and to be more accurate
in his facts the next time he brings it forward. (Laughter.)

out of the quesſion
- o }; Cosºsº. I do not know whether the hou. gentleman is sober. (Cries of

In which cry Mr. Punch begs emphatically to join.
TO THE GRUMBLING BOY, BEKE.
DEAR CHARLEs BEKE
- There were three intelligent little boys who wished to
discover the Source of the Great River Panch. We will call them
TALK, Give, and MAGISTRAte.
MAGISTRATE got a map of and a copy of Punch, and a pair
of compasses, and a directory, and went into his papa's study. After
a time he eame out and said, “I know the Source of Punch. It must
be somewhere in the Blue Clay of the London basin, and not far from
Ben Primrose and Ben Holborn, the famous mountains.”
TALK and Give put on their caps, and with their kind tutor's leave,
and with sixpence a-piece which he had given them, walked all the way
from Burlington House to 85, Fleet Street, where they ſound the Head
of Punch, and were kindly received by him, and drank his health.

THE inhabitants of Ryde, in the Isle of Wight, have held a meeting
for the purpose of memorialising the QUEEN to constitute that town a
municipal borough by charter. Are the Ryde people so lean that they
want a Corporation ? Should HER MAJESTY grant their petition, it is
supposed that Parliament will enfranchise the new borough. In that
case we have reason to state that an invitation to become Member for
Ryde will be addressed to MR. HoRsMAN.

The revival of duelling may be fine fun for fire-eaters, but will prove
extremely disagreeable to all persons who are accustomed to consider
the consequences of their actions. It will enable any bully, by wantonly
insulting you, to place you under the necessity of inviting him to shoot
at you, and of not shooting at him in return, unless you are willing tº be
tried for your life, and, if not hanged for murder, to be almost certainly
convicted of manslaughter, that is to say of felony, and so to incur im-
prisonment, or even penal servitude, and the forfeiture of all you
ssess.
Will you laugh, and say that the duello is an anachronism. Well;
but war was thought an anachronism sixteen years ago. Necromancy
was voted an anachronism; penny-a-liners headed paragraphs about
ghosts and witchcraft among the bumpkins:—“Superstition in the
Nineteenth Century.” Hooped petticoats were numbered with ana-
chronisms. Now we have a large proportion of mankind engaged in
cutting each other's throats, and the rest preparing to do so., Ghosts
communicate with the mobility and gentry of England, and with foreign
princes through MR. Home as a go-between; and all womankind is
arrayed a l'Impératrice and caged in Crinoline. Let nobody flatter him-
self that there are not enough idiots in the world to render duelling
once more fashionable.
A SLAP FOR A SAWNIE.
PEOPLE often go for coolness to the Highlands, but they may find it
in the Lowlands too at times, as witness this:–
M ATRIMONY.—A Young Scotch Proprietor, of copious precinct,
residing in the Lowlands of Scotland, aspires to MARRY a young ENGLISH
LADY, of graceful appearance, possessing the most worthy virtues, being in equal
circumstances, not exceeding 24 years of age. No other but the most pious and
respectable need count their value to meet the just.—Address Mihi.
What “copious precinct” means we are not Scotch enough to say,
but this young Scotch proprietor might certainly describe himself of
copious assurance. Graceful English girls there are in plenty here
among us, but there is not yet such a glut of them that to get a decent
husband they need emigrate to Scotland for him. As the advertiser
stipulates for a bride “of equal circumstances,” we presume he means
to say that he wants a wife well fortuned besides being well favoured ;
indeed we should not much mind betting that, although he says his wife
must be “most pious,” he would not be too particular about her stock
of piety, if he could “count her value” by her having a good purse.

There was never such a Tartar,

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
... AMONG the Shadows of the Week, first and foremost comes the Adelphi Ghost, and so fearful
is this spectral appearance to those actually engaged on the stage, that even the Burlesque is now
announced as “Screaming;” doubtlessly from terror.
Shakespearian Memorials are starting up on all sides; among the latest of these we hear
that, the Printers' Society, having discussed Titus Andronicus, have just raised the question of
Authorship, and are going to set it up in type as a tribute to the Great Poet.
Our lively neighbours the French, º sent a sample of an old Parisian Herb to our Botanical
Society; it is . the Rue de Rivoli.
RD RANELAGH wishes it to be generally known, that every Wolunteer on joining his corps
must provide himself with, his own knife,
fork, spoon, and brush, the last article must
always be used on field days for the purpose
of scouring the plain.
The Commissariat staff, during a recent re-
view, executed a very F. movement; they
deployed with a nicely-packed hamper, and
were finally discovered in a weal-and-'ambush.
There are very few startling advertisements
in the literary world; the only book calling for
any notice is one purporting to be “A Collec-
tion of Lame Jokes” bound in limp cloth.
A painful case of eviction lately occurred
in Ireland; the River Wartry, in i. County
Wicklow, was at an early hour of the morn-
ing actually turned out of its old Bed into
the New Channel! Crowds watched the pain-
ſul and heartless proceeding, but not a soul
interfered! “Where,” for the three thousand
and sixty-fourth time we ask, “Where are
the Police?” It is true the Lord Lieute-
nant officiated on this melancholy occasion,
and “nothing” says the report “could be
more appropriate or dramatic than the manner
in which "his Excellency performed his task.
The ceremony was, we believe, on this wise:
the Lord Lieutenant approaching the bed of
the river, knocked at the floodgates, and, pre:
tending to be the “Walet of the º
said “Hot water, Sir, Time to get up.”
The river, which was a little swollen in con-
sequence of its many previous falls, would not
budge an inch; and on seeing this determi-
nation, His Excellency, after bowing grace-
fully, made a short speech, the greater part
of which, totally ſailed in moving the river.
When, however, he arrived at this sentence:
“If in a neighbouring valley the eye of genius
could seein the social pleasures which were gathered
round the meeting of the waters a magic more exqui-
site than their own, so here we consecratether arting
of the waterstoastill higher mission—to promote the
health, comfort, and civilisation of countless families.”
—the respectable old Wartry became utterly
puzzled (he is but shallow at the best of times),
and without stopping either to adorn his body
of water or wave his hair, he went off into the
New Channel. “The Company” continues
our informant, “then went back to Bray.”
Just what we should have expected. We
have not heard the last of this.
Our Volunteers are becoming dangerous;
it was only a few days ago that a party of
these gallant gentlemen went down and fired

allowed to protest against the repetition of

Question 2
In the report of the late trial of MoRRIson
v. BELCHER it was stated that the plaintiff
(whose alias is ZAdkiel) was a Commander
in the Navy. Considering the way in which,
as ZADKIEL, he dupes the silly buyers of his
Almanack, ought he not rather to rank as a
Commander in the Knavy P

THERE is no truth in the report that MR.
J. A. Roebuck is, at the request of the
EMPERoR, to be appointed the British Am-
bassador at Paris, in the place of Lond
CowLEY, whose services at the French Court
are evidently no longer needed.

FASHION AND ITS VICTIMS.
az Doladies ever think? . -
Now really, what a question!
- - You can’t be impolite enough to
tº tºº call them thoughtless creatures!
- - - ell, but how about their dress-
jºs- makers, and the cases that occur
- SJ |A| at times of something near to man-
- §§§ slaughter? The ladies, Heaven
ºSN bless them! of course are not
- >\UTF responsible: still, might they not
- do somewhat to º evil?
If they used their thinking facul-
ties (assuming that they have any),
might it not occur to them that
dresses which may cost a life are
rather too expensive; and even
at the risk of being slightly out
of fashion, might they not submit
to be seen in a pink skirt if they
thought that it might work a girl
to death to make a blue one?
Besides, who knows but infection
may lie latent in a ball-dress, when
stitched in a foul room and with
fever-stricken fingers? If ladies thought of this they . think
a little more of the sore need of the needlewomen, and might thinka
little less of the exigence of ſashion. - - -
We well know it is not fair to blame the ladies for the way in which
the sempstresses are sorely over-slaved, and slowly murdered...But the
ladies, surely, if they thought about the matter, might exist with ſewer
és, or give longer time for making them; or, by a wholesome com:
bination, might compel the Mantalini's to follow the example of larger
manufacturers, and, when they get extra work get extra hands to do it.
If the ladies can't do this, the Government must help them. At
resent every Court robe has the ghastly hue of death on it, and
enus going to the ball is attired not by the Graces, but by slave-
work that dis-graces us.
PARISLAN THEATRICALS.
A SENsATION Drama entitled Le Secret de Miss Aurore is to be pro-
duced at the Théâtre du Châtelet. We need hardly inform our readers
that, as the title itself suggests, the play combines all the sensation:
situations of the Secret of Lady Audley, with the stirring romantic
adventures of the pretty little Banker's ſaughter, Aurora Floyd. The
Management, by a judicious introduction of MessRs. DIRCKes' and
PEPPER's Ghost, are enabled to spice the performance with several
additional thrilling effects. -
To the indefatigable exertions of our foreign, correspondent,(who
has been “suppressed” officially, and several times forcibly ejected
from the Theatre in his attempts to obtain the first Dramatic Intelli-
gence,) we are indebted for the following admirably translated extracts
which give some notion of what the Piece is likely to be. It is arranged
in Two Prologues, ten Acts and twenty-six tableaur. The First Pro-
logue, in which is shown how Aurore d'Audley grew up from infancy to
the ripe age, when she ran away with Le Sofly “the º speculator in
: s,” which is the French notion of an English Trainer, thus
concludes:-

finally starts for Australia, pretending to be dead, the Second Prologue
ends, and the Play commences.

Appalling and Mysterious.
A GENTIEMAN ſº. his Wiſe took lodgings some time since in a
street not far from Piccadilly. One morning, the gentleman went out,
apparently alone, and did not return. On subsequently searching the
room, the landlady was horrified on discovering that her lodger had
taken his better half with him, and left his quarters. Surgical aid was
called in, but too late to be ofany assistance.

a rising young modeller his countenance. The ungrateful youth has since

SABBATARLANISM ON THE STAGE.
THE Leicester Chronicle, publishes the subjoined state-
ment, with a heading which seems, indeed, appropriate
enough :—
‘AN ALMost INCREDIBLE Story.—The following lately took #.
before the Magistrates of Loughborough: MR. BARNEs, of Six Hills,
summoned his servant, a young man named FREDERick Pick, for a
wilful violation of the Sabbath, in cleaning on Sunday a pair of lace-up
boots! The complainant told the Bench that on Sunday morning he
went into the out-house, and there saw the defendant cleaning him-
self before a piece of broken looking-glass, and lying by the side of
him was a pair of lace-up boots, which had just been polished, }
together with the just-used blacking-brushes. He asked the de-
fendant if he had violated his orders and cleaned the boots on the
Sabbath? The defendant attempted to justify his unholy and dis-
obedient act by saying that he had not time to clean himself on
Saturday. . The lad, in his defence said he thought it would be much
more criminal if he went to church dirty than in cleaning his boots
and shaving himself, and going to church like a Christian. The Magis-
trates fined the lad in the sum of 40s. and costs, which their
Worships humanely ordered to be paid out of the wages due to him
from his master!—Leicester Chronicle.” -
However, the above, narrative is not quite so incredible
as it seems. Our Leicester contemporary says that the
proceedings therein related took place before the Magis-
trates of Loughborough. Exactly so. It occurred at a
theatre, on the boards of which was performed, in the
presence of their Worships, who patronised the entertain-
ment, a burlesque on I Puritani, entitled The Mawworms
wherein a Sabbatarian humbug, and a bench of hypocritical
asses of the same profession, were represented as concur-
ring in the monstrous perversion of law, and the rampant
violation of justice, which not anywhere but on the stage,
and there only in the wildest extravaganza, could ever have
been enacted.
Of course, if any quorum of Sabbato-maniacs had actu-
ally had the crazy fanaticism, or the cracked hypocrisy, to
fine a lad for cleaning his own boots on a Sunday, the
HoME SECRETARY would have taken i. Care to have
them removed from the Commission of the Peace, and sub-
jected to a Commission of Lunacy.
ADVERTISEMENT.-A Gentleman with a few hours to
spare will be happy to lend them to anybody who can't
otherwise get a minute to himself.
CANT AND CARNEY.
“Ha! whare ye gaun, ye crowlin' ferlie,
Your impudence protects ye sairly,
I canna say but ye strunt rarely.”
“O'er Gauze and Lace.”—BURNS.
DR. CANDLISH, now known as the Frantic Divine, made in the
course of his manly attack upon a Royal Widow’s Memorial to her
husband, a reſerence to “the Bible that Scotland Loves.” There is a
Bible that England loves, which may be a different book, if CANDLlsh
is the authorised interpreter of Scotland's, for ours tells us to honour
the Sovereign, and also to “honour widows.” We are the more
inclined to think that the Bible that Scotland Loves must be some
other volume than our own household treasure, because the Scotch
book has just been reprinted, and is announced to the world in an
advertisement of which we propose to reproduce the principal part.
This advertisement has been forwarded to us by half a hundred cor-
respondents who seem scandalised. So might we be, but for the
hypothesis we have advanced. The Scotch Bible is published by MR.
KENNEDY M“NAB, and he dates from Inverness. He solicits patron-
age for his Book (we should take the liberty of using that translation
of a word, the light use of which is unpleasing to the English mind, but
the word is BIBLE throughout the advertisement), and the irreverence,
if any, is not ours, and this is what he says:—
“A copy has been presented to the PRINCE of WALEs and the PRINCEss ALEx-
Andha-through Lord SHAFTESBURY-who have been graciously pleased—especially
the Princess, that brightest of orbs in the firmament of living beauty—to express their
high admiration of it.”
Without pausing upon the delicate mixture of profanity, nonsense,
and impertinence, which marks, the reference to the PRINCEss of
WALEs, we may, just note that it is satisfactory to obtain such dis-
tinguished approbation of the Scotch Bible, And as in Scotland, “high
names” are still thought a good deal of, the publisher is happy to add
that the work has—
“Already been patronised by the high names of the DUKEs of HAMILtoN, and
BRANDon, ARgyll, Buccleugh, and QUEENsbERRY, Lord Foley, and a large
number of noblemen and gentlemen.”
We hope the grammar of the volume is not akin to that of the adver-
tisement. . The book has been patronised by high names and by a
number of noblemen. But now listen:—
“I have now to state to you that these Bibles are necessarily most expensive,
and only within the reach of those to whom its Great Author has given the ‘silver
and the gold' in abundance.”
Eh? DR. CANDLISH. This is a graceful and mosaic interweaving of
scriptural and commercial language, and shall atone for the apparent
defection of “its” from some friendly word abandoned. The price
is high certainly, but as you say, Doctor, the book is dear to Scotland.
Here, however, is the gem of the invitation:-
“I appeal first for patronage to that bright galaxy, of more than Circassian beauty,
those fairy forms, cast in celestial moulds, whose meeds of praise poetry itself fails
to find language to award—the Royal Bridesmaids.”
This is rude, M“NAB of Inverness. If you know anything except
the art of Carney, you should be aware, that the height of Circassian
beauty is Fatness. Do you mean to say that the Princess's brides-
maids were exceedingl § Because we happen to know that this
intimation is .# to give great offence, and we recommend you
instantly to write off to each of à. ladies and retract and explain, or
indeed you had better come up to Marlborough House and apply
cannily and respectfully for an interview with the porter, and beg him
to ask one of the footmen to request the butler to entreat the valet to
signify to the lady's-maid to implore the lady-in-waiting to hint to the
Princess, that you didn't mean to be rude to the Bridesmaids. You
two have made a truly awful mess of it, M'NAB and CANDLISH. One
insults the QUEEN, and the other the Bridesmaids. Well, you must

BRIGHT REMARKS ON RECOGNITION.
STATsars sº
.* R () P o S 3;
º
THE respectable “MANHATTAN” is of opinion that, if “JEFr. DAVIs”
would only “talk Union,” the United States might be reconstituted
under “JEFF.” as PReside NT, vice ABRAHAM LINgoLN deposed. He
thinks that would be a happy settlement of the Yankee difficulty. The
solution thus described by the worthy who represents Northern public
opinion in the Standard, bespeaks national sharpness, and may be con-
sidered a bright idea. It is also contemplated as a possibility by MR.
BRIGHT. . That possibility is one of MR. BRIGHT's reasons why we
should not recognise the South. Hear the Hon. Member for Birmingham
-and Washington:—
*Is it not possible that the Northern Government might be beaten in their
i. and that, by their own incapacity, they might be so humiliated
before their people that even what you call the peace party in the North, but which
I say is in no sensetº: party, might unite with the South, and the Union be
reconstituted on the of Southern opiuions?”
...MR. BRIGHT differs from “MaNHATTAN” in hoping that the possi-
bility which he contemplates will not become an accomplished fact.
Punch, however, would very much like to know whether, if the American
Union could be restored on no other terms than friend “MANHATTAN’s,”
friend BRIGHT would not be glad to see those terms accepted, and the
United States re-arranged upon a Southern basis under JEFF. Davis,
comprising the old American institutions, slavery and all?
But if friend BRIGHT wishes, above all things, for the abolition of
Negro slavery, he should flourish his broad-brimmed hat, and shout
“Hooray for Secession!” Because, if North and South were to
become two nations, North would at least be able to hold its own, and
would therefore of course repeal the fugitive slave-law. Where:
upon all the niggers would incontinently run away, if they chose, and
throw, themselves into the arms of the Northern citizens, which would
doubtless be wide open to receive them,
All that we now know is, that, friend BRIGHT would be glad to see
the American Union restored with the North uppermost; but that, if it
were restored, he would be sorry to see the South uppermost. Hear
him again :-
“I have faith in the moral government of the world, and therefore I cannot
believe that that will take place; but if it were to take place, then the Union, with
its great armies, its great navy, and its almost unlimited forces, might offer to drive
the English out of Canada, the French out of Mexico, and whatever nations are in-
terested in them out of the islands of the West Indies, and you would have a great
State built up on slavery and war, instead of that other State to which I look, built
up on an instructed people, on general freedom, and on morality in Government.
(Oh 1 and cheers).”
No wonder that the collective wisdom cried "Oh!” at the foregoing
argument, and that the contrary element in the House of Commons
exposed itself in cheers. Suppose, friend BRIGHT, that we recognise
the South, and that thereupon the Union is presently re-established, as
you say, "on the basis of the South” fºr thinks, with you, that
they would be likely enough to unite with, the North in offering to
drive us out of Canada. But do you think that they would be induced
to join, rather than not to join, in that º: to plunder by the
remembrance of our having befriended them by recognition? Do you
believe that their ingratitude is so positive, and impulsive, and mad,
that they would actually be disposed to resent, more, highly than they
would resent indifference, the sympathy received by them, when it was
asked for, at our hands? - -
On the other hand, suppose that the South caves in, or that the
North succeeds in its design to exterminate its Southern opponents.
Considering the Yankees' present feeling towards us, do you think that
the steadiest and most, long suffering perseverance in our existing
neutrality would abate by one jot their determination of taking the
first opportunity to humble England and “punish John Bull, at his
door”—or his settlements in Canada or elsewhere f -
Pointing to the above quoted examples of MR. BRIGHT's unreasoning
eloquence, Mr. Punch could not help saying to his little boy, "Behold,
my son, with how little wisdom an orator can harangue the House of
Commons.”
OUT-OF-DOOR GAMESTER, AND SUMMER SPORTING
REGISTER.
Music and Cricket Combined.—The player should procure a copy of
LILlywhite's Cricket Scores. There the young amateur will discover
how by practising his scales every morning, he may ultimately succeed
in making several good runs. The book is full of notes, and, beside
the º above mentioned, contains the reports of the speeches
made by the M. C. C. on the subject of Cricket, which are really very
good examples of Stump oratory.
Mems for Cricketers.-The good player must never on any account
lose his temper during a game; the moment the batsman is angry he
will be put out.
Aquatics.-July 16. In Southampton Water. Match between two
Captains' gigs drawn by Sea Horses.
Fishing.—We are sorry to announce to the Disciples of old Izaak, that
there will be no fishing in Devonshire this year. Nearly every stream
has been taken up for brawling, and sentenced to be whipped.
Dean Hook.--No, Sir, you can't expect to catch many fish by trolling
a ditty on the banks of a river. Troll one line of it, that’ll do.

Fleet Street. The race between these two men came off on Tuesday
last. There were two Heats. In the first “Jo” ran the “Gentleman.”

bition was really remarkable.
Two Correspondents write to inform us that they met Three Days

Rackets.-The Great Contest of the Season came off a few days ago
at Nottingham. . The men of Notts played a Tie.
Approaching Festivities.
The Anniversary Fête of the Worshipful Company of Tanners will
this year be held in Hyde Park. The first game for their children will
of course be hide and seek. Two Policemen and a member of their
own Society will keep the gates; this guard is familiarly known as Two
Bob and a Tanner.
Roy AL RIDDLE.—Who is, as a rule, the oldest Monarch in existence?
The King of H'eighty (Hayti). |

THE WIMBLEDON PRIZE MEETING.
The Secretary of the National Rifle Association having received
notice that ºal. Punch has been selected to represent his corps
for the QUEEN’s Prize, begs to forward to him the following regulations
for the Meeting at Wimbledon, on July 7, 1863, and to express his best
wishes for F. P. P.'s success.
1. Camp Orders.-No one is to sleep in more than two tents at once.
Snoring not allowed until 11 P.M., and then only in unison with the
drone of the bagpipe which will give the key-note. The Camp Guard
will be selected at 9 P.M. from those who can distinctly pronounce the
countersign “Statistical Calculations.” The Captain may not, fall in
with his men, but all must be on the ground at 10 P.M. The picket will
reverse arms, sections outwards, dress by the right, and advance by
subdivisions at the halt. A bath will be provided for each corps—pool
tickets sixpence each. Dinner at 6 P.M., including a haunch from the
“running deer,” and two pulls at the Harrow Cup.
2. Small Bore Regulations—The following excuses for failure in
shooting will be disregarded:—That the competitor forgot to clean
his rifle, or to alter his sight, or to put in a bullet, that he put two
bullets in, that he had too long a walk, that he was shaken in a 'bus,
that he has no appetite, that he dined out and had too much—well-
salmon, and had in consequence too high elevation, that just as he fired
the target suddenly took two paces “right close.” That his rifle being
left all night without a nose-cap, it took cold in the barrel, which no
º could prevent. That he rammed down a Seidlitz powder by
mistake, and swallowed a Government cartridge before breakfast. That
he forgot to make proper allowance for the rotation of the Earth, the
attraction of the Moon, and the idiosyncracy of theasymptote trajectory
of the trygonometrical barometer.—N.B. No one is to take off his cap
for a stripped bullet.
3. In the Lords and Commons competition, any position will be
allowed, but no motions or speeches. The Members will be selected
by divisions, and in any disputes about the sights, the “ayes” have it.
All complaints, including swollen right cheeks (Wimbledon mumps),
are to be referred to the Secretary’s knickerbockers. The Enfield
pattern Government “gas-pipe” will be used by all light troops. One
of the Council by rotation § t -
to be shot at.
4. Ladies' Consolation Prizes.—Two shots at 880 yards for “a missis
as good as a mile.” Competitors may go in for this in Hythe position,
kneeling, and present arms; but muzzle-stoppers are not allowed, or
any salute except on duty and for a shootable match.
ZADKIEL’S SPIRITUAL VISION.
In the case of MoRRIson v. BELCHER, a British jury has decided it
to be libellous to call ZADKIEL an impostor–though libellous only to
the damage of 20s. MoRRIson, alias ZADKIEL, being under cross
examination, a question was put to him by MR, SERIEANT BALLANTINE,
touching a spirit which he asserted to have appeared in a crystal ball;
“a spirit,” he said, “who called herself Eye.” The following colloquy
ensued on a remark made by the learned Serjeant:-
“The witness. She represented herself as Eve.
“The Lord Chief Justice. How? Did they communicate by word of mouth?
I thought it was all by way of vision."
My Lud, your Ludship is about right. It must have been by way of
vision, inasmuch as it was all my eye. -

A WORD WITH M. THALBERG.
MoNSIEUR THALBERG, Monsieur THALBERG, what are you about,
Sir P What d'ye mean by frightening us by letting it be advertised that
your performance at the Crystal Palace last week was your “farewell
recital”? No doubt you love retirement, everybody does, but you
have surely not the cruelty to think of it at present?, Your villa near
to Naples is no doubt a sweet retreat, but to think of it at present
would be simply villa-nous. ... Recollect, you have a duty to perform to
the public, and the public will not let you off from, your performance.
While you give us so much, pleasure, you must not consult your own:
we love your play so much that we would always have you work at it.
A few bars’ rest is all that we can let you take; or come, say a few
months’, if you really do require it. Yes, HALLá is delightful, and so
is ARABELLA: but because a tart is sweet, are we to have no turtle *
There is nobody to fill your place, Sir, if you go: for nobody can make
the piano sing as you can. A piano is to many a piano-forte-et-dure,
an instrument of horribly excruciating torture. But in your hands a
É. never can torment, it can only charm and gratify. With Miss
BLANK, and some few other hundred ; who shall be nameless, a piano
is a box of tinkling jangling wires, which serve only to emit a stupid jig
or senseless polka. With you it is for sweetness as the voice of JENNY
LIND; and for fire and force and fulness, as the orchestra of MELLON.
So don’t talk of retirement if you please, good MonsLEUR THALBERG.
It is a pleasure to hear you play, and we have not so many pleasures
that we can well afford to lose one. And why should you retire? There
is no lack of life about you. Your right hand has not lost its cunning,
nor your left one either—that is, if you have a leſt, which your playing
makes one question. It is a tempting thing no doubt to try the Southern
lazy faire, and join the Naples lazy-roni; but you must not think of
leaving till the ladies give you leave, and, with Judy at their head, the
ladies all protest they cannot part with you at present.
VoI, XLV.

[JULY 18, 1863.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
| Monday, July 6. “Ha, ha! Cured in an instant l”. Mr. Punch has
not the faintest idea as to what he meant when he wrote the preceding
sentence; but he is quite certain that whatever it meant, it could have
no reference to the fact that the Domes having been smashed, MR.
GLADstone snubbed, MR. DISRAELI shouted down, and the Rebellion
settled, LoRD PALMERSTON's slight indisposition vanished, and he was
in his place again to-day. The phrase seems meaningless, but it, may
remain. No executions have followed the subsiding of the rebellion,
LoRD ELCHO has not been ordered to be shot by the English Eight at
Wimbledon, MR. HENLEY has not been condemned to attend a series
of Social Science Meetings at Exeter Hall, nor is MR. Doulton to be
drowned in the Thames over which there gently spreads the aroma
from his potteries. It is to be hoped that this lenity on, the part of
Government will not be productive of ill effects, and we will accept the
significant cheer which greeted the PREMIER as an indication that all
persons concerned in the revolt have resolved to become good partisans
for the future. - -
The London, Chatham and Dover Railway is just now Everywhere.
No matter into what out-of-the-way nook you go in the most distant
recesses of the country, you, find works which are expounded by a
ainted board to have connection with the L. C. and D. line. It must
; a very difficult and curious F. to get from London to Chatham
and Dover, and except that nobody in this world ever goes to Chatham
who can help doing so, and that Dover is expressly made to be got
away from as soon as possible (not the more slowly for the frantic
charges at the hotels) one would exult, in the engineering, genius
that is called out by the construction of the line. Among other dis-
coveries the makers of the line find out the fact, that we cannot go to
cheating Chatham and dear Dover without blocking up St. Paul's
Cathedral. Of course, in these days, one would pull down Cathedral,
Abbey, or Castle that in the slightest degree interfered with a railway
conspiracy, and therefore it is matter of congratulation, that St. Paul's
is only to be secreted, not demolished. . A mild attempt on the part of
ALDERMAN SIDNEY to get a hearing for the City of London on the
subject was scouted indignantly. - -
LoRD PALMeRSTON º; mentioned that the House did not desire
to sit much beyond the end of the month. We should think not, and
if it does, we shall not be detained by its desire. We shall close our
record at what we consider the proper time, and simply remark, in the
spirit of a song with which the late MRs. FITZWILLIAM, en garçon,
amused us about ninety years ago:-
“The Lords and the Commons we'll lay on the shelf,
Fal a lalla, ah, fal a lalla,
If you want any more you may sing it yourself,
Fal a lalla, ah, fal a lalla.”
Touching Poland, the PREMIER was glad to be able to say, that
England had adhered to her standing policy of not contracting pro-
spective arrangements with regard, to events which cannot be precisely
foreseen. This means, in English, that if France goes to war with Russia,
we are not bound to help France.
MR. AYRTON then came forth with the profane proposition to put an
end to the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition. It is painful to have
to advert to such irreverence, but duty before delicacy. We are there-
fore reluctantly compelled to write, that MR. AYRTON ridiculed the
Commissioners and their doings, scoffed at Arcadia, sneered at the
Boilers, abused the International, hinted at intrigues at which the
House had, he said, manifested “indignant disgust,” and declared
that as the Prince who alone of all concerned had really devoted himself
to the promotion of Science and Art had passed away, the body over
which he had presided (and MR. AYRTON somehow introduced the
word Parasites) was no longer to be tolerated. But the House was not
in a humour to push victory to excess, and after a very short debate,
MR. AYRTON’s proposition was negatived by 165 to 42.
| LORD NAAs protested at great length against our proceedings in
China. M.R. SEYMoUR FitzGERALD dwelt with ability upon a question
which is of too much importance to be neglected, and which Govern-
ments and Oppositions ought to consider apart from political questions,
namely the increase of Russian influence in the China seas and parts
adjacent. . LORD PALMERSTON admitted that Russia had largely
encroached on Chinese territory, but said that France, Russia, and
England were agreed on a policy. Does this mean that we are to
balance Russian encroachments by seizures of our own Government,
of course, defended itself in regard to our assistance to the Imperials.
The worst of adhering to the Imperial is that it involves a Tip—eh,
MR. CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUERP
LoRD PALMERSTON, some little time back, you know, proposed
to move two votes, one for the International, the other for Fortifica-
tions. The first he thought so pressing that he caused his Lieutenant
to ask it in the absence of his chief, which was done, with indifferent
success. The second, being only a matter of national defence, his Lord.
ship kept until he could attend to it himself, as he did to-night, and
with great ease obtained £650,000, for the defence of the dockyards and
arsenals, for defending Dover and Portland, and for the creation of a
Central Arsenal.
Tuesday. LoRD NORMANBy asserted that anarchy of the most horrible
kind reigns in Greece. The Greeks do not appear to be in the most
delightful state of contentment with their improved prospects, and that ||
is the truth.
We stated that when the CHANCELLOR introduced his Bill for revising
the Statute Law, we were so astounded at the magnitude of the work
to be done as to be incapable of expressing our ecstasies. Being now
a little better, thank you, we are happy to say that the Bill has been
read a Second Time, and that there is good prospect of the Laws being
boiled down into a decent dish of justice. Law is like spinach, and can
lie in a very small compass, if you will take away the gammon.
If Salmon is not sixpence a pound instead of half-a-crown, next
season, we shall insist on the Irish Members being impeached for their
incessant debates on the subject. Meantime Englishmen, as usual, are
ing practically to work while Irishmen talk. There are, thanks to
MR. FRANK BUCKLAND,"very good Salmon in the Zoological Gardens,
and we hope that ere long Salmon cutlets will be added to the very
excellent refreshments obtainable there.
MR. BAILLIE CochRANE does not like the architecture of London
and wishes a permanent Bricks and Mortar Minister appointed instead
of the Works., M.R. CowPER declared that he was excessively perma-
ment, at least that his office was, and that its duties were excellently
performed. The House was with him by 116 to 24.
LORD A. CHURCHILL introduced a Bill (not to be considered this
year) for settling the Church-rate question by abolishing penalties for
non-payment. ALDERMAN SIDNEY justly and wittily remarked, that
CHURCHILL's proposal was enough to make the Church ill.
It was being explained how infamously the Indian Government had
treated HIs HIGHNESs Azer:M JAH, of the Carnatic, when the House,
unable to bear the recital of his wrongs, was Counted Out.
h'ednesday. The House of Commons was creditably occupied. A
Bill, promoted by M.R. PAULL, for preventing the murder of small birds,
WaS a Second Time. The idiotic persons who shoot these useful
little creatures, and the execrable blockheads who poison, them, are
doing more mischief to agriculture than can easily be imagined. The
better class of farmers repudiate the practice of slaughter, but it is the
stupid jackass who plugs up live mice, in trees, won't plough on a
Friday, nails a horse-shoe over his door, burns a calf to cure disease in
his cattle, thinks the Census unlucky, and refuses to make agricultural
returns, who kills the little birds, and grins approvingly when the
Sparrow Club, vaunts, oyer gin-and-water, of its cowardly murders.
Nothing but the law, and a good, kick, can persuade such folks that
Providence did not send birds to do good. . A clergyman at Worthing
says that the miscreants in that demoralised region killed 13,800 gold-
finches in one year. , Government is in favour of the Bill, and so is MR.
ScLATER-Booth, who is related to the excellent Secretary to the
Z. G., and talks with authority upon ornithology.
LoRD RAYNHAM, who is always trying to do kind things, moved the
Second Reading of a Bill for putting an end to the brutalities we read
of as perpetrated upon the “Casual Poor.” He wishes to constitute a
tribunal for helping the helpless. SIR BALDw1N LEIGHToN talked
nonsense against it, as might be expected, and MR. AYRTON made a
remark which is worth notice. He was obliged to LoRD RAYNHAM
“for sparing the Metropolitan Members an invidious task.” That is,
the Metropolitan Members do not like to offend Bumbledom. Imagine
gentlemen afraid of Beadles | The Bill was generally approved, but
was withdrawn for amendment of detail. -
Then, in opposition to the Government, which is now regularly
defeated at least once a week, and sometimes oftener, MR, LAIRD
carried by 119 to 44, majority 75 against the Ministry, a Bill for com-
pelling the Mercantile Marine to test the anchors and chain cables used
on board merchant ships. Of course the measure was “arbitrary,”
and “interfered with lºsinº and “imposed new duties on the
Board of Trade,” and was, “unwarrantable,” and all the rest of the
cant, but the House thought that the lives of merchant-sailors were
worth looking after.
Thursday. Those two Ionian Judges have persuaded our own elegant
ex-CHANCELLOR CHELMSFORD that they have got a grievance, and he
was eloquent to-night about their dismissal, and demanded papers. The
DURE OF NEWCASTLE thought that their friends would have done more
wisely in abstaining from such a demand, but LoRD DERBY, having a
little surplus Latin left over from Oxford, let it off at the Minister, and
the papers were granted. -
The PREMIER is vigorous about his Fortifications, and to-night
moved the Second Reading of his Bill. M.R. CoBDEN made a speech
against the scheme, and begged LoRD PAM to answer him with reasons
and not with jokes. , MR. Osborn E, therefore, was justified in taking
up the funny view of the case, and did so, and in reference to the PRE-
MIER’s power of controlling the tempestuous spirits in the House,
called him AEolus. LoRD C. PAGET, the once declamatory naval re-
former, ridiculed the “cheese-paring ” policy of economy, and MR;
NEW DEGATE seriously complimented the Liberals on being difficipated

from its thraldrom. Æolus PAM of course stood to his guns in every sense, and
showed that he was ruler of the wind by again getting a vote for raising it to
the tune above noted—division 132 to 62. -
The Bill for selling the Chancellor’s little church livings was read a Second
Time by a large majority, but MR; BARNEs, who had some muddled ideas about
Simony, declaimed against the wickedness of the measure. Mr. WALPoLE, how-
ever, who is a safe guide in such matters, expounded to BARNEs that he was talking
nonsense,
Then the Irish Fishmongers actually brought up, a mass of new alterations
in the Salmon Bill, whereat, the weather being hot, and Mr. Punch's temper a little
aggravated, he snatched up his hat and declared that he would not come back to
the House until those everlasting fishes were finally fried. Next day he went
off to Anerley, on a Wayz-goose chace, and has no idea of what was done on the
Friday, and what’s more, doesn’t care.
--->
A SPLENDID CROP AFTER A COURSE OF POISONED WHEAT.
THE POPE BEHIND A PIPE.
THE POPE might indeed lead a happy life if he would only accept the very
pleasant situation proposed for him in a pamphlet said to have been written by one
of the new members of the French Ministry. According to a contemporary:-
“The proposal of M. DURUY, if he really be the author, is that the Pope, “freed from all tem-
ral cares,” should sit radiant and venerated at the Vatican, encircled by the invisible guard of
urope, and the respect and love of 200,000,000 of men, and should receive from Catholic Europe a
civil list to be expended in “holy works and in religious ceremonies.’”
Sitting “radiant and venerated at the Vatican,” the Pope would surely occupy
a seat more comfortable than that afforded by the Chair of PETER, supported b
bayonets, on which it cannot rest steady, even if their points do not stickup throug
the cushion. What mortal in his senses can desire more than to be “freed from
all temporal cares,” and allowed money enough to spend in his own way? “Do you
want to be a haingel?” said a costermonger to his wife, who had been drunk for
three consecutive days, and was still unsatisfied. Does his Holiness, too, wish to be
an angel? Well, but if he does, under what conditions would he be more likely to
attain to angelic beatitude than those of freedom from, all temporal cares, and
an ample subsidy to devote to pious uses? How much better to sit radiant and
venerated at the Vatican than to squat there gloomy and groaned at, and to expe-
rience the respect and love of 200,000,000 men instead of being regarded by the
great majority of them, with opposite sentiments! Let the Holy Father adopt
the proposal ascribed to M. DURUy, cry. Paz Wobiscum/ to the Italian people, and,
suiting the action to the word, put the pipe of peace in his mouth, and blow fragrant
clouds instead of sulphurous excommunications. He has only to tear up the tem-
poral part of his tiara, and, added to a sufficiency of birds’-eye or returns, put that
into his pipe and smoke it.

Each summer among us makes many a swallow,

WHO IS LORD DUDLEY P
CALM, peaceful, placable, charitable, ever eager to believe the very
best of everybody, Mr. Punch, as may have been remarked, scarcely
eyer finds fault with anything, and almost invariably suggests some
pleasant solution of the most apparently unpleasing state of affairs.
Any kind of atonement is enough for him, and had he lived in the old
days, and been the patron of the Abbey that was burned one night by a
nobleman residing at a neighbouring castle, Count PUNCH would in-
stantly have accepted the celebrated º and explanation, that the
nobleman would not have burned the Abbey if he had not thought that
the Bishop was inside it.
Sometimes, however, in dealing with noblemen and others, Mr.
Punch's pacific subtlety is considerably taxed, and he has to think
three or four times, and even take his coat off to think the harder,
before he can effect a perfect accommodation between words and ideas.
He owns, (for he loves to take the public into his confidence) that he
has had some difficulty of the kind in reference to a portion of the con-
tents of a pamphlet which is before him, which is written by MR,
LUMLEY, formerly of Her Majesty's Theatre, and which is published
by MessRs. Bosworth AND HARRISON, 215, Regent Street.
This pamphlet professes to give an account of the connection between
MR. LUMLEY, and a nobleman who used to be called LoRD WARD, and
who was made EARL OF DUDLEY by the Ministry, not, as was meanly
suggested, because his large º gives him great influence, at
certain elections (for Peers are not allowed by law to interfere at elec-
tions), but, Mr. Punch is sure, because he must have been a very wise
and clever and statesmanlike nobleman, and if his modesty prevented
this fact from being generally known, it was the more, incumbent upon
the Minister of the Crown to recognise merits of which the people were
not aware. This is rather a long sentence.
Now Mr. Punch is not going into the details set out by MR. LUMLEY.
They are interesting to all who are interested in operas, and noblemen,
and the ſº is not dear. MR. LUMLEY virtually “made” the
opera at Her Majesty's Theatre, and LoRD DUDLEY is the landlord of
that establishment, and it may be supposed to have been largely bene-
fited by the reputation obtained for it by MR. LUMLEY. When the
latter wished to take some benefits, and the MARCHION Ess Piccolomini
good-naturedly offered to come from Italy, and perform what she con-
siders singing for the director who had introduced her to the tolerant
English, Her Majesty's Theatre seemed the place where the little lady
should be heard.” Its exclient manager, MR. MAPLEson, offered the
house, but, says MR. LUMPEy, “the world knows that to Loºp
DUDLEY’s interposition it is due that the present lessee of his Lord.
ship's Opera House was deterred” from performing the promise tolend

treated, and composes his." Narrative of Facts.” e sends a copy to

and protests against the publication. MR. LUMLey’s solicitor declares
that its contents were all ºppº by documents, and asks what
special statements were denied. The answer is that the inaccuracies
are too numerous to be entered upon seriatim, but—
“I may notice that the idea that the Earl contemplated becoming the director of the
. or of carrying it on in conjunction with MR. Lumley, or any other person, is
no e.”
Well, if the idea is not true, it is an untrue idea, but the idea of the
public as to what the Earl's Contemplations were may be crystallised by
the following extracts from letters signed “WARD.” The nobleman
writes to MR.LUMLEY in April, 1853 –
“My dear Sir, “Witley Court, Friday.
had d “I was much obliged by your letter of this morning, telling me what you
one.
“Puzzi having accepted the post of director for this year, it is but just to him,
that he should know for whºm he is acting, and set him to work with vigour.
“Give orders that the Theatre should be put in order, and let us at least, as far
as depends upon ourselves, be º to redeem the time that is lost.
... But recollect nothing is settled absolutely, till I have seen you again, which I
will look forward to doing to-morrow.
“I will send a carriage to Droitwich to wait for you by whatever train you come,
and I will have the announcement ready for Monday morning, if only our principals
have accepted the first mention made to them of an engagement, as it would be
ridiculous to find ourselves the happy possessors of a lease without a troop.”
Ordinary readers may think that this reads very like the letter of a
nobleman who is the director of a theatre, and is giving instructions to
his sub-director. And in another letter, the nobleman may seem to be
entering still more minutely into details, and engaging his company,
and cleaning up his house:-
“Dear Sir, After our last conversation, you will doubtless be surprised to re-
ceive this communication from me, but I do not think matters are at an end as to
opening Her Majesty's Theatre this year even now. WIARDot has consented to the
terms proposed on the part of his wife, and it is only GARDoNI and MoRElli who
make difficulties about terms.
“To-morrow, however, I must settle the matter one way or another, as I cannot
live on in this uncertainty, as it interferes with all my plans.
“Will you kindly write me out the names of the heads of each department, where
they are to be found, and their last year's salaries.
“. If, too, in a quiet way, you can tell Fish to make any preparations in the Theatre,
I wish you would do so; it will not entail much expense, and will put us in a better
position if we do open.
“Where is CoRBARI, and is she free? We must have a second soprano.
come to Spring Gardens to-morrow as soon as I arrive.”
Now Mr. Punch owns, as he said before, that he has had hard work
to reconcile the nobleman's letters with the statement of his solicitor.
How anybody could show himself more resolved to be an acting and
active director than the writer of such letters, it is really difficult to
I will
Say.
But the explanation must be effected, the problem must be solved.
LORD PUNCH is himself a nobleman, and is interested for the honour of
his order, in which he begs most distinctly to state for the information
of mankind, that no unworthy conduct is ever tolerated. Truth, can-
dour, generosity, are among the attributes of the Peerage, or Lond
PUNch would turn his coronet into a basket for his under-housemaid’s
black-lead brushes. Noblemen never say that which is not.
He has done it ! Eurekat, as the Morning Advertiser wrote, or, as a
certain M.P. said, “we have discovered the eureka.”
LoRD DUDLEY is not the same person as LoRD WARD. He has
been changed. Very wonderful things do happen in aristocratic families,
and this must have been one of them. Who’s who, or which is what
we don’t pretend to say. But, Aristocrat to the marrow, Mr. Punch
denies that the noble who wrote those letters could have been the one
who ordered the contradiction. But then comes another question:
“Who is Lord Dudley P*

[JULY 18, 1863.
IRISH QUAKER.
Y chance we saw the
following delightful
advertisement in a
Dublin newspaper:
TQ THE SOCIETY
OF FRIENDS.–A
young Man, aged 28, is
ºilost anxious to be re-
ceived into the Church
of the Society of Friends,
but in consequence of
which he will lose his
situation, as it is con-
nected with the Church
of England. He has a
most respectable ap-
pearance and pleasing
ad is of most
AN
INCHOATE
-
sober and agreeable
habits; has nevertasted
intoxicating liquor, nor
smoked a cigar or pipe,
and can give most re-
spectable references in
, the city: he also is
highly educated, and
would be found pecu-
liarly active at any light
business; wages not to
be compared to respec-
table employment; he
would enter without
mention being made of
salary till such time as
his employer might
judge him worthy of such. Address A. C., Office of this Paper.
This announcement does not seem to call for any remarks, and
therefore we will make a few upon it. Our Intending Quaker clearly
possesses one merit which ought to recommend him to the Friends.
He is not only respectable, and sober, and pleasing, but he is also
Prudent. His conscience orders him to quit the Church of England, or
rather of Ireland (perhaps he has been converted by the anti-Irish-
Church preaching of the Reverend Burn-all Osbohne) but he has his
body to think of as well as what he would probably call his sowl, and
he will not give up, one faith until he sees his bread and butter in
another...We must take his own word for his “high education,”, inas-
much as its hoigth would be computed with difficulty from an ordinary
matical level, º is not indispensable in a society wherein
e will be asked, “What did thee do when thee had done?” He
should not have said that he had never tasted spirits or tobacco, as he
offers a temptation to any worldly-minded shopmen who may be in his
future employer's service to lure the pleasing young man into trying
either or both, and if they succeed, his pleasing address will be some-
what impai d, temporarily. It would be a sad thing to hear him offer
to punch, his employer's head, and say, “If–hic—thee don't shut thy
mouth I'll—hic-knock thy broadbrim into a-hic-cocked-hat and—
hic-make thee look nine ways for First-Day.” As for his offer to
work without º he appears to know his own value in other respects,
so has probably estimated his services correctly, and we fear the young
man, of 28 (Iago's age) is a bit of a humbug. But there are other
humbugs in the world besides A.C., which may mean ASINUS CANTER,
#: so we wish all the luck he deserves to an Irish Quaker of the
ulture.

LORD DERBY AT THE MANSION HOUSE, OR THE
MINISTER “UNDER THE ROSE.”
(Said or Sung by LoRD DERBY.)
How sweet is the charm of a shady retreat
How soft is the º that grows under your feet!
How . the joy of which “ .# knows!”
And the thoughts how sublime, which lie “Under the Rose.”
The Whigs they may fancy they govern the State,
To the world they may seem to prevail in debate;
But now is the season the truth to disclose—
It is I who am Minister “Under the Rose.”
And yet I have friends, who do not seem to see
How great is the gain, of not seeming to be
The controllers of all, and who wish to expose
The schemes they’ve been cherishing “Under the Rose.”
Well perhaps it is time now, to play my own suit,
And to let DIzzy's teeth fasten into the fruit;
But for you, my LORD MAYoR, you’ve a right to suppose
I shall still be a Minister “Under the Rose.”
BRAWLING BRAWLIE.
WILL any Scottish friend send us the name of the parish where this
scene is recorded (in a Scotch paper) to have lately occurred P-
“In a Fifeshire church, a pewowner, on finding his seat occupied by a tradesman
of the place, seized him, and after a struggle in which a Bible was used as a weapon
of offence, the assailant was worsted, and took his seat elsewhere. At the termi-
nation of the service a fight again ensued.”
This must be a lively place, wherever it is. WALTER Scott has a
scrap of an old song about a certain parish where they “hangit the
minister, stickit the precentor, burnt the kirk, and drunk the bell,” and
slily adds that he should like to have known a little of people who were
not .# without wise instincts. We own that (from the gallery)
we should like to have one look, just one, at these devout Fifers. Song
records several odd things about “Fife folk,” male and female, and this
battle certainly deserves to figure in minstrel annals. The affair must
surely have come off in the Free (and Easy) Kirk, unless it was in the
U.P. or Unco Pugilistic. In Erastian England a carnal, institution
called a Beadle would have prevented this stimulus to the devotions of
a congregation, but we agree with DR. CANDLISH that, “the Bible that
Scotland loves.” ought to be used in any way she likes, and we only
hope, in the interest of º that this one which descended on a
combatant’s head was not loaded with the Apocrypha. The parties are
worthy followers of John Knocks.

CHARIVARI. 29
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
IN ENGLAND.
HE truth of the º; that
there is a time and a place for
all things is exemplified by
the subjoined item of the past
week's news:–
INDEPENDENCE DAY
- “ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN
= INDEPENDENCE.-On Saturday last
= this anniversary was celebrated in
= London in the usual manner.
The office of the consulate was
closed; the flag of the United
States was hoisted on the summit
of the buildings, and a large num-
ber of American gentlemen dined
together in the evening. The
- ps belonging to Northern ports
now lying in the docks were gaily
decorated in commemoration of
the occasion.”
The time for celebrating
the anniversary of American
Independence is of course
the Fourth of July. The
# place of all places out of the
uthern States was, on this
last occasion, certainly Lon-
don. Here at least our
Northern guests, are not
fighting to keep: the South-
erners under the domination
of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, as
our forefathers fought to re-
tain American colonists sub-
ject to that of GEORGE THE
HIRD. Within the limits of
this metropolis and this king-
dom, at any rate, they are not
the Yankees' belief that they accomplished their secession
from England by simple conquest; triumphant superiority
in arms. To hold the anniversary of successful insurrection,
not to say rebellion, in the very den of the British Lion
treading on his tail, and gently poking him with a playful
boot-tip, is to compliment that noble animal with credit for
some magnanimity. The British residents in Paris would
hardly have the ºil; generosity, and the taste, in like
manner to celebrate, the return-day of the Battle of
Waterloo in the French capital.
We pause here to ask, whether the Confederates do
not, as they reasonably may, repeat the Yankee boast above-
quºted with brag additional?, Have they not begun to say
The Britishers whipped all the world, the Yankees whi pped
the Britishers, and we whipped the Yankees?” Not yet,
perhaps. Averse to indulgence in premature exultation
they may reserve that saying for Independence Day No. 2.
The foregoing paragraph informs us that on Saturday last
the flag of the United States was hoisted on the summit
of certain buildings. Shouldn’t it have been hoisted half-
mast high P

now is melted into sorrow. No longer we take delight in lifting hair. We

tating heart should be condemned to languish and die for lack of vital
air. It is well, O Albion, you sing of chivalry, but it is not well that your
famed chivalry should pale before and stand aghast at avid Gentile and
ungrammatic Jew. We have ameliorated our military code—go ye and
do likewise with your court millinery. - - -

not till they have slain the false Ogre of Economy by whom sedentary
damsels in distress are cunningly confined in boxes and destroyed with

patience more becomes a Duchess than her plumes. They will picture
to expectant débutantes a Drawing-room filled not with vases but with

that many weary hours are needed to finish furbelows and elaborate a

LIKE A
OBSERVE THE DUSKY
JULY 10th. Friday. Mr. Punch supposes that he must curb his
generous but fiery temper for the future. His bolting away from the
House in the way mentioned last week caused so much consternation
and confusion, that he will endeavour to bear even with the Irish Fish-
| mongers rather than throw the whole legislative machine out of gear.
There was to have been an important Polish debate in the Lords, but
EARL RUSSELL begged EARL GREY to postpone it, as they could not
have the advantage of EARL PUNCH's presence, and the Recognition
debate was to have been resumed in the Commons, but at LoRD
PAIMERSTON's request, made nominally on the ground of the important
military crisis in America, but really for the other reason, this was also
postponed. , LoRD PUNCH will endeavour to attend in his places until
the end of the Session.
He reads that on this Friday the Lords had a conversation about
;Iapan, and that EARL RUSSELL stated his intention of compelling the
TYCOON to comply with treaties, whether he could or not. Also that
in the Commons, MR. BENTINck proposed to limit the speed on Rail.
ways, but Government wisely declined to interfere, MR. MILNER
GIBSON saying, truly, that it was safer to travel fast on a good, line
than to travel slowly on a bad one, and that the interests of the former
ought not to be sacrificed on account of the inferiority of the latter.
Mr. Punch considers, however, that trains ought to start punctually,
and that the doors should be slammed in the face of dawdles, and thus
there would be no necessity for delay while ridiculous people were being
poked at the last moment into the carriages, and we should not have to
make up for lost time.
Monday. Seeing EARL. PUNCH in his place, EARL GREY made his
speech on Poland, and said, with justice, that the situation was far too
| important to justify our being in any uncertainty as to the intentions of
Government. Were we going to war in aid of Poland? EARL Russel I,
answered that we certainly were not, and that anything which we might
obtain for Poland would be gained by the force of reason. EAf,L
DERBY expressed much admiration for the Poles, but thought that
our action ought to be very well considered.
MR. RoeBUCK, who had hitherto kept an anxious universe in suspense
as to his intentions towards America, abused MR. LAYARD, and aban-
doned his own motion for Recognition. He begged it might be
understood that he did so only in deference to LoRD PALMERSTON (for
whom by the bye MR. RoeBuck has lately manifested very demonstra-
tive reverence), but he reminded the PREMIER of his responsibility, and
warned him of two dangers, the possible reconstruction of the Union by
the South, and on Southern principles, and the possible recognition of
the Confederacy by the EMPEROR of The FRENch alone. MR. LINDSAY
justified his own amateur-ambassador efforts. LoRD PALMERSTON
commended MR. RoEBUCK's, conduct, rebuked his language towards
MR. LAYARD, and hoped we should hear no more of Members of Parlia-
ment running on errands between Sovereigns and the House.
A Fortifications debate then produced the usual conflict of arguments
and the usual triumph for PAM.
Tuesday. EARL RUssell, of course, is *. dissatisfied with the
KING OF THE BELGIANs, for deciding that England was wrong in the
affair in Brazil. But this is foolish. When you go to an umpire, you
ought to accept his decision frankly and like a gentleman. Suppose
EARL Russell, walking home late from some party, because he did not
want to make his carriage smell of cigar-smoke, and being a little larky,
between the champagne and the smiles of the young lady he had been
waltzing with, should chaff some other gentleman rather ſreely, and
high words should ensue. Suppose Mr. Punch should come up, and
say in his usual mild and affable manner, “Hullo, you two, what’s up?”
Suppose the two told their stories at once, and Mr. Punch said “John,

the New World, certain other folks would like to keep them till the mills
open for new work. The Government declined to mix up the relieſ and the
emigration question. If noisy old FERRAND would emigrate, however,
to Anywhere (only the further the better), Mr. Punck would advocate
a special grant for the abatement of that nuisance.
Then, as the heat was hawful, we discussed India, and Fire Assurance. ,
Government got its beating early in the week this time, MR. SHERIDAN
carrying against MR. GLAnstone a resolution condemnatory of the tax
on these assurances. MR. GLAPSTONE by no means succumbed easily,
but spouted at Mr. Sheridan like a frantic Fire-Engine, MR, WHAL:
LEY and (MF, HENNessy, voting ironically, of course), got an order
for a return of all the Jesuits in England. Are they to be burned.
What foolery next 2
Wednesday. All Clubs have occasional rows about the dinners, and
the St. Stephen's Club is no exception. But the Senators are a little
º: There are six hundred and a half of them, and their
unhappy cook never knows whether, he has to provide for six hundred
or for six, but he always knows that whether the number be . or
small, everybody wants everything, and wants to have it before anybody
else. They will have #j. cookery, too, instead of sticking to simple
fare. Mr. Punch is far from indifferent to a good dinner, but he does
not think that the refreshment rooms of the House ought to be temples
of Epicurus. Pall Mall is quite near enough for those who cannot be
contented with the humblest diet, say a soup, a fish, two entrées, a
joint, sweets, Stilton, and strawberries, two glasses of Amontillado, A
bottle of Moselle, a bottle of Claret, a Čognac, and a cigar. We admit
that this is convict fare, but it is not absolute starvation, and a true
patriot would be content with this modest refreshment on the nights
when his presence was necessary to the welfare of his country. SIR
John TRELAwNY ridiculed the gourmands, and asked them whether
they would also like their washing done in the House at the expense of
the nation. New rooms are desired, it seems, but the House has
hardly the cheek to vote them. - - -- -
In Committee was discussed the Bill for enabling capitalists to invest
money, on the Limited Liability §º in business firms. MR. Gö.
schEN, the new Member for the City, reasoned well in its favour. M.R.
T. BARING opposed, it on the double ground that it would be wholly
inoperative ...”would do great mischief, and he is at liberty to reconcile
these propositions in a private letter to us which we pledge ourselves
not to read. To the allegation that it was “exceedingly desirable that
money should be freely advanced to a young firm,” Mr. Punch heartily
assents, and hereby empowers and indeed encourages any capitalist to
send in as much money as he likes to the interesting, young firm of
PUNCH, Judy, Toby, & Co. No questions will be asked, and certainly
none will be answered, should the capitalist be so far forgetful of the
true principles of political economy as to inquire, hereafter, what has
become of his tin,
Thursday. The Wimbledon debate between English and Scottish
Members. It was adjourned, and resumed next day, and at the close
the numbers were 1082 to 999, majority for England 83. The ELCHO
Challenge Shield was therefore ordered to lie on the English table.
In the Commons there was a good Brazilian debate, in which MR.
SEYMoUR FitzGERALD brought out the question very lucidly, and the
Government had by no means the best of it. Mr. Punch's Humble-
pie Cartoon, however, renders any other disquisition needless.
MR. Lawson, alarmed at the Drunkenness Statistics, demanded an
*. alteration of the Law. The House by 87 to 21 declined
such action.
Friday. The Lords took it easy, but the Commons had a long miscel-
laneous evening. Competitive Examination was attacked and defended.
Street Music was very properly abused by MR, BAss, MR. CAVENDISH
BENTINck, and MR. MALINs, but Government promised no redress.
Mr. Punch has a suggestion, which might do something. Declare the
Italian Animal to be Game. Then let those who would “pot” him
take out a licence. By this means the revenue would be benefited, the
Income-Tax might be reduced, and in a few years the vermin would be
extirpated. Mr. Chisholm ANstey's case was gone into, but with no
result that will be satisfactory to him. MR. Bowyer tried a defence of
the ex-KING OF NAPLEs with even less satisfactory results, and a
Packet Service debate enabled MR, GLAbstone to signify that he did
not think M.R. CoRRY a civilised being. We must look at MR. CoRRY.
“THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE.”
Dedicated by Mr. Punch to all friends round the Wrekin and on both
sides the Severn.
Shout, jolly Shropshire, and light on the Wrekin
A bonfire that like a volcano shall rise,
And when people ask what you mean by that beacon, , .
Say “Roberts of Shropshire has won the QUEEN’s Prize.”
Bring out your music, bring drum, trumpet ºl down,
Crash for an hour by old Shrewsbury's Čloé º
Sing how he stood on the green bank at Wimbledon,
Rifle to shoulder as firm as a rock.
Cheer him, Church Stretton, and bawl for him, Broseley,
Dance about, Drayton, and clap your hands, Clun,
Well for the County the Serjeant shot closely,
Had he once swerved, gallant GRAHAM had won.
Shout for him, Shiffmall, and boast, Bishop's Castle;
| Old-ſashioned Oswestry, merry and wise,
Scale Castle-hill, and with voice univarsal -
Cry “Roberts of Shropshire has won the QUEEN's Prize.”
Darling Sabrina, who came up when Comus, .
Had fixed the jºi. so tight in her chair,"
Borrow a smile from thy relative Momus,
And come to the Quarry and show thyself there.
Bid thy swift waters break into a gallop,
Thy salmon leap joyfully up at the flies,
For prouder than ever henceſorth is Proud Salop -
Now RoBERTs of Shropshire has won the QUEEN’s Prize.
A RUINOUS ACQUITTAL.
How much does the reader suppose that MR. ADAMs, the eminent
surgeon, defendant in the breach of promise of marriage case, RUSSELL
v. ADAMs, has to pay in the shape of costs, imposed upon him by the
necessity of proving that he had not contracted any engagement with
the lady who sued him for damages on the pretence that he had broken
One :
A Circular from the Chairman and Secretary of the “Adams Defence
Fund,” informs us that the defence of MR. ADAMS's pocket, Mr.
ADAMS's character, MR. ADAMS's practice, and MR. ADAMS's domestic
happiness—for MR. ADAMs is a husband and a father—from the
attempt above-named, has cost MR. ADAMs no less than £1011 9s. 4d.
“Well, but,” says the reader, was not the verdict for the defend-
ant? Did not that carry costs? Had not Miss Russell to pay the
expenses to which she put MR. ADAMs by obliging him to defend
himself against her ?”
Miss Russell had to pay £300 out of those expenses. She has not
paid one farthing of them. She has paid, under the Bankruptcy Act,
four months' imprisonment to the justice, such as it is, of her country.
But she has paid MR. ADAMs nothing; and if she had paid him all that
the law required her to pay, he would still have been above £700 out of
ocket. So may you, reader, if you are a doctor, and attend a young
ady gratis without bringing a witness with you every time you visit
her. So may you, whoever you, are, unless you mind how you trust
yourself with a single female and her mother, and take care always to
secure the presence of a respectable fourth party. You may be even
worse off than MR. ADAMs. A British jury, too movable by forensic
eloquence, too unsuspicious of feminine guile, too ready to sympathise
with parents who pretend that they have been disappointed in the hope
of being fathers and mothers-in-law, may saddle you with enormous
damages and the plaintiff’s costs as well as your own, blasting your
reputation, and ruining your professional prospects into the bargain.
Yes, friend reader, thus are you, at any time of life aſter your ma-
jority, liable to be fleeced by any unscrupulous feme sole, who can
employ an attorney to employ a barrister to persuade a British Judge
and a British Jury to lend themselves to the accomplishment of her
design. The attorney, barrister, judge, jury, are all unconscious in-
struments of plunder. The gentſ man of the long robe and the gentle-
man of the blue bag are simply a jemmy and centre-bit, or a pair of
skeleton-keys. , Qf course they know not what purpose, they are used
for. The one believes his instructions, the other his brief. The judge
is a lock that cannot help being picked or forced. The jury is a door
that yields to be wrenched open—too generally with some inclination
towards the adventuress and the quack.
A pretty state of the law, a pretty state of the legal profession' In
the mean time we may state that Letters or Subscriptions to the
ADAMs Defence Fund may be forwarded to J. B. Wºº's. , Hon.
Secretary, 17, Clifton Gardens, Maida Hill, London, W. Subscription
is the only remedy for a wrong for which the law affords none.
Russell v. ADAMs may be your own case to-morrow.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
ST. STEPHEN ESURIENS.
THROUGH Legislation's calm resorts,
From Statesmanship's stern pale,
Within Westminster's cloistered courts,"
Arose a sound of wail.
'Twas not the wrath of roused M.P.'s,
Who KELK and LUCAS tear,
Who fiercely fasten upon Fowke,
Or DILKE refuse to spare;
It was not baited GLADSTONE's cry,
Nor Dizzy's wrathful sounds,
Each, like Actaeon, doomed to fly
His own rebellious hounds;
Nor was 't the shout the indignant House
Sets up when bores will bray,
Small bores, of Whitworth range, or great,
In the Enfield Speaker way,+
But ’twas a cry more terrible,
The cry for food and wine ;
And thus it rang—“We starve—we starve—
We have no place to dine !”
With accents bitter as his beer
BAss urged the piteous plea:
And Burly BENTINCK gave the prayer
His Ben-e-dicite;
And PAT, Q'BRIEN lent the howl
Of Irish hunger keen,
And DILLwyN prayed, “We ask but meat
That’s wholesome, cheap and clean.”
But stern SIR John TRELAWNY rose
And chid the gourmands' cry;
“Corned beef is food for Cornish men,
And kickshaws, I defy; .
Why should not Members with a bun
Orbiscuit hunger stay ?
Let those who cannot fast go home,
And we who can will stay;
From PHILIP drunk to PHILIP dry,
Was Macedon’s appeal;
So from a full to fasting House,
Should turn our Common-weal.”
And fiercely Osborn E rained his chaff
Upon his hapless head,
For whom no choice mahoganies
In rivalry are spread,
Who cannot bring the ready wit
That pays the banquet rare,
And leaves the diner-out unvexed
By STEERs's sorry fare.
And courteous Hoth AM sang the times
By Fogeydom adored
When, save chops, steaks, and kidneys, nought
Smoked on St. Stephen's board;
When BELLAMy's full-bodied port,
Gave gout, and gout to life,
Before Reform brought acid tiffs
And democratic strife.
But thy mild wisdom, placid WILLIAM CowPER,
On dinner's worth the Commons wiselier schooled,
Teaching how tempers seasoned with the soup are,
How those who rule the roast may by the roast be ruled.
Rash are an ill-fed Legislature's toils,
Men must mark, learn, digest, who'd be judicial:
Would you shun party hashes, civil broils,
Then treat not soup or fish as superficial.
How oratory is to cookery kin
PLATO has taught with logic sharp and square,
The Session not all barren will have been,
If it amend the Commons' bill—of fare.
SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
. BROTHER IGNATIUs of Claydon, has turned his attention from eccle-
siastical to equine affairs; having lost his voice, like Falstaff, “a
halloaing of anthems,” he now announces himself, as a Hoarse
Chaunter; we wish him, in his new vocation, every possible success.
The ... new Club for the Society of Friends is to be called the
Pal-ladium. -
In August there is to be a Ladies' Conversazione at Chat-Moss;
chits of girls will be excluded, it being the special object of the Com-
mittee to provide a really scientific and philosophical entertainment,
which shall not degenerate into a mere Chit-chat Moss. - -
The New Hospital for people troubled with Queer Fancies is to be
established in Surrey at Whim-bledon. -
The Great Moneylenders’ Jewbilee is to be held in the course of the
following month; it will shortly be announced under the heading of the
Sixty-per-Centenary Festival. - -

THREE LOWES AND A LIFE.
MR. Bishop, the celebrated legislator and gun-maker had—alas, that
Punch must use the preterite—a little dog, dear to him and, his...It
was his Life, as MR. Bishop himself, who should know, stated, to MR.
QoRRIE, the Magistrate. Taking a cab to Gray's Inn Square the other
day, MR, Bishop took his quadruped Life with him. But not liking to
expose the creature to contaminating association with lawyers, or
fearing lest the dog, might have a propensity to worry black, sheep,
MR. Bishop leaves the animal in the cab, with orders to the driver, to
keep him there. The driver is a wretch, and lets the dog escape...MR.
Bishop's Life runs away, and an old maid called Hicks sees it, “foam;
ing,” and thereupon gives a man sixpence to put it out of its supposed
torture. It was very thoughtful of the old lady, but MR. Bishop is
not grateful for thus having his Life taken away, and, he applies to
MR, CORRIE for a summons against Miss Hicks. The Magistrate
does not think that he can grant one:-
“MR. Bishop : The man first tried to hang the poor animal, and, failing in this,
knocked it on the head. I assure you it is the greatest blow that has ever been inflicted
on me and my family.
“MR. Cohrie: Possibly the lady may have been mistaken; but you cannot show
any intentional “cruelty.”
“MR. Bishop (greatly excited): Was it not ‘cruelty' to me, to my n to all
my family ‘Love me, love my dog.'... It has broken up our peace and happiness at
home. e would not have parted with the dog for half a million of money. Is a
woman to go unpunished for such a crime as for deliberately killing an inno-
*. barmless dog, because it was merely “panting ' a little?
“Me. CoaBIE : The Act does not deal with the lacerated feelings of individuals.
“MR. Bishop : Feelings | This dog was my Life—my wife's, and my niece's Life.
I would sooner have lost every gun in my shop.
“The applicant then retired, but returning almost immediately, with an Act of
Parliament in his hand, he said, A thought has occurred to me, Bir. Cannot I
charge this woman with ‘ stealing' my dog? She hires a man to take it from
Grosvenor Square to a mews in Southampton Buildings, there to be cruelly killed.
Is not that an act of felony ?
“MR. Corrie: Certainly not, unless you can show that she did so for the sake of
possessing its skin or carcase.”
This is certainly the most affecting case we ever heard of Can there
be no reprisals? Is there no animal-old maids love such creatures—
who is all in all to Miss Hicks. MR. Bishop might go and slay it,
and write triumphantly over its grave, “This is where Hicks's All
formerly stood.” We only throw out the suggestion. It is a fearful
thing that the peace and º: of a British home should be broken
up by the demise of a dog that runs away when he gets a chance, and
foams, but love is a mystery and a marvel, as novelists and others have
observed. We cannot say, “Bravo, Hicks!” for the lady was hasty,
but we hope that in time MR. Bishop will forgive her. Suppose that
in an excess of charity he not only forgave her, but took her into his
house, as a Pet and Joy, instead of the lost º That would be a
noble forgiveness, worthy of a Bishop, ſeven a Bishop like WICTOR
HUGO's in Les Misérables.
A FILLIP FOR FAUST.
THANK you, M. Gounop; thank you, MR. Gye; thank you, MR.
MAPLEson. There’s no mistake about it. As produced by your exer-
tions, Faust is certainly Faust-rate. Mr. Punch makes his apology for
not saying so before, but he is not like some clairvoyants who can
criticise by foresight. Moreover, such cascades of praise have spouted
on all sides that he feared awhile to add to the laudatory deluge.
Now, having seen and heard and reflected at his leisure, Punch is ready
to allow that the shower of superlatives has not fallen undeserved, and
he will own that M. Gounod, has produced the sweetest, prettiest, and
pleasantest new opera that, since the first night,of Les Huguenots, the
world has seen brought forth. The music is throughout both pictu-
resque and pretty, and leaves nothing to desire. The Soldiers' March
and Chorus, the Chorus of Old Men (a chorus wearing spectacles is quite
a novel stage effect), with the pretty jewel song and, best of all perhaps,
the spirited duel trio, these are the pieces which most stick in Mr.
Punch's memo , and which he hopes the organ-grinders will not vul-
garise and s º But it is needless here to specify what everybody
knows: or if anyone be ignorant, the sooner he informs himself the
better it will be for him.
The only drawback Mr. Punch felt when he witnessed the perform-
ance, was that M. Gounod had not, set the Brocken Scene. . With
that addition, Faust might have eclipsed Der Freischütz, and even
without this it is not far inferior.

METRICAL SYSTEM.
THE increasing taste for poetry that is a characteristic of the present
practical age, will, in the course of time, attain its legitimate develope-
ment in the universal adoption of a Metrical system of Coina The
application of this system to the ordinary markets, and general run of
business is jº little understood by those financiers who profess the
most intimate knowledge of the subject. As our information may in
every case be certainly relied on, we shall have no hesitation in antici-
ating the official rules which will regulate the future metrical relations
tween vendor and purchaser. Whether the Poet Laureate will be
appointed Deputy Assistant Chancellor of the Exchequer we have
been unable to ascertain, but that he has already been consulted as to
the New Metrical Terms in all Commercial dealings, scarcely admits a
doubt. To prepare the public for the coming small change, he will
publish a serenade entitled “Metre by Moonlight; a Loan,” which
will we are, sure be of great use in º monetary transactions. It is
º that, on entering any shop, after the general legal, adoption
of the Metrical System, the vendor, exposing any article, which can, we
will say, er. gr., be procured for the sum of Twelve pence, shall address
his customer with words to be said or sung according to his, the Shop-
keeper's, ability, thus:–
Sir are you willing
To pay a shilling.
If this is considered extortionate, the rejoinder will be,
That would rob
Me of a Bob.

JOKES FOR “LAUGHING JACKASSES.”
DURING the discussion of MR. Bass's motion for the suppression of
Street Music, several excellent jokes were uttered by Members when
describing the serious annoyances to which hard working statesmen,
mathematicians, authors, and artists were subjected which deserve
to be recorded in Punch, as they provoked an amount of risibility not
usually produced by senatorial eloquence.
MR. Bass said: “From early morning till late at night the inhabitants of the
metropolis were annoyed by incessant discords. Bands were continually playing
north, south, east, and west. That very morning he found four all at work together
in Eaton Square and its neighbourhood, one in front of the residence of SIB Richard
MAYNE, and another before that of the Home SECRETARY. (A Laugh.) It was
a real hindrance to the serious business of life. (A Isaugh.) ºš engaged in
severe mental occupations, like MR. BABBAGE and others were actually unable
during the greater part of the day to continue their studies. Mr. BARBAGE had
told him that one-fourth of his time was consumed by the hindrances occasioned
by street bands, and that in the course of a few days he was interrupted 182 times.
(A Laugh ) The late Lord CANNING told Sir Richard MAYNE that on one
occasion, when writing a despatch of great importance, a serious error occurred
owing to the noise created by a band under his window. (A Laugh)"
LoRD FERMoy maintained that the existing law was sufficiently stringent.
MR. BABBAGE had put it in force on several occasions, and had punished, he
thought unjustly, a great many poor musicians. If street bands were put down
many other things must follow. Huge drays full of bear barrels, even though the
name of “BAss"
annoyance and inconvenience.
might be inscribed on them (a laugh) were a serious |
MR. C. BENTINck could not admit that because the street bands were paid they
ought to be tolerated. He lived in a thoroughfare having a large square at one end
and a street at the other, and which was infested with bands, organs, wandering
minstrels, negro melodists, and every species of musician. (Laughter.) If one
man, in a whole street liked this music or this noise, that was no reason why
all the other inhabitants should be annoyed. Street music not only prevented
people from obtaining rest and quiet, it disturbed them when making calcula-
tions, or even when studying their speeches. (Laughter.)
MR. MALINs thought that every man ought to be protected in the peaceful enjoy-
ment of his own home. He frequently had to endure a grinding organ on one side
and a noisy band on the other. (A #ºgº He had work to do at his own
home which involved a great deal of reading and study, and he had seriously enter-
tained the notion of living away from London in consequence of these nuisances.
He often told his servant to send away street musicians, but they only moved off a
few yards. He was sometimes favoured with a round of the “Old Hundredth,"
beginning about 11 and ending at half-past 12 at night. (A Laugh.) That
was no really laughing matter.
And Ms. BRUCE thought that “It was all very well for those who disliked, or
who possessed a very refined taste for, music to seek to do away with the bands in
the streets; but if the Hon. Member for Derby were to poll his own household he
would find the greater number of votes recorded in their favour (a laugh);
and he did not think it, therefore, desirable that it should be placed in the pºwer
of every churlish person, or every man who happened to be busy, to drive music
out of the streets. (Hear.)"
And so the subject was dropped, and the “Laughing Jackasses”
(May they eat dirt!) are to continue to have their long ears tickled by
the maddening music of the streets.

PERIPATETIC JUSTICE.
THERE are, some people who say that, as a rule, our County Magis-
trates are neglectful of their duty, and that, excepting when a poacher-
the wretch!—is to be punished, they seldom pay much heed to the work
that is entrusted to them. . As a glorious exception to this rule, if it be
such, we beg to cite the conduct of a Magistrate for Worcestershire
who appears to act not merely on the bench, but in the streets, an
besides being a Magistrate, to be one of the 'Police. His flaming zeal
for justice having carried him so far as to commit a man for drunkenness
whom he had previously convicted and fined for that offence, this
*Policeman gave evidence as follows, himself sitting on the
Inch :-
“REDDITCH PETTY SEssions.—” “* MR. HENRY Milward, one of the Magis-
trates, was then sworn (still occupying his place on the Bench). He said, I am a
Magistrate for the county of Worcester. On the 17th day of June instant, at about
half-past eight in the evening, I saw the defendant walking along with a friend, arm
in arm, and he appeared to me to be drunk. I followed him and said, “MR. BAYLls,
you are drunk...I fine you.5s." MR. BAY1 is immediately said, ‘Oh, indeed here it
is... I then said, ‘No, I will not take it, I will send the constable for it to morrow.”
-Cross-examined by MR. SMITH : Was the defendant making any noise?—Witness:
No, he was walking quietly with his friend.-MR. Smith: Did he obstruct the way?
-Witness: No, he did not.—MR. SMITH : Why do you say he was drunk?–Witness:
Because I thought so.-MR. SMITH : Did you, in the exercise of your office as Magis-
trate, and on your own opinion, take upon yourself to fine the defendant in the
street?–Witness: I did. (Sensation in Čourt.)”
Of course we cannot doubt the word of a man like MR. MILwARD,
but if he really heard a drunken man say, “Oh, indeed, here it is,” we
think, it should be noted, as a curious phenomenon. Tipsy men are
usually not distinct enough in speech to say “indeed, here it is,” or
º approaching it. “All ri’ olefler—hic—hereshzefi'bobsh—hic”
would be the most one could expect from a person really tipsy. Of
course, however, MR. MILwaRD heard what he reported, or he would
not have reported it; and we congratulate the shire of Worcester on
the fact that a man there can speak plain when he is drunk, and that a
Magistrate is there not so puffed up by his place, but that he will con-
descend at times to prowl about the streets, and take up tipsy people
like an ordinary Policeman.
A RARE BULL FROM ROME.
THE best portraits of Mr. Punch represent him with a peculiar squint-
This arises from a habit which he has always practised, of looking at
both sides of a question at once. Thus, whilst he is reading his own
aper, he at the same time has an eye H. another; and this, casting
is eye about has given him a cast in the eye. His off-eye, the other
day, running over the Tablet, Ultramontane and Derbyite organ,
alighted on the passage following, penned with reference to, some
judicial proceedings, by the Roman Correspondent of that journal:—
“I will not enter into further detail, as you will receive the trial as soon as pub-
lished, and your readers will be able to judge for themselves whether M.R. LAYARD
is very consistent in denouncing the #. apocryphal atrocities committed in
isolated cases by a peasantry maddened by wrongs and cruelties, while he winks at
the wretches who, not content with poisoning brave men for doing their duty as
soldiers, made targets of their bodies for the purpose of instructing the agents of
the Sect on scientific principles as to the best means of striking a deadly blow at a
“Papalino.’”
What are “the highly apocryphal atrocities” which are “committed
in isolated cases?” If they are highly apocryphal, it is uncertain that
they were committed in any. If it is true that they were committed in
isolated cases, then they are not apocryphal. If the peasantry who
committed them were “maddened by wrongs and cruelties,” then the
atrocities perpetrated by those peasants were not only not º:
but facts doubtless only too true. But º in the mind of the
Tablet’s Roman Correspondent, apocryphal and canonical mean the
same thing. In the mean time we must be excused for hesitating to
take that gentleman's statement as to poisoning soldiers, and practising
assassination on their dead bodies, as Gospel.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 20th. Monday. We shall change the name of CANADA into
CANIDIA, and treat her as an objectionable old woman ought to be
treated if she does not behave herself better than she is represented by
we to do everything for you? Come, take good counsel, and help
yourself. Then, as ALCIDEs remarked to the Carter:—
“Then, should the task too mighty prove,
We may assist you with a shove,
But those who indolent remain,
May roar for aid, but roar in vain."
You know how Salmon spring up and leap º falling water.
Well, the Irish salmon have leapf right up into the House of Lords.
There was great splashing to-night. - -
The Lords have passed the Bill for getting rid of London Tolls after
July next. This is a great thing. But we hold naught done, while
aught remains to do. Now, boys, we must take the Bridges. We are
not freemen while tribute is exacted there. Let us fight the Battle of
Weilo over again at its bridge, smash Southwark, and lay Lambeth
ow.
SIR John Shelley tried to defeat the Bill, which gives Gog and
Magog power to deal with the Van Demons and other fiends of traffic.
But he was desired by SIR GeoRGE GREY to desist, as the measure
was a very useful one. We burn to see the giants rush at their work.
The Great Late Eastern Railway is to be allowed to have steamboats
in connection with its lines. Our naval correspondent informs us that
several are on the stocks, among them the Dawdle, the Laggard, the
Baron Troplard, the Athelian Unready, the Fabius, and the Chancery,
and that the first of them will very likely be in a forward state for
launching about Christmas, 1870. -
The Polish debate then took place, LoRD PALMERSTON clearing the
way for it. MR. HoRsMAN delivered an eloquent harangue, denouncing
the treaty of Vienna, and advocating the re-construction of the King-
dom of º, He prophesied that war would be necessary to effect
that object. MR. GLADstoNE, had the disagreeable duty of throwing
cold water upon the House, by way of obviating any inflammatory
action. He showed the impossibility of getting the Sovereigns to sur-
render their possessions, and argued that, in some respects the change
would be undesirable. He thought we had done our duty in inter-
fering with our argument and protest. MR. HENNEssy adverted to
the Russian admission that legality would be death to the rule of
Russia in Poland, and he desired that legality, as it would be life and
liberty to Poland. M.R. KINGLAKE did not think the restoration
scheme feasible, and praised Austria. After some other speeches, Lord
PALMERsroN defended the course of the Government, dwelt on the
influence which Public Opinion had upon monarchs, reserved announce-
ment of the course which we should take consequent on the Russian
answer, but intimated that the first thing to be brought about was the
stoppage of the slaughter. The French #;" considers, the, English
debate contemptible, and worthy of a selfish nation that will talk as
much astº. please, but will act only when its own material interests
are at stake.
Tuesday. The Lords had another innings at the eternal Fish Bill.
is must certainly be known as the Fishy Session. We are getting
some glimmering of an idea as to the nature of the measure, which
seems intended to assimilate the fish law of Ireland with that of England
and Scotland, and to prevent salmon-murder. We imagine that, the
Bill must be just, because it is so furiously opposed. It has passed.
The Commons talked about Japan, and Mr. LAYARD encouraged us
with hopes that we shall hang the Japanese aristocracy generally, a
slight remedial process which is all that is necessary to our getting on
very well with the Tycoon and his lieges, and which therefore had
better be 'effected at once, in the interest of trade. The very hard
case of MR. Bewicke came up. He fired a pistol out of window,
and some scoundrel sheriff’s, officers perjured him into prison, and
while he was there Greenwich Hospital seized and sold all his goods.
His innocence established, he is released and ruined, but the Editor
of the Book of Praise thinks that it would be establishing a bad pre-
cedent to compensate him, and that a certain average of injustice must
be borne by British subjects.
Our friend MR. DARBY GRIFFITH, of whom not much hath been lately
heard, popped up again, and made some observations which a Minister
said were not unreasonable. We forget what they were about, nor does
it much matter.
Wednesday was chiefly remarkable for the vain attempts of SIR
RounDELL PALMER and SIR GeoRGE GREY to break the laws of the
House. They each tried to bolt before a House could be made. The
Solicitor nearly got out, but was captured and sent back to his place,
but the Secretary was instantly arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
Government as doing. Where’s your Militia, MRs. CANADA: Are j
make little mistakes, which are corrected before the tribunals. The
Bolling Down of Statutes Bill went through committee, and was
foolishly hindered by certain Parliamentary sciolists. Beit mentioned
that this, measure repeals, inter alia, several clauses in ſtagna Charta.
What will Lond Rüssell, say? To be sure the clauses have already
been, virtually repealed for a couple of hundred years. A measure
led the Rum Duty Bill was read a second time, and we must really
protest against so very familiar, not to say vulgar a way of describing
an impost. At the same time we are free to admit that some of our
duties as well as some of our pleasures are exceedingly rum.
Thursday. The Foresters of Birmingham, copying the example of the
Aristocrats of Sydenham, assembled in a great crowd, on the previous
Monday, to see a woman, named Powell, perform some dangerous
feats akin to those performed by a man named Blondin. The scene
was Aston Park, a place inaugurated by the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT,
and devoted (as was supposed in this case and in that of the Crystal
Palace), to rational recreation. M. BioNDIN has not yet been killed,
but MRs. Powell's rope broke, and she died. She would have been a
mother in three months. How the Aristocrats would act under similar
circumstances remains to be seen. The Foresters, continued their
revels, danced, and finished with fireworks. The subject was brought
before Parliament by LoRD MALMESBURY and MR. Doulton, and the
answer of Government is, that no doubt such things are very deplorable,
but as the public likes such exhibitions “it is difficult” to interfere, but
the Press (to which it is sometimes very convenient for great folks to
appeal, and which at other times it is 3. convenient to repudiate),
is requested to express itself st on the matter. We conceive that
we do so by simply stating the adding that the plea of the
Government is a unworthy one. If the very highest idea of a
Government is, as SYDNEY SMITH *º Stout Constable, even that
ising exhibitions, SIR George GREY
officer.s vent demoral
himself could interfere when M. Blondin Fº to carry a child—
not unborn—along the Sydenham r arliament would give him
a prohibition Bill in three days, if he is afraid to act without one.
LoRD PALMeRSTON, in reply to MR. SEYMoUR Fitzger Alp, entered
into the Sleswig Holstein ... and said that Denmark would be sup-
ported against any improper action by other powers, meaning Prussia
º: Austria. “They would not have to contend with Denmark
alone,
MR. CoBDEN renewed his protest against the supply of ships to the
Confederates, and LoRD PALMERston replied that the case was not one
a belligerent and a rebel, but of two belligerents, and that according
to the doctrine of the Americans themselves, a neutral may supply a
belligerent.
SIR CHARLEs Wood and his India budget. India is Paying.
Friday. LoRD SHAFTesbury concluded his Parliamentary work for
the year with a speech worthy of himself. He called attention to the
injuries and cruelties inflicted upon Children engaged in certain manu-
factures and occupations, and he showed that thousands of white
children are in all save the name, iii treated slaves. We recommend
the details of his speech, painful as they are, to the attention of sub-
scribers to missionary societies, and spouters against American slavery.
An animated debate on Poland. LoRD RUssell modified the decla-
ration that England would not go to war with Russia. LORD STRAT-
FoRD condemned the “brutal” feeling of Russia towards the Poles.
LoRD MALMESBURY thought that we ought not to have remonstrated,
but ought to have withdrawn our Ambassador. LoRD ELLENBoRough
thought we ought to enforce our demand.
The Commons held their last Conversazione, and multifarious were
the topics. The SolicitoR-General gave M.R. Pope HENNessy, a most
severe snubbing for his opposition to the Statutes Revision Bill, and
called him a smatterer who had crammed himself with notions from an
old edition of BLAckstone, a little Hymn of Praise like that sung by
the converted pugilist over the body of Colon EL QUAGG. University
Tests came up, MR. HENLEY was very amusing, and the Finance
Minister, who is also the Minister of Religion, insisted that “a definite
faith must have a set of tests,” though he thought the present ones
might be amended. MR. MILNEs complained of the Abbey charges for
admitting Monuments. MR. Cox dwelt upon the frightful increase of
Infanticide; MR. HUNT expatiated upon the immorality of crinoline;
and MR. KINGLAKE urged that we should help Poland. LoRD
PALMERSTON answered these and other speakers, spoke hopefully of
Greece, promised a scheme for utilising the Exhibition Land, and
pledged himself to act in concert with France and Austria as to Poland.
So ended the last Friday of the Session, for on -
Saturday, at the Trafalgar, MRs. HART expected every man in the
Cabinet to do his duty by her Whitebait, and was not disappointed.
Last from St. Martin's-le-Grand.
The same day JUDGE BRAMweLL declared in open court that if LoRD
PALM ERsron were put before him “he would try him like . other
man.” It is truly gratifying to behold how equal are all Englishmen
before the law. The French say they are, but the French sometimes

reasons which we here subjoin :-
For saying that KING WILLIAM shook his
head last Wednesday, but there is reason to
suppose that there was nothing in it.
or saying that in É.i a person may
talk politics without being beheaded for it.
For criticising the appearance of Bockum

some one had been somewhere heard to say
he wore a white one.
For quoting the statement in Joe MILLER's
English history, that KING CHARLEs THE
FIRST walked and talked half-an-hour after
his head was cut off.
For using the word “pig-headed” in a
leading article about the KING OF DAHo-
MEY, it being obvious that KING WILLIAM
was the personage referred to.
For prophesying that the time will come
when Prussia will no longer have a tho-
roughly free press.
For saying that a Policeman was found
last week in London in the act of kissing a
Cook: this statement being invented with
the view to bring discredit upon Police
constables in general, and those in Prussia
in particular.
For stating as a fact in Natural History,
that a Cat may look at a King, even though
he be a Prussian one.

NOISY NEWS-CRIERS.
LITERATURE is a good thing, and so is exercise of lungs; but
sometimes when combined they are productive of a nuisance. This
the calling of cheap newspapers by loud-voiced little boys has of late
in London most undoubtedly become. No sooner does Mr. Punch get
into a train of quiet thought than the 'Apenny O'born Times is dinned
into his ears; and this in a few moments is followed by the Penny
Newgate News, or the Farthing Strand Gazette.
Nearly every parish has its local “organ” for expressing its opinions,
and these organs are almost as great a nuisance as the barrel ones, for
their names are bawled and shrieked and screamed and squalled about
the streets in a manner quite distracting to men of quiet habits, and
who are not deaſ. On a Sunday morning, too, when after six days'
row one sighs to be at peace, some of the cheap weekly papers are still
cried; and the bellowing of their names is as much a crying nuisance
as that of “Chayny owringe,” or “Fine fresh Hob-o-o-oy,” with which
one’s ears are tortured later in the day.
Whether the Police have power to stop these criers is a question
which SIR. Richard MAYNE may kindly look to; but as penny news-
papers are a new invention, it is doubtful if old Acts of Parliament
extend to them. Mr. Punch would therefore ask that a Bill for the
Relief of Quiet People like himself should be brought in by the Govern-
ment without the least delay; and he trusts that in the meantime full
permission will be granted him, and all tormented persons, without any
risk of finding themselves fined for an assault, to wollop, welt, lick, cuff,
kick, thrash, and summarily punish any penny-paper-crying brat whom
they can catch.
Thoughtful Editing.
THE new number of the Quarterly seems arranged with reference to
the season. The prominent articles are, the Glacial Theory, the Church
of Rome, and Spiritualism. Come, Ice, Wafer, and Liqueur are not bad
hints in this weather.

GORTSCHAKOFF TO GREAT BRITAIN.
WE have pleasure in observing that LoRD RUSSELL owns the fact
That a barren controversy it is idle to protract;
From unnecessary argument we’re glad that he abstains,
And a practical solution of the question that remains
With us wishes to arrive at—much we thank him for his pains.
Every party to a Treaty—let us grant what’s very true—
Has a right that same to construe from that party's point of view;
That’s to say provided always its construction’s so far fair
As to rest within the limits of the sense the text will bear.
Bootless is that right exerted; act upon’t for ought we care.
Of a Government the basis, if the governors are wise,
In the confidence not only of the governed, mind you, lies;
But as much, and, I may rather say, in ſact, a great deal more,
In respect for its authority, which force must first restore;
Then pacific moral measures we may try, but not before.
Those demands which you invite us so politely to concede,
But express our august master's gracious will; they do indeed.
They "re ukases long ago decreed in his imperial brain:
That is where they are at present; that is where they must remain.
Ere we can say more about them order must in Warsaw reign.
You for Poland ask a Charter framed with points in number six,
Much his Majesty thinks of them, but that they’ll result in “mix,”
Won’t restore the reign of order, won't appease unquiet souls,
Won’t keep down a population, whom, save terror, naught controls,
For they don’t express the wishes of the sanguinary Poles.
Whilst our Fmperor's intentions must in contemplation rest,
An armistice is of all things an impossible request,
'Twould amount to a concession which we really couldn’t stand;
Bayonet we cannot lay by, hold artillery and brand,
Drop the scourge, take down the gallows, stay the hangman's busy hand.
We can let no European Congress those six points discuss
With irrelevant palaver, most impertinent to us,
Dignity forbids us too with France and England to debate
Qn administrative details, special to the Russian State,
Ordered all by an omniscient autocratic Potentate.
But two other States there are with us indissolubly bound,
In a solidarity so strict we share one common ground, -
Since we three divide that kingdom which we three combined to seize;
Them we shall be very happy to accept for referees:
We’ll arrangements make with Austria and with Prussia, if you please.
But until the Polish rebels to submission shall return
We sh. shoot them, hang them, flog their women, waste, destroy and
urn.
So excuse us if we don't accept your liberal invitation;
To do nothing of the kind it is our fixed determination: .
You may all accept the assurance of our high consideration.
The Best of Albert Monuments.
IT is announced that the people of Belfast intend to erect a stately
clock-tower as the local memorial to PRINCE ALBERT. This design
shows Belfast a great deal faster than it was generally thought to be.
Belfast indeed may be said to be a Bell as fast as the Clock which it
proposes to dedicate to the memory of the PRINCE CONSORT. There is
a smart graceſulness in the idea of a testimonial which will indicate the
Prince to be a man of all time.

ADDRESS.
IT has been the wisdom of the Aristocracy of England, ever since the first institution of that Order, to keep the mean between the two
extremes of too much stiffness in refusing, and of too much easiness in admitting any variation|from its habits.
The Aristocracy may confidently appeal to the readers of the History of England, whether the Order has not in other days done its duty
in every relation of society.
It now feels that it has another Mission, and one which it is bound to fulfil, no less by considerations of duty than of interest, to which
latter it has not the affectation of pretending to be more superior than the commercial, artistic, ecclesiastic, or literary world.
For some time past the Public has observed, with curiosity, and it is hoped with gratification, that a large number of Hotel Schemes
have been issued. Projects for the establishment of gigantic Inns in various parts of the Metropolis and of the provinces have appeared, and
the names of the chief promoters of these Hotels have been names in the Peerage. It was rendered evident..that the Aristocracy had resolved
to make a decided move in favour of the comfort and civilisation of society.
This was a tentative movement. It was desired to ascertain whether the opinions of society were sufficiently advanced to permit it to
approve the mingling of its acknowledged and rightful leaders with the class usually engaged in speculative and culinary pursuits.
The result shows that the Public is highly pleased with the determination of the Aristocracy to make.itself useful, and the Hotel Schemes
to which noble names are attached are largely taken up by the classes appealed to... The Aristocracy is therefore justified in making itself still
more useful, and advancing a step further.
ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE By which The ENTIRE SERVICE of THE NEW Hotels AND of others shortLY TO BE ERECTED MAY
BE PERFORMED BY MALE AND FEMALE MEMBERs of THE ARISTOCRACY.
The Upper Classes conceive that by thus bringing themselves into contact with those beneath them, the former will be enabled to do
much towards the civilisation of the latter in the matter of manners, of taste, and at the same time honourable and lucrative occupation will be
found for numerous members of a class which has hitherto been charged with indolence and extravagance.
The first of these Hotels will shortly open (due notice will be given), and the whole Service will be performed by the Aristocracy. $.The
Cook will be a cordon bleu, that is a K.G., and the Butler an eminent ex-diplomatist. The Chamberlain will have filled a similar office at Court.
The Waiters will be selected, with reference to their intelligence and activity, from the Peerage and the Household Regiments, and the
Commissioners will previously have acted as QUEEN’s Messengers.
The public has nothing to fear, or apprehend, from its betters. The strictest civility will be practised, and the soundest morality will be
a sine qua non. No fees to Waiters.
Further particulars will be announced, as will other arrangements by which the Services of Lady Members of the Aristocracy will be
secured for the Female Department of the Hotels.
A Pictorial Representation of the Interior of one of the Establishments of the Noble Hotel-Keepers' Association is annexed, and others
will be issued as occasion shall arise.
Applications and Communications may be addressed to the Hon. PETRONIUs ARBYTER, 85, Fleet Street, London, E.C.

WOLUNTEERING A STATEMENT.
PEOPLE, who like puffs may find one in the following.
We take it from the #. Guardian :-
THE SECOND MANCHESTER RIFLE WOLUN-
TEERS.–LIEUT. Colon EL. J. H. DEAKIN has decided to Clothe
the entire Regiment, numbering some four hundred, strong, with very
W. Scarlet Cloth Tunics and Blue Doeskin Trousers; the Band,
White Melton Tunics and Blue Trousers; the Officers to wear bright
extra superfine Scarlet, with elaborate Silver Lace Embroidery, de-
noting their insignia of rank. The whole contract, exceeding £1,000
in amount, has been entrusted to one of our own talented tradesmen,
MR. IsrAEL LEvy, Shudehill, Army Contractor of Clothing, which he
intends completing the early part of the ensuing month, previous to
the general inspection by §§ officer appointed by Her Majesty's
Government. The band played on Friday evening last upon the
premises of MR. Levy, expressive of their voluntary pleasure of the
clothing and the clothier.
“Reform your Tailors' Bills!” was, once a well:
known notice. “Reform, your Tailor’s Advertisements”
would, if the above be a fair specimen, seem quite as much
to be desired. For of course we must presume that the
tailor was the author of the notice which we quote: the
way in which he puffs himself as “one of our talented
tradesmen” makes it clear that the advertisement proceeded
from his pen. What he means by saying that the band
expressed “their voluntary pleasure of the clothing and the
clothier” is more than, this hot weather, we can undertake
to think. But we can undertake to say that were our
tailor pleased to advertise that we were pleased with clothes
he made for us, we should take good care in future not to
tell him of our pleasure, for we have little wish to see our
name made use of for a puff. -
By the b º, we wonder what the tunes were which the
ban jº “expressive of their pleasure.” Had their
uniforms been green, “With Kerdure Clad”, would have
been quite a proper air for the occasion; but as, their
dress consists of white tunics and blue trousers, while the
uniform of the regiment is of blue and scarlet cloth, we
presume that one of the tunes selected for the evening was
the “Red, White, and Blue.”
The Index to the Mind.
WHEN an Actor “makes up” his face for a performance,
it is a legitimate consequence of his having previously made
up his mind to go on the stage.
COMPENSATION FOR NOBODY.
A Resolution moved by MR. H. BERKELEY, the other night,
affirmed “that the grievances, suffered by WILLIAM Bewicke, as
detailed in his petition, to this, House, presented on the 28th of April
last, are such as entitle him to the consideration of Her Majesty's
Government.” MR. Bewicke's grievances consisted in having been
for the space of one year, confined and afflicted as a felon under a
sentence of penal servitude, in the loss of property occasioned by for-
feiture of his goods, and in ruined health, the consequence of misery.
He, an English country gentleman, was the victim of a conspiracy
trumped up by bumbailiffs on whose false evidence he was found guilty
of firing on them in the execution of their duty, with intent. His
entire innocence having been subsequently proved, he received a free
pardon for having been condemned by mistake, was let out of gaol with
a shrunken frame, and had the proceeds of the sale of £1800 worth of
goods restored to him in the sum of £430, minus £50, deducted for law
expenSt S.
The Solicitor-GENERAL thus showed cause why justice should be
denied to this gentleman:—
“A somewhat similar case would be remembered, in which a clergyman was
convicted of a very serious charge, lost his appointment in consequence, and was
imprisoned; but the principal witness against him was afterwards convicted of
perjury, and he then received a pardon. That would be a case for a claim against
the Government, and nobody could tell how many such claims would be made, or
what would be their magnitude, because in the exceptional case of MR. BARBER, the
House of Commons, acting on the report of a select committee, had thought fit to
award a pecuniary compensation.”
The case, the SoLICITOR-GENERAL says, is common. Ay, lawyer,
it is common. So common, you say, that, if redress were granted to
MR. BEwicke, “nobody could tell how many such claims would be
made, or what would be their magnitude l’” Pleasant information,
this, for English gentlemen who sit at home at ease and dream, or have
hitherto sat and dreamt that British justice is superior to forei Any
one of them may, at the next Assizes, be degraded through perjury
from a 'squire, to a felon, imprisoned, outraged, disabled, beggared, or
if by chance, “pardoned” for his innocence after having been punished
for it a year or so, refused any reparation of the cruel wrong which has
been done him.
The reason why no amends can be made for the penal, maltreatment
which a man, as in MR.:Bewicke's case, has been subjected to by legal
fallibility is, according to the SolicitoR.GENERAL, because such cases
|are so numerous that to do them justice would be very chargeable.
Government cannot pay its creditors of this description. Their multi-
tude is too great for the satisfaction of their claims.
But then, how is it that compensation is awarded to Proctors, and
other practitioners in reformed Courts, for the merely anticipated loss
of their business?, Nay, if the State cannot afford to do justice, it may
as well treat all hands with impartial iniquity. Who is entitled to
compensation if MR. Bewicke is not? Let No Compensation be the
cry with which the SolicitoR-GENERAL, at the next election will go
to the hustings. No Compensation for people driven over by other
| º, No Compensation for killed and wounded by railway accidents.
o Compensation for anybody
MR. Bewicke defended himself at his own trial. Surely the SoLICI-
Top-GENERAL does not think that he ought, therefore, to be made an
example of.
As the Government declines to help the unduly condemned, could
they not help themselves? Suppose MR. Bewicke, the Clergyman
alluded to by the SolicitoR-GENERAL, and all the other persons, of
whom according to that learned gentleman there are so many, who have
been, convicted and punished on perjury, fº up amongst them an
Exhibition of their effigies in waxwork. It would beat Tussaul's
Chamber of Horrors. -
In the meanwhile, gentlemen, charge your glasses. Let us drink,

POLAND AND ITALY: A STATE PAPER.
(To LoRD CowLEY.)
You R Lordship will have read, in the public journals, a copy of a
petition said to have been presented to his Majesty the EMPEROR OF
The FRENCH by certain subjects of his Imperial Majesty, praying him
to vindicate the nationality of Poland by the force of arms.
PRINCE GoRTschakoff, your Lordship is aware, has addressed to
BARON BRUNNow a despatch which contains a peremptory rejection of
the proposals made to the Russian Cabinet by Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, in concert with that of France, with a view to the pacific solution
of the Polish question.
The refusal of Russia to treat with the Allied Powers on any practical
basis of agreement may be thought to entitle popular demands which,
but for it, might be regarded as the premature expression of a generous
enthusiasm, to some attention. -
In this conjuncture, the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN THE THIRD, apart
from the definite contemplation of any change in the nature of that
policy which his Majesty's Government, in accordance with that of the
QUEEN, has hitherto pursued with regard to the Polish difficulty
might iike to know what extent of co-operation, in giving unlimited
effect to the sympathies of France for Poland, he might expect from |h
this country.
With a view to the anticipation of any such wish that may exist in
the mind of his Imperial Majesty, I may inform you that the formation
of any decision as to concurrence in that ulterior course which his
Majesty may deem requisite for the liberation of Poland is, for the
present, altogether precluded by an insurmountable obstacle.
That obstacle is the presence of the French Army in Rome.

THE Lancet says that the Medical Profession has an inge-
nious device for increasing its income. It seems that the
Doctor accepts a commission from the Undertaker for
recommending the latter to the notice of afflicted survivors :
“A well-known practitioner but a few weeks previously received
for one funeral “one piece of business' he had recommended no less
a commission than £50 ! “You see, Sir," said our informant, “it was
a first case. The maximum commission is usually 20 per cent. ; but
in this instance, anxious to secure the interest of the gentleman, who
is rapidly rising in practice, and the job being a good one, 25 per cent.
was given.’”
The information is suggestive, and as it comes from
such good authority it cannot be disputed. Now, it is
calculated to make us rather uncomfortable, and we will
tell you why... If our Doctor can get £50 for suggesting an
Undertaker, it is offering our Doctor a yery strong tempta-
tion to make an Undertaker necessary; for £50 is a precious
deal more than our Doctor's, bill is likely to come to.
Argal, we take this opportunity of informing all Doctors
and Ündertakers, that, hating the latter, as Ghouls, and
also *...* black ſarce which they enact, we have
left in our Will express orders for the very cheapest
funeral that can be performed, in the event of our wanting
one at all. We earnestly recommend the same course to
all readers, and then there will be more money for their
ſamilies, the Undertakers will gnash their teeth, and the
Doctors will not get much commission. Much obliged to
the Lancet, and we are sure that the Profession will be equally
obliged ; for whereas its good and high-minded men may be
counted by thousands, the low beasts who would accept
an undertaker's mouldy hire are comparatively few. Still,
there are such, and they should be hunted. ..

hard-working men, we do not like the lady's offering such legs to parsons.
We should like to know something of the character of the legs, or
rather of their former owner, because they might have a tendency to
take the wearer into places where parsons are not expected—Dissenters’
chapels, let us say—and hence trouble might ensue. . But we dare say,
after all, the lady is a kindly body, and means to do a good-natured
thing, so she must not be angry with us for laughing at her legs—she
knows we are always laughing at our own, beautiful as they be.
LETTING GO THE REINS.
MR. JUDGE RAINEs is the Judge of the Hull Bankruptcy Court,
and this is the only thing we ever heard against him, or for him, or
about him, until the other day. On that date there came before him a
bankrupt bookseller named EMPson. This individual had four years
ago published an early novel hy Miss BRADDoN, authoress of Aurora
Floyd, and of Eleanor's Wictory, and of other remarkable books. The
earlier book did not succeed, M.R. EMPson alleging thatlondon publishers
always try to crush works brought out in the provinces. He does not
say how much he gave Miss BRADDON for the book, but states that the
expense of “getting it out” was above £200. When printing, adver-
tising, and puffing are charged, there would not be much left for an
author out of £200. To the non-success of this book, four years ago,
MR. EMPsoN “partly attributes his ſailure,” which, as his debts are but
£260, seems a jump backwards at a conclusion, Miss Brannon has
since taken the town by storm, and holds it. MR. JUDGE RAINEs is
good enough to say—
“If Miss BBADDoN had made £8,000 out of her works, she could surely afford
to assist the man who published her first work, and who had become bankrupt
through doing so. M.R. EMPson said he had not the slightest expectations from
Miss BRADDoN.”
This is certainly a remarkable dictum from MR. JUDGE RAINEs. It
is possible that any person with £8000 may be able to afford to do an
act of Quixotic generosity, but it is by no means so clear that he is
obliged to do it, still less clear that a provincial Judge should cast a sort
of taunt at him for not doing it. M.R. EMPson took up Miss BRADDON
as a speculation. Had he made a hit with her early book, it would
have been a very remarkable thing if she had received a shilling over the
stipulated price, and why, when she has gone elsewhere, and succeeded,
she is to be mulcted, we don’t see. We never heard of judge RAINEs,
and he may have won every case in which he was ever engaged before
he became a Judge. But if he did not win all his cases, and any client
thinks that he was aggrieved by MR. RAINEs’s want of skill or elo-
quence, that client had better write to the Judge, as now that he is
in a high place, “he can surely afford to assist any man who speculated
on his talents, and lost thereby.” We make no doubt that JUDGE
RAINFs will be too delighted (if he have been accurately reported in
the Leeds Mercury) to make such client a handsome present, to which
such client will be exactly as much entitled as MR. FMPson is to apply
to Miss BRADDON.

TEMPERANCE ORGIES IN HAMPSHIRE. “
A PARAGRAPH amongst the Winchester news in the Hampshire Inde-
pendent informs us that the Winchester Temperance and Band of Hope
Society celebrated their eighth annual festival on Tuesday last week,
by an excursion to Portchester Castle. The celebration of a festival by
an excursion is hardly intelligible, unless the excursion is supposed to
be a pilgrimage. A pilgrimage from Winchester to Portchester might,
to a superficial etymologist, appear somewhat unsuitable for a Society
based on the principle of moderation in the use of wine and port.
Such an one will say that it would have been more appropriately per-
formed by the Winchester Clergy of the last generation, when parsons.
were accustomed to drink wine, and port was regarded as a sort of
wine, and not as contradistinguished from wine, like most port of the
present day. -
Our Southampton contemporary reports that :—
“It being a delightful morning, the members and their friends mustered in great
force at an early hour, and aided by their efficient band, paraded the principal
streets of the city, with various emblematic banners, flags, &c., followed by an
immense number of people.”
Apparently, from the above account, the Band of Hope is one that
plays. The air “Hope Told a Flattering Tale’’ may be presumed to be
one of its customary performances. That is to say, unless the Band of
Hope is, as represented in an illustrated periodical which bears its
name, composed of children. But still, there is no assigning bounds to
juvenile precocity, or limiting the capabilities of toy-drums, tin-whistles,
and penny-trumpets.
That the Winchester Temperance Society, as well as its associated
Band of Hope, consists of infants, may be presumed from the fact, as
above stated, that they paraded the principal streets of that city, carrying
emblematic banners, flags, and other such things, and followed by the
multitude. Of course no sane and sober adult would join in so childish
a demonstration as that with which they diverted the Winchester mob.
ancy a man marching about and bearing a standard upreared to inform
the public that he is accustomed not to drink wine, beer, and grog, or
to partake of those liquors in small quantities only. What emblems
ought to decorate the emblematic banners under which men capable of
that man’s impertinence would strut with becoming absurdity? Con-
spicuous amongst such devices, the sense of fitness would surely
suggest the exhibition of the Pump, the Ass, and the Goose.
However, we are further told, that when our demonstrative professors
of sobriety got to Portchester; after some trouble at the station:—
“On arriving at the Castle each one seemed to have forgotten their grievances,
and entered with spirit into the various sports provided for them, such as boating,
swimming, rifle-shooting, archery, &c., for which valuable prizes were given."
Now certainly rifle-shooting is not a sport fit for children, unless as
practised at Cremorne, and the Races, with a cartridge consisting of a
peppercorn-shot and a copper-cap. There is a maxim which prohibits a
certain class of adults from being trusted with edge-tools, and a fortiori
it denies them fire-arms. Yet the Winchester Band of Hope and their
companions rejoicing at Portchester, are represented as having entered
into their sports “with spirit.” It would have been better, perhaps, if
they had finished them with beer; but alcohol, even in the smallest
quantity, is unfit for youth, and only the grown-up members of a Tem-
perance Society can be conceived commencing their sports and pastimes
with a “nip; ” but those of Winchester, another time, if they must do
such a thing, had better take sherry and bitters.
We are happy, however, to learn that “at four o’clock all partook of
tea,” though we are not without suspicions that it contained “some-
thing short,” for we find them described as “returning to Winchester
about eight,” and are apprised that, when they got there, they “marched
in procession to the British Hall,” ſrom which repeated act of extra-
vagance it might be surmised that the effects of the tea had not gone
off. But then, we remember that they exposed themselves aſter break-
fast even more outrageously than they did after tea; and we consider
that, if they were really babies, tea, particularly in case there was too
much green in it, may have been quite strong enough to have got into
the little fellows’ heads.
In the mean time we wish to point out the wonderful similarity
which there is between a modern temperance demonstration and a
frantic Bacchanal procession of classic antiquity.
The Home of The Fairies.

SKETCH FROM A STUDY WINDOW.
EveRYBODY is talking about M. Gounod's Faust, and for 9nce the subject of general talk is not
unworthy to be discussed by rational persons. But Mr. Punch does not §: à. any critic has
yet pointed out the great moral service which the authors and composer have done to the Anti-Street-
Music Cause. This º: must arise from the vulgar, aristocratic habit of coming in late. Mr.
Punch, is always in his stall, with his gloves, buttoned and his glass out, three seconds before MR. Costa
raises his stick., Hence Mr. Punch knows all about the opera. Q , ,
The moral, placed vividly and in action before the public, is that street music is a wicked thing, and
drives a sensitive person to madness. Faust is in his chamber, meditating, when a burst of music from the
street breaks in upon him. He instantly sells himself to −, well, to M. FAURE, and is led into crime.
Mr. Punch has a stronger mind than Dr. Faustus, and is not in danger of conducting himself with
mortals.
appeals from maddened correspon-
Moise LLETITIENs. But there are
moments in his life when he is
conscious that he is in a greater
rage than is good for him. One of
these moments is when he is occu-
pied in polishing an inspiration into
an epigram, and an Italian fiend
under the window strikes up “I
wish I were with Diarie,” or some
such memorial of the filthy Ethi-
opians. If M. FAURE came into
the room in his red-hot drapery at
that instant, Mr. Punch would
probably request him to disappear
with the other fiend, and then come
back for a cigar. But, really it is
only a martyr-soul (as MR. CAR-
LYLE says) like Mr. Punch that can
joke over such horrors. He, like
the party mentioned by Tom
MooRE. could write nine charmin
odes while on the rack. But suc

dents, begging him to do something
towards abating the nuisance. One
tells of a sick wife who had to
endure half an hour's torture
because a brown beast would not
go away, and the policeman was, of
course, down some area and could
not be found. Another says that
a child, just recovering from brain
fever, was deprived of sleep by a
similar miscreant. Men who choose
to read or work at home, and not
in the sacred but costly silence of
chambers, say they lose hours by
the interruptions of the organ
wretches, and Mr. Punch will cer-
tainly not be surprised to hear
that some tormented worker has
taken the advice of the Times,
and delivered himself, with his own
arm, from the scoundrel grinder.
Do not let him hit too hard, how:

and that may be done with dis-
cretion.
The pleas that are made for the
nuisance are, of course, of the most
ridiculous kind. One person says
that though the master of a house
does not like the noise, his children
and servants do. Therefore, the

at Cree-morn. No decent wife
would willingly allow her husband
to be annoyed by the music, any
more than he would allow it to

organs are to be permitted for the
amusement of the dwellers in alleys
(and if . like the §:

54 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 8, 1863.
The Law says that the street is a highway for passengers which no
one may obstruct. ...Then let the police be"empowered to keep the
Organists moving. They will, soon get tired of that, SIR. Richard
MAYNE is hereby charged with the execution of this Decree.
VELUTI IN SPECULUM.
“Oh wadsome power the giftie gie us,
To see ourselves as others see us.”
Says the Poet. Well, this boon has been conferred upon us by our
lively neighbours. . If John BULL wishes, to see, his jolly countenance
as it appears to others not far off, he has but to look into the mirror of
a French newspaper. He had better not, however, if he wants to keep
his countenance, for he will find that a hard matter. .
A French paper, the Patrie, says:—
“England is a country where the clergy and nobility enjoy privileges so mon-
strous as to be scarcely credited.”
| As Punch knows everything, he knows of course how this information
was obtained by our contemporary.
the Patrie lately commissioned a profound observer and clever, photo-
grapher of social manners—M. INSOLENT, as special correspondent, to
inquire into and report upon the-
“Exorbitant privileges, monstrous abuses, and superannuated institutions of
England.”
The result is before us in the report itself, a monument of intelligent
industry and historical correctness; but its length prevents' us doing
more than giving the chief heads of it, or rather a few of them as a
specimen. - -
The first part, as it treats of a matter interesting only to lawyers, we
will pass over; merely saying, that it refers to the droit du Seigneur,
which M. INsoleNT found universally in force. This privilege, was
formerly enjoyed exclusively by the LORD MAYOR as head of the
aristocracy, but it was afterwards extended and confirmed to the whole
of the nobility by the Act of 25th of Orver Crosſwº. cap. 32. .
Everything in England, is rated at a money value..One distinguished
nobleman is making an enormous fortune by exhibiting himself nightly
to a curious public—we are speaking of Mons. le Wicomte de Dundreary,
Pair d’Angleterre. -
In the next section, M. INSOLENT adverts with lively but just indig-
nation to the unfair advantages enjoyed by Members of the Upper
House in the rifle contests at Wimpledom. The special correspondent
did not himself witness these contests, taking place as they do in a
distant and savage part of the Surrey Mountains, but he was assured
by a friend who had resided several weeks in Leicester Square, that in
the match between the Milords and the Commons, while the former
claimed the right to take aim in the usual manner, the latter were com-
pelled to fire with their eyes blindfolded, and with their backs to the
target—a position extremely inconvenient and embarrassing. It was
by this means that the Milords were able to snatch a triumph over
their antagonists in 1862, and they would perhaps have again succeeded
said, of that powerful Medium, M. MILNER GIBSON.
The Members of the House of Commons were rendered clairvoyant,
and saw the target with !he backs of their head, ! * *
+ + * -
but we feel that we cannot go on—it is too 'painful—too humiliating.
We deeply regret that these and other painful facts should have been
made known to our neighbours... We are afraid that we must appear,
§ a nation of freemen like the French, much like the knife-grinder to
e patriot:—
“Wretch whom no sense of wrongs can rouse to vengeance."
But we are used to our wrongs, and have learned to bear our burden
-our spirits are broken by long continued tyranny. “Spiritless Out-
casts” as we are.
We even feel so mean as to be pleased to hear that the Patrie has
got a first warning for publishing that part of the report that relates to
the privileges of the clergy. An exalted personage will not allow even
an heretical Church to be spoken of disrespectfully. ,
“All in the Downs.”
A CoRRESPONDENT signing himself “Waverer,” unable to obtain
any satisfactory reply from Notes and Queries, writes to ask us this
nautical question,-What style of sailors are Epsom “Salts 2° Let
. Waverer” look out for the answer in our next number, or the one

THE TRUTH seen THROUGH A Pont-Hole.—When a ship goes

NOTES TAKEN AT THE WORCESTER MEETING OF THE
ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.
As the season for Agricultural Meetings and Cattle Shows is
approaching, we, trust that the few following hints, induced by a visit
to the show of the Royal Agricultural Society at Worcester, may not
be without their use to our non-farming readers.
On i. up to a beast (always say beast or animal, they are quite
agricultural terms, and obviate any difficulty you may have in deter.
mining the sex) punch it in the ribs, at the same time remarking in an
oracular voice, “well covered,” or, “laid on well.” . Feelin a knowing
way about the root of the animal's tail, and while doing so, glance along
its back, and if that back presents a broad flat surface, fook round at
the bystanders and exclaim in notes of admiration, “level as a table.”
Now plunge your hand under its flank with a pulling motion towards
you. It is not necessary to accompany this action with any observa.
†ions as it speaks for itself and for your bucolic knowledge. Moreover,
farmers are a silent race, so the less you say the better.
It will be as well for you to confine your remarks to prize animals,
and if you wish to vary your plan of operation, you can put your hands
in...your breeches' pockets, and, standing a fittie way off the animal,
with your legs widish apart, make, as occasion may demand, the follow-
ing observations. “There's a quarter for you!” “Magnificent hand!”
(we are unable to define clearly the meaning of this latter term, having
been, until lately, under the impression that men and monkeys were the
only animals possessed of hands. We believe, however, that it refers
to some part of the foreleg, and we can assure the novice that, judging
from its frequent repetition in reference to prize beasts, it is on the
whole, a very safe remark to make.)
“How much a quarter now?”. This question need not be addressed
to any one in particular, nor need the speaker have himself the faintest
notion of the animal's weight; for, if unanswered, it looks knowing,
and he has not committed himself, while should an ently competent
authority reply, as is very probable, “getting on for nineteen score, I
judge,” he has only to say “that er is, I warrant,” to keep up his repu-
lation. (N.B. It is as well to observe here, that the monosyllable “er”
is a pronoun of common gender in continual use in districts, more
especially in the West of England, and that the word “warrant” is pro-
nounced “warn” in the agricultural world.)
With, respect to sheep (which must on alloccasions be called “ship”),
the mode. dure is simple. It consists merely in laying hold of
the wool in the middle of the back and endeavouring to give the animal
a good shake. We advise the novice not to attempt to master the
science, if we may so term it, of sheep nomenclature; for to confound
tºgether hogs, tups, and theaves, would at once betray the superficial
character of his knowledge.
Armed with the above hints, and a stout stick, which will be found
very useful in imparting momentary animation to a more than usually
obese pig, and furnished with a few epithets and short sentences, such
as, prime, kind, rare; falls off in the lines; fine in the bone, &c., the
unprofessional visitor to a cattle show may avoid the exhibition of
gross ignorance, and even stand his ground with the regular farmer.
THE QUEEN'S LETTER
Touching the Aston Park Tragedy.
Now, Ladies of England, and specially you, Ladies of Fashion. Do
you see what your QUEEN says?
HER MAJESTY describes "Exhibitions attended with danger to the
performers” as gratifying only to “Demoralised Persons.”
We presume that the matter is now settled, and that ladies will never
again patronise such exhibitions.
Any woman who may do so after HER MAJESTY's notification will of
course be refused admission to Court, or should she slink in, her pre-
sentation will be “cancelled.” No Demoralised Person must approach
the QUEEN or the PRINCEss of WALEs,
. Mr. Punch heartily, and respectfully thanks his Sovereign for this
intervention between fools and victims.
The wretched Lodge of Foresters who “ continued their festivities”
after the murder, will of course be dis-affiliated by the rest of the body.
F-ri—
Perfecting a Title.
. CERTAIN books, should decidedly have certain publishers. For
instance, we see a little work with the taking title of “Sea Fish—how
to catch them,” published in connection with the name of our estimable
publishers, MEssRs. BRADBURY & Evans. This is wrong, and we
condemn it as being sadly wanting in point. In our opinion, the pub-
lisher whose name ought to have announced such a plain question as
“Sea Fish—how to catch them * should have been Hook AM.

; fineladies, who
can recruit their languid limbs by lolling on a sofa all the evening after
it; but instead of doing this, the dramatic ladies had to hurry back to
town, and do their usual professional work without a momen’s rest.
Whatever be their faults, actors certainly are generous in helping one
another, and deserve to be assisted in their charitable schemes. Those
* who think they are pious when they’re only bilious,” and may
shrink from giving them, support, should be reminded that there
really is a shadow of disloyalty in condemning what is patronised
and sanctioned by the Queen. That her name, stands at the head
of the patrons of the College, is a proof that she º of that
Dramatic Institution; and the knowledge of this fact should tempt all
loyal subjects to send in their names at once to swell the Royal list of
helpers in the charity, which, as needless letter-writing is a nuisance
º hot weather, they can do by their mere signatures at the bottom of
a cineque.
“If it had not been for wishing to say a word in favour of this de-
serving charity, I should have shrunk, just now from writing about
anything dramatic. One can’t well take much interest in theatrical
affairs, when one’s heart is in the Highlands, where one wishes that
one’s legs were. With Saint Grouse Day close at hand, who that cares
for shooting can care to write or, read or talk or think about the
theatres? But, alas! eheu! oime! here am I in town, and all that I
can do is to bewail my cruel lot, and cry,
“O cursed fate that keeps me from ‘the Moor?'"
Clearly there are other Misérables in the world than, those whom M.
Hugo has pictured in his book. But thinking of one's troubles is not
the way to lighten them, and so my compliments to the grouse, and as
I cannot have the pleasure of seeing them this season, I’ll see what
there may be worth seeing here in town. -
“Since I wrote my last, a new star has been visible in the dramatic
firmament, and by some has been regarded as quite a shining light.
The very name of STELLA seemed to indicate a Star, and possibly her
plauditors were biassed by this fact... I cannot say I thought her a very
brilliant body, nor can I think it probable that she will add much lustre|b
to SHAKspeaRE or his stage. Of course I speak in all humility, while
thus dissenting from the orthodox ‘opinions of the press.” With only
one, exception, so far as I have seen, the critics have been clamorous
in their commendation, and seemed determined to agree that since the
memorable night of the débùt of Miss O'NEIL, no one like MA’AMselle
CoLAs had so taken the town by storm. Thus prepared, 1 went to see
a graceful girlish Juliet, with a slightly foreign accent and a multitude
of charms of voice as well as face. I had rather not exactly describe
what I did see; but though I don’t quite think “a bathe with an
electrical eel” would be a preferable torture to seeing such a Juliet, I
cannot say that when I witnessed her performance I felt inclined to join
much in the plaudits of the house. A FechTER in petticoats would
not be to mythinking an unpleasant sort of personage, though I must
own I have a preference for hearing SHAkspeaRE's English spoken by
an English-speaking tongue. But MA’AM.selle Colas cannot act as a
female FechTER would do, and her Frenchy airs and graces are entirely
unsuited to the Juliet of the text. As she has not studied English
more than a few weeks, it would not be fair to criticise her shortcomings
of speech; but to me she has a gasping throaty way of utterance which
actresses'
Like most of us,
is even more unpleasant than her false accentuation, and which she should
be strongly counselled to amend. As English ladies seem now disap-
pearing from our stage, we must hold ourselves prepared to see French
actresses appearing, on it, and we must take care not to sneer at them
merely for their birth. So, ſauté de mieur, I’ll gladly welcome a French
Juliet, when I find her act the character as a female Fechter would.
But...I cannot say that MAAMselle Colas has done this, mor, in spite
of all the praises and predictions of the press, can I fancy it is likely
that she ever will.
“The Haymarket is closed, and so is the St. James's, and next week
the Lyceum will have followed their example, after running the Duke's
Motto, for 174 nights. The Ticket of Leave Man still cºntinues to

of the drama, as showing that a play well written and well acted is
appreciated even in these, undramatic days, when scenes of mere
sensation, are more praised than scenes of sense. The ever, urbane
manager MR, EMDEN takes his benefitnext Saturday. At the Bandbox

NOT RIGHT TO A T.
During the past week the authorities at the Zoological Gardens have
een mystified by the daily appearance of large numbers of visitors of a
strange kind. They are of both sexes, the men are chiefly in ill-made
black, and the women in sad colours, but dowdies. They tender greasy
shillings, some of which are rejected by the money-takers. They make
their way to the Ponds, which they examine, seem enlightened and dis-
gusted, and go away casting evil giances at the elegant aristocracy of
the Regent’s Park. The thing has been a mystery until yesterday,
when it was explained by a stout party who was too angry and hot to
conceal his discomfiture. It seems that the paragraph in the Times,
stating that “the celebrated Sturgeon may be daily seen swimming in the
º: near the antelopes,” had been copied into the hºalworth Chronicle,
ut the name of the fish had been misspelt with a P for a T. Printers
should be careful.

THE QUEEN
º
TO THE LADIES OF ENGLAND.
“LADIEs, “. Windsor Castle, Aug. 1.
“THE QUEEN has commanded me to express the pain with
which HER MAJESTY reads the account of daily accidents arising from
the wearing of the indelicate, expensive, dangerous, and hideous article
called Crinoline.
HER MAJESTY cannot refrain from making known to you her
extreme displeasure that educated women should by example encourage
the wearing a dress which can be pleasing only to demoralised taste.
“For the miserable idiots who abjectly copy the habits of those con-
ventionally termed their betters, it is impossible to entertain anything
but pity.
“But to the Ladies of England this appeal to abandon the present
degrading, dangerous, and disgusting fashion, is made in the belief that
they will show themselves the rational and decorous persons whom they
are supposed to be.
“I have the honour to be,
“Ladies,
“Your most obedient humble servant,
&c. C. B. PHIPPs.”
THE REVOLUTION IN POLAND.
THE attention of MR. Pop E HENNEssy, and other gentlemen who
sympathise with, insurgent Poles, but not with oppressed Romans, is
i. to the following extract from REUTER’s Express, dated Breslau,
yzo:—
“A decree of the Revolutionary Tribunal at Warsaw was published on the 21st
instant, sentencing to death ColoneL LEUCHTE, the notorious inquisitor of the
citadel in the reign of the Emperor Nicholas, who had recently resumed his func-
tions on the inquisitorial committee. On the evening of the publication of this
decree, CoLoRELLEUchTE was stabbed by an unknown hand.”
Apologists of the Papal Government and enemies of the Italian
Kingdom have been vehemently protesting that the Polish insurrection
is quite a distinct, thing from that more general Continental rising
against constituted authority, which they call the Revolution. There
exists, however, the same º: resemblance between those two
movements as that which is discernible between two peas, a big and a
little one. Revolutions are not made with rose-water indeed, but
neither are they made without effusion of a fluid in colour nearly
similar to infusion of roses. If Revolution, has shed the blood of
Count Rossi and others at Rome, has it not also assassinated Colonel
LEUCHTE, and a few more victims at Warsaw Doubtless, CoLoREL
LEUCHTE ought to have been hanged, if there had been a law to hang
him, and power to enforce it. How far the shortcoming of legal hemp
may be justifiably supplied by the irregular knife, who shall say? but
surely if we are to call a spade a spade, we must also call a dagger a
dagger. But perhaps we shall be told that an excommunicated agger
is one weapon, and that a poniard consecrated by a benediction is
another. Nevertheless, we conceive they come to the same thing in
the end; that is, when their points respectively penetrate the heart of
an adversary. ... In short, assassination, right or wrong, is assassination,
whether practised by Roman patriots or patriotic Roman Catholic
Poles, and Revolution in Poland is identical with Revolution else-
where, with the Revolution, in fact; which Revolution is not merely
an anti-christian confederacy arrayed against the Powers that be;
§: also, whatever the papalini British or foreign may say, considerably
atholic.
In the meantime it is to be hoped that the fate of ColoneL LEuchTE
will be a warning to GENERAL MoURAVIEFF.

A PICTURE was the other day presented to the Commissioners of the
Bankruptcy Court., The principal figure in the foreground is an old

THE COMPANIES IN THEIR CUPS.
By a Party who has evidently not recovered the use of his Poetic Poor
Feet.
ToN'T you wish you’d been at the Mansion House on Wednesday, when
the Lord Mayor, MR. Rose, feasted the City Companies,
And the old Wardens and old Masters came eager for the dinner and
rººms the gout that might get into their poor old lumpy
nees
| But it was not merely Masters and Wardens, no, the LoRD MAYor
didn't invite them on’y,
But LoRD HARRIs of Trinidad in the West Indies, CoLoREL Sykes
of the East ditto, SIR CHARLEs RICH of Shirley House, and the
Excellent SIR Cusack RoNEY. - - -
Likewise members of the Committee of Her Majesty's Commissioners
of Lieutenancy; at their head MR. OBBARD,
A gentleman of most distinguished manners, though there’s no other
rhyme to his name but slobbered.
And didn't they all enjoy themselves, eating MR. Rose's turtle, venison,
sweetbreads, sweetmeats, pines, and peaches,
And when their precious healths were drunk returning thanks in no
end of facetious speeches. -
How they all tried to make jokes on the name of their Conservative,
Liberal, and hospitable host,
And a worse and worse pun succeeded its predecessor as the last man
got up to answer the toast. . . .
MR. LovE, for the Great Late Eastern Railway said that Love's place
was among the Roses;
MR Uspenwoon, for the Fishmongers, said that fishes had Roes;
whereat MR. Rowe and his elegant family turned up their noses.
MR. PEARCE, for the Haberdashers, said that those dashers always sold
pins in Rows.
MR. DollonD, for the Spectacle-makers, said there could be no greater
Spectacles than Lord Mayor's Shows.
|MR. BugGIN, for the Bellows-makers, said that Bellowses like Roses,
were made to blow: - - -
MR. BAILY, for the Ironmongers, put in his Ore, but how he Rows 1
don’t know.
MR. FowleR, for the Wax-chandlers, complimented the MAYor's
natural kindness, but said artificial Roses were made ºf wax.
MR. WHITTAKER, or witty cur, for the Lorimers, said he had heard
that mares often had Saddles on their backs.
MR. GIBBONs, for the Salters, made some incomprehensible references
to the salt sea and the Member for Southampton.
MR. GRAY, for the Goldsmiths, said the MAYofi, was a man of as
sterling metal as he or St. Dunstan either had ever stamped on.
MR. GRACE, for the Grocers, said Tea-Roses were a very delightful
species of floricultural production.
MR. WALKER, for the Fruiterers, drank MASTER Rose and his père,
which showed that MR. WALKER has had French instruction.
MR. Jones, for the Coopers, said that he really Rose quite cock-a-
Hoop,
But nobody told him that the front of his shirt had got a splash of the
very best turtle soup.
And if they had it wouldn't have been true: MR. Jones will consider
himself sold, -
And I don’t think any more witticisms were uttered that are worth
being told,
And then came the hour at which the aristocratic guests began to
morris,
And away went ALDERMAN GIBBONs, SIR CHARLEs BBIGHT, and
..MR. J. T. NoFRIs,
And if you’d been there I make no doubt you’d have drank a great
deal of the excellent wine of MR. Rose’s,
But you couldn’t have made such excellent verses as these afterwards,
I swear they’re almost as good as my poor friend the Poet
CLose’s.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ELL, Saturday, why
not Saturday, July
25th, if there was
business to be at-
tended toº. Both
Houses did, their
duty by holding a
morning sitting,
which was over in
time to enable
honourable Lords
and noble Members
to go down to the
l]ramatic , College
Fête, and admire
the actresses. The
Lords agreed to all
sorts of amendments
proposed by the
Commons, and the
Commons were
eluall{ amiable,
though a little more
talkative. The Great
Bill of the Session,
- that upon which
= there have been
more debates and
divisions than on
any other, need Mr.
== Punch name the
Irish Fish Bill, was
: re-edited by the
= Commons, and four
times did they divide
thereupon. Parlia-
ment must really be
known in future as
the Angler's Re-
treat. MR. BUTT
spoke on the sub-
ject, thereby affording occasion for a sporting jocularity about giving the
salmon the butt, MR. BAGWELL was wise * bag-nets, and even SIR
Robert PEEL came out as a salmon-peeſ. The Bill is law, so the
parties concerned, that is to say the fish, had better order copies and
see what it is all about, for St. Punch has no intention of turning St.
Anthony, and preaching to a scaly congregation. We presume that
the measure is understood where The Trout and the Salmon They play
at backgammon, In the pleasant waters of Castle Hyde. MR.M.'MAhon
chivalrously 'stood up for the Common-law rights of the Rod-fishers,
who it seems are now to be ruled with a rod of iron, and LORD FERMoy
humanely endeavoured to mitigate the tremendous severity with which
poachers are to be punished, but the Commons were in a Preservative
mood, and voted all the harshness. Heavy fines are to be inflicted, and
boats are to be seized. The Salmon is the king of Fish, and he is going
in hard for Prerogative, but King Salmon and King, Prussia will come
to grief in the end. This was the Antepenultimate day of the Session.
Monday. The Penultimate day of the Session. The last set debate.
In the Lords the GREATELTCHI signified his opinion that the riotous
conduct of the Greeks was a reason for not handing over to them the
Ionian Isles. EARL Russell, thought he had a neat answer. He said
that when our GeoRGE THE FIRST ascended the throne there were dis;
turbances here. His º was so pleased with this brilliant historical
illustration, that he declined to re-open the Ionian question. LoRD
DeRBY was unconvinced, and condemned a gratuitous, cession of the
protectorate, and called it an unfortunate and an imprudent step. ..
The evening papers of the following day, that of the prorogation,
announced that the coronet of loRD NoFMANBy had been, something
suddenly, transmitted... We have frequently censured an unwise
politician, and would add a word of regret for an amiable gentleman.
The Commons had miscellaneous talk. STANspelp explained
some improvements which are to be made at the Greenwich nautical
school, but they can be accepted only as a small instalment of the
reforms needed at the Hospital.., Queen VICTORIA will retain the sole
power of making Ionian and English Knights of the order of St.
Michael and St. George, and, this is a great comfort. MR. M9N:
st LL., “advisedly" charged M.R., NewDEGATE, and his Exeter Hall
friends with having “hounded”, the late MR. TURNBULL to his grave
and SIRG. Bowyer confirmed the statement that MR. TuRNBULL had
qied, brokenhearted through unjust imputations on his honour. The
death is to be deplored and, the persecution to be condemned, which
said, we may add that the phenomenon of a sensible man's losing, we
*. not say his life, but a night's rest, by reason of an Exeter Hall
ray,
º A quadruped's bray might keep one awake. MR. Cowper:
will not open a road through the Park from Bayswater to Kensington,
because foot-passengers might choose to stay in the Park all night.
Qne likes to hear a good reason for things. A law was then hurried
through, Parliament for doing something awful to people who say they
have got Exhibition. Medals when they haven’t. Imagine anybody
boasting of such a thing!, Que would prefer being, like CastleREAGH,
at Congress, "...decorated by the absence of decorations.” SIR. G.
Bowyer was, dilating upon the ''. of Benchers, when a Count
Qut showed that only twenty-six Members were enjoying the recital of
legal wickedness.
Tuesday. This was the Ultimate day of the Session. In the Commons
MR. EwART mentioned that he should, next year, bring in a Permissive
Bill in favour of the Metric System. That will not do. Give the
British Blockhead three years, seven, or ten, if you like, to learn what
as LORD MACAULAY said, is so singular as to be worthy
the British Schoolboy would learn in three months, but make the
#. Qiao, at a definite date. Nobody learns lessons if he can
elp it.
Pontefract wants a new Member. The accomplished, independent,
kindly MR. MoncKToN MILNEs goes up to the Lords as BARos
Houghton, and Mr. Punch expresses his entire satisfaction with the
arrangement, and inaugurates the coronet of Lord Houghton by
...ºf
own Palms is all the sound we heard in acknowledgment of this
remarkable epigram.
MR. CºwPER said that he intended to remove the Rails from all the
º Statues, thinking that railing enough was supplied by public
criticism.
An Irish Convict, who pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting
murder, is stated to have since declared that he was innocent, but that the
governor of the gaol kept him without food until he agreed to confess
when a good dinner was given him, and future provision was promised
him. R. O'HAGAN did not answer the statement in a way exactly
calculated to induce a conviction that he believed the story, and Mr.
Punch is free to confess that he himself is not one of those persons, Sir,
who are inclined to repose implicit faith in an unverified allegation of
an improbable character.
R. MAJESTY. had occasion to allude to the Black Rod, She
would probably not do so in the celebrated line from the Hunchback:—
“I call him Clifford, and he calls me Madam."
But without waiting to discuss this question, we may remark, that the
QUEEN, through LoRD WesTBURY, here called SIR AUGUSTUs, and
bade him summon the Commons to the bar of the Lords. They went,
the gallant veteran PALMeRSTON leading the way.
“ºt ºutrit &Hills it.” having been said over a heap of new laws,
(in fact the Royal Commissioners were received with a salute of 101
Bills) the LoRD CHANCELLOR WestBURY delivered himself to the
following effect:—
Ire licet.
I “trust” that Russia will carry out the stipulations of the Treaty
of Vienna as to Poland. [But not a word about making her do it,
LORD ELLENBOROUGH.]
Federals and Confederates are still unfortunately at war, to the
detriment of neutrals, but I have seen no reason to depart from neu-
trality. [No, MR. BRIGHT; no, MR. Roebuck; no, Mr. Elected of
the Millions.]
I am taking steps to unite the Ionian Islands to Greece, whose nice.
new King will shortly take steps thitherward. I am in communication
with the parties to the treaty of 1815, and shall ask the Ionians what
they have to say. [Nothing about your views, your Majesty ABDUL
Aziz )
Ilave demanded reparation from Japan, and I hope not to be obliged
to use force. . [Daimios at a distance will please to accept this inti-
mation.] º
Brazil is angry with me because I did not comply with demands
which I did not deem it possible to accede to. [What do you mean by
possible, LoRD John P. Is not this writing like a possum, who is decidedly
up a Brazilian gum-tree?] But I should be glad to see relations
re-established. [John must write to MoREIRA and say so.]
Thanks to the Commons for supplies, for Fortifications money ſhal
PAM, ha! CoBDEN] and for the provision for young MR. AND MRs.
WALEs. [Long may they enjoy it, and in Marlborough House.]
Things are rather better in the manufacturing districts. - I recognise
private generosity, and have gladly assented to the relief measures.
[And, happily, a glorious harvest is coming.]
SIR CANNIBAL. TATToo is bumptious, but a mixture of conciliation

ilt
and cuffing will, it is hoped, smooth him down. [Mr. Punch insists on
these New Zealanders being treated properly. Some of them are
almost as handsome as himself.]
A Bill has been passed for improving small benefices. [We looked
to see whether LoRD WesTBURY would smile as he read this, but his
face preserved its calm. Perhaps the Member who talked about
Simony, in a Simple-Simony way, was not in the House.]
The Statutes have been revised. [Yes, your MAJESTY, and the learned
and industrious gentlemen who have done it have been very badly paid
for invaluable work.]
The Volunteers have been placed upon a well-defined footing. [Who
wrote this slip-slop? He had better send his English to drill.]
An Act for carrying into effect the American anti-slave trade treaty has
passed, and I hope that the honourable co-operation of the Government
of the “United” States [this means the North] will materially assist
me in putting an end to the Perpetration of that Most Disgraceful
Crime. [Words worthy the Queen of Freemen, your Majesty.]
Our General Prosperity is unimpaired, our financial resources have
been fully maintained, and our general commerce with the world at
large has not been materially impaired. [The information is more
gratifying than the tautology.]
India, recovering from disasters, enters upon a course which holds
out good promise for growing prosperity. [A course holds out a
promise. On the end of a fork, or how? WooD, WooD, CHARLEY WooD !]
On returning to your several Counties you will have important parts
to perform. [We see that amateur theatricals are announced as in
preparation at several aristocratic houses.]
The keeper of the QUEEN’s conscience added the usual devotional
valediction, and mentioned the 14th of October as the day on which
his audience would again hear that they were not wanted.

How, WHEN, AND WHERE P
oB, THE MODERN TourisTs GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
NE thousand questions are
being daily put to us at this
season of the year, as to
“whem to go, how to §. it,
where to go to, and what to
wear where you go; and we,
drawing largely upon our
own travelling experience,
are now about satisfactorily
to answer. The third point
is the one to which we must
first give our serious atten-
tion, and therefore let it he
! our cheerful task, before
| entering into the details of
expense and so forth, to sug-
st a few pleasant routes
É. the consideration of the
still dubitating tourist.
Home circuits will not of
course come under our pre-
sent notice.
Let us suppose then that
you want to be away for
ever such a long time: very
good; then we will com-
mence by reducing that
period to three weeks at the
outside. This, phrase “at the outside,” will fairly exhaust the first
part of our subject; while “ at the inside” will relate merely to the
pocket, and we shall soon exhaust that.
Now then, Ladies and Gentlemen, for our
GRAND PATENT THREE WEEKS TOUR ON THE
CONTINENT
CONDUCTED ON THE MOST ECONOMICAL PRINCIPLES.
Let us begin at the beginning; alphabetical order of places by all
means. Let us say you want to go to Antwerp P. By the way you
mustn't say you don’t, or else we’re done, and won't play any more.
Very good; then you do want to go to Antwerp. Now here is a nice
little three weeks jaunt for you:
|
Copenhagen.
Dresden (calling at China.)
Ems.
Florence.
Göttingen and back again, viá Leipsic, Hong Kong (if time),
Madeira, Paris and the §. of Fair Zurich's Waters Tullaliety,
and so home. ,
This will suffice for the first journey. You can start from anywhere
you like, say Brunswick Square by Moonlight.
While we feel inclined, permit us to make three observations:—
First. The Tourist’s Best Pocket Companion is, MONEY.
. Bank clerks and others (specially “others”), should not
leave England without their employer's permission, lest they be caught
tºº. - - - - -
irdly, Don't be extravagant; but if you’re going very far, it doesn't
do to be “a little near.”
If in the course of these directions any abbreviations are used, let it
be understood, once for all, that r means rail, and that s doesn’t;
that'o means nothing, p means something, and so on.
First, catch your Passport. This must be signed by all the Crowned
Heads of Europe. On being asked your name, reply “N. or M. as the
case may be.”
Having procured this necessary document, packing up before packing
off is the order of the day. So now we must consider–
. What to take º The simple answer to this regular puzzle is, “Take
time;.” don't flurry yourself or “take-on” if you find matters going
unsatisfactorily, and take off your coat and waistcoat if filling a port- |
manteau be warm work; and finally end by taking Jº off
altogether. . If you take this idea, you’ll commence excellently well:
Another important question is, “What quantity of Luggage shall I
require?” We are prepared for this or any other emergency:—
Necessary Luggage. One portmanteau, full; another empty, in case
you lose the first. A hat-box, with hat inside. A bag containing
“Things.” A large sandwich-box to hold muffins, strawberries,
and slices of roast beef, which, you can't get abroad. A packet of
collars, silk neckties, and an Alpine stock, much worn among the
mountaineers. Don't bother yourself about taking soap; if you were
to spend much money in this article you’d soon be cleaned out. Care-
fully provide yourself with blankets, table napkins, sheets, candlesticks,
snuffers, and panes of glass, in case any of the windows in your bed-
room at the hotel are broken. A knife, fork, and spoon are indis-
pensable. A barrel organ will amuse you on the road, but we scarcely
recommend your carrying it, unless there’s a donkey to take it about,
which, by the way, there probably would be.
Glasses, &c. You can always obtain plenty of glasses on the journey
at the various refreshment rooms; some people can, however, see better
without them. Carry a telescope about the size of LoRD Ross's ; or
hire it for your tour. If you can get on fast with a walking-stick,
take two, and then you’ll get on faster. , Umbrellas, belonging chiefly
to other people, you will be able to pick up on the road. Perhaps,
however, it is better to carry one, as when hungry you will always have
a spread ready. -
o far, so good. The next point is money. Procure this from a
banker before four o'clock. The best time, however, is when he's not
looking. If this is impracticable, ask him to sing a Round, and then
catch some of his circular notes. - -
So much for the present; there remains quite as much for the future.
We ourselves have not travelled for nothing; and, by the way, on
referring to that admirable publication, “Our Banker's Book,” we
devoutly wish that we had. -
---
The Value of 'Subscription.
A Young MAN who had served several months behind the counter of
MEssRs. SILKINs & CRAPER, unexpectedly succeeding to property,
resigned his situation at the establishment of those gentlemen, and
went to Oxford, where he graduated. On taking his degree, being
required to testify his orthodoxy by the customary subscription, he
#. complied, and having signed the Thirty-nine Articles, with a
ourish, asked, in the most obliging manner, “And what is the next
Article?”
HORTICULTURAL.
EveRY one knows that flowers possess a language of their own, and
a literature, too, in their leaves. One species can also enjoy a joke and
laugh heartily at it. London, a gardener informs us, is very fruitful in
Laughing Stocks.
A WETERAN.—Colonel, WAUGH, at his late examination in, the
Bankruptcy Court, insisted much on the position that he was an “old
soldier.” Nobody doubted it. |

Now then, make haste, make haste, and ãº visit to Ludgate Hill,
and behold, for nearly the last time you will have the opportunity, the
vast, and celebrated Cathedral of St. Paul, erected by that famous
architect SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN, in the reigns of their Majesties the
last of the Stuarts. Be in time, be in time. In a very short time this
remarkable edifice will become invisible, owing to the great improve-
ments which the march of intellect, and the progress of commerce,
º force upon this Great Metropolis...Therefore, be in time
efore the view is shut out for ever and ever by the highly ornamented
tank in preparation by the Railway Company. The architecture will
well repay inspection, the façade, henceforth to be seen no more, is
regarded as one of the finest things in the world, and the majestic
appearance of the west front defies at once competition and description.
There is no charge, so long as you keep out of the building, and in
short this is an opportunity which can never occur again in the history
of London, Be in time, be in time.
SERVANTGALISM.
The following letter from “Miss DRAKE” is a rich specimen of the
fine-ladyism of the kitchen, and is printed verbatim et literatin:-
“SIR, 20 July, 1863.

Correspondent, “a touching sight, to see MR. CHARLEs KEAN cor-

lulling the dolphins to sleep with recitations from Hamlet and other
plays. It is needless to add, that the º fall asleep almost as
soon as it commences. The affability of the truly great actor is
remarkable: he speaks to every one on board, including the Man at the
Wheel, who, in his turn, does not reply.
. Great alterations are to be made in our Railway Carriages. There
is to be a bell attached to each seat, and if you want anything, you can

nothing more will be needed for the present.
Several works will shortly be issued from the Great Hydraulic Press;

The Master and Fellows of Trinity Čollege, Cambridge, have at
length decided the greatly vexed question, as to whether HomeR did or

MR. CHARLEs KEAN, now sailing on the seas in the Champion thereof,

to read the ChurchService during the voyage, but has stipulated that
he shall not be called upon to baptise, marry, or bury.” We see no
harm in an actor's reading §. but one would like to know how
the responses are managed. Clearly MR; KEAN cannot be clerk as well
as parson; for we have often, and with delight, heard him remark,
“I could dot say Abed.”
and proceed, with exquisite emphasis,
“But wherefore could I dot prodounce Abed?
I had bost need of blessing, and Abed
Stuck in my throat.”
We shall be curious to hear further particulars touching the Rev. MR.
KEAN, who has thus taken Theatrical Orders.

Her skirts she sought in vain to press

Of steel-ribbed Crinoline !

A loud and joyous noise;

And laughed—those horrid boys'

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 63
AMUSEMENT AT WINCHESTER.
--- . Is - veh-we ARIED of
- - - crowded streets,
maddened by or-
gan grinders, ob-
structed by pla:
card-bearers and
tired, of crammed
omnibuses lin
with puffs of cheap
tea and shirts,
catch-penny inven-
tions, and penny
apers, I seceded
rom London to
spend the dog-days
without the fear of
hydrophobia. .
“To rejoice in a
fewhours of special
quietude, I betook
myself one day to
the ancient City
of Winchester, in
whose venerable
back of the altar;
screen, inscribed
by the veracious
monks of old, you
will find these
lines:–
“Corpora sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta,
Ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa."
“Sir, I wish the relics of the saints at Winchester would cure rheu-
matism, and replace some of those teeth the loss of which is so injurious
to digestion and articulation. However, this I will say, that there is,
around the place where those remains are said to be buried in peace, a
sphere, or atmosphere of repose which is very soothing to the nervous
system. It extends around the Cathedral to some distance, and espe-
cially along Kingsgate Street; a thoroughfare in which the passengers
may be described as mostly invisible. You meet hardly anybody, but
seem to feel that those whom you cannot see are passing you. . So to
speak, few but ghosts walk in Kingsgate Street. The houses look as
if their present occupants had departed this life. Under these circum-
stances, anybody but a gross materialist is naturally or supernaturally,
and humbug apart, disposed to inquire ‘Are there any spirits present.” "
But the other day, when I found myself under their influence, the added
condition of a high material temperature compelled me rather to ask
* Is there any beer?' A prompt answer to this invocation occasioned
an immediate adjournment to the Crown, a hostelry which is one of
those few in which the landlord now-a-days keeps good old ale. Erperto
crede; and, if ever you pass through Kingsgate Street, Winchester,
and the echoes of your heels raise spirits that depress your own, to
refresh your soul try M.R. WATTs's tap. But, Sir, I went into his
cºffee-room, and there I not only enjoyed his ale, but also an advertise-
ment, (so different from the fondon puffs which I detest,) the idea
whereof may have been, if not inspired by the genius loci, carefully
adapted to it. This was an illustrated prospectus of the ‘Accidental
Death Insurance Company.’ It included an Almanack, surrounded by
a series of oval borders corresponding to the twelve months of the year,
and each containing an illustration of a fatal accident suitable to the
month. For January was represented a skater slipping through the
ice. For February, a shipwreck. For March, a cannon, during artillery-
practice, bursting and killing a volunteer. For April, a collision be-
tween two steamers at sea. For May, a railway collision. For June,
a boat containing a lady, and attendant gents, upset. For July a gig
with a gent in it capsized by lightning. For August, a man gored by a
bull. For September, a man thrown from his horse, and º On
his head. For Öctober, a Volunteer withdrawn from a Review, and
swooning under surgical assistance against a tree; supposed to have
been shot with a ramrod. For November, a woman run over in a fog.
For December, a house on fire; female with child appearing at a window
in the flames; fireman below, too late.
“Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now,”
as I heard a young lady sing, to my edification, the other evening, in a
party, at a most unseasonable hour.
“Now, Sir, this illustrated prospectus of the Accidental Death Insur-
ance Company amused me more than any caricatures I have seen for
some time, except yours. The notion of enticing a man to insure his
life b{º} embellishments of the various casualties º which he
| may killed, is genuine commercial humour. Think how highly

purpose. Every Paterfamilias should insure, his life from loss by
accident in these railway times. I should, if I had any relations that I
care about: . As it is I shall buy an annuity, instead of insuring my life
at all; and I am, tº “SMELFungus.”
“The Owl in the Ivy, August, 1863.”
TRUTH ON TOMBSTONES.
MR, Monsell accused MR. New DeGATE of having hounded the late
MR. TuRNBULL to death by insisting that, as a violent religious par-
tisan, he was not to be trusted as Calendarer in the State Paper Office.
Sir George Bowyer backed MR. MonsELL’s accusation by asserting
that MR. TuRNBULL. had died of a broken heart, as in fact he did, if
rupture of the heart is the same thing with bronchitis, and if heretics
can excite inflammation in the breast of a zealous Catholic by declaring
their want of confidence in him under circumstances in which the
interests of his Church are concerned. Can SIR GEORGE Bowy ER
demonstrate that this is soº. In that, case he has made a discovery in
nosology for which the College of Physicians ought to send him an
honorary diploma.
. M.R. NewpegATE, however, in a letter to MR. Mºº repels the
imputation of laving, like an East wind or a fog, affected poor MR.
URNBULL with fatal pulmonary disease. Incidentally in this document,
he makes, with reference to a certain Oratorian burying-ground at
Sydenham, a statement which, if accurate, raises an interesting question.
He says, referring to a speech in the House of Commons:—
“The facts I stated referred to the late MR. WILLIAM Hutchinson, who was
buried on the 16th of this month at Sydenham, except the misdescription of the
deceased upon his tombstone, which applied to the late MR. FREDERick Fortescue
WELLs, who is described on his tombstone as ALBANUs WELLs."
If, then, MR. NewDEGATE, has been rightly informed, a man who
was named Faedekick Fontesgue is on his tombstone called ALBANUs,
How was his name registered? As ALBANus too? If so, we should
like to know what the law says about such a registration, and if it says
nothing, what security it has provided against false entries on the
register.
Of course, if JAMEs BUGG may call himself NoFFolk HowARD, a
gentleman whose godſathers and godmothers gave him the names of
FREDERIck Fort Escue is, or should be, at liberty to renounce them
for ALBANUs, or WITUs, or any other which his taste may prefer to
them. But then the change should be duly advertised and recorded.
To preclude mistake a reminiscence of the old names might be preserved
by an alias. A misnomer on a tombstone may create a flaw in a pedi-
gree. , Heirs may be wronged by an epitaph whose “Hic Jacet” may
be ambiguously translated “Here lies.”
But perhaps we shall be reminded that the defunct who rest in the
cemetery of the Oratorians at Sydenham cannot leave any posterity, and
that if they could, unless in the case of a very tightly entailed estate,
good care has been taken that no question touching the inheritance of
their property shall ever arise to trouble any of their descendants.
PHILANTHROPY AT THE SEASIDE.
THE Royal National Lifeboat Institution met on Thursday last week
at its house in John Street, Adelphi, MR. Thomas CHAPMAN, F.R.S.,
Vice-President, in the Chair. Etymology suggests that the Adelphi is
a ſitting site for the offices of an institution which is based on the
principle of human brotherhood. It has been the means of saving in
#: course of the past year no less than 339 lives from the maw of
the sea.
Out of the number above stated, the º 123—a remarkable suc-
cession—represent the persons saved by the Society off their own bats,
that is to say, with their own boats, of which º count 125; in pro-
|. to the rescued, nearly a boat a man. To keep up these boats,
however, they require subscriptions to be kept up by subscribers, of
whom it may be said, “the more the merrier.” What fun, then, it will
be for all our opulent readers to contribute to the funds of the Lifeboat
Institution, which surely deserves the support of all who are able to
keep their own heads above water.

ORATORY-ANCIENT AND MODERN.
IT is singular how words change their signification.
Oratory in ancient times implied a remarkable display of
intellectual power. To convince and persuade, not children
but men, was its proper function. Now it labours an
often with success to convince a sickly girl that it is for
her spiritual welfare to part with all her property for a
Weil, and achieves a signal triumph when, it has per-
i. a stupid boy to run away from, and dishonour, his
ather.
Oratory, by a recent perversion, is a fine word suggestive
of a low thing-kidnapping. Sweet names, however, cannot
make that, which is vile respectable, any more than an
unsound ship can be rendered sea-worthy by a fresh coat
of paint. Suppose an area-sneak [were to repudiate his
appellation of Thief and style himself a Kleptomaniac P
Would it be competent for him when so ennobled to carry
things with a high hand—to attach spoons and other uncon-
sidered trifles at his own discretion? We opine not. Why
then should the recognised professor, of kidnapping be
allowed to walk at large with a smirk beneath his Roman
nose and a leer on, either side of it? ...In common justice
those who pick and choose their juvenile victims should be
required for two or three months to pick a given quantity
of oakum, and º: who will not pursue a straight-forward
course should be compelled to take reformatory steps in
the county House of Correction.
A Case of Real Charity.
In the Daily Telegraph we learn from its Paris Corre-
spondent that—
“The first detachment of Mexican prisoners has arrived at Evreux
from Brest. On their entrance into the city the Mexican visitors
seemed rather doubtful as to what would be their reception, but
they were soon convinced of the hospitality and good feeling of the
French. They were taken to the Golden Stag, where Punch was
offered to them, “at which,’ to use the words of Le Courrier de
L'Eure, they showed themselves deeply touched.”
Deeply touched! Yes, we should think so....We know
when we have been imprisoned in a dull place like Evreux
º: has cheered us half so much as getting hold of
tººth.
THE SYBARITE CLUB.
MR. PUNCH announces that a number of gentlemen who have dis-
covered that there are a great many disagreeable things in this not
altogether disagreeable world, have ſormed themselves into an asso-
ciation which will probably take the above title. The SYBARITE CLUB
is in course of formation, but, as its details require a good deal of
attention, and as it is against the nature of the members to bore them-
selves more than they can help, it will probably not open until about
Christmas, when it will be constituted in time to save them from the
active boredom of that so-called festive, period.
The Principle of the Club is the AvoidANCE OF ANYTHING THAT Is
DisagreeABLE.
Its Members must all be persons in easy circumstances, not that the
Club sets any inordinate value on money (which is useful only as the
means of preventing one's being bothered) but because if poor men
come in, they may at some time or other ask for assistance, which it
would be a bore to grant or deny.
Every luxury which civilisation has made a necessary will be sup-
plied to the Members, but they will not have the trouble of directing or
governing in any, way. A highly paid staff of officials will be held
responsible ſor all arrangements under a Manager who likes trouble.
He will be the Medium between the Members and their servants, and
he will be invested with absolute power. To avoid the possibility of
discomfort, the first complaint, just or unjust, will involve the instant
dismissal of the alleged culprit.
The existing Newspapers will not be taken in. They contain much
that one wants to read, but it is so mixed with other matters as to
make a journal a bore. A Sybarite Newspaper, which will probably be
called The Halcyon, will therefore be edited for the Club. It will
contain everything that is interesting, or sensational, inasmuch as one's
own happiness is promoted by contrast with the discomforts of others.
But all sentimentality, all appeals to one's patriotism, charity, morality
indignation, and the like will be excluded, and the aim of the editor will
be to extract amusement from any subject upon which he may comment.
No advertisements will be .. to appear in the journal, except such
as may offer additions to the comfort or enjoyment of the Members.
No person with a Purpose, or a Mission, or a Conviction of any
kind (if he permits it to be known) will be eligible. The Club has no
vulgar objection to the clergy, but as they are, or º to be, some-
what a restraint upon conversation, it has been thought best to exclude
them. The Army and Navy may come in, but not Volunteers, until
they have learned to abstain from any demonstrative interest in their
work. No Author, Actor, Member of Parliament, Betting Man, or
other person who must talk shop, will be admitted under any circum-
stances. As a rule the Having Done Anything that People Talk About
will be a ground of exclusion, as persons who have performed that ſeat
are usually a nuisance. .
Letters will not be received at the Club. Most letters are bores.
But the Secretary will take, directions from any Member who may
wish a departure from the rule in his own case, as sometimes it is a
bore not to get a particular letter, and a greater bore, if it goes to one's
private residence. - -
The Site of the Club has received, much consideration, and the
Manager is in treaty for a noble house standing in its own grounds, in
the centre of London. It is charmingly isolated, and, the approaches
are, fortunately, through, streets of a high class, so that the sight of
overty, squalor, dirty industry, or anything else that is unpleasant, will
e avoided. Porters, who have been Detectives, will effectually prevent
visits from unwelcome persons of any kind. To complete the comfort
of the Members, the Secretary, if furnished with a list of Poor Relations,
or other people whose communications are a bore, will arrange for the
private payment of any stipends to such persons, or will communicate
with the police upon the subject.
It is thought that by a comprehensive and well-considered effort to
avoid seeing, hearing, reading, or doing anything that is disagreeable,
the Club, may secure to itself as much freedom from Boredom as is
compatible with mundane existence, and this is as near an approach to
happiness as can reasonably be expected. . .
Gentlemen desirous of joining the Club can send their names and
qualifications to the Secretary, under cover to Mr. Punch.
. CLASSICAL-It is a fact not mentioned in LEMPRIkBE, that in ancient
times “ploughing the occan’” produced Ce-crops.

orthy of the gravest con-
sideration to the tourist is
the subject of Dress. The
choice of costume, specially
as regards the adoption of
old clothes, must depend a
reat deal upon previous
abits. Provide yourself,
however with–
A Reversible Coat, black
one side and white the
other, with tails to hook
on in case you want to go
to an evening party.
Reversible Boots, so that
you may be able to retrace
your steps with ease... Let

Travelling is dull work,
sociably speaking, or, we
should say, not sociably
speaking. Take our advice,
and break through any
bashfulness and awkward
reserve in opening a con-
versation with a chance
- - companion.
Before we step into the train, a carriage, must be selected. Choose
one, where the only available seat is filled with the boxes, rugs,
sticks, &c., belonging to the occupants. Insist upon these being im-
mediately removed. When this operation has been performed, and
every one is more or less.nncomfortable, say you’ve changed your
mind, and shan’t come in. Walk a little way from the door, then return
to request them to keep the seat for you... Wait until three minutes
before the train starts, when lose no time in showing your fishing rod,
desks with unpleasantly sharp corners, telescopes, sticks, umbrellas, and
curiously impracticable hat boxes, under the seats. You must be very
careful in looking after your luggage; therefore, at frequent intervals
during the journey rummage about among the passengers' legs with
your stick, in order to ascertain the safety of the various articles.

BLANK PROSPECTS.
ANYBody who has any money to throw away should put himself into
communication with “A Barrister,” who, in a letter to the Post, under
the title of Foreign Lotteries, thus writes:—
“I have received by post a printed circular, but without the name of anyº:
which informs me of a "Grand Money Distribution of the Loan of the Grand Duchy
of Baden,” and of the ‘245th Hamburgh State Distribution." The drawing of the
prizes is to take place at Carlsruhe on the 31st of August instant, and at Hamburgh
on the 24th September next. Orders for shares will be strictly executed, provided
they are accompanied with the necessary remittances to MR. —, General Merchant,
Guernsey, or to MR. -, Proprietor of the official Guernsey Gazette. The names I
have purposely left in blank.”
Of course, “A Barrister” will be happy to give the names of the
parties in question, to any gentleman labouring under a plethora of the
purse, and desirous of lightening his pocket. An eminent operator in
ophthalmic surgery remarks: “The Grand Money Distribution of the
Loan of the Grand Duchy of Baden is, like an opacity on the cornea,
a bad spec.; but if you call that a partial and morbid view, of the
thing, then f may venture to describe it as all my eye.” In the City
it is generally remarked, that the Hamburgh speculation is as bad as the
Baden, if it is not a worse’un, and that the Baden as well as the Ham:
burgh is all humbug. There is much significance in “A Barrister's"
observation that he has left the names of the gentlemen who are open
to receive remittances for the Hamburgh and Baden lottery-shares, in
blank. ſº who may think it prudent to send them, any money
may safely calculate that the number of any lottery ticket which he may
get in return will correspond exactly to their names as above stated.
Election Intelligence.
MAJOR WATERHouse has been returned for LoRp. Houghton's
“abandoned cave” Pontefract (we use “abandoned” in its poetical
sense) and SIR. E. HEAD has not. WATERhouse, however, owes his
election not to his Conservatism but to the hot weather. With the glass

THE BROMPTON BLOWFLIES.
OUR Fathers of the Oratory at
Brompton appear to be en-
dowed with eloquence. They
persuaded young MR. HAR-
RIsoN, aged 18 years 6 months,
to turn i. Catholic in 8
hours. According to the ac-
count of MR HARRIson's
father in the Times. HARRI-
son Junion was taken by a
friend to see the Oratory:
never having spoken to a
Popish Priest before. He was
introduced to BROTHER Bow-
DEN at about 1 A.M., and bap-
tised by that ecclesiastic at
9 P.M. This, says MR. HAR-
Rison, SENior, was “done
with the knowledge and con-
sent of MR. FABER, the Father
Superior, for the express pur-
pose of preventing any inter-
position of my parental au-
thority.” MR. FABER appears
to be a Father Superior in-
deed; a Father who esteems
his authority over a young
gentleman immensely superior
to that of that young gentle-
man's Papa.
Who is this FABERP MR.
NEwdEGATE lately took occa-
sion to state that the Bromp-
ton Oratorians were in the
habit of burying their dead
under other names than those
which were given by their spon-
sors. That statement doubt-
less evinced f'. bigotry,
intolerance, and bad taste on
the part of MR. NEwdEGATE.
It was very offensive to gen-
teel. sympathies., Neverthe-
less it appears to be quite true.
We may venture to observe
that the name of FABER is one
very appropriate to the Chief
of an Institution in which such
fabrications occur. Its range
of meaning, too, is so coin-
prehensive, that we will not
inquire if it is a mere Latin-
º-º-º-º: - isin for SMITH.
J ºfflº Zº -- MASTER HARRIsoN had
- - - been Captain of Westminster
- - School. He was in the way
of getting elected, in a 'few weeks, to a studentship of Christchurch, Oxford. He is now
a postulant in the Oratory. His disappointed father is an expostulant out of it. He will
expostulate with Fabeh and Co., about as effectually as MoRTARA expostulated with the
Pope. They will only laugh, at ilim; while SIR George Bowyer and MR. Monsell will
tº: seriously that he has cast obloquy on “the gentlemen of the Oratory”
y ºiling the personal grievance which he has sustained from the proselytism of those
gentry.
..What lengths would not such fellows as these Brompton Oratorians go to make converts?
Simply the length of their tether in all directions. The expediency of keeping that tether
short is manifest. However, long it is they will keep it tight. It is well, however, that
a generous toleration allows them a sufficiency of rope.
Brompton is a place whose name, is rising. There are Brompton Boilers, and, if the
Oratory were, paramount, there would soon, no doubt, be Brompton Burners. The con-
yersion of a lad under 19, between the hours of land 9, is tolerably hot work. The Oratorians
turned him in, 8 hºurs. It was a short time to taint him in. They couldn't have done it
sooner if they had been so many Bluebottles. Let them be called the Brompton Blowflies.

New Rendering of an Old Quotation.
MANY.of our Public Conveyances are ſull of draughts, owing to broken panes of glass
and bad-fitting windows. SIR. Richard MAYNE it was, we believe, who said that this fact
cºuld no be denied, but that it was no good making a row about it, because De gusly 'bus non

ICED APARTMENTS WANTED.
“To MR. PUNCH, SIR,
“I AM an alderman, and therefore I of
course love a good dinner. oreover, when I
get one, I like to make the most of it, and to eat
as much as ever Nature will permit me. Now
to a man in my position it’s easy to get good
dinners, but it isn’t quite so easy to get appetites
to match; for somehow at my age one's relish
soon wears out, and even turtle ain't so temptin
after the third plateful. I believe I’ve tried f
sorts of appetising fillips, and not a dinner-pill
comes out but I’m the first to test its efficacy.
But I know of no plan yet for making one feel
hungry, after seven courses, and the man who
should by any means succeedin doing that would
most deservedly be called a benefactor to his
species.
... “Well, Sir, Iread the other day that at a charm-
ing dinner given at St. James's Hall, where
conger soup was served and other novel delica-
cies, the temperature of the room was raised to a
great heat, so that the guests while being treated
to a tropical repast, might enjoy it all the more
by feeling as though really they were dining in
the tropics. This arrangement doubtless caused
a great amount of thirst (and this is, after dinner,
no uncomfortable thing), but I should fancy that
the appetite was terribly impaired by it; and I
would suggest for future banquets of this sort
that the room should be well iced, instead of
being heated. . . We all know that one gets
hungrier in cold weather than hot, and were the
temperature of dining-rooms brought down to
freezing point, I have no doubt we should have a
wintry relish for our dinners. Indeed, why not
take a hint from what one hears of Arctic life,
and, by lowering the temperature to somewhere
below zero, endeavour to produce a really Arctic
appetite. Eight pounds of solid meat is there
an ordinary ration; and if, as we are told, an
Esquimaux will eat ten pounds of salmon at a
meal, what would an alderman not eat, were he
equally refrigerated? A dozen plates of fish, and
then a peck or so of whitebait, would merely
serve to whet his appetite for more substantial
viands; and after swallowing a duck or two, and
some few score of other entrées, he might devour
a whole roast turkey and half a launch of Venison.
“Trusting my suggestion will be acted on ere
long, and that, when I dine at Greenwich next,
the room will be well iced for me,

THE SCULLS OF THE SEA-URCHINS,
From a Sporting but Serious Contributor.
“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“I was always partial to athletic, sports, and if I do not
mingle in them now so much as I used to do, it is because I like to
leave the course ſree to younger men. As this is the close of the season,
and as any kind of sensational contribution must be acceptable, I beg
briefly to describe an intensely interesting contest in which I took part
on Wednesday last, and of which I may say pars magna ſui, because
Latin shows the gentleman.
“The match in which I took part was a sculling match by members
of a distinguished rowing club which takes its name from the Sea-
Urchin, and whose flag is a gay horse-cloth. I am one of the Sea-
Urchins. At four o'clock, more or less, we went on board the Don Juan,
river steamer, specially chartered, and except that there was nothing
to eat or drink, the arrangements of the commissariat were unexcep-
tionable. Nothing could exceed the eagerness of the public at the
piers to get on board the private boat, except the intense ferocity of the
pier-men, who pulled back the public with a savageness amounting
to sublimity. I do not know the name of the Captain, nor is it
material to the present narrative, but the man at the wheel had red
hair, and seemed pensive. This may have been the result of a deter-
mination of periwinkles to the head, for he was consuming those fishes
during a large part of the voyage. No accident occurred, except that
embarking in a hurry. I forgot my cigar-case, but this want was
supplied in the most obliging manner by a gentleman to whom I tender
my respectful thanks for the very worst weed I ever smoked in my life.'
“In the centre of the steam-vessel were exposed two silver vessels,
thus illustrating the proverb ‘wheels within wheels.” One was a vase,
the other a cup, both were elegant, and I should have liked one for
my eldest boy whose birthday, by a curious coincidence, will be on
the 12th of October next, and the other for my youngest boy, whose
natal day will actually fall on the 20th of this present August, but my
suggestion to that effect, made to the persons in charge of the vºssels,
was not so favourably received as to induce me to repeat it... I then
generously recommended one of them to be given as a testimonial
to our Captain for safely navigating the boat to Putney, and for his
affable, manly, and sailorly behaviour, but I was requested, with some
little acerbity, to shut up.
“Quarriving at Putney, at the pier opposite the Gar and Starter,
myself and another Sea-Urchin of similar tastes held council, and
deciding that, in the event of any dispute, arising as to the result of the
match about to come off, it would be highly desirable that two of the
parly should be in that calm frame of mind requisite in an umpire, we
selected a small, but pleasant private room overlooking the river, and
ensconsed ourselves therein. Both of us being men of high moral
principle, and aware that it is wrong to waste any portion of the time
which can never be regained, we ordered dinner, recommending similar
economy of time to the menial who was to prepare the food. -
“There were, I believe, three heats, but the other Sea-Urchin and
myselſ, anxious not to be prejudiced by partisanship, did not pay any
attention to them, beyond noticing that in the first heat four exceed;
ingly dirty little boys lying in four º dirty big barges, held
the tails of the outriggers. We heard the thundering voice of the
starter, and saw the sculls flash, but I cannot inform you of the order
in which the competitors passed the Gar and Starter for two reasons,
first because the Don Juan was between us and them, and secondly
because at the moment the waiter entered with some fine flounders
fried and in souché. Both were excellent, and the way the sun gianced
upon the shifting weathercock, of the BISHOP or LoNDON's church
opposite, suggested thoughts of the mutability of human affairs, and
the advantage of having an established religion in the country. From
such thoughts the other Sea-Urchin and myself turned to a bottle of
more than tolerable Champagne, but it had not been long enough upon
the ice. . It is well not to be deſeated even in trifles, we therefore
ordered in some lumps of Wenham lake ice, which nearly supplied the
defective refrigeration. -- -
“Soon afterwards the Don Juan returned, and a Sea Urchin, who has
the command of the Deaf and Dumb alphabet, telegraphed to us that a
gentleman whose initial is that of both Deaf and Dumb, but who is
neither, had won the first heat. But as his most formidable competitor
had the same initial, we obtained no very precise information, and the
entry of some admirable cutlets of course precluded further inquiry.
While we discussed these, and some other things, the second heat took
place, and was won by a Sea-Urchin who bears the name of a very
distinguished English novelist, who has depicted humble and aristo-
cratic life in touching fictions, and who has been dead about a century.
“Myself and my companion then felt that the time had come for an
active effort, and ''. we were ever to make ourselves worthy of being
called in as umpires in the event of a dispute, that was the moment for
so doing. We, therefore, ordered some further liquid reſreshment, and
were full, but good, and they occupied us until the third return of the
Don Juan with the news that victory, of the most triumphant kind, had
ſallen to the winner of the first heat, who may be described in exactly
the same terms as I have used in reference to the winner of the second
heat, except that happily the last eight, words must be omitted. It gave
me pleasure to think that I had contributed to the success of a gentle-
man in whom all well regulated minds must take an interest, but I
make, of course, no merit of my duty as a Sea-Urchin.
“No dispute arising, partly I presume from the circumstance of the
winning boat having been a great many lengths a-head, the services
which 1 and my friend had been prepared to offer were not required.
We felt, therefore, that we had needlessly sacrificed pleasure to duty,
and deprived ourselves of six voyages under a broiling sun, but we
would not set the younger Sea-Urchins a bad example by repining, and
therefore, concealing our mortification, and congratulating the victors,
one of whom bore away the Vase and the other the Cup, we once more
embarked on board the Don Juan, and smoked the celebrated and six-
pence until landing at Hungerford.
“Space forbids me to dwell upon the extreme importance of athletic
sports, and rowing in particular. It demands temperance, activity, and
strength, makes a call upon the animal energies, but leaves a card also
upon the morals. It is a matter of pride and pleasure to me to assist
in such sports, as I did on Wednesday, and I only wish that the water-
tournament of the Sea-Urchins had had an abler chronicler than
“My dear Punch, yours truly,
“Wandsworth, Aug. 11th.” “EPICURUS Rotu NDUs.”
FEDERAL GAROTTING.
No, no, English gentlemen of the Federal persuasion, emphatically
No. M.R., LINcolN may, in the interest of liberty, put the American
press in chains, but we do not stand that sort of thing here. The
clergy and ministers of the Southern States have just as much right to
be heard as the “dearly beloved” dittoes who address us from the
North. The former have sent over an Address, touching the matter
of which no matter, it is a theological exposition of their views. And
you, NEWMAN HALLs and Morning Stars and the rest of you, are
clamouring because this address is inserted among the advertisements
in that excellent Good Hords, in the dignified Quarterly, and elsewhere.
You want to gag the Southerns. You protest against their being even
heard in “religious” families. No, gentlemen. We hate all slavery,
and we object to enslaving anybody. Let everybody be heard. But
this evidence of cowardice and this attempt at tyranny are admirably
in keeping with the hypocrisy that makes war to emancipate the slaves
—of the opponents of LIN ColN and SEWARD's cabinet.
TUPPER FOR THE MILLION.
TUPPER for the Million the HATCHARDs advertise,
Celebrated TUPPER, the witty and the wise,
TUPPER the original, TUPPER the profound,

MORE MEN OF BUSINESS,
“Every man hath business . . . such as it is.”—Hamlet.
“I’M not a man of business, Punch, and I was afraid I never should
be. I know pretty well what learn, and I’ve a rough guess at what I
owe, and if you add the two, there’s my annual income, and about once
in three years the governor settles with people who bother, so that the
system works very well. But the dear old governor is always telling
me to be a Man of Business, which he º is ‘the only way to be pros-
perous and respected.” Do you know I think I shall try It can’t be
such difficult work. Look at the Men of Business who direct Railways.
There can’t be greater business swells than those, can there, now P
Well, at the Great Western meeting MR. ADAMs says that Company
made an agreement with the Undergroundlings to lay out £28,000 a-year
with them. But the Men of Business forgot to sign the paper, though
they began spending the tin. Then they found out that the affair
wouldn't suit them, so the respected Men of Business repudiate the
honourable agreement, and pitch over the Undergroundlings. Upon my
honour l’m quite equal to being a prosperous and respected Man of
Business in this fashion, and I shall tell the Governor so. I like this
free and easy way of going on. “LIONEL RATTLEcAsh.”

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
MANY have told of the Monks of Old all sorts of things
more or less true according to the bias of the marrator.
If they did send a few heretics to the stake, they were at
least impartial in their prosecutions; for it is an acknow-
ledged fact, that, in the Reſectory Festivities, with which
they invariably celebrated these Triumphs of Religion,
they toasted one another, and often roasted a brother on
his weak points. The above information may be gathered
from M. MontalEMBERT's Monks of the West.
In a Rare old codex may be found the information that
there are tot libri Africani, probably, full of black letter,
in the now almost inaccessible Libraries of Abyssinia. We
recommend MR. Hotten to look after these as quickly as
possible, and bring them out among his other Antiquarian
productions as the Hotten-tot libri.
The London Traffic Managers have ordered that when
the Fulham Omnibus has its compliment of passengers, it
shall be invariably known as the Quite-Fulham Omnibus.
Nobody has made any objection to this.
The other morning the celebrated MR. SMITH received
the amount of a debt from a well-known talented individual.
We are authorised to say that the name of the gentleman
who paid SMITH was not Owen.
DR. NATHAN DAVIs, F.R.G.S., the celebrated Traveller
for the Ruined Houses of Carthage, has lately returned
from somewhere or other in Africa: he has not only found
out the Source of the Nile, but has made another discovery
beside this. He has discovered that MessRs. SPEKE and
GRANT have discovered it before him.

CHAPTER II. AND LAST.
Miss NAYLoR-THE Second UNREveALED MystERY.
Miss NAYLoR-Her Birth—Absence of Specific Data—Her Theological Views–Philo-
sophical–JoAN of Arc—Omission by Historians—Her Opinion of CHARLEs THE

mation regarding the Pre-Adamite Jaw at Abbeville–Discussion regarding her
Hair—Awful Disappearance of a Lady's Maid–Curious Question as to her final
Departure—Testimony of credible Witnesses—Who was She?—Mystery—
Conclusion.
To give the date of Miss NAYLOR's birth would be, at the very com.
mencement, to set at rest ſor ever the much vexed question as to this
lady's age. If the fact of Being is any certain proof of Birth, then we
might adopt the formula, that, “Because Miss NAYLOR existed, there-
fore she was born.” Than this we can go no further; nor can any
number of mathematicians, even by the nicest of nice approximations,
arrive at anything like a guess as to the probable, we do not require
the exact, year of this mysterious lady's first appearance on the mundane
stage. Our parents and the parents of our contemporaries had seen her
in their childhood, and they testified that she had always been the
same as we had known her. Everybody agreed that she was a superior
woman. She subscribed to many libraries, mastered the daily news-
papers, read every modern book of note as it came out, and took a
warm inter st in the Theological controversies of the day, inclining to
the High Church side for the sake of elegance, at the same time pro-
ſessing Broad tenets, so as to give her natural feminine reverence a
tinge of masculine philosophy. She always spoke in terms of the
highest praise of JöAN or ARC, and from occasional hints not a few
of her more intimate friends were of opinion, that LA Pucelle and
Miss NAYLOR were at school together, and that the former picked
up some of her very original notions from her English companion.
That all historians mention JoAN and none Miss NAYLOR, in no way
militates against the above-mentioned hypothesis. She expressed her
opinion of that “poor dear Charles The FIRST,” or that “unhappy
vacillating, JAMEs,” alluding to the second monarch, of that name,
with all the confident familiarity of personal knowledge. Everyone
was agog to catch the slightest clue to the antiquity of this extraor.
dinary woman. There are those who have heard her say that she
“knew Hom(ER pretty well:” at another time, “that her acquaintance
with him was slight.” She appeared pained if the question was pressed.
Could it be that, in days of yore, Miss N. had kindled a Greek fire in
the Poet's breast 2 Her outline when we knew her, was not strictly
classical, but HomeR, like Love himself, was blind. Of her ears we
can say nothing positively, never having seen them. Perhaps these
respected organs had loved to listen to the thunder-murmurs of the
Pre-adamite swain, whose jaw was so lately ſound at Abbeville; and,
on the other hand, perhaps not. The greatest mystery about Miss
NAYLOR was her hair. Were those bandolined and daintily-plastered-
down raven locks, the giſt of nature or the marvellous work of art?
It was reported that a waiting-woman had somehow or another become
possessed of the secret. Whether this was so or not, the maid vanished;
and her strangely sudden disappearance warned all others against any
intrusion beyond the veil. Whether she ultimately departed this life,
or not, is still a controverted point; her ſriends can only s to one
certain ſact; namely, that they buried her. It is a curious thing that
though the so-called Miss Nºlon was evidently a person of great con-
sequence, and though it was clearly a matter of the deepest importance
to keep her age a secret from the world, yet there was not a single
person of high birth, no Queen, Princess, or Duchess, missing from
her place in the entire Noble lists of the four quarters of the habitable
Globe. The wife of the GREAT CHAM of TARTARY did, it is true, die
somewhere about this time; but we do not attribute much to the
coincidence. The individuality and age of Miss NAYLoR must remain,
as far as we are concerned, a profound mystery until the end of
| time.

Of course the flowers and herbs and fruit-bushes have been similarly

“Here’s rue for you,” he would remark upon discovering that herb,
and “There’s pippins,” though no cheese, and look here is “a bark
whereon the wild thyme grows.” To make the thing complete, the
Yarden walks ought to be made of stones with sermons in them, as
at the bottom of the garden there runs the Avon, in which the poet's
†..." rolling in its frenzy, possibly discovered a whole library
O 8.
Among the “curious and invaluable relics of the immortal,” which
are carefully preserved and exhibited at Stratford, the statement
which we quote calls especial attention to “a plaster representation
in 1elievo of the Battle between DAvHD and GoLIAH,” which must be
well worth journeying from Jerich9 to see. This is shown by the pro:
F. (on payment of a fee?), “together with the First Visitors'
ook, including autographs of George THE FourTH, ...", " ", and
other eminent individuals,” including Mr. Punch. A still higher treat
however, awaits the Shakspeare pilgrim at the Slakspeare Hall in Chapel
Street, where, according to the writer who has been instructing us, -
“Maybe seen an admirable full-length painting by WILsoN, of SHAkspeare in
the attitude of inspiration; and one by GAINsborough, of GARRick reclining grace-
fully upon a pedestal, idolising the poet's bust.”
The old figure of “BRITANNIA sitting on her trident’’ is recalled to
us by this of GARRick graceſully reclining on a pedestal. Had it been
a sofa, the posture .# be natural; but. to recline upon a pedestal
must be rather a hard ſeat.
Seeing relics, even SHAKSPEARE's, is somewhat tiring work; and
aſter being dragged round to the “Lions” we have mentioned, the
visitor .# doubtless be glad to sit down somewhere and get something
to drink. So the writer we have quoted calls attention very properly
to the Falcon Tavern, which he says is “mentioned by DR. DRAKE in
his Noontide Leisures, as having been kept in SHAKspeARE's time by
one, JUDAs Shaw,” and where the ale of the present is of excellent
quality. As a still stronger inducement to patronise this hostelry, it
is stated further that—
“In the smoke-room, where there is no doubt the immortal Bard has oft been
}. ſo say, ‘Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn,” is the wainscoting from New
e.
This idea of SHAKSPEARE going about his native town, and ºff
his own plays, is one that hardly tends to elevate the reverence we ſee
for the “immortal bard,” We suppose we shall hear next that he
used to chaff the º: at work in the º and say
“Alas! poor Yorick!" when they turned up an old skull. No, no; i
you please, gents, let SHAKSPEARE rest in peace, and don't disturb his
memory by putting words into his mouth, and pretending to a know-
ledge of what he said and did, or might or would or could or should
have said and done the while he lived in the small town which chanced
to be his birthplace. Make a show of Stratford as much as ever you
please; but do not vulgarise our SHAkspeaRE by your own absurd
.. nor pretend to know much more of him than does the world
at large.

74 PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 15, 1863.
STATUTES AT LARGE CALLED IN.
A Review of the Statutes at Large is about to take place in order
that such as from age or infirmity, are unfit for service, may be dis-
missed. Pending this inspection an indignation Meeting was yesterday
convened at King's Cross of those distinguished personages, whose
commission the old Statutes bore, and under whose authority they
acted. QUEEN ElizaBETH on her arrival immediately took the chair,
and spoke with her characteristic vigor. -
“By our halidom!” said ELIZABETH, who was evidently ruffled,
“things have come to a pretty pass, prying into every one of our Acts
forsooth ! MRs. CoMMONs had better look to her steps first, and make
them decent if she wishes respectable people to get into the House
without being shocked. , Why there's scarcely a seat in it that isn't
soiled, and how many of her new measures when carefully examined
will be found capable of holding water P And what a quantity of soap
is used every week in the House ! and the money, that’s wasted on
powder, that won't, wash, and notwithstanding MRs. CoMMONs is
always in a bustle, did one ever see such spoons! and then the idea of
a warming-pan being provided for a young nobleman, who is at present
at College, º who will require it when he comes of age. It’s positively
shocking. ... When we kept the British Lion,” continued ELIZABETH,
emphatically, “the House was a credit to the neighbourhood; now
what is it but a House of call for servants out of place and poor disap-
pointed Cabinet-makers ?”
JAMEs (No. 1) observed that he attended this Meeting at much
personal inconvenience, being busily engaged in preparing a secon
edition of his celebrated counterblast against the Stygian habit of
smoking. He did not know that any Act of his could | ". be ſound
fault with, “In our time,” said JAMEs, “witchcraft had a pungent
odour, and smacked of birch brooms, so that we were glad to burn it
out. It has now an aromatic scent, and is gratefully inhaled by per-
sons moving in select circles, Mediums used to cast their spells over
the cream of the dairy, now, mirabile dictu, they confine their charms to
the cream of society.”
CHARLEs (No. 2) begged to say that he did not hold himself respon-
sible for his Acts; in fact, having imbibed a little too much good Rhein
wine, he had a very confused notion, what really were his Acts during
his glorious reign. As for that little affair of Louisd’ors—Oddsfish
Kings like other men must bow to the res angusta domi. “Our lar-
. quoth CHARLEs, “was empty; to replenish it we took a French
roll.
Elizabeth. You were a light sovereign, weighed and found wanting.
Charles. Gadszooks | Nobody has any pity for our order. If we
are out of commission which of our royal cousins will lend us a crown?
. JAMEs (No.2) would answer that question. Not one !. He thought
it very desirable that a “Royal Co-operative Benefit Society” should
be established on the Birmingham principle, with special powers to
assist Members on their trials.
CHARLEs. Rules of course to be certified by TIDD PRATT.
JAMEs concurred. -
Rich ARD (No. 3), who appeared in deep mourning, complained that
his Acts had been grossly misrepresented. Mr. SHAksPEARE, of
Stratlord, his literary executor, had strained his authority to get in the
effects. No º: character had been so horribly murdered as his
had been, and he felt it KEAN-ly.
ANNE, who spoke in a sweet subdued tone, said “she had no cause
for self-reproach. She had always upheld Protestantism, moth with-
standing that she could not help occasionally smiling on the great Pope
and all his works.”
At this moment MR. OLIVER CROMWELL presented himself, and
asked if he might be admitted.
. JAMEs (No. 1) starting up, and turning pale, “Don’t let that Brewer
in : depend on it he's brewing something that will bring us all to a
bitter biºr.”
WILLIAM AND MARY (WILLIAM speaking and MARY, by her action,
confessing that those were her sentiments) thought there would be no
harm in admitting MR. CROMwell, and hearing what apology he had
to make for his Acts. If not a polished speaker it must be remembered
that he had a large spoke in the commonweal.
On a show of hands, MR. CRoxſwell's application was rejected,
whereupon he retired, taking with him his Statutes at large and his
Statue in stucco.
George (No. 3) who was cordially received, looking at his watch,
remarked, “ that it was nearly time to think about dinner. Talking of
Acts reminded him that some years ago Comedies could never be
squeezed into less than five, now i. understood that by some ingenious
process they were able to get them into three, and without being
crushed either, for they came out as lively as eels; how it was done he
defied the Lord CHAMBERLAIN himself to explain, indeed it was a
mystery as unfathomable as that wonderful trick by which an apple
can be conveyed into a dumpling, and not a crevice shall be detected
on its surface. The dumpling was a marvellous creation, and owed its
existence he had heard to a little flour by the water side. Of course,”
added GEORGE, “all present knew that BILLY PITT was answerable for
}. Acts, and he would pit BILLY against the best dog in the Westminster

Here GeoRGE was interrupted by the voice of bluff KING HAL, who
Was lºud without inquiring his way to the Matrimonial and Divorce
ourt.
CHARLEs, laughing, supposed there was another Harrying Case on.
ELIZABETH indignantly denied it, and would box any puppy's ears
who dared to speak disrespectfully of her Papa, even if it were one of
KING CHARLEs's breed—her papa was merely suing for a judicial sepa.
ration on the ground of cruelty. His seventh marriage had proved
Very, unhappy. He had recently united himself to an Irish widow of
humble extraction, and during the late sultry weather she compelled
him to sit ºp till one in the morning, and fan her drooping eyelids with
a couple of newspapers,

the shade, the Meeting, after the usual formalities, was dissolved.

him up closely to Queen's Square ; but having been taken to a neighbouring

speedily overcome by the Bishop. There cere several other moves before

there are so many people in London much better qualified
to be of service in such an accident than yourself.
5th. That you are not a medical man: or if you are, that
there are a great number of the same profession far more
experienced in these cases than yourself.
6th. That if the subject of the accident be a stranger to

of a “confounded liberty.” Never push yourself forward.
7th. If the person is insensible and cannot speak, how
do you know that he or she doesn't like the position?

9th. That it’s no business of yours. |
There are many other considerations, but these are cer-
tainly among the chief. Avoid sentimentalism.
When the weather threatens rain, walk into a club and
select an umbrella.
Never put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day,
except in the case of a hole in your coat. If you tell your
tailor that it must be done to-day, it’s very evident that
you’ll have to put it off till to-morrow.
Always have a good dinner and plenty of money.

A KAFFIR'S COMMENTARIES
ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND.
THE intelligent Kaffir by whose dialectics CoIENso was astonished
and put to flight, having triumphantly despatched a Bishop, is now
pointing his critical arrow at a Chancellor, we sincerely hope, not with
similar swift and fatal consequences. ... Our first intimation of this fact
was derived from a Letter in Zulu caligraphy addressed to “my LoRD
WESTBURY,” which by some unaccountable blunder found its way into
our courier's box. . Of course we sent it on, under cover, to its destina-
tion, but it was returned to us marked “not known as directed.” On
availing ourselves of our right of search, however, we learnt that this
disowned epistle was not intended simply for private circulation. We
have no delicacy, therefore, in extracting from it such portions as will
meet with universal assent, passing over contemptuously those unge-
nerous comments upon our jurisprudence, which BLACKSTONE in
Elysium could not peruse without becoming paler by a shade.
Extracts from Letter of intelligent Kaffir to the LoRD HIGH CHAN-
CELLOR of Great Britain.
“If I am rightly informed, your Lordship is the Keeper of the Royal
conscience. Now all Metaphysicians and Polemical writers from
DEscARTEs to PROFEssoR PUNCH have held, that man can have but
one conscience. . If then you are the responsible custodian of the Royal
conscience, what becomes of your own P. Is it deposited pro tem. with
the Clerk of the Hanapers, or is no Lawyer ever raised to the Sack of
Wool until his mens consciarecti has, by rough usage, become threadbaref
“When your Royal Master feels his conscience becoming trouble-
some, I understand he delivers to you a stupendous Seal, which you carry
with you wherever you go, and which is supposed to invest the bearer
with unlimited power and learning. This mystic Seal is also an emblem
of discretion, by which your Lordship's lips are impressed, as all inqui-
sitive people ſind, when by pumping you they endeavour to get at the
King’s secrets.
“Your laws, it appears to me, must somewhat resemble plays, as they
are comprised within a certain number of Acts. ... Many of those old
Acts are, I am assured, exceedingly mournful, while some very modern
ones can scarcely be distinguished from Farces. When I began, to
study your legislative system, I desired my erudite Tutor Counsellor
Foxey to recommend me a compendious Text-book, whereupon he
referred me to a Work in several hundred volumes entitled “Statutes
at Large. Now, why should these statutes be at large? Don't you
think it highly dangerous? From their violent .#. great
number ought certainly to be placed under some kind of restraint. For
example, there is a statute still at large, which prohibits, any
Philosopher, if so inclined, from crying “Dust” in public, when we know
that all flesh is dust, and that it is a charitable and necessary duty
occasionally to remind our superiors of it. Very often when a sour
misanthrope desires to curtail human enjoyment, he gets a statute at
large manufactured to order, beneath which he hides his maleyolence,
securely effects his nefarious purpose, and robs a poor man of his beer.
“If I mistake not, all your legislative transactions are carried on by
Bills. A vast number of Bills every year are drawn by PREMIER & Co.
on and accepted by Peers and Commons, and discounted by BULL–the
reat National Bill-discounter... Sometimes Bills are drawn by a party
or its own accommodation. . This species of kite-flying is not respect-
able. When one of PREMIER's Bills is dishonoured by not being drawn
on a good House, the Firm generally, but not always, retire from
business in disgust. Public censure is very severe upon a party who,
notoriously insolvent, refuses to shut up. - -
“So far as I can judge, your Government is quite paternal.
A medical officer named GLADSTONE, who keeps the chequers, is
constantly feeling the pulse of the people, and regularly once a quarter
sends a Cupper to bleed, them. ... If the , Patient kicks, a soothing
owder is sometimes administered, and when he is sound asleep, the
1edical Officer claps on a blister, and taxes his ingenuity to prevent its
being taken off. Persons of a full habit must find GLADSTONE’s cupping
extremely refreshing. - - - - - - -- -
“Awe-inspiring as is your Lordship's judicial presence, it is well
known that infants are frequently placed under your official protection,
and over whom you watch with maternal anxiety, locking them up. if
in danger of being kidnapped, for which purpose you, have a peculiar
key with several wards. Nor does your equitable tenderness rest here.
A host of very small parsons who find it difficult to get a comfortable
living, dine free at your Lordship's table. There is, some talk, now,
though, of your Lordship abolishing this charitable ordinary, and |

clerical digestions, I see no reason why some demand should not be
made on those who are anxious to put their legs beneath your Lord-
ship's mahogany.
“My learned friend Counsellor FoxEY informs me, and I don't think
he would impose upon my ignorance, that you have two kinds of Par-
liament—White Parliament, which is very nice and adapted to aristo-
cratic tastes, and Common Brown Fº which is sometimes
composed of very raw ingredients. Brown Parliament, free from
adulteration, is exceedingly rare, and its natural impurities are said
to be greatly aggravated by some parties using too much sugar. Par-
liament, however, in any form, seldom does much harm to the consti-
tution; when positively injurious, to neutralise its noxious properties,
it should be dissolved.
“Whatever may be thought of your nobles’ exclusiveness, all must
admire their exemplary industry. Their House, I am assured by
visitors, is a model workshop of tailoring. Enter it when you may, and
you will see young Lords cutting out, while certain venerable Barons
(to whom I can appeal ſor evidence of my assertion) are busily engaged
in mending old suits. Marquises are so fond of botany that they carry
strawberry-leaves on their heads, while a popular horticultural Duke,
who takes his title from Beds (raspberry beds most probably) is
“In reference to Court etiquette, I find that your practice and ours
exactly coincide. With us, as with you, Ladies only of great powers of
resistance are presented at our regal Drawing-rooms. Our Court
beauties are very rarely crushed to death. Yours perhaps are not so
fortunate. No lady with us is presentable until she has been examined
on the correlation of forces, and satisfied the chamberlain that she
knows as much about the vis inertiae as a Civil Engineer.
“Speaking of Ladies reminds me that a Fº is silently and stealthily
going on, by which in course of time all the landed property within
your jurisdiction will belong exclusively to the soft sex. Already they
can boast of a numerical balance in their favour of half-a-million, and
sooner or later, by means of that wonderful invention Crinoline, there
will be no standing-room on your enchanted Isle for the nominal Lords
of the Creation, who will be proudly swept into the sea. Then, Woman

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
E notice ev day that the
shadows are lengthening, and
the substances are all going
out of town. Too, too solid
cockney flesh cannot bear the
resent tropical season much
onger. The Organmen, we
devoutly believe, are beginning
to emigrate to Ramsgate,
Margate, and other favoured
watering-places for change of
air. The poor Italian with
the “mobby head of hair,” who
plays, sings, and whistles Di
Pescatore, will go play to the
Fish of the Sea, or, if he be
an angler, may play the Fish
themselves. This mention of
fish reminds us that a beautiful
Catch will shortly appear;
the subject is the River fisher-
man's address to his Bait, and
the words are a
of SHAKESPEARE's beautiful
soliloquy, “Sleep, Gentle,
leep!”
Our immensely popular
PRINCE or WALEs is already
beginning to show the good
effects of a thoroughly sound
Classical Education. His Royal
Highness, we are informed on
the best possible authority,
made an excellent Latin jest
the other day, which we are in
a position to make public. The
PRINCE had just quitted the
PRINCEss Alexandra, and
was on the point of stepping
into his carriage in order to
pay a visit to his Royal Mother, when GENERAL KNoLLys ventured to inquire
whether His Royal Highness was about to return to the Princess. “No,
General. Knollys, I am not,” was the gracious reply, and then, as if struck by a
sudden idea, H. R. H. added. “And yet at the same time I am.” The distinguished
Hero being somewhat puzzled by the paradox, begged, the Prince to explain.
* Why,” returned H. R. H. with the utmost ºndescension, “I’ve just leſ, the
Princess, and now I'm going to Rejime her.” The Prince disappeared in a Cloud
of Dust, and the General retired to borrow a Latin dictionary, in which after some
labour, he discovered the word Regina. He immediately borrowed another dictionary
(English), and wrote a pleasant letter to the REv. CHARLEs Kingsley. - -
A Continental correspondent informs us... that among the numerous Parisian
improvements is a “New Prison which will have the form of a Trºpéze.” We
have not yet heard whether the Governorship is to be offered to M. LeoTARD;
but it is whispered that iſ the next gaol is built in the shape of a Tight. Rope,
the control will be placed in M. Buosdin's hands, on account of his great feat.
Insensibly are we drawn towards our next little piece of information. The
Worshipful Company of Rope makers a few nights since, held their Annual Dinner,

manage to hold it; after the Banquet, which we need
hardly say was very well served by all parties concerned,
the usual toasts were proposed and, when more than the
usual number of bottles had been consumed, the Chair-
man proposed that their Title should be changed to the
“Tight-Ropemakers’ Company.” No one being in a state
to object to anything, the Chairman, in spite of his reso-
lution, was carried away new cos. by the waiters.
“Conviviality breeds contempt” is an ancient and truth-
ful proverb, though we don’t think somehow or another
that we have got it quite right. But no matter, our meaning
is * the same, and the moral from the above anecdote is
evident.
Civilisation, weare glad to say, is making its inroads upon
the Chinese. A *::: Lºlity Company are already
projecting Hotels in the principal thoroughfares, and the
new Broad Way from Pekin to Shanghai will be one of
the finest Inn-roads that civilisation has yet made.
The poet Close has lately been suffering from cold, and
having taken medical advice, sits nightly with his very poor
poetical feet in hot water. He has been visited by MR.
MARTIN TUPPER, who, inspired by the occasion, burst forth
into the following impassioned rhapsody:-
“Poet Close."
Tallow your nose.”
These words will probably be set to music. We shall
have a word to say on the Poet’s behalf next week.
The Chancery Bar and Common Law Bar are now taking
their vacations, but Temple Bar, having no luxury of this
sort, will not leave town. The ceremony of washing this
venerable structure will soon take place: previous to this
function, it will appear in all its ancient grandeur and dirty
state.
Talking of grandeur, the Fireman's Brigade will have a
festival and parade London with a great deal of softwater
pomp. Bands will perform One Pumper at parting, aſter
which the Crystal Palace Fountains will play several selec-
tions from the most popular Water Works of modern
composers; Lurline, for instance.

THE language of the Stock Exchange is sometimes
puzzling to those who are not conversant with it; but the
following statement in the City News of the Post relative
to the Constantinople Money Market, looks at any rate
like plain English:-
“Coupled with reported Ministerial resigmations a fall in Con-
solidés, hastened by some forced executions, took place."

LE MANs, where the celebrated City biscuits are made. O L H.
Lyons, stop to see the Lady.
Montargis, one day to see the Performing Dog.
Up the Rhine to the Tyrol.
Bacharach, Balancez, Hands across and back to your places.
Now then, adopting this scheme, let us say you land at Amsterdam.
The Language.-On disembarking at any Foreign, quay you will first
of all be struck by the language, which is, generally, BAD. Do not
therefore attempt to learn it. And at this point, it will be as well to
draw your attention (what a subject for an artist by the way!) to
Foreign Tongues.—There's the Russian tongue, the R{:} indeer's
tongue, the Ox tongue, and so forth. But this is not, exactly what
you want, is it? No. Very good; then as a beginning let us remark
that je suis means “I ham,” which is the French tongue, and that’s
as much as you can swallow for the present.
Now let us see where are we, Boulogne or Amsterdam? Wherever
you like, my little dear, so we ºil make a few more general observations.
There, are a certain number of objects of interest in every Foreign
town. The first being—
The Banker's or Change-the-money Office, where you’ll cash a cir-
cular note in order to square matters. The generic name for the clerk
at these places is BILLY de Bank; so be careful to address him by his
Christian, which, in this case, is his proper name. If you want to get
full change, don’t go to the nearest banker; the nearest is invariably
the dearest. The Clerk (BILLY) will ask you “How will you have it **
Don’t be bullied, square up and say, “Now, where’ll Yº have it, P’’
BILLY, will subside, and probably alter his question to "What’ll you
take?” When immediately choose the light wine of the country.
Their light wine is better than their light money. If BILLY further
inquire, Dans quelle sorte de monnaie désireriez vous recevoir la somme *
which means, “What’ll you take it in * * say “A glass, of course, and
; good large one too,” whereupon you’ll receive your draught in due
Orin.
The next, and when you are expecting a remittance, or to hear from
Her (ahem 1) the first object of interest is in every town—
The Post Office.— Doors R H L H. Window in flat; and if you
happen to look out, flat in window. If you’ve any brains now's the
time to get a head; you’re certain to require one. If you don’t know
how to ask for it in the language of the country or of the town, adopt
a system of expressive pantomime, thus:—Take an envelope, wet a
corner, put your own head on it, and stamp your foot; you will get what
you want, unless you are at once taken to a Maison de santé, where
you’ll get a great deal more than you want.
We shall continue this interesting subject in our next paper.
“NICE PIECE o' BILED MUTToN, SIR "
THE SHIP OF THE HOLY SEE.
AccorDING to the Paris correspondent of the Times :-
“Advices from Toulon mention the arrival there of the Papal corvette, the Im-
maculate Conception, to go into dock for repairs, which the French Government has
offered to have gratuitously executed for His Holiness.”
The Immaculate Conception thus appears to be, on the one hand an
article of faith which the Pope has added to the Roman Catholic
Religion, and, on the other, an addition to the Papal navy. A very
nice correspondence. The Immaculate Conception is a dogma and also
a corvette. The corvette wants mending; and the dogma may be con-
sidered to require amendment too; but, whilst a corvette is manageable
under steam or canvas, a dogma is too stubborn to go into dock.
Certain it is that the former will at least hold water, whereas the latter
won’t. We wonder what does the Pope want a corvette for Perhaps,
as a man-of-war, to convoy the Bark of PETER.
So We are Toll'd,
It is not generally known that to every Turnpike there is a staff of
Pike-keepers. They are all ugly men, and hence the well-known simile,
“As plain as a Pike Staff.”

A POKE AT PRESIDEN
T LINCOLN.
The New York Herald gives
MR, PRESIDENT LINCOLN a
piece of advice which may be
serious, but appears intended
for a joke. It exhorts him “to
enlist the sympathy of all men,
North and South, by declaring
an intention to drive the English
from Canada and the French
from Mexico.” Of course it
means to insinuate that MR.
LINcoLN is capable of believing
that the only effect of such a
declaration on France and Eng-
land would be that of inducing
them to wait until the sympathy
of all men in both the Federal
and Confederate States had been
enlisted under the banner of the
Monroe doctrine. To impute to
MR. LINcolN the capability of
supposing that the consequence
of threatening to drive France
and England out of Canada and
Mexico would be that they
would stay to be driven, instead
of instantly recognising the
South, making common cause
with it, and breaking the block-
ade, is a meat way of calling
him a fool. The suggestion
that the sympathies of the North
and South should be enlisted by
an expedient which would ma-
nifestly enlist France and Eng-
land on the Southern side, is
just a humorous way of putting
the fact that the United States
Government have got to an end
of Enlistment, and are there-
fore obliged to have recourse to
Conscription.
CRINOLINE FOR GENTLEMEN.
“MR. PUNCH,
“WALKING some distance in the last shower of
rain, I got wet in the legs. When the rain descends
perpendicularly, and I am out in it, my legs, thanks to my
size round at the waist, remain quite dry. But when the
wind blows it aslant, my lower extremities catch it. They
did so the other day, even in spite of the macintosh I
wore, which protected me only down to the knees. My
calves consequently got wet. I mentiop these circumstances
to you, because I hope they may stimulate some one of your
ingenious readers to make a fortune by inventing a
Waterproof Crinoline for gentlemen, which, when ex-
panded, shall answer all the purposes of an umbrella.
“Fireproof Crinolines might easily be made; ibut there is
no demand for them, owing to the general thoughtless-
ness and folly of those who might wear them. If, how-
ever, waterproof Crinolines were to be had, there would
be a great sale for them amongst persons of the rational
sex, such as your constant reader,
“ROTUNDUS.”

Now then, here’s a chance for somebody:—
WANTED, a SLEEPING PARTNER, or Otherwise, who
can advance £400 or £500, to join in an old-established Pickle

Delightful idea this especially for hotweather. Sleeping
in a pickle warehouse. , Delicious motion! 4By the way, in
July, a Chili pickle shop sounds very much like an ice-
house to sleep in. Sleeping partners, we imagine, in spite
of the comfortable dreamy kind of name, must at all times
be very wide awake.
ARCHERY.

are unable to go out of Town and enjoy the summer
sports of the Field, will find their reading-rooms admirably
adapted for archery. From what place could arrows be
better discharged than a bow-window?

SHAM COMMISSIONNAIRES. du in a case of doubt, at head-quarters, would assure the holder
THE soldiers who fight our battles on terms, which anybody who
values his life and limbs must consider to be ridiculously low, are apt
occasionally to lose, the latter as well as, the former. In the event of
losing his life, a soldier, is all right; he is provided for with a shovel:
but if he has the worse luck to lose his limbs, then a grateful but econo-
mical country leaves him to get his living how he can; that is, with
more or less difficulty according to the degree of mutilation which he
has sustained. -
These considerations induced some benevolent persons, shortly after
the end of the Crimean War, to establish a body of errand-men, whom
they called “Commissionnaires,” consisting of meritorious soldiers, dis-
abled from following any other employment than that of carrying
messages, and having, beyond that, no resource but the choice between
mendicity and pauperism.
The founder of this Society of maimed but industrious heroes has
addressed, through the Times, a Caution to the Public against certain
untrustworthy rascals, drunken vagabonds, and dishonest blackguards,
who counterfeit the genuine Commissionnaires; having “assumed a
uniform so like the real one as to deceive casual observers.” He remarks
that, “at present there is nothing to prevent the greatest thieſ in
JLondon assuming the dress of a Commissionnaire, and plundering the
public.” There is nothing, reader, to prevent you, if you look no deeper
than the surface of a Commissionnaire, from intrusting a parcel to a scamp
who will open it as soon as he has turned a corner, and appropriate its
contents if of any value to anybody but their rightful owner.
Note, therefore, that, as the hood does not always make the monk,
so neither does the uniform constitute theCommissionnaire; and attend to
the subjoined notification from the Founder and Commanding Officer of
the Commissionnaires, hailing, under the initials E.W., from the Barracks
of the Corps, Exchange Court, 419 a, Strand, W. C.
“The men ºº:: the corps have the word ‘Commissionnaire' on their caps,
a new collar badge in bronze, with the number of each man, a belt and pouch, and
a ticket-book signed by CHARLEs HANdroRD,' for the purpose of establishing their
identity and giving the tariff.”
| The “ticket-book,” designed to establish the identity of the bearer,
| should be a check-book, which would enable him to give his employer
*: had engaged the right man. In palming off a fictitious
ticket, a sham Commissionnaire would surely be punishable for obtaining
money under false pretences; if not, let an Act be passed early next
Session awarding to any scoundrel convicted of that imposture a larger
measure of imprisonment and hard labour than the utmost that can be
inflicted on a common rogue and vagabond.

MISTAKES BY MEN OF LETTERS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“LET me beg you to direct persons who send
Money Orders, and Postmasters who take them, to attend
to orthography and pronunciation.
“I lately received a Post-Office Order, wherein I was
misnamed a man of three letters. Suppose, for instance,
my name to have been tº: FUR, whereas it is FuRGh.
I dared not sign it with the wrong signature, and the right
would not do. The mistake had to await rectification,
and I my money.
“In this case, the Post-Office may not have been to
blame. The person who sent me the order could not spell.
But I ºr. that my name was taken from his mouth,
and booked phonetically without question.
“A few weeks before, I had to wait about a quarter-of-
an-hour, in a Post-Office whilst the head clerk there was
2ngaged in hunting up a blunder in regard to a Money
Order, which turned out to hinge upon an omitted aspirate.
In this case the name, correctly written, had been handed
in, and had got corrupted in its passage out of the mouth,
or through the pen, of some snob in the office.
“I should be sorry to see any Government situations
engrossed by the aristocracy, and yet there º be expe-
diency in giving Post-Office Clerkships to a class of men
who, being particular about their own names, might be
expected to be exact in spelling those of others. A better
plan would perhaps be to constitute those berths the pº
of success in a competitive examination on orthography. I
will here adopt the signature of
“WALKER.”

A MIDDLE-AGED WIFE WANTED.
MY DEAR MRs. Jon Es, - - -
LET me call your attention, to the following advertisement,
which appeared in a penny paper not long since:-
ATRIMONY.—A Lady earnestly desires that a very dear young,
handsome, amiable, and elegant relative, of undeniable position, may contract
an alliance with a lady of mature age, and having received carte blanche, after con-
vincing him domestic happiness is seldom attainable with a youthful or frivolous
wife, she will be happy to receive propositions from and to introduce into her family
circle an eligible lady, or to negociate with trustees, solicitors, medical practitioners,
or others, able to assist her. This is quite genuine, and idle curiosity will be dis-
agreeably frustrated.
“Young, handsome, amiable, and elegant!”. Here, is a chance, my
dear, Madam, for some of our fair friends. What “lady of mature
age” but would P. jump (were it but thought genteel to do so)
at the prospect of contracting so delightful an alliance' Just consider
for one moment the weight of the four adjective-young ! handsome!!
amiable!!! and elegant!!!! What a delightful “relative” must this
be to possess! And besides, his youth and elegance, good looks and
amiability, there is the further charm of his excellent good sense;
shown clearly by his preference of a wiſe advanced in years, and there-
fore fit to be his helpmate, to the frivolous companionship of a young
and giddy girl. -
But, my dear MRs. Jones, before werecommendour friends Miss —
and Miss- to answer this advertisement, we may advise them to reflect
that though the offer is “quite genuine,” curiosity about it may, not
be quite so “idle” as it is alleged. It is as rare for ladies to adver-
tise for wives as it is for gentlemen to let another person be more active
than themselves in effecting their “alliance,” for such it is the fashion
now for marriage to be termed. One fears then there is something
rather fishy in this notice (if you are puzzled by this adjective, your
girls will tell yºu what it means); and the allusion to the “medical
practitioners’. I, rather think encourages ºne's faithin this idea. The
‘position” of the gentleman may be “undeniable,” but, as not a
word is said about his state of mind or body, it may be that his relative
is tired of the care of him, and is desirous to entrust him to the hands
of some mature-aged person, who though asked to be his wife will find
herself in real truth his keeper or his nurse. -
People who stand trembling upon the brink of matrimony would do
well to look before they leap into the gulf, and by those who may be
tempted into marriage by advertisement ought this rule especially, I
think, to be observed. Maturity of age is not attended always by
maturity of wisdom, and ladies who are gifted with a big bump of
Affection have generally speaking a small one of Cautiousness, at any
rate so far as husbands are concerned. It is for this cause I have
written a few timely words of warning; for I am always, my dear
Madam, your and your delightful sex's very faithful and devoted slave
and safeguard, 43&HNCſº.

WHAT has the reduction of the tobacco duty done for the smoker?
Where is the man who has experienced any diminution in the price, or
improvement in the quality of cigars? These questions are designed
to suggest a subscription for the purpose of offering a Prize Medal to

all the ºr. shall best establish his claim to be regarded as the
producer of a good and cheap Cigar. The thing at present is not to be
had., Yet a fortune might be made by any Tobacconist who would
supply it; and besides he might win the Prize Medal by a safe specula-
tion, which would pay whilst ending in smoke.

FAUST, A comic SONG.
(To be Sung at Music Halls.)
oME, listen to a tale
of woe,
*Twill set your eyes
a running, -
Faust, set to music
by Gounod,
An Opera
stunning.
As in course any
uproar must be, you
know. Eh P But to
proceed:–
Plain Faust most
folks this story
name,
Though some have
thought it meeter,
More fully to des-
cribe the same
As Faust and Mar-
gherita.
Her sight inflamed the art of Fast
With hammerous emotions.
He stopped and spoke to her, the maid
A Lady fair invoking:
“I ain’t a Lady, Sir,” she said,
“Nor fair; and you are joking.”
With that remark she cut her stick,
But Faust he would pursue her,
And Mephistopheles, the trick
To win her, taught her wooer.
He set a casket in her way,
Of jewels, and they caught her:
Trust pearls and diamonds to betray
The art of Heve's true daughter.
Now Faust, a waitin in the street,
Diskivered by her brother,
Slew im, and got poor Marguerite
To ocuser old mother.
Likewise accused of babbycide,
Done whilst she was distracted,
In quod they put her, to be tried
or what she ad transacted.
Tben Faust, with Mephistopheles
To help him liberate her,
Unlocked her prison, without keys,
Or Marguerite.
That’s French, you
Italian; Margaret in
plain English. Faust
is Dr. Faustus, but
different from the play by MARLow, a good deal more than I am from
Billy Barlow, because in that ere car-racter I ave sometimes sung
“Raggedy oh Z" But, however :-
Great Faust, a scollard and a sage,
The wonder of his College,
In learning did his mind engage,
He was so fond of knowledge.
But he grew old, as who does not
Whose life’s of long duration?
And found he little good had got
By all his information.
And then e was infirm too, and obbled like this ere. (Limps.)
So in his study, where he sat
Among his books and bottles,
AGRIPPA's works a workin at,
And studyin HARISTOTLE's,
He was about his mind to ease
By means of deadly pison,
When straightway Mephistopheles
A flash of fire did rise on.
Sitch a Guy Ancient Nicholas without orns and tail. A very near
relation of the Old Gentleman's, if not the Old Gentleman his self,
Dressed in red and black like a Swell of the period, with a cock's tail
feather in is at. An errin-stummicked cove, with an ook nose and oller
cheeks—just so. (Makes faces.) A regular rum 'un.
A vision of fair Marguerite
He did to Faust discover,
Who instantly on her got sweet,
And, for to be her lover !
Did, for a dose of physic sell
his precious soul to Bogey
And stood transformed to a young Swell!
Just now a poor old Fogey.
So now, says Mephistopheles to Faust, “Come, Guv'nor, now let’s set
out on our travels.”
Then Mephistopheles through the air
Did Faust directly carry
And took im to a German Fair!
Where Meph. he played Old ARRY.
Whilst tipsy students stood around,
He tapped a barrel handy:
The wine, when spilt upon the ground,
Flared up and burnt like brandy.
And weren’t they frightened rayther! And warn’t there a jolly row!
Now Marguerite the market crossed,
Returned from her devotions,
know; the other’s
Ere you * peel a tater.
ut she’d gone crazy, so that they
| To stir her were unable,
More than to get an oss away
Out of a burnin stable.
- Faust begged and prayed, said all he could;
Poor thing!, she quite mistook it ;
All his entreaties were no good,
He couldn’t make her hook it.
ow: * : º: dead!
ere all good miggers go, Slts,
I calculate her spirit fled *
And is'n went below, Sirs.
And now to conclude, Lope you don’t suppose I’m so insensible of
the importance of my mission as to forget to remind you that the
affectin little istory which I’ve ad the onour of relatin to yer, as a
purpose and a
MoRAL.
Now you old gents, don't dye yer air,
To go a lady killin,
And all young females you beware
Of every smooth-faced villain.
And young and old, whate'er you do,
Be proof agin temptation
Give ook-nosed fiends your
On no consideration.

DELUSIVE METEORS.
tl AUGUST is known to be the month of meteors—and here is one of
ºnein. :-
“To the Editor of the Times.
“Sir, The “large meteor" seen by MR. CRUMPLEN on Monday evening at 8:27,
three times as brilliant as Venus, and moving from west to east, was a fire balloon
sent up shortly after eight o'clock, from the Eton and Middlesex Cricket ground.
| Primrose Hill, as a finale to some athletic sports which had taken place during the
afternoon.
“I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“St. John's Wood, Aug. 12.” “B.C. C.”
Too much caution cannot be exercised, just at present, in letting off
sky-rockets, which, besides being more than, likely enough to tumble
through skylights, are contrived to burst, and emit clusters of stars and
trains of fire, necessarily apt to be mistaken by observers of nature for
the meteoric phenomena which occur at this time of the year. When
we consider the facility of imitating these appearances, in connection
with the illusory propensities of school-boys, we feel compelled, in the
interests of Science, to rejoice that the holidays are over.
To Let.
A Poor invalid gentleman, very much reduced, lately read in a
medical paper something about."letting blood.”. The unhappy weakly |
creature writes to us to know if we can inform him “who lets it,” and
whether he can on moderate terms hire some for a few years. We refer
him to the Lancet.

BRIGHTON. --
ARBITRARY FLUNKEYISM AT WOOLWICH.
INDELICATE and obtrusive º is only less disgusting
than disloyalty which is coarse and brutal. People, whose
interest in their Sovereign is not restrained by their
manners so as to withhold them from staring the QUEEN
out of countenance, ought to be compelled to keep them-
selves at a respectful distance from her. Farther than
that, however, from the sight of HER MAJESTY there
can be no necessity for keeping any of HER MAJESTY's
subjects. The , following order, promulgated on , the
QUEEN’s embarkation from Woolwich, contains a clause
which certainly does seem calculated to enforce a remote-
ness from the Royal person extending somewhat beyond
the bounds of reason:—
“The route to be taken to-day by HER MAJESTY through the Ar-
senal, as well as the wharf, is to be kept clear from 4 p.m. until the
steamer leaves the arsenal. Any person attempting to loiter on the
route, or on the wharf, or piers, or any one seen at the windows, is
to be immediately removed from the arsenal. No visitors are to be. I
admitted within the gates.
“(Signed) E. M. BoxER, Lieutenant-Colonel.”
. To prohibit º one from º at a window happen-
ing to command a possible view of the QUEEN, was surely
to do what no authority would have done with any con-
siderate eye to the adage which declares that a cat may look
at a king. As if HER MAJESTY had been Lady Godiva
going through Coventry! Is Colonel BoxeR, so super-
stitious as to believe in the “evil eye,” and does he suppose
it to strike at, so long a range, as from the other side of a

A CHARMING SENTENCE ON SCOUNDRELS.
How is it that here in England, the home of honest John BULL, we
cannot venture to rely on trade-marks, so commonly are they falsified ?
Because we want an institution like the Tribunal of Correctional Police
at Rheims. This Court is calculated to have a really correctional
effect on all rogues who get themselves within its jurisdiction. It is
likely effectually to correct the practices which have rendered them
amenable thereunto. Just lately, the Paris correspondent of the Times
informs us, three humbugs, to wit, two wine merchants and a cooper
were convicted before that truly reformatory Tribunal of having forged
the Clicquot brand on certain corks inserted in the necks of divers
bottles of a species of Champagne, of which a quantity had been seized
here in the Victoria Docks. Their fraudulent ingenuity was adjudged
to undergo the following varieties of correction:—
“The Rheims tribunal has sentenced the three offenders to pay £1,200 d es;
also to replace, by unmarked corks, those in the bottles now in the docks, to r
alltº: charges the complainants can prove that they have incurred in the prese-
cution"—
Which were very heavy—
—“And finally to advertise the sentence in the Times, the Moniteur, the Gazette
des Tribunauz, and four other French papers. Moreover, for fraud under the penal
code, two of the offenders are sentenced to fines and to eighteen months' imprison-
ment, and the third to four months of prison; and the wines bearing the false
marks are ordered to be destreyed.”
The last particular of the foregoing sentence is the only one that
seems capable of amendment. The knaves who would falsify a trade-
mark would also fabricate a wine; and these fellows would have been
rightly served if, besides having been fined and imprisoned, and com-
pelled to advertise their own infamy, they had, in addition, been con-
demned to drink their own sham Champagne. But this punishment
might be objected to as brutal, like that, which would have been º
appropriate, of treating, the impostors as, they treated the corks, an
branding them with their own false brand. The correction, however
which they will have endured under the sentence of the Correctio
Tribunal at Rheims, will no doubt suffice to teach them to counterfeit
no more trade-marks, and may deter some other rogues from the like
dishonesty. It is to be wished that there were in England a Tribunal
as able and willing as that of Rheims to bring brand-forgers, and all
other swindling imitators, to reason.
Awful Situation 1
A NAUTICAL Correspondent gives us a graphic account of his position
in a recent storm; he says, “The breeze was blowing galely at first,
but soon became furious. The little craft, which required all our
cunning to manage, had been well pitch'd before leaving shore, and was
now well tossed about at sea. "Few of us knew what to do. The head
winds blew fearfully; we sat speechless with terror, seeing wind, and
tide against us, for, alas! we were tongue-tied in a head wind / A

TITBITS FOR TRAVELLERS.
THE Acclimatisation Society have been at it again, and we find at
a late banquet the bill of fare comprised such dainties as the
ſollowing:—
“White soup of the Channel Islands (made of conger eel), lucioperca, grenouilles
or edible frogs, pepperpot, Chinese lamb, roasted whole, with pilaff and kuscoussos,
powlets a l'émancipation des négres, and ostrich eggs.”
This entertainment is described as “elegant and recherché,” and as
the latter epithet means F. “far fetched,” it is certainly in this
instance by no means ill-applied. We cannot say ourselves that we
should have much appetite for frogs and conger eels, or should look on
lucioperca º: that may be) as an “elegant” refection...We
never tasted kuscoussos, but judging by its name it must be something
rather formidable; and as for ostrich eggs, we doubt if, had we ever
such an appetite, we could anyhow contrive to eat more than a couple
of them."Pilaff may be very nice indeed to those who like it, but as
we never tasted it, we can't say that we do; and as for pepperpot,
without inquiring what it is, we will wager we should much prefer a
pot of porter.
But we really ought to thank the men who eat these messes for their
bravery in trying to discover a new dainty for us. Of course if conger
soup were nice, the price of turtle might be lowered by it; and if
pepperpot and hºcolso were edible and cheap, we should be saved
from much expense in more extravagant made-dishes. We therefore
highly praise and thank these pioneers of progress in the culinary art,
and we really think their bravery in tasting unknown dishes ought to
be rewarded by some ribbon of distinction, something in the fashion of
a Cook's Victoria Cross. Were this new Order of Valour established
to encourage them, other heroes might perhaps be tempted to compete
for it; and other societies might É. the laudable example of dining
annually on dishes which but few people have heard of, and nobody
uite likes. The Geological Society might, for instance, give an earth
east, and taste the various sorts of earth which the earth-eaters are fond
of: while of course the Entomologists might have a feed of insects,
whereat the menu might begin with snail soup and fried, earwigs, then
proceed, by way of entrées, with roast cockroach and grilled grasshoppers,
and conclude with a boiled butterfly and some caterpillar cheese.
So too the Geographical Society might direct their various travellers,
while examining strange countries, to examine strange cuisines; and
when they have been feasting at some foreign Star and Garter, to send
home the recipes for the dishes which most pleased them. They might
also be requested in certain special cases to forward home a sample of
the dishes they most relished, as the condiments for making them might
possibly in England not be easy to obtain. , Pelican patties would for
instance be difficult to get here, and so would tiger cutlets and alligator
chops. Moreover there of course would be insuperable obstacles to our
serving up a dinner here from cannibal recipes; and our only chance of
tasting missionary pie would be to have that dainty sent home ready-
made for us. Only fancy what excitement there would be at Exeter
Hall, were it announced that SIR. R. MuRchison had received for his
next banquet a large slice of baked bishop, which the King of the
Cannibal lini, had sent him, packed in ice

The New York Herald says that—

This means, we suppose, that GENERAL GRANT is organising so
many regiments of coloured troops to become skeletons.

POLICE AND BANDITTI.
EUREKAMEN 1 We have found out what is the reason why the
authorities of Scotland Yard allow artists, authors, students, and
musicians to be driven mad by organ-grinders. The subjoined com-
munication from a young friend is essentially true:-
“MR. PUNCH,
“PLease, Sir, the Police here have a band, which meets to
practise twice a week in the old Godolphin Schoolroom. They kick
up such a jolly row. The tunes they play mostly are the Dead March
in Saul, Adeste Fideles, Martin Luther's Hymn, and such like, a bar, or
whatever you call it at a time, over, and over again. Qne whole day
they were trying just about so much of My Lodging is on the Gold
d, and another, a bit of The British Grenadier, which they did so
slowly that I mistook it for a psalm for ever so long. They are a Brass
Band, and at first people said they were the Pope's playing in the Nunnery
opposite; but this is not correct: and no doubt they disturb the poor
nuns at their prayers and put them preciously out. You never, heard
such howls, and growls, and bangs, and clashes. And sometimes a
fellow misses his note, and blows his trombone askew like, my eye what

“I live with my Uncle. He is writing a book about Astronomy. I
think, and Mathematics. They make him so jolly wild. Their noise
has such an effect on him that he dances about the room like mad,
wringing his hands, and shrieking, and tearing his hair. Very often
also the dog next door begins to howl, which makes it worse; but my
Uncle calls that an improvement on the Policemen's playing. He says
it is useless for him to attempt to read or write during their beastly din.

What do Policemen in particular want with a Band P. Is music in
any way auxiliary to their employment º' To what end do they culti-
vate it? Perhaps, for example, when they collar a thieſ and walk him
off, with a view to playing the Rogue's March. It is, however, to be
apprehended that the musical acquirements of the Police will not be at
all conducive to the apprehension of thieves. Tae Policeman who has
learned to perform upon an instrument will probably be apt to apply
his skill in music chiefly to the private and personal purpose of sere-
mading cookmaids. With his mind intent on some movement in a sym-
phony, he will forget to enforce a movement of more consequence to
the harmony of the public, omitting to bid creators of obstructions to
move on. Instead of “Move on 1’’ he will be likely enough to cry
Allegro Vivace, and ouly incite grinning Italian organ-grinders to grind
the faster. His acquaintance with a HAN DEL may even have the effect
of inducing him occasionally himself to give the grinding organ a turn.
Harmonious Policemen, however, are no more objectionable than
Harmonious Blacksmiths, or any other sons of harmony, and might,
indeed, be encouraged to practise a humanising art in a proper place;
that is in a cellar, or inside a theatre or ...i. where they can only
split one another's ears, and not within walls penetrable by sound,
which allow their dissonance to escape, to the , distraction of, the

Sporting Beggars.
MR. PUNCH reads in the Kelso Chronicle's paragraphs of sport,
“The Hon. MR. Brown, CAPTAIN Jones, and MR. Robisson (or some such names)
on the first day of grouse shooting begged seveuty brace.”
Well, no shame in begging if you can't get what you want in any
other way. And it is better than meanly buying of a gamekeeper, or in-
cluding what the keepers kill, in your own calculation. But we should
like to know of whom these gentlemen begged, as the donors to

How, when AND WHERE 2
or, THE MoDERN Tourist's GUIDE To THE CONTINENT.
WE should advise the Tourist to go straight to Boulogne. This is a
capital starting point, because from Boulogne you can go anywhere,
as of course you can from any other place. And again, from anywhere
you can go to Boulogne; this is another point in its favour, though on
second thought the advantage is equally shared by Ramsgate, Scar-
borough, and other spots on the English coast. We must here caution
the reader, that whenever in the course of this work the word “spots”
is used, we do not mean that the place so indicated is any blemish to
its particular situation. Do we make ourselves understood? Clearly
so; then on we go, which is a rhyme, but it can't be helped and so let
us not say another word about it.
FRANCE.
In France the French language is chiefly spoken; and this, on con-
sideration, is not surprising. At first you will be astonished to hear
the smallest dirtiest little boys in the gutter addressing one another in
French gutturals; and the thoughtful traveller will immediately note
down in his pocket-book that the education of the lower classes on the
Continent is very much superior to that in England. The traveller,
however, on becoming more thoughtful, will probably erase the note
soon after it has been made. Now, we must at once ask you Parlez-
rows Français ? Your answer may be “What’s that to you?” But
that’s rude: so you will politely reply to the interrogator, “I can read
and write it, but don't understand a word of it.” If a Frenchman
makes the inquiry, be ready to say “Bangpoo may john tong,” which
means, “I don’t speak it much, but I know what you are talking
about,” and after having thus delivered yourself walk off quickly in the
opposite direction. Let us here pause to make one remark about-
Comfort.—Always make yourself quite at home, remembering, that,
by pursuing this course, you have the advantage of the poor ignorant
foreigners, who are always “abroad.”
Choice ºf Hotels-At Boulogne there is very little choice. They are
mostly kept by an English proprietor ºf the name of Bains; at least,
we so gather from having seen Hôtel de Bains inscribed over the doors
of several large houses. The best hotel is the Hôtel de Pille. To be
taken in here, however, requires a certain amount of personal interest
with the native police. They will sometimes show you the inside of
this building for nothing. On the occasion of our visit, in company
with a gendarme, we were obliged to make several complaints, to which
no attention was paid ; and we cannot, therefore, recommend the place
to our friends.
While upon the subject of complaints, it would be as well to mention
that any communication about faults in the cuisine, must be made by
letter to the Minister of the Interior. This General Regulation applies
to every part of France.
Walks.-Your first Walk at Boulogne will be from the steamboat to
the Custom House, and during these few steps you will have great
opportunities of noticing the physiology of the Lower French Classes,
who speak a very different language to the youth of both sexes who
are ranked under the same title in our English schools. The voyage
will probably have improved neither your personal appearance nor your
temper. As you may not understand the observations that are made as
you pass between the two lines of the mob thus assembled to welcome
you, we will translate them for the traveller's benefit; who is sup-
posed to be walking along feebly and wretchedly as after a bad passage.
Our cheery lively neighbours are assembled to greet you:—
First Lively Neighbour (addressing himself generally to lots ºf lively
neighbours). “Oh! look there! There’s a white roastbeeſ!” (This
means you, you know.)
All (laughing). He he he hel hel (Ad lib. till they think of
something else to say.)
More Lively Neighbour. “I say, Mister, ain't yer well ?”
All (laughing at you again, you know). “He, he, he, hel” (Adlib)
Small Neighbour (litelier than ever, pointing distinctly at you, with a
very dirty finger). “He wants some portare beer.’”
All (immensely tickled by this witty homethrust). “He he he he
hel hel” &c. &c. (Ad. lib)
Somebody in the Crowd (who has a slight acquaintance with our lan-
guage, says in French-English). “He’s a grrrreat long strºrrong.” (The
mother tongue attracts your attention, and you turn round, and the speaker
arrives at the end of his limited vocabulary with) “Oh, ye–ees | *
All (highly relishing the joke which the traveller cannot of course be
at first eapected to see). “ ſ ye—ees! Oh, ye-ees! He he he he l’”
&c. &c. Which will be continued until the last voyageur has disap-
peared within the doors of the Douane.
The Custom House.--You will be asked if you’ve anything to declare.
Now's the time for the traveller to assert himself. If it is a lady, let
her say “Well, I declare!” and then refuse to utter another syllable.
give up your keys. They’ve no right to ask you, at least they would not
dare do it iſ they were in England, the cowards! Mind you say all
this, adding the line about what your native country is in the habit of
expecting, the conduct of every one to be with regard to Duty. They
will want to inspect your hat-box—always make a difficulty about your
hat-box, and then take good care that there is nothing inside when you
open it. A hat-box lined with red has a deep political signification; so
has black, and white; blue and yellow are also the signs in constant
use among the carbonari ; so take care. The punishments still in vogue
in France are hanging, drawing, quartering, whipping, scourging with
fish-hooks, branding on the nose, hot-ironing, and mangling is still
done here. For a minor offence, say for instance, a smaller hat-box
with a less deep lining, you will render yourselfiable to be loaded with
chains and blown up by a magistrate. Do not tremble, be sweetly
polite, address each of the Douamiers as “Milor,” and all will be well.
Precautions.—To save all the above-mentioned trouble (and any further
annoyance), write over to Boulogne generally some days before, and
say you’re coming. If you can't write, get somebody to go over instead
of you, or Don't Go. The observance of this last precaution will, at some
future time in this invaluable Guide, lead us to give some advice as to
what is to be done by the Traveller who stays at home. At present
we are on the Continent.
Geographical position of the Continent.—The Continent is a neck of
land divided from every other place by something or other which is not
surrounded on all sides by wafer. To bring the definition nearer home
is impossible, as it would involve moving France, Russia, Spain, Austria,
&c. &c.; however, the reader may be sure that whenever there is a
movement in any one of these places, we will take advantage of it.
The Continent then is not simply Boulogne, howbeit, many to this
day are of that opinion. What then is the Continent? it is a Tract of
Land; and being a Tract, is imagined by a few to belong to some pro-
selytising society. This idea has no foundation in fact. After these
few but useful remarks we will proceed.

Another great, grey-headed, chieftain gone
To join his brethren on the silent shore!
Another link with a proud past undone!
Another stress of life-long warfare o'er'
Few months have passed since that grey head we saw
Bending above the vault where OUTRAM slept;
Lingering as if reluctant to withdraw
From that grave-side, where sun-bronzed soldiers wept.
The thought filled many minds, is he the next
To take his place within the Abbey walls?
A gnarlèd trunk, by many tempests vext,
That bears its honours high, even as it falls.
He is the next the name that was a fear
To England's swarthy foes, all India through,
Is now a memory ! No more fields will hear
His voice of stern command, that rang so true.
The tartaned ranks he led and loved no more
Will spring, like hounds unleashed, at his behest;
No more that eye will watch his soldiers o'er,
As mothers o'er their babes, awake, at rest.
A liſe of roughest duty, from the day
When with the boy’s down soft upon his chin,
He marched to fight, as others run to play, ,
Like a young squire his knightly spurs to win.
And well he won them; in the fever-swamp
In ſoughten field, by trench and leaguered wall,
In the blank rounds of dull routine, that damp iſ
Spirits of common temper more than all,
He trod slow steps but sure; poor, without friends,
Winning no way, save by his sweat and blood;
Heart-sick too often, when from earned amends
He saw himself swept back by the cold flood,
Against which all must strive, who strive like him
By merit's patient strength to win the goal,
Till many a swimmer's eye grows glazed and dim,
And closes, ere the tide doth shoreward roll.
Stout heart, strong arm, and constant soul to aid,
He sickened not nor slackened, but swam on;
Though o'er his head thick spread the chilling shade,
And oft, twixt seas, both shore and stars seemed gone.
Till the tide turned, and on the top of flood
The nigh-spent swimmer bore triumphant in;
And honours rained upon him, bought with blood,
And long deferred, but sweeter so to win.
And fame and name and wealth and rank were heaped
On the grey head that once had held them high ;
But weak the arm which that late harvest reaped,
And all a knight's work left him was to die.
Dead! with his honours still in newest gloss,
Their gold in sorry contrast with his grey:
But by his life, not them, we rate his loss,
And for sweet peace to his brave spirit pray.
No nobler soldier's heart was ever laid
Into the silence of a trophied tomb; "
There let him sleep—true gold and thrice assayed
By sword and fire and suffering—till the doom!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“CAVE CANEM.”
THERE are, certain petty social nuisances which, we can only hypo-
critically smile upon, and cheerfully, hypocritically again of course,
make up our minds to endure. One of these nuisances is the Man
of Many Dogs. Dear as his own children, if he has any, and dearer | M.
if he hasn’t, to their owner, they are equally troublesome to the
casual visitor. Let us say, for instance, that Jones keeps six or
seven dogs of different sorts and sizes. Jon Es ruralises, within an
easy distance of town, and you, whose work is, in London, obtain
half a day's respite from labour, and run down by train to enjoy a
leasant talk and a good walk through the fresh air and over the green
elds that surround the house, that Jon Es, has built. You, whose
heart yearns towards your friend, are received by large dog number one
at the front gate, as if you were a prowling thief, a rogue, and a vaga-
bond. He is no respecter of persons, and were he more free you would
be even less welcome than you are. Scylla is passed, but there is a
Charybdis to be passed in the shape of an enormous Blood Hound who,
unable, in consequence of the restraints of civilised life, to indulge his
natural inclinations, stands on the top of his kennel and yowls at you in
savage disappointment. Jon Es will tell you afterwards that the crea-
ture is of an affectionate disposition and will “readily attach himself to
ou, when he knows you”; you cannot help inwardly feeling that, if
oose, he would attach himself to you with equal readiness, even when
he hadn’t the pleasure of your acquaintance. Then there is the medium
sized black shaggy dog of uncertain breed and dangerous eye, who lies
on the mat before the front door and at your approach growls suspi-
ciously. You stop and say feebly “Poo'dog, Poo'old fellow, then,” and
comfort yourself with the assurance that he won’t bite if you’re not
afraid of him; but as you can't help feeling confoundedly afraid of him
the odds are that he will. So then you stand hesitatingly with this
ferocious nuisance 'twixt you and the bell. A servant accidentally
coming to the door lets you out of the difficulty and in to the house.
We say nothing of the King Charles of whom you make a mortal
enemy by nervously sitting upon him when asleep in an arm-chair. We
pass over the wretched little toy terrier, who being allowed on the table
at luncheon time, pushes his nose into your plate of pigeon pie, and with
a tip of his tail spills your sherry over your light summer wear. Let
that go: you can only say “Oh, never mind, never mind, it doesn't
matter in the least,” and look as ifſ. rather preferred being damp and
uncomfortable than otherwise; professing great joy of course on hearin
that “Sherry doesn’t stain” upon which you can say: “Oh, that’s all
right,” albeit you have a misgiving upon the subject which no assurance
can overcome. No; it is in the afternoon walk, when every dog becomes
a bore. You want to keep up with the pedestrian exercise an entertain-
ing two hours converse with Jones. Jones says at starting, “You
don’t mind bringing the dogs with us, do you, just for a run ' " If you
are strong-minded you will object; if not, you won’t. Of you both
start with a pack d six or seven. At the finish of the first half-mile
you are warming into a mutual exchange of thought and useful expe-
riences. You ask Jones why he advises you against a certain speculation
which to you seemed highly advantageous. e begins his answer thus.
-“Well you see there are a great many reasons: first"—here he sud-
denly stops and looks about quickly, then addresses you with some
anxiety—“Are all the dogs here?”
You pretend to count and say “yes,” at hazard.
“No,” says he, “Spot's not here” (whistles). “Spot! Spot!
Spot ' " (calls ad libitum.) “Confound that dog I do you mind going
back a little way?” Of course you say you don't, and you both retrace
your steps down the lane. Aſter going about a hundred yards, during
which Jones does nothing but whistle and call, Spot breaks out of the
hedge at the point you’d just left, and comes at full gallop towards you.
He is rebuked and off you start again.
“You were saying—” you commence, anxious for the important infor-
mation.
“Ah, yes!” returns Jones, evidently having forgotten all about it.
“Ah! oh yes—I remember—well—one of the chief things against that
Mining Company, is this—(stops). Mop’s gone now-(calls) Mop!
Mop!" Mopſ , (whistles). Would you mind just getting over that
paling and seeing if the little brute’s got into the field after the hares.
Mop! Mop! Mop! (Then to another dog that's running away.) Ah! come
here, Sir!–Would you!” After getting very hot and tearing your
clothes in hunting after Mop for some considerable time, Jon Es arrives
at the conclusion that “the little beggar has gone home,” which ulti-
mately turns out to be the case.
." Well,” begins Jones, aſter your walk has been resumed for some
minutes, “The chief reason against this entering into the speculation
is, that, in the first place, all the Directors”—here you come in sight
of a pond, and he breaks off—“Just see Nep go in the water; lend me
our stick: Hie in, Nep; jº * then; Hie in, Sir.” But there
§: no response to this order of the bath, you look round and dis-
cover the Newfoundland sportively engaged in hunting a calf round a
neighbouring field. When at length he does condescend to fetch your
stick he is sure to trot away with it, and being after some time tired of
his prize he drops it in some out-of-the-way spot of which only the
sagacious brute himself has any knowledge. The conversation is never
resumed, as you, are fretting about this valuable walking-stick; and it
is highly probable that on your return to town you make an unfortu.
nate venture, in the very speculation against which your friend would
have ºly cautioned you had he not iºd to be a Man of
any Dogs.
COURT CIRCULAR DURING THE REGENCY OF
MR. PUNCH.
AFTER Breakfast Mr. Punch exercised the Royal Clothes horses in
the drive. The Hon. BADEN Towei, was the Equerry in waiting. |
Qn his return Mr. Punch kicked Toby of the Royal Drawing room |
§ and then proceeded in state to open the Royal Dining-room
Windows. -
At twelve o'clock Mr. Punch graciously gave an audience to the Royal
Housemaids on the subject of Sweeping Reforms, and appointed the
Rºyal Chimney Sweep to attend with his soot on the following morning.
The Royal Party at Luncheon consisted of Mr. Punch. Brown Hoi.
land covers were laid for the Royal Furniture.
At half-past, three Mr. Punch, driven out by ennui, took the Royal
Linen for an airing in the park.
Several of, the Noble. Pier-glasses still remaining in Town were
honoured with an invitation to dinner.
.The circle at the Royal Table consisted of a Round of Beef. During
dinner Mr. Punch's Private Band, Drums and Pandean Pipes, attended
and played the following selection:— -
Overture to The “Railway Guide”. - - - BRADSHAw.
Fantasia on “Jim along Jose" (Spanish Airs) . . . M. F. Turprit.
“Long Live the Emperor" (Mexican National Melody). Louis Napoleon.
Number 86 in the Books . - - - - - . PAT GREEN.
Volunteer March (from “Wimbledon)" . WALKER.
At half-past ten, p.m., Mr. Punch, attended by Lond PALMEaston,
took a cup of coffee.
At eleven º'clock. Mr. Punch received Loap PALMEaston, who pre-
sented himself on his departure for Broadlands.
At half-past eleven Mr. Punch attended by Toby, went to sleep on
the royal sofa.
At one o'clock, a.m., Mr. Punch rang the drawing-room bell. He
was attended by nobody.
A DOUBTFUL RECOMMENDATION.
. THE wisdom of the law of course is undeniable, but the wisdom of a
jury is sometimes problematical. The other day for instance at the
Liverpool *::::: Spanish sailor was indicted for stabbing in the
street two men who chanced to jostle against him (one of whom died
afterwards of the wounds which he inflicted), and the jury finding him
guilty, recommended him to mercy. “on account of his being a foreigner
and not understanding the English language.” Upon this the Judge
lººke, feeling doubtless, like ourselves, a little puzzled by such
ogic:–
“Do I understand you to mean, gentlemen, that although you do not think those
grounds sufficient to justify you in saying that it mitigated the offence from murder
to manslaughter, yet it is a matter which somewhat palliates the offence?
“THE FokkMAN. That is so, my Lord.”
Whipping out a dagger and stabbing a man who happens to run
against you in the street is not a thing to be excused in an English
Court of Justice, because, forsooth, the perpetrator happens not to be
an Englishman. If Spaniards choose to live in England, they should
remember where they are, and must take the legal consequences if they
happen to forget themselves. Stabbing people in the street may pos-
sibly with certain foreigners be a custom of their country, but happily
it is not yet one of ours, and we hope it never will be. If we allow
such customs to be naturalised among us (and if we pardon them in
foreigners we shall gradually do so), there really is no telling what out-
rages may shock us. Were the delightful KING of DAHOMEr for
instance, to reside here, and to amuse himself one day by cutting a few
score of throats, or chopping half a hundred of his servants' heads off,
we suppose a Liverpool jury would recommend him to mercy, on the
ground that, poor dear man! he chanced to be a foreigner and hap-
pened not to understand the Euglish language.
Change for the Better.
WHEN the organ nuisance shall have been swept away from our
streets, that fearful instrument. of ear-piercing torture called the
hurdy-gurdy will then (thank Parliament') be known as the Un-heardy-
gurdy.

A NEW NAME FOR A MAID-SERVANT.
WHEN will people learn to call a spade a spade? For
instance, only look at this:–
WANTEP. a GOVERNESS, “competent,” and to take
entire charge of the Wardrobe of six Children.—Apply, &c.
She who takes “entire charge of the wardrobe” of
half-a-dozen children, should be called a clothes-keeper
rather than a governess. But a governess is often hired
for less pay than a maid-servant; and so, when ladies want a
mistress of the robes worn in the nursery, instead of asking
for a nursemaid or a wardrobe-woman, they add a smack
of education to their other requisitions, and in their adver-
tisements say they want a governess.

THE WALKING TOUR.
Astonish ED PEDESTRIAN (He with the Knapsack). “What the deuce, George / I
thought we were going to walk How d'you mean to carry all that Furniture;
the Coffin for?”
GEorge (A Swell). “Coffin ' My dear fellow. Most adm'rable contrivance ; carries
your Dress Coat, without creasing itſ Fellow must have a dress—”
[At the first mention of the “Dress Coat," Pedestrian declares the engagement
“off” and retires in dudgeon.
A SAD BLOW FOR THE SPIRIT-RAPPERS.
IN an article upon “Modern Spiritualism” in the last Quarterly
Review, it is stated among other things concerning MR, Home, the
Medium, that he has been rather variously inclined in his religious
phases of belief, having first been a member of the Kilk of Scotland,
aſter that a Wesleyan, after that a Congregationalist, next a catechu-
men in Swedenborgianism, and finally a convert to the Roman Catholic
church. The writer adds in a footnote—
“We are told that MR. Howe's last conversion has given great scandal to some of
the Protestant organs of spiritualism in the press, who however console themselves
with the thought that he may perhaps be destined to convert the Pope to a belief
in rapping.”
If MR. Home be a good Catholic he cannot have much faith himself
that this will be his destiny: for the Quarterly informs us that when he
was converted “he was assured by his Confessor that, as he was now a
member of the Catholic Church, his power [as a spiritualist] would not
return to him.” Whether this be so or not, it is certain that MR. Howe
has done nothing in the rapping way of late, that the world at large has
heard of: and if his conversion has knocked the rapping out of him,
we beg leave to congratulate him as well as his Confessor, and to give
whatever praise is due unto them both. We know the old saying about
“two of a trade,” and a church that has its own old superstitions to sup-
port is not likely to look favourably upon new ones that may rival them.
The gullibility of man, although immense, may be exhausted: and
while the Romish priests have their own little peepshows to look after,
such as their Yearly Bleeding Saint and Winking Picture of the Virgin,
they are not likely to encourage spirit-rapping exhibitions, which may
also have a tendency towards exhaustion of credulity.
Punch has never been accused of having used his pen too freely to
advocate the doctrines of the Romish Church: but he must candidly
KickHAM, GILL, and FINNERTY,
Treason may spout and spit;
Neither will get . skin hurt, he
Has a deal too much wit.
They’ll egg on to assassination
A bog-trotting humbugged wretch,
And leave him to strangulation,
Whilst themselves they bilk Jack Ketch.
PREVENTION OF RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
WE are informed by an interesting Parliamentary return,
that, during the year ending December 31, 1862, there
were 216 persons Fila and 600 injured in consequence of
railway accidents, whereas, during 1861, the number of lives
lost through them was 284, and the number of persons
injured 883. Since, in 1862, there were many more miles of
railway open than in 1861, the preceding figures indicate
a relative decrease considerably greater than the absolute
diminution of the list of the railway killed and wounded.
What an encouragement this, is to juries to go on giving
heavy damages to persons who have sustained injuries
or lost relations by any railway accident which human
ſorethought could possibly have prevented.
and what's
confess that he respects the Papal faith, far more highly than he does
the humbug of the Spirit-rappers. So Punch is not displeased to learn
that MR, Home has left the latter for the former: and so far from
expecting him to make the Pope a Medium, or to cause St. Peter's
chair to jump about the Vatican by any spirit-moving art, Punch looks
forward ere long to find that MR. Home has been induced by his Con-
fessor to make a full confession of all the artful dodges by which he
§§ the dupes who were so weak as to put faith in his spirit-rapping
tricks.
Fashionable Announcements.
THE Lord High Admiral of Switzerland has arrived at the Clarendon
otel.
The Bishop of Dahomey has landed at Southampton,
The Duke of New York is expected at the American Embassy.
Apartments have been provided for His Grace at Windsor Castle.
Cardinal Camminatore, the Papal Nuncio, has left Leicester Square
for Peterborough. His Eminence is charged by the Pope with a box of
Italian confectionery, and the apostolical benediction of his Holiness for
MR. WHALLEY.
Bogie and the Bottle.
SAYs GEORGE CRUIKshANK, in a letter to the Athenaeum on the
subject of Ghosts:—
“In fact I may say that, for more than half a century, I have been from time to
time holding up ghosts to ridicule and contempt.”
... We did not know that our friend GeoRGE had been so long engaged
in quizzing ghosts, though we were aware that of late years he had
been making terrible fun of spirits.

VOLUNTEERS! ATTENTION!
Oho! Gentlemen Wolunteers, no
more sugarplums and bonbons for
you. No more bland regular officers
to put you through your manoeuvres
with an indulgent eye, and then to
assure you, with smiling ſaces, that
they have often seen soldiers, but
never in their lives saw such skilful,
manly, smart, adroit, intelligent,
efficient soldiers as the Eleventh
Fleabittenshire Volunteer Rifles, or,
as the case may be. As we, the
nation, pay you now, we propose to
look after you a little more sharply,
and see that our money is not thrown
away. You are going to be told the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help yourselves as
best you may. Would you like a
specimen of what you are going to
catch, when you deserve it? See
what a corps formed, it seems, of
Foresters, and called the Fourth
City of London, has caught. These
respectable Foresters were inspected
the other evening by Colon EL
MoRRIs, on behalf of Government,
and if you think that he drew it
particularly mild, we are not precisely
of your opinion. Dirit MoRRis:–
“I am sorry, I cannot congratulate you on any great improvement in your drill
since I inspected you in the Regent's Park last year. Indeed, the only one thing I
see in the shape of improvement is a little advantage with respect to your uniforms.
* * I must say that, in my experience, I have neverseen any corps of volunteers
so backward, either this or last year, as this one. If it is worth a man's while to enter
the service as a volunteer, it is worth his while to learn the duty and the drill
efficiently, and do it well. The whole of your movements have been done in a
careless and unsoldierlike way, and I feel it my duty to tell you so. * * One
captain of company, the gentleman who was called out and put you through your
manual and platoon, seemed to know his work, but with regard to the other officers,
there were no words of command given, and no effort made to check men going
wrong, and therefore we heard the voice of the paid instructor bellowing all over the
place. All I can say is, that it has been very bad, and I hope another year to find
your drill a little better."
There, Gentlemen Volunteers, we think that may be called speaking
out, and when the gallant and uncomplimentary colonel had done, he:
informed the unfortunate Foresters that he should certainly tell the WAR
SECRETARY what a set of pumps they were. Mr. Punch, who may be
said to have made the Volunteers, inasmuch as he loyally encouraged
and petted them, instead of scrunching out the movement, as he could
have done in three numbers, is sorry that any corps should have deserved
such a wigging, but is glad that such a wigging, being deserved, has
been administered. He certainly was beginning to think that inspect-
ing officers were rather lavish of stereotype commendation, and as the
force is quite strong enough now to need no bolstering up, it is well
that Volunteers should, comprehend that, there is to be no more non-
sense. They must stick to company drill, or we would rather have
their room than their company in our Household Guard. No more
playing at soldiers.
OUR DUTY TOWARDS OUR NIGGER.
THE different. Clergy of the Confederate States have addressed a
manifesto to their “Christian Brethren” throughout the world against
the Yankees. As against the Yankees, there is perfect truth in this
protest; but there is one part of it which asserts Slavery to be a provi-
dential institution. This winds up with a quotation from the First of
Paul to Timothy on the very different matter of servitude as it was in
Timothy's diocese, prescribing rules for the conduct of servants,
denouncing any man who should teach otherwise, and ending with the
words “from such withdraw thyself.” Whereupon these evangelical
gentlemen subjoin the following observation:—
“That is what we teach; and obedient to the last verse of the text, from men
that “teach otherwise'—hoping for peace—we “withdraw' ourselves."
The inverted commas with which these reverend divines accentuate
their extracts from the apostolic text in taking them to themselves,
appear to º: their profession of preaching and practising just what
the Apostle tells them a rather sarcastic significance. The pretence of
obedience to St. Paul in upholding Slavery and resorting to Secession,
certainly does sound something too much like the combination of a
snuffle and a sneer.
MEDICAL –Åtna has been vaccinated for an Eruption. The moun-
tain is getting ou as well as can be expected.
A POSER FOR THE PEACE PARTY.
INSTINCTIVELY as we recoil from controversial ink-shed, our columns
being neutral ground, we cannot warn off all epistolary duellists.
There is something very terrible, however, in two professors of peace
principles, brandishing their paper knives and lunging for a deadly
intellectual thrust. To this spectacle our readers are now invited. For
our own part, we remain with folded arms, aiding and comforting
neither combatant. It is a pretty quarrel as it stands, and we have no
desire to heighten its charms.
OLIVER SUCKLE to JoHN BRIGHT.
“Friend JoHN,
“Living down in the Fens surrounded by mist, I, seldom see
that guiding star which you suppose to be Jupiter, but which I rather
think is in the milky way. You will not wonder therefore at my
ignorance of many things, especially Federalism, over whose convulsed
form it appears you are now passionately weeping, while administering
strong stimulants with a view to her recovery. * * Now, when
I was solicited to, and did become a subscriber to, the Peace Society,
I clearly understood that the Bill bore your indorsement. If it was
not indorsed by you, then my money was obtained by false pretences.
If contrariwise it was so indorsed, then I ask how can you consistently
side with those whose cry is “War, War,” and (at any price) nothing
but War. A simple answer to this simple question will oblige
“Your well-wisher, OLIVER SUCKLE.”
John BRIGHT to OLIVER SUCKLE.
“Friend OLIVER, ---
“You need not have told me that you were a political dunce.
“Your mind enlightened by no dazzling star.
In gloom Cimmerian, of course you are.
“My simple answer to your simple question is this, those with
whom I consistently side are fighting for the liberty of others–nothing
more; that secured, hostilities, cease. And, between fighting for
selfish and fighting for charitable purposes, I think even your Boeotian
intellect will perceive a wonderful difference.
“Yours ever in haste, John BRIGHT.”
- OLIVER SUCKLE to John BRIGHT.
“Friend JoHN, -
“Certainly, between fighting for selfish and fighting for
charitable purposes, there is a wonderful difference. But why fight
at all. Now, the Peace Society was formed to urge Governments to
substitute Arbitration for War.” Now if Arbitration is desirable and
practicable in any quarrel, why not in this? . A simple answer to this
my second simple question will be esteemed by
“Yours always serene, OLIVER SUCKLE.”
John BRIGHT to OLIVER SUCKLE.
“MR. SucKLE,
“I always deprecate discussions that can have, no useful
result. Arbitration I still contend is the best steersman, but I reserve
to myself the right and power to throw Arbitration overboard when he
becomes like yourself, a troublesome fellow and won't obey my signals.
§. recommending you to attend to your farm and not perplex
your head with things which you, evidently cannot understand, any
further communication from you will remain unanswered.
“Yours, &c., J. BRIGHT.”
OLIVER SUCKLE to John BRIGHT.
“My *g dear Friend,
“So dearly do I love Peace, that not another word shall
escape from my pen tending to a breach of it." You will, however, not
be offended by my simply observing, that its warmest advocates are its
coolest friends, and having parted with my money under an erroneous
impression, and seeing no prospect of any adequate return, I feel that
like a well-dressed goose, f am done brown on both sides.
“Yours sincerely, more in sorrow than in rage,
“OLIVER SUCKLE.”
“P.S. Would there be any harm in your trying to bring about, an
amicable adjustment? I ask this, not to cause irritation, but in justice
to a Society which has overslept itself. It is now time, that it should
get up and go to work. As one of its guardians, will you be kind
enough to knock at the door?”
Fearful Tragedy.
THE other day an eccentric gentleman was standing on the top of the
Monument with a friend, with whom he had promised subsequently to
dine. Wishing, however, to go to the theatre, he determined to throw
his friend over, and slip out quietly. He effected his cruel purpose, and
we regret to say, has not since been seen.

A BILL OF HEALTH.
MR, LEIGH MURRAY is one of the very best of our few good actors,
and the stage is a loser by the unfrequency of his appearance. His
health has not been good, and we are doubly glad, for his own sake and
for that of his art, to see that he has resumed his engagements. He
dresses, walks, and speaks like a gentleman, and acts with a full com-
prehension of his aut or, and an earnest intention of making his author
comprehended. And in the more elevated drama, MR. LEIGH MURRAY
shows that he has loftier gifts. Mr. Punch is happy to have an oppor-
tunity of saying this. Having said it, he begs to remark upon a novelty
which MR. MURRAY's manager has introduced into the play-bills.
These interesting documents announce that MR. LEIGH MURRAY will
appear “ having recovered from an attack of Rheumatic Gout.” It is
all matter of taste, and some persons may enjoy a comedy'the more
from knowing exactly what has been the matter with a leading per-
former, but on the whole we almost think that “indisposition,” or
“ illness,” would have been enough, without such very decided realism.
Suppose this fashion of letting the audience into the entire confidence
of the performers were to prevail, what a cheerful play-bill we might
have, especially in an influenza season. We should read that—

. This sort of thing would certainly give the audience a personal interest
in the performer, and the latter would be curiouslywatched to see whether
any signs of the late º could be detected. So far, that sym-
pathy would be created which aids the electric effect of art; but, on the
whole, we think that the afflictions of our favourite artists had better
continue to be vested in the graceful indefiniteness of a doctor's certifi-
cate, and we beg to add that we should not have taken any notice of the
little eccentricity on the part of the Strand management, if it had not
enabled Mr. Punch to apprise LEIGH MURRAY that he, P., is exceedingly
glad to see him, L. M., again at his work. Good actors are not so
plentiful in these days that we can spare a very good one.
A GORILLA AT RAMSGATE.
MR. PUNCH regrets to observe that while MADAME DU CHAILLU, wife
of the brave traveller and Gorilla-slayer, was bathing the other day at
Ramsgate, she was assaulted by a loathsome creature which the Magis-
trates fined £20, believing that it was a man, called JoHN BENson, a
bag-man, with a wife and children. Magistrates are not celebrated for
wisdom, and these Ramsgate beaks may be excused for not º:
that the beast was a gorilla; wishing to avenge its slain friends. Brave
M. Du CHAILLU has departed on another exploring tour, and though
when he hears the news he will feel, as a husband should, in regard to
the annoyance to his wife, he will be pleased that the Ramsgate Magis-
trates, though in a blundering manner, sought to avenge the inhospitable
assault." He will laugh to see that they fined the brutal gorilla, instead
of tying it up to a post and flogging it soundly. It must be watched,
however, and at the first demonstration of inclination to renew such an
outrage, it had better be sent to PROFEssoR. Owen, and for safety’s
sake, the skin, which can easily be removed with a good horsewhip, had
better go by separate conveyance.

Job at the Foreign Office.
AND so SIR JAMEs HUDson is choked off to be super-
seded by an ELLIOT! It is a wonder that EARL, Russell
is not tired of finding places for the ELLIoIs, of whom there
are so many. He must be very patient. The continual
task of placing out those ELLIOTs is enough to tire the
patience of JoB.
Health of the Metropolis.
A GENTLEMAN who lately took a house near the Marble
Arch, in order that his health might be benefited by the
breezes, blowing across Hyde Pauk, now complains of the
want of fresh air, alleging as his reason that the park is so
close. This must be looked to.

(SEPTEMBER 5, 1863,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WYE AND WAYFARE.
AND Wherefore, my dear
Punch, you have not seen
me lately, I will explain as
well as this bad pen will let
me; and did you ever, let
me ask, get at a country
house a good one P
“The fact is, then, that
having nothing to do in
town, and there being no-
body now left in town to do
it with, I thought I could
not well do better than go
into the country; and wish-
. to enjoy the most ab-
solute tranquillity, I have
been staying at a house
where there were half-a-
dozen children. I lately
read a paper in a cereal ma-
gazine, treating of the Pro-
hable Extinction of Blue
Eyes; and if I saw any
cause before to doubt that
probability, my visit to this
count house must cer-
§ ave strengthened it.
Brighter blue I never saw
than were the eyes of the
half-dozen, from the SAMson of eleven to the GoLIATH of scarce tw
whom I would freely back to win the first prize at a baby-show, bo
for beauty and for bigness. - - - -
“Of course you know a house cannot be otherwise than quiet with a
| leash of grown-up girls and half-a-dozen healthy boys in it; and as
their parents may at times feel rather bored by their tranquillity, I
proposed a couple of days’ excursion down the Wye, which, it chanced,
was not far distant. In your aquatic explorations have you ever seen
this river? If not, take my advice and a cab at once and do so. You
will, besides the cab, have to take a trip by railway to the town of
Ross, where you will please touch up your memory and recollect John
KYRLE, the famous Man of Ross,’ and the (to my mind) not so
famous bit of poetry Pope wrote of him. The LoRD CARLISLE forgive
my speaking lightly of his favourite, but I wonder, in what dictionary
the poet found the verb repose” described as having the meaning
which he gives to it hereunder:-
“Whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows?
Whose seats the weary traveller reposef
Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise?
[Who filled the butchers' shops with large blue flies?]
The Man of Ross, each lisping babe replies.”
“I beg your pardon, MR. Pope... If the babies lisped, they’d say,
“The Man of Roth.”
“The ordinary tourist may have heard the name of Pope, if he have
not that of KYRLE ; and it is possible he likewise may have heard the
name of NewTo.N. The recollection of this name may be of use to him
at Ross, for he will find a MR. NEWTON there of whom to hire a
W. or, if he prefer it, he may get one at the Post Office.
What connection there can be between the Post Office and boating I
leave your clever readers at full liberty to guess; but it is certain that
at Ross I was directed to the Post Office when I asked the civil station-
master where I could get a boat. Thirty shillings is the charge for a
‘one man’ boat to Chepstow, but we, being heavy swells, of course
required a 'two men boat, and so paid twenty shillings, more for it,
together with a pour-boire of five shillings to the men. To a cockney
who is used to penny river steam-boats, such a fare for forty miles or
so may seem a little high; but the cockney should remember that the
boatmen have to row their craft back against stream for every fare
they take; and as there are no locks, the current runs in some spots at
a toughish pace to tug against. -
“The Thames is a pretty enough river to pull down, and about
Cliefden especially its scenery is lovely. But there is no view on the
Thames that the Wye does not eclipse, and its beauties are not merely
varied but continuous. You may travel down the Rhine and not see
bolder cliffs than on the Wye at Symon's Yat, where you will be told to
land and climb up to the top, or in other words to the mast-head of the
Yat. Who this SYMon was, and! why he called this cliff his Yat, I
have not the slightest notion; but he was not a SIMPLE SYMon if he
pic-nicked on his Yat, for a lovelier view to look at through a bumper
of champagne I have rarely been delighted by... I don't myself much
relish peeping over precipices, but if f had not felt an objection to the
risk of breaking my neck, I might have looked down perpendicularly
some six hundred feet or so, and seen the river flowing close on either
side of me. Gutta cavat lapidem, and perhaps some day the Wye may
run straight through the Yat, instead of going out of its course some
distance to get round it, as a glib barrister does sometimes to get round
a point of law. A remarkably good echo lives just º: the Yat,
and when I asked it “How's your mother?” and ‘Where are you
going on Sunday?’ which two romantic questions were inspired by the
romantic nature of the place, I had the satisfaction of eliciting some
local information on the subject from an ingenuous young clodhopper
who was in the fields beneath. - -
“Our yatting ºf...; over, we resumed our boating one, but
though we passed a lot of rapids our pace was not a fast one, You see,
good scenery prevents one from pulling a good oar, and when one is
rowing on a fine day down a river like the Wye one feels inclined to
lazyfaire like the Naples lazyroni. * to see our Paterfamilias
serenely lolling on the stern cushions, and like the Jolly Young Water-
man, ‘rowed along thinking of nothing at all” (except keeping his pipe
alight), was quite enough to paralyse the muscles of his oarsmen, one
of whom especially seemed glad of any excuse for imitating his tranquil-
lity. But we reached Chepstow at length, and then of course went up
to Wyndcliff, of which no doubt you’ve heard, and know is well worth
ing to. The point from which to see the view being on the DUKE of
EAuroRT's property, the Duke ‘expects” a sixpence from you (which
you pay quite willingly), as a largess to his servants who keep the paths
in order for you. But when you have panted to the top, you have your
remaining breath taken away from you by finding the Duke's tenant
‘expects” an extra three-pence, for doing nothing save abstaining from
doing something that might stop you from enjoyment of the view. To
find Nature made a peepshow of is not the pleasantest discovery: but
when you’ve had your grumble, you will, I think, allow that your nine-
pennyworth of landscape is really worth the º: Close in the fore-
ground and, as my guide-book finely phrases it," clasped in the winding
river's arms, is the peninsula of Llancaut,” which is noticeable chiefly
for the fact that at its parish church the service is performed once only
in three weeks. To compensate perhaps for this in ... of º:
ing, the rocks projecting opposite are called the Twelve Apostles (we
counted up fourteen of them, and so named two Paul and Barnabas),
while a pinnacle near Tintern has been termed the Devil's Pulpit. If
one could have the Wyndcliff view to look at while one shaves, one
would not so much abhor, that painful operation. As for trying to
describe it, I leave that to the writer of the guide-book. I have quoted,
and I hope you will admire the profanity and snobbishness with which
his sketch concludes:–
“The spectator stands upon the edge of a precipice, the depth of which is most
awful (!), and the river winds at his feet. The right side screen is Piercefield ridge,
richly wooded; the left is a belt of rocks, over which appear the Severn, and the
fine shores between Thornbury and Bristol, rising behind each other in admirable
swells (!) which unite in most graceful curves. The first foreground is to the eye a
view from the clouds upon earth (!), and the rich contrast of green meadows to wild
forest scenery. The farm of Llancaut clasped in the arms of the winding river,
backed by hanging wood and rock. Thus there is a bay of verdure, walled in by
Nature's colossal fences (!) wood, hill, and rock. * * On the undergrounds herds
of cattle, browsing in silent melancholy(), some laving in the water, others retiring
to sheltered banks. * * The further horn of the Crescent tapers off into a craggy
informal mole, over which the eye passes to the second bay. This terminates in
Chepstow Castle, the town and the rocks beyond all mellowed down by distance
into that fine hazy indistinctness which makes even deformities combine in har-
mony with the picture (!). In the middle distance the widening sea spreads itself,
and from it the shores of Somerset and Monmouthshire steal away into the horizon.
Lastly, all this union of large and bold objects, from being comprised within a cir-
cumference of a very few miles, unites the landscape and the prospect, together
with the forest and the park character, of unimpeded expanse ; for the enclosures
are few in any part, and by distance are almost diminished into imperceptible
streaks. Thus the reproach of mappishness does not attach to this exalted exhi-
bition of the divine taste (!!!).”
“I am not a sentimental journeyer, and so, despite the elegant pre-
diction of the guide-book, the Wyndcliff view did not excite in me “an
involuntary start of astonishment,’ nor did it “elevate my mind into
instantaneous rapture. Enough to feel it is a fitting climax to the beau-
ties of the Wye, and I hope that my mind's eye may long find pleasure
in a look at it. Another view we had, however, which, I rather think,
will live still longer in my memory, and this was Tintern Abbey as seen
by a cigar-light ! Whoe'er would Tintern view aright must visit it by
pale moonlight: but unluckily it happened that the moon was not shining
on the night when we were there, so as we couldn’t get the moonlight,
we tried the substitute of match-light, and admired º: fine old ruin by
the aid of a fusee. , You can fancy how the grandeur of the venerable
Abbey was enhanced by this ingenious device in pyrotechnics, and what
sublime emotions were evoked by the effect.
“Some people say that England has no scenery worth seeing, while
others when they travel only travel for excitement in the way of risking
life by scaling breakneck precipices, or scrambling over ice chasms
where a slip is certain death. Now, were a cockney tourist, not being
a good boatman, to try a passage down the Wye in a wager-boat or
coracle, he would see much pleasant scenery without much fear of
drowning, and yet with quite sufficient danger just to stimulate his
nerves. So recommending this excursion to all those who feel inclined
for it, believe me, my dear Punch,
“Yours, ever so much, -- ->
... “WYE-ATOR.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENGLAND’S NEUTRALITY.
A Parliamentary Debate, with Notes, by a Confederate Reporter.
ALLye who with credulity the whispers hear of fancy,
Or yet pursue with eagerness hope's wild extravagancy, -
Who dream that England soon will drop her long miscalled Neutrality,
And give us with a hearty shake the hands of nationality;
Read, while we give, with little fault of statement or omission,
The next debate in Parliament on Southern Recognition;
They’re all so much alike, indeed, that one can write it off, I see,
As truly as the Times Report without the gift of prophecy.
Not yet, not yet to interfere does England see occasion,
But treats our good Commissioner with coolness and evasion,
Such coolness in the premises that really ’tis refrigerant
To think that two long years ago she called us a belligerent.
But further Downing Street is dumb, the PREMIER deaf to reason,
As deaf as is the Morning Post, both in and out of season;
The working men of Lancashire are all reduced to beggary,
And yet they will not listen unto ROEBUCK or to GREGoRY:
“Or any other man” º who counsels interfering,
While all who speak on t'other side obtain a ready hearing;
As, par eremple, MR. BRIGHT, that pink of all propriety,
That meek and mild disciple of the blessed Peace Society.
-- Why, let ’em fight,” says MR. BRIGHT, “these Southermers, I hate
Cin.
And hope the Black Republicans will soon exterminate’em;
If Freedom, can’t Rebellion crush, pray tell me what’s the use of
And so he chuckles o'er the fray as gleefully as Lucifer.
Enough of him—an abler man demands our close attention,"
The Maximus Apollo of strict Non-Intervention;
With pitiless severity, though decorous and calm histone,
Thus speaks the “old man eloquent,” the puissant EARL of PALMERSTON: C
“What º the land run red with blood, what though the lurid
asiles
Of cannon light, at dead of night, a mournful heap of ashes,
Where many an ancient mansion stood—what though the robber pillages
The sacred home, the house of God, in twice a hundred villages—
“What though a fiendish, nameless wrong, that makes revenge a
uty,
Is daily done” (O Lord, how long?)." to tenderness and beauty P*
(And who shall tell, this deed of hell, how deadlier far a curse it is
Than even pulling temples down and burning Universities?)
* Let Arts decay, let millions fall, for aye let Freedom perish,
With all that in the Western world men fain would love and cherish,
Let Universal Ruin there become a sad reality, -
We cannot swerve, we must preserve our rigorous neutrality.”
Oh, PAM 1 oh, PAM 1 hast ever read what’s writ in * º:
How Blessed the Peace-Makers are, God's Children of t -
Perhaps you think the promise sweet was nothing but a platitude,
*Tis clear that you have no concern in that Divine beatitude.
But “hear! hear ! hear!” another peer, that mighty man of muscle,
Is on his legs, a hearing begs, the noble EARL of Russell;
Thus might he speak, did not of speech his shrewd reserve the folly
See, -
And thus unfold the subtle plan of England's secret policy:-
“JoHN BRIGHT was right, yes, let’em fight, these fools across the water,
*Tis no affair at all of ours, their Carnival of slaughter;
The Christian world, indeed, may say we ought not to allow it, Sirs,
But still 'tis music in our ears, this roar of Yankee howitzers.
“A word or two of gº; that costs us not a penny,
We give the gallant Southerners, the ſew against the many,
We say their noble ſortitude of final triumph presages, .
And praise in Blackwood's Magazine JEFF DAVIS and his Messages—
“Of course we claim the shining fame of glorious STONEwALL Jackson,
Who typifies the English race, a sterling Anglo-Saxon;
To bravest song his deeds belong, to Clio and Melpomene”—
(And why not for a British stream demand the Chickahominy ?)
“But for the cause in which he fell we cannot liſt a finger,
*Tis idle on the question any longer here to linger; -
*Tis true the South has freely bled, her sorrows are Homeric, oh,
Her case is like to his of old who journeyed unto Jericho-
“The thieves have stripped and bruised, although as yet they have not
bound her,
We’d like to see her slay'em all to right and left around her,
We shouldn't cry in Parliament if LEE should cross the Raritan,
But England never yet was known to play the Good Samaritan.
...And so we pass the other side, and leave them to their glory,
Tº give new proofs of manliness, new scenes for song and story:
These honeyed words of compliment may possibly bamboozle 'em,
But ere we intervene, you know, we’ll see 'em in-Jerusalem.
...Yes, let ’em fight till both are brought to hopeless desolation,
Till wolves troop round the cottage door in one and 'tother nation;
Till worn and broken down the South shall prove no more refractory,
And rust eats up the silent looms in every Yankee factory:
Till bursts no more the cotton boll o'er fields of Carolina,
And fills with snowy flosses the dusky hands of DINAH;
Till war has dealt its final blow and MR. Seward's knavery
Has put an end in all the land to Freedom and to Slavery.
...The grim Bastille, the rack, the wheel, without remorse or pity,
May flourish with the guillotine in every Yankee City,
No matter should Old Abe revive the brazen bull of Phalaris,
'Tis no concern at all of ours,” (Sensation in the galleries)–
“So shall our ‘Merry England’ thrive on transatlantic troubles,
While India on her distant plains her crop of cotton doubles;
And so as long as North or South shall show the least vitality
We cannot swerve, we must preserve our rigorous neutrality.”
-Your speech, my Lord, might well become a Saxon legislator,
When the “fine old English gentlemen” lived in a state of natur’—
When Vikings quaffed from human sculls their fiery draughts of honey.
mead,
Long, long before the Barons bold met tyrant John at Runnymede.
But 'tis a speech so plain, my Lord, that all may understand it,
And so we quickly turn to fight again the Yankee bandit,
ºnvinced that we shall fairly win at last our nationality,
Without the help of Britain's arm, in spite of her Neutrality!
*.*. Mr. Punch has inserted the preceding lines from a Secesh Corre-
gº. as “a few straws to show which way the wind blows” in the
Oulull.
MAGISTRATES AND MUSHROOMS.
..THERE are some Magistrates who do not know how to enforce the
rights of property; others who do. . Among the latter must decidedly
be included the gentlemen named in the subjoined extract from the
Manchester Guardian:-
“PENALTTEs For TRESPAss AT PREston.—On Saturday, at the County Police
Court, Preston, before MEssrs. C. R. JAcson, R. Oliverson, and PETER CATTERALL,
a man named William WALMsley, was summoned for trespassing on some land in
Fishwick, and doing damage to the amount of one penny. In reply to the Bench,
the defendant said he had done no damage.—He was fined half-a-crown and costs,
ordered to pay the damage, and in default, one month's imprisonment in the House
of Correction.—Afterwards, a man, named Roger Hothers ALL, was charged with
being in the same field, and doing damage to the extent of one penny.—Defendant.
I plead guilty. I hope you will be as merciful as you can. I am a labourer, and
work for the Guardians, on the Cattle Market.—The Chairman. Well, but you know
land must be protected.—Defendant. I'm sorry. I hope you will be lenient. 1
§ earn a shilling a day, and out of that have to keep myself, my wife, and two
little children. I can't pay any fine.—The Bench. What were you doing in the
field?-Defendant. Well, I had gone to get a few mushrooms for our dinner.—The
Bench. You are fined half-a-crown and costs; you must also pay the damage;
and, in default, you must go to the House of Correction for a month.-Defendant.
Well, I can't pay, gentlemen.—He was then removed to one of the cells.”
Here is a malefactor who, merely to get a few mushrooms for his
dinner, does not hesitate to trespass on another man's land, and do
damage to the amount of one penny!, His only excuse for this act of
º is, that, having a wife and two children to keep, he earns
only one shilling a day ! It is very dangerous to allow the poorer
classes to trespass on the fields in order to get mushrooms to eke out
their meals. There are lots of other fungi that the poor might eat, and
when they find that out they will commit farther trespasses to procure
them, and do damage to the value thereof; more than a penny. This
trespassing in search of toadstools must be knocked on the head; and
now that waste lands are everywhere getting enclosed and appropriated,
there is no finding j. without trespassing. Let wretches be
taught to keep in the turnpike roads, and out of the fields at all times
except when they are employed to labour in them. We can enter into
the feelings of the Preston Bench, who, when they sent the penny
trespasser, HoTHERSALL, to the House of Correction, may perhaps have
regretted that they could not order him to be whipped. Don't their
Worships know how to deal with distress in Lancashire?

STORY OF A LITTLE SOWEREIGN IN THE SULKS.
The Bad Boy that wouldn't come in.
ONCE upon a time there was a wilful boy who belonged to a German
band, in which he blew his own trumpet, and made ſº discord. He
never would play in tune. Some suspected that he had no ear, others
winking slily insinuated that his ears were egregiously long, certain it
is, that although he was no composer, he gave himself airs, and offended
many people by his crotchets. Every one looked with derision on the
trumpet, which the presumptuous PRussiaN blew; and while admitting
that he had a thorough base organ, without hesitation declared that he
was always a little flat.
MASTER KAISER, who led the German band, was at one period avery
indifferent performer, but had lately rather improved in his play. He
had just left school, and was pretty well up in geography, clearly un-
derstanding how the revolutions of the arth are influenced by the
poles. One day MASTER KAISER, seeing that clouds were ††
and being apprehensive of a storm, proposed that the Band sho d
subscribe and buy a big umbrella for their common protection from any
overpowering rain. To this proposal all the German Band with one or
two exceptions, joyfully assented: The little bumptious trumpeter,
however, turned upon his heel, and sulkily hugging himself beneath an
old-fashioned court, rejected the overtures of his playmates, and insisted
on standing out. Little MASTERSAxony, in his best suit, went to him

HOW, WHEN, AND WHERE P
OR, THE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
N. referring to our
skeleton route, No.
2, the tourist staying
at , Boulogne will
find that he ought
to have commenced
with Amsterdam.
If, however, there
be ladies in , this
party, he will have
acted with touching
delicacy in avoiding
a place whose name
S. possesses so profane
a termination. We
will therefore for the
... * at
oulogne and give
a few broad pieces
of advice upon which
4 the Traveller may
or may not act as he
thinks proper.
Never, go to a
foreign barber's in
order to get shaved.
The very evident
reason for this is
that, when abroad,
it is always remarkably unpleasant to get into a scrape.
You will of course frequent a ‘. uring the daytime. Now these
places are of two sorts: there is the Café Gnaw, which is as the name
implies (very like English by the way, eh?) entirely ſor eating, and the
Café oh Lay, where, as may be gathered from the title, you lay yourself
down and devote the time to drinking. , The proprietors of either place
do not interfere with one another, and business is thus carried on upon
the most amicable principles. -
If you do not understand the language, always on taking your seat
at a Café, amuse yourself with the contents of a French newspaper.
In this case, no article however bitter will disturb you, and you have
the advantage over other people in being able to read it sideways or
upside down with equal gratification.
You will notice that when foreigners have finished their little cup of
coffee, they invariably empty the contents of the sugar-basin into their
pockets. As it is always well for a visitor to be more French than
a native, you should not confine yourself to the sugar, but appropriate
the spoon, cup, saucer, plate, or tººl. that suits your fancy, and
is adapted to the meanest º:# of the pocket. Always go to the
best hotel; of course, you will be obliged to try several before
ascertaining which is the one that can fairly claim the honourable
distinction. -
In many places you will be told that the waiters “speak English.”
So they may, but they probably don’t understand it.
We once heard a wet tourist, on arriving in steaming haste at an
hotel where “English was spoken,” cry out to the waiter as, he was
hurrying to his room, “Waiter, bring me some hot water;” where-
upon the intelligent garçon readii answered, “Leg of mut-ton, yaas
sare,”--and he smiled cheerfully, being evidently highly pleased
with this ingenious interpretation of the visitor's wish. TYou should
have a few sentences always in stock; first, for instance on entering
the hotel: Avay voo day shombrº this means “Got any rooms?” But
mind you do say this before the Landlord or Boots, or anyone else
has the chance of addressing you; as they may make some remark
which you don’t understand, and which will utterly overthrow any
scheme for a French dialogue that you may have previously formed.
In order not to be thrown out, you must force his reply with your
question, and should the former not be the one required, pretend to
blow your nose, feign a sneeze, or a cough, which would of course
prevent3. catching what he said, and then return to your own pre-
arranged conversation.
On entering your apartment immediately take up the carpet, if there
is one, and order the dust to be swept away.
To avoid the º of that useless form of regret, commencing
with the phrase “I wish I’d brought (whateverit-may-be) with me,”
we will here give a list of actual necessaries, which you should have
about you, as few rooms ab possess them., Seldom, for instance,
will you find shutters to the windows: provide yourself with these.
See also that you do not travel without—
20 Pegs for coats, dressing-gowns, Ladies' gowns, &c.
2 Wenetian blinds,
1 Wardrobe.
1 Chamber-pail for slops,
1 Cheval glass,
2 Pairs .#Snuffers,
Bell.
Several different kinds of soap, and baths for hot or cold water,
which you can turn to account by letting out to brother or sister
Tourists who have forgotten to bring them. You will find the beds
small and comfortable; and if otherwise, they will do for a mere night
shift very well. A couch three feet wide may sometimes serve your
turn, but when you do turn, you should, like the late DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON, turn out.
Now let us say that you’ve prepared your sentences, according to
the plan contained in this Guide, and you ring your bell in order to
summon the garçon. You must ring as a rule several times, but do not
be afraid of a multitude of servants being attracted thereby; though it
would properly follow, that if the ringing of one bell resulted in
one servant, the consequence of two bells would be two servants, three
bells three, and so on. Such, however, is not the case. The servants
will be a long time before they reply to your summons. This you must
expect, remembering that as–Time is made for Slaves, they of course
have a perfect right to take as much of it as they like.
Now let the Tourist open his eyes and be taken aback, almost aback
to England by the information, that, in almost all parts of France,
every chambermaid is a Man. The only place where we ever heard of
anything like a real English chambermaid, was at the Railway Station,
when a guard directed us to the Salle d'Attente which so many travel.
lers, in common with ourselves, have mistaken for “SARAH or SAL
the Attentive,” but which turns out to be the Waiting Room ' Yet it
is to such impositions that the English uncomplainingly subject them-
selves upon the Continent. The word Continent must, when you are
travelling, be pronounced Continong, or you’ll display an amount of
ignorance not to be tolerated in an enlightened Briton. Do not forget
this, but you need not give your authority.
What shall we do to-day? Why you must look at some list of enter-
tainments, and you will probably find that the places of amusement for
day-visitors are the Burial Grounds, the Hospital for Incurables, the
Maison de Santé, the Prison, and the Police Station, &c. &c.
There is always a Church and a Church Tower to be seen. From top
of the latter you will have a splendid view; but before the aspiring
jºr can go up lightly he will be forced to come down pretty
eavily.
Before quitting Boulogne we would remind' our readers not to forget
to ask after the notorious, Bore de Boulogne. He became such a
social nuisance as to be ultimately sent to Paris, where he is now
located.

Matter-horn at once.
“Note.—Whenever you wish to take an airing, and there is no other vehicle to be had

STARTLING TRADE INTELLIGENCE.
SoME Frenchmen still believe that we sell our
wives in Smithfield, but it may startle them to
learn by the following advertisement that other
human sales are occasionally held here:-
O FANCY STATIONERS and Others.-One
and a half mile from Lambeth Bridge.—To Clerks
and Others.-Mr. P- is instructed to SELL a FANCY
STATIONERY TRADE, together with a Public Library
and a Dealer in Pianofortes.—About £120 required.—
Apply, &c.
“Together with a public library and a dealer
in piano-fortes!” Tenez, mow ami Gobemouche,
qu'ils sont betes ces Anglais / que c'est inhumaine,
sauvage, cette affreuse Angleterre / Figure to
yourself, my friend, the sale of this poor wretched
dealer in pianos, and imagine what a glut there
must be in our man-market when a shopkeeper,
a library, and a stationery business are together
to be sold for “about £120.”
AN IMPOSSIBLE PANCAKE.
ExAMINED as a witness in an action relative
to a play called the Relief of Lucknow, involving
the question of its original authorship, Mr.
EDWARD STIRLING, Stage Manager of Drury
Lane Theatre, is reported to have said:—
“He had only read the plaintiff's drama cursorily, and
he did not discover that the two comic characters in it
had been rolled into one comic Irishman in MR. Bouci-
CAULT's piece.”
So one would think. If two comic characters
had been rolled into one comic Irishman. that
º Irishman would have been dreadfully
at. T,
SABBATARIAN STOCKS.
THE Sabbatarian Act of CHARLEs THE SEgoND excludes from its
operation all works of necessity. If a Bench of profane cynics wished
to insult Christianity, and at the same time exceed the law, they might,
for an impious freak, commit a wayfarer for plucking.and eating ears
of corn upon the Sabbath Day. What is the essential difference between
lucking corn to eat, and doing the act undermentioned in an extract
rom the Manchester Examiner and Times f-
“The piety of Petty Sessions has been set in a striking light at Atherton by the
conviction of fourteen persons on the charge of having desecrated the Lord's day.
The principal defendant was a man named CLEwokTH, a farmer apparently, who,
having a meadow of hay ready for carrying, and being apprehensive from the state
of the weather that if the carrying were deferred till the next day the hay would all
§: spoilt, called his workmen and neighbours together, and housed it on the
unday.”
The case had been adjourned for a month to enable the Magistrates
to consider the law on the subject; and they “concluded” as PRESI-
pent LINcoLN would say, and declared by the mouth of their Chairman,
MR. SILyEstER, that “the defendants were guilty of a desecration of
the Lord's Day,” and fined them 5s, and costs. We wish we had heard
how the Justice who pronounced his judgment, managed the pronuncia-
tion of two particular words in it, name {: those above quoted, which
he substituted for Sunday. Considering those two words in that relation
to ears of corn which the matter in question must naturally have sug-
fº. tºld his Worship utter them without thrusting his tongue in
s cineek i
The defendants in this case were MR. PETER CLEworth, farmer,
of Leigh, and thirteen others, some of them labouring men. They
refused to pay the fine, and, says our Manchester contemporary,
"it is understood that distress warrants will be issued against those
lºº who are householders, and the others will be confined in the
stocks.”
Now, then, if these men are “confined in the stocks” what will the
Home Secretary do? Will SIR GEORGE GREY order stocks to be set
up in Hyde Park, and direct the stipendiary Magistrates of London to
enforce the Sunday Act of CHARLEs, the Second by sentencing all
insolvent offenders against it to be set in them? Or will he remove
§: gentlemen of the Atherton Bench from the Commission of the
eace
We do not for one moment believe that these gentlemen have any
wish whatever, to bring religion into contempt. Indeed we are per:
suaded that they have not the faintest perception of the tendency of
their Sabbatarian maladministration of justice to do so. We are satisfied
that they are sincere Sabbatarians. We are quite sure that they cannot
see the argument, that it is as right to save provender from being
spoiled on the Sabbath day as it is to extricate an ass from a pit.
Exactly so. But now we have just named an animal of which we will
say no more than that its species ought not to occupy the Bench at
Petty Sessions.
LNCERTAINTY OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
“MR. Punch, . -
“THERE is a º: that you ought not to believe above half
of what you hear, and I think it is too. true. Nay, I É. further, and
say that, if you are wise, you won't believe anything whatever that is
extraordina: . It is very seldom that extraordinary things do happen,
and, in disbe .# them when they are related, you will be right nine
times out of ten, if not oſtener. Every time that you are right, you
will gain credit for good sense; and if you do chance ever to be wrong
your mistake will be looked upon as an error on the side of judgment.
“There, are some things that are generally received as facts, but
which really I don’t believe in, and feel that if they were siſted they
would turn out to be all moonshine. I mean such things as earth-
quakes and burning mountains, which never occur and do not exist in
this country. , I never was out of England, and do not mean ever to go,
but 1 cannot believe that prodigies and convulsions of nature, unknown
in this land, are experienced in any other. It is my firm opinion that
Vesuvius and Etna are all humbug. The alleged Earthquake of Lisbon
Iſregard as a mere fable, and have no more faith in that which is repre-
sented to have taken place at Manilla the other day. I have the same
idea of tremendous hail-storms and thunder-storms, such as are con-
tinually reported as occurring in foreign parts, but the like of which we
never witness. Now, for example, the Courrier du Bas Rhin, I see,
quoted by one of our own papers, states that, within the last few days,
violent storms have prevailed in the valley of the Rhine, by which con-
siderable damage has been caused. Well, I can believe so much, but
when the writer of it goes on to say:—
“In the palatinate the hailstones were in some places of the size of pigeons' eggs."

declare that:—

were broken. Near Coblentz the fields were strewed with birds killed by the hail,
and a similar fact is mentioned as having occurred in the neighbourhood of Stras-
bourg. A violent hurricane, accompanied by lightning and torrents of rain, broke
over the town of Mâcon (Saône-et-Loire) three days ago, and caused great damage,
The church steeple was thrown down, several houses stripped of their roofs, and
the produce of the gardens in many places destroyed.”
“Beyond the possible fact that a storm occurred at the places above
mentioned, and did some damage, I am satisfied that most if not all of
the particulars in the foregoing statement are fudge. I cannot swallow
hailstones as big as pigeons' eyes, and lumps of ice falling and breaking
tiles. Twould be bound to eat all the birds which the fields were ever
strewed with and which were killed by the hail. I won't absolutely
deny that the church steeple at Mâcon was thrown down, because that
of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields was struck by lightning some years ago,
and in part fell; but I very much; doubt it. That any of the houses,
however, were stripped of their roofs is what I don't attach the slightest
credit to. To º a little Irish, I look upon all foreigners as natives.
They are given to wear ear-rings and trinkets of the nature of amulets
and charms; they have crosses buried with them, and so forth. In all
this there is a spice of fetichism. They are eaten up with credulity,
and abandoned to delusion, which is in a measure contagious, so as
more or less to infect even British travellers, and cause them to exag-
gerate what they have seen. Thus we may fully account for everything
in any of their narratives that is at all wonderful. I dare say, if the
truth were known, the American war and the Insurrection in Poland
would turn out to be very small affairs in comparison with the fuss
which is made about them. Things that we hear of a long way off are
as doubtful as things dated a long time ago.
“Foreigners, in short, are not to be depended upon. Such is the
uncertainty of foreign affairs that we can never know what we are
doing when we mix ourselves up with them; which we should on no
account ever do unless for the protection of four interests, when they
appear to be threatened. The bounds of probability are those of this
island; exceed them and you get into the domains of Baron Munchausen.
Events º: from beyond the seas are mostly fit to be related only
to the Marines. Some may call this marrow-minded scepticism,
Mr. Punch; but I will maintain that it is the philosophy of a
“Bull’s Close, Sept., 1863.” “TRUE BRITON.”
“P.S.. I am no cosmopolite.”

An Old Story.
JUDGEs and Barristers are now reduced to mere shadows, and the
columns...of the Reports are almost, empty. There have been lately
several “Running down” cases. This name is only, applied by laics
to a species, of litigation, which the lawyers call “Running up
cases,” but this name refers to the Bill of Costs, whose length is only
exceeded by that of the client's face, when he casts his eye over the
little account.
MISSIONARY MEDDLERS AT CROYDON.
WE have noticed with disgust, in the columns of a local contem-
porary, the report of a too successful attempt to oppose the establish-
ment of an institution calculated to supersede animal gratification by
moral and intellectual culture at Croydon. A benefactor of his species,
MR.W. T. SIMPson, late of Drury Lane, the Lyce and Sadler's
Wells, has been attempting to introduce dramatic performances in a
portable theatre at Pitlake, Croydon. The magistrates are xi.; to
i. him permission to open it, 3. are for the present prevented from
oing so by the vexatious opposition of certain persons unknown, but
supposed to be sanctimonious impostors. MR. SIMPson, to meet the
wishes of some of his friends, has gone to the expense of removing his
theatre from the spot on which he had erected it to an adjoining site.
He had previously given the Bench the fourteen days' notice of applica-
tion for a licence, required by law. At the end of the fortnight, on
Saturday week last, the application was made by his solicitor, MR.
C. RichańDs. It was backed by a memorial signed by º: of 300
inhabitants of the neighbourhood, but opposed by somebody or other
represented by MR. PARRY. The fact of the removal of the theatre-
only a few yards from its original site—then ºf. to be mentioned.
An extract from the report of the case, which follows, will best explain
the hardship thereof:-
“MR. PARRY thereupon objected to the former notice, which was for a building
then in existence, which had since been pulled down and erected in another place,
therefore he contended that another notice was necessary.
“MR. RICHARDs contended that the notice given specifiedall that was requisite for
granting the licence for the present theatre. It was the same building exactly, and
had only been removed a short distance.
“The Chairman said he could not altogether agree with MR. RICHARDs. He
asked MR. PARRY whom he appeared for, and was surprised that MR. RICHARDs had
not asked that question before.
“MR. PARRY. I decline to say who I
“The Chairman. Perhaps you ap or yourself?
“MR. PARRY. No; I appear for MR. BENNET and MR. TAYLon, a city missionary
who has addressed a fº y communication to the Magistrates, but it was sent, as
I am instructed, to MR. W. DRUMMond.
“MR. J. DRUMMOND said his brother had been absent from Croydon, but during
his absence he had opened all his letters, and could undertake to say that no such
letter as that described by MR. PARRY had been delivered.
“After a short consultation, the Chairman said they considered MR. PARRY's
objection a valid one. They were sorry that MR. SIMPson had been put to so much
inconvenience and expense, but they could not help him.”
º: for.
It appears that MR. PARRY's clients, whoever they are, misinstructed
him. Gentlemen who are capable of doing that, are likely to go by an
alias, and it may be that the City Missionary and the other person
who employed that attorney to oppose MR. SIMPson's licence, may not
have favoured him with their real names, from a natural fear of
incurring Fºl. execration. MR. SIMPson's application, for , a
licence will be renewed, on Saturday week and will doubtless be
granted. In compliment to his pious persecutors, and any confederates
whom they may be leagued with at Č. be should by all means
open his house with The Hypocrite. We wonder if his company con-
tains a couple of actors capable of playing Cantwell and Mateworm
as well as the City Missionary and his other persecutor doubtless
perform those parts off the stage.

“How happy could I be with heather,” is now the sportsman's song. Your Umbra, or

wet day’s sport would not have been accepted. We had a very pleasant time of it, and after
shooting during the morning and afternoon, in the evening we were treated to some appro-
priate LoDER's music. Some of our party are off to the Moors, deer stalking of course;
for our part we prefer to remain in-doors with the ladies, and enjoy our little dears talking
at home. By the way, there are no Moors at the Alhambra, so don't let the name lead astray

“Over” has been virtually shouted out by all the umpires, to the Cricket Season. We
are afraid that the Quidnuncs and Sussex men who played such a first-rate match a week
or so ago at Brighton, have met there for the last time. We do not wish to frighten any
bold Batsman, but being the other day in the neighbourhood of Hove, we met the Excellent
2–~ ||
Proprietor in mourning, and we subsequently
eard from several players that “the Brighton
Ground was Dead!” There it lies beneath its
own turf, deeply respected by all who knew it.
We were further informed that it was prºpºsed to
º an epitaph over it commencing “Tellus—,”
ut at this point our feelings overcame us (they
often do), and exclaiming “Don’t tell us!” we
rushed off in the opposite direction. We believe,
however, that the Sussex men are going to raze
a subscription to the Ground. Several Cricket
fields have been much cut up in consequence of
this º event.
How marvellous, are the changes of fortune;
we are here yesterday and gone the day before,
and we know not what may happen in the
course of the following Tuesday. The poor beggar
to-day, is the rich beggar to-morrow, and this
reminds us of what we were going to say. A cer-
tain gentleman professionally connected with the
ring, which is always a prize and no blank,
opened a neat hostelrie, and established a pit
where ratting sports were the order of the day
and night., Crowds frequented the aristocratic
retreat, and fondled the little dog, a terrier, who
laughed to see such sport. This enterprisin
owner has made a fortune, and having marrie
a tailor's fair daughter, may now be seen in the
Park driving a pair of handsome clothes-horses,
presented by his father-in-law, and seated in a
neatly appointed rat-trap, which his own genius
has procured for him.

A TERRIBLE ASSAULT.
WHAT a horribly savage country is this England, to be sure! What
brutally aggressive ruffians are allowed to be at large in it ! ...Only look,
Ma'am, at this awfully atrocious case reported a short while since in
the Western Times:—
“WOODBURY PETTY SESSIONS.
“WILLIAM BUDD, an elderly labouring man, was summoned for using threaten-
#. lºgº towards the Honourable LADY GERTRUDE Rolle, and putting her in
ily lear.
“Her Ladyship stated as follows:—I saw the defendant on the 31st of July last,
between six and seven o'clock in the evening, on Colyton Common, in the parish of
Colyton Raleigh, cutting turf. I was walking 15 or 20 yards off. I heard a voice
calling after me, but I did not think anything of it, till a young lady who was with
me, said he was speaking to me. I {. round and asked the man what he
wanted, when he called out in loud tones, “I want some cider, you had best not
deny me. Come on, come on.' He said this in a very threatening manner, and
held up his fists at the same time (here her ladyship suiting the action to the word,
threw down her parasol, and compressing her face, and shaking her fists, she en-
deavoured to imitate the old man's conduct). * * * He walked two or three
paces forward and then went back again, and I went on my way, but I was as much
frightened as if a pistol had been let off at my head.”
In palliation of his frightful conduct the audacious hardened mis-
creant (who was described by one of the witnesses, who had known him
many years, as being, an “industrious, sober, honest man”) had the
impudence to state, through the lawyer who defended him, that he had
mistaken LADY Route and her companions for three lace girls, and had
offered them a drink of cider, which offer they mistook for his having
asked for some ! When afterwards he found out whom he had accosted
he was frightened out of his wits at having taken such a liberty, and
her Ladyship confessed in her cross—yes, very cross-examination—
that—
“When the defendant found out that I was LADY Rolle he was very sorry,
because he knew he would get the worst of it. He came a few days afterwards to

DARE you, little EARL Jack,
To give HUDsoN the sack,
For the work he has done long and well
And, that you, in his post
May put one of the host

Will immensely exceed
The expression of famed SIDNEY SMITH.
It must greatly surpass
All the valour of brass,
If you thus can preſer kin and kith.

To give nephew a berth,

No; you can't be so bold and so base.
SAVAGES ON THE COAST OF KENT.
BRIGHTON at this season may be said to be crammed,
not to say replete, with beauty. Naturally so. Brighton
is a bathing-place; so is Ramsgate: so is Margate. But
the authorities at Brighton have made calecons indis-
pensable, or de rigueur as the genteel say. At Margate
and Ramsgate, however, bathers are allowed to crowd the
coast in a state of native innocence more perfect than that
in which the men of Kent rejoiced when they went about
in a coat of woad of a very partial nature, and nothing
corresponding to “Sydenham 17s. 6d.,” except a patch of
colour which may have occupied the place of those figures
in the well-known advertisement. The consequence has
been that no young lady of any pretensions to refinement
can even mention Ramsgate or Margate. That those
watering-places may enjoy their ſair share of the beauty, and
the business, now engrossed by Brighton, it is necessary
that, local self-government should subject bathing to those
ymnastic * - - - - - -
conditions which are prescribed by civilisation.
one that she experienced, and they will regret to learn the case was
after all dismissed, on the ground that the complainant was not in
bodily fear. But though her shattered nerves afflict us with the very
deepest sympathy, we fear we must allow that this decision was a just
one, for there was certainly no ground to think the insult was inten-
tional. If fine ladies would but condescend to talk a little oftener to
the labourers they meet, they would not be terrified at hearing some
six words from them.
IS MONTALEMBERT A HERETICP
AIL honour to M. DE Most ALEMBERT for the courageous avowal, in
the face of his priesthood at Malines, of the justice and common sense
thus eloquently outspoken:-
“Without mental reservation and without hesitation, I declare myself an upholder
of liberty of conscience. . . The gag forced into the mouth of whomsoever lifts
up his voice with a pure heart to preach his faith, that gag I feel between my own
lips, and I shudder with pain.”
Count MonTALEMBERT distinctly contended for the liberty of
preaching error as well as truth. So it will not do for their Ultra-
montane Eminences and, Reverences to say that there is only one faith
that can be preached with a pure heart, and that no pain can possibly
be caused to M. DE MONTALEMBERT by forcing a gag into the mouth
which preaches heretical pravity. - -- ---
But how, then, about that liberty of the Press which Infallibility, late
and present, has so bitterly cursed and condemned in unmistakeable and
undeniable Allocutions? Count Most ALEMBERT and the Holy Father
are at issue. Which is to cry Erraviº. Which will cave in?. As the
liberty of the Press is the matter in question between the most illustrious
champion of the Papacy and the Pope, we will take that liberty to
ſºlº “the quarrel between them is a very pretty quarrel as it
stands.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
How, when AND WHERE P
or, THE MoDERN TourisTs GUIDE To THE CONTINENT.
STANDs for Antwerp, and
therefore We starts for
that place.
As of course you will
have arrived at the quay
er steamer, one or two
ints will save you a vast
amount of trouble. You
will be requested to remu-
nerate the Steward for the
sustenance that you ’ve
consumed during the voy-
age. Economy, mind, is
the first thing to be con-
sidered; reply therefore to
this demand by telling
them confidentially “that
you’ll look in another
time,” or “you'll be
coming that way again in
a few days, and then
you’ll settle your little
account.” If, after getting
over the sea passage, you
can also get over the boat’s
crew, you will be a happy
and a fortunate man. The
vessels where, of all others,
very high prices are
charged for a very low
sort of diet, are, as their
name implies, the Screw
Steamers. The British
stranger will now cast his
eyes (he must not throw
his glances away, as they
will be wanted subse-
quently for several other
parts of the journey where
you must keep your eyes
about you) upon sever
distinguished military-
looking gentlemen, to
whom the untutored impulse would take of its hat, deeming them
to be at least first cousins to general officers. It at first appears that
these exalted per-
sonages have come
on board to wel-

give way to his N
feelings. This con- N
duct will molliſy
the otherwise obdu-
rate hearts of these
Superb Foreigners,
and, on being safely
escorted from the
ship to land, as,
under the circum-
stances you would
doubtlessly be, you
will find that you
have executed that
marvellous gymnas-
tic feat known to
travellers as Clear-
ing the Custom-
house Officers.
Porterage.—Your first care must be to procure a fly, cab, hackney-
coach or omnibus wherein to take yourself and luggage to an hotel.
Stand on the noisy quay, and in a much noisier key shout for a vehicle.
You may shout as long as you like. . There is none. Now then, say,
“Hi! Here! you ſellow !” to one of the gentry idling about the place
in the dress of a Continental butcher out of work. These be the
N
N
ſ
ºA
porters; and if your porter has anything like a head, he will tell you
the best hotel to go to; and thereupon he will put your baggage on to
a truck and *f; away, and you on it into the bargain, if you approve
of that mode of entering the town.
You will probably be taken to the Hotel of St. Antony (not because,
as a feeble creature might say, “there an’t any other,” but because it is
the best), and in order to save all discussion about the fare, hold out
to the conscientious porter a handful of coins, consisting of groschen,
kreutzers, francs, sixpences, florins, dollars and thalers, and let him
select as many of them as may suit his fancy. Don't begin your
journey by quarrelling; but regard, with feelings of unmixed pleasure,
the gratification of this humble son of toil on leaving you at the door
of your hostelrie with one silbergroschen in your hand.
Before we proceed further, it would be well to offer a few remarks
upºn the rate of exchange in the various towns and countries.
The rate of exchange in a fashi Continental town is very rapid.
You are always purchasing something as a keepsake to take home to
FANNY, or somebody else whose name isn't FANNY, as of course there
is no reason why it should be.
Fourpenny bits will pass as ny pieces anywhere. This is
useful and important. Threepenny pieces may, among a quantity of
other money, (when naturally one expects some reduction on taking a
quantity) pass for fourpenny bits; but this is only successful, as a rule,
º: are actually and at the very moment of disbursement, quitting
place.
A farthing well polished and brightenedmay, among the very simple
mountaineers of Switzerland, the Tullaliety and Hilliho sort of people
pass for a sovereign; but most of these mountain passes are attende
with a certain amount of difficulty.
On board ship, or when travelling by tidal service boat, always pay
for your passage with the current coin of the river.
Should you pass through the kingdom of Bohemia, (celebrated for
the beautiful tea called Bohea, whence the name), the following coins
are at present in circulation:-
Bohemian
Bohemia. Relative Walue. Germany. English. French.
Joeys – one Kick = 3; Groschen = Four pennies = 31, cts.
Tizzies, = one Bender = 5 Groschen = Six pennies = 524 cts.
Bobs = two Tizzies=10 Groschen = One shilling = 1 fr. 20cts.
Benders = one Tizzy = 5 Groschen = One sixpence = 528, cts.
Kicks = one Joey = 3; Groschen = One fourpence= 31ſ, cts.
Tanners = one Tizzy 5 Groschen = One sixpence = 52%, cts.
If you carry any change, be careful to take more kicks than halfpence.
You’ll always get them for the asking. In Cologne the cent is chiefly
used. As, however, these are often not punctually paid, the Owe de
Cologne cent, has passed into a proverb, so as to make the place smell
in the nostrils of Tourists. Paper money known as Flimsies and
Bitsostiff are seldom seen in Bohemia; while sous and straw-papers
are common. When a Billet de Banque is unnegotiable everywhere, it
is called a Billet Doo.
Rhino is the general term for all species of coin passing up and down
the romantic river between Cologne and Mayence, and may be termed
the floating capital of Rhenish Prussia. Another example of this
existing fund may be found in the South, where Venice is the floating
capital of Europe. This however by the way, and rather out of our
way at present. In many places Tourists have found brass to be an
excellent substitute for tin. The Cosmopolite should always carry a
plentiful supply of coppers with him, and then he can do all his
“washing” in his own room.
Another point is the computation of distance and the application of
correct measurement to the hiring of vehicles. Mind; when you hire
a voiturier, lower his price. Now it must be taken as a general rule, to
which there are but very few exceptions, that every object when divided
from the traveller by an interval of several miles is further removed
from his particular locality, than is another object which is within a few
feet of his touch. Very good. In the latter case a carriage will not
be required. In the former, let us suppose you’re going to drive to
Darmstadt, which is ten miles off from anywhere you like. Well, if
you know this, all you’ve got to askis, “how much a mile,” and when
the coachman has given you the information, you will have added to
the stock of knowledge which you already possess. You can thank
him for the information and retire. If, however, you are uncertain of
the distance, rise early in the morning, procure a short, or long piece of
tape, go over the ground, cheerfully reflecting the while, that one
day you’ll have to go under it, and measure carefully: this will give
you a nice walk before breakfast, of course to Darmstadt, and then
you’ll be in a position to withstand all attempts at extortion. To
enable you to measure correctly, provide yourself with a Two Foot
RULE of THE Road.
Consideration for those millionnaires who can afford to be carried,
shall not preventus from turning our attention to the poor pedestrians.
General Precautions to be observed by Pedestrians and Others:—
When it rains, let the traveller stop at some inn, on his road, so as
not to get wet;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And, when the warm Sun is shining, let the traveller stop at several
inns on his road, so as not to get dry.
What with our driving and our walking tours, we find ourselves
rapidly leaving Antwerp. We, therefore, if you please, and iſ you don’t
please it can’t be helped, will return to the Hotel of St. Anthony.
On your arrival, let it be your first endeavour to prove to the
as-regards-English-manners-benighted-and-totally-uninstructed citizens,
that you at all events have none of that phlegmatic reserve and dulness
of spirits, which are the characteristics, we hear, of so many of our
travelled countrymen. Proceed thus: never leave off whistling or
singing except when you’re shouting, speaking, laughing, eating or
drinking; this will show lightness of heart and head, innocence of dis-
position, and cheeriness of manner not to be surpassed by the most
volatile of our liveliest neighbours, Get rid of your vigilant, that means
a cabman, when there is one, by giving his horse a sharp cut with the
whip and saying, “Hoop! tehk! come up!” and off he will set, as hard
as he can lay legs to the ground, down the street, and, of course, his
owner after him. Now thenſor a good old practical joke, which how-
ever being quite new here, willestablish your reputation for hilarity from
the very minute of its execution.
Begin thus:–Tell the crowd who are looking on that you’re going
to "play at Pantomimes.” They won’t know what you mean, but that
is of no consequence; and,
by the way, this fact is
equally true as regards the
majority of people who,
during the season, are in-
tensely interested in listen-
ing to the poetical libretto
of an Italian opera. Com-
mence humming,
tum tiddle tiddle,” any
words you like here, to give
the idea of the never ceasing
music in the orchestra at
:* h º:
your open three
at the door of the hotel,
and then lie down flat on
your face in front of it. If
the proprietor is up to the
business (and if not, why
N is he in that situation,
º, we’d like to know?) he will
# wait until after the third
º knock; when he will open
the door, look straight be-
fore him, smile blandly,
rub his hands, and at the
first step of his advance fall
over your prostrate form.
You yourself must be up
on your legs as nimbly as possible, and lose no time in belabouring the
weak-minded tradesman with one of his own advertisement, boards.
When he does rise, he will only shake his fist at you, and will imme-
diately allow himself to be mollified by your putting your hand on your
heart, bowing politely, assuring him that “yºu didn't do, it,” and
then intimating that “you are willing to pay for accommodation in
his house.” You will be shown to your bed-room, when it will be as
well at once to ask for a tallow candle to rub the floor with, and
make a slide, on which the proprietor will be the first to fall; then
ring for a warming-pan, a kettle, a large box labelled Pills, conclud-
ing the performance by jumping into bed with, your clothes on:
You may now consider that you have done enough to prove yourself
several degrees removed from those proud, cold, say-nothing-to-nobody
sort of Englishmen, who are so generally to be met upon the Con-
tinent.
In the morning, and also during the entire day, you will hear the
Chimes of Antwerp Cathedral. The ambitious Tourist may seat him-
self upon his portmanteau, and interpret the language of the bells as
“Turn again, RoRINsox” (Jones and SMITH are out of the question)
“Lord Mayor of Antwerp.” They don’t of course say anything of the
kind, and there is no Lord Mayor.
The name of this town is, as we have said before, Antwerp, but the
French, with their usual perversity, will call it Anters. The pronun-
ciation of this name reminds us, that the tune, which the Cathedral
clock plays, may possibly be
“Anvers and Anvers is my Hieland Laddie gone?”
Simi -
S |I) \ sº -
However this is simply interesting to the man who winds up the works:
on second thoughts we remember, that the economical authorities
have provided themselves with a permanent winding staircase in the
Church Tower, which saves the expense of employing a clockmaker.
There is an ancient society in Antwerp called St. Luke's, to which
*:::::: of which several Royal Academicians might be distinguished
members.
Be the weather fine or wet, the Tourist may walk about the streets of
Antwerp all day free of charge.
Gratis Erhibitions.—The Exterior of the Cathedral can be well seen
from earliest dawn till quite dark; also, the outside of several
Churches; and, from the same side, an excellent view can be obtained
of the Museum.
The Theatre, we are informed, is only open for a part of the year;
and that partis always well filled.
The British Consul may be seen for twopence a head through a glass-
door. Feeding time at one o’clock, when the price of admission is
raised. No one is admitted after the Consulis once quite full. There
is no deception, he is alive, and will shake hands, talk affably, and
answer any ns.that may be put to him. Sticks and umbrellas
must be left in the hall.
The Post Office in this town is not the same as the Post Office in
another town, and is on this account alone, worth the trouble of a visit.
We now consider that the time has arrived when, previous to quitting
Antwerp, we may give a few more—
General Hints for the Tourists.--Always shout out your English sen-
tences at foreigners. They’re all deaſ. Your only other chance of
being understood is by talking broken, English to them. For what is
the good of speaking your perfect mother-tongue to those who cannot
understand it?. It is simply a waste of words. All foreigners can
swim. If you doubt the assertion, experimentalise after the manner
º in the cut. This humorous feat will suggest another cut, -
cut off
Take it forgranted that everyone is tryingtocheatandimposeuponyou.
Dispute every item in every bill separately.
To ensure civility and respect, see that all your portmanteaus, bags,
and hat-boxes be labelled MURRAY in the largest capitals.
ANGLO-SAXON WINE.
In a paragraph headed “What Wines are made of,” the Cincinnati
Scientific Artizan gives the following results of the analysis, by HIRAM
Cox, M.D., of various samples of liquors on sale at a store in Cincinnati:
“The distilled liquors were some pure, and some vile and pernicious imitations;
but the wines had not one drop of the juice of the grape. The basis of the port
wine was diluted sulphuric acid, coloured with the elderberry juice; with alum,
sugar, and neutral spirits. The base of the sherry wine was a sort of e malt,
sulphuric acid, flavoured from the bitter almond oil, with a per-centage of alcoholic
spirits. The basis of the Madeira was a decoction of hops, with sulphuric acid,
honey, spirits from Jamaicarum, &c."
Would the chemistry of DR. HIRAM Cox, applied to the fluids which
Britons are accustomed to swallow under the denomination of port,
sherry, and Madeira, resolve them into components other than those
above specified? It is too much to be feared that most of what is sold
as port wine resembles real portin nothing but its colour and effect in
causing drunkenness and gout. When the votary of Bacchus and
reader of SHARspeARE notes Iago telling Roderigo of Desdemona, that
“the wine she drinks is made of grapes,” he naturally thinks to himself
“I should like to have some of it. I wish as much could be said of
me.” How often must this reflection have occurred to every jolly old
the artists belong: it corresponds we believe to St. Luke's in
commentator on SuaksPEARE!

At Frankfort there

of delicate fare seems
to have been the
result of a vivid ima-
gination.
Accounts from

Margate, and Scar-

this year, and Lod-
ging-house keepers
are therefore pro-
spering. The good
folks from London
are, they say, coming
down handsomely.
Our belovedyoung
Prince has been pa-
tromising, Highland
sports, specially Scotch dancing, or Hop Scotch as it is called in the
North... GENERAL KNoLLys is reported to have said that H.R.H.'s
dings have been conducted on the principle that “Youth must
ve its Fling,” and, that Fling, a Hieland one. By the way, the
$. has been recently entrusted with the Command of the English
anguage. - -
Boulogne is very full. The Hotel-keepers are engaged in the tailor-
like occupation of “takingin” and “letting out;” the former operation
applying to the customers, the latter to the beds, which are now pro-
duced on purpose to be let out.
One of the clerks at Doctors' Commons has become a Poet. On the
occasion of any great wedding he presents the Bride with a copy of the
arriage Lines. Talking of this reminds us that medical, men, instead
of patronising Wimbledon and Clapham Commons, might find some
eligible and healthy sites for their houses upon the above mentioned
Doctors' Commons... One of the white-aproned touters in this locality,
a very arch dog, while eyeing the statue of QUEEN ANNE in St. Paul's
hurchyard, made the following conundrum: “Why, was this Good
Queen previous to making a declaration of her love for PRINCE GEORGE
like a rule in English Grammar?” One of his fellow touts, who ha
heard it before, readily answered, “Because she was ANNE before
a-vowal.” The quick witted gentleman was immediately presented
with a pewter badge, which he wears to this day. He is now known
as the Badger, and, in this character, has been drawn by several artistic
and funny dogs.
The old custom of paying a Quarter’s Rent and Taxes on Michaelmas
Day still holds good in some parts of England; in many places,
however, it has fallen into disuse.

to the effect that much disturbance has been created in the Spirit

fact was notified to MR. Home by the spirit of ARISTOPHANEs, who
rapped out the following sentence, short, but full of meaning: “Charon
has cut his Styx.”

IT appears that the gun and mortar-boat * created at so much
expense during the Russian war, is all rotten. It consists of mortar-
boats no stronger than the contents of a hod, and gun-boats much of
the same consistence as mortar.

III., who hated ideologues, were now in his Nephew's
place, how disgusted he would be with the most intelligent
of his, subjects! To be sure, he would perhaps not
altogether disapprove of the saying, that France to
war for an idea; because “for an idea” is a much more
specious phrase than “under a pretence,” and formerly
when, France went to war, the reaſ idea which she contem.
plated in so doing was that very practical one, the idea of
aggrandisement; which however, of course, she had relin-
quished before engaging in the Italian campaign that
ended in the annexation of Savoy and Nice.
M. De MonTALEMBERT has an idea of the Free Papal
Church. So M. Auguste CoMTE had an idea of Positive
Religion; which, to the British understanding, seems
positive nonsense. The amiable and liberal Popery of
M. DE MonTALEMBERT, though more respectable, is hardl
less visionary than the Atheism or Pantheism of §.
CoMTE. His idea of “a free Church in a free State” is
evidently a fixed one. There can be no such thing in the
world; except as it exists in the United Kingdom; if
M. De MontalEMBERT is satisfied with that, in which
case we beg his pardon. Fancy what tricks the Church would
play if it were free to do whatever it thought right. There
would not be a pin to choose between PETER and JACK,
and even MARTIN would he troublesome. As for JAck,
only think what the Free Kirk of Scotland would do iſ it
..". the freedom of being at liberty to punish º:
for breaking the Scotch Sabbath. Any free Church, in a
free State would soon create an explosion. M. DE Mon-
TALEMBERT's would be like a red hot poker in a barrel of
gunpowder.

WE hear of a new Disease. Oneº was talking

caught what the first was saying... Whatever may have
been the ill-nature of the remark, it has been ascertained

What
KIND AND CANNY.
MR. PUNCH was amused with something he saw in a Glasgow paper
the other day. He was pleased to observe that a recognition of the
merits of MR. LAMBETH, the distinguished Glasgow organist, and one
of the half-dozen British who know what conducting means, had taken
place. If you could f an organist like MR, LAMBETH at the three choir
festivals, there would not be so much foolscap in the quires... When
he is tired of his Glasgow organs let him come south. Or as
- - - - - - the gen-
tleman in Midas sings:– ,
“If so be you wants an organ,
Come to us, you jolly MR. L.
And you shali say, with LADY MoRGAN,
Those Cockneys pay a Talent well.”
However, let Glasgow flourish, and if she flourishes enough about
MR, LAMBETH, well and good. What amused ir. Finch was, that at
the Presentation to this gentleman of a splendid silver something, and
what was described as One Hundred and Fifty Sovereigns, the silver
was duly given, but the gold had been put away to M.R. LAMBETH's
account in the bank, and he was presented with the bank receipt. Now
this is eminently Scottish. It is inculcating a lesson of prudence in
the very moment of doing a generous thing. Suppose in the excitement
of the hour, MR, LAMBETH, receiving gold, had rushed off to LANG's
and spent a lot of money in a hundred or so of the luncheon tit-bits
and then a lot more in a dinner in George Square, and then treate
himself to a concert at a music hall. Not that he is in the least º
to do anything of the kind; but suppose he had been a man of ill-
regulated mind, and had desired to do such things. Well—he is
instantly brought up to his moorings. A bank receipt, and, the bank
won't be open till to-morrow. To-morrow the excitement would be over.
The idea was worthy the cautious Scottish intellect—but the idea of
the presentation was worthy the warmhearted Glaswegians who thus
honoured an eminent artist whom Mr. Punch is also happy to honour.
A NEW WATERING-PLACE WANTED.
WE are a strange people, we English., Our social laws and customs
are chokefull of anomalies. We brag about our being strict observers.
of our Sunday, yet in certain of our streets there is more business done
on Sunday than in all the week besides: and while we think it wrong
on Sunday for people to admire the Holy Family of TITIAN, we let them
go to Hampton Court and see the unchaste nymphs of LELY. So too,
we brag about our modesty, and, as compared with that of foreigners
our superior morality. Yet we suffer things in England which wou
nowhere else be sanctioned, and we calmly look at sights which, abroad
would not be tolerated. Passing over here our streets, which are a
shame and a disgrace to us, let us instance for example the bathing at
our watering-places. A lot of girls half draped stand bobbing up and
down in half a yard or so of water, and, within an easy, eyeshot, a lot
of men stark naked disport themselves in any way it pleases taste to
move them. At times a bolder brute than common will float past the
women's bathing-place, if that be kept apart, but in very many cases the
bathing is promiscuous. Meanwhile, Gorillas on the shore, with tele-
scopes and opera-glasses survey the bathing nymphs, as coolly and as
closely as they would the semi-undressed dancers in a ballet.
Will any one defend this system of indecency? or say that people are
the better for enjoying these indelicacies of the seaside season? We
don't have common bath-rooms for our daughters and our sons, yet we
apparently think nothing of their having common bathing-places...Town
§. and corporations, and the like so-called, “authorities,” have
power to interfere, and put a stop to this immodesty; but such, people
*fcourse have little notion of ropriety, and think it a good lark when
a girls' legs become visible. ſº. a watering-place be started where the
bathing shall be placed under proper supervision, and where girls may
learn to swim without being shamed or stared at, and Punch will
advertise that place to all the corners of the kingdom, and render it
imperative for every one to visit it. Brighton has made some approaches
to this desideratum.

him off.]

“CIRCUMSTANCEs, over which I had no control, and didn't
want to have any, prevented my fulfilling my half-engagement to give
you an account of what you are pleased to call my holiday tour, but
which is really a sanatory precaution to prevent a frame, already over-
tasked in your service, from becoming utterly exhausted. If you think
it is any pleasure to me to go knocking about the country, 'away from
my own bath, and books, and bed, you were never more mistaken in
your life, and that is saying a good deal. Pleasure, indeed! I cordially
agree with the late SIR. G. C. Lewis, who said—and Roch EFoucauld
never wrote a better thing—that Life would be very tolerable but for
its Pleasures. -
“I went away from London as soon as you sent me the money, which
you might have sent in a more convenient form than £50 notes. I
departed by the Great Western, because I didn't care in the least where
I went, and 1 thought that as the poor old G. W. R. is so dreadfully
poor, everybody should try and do a little to support it., Especially as
though they are so poor, the G. Westerns, are so civil all along the
line—it is like being among reduced gentlefolk, they are so obligingly
polite. It’s all hollow, of course, and what does. it matter whether a
courteous guard in the West answers to your inquiry how long we stop
here, ‘I am afraid, Sir, we shall hardly stop long enough to make it
safe for you to get out,” or a brutal guard in the East says, “No time
at all; so just keep your seat, unless you want to be left behind.” It
will all be the same in September, 1963. -
“Usually, I travel, first class, because more care is taken of the
carriages, and it would read better, in the event of an accident, not to
be described as a second-class passenger. One is thought to owe this
sort of thing to one's friends. But I chose to ride second on the day

defied him with that little ticket, and actually got into a second class,

nurse was happily unable to read—or perhaps found reading upside

amused and caressed her child, and made the journey lighter to it. But
the other wench had been taught to read, and read a Penny Journal

the weariness of the other child, its tired sprawling about, its despairing

little wretch, or take it, on her lap. , But when master came to the

would be to see the affectionate interest taken in her darlings by one of
their nurses. -
“I did not care, I say, where I went, and as life is a vale of tears, I
thought I would go to the vale of Llangollen. There’s a railway
through it, now, so it is quite spoiled, and Crow Castle doesn't look a
quarter, so imposing as it did twenty-five years ago. Next day I went
and looked at the curious cottage where the Honourable ELOIs A BAKER
and Miss PENSIVEBOY lived together so many years, the dear old dears.
Love disappointments. Bah!, Was there nobody to tell the kind
creatures that one man is just as good as another, and better too?
Never mind, they are gone, but there is their quaint cottage, with its
black, carved oak work, carved door, carved windows, carved dog-
kennel, carved everything—looking like a great toy, of wondrous
elaboration. ... Did I say that there was the usual arper arping on his

“They belonged to a family, the heads whereof were in a first-class
carriage. There were two children with them, and two others with
the parents. The attentive and affectionate father was negotiating an
exchange of infants at every station—now he took away baby and gave
men's châteaur and seats. I went to stern, deep-rooted DIRK CAstle,
whose walls would resist an Armstrong. There’s a picture in the
gallery there of the Welsh Widow, who, a good many years ago, had a
shorter way of getting divorce than by going, before JIMMr Wilde,
She obtained seven divorces by pouring melted lead into the ears of
seven sleeping spouses, mid the stem of a tobacco-pipe. The eighth had
his suspicions, feigned sleep, and put her pipe out. A pretty face, if I
recollect, for I did not go in this time. I have not been inside Dirk
CASTLE for a quarter of a century. I dare say Colonel, BIDDLeTon-
MYDDUPH would have let me come in if I had sent in your name. I
also went and beheld KYNBRINAUT, which belongs to a Nobleman. Ionce
read a novel called Aspen Court, or some such name, and I fancied that
Kynbrinalt must have stood for one of the houses therein described, in
which case the writer took a great liberty with the property of his
betters, besides altering arrangements to suit his own nonsense. Then
I went and looked at the new house, which the greatest man in Wales
is building to replace his mansion burned down a few years ago. This
is LLYNNSTAY. The old house was very ugly. The new one is not suffi-
ciently advanced for me to say what it will be like, but there are a great
many weeds in the lake. But, SIR. W. W. W, with one remark I’ll
trouble you, trouble you, namely, that the noble Avenue is all that I
would wish to see it, and I had a good mind to come in and tell you so,
only I knew you would give me lunch, and I must not eat lunches., . It
is very pleasant to see all over those parts the engraved picture which
nearly 20,000 Welsh folk presented to the Lady of the Avenue in
memory of the night of the fire. But what’s the use of taking pleasure
in avenues, and pictures, and gratitudes, or anything else? I nearly
threw the horse down just by the Llynnstay Gates, and then I whopped
him for my carelessness. # dare say I have often been whopped for
somebody else's carelessness—so it’s all the same.
“Being in Wales, I thought I would stay there. So I went to a
place called Mould, I don't know why it is so called. I saw no mould
in particular. There's a fine old church, on an eminence, and it has
been well restored by SALVATOR Ecclesiasticus, I mean of course
MR. G. G. Scott, who goes about undoing the work of churchwardens
and re-doing the work of mediaeval architects. The Black Lion gave
me for breakfast the best mushrooms I ever ate, but we are all mush-
rooms, except such of us as are toadstools, and I could mention a good
many members of that family of fungus. Rich ARD WILson, the
painter, is buried in this church-yard, and there is a lot of Welsh verse
on the stone. The last three words are Asynaroes bresenol. I should
be ashamed if I had the ſaintest idea what they mean. I see he is
called Member of the Royal Academy of Artists. Then I nearly broke
my neck, going to see the Vale of Clwydd (rhymes to Druid), the
reason whereof is, that the roads are down perpendicular hills, and the
drivers neither put on the brakes nor look at the horses, but talk affably
to you, while you are clenching your teeth and feeling all your interior
lower man ascending to your §: as you rush down precipices
that give you the night-mare for a week. believe the horses know
all about it, and that there is no real danger, but you may as well be
killed as frightened to death.

to go to Scotland if 1 like. I say I suppose I have a right. d not
at all approve your manner when I hinted that I should go north. You
did not say much, but seemed to think that I_ought to have gone to
Southend, or Brighton, or somewhere whence I could be fetched at an

A STARTLING STAGE EFFECT.
In the Times, the other day, we hit upon the following:—
HEATRICAL.-WANTED, a number of YOUNG LADIES and
GENTLEMEN, desirous to embrace the stage as a profession. Apply, imme-
diately, to B– and D–, &c.
Well, there is no accounting for taste; but of all things in the world,
the stage is about the last we should, desire to “embrace.” We have
indeed no notion how the embrace could be effected; and at any rate it
could not be returned, for we have never heard of a stage possessing
arms, although we are quite thoroughly aware that it has wings.
Working Like a Horse.
AN Economical Gentleman, ſond of carriage exercise, having been
obliged to sell his horse, determined that he could do just as well
without it; and he may now be seen at any time, during the afternoon,

“Here I lowered my mind and hired a gig, and drove about to lookat

BUSINESS OF THE ASSIZES.
THE following important causes have been heard during the recent
Home Circuit, and have occupied the greater portion of the Bench's
valuable Time:—
“Noodle v. Doodle. In this case the Plaintiff complained, that while
walking with the Defendant, he the Defendant had slipped off the
athway into a ditch, and in so slipping had caught at the arm of said
laintiff, and had almost pulled said Plaintiff into the aforesaid ditch.
That ": said Plaintiff did sustain such fright and mental damage
as to wholly incapacitate him from attending to his usual avoca-
tions and trade, whereby he, said Plaintiff, gets a living; and therefore
said Plaintiff, sued said Defendant, and lays the damages at £200.”
In the getting up of this case too great praise cannot be bestowed
upon MessRs. NATHAN, GRUBB & Co., the attorneys for the Plaintiff,
as without their indefatigable exertions, the case would never have
been brought under the notice of the jury. On the learned Judge's
notes, we find substituted for “under” the word “beneath; ” so that
the final sentence may be read, “beneath the notice of the Jury.”
“Muff v. Ninny. Four days’ trial. In this interesting case the
Defendant, an old man of eighty had been paying a friendly visit to the
Plaintiff, an elderly gentleman of ninety years of age, at his residence
in the Downluck Almshouses, and, on quitting said residence, had
omitted to shut the door, thereby admitting a current of air into said
Plaintiff's sitting apartment, whereby said Plaintiff caught a severe
cold, which cost him the extra washing of three red pockethandkerchiefs,
.."ºwn said Plaintiff sues said Defendant, and lays the damages
a .”
. In this case the admirable conduct of the attorneys for the Plaintiff
in collecting evidence and materially increasing the expenses of ordinary
litigation, failed to receive that amount of commendation from the
º Judge by whom the case was tried, which was most certainly
eir que.
The sharp practitioners, who have deserved so well of the Legal
Profession, for bringing forward cases, and promoting the active
business of the assizes, have in some instances received severe repri-
mands from the Bench. There were about a score of actions similar
to the ones above mentioned, as well on the Home as on the other
Circuits, and whether the Legal Profession gains or loses the public
respect by trading upon such petty grievances as these, is a question
that must be left to the decision of better Judges than ourselves.
ODORIFEROUS EXPRESSIONS.
ONE of the late meetings of the British Association at Newcastle is
described by the reporter of the Morning Post in a narrative beginning
with the º two sentences, whereof the latter is an example of
exquisite alliteration, the ingenuity of Master Holofernes himself
would have been taxed to ºf"
“No one has visited Newcastle, or approached it, without carrying away a very
decided impression that it is the most dreary, dismal town in England. A feculent,
ferruginous, and fuliginous atmosphere surrounds and envelopes it.”
Feculent, ferruginous, and fuliginous! What a strength of expres-
sion is given to these three epithets, by the initial consonant of each *
How suggestive they are; how nicely they intimate a specific impres-
sion on the olfactory nerves | With what forcible elegance they impress
the idea that “canny Newcastle” is characterised by a peculiar odour?
They have a force exceeding that of adjectives, and equal to the energy
of interjections. Piff!. Phew! Phit! They have all the significance of
those exclamatory whiffs which we propel from our lips when we are
constrained to hold our noses.

Two SEA VIEWS.
“ANY FRESH PRAwNs THIS MARNIN, SIR "
“I Recommend you,” said my Doctor, “change of air, and quiet. Good
morning.” - -
“Then,” cried BREEZER, my friend and companion; “let us together betake
ourselves to the sea-side.” -
I left it to BREEZER, and BREEZER took me to Brightgate, or Marton shall we
say? At the close of one week I left Brightgate to BREEZER.
I wanted, quietude: BREEZER said that he liked a little life: Iretorted that I
liked as little as possible. I pined for the true enjoyment of the Awful Loneliness
of the Trackless Desert. BREEZER's notion of pleasure is to sit in an open Fly and
be slowly driven from the commencement of one Cliff to the end of the other,
and then for variety ºf driven back again. Give me, say I, the timid Gazelle
that glads you with her bright blue eye, or the untutored Armadillo burrowing
beneath the arid plains of Sahara. BREEZER likes to look at what he calls “the
Gals,” and says, “blow the Armadillo.” For me the Simoon and the Delusive
Mirage of Palaces. BREEZER is contented with the sands at low water, and the
rows of dazzling white houses with green blinds and blistered verandahs. "I would
be far remoyed from the haunts of my fellow man. It is as much as BREEZER
can do to take his ticket for Brightgate, and even then he won't go by Express
train, because it tears him from his beloved London too abruptly. Every man
to his taste, but alas, the BREEZERs, now-a-days have it all their own way in the
matter of noise. Tell me of a really quiet sea-side place where I can enjoy the
comforts without any of the bustle of high-pressure civilisation. I’ll trouble
you. I am goingtonnake a proposal; to put forward a new, original idea. I am

beginning to cry out that they’ve got shrimps and prawns for sale.

comes in and makes a noise. Hate a noise. Says he’ll pull the clothes off if
I don’t get up. Hate that sort of thing when you want to snooze. He says I

Now we come to my proposal. BREEZER wants change of air and
noise: I require change of air and quiet. Both of us are representatives
of a class. BREEZER represents a class; so do I. Mine, I should say,
is a first class. BREEZER’s class is well cared for. There’s Brightgate,
and Marton, and Ramsborough, and Scar cum multis aliis all for
him. But for me and my first class there is absolutely no place found
unless we give up our rights as members of a civilised community, an
sojourn on some remote shore where the Times of five days ago is
a luxury, and Punch a month old a literary treat beyond the reach of
words. Let BREEZER and his kind betake themselves to their marine
Vanity Fairs; be it for me and mine to take lodgings near the Delectable
Mountains, with a fine open view of the sea, and my peaceful London
paper every morning.
t there be a company (limited of course) formed, whose object shall
be to provide a j. watering-place for the lovers of quiet. Let
them get a charter for the said town, and therein let the following
stringent rules be set down:-
1st. That the time commonly called “cock-crow’ be abolished; an
that, any cock neglecting the first warning, shall be killed, and devour
by the person or persons whom he may have disturbed. -
2nd. That to obviate all annoyance by postmen knocking and ringing,
every one shall call at the post office for his own letters, that is, if he
do earnestly and heartily desire to see them, which is, we hold, a rare
and exceptional case. -
3rd. That no one shall consult anybody else upon any business what-
ever.
4th. That no band of music be hired to play on, or in, any part of this
town on any pretence of amusing the inhabitants thereof.
5th. Further, that no man with a blackened face, or collection of
men with blackened faces, carrying musical instruments of torture, to
wit, banjo, bones, accordion, fiddle, castanets, triangle, kettle-drums,
and such like, shall dare to liſt up their voice or twang their instru.
ments, or both, or either, within four miles of this quiet town, on pain
of being was HED., And what time the inhabitants shall hear the banjo,
bones, accordion, fiddle, castanets, triangle, kettle-drums, any, either, orall
of such instruments of torture, they shall rise up in concert and play upon
said offenders with fire-engines, whereby said offenders shall be washed.
6th. **And from the mouth of our town
Add thus much more :-That no Italian boy
Shall play or troll in our dominions.”
7th. That all organ-men be excommunicated from our town by the
ancient ceremony of bell, book, and candle; omitting bell and book as
conducive to noise.
8th. That on Sundays, as every one shall know what time Church is,
no bells need be rung.
9th. That anybody, of whatever degree he may be, who shall make,
or cause to be made, any sort or kind of noise between the time of mid-
night, and midday, and between the time of midday and midnight,
shall be branded, pumped on, and expelled. N.B. A mitigation of this
sentence, by way of fine, may be, that the offender shall be brandied-
and-watered, and made to pay for it all round.
10th. That all such useless and noisy persons, as tinkers, blacksmiths,
sawyers, knife-grinders, or wheelwrights, and such like, shall not ply
their trade within five miles of the town.
11th. That fly-men shall only speak in whispers.
12th. That any newspaper-boy appearing in the town shall be forth-
with hung.
These are some of the few rules which I would bring before the
notice of the New. Quiet Watering-Place Establishment Company
(Limited), of which it will give me much pleasure to be the promoter.

monastery to be seen, where
dwell the Monks of La
Trappe. The chief of the
order resides in Paris, and
is called Père la Chaise. As
may be gathered from these
titles, their occupation is to
let out flys, broughams and
saddle-horses.

GERMANY.-This country is bounded on every side by a lot of places,
but that it has any connection with the German ocean is a mere German
notion that must be at once dispelled. The male population are called
Germans, the female, of course, Gerwomans; the rest of the family
Ger-boys, Ger-girls, Ger-babbies, and so on.
The natives call their country Fatherland, and it therefore follows
that the Mother-tongue is never spoken. The enterprising Tourist
having to reach many farther lands than Ger-many Fatherland, must
not be stopped too long by etymological considerations.
The money of the country is simply divided into good and bad. To
the former description, however, belongs the current coin.
As a General Rule for Economical Travellers the ordinary English Six-
pence will go a very long way if, for instance, you carry it with you

All Germans have long or short light-hair, to which natural ornament

comfort. If you are a member of Oxford or Cambridge, it is considered

a graceful compliment on entering such a town as Heidelberg at eleven
o'clock P.M. to appear before the authorities in your University night-
cap and gown. The official who sits in his Bureau (you’ll find him in
the top drawer, left-hand side) will ask you if tº: going to sleep
there, to which you can reply by going to sleep there and them. English
ladies travelling need not be in the least degree shocked at the mention
of the officer in the drawers of his Bureau. There is no breach of decorum
here, and everything is conducted with due regard to propriety.
German Hotels.-If you are going to stop, and if you are not going
you will, of course, stop, it will be as well to come to some under-
standing with the landlord. If he doesn't speak English, and yok do
not speak German, and neither know French, an understanding will be
a difficult matter. There is some legend attached to almost every old
house in Germany, and all the ancient hostelries are full of long storeys.
See that your bedroom window commands a pretty view, which is
invariably an object with us; if you fail to get such a prospect, that's
your look out, not ours.
Beds.-"The German bed, is only made for one.”. This is what
MuRRAY says, and consequently the simple Tourist, acting correctly, as
he imagined, upon this information, has, on arriving at a German,town,
immediately ordered a bed to be made for him. This is, we need hardly
point out, an unnecessary expense; as, even after the bed has been
actually made for you, you cannot take it away. This rule does not in
any part of Germany or Prussia apply to a hat or coat, which article,
once made to order, becomes your own property.
Drinks.-You will find that the Germans are far ahead of the English
in the point or pint of beer. We have ...; such as those of
Cremorne and Highbury. . They get a step beyond this and encourage
Beer-gardens. The beer, of which they are most i. proud, is MEYER-
BEER. The pedestrian journeying along the high roads will encounter a
number of beggars who will address him in canting tones: this is the
worst specimen of the whine of the country. These mendicants, by the
way, are, generally Philosophers and disciples of KANT.
Geography.—The celebrated Harz Mountains are not in Germany, as
is the common supposition. These heights, are in Scotland; and, in
proof of this, everyone will recollect the words of the national melody
“My Harz in the Highlands.”
The natives in the eastern districts are known as a race highly suc-
cessful in everything they undertake. In the west, however, the reverse
of this is the case, and from the unhappy results which have attended
all their efforts at an improved cultivation, the district has long been
known as that of “West-ſailure.”.” -
Manners and Customs.-If five Germans are walking in a row, and
meet a lady with whom only one of the party is acquainted, all the five
take off their hats. If you meet five Germans you will raise your hat
five times. The Englishman must take his politeness, with him to
the uttermost parts of the earth; he can never, in our opinion, carry it
too far. If you ever
refuse to take your
hat off to German
strangers, you had
better take yourself
offimmediately after-
wards. As a stranger
you will be expected
to fight all the Ger-
man students, who
may be residing in
the same town with
yourself: if you do
not conform to this
rule, you will find
& every one for whom
Sº you have any regard
S turn away , ſrom
ou; and surely ’tis
s better to be cut
* by a few students
than by many friends.
At dinner you will be
careful to convey
peas, beans, and
ravy to your mouth
y means of your
- knife. The ſeat re-
quires some practice, and for some time your meals will have the
dangerous character of a “Sensation ” entertainment so popular
now-a-days.
Now then on we goes to Cologne. Your luggage, mind, must be
weighed, so send that baggage on its weigh as speedily as possible.
At railway stations every one, except the railway guard, is uncivil,
and though there are plenty of porters, you will find it necessary to
carry your boxes yourself. Take them all at once, as you must never
on any account part with your luggage. Supposing that you are not
well up in the language, keep on shouting out the name of your ulti-
mate destination: this will attract the guard's attention, and he will
put you into the proper compartment. §. you are going you
will have to change carriages three times at least on the road. Take
this for granted, and change carriages at every station. Show your
passport and railway ticket to everybody, so that there may be no mis-
take. If you can’t smoke, always travel second-class, and you’ll soon
get in the way of it.
Be careful to observe all police regulations. On your arrival at any
place, you, being widely suspected, are narrowly watched. Two police.
Inen in plain clothes dog your steps, day and night. The man who
attends you as a laquais de place is a Government spy, who, unless you
fee him well, reports everything you say, and plenty that you do not
say, to his employers. If you want to go out for a walk by yourself for
more than two hours, you must procure a “permit” from the police. The
charge for a walk by yourself is seven-and-sixpence for the first hour,
five shillings for the second, half-a-crown the third and the rest. The
Rest would of course naturally come after the third hours' walk. If you
Nº. . * an umbrella with you, notice must be given two days
eIOrelland.
Very good. Now having got your ticket, you’ve taken your seat in
the carriage by the kind permission of the police, and in a few hours
you will be at Cologne.

PRETENDED FETICHISM AT ROME.
SURELY some emissary of Exeter Hall, humbugged by a Roman revo-
lutionist, must be the writer of the following statement in a letter from
the Eternal City:—
“The great subject of interest in Rome just now is the approaching procession,
which is to take place next Sunday, by express command of his Holiness, in order
to animate the faith of the Romans in the Saviour during the present grievous
necessities in Church and State. With all the pomp and splendour which the
Roman court can confer, the venerable image of the Saviour, preserved at St. Peter's
in the sancta sanctorum, will be solemnly carried to the Church of Santa Maria Mag-
ore, and a week after to that of St. John Lateran for a halt of three days more,
fore returning to the Vatican.”
Could the foregoing story be believed by anybody but an ill-informed
Protestant who thinks that the Pope and his flock worship images as
such, instead of regarding them with a merely relative yeneration, for
which, of images ºpenues the same original, any one image would be
as good as another? . . -
ut, what follows is still more absurd. It is an extract from an
alleged invito sacro, described as having been published by the Cardinal
Vicar: and thus beginning:—
“Like the sacred ark brought by King David with solemn pomp into the city of
Zion, let the adored image of the Saviour traverse the streets of Rome. Let us all
turn towards it and repeat with humility and faith, ‘Ostende faciem tuam et salvi
erimus.” Let it be introduced into the Basilica sacred to the Virgin, and there listen
to the prayers and vows of his blessed mother Mary, instead of our prayers and
vows.”
Now all this, se non è vero, and surely there cannot be a word of
truth in it, 3 mal trovato; is a very bad invention. The latter part of
it is absolute nonsense. The devotion of a glorified Saint to an image
is an absurdity that hitherto not even Exeter Hall itself has asserted or
imagined to be one of the “ errors of *:::::: The imputation to the
largest of all Christian communities of believing in images which have
ears to hear, has always been considered too ridiculous, or dishonest, by
educated Protestants. Yet here we have the Pope represented as
setting up an image to be worshipped, and the Cardinal Vicar as ascribing
to it the capacity of listening ! Where will unscrupulous bigotry stop?
But, strange to say, the author of the above-quoted letter from Rome
is no Exeter-Hallite, but the ...! of the Morning Post. Are
such things done as he doth write about at Rome, or hath he eaten of
the insane root that takes the reason prisoner?
RAISING THE WIND FOR LIFE-BOATS.
THE great interest which we have created on behalf of the National
Life-boat Institution, with the assistance of those gallant fellows who,
by saying so many of their ſellow creatures from being drowned, have
called for our praises of that valuable society, induces us to mention
that at a meeting relative thereto, it was reported that
“MR. MoRRALL, a member of the Society of Friends, residing at Matlock in
Derbyshire, was making strenuous exertions to raise the cost of life-boats from
persons bearing the same surname."
We sincerely trust that MR. MoRALL’s exertions may be crowned
with success, which is neither morally nor physically impossible. For
if MoRRALLs are not quite as plentiful as blackberries, they may be no
scarcer than PEABODIes, and one MoRRALL equal to a PEABODY would
be almost the making of the Life-boat Institution, and might benefit it
more than all the rest of its supporters put together. We would, how-
ever, suggest, as a good practical joke, that every man named BRowN,
Jones, and SMITH, should call himself MoRRALL, and, under that bor-
rowed surname, send any convenient sum of money to that truly chari-
table Institution, in aid of which Friend MoRRALL is appealing to the
benevolence of his probably not innumerable namesakes. .
Wonderful Winking.
According to the Tablet another#. has been rolling its eyes in
a Church near Rome. We wonder if a photograph of the Pope would
wink. It should, if it were taken just now, when, according to the report
published by the Italian Parliament, the Holy Father himself is
winking at Bourbon brigandage.

QUOTATIONS.
It is a popular mistake to suppose that all quotations come from
SHARspEARE. There are two great English writers in whose works all
familiar household words can be found: the one is the Immortal
WILLIAM abovementioned, and the other is generally known as, “the
Poet.” This mysterious personage, who will always be anonymous, is
the father of all such lines as cannot, at the moment of utterance, be
foisted upon any other author. “The Poet” is no very distant relation
of “The Man in the play,” by whom all the best dramatic jokes and
wittiest sayings of the stage have been, from time immemorial, uttered.
A few instances will suffice:-
“Each is so like both that you can’t tell tºother from which, as the
man says in the play,” though as to when he said it, why he said it, in
what manner he delivered himself of it, and what led up to it, we have
no existing evidence of any sort or kind.
Quotations from our friend. “The Poet” are more reverently given.
The Poet is always mentioned as saying whatever he has got to say,
“beautifully,” thus:–
“The Rose is fairest when 'tis budding new,” as the Poet beautifully
observes.
SHARspEARE is generally made answerable for proverbialexpressions,
and invariably mentioned by the speaker with sentiments of the deepest
admiration. Thus:–
M. Yes! how truly SHARSPEARE says, “The Boy is Father to the
an.’’
Let the student carefully search the Bard's entire works from the
beginning to the end, in order to ascertain the context to this line.
Let him also note down in which play it occurs.
Quote SHAKSPEARE correctly and exactly, and be able, when asked, to
give your references, which we hope will of course be invariably satis-
factory and respectable. Thus, if in some speech you wish, to make a
great point of an apt quotation about Mercy, why here you have it:-
“The quantity of mercy is not strained,
It droppeth as the gentle jew from heav'n,
It blesseth him as gives and him as takes,
And is thrice blessèd.”
This is, (you must explain lucidly) of course, from the Mercatio of
Verona, Act last, Scene 1, when What'shermane tells Thingummy
about the pound of whatyoumaycallit.
On the occasion of your being called upon to make an address to the
Young Man's Working Asylum, or whatever it may be, in your native
village, you may safely lay emphasis upon the following line as grace-
fully reflecting upon the progress of mental cultivation and, thus
declaim: “As the Immortal Bard has said–
:--- Who safely climbs let mim not climb at all.”
And again, to use the words of Othello,
“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Beware of green-eyed monsters.”
On great and memorable actions—
“The good deeds that men do, they do in the sand,
Their evil ones in the water.”—Henry VIII.
On sleep-
“Sleep, gentle sleep, Nature's soft ship boy,
How steep are your eyelids!”—Henry IV or V.
On treason—
“There is such a king in a hedge,
When treason dares to wink at him 1"—Hamlet.
On delay—
“To-morrow and To-morrow and To-morrow!”-Macbeth.
On philosophy—
“There is more philosophy in Horatio than in heaven and earth.”—Hamlet.
The pangs caused by ingratitude here find a beautiful parallel-
* Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou art not so unkind
As my tooth that can't be seen,
Which his name is Cnanurs. Krax:
That man's ingratitude!"—Shakspeare.
On the instability of human greatness—
“Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness.
I have tried to swim on little boys
This many summers in a sea of bladders,
But far beyond my depth, and when he falls
He falls as I do, and lights a lucifer again.”—Cardinal Wolsey.
Since making the above extracts, we find that there are other English
Authors besides the above-mentioned celebrities, and we will therefore
devote ourselves to squeezing the literary orange, and will give the
essential sweetness at some future time to our expectant readers.
BLOCKHEADS AT BADEN-BADEN.
PHILosophers to whom it is meat and drink to find a fool'should go
to Baden-Baden. They will there find twofools; probably a great many
more, for, amongst a lot of gamblers, there are at least as many fools
as rogues; but certainly two fools at least; two uncommonly great
fools; two sanguinary fools as they may be called with truth as well as
nicety. These two fools are indicated by our sporting friend ARGus in
a letter to the Morning Post, about the races at Baden-Baden, containing
the statement that, at that celebrated resort of sharpers and blacklegs:
“The salons have been very crowded morning and evening, but no heavy blows
have been struck on either side, and the sensation writers have been without any
material for romantic paragraphs. An affaire d'honneur has, however, just been
arranged for to-morrow, between a French and Milanese nobleman. e cause is
the same as that which led to the destruction of Troy in ages The weapons
are to be sabres, and the rendezvous is as well known as that of a fight for the
Championship is at LIMMER's.”
What is called an affaire d'honneur had much better be called an
affaire defolie. This is what a duel especially is when the cause is the
same as that which led to the destruction of Troy. For, before that
event, the dominant idea of the French novel had ever been the fellest
cause of warfare, wherein, however, the unremembered slain were
savages no better than brutes, slaughtered by a stronger brute. If the
cause, for which the noblemen, referred to by ARGUs were to fight, was
In every º like what led to the destruction of Troy, the repre-
sentative of MENELAus, had he been wise, would have sued the
equivalent of PARIs for a divorce, instead of giving him the chance of
constituting the like of HELEN a widow. Perhaps, instead of a HELEN,
the contents of a Crinoline, which those fools quarrelled about, were of no
more consequence to either of them than the heroine of a fashionable
but ignoble Opera. How utterly foolish for them to play with their
lives for stakes of so very little value. The two British pugilists who
fought the other day for £1000 a-side, had something É. a prize to
fight for. MACE and Goss were Solomon and SocRATEs compared to
the two noble fools at Baden-Baden, who have by this time probably
exhibited themselves as fighting-cocks to the spirits of the wise that sit
in the clouds and mock them.
Crux for the Critics.
WE, in the interests of true science, beg to inform Critics of the
Rationalistic and Materialist Schools, that it was only last week, there
came before our notice, the extraordinary fact of a gentleman who went

THE JOLLY SISTERS OF
ESCHENBACH.
THE subjoined paragraph,
extracted from a contemporary,
resents a curious instance of
emale self-assertion:-
º
º &º
“Wine-Bubbing Nuns.—The Ber-
lin National Gazette states that, ac-
cording to an official report, the funds
of the Convent of Eschenbach, at
Lucerne, have again diminished by
a sum of 23,000 fr. The 39 ladies
inhabiting the Convent spent 5,800fr.
during the past year in wine and
beer, without reckoning the sum of
2,650 fr., which the convent owes to
a wine dealer. Ali attempts at in-
ducing the inmates to adopt a remu-
nerative employment have hitherto
been fruitless.”
These toping nuns evidently
aspire to all that potency in
potting for which monks were
ever celebrated. Pro omnibus
bibo has been represented as
the burden of a friar's song in
the days of old; but a sister
of the thirsty community at
Eschenbach might with equal
Wºº. carol the same strain.
We should like to hear that
jolly sisterhood chant it in chorus, or sing Habitantes, in sicco. The
celebrated canticle of WALTER DE MAPEs, Est mihi propositum in
tabernd mori would have a most edifying effect on any one privileged to
hear it sung by those good ladies in refectory.
It is no wonder that the Eschenbach nuns cannot be persuaded to
adopt any remunerative employment. Why should they work if they
can afford to spend so much as they do on good liquor, unless to clear
off the little additional score which they have run up at a wine-
merchant’s Let us hope that they are not prevented from working by
that excess of devotion with which the disciples of St. Crispin are prone
to observe St. Monday.
So we should think.
FASHIONABLE SUICIDE.
WISHING to expand his mind (if that indeed be possible) Mr. Punch
the other day devoted a spare minute to read the Lady's Newspaper.
Among a vast variety of most instructive information, from the last
news about bonnets to the very latest novelty in fashion for a ball-dress,
Mr. Punch was much delighted with the following intelligence, which
he trusts that all his lady-readers will attentively peruse:—
“STAYs UNFashionABLE IN PARIs...—A Parisco indent writes :-The unusua
heat of this month has, along with the efforts of the Countess DE Castigliose,
caused a salutary change in the fashions. Stays for the present, are thrown aside,
and replaced by the more becoming ceinture Suisse. Neither does a tight body form
any longer an indispensable portion of a lady's dress. It is replaced by a loose one
of white muslin or coarse linen, worked in imitation of the bodices worn by the
peasants of the Romagna. Loose silk jackets are also tly worn. It is possible
that this style of dress will continue a long time in fashion, the doctors of the EM-
PREss having advised her Majesty to imitate the style of dress recently adopted by
MADAME DE CAstigliose, who, like nearly all her countrywomen, holds pinched
waists in aversion, and, whatever mistakes she may make in other matters, has
the good sense to believe that stays must produce a red nose or a sallow complexion.”
If by her example the EMPREss should succeed in making stays
unfashionable, Mr. Punch will forgive her for her patronage of crino-
line; for he must certainly admit that an absurdly-widened skirt is not
so dreadful a disfigurement as a pinched-in narrowed waist. Crinoline
is a nuisance, but at least there is no crime in it... Now, tight-lacing is
a sin, for it is virtual slow suicide; and, if they did their duty, parsons
ought to preach against it. The female mind in general is attentive to
the pulpit; and the Reverend MR. Rose LEAF might be listened to
perhaps upon the sinfulness of waist-pinching, whereas a deaf ear would
be turned to a mere medical adviser. The example of the EMPREss
would, however, be more heeded even than a sermon; and if EugºNIE
succeeds in abolishing tight lacing, she will earn the lasting gratitude
of Mr. Punch and all posterity.
By way of a deterrent, there is little use in saying that a shrunken,
shrivelled, skinny, stiffened, stays-pinched waist is a positive deformity,
and as much a bar to beauty as a club foot or a squint. So long as
they be fashionable, ladies care but little about making themselves
frights; and while small waists are thought “the thing,” they will at
any cost continue to be cultivated. Bent spines and reddened noses
will follow in due course, with headache, giddiness and fainting fits,
and other fashionable ailments. “Mais n'importe,” gasps the victim,
“I am in the fashion. My waist is smaller than Miss CRusHRIBB.E.'s,
and hers is only sixteen inches in circumference. Yes, it would be five-
and-twenty, if Nature had her way; mais la Mode change tout cela, dis-
tortion is the fashion.” But the Venus de' Medici—“Q, don't talk to
me of Venuses! You say her great thick clumsy waist is twenty-seven
inches round, and yet those stupid artists speak of her as ‘perfect
proportioned!” Now I stand five feet three upon my military heels, and
measure fifteen inches and three quarters round my waist, and you
don't mean to compare my figure with the Venus's 11 Besides, Sir,
Gentlemen-I don’t mean nasty smoky slovenly-dressing artists-admire
a slender figure, and think it most becoming. And as I’m dying to
get mar— I mean, to please, the gentlemen, why you see of course I
must lace in my waist a bit, though it makes me feelquite faint at times
and sadly pant for breath, especially when waltzing.”
So you think, young ladies, do you, that men like a slim waist? Well,
so they may perhaps, if it be one of Nature's moulding. But when
Nature makes a slender waist, she makes it lithe and lissome, and that
is what your staymakers by no art can accomplish. When a man has
the good fortune to get hold of a girl’s waist, he likes to feel it soft and
yielding, and not buckramed and bone-stiffened. Moreover, men before
proposing are apt to look a-head a bit; and much as they may value
good looks in a wife, they put a higher estimate upon good health and
good temper. Now, a large doctor's bill is often caused by a small
waist, and so a wife who has this latter proves a dear one to her
husband. Then as to temper, Nature won't be outraged with impunity,
and if 3%. distort the body the mind soon grows disfigured. So a
pinched frame is avenged by a peevishness of temperament, and a
woman with a wasp’s waist is generally waspish.
So, ladies, dear kind silly thoughtless loving lovely ladies, do let com-
mon sense for once gain admittance to the fashion-books. Follow the
example which, if the above report be true, has been set you by the
French, and throw aside your stays and other instruments of waist-
torture. Believe us (and Tom MooRE) that however much we may
admire a pretty dress, we cannot look on it with pleasure when it is
laced so tightly that:-
“Not a charm in Beauty's mould
Presumes to stay where Nature placed it.”
We know you dress to please us (at least you tell your husbands so),
and depend on it, dear ladies, there is not a man among us—not being
a born fool—that does not hate, detest, abominate, and occasionally
swear at the sinful, suicidal fashion of tight-lacing, which is every whit
as frightful a personal disfigurement as the squeezed skulls of the Flat-
Heads, or the crushed feet of the Chinese.

IN A POLICE COURT.
– - H is : ** º:
= - - lar adage that “the early
º / * T is bird picks up the worm.”
* , (-5. . The truth of this adage,
º - which should be obvious
to a Partridge, and felt
by every Beak, has been
recognised at the Thames
Police Court along with
that of another, namely,
“better late than never.”
According to a news-
paper report, at the
above-named tribunal:—
“On Saturday MR. PAR-
TRIDGE commenced business
at half-past ten o'clock in
the morning, to the great
satisfaction of thosein attend-
ance, his practice hitherto
having been to come at a later
hour. On the previous day
the Magistrate was made ac-
quainted for the first time
with the inconvenience
caused by the late and irregu-
lar sittings of the Court, and
expressed his ..º.º. that
anything of the kind should
- have happened. He had re-
solved to commence business
earlier in future, and it is
hoped that he will now com-
ply with the Act of Parlia-
ment, and take his seat at ten
o'clock. This would be con-
ferring a great boon on the
ublic. MR. Woolrych, who
as on many occasions not
arrived until fifteen or thirty
minutes past eleven, is now
also expected to arrive at an
earlier hour.”
EARLY RISING
This piece of intelligence suggests proverbial, philosophy to us at such a rate
that were a great, living author not still alive in the body, we should think that
we were impressed by the spirit of TUPPER, if a medium could be inspired by
a genius so much above mediocrity. We will only add that, in resolving to attend
to their business betimes, the Magistrates of the Thames Police Court have shown
a just appreciation of the character of the many rogues
they have to deal with, and who are so crafty that, as the
saying is, you must get up early to take them in, whether
.. or otherwise, as they take in other people; and
whose vigilance is such that, late or early, it is as hard to
find them napping as it is to catch a weasel asleep.
PUBLIC-SPIRITED SEWERITY.
.AN inquest was held the other day at St. George's Hos-
|. on the body of a man who had died of delirium trement,
rought on by loss of blood from a wound. In evidence it
was stated that:-
“His arm was bound up, and he was taken to DR. ARMsTReno's,
of Duke Street; but that gentleman said he would rather not have
anything to do with the case. Deceased was, therefore, taken to the
hospital.”
The cause of death having been explained by the House
Surgeon of St. George's :—
“A juror raised the question, whether DR. ARMsTaong had acted
rightly in refusing to attend the deceased; but it was overruled, as it
was considered that the hospital, being near, was the best place for
the deceased.”
Of course; º the poor man's arm had been
bound up, and there was no call for DR. ARMSTRONG's
interference. On the contrary, if he had meddled with the
case, its fatal termination might have occasioned him to be
blamed by censorious busybodies for not having referred
it to the safer care of the hospital. The juryman who was
so sharp as to “raise, the question whether DR. ARM;
STRONG had acted rightly” in doing what was dictated
by caution and common sense, should consider that the
alacrity which British jurymen are accustomed to exert, in
pouncing on a pretext for censuring a qualified medical
practitioner, is apt to defeat its own end, if that end is the
public good. Eagerness in the enforcement of responsi-
bility is noble and virtuous, but tends to cause responsi-
bility to be, if possible, declined. It would be well for
British jurymen, and some others as zealously severe,
to remember, not only as regards medical men, but with
respect to all whose services are hazardous to those who
require them, that the British Public cannot, have its
pudding in the advantage of enterprise, and eat it too in
the satisfaction of enforcing responsibility.

It is true, we believe, that MR. PHELPs
ConceRTs and Cathedrals have been the lot of the good folks of off... to play Manfred by way ºf a graceful compliment to MR. FAl-
Worcester; and this “lot,” in order to give a spice to our article, we
might mention as that celebrated “dinner-relish,” 'yclept, the Worces-
tershire Sors. Musicians and vocalists from Worcester, Hereford,
Durham, and many other places were there, and in the long trumpet
solos, too great praise cannot be given to the Hereford short-horns.
This reminds us of Cattle Shows, and we gather, “from information
that we have received,” that the River Mersey is going to be converted
into a sheep-walk; that it will be a pretty fast walk for any sheep we
conclude from the fact, that, the farmers have already turned in their
steam-rams. Mersey on us! what next | Shall we see in spring tim
hot joints of delicate lamb walking about on the bed of the stream; an
baaing by their mothers' side P In this case the flow of the water must
necessarily be stopped, as the river will be full of Dams. How beauti-
fully has the prophetic DR. WATTs alluded to this novelty. Many years
ago the Seer, even then in the seer and yellow leaf of his age, wrote, if
our memory correctly serves us, these words':-
“Abroad in the meadows to see the steam-rams,
A skipping about at the side of the dams.”
Evidently foreshadowing the remarkable event of which we are now the
veracious chroniclers.
Without much difficulty, we get from our] muttons to wool, and we
might get to that Woolley sheep whom the Insurance wanted to shear,
but we prefer allowing our thoughts to glide from the wool to “the
place where the wool ought to be,” that is, the woolsack, and so with-
out quitting our oyine friends, we come straightway to the bar-lambs.
The annual day for 'granting licence to counsel, will soon be here:
whether there will be any strong opposition, we do not know; the bar-
rister's motto, is “ All's fair in love and law.”
The City Commissioners of Sewers are going to turn their attention
to the relief of sempstresses.
Everyone has beard of “ MATHEws at Home,” and everyone is now
hearing of MR. Charles MATHEws abroad, where, however, if we
may credit the reports which come from the Theatre of Varieties in
Paris, he seems quite at home. He made his first appearance in France
conER's partner, the Acting-Managing Man Fred. B. CHATTERTON.
However this may be, Lord ByRon's Mystic Drama, which, by the
bye, he gloried in not having written for the Stage, is at some time or
other coming out at the Lane, and coming out pretty strongly too.
Social dialogue in the western streets of London is now somewhat
limited. Nobody with any pretence to gentility, likes to meet anybody.
When, however, at any right-angled corner collision is inevitable, the
exclamation is “Hallo! you here!”. Whereupon the weak individual
thus caught at a disadvantage, blushingly replies, “Ye-e—es. I’m-a-
a—just passing through Town,” and escapes in a cab as quickly as pos-
sible. To keep up his character in the eyes of his friend, he will perhaps
direct the cabman to drive to Euston Square, at the same time consult-
ing his watch in a hurried and impetuous manner. When he has been
carried some way, he will look through the trap-door of the Hansom,
and say with assumed audacity, “Go to-um-Number 2, Terracotta Ter-
race, Pentonville,” where the miserable deceiver has his perpetual abode.
Talking of going abroad, energetic travellers wishing to combine the
leasure of seeing far distant countries with the economy of staying at
ome should not fail to pay a visit, and a small trifle for the visit,
to MR. Telbin's admirable Panorama of the Holy Land, now º
in the Egyptian Hall. Here you have the East in the West. MR.
B. Buckstone, for whom the painting was originally executed,
does not deliver the lecture, nor does he sing Hebrew melodies ac-
companying himself upon the Jews' harp, as we had been led to expect.

A correspondent has written to us, saying, that he has been greatly
disturbed by a certain statement which appeared the other day in the
Times' Tide Table. He fears, he says, that we are coming to the end
of time because of the following announcement:-
“High Water at London Bridge.
Morning 45 min. after 11.
Afternoon O min. after 4.”
Good gracious! No minutes after four ! This really looks O-min-Ous.

THE ADVANTAGES OF 'BUS RACING.
As Summed up by a Sporting Surgeon.
“DoncasTER. Pshaw You’ll not, catch me going, there this
meeting, I can promise you. , Yes, I like seeing a g race, and
the St. Leger is a crack one: but the fact is, just at present there are
races here in London, which to me are far more interesting. What do
I mean? My º: I mean the Races of the Omnibuses, and I’ll
trouble, you to show, me any that can equal them. One goes to
races chiefly for excitement. Now, to get up a sensation there’s
nothing like an accident, and for the chance of a good accident there’s
nothing like a bus race. Yes, I know all that: there was a spill last
Derby, and not a bad one, either. Still, you see, in horse-racing if
there is an accident, it’s only to an animal, or may be to a jockey. But
in 'bus-racing, my boy, there is no telling what may happen, from a
conductor being crushed to a child being run over. Besides, the 'busses
may capsize in rattling down a hill, for of course when they are ºft
they never stop to put the skid on. And then, the chances are there’l
be a jolly lot of casualties, and you may get some goodish cases if you
are looking out for them. I make a point myself of attending all the
'bus races; and I assure you, I’ve picked up a pretty tidy lot of prac-
tice at them. You see, there’s sure to be a race as soon as a new 'bus
is started on a line of route which has been worked by the General
Monopoly Inconvenient Conveyance Company. , Directly, the new 'bus
starts the G. M. I.C. C. start a couple more to nurse it, one keepin
close in front and the other close behind it: so besides the chance o
being torn to pieces by the cads, the passengers in getting on or of the
'busses while going at full speed, are pretty sure to come to grief and
“So, long live this 'bus-racing, say I; for however great a nuisance it
may be to the public, it is certainly a benefit to men of my profession,
and the longer that it flourishes the better will it be for us. The only
thing I fear is, that, by some accidental act of common sense, a jury
should return a verdict of manslaughter against my good friends the
directors of the G. M. I. C. C., who are, aſter all, the chief promoters
of 'bus-racing. In that case there would, doubtless, be a stop put to
the sport; but the contingency of common sense occurring to a jury
is really so remote, that it is hardly worth considering.”
Sabbatarian Persecution.
THE Recusant Haymakers of Leigh, some of them poor labourers,
have been distrained upon for the penalties inflicted upon them by the
Atherton representatives of MIDAs, for the offence of saving hay on a
Sunday. We have not heard that any of them have been set in the
stocks yet, as they were condemned to be, failing distraint by reason of
no effects. In the meantime they have appealed against what appears
to be an illegal conviction, and if that is quashed what will become of

ment to vibrate any longer on the Atherton Bench *

“I did not remain ſong, in Wales. I should think that nobody in his senses
would do so, if he could help it. I saw a Welsh Bard, standing at the door of
a third rate public-house at Llanmanboverymymgch...They told me he was a Bard,
but he did not look at all like the one in the pictures illustrative of GRAY. He had
not a long white robe of priceless samite, neither had he a beautiful, white beard
and hoary hair streaming like a meteor in the troubled air. He had a blue coat
with brass buttons, a yellow waistcoat, very seedy black trousers, too short, whereby
beheld no socks above his high-lows. The bard had a very large and fluffy hat,
and he was drunk. He was not performing on the harp, but he was playing, the
lyre, for I heard him say that it was ten o'clock, when it was not even nine, which
gives you an idea of these wretched Cambrian minstrels' powers as timists. Íshould
have had sincere pleasure in massacring that, bard (did I ever tell you that I am
descended from KING EDward THE FIRST by the side of a great uncle once removed
—to Botany Bay?) but there was a policeman near, who might have misunderstood
my motives. So I looked my disgust, and went on to the station. I record it,
however, as my opinion, that Wales will never make any advance towards civili-
sation until even thinking in Welsh is made penal. But GALLIO PAM cares for
none of these things, and it. GLADstone actually goes and spends his holidays in a
Welsh castle, which is called Harden, and is in Flint, after which can you wonder
at a cruel Income-Tax? In fact, you must be very foolish to wonder at anything.
“Then I went to Chester. Queer old place. Very good beer at a pastrycook's.
Looked at the old houses in Watergate Street, and paid the neighbourhood the
usual compliment expected from tourists, of pushing everybody about, that I
might, get a good view from opposite shops and doors, and of shouting very loud
that the architecture was ‘very fine, exceedingly fine, not perhaps quite so good
as was said, my dear, but really very fine, and quite worth seeing.' I shouted all
this in a large and encouraging manner, but it did not seem to produce any great
impression, perhaps from having been heard from so many Paterfamiliases before,
so I came away, and bought a toothbrush, which I lost at Liverpool. Anybody
finding it had better send it to your office, and you may return half a crown from
yourself. The wait at Chester was one hour after the time the train for the North
was appointed to start. We protested, but the guard was smilingly obdurate. We
must wait for some train from some place I never heard of. It came at last, and
disgorged three tipsy farmers, two sailors, and a fish-fag, all of whom were hastily
and indignantly rammed by the guard into a third-class carriage into which I had
seen about a dozen people previously put. Consequently there was a row of the
most fearful kind, in that carriage, all the way to Liverpool, and I think the
sailors destroyed some of their ſellow-passengers, but as I was in a hurry to
see St. George's Hall, I did not stop to ascertain particulars.
“St. George's Hall I should describe to you (and the fact that I did not see it
would have made no difference to an experienced tourist and contributor, with a
guidebook in his travelling-bag) but the subject brings humiliating considerations
up. Here is Liverpool, a wretched kind of shipping town, originally made pros-
perous by the slave trade, and as G. F. Cooke, the actor (there were actors then,
and they were not afraid of “giving offence’) said, with all the stones of its mansions
cemented with the blood of the blacks. It is bigger now, and there are some
more ships (some of 'em built for the slave-owners) and I believe on the whole
it is rather a respectable place, and its young swells are the most stiff-backed, ill-
dressed provincials you ever did n’t wish to see. Yet this Liverpool has got the
most beautiful hall in England, a real glory of architecture,
and also a thing that answers its purpose. London has
got Exeter Hall and the Grog-Concert Halls for its
musicalities. , I don't care, about music, but there is a
musical world and also a Musical World that go on as if
the final cause of human creation were fiddling, and yet
they tamely sit down in a state of abject humiliation, as
regards a temple for their worship. This is all I mean, to
say about Liverpool, except that the ferry business enabled
me to have a cigar in great discomfort, and that the arrange-
ments for getting to the Scotch train are eminently calcu-
lated to repel tourists. They—I mean (on this occasion)
the arrangements, are simply beestly.
“The people at Carlisle are savages, who do not speak or
understand English, yet they are not unkindly, and I
obtained a glass of milk from some children who infested
and enlivened our carriage, by my masterly pantomime,
expressive of milking a cow. One of the good-natured but
heavy-handed giants who toss the heaviest luggage about
as easily as HECTOR tossed the big rock against the
Grecian fortifications at Troy, was so pleased with my
performance and its success, that he gave me what he
meant for an approving pat on the back, but his epigram
sent me several yards, and landed me in the astonished
stomach of a London tailor who was going North, and had
disguised himself in, I must say, a very meat Highland
suit. He did not know me, indeed Wich IAN PATTERN-
Book was too much flustered at my onslaught to draw
his breath, far less his dirk; but, I know him, from trans-
actions in other days to which the Statute of Limitations
makes it unnecessary for me to refer here, or elsewhere.
“‘The sun shone fair on Carlisle wall,” as in the days
of the old song, and enabled me to read the placards
and posters that “hung thereby.’ There was not, however
any information in those documents which need be repeate
to you, except that the railway people have had a faint
touch of honesty, and instead monstrously *...;
the excursionist ‘ ten clear days in Scotland,” merely
offer him, a fortnight there, “whether or no,” as was
very wittily said by a clergyman in our carriage. I
rewarded that iastic by handing him the Sporting
Life, containing an account of the combat between
Messrs. MACE & Goss, but he glanced, at his beetle-
browed wife opposite, and her cold stern glance bade him
decline the lively journal; but he should not, as a clergyman,
have lied in the presence of children, and said that he did
not read much on the railway, because of his eyes, inasmuch
as the infants had seen him reading for two hours at a
book by DR. CUMMING, which could not have done him
half so much good as the narrative of the fight. These
things make me tremble for your, Establishment—I say
yours, because I write in a land where I am a Dissenter.
It don’t seem to hurt much.
“A few hours, and a station reminded me of a Chorus
which I heard in one of LEMAN REED's smart burlesques
(Ithought 'em so then, and I believe rightly, but it is about
twenty years ago)-
“Guardians may goad their poor beasts to be following,
Cry of pursuit echo mountain and hollow in,
Swift as the water-kelp dashes her shallop in
Over the Border we're all of us galloping,
Galloping, galloping, galloping, galloping,
Over the Border we're all of us galloping."
“‘Gretna Green.’ ‘Ah!” I said, turning to a lady in
the carriage, with a melancholy inflexion in my rich voice,
and a softened º in my fine eyes, “Gretna Green.
Here,' I continued, “the little Dove, flying from her home
in the care of a strange mate, and unknowing whether
fortune had given her the haughty Falcon, the gentle
Ringdove—
“‘Or the great Goose, which was much more likely
as men go,' replied the lady, with some promptness: ‘I
do wish you would leave off talking nonsense, and kneel
down and feel for the keys which you have thrown down
somewhere.”
“She had thrown them down, Mr. Punch, but I scorn
to contest details. Indeed, what is the use of contesting
anything in this world P

I have consumed sixteen drams and thirty-two ekes in trying to under-

THE TIME OF DAY AT THE THAMES POLICE COURT.
THE advantages of early rising for the administration of justice are
signally instanced and explained in the subjoined extracts from a report
relative to the Thames Police Court:—
“As it should Be.—The Magistrates of this court have commenced business at
fifteen or thirty minutes º ten o'clock since the 5th instant, to the great con-
venience of the public. The change has effected immense good. The Magistrates
have been enabled to leave the court every afternoon at five o'clock, and good order
and quiet has prevailed. The people attending upon the night charges and remands
are away before the persons attending on summonses arrive. There has been no quar-
relling or disorder in the avenues leading to the court, and there is º: while
the present system continues of people being detained until seven and eight o'clock
in the evening, or of leaving the court wearied, exhausted, and disappointed.”
It may with truth and justice be averred that—
“Early to bench and early to rise
Marks a Beak popular, pleasant, and wise.”
The parties, however, who are interested in the dispatch of business
at the Thames Police Court, find that 10.15, or 10.30, though vastly
preferable to ll, is not quite sufficiently early to completely suit their
convenience; and they say that:-
“If the Magistrates will follow up their good intentions and commence business
at ten o'clock precisely every morning (the hour at which the judges commence
business in Westminster Hall), they will confer another boon on the inhabitants of
the district. Two additional clerks are much required. Two clerks were appointed
to the Thames Police Court when it was first established 60 years ago. The business
has since increased tenfold, and no additional clerks have been appointed. Two
clerks are not sufficient for the business of the Court, and were it not for the assis-
tance ū. the ushers and summoning officers, matters would be brought to a
standstill.”
It does not seem unreasonable to ask his Worship, the Magistrate,
to turn out at the same hour in the morning with my Lord Judge.
The rogues are all up and doing betimes, and justice ought to be even
with them. The moralist in the Grammar declares that the way to
good manners is never too late; but it appears that a Magistrate may
be a little too late and nevertheless on his way to amendment. For
we are further apprised that on Tuesday last week:—
“MR. Woolrych arrived at the Court this morning at a few minutes after ten,
heard the applications immediately, and commenced the hearing of the night
charges at -past ten.”
A few minutes past ten is only a few minutes too late. It is an
approximation to ten sharp; which is the desiderated hour. The
Thames Police Court reporter seems happy to report that the Magis-
trates in their attendance there, are tending to that hour, which, when
they have adopted it precisely to a minute, will be just the time of day.
PSEUDO.HISTORICO PATENT WHITEWASHING AND
SPONGING COMPANY (LIMITED).
This Company has been established under distinguished auspices,
and in accordance with the enlightened ideas of the age, for the restora-
tion of tarnished historical º by the reversal of contemporary
judgments. It differs from all other renovating establishments in this
important and unique feature, that whereas the latter profess only, at
the very utmost, to restore the fabric upon which they operate “equal
to new,” the present Company under to reproduce it in more than
pristine freshness, imparting to even the most blackened character
qualities and beauties which never belonged to the original, and so
effectually disguising the latter that even his nearest friends would fail
to recognise him. Recent scientific discoveries have enabled the Com-
pany to adopt a mode of operation similar to that employed in the pro-
duction of dissolving views, and under the skilful management of the
experienced operator, the holdest outlines of character are seen to
disappear in a manner as astonishing as it is beautiful to behold, being
replaced by the most exquisite touches, at the will of the artiste, or
by patterns made to order. The most inveterate blemishes effectually
removed, and crimes of the deepest dye mellowed into harmonious
combinations, and warranted to wash.
The Company anticipates important results from the present advanced
and advancing state of spiritual science, arrangements having been
made for a systematic ºf'; of intelligence direct from the most
approved mediums. Several highly interesting communications have,
in fact, already been obtained from spirits of the highest celebrity, who
have shown themselves perfectly at home in the business.
It is intended to open a branch establishment for the purpose of
extending the operations of the Company to the acts and designs of
living potentates and statesmen. As, from the peculiar aspects of the
political horizon at the present time, the Company is led to anticipate a
large accession of business in this department, early application is
desirable. His Majesty the KING of PRussia has been graciously
pleased to identify himself with this movement, further information
concerning which may be obtained of MR. CRAFT, the Company's
º: agent, to whom (for the present) communications may be
addressed.

ADVERTISING PROBLEMs.
Two interesting advertisements appeared the other day in the Glasgow
§ The following one of them, however, is evidently not
cotch :-
WANTED, a NEWSPAPER, to represent the Catholic public in
Glasgow. It must neither be sensational, vulgar, nor anti-Catholic. A great
local want will be supplied by such a journal.
Do we not know the fine Roman hand P. By Roman we do not mean
Papist, but Irish, to use a mode of speech which is itself Hibernian.
The party advertising as above for a Newspaper to represent the
Catholic public in Glasgow cannot be that Catholic public itself, unless
it consists wholly or mainly of Irish immigrants. No other, set of
people would describe the characteristics which they wish to distinguish
their required journal as consisting in three negations. The state:
ment that “a great local want will be supplied by such a journal,”
as one for which the little public that wants it is obliged to advertise,
also savours of the generous uncalculating child of Erin. No Scotchman
could conceive such a speculation, much less dream of the possibility
that anybody would venture on it.
The other advertisement is more Scottish, but rather calculated to
foster superstition:—
W ANTED, a Second-Hand COFFIN.—Address, stating lowest price,
A. 72, Herald Office.
The author of this notification must be, if not a maniac, a vampire.
A second-hand coffin could not be inquired for by anybody but a body
leading a sort of life in death. . No regular ghost would ever ask for
such a thing. It may be conceived that a vampire might; his old coffin
having fallen to pieces, and he being unable to afford a brand-new one,
More probably the advertiser is a fool; most likely a Scotchman gone
mad on economy. As to the second-hand coffin which he wants, where
is the undertaker who will undertake to ſurnish one *

WHAT WE COULD BEAR A GOOD DEAL OF .
THE AMERICAN CONSCRIPT'S COMPLAINT.
WHY must I be driven to slaughter on the cursed field of battle,
Very likely to be butchered there with torments spared to cattle?
By what law and for what reason must I life and limb surrender P :
Not because my country claims me from a foeman to defend her.
Then a duty would demand self-sacrifice; but what occasion
Subjects me to death and torture as the soldier of invasion?
If the Sovereign People's will must send me to be slain and mangled,
Tyrant !. re: spoke the word at which a crouching slave was
Strangled.
Letmesleepwith perfectlimbs, my head snowed o'er withlife'sfullwinters;
I don’t want a mass of iron to smash my shin-bones into splinters,
Bullet crashing through my face to tear away whole features, whether
Under-jaw, or cheek entire, or eyes and nose perchance together.
Jagged fragment of a shell to rip and tear up my abdomen
Is what l’Il allow if I can help it for the whim of no man. -
What! Must I lose arm or leg to serve the madness of my nation?
And be forced to undergo the agony of amputation?
Tourniquet, and saw, and knife, and bullet-forceps for extraction
Looming clearly in my view, I’d rather not go into action,
Probably with shattered bones thence to be jolted in a waggon,
Yelling all the way so loud that it were well I had a gag on.
Crushed and writhing on the plain in carnage I object to welter,
Ridden o'er by cavalry in charge, or flying helter-skelter; -
Lancer or dragoon upon the ground there stabbing me or slashing:
On my wound or in my mouth a horse his hoof of iron dashing.
Fever, too, and gangrene I regard with infinite aversion,
I had sooner die at once, so let them shoot me for desertionſ
Health and home l’d º to guard, and consequences little think on,
Won’t go South to bleed and rot by order of Dictator LINcoLN.
OFFICIAL ORDER.—All Cabmen plying within hail are to be supplied
with umbrellas by Government.
A SHORT WAY WITH SABBATARIANS.
If the Atherton Magistrates, who fined a farmer and his labourers
at Leigh, for saving hay on a Sunday, are not yet removed from the
Commission of the Peace, their neighbours might adopt a method of
dealing with their Worships which would probably have the effect of
bringing them to their senses. Are, the servants of those Justices
accustomed to render their masters and mistresses any menial services
whatever on Sunday beyond such as are absolutely necessary? If so,
let all those domestics, who can be ascertained to have so offended
against the statute which prohibits labour in a person's ordinary calling
on the “Sabbath,” be summoned before their own masters for that
offence. We shall see what Justice Shallow will say to John Thomas
charged with cleaning knives and forks or boots on a Sunday.
FREEDOM OF FEENCH OPINION.
THE Opinion, speaking of CHARLES MATHEws's success in L’Anglais
Timide, as all the more remarkable because he had not pre-puffed him-
self, observes:—
“The illustrious MATHEws, so well known in the three kingdoms, doubtless
thought it useless to have himself recommended in France. He did not know the
extent of our ignorance; the English read our journals and reviews; but we in
France do not read the Times, and that for good reasons.”
... Eh? “And that for good reasons.” That is strong language. Has
it not procured for L'Opinion the honour of a warning?
Composing a Strife.
A TELEGRAM from New York conveys the following important in-
formation:—
“The Mozart Hall Committee recommended the delegates of the State convention
to secure the union of the Democratic party by avoiding all contest.”
The principle which the Mozart Hall Committee appear trying to
carry out is one which must be allowed to be worthy of MozART. If
they could but establish harmony between North and South, they would
achieve a work worthy of the great Composer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FRIENCH LADY ON FEMALE I)RESS,
LITTLE did Mr. Panch ever think that he should live to praise the
observations of a French Marchioness on dress in a Fashion Book. It
is, however, with the most hearty approbation, that he quotes the
MARQUISE DE BERNIs, in the Paris Elégant, writing as follows:-
“We had better take care, or else we shall soon be transformed to boys, as far as
our dresses and costumes can produce the change. Already we wear boots, vests,
waistcoats, hats, stiff collars, flat sleeves, like college lads, and we are going to put
on their coats too !”
Punch is delighted with this exclamation against gentlemanlike boots
and—well, yests at present, as MADAME LA MARQUISE says; but it
will be boots and other vestments next, as she means to say. Bless
her! This charming lady continues:–
“The grand novelty at present is the coat—not as it is cut in the present day,
but in the Louis THE FourtEENTH shape—a sort of close paletot, cut short, with
skirts, and defining the waist. However, this new garment is longer than the sawt-
en-barque, or sailor's jacket.”
The taut-en-barque or sailor's jacket! Wery fit for the heroine in the
ballad of Billy Taylor; for “a lady fair and free,” or free and easy;
but not for a lady pure and simple. MADAME DE BERNIs th
describes the other thing, which is longer than the saut-en-barque, an
in describing condemns the ridiculous...oddity:-
“It is made of every kind of stuff and in every colour, but the most proper are
made to match the dress. Still better would it be to abolish it. This coat or habit
was formerly worn by ladies, but in a different manner. It was then worn as a
riding-dress, and put on over a long wide petticoat a queue, with very thick tucks.
Beneath it was a vest, and under that a man's shirt, with lace frill and sleeves,
besides a man's wig, descending in large curls or rings, and a felt hat cocked up
above the ear, with a white plume going round it.”
Can anything more absurd be conceived short of the accoutrements
of Guy Fawkes? So we shout in indignant disgust; but, the MAR-
QUISE DE BERNIS remarks mildly with subdued feeling:—
“That undoubtedly is a very masculine style of dress, but as a riding habit it has
always been considered very proper. But when converted into a walking or visiting
toilet it is a different matter, and I think it ought not to be adopted, without
reflection."
This is a gentle way of saying that it, is an execrably ugly [thing.
Indeed “it ought not to be adopted without reflection,” and the re-
flection of the looking-glass, one would think, might suffice to prevent
the most unreflecting idiot in Crinoline from adopting it. To continue,
however, a most admirable criticism:-
“For this there are several reasons, but one of them is enough, I think. Why
should we women remodel our exterior, since we claim to be the fairest half of the
human race? Let us continue to be woman, as God made us, borrowing nothing
from the other sex but one or two of the qualities and advantages which have fallen
to their share.”
Now, really, if it were not for the matchless nose and chin 'of Judy,
the paragon of her sex, Mr. Punch would envy Monsieur LE MARQUIs
DE BERNIs—unless the Marchioness is a widow. But can that be
Only by her own determination. How sensibly she writes' How
beautiful she must be, endowed as she is with so exquisite a sense of
propriety, in the decoration of beauty! But we beg her pardon for
interrupting her:-
“Some people pretend that our steel hoops are to be given up. Alas ! there are
as yet but few and faint signs of the release. However, there has been a rumour
that the crinolines would be laid aside, although the dresses were to continue long
and full and more flowing than ever.”
?
MADAME DE. BERNIs then" goes on to describe the arrangement
whereby Crinoline may perhaps be superseded, but which, it is to be
wished, will include, in the first place, the reduction of superfluous
drapery. She adds:—
“Should this desirable amendment become law, you will unite with me to hail
the reform, and rejoice at the removal of those iron machines by which our figures
have been transformed into fortresses, whilst they have been felt as a clog and a
anuisance to every one who approached us.”
A clog and a nuisance indeed when they constitute a lovely creature,
like the authores above quoted, a sort of out-door nun in a cage,behind
a grate |
How much longer will females persist in attire which is not only
ine, but mail? By the bye, with a view to bring the “clog and
nuisance” so delightfully, denounced by the MARQUISE DE BERNIs
into contempt, wouldn't it be a good plan for tayern-keepers, in choosing
signs for, their public-houses, instead of our old friend, “ The Hog-in-
Armour,” to substitute a pig of the softer sex, a pig in Crinoline, to be
called, the “Sow-in-Armour?”, A, good enough design, for the re-
quired painting might be furnished º many a Royal Academician. A
little above, mention was made of Guy Fawkes. Now, as Crinoline
tends to make a Guy of the wearer, could not Guy Fawkes be employed
as a vehicle for exposing it to derision on his approaching anniversary *
In one of Mr. Punch's talented sketches its capability of being repre-
sented by fireworks has been already suggested, and as an element in a
bonfire it would intimate a most admonitory moral.
A HELP TO HYMEN.
AccordLNG to the reports of the Registrar-General, marriages of late
have been somewhat on the increase. How far such advertisements as
that which we subjoin may have assisted towards this desirable result,
we leave those who like to do so quite at liberty to guess:—
How TO WIN A LOVER.—Post free for 26 Stamps (secure from
observation), the most curious work ever published in the English language,
entitled MATRIMONY MADE EASY. By following the directions contained
therein you can win as many of the opposite sex as you wish. All may be married,
irrespective of age, appearance, or position. And, in addition to the above, you will
also receive full particulars how to ascertain a person's true character and dispo-
sition. These secrets, once known, can be acted upon by any person. There is no
chance of discovery, and failure is impossible. Since introducing my valuable plan,
I find another person advertising and pretending to send something similar. It is
impossible. He cannot, dare not, advertise my secrets; being copyright, they are
the original and only genuine, and cannot be obtained from any one but myself.-
Address J. W., &c.
What a generous-hearted man must the advertiser be to sell so valu-
able a book at a price so very moderate. Surely the “most curious
English work ever published” ought to command a higher price than
six-and-twenty postage stamps, one or more of which would have to be
deducted for the cost of transit. We should have thought that, the
demand for the most curious, book extant could scarcely be supplied,
more especially considering the interesting mature of the subject which
is treated in it. Well, clearly we must say ſº to all our good old
bachelors, and pleasant nice old maids. With “Matrimony made easy.”
there will be soon none of them left. “Failure is impossible” in win-
ning either wife or husband, if one but carry out the plan of courtship
which J. W. suggests. Is it not expressly stated that, to those who
know his secret, “age, appearance, and position,” will prove no bar to
being loved ! Here is the Open Sesame to every sort of heart: whether
male or female, a tender one or tough. The only fear is that by follow-
ing the directions of J. W., there, may possibly be more hearts broken
than united. The power to win “as many of the opposite sex as may
be wished,” would prove, we fear, to some people a dangerous tempta-
tion: and as neither age, appearance, nor position would prevent them,
we might hear of an elderly maiden costermongeress with red hair
and a squint wearing out in hopeless passion an Adonis of a duke.

Ecclesiastical and Histrionic.
IN a newspaper paragraph it is stated that “the Bishop of Norwich
has commenced proceedings, against the Rev. G. DRURY, rector of
Claydon, Suffolk, for having introduced innovations into the celebration
of divine worship in the parish church.” Those innovations consisted
in the performances of the extraordinary clergyman who “styled him-
self the Rev. Brother IGNATIUS, O.S.B.” got himself up something
like a Roman Catholic Priest, and read the Liturgy as though he were
saying Mass., The Bishop, we presume, is down upon MR. DRURY, for
allowing his church to be turned by Brother IGNATIUS into a sort of
Drury Lane.

Sights in the City.—The best sight is unfortunately hidden from view.
It is the site upon which the City of Cologne stands. After this, the
Cathedral. Cologne Cathedral is older than the Nelson Column, but
is even in a less finished state. The order of architecture to which this
noble pile belongs was probably “Building by contract,” and one of the
parties failed. To describe it minutely would be tedious; we will
therefore say that the doors have a good deal of open-work about them,
and great panes have been taken with the windows. The only pointed
style in the Cathedral to attract the Tourist's notice will be that of his
Cicerone, by whom everything inside will be pointed out to him.
Caution.—Beware of the Suisse, that magnificent Esquire-Bedell in

The Choir is about 161 feet high; more than a hundred treble

In one of the side Chapels, where you'd naturally expect a piece of
sculpture by CHANTREy, you will find an old painting in Distemper.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ought to remon-

picture. Poor thing! in Distemper since 1410!
There’s plenty more to be seen, but you’ve got a pair of eyes we
suppose, and we really cannot stop here talking day... We saw
everything in the place, why shouldn’t you? Do you give it up? If
you do, come along somewhere else. As we suppose that you have of
course lost your luggage, it is not necessary that you should return to
your hotel, where you’d only have to pay your bill, and thus make
yourself uncomfortable on that score.
Notice—There are many books published now-a-days, informing the
tourist how to see the Continent for five or ten pounds in as many
weeks. We can tell him how to see it for nothing. Insist that the
steamboat brought you by mistake while you were saying good bye to
a friend; go away saying you’ll bring an action against them, and they'll
offer to take you back again; disdain their proffered courtesy; they’ll
be #: and offer you money not to tell; if they do, take it; if
not, they’ll be only too glad to put you on shore and get rid of you.
After this, unencumbered by packages, your course is easy. The hotel
is not built that can hold you for any length of time. You can tell the
various landlords that you are going out to look for your luggage, and
this search may reasonably take you many miles away from the place
where your last little bill was run up. The trains go so slow, that with
very little practice, you can easily get out during the journey, and thus
avoid all those absurd forms and ceremonies attendant upon rendering up
the ticket, which, as you, when travelling economically, do not possess,
would simply be a waste of time, and would materially retard an other-
wise rapid progress. Your foreign fellow-travellers will, if asleep, not
see you; for they have a way of closing their eyes when in a somnolent
state, and, in this P. resemble Englishmen. If their eyes are

The man who prodigally pays his way and tips the servants, is some-

will be looking out for you everywhere, they will be even anxious about
our health, and be desirous of seeing you again as soon as possible:
his is affecting, but don't stop for it. Hire some conveyance that will
gallop past the well-remembered, windows, whence, are peering the
old familiar faces. Be open-handed with them as befits your gene-
rous nature, and wave adieux from your fast, disappearing vehicle:
You can always get rid of the driver by asking him to get down and
pick up that parcel you’ve dropped in the road. When he has retraced
about three hundred feet of the road, jump into the box seat, crack
your whip, cry “Tchk!” and then once more urge on i. wild career.
You can sell the carriage and ride the horse, which after carrying you
some distance, will fetch asum that will enable you to travellike agentle-

German miles are different to English or Irish miles. In olden
times there was a league of barons, counts, and dukes, which must
have had as queer an effect as seven miles worth, of the aristocracy
would have in England. By this league all other distances were
measured; and the greatest distance was between the last baron and
the first shopkeeper. Leaveyour card upon the Chief Baron before the

A SABBATARIAN M.P.
“MR. PUNCH,
“ONE MR, Edward MATHEws has had the folly to publish,
in the Morning Post, nearly a column of impertinence headed “Closing
PUBLIC-Houses on. A SUNDAY, being the copy of a letter which he
took it upon himself to write to the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchequER,
inviting MR.GLADSTONE to be such a fool as to allow himself to be
numbered with the subscribers to an association seeking, by legal
means, to prohibit the Sunday traffic in, necessary, drinks., M.R.
MATHEws appends, to his intrusive twaddle the notice, which the
Minister condescended to take of it in the shape of a refusal written by
his Secretary. The sour drivel of MR. MATHEws is pervaded by the
same tone of pedantic restrictiveness as that which distinguishes the
generality of Sabbatarian demands for the abridgment of religious liberty.
“As an illustration of the humbug which MR. MATHEws, agitates,
let me call your attention to the subjoined story told by MR. Bass,
M.P., in the Chair at a public dinner, the other evening:—
| “On the evening of the division on MR. Somes's Motion, he (the chairman) was in
a down-stairs room in the House of Commons, where Honourable Members overcome
with fatigue, or oppressed by the eloquence of talking Members, sometimes assem-
bled to chat and smoke cigars (Cheers.) One gentleman there said to him, in refe-
rence to the subject of the Bill, “What — nonsense it is.’ (Loud cheers and laughter.)
Without swearing, however, he (the chairman) entirely agreed with this remark.
But when the House a few hours afterwards went to a division, he saw this gen-
tleman coming out of one end while he (the chairman) was coming out of the other.
The gentleman excused bimself by saying that there was no great harm in what he
was doing, as MR. Somes's party was sure to be in a minority.”
“And this blaspheming hypocrite who exclaims What — nonsense
SoMEs's Sunday Bill is 1 and then goes and votes for it, is a sample of
the representatives of Sabbatarianism in the House of Commons.
give MR. MATHEws and the Sabbatarian crew joy of their Honourable
Member, and would say to MR. Bass, ‘Name, name !” in order that
the fellow's constitutents, may not be misrepresented by him at the
next election. Believe me, Mr. Punch,

Compiled by an Old Bachelor of Forty Years' experience.

do with the ring of a parasol; can’t make out which.
TICKEN. Shawls are usually made of this, and those fancy, scarſs |

though only sixpence a yard. -
Gussets. Same as “Linsey Wolsey,” I think, a fine calf-skin leather

found once when I sat down on a bonnet made of it, mistaking the
thing for a bunch of flowers.
TULLE: Not yet sure of this, but suspect it is the needle they use in

satisfied myself it has something to do with a baby's bottle. Sometimes
it is called a “love of a barège.”

one is put on each year as the wearer grows too tall for the former length.

SPECIMEN OF AN IRISH HOWL.
“MR. PUNCH, SIR,
“WQUID you like to pollute your pages with the despicable
outpourings of a dirty American blackguard? Then print the subjoined
baseness from the Boston Commonwealth, written by that liar and
scoundrel, CHARLEs SUMTER:—
“We by no means contend that he (the Irishman in America) is equal in moral
and intellectual endowments to the coloured man ; but we insist that he is capable
of a good degree of improvement. When the demagogue is dead, then will be the
Copperhead's opportunity. Then we will bet on him (in small sums), and in the
race with Sambo, Patrick may save his distance.”
. “There ! That's how the fººd expectorates the infamy that’s
in him over the gallant exiles of Erin; the noble boys that shed their
heart’s best blood to fight the battles of his country with gratuitous
generosity. SUMTER and slander it is . Do you know a bigger black-
guard than CHARLEs. SUMTERº Do you know a bigger thief? Can
you, mention the name of a viler miscreant that walks the face of the
earth unhanged—or hanged? Was there ever a fouler libel than the
above in the Satirist f Did you ever read worse nonsense in the
Morning Starf
“The scurrilous and malignant detractor that penned the filthy calumny
which degrades the warmhearted Irishman below the par of the nigger
when he wrote it was drunk. He had been carousing in a house of
for thieves, whence he reeled to his desk, reeking with gin, and having
bedaubed a page of foolscap with his foul invective, rolled hiccuping, |L
cursing, swearing, and senseless on the floor, and there inhaled the
spirits which he had previously tippled. Bad luck to the abusive
jackass, the contemptible compound of brute, beast, and ſool! With
thanks for your courtesy in inserting this remonstrance, believe me,
Mr. Punch, Sir, your ever grateful correspondent,
“PATRICK O’BLETHEREMSKITE.”
*...* We indulge MR. O'BLETHEREMsKITE by printing his invective,
| because it affords, we regret to say, a fair sample of the phraseology
in which an Irish fool expresses himself when irritated by aught that
he conceives to be disparagement of his country. But is our raving cor-
respondent quite sure that the gentleman whom he calls so many bad
names personally wrote the passage which has aroused his fury!? And
does he consider that what is said of the Irishman in America is of
necessity equally applicable to all Irishmen? So seemingly think sun-
dry, Irish journalists even less reasonable and temperate than MR.
Q’BLETHEREMSKITE, who, in terms more violent, than his own, vilify
Punch for having, as they affect to suppose, called Irishmen in general
the scum of the earth. Mr. Punch cannot say that they do not really
imagine that he did so. There is no assigning bounds to human folly.
Would Punch call the DUKE of WELLINGTON scum of the earth, SwſFT
scum of the earth, BURKE scum of the earth, GoLDSMITH, SHERIDAN
ToM MooRe scum of the earth? Perhaps those frantic gentlemen o
the Irish press unfeignedly believe that he would. Mr. Punch hopes
that they are ingenuous idiots. He certainly does call some Irishmen
scum of the earth. He calls mercenary cutthroats scum of the earth,
whether they are Irish, or Germans, or whatever part of the earth they
may happen to arise from. He owns that he considers the emigrant
Irish ruffianry the scum of the earth. But truculent vituperation con-
vinces him that the scum of the earth has not all leſt Ireland.

MYSTERIES OF MEDICINE.
THE Medical Profession, iſ it is a learned one, may have
been amused by the following advertisement, which lately
adorned the Medical Circular:—
AIº-ºh, discoverers of this, T. & H. SMITH, (vide
Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science, for February, 1851,)
the crystaline principle of aloes, continue to prepare and supply it.
They have the gratification of knowing that the most eminent of
the Profession prescribe it in preference to the various kinds of
aloes, and especially to females both alive and in a combined form.
We learn from the above announcement that the dis-
coverers of Aloina are T. & H. SMITH, and that those
gentlemen are also the crystalline principle of aloes. More-
over we observe that they spell crystalline with a single l.
And they seem to say that the crystalline principle of aloes
continues to prepare and supply Aloina.
What the discoverers of Aloina mean by females in a
combined form, we cannot make out. In saying that “the
most eminent of the Profession” prescribe Aloina, “espe-
cially to females both alive and in the combined form,”
. place females “in the combined form" in antithesis
with females “alive.” Hence we might infer that by
females in the combined form,” they meant dead women:
but as medicine is never prescribed for the dead of either
sex, that inference would be absurd.
The discoverers of Aloina are doubtless expert in phar-
macy, so that we will not say that they have mistaken their
vocation; but they might have chosen a branch of learning
for the cultivation of which their genius appears much
better calculated than it is for the pursuit of chemical
science. We do not mean English grammar: but meta-
physical theology.
“Happy Land!"
At the opening of the Session of the two Legislative
Chambers, the KING of Hollan D is reported to have said:
“Various bills will be presented to you with a view to a general
reduction of taxes.”
Would that our CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER would
be animated with the above good example ! However, we
fancy we hear GLADSTONE, catechised on the subject, ex-
claiming, with Homeric fire, “If ever you catch me reducing
the Income-Tax, why then I’m a Dutchman.”
CRINOLINE AND COSMETICS.
“DEAR PUNCH, - -
“I AM a young man, and have a fairish income, and I want to
find some fair creature to share it. But I declare to you I really am so
frightened by advertisements that I can hardly summon up the pluck
to i. in quest of her. Not to mention the announcements of milliners
and jewellers, which in a money point of view are terrible enough, there
are other dreadful notices addressed to the fair sex, which really make
one's flesh creep when one thinks of getting married. By Jove, if one
believes in half that is hinted in the newspapers, girls are nowadays all
sham, there’s nothing real about them. They buy their hair of Mon-
sIEUR CoIFFEUR, and their teeth of Monsieur DENTIFRICE; MADAME
CRINoLINE supplies them with a figure, and MADEMOISELLE ENAMELLE
furnishes the face. One shopkeeper sells eyebrows that are warranted
to stick, while another supplies roses to beautify the cheeks, warranted
to bear even inspection through a microscope. As for hair dyes, they
are numberless, and so are curling fluids; and somebody keeps puffing
some patent hair restorative, which he begs us to observe is ‘recom-
mended by the faculty,’ and is held in high estimation in the higher
circles.” Besides this, there’s the “pomadore, for beautifying the arms
and bands or face, without causing tº. slightest unnatural appearance,’
and in addition there’s the ‘eye fluid,” which some genius has invented,
and which serves not merely for concealment of crows' feet, but to give
great “boldness, character, and seeming enlargement’ to that “index of
character’ which we more simply call the eye. -
“Now Crinoline is bad enough, and an awful thing it is for a young
bachelor to contemplate the laceration of his ancles and destruction of
his trousers, which will infallibly result from his walking arm in arm
with the steel-begirt young creature he consents to call his wife. But,
nuisance though it be, Crinoline is not half so nasty as Cosmetics. A
sham figure is more tolerable by far than a sham face. Just conceive a
man's disgust at finding that his wife changed colour when he kissed
her, and that her rosy cheeks turned yellow if he touched them with his
lips. Who would care to marry a beautiful complexion, if he knew it
had been purchased in the Burlington Arcade; and how can one admire
a snowy brow or swanlike neck when one believes it to be whitewashed,
say, at sixpence the square inch P What a pleasant thing for Corydon
WOL, XLV.
to find his Chloe minus her left eyebrow some fine morning, or showing
two large crows-feet which had been concealed by paint J. Don't you
think he would be justified in going to his club to breakfast for the
future, and if he lived there altogether, I for one should not much
censure him. I think, SIR JAMES PLAISTED WILDE would hardly call
it cruelty for a man to leave a wife whom he detected using paint. A
girl who sails under false colours when cruising for a husband 1 con-
sider should be viewed in the light of a she-pirate, and should be driven
to surrender any prize that she might take.
“No, no, Mr. Punch. You have influence with the ladies, if anybody
has; and I wish you would just tell them that when they use cosmetics
to beautify themselves they only make themselves more ugly than by
nature they would be. Men like beauty, no doubt; but then to please
their eyes it must be beauty without paint. So, far as flesh and blood
go, what a man wants in a wife is something huggable and kissable,
and Crinoline and Cosmetics quite prevent her being this. A cheek
like a blush rose is a pleasant thing to look upon; i. I have little
liking for artificial flowers, and have certainly no wish for one to deco-
rate my table. Far rather would I stick to my Old Bachelor's Button
than sit down to dinner daily with sham roses to look at. Let others
praise the cerea brachia of Chloe, or any other specimens of Miss
ENAMELLE's skill in wax-work; I for one would have my wiſe as
Beatrice would have her husband, one not for Sunday show but for
honest week-day use. As for paint attracting lovers, I am sure it only
serves to frighten them away. Who with lips that are by nature capable
of kissing would ever dream of paying his addresses to a girl with
‘touch me not.’ quite plainly painted on her face?. The misletoe will
soon be an extinct institution, if girls persist in trying to make them-
selves unkissable by colouring their cheeks. One would as soon salute
the Wall in Pyramus and Thisbe, as kiss a painted powdered, beauty
who purchased her complexion, and put on an extra smear when she
wanted to look smart. For myself I shall keep single until the rage
for paint-brushes and powder-balls is over; and I recommend the fellow
who is caught by a complexion to ponder well, ere marrying, the moot-
point, Will it Wash?

“I have often visited Glasgow. I consider it the capital of England.
LANG's luncheon place, where there are three hundred and sixty-five
pleasant ways oflº. your dinner, is an institution to which London
el. LO
can show no par u get everything, from bawbee cookies to turtle
soup, and you need not speak a word—you take the article, which has
its price marked, you do your own reckoning, and you hand the money
to a smiling young lady. To a silent and shy man like myself, this
system is very pleasing. They trust in your honesty, but I suppose
they do not tempt it too far, and that some sort of eye is kept on you.
But the man must be a mean wretch who would cheat where the articles
are so good that he is not cheated....Then there’s the Exchange...They
have been spoiling its handsome pillars by painting them in a ludicrous
manner, and making the hall look like a music saloon, but the courtesy
of Glasgow in providing all the newspapers in the world for the accom-
modation of visitors and the military is beyond praise. Where can an
officer and a gentleman, or either, see the papers for nothing, in
London P. St. Rollox's Chimney, whence f dated my last, is twice as
high as the Monument, and TENNANT's is taller still, and there is
no three-pence to pay for going to the top of either, because there is no
way to the top, a great advantage over the London erection. Then you
can't wash yourself in London. I declare I never wash to º: of.
In Glasgow there is a bath-room in every house, and the lovely water
of the lovely lake, Loch Katrine, is ſaid on to the very top of every
dwelling. This water you may seementioned in your Times every week,
as only an infinitesimal fraction less pure than distilled water. It is soft,
and the ladies say saves a third of the expense of washing garments, but
I never knew any reform extend to details, and shirts are four-pence, as
in London. I do not like it as drink so much as I could wish, but with
an equal quantity of whiskey it is a satisfactory preventive of the des-
truction of tissue. The marmalade is excellent, so are the baps, so
are the Glasgow magistrates (resh herrings), and so, I believe, are the
sermons, or some of them. . The Cathedral is not Westminster Abbey;
how could it be P. But it is a grand thing, though it would be as well
iſ the heraldry in the new painted, windows were right instead of false,
as the LoRD Lyon King-at-Arms pathetically says it is. The monument
to old ALEXANDER, the manager, is sweet, much better than that to old
DUCRow in Kensal Green, and represents the proscenium of a theatre,
with the curtain down, and as every Scotch friend who shows it you,
tells you some capital story about “Old ALEc,” there is immense fun
enacted before this memorandum of the lamented histrio. SIR ARchi-
BAID Holystos E—I pretermit question of his historical writings—is a
genial and virtuous dispenser of justice, and the organ in the City Hall,
when played upon by MR, LAMBERT, a quarter in which I see łº, (for
once) bestowed deserved compliment, roars delectable music. ... I repeat
that the superiority of Glasgow over London is indisputable, and I
should certainly adopt the former as my residence, only that I am too
old to acquire a foreign language, and I do not like to be taken to a
police cell for sneezing in the street on a Sunday.
“SIR John MooRE, of whom you may have heard, was born in a place
called Donald's Land, in Glasgow. This was an old, ſashioned tene-
ment, now demolished, which stood nearly opposite. Tron Steeple, on
the north side of Trongate. The information may have interest for you,
though it has hitherto failed to excite me very much. There is, how-
ever, a fine poem on his burial, the recitation whereof by anybody except
myself, excites mevery much indeed, by reason of its º: badness.
I think I have heard you attempt it, late in the evening, Friends at a
distance will please accept this intimation.
“Taking a drive in the country; ſheard something which I may as well
repeat. My friend pointed with his cigar (if it was as good as one he
had given me, he was to be congratulated), to an open place which he
said had been the spot where acouple of Irishmen, whose names I have
no reason to remember, were dismissed from this world in testimony of
the recognition, by law, of their having, unlawfully, performed similar
service to a compatriot. Allwere of the railway-navigating persuasion.
There being some thousands of other Irishry in the neighbourhood, and
the distaste of that race for the formalities which Englishmen and
Scotchmen, call justics, being known, an attempt at rescue, or at all
events at riot, was expected, or had been menaced. Certain military
provision for keeping things serene was made, but it occurred to me
that the serenity of the last minister of law had not been so completely
considered. For a couple of guns, loaded with grape, were so laid that
on the first rush at the scaffold, the discharge would have swept away
the entire tableau, hangman, criminals, rescuers, and gallows. The
presence of the arguments, however, sufficed, and it was not necessary
to employ them. Hibernici fuerunt.
“I head another and a cognate story. Two: Scottish judges having
tried a man for some atrocious offence, one of them lº. the duty
of sentencing him. The evidence that had convinced the jury curiously
failed to convince the culprit, who grumbled that “there was no getting
justice.” “I beg your pardon, my man,’ said the other judge, ‘ye'll
just get justice on Wednesday morning, July the tenth, at eleven
o'clock.” I doubt whether our late learned friend, who was thought to
have burned Paper Buildings, Temple, could have retorted with more
pleasing and affable neatness.
“If you are going to protest against my retailing what I heard, in-
stead of describing what I saw, protest and — home, as Lord
ELLENBoRough said to the witness... I am out for a holiday, after
nearly ruining my originally fine constitution in your service, and my
writing at all is one of those works of supererogation which ought not
to be criticised. You must not look a giſt letter in the anecdote. Of
course, you can omit the paragraphs. Do, and see how many more 1

admit it. I feel grim. I feel like Giant Grim, in the Pilgrim's Progress.
I am sitting in face of a mountain, which I can't see for the mist, and it
is raining violently, and I am full dressed, with my new patent leather
boots on, and the hour has come for a dinner to which I am invited (on
my private worth and merit, and not at all because I happen to amuse
myself occasionally by throwing off sparkling little things for Mr.
Punch) and no vehicle, or as they call it here, machine, can be got for
love or money. My friend who is going with me is a Highlander, and
wears ‘the garb of old Gaul, and has brought ‘the fire of old Rome.”

which would involve my walking three-quarters of an hour without
those things in respect whereof we appeal to gods and little fishes to
say what man is who lacks such protection. He says I can put them
on upon the stairs at the mansion we are going to. I do not like the
picture. There ought to be a cab-stand at every mountain in Scotland,
and I shall write to the Lord Advocate about it. You might do some-

and I suppose none of your artists ever saw a mountain, except in a
romantic opera. I must go to this dinner, though, for I have thought
over some very smart things to say, and they have local application
and will not do elsewhere. I have rehearsed them with my IIighlan
friend, and he is going to lead up to me, so that I may play my diamonds.
This is true loyalty—how different from the conduct of some London
men I could name, who always try to spoil a friend's jeur d'esprit. Two
can play that game, however, and I am one of them, and that’s a
comfort in this kindly world. I do not know whether my wit, (which
is, I am aware, subtle almost to imperscrutability) is always appre-
ciated here, but my intention to be delightful is, and is recognised in
the warmest manner, but then Highlanders are gentlemen and ladies,
and not spiteful Bohemians or envious Pumps. I express myself
mildly, and make no allusions, but your conscience will remind you of
the social murder of my epigram about the Frenchman and the mutton

“Having given you every reason why I should remain in Glasgow,
you will not be surprised that I took an early opportunity of leaving
that metropolis. I embarked myself, and encumbrances, one morning,
at seven, in a vast floating drawing-room called the Iona, which is the
most splendid boat that ever was reflected in these eyes of mine. I
took my seat on the crimson velvet cushions of the saloon, which is a
glass chamber, on deck, so that you can behold all the scenery without
discomfort of wind or rain. “Well done, MR. DAVID HUICHESQN,’
said I, and now for a delightful voyage north.” The words had
scarcely left my lips when I was informed by one who had the best
reason to know, that of our thirteen boxes, one had been left at our
Glasgow apartments, and also that it was the only one of the thirteen
that would be of the least use where we were to lodge that night. The
Iona was just on the move. To make a brief reference to Job, to fling
away my inverness cape, to stamp till the Iona's deck quivered, to gaze
wildly at the Broomielaw, to spring to shore, to dash, into a cab, to
regain my thirteenth box, to take it to the Greenock railway, to go with
it, to re-embark at that interesting port, and to throw myself upon
salmon steaks and hot coffee, was the work of—I don't exactly know

“FANCY FAIRs.”—The ever-varying Fares of our Street Cabs.
MATRIMONY MADE EASY.
For the subjoined announcements we are indebted to the Manchester
Eraminer and Times:—
- MATRIMONY.
THE Advertiser, good looking (25), wishes to correspond with a Young
Lady, with a view to Matrimony.—Address — Post Office, Bradford.
MATRºº, AGENCY OFFICE.-Now on our books, a minister,
age 30, position good; medical student (26), about to begin practice; professor
of music (23), earning £150 a year; widower (48), has property, lady not to be
under 40; jeweller (27), stock worth £800; working man, has E180. The above,
for special reasons, all require wives with fortunes, more or less. Agentleman (28),
income £800, requires character, education, &c.; money no object, Six ladies, with
fortunes, and 58 others. Choice made from photographs. Fee 2s. 6d.; ladies from
18. 6-to-10. Manchester.
The Advertiser, author of the first of these notifications, appears, we
are sorry to say, to be little, if anything, above the level of an animal.
He assumes that good looks and youth are sufficient attractions to induce
some Young Lady to answer his advertisement “with a view to matri-
mony.” So, very, likely, they are for a girl who simply wants to be
married, and to whom one man of the herd is as good as another. Such
a creature, being of the herd herself, will be suitably matched with such
a man. But, as they are two-legged animals, let us say flock instead of
herd, and trust that the good-looking advertiser and his desired mate
| will prove a happy couple of geese.
The second of the foregoing matrimonial announcements looks like
business: especially when considered in connection with the following,
ex from the Glasgow Herald:—
MATRIMONY.
ATRIMONIAL AGENCY OFFICE. – Now on our books, 11
widowers, 7 widows, 16 men of wealth who want youth and beauty, 9 ladies
with fortunes, an orphan with £3,000, a widow with £200 a year, a curate (income
£200), 7 Dissenting ministers, and 37 others. The demand for ladies continues.
They may apply by letter or person, in confidence, as this business will be con-
ducted in a bonā fide private and respectable manner. Choice made from photo-
graphs, then interviews arranged. Fee 2s. 6d. ; ladies, from 1s. 6 to 10. – Cot-
tenham Street, off Ardwick Green.
MONEY WANTED.
We have preserved, above, the heading of an advertisement that
succeeds that immediately foregoing. In both of the preceding adver-
tisements Matrimony” to a great extent may be considered to resolve
itself into “Money Wanted,” but both of them seem addressed to per-
sons rather in want of money. In matrimonial advertisement No. 1,
the “professor of music (23), earning £150 a-year,” can be no great
catch, and the same may be affirmed of the “jeweller (27), stock worth
£800.” The “working man” who “has £180” is eligible as a prolé-
taire. “A gentleman (28), income £300, requires character, education,
&c.”—does he? He requires more, then, we are afraid, than he is
likely to get. To expect, not only character and education, but also
&c., at £300 a-year, even if that income is derived from, fixed property,
is to be very sanguine; and to add “money no object,” argues fatuity.
How can this advertiser be such a fool as to think that any lady, in
these days of Crinoline, would marry a man who not only proposes to
maintain her on £300 a-year, but also not to care for the means of
affording her a more luxurious maintenance? We should like to see
the photographs of the “six ladies with fortunes,” and, if they are not
all hideous, to know what vices of temper have kept any of those for-
tunate, ladies, unwillingly single. The “widower (48),” who “ has
property,” and wants a “lady not to be under 40” is evidently a great
fool. If, indeed, his property being very small, he were willing to
marry, any woman of any age, the older the better, there would be
something to be said for his mere gumption. But, being forty-eight
years of age, he ought to know better than to wish to marry at all,
unless from a base and mercenary motive. This widower must be very
unwise, or he would not have advertised for a wife not likely to leave
him, with her money, a widower again very speedily.
In advertisement, No. 2, the second-hand wives and husbands are
probably cheap and inferior. The “16 men of wealth who want youth
and beauty” will be sure enough to get what they want, if they have
wealth enough to give for it, in Belgravia and Tyburnia. The orphan
with £3,000 is likely to be much inquired for. Even a poor orphan is
a prize to any man who wants to marry without letting himself in for a
mother-in-law. A rich orphan is a treasure in proportion to her wealth
—and worth. No wonder there is only one orphan on the list. Orphans
are snapped up. The “Curate (income £200)” must be avery bad-looking
man, or he might have thrown the handkerchief to any one of a multi-
tude of young ladies busy working him slippers. We see with some
surprise that “the demand for ladies continues.” A style of dress. at
once grotesque and expensive, and a too general affectation of masculine
airs, would, we should have feared, render that demand, mode-
rate. The Matrimonial Agency Office, however, does not say that it is
large; only that it continues. It may continue not brisk, but only as
usual, and that may be flat. We have now used a word which some
may be disposed to apply to any one who, for a wife or a husband,
resorts to a Matrimonial Agency Office. .

merely under the influence of BISMARCK. He is too evidently under the

advertise for a Bottle.

UNDER the signature of “A CoMMUNICANT OF THE ENGLISH
CHURCH,” a Correspondent of the Morning Post complains of “the
deliberate and strenuous efforts which are now being made by some
Clergymen of an extreme party, or section of a party, to assimilate the
principal services in their Churches to the Romish service of the
mass.” . The party alluded to in the foregoing passage is that which
has been stupidly named Puseyites. Let its misnomer be rectified in
subordination to analogy and precedent, The followers of Wesley
were not called Wesleyites. . Why should those of Pusey be termed
Puseyites? The members of the sect founded by DR. Pusey, who in
matters ecclesiastical practise a method of their own, had much better
be called Puseyan Methodists.

, “A REALLY SWEET THING IN WATERING
PLACES.”
(From a Missing Contributor.)
“DEAR P., “5, Castle Terrace, Ilfracombe.
“You have not heard from me for the last week or two, -[It
is nearer six weeks than one. Ed.]—and may have been uncomfortable
about ... [Nº. about you, but about your contributions. Ed.]—Be
comforted. I have been so very comfortable, and yet I have been at
the Sea-side. Of course you know those fine lines in LUCRETIUS:-
“Suave mari magno,” &c. &c.
—[Of course I do, but I don't see how they apply. Ed]-Well, I have
never felt their full force so much, I think, as while enjoying the perusal
of your amusing periodical—[This is intolerable impertinence. Ed.]—
on the shores of the lovely place from which I write. I see your cuts
and columns full of complaints, satire, invective, against the evils, of
the stock Sea-side haunts in which the exhausted Londoner, about this
time seeks much-needed refreshment from a sniff of the bring fit
is easy to perceive his aim, in this side plea for his own laziness. Ed.]—
the exactions of the lodging-house keepers, the length of the hotel-
bills, the sameness of the amusements and occupations, the street-cries,
the airs and graces of the visitors, the pervading. snobbery and ennui
of London-Super-Mare. - -
“When you kindly gave me leave to recruit my worn-out brain—[He
took it a la Française. Ed.]—in a brief absence at the Sea-side, I spent
some days (which I feel cannot, fairly, be counted in my holidays) in
making up my mind whither to betake myself. I had done Brighton,
and #. had done me, to death. The Steyne had entered into
my soul, and the Esplanade was weariness to me—the swarming of the
flies, the shrillness of the street-cries, the streams of Crinolines and
Pork-pie hats—you remember HoRACE’s–
“Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis a vum ?”-
—[Of course we do, then why quote it? Ed]—its lodging-house bills,
the smell of soup and pies from MUTTON’s, the china and pebbles
in the shop-windows, the riding-masters, their screws and bevies of
pupils;–was not every feature of the wearisome place stamped on my
much-enduring brain P
‘. Of St. Leonards I had still bitterer recollections. , I remembered it
duller than Brighton, its lodgings drearier, its bills longer, its amuse-
ments even more limited and monotonous. Margate and Ramsgate
were out of the question, if only for the organ-men. Herne Bay has
lost its one charm of solitude, since a º has brought people to
that once, howling, wilderness. Sandgate, I am told, and believe,
comprises in little all that is objectionable and dull in the places I have
enumerated. . So I determined at last on taking a wider flight,
and trusting for an extension of leave and punctuality in weekly remit-
tances to your unfailing indulgence, have ventured to these remoter
regions, of North Devon. I am at Ilfracombe. I have found here—
what I had no previous experience of, and hardly believed to exist—a
Sea-side place where I have been quite as happy, and almost, if not
quite, as comfortable as if I had stayed at home.
“You know how I love nature, [We were not aware of it, except as
he has been in the habit of pleading it, occasionally, in excuse for short
copy and absences without leave. Ed.]—and you will therefore be glad
to hear that Ilfracombe combines, in its coast and inland scenery,whatever
is sternest with whatever, is loveliest in landscape. The coast is a
succession of bays, formed by the wildest headlands of shattered, and
twisted rock. (grauwacke of the clay-slate formation, as you will re-
member).-[The shallow parade of scientific knowledge, like the vulgar
habit of Latin quotation, seems to be incurable in this contributor.
Ed.]—A, member of the Alpine Club may here enjoy the privilege of
risking his neck, quite as freely and at far less cost than in the High
Alps; and the lover of adventure within half an hours walk of the
harbour may find twenty places, where in the pursuit of the retiring
zoophyte, or the contemplation of the tenacious limpet, he may ‘fleet
the time carelessly, as they did in the golden age” †(you remember
Amiens and Ardennes),-till he finds himself cut off by the tide, and will
have the excitement of rock-climbing under every variety of difficulty,
and with the stimulus of self-preservation to improve his gymnastic
powers. For the lovers of marine gardening, this is the nursery. Here
the sea-anemone expands its many-coloured petals; the polype waves
its delicate ciliae, and the madrepore spreads its snowy branches.—[I
have here struck out two pages of Marvels # the Sea-shore, evidently
extracted from some popular compendium. Ed.]
+ * * * *
“Turning from these scientific pursuits, if I seek more exciting
sport, it is open to me in fishing, for the gover, or whiting-pout, an
amusement dear to the contemplative mind,-when the attendant opens
the mussels, which I am free to admit, is a slob and unsavoury
process. I am told the streams which sparkle through the Combes all
about the place, contain small but lively trout. But after many years
of hope deferred, I have grown sceptical as to the existence of fish in
inland English waters, and I cannot say from experience that the
rivulets of Ilfracombe are any exception to the general law.
“But the country walks are endless, and full of beauty. Instead of
the dreary downs, which back your South-Coast watering-places, great,
bare, lumps of chalk, with nothing more exciting than a flock of sheep,
or a flight of plovers, to enliven their waste, -here you have a rolling
country of hill and hollow—the hills breaking into bold rocky forms,
the hollows, musical with streamlets, and feathered, with the prettiest
ash and oak copses. If you weary of the paths—and they are endless—
the fields seem to invite the trespassers. A padlock on a gate appears
hardly known, and the clay-slate fences are delightfully easy knocking
down. It seems to be a fashion of this easy-going Devonshire to have
three or four roads to every place, and they run, as if their planners had
had a great sense of beauty, and none whatever of the value of time.
Then the botanist—above all the fern-hunter-(by the way I should be
º obliged, if you would suggest to MEssrs. BRADBURY AND
Eva Ns, that a presentation copy of their Ferns, Nature-Printed, would be
highly º finds himself, here, in a very embarras de richesses.
Every dyke is fringed with the green tongues of the Scolopendrium;
in the chinks of the slate-fences nestles the delicate little maiden-hair
(Adiantum Capillus Weneris), while the tall fronds of the lordly
Osmunda regalis—" *—[Again we omit several pages of rhapsody
º rubbish—borrowed, again, from some manual on the sub-
Ject. Ea.
“But I must tear myself from the delights of the country—to sing
the praises of the town. It is clean, picturesque, and as yet in that
state of youthful ingenuousness, which precedes the corruption of the
full-grown watering-place. The price of provisions is appreciably less
than in London. Would a turkey or Michaelmas goose be an accept-
able present? If so, say so, and send me the money, and I will
promise you a choice one. (You may as well make it a P.O. order for
a sovereign, and we can settle the difference on my return).-[Trust

“There is a Local Board of Health, which, strange to say, seems to
be enterprising and active, keeps the streets clean, and has constructed a
public sea-walk, or parade, in excellent taste, with seats in all direc-
tions. There is a band engaged for the season, which plays, and §: very
well, at hours, and keeps out the unlicensed greenbaize and
Italian intruder. Nay, the place is still infantine enough to be sociable
and there are soirées, every now and then, when visitors dance an
make acquaintance, and even, as I am given to understand, go the
lengths of flirtation. Toilette is ad libitum. I go about in my usual
picturesque deshabille,_[Which his friends call disreputable slovenli-
mess. Ed.]—and do not find that I attract more attention than in

make a guy of yourself you can, and will find no want of countenance.
Basket carriages and boats abound, but don't persecute you by touting
for hire, and donkeys are abundant at ºgº. an hour. They too are
in perſection like everything else in this Sea-side paradise, being the
very slowest and stupidest donkeys I ever saw. But they seem tenderly
cared for by the old women who preside over them, and if the invalid
wants peristaltic motion of the lower viscera, the donkey chairs can be
recommended. When taken the rider is sure to be well shaken. -

not expatiate on our private comforts in that most comfortable of

she charges me neither for cruets, kitchen-fire, nor passage-lamp!

P and down the River Rhine,
In and out the vessel, that’s
the way the money, goes.
Stop! Überwesell and there
we are at a half-way house
on the Rhine. We may call
one of the inns by this name,
as it is partly hotel, .
dairy, or as it maybe termed,
half beer half-whey House.
While hateau-ā-papeuring
up the Rhine, we will make
a few observations on
Steam-boat travelling.
The one general rule that
governs all voyagers by
Steam-boat is, “No one
must speak to the Man at
the Wheel; ” but you may
whistle at him, howl at him,
shout at him, or dance before
him as much as you like.
It is the part of genius to
break through rules; there-
fore if you would not be set
down for a mere commonplace Tourist, take pity upon his isolated con-
dition, and commence an animated conversation with the steerer.
Whisper soft nothings in his ear; tell him that “good thing you
heard the other day,” and point your jokes with your forefinger under
his fifth rib. -
You may wave your hat and holloa in front of him; this is a very
good way of cheering him upon his lonely voyage. -
An you, understand not his language, nor he yours, make faces at
him until he roars with laughter, and finish by singing to him in your
best style, “O Wheellie, we have missed you !” when he, being of a
sympathetic soul, will join you in the melody, playing rhapsodically
upon the spokes of his wheel. Others on board may laugh and be
jolly, but he remains throughout the one stern passenger, unless as we
have suggested, you can overcome his unnatural reserve. He seldom
moves from his position, yet is he perpetually taking a turn on deck.
We never met anybody who knew one of these men “at home.” . We
cannot help thinking that they have run away from the domestic circle.
Maybe, for some dark crime, they are undergoing a self-enforced silent
system, rendered all the more difficult, of endurance by the oppor-
tunities of communication with their fellow men which their situation
offers. In consequence of the Helm obeying the will of this Roving
Recluse, the Germans have but one generic name for the class, every
individual member of which they address as Will-Helm Meister.
Steamboat travelling differs from Railroad travelling, inasmuch as the
authorities of the
former take you on
trust, not demand-
ing your fare until
they have carried
you for some dis-
tance upon the voy-
age. The first feel-
ing produced by this
system in the breast
of an honest English-
man is gratitude to
the beneficent beings
who, apparently, are
going to give you a
trip for nothing. On
the approach of the
inevitable money
collector, this senti-
ment is entirely su-
perseded by a desire
to avail your-self of
those facilities...of
personal locomotion
which a deck affords,
to dodge the official,
and avoid that mu-
tual unpleasantness
and misunderstand-
ing which must re- -

Here we come alongside of the bank, and for a minute or two we
must touch upon this point.
It is a dear or rather cheap, at least we found it so, old place called
St. Goar. You will, perhaps smile at any of the Rhine show-places
being cheap, and will say ironically “Go-ar-long!” but nevertheless
such is the fact. .
Hereabout there is a whirlpool which tumultuously eddies round a
horrid rock. Hence the proverb “'Tis the Lurlei Berg catches the
Whirl.”. We heard a Cockney drop an H and a remark to the effect
that it “made him quite 'eddy to look at it.”

“That?” you reply, pretending that you haven’t been cramming up
the Rhine history over-night. “That is Bishop RATTo's Castle, so

In Steamboat Travelling, a rug, a great coat, a portable bath, a
carpet bag, a hatbox, a portable writing-case, race glasses, an umbrella,

make himself thoroughly uncomfortable. He sits on his camp stool,
wraps himself up in his rug and great coat, places his portable bath on
his hatbox and his feet on the portable bath, settles his writing-desk on

sHADows of THE week.
... We are living in the nineteenth century, we believe. Mr. Punch is
living in the nineteenth century, he believes; yet feels certain that if it
were the two-hundred and nineteenth century, the censure he would be
obliged to pass upon the people's superstitious practices would be of pre-
cisely the same character. Men and women of Sible Hedingham
forsooth' a very slight, alteration in the spelling would mark them for
ever as the folks of Silly Headingham. In the so-called dark ages a
person of either sex supposed to have devoted his or her time to witch-
craft, was himself or herself considered as a witchcraft with powers of
floating on the water. These powers were constantly being tested by
unmerciful immersion; and now in these days, when the public mind is
so far illuminated, and the brain is made so clear, that the result appears
to be a general light-headedness, the ignorant country people again
resort to the trial of a supposed witch by water, which trial will result
in another by jury, that they perhaps had scarcely expected.
There has been a reaction in the theatrical world. Drury Lane and
the Strand have produced a F. a-piece. Let any one who finds the
present time in London intolerably dull, enliven and interest himself by
paying a visit, and something else, to the former of these two theatres, and
seeing MR. BELMORE as Jacob Vance, the Deal Boatman of Drury Lane,
Ordinary points in the delineation of the rough old wrecker which would
have been seized upon by the superficial and stagey actor, he has care-
fully, almost to a fault, avoided. Hence in some parts of the play he
appears to lack force where a conventionalist would have torn his passion
to rags and tatters. MR. G. BELMoRE, Cannot do well more, To make it
tell more. By the way, some brilliant theatrical satellite of a maturinai
luminous contemporary, for whose opinion, when it coincides with our
own, we entertain, the most profound respect, has made, as might be
expected, rather “a shine” about a resemblance, which according to his
lights, he ſancied that he had discovered, between the story of The
Deal Boatman and the beautiful episode of Old Peggotty and Little En’ly
in David Copperfield. How striking this likeness must be, our readers
will gather from the following self-evident parallels.
Jacob Vance, of Drury Lane, is a long-shore man
wrecker; Mr. Peggotty is and was nothing of
Mance belongs to a class of Deal Boatman-wrecker, shortly described
in an old nautical tale, and in a well-known History of Kent; and, as
Mr. Peggotty belongs to Yarmouth, of course he doesn’t. Mary
Pance, of Drury Lane, was found at sea, and turns out to be a
Baronet's, daughter; Little Bºy wasn't, and doesn't. Leslie runs
away with and then marries Mary Wance of. Drury. Lane; Steer-
forth runs away with, and then runs away from Little Em’ly of Yarmouth.
and has been a
the sort. Jaco;
The similarity between the female Peggotty and Mrs. Bridgett, of
Drury Lane, consists chiefly in the fact that there are two Ts in either
name; the likeness may, in this instance, be considered as perfect to a T.
Goodness gracious us! Did not these critical eyes see how the resem-
blance was carried out, not only on the *: ut through the entire
theatre of Drury Lane How is it that they failed to perceive the
*:::: between Prescott, the expectant villain of the drama,
and Mr. Micawber of the novel, who is always waiting for “some-
thing to turn up”?
Again, Mr. Tom Grimaldi, Mathews, who so admirably, gets him-
self up as a Deal Pilot, and dances like an i-deal pilot, what was he
but an impersonation of Uriah Heep? Of course. And careful Mr.
Barrett, too, was not he the very image of Traddles? We will swear
to a dear little Dora in the ballet, and it was Agnes herself who acci-
dentally ſell down (we hope she wasn't hurt) in the spirited dance, on
the first night of representation. That indefatigable acting manager,
MR. F. B. CHATTERTON as he stood by the Box Office, could not be
mistaken for any one but Barkis the Carrier; and that $1. FALCONER
standing at the wing, had from his boots upwards plagiarised himself
from cruel Mr. Murdstone, is a fact too patent to have escaped the
notice of such acute powers of observation as were brought to bear upon
the new drama.
The other day the Ghost called upon the LoRD CHANGELLOR, at
Hackwood Park, when his Lordship said that he himself had met the
shady customer about fifty-five years ago, when he was only half a Ghost
or a Ghostling. MR. PEPPER complained that wherever the Ghost had
been done, he had been “done” as well. Everybody laughed heartily,
and then joined in a Highland Fling, PROFEssoR PEPPER being the
Piper. The company then separated, highly pleased with their rational
and sensible entertainment.
The Liverymen of the Honourable Company of Musicians are, we
believe, about to give a Monster Concert in the Pre-Adamite portion
of the Crystal Palace grounds. The Pneumatic Despatch Committee
have engaged to supply the Ichthyosaurus with sufficient wind to
enable him to play on the Big Bassoon.
PHILOSOPHY ON FOUR LEGS.
. In the Glasgow, Herald, MR. JAMEs NEILson announces, by adver-
tisement, that he has been commissioned to sell at Stirling “by Public
Roup,” a lot of quadrupeds, comprising:—
“Fifty Rarely-Picked, Short-Legged, Powerful,
CLYDESDALE DRAUGHT HORSES AND MARES,
Mostly 4, 5, and 6 years old,
And which, when at work, seem full of wisdom, and are the very perfection of
true-drawing animals.
Roup to begin at Twelve o'clock precisely.”
At four, five, and six years old, horses that seem full of wisdom have,
apparently, much the advantage of human beings who do not arrive at
years of discretion till a much later age, if ever. The semblance of
wisdom, according to the Scotch auctioneer, displayed by these animals,
might be quoted by a moral, philosopher with a taste for platitudes to
inculcate on proud man a lesson of humility, not, however, quite so
edifying as it would be if the creatures, that look filled with wisdom,
instead of being horses were asses. - -
We recollect reading a story, in which a coachman is described as
calling to a slow horse;—“Now then, Shakspeare!” The narrator
is disgusted at the association of the name of SHAKSPEARE with any-
thing stupid. It was perhaps only ironically that SHAKSPEARR's name
was given to a donkey of a horse. But horses that seem full of wisdom
might with great propriety be named after the wisest of mankind.
JAMIE NEILsoN's lot might have included a SHAKSPEARE and a BAGON
—nay,” a DuGALD STEwART, or a THOMAS BRQWN; and singe they
were “the very perfection of true-drawing animals,” any one of them,
except, of course, the mares, might have been with equal propriety
called David Wilkie.

A Matter of Profession, as well as Practice.
IN last week’s papers, we were startled with a paragraph with the
ominous heading, “Extraordinary Charge against_a, Solicitor.” Such
is our child-like faith in the immaculate purity of the legal fraternity,
that we would not read the harrowing details. However, and we are
speaking from experience, from which we have gathered wisdom to our
great cost, if the same paragraph had been headed “Extraordinary
Charge by a Solicitor,” we shoul have felt much more readily inclined
to believe in the truthfulness of the alleged offence.
BOUND TO ADORE.
WE are repeatedly told that “Love laughs at Locksmiths.”. It is
true to a turn, for there are instances on the legal books of Cupid, not
only laughing at the Locksmith, but actually taking his pick of all the
wards in Chancery.

THE INDECORUM OF DRINKING.
To the Editor of Punch.
>
“A TRAVELLER, who had been at the Court of
Dahomey, lately published a statement describing the
manners and customs prevalent in that kingdom. The
manners appear to be rough, and the customs revolting,
all but one, which is admirable. It is thus described:—
“No one is permitted to see the King drink; all turn their faces
away, and a large cloth is held up by his wives while the Royal
mouth takes in the liquid.”
“Now, Sir, that liquid is generally rum. I need not tell
Punch that rum is an intoxicating beverage. Next to total
abstinence, what, I ask, is more becoming than the prac-
tice of drinking only behind a veil? It is an acknowledg-
ment of the ignominy of drinking. This is one of the truly
grand customs of the KING of DAHOMEy. That sovereign,
if he does get drunk, is evidently ashamed of drinking,
which is more than many Englishmen can say for them-
selves. His sable Majesty, if he were not sable, would
blush whilst he drinks. How many of your acquaintance,
inclusive, perhaps, of Bishops, are accustomed to guzzle
their port with countenances unblushing, except, perhaps,
at the end of the nose!
“According to MR. DITToN, writing in the Times, a
similar custom in drinking to that which is honoured in the
observance by Dahomey's Monarch, was observed also in the
Court of our HENRY THE SEVENTH. What I propose, Mr.
Punch, on the part of the United Kingdom Alliance, is, that
a deputation should wait upon the PRINCE of WALEs with a
modest request that his Royal Highness would be pleased
to revive this courtly practice by causing a napkin to be
held before his face whenever he drinks, at least whenever
he indulges in any intoxicating beverage. The example
of Royalty would soon render it fashionable for every
gentleman to make a point of covering his face in º:
wine. Thus, in a short time, the act of drinking woul
come to be regarded as an impropriety, and the principles
of temperance would accomplish at least the same triumph
in England as that, which they have achieved in Dahomey.
I dare say you will call the foregoing suggestion imper-
tinent, and say that its author is an officious ass. I will only
reply that I am your humble servant, and
“A MEMBER OF THE MAINE LAW LEAGUE.”
*...* We should think so.-Punch.

SENSATIONAL ADWERTISEMENTS.

tractions calculated to improve the public mind:—

of the Castle Spectre was of a comparatively jovial character.

A DANGEROUS PUBLICATION.
IT is long since we have received anything pleasant in the shape of
American news. “Out on ye, owls, nothing but songs of death!” is
the exclamation with which we have greeted the senders of each suc-
cessive batch of telegrams that we have, for the last two years and
upwards, received from New York, and the editors of all the newspapers
#. America. At last, however, one of the latter has sent us a joke, and
ere it is :-
“Punch, a London publication of considerable promise, and no bad imitation of
FRANK Leslie's Budget of Fun, has a very clever squib upon the practice of noble-
men putting their names down as directors of new hotels. It represents a number
of noblemen, with their coronets on, waiting upon customers.”
Now this is really a good joke. It must not be passed over as if it
were a broad play upon words, or an outrageous Yankeeism of ordinary
impudence. To call Punch no bad imitation of FRANK Leslie's
Budget of Fun is a bit of fun, which, if a fair sample of the fun of the
last-named periodical, should deter anybody from attempting to read it
who is unwilling to burst his sides with laughter. ,

| THE Pays of. Thursday evening last week
- § | contained the following announcement:-
“The French and Austrian Ambassadors in London
had a long conference yesterday with Earl Russell. A
* | perfect understanding continues to exist between the
three Powers relative to the Polish question.”
On this statement the Times remarked in a
note:—
“ Unfortunately for the veracity of our Parisian con-
temporary, EARL RUSSELL is in Scotland.”
It is all right. Although EARL RusseIL was,
at the date in question, as the Times says, in Scot:
s|land, there is no essential inaccuracy in the
assertion of the Pays that the French and
Austrian. Ambassadors had a conference with
him. The noble Earl had engaged a brother
§ | Peer and fellow statesman to act in his place
during his temporary absence. He had left EARL
PUNCH as his representative at the Foreign Office.
The French and Austrian Ambassadors had an
interview with EARL PUNch. It extended to a
conference of #: length, although its duration
appeared much too short to their Excellencies,
who declared that they had never known two
hours pass so quickly before. This explanation
will suffice to clear up a natural but thorough
misunderstanding.
Conditions of Peace with America.
THERE is a consideration which may have some
weight in determining the Yankees not to force
us into a war with them, whilst they have on
hand any such work as the siege of Charleston,
and whilst we have a Channel Fleet of Ironsides
disengaged. Two circumstances render it inex-
pedient for them to quarrel with us. They have
too many irons in the fire, and we too many in
the water.
IMAGE-WINKING AND IMAGE-WORSHIP.
...THE truth of the proverb which says that wonders will never cease is
illustrated by the miracles, real or pretended, now in course of per-
formance in the neighbourhood of Rome. The Roman Correspondent
of the Post says:—
“...The religious furore created along all the upper valley of the Anio and through-
out the neighbouring districts, as well Italian as Pontifical, by the miraculous
moving of the eyes of the picture of the Madonna in the Church of Vicovaro, a town
nine Iniles beyond Tivoli, goes on spreading and increasing.”
Either this picture winks or it doesn't. If it doesn't wink, the belief
of those who believe that they see it wink is wonderful. And there are
many who believe so. The Tablet endorses their faith. . According to
the other authority above quoted:—
“The Infanta of Portugal, with her suite, and a host of prelates and dignitaries,
witnessed the miracle, and deposited their gifts.”
And mind, the Infanta of Portugal is not a baby. Moreover:—
“The other day a prelate of the Pope's Palace went and had prayers put up for
his Holiness before the miraculous picture, which distinctly moved its eyes during
the prayers, according to the written testimony of the prelate and many of the
congregation.”
How many ?, Qut of a multitude ſº at the Lion on the top of
Northumberland House impressed with a statement that it has wagged
its tail, some, we are told, will seem to themselves to see it do so. This,
anyhow, is wonderful delusion. So are the fantasies of electro-biology.
It is wonderful that the eyes are made the fools of the other senses; it
would be still more wonderful if, in a case like that of the Northum-
berland, House Lion, or the Vicovaro Madonna, they proved to be
worth all the rest. Were the Lion actually to wag its tail, that would
be a great wonder; but not so great as the motion of the Madonna's
eyes. At a certain temperature the tail of the Lion, being metallic,
would be flexible, and, given the spiritual force that hoists Wir. Howe
to the ceiling and move: tables, and the requisite temperature, which
would be no difficulty to a certain class of spirits, the Lion's tail might
be wagged by intelligible means. But there is no understanding how
particles of dry paint can move instantaneously one upon the other,
and resolve themselves into new arrangements. The wonder, there.
fore, of a really winking Fº would be exceedingly wonderful.
Yet this wonder is alleged to be not only occurring at Wicovaro,
WOL. XLV.
which, we are informed, “has become a little Loreto; ” but, adds
the Post:—
“Fifteen miles farther up the valley, however, is the more important town of
Subiaco, with the ancient É.i. Abbey, of which the Pope is abbot.
It appears that Subiaco has taken nulli secunda for her motto, as a miraculous image
of the Madonna manifested itself there at 9 A.M. on the 15th instant, by the same
prodigy as at Vicovaro. The miracle took place in the oratory of St. Andrew, was
attested by the pro-Vicar FERRAR1, and announced to the population by the clangour
of all the Church bells in the town.”
Who has witnessed this same prodigy besides the pro-Vicar FERRAR1;
If not every beholder of the image, but only certain, persons, then, at
any rate, there is no room for unpleasant, suspicion. Ingenuity of
º is out of the question; and the Winking-image is attested
y the same sincerity as that which might honestly depose to having
seen the Lion on Northumberland House wag its tail. When we are
credibly informed that this appearance has n visible to, a whole
congregation at once, and not till then, we shall inquire whether it is a
miracle or a humbug.
In the meantime we are further informed that:—
“By especial permission of his Holiness, the ancient image of the Saviour is to
remain visible to the public in the Church of San Giovanni until to-morrow evening.”
Hence it, appears Image-winking and Image-worship, at Rome go
together. The phenomenon may be supposed to commend the practice.
There was a time when images are said to have winked in the Papal
States considerably, once before. This was in the course of 1796,
according to M. LE CHEVALIER DES MousseAUx, author of La Magie.
Images and Fº these painted on linen, panels, paper, in fresco
upon high relief; those made of wood, wax, or stone, not only rolled
their eyes, and changed colour, but appeared to live and breathe; their
eyes sparkled; one perspired, another shed an abundance of tears. Can
we, as DR, Johnson said of hearing his distant mother call “SAM l’”
say that “nothing came of it?” All we know is that the Papacy
almost immediately came to grief. Suppose it comes to joy this time.
Suppose, instead of invading Rome, a French army remains, there;
suppose the Pope lives to a good old age... Suppose that neither he
nor his successor is dragged through the dirt to crown a despot, and
consecrate what they believe to be usurpation, with deposition for their
ains after all, Qn the contrary, suppose Victor EMMANUEL restores
mbria and the Marches, what conclusion are we expected to draw
Perhaps, that the image-worship ordained by his Holiness has averted
the calamities which were portended by the winking images and
pictures. But if nothing comes of it, or nothing but grief, how then?

*GHOSTS WITHOUT SPIRIT.
ºwn.

-
A.
INGULARLY, there is just now a glut of ghosts every-
where. There is a ghost at the Adelphi, a ghost or
ghosts at the Britannia, a ghost at the Alhambra;
there are three distinct ghosts at the Crystal Palace
the Loving Ghost, the Military Ghost, and the Nautica
Ghost, besides a lot of other ghosts under the name of
Lost Ghosts. In addition to all these ghosts there are divers ghosts at
sundry Music Halls. “The air is thick with phantoms;”ghosts swarm
like gnats. -- - - -
Now, if, whilst these factitious ghosts are in course of exhibition for
public amusement under the well understood denomination of optical
illusions, real and genuine departed spirits, in private “circles,” are
actually showing their hands, and making use of them by º:
ople's legs, drawing flowers and other objects, ringing handbells, and
#. MR. HoxtE into space, how is it that these bond ſide ghosts allow
themselves to be insulted by mimicry " . The ghosts that were invented
by PROFEssoR PEPPER are exhibited with the avowed design of demon-
strating the unreality of those ghosts which spiritualists believe to be
real. If there are any real ghosts, and if they can communicate
with the living by raps, why do they suffer their authenticity to be
impugned without a sensible protest against a calumnious misrepre-
sentation? Why do they not give PEPPER, and the other philosophers
who produce the sham ghosts, a rap over the head, or at least a rap on
the knuckles? Take a theatre containing a crowded audience; the
deuce is in it if there is not at least one medium in it out of so many
people, mediums being actually as plentiful as they are alleged to be by
those who believe in them. Under these favourable conditions, cannot
the true ghosts contrive to vindicate their existence and character by
a single rap? Have they not one rap to afford their friends as well as
enemies? Do they consider neither worth a rap? They are mocked
with a nightly defiance in all quarters. How can they stand it
If I were a ghost, thinks everythinking person, I would take care to
let opticians and actors know that I would not have my species aped
and taken off with impunity. It would rather astonish both the man
of science outside the scenes and also the performer on the stage in a
ghost piece, iſ, in the place of the expected spectre, there were to appear
a living, walking ghost, a regular ghost come from the grave, or rather
from beyond the grave, from that bourne from which no traveller
returns, as Hamlet says, although he has just seen one who has returned
from it. If the spirits asserted to manifest themselves to mankind had
any properspirit among them, they would not submit to be triumphantly
demonstrated to be all humbug, as they now are in the face of the
public, by PROFEssoR PEPPER and his followers.
“Entertainment for Man and Horse.”

and rain. Club-rooms are once more beginning to look cheerful. Lawyers

Managers are bestirring themselves to see how they can most profitably
fill up the interval between this and Christmas.
Talking of Theatres, MRs. SELBy and her corps of talented assistants
at the small New Royalty Theatre deserve all praise for the hearty and
emergetic manner in which they have individually and collectively laboured
for the success of the new extravaganza, which is called Irion, or
the Man at the Wheel. “Tis not in mortals to command success,” but
the Immortals who nightly appear in Dean Street, Soho, are of course
far above even the slightest shadow of a failure. It certainly is the
Wº. and best “got up” piece that we have seen for a long-time.

Then at the Adelphithere is Miss BATEMAN, who, as Leah, reminds

HEAR DEPUTY FRY, at the Court of Common Council, on a subject
which is a disgrace to the Legislature. MR. FRY brought up a report
from the Improvement Committee to whom had been referred the ques-
tion of means to ºbviate the disfigurement of Ludgate Hill, and the
eclipse of St. Paul's by an unsightly, viaduct. He said that the com:
ny to whose private, interests Parliament has sacrificed the City of
ondon, having expended much money in constructing their works, of
which the viaduct was an essential part:-
“The directors, with whom the committee put themselves in communication
declined under those circumstances to consider any alternative plan, and the com"
mittee had to relinquish an opposition which was hopeless. The company, how-
ever, had undertaken to build a viaduct highly ornamental in design and appear-
ance; but he believed that, decorate it as they might, the thing would be a great
eyesore in that part of the Metropolis for all time. (Hºar, hear.”
Yes truly; hear, hear. The hideous obstruction in the shape of a
Viaduct over Ludgate Hill will, as MR FRY justly observes, be “a
great eyesore in that part of the Metropolis for all time.” It will be
also a monument to the barbarism of a crew of sordid speculators out of
the Legislature, and of their representatives within it; the Members for
Pelſ, the delegates of the money-grubbing Snob interest. It is to be
wished that the names of these legislators could be indelibly engraven
on the “highly ornamental” Viaduct, with which they have empowered
avarice to disfigure Ludgate Hill. The proper height of ornature for
the monstrosity would be those honourable names of theirs illuminated
with glaring colours. They would thus be held up for ever to the
scorn of posterity; in the mean time they deserve to stand exposed, the
whole lot of them, in a highly ornamental pillory, large enough to afford
them sufficient accommodation for pandering to the barbarous cºvet-
ousness of the spoilers who direct the London, Chatham, and Dover,
henceſorth to be called the Goths and Vandals, Railway.
Retaliation.
The Nile has risen this year in an astounding manner, has swept away

MR.
SHYCOCK'S REFLECTIONS
OWER AN HOTEL BILL.
ORTHY MR. PUNCH,
“IT is over—that painful
moment, which winds up my
week's stay, in this well-
appointed Victoria Hotel—
at St.Vincent’s-on-Avon. 1
HAVE seeN MY BILL! That
was a shock. I HAVE
PAID IT | | That was a
greater shock still. I did
Tº not remonstrate at the
moment. Perhaps I was
stunned. I know I felt
extremely ashamed of my-
self, and somewhat ashamed
of my host. My wife, with
the honest house-wifely
feeling of one accustomed
to take stock of the weekly
items of her own family
expenditure, and with a
womanly aversion to being
imposed * was for re-
sistance. I over-ruled her.
We had only half-an-hour
to get to the station. I
did not wish to embitter
our last moments in a
leasant place; where we
; been very happy—till
the bill came. I was doubt-
ful if resistance would help us. I felt that something of the blame
was due to myself. I hate squabbles about, shillings. In short, I
winced but paid, when my wife— (bless her honest heart!)—was for
firing up and protesting. But I pondered on the bill, during our
journey to town. And some of my reflections, I think, may have an
interest for Mr. Punch and his readers—the middle-class ones at all events.
“To make matters worse for my digestion of this bill, I had come to
St. Vincent’s-on-Avon, from the pleasant paths of Ilfracombe—leaving
a lodging where I, MRS. S., our little hope SYLVANUs SHYcock, and
his nurse, had been boarded and lodged, for some three weeks, at an
average rate of some £5 per week . . . boarded and lodged, mind,
with the perfect comfort and sufficiency, out of which my heart spake
in last week’s letter of lauds over Ilfracombe and all belonging to it.
“And now there was unrolled before me, for a week's board and
lodging under the statelier, but not more comfortable, roof of the
Victoria Hotel, St. Vincent’s-on-Avon, a bill amounting to £25 16s. 3d. '
I had entertained three friends—a papa and two daughters—twice to
dinner in this time. We had consumed on each of those occasions, a
bottle of sherry and a bottle of champagne. Besides this, we had
ourselves disposed of some four pints of sherry during the week. But
these mild excesses set aside, there was nothing to account for this vast
discrepancy of charge between St. Vincent’s Hotel and our Ilfracombe
lodging, in the shape of any comfort or convenience that I can think of,
after much reflecting. My dinners had not been better, but worse, than
those in my liſracombe lodgings, inſerior in quality and cooking, less
various, and less copious. My nurse and her charge had fared still worse
than MRs. S. and myself, at the second or servants’ table, down-stairs,
as to the supply of which I heard sundry grumblings. How was the
difference accounted for P To find out this, I was forced to come from
generals to particulars, and so to a dissection of this disagreeable
document—item by item.
“I arrived at St. Vincent's late—about mine o'clock—on Saturday.
We ordered coffee and an omelette, and were in bed hy ten. I find
apartments charged 12s. 6d., attendants 3s. and lights 1s. 6d. for that
night. For this 17s. I had an hour's use of a sitting-room, two bed:
rooms for the night, the gas-light in the sitting-room—which I could
have thankfully dispensed with for a lamp or a pair of best composites
sº say half-an-hour's consumption, at furthest of two bed-room
candies.
“Next day we entertained our three friends; dinners, £1 5s-5s,
a-head—not bad for a woolly piece of cod, a pair of fowls, a dish of
cutlets, and a tart—my bottle of champagne (indifferent), 10s.; my
bottle of sherry (very fair average wine), 6s.--When will this shame-
less adherence of hotel-keepers to this old scale of prices for wine be
put down by the indignation of consumers?—the ale (say three pints
of draught pale), 2s. 6d.; dessert (a plate of filberts, ditto of squashy
pears, and hard apples), 4s. ; teas (with probably a plate of toast or a
little bread and butter), 7s.6d. ; apartments as the night before, 12s. 6d. ;
| attendance, 3s. ; and lights, ls. 6d. ; bringing up my day's bill to the
j imposing figure of £410s. Here I pause. If I had been as wise as I
am now on reflection, I should have asked for my bill on Monday
morning, and seeing the sum total, should have respectfully informed
my amiable host that I could not afford this style—not of living—but
of paying; and that therefore, though I could not deny that his house
was handsome, his beds comfortable, his waiters attentive, (sorry I
could not extend my praise to his cook,) still, my means (even with the
well-known liberality of Mr. Punch) would not permit me to live at this
rate, and I should therefore betake me to a lodging—in the hope that
the cost and comfort of Ilfracombe might not be altogether unattainable
in St.Vincent’s-on-Avon—a great haunt, I was told, of retired Indians,
old officers, and delicate invalids, during the winter, and therefore likely
enough, one would think, to be provided with accommodation suited to
somewhat fastidious lodgers and not over-heavy purses.
“I did not take this course. I was comfortable, essentially; I was
uncertain as to the length of my stay; I easily settle down, and have
great difficulty in weighing anchor again.
“So I staid where I was, and bled, during the week, at the rate I
have indicated by the above items of charge.
“The result was that disagreeable sum total of £2516s. 8d. During
the ºf of this time, I only burned sitting-room candles (four) on
one night. I and my wife may have used a single bed-room candle, and
my nurse, four. For these and our share of the gas, I find myself
charged 17s. for the week. My nurse's board is charged 5s. daily;
SYLVANUs's (four years' old, bless him!) 4s, and once, when a little
companion occupied an empty bed in his room, I find an extra charge
t * 6d. for that—making 15s. instead of 12s. 6d. for apartments
that day.
“Now, I have no wish "to set myself up as a victim, more than
other men, or my host of the Victoria as an extortioner beyond his
fellows. He was very civil to me, personally, and I dare, say, will con-
sider it extremely unhandsome in me, to reflect upon his bill.
... But i wish to deduce some conclusions from that document.
“First, that £25 16s. 3d. a-week is £102 15s. a-month, or £1233
a-year, and that this may therefore be fixed as the limit of income which
justifies people in resorting to an hotel of this pretension. I did not
discover, however, that there was any other hotel in St. Vincent’s-on-
Avon, to which any one, accustomed to the ordinary comforts of a well-
appointed middle-class home, could resort at all. If I am right in this
notion, the only alternative in this case would be lodgings, with their
chances and charges—which can hardly, however, make the resort to
!." in preference to the Victoria, a change ‘from the frying-pan into
exilre.
“Next, I reflected with some bitterness, that I had been an ass, in not
calling for my bill daily; by which course I should certainly have saved
myself from the cost of the Victoria comforts, for at least six out of
my, seven days.
“Thirdly, it occurred to me, whether it would not be an excellent
speculation to set up an hotel at a place so much frequented as
St.Vincent's-on-Avon, at a reasonable system of charges-with visible
tariffs, everywhere hung up, instead of pompous placards boasting a
great deal in generalibus, but giving no particulars. -
“Fourthly, I admitted to myself, with some shame as an Englishman,
that in all my experience of continental hotels, in the most frequented
European capitals, I had never been so freely bled, as here, in my beloved
native land, and by a brother Briton. -
“Fifthly, I registered a vow that if ever 1 returned to St.Vincent's-
on-Avon, I should give the Victoria a wide berth. -
“Sixthly, I felt it a duty to put on record my own experience, for the
benefit of any of my friends—(1 include all my readers in the number),
who, arriving at St. Vincent’s, and attracted by the substantial, hand-
some, and well arranged air of the Victoria, or by the bills, profusely
distributed about its walls, vaunting its cheapness and promising monts
et merveilles, in every way, might be tempted to put up there as I had
done, and lulled in a ſatal security, might postpone, as I did, asking for
a sight of the bill! . If knowing what they are paying they continue to
pay, on their heads be it! Though I feel sore at most of these charges,
I could digest every item more easily than I can those candles!
“I shall be obliged by a remittance, and am, my dear Mr. Punch, your
repentant contributor,
“S. SHYCOCK.”
LORD ROBERT MONTAGU’S LUCK.
At the Annual Dinner of the Huntingdonshire Agricultural Society
at St. Neot’s the other day, LoRD R. MonTAGU, in a speech aſter
dinner, observed that:—
“In his (Lord R. Montagu's) journeys through the country he frequently drank
most excellent beer.”
Did he Then he is a fortunate man. LoRD R. Montagu is im-
plored to publish a list of the public-houses at which he has been so
lucky as to find a really good tap, ºf with genuine, old English
ale. The best liquor drawn by too many landlords is stuff called bitter
beer, of which bitterness is the best quality, and which is more than
bitter enough. By the publication of a guide to good liquor, his Lord-
ship would do the State some service, and henefit the public.

FROM OUR BILIOUS CONTRIBUTOR.
To M.R. PUNCH.
- N Board the Iona
the salmon cutlets
and hot coffee, Sir,
were worthy of
praise, but as I
was not going to
demean myself by
speaking affably to
a steward or a
waiter, that praise
has necessaril
been withheld until
the present mo-
ment.
W. The scenery
down the Clyde
has already been
applauded by
many people, and
Q therefore I have
| little to º that

BYS found out that the

=== to say, however,
* that I have never
seen any produc-
tions of this kind.

tourists, especially females, infesting the deck, but I kept out of their
way as much as I could, not wishing to be edified by their incessant
*::: let off whenever— -
pause at this word to remark that in the north of England, that
is,. Scotland, the natives use it—the word—in a peculiar sense, and
quite wrongly, They say “whenever,” meaning “as soon as.” The
manage, thereby, to convey ludicrous impressions...A. pretty s:
girl will say to you, “Whenever I came into the cabin I had a glass of
Sherry,” and as .." have seen her go out and come in about twenty
times, you are glad that you have not to settle with the steward for
her refection. I proceed. . . . .
— let off whenever (which may here be interpreted in both, the
Scotch and English sense) they find my friend MR. ADAM BLACK telling
them in his Picturesque Guide that they ought to be rapturous. But
E.". a very extraordinary and unusual Fº occurred. It
gan to rain. Now, rain scarcely ever falls in Scotland, and the
Scottish people on, board exhibited the utmost astonishment, and then
ran under cover... The English, who are accustomed to behold rain
did not stir until the others ran, but then, with our usual imitative and
ious readiness to follow somebody else's lead, they also sculked
into the cabin, and the deck was left to your correspondent. I then
had a few moments of enjoyment, which is always marred for me by the
feeling that anybody else is pleased with what I like. I stood in con-
templation, and gazed on the hills and the waters, and I watched the
flight of the eagles. I imagined myself a sea-rover of the old days,
commanding my glorious pirate vessel, and about to make a dash upon
the unsuspecting inhabitants of yonder hamlet. “Come to me,” I wildly
shouted to the eagles, “and I will give you flesh.” Then I raised my
magnificent bass voice in song, and I sang–
“Soon ye feast on dead and dying,
Fair-haired HARold's flag is flying !”
(By the way, a ribald sailor told me afterwards that what I had beheld
were not eagles but crows, but he was a fool.) I had lashed myself
into alfine frenzy of imagination, and had slightly astonished the steers.
man by my bold gesticulations, when a gun was suddenly fired on our lee,
which means our left...I turned and saw a small but peculiarly neat-
looking steamer signalling us, and we slackened our speed. Presently
a boat from the lesser vessel came alongside, and a gentleman of manly
§. and with a voice to match, awoke all the echoes of the Clyde
y demanding in enormous tones,
* Is MR. EpicuRus Rotundus aboard?”
He did not call me by those names, of course, but I prefer to be
.# pseudonymous in print, as I am thus enabled to contradict
myself as often as I like.
“That is me,” I observed, with my usual attention to the rules of
grammar.
“Ah!” shouted the gentleman. “All right. Then
just come into this boat. Send on your traps to Oban.”
I make a rule of always doing as I am bidden, and asking no
questions, Mr. Punch, as you must frequently have observed. I and
mine were speedily transferred to the boat, which pulled away, and the
Iona's huge screw again began churning the Clyde.
“I’ll tell you all about it, MR. EPICURUs, when we get on board,
meantime I’m delighted to have caught you,” said the gentleman, who
seemed the incarnation of all joviality. My mood is habitually pensive,
and I am averse to much conversation, but I can unbend at times, and
revel with the gayest, so I said, joyously,
But
you and yours
“I am delighted to be caught, whoever may have hooked me.
when am I to be landed?” I added, with a happy and facetious allusion
to salmon-fishing, a favourite amusement in Scotland.
“All right, my boy,” replied my new friend. “Pull away, lads.”
A few moments more, and we stood upon the nice, clean, bran new
deck of the smaller steamer.
“I should like something to drink,” I said, wishing to show that
I was at home.
The words were hardly uttered before the neck of a bottle of cham-
pagne lay on the deck, and the contents of the dexterously decapitated
flask were foaming into a huge goblet.
“Slange,” said I. There was no particular reason why I should speak
Gaelic, and I might as well have said “Your health,” but it is well to
ventilate one’s accomplishments.
“Dremakky,” says, the gentleman, laughing. He also spoke
very good Gaelic, which was the more remarkable as he was an Irish-
mail.
“Now,” he said, “the state of the case is this. You are on board
hºº! which has just been built for the President of the Republic of
aiti.”
“And are we going to Haiti, Sir P’’ I asked humbly.
He laughed in a jolly manner, and then stated that we were not
going so far as that, but that the vessel, which was named the Mariani,
was on her trial trip, and was going to run the Lights. That there
was a select party on board, and the select, party was at the moment
beginning a select lunch. That he had heard from persons in Glasgow
that I was on board the Iona, and that he had resolved, on impressing
me into the temporary service of the President aforesaid, my wages to
be astmuch grouse pie and effervescent fluid as I liked.
“But—but—I am not very sure where Haiti is, but I believe that
the President is—well, not to put too fine a point upon it—not exactly
what you would call a white sovereign,” says I.
“Well, you’re not a Yankee,” says the gentleman, “and you’ve no
prºjudices against a dark skin, have you?”
“I am not a Yankee, Sir,” T replied, “and I have no prejudices at
all, Still, I have always been accustomed to a white monarch.”
“The President of Haiti,” says my friend, “is a truergentleman
flººtentis of the European sovereigns.. He is as brave as a
10th.
“Lions are not brave,” said I, “they are cowardly cats. Read
JULEs GERARD.” -
“And as kind as a woman,” he continued, not being able to encounter
my natural history.
Women are not kind,” said I, “they are cruel cats. Read any

“I don't like any French novel,” says he. '
presented to the President,” he went on. “He is an honour to human
nature. A bold, wise, liberal statesman who, when he had in his hands
the most complete vengeance for the deepest injuries, would shed no
blood, and forgave his enemies.”
“Let us drink his Excellency’s health,” says I, “and apropos of
nothing, who are you?”
“That’s my name,” he said, pointing to a line in an inscription
near the funnel, “and I have the honour of representing the President
of Haiti.”
“Sir” said I, “you represent him as a ruler whom I am delighted
to honour. What’s all that hooraying about?”
“Our friends have learned that you have, come on board,” says
he. “Let us join them. Fire, the guns,” he added in a voice of
authority.
“What for?” said I, as I always like to have a reason for every-
thing, Mr. Punch, as you must frequently have observed.
“In honour and glory of Mr. Punch,” says he.
Bang!
Bang! - -
Weiled in smoke and bathed in blushes, I entered the chief cabin of
the Mariani. -
I will write the rest next week. I date from a mountain at Inver-
ness. It is haunted by fairies, and is also a cemetery. Its name literally
translated, is Primrose Hill, but it is higher than Ben Primrose,

looked at it through my opera-glass from a wood, and a field opposite,

or even old PAM,
Yours respectfully,
Tomnahurich, Inverness. EPICURUs Rotundus,
How, WHEN AND WHERE P
or, THE MODERN TourisTS GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
HE Seremely happy Tourist
will now remember that he
has just arrived at Mayence,
without his rug, hatbox,
umbrella, carpet-bag, porta-
ble bath, race-glasses, walk-
ing-stick-campstool, and
writing desk, all of which
he has accidentally left on
board the steamer that is
now bearing his treasures
to Mannheim. As he reaches
the door of the Rheinischer
Hof, the sense of the fear-
ful loss comes upon him like
a flash of lightning. He
claps his hands to his
pockets, not meaning, as
it were to applaud them
for having done something
clever, but with a vague
idea that the portable bath,
campstool and carpet-bag
may not be so far off after
all. What before were lux-
uries, now assume an im-
portance that makes them
appear absolutely necessary
to the traveller's existence. “Everything,” he cries, “ was in my
carpet-bag' I can't get on without a rug', and what the dash
can I do at Baden-Baden if I haven’t got a hat-box : My soap's
in my carpet-bag, so’s my brush, and comband-and-my other boots!”
By the way, those other boots, always carried and not required, or if
not carried invariably wanted, are sure to be lost during the trip.
Apropos de Boots, however, we will just stop for one minute to say
that, if any traveller, fond of grandly romantic scenery, wishes to
make certain of seeing a good fall of water he had better trip up the
Rhine with his boots.
To return to the missing articles.
As landlords and waiters everywhere are supposed to know every-
º, he obvious course will be at once to question them on the
subject.
“Were the articles directed?” asks the host.
The Tourist patiently explains that he doesn't generally label a rug,
a great coat, .. umbrella, but inwardly regrets that he had allowed
the direction “M.R. SMITH, Passenger to Bristol,” to remain upon his
portable bath.
“Monsieur knows the name of his, häteau & papeur º’” the landlord
suggests, mixing a little French and English in order to show that he
is Kºº. for his customer whatever, he may say.
onsieur however hasn’t got the slightest notion what was the name
of the “battue a vampire,” and prides himself upon having pronounced
the name right that time, anyhow. -
“Ah!” says the Landlord, “Monsieur knew the Captain?”
“Good heavens ! No : nor the Stoker, nor Boiler, nor Man at the
Wheel, nor anybody connected with the steamer.”
“Did they see where you got out?” asks the Landlord.
The Tourist had been so engaged with his large luggage that he had
not seen iſ, in stage phrase, “he had been observed.”
“The boat stops at Mannheim,” the Landlord remarks.
“Well, there I suppose,” suggests the traveller, “they take out all
the luggage.” -
“Yes,” replies the Proprietor of the Rheinischer Hof, “and if the
things are not claimed at once—”
*Wºº inquires our friend, anxiously noting a slight hesitation
on the speaker's part in arriving at the catastrophe.
“Well,” resumes Rheinischer Hof slowly, “iſ they’re not claimed
at once—they sell them.”
“Tourist a blight is on thy path
What'll become of the portable bath "
Whitle the air of the "iſº" and sing,
“Oh, my portable bath!
O-o-h My por-tar-blebath!"
Chorus, in which the sympathising Landlord and waiters will (if not
otherwise engaged, and if conversant with the air,) join,
“O-o-oh his portable bath!
O-o-oh his port-tar-blebath!"
After this, order dinner, see your room, shake hands with the Land-
lord, and determine to let byegones be byegones.
The most remarkable object in Mayence will be of course yourself.
Do not let the knowledge of this importance prevent you from visiting
the Cathedral. Protestant though you may be, you will be here re-
ceived into the Church by the Suisse, who is generally a fine handsome
looking man, of whom the ladies say in Suisse-whispers, “Do look at
his Suisse-whiskers?” The French, ever attached to the lightest
possible literature, once converted this Cathedral into a Magazine. It
soon, however, fell to the ground, and now-a-days very little that is
original remains, as the people subsequently took all their articles from
the French. -
Even though you, or any other Tourist, may have given up all idea
of laying hands upon the lost baggage, yet you, as a pedestrian, should
walk to Mannheim. At this place you’ll halt, and probably begin to
limp as one maimed by the unwonted exercise, unless you have been
previously accustomed to do the same thing, or as the French call it,
main-chose, or shoes, as in this case.
A pleasant wet day may be spent at Mannheim, by trying to find out
by the aid of the Mannheim Directory, the address of your old friend
who has performed the Samson-like gymnastic feat known as “Taking
up his Residence” in this ancient town. We’ve often heard of Dra-
matic critics being able to “give a theatre a lift with their pens,” and
We * that these expressions are the results of a strong muscular
Creed.
But to the Directory, -
Mannheim houses are not as other houses. They are arranged in
blocks, chiefly blocks of stone. The streets intersect one another at
right * wherever they can, and at wrong angles wherever they
can’t, and by generally interfering with one another in the most unac-
countable manner, produce upon the mind of the stranger the feeling
that he might as well be in Fair Rosamond's Bower, or the Maze at
Hampton Court, without the sweet little cherub who sits. up aloft, and
sings out “To your Right—To your left,” and other intelligible instruc-
tions to help him on his way.
The streets have no names, though they will have, and pretty hard
ones too, after you’ve been puzzling and meandering about them.
The simple direction for finding out where anybody lives is, ask him
himself on the first opportunity; but if you can't see him, and haven't
got time to write, take the Directory, and observe that all the blocks
are arranged alphabetically, that the houses are numbered, and that
there are many blocks more than the Alphabet has letters, and that
then you begin again and make the best you can of it. That’s plain so
far, isn't it? Well, let’s say you want to call on MR. B. Very
MR. B. you find lives at A, now on this point you will not be at Sea.
Then A being a block, you find the number; now, we forgot to mention
that each block is numbered as well as every house, so that when you’ve
ascertained the number of the house, you must take care not to confuse
it with the number of the block, and when you’ve carefully arrived at
a knowledge of both numbers, your next step will be to retrace your
former ones, and see whether you were correct in the first instance.
After this, take care that the block is the block in the Alphabet and not
one out of the Alphabet; then see that the number is the same as the
one you had fixed upon, and finally learn whether or no. B lives at this

Visit the Theatre, which was once reduced to a mere shell by
the Austrian bombs. Ever since then all the Pieces have gone

The Cathedral was pretty considerably knocked about by the French,
who chipped and clipped pillars and statues and sepulchral monuments.
Here some Margraves are buried; the iconoclastic French, however,
appear to have been the principalmar-graves. They compelled the eccle-

WORDS IN SEASON.
Le Follet begins its account of the Fashions for October with the
following devotional words:–
“Now that the Autumn has decidedly made its appearance among us all, our
thoughts and energies must be 'directed to the study of the most becoming and
appropriate'styles of dresses and materials for the Season.”
“All our thoughts and energies?” What all, love? All our heart,
soul, and strength, dearest? Well, then, we shall be worshippers of
Fashion, indeed. Now that the Autumn has decidedly made its ap-
pearance, some of us begin to think that Christmas is coming. Some
others of us have gloomier views, most of us are inspired with thoughts
more or less serious. But you and I, sweet, will devote our whole minds
to the decoration of our bodies.
A Craniological Puzzle.
(From the German.)
TIME was, as wild Macbeth declared with dread,
Men wanting brains, lack'd all that wins renown.
But now a King will wholly lose his head
And still retain-strange paradox—the Crown.
| THE Best FRUIT For PRESERVING LovE.
KATE was talking glowingly about “love-apples.” “That’s strange!”
exclaimed CHARLIE, her accepted lover. “Why should “love” be
associated with “apples?” On the contrary, I thought that love always
went in pairs.” Kate smiled approvingly.
THE IRREMOVABLE RICH.
“My DEAR MR. PUNCH, “Cato Cottage, Thursday.
“Having nothing else to write about at this dull time of year,
the papers have been full of letters about labourers, and the want they
have of change in their homes and habitations. Now, Sir, you must
remember that a Session or two since (at least so my husband tells me),
an Act of Parliament was passed for the benefit of people called the
Irremovable Poor; and assurely their condition has been enough loºked
after, I do hope the attention ºthe nation and the Government will be
ere ºf directed to the pitiable case of the Irremovable Rich. I need
not tell you, who know everything, how many families there are in pretty
comfortable circumstances, where the Mamma, poorthing! has annually
the very greatest difficulty in getting her dear children removed to the
sea-side, as it is essential for their health that they should be. ... I have
at my pen's point ahundred cases of this sort, but I will not take your
space up with more than one or two. Calling on my dear friend MRs.
SM-TH last August, Ifound her in a sadly dejected frame of mind, and
on asking her the cause she told me that her husband had actually
refused to take her out of town!—at least he had said he didn’t mind
escorting her to Margate, but as for Scotland or Killarney, or a trip
upon the Continent, he really couldn’t affordit, and though Scarborough
was nearer, it was so extremely dressy that she'd want a heap of things
(it was so the wretch expressed himself), and he was rather short of
money, and so really must say no. With which cruel coarse refusal the
brute positively kissed her, and then walked out of the house to catch
his usual train, as cool and unconcerned as though nothing had
occurred! -
“The other case of real distress, Ithink, is stillmore pitiable. Another
friend of mine, MRs. J-N-s, of T-rmh-m Grin, was advised by her
physician, the eminent DR. W HEEDLEM, to remove herself and children
to the sea-side for a month or two, and upon her asking where she had
better go, DR, WHEEDLEM prescribed Cornwall, or Llandudno in North
Wales. MR. J-N-s, however, wouldn’t hear of such a thing; said that
Herne Bay or southend would do the brai, (for so the monster spoke
of his own children!) would do the brats as much good as any other
watering-place, and as for DR. WHEEDLEM, he had recommended Corn-
wall because he knew that MRs. J. had set her heart on going, there,
for she knew quite well she didn’t care an atom where the children
went. Saying which he slammed the door, and heedless of her hysterics
then stormed out of the house; and, the only reparation, he has made
for his gross cruelty is by giving her a little dinner at the Star and
Garter, and taking her to Brighton for a fortnight at the Bedford,
while the children went to Putney on a visit to their aunt. ...
“Cases such as these are continually occurring, and in this age of
Christian charity, I think it is high time that something should be done
for the relief of such poor sufferers. If Parliament refuse to take the
matter up (and as our Members are all men, I have no doubt that they
will), private means must be devised to furnish ladies with assistance
to remove themselves and families when wanting change of air, without
having to trouble their mean husbands to escort them. Benevolent
societies should at once be set on foot for taking ladies and their
children to the sea-side in the season, and defraying for a month or so
their necessary, expenses, including a few extras, such as buns and
shrimps and photographs, without which little luxuries, life at a dull
watering place would hardly be endurable, at least by the dear children
whom it benefits so much. With regard to the providing of the funds
for such a charity, I should suggest that stingy husbands should be
bored till they supply them, or else that they be raised by a tax upon
old bachelors, who surely should do something to contribute to the
nurture of other people's children, seeing they have none to bring up of
their own.
“Begging you, Mr. Punch, who have a large bump of benevolence,
to bring my scheme before the charitable public, and lend your valuable
assistance towards securing its success,
“I remain, Sir, yours admiringly,
“Sophonisba SMITH.”
"P.S.. I have myself (at present) only three small children, and so
we’re not so irremovable a family as most. ut MR. SMITH has
thrown out hints about the cost of travelling and the dearness of sea
lodgings, and so if the Society be started by next summer I think it
sadly possible I may have to apply to it. At any rate, be kind enough
to put my name among the first who will perhaps require relief.”
“P.P.S.. I have saved three pounds and threepence out of house-
keeping this autumn, and so, if MR. S. refuses to subscribe, I can pay
something towards a Petition to LoRD PALMERston, if you think that
it be necessary to ask him to assist us, and that I’m sure he would, for
he is such a dear.”

BANK-NOTES AND QUERIES.
Q. WHAT is the meaning of “a Cool Thousand P”
A. Allusion is made in this phrase to the thousands
that are kept cool in the Bank cellars.
THE PRINCESS AND THE PUFFERS.
PEOPLE have ceased talking of the PRINcess ALEXANDRA and her
rare and matchless beauty, but tradesmen do their best-or worst—to
keep her charms from fading in, the memory of the public. One man
ji; writes a puff about his “Alexandra Corset,” which “imparts the
graceful slimness” of the Princess to the figure: while another recom:
mends his “Alexandra Crinoline,” as being framed precisely on the model
of that worn by her. Alexandra Boots there are in copious abundance,
all warranted of course to make the biggest, feet as small and neat as
hers are; and the other day we noticed the Alexandra Knickerbockers,
though we are sure our sweet Princess would never dream of wearing
such masculine attire. Still more impudent, we think, are the puffs of
the perſumers, who appear almost to hint that, the Princess owes her
beauty in great measure to their art. Thus the Alexandra Dentifrice
is, said to be "much used” by her, and is, stated to impart a pearly
whiteness to the teeth; while the Alexandra Hair-waver, which she
condescends to “patronise,” is puffed in such a manner as might lead
one, to imagine. that she owes to its improving influence the chief
capillary attractions which beautify her head.
We expect soon to be told of the Alexandra Pearl Powder for
blanching the complexion; and we shall not be surprised iſ some one
has the cheek to advertise the Alexandra Rouge-pot, and endeavour to
| rsuade us (which would certainly be difficult) that the Princess buys
º: facial roses at his shop. Indeed while they are about it, we wonder
- -
that the puffers don't invent a quack specific for making the eyes
sparkle as do those of the Princess, and the Alexandra Eye-brightener
would, doubtless succeed well, and, so, we make no §º would
the Alexandra Smile-sweetener, if ladies could be led to fancy that
by using them they could imitate successfully the sweet smile of the
Princess.
Mr. Punch well knows the nuisance of being so good looking that
one’s always being stared at, while every one is copying one's com-
plexion, or one's clothes. , So he can sympathise sincerely with his
sweet little Princess, for whose relief from the impertinence of puffing
º tradespeople a stringent Act of Parliament should speedily be
passed.
PROTECTION OF PROPERTY FROM CRINOLINE.
So many girls continue to be burnt to death in consequence of wearing
dresses cf excessive circumference over a ventilator of Crinoline, that
manufacturers of dress-stuffs are urgently called upon to make them
fire-proof. It is not that vain and foolish females require to be pro-
tected from the results of their own, tasteless vanity, or gregarious
imitation; and if those results were limited to the combustion of a
quantity of clothes, containing a simpleton, they might be accepted as
a salutary example of the working of natural laws. If a moth will
flutter round the candle, let it. If a young lady will surround herself
with a grate piled with fuel, and not take care how she approachcs the
fire, she likewise might be allowed to find out her mistake; if she could

THE EARTHQUAKE was FELT, Too, IN MANY PARTs of LONDON.
THIs Is OLD BEERy, THE CHURCHwardEN, who DECLARES THAT when
HE CAME ouT of THE MARQUIs of GRANBY THE PAVEMENT HIT HIM ON
THE Nose, AND THAT HIs STREET Doob wouldN'T LET HIM GET HIS
LATCH-KEY IN.
ANTI-PUNCH LEAGUE.
THAT part of the public which is unfortunately obliged to look, occa-
sionally, at the Inferior Press, must have been struck with the recent
appearance of a large crop of paragraphs in abuse of Mr. Panch. The
simultaneous apparition of these ºf: and their clumsy family like-
ness, naturally indicate confederacy, and at this slack season of the year
Mr. Punch thinks that it may amuse some of his readers to be informed
as to the little game of the accomplices. As a rule, of course, any
person who abuses Mr. Punch is either a fool, or a would-be contributor
whose writings have been rejected, but there is a trifle of novelty about
the little shower of mud which has been lately flung at that gentleman's
windows, and the onslaught has been made for a sort of reason beyond
mere folly or spite. -
Mr. Punch will own at once that he should have known nothing, of
the terrible conspiracy if one of the accomplices had not split upon his
friends in the hope of ...; a reward. He has furnished the fol-
lowing particulars, for which, of course, he has been paid, but he has
not been engaged by Mr. Punch, and is not likely to be.
It seems that a Meeting of distinguished literary men, held a short
time ago in a private room at a tavern near Holborn, suddenly awoke
to the conviction that something ought to be done to “put down Punch,”
and set up a successor to that gentleman. The first 'gentleman who
ut words to the idea was .d.; cheered and promptly chaired, and
É. assumed the headship of the meeting, with some little expenditure
of affidavit at being bothered with changing his seat. . We see no
necessity for giving names, which nobody cares to know, but º have
been supplied by the faithful traitor, and are also appended to letters
in Mr. Punch's desk.
The Chairman said that there was no need for much cackle, as they
all knew what they wanted. Here they sat, perhaps as gifted a set
of men as were ever touched with the fire-coal of genius (cheers), and
yet there was not a man in that room who had not been insulted b
Punch’s rejection of his contributions. (Yells.) Let 'em scrunc
Punch, and have a Punch of their own. (Loud cheers.
A Speaker said that there could be no doubt that Punch was very
inferior to what that meeting could produce. He would back himself,
for a new hat—
A Woice. “Not before you want it, my boy.” -
The Speaker said that such coarse and vulgar allusions were worthy
WOL. XLV.
of the person who made them. If the meeting encouraged such bru-
tality, he would decline to associate, with them. Some trouble was
caused by this literary gentleman's irritability, but having had a little
more stimulant, he suddenly began to cry, and declared that he loved
the entire room, waiter and all, like brothers.
The Chairman said that this statement was uncommonly gratifying,
but a little from the point. He called attention, to the necessity of
...; Punch right and left, and he supposed that everybody in the
room had some channel through which he could do it.
A Speaker said that he had been abusing Punch without cessation in
the columns of the Dirtyborough Liberator for seven years, and he would
do it for seven more: for Punch had sent him back some verses which
he had offered for nothing, and which were —
4 Woice. “Exactly worth it.” (Laughter.)
The Speaker would like to see the flippant idiot who had emitted
that asinine howl write º half so good.
| The Chairman said that such language was spicy, but had better be
kept for the journal which he hoped they would soon start.
Another Speaker said that Punch was a mere clique, and he hoped
they would take precious good care that none of the Punch men were
|allºwed to join the new journal. (Cheers.)
| The Chairman asked, whether anybody had got a good name for the
| new affair.
A great number of names were *. but in each case somebody
or other recollected that a journal had come out with the name—and
gone out. The Bohemian seemed to find most favour, until somebody
suggested The Cad, which was instantly and outrageously cheered, and
glasses were ordered to christen the new sheet.
"THE CAD” having been drunk with all the honours,
The Chairman said that there were a few details to be considered
such as finding a publisher who would trust them, artists who could
draw, and so on, but these might be discussed another, time;
He would renew his urgent appeal to them all to bombard the old
humbug, Punch.
A Speaker pledged himself toº the entire hog in the Commercial
Lavatory, and he thought he could get what he wrote copied into the
Morning Starfish.
Another Speaker said that he was for pitching into the Times also,
That was as much a clique as Punch, and he could say himself that
though he had been on the press for years, and had sent, to the Times a
book full of ...; articles as fº of his style, his contributions
had been returned unread. He knew that, for he had stuck little
pieces of paper, between the sheets, and, when he came to examine
them, they hadn't tumbled out. This was sheer insolence, and he would
say, pitch into the Times. -
A Speaker said that he never gave the Times any quarter in his letter
to the Duffers' Gazette. He would henceforth also give it to Punch,
hot and hot.
The Chairman said that they knew of course what to say. Let 'em
keep on declaring that Punch was not what it had been, that there were
days when it showed talent, but now its pictures were bad and its
writing worse, and that the public wanted a good slashing, dashing,
free spoken thing, that would make people feel uncomfortable, not
...i. who was to get into hot water next. That’s what they would
make the -
A Speaker said he hoped they wouldn’t be too prudish. Punch was
read, by the women, but he would write for men. They had no such
timid notions in Paris. Besides, he flattered himself he knew women
well, and he knew that they didn't think worse of a paper because they
could only enjoy it on the sly. (General applause.) -
It was then agreed that the forthcoming Cad should be puffed in
every way, that such papers as could be “got at.” should be loaded
with paragraphs in abuse of Punch, and that in all public houses fre-
quented by the meeting, the gentleman present should lose no oppor-
tunity of saying loudly to waiters, or to one another (if the waiters were
; lºsiº to discuss the matter with them), that Punch was very bad
Indeed.
The question of editorship then came up, upon which so fearful a row
ensued, that the landlord came up also, attended by a i. who
turned the literary gentlemen into the street. They have kept their
word, though, and the result has been, as Mr. Punch mentioned, the
shower of mud which has splashed his windows.
Silly snobs, go and pelt St. Paul's with your paragraphs. Or better,
wash and work, and be honest and civil, and don’t be envious, and some
of you may come to a decent ending.
Obadiah on the Earthquake.
AMong the numerous Correspondents of the Times on the subject.ºf
the Earthquake, there was one gentleman, who began his letter, with
“Respected Friend,” and signed it with “Thine” instead of Yours.
A particular account of the Earthquake was to be expected from a
Quaker. The Friends dislike titles of honour, but, Mr. Punch hopes
that this gentleman will permit himself to be called in future an
Earthquaker.

Schleswig and Holstein, Holstein and Schleswig, both with co-
ordinate compatibilities for an unrestricted development, claim terri-
torially as well as asthetically an invigorative restoration of entities,
based on analysis, verified by synthesis, and hallowed by sentiment.
Self-consciousness and conscientiousness are alike violated for the
few and for the many when a sceptical centralisation disturbs either by
traditional force or complicated legalities, the mesmeric adhesion of
individuality to the progress of idealism.

Disquisition upon the inherent right of mankind to associated oppo-

precedent, but it may be logical to interpolate a series of evidences
which if examined with due elaboration will serve as basis for a super-

PANIC IN BLOOMSBURY.
Now, capitalists, now is your time to buy houses... There is the most
awful commotion in what used to be thought the Genteel District all
round the British Museum. All the inhabitants are moving. Half a
dozen earthquakes wouldn't have done it. It reminds one of the rush
made in the same quarter when MR. Disnagli's friend, His Excellency
Captain Popanilla was in town. A wit had made an epigram against
the quarter, and everybody was rushing Westward. The same phe;
nomenon has occurred again. On Wednesday last, the Times explained
that the district in question:—
“Is now the economical quarter for Trading Respectability, as it was formerly
the splendid quarter of legal eminence and mercantile wealth.”
. The row at the breakfast tables that morning, when these lines were
incautiously read out, was something appalling. If the writer of that
paragraph values his life, and does not wish to encounter the fate of
Orpheus, let him keep outside the radius of a mile from 'MR. PANIzzi's
bust over the reading-room door. “Trading Respectability.” Many
a wretched husband got, that day, a stormy breakfast and a frigid
dinner. Many a domestic tragedy was enacted, the principal part by an
enraged matron who “never thought” to have been stuck down as a
respectable tradesman's wife. Many a street door was slammed—many—
But why dilate upon the melancholy part of the business? If this
distinct motification that the inhabitants are all plebeians frightens them
away, we shall get the property cheap for PROFEssoR Owen and his
inals.
Literary Announcement. |
The Court Journal, usually so preternaturally well informed, states |
at—
“MR. Sm”y BR**ks has a novel, on the Stocks, to be published,”’ &c. &c.
We believe that we have authority to say that, the subject of the
novel in question is not the Stocks, nor yet the Pillory. Either sensa-
tional topic, therefore, is at the service of other gentlemen.

is merely to say, as we have
said a thousand times,
THERE IS BUT ONE PUNCH, AND HE IS His own. PROPHET.
ORTHODOX CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
Is cruelty to animals contrary to Christianity? Not at all, must be the answer,
if the Censor at Rome is any authority on that question, and has penned the sub-
joined judgment on a little book entitled A Short Catechism on Humanity to Animals,
submitted to him, according to a statement, in the Times, by a lady who had
translated it, printed it, and was going to publish it for the edification of Italians
addicted to the torture of the lower creatures, horses in particular:-
“The little work has many inaccuracies. It supposes that humanity towards animals is a
Divine precept. It supposes that there exists in animals a right which a man ought to respect,
and it supposes that to be a good Christian one ought to be compassionate towards the beasts.
The mode in which the author-proceeds to prove his theme-makes manifest that he has
recourse only to the Bible, and to this interpreted according to his caprice.”
There is a declaration somewhere to the effect that a good man is merciful to
his beast, but this, by the rule of the decision above-quoted, is interpreted according
to private caprice if it is understood to mean that one ought to be compassionate
towards the beasts in order to be a good Christian. But is this morality? If the
Popº's, Censor is allowed to say so, the answer must be, “Ay, marry is tº
Infallible Church morality.” If he has erred in so saying, he is not fit for his
place, and the Holy Father, who gives Hats to sound Doctors, should immediately
give this unsound one the Sack. But there is good reason to suppose that the
orthodoxy of this Roman is at least as sound as that of any Spaniard; and if his
doctrine about humanity to animals, as above expounded, is a specimen of it, his
master might assign him the office of a bishop in Spain, in which capacity he might
be empowered to bestow the Apostolical benediction upon Bull-Fights.
| THE SIMPLICITY OF A WAR CHRISTIAN.
THE REVEREND HENRY WARD BEEcHER so worships the Union that he is ready
to sacrifice his son to it “faster than ABRAHAM was going to offer up Isaac.” This
looks like pretty considerable idolatry. One would think that MR. BEECHER
must be a queer sort of a Christian. So he is. MR. BEECHER is a War Christian.
†: less he says about ABRAHAM the better. His only ABRAHAM is ABRAHAM
INCOLN.
From MR. BEECHER's speech at Glasgow we are surprised to learn that the
deadly offence which we have given the Yankees, and for which they rail against us
with such rabid malice, and vowrobbery and murder against us with such venomous
hate, is want of sympathy. What! Want of sympathy with a people who are
struggling to prevent the disruption of their Empire? How can we, whose fore-
fathers experienced the calamity of revolted colonies, fail to sympathise with the
houses are going to fall, but ||
Ours:
loyalty of the descendants of their revolted colonists?
THE EARTHQUAKE.
ASHUDDER through this English land
From South to North; a moment's shock!!
Unmoved the towers and temples stand,
Only the houses somewhat rock,
And, being in their slumber shaken,
Sleepers in consternation waken
Near upon half-past three o'clock.
Stools, chairs, and tables stir and jump,
From mantelshelves some objects fall;
Some beds beneath their speakers bump;
Some plaster crumbles from the º
The frames of the awakened quiver,
Around them whilst their dwellings shiver,
And noises strange their minds appal.
Clºcks, stop, and bells in places ring,
Whilst to and fro foundations heave;
Gates, jangling, on their hinges swing;
Doors slam, panes rattle; folks believe
That thieves are breaking in; and under
There rumbles subterranean thunder,
As though of rocks in act to cleave.
Dogs; howl, or slink away infright,
Bºute cattle low; a sense of dread,
Dim consciousness that all’s not right,
Confounds the horned creature's head
Not less than man, upon his pillow-
Tössed by an earth-wave, like the billow
That rolls along on Ocean's bed.
'Tis well the human herd has felt.
In Mother Earth how frail their trust,.
Divided from the moltenbelt
Of Vulcan by how thin a crust;
Instructed, by the gentle wag
Of underlying fiery quag,
O'er what a gulf they tread the dust.
But minds, within the mortal brains
Which they inhabit, pondering, know
In what yet thinner tubes of veins
And arteries hath man's blood to flow
Throughout the finest nervous tissue:
And giving but a mere drop issue
Life's pipes were burst: all over so!
Such minds, that think above the hog,
The bleating flock, the bellowing kine,
Need no admonitory jo
Beneath them from the lava mine.
So, Jones, thou art serenely able . .
Earth and thy frame, alike unstable;
To trust alike in hands not thine.
“TIGRIBUS AGNI.”
It is difficult to comment lightly upon profanity, without
manifesting apparent irreverence... Yet who can write
gravely on, a Frenchman's profanity? His theology is
theatrical, like all else that is his. In fact he “thinks
theatre.” So, when GENERAL Forey told his Mexican
army that his master-
“Had in China planted the CRoss of CHRist, side by side with
the French flag.”
the poor, foolish, brave horse-soldier meant nothing but a
sentimental clap-trap.” He was not reproducing , the
emasculated blasphemies of M. RENAN. He was thinking
of the final tableau in a melodrama at the Hippodrome
orchestra braying, red fire blazing, populace shouting. An
with the FIRST Napoleon in a front place among the arch-
angels in the Madeleine, it is not wonderful that a servant
of the THIRD NApoleon should judge his employer entitled
to place a flag anywhere. Only it is half a pity.that such
things are translated for readers who also read history, and
may be disposed to think that if the French flag is to be
planted near any cross, it has sometimesmerited a position
near a cross to which reference was made by DANIEL
O'Conseul, when deducing an insulting pedigree for a
political antagonist.

BRITANNIA HOISTS HER STORM-DRUM.
Up with the drum that storm forebodes,
From the signal rigging flown;
The only puzzle’s about the modes
In which to point the cone–
For upwards tells of storms from East,
And downwards from Westward blown.
But if upwards or downwards who shall say,
Or opposite cones together,
When clouds so bank and blacken each way,
So thick, so charged with vengeful ire,
So laden with God’s own levin-fire,
It scarce may be but the storm must burst,
On the nest of the Great Black Eagle first.
But farther to South and more to West
The storm-clouds gather grim,
Where Dansker and Dutchy-man are prest
On Baltic's West-land rim,
Spirits of Wikings wake from sleep,
Who living loved the loud wild roar
Of elements upon the deep,
Or charged as fiercely on the shore,

Or, still less, prophesy whither. Welding the armour for wooden walls, --
-- Or shaping sword and spear, ---
Will the storm come from the nor’-nor’-west: And the white-hot metal splashing runs -
About the Great Black Eagle's nest ?
Where red stains freeze along the snow,
That fain poor Poland's dead would hide,”
But up the accusing corpses show,
With teeth set hard as when they died,
With face to Heaven, and breast to foe,
Their hands still clenching scythe or spade
That served for bayonet or blade.
Where skeleton-like the charred beams peep
Out of those sheets of winter's sleep,
That look so pure and shroud such sin;
Or a little hand shows here and there,
Or a silky curl of infant’s hair,
Still clasped the mother's hand within,
Who died so hard, yet could not save
The little one that shares her grave?
The clouds they draw to the nor’-nor’-west,
About the Great Black Eagle's nest,
Into the moulds of the mighty guns,
And growling thunder, near and far,
Roll up the sulphurous clouds of war.
Or comes the storm from the Banks of Spree,
Where “a little game” they’re at,
With the Hºjº', crown for pea,
And for thimble Dollf's his hat?
Comes the storm from the people's wrath,
Slow-roused, to sweep away
The bauble sceptre that bars the path
Of Prussia to breathing day? -
Comes the storm from the smouldering fires
Of “Federal” Execution, -
The breath of the Diet that never tires
Of its threats of Retribution?
Comes the storm from the clash in air
Of Pruss and Austrian Eagles?
Or from Franks with Prussians proud to wear
Their collars as Russia's beagles,

NATHANIEL HAwTHoRNE, author of the Scarlet Letter and the
House with the Seven Gables (you see we at once endeavour to create a
prejudice in your favour) you are a 'cute man of business besides bein
| a pleasing writer. We have often credited you with literary merit, j
your style, dear boy, puts to shame a good many of our own writers
who ought to write better than they do. But now let us have the new
pleasure of congratulating you on showing that you are as smart a man,
as much up to snuff, if you will pardon the colloquialism, as any Yankee
publisher who ever cheated a British author. You have written a book
about England, and into this book you have put all the caricatures and
libels upon English folk, which you collected while enjoying our hos-
pitality. Your book is thoroughly saturated with what seems ill-nature
and spite. You then wait until the relations between America and
England are unpleasant, until the Yankee public desires nothing better
than good abuse of the Britisher, and then like a wise man, you cast
your disagreeable book into the market. Now we like adroitness, even
when displayed at our own expense, and we hope that the book will
sell largely in America, and put no end of dollars to your account.
There was once a person of your Christian name, who was said to be
without #"; Most American pedigrees are dubious, but we think
you would have a little extra trouble to prove your descent from
NATHANIEL of Israel. In-a word, you are a Smart Man, and we can
hardly say anything more likely to raise you in the esteem of those for
whom you have been composing. Come, there is none of the “insular
narrowness,” on which you compliment us all, in this liberal tribute to
your deserts. You see that in spite of what Fº say, “these people.”
(the English) do not all “think so loſtily of themselves and so con-
temptuously of everybody else that it requires more generosity than you
possess to keep always in perfectly good humour with them.” You
will have no difficulty in keeping in perfectly good humour with us.
We areº: with you, too, on another point. You stick at
nothing, and we like earnestness. Not content with smashing, up our
male population in the most everlasting manner, you make the most
savage onslaught upon our women. This will be doubly pleasant to
our delicate-minded and chivalrous countrymen. And we are the more
inclined to give you credit here, because you do not write of ladies
whom you have seen at a distance, or in their carriages, or from the
point of view of a shy and awkward man who sculks away at the rustle
of a crinoline, and hides himself among the ineligibles at the ball-room
door. Everybody knows that you have had * e opportunity of culti-
wating ladies' society, and have availed yourself of that opportunity to
the utmost. Everybody in the world knows that the gifted American
Consul at Liverpool is an idoliser of the ladies, and is one of the most
ready, fluent, accomplished talkers of lady-talk that ever fascinated a
sofa-ſull of smiling beauties. His gay and airy entrance into a drawing-
room, his pleasant assurance and graceful courtesy, his evident revel in
the refined atmosphere of perfume and persilage, are proverbial, and
therefore he is thoroughly acquainted with the nature and habits of
English women. Consequently his tribute has a value which would not
appertain to the criticisms of a sheepish person, either so inspired with
a sense of his own infinite superiority, or so operated on by plebeian
mauvaise honte, that he edges away from a lady, flounders and talks
nonsense when compelled to answer her, and escapes with a red face,
like a clumsy hobbadehoy, the moment a #. lows him to do so.
No, no, this is the testimony of the lady-killer, the sparkling yet tender
Liverpool Lovelace, NATHANIEL HAwTHORNE, to the merits of our
English women.3
£, “English girls seemed to me all homely alike. They seemed to be country
lasses, of sturdy and wholesome aspect, with coarse-grained, cabbage-rosy cheeks,
and, I am willing to suppose, a stout texture of moral principle, such as would bear
a good deal of rough usage without suffering much detriment. But how unlike the
trim little damsels of my native land 1 I desire above all things to be courteous.”
Courteous. Of course. How can the drawing room idol be anything
but courteous?. He simply sketches our young ladies truthfully. Indeed
he says so :—
“Since the plain truth must be told, the soil and climate of England produce
feminine beauty as rarely as they do delicate fruit, and though admirable specimens
of both are to be met with, they are the hot-house ameliorations of refined society,
and apt, moreover, to relapse into the coarseness of the original stock. The men
are man-like, but the women are not beautiful, though the female Bull be well
enough adapted to the male.”
“The female Bull.” Cow would have been meater, and more enter-
taining, perhaps, to Broadway; but one would not mend after a master.
But our matrons. We rather, in our weakness, piqued ourselves
upon our matrons, with what we’ve thought their º: faces,
ready smiles, cheerful kindness, and tongues that, talk freely because
the hearts are innocent. Thanks to our Lovelace-Adonis, we now know
that, we must abandon this superstition. Here is his sketch of the
English married lady of middle age:–
“She has an awful ponderosity of frame, not pulpy, like the looser development
of our few fat women, but massive with solid beef and streaky tallow ; so that
(though struggling manfully against the idea) you inevitably think of her as made
up of steaks and sirloins. When she walks, her advance is elephantine. When she
sits down, it is on a great round space of her Maker's footstool, where she looks as
if nothing could ever move her. She imposes awe and respect by the muchness of
her personality, to such a degree that you probably credit her with far greater
moral and intellectual force than she can fairly claim. Her visage is usually grim
and stern, seldom positively forbidding, yet calmly terrible.”
Calmly terrible. Is not this a momentary weakness, NATHANIEL!'
Can any created woman be terrible to you? Away, eater of hearts.
You don't fear any matron. You show it in your next passage:-
“You may meet this figure in the street, and live, and even smile at the recol"
lection. But conceive of her in a ball-room, with the bare brawny arms that she
invariably displays there, and all the other corresponding development, such as is
beautiful in the maiden blossom, but a spectacle to howl at in such an overblown
cabbage-rose as this.”
Well painted, NATHANIEL, with a touch worthy of RUBENs, who was
we think, your great uncle, or was it MILTON, or THERSITEs, or some-
body else, who, in accordance with American habit, was claimed as
your ancestor. Never mind, you are strong enough in your own works
to bear being supposed a descendant from a gorilla, were heraldry
unkind. , Mr. Punch makes you his best compliments on your smart-
ness, and on the gracious elegance of your descriptions of those with
whom you are known to have been so intimate, and he hopes that you
ill soon give the world a sequel to Transformation, in the form of
an autobiography. For he is very partial to essays on the natural
history of half-civilised animals.
A GOOD WORD FOR THE POPE.
THE Tablet's own Correspondent at Rome writes as follows about
Yºsval, whom most people in their senses call the King
OF 1TALY:-
“The KING or PIEDMont has been seriously ill, but has, however, recovered his
usual health by means of very severe remedies, and the popular mind in Rome
connects his indisposition with the late devotions, a pretty clear indication that the
people have not lost their faith.”
That is to say, we presume, the faithful Romans believe that the
Sovereign abovenamed owes his recovery from his indisposition to the
devotions ordered by the Pope, which have rendered the operation of
the very severe remedies, resorted to for its cure, effectual. We rejoice
to learn that his Holiness prays for his enemies with such success as
lº which is attested by the restoration of the KING or ITALY's
Black and White.
THE KING of DAHOMEY is expected at St. Petersburg on a visit to
the EMPEROR of Russia. After a short sojourn with ALEXANDER THE
Second, his sable Alajesty will proceed to Wilma, and stay some time
with Gener AL MoURAVIEFF in order to witness the butcheries, which
are going on in Poland.

You will be considered a great man among them if you appear as a

Of course the first thing you’ll want to go and see is the Castle.
Well, you’ll have to go up a hill. This Castle was taken once by the
French, and once by MR.TURNER, the celebrated artist. The Electors
Palatine, who used to live here, were people of bon Tun, as may be seen
if you visit the cellar, where stands the celebrated Tun, on the top of
which, the peasants, when they were very jolly, used to dance. This
was when the vintage had been a good one, and the happy rustics were
living, on the vat of the land. There is some trick connected with a
fox's brush, that starts out of somewhere suddenly, and hits you
anywhere when you pull a string, of which we have some vague and
unpleasant recollection; if you don’t want to know anything about it,
don't pull any string, and you’ll be safe.
Of course, while you are at Heidelberg you will stop at an Hotel.
| Now the mention of an hotel naturally leads us to the subject of pickles.
You will be in a hurry to see the sights of the town, and desirous of
making a rapid act of feeding. No more rapid act can be made than
an attack upon cold beef and pickles. Tourist, beware in every place |H
of pickles. Few and far between are the instances of jars of these
luxuries being unadulterated. As a rule they are adulterated, and,
specially in Germany, with copper. Now, copper in this form is first
cousin to poison, and it is admitted on all hands that it is unpleasant to
be poisoned anywhere, but specially in Germany, and more, particularly
in Heidelberg. Now then the question is, do you understand the
science of Toxicology P If you can't pronounce this word, use any
other you like; such names are but arbitrary; but bear in mind that this
science has nothing to do with bows and arrows. On arriving therefore
at your inn, immediately inquire of the landlord if he is a Toxicologist;
the word may be sung or said according to fancy, powers of vocalisation,
or special opportunity. He may stammer out a reply, or he may not
understand you: in either case, Tourist beware, and having ordered at
once your cold collation, immediately attempt to detect the presence of
copper.
Now the first way to detect the presence of copper, is to offer the
lowest silver coin in your possession, and to ask for change for that
amount. If they are unable to give it you, be on your guard, lest all
the available copper may have been invested in pickles. If the sum in
the metal is given you, remember that it may be but the residue of what
has already been sunk in pickles. Cold steel will always attract copper;
and a ... Italian brigand, when in a genial and communicative
mood, once informed us that he had been able to detect the presence of
copper in a landlord’s pocket, by introducing a small and exquisitely
shaped dagger into the corporeal vicinity of that region. This is a
method which we would º advise the ordinary Tourist to adopt,
but as he loves his health and would avoid dyspepsia, let him study
Toxicology or whatever he likes to call it, and give his earnest consider.

Whether you look black or turn red upon being thus addressed, the

sHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
SchEME for opening Cre-
morne during the winter is
on foot. The attendants at
the cloak rooms will let
out great coats at so much
an hour, and tailors will be
at hand to let them out any
further, or take them in,
according to the size of the
wearer. The band will play
with their feet in hot water,
* - and the supperboxes will be
= lighted with tallow candles,
# in order that those ladies
- and gentlemen who are
- afflicted with colds in their
heads may have the favour-
able opportunity of gently
lubricating their unfortu-
natenoses. The Zoological
Gardens will lend their best
specimens of Wipers. The
refreshment-room managers
have already applied at the
Middlesex Sessions for a
licence to sell Gruel.
The Lord Mayor of
London will soon retire
from office. Theinhabitants
of Chamounix have offered
him, we hear, the chief
civil office in their village
him a bottle of Larose every Saturday night. The offer has been refused
in consequence of a jealous feeling, which, we understand, exists
between the English Mayor and the great Swiss Mayor of Mont
lanc, known everywhere as the Mayor de Glace.
Most of the good folks of England have had a “shake down for a
night” in the shape of the earthquake. Some people appear to have been
pitched into the middle of next week on the night, or rather the Heave
of the Convulsion.
The King of GREECE has been taking the Air of England, and the
Heir of England has been taking the KING of GREECE to all sorts of
amusements. By the way, if his Hellenic Majesty should rule, his
people after the Louis. Napoleon pattern, his style and title will be
changed to “His L.N.-ic Majesty.”
The question of the Rules to be observed at Football has been laid at
the feet of several Public School Professors of the Art. In consequence
of this a new club, members of which belong to Eton, Harrow, West-
minster, Winchester, and Rugby, respectively, has lately been formed
in order to arrange one General set of Rules for Football. They will
lay every Saturday afternoon. The name they have adopted is, “The
iserable Shinners.”
A Testimonial, we hear, is about to be presented by several scientific
bodies to MR. CRAMPLIN or CRUMPLIN, the great Astronomer, on
account of his recent discoveries of Meteoric Fire-balloons in the air.
A HUSBAND ON TIPS.
MY DEARMR. Punch,
WHAT nonsense they write about not giving fees to Railway
Porters.
º: me ask you a few questions. Never mind about answering
end.
Are you a married man?
Do you ever take your wife on railway journeys?
Has she much luggage?
Do you tip the porters?
Do you know how much more quickly the tipper is sent off with all
his boxes, than a non-tipper ?
Do you like a woman to be pleased, or do you prefer her sulky?
I am not going to make any deductions, but # you are able to put
this and that together, you will easily see what I mean, and will never
lend yourself to the nonsense of urging a man—that is, a husband—to
save a shilling at the expense of a scolding for having been half-an-hour
collecting two or three (eleven) boxes. Bachelors may be virtuous, if
they like. I seldom find that they do like.
Yours truly,

MRS. ALEXANDER BROWNRIGG’S REPLY TO
MRS. BULL.
MADAM,
I BEG to assure you it is only lest you should fancy I am
fluttered and embarrassed by the rustle of your foreign note paper,
that I condescend to make any reply to your impertinent remarks upon
the mode in which I think proper to conduct my branch establishment,
known as the Maison de deuil. Whatever their sufferings may be, you
have no right at all, Madam, to interfere between me and my appren-
tices. I know you demur to that term, and call them slaves, but they
are apprentices, and I am teaching them their business. I am teaching
them to love me, while eating the bread of humbleness over their
mourning.
You say that correction inflicted with whips of Russian leather is
an outrage on humanity. I presume, Madam, you have forgotten the
peculiar relation which exists between those on whose behalf you inter-
pose and myself. Their introduction to me was quite a business trans:
action. The deed of assignment by which as turnoyers they passed
into my hands was properly executed and attested, and two other
ladies were parties to the deed, one of whom Iregret to add has lately
turned her back upon mein a manner that etiquette will not permit me
to describe. With respect to the partition by which as you assert my
people's Constitution has been seriously affected, that subject has been
ventilated quite enough already.
No one then can deny that I have legal authority for confining, my
eople to their sewing machines, and depriving them altogether of their
iberty if they presume to use their tongues. I have told them re-
peatedly that if they dared to go-to-the-windows and look abroad,
so as to excite the compassion of strangers, I would certainly put them
in chains. If they murmured at their diet, I would have them severely
chastised; and if they sneered at my livery, I would set my dogs upon
them. These acts of disobedience they have committed, and I have
redeemed my promise... I am perfectly sensible of my responsibility.
Whatever my dreams of conquest may in earlier days have been (when
had great expectations from the sick gentleman, who is one of DR.
BuLL's out-patients), I have no desire now to win the affections of all
mankind, nor do I profess that my sympathies like-yours, Madam, at
present extend from pole to pole.
It is just possible, Madam, that you labour under the impression
that I have no friends, and may therefore beinterrogated with impunity.
A recent incident will show, that this idea is entirely destitute of foun-
dation. Some of my º: whom I had occasion to punish for refusing
to assist in putting the Royal Arms over my door, made their escape
into the adjoining premises of an eccentric but tender-hearted manu-
facturer of Prussian blue, who was standing on the wall of his house,
and innocently engaged in kicking the bricks from under his feet. How
my excellent neighbour acted, ought, Madam, if you have any capacity
for blushing, to suffuse your countenance with crimson. Did he write
me an expostulatory note? Certainly not, but having sent the fugitives
back with his best compliments, he offered in a most generous spirit, to
lend me any quantity of hemp from his garden, though I believe he is
cultivating it purely for his own use.
... I am now taking such steps as Ithink necessary for º these
ill-advised persons to a sense of their extreme wickedness, and when
they have saturated the straw...on which, they sleep, with penitential
tears, I shall be prepared to listen to their complaints, if they have
*f; and not till then. -
n conclusion, Madam, let me kindly warn you that any further
remonstrances on your part may be attended with unpleasant conse-
quences. I am quite willing to give you credit for your good intentions,
and shall always think of }. with profound respect, so long as you are
polite enough-avoiding French fashions—not to walkinto my shop.
I have the honour, Madam, to remain,

THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC BALLOON ASCENT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - -
THE well-known and justly celebrated intrepid aeronauts,
Messrs. GLAish ER and Coxwell, the other day landed at my place in
the country. Fortunately we had a large, and jovial dinner-party on
that identical evening, at which I had the honour of entertaining these
three gentlemen as my, distinguished guests. About twelve o'clock,
P.M., when we were just beginning to warm to our wine, MR. GLAISHER
felt the urgent necessity of communicating to the world at large,
through the medium of {. ºf columns, the interest-
ing discoveries that had been that day made.
Fº my Private, Secretary from under the table, where I suppose he
ad been bashfully concealing himself, and having wrapped a cool
towel round his head, (he was , nearly strangled, owing to some
uncertainty on the part of my friends as to the exact position of his fore-
| head), we placed pens and ink before him, and he at once took down
| from MR. GLAISHER's dictation, the .."g Account of the Great
Balloon Ascent, which I now forward to you, Sir, as containing matter
of interest and importance to the nation in general, and the scientific
public in particular. ,

to snow. The Dew point on the Hydrometer above zero became
saturated to 460; the weight of the water on MR. Coxwell's cubic
foot was affected by the Sun's ray.
At 5 o'clock the increase was obtained by a division, and we caught a
Blackened Bulb Thermometer reading with its rays and blacking the
eye of the Sun. Three miles above the shade somebody was taking
ozone powders; but he was exposed three months ago, and has been
a spectrum ever since. After this he extended from A to beyond H,
and his violet ends became numerous. The necessity of playing on
|other instruments prevented me from firing guns at MR. Coxwell.
| The view at this point was, like huge swans harmoniously grouped.
On the plain the trees moved with great rapidity, and after feeling
MR. Coxwell's bumps, we avoided a farm house and bounded on the
light earth. . It was most painful on opening my packages to see
the débris of MR. Coxwell quite uninjured. As for ourselves we had
several bruises, about the size of the equinox., PROFEssoR TINDALL,
filled with two bags of air, was washing the blackened bulb.
We descended at Temple Bar, six miles N.W. of — BLACKBURN,

hospitality sent his carriage to meet us at the Station. .
Justifiable Indignatien.
A HANDsoMe London lady of our acquaintance, who is the most
determined of sight-seers, flew into the prettiest anger when she heard
of the Earthquake. “If it had only been }. erſy advertised,” she
said, “we would all have gone down to Hereford, by express train, to
feel it. But it’s just like those provincials—they never can do anything
right.” A box for Manfred has done her a little good, but the Earth-
quake is still a sore subject.

THE QUIET ENGLISH READER."
A LEADER in the Post contained the fol-
lowing noteworthy remarks on a certain dif-
ference between the reading of girls and boys:
“Boys, on the other hand, take a sort of pride in
abstaining from all manifestation of feeling. They
will read the narrative of DAvid's contest with
GoLIATH with the same monotonous delivery as they
would read a º of genealogies. The boy who
attempted to r a lively or pathetic passage in
a tone , and manner befitting the subject would
inevitably be laughed at by all the other lads; and
be prudently declines to excite and encounter
such a storm of ridicule from his companions.”
Old MR. Scroggs, at his breakfast-table,
read the foregoing passage to his nephew
ToM, home for a holiday, and asked him what
he said to it. ToMat first replied that he didn't
know; but on being offered sixpence to ex-
press his thoughts, spoke as follows:–
“A chap hates showing off, and hates to
see another º show off. It’s all very well
for a girl; but for a boy—beastly. I’m told
I ought to read with feeling. I should just
hate to. A chap might as well dance about
in a crinoline. See how pretty, and clever,
and soft I am!—that’s as much as what a
fellow says when he reads and tries to come
it affecting. Groaning, and turnin * his
eyes to make other chaps cry, a bloke looks
so spooney—yah! Give us the kick.”
“Very true, very true, ToM; Iperſectly agree
with you,” said the old gentleman, “and, ToM,
here is half-a-crown for you instead of six-
pence; and I say, Tom, I wish that some of

papers say in their accounts of , weddings,

A NEW NORMAN CONQUEST.
WE have a thorough º respect for DR. NoHMAN MAGLEop,
the Editor of GoodWords, and we have watched, with considerable
pleasure, his somewhat recent contest with and complete victory over
the Presbyterian clergyman who edits the Record, and who is so vehe-
ment a supporter of the Church of England. The Record was so
shocked at DR. MAGLEOD for presuming to teach, that, children might
be º: up kindly and,cheerily, and permitted to be happy in this
world, that the Exeter Hall journal assailed the Doctor in a way which,
had it not been so excessively pious would have been excessively,im:
pertinent. So the stalwart and large-hearted Doctor rolled his assailant
over and over, amid the applause of the truly religious, and the groans
of the fanatics. The Record has not had such a shaking for a long
time, and we hope that the castigation he has been privileged to receive
may be blessed to him. But as we are desirous to prevent its being
supposed that DR., MAGLEQD is for indiscriminate, and undeserved
indulgence, we beg to submit a little bit from a capital paper in Good
Words. It describes the early struggles of a Scottish country school-
master. He toils away, cheered by a certain love-vision. The lady
is false:—
“She had not the pluck to stand by her master when the LAIRD of BLACKMoss
was pressing for her hand. And then the black curly hairs of the master turned to
grey as the dream of his life vanished, and he awoke to the reality of a heart that
can never love another, and to a school with its A B C and Syntax. But somehow
the dream comes back in its tenderness as he strokes the hair of some fair girl in
the class and looks into her eyes; or it comes back in its bitterness, and a fire begins
to burn at his heart, which very possibly passes off like a shock of electricity alon
his right arm, and down the black tawse, finally discharging itself with a flash j
a roar into some lazy mass of agricultural flesh who happens to have a vulgar look
like the LAIRD or BLACKMoss, and an unprepared lesson . "
Mr. Punch has been for years letting his tawse into lazy masses of
agricultural, flesh, until he has effected a marvellous reform in the
bucolic world. Many farmers are now known to express themselves
with something like good sense upon the topics of the day, their mode
of culture is much º: they have ceased to execrate the late Šm.
RoPERT PEEL, and Mr. Punch has very good hopes of their ultimate civi-
lisation. , So he sympathises with the master whose sensations are thus
yigorously described-not, of course, that Mr. Punch was ever crossed in
love, his chief trouble being torepel, with befitting gentleness, the sedulous
adoration of the softer constituents of the Census. But, referring to
the above extract, he would just say that if he were a Scotch boy whose
parents were looking out for a school for him, he should specially beg
that they would inquire whether the master had been happy in his
amatory arrangements. For it must be but a partial satisfaction, when
one has been exceedingly well wopped, to reflect that the last half-dozen
were given, not to oneself, but to the lout who carried off Miss MARY-
Venus te hoc, vulnere—it is not Wisdom but Love that is coming down
upon you with that most objectionable leather. And, æpropos of nothing,
we hope that the Presbyterian Record liked the tawse, as administered
to it by DR. MACLEOD. From the noise the Exeter Hall journal made,
we fear we must infer that it did not. But we give the poor Record a
splendid revenge—a good, spiteful, pious jeer at DB. MAGLEQD, for
having been complimented by that wicked Punch. Go it, Philadelphion.
ANOTHER KING WANTED.
WE read in the Churchman's Family Magazine and Dissenter's House-
hold Miscellany, that—
“In 1829 a grand tournament was held in Cheapside for the entertainment of the
French ambassador and his suite. . . . A wooden scaffolding was constructed
for the accommodation of the Queen and her ladies, but in the midst of the sports
it unhappily gave way, to the great alarm, but not the bodily injury, of its fair
occupants. KING Edward immediately ordered the carpenter to be hung, but on
the intercession of good QUEEN Philippa, rescinded his cruel sentence.”
Cruel! Hm, QUEEN PHILIPPA was a yery kind lady, and all that,
but—as we said, Hin. If the carpenter had time to do the work pro-
perly, and if no more tickets were issued than the place was intended to
Fº and if the unticketed public did not scramble up, and if the mob
played no larks with the supports, we really, do not feel, that we can
make any remark more tº the point than our above observation; namely,
Hm-with a slight addition, videlicet, that we wish KING EDWARD
would come back, for the benefit of certain railway managers. There
have been about a dozen needless accidents within the last fortnight,
and a King who would hint, as distinctly as did Edward, that, he
insisted on the lives and limbs of his subjects, being cared for, would be
a most blessed Domestic Institution. e should suggest his leaving
QUEEN PHILIPPA in the Elysian Fields.
Cruel Treatment of an Invalid.
A HELPLEss Invalid, whose case required peculiarly gentle treatment
at his atttendants’ hands, was the other day at Brighton placed, by his
doctor's orders, in a Bath chair, and, in this position, he was pulled
about by two of his own servants. Barbarous!

ºil ” in the place of “shall.” ft may be con-
sidered as a special example of Irish-English
grammar, being one of those distinctive beauties
of Hibernian composition, by which it betrays
itself everywhere in Yankee newspapers. The
other, is an instance of English Grammar, as
modified in the Cockney dialect, and consists
in the employment of an adjective adverbially,
or as, the noble grammarian himself might say,
adverbial. On the whole, perhaps, the noble
earl’s, epistle may be pronounced to be about
equally grammatical and dignified. Lord
LEITRIM's grammar may be, to write it, nothing
to nobody; but his dignity concerns his order.
A testimonial in honour of the magnanimity
displayed by the EARL of LEITRIM in the expe-
ient to which he resorted in order to spite the
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, should be imme-
diately subscribed for by the Irish nobility. An
ornamental pegtop, or an embellished paper kite,
would be a suitable form for a tribute to manly
resentment. But the fittest shape for the present
would be that of a coronet of co form
and moderately costly material, smartly laced,
ribboned, and otherwise decorated, especially
adorned with two auricular, appendages, and
surmounted with a tassel. This complimentary
cap should be moreover embroidered with an
inscription appropriating it to the head of the
ARI or Lefºrm, late Deputy Lieutenant and
Magistrate of that same, and late also in the
ommission of the Peace for Donegal and
Galway.
... The Government of Her Majesty has shown
its appreciation of the courteous and loyal
rebuke administered to it by this high-minded
Peer, by relieving him of his executive duties.
The testimonial which he has received at their
hands is the Sack.
Hint for the Cambridge Editors.
THE confessions which have been extorted from
the doctors, make one think that when SHAKs-
PEARE wrote of “the Bourne from which no
traveller returns,” he meant Eastbourne.
MR. PHELPS AS MANFRED.
MR. PUNgh hates to differ from anybody, as must have been observed
throughout his career. Specially, he hates to differ from his brethren
of the Press. But in this matter of the play, which is not a play, called
Manfred, he begs to state that having twice witnessed the same, he has
arrived at opposite conclusions from those of his literary contemporaries.
The revival is a great success—not what is called a first night success,
with a house full of paper, box-keepers stamping and clapping in
lobbies, and friends of the management pitching its own bouquets from
rivate boxes; but a real draw—the theatre crammed with §. Who
ay, and the attention as marked as the applause. So far he and his
contemporaries agree. . But he is by no means inclined to allow that
the getting up of the piece is the attraction. It is got up very ".
and there is one really fine scene, and there is an excellent ghost, an
a terrible corpse, and a dreadful grey spectre, and there is i. plenty
of music, which might be better, and better given. . But there are two
other “features” which, Mr. Punch respectfully submits, have a good
deal to do with the success. One is }. BYRON's §º and the
other is M.R. PHELPs's delivery thereof. Touching the first, Mr. Punch
. observe that possibly the poem had better not have been written,
and certainly it is not a play. BYRON, being a man of the world, as
well as a great poet, had the wit to see that the work was not adapted
for public performance, though SHELLEY, who was not a man of the
world as well as a great poet, was indignant that he could not get a
. with a still more hideous mystery, performed by decent ladies
and gentlemen. But, though Manfred is not a play, it is a magnificent
poem, and poetry, in spite of the sensationists, has yet a hold upon the
public heart. In the next place, MR. PHELPs delivers the whole of
the poetry in a masterly and powerful manner, acts admirably, when
the poet allows him a chance, and by various tones and touches of
artistic subtlety and finish presents an extraordinary portrait of an
impossible and yet imposing character. It is a relief to hear the
lofty utterances of a tragedian speaking poetry, after the various noises
in which nonsense has been heard so long. The cheers given to MR.

uts in his protest on behalf of author and actor,
at the scepticism which, perhaps not unnaturally,
refuses to believe that audiences accustomed to vulgar sensations can
relish anything better, and sets down their pleasure to the account of a
spectacle. Having thus relieved his min , he proceeds to add that
R. Rype R was impressive as the brave old priest, who is no more
afraid of the demon than is Manfred, but has better reason for his
courage, and that if it were the custom, which it is not, for a critic to
walk out of his box, come upon the stage before the audience, and kiss
a young lady as a reward of merit, Mr. Punch would have performed,
º: that ceremony, in the case of Miss Rose Le CLERQ, who
ad about twelve words to say, and said them, especially the last, in a
way which Mr. Punch—who never abuses the good gift of speech by
exaggeration,-unhesitatingly describes as exquisite.
A REGULAR GUY.
THE British Archaeologists, diversified their proceedings, at Leeds
with excursions, one of which was a visit to Farnley Hall. There,
according to a contemporary–
“MR. F. H. FAwkes received his visitors with great courtesy, and appeared to
take much pleasure in showing them his fine collection of pictures.”
The above-quoted report goes on to mention, amongst the paintings
of MR. FAWKES, several “choice works by GUIDo.” May we ask if
they included a portrait of one of the proprietor's ancestors, executed
by himself?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WISDOM AND LICENCES.
THR reports of the meetings of 'Magistrates, for the purpose of
deciding what Licences should be granted to places for public amuse-
ment, are somewhat incomplete. Mr. Punch has therefore the pleasure
of supplying the omitted decisions, which he thinks will, if possible,
increase the admiration of the public at the wisdom, absence of caprice,
and attention to fair play, which characterise the tribunal in question.
At the adjourned Meeting of Magistrates on Wednesday last the
following Licences for music and dancing were applied for:-
THE PIG AND WHISTLE, ISLINGTON.
The Magistrates said that Islington had been proverbially known as
“Merry Islington” for years. It could therefore want no more places
of amusement. Licence refused.
THE HAMLET THE DANE, STRAND,
The Magistrates said that no additional music could be needed near
St. Clement Danes. The beautiful chimes in the Church tower left
nothing to be desired, and if the inhabitants, wanted melody, let them
sit at their windows and listen to the Church, Licence refu
THE SNORTING PoRPoise, ALDGATE.
The Magistrates said that a public-house of that name had been
much complained of by the people at Kensington. -
The Applicant submitted that his was a different house, many miles
from Kensington.
The Magistrates said that the moral was the same. Licence refused.
THE CALLIOPE Rooms, CAMDEN Town.

1.nlectlon.
The Applicant, son to the former owner, said that it was from gout,
which was not exactly infectious.
The Magistrates said that if it was gout, it must have been occasioned
by his drinking too much, which showed that he was not a well-
conducted man, and not likely to have brought up his son properly.
Licence refused.
1THE DANCING BEAR, BILLINGseATE.
The Magistrates said that the impertinence of taking such a title,
when the applicant did not know that he should get a dancing licence
at all, was enough to disqualify him.
A 'Magistrate. It’s more than we can “Bear.” (Shouts of laughter
from the police.) Licence refused.
THE Roc's EGG, CHELSEA.
The Magistrates said that the Applicant must be an idiot, and there-
fore unfit to conduct a tavern. How could a rock lay eggs?
MR. BALLANTINE, as amicus curiae, would say that the pigeon called
a Blue Rock might. .
The Magistrates said that they would not sanction a place for the
cruel amusement of pigeon-shooting. Licence refused,
THE GILLIE CALLUM, HolboFN.
The Magistrates said that they understood that this house was to
take its name from a Highland dance between two drawn swords, and
that it would probably be performed in the tavern. As this was a most
angerous amusement, it could not be tolerated.
A Magistrate. Nothing should be drawn in a tavern except beer.
(Shouts of laughter from the police.) Licence refused.
THE TRAVELLER's Joy, DALSTON.
The Magistrates said that the Applicant evidently intended to evade
the law against supplying any persons not travellers on Sundays.
Licence refused.
THE FLowING Bowl, BROMPTON.
. The Magistrates said that they did not sit there to give a man a
licence to annoy his neighbours with bowl-playing, which also led to
gambling. Licence refused.
THE WINKING WHELK, HAMPSTEAD.
The Magistrates said that they had felt disposed to grant this licence,
but had been informed that the Applicant stuttered. This would lead
to incessant misunderstandings with customers, and what was called
chaft, which led to quarrels. Licence refused.
THE RAM OF DERBY, CHIswick.
The Magistrates said that twenty-seven bad cases had been proved
against him, the Applicant, and there were fights in his house every
night. Now as there were thirty public-houses in the street, his
might be closed without inconvenience, and if they heard of many more
murders in his tavern, they might not be so lenient another year.
Licence granted.
THE INFURIATED PERIwin KLE, WALworth.
The Magistrates said that they could not see that music and dancing
were wanted at Walworth. The neighbourhood had proved that it was
serious by erecting a large Chapel for MR. SPURGEoN, who was also
sufficiently comic for all purposes required. Licence refused,
WILKES AND HIS LIBERTIES.
“Mr. Washington Wilkes has lately been lecturing at the Whittington Club, on |
Mr. Pwnch and his treatment of the American question."
SMALL names aren't made great by large handles,
Nor is nonsense redeemed by a slashing tone,
And your WILKEs can't be more than your Wilkes,
Though pinned by the tail on to WASHINGTON.
“WILKEs and Liberty!” once was a cry
That through England could raise up a row;
But nor England, nor Punch cares a fig
For the liberties Wilkes may take now.
MR, WASHINGTON WILKEs against Punch,
To fire off his pop-gun is free.
Like the Navvy, when thrashed by his wife,
If she likes it, it doesn't hurt me.
Mr. Punch, spite of bluster, will write,
Mr. Punch, spite of Bunkum, will draw,
Nor ask leave of the smobs and the cads
With WILKEs their great Shala-balaw.
- The shoe he will fit to the foot,
Not caring whose toes, it may pinch:
For the right he will still liſt his voice,
And against both King Mob and Judge Lynch:
Honest truth he prefers in the nude,
To Bunkum arrayed in shot silks, º
And would rather be wrong with a BRough AM,
Than right with a WASHINGTON WILKEs
'Tis an old and good rule that the gun
To the game in proportion should be:
We don't use twelve-pounders to wasps,
Nor a broadside for crushing a flea.
Though WILKEs would be never so vain
A tap of our bâton to win,
Such use would the weapon profane—
One disposes of WILKEs with a pin'
A BRIDLE FOR HOTSPUR.
WE always feel, and upon occasion avow, our sincere admiration for
the sporting articles of the gentleman who signs himself Hotspur.
“ Not,” as the old Scotchwoman said of DR. Čiºns's preaching,
“that we wad hae the presumption to understand him,” but because
he has a cheery, cheeky way of writing, and moreover has enriched
racing literature with some new and effective phrases. We do not
know, of course, why he should say “I cannot stand one that sides
with this jacket,” when he may possibly intend to imply that he does
not wish a certain mare to win. But we sympathise with him in his
honest indignation with Umpire, of whom he has just observed:—
“ Umpire was my great card played out last year when I thought him certain to
win, and when he ought to have won, had he not, like a wretched brute, shut up
and refused to make an effort.”
We like his giving this beast a parting kick, and even when prophe-
sying his possible success for the Cesarewitch, calling him “that
rascal, Umpire.”. The horrible creature “shut up” again, whatever
that means, and lost. ...But Hotspur made one remark on which we
really must make another, and a condemnatory one. He said:—
“Limosina came with a tremendous rush a few days since in the turf market,
and Newmarket people vow she cannot lose ; but I hope she will, because that noble
owner to whom she belongs has an infatuation for scratching whenever he has an
opportunity.”
The nobleman is LoRD STAMFORD., Now, really, why a writer with
the interests of the turf at heart should desire that an animal should
lose, merely because his noble owner indulges in a habit which may be
vulgar—we do not defend it as an amusement in the drawing-room-
but which cannot be called vicious, we cannot see. Why should not
LoRD STAMFord scratch himself if his Lordship likes. We are not
likely to wish to abridge the right of the Press to censure, a bloated
aristocracy; but, bloated or thin, a nobleman is not prohibited by
Magna Charta from scratching. We hope that Hotspur will recon-
sider this doctrine, or we shall next have him hoping that a horse may
lose because his owner sneezes, or swears, or squints. Fair play, even to
turf men. However, Hotspur's mind is at ease, as the British Lioness
won, to the delight of MR. MeRRY and the KING of THE GREEKs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM OUR BILIOUS CONTRIBUTOR.
To MR. PUNCH.
N Second thoughts, Sir, (which
however are not always best)
I decline to reveal at any
length what took place in
the cabin of the Mariani.
Suffice it to state that there
was a very sumptuousrepast,
and that upon every eligible
seat, as also upon some seats
that were singularly ineli-
gible, there was somebody of
one sex or the other, and
that there was much intellect
among the males and much
beauty among the females.
My own tastes are simple and
abstemious, and I contented
myself as usual with a crust
and a glass of water, ..but
those who were not inclined
to such hermit fare spoke in terms of warm praise of the cool Moselle,
and in terms of high praise of the not too high grouse.
We dedicated a glass to the health of his Excellency, PRESIDENT
GEFFRARD, and some interesting information which his representative
gave us, in an eloquent speech, almost induced me to insist on j sent
on with the ship, that I might have the honour of * resented to a
ruler who administers his government so admirably. e trifling cir-
cumstance that the Mariani was . back to Glasgow for certain
additions, prevented my adhering to myſdemand to be left on board, and
my knowledge that you would i. unfavourably upon any details not
of a frivolous character prevents my giving you a description of Haiti,
and an account of the reforms and improvements which the President
has originated. I wish we had him as Viceroy of Ireland-not that my
friend CARLISLE does not do his work well, but we could easily find
another place for him where his elegant and floral ...; would
be amply appreciated. If you do not make things perfectly comfortable
for me when I come back, *. get my friend the Consul to accredit
me to PRESIDENT, GEFFRARD, and I shall go out, and represent to his
Excellency that all Haiti requires to become a Faradise is a Haitian
Punch, with myself as editor.
It may gratify your vanity to know that your own health was drunk
with much enthusiasm, and I hope that I shall be forgiven for the
eulogistic terms in which I referred to in my reply. My speech
was excessively neat, brilliant, and touc but I need not #:
because, though I do most things well, perhaps my public addresses
are my masterpieces.
I do not think that weran the Lights, out we asked for them, and the
hospitable Consul supplied not lights only, but something to light, and
while the younger part of the company danced upon deck, others re-
galed themselves, in tranquil corners, with smoke and meditation. The
scenery of Dunoon, Inellan, and the vicinity, leaves nothing to be
desired except a house there, and a couple of thousand it. to enjoy
one’s repose without toiling and moiling, both hateful operations.
There are some charming dwellings on the banks of the Clyde. I saw
one at Inellan which just suited me, a white house in a great flower
garden with a merry brook running down, it. At one corner of the
mansion is a turret window commanding a glorious mountain prospect,
and I felt, that sitting at that window would, assist me in maturing
many of the great thoughts which you will need for your *:::::::::
I was so pleased with this place that I rushed on shore and insisted on
remaining in the house, and so hospitable are the manners of the
inhabitants of those parts, or at least so hospitable were the manners of
the owner of this dwelling, that instead of extruding me, as might have
been expected, he took me prisoner, and detained me, under the strict
surveillance of a bright-eyed household guard, of eight strong, and I
got away, after several days, only on parole, which it is my intention
to redeem at an early date. I had every reason to complain of my
treatment here, because it made me dissatisfied with the treatment I
received at sundry other places which shall not be nameless.
Naturally I took it for granted that my luggage would not be left at
Oban for me. (I need hardly say that .*.*. think they emit
a clever thing in calling this place Holborn). But having had a large
portrait of yourself, with an extra foot or so of nose, painted in flaming
red and F. on all my boxes, that modest little mark attracted the
notice of everybody, and it was scarcely possible for such blazing
luggage to be neglected. So I found it at the Caledonian Hotel. I do
not know whether you are as hopelessly ignorant as to Scotch º:
as most people, or whether you are going to ask how I ; from Inellan
to Oban. *. mind telling you that I went round by Glasgow and
Paisley. Nay, I will be franker still, and state that in the course of
my journey I went to a delightful party, and heard, charmingly sung by
a young lady, a most energetic Confederate ballad, whereof this was the
conclusion:-
“She wakes 1. She stirs She is not dumb,
Hurrah 1. She spurns the Northern scum ;
She breathes, she burns; she'll come, she'll come,
Mary-Land, my Maryland 1"
If this information throws any light upon my route, you are welcome
to it, and if it don’t, you may stretch your imagination, never of the
liveliest, and see me at MR. CAMPBELL’s hotel above named, reveren-
tially examining one of his curiosities, a chair which was constantly used by
CHARLEs. The THIRD, King of England (do youthink Idared call him the
Y.P. in Scotland?) and taking perhaps almost as much interest in the
information that my host has built a fine new hotel at Oban, and that
it will shortly be opened. I hope some means will be devised for making
a clean path thereto, from the pier; for of all the black, soggy, muddy
bits presented to the Balmoral boot, on its Scottish wanderings, that
walk from the boat to the town is the most aggravating. As the literary
police are now paying domiciliary visits to the hotels of the nation, I
am happy to mention that MR. CAMPBELL’s charges were what, in the
first line of his celebrated poem of Hohenlinden, he says the sun
was
There are natural beauties, I believe, at Oban, but at present it is
chiefly used as a place to get away from. You steam thence to Staffa
and Iona, alsº to the point where you take coach for Glencoe. I visited
these places, but as none of them invites either ill-tempered or amusing
remark, I could say nothing about them that would be acceptable to you.
I may justmention, however, that what the Highland woman sold us as
goat’s milk on our way to Glencoe may have been that, but I saw no
goats and I saw several cows. Further, a coachman, who wore the
curious inscription opistTION round his hat, carried his opposition to the
extent of making a statement opposed to truth, touching the fulness of
the rival vehicle, and moreover got nothing thereby. I also tender .
respectful thanks to a gentleman who was on the top of the coach, an
who sympathised with me in my satisfaction that a heavy storm'enabled
us to see Glencoe's stern features to advantage; but I am not thanking
him for his sympathy, but for his patient endurance of my gymnastics,
§: nearly sent him off the vehicle into the raging river, while I was
rantically, searching my nineteen pockets for my coach tickets.
He even took, up an elegant child with long hair and nursed that
elegant child, , in order to , give me, more room, for my furious
researches, and he receives his reward in being thus publicly told
that his conduct on the ninth of September was duly appreciated by
yours truly.
Re-embarking, we proceeded to somewhere else, and ultimately §§
to Benjamin Nevis. Of this BRooks says (in his Gazetteer) that "it
is a mountain in Scotland, near Fort Wºliń. in the shire of Inverness.
It is esteemed the highest in Britain, rising more than 4,300 feet above
the level of the sea, its pointed summit capped with snow.” I have
nothing to add to MR.BRooks's observations, made in 1794, except
that the mountain is still in the same place, and is, I believe, about the
same height... I sat down before Benjamin, on an iron something con-
nected with the canal, and I presume he saw by the resolved expression
of my face that it was no use playing off his usual tricks upon travellers,
who come away complaining that they have never seen the top. After
a little preparation, he took off all his #! caps, and gave me several
views of his pointed summit, snow and all. It seems ungrateful to add
that I have been more struck with mountains that don’t rise so high
above the level of the sea, and perhaps B. N. knows what he is about
in keeping up his misty mystification. Somebody told me I ought to
have asked for the Jew off Ben Nevis, but I do not think that there are
any Jews in Scotland, except the Aberdeen people, who are supposed to
be the Lost Tribe.
Owing to some real biliousness (unfeelingly jested at by yourself). I
was not in the pleasantest temper at Bannavie—where the hotel under
Ben Nevis is situate—but I was recalled to my native sweetness of
disposition by the pleasure I experienced, while taking my penultimate
weed, at hearing a great discussion outside the said hotel. Scotland is
over-run with Tourists just now, and all the inns are crammed. Ours
was crammed, and there is no other at Bannavie, and behold, up came
an omnibus with sixteen more Tourists, male and the reverse, who had
been steaming up from Glasgow since seven in the morning, and now
arrived, tired, hungry, and savage, to be politely informed that there
were no beds for them. Great swells were some of these arrivals, and
also angry Paterfamiliases, and explosive matrons. We packed'em all
off-I don't know where they went to, some to the hovels, some to Fort
William, I fancy; but weren’t they in a rage? Serve 'em right—if they
had arrived, as I did, at three instead of nine they would have secured
beds, and laughed at later comers as I ºf: at them. And so, with
peace in my soul, and smiles on my lip, I slept soundly at the foot of
the big mountain.
Yours, respectfully,
Craig Phadric, Interness EPICURUs Rotundus.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(October 24, 1863.
How, when AND WHERE P
oR. THE MODERN Tourist's GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
ow here we are going into
Switzerland as quick as
possible if you please, as
there’s not much time to
be lost, for the Vacation is
just coming to a close, and
some of us must be back to
our griefs and briefs in the
Classic Aula Pumpeii,
otherwise known as Pump
Court, Temple, or else-
where.
An air of repose charac-
terises the face of Swit-
zerland, and the observant
traveller may gather that
the country is rather in-
clined to sleep, from the fact
that he will continually
see ranges of mountains
rising and stretching away
in the distance.
The Tourist intends to
ascend the steeps ? Does
he indeed, then once for all
we don’t ; albeit we may
give some good advice;
and first and foremost as
the unaccustomed Traveller
may possibly catch cold in the Alpine heights, he should be careful to
provide himself with an Alpen-stock to wrap round his easily-affected
throat. Beside this you should carry a Swiss pipe whereon to play as
you walk lightly o'er the eternal snow, and a good collection of magic
antern slides to take you rapidly over the seas of ice. -
Talking of ice, you must not be disappointed at not finding much of
the Wenham Lake material up here. The Railway will of course make
some difference in this respect after a time, and MR. GuntER may be
induced to speculate. A Lake or Tarn of Fresh Strawberry Water, by
Sunset, ji be a fine subject for MR. TELBIN’s brush, and, as every
spoon of a Tourist is accompanied by a tourist's glass, we want, but
i. pretty girls to hand wafers and sponge-cakes to us and the thing
ls done.
In regard to dress, adopt a gentlemanly evening suit; you will never
require a change of boots; as, after an hour's walk over the ice, they will
of their own accord become slippers. A false nose, and, burnt cork,
wherewith to make moustachios, as usual.
Diet.—For Breakfast ask for stewed zwanzigers and cotellettes à la
pommade. There is no other meal during the day, but you can repeat this
one as often as you feel disposed. During the repast the good-natured
waiter will read to you, sing one of the songs, or dance one of the
enlivening dances of his own native land. .You must, unless you would
be accused of rudeness, encore every one of his performances separately.
Money. Swiss Batz–This coin is no longer a legal tender, in conse-
quence of so many Swiss Batz having been given in exchange for the
English Kites, which had been flown by certain of our unprincipled
compatriots in the º: -
Conveyances.—Recollect that your driver, being a poor boor of a fellow,
always requires some pour boire money, by way of a parting gift. The
travelling lawyer will observe, that, in all countries, an intimate connec-
tion exists between a conveyancer and his draughts.
One of the first places to which you will be taken, will probably be
Arth. So rare is the stranger's visit in this quarter, that even
the most civil officer meeting the Tourist in the street, will start
back with astonishment, and ask, “What on Arth he’s doing
there?” Being a man of spirit, you will at once quit the place, and
proceed to Basle. The distance of Basle from anywhere is just three
Basle-ycorns and a half. At the hotel called the Three Kings, you
will find the servants very attentive, so don’t say anything before them
that you do not wish them to hear. They are so attentive, that it will
be well for the visitor to blow through the keyhole of his bed-room door
every five minutes, to see if the waiter is listening outside; then to
search well the chest of drawers, rattle your umbrella up the chimney,
and look in every corner for these attentive inn-dependents. Of
course you do not want to follow the regular route, but intend to go
backwards and forwards and round and round as suits your fancy.
While on the subject it would be as well to state, that no steamer ever
sailed round Switzerland in six hours. Berne is the quaintest of places.
There was not much to be seen when we were there, but this fact was
probably owing to our arriving at eleven o’clock on a very dark night.
Go early and you’ll be delighted. The clock is the most striking object
in the town. As the Tourist cannot possibly be satisfied with anything
until he has seen Zurich, let him hasten there at once, and, put up at
the hotel on the Lake.
... One of the curiosities of this spot is the garden attached to the hotel;
it is so much attached, that although for years it has been perpetually
going down to the water, it has never yet been able to take the last
steps necessary for the separation. A touching site this, touching the
Lake; and by the way, touching the Lake, words are wanting to convey
to the absent Traveller any idea of its beauty. Let us see; you know
the Serpentine, or the ornamental water in the Green Park? Well—
no it won't do, our powers of description fail us.
Now is the time and place for a romantic adventure. There are a
º of Zurich's fair daughters living on the borders of the Lake.
his mode of existence is, however, not, exclusively confined to these
delightful creatures, but is also adopted by two or three landlords and
lodging-house, keepers, who also live on the boarders. By the way,
here is a curious phenomena for our astronomers. Late at night the
fair damsels come out to look at the moon on the water in a boat. All
you’ve got to do is to hide under a ripple, and gently rising from the
stream, like a river-god decked with weeds, and a short pipe in your
mouth, whence shall issue sounds most dulcet; and the fair ones must
be a most dull set indeed if they do not at once yield themselves cap-
tive to your fascinations.
In a charitable spirit visit Schaffhausen, but do not make any severe
observation on The Fall, remembering that we are all liable to err, and
also recollecting that, if the landlady of the Falls Hotel provide incheon,
you will be liable to her. --
We did not think much of ==
the food here, but this –
isn’t the place to cut it up. -
Go back to Zurich. In
the morning patronise the
bath in the hotel garden.
Plunge bravely in head-
foremost, but you must be
able to swim, for there is a
depth of at least four feet
of water.
Your next point will be
the Righi, if you want to
“do” the Righilar thing;
if you do not, you will
cross the lake and try to
get over the mountains to
Interlachen. The moun-
tains are not to be got
over with soft words,
persuasion being in this
case less useful than force,
with a good thick stick.
Do you want to see
one of the great beauties
of mountain scenery with-
out much trouble? You
do? Very well, then;
lose all your luggage, ready money, clothes, and circular notes, and
you’ll thus commence by being brought to a very pretty pass.

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
DURING KING GEORGE's brief stay in England, the following evident
misprint was perpetually occurring in the current Court Circular.
Here, for instance, is a paragraph extracted from the C. C. in the Times,
dated October 8:— p
“The Kng of THE GREERs and the PRINCE or WALEs, attended by LIEUTENANT
FUNCH and CAPTAIN GREY, left Marlborough-house yesterday morning for Richmond
Park, and went shooting with the DUKE or CAMBRIDGE.”
Observe, LIEUTENANT FUNCH ! Ha! Ha! Absurd error. The
public, of course, have long ago made the necessary correction, by
substituting for the initial “F,” the ever sweet, “P.”. Before leaving
town, KING George AGAMEMNON received an address from the Statue
of Achilles in Hyde Park, and promised to write to him from Greece.
A Cockney Correspondent has written to caution us against catching
cold when we visit the Adelphi. Theatre. In consequence of the
recent improvements and alterations which have been made in the
Auditorium for the public º the stalls, says our Bow-bell
adviser, are vel-vet with the tears shed at Miss BATEMAN's Leah. By
the way 3propos of the great subject of Steam Rams, MR. Buckstone
is, we hear, thinking of reviving at the Haymarket the extravaganza
of the Golden Fleece. -
The Desert Flower is blooming in Covent Garden, and the balmy airs
which now float about the Opera House, are already beginning to
breathe their fragrance over the loud and soft, pedals of the drawing

EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCIENCE.
We are informed that the following was one of the Botanical questions
set at the written examination for the M.D. degree at the Edinburgh
University:—
“British dichlamydeous plants with a regular gamopetalous epigynous corolla
quaternary symmetry bicarpellary dispernal fruit and hard albumen.
“Give the natural class, sub-class, section, order, and genus.”
Don't, please, laugh at the
put... It could not be prop
ocution.
But what necessity is there for asking a candidate for the degree of
Doctor of Medicine any such question? Suppose a patient labouring
under some obscure disease. Would he, i. that were a disease of
the brain, which had affected his intellect, choose a physician for ability
to tell him the natural class, sub-class, section, order, and genus of
British dichlamydeous plants with a regular. gamopetalous epigynous
: gatemay symmetry bicarpellary dispernal fruit and hard
unnen r
Would he not rather naturally and reasonably suspect that the profi-
ciency in minute botany, necessary to enable a man to answer such, a
question at a moment's notice off-hand, indicated a mind especially
devoted to other things than medical science and practice proper?
Can minute botany, not to speak of the knowledge of simples, set to
a leg? No. Or an arm 2 No. Or take away the grief of a wound P
No. Minute botany hath no skill in surgery then? No. Hath it any
more skill in medicine? Certainly none whatever. A detailed acquain-
tance with the fashions for the month would have considerably more.
A dichlamydeous, lady, with her double wrapper, is an object whose
investments, considered with regard to the season, may possibly have a
bearing on her health; and a regular gamopetalous epigynous corolla
may, though as epigynous looking very smart, and, as gamopetalous,
calculated to invite addresses, be an ornament unsuitable for a bonnet
affording sufficient protection to the head.
Surely, then, the brain stuffed with as much botanyasaquestion such as
the foregoing is calculated to exact is too likely to be a hortus siccus—a
brain dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage, abounding in strange
places so crammed with vegetable details, as to have small capacity for
medical observation; and particularly destitute of reflecting organs.
The examining Doctors of the University of Edinburgh should perse-
vere in the line of examination above instanced if they wish their
brotherhood to consist of members whose memory is all their intellect,
and if they particularly desire to exclude from it all thinking men.
º words in which the above question is

HUSH! WAS THAT THUNDER:
As when a quivering Summer day is drawing to a close, ..."
And the Sun is lighting up with flames cloud-mountains where he rose,
And the air is hot and wandering, and silence holds her reign,
When men do stop and gaze aloft, and then hurry on again—
And the trembling murmur whispered along the vaulted sky
Is the signal for the clouds to ope their dread artillery—
So now a storm is gathering with the darkness of the time,
And its magnitude is all that will make it seem sublime;
It still is out of ear-shot, but we see its lightnings gleam,_
It is coming—and the thunderings are nearer than they seem—
Each nation gazes upwards and wraps her cloak around
And shudders at the first large drops upon the peaceful ground
It is coming—o'er the heavens are gathering lurid clouds
And men and women toil and work at Thunderbolts and Šhrouds.
SCRUPLES IN GOOD SOCIETY.
LADY GLAMIS, º to give evidence in a court of law, at
St. Alban's, declares her, readiness to tell all that she knows, but
declines to take an oath, believing that it is breaking the third com-
mandment to appeal, to the Supreme Being in reference to a trifle.
Legally, of course she is wrong, because, the law ordains the oath.
Theologically, she is wrong, because theology teaches that petitions
should be addressed for small things as well as great. And she is
wrong on the common sense question; for the honesty or dishonesty of
a person's character is not a trifle, and that is what an action virtually
establishes. On the other hand, such a scruple, defensible or not, is a
fact, and it is also a fact that LADY GLAMIs was turned out of court
and justice denied, as it would be in the case of many other excellent
persons who cannot make up their minds to declare their belief in an
Inferno. Perhaps, now that a Lady, whose name is in the Peerage
has been thus treated, the attention of the Legislature may be directe
to the consideration whether a Conscience ought, necessarily, to be a
convertible term for an Outlawry.

BORN, MAY 21, 1772.
DIED, OCTOBER 12, 1868.
AnºthHR high head bowed unto the grave,
That bore its weight of well nigh five-score years
Lightly as weaker trees their honours wave,
'Neath fifty autumns' joys, griefs, hopes and fears.
He lived out the Republic of the West,
hose cradle with his own stood side by side,
On manhood's verge he stood, when France from rest
Woke Earth's dead bones, and shook thrones far and wide.
Long times of mighty wars he had lived through:
He had watched wondrous growths of peaceful arts—
All that most moulds our manners, through and through,
Resting or moving, in our homes and marts,
He had seen grow from thought on into seed,
From seed to shoot, from shoot to forest-tree,
And through that hundred years' great thought and deed,
Ever in vanward of the fight was he...
A keen, cold, clear, if not deep—seeing eye,
An eye that looked on life as most men look ,
On mathematic symbols, turned away
By no unmastered passion from the book.
A brain, in whose clear depth facts ordered lay,
For the calm will to fetch and rank and use,
A mood that with life's business blended play,
Yet never play and business would confuse.
Not his the restless and far-reaching mind.
That from its Pisgah's height sees promised lands,
So keen to mark the present, it seemed blind
To all that lay past reach of eyes and hands.
A mind conservative of progress gained,
Rather than onward urging; ranging still
With those who stoutly the old ways maintained,’
And yield no foot of vantage by their will.
But years had brought him wisdom and their calm :
The clear head still was clear, the vigorous brain
Still wrought as potently, but like a balm .
A gentleness blent with its sternest strain.
And at the last he stood, remote, revered,
Upon his pinnacle of heaped-up years,
Ofd; blots and party scandals cleared,
rave and sedate in council with his peers.
No living mind took in so wide a range
Of life, no eye more piercing in its scan
Gauged, from its lonely height, the scenes of change,
Through which his secular experience ran.
How many links break with his closing life,
And bid us count the few grey heads that stand
Landmarks of that half-century of strife,
Whose hard-won conquests have enriched our land.

THE NEW AND DELIGHTFUL METHOD OF BRUSHING THE HAIR WITH
MACHINERY.
ORDER T ORDER I
A MEETING of the Common Council was held the other day at Guildhall for the dispatch of
business. A full report of the peaceful nature of this highly respectable conclave has not yet
been given. The following was the order of the day:- -
At 12.15. The Court in Guildhall was quite full.
At 1230. The Lord Mayor was about to take the chair, when a worthy alderman who
had been in hiding behind the chair-back ever since ten o’clock on the same morning, suddenly
drew away the chair, and the LoRD MAYor fell heavily to the ground. (Roars of laughter,
during which the perpetrator ºf the jest bowed his acknowledgments and retired.)
The Lord Mayor on rising said, that he had to tender—(ironical cries of “too tender!"
“pooh /*)—he did not wish to be misunderstood (“Miss who?” from a sheriff, who was immediately
bonnetted)—what he said was—(A voice, supposed to belong to a Deputy, “Never mind what it
was; what is it?” Cries of “Hooray!” “Who's afraid?” and immense cheering)—that he had to
tender his best thanks. (Screaming, whistling, snatches of popular songs for the space ºf ten
minutes). He thanked them for the patience with which they had listened to him. (“Song /
song /* “Hot Codlins.”)
The Lord Mayor said that he could not sing. (“Gammon.")
. UNDER-SHERIFF GAMMON rose quickly to
inquire if any gentleman had, called , upon
him for a song? (“Sit down /* “Shut up."
“I say, Gammon, where’s the Spinach f"

The LoRD Mayor said that he should be
happy to oblige them with “Hot Codlins,”
but unfortunately – (cries of “Throw him
over!” “Turn him out /* “Off, Off.”) He
should like to come at once to business.
(“No, No!” from everybody, and “Yes,

MR. ALDERMAN DARIN was understood
to say that he wished to speak about the
Organ nuisance in the City. He heard one
at that moment outside—(Breathless silence.)
The Chairman of the Royal Entertainment
rose to suggest that they should have a
dance. (“A Dance / A Dance / Hooray /*)
He hoped he might have the pleasure of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM OUR BILIOUS CONTRIBUTOR.
To M.R., PUNCH.
MY DEAR SIR,"
EMBARKING at Bannavie very early in the morning-diluculo
surgere saluberrimum est, but it is also particularly disagreeable-1 was
upon the Canal of the Caledonians, on my way to the Capital of the
Highlands. This is the last voyage which, upon this occasion, I shall
have the pleasure of describing. The vessel was commanded by
CAPTAINTURNER, who is a remarkable meteorologist, and has emitted.
some wonderul weather prophecies.
Having had, moreover, much
opportunity of observing character, in his capacity of captain of boats
chiefly used by tourists, he is well acquainted with the inmost nature of
the aristocracy and their imitators. Being myself of an aristocratic
turn of mind (as well as shape of body) it was refreshing to me to sit
with him on the bridge and speak of our titled friends. - -
Fort Augustus, which we passed, is not called so from having been
built by the Roman Emperor of that name, quite the reverse. The
next object of interest is a thing called the Fall of Foyers, which latter
word is sounded like fires, and the announcement to Cockneys that they
are going to see the affair, leads them to expect something of a
pyrotechnic character. It is nothing of that sort. The steamboat is
moored, you rush on shore, and are instantly arrested by several pike-
men—I do not mean soldiers of a mediaeval date, but fellows at a gate,
who demand Fourpence apiece from everybody landing in those parts.
Being in Scotland, this naturally made methink I had come to Johnny
GroAt's house, but no such thing, and Lhave no idea of the reason of
this highway robbery, or why a very dirty card should have been forced
upon me in proof that I had submitted. We were told to go up an
ascending road, and then to climb a dreadfully steep hill, and that then
we should see something. For my own part, I felt inclined to see
everybody blowed first, but, being over-persuaded, I saw everybody
blowed afterwards, for that hill is a breather, I can tell you. How:
ever, I rushed up like a mounting deer, and when at the top was told
to run a little way down again. I did, and saw the sight. You have
seen the cataracts of the Nile? It’s not like them. You have seen a
cataract in a party's eye. It’s not like that... Foyers is a yery fine
waterfall, and worthy of much better verses than some which, l
Burns addressed to it in his English style, which is vile. Still, the
waterfall at the Colosseum, Regent's Park, is a good one, and has this
advantage, that you can sit in a chair and look at it as long as you like,
whereas you walk, a mile to Foyers, g by the sailors from the
vessel, who are perpetually telling you
allowed about three minutes and, fourteen seconds to gaze upon the
scene, when the sailors begin to goad you back again, frightening you.
with hints that the Captain, will depart without you. Precious hot
you come on board, with a recollection of a mass of foam falling into an
abyss. That is not the way to see Foyers, and I hereby advise.
tourists who are going to stop at Inverness, to drive over from thence,
take their time at the noble sight, and do the pier-beggars out of their
fourpences.
This day was marked by an incident which—I am not now jesting-
may be noted. There was to be a great banquet at Inverness, to com-
memorate the opening of the new Highland Railway. The Chairman
was an aged statesman, member for Coventry. We took him and
some friends on board on our way. It was his last excursion. He
presided at the banquet with dignity and tact. That day week, he was
at rest. All men to whom 1 spoke of him in the Highlands had a kind
word to say of EDward ELLICE.
The stately towers of the Capital of the Highlands are seen on our
right. A few minutes more, and we are moored. Friendly voices hail
us, and also hail a vehicle. We are borne away. There is news for us.
We are forth with—even in that carriage, were it possible—to induct
ourselves into the black trix ws x rs of refined life and the white cravat
of graceful sociality, and to accompany our host to the Dinner of the
Highland railwaymen. We rail. We have not come six hundred miles
to dress for dinner. Our host is of a different opinion, and being a host
in himself, conquers our single-handed resistance. We attend the
dinner, and find ourselves among Highland Chieftains plaided and
plumed in their “tartan array.” (Why doesn't HoRATIO MACCULLoch,
noble artist and Highlandman, come to London and be our Tartan
R. A.P) . We hear wonders of the new line, which is to save folks the
trouble of visiting the Lost Tribe at Aberdeen, and is to take them
direct from Inverness to Perth, through wonderful scenery. We see a
programme of toasts, to the number of 34, which of course involves 68
spetches. There is also much music by the Volunteers—not, happily,
by bag-pipers. We calculate, on the whole, that the proceedings will be
over about four in the morning. Ha! haſ Dremacky. There is a
deus er machiná literally, a driver on an engine, and he starts at 10.
* We perfectly understand this advance towards civility as the writer approaches
the end of his journey. He is a superior kind of young man, if not the genius he
imagines himself.-Bal.
to make haste, and you are:
Numbers of the guests must go with him. Claymore / We slash
out the toasts without mercy—without mercy on men set down to
speak and who have spoiled their dinner by thinking over their im-
promptus. But there is one toast which shall be honoured, yea, with
the Highland honours. Mr. Punch's health is proposed. It is well
that this handsome hall is built strongly, or the Highland maidens
should dance here no more...The shout goes up for Mr. Punch.
Ibrlieve that I have mentioned to you, once or twice, that I am an
admirable speaker, but upon this occasion I surpassed myself—I was in
fact, as the Covent Garden play-bills say, “unsurpassingly successful.”
Your interests were safe in my hands. I believe that no person present
heard a syllable of what I said. It was this:
[It may have been, but as what our Correspondent has been pleased to send as his
speech would occupy four columns, we prefer to leave it to immortality in the
excellent newspaper of which he sends us a “cutting.” We incline to think that
he was weak enough to say what he says he said, because he could not have invented
and written it out after a Highland dinner, and it was published next morning. It
is extremely egotistical, and not in the least entertaining.—Ed.]
Among the guests was a gentleman who owns the mare who will
certainly win the Cesarewitch. I know this for a fact, and I advise you
to put your money on Lioness. His health was proposed, and he returned
thanks with the soul of wit. I hope he Hº: the hope expressed
by the proposer touching a certain Saddling-Bell. I thought it rather
strong in “Bible-loving Scotland,” but to be sure, we were in the
Hºiſi, which are England, or at all events where, the best English
spoken in Scotland is heard,
We reached our house at an early hour, and I was lulled to a gentle
slumber by the sound of the river Ness. This comes out of Loch Ness,
and in the latest geographical work with which I am acquainted, namely
“Gºtographp @natomix', by PAT. GoRDON, M.A.F.R.S. Printed for
ANDR. Bell, at the Cross Keys and Bible in Cornhill, and R. SMITH,
under the Royal Exchange, 1711,” I read that “towards the North-west
part of Murray is the famous Lough-Ness which never freezeth, but
retaineth its natural Heat, even in the extreamest Cold of Winter, and
in many Places this Lake hath been sounded with a Line of 500 Fathom,
but no. Bottom can be found” (just as in the last rehearsal of the artisans'
play in the Midsummer Night's Dream), but I believe that recent experi-
ments have been more successful, and that though no lead plummet would
go so deep, a volume by a very particular friend of mine was fastened to
the line, and descended to the bottom in no time, I will mention, his
name if he is, not kind, to my next work, but at present I have the
highest esteem and respect for him. I only show him that I know this
little anecdote.
There were what are called Highland. Games to be solemnised'in
Inverness. Iresolved to attend them, and, if I saw fit, to join in them.
But I was informed by a Highland friend of mine, LAIDLE or Tondie,
a laird much respected, that all competitors must appear in the kilt.
As my own graceful proportions, would look equally well in any
all costume, this presented no difficulty, and Imarched off. to MR. MAC-
Doug ALL, the great Highland costumier, and after walking through a
dazzling array of Gaelic glories, I said, mildly,
“Can you make me a Highland dress?”
“Certainly, in a few hours,” said MR. MAcDoug ALL; but somehow
I ſancied that he did not seem to think that I was displaying any vast
amount of sense.
... “Then, please to make me one, very handsome,” said.I.; “and send
it home to-night.” And I was going out of the warehouse.
“But, sir,” said M.R. MACDougal.I., “do you belong to any clan, or
what tartan will you have P” n
“MR. MacDoug ALL,” said I, “it may be that I do belong to a clan,
or am affiliated to one. It may be, that like Edward WAVERLEy,
I shall be known hereafter as the Friend of the Sons (and Daughters)
of the clan It may be that if war broke out between that clan
and another, I would shout our war-cry, and, drawing my claymore,
would walk into the hostile clan like one o'clock. But at present that
is a secret, and I wear not the garb of any clan in particular. Please
to make me up a costume out of the garbs of several clans, but be sure
you put the brightest colours, as they suit my complexion.”
I am bound to say that though, MR. MAcDoug ALL firmly declined
being party to this arrangement, which he said would be inartistic, he
did so with the utmost courtesy. My opinion is, that he thought I was
a little cracked. Many persons have thought that, but there is no
foundation for the suspicion.
“You see, MR. MacDoug ALL,” says I, “I am a Plantagenet by
descent, and one of my ancestors was hanged in the time of GEorge
THE Secon D. Do those facts suggest anything to you in the way of
costume P”
“The first does not,” he said, “but the second may, A good many
persons had the misfortune to be hanged about the time you ºnention,
and for the same reason. I suppose your ancestor died for the Stuarts.”
“No, Sir, he died for a steward. The unfortunate nobleman was
most iniquitously destroyed for shooting a plebeian of the name of
Johnson, for which reason I hate everybody of that name, from Ben
downwards, and will not have a Johnson's Dictionary in my house.”
“Then, Sir,” says MR. MACDoug ALL, “the case is clear. You can
mark your sense of the conduct of the sovereign who executed your

respected relative. You can assume the costume of his chief enemies.
You can wear the Stuart tartan.”
“Hm,” says I. “I should look well in it, no doubt; but then
Ihave no hostility to the present House of Brunswick.” -
. “Why,” says he, laughing; “Her Majesty dresses her own princes
in the Stuart tartan. I ought to know that.”
“Then that’s settled,” I replied.
Ha! You would indeed have been proud of your contributor, had
you seen him splendidly arrayed in that gorgeous garb, and treading
the heather of Inverness High Street like a young mountaineer. He

Interness Castle.
IRREVERENCE IN ITALY.
Everybody knows that the Art of Punch is strictly regulated by the
higher sentiments. But even if it were, not, Punch would venture at
his peril to publish a cartoon such as the caricature described in the
following extract from a letter in the Tablet from its correspondent at
Rome:-
“I think any one with a talent for profanity in any other country would be
astounded at the inventive powers displayed by the Unionist press in the kingdom
of Italy, and were 1 to point to one thing more than another calculated to spread
contempt for Christianity, it is these publications. I have one just published before
me. Garrealini with a nimbus, flowing robes, and a tricolor flag and cross labelled
* Roma olamorte" in hand, rises from the tomb, which is represented as a broken-
bombshell of Aspromonte, and the Minister Wisconti VENosta, with Napoleon
astride on his nose, and Francis-Joseph, dumb with terror, are struck down as the
two soldiers keeping watch. It has surrezit secundum Scripturas under it, and is a
patent and blasphemous parody of our Lord's Resurrection.”
Exactly so; and if any publication professing to supply a want which
Punch does not, were to appear with such an illustration as that above-
described, it would almost immediately disappear from circulation.
There would be no need to fine and imprison, still less to hang or burn
the proprietors, artists, editor, and writers, of a paper so illustrated.
Swimming, like pigs, against the stream, those unhappy buffoons would
assuredly do for themselves, as pigs, under the like circumstances, are
said to do. How is this where there is no Inder Erpurgatorius, no cen-
sorship, and no condemnation of a profane parody but that pronounced
society? The correspondent of the Tablet appeals to “our separated
brethren,” against the countenance given by them to the cause of Italian
unity, supported, as he represents it to be, by blasphemous caricatures.
On consideration he may discover himself to be mistaken in supposing
that, iſ there is “one thing mºre than another calculated to spread con-
tempt for Christianity, it is these publications.” Where such things
are popular, contempt for Christianity has been spread already; and
were Punch to point to one thing likely to have spread contempt for
Christianity, it would be the association of Christianity with winking
Madonnas and other cock-and-bull fables and superstitions. Were he to
point to another thing at least equally likely to bring Christianity into
contempt, it would be the complicity of º: who profess to repre-
sent Christianity with brigands and assassins. There is no other thing
Mr. Punch can think of, more than these two things, calculated to
spread that contempt for Christianity of which profane parodies are not
the cause but the effect.

And crying Bother the Sturgeon, it’s the Porpus I want to see,
And going away in a state of huff because there was only Me,
lº was pleasant (and kings has right divine to feela little malicious)
To see'em sent to behold his cops in the barrow behind the fish-house.
So when MR. BuckLAND next obtains a porpus as wants a surgeon,
Perhaps he won't insert that pig beside of a Royal Sturgeon.
I've heard the Tench is a curing fish and effects a perfect cure
Of other fish put into his pond, which he’s welcome to do, I’m sure,
But, don't bring sick porpuses up to me, I’m kinto the olds, a-Devil,
And though a king I’m not inclined to be touching fish for the evil.
Besides, a porpus isn't a fish, but a highly developed man,
Imprºved, of cºurse, with a tail and fins, on the famous Westiges plan,
The Phocºna Rondaletii, though his scent in this suitry weather
Was not like rondoletianor frangipanmineither,
But that is neither here northere, and as I previously said,
From ºuen of both my leart and pond I’m glad the Porpus is
ead.
Royal Zoological Gardens. THE STURGEon.
P.S. The REveREND SPURGEoN gives it out he’s related to me, a
mugger,
He’s no such thing, and much more like the Above Lamented, in
gger,
If one may judge by the fottergraffs, which his congregation treasures,
And where he shows himself enjoying no end of domestic pleasures.
A FACT IN ZOOLOGY.
It was observed by those, who always keep a close eye upon royalty,
that on each occasion the PRINCE or Wales has been to the Adelphi
Theatre, he has been moved to tears by the charm of Miss Batemas’s
most excellent acting. On this being mentioned to Paul Bedford,
he exclaimed, “Perfectly true to nature, my boy—what can you expect
from Wales but blubber.” For giving way to this irreverent tom-
foolery, MR. Paul Bedwoºd has since been compelled to study twenty
pages of Joe MILLER. We hope it will act as a caution to him in future,
A Drop of comfort.
The RE is just one consolation arising out of this new old New
Zealand War. If weabolish the New Zealanders, we shall abolish that
eternal fellow, of Lord MacAulay's creation, who, on an *f;
finishes three hundred and sixty-five leading articles every year. If
there is no New Zealander, he can't well come and sit on the broken
arch and sketch the ruined cathedral.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WIFE'S INDIGNATION.
(`)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
WELL, Sir, what
next if you please?
We are coming to
something, I should
think. Don’t tell
me. No wonder we
have Earthquakes.
did not see the
paper till yesterday,
for , of , course my
husband, who pre-
tends to be so accu-
rate in everything,
forgot to tell them
to send it down to
Worthing, but I
have just got home,
, and tired as I am
§ (and as you would
be if you had all
: the real trouble of
the journey, pack-
ing, minding, the
children, and all that
left to ..". I shall
not go to bed until
I have slightly ex-
pressed my indigna-
tion. In the Saturday Review, of course. In what other paper could
it be except in that paper, which ought to be called Woman's Enemy.
Read this, Mr. Punch. I shall cut it out for you, in, spite of a
certain person's black looks at my spoiling his File as he calls it. That
File may bite against a Viper, if it likes; but it shan’t bite me without
being told of it. , My husband says, of course, that I have put the
F. wrong, when does a wife, do anything right? But you will
now what I mean. The article is called “The Companions of our
Pleasures”—a mice sort of title that, too:—
“A wife is in most cases a sure friend, because, among other reasons, “use doth
breed a habit;' but she is not always wise, although a husband scarcely likes to
catch himself despising her opinions or silently scouting her counsels. After all, it
is only a small and lucky minority who find in their wives anything at all resembling
the ideal of friendship. Of course, tenderness and love are very excellent things;
but many husbands would be delighted if the wives of their bosoms were rather
more like old college friends than they are, and if their tenderness were solidified by
rather more judgment.”
... : SS
º->
--
º *NS,
-- * - Nº
Now, Mr. Punch, is that the sort of writing to be endured by a wife
sitting at her own table? We are not wise. Of course not. You are
the Solomons, everybody knows that, and you never go wrong. You
never take houses that are out of repair; you never tie yourselves
up with ridiculous leases; you never pay taxes twice over because
you have not preserved receipts; you never hire servants, with forged
characters; you never put your names to friends’ bills and have
to pay them with money that ought to go to your children; you
never send boys to school because you were pleased with a sentimental
advertisement, and find they are starved and º: and taught
nothing; you never travel first class when second would be just as com-
fortable and save a third of the money; you never—O, of course you
never do anything unwise, Solomons that you are. -
You want your wives to be like your old college friends! . Well, I
am sure. CHARLEs brings an old college friend home with him now
and then, and I can only say that if I thought he wished me to be like that,
I would take the children to lodgings in Bloomsbury Square or some
other poor neighbourhood, and little would we trouble my lord and
master again. Wish me to tell ridiculous stories about proctors and
dons, and introduce bits of Latin which l believe had better not be put
into English ; wish me to sit up till three in the morning, smoking pipes
and drinking grog, and covering the new table-cloth with tobacco-ash,
and making the curtains smell to that degree that I am ashamed to look
at the servant when she comes in at breakfast! Wish me to ask him
to come out after dinner, and go to music saloons, and supper-houses,
and; I don’t know where, and come home with brightened eyes but
drooping eye-lids, and not able, to speak for laughing about, some
“chaff” with a policeman. Old college companions, indeed, brazen
noses and brazen faces, I should like to see myself cultivating such
manners to please the best man that ever kicked slippers into a corner
in the dark, and then used bad language because he could not find 'em
where he thought he had put 'em. No, Mr. Punch, marriage has its
duties as well as its rites.
But that is not all, by any means:—
“We know it is a scandalous heresy, and partakes of the nature of brutishness, or
even sacrilege, thus to insinuate a base suspicion that supreme felicity sometimes
ceases to bless the British hearth, or that the angelin the house is sometimes a bore."
"A Bore.” A man's own lawful wiſe is sometimes a Bore. As I
said, no wonder we have Earthquakes. Fancy a bride, standing before
the altar, all smile and tremor, and hearing a man swear to love and
honour and cherish, and so on, and being told that the man there, who
can hardly speak for his happiness and his pride, would tell here some
day that she is a bore | Hadn't you better have the service altered,
and after “ I will”, say in the margin, “Here the husband shall add
the words ‘till she bores me.’” Butlet me go on, or I shall write till
to-morrow :-
“It will, at all events, be conceded that a man's wife is not the most desirable
companion he could have at all times and under every circumstance. Nobody wants
to have his wife with him in his chambers or at his counting-house. Yet a man is
always thought a basely selfish wretch, at least by the female friends of his wife, if
he entertains any thought of enjoying himself out of her society. She readily and
properly leaves him to make money after his own fashion, but in the spending of it
she would fain be supreme; and, at any rate, that it should be spent without her
companionship is utterly intolerable. In the main, and in favourable cases, a wife
is a sufficiently agreeable companion of her lord's leisure hours, provided she has
sense enough to throw the children's boots, and coughs, and teeth off her mind.”
There, Mr. Punch. And we send missionaries to the Chinese and
the Jews. Here is one of the intellectual papers of the day actually
complaining that a wife wishes to share her husband's enjoyments, and
that she talks to him about the nursery. I should just like to hear
CHARLEY show that he thought me a “bore” when I spoke to him
about JIMMY's boots, and ANGELINA’s cough, and Louis A's teeth.
Little more he’d hear from me on those subjects or any other. And
what else does the reviewing gentleman want me to talk about. Steam-
engines, or social sciences, or politics, or DR. ColeNso Nice conver-
sation that between husband and wife with their toes on the fender,
and I don’t believe the man that wrote such things was ever married,
or he’d be ashamed of himself. Earning the money, indeed! What
did a man marry for, if he was going to think himself a martyr because
he worked a little to maintain his wife and children. Nobody asked
him to marry, did they I know that if CHARLEs had waited till I
asked him, or anybody else either, I'should be a single girl at this
moment, “Sufficiently agreeable.” Dear me. How condescending.
Does anybody ask whether he is sufficiently agreeable to me, or whether
he has sense enough to throw his clients, and his briefs, and his consul-
tations off his mind, and tell me news, and about the new novels, and
the theatres, and the PRINcess of WALEs, and whether we are to wear
our hair like whiskers, as the Follet says, and I sham't, whether it’s the
EMPREss's will or not.
“In nine cases out of ten, it is a dire mistakes to throw, a husband, and wife
together for a month or six weeks, with nothing to do beyond trying to enjoy them:
selves, and without abundance of other companionship. The most sensible plan, no
doubt, where it is practicable, is that at least two pairs should unite to form one
society for travelling purposes. . . . It is pleasanter to have three or five mice
people to talk to over dinner than one, even though that one be your own wife.”
There! I shall quote no more, because I am really very tired, and
MR. CHARLEs, having had his cigar and other refreshments, is yawning
in the most selfish manner. I simply ask you whether it is not un-
bearable to be told that a man cannot live with one for a month, by the
Sea-side, without being “bored,” and wanting three other “nice
people” to talk to. Nice people, indeed. Nice, literature that puts
such things into husbands’ heads! I i. they will be going to
this new Judge, MR. JIMMY WILDE my husband calls him (is that his
right name P), and asking for divorces because we are not “sufficiently
agreeable,” and because we complain of the shoe-bill, and are uneasy
about a child's lower teeth. Upon my word, but if these are the good
times that were coming, give me the bad ones, when a wife meant what
MR. WoRDsworth said so beautifully, and what I believe most of us are,
“A perfect woman, nobly planned
To guide, to comfort, to command.”
Having thus said a few words, in the way of protest against such
wickedness, tired as I am, I will only say that I hope you will insert it,
and I am, dear iſ. Punch,
- Yours sincerely,
South Kensington. A BORE.
P.S.. I shall have something to say about “Frisky Matrons” one of
these days, but I suspect that on that occasion I shall not be talking to
a male Saturday Reviewer.
True Heroism.
ONE of Mr. Punch's surgical friends is partial to phlebotomy. , Mr.
Punch submitted, one day, to the quackish operation, for the sake of
making a joke. , Said the doctor,..". This is the true remedy, after, all.”
Said Mr. Punch to Mrs, Punch, “Why is that quack like the Flower
of Love? Because he Lies, Bleeding.”

appetite as sharp as a saw.

How, when, AND WHEREP
OR, TBE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
HERE are we now * Just
about to start from Zurich
to Interlachen. The Tourist
can, if sufficiently strong,
take the Rigi on the road.
He mustn't take it very far,
or it will be missed; as it
Mount has been mist more

been entirely lost.
You intend to make the
ascent from the Goldau
side. Now, the question is,
how do you get there? Take
the first turning to the right
on leaving Zurich, the
second to the left, and then
any one will tell you; if they
won't, implore the sulky
Fº to reply, and offer
im a sou; or you will sou
in vain.
Guides.—Always take a
guide with you. One who
knows the way is to be pre-
ferred. .
The best guides, who move in the very highest society, know all the
principal mountains to speak to, and invariably obtain very civil answers
from the most distant echoes. They also address themselves to their
journey in a manner that makes the journey answer. They are
very straightforward and honest on the road; at all events, 'whatever
wrong they do, during the excursion, is kept secret, as the steeps and
heights never seem to tell upon them.
If you go without a guide choose the safest path.
Amusements in the Mountains.—If you want money, and can draw,
now is your time to turn the art to account: thus, make friends with a
Foreign Banker, take him up into a lonely spot, then, when nobody's
looking, take out your snicker-snee, and draw upon him for any
amount.
Never be unprovided with pencils, brushes, and paints; if you can
execute light rapid sketches, you can do what our travelling artist did,
and turn your tour into a carica-tour.
Maps.-Never travel in Switzerland without a Map; never mind
what map, any one you’ve got by you will do. Don't forget a Knap-
sack to serve, as the name implies, for a sac de nuit to sleep in.
Carry a flask made on the principle of HQUDIN's inexhaustible bottle.

PROFUSELY LIBERAL PRINCIPLES.
The following is an extract from a paragraph in a contemporary
touching the representation of Oxford:—
“The last rumour is that M. C. NEATE, who was returned for Oxford in 1857, but
was unseated for bribery and corruption, will he brought forward by the extra
Liberal party, in which case MR FLETCHER, of the Reform Club, who meant to
contest the seat on the same principles, has pledged himself to withdraw.”
Are we to suppose that a member of the Reform Club meant to
contest the representation of Oxford on the principles of bribery and
corruption?

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
PUGILISM is sinking lower than ever. Aristocratic. Backers only
employing their patronage by backing out of all fistic encounters.
Even Bell threatens to give up its Ring, and the Professors of self-
defence will not find much vitality remaining in their body, when The
Life has once left their noble art. Without money the fighting men
will soon find their occupation gone. It is of little use to be rough
unless you have plenty of ready.
Who are the Feenians or Finnians?', The former would in England
be a law term for lawyers in general, while the Finnians or Finny’uns
would serve to distinguish as fishy ones the black sheep of the pro-
fession in particular.
KING GeoRGE AGAMEMNoN proposes to change the name of the
Ionian Islands into the I.O.U.nion Islands. All His Majesty's orders
are signed by GeoRGE, but there is no truth in the report that the
Prime Minister’s name is By Jingo.
The prison system is to be greatly improved. The following defi-
nitions and rules have been sent in to the Home Secretary by eminent ||
prison-discipline authorities. The definition of
Solitary Confinement is, not more than three in a room.
Silent System.—All may not talk at once.
Hard Labour.—A walk round the grounds from twelve to four.
Stringent Rules–Convicts are requested not to pluck the flowers.
Prison Diet.—Venison is not allowed more than six times during the
season. N. B. Whenever the Governor or any of the prison officials be
presented with game, he shall share it with the first-class convicts.
Regulation as to Dinner.—Nobody shall ask for more than three
helpings of turtle soup. -
Instruction.—Cigars and liqueurs shall be wº for the convicts
during their conversations with the Chaplain. The Chaplain shall in no
case refer to their past lives, lest it might wound their susceptibilities.
The mention of prisons reminds us that an evil-doer has been rescued
from the error of his way by seeing the Ticket of Leave Man at the
Olympic. The good effected has not stopped here: during the long
run of this capital piece several dramatic authors have visited the
house, and have subsequently written to MR., EMDEN informing him
that they will never again take anything from the French.
Unable to get away from hard labour and treadmills, even though
we have plunged into theatrical matters, we may say that while the
fortunate convict is getting on well at the Olympic, the successful
Irion is still likely to be kept on for a good long time at his wheel in
the New Royalty.
Thetheatrical worldisfulioſ great successes. QueenLeah reigns supreme
at the Adelphi, and Miriam, as a gentleman with a “cold in his 'ed"
informed us, is equal to a myriad in the auditorium (iſ it would hold
'em) of the Strand. Then, there’s a conjuror who makes money and
time pass in a wonderfully quick way at the Princess's. The St.
James's Theatre is to let. But everybody seems to think that it does
very well as it is, and that therefore they’d better act upon the moral
suggested by the piece played at this house last season (Lady Audley’s
Secret), and let well alone.
MR. BALFE's new Opera now in rehearsal at Covent Garden is not
founded on MARTIN TUPPER's. Proverbial Philosophy.
MR. CHARLEs MAthews should have re-appeared in London in a
new Piece, entitled the Judgment of Paris, but his habitual modesty
º him from so doing. However, MRs. MATHEws and her
usband are coming out very shortly in a Comedy, by a well-known
hand, we mustn't say whose, which has a capital title, we mustn't say
what, and we can’t add any more, but we mustn't say why.
Here’s a nice little bit of penny-a-lining:—
“His Royal Highness the PRINCE of WALEs and his Royal relatives have com-
menced the shooting season immediately on their arrival at the Prince's shooting-
box, their Rºyal Highnesses the PRINCE or WALEs, the PRINCE CHRistiAN, and
PRINCE FREDERick, with several gentlemen of their respective suites, having begun
to use the deadly tube this morning with telling effects. The weather has been
charmingly fine, and strongly in contrast to that of yesterday. Their Royal High-
nesses found plenty of game, and entered into the sport with real enjoyment. Their
Royal Highnesses shot over the estate nearest the Hall.”
The deadly tube | Our great guns, according to this report, couldn’t
shoot with any commonplace weapons. Telling effects' Good joke
this; play on the name “TELL,” who was a remarkably good shot in
his way. Ha! hal, ha!, Capital. See how yesterday is "...";
for its weather. Their Royal Highnesses found the game. Very kind
of their Royal Highnesses, specially as it was for the benefit of the
Correspondent. Real enjoyment! Delightful scene, peculiarly English
Was the writer present P behind a tree getting out of the way of the
telling effects.
We suspect that our pennywise friend was up a “hollow beech tree”
in the neighbourhood, and it required some extra fine writing before
he could “come down,” and defray the score at the Woodpecker's
Tap in the Woods, where “the smoke so gracefully curl’d” Irom his
briar-root pipe, and obfuscated him.
THE FEENIAN FAUGH-A-BALLAGH.
IT’s down wid the Orange and up wid the Green,
From across the Atlantic, to Erin's fair shore,
Since that banner waved proudly in RYAN’s boreen,
'Gainst the Saxon it never has come to the fore: , ,.
When bould SMITH O'BRIEN, in the cabbage formed line,
Saxon hirelings the flag of the Feenian fleered at:
But let us once put in ould Ireland a fut, -
And we’ll ate up John BULL, wid the cabbage he jeered at.
Up, Feenian Brotherhood—up like one man,
And pay down your money, nor ask a receipt:
Sons of Great FIN MAG Cool, be as cool as you can,
Wid revenge on the Saxon your tim to heat:
Wid the States at our back, and the clargy at home,
Sure our flag will soon wave upon Liffey's fair quay,
And as moighty St. Pathrick druv snakes o'er the foam, *
So the base bloody Saxon we’ll drive over say!
Then the Feenian Brotherhood all in their moight,
On the ould hill of Tara a council will hold, .
Wid green robes on their backs, a most iligant soight,
And all wearin' Malachi's collars o' gold: . .
And we’ll bring back the fine ould Milesian toimes,
And the seven wise masthers instal in our schools;
And we’ll find out descindants of BRIAN BOROIHME's,
To sway the green isle that the Saxon misrules!
And we’ll have back the glib and the saffron-dyed robe.
That was worn by the chieftains who warred 'gin the Pale,
And we’ll send Irish Letthers and Arts o'er the globe,
And for PATHRick and PIRAN, crown DocTHoR MAC HALE. ,
And we’ll put down the Peelers, and mane Saxon laws,
That keep up distinction 'twixt meum and tume,
And we’ll wait till the Feenian Republic o'erawes
The Kingdom of England and reigns in its room.
We’ll restore the ould families, every man Jack,-
To the acres, tuk from them by Protestant hand;
And we’ll have our Milesian Capital back,
When the base Saxon Capital's druv from the land!
The sthrames will run butter-milk, bogs dry outright,
Potheen won't upset the Milesian brain,
Irish pathriots won’t job, Irish factions won't fight,
And the Phoenix will build in her own Park again!
A RESPECTABLE ACT OF FAITH.
It is reported, says a contemporary, that the Spanish Government
intends “ attempting to consolidate the whole of the heterogeneous
debt of the country.” We hope this means that QUEEN ISABELLA’s
Ministers are going to create Consols for the purpose of paying the
foreign creditors of Spain the interest of their money. This step will
become the advisers of a Sovereign who affects the title of Catholic.
They will very much improve upon it by paying up the arrears of divi-
dend due to those long-suffering persons who have trusted their nation.
One entirely laudable dogma ..º.º. is, that which enjoins

THE Many go absurdly wrong
In common with their kind;
Not few in self-conceit are strong ".
As they are weak of mind;
Thus, for example, to produce
A case of either class,
There’s ToMKINs a gregarious goose:

MR. CHARLEs MATHEws still persists in maintaining that he is the
author of the original farce, on which L'Anglais Timide is founded,
which he knows as well as we do that he is not. In only one respect
can he make good his title, and that is in the boldness of the assertion,
which certainly is As Cool as a Cucumber. However, coolness on the
part of our friend CHARLEs is decidedly misplaced under the head of
Variétés, yiel is the name of the theatre where the felonious act was
Committed.

BRITISHER TO BEECHER.
ALAs what a pity it is, PARson BEECHER,
That you came not at once when Secession broke out,
As ABRAHAM lincoLN's Apostle, a preacher
Of the Union; a gospel which Englishmen doubt;
For that Union, you see,
Was a limb of our tree:
Its own branches to break themselves off are as free.
Still, BEECHER, if you had been only sent hither,
When at first the Palmetto flag flouted the sky,
Commissioned foul slavery's faction to wither,
And this nation invoke to be Freedom's ally,
With your eloquent art
You had won England's heart;
We were fully disposed towards taking your part.
Instead of a Reverend BEECHER, appealing -
To our conscience, in Liberty's name, for the right,
We heard a cool scoundrel advise in the stealing
Of BRITANNIA's domains, North and South to unite;
And your papers were full
Qf abuse of John BULL; , .
Whilst he bore the blockade which withheld cotton wool.
Malevolence, taking our ill-will for granted,
Has reviled us, pursued us with bluster and threat,
Supposing itself the remembrance had planted
our bosom of wrongs which we couldn't forget,
And should take, in its case
Of misfortune, as base -
A revenge as itself would have ta'en in our place.
Tirades against England, with menace of slaughter,
Never yet have your SöMNERs, and such, ceased to pour,
Your bards talk of blowing us out of the water,
And threaten to “punish JoHN BULL at his door.”
Now this isn't the way
To make Englishmen pray
That the Yankees may finish by gaining the day.
An afterthought only is “Justice to Niggers;”
'Tis a cry which those Yankees raised not till they found
That they for a ; time had been pulling triggers,
At their slaveholding brothers, and gained little ground.
First ABE LINCOLN gave out
That he’d fain bring about,
The Re-union with slavery too, or without.
So don’t waste your words in attempts at persuasion,
Which impose on no Briton alive . a fool,
But husband your breath for another occasion,
That is, BeechER, keep it your porridge to cool.
“Strictly neutral will I
Still remain standing by,”
Says BRITANNIA: “d'ye see any green in my eye?”
Obtaining Laughter under False Pretences.
TheRE are certain dislocations of words, which sound like jokes, but
which, upon examination, have but small pretensions to the honourable
character of a joke. Of this particular dubious class, perhaps, the
following may be cited as one of the best:-A gentleman was relating
that on the evening he was present at the Adelphi to witness the
affecting drama of Leah, a lady, at the conclusion of the fifth act, had
been carried out in violent hysterics. "Well?” said a notorious old
offender, “there’s nothing very wonderful in that—isn't the scene laid
in hi-Styria?”

THE MERSEY RAMS.
As I stood by the Mersey,
Upon a certain day,
I saw a couple of Rams there
That never were fed upon hay.
The number of their dimensions
I can’t exactly tell,
But I guess their length was over
Thrice ten yards and an ell.
Upon my word 'tis true, Sir,
And what'll you lay it’s a lie?
And if you’ll go to Birkenhead,
You’ll see it as well as L.
The wool on their sides is iron,
The horns on their heads are steel:
Their trotters were under water,
Like the mail-clad Warrior's keel.
Their tails that grew on their haunches
Were hidden from my view,
Those tails are their prºpellers;
And each is an Iron Screw.
Upon my word, &c.
These Rams are in Mersey water
As true as I sit here;
The one of them called El Toussoon,
The other, El Monastir;
Which Oriental titles
Are known to be mere shams;
The SULTAN never ordered
This pair of Mersey Rams.
Upon my word, &c.
From straying out of the Mersey,
Those iron Rams to bar,
They closely are attended,
By a British man-of-war;
For the peace of England's nation,
Thus Government has cared;
But their laudable precaution,
Is a bore for MEssieurs LAIRD.
Upon my word, &c.
SMOKING ROOMS ON WHEELS WANTED.
LIKE many other great philosophers, Mr. Punch is fond of smoking,
and daily takes his tobacco as unctually as his dinner. But great as
is his sympathy with reasonable smokers, all those who smoke unrea.
sonably he holds in great contempt, and will ever do his possible to help
to put their pipes out. A gentleman who smokes where he may annoy
another gentleman, or, still worse, where it is possible he may offend a
lady, Mr. Punch thinks is no gentleman but a selfish, snobbish gent.
For this reason Mr. Punch condemns the practice of smoking in a rail-
way carriage, but he still more censures the mean policy of short-sighted
directors who appear to stint the public in supply of smoking carriages
that they may make a goodly income by the fines they hope to pouch.
The ladies, who are specially the pets of Mr. Punch, make continual
complaints to him about this growing nuisance, and explain how dis-
agreeable it is to them when going to a flower show or concert, to have
to travel in a carriage that reeks with stale tobacco smoke, and makes
their dresses smell as though they had been hung up in a pot house.
With an apology for quoting Latin before ladies, Mr. Punch may just
observe that a cask is not the only thing which–
“Quo semelest imbutadiu servabit odorem.”
Just try smoking in a railway carriage where there are stuffed cushions,
and you will find that you may open the windows as wide as you will,
but the smell of tobacco will linger there still. To the female nose this
odour is in general a nuisance, and, much as Mr. Punch likes smoking,
he must consider that the man, who ever smokes where he may annoy a
lady, is a snob whom it were flattery to call a selfish beast.
Nevertheless smoking is to some of us well nigh as necessary as
eaſing, and as this is a free country, we ought not to be deprived of it.
Were the matter rightly put to them, even ladies who hate smoke would
!. agree that smoking in a º carriage should in some way
e permitted; for the more a son or husband smokes when he is out,
the less will he be likely to want his smoke at home. Mr. Punch feels
sure then that the ladies will all join in his petition for having enough
smoking rooms on wheels in every train to accommodate himself and
WOL. XLV. U
other smokers who may travel...Were this done, Mr. Punch would use
his strongest influence to prohibit and prevent illicit smoking upon rail-
ways, and to brand and gibbet all who wilſully commit it. The ladies
have the remedy in their own fair hands, and the more they are annoyed
the sooner they will use it. When their patience is exhausted let them
come to Mr. Punch, and join him in presenting a petition for redress.
A deputation of nice girls, if led by Mr. Punch, would no doubt find
ready access to every railway board-room; and if petitions for more
smoking carriages were thus properly presented, surely few directors
would be able to withstand them.
ADIEU TO MR. BEECHER.
MR. BEECHER has left us; he has sailed for America, where he can
tell his congregation just what he likes, but where he will, we are sure,
tell Messes. Lincols and SEWARD the exact truth, namely that large
numbers of the uneducated classes crowded to hear a celebrated orator,
and that the press has been very good-natured to him. Also, we hope
he will say, because he knows it, that the educated classes are at the
present date just as Neutral in the matter of the American quarrel as
they were before the reverend gentleman's arrival. Having duly stated
these facts to the PResident and the Minister, MR. BEECHER may
put them in any form he pleases before the delightful congregation,
whose members pay £40 a-year, each, for pews. And to show that we
part with him in all good nature, we immortalise his witty allusion to
ourselves in his farewell speech:—
“I know my friend Punch thinks I have been serving out ‘soothing syrup" to
the British Lion (Laughter.) Wery properly the picture represents me as putting a
spoon into the lion's ear instead of his mouth; and I don't wonder, that ...the great
brute turns away very sternly from that plan of feeding.” (Renzwed laughter.)
A gentler criticism upon us could not be, and we scorn to retort that,
having a respect for anatomy, we did not make the lion's ear large
enough to hold the other spoon depicted in that magnificent engraving.
For the Revekend BeechER is not a spoon, whatever we may think of
his audiences in England. And so we wish him good-bye, and plenty of
green-backs and green believers.

THE EXTREME OF COSSACK -
BARBARISM.
FANcy the thrill of horror which must have
pervaded servants', halls when the subjoined
extract from the letter of the Times special
correspondent at Warsaw, was read aloud by
young BUTTONs to MR. John THOMAs :-
“A groom who was exercising his master's horse near
one of the barriers was mistaken the other day by the
Cossacks for an insurgent, and knocked out of his
saddle and beaten before he could explain who and
what he was. Probably the Cossacks imagined his livery
to have been an uniform, for I remember a massacre of
house and farm servants which took place some months
ago on an estate in the Government of Lublin, in which
a gaudily dressed footman was reserved for special tortures
on the supposition that he must be the band-master.”
Exclusively domestic as are the feelings of
John THOMAs, even JoHN Thomas himself must
feel inflamed with indignation against the Rus-
sian barbarism which is regardless even of the
immunities of Plush. The idea that a gaudily
dressed footman, innocent even of impatience of
constitutional taxation, to which he is a stranger,
should be reserved by Cossacks for special tor-
tures on account of that garb which denotes his
superiority to all politics, cannot but disgust the
most indifferent John Thomas with such barba-
rians, and cause him to bless himself for the
livery which is exempt from the shoulder-knout.

ALLEGED BLACK MAIL AT NEWINGTON.
A SUPERIOR Dramatist has observed that even “the common execu-
tioner, whose heart the accustomed sight of death makes hard, falls not
the axe upon the humbled neck, but first begs pardon.” MR:CALCRAFT
makes, a point of shaking hands with the subjects on whom he is
operating, and he also perhaps at the same time apologises for the inconve-
nience to which he is going to put them by checking their respiration.
The taxgatherer is supposed to execute an office almost as odious as
the hangman's with at least as much gentleness and civility as JACK
KETCH exhibits in the performance of his unpopular duty. If, however,
reliance can be placed on the subjoined particulars, the tax-collector
M'CAUL's showing to amount to a graver charge than that of mere
brutality; namely that of exceeding his duty in collecting the Queen's
taxes by levying Élºi on his own account. But this is an accusa-
tion which cannot be believed without evidence, and, to be sustained
by such evidence as the ensuing, of course requires that evidence to be
confirmed by oath:—
“MR. Woodward said that "MR. WRIGHT had called upon him for taxes, and
demanded a shilling for his trouble, and would not give a receipt without it.
“Mr. BARKER, 113, Dover Road, said that MR. Wright called on him for taxes,
and he went up to MR. WRIGHT's office with the money. There were six or eight
females there on a similar errand. Mr. WRIGHT asked each of them for 2s. expenses.
They pleaded hard to be let off, but they had to pay. He asked him (MR. º
for 2s., but when it was refused he would not take the money, but said he woul
levy. He (MR. BARKER) then called in a friend and said, ‘Be you witness that I
does not always emulate the urbanity of the Finisher of the Law. We
quote the report on which this remark is ſounded:–
“THE RATEPAYERS OF NEWINGTON AND THE COLLECTION OF TAXES.
“ExTRAordinaRY PUBLIC MEETING.
“Last night a Public Meeting of the ratepayers of the Parish of St. Mary's, New"
ington, was convened at the Roebuck Tavern, Dover Road, to take into consideration
the alleged harsh, ungentlemanly, and overbearing conduct of the Arrears Collector
of the district. MR. Dowle was called to the Chair.”
tender the amount of the assessed taxes." MR. WRIGHT replied, ‘I will take it from
you; but it is such men as you that make devils of men like us." (Laughter.)"
In the narrative of MR. BARKER six or eight females are represented
as having been addressed by MR, WRIGHT with a demand that amounts
to little, if anything less, than “Stand and Deliver !” and MR. BARKER
represents himself as having successfully resisted the proposal of an
alternative not essentially different from “Your Money or your Life!”
“Give me two shillings or I shall levy,” comes nearly to the same
thing. It must, however, be remembered that MR, BARRER was not
in a witness-box; and therefore MR. WRIGHT must, for the present,
be presumed to be innocent of the attempt, and the acts imputed to
him. . At a mere meeting of ratepayers that gentleman was not
upon his trial. However:-
“Several other Speakers having mentioned similar case
“MR. M'CAUI, moved a resolution, “That this º, having heard with indig-
nation, the method in which MR. WRIGHT conducts the business of the collection
of the taxes, appoints a Committee to wait on the board of guardians, to explain to
them the nature of the complaints against MR. WRIGHT, and to request that the
elected Collector be directed to discontinue his services.’”
Under MR. M'CAUL's favour, his resolution did not go far enough.
Surely the law has a name and a requital for obtaining money by the
means which he imputes to MR. WRIGHT. Innocence of such extortion
does not merit the sack, and guilt deserves something very much
worse. If there are grounds to justify the resolution demanding
the discontinuance of MR. WRIGHT's services, there are grounds for
The Chairman explained to the meeting that the person whose con-
duct they were assembled to investigate, was one ALEXANDER WRIGHT,
a sub-collector, employed by the elected and recognised collector for the
district. MR. Dowle added that this WRIGHT had been only that day
bound over by M.R. ELLIOTT to keep the peace for six months, “in
consequence of the manner in which he had treated a respectable
tradesman.” The following statement was then made in illustration of
MR. WRIGHT’s demeanour in taxgathering after a fashion the reverse
of suariter in modo:-
“MR. A. W. M'CAUL said that on the 31st of August MR. WRIGHT called at his
house in the evening, and asked for the Queen's taxes. Mrs. M'CAUL said that
they should be paid on the next morning. MR. Whight said, ‘You must pay this
moment,’ and was most overbearing. MRs. M'CAUL remonstrated, upon which he
said, in the rudest manner, “I don't want to speak to a thing like you,” and called
in a man that was behind him."
“The money, was paid,” said the speaker, but the violence of the
fºught ” a serious illness on MRs. M'CAUL. He proceeded to
say that :-
“He (MR. M'CAUL) subsequently went to WRIGHT, and demanded by what au-
thority he had made a disturbance in his house and done such mischief, and WRiohr

legal investigation.

that charge was not legal. The speaker proceeded to mention cases where he alleged “The Resolution having been seconded,

“Mr. SNELL, a vestryman, moved an amendment that the meeting should riot .
interfere between MR. M'CAU1, and WRIGHT. (oh, oh!) All Collectors erraploy
brokers to frighten men out of their money. (Oh!)”
The allegations against Mr. sub-taxgatherer WRIGHT appearby MRs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Oh 1” indeed. It is needless to say, that “after great confusion,”
which always attends a ratepayers’ meeting, “the resolution” was
unanimously carried, and the meeting separated.
As aforesaid, we presume MR. WRIGHT's innocence; but, were the
contrary established, we should say that it only exemplified the
working of a system of taxation which assesses temporary earnings
at as high a rate as permanent revenue. If the system of taxation is
one of robbery, what else can be expected of the instruments who
enforce it?
GOOD WORDS IN THEIR WAY AT MANCHESTER,
HERE is an excellent periodical
called Good Words. On the
occasion of the public break-
fast at the Albion Hotel,
when the Rev. M.R. BeechER
took leave of his friends at
Manchester, a speech was
made by a gentleman of
Liverpool, MR. J. PATTIsøN,
containing, as reported, a ſew
words which might be in-
serted, for contrast's sake, in
that well conducted miscel-
lany.
Subjoined are a few of the
words in question, ascribed
to MR. PATTIson. They
relate to LoRD BROUGHAM :-
“When he remembered what he
said when he was simply HENRY
Brough AM, he could not help con-
trasting it with his present conduct.
What were then the utterances of
one of the brightest sons of morn-
ing, and his words would live for
ever; but now his utterances—
since he had become a Lord—were
base and truculent upon this great
question. (Loud applause.)"
MR. PATTIsoN, according to the report just quoted, is, as aforesaid,
a Liverpool gentleman, but he does not talk Lancashire. The descrip-
tion of LoRD BRough AM as having, when he was simply HENRY
BROUGHAM, been one of the brightest sons of the morning, is an
example of rhetoric much too florid, and hardly perspicuous enough,
for the mouth of an honest North countryman. Nor would a true
Liverpool man have said that the “utterances” of BROUGHAM–
“since he had become a Lord,”—were “base and truculent” on the
question of anti-slavery, to which MR. PATTIsoN was referring, unless
he had some proof of the applicability of those adjectives to lord
BRough AM's utterances, more demonstrative than that which follows
in the continuation of MR. PATTIson’s address; to wit:-
“—and in proof of his assertion he read an extract from a speech recently de-
livered by Lord BRough AM at a banquet in Edinburgh, in which he spoke of himself
as the only one who had fought the battle of the abolitionists in England, and that
the proclamation of MR. LINcolN was a disgrace to a civilised Government, inasmuch
as it was issued with the view of inducing the slaves to rise in rebellion against
their owners, and that they would have done so but for their contentedness with
their condition and their masters. Now, when Lord Brough AM stood forth and
said that, he stood up like a bully and lied, for he knew that the proclamation was
issued not with that view, but with the view of bringing back into the Union the
rebellious states; and that, if they refused to accept the conditions therein set forth,
their property in the slaves would be confiscated.”
The truculence of LoRD BROUGHAM's by no means singular suppo-
sition that MR. LIN colN’s proclamation was issued for a truculent
purpose must be pointed out to be perceived. The baseness of his
assertion, that he alone had fought the battle of the abolitionists in
England, would, to be sure, be self-evident if he had ever said any such
thing, instead of having, often enough, feelingly commemorated his old
companions in arms, sharers in the glory of emancipation. A native of
Liverpool would be much more precise than MR. PATTIson in the
employment of such words as “base” and “truculent,” though good
words in their way, namely when applied to people who rave under the
influence of ignoble malice.
Neither would any Liverpool man, at least any Liverpool gentleman,
have said that LoRD BROUGHAM, when he expressed an opinion, right
or wrong, “stood up like a bully and lied.” For he would have con-
sidered such language to be not exactly suitable to a personage of
LoRD BRough AM's antecedents and age, and may think that if there is
any conduct which deserves to be described as standing up and lying, it
;3. of standing up and belching virulent abuse against a venerable
Old man.
In short, the eloquence attributed to MR. PATTIsoN is not English.
Neither is it Scotch. Shall we insult a noble people by calling it
Irish : We will not, by any means: but from some experience of the
howlings of a certain tribe of Irishmen, allied to those who constitute
the “Fenian Brotherhood,” we will venture to say that it is, if not an
example, at least a close imitation, of the utterances of the sort of Irish-
man that is synonymous with LUNDY Foot's renowned snuff.
QUOTATIONS.
As we have found, since writing our last article upon this subject,
that there are several lines familiar to most of us which were not
written by SHAKspeaRE, we hasten to place our information before the
Public, and more especially do we desire to call the attention of
Members of Parliament, Ready Writers, After Dinner Speakers, Bril-
liant Conversationalists, and Burlesque Writers, to the selections from
the Poets, which we are now about to give.
When discoursing at the Town Hall, Spinnerton, on the Beauties of
the Poets, you can mention SHAKSPEARE thus:—"ShakspeaRE, con-
cerning whom DRYDEN has said
“Fancy SHAkspeaRE driven wild
By the woodnotes of a child.”
On the Horrors of Domestic Felicity—
“Birds in their little nests agree;
But 'tis a dreadful sight !”—WArts.
“You remember,” this comes in your speech on the Delights, of
Home. “How touchingly the wife of Roderick, in Scott's charming
poem asks, at what hour her Lord will return, when she says to the
steward, whose name was JAckson—
“And JAckson, when is Rodritick due 2"
Isn't this homely f isn’t this Nature?”
The Merriment of Intoxication—
“There was a laughing Devil in his Beer.”—The Corsair.
BURNs has admirably expressed the Greed of Gain and the Pro-
digality of the Spendthrift in that well-known verse—
“If there's a hole for a your goats,
I redeye tent 'em,
A chiel's amang ye taking notes,
An faith he's spent 'em.”
On the questionable good of putting your name to paper, the same
É. has aptly said, when speaking of one LANG, a character in his
Oein-
“Should Auld LANG sign?”
A problem which is ultimately solved by a negative.
The Delights of the Country—
“On the Grampian hills
My father feeds a fox,
And frugal swan.”
For any Theatrical speech made in reference to The Haunted Man,—
“Welcome the coming, speed the parting Ghost!"
Finally, to recur to SHAKSPEARE, you may always be ready with
the following lines, adapted to any conversation, by the genius who
was for all time,
“The Poet's eye, on a fine Wednesday rolling,
Doth glance from HEcuBA to him, and he to Hecuba.
Yet in the very witching time of night, his pen,
What it has done, when 'tis done, 'tis done well,
Turns all to juggling fiends, while the brief caudle
Throws physic to the dogs.”
Beparticular,in delivering the above,tomark the punctuation carefully,
and use your arms with discretion, for the sake of grace and emphasis.
Has not SHAKSPEARE, in this instance, himself said of such action,-
“He saw the air with his hands.”
Any other less imaginative writer would have used the common-place
of eyes for “hands,” and would have probably omitted such a phrase as
“saw the air” on the ground of its being a physical jº. But
this is a grand instance of poetic licence and real imaginative power.
Delicate Diplomatists.
ONE of REUTER’s telegrams from Paris, announced that—
“This evening the Annamite Ambassadors will dine with M. Daou YN DE Lhuys.”
The Annamite Ambassadors use no pocket handkerchiefs, nor any-
thing of the kind. We hope M. DROUYN DE LBuys got over his
dinner without being very ill.

THEATRE ROYAL, WINDSOR CASTLE.
The QUEEN’s loving subjects will rejoice to hear that HER MAJESTY
intends to establish a theatre at Windsor Castle; a house which will
he pre-eminently a Theatre Royal, entitled to be called Her Majesty’s
Own Theatre.
There is something that raises the spirits of the nation in the effort
thus made by the QUEEN to sustain her own. It is plain that HER
MAJESTY has resolutely determined from a sense of duty to resort
to amusement as an alleviation of a grief that may be incurable,
though due consideration might change it into hope, capable even of
rising into joy. For such a grief, the theatre affords one of the most
effectual of earthly remedies. The suggestion, naturally raised by
dramatised human life, that “all the world’s a stage, and all the men
and women merely players,” tends to elevate the beholder above all the
world. When the curtain has fallen on a noble tragedy, and whilst the
grand words of ShakspeaRE are still ringing in the ears, the mind
looks above and beyond mortal ills; and the spectacle of a well-acted
§: must hint a particular consolation for a sorrow such as the
UEEN’s.
It was a happy and a queenly º to instal the Drama at Windsor
Castle; the thought of a mind friendly to ennobling art. The question,
by what Intelligence may this thought have been inspired, is one
W. well weighed, may also afford some comfort to the Royal
1(IOW.
May the successor of ELIZABETH be rewarded for her patronage of
the English Stage with a Victorian Drama, and live to be the Sovereign

PUNC) . OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
F. ROM OUR BILIOUS CONTRIBUTOR."
To M.R. PUNCH.
My VERY DEAR SIR,
YoU will be happy to hear that I may no longer bear the above
title. I am your bilious no longer. I am cured; I have returned to the
sweet fresh air of my native metropolis, and all unpleasant, sensations
have vanished, at least all but one, which I am sure will be dispelled by
a registered letter which I shall receive from your excellent cashier the
first thing to-morrow morning, in reply to a little billet which I did
myself the pleasure to forward to him from—ha! hal—a curious coinci-
dence—Bradbury, a station near Darlington. . This letter, therefore,
closes the account of my Scottish pilgrimage, but there is no rest but
the grave for the Pilgrim of Love. Did you ever hear me sing that
i. If so, you must be unwilling that your first impressions should
be disturbed by a second feat of vocalisation on my part.
Permit me to say, though I am in far too delightful a temper to be
rturbed by anything, that the picture which you took the friendly
iberty of subjoining to my last despatch, gives not the slightest idea of
my appearance as a Highlander. The somewhat coarse and far from
handsome porpoise whom your young man has drawn inviolent saltatory
action is as unlike myself as it is like another member of your staff
whose name I will not mention. I cannot be ſºlº. with you for an
innocent joke, but when this volume of Punch shall be re-issued man
years hence, I hope that in the charmingly written, introduction wit
which you will increase its value, you will explain that your singularly
handsome and graceful contributor was not º: in that disgusting
caricature. , Punch is an historical work, and the future MACAULAY
should not be led into mistakes, especially if, like the past MACAULAY,
he infers a man's whole character from a non-authentic portrait...I have,
however, been sitting for my bust to the most gifted sculptor in Scot-
land, and a photograph from this will enable another of your young men
to do me more justice in some playful yet gracious ebullition of fraternal
inspiration. I need hardly say that it is a love of accuracy, and not a
particle of yanity that dictates this suggestion, for I happen to have
none of the latter, though, as the poet says,
“Not a vanity is given in vain.”
As it happens, my dear Mr. Punch, I did not appear at the Highland
Games, at Inverness, in the beautiful tartans punctually supplied to me
} MR. MACDougALL. These I keep for the first fancy ball to which I
shall be invited by H. R. H., THE P--s or W-s. The fact is that
it scarcely ever rains in Scotland, but the weather made an exception
on the day of the Games, and I am bound to say that the water came
down handsomely, not dropping like the gentle Jew from heaven, but
luviously, a classical word with which I beg to enrich your vocabulary;
herefore, I laid away my beautiful dress, in my portmanteau, and
jº. at the Games in a simple garb that induced a magnificent
chieftain to say to me, with an iron hand-clutch which I feel yet,
“Why, EPICURUs, I thought you were a MAC -
MACINTosh.”
“Chieftain,” says I, “cucullus non facit monachum.; but I am not
going to get wet for all the pipers that played before Moses.” -
ºt # you are,” says he, “but you know you can't dance the High-
land fling, or put the stone, or toss the caber, in a macintosh. Do you
know that, son of the Saxon P”
“In that case, Chieftain,” says I, “and if your rules are so exces:
sively Medo-Persic, the son of the Saxon will trouble you for one of
those lovely cigars, which he will go and smoke under cover, behind
those lovely ladies.” - -
My friend immediately }. a handful of cigars in my hand, and I
wish he had doubled the donation (it is still open to him to do so by
railway), for they were gems, such as should be consumed only when a
man has made an epigram, or heard of the demise of his rich aunt, or
been rejected by some young lady, or attained some other piece of good
fortune. I retired, Sir, from the mud, and from a pleasant altitude
surveyed the scene. . It was not very lively. A small covered platform
stood in a sort of field, on one side of which was a stern stone building
of an educational character. A damp crowd, kept off by railings, sur-
rounded the field, and but for the warm colour of a great many Highland
garments, would have seemed an uninteresting crowd. . But on a large
and well protected stand, near the platform, sat a number of ladies of
the rarest beauty, and, my dear Punch, now that I am 600 miles beyond
the reach of the longest dirk, let me add—of the rarest patience. For
on that platform came Highlander after Highlander, dancing dances—
you have seen LYDIA THOMPSON, who hasn’t: Well, I wouldn’t give
one of her Scottish hornpipes, or whatever she likes to call them, for
all the exhibitions of that day. Yet the ladies looked on, and smiled,
to encourage the frantic, finger-snapping, dancing dervishes, and never
yawned, never looked weary. How do the women, manage this, Mr.
Punch * They have no cigars. Are they hypocrites! I would trample
on the tail of the fiend who should hint it. They are miracles, that is
it—standing, no, sitting miracles. I have seen them do it at the
theatres, and never move, or want to move, when I have, fidgeted out
of the box and into the refreshment saloon ten times in three hours—
You are a
may, have taken a walk to the Duke of I.O.U's column, and smoked
while a whole act passed, and have sulkily looked in at the windows of
the 91d Warriors' Qlub, or cast obliquitous glances at the bishops
coming out of the Minerva.... I have gone back, and there were my
ladies, sitting as before, smiling, serene, and only sorry that I had
#.ºiling which they said, and f verily believe thought, was
I did not see any cabers tossed or stones put, perhaps if I had I
shºuld have been more excited. But I saw prizes given, and I saw
ladies give them, and beheld the recipients, brave as steel and agile as
deer, tremble and stumble as they approached the Galaxy. For a
moment. I regretted that I had not been a competitor, and borne away
a few silver medals, bagpipes, and rifles, as I should of course have
done had I entered the lists. "I thought, with Achilles, of
“Prizes which none besides Ourselves could gain,
Should our immortal coursers take the plain.”
But better, and more generous feelings prevailed. “Why,” said I,
should I desire to come, with my limbs and eye trained by the match.
less and costly, teachers of the south, and by my varied accomplish-
ments wrench these laurels from these gallant and simple Highlandmen?”
I crushed the thought, and to punish myself for indulging in it, even
for a moment, I stood out and offered a prize of Fifty Guineas º your
name and at your expense) to the best Highland player at Spellikins for
1873. For we should encourage all manly arts. You had better write
to M.R.SNOWIE, of Inverness, who is the Nestor of the deer-slayers, and
whº gives them counsel, and weapons, and skilfully embalms the
antlered heads of their victims, and tell him to disseminate far and wide
through the Highlands the knowledge that your prize is offered. If you
like to send me the money, I will take care of it until it is wanted, and
afterwards.
Sir, Mr. Punch, I could tell you of many other things. I could
describe to you how, I paid a visit to a Castle, and of glorious doings
there, and how I killed, with my own hand, the very largest stag that had
been seen in these parts since ALEXANDER THE Good, KING of
SpotLAND, was rescued from an infuriated monster by a MACKENZIE
of that day, as shown in MR. WEST's famous picture, which, I saw
about ninety years ago at the sale of that late President's works, and
should like, especially, to see again. How, in memory of my great
deed, I planted a tree (a Cupressus Epicuri) upon the spot, which ºi be
shown, through centuries to come, as the place where the monarch of
the forest fell to the rifle of the fair-haired Saxon. I could tell you how,
near the loveliest waterfall in Scotland, Isprang over a river which the
most active of the gillies refused to take, and how I afterwards reposed
by its side and drank champagne, of the noblest vintage, to the bright
eyes that had witnessed the deed. How I had a single combat with
an eagle for the possession of a Highland bairn (name SHEMUs MAC-
TAGGART) which the carnivorous miscreant sought to carry off to its
ferocious cubs, and how I slew the eagle, and had him stuffed by MR.
SNowIE, and presented him—the eagle—to the Christian Young Men's
Society at Inverness. How I ate eleven dinners in one week, and even
by that supernatural effort could not entirely overtake my engagements,
but have left several to be eaten out on my return. I could tell you
all this, Sir, and more, and you might believe as much or as little of it
as you chose, but there would be a very decent infusion of truth in the
narrative. But I must conclude my tale, and for some time to come
address myself to epigrams for your pages.
Sir, I told you that a new railway had been opened, the Highland
Railway, as it must be emphatically called. Sir, that railway is a great
fact. Not that it enables you to avoid an awful detour, and the peril
of acquiring the Aberdonian accent (the Aberdeeners are first rate
people, and how gracefully they behaved to the Lady of the Land the
other day—but they cannot yet speak a language), though these are
eat blessings. But, Sir, it comes through scenery to have seen which
to adapt MR. PRIOR), is a pictorial education. That ride from Inver-
ness to Perth, Mr. Punch, is a thing to do whenever you have a chance.
Rough mountains, dark valleys, ſoaming cataracts, rich forests, and then
a sudden opening into a scene of sunshine, and a holiday looking region,
and then the change again and again—and such comfortable carriages,
We were as punctual, too, as clock-work, which is a great thing for a
new railway, and I should have regretted that I had got to Perth, if I
had not been so awfully hungry. For to a tourist accustomed to his
six or seven meals a day, an eight hours' ride is starvation, and I had
eaten all my sandwiches during the first hour.
To dash to Glasgow and sit for my bust" to MR. Ewing above indi-
cated, to spin to Edinburgh to give LoRD BROUGHAM a few heads for
his speech at the Social Science Meeting, to take train for town rid the
East Coast, and to arrive at my humble but tasteful home in this aris-
tocratic suburb, was the work of – I forget how long, nor does it
seem materially to concern you. . I sincerely hope that I shall have that
registered letter by the first post, and, I beg in conclusion to subscribe
myself,
My dear Sir,
Your returned Contributor,
Wapping Old Stairs. EPICURUs Rotun DUs.

How, when AND WHERE P
oR. THE MODERN Tourist's GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
UR own experience, which
has led us to give the fore-
going invaluable advice for
going as far as the Rigi,
will now furnish the Touris
with a rule to be observed
by every one who seeks this
usually sunny climb. A
great deal has been written
at divers times and in
divers places concerning
the actual necessaries to
be taken during an ascent.
One thing, and only one,
is it necessary for even the
hardiest mountaineer to
take, while toiling up the
precipitous, steep; let his
pace be slow, or let his
pace be fast, walk he with
tottering steps, or, firmly
lanted feet; the Tourist,
}. he high or low tall or
short, who goes up the Rigi
must take Breath.
Sit down awhile and
behold above you the broad
expanse of sky; this will
exalt your mind to the
contemplation of the lark; and what says the Poet,_
“Hark, hark, the dogs do bark,
For the lark at Billingsgate sings.”
Open your heart to your friend, if one be near you, but forget not to
open your chest and carp the vital airs. Ah! If you know any of the
musical compositions of Doctor Blow, now is the occasion for whistling
them. Walk up! walk up ! walk up ! To your leſt you’ll see the
black beetling crags; these will remind you of the strange creatures that
came up to look at you, and followed in your wake, when you paid an
unwilling nocturnal visit to the kitchen, under the impression that you
were about to bring a couple of burglars to account for a wrong double
entry. To your right you’ll see ever so many things that did not meet
your vision on your left, whereupon you will exclaim “Beautiful!
Beautiful!” somewhat aſter the well-known, time honoured manner of
the talented German siſſieur, Von JoEL, evergreen, ever GREEN’s
Walk up ! Walk up!
The agile admirer of the “beautiful for ever” (this line is not meant by
way of a toast or sentiment, though apart from the context it may be
adopted by members of the Alpine Club for that purpose) will probably
take a short cut, in order to reach the bird’s-eye view, sooner than his
fellow travellers. Our own personal remembrance of the short cut that
we chose, is, that it began very pleasantly, during which gentle progress
and halcyon time we congratulated ourselves upon our superior cunning;
that after half-an-hour the ascent became somewhat more decided, and
we, being in a broiling sun, jokingly comforted each other “that we
shouldn’t have much of this; ” that in the course of an hour the incli.
nation ºf the ascent increased inversely as our inclination for the
ascent; that in an hour and a half’s time we sat down helplessly and
bemoaned our happy childhood; that being parched with thirst we
induced a little peasant boy to give us to drink; that he brought us
kirschwasser of such a strength and old shoe-leathery taste, that we
couldn't drink it, save when qualified with water; which water he, for
a few small coins, procured for us; our grateful remembrance of this boy
is that he was a wonderful boy, the most wonderful boy we’d ever seen;
that, despite the fact of the descent to the limpid stream being of the very
early perpendicular style of mountain architecture, this boy, this won.
derful boy, holding in his hand the broad-mouthed shallow wooden
bowl of kirschwasser, executed, after the manner of his English brethren
in the London streets, “three catherine wheels a penny,” without
spilling a single drop, (was he not a wooooonderful boy?) and in this
way arrived safely at the running stream. Here he filled the bowl, and
safely ascended to our place of session, walking or jumping, as far as
our memory serves us, upon his head. We rewarded him handsomely,
and he disappeared, down somewhere, as suddenly as he had risen
before us; a grin, a kick, a leap into the air — and he was gone!
There was no smell of brimstone Could he have been the lubber
fiend? The Kobbold of this country? A Brownie maybe; and, now we
recall the colour of his skin, we hesitate no longer to decide that we on
that occasion did see a veritable Brownie.
Perpendicular becomes the ascent of the short cut, and he who takes
this road will never use his feet as the sole mode of progression until
within a few yards of the Rigi Culm.
Think you, O Tourist of 1863, that in Switzerland you can be ſree
from
THE GHOST | THE Ghost THE GHOST
Not a bit of it. If you're in luck's way, you’ll see the spectre of
the Rigi. Of course it is patented. Give the waiter at the Rigi Culm
Hotel a noble gratuity, and he’ll tell you all about it. Albeit, the only
spectre we came across was the landlord of the abovementioned hostelrie
with his little bill, which shook our nerves fearfully. We were nearly
running away, but were prevented by —— no matter what. Lº
Joyful is the moment when the golden spire of the Inn, effulgent,
shines on the sun-scorched faces of the weary travellers. Let us here
stop to remark that, when we arrived at the top, we found that our
short cut had taken us exactly two hours longer than going round by
the ordinary route. This discovery at such a moment is calculated
to act upon the temper even of the most angelic. . You come late and
can’t get a room. Ha! ha" (Stage direction, laughs sardonically).
“Waiter 1’’ “Yes, Sir” (Erit waiter in the opposite direction). You
turn and find him gone, or rather don’t find him, because he has gone.
Another menial in a blouse. Ha! “Waiter | * tisn’t the waiter, but
no matter. “Garçon /* “Ouim'sieu.” (Erit second waiter hurriedly
through a small door in the passage). In desperation you open it in
order to follow him. The door leads apparently nowhere, or, to fifteen
other doors, which means the same thing. “Garçon / Kellner / Waiter/
Hi! Here! anybody—I want to wash.” “Hot water—donney more
o show. No, I mean eau sucrée—no that’s swearing—I mean——”
Never mind what you mean, the Table d’Hôte is nearly ready. Rush
into the kitchen, regard not the screams of the men servants or maid
servants, nor the stricken cook, but wrench the boiling kettle from its
brooding o'er the coals, and make for the first dressing-room at hand;
stand not upon the order of your going, but go it! Should Kellners
interfere, cry, “This to decide!” One, two, three, four, under; one,
two, three, four, over—thrust, and he falls. You reach a chamber.
Lots of queer-patterned crockery about, seize and take anything to
wash your hands in. Soap and nail-brush in your pocket of course.
“Garçon / Femme de Chambre / Hi done / ici towels. What’s towels in
French: Donney more assets—my assets, you know.” Go through the
pantomine of rubbing your hands, and the attendant will probably say,
“Oui, M'sieu, c'est très bien froid,” or something equally to the point,
and leave you, which isn’t exactly what you wanted. You want to get
a glimpse of the view before going to dinner. Rush out. Nothing but
mist. Wonderful! Beautiful! A friend tells you that you should
have been up there two hours ago and seen “the voo” then. “Ha!”
you return, “we had much better voos coming up here. We came
by an unusual path; not in the common track; so hackneyed. You
should try it, it's worth going down again, merely to come up by it.”
Here’s an opportunity for romancing—but now the dinner. Ha! soup.
Carried in triumphantly. Take off the cover; a thin steam ascends.
l'he landlord commences ladling. Consternation is on his face, horror
on the Waiters' countenances ! What is it * The guests tremble.
They are in a foreign land: and one crusty old gentleman already pulls

COSTERMONGERS AND ORGAN-GRINDERS.
MY DEAR STR RICHARD,
THE gallant Blues of Scotland Yard, of whose tartamless clan
you are the chief, I suppose have some arrangement made for enabling
them, once a week, when off duty, to acknowledge that they have left
undone those things which they ought to have done, and have done
those things which they ought not to have done. Now, the whole of a
Policeman's life, equally with that of any other man, ought to be spent
in trying to be able to make that acknowledgment with as little truth as
possible. But the Police have either a special proclivity, or else special
orders, in one particular at least, not to do that which they ought to
do by all means, and to do that which they ought not to do on any
account. They drive British º: from the pavement of a
locality where they are wanted, and allow Italian organ-grinders in
the streets. On the pavement the costermongers are earning their
subsistence by useful industry. In the streets the organ-grinders'extort
pence from the lovers of peace and quietness by making a worse than
useless noise. The barrows of the costermongers create no obstruction.
The organs of the organ-grinders constitute a great nuisance. To many
people the disturbance of organ-grinding is insufferable, to some ruinous,
and it gives nobody any but the very slightest pleasure. The coster-
mongers give no one any but the least inconvenience; and they are the
greengrocers and fishmongers of the poor. Why, then, do your con-
stables compel the British costermongers to move on, and leave the
Italian organ-grinders to be paid by those whom they annoy for doing so?
Why do they thus molest #. doves whilst they spare the crows?
I am afraid that the Bobbies, as they are termed by the lower orders,
who I suppose call you the Bob major, cherish a certain sympathy with
those villainous foreign organ-grinding vagabonds. They have them-
selves taken what they suppose to be a musical turn lately, have formed
bands, and misemploy their leisure in practising tunes, which they
murder, with the same effect, I am credibly informed, as that of killing
a pig; excruciating the ears, distracting the mind, and arresting lite-
rary and scientific pursuits; not a fit amusement for those whose busi-
mess is that of taking up offenders. The Police themselves have become
organised banditti; is º why they connive at Italian organ-grinders?
As long as costermongers pursue a quiet occupation, let them alone.
Silence them, if you like, when they cry sparrergrass, watercreases, and
other vegetables about the streets, because then they practise an offen-
sive calling. Yet they have at least watercress and asparagus to offer
in excuse for their yells; but the grinding-organist yields no vegetable,
fruit, or §. of any kind to atone for making much more horrible
noises. Spare the inoffensive vendor of greens, but send the organ-
grinder, who persists in the offence of organ-grinding, to grind, with
somewhat more, muscular exertion, and less noise, a few days at the
crank. You will thus oblige the most valuable members of society
known to 49&ANUIH.
*...* The little thieves collect round the costermongers’ barrows, do
they?. So much the better I should say, if I wore a blue uniform, and
a list bracelet, and had to catch them.
A SHOT FROM A STERN-CHASER.
“He would like to take the old Mother by the hair and give her a good shaking.”
-See Mr. Secretary Chase's Stump-speech at Cincinnati.
Lo, rowdy young America,
floud stumpin', rantin', ravin',
Renews his bills at ninety days
To make Rebellion cave in.
Enlarging debt, contracting rights,
Suspending habeas corpiº,
Blind flound'ring, nose in air, just like
The late-lamented Porpoise.
And CHAse, on Southern necks prepared
To rivet yokes and collars,
If only for his neat green-backs
The North will change her dollars,
Utters a threat, that in her shoes
May well set England quaking,
To “Take the old Mother by the hair,
And give her a good shaking!”
With LEE's head-quarters pushed within
Two short days’ march of Washington,
f you can’t strike a swashing blow,
You’d best talk in a swashing tone!
With Rosecrass whipped, and BURNSIDE checked,
And DAHLGREN's guns stopped shooting,
And gold gone up to fifty-two,
It’s time for high-faluting!
Well—the old Mother’s much obliged
To her Columbian daughter,
And notes the filial sentiments
Expressed across the water.
But taking people by the hair
Is not her style of clinching;
She leaves that game to fighters trained
For scalping, gouging, Lynching,
Or to viragos of the slums,
Billingsgate and such places,
Who first claw caps and then clutch hair,
And end by scratching faces. ,
Spatt’ring each other with foul speech,
Or mud, when speech grows weaker,
In style that BEEchER WARD might teach,
Or set up a stump-speaker.
Beware, lest if you stir a hand
The old Mother's hair for lifting,
In smiting, you find her more smart
Than even you in shifting.
The Mother may be old, the Child
That threatens her be young;
But there are youthful limbs ill-knit,
And old ones firmly strung.
She held you once across her knee
When you’d outgrown chastising:
You floored the old dame and taught her truths
She suffered for despising.
That lesson, “Never take the whip
To lads too big for whipping,”
She now commends to those she sees
O'er the same stone a-tripping.
If once the old Mother from her child
To a back-fall submitted,
It was the cause that made her weak,
Her offsprings' sinews knitted;
Think upon that, you who’d coerce
Four millions of your equals—
Chaw up the South, and then chaw up
England and France for sequels 1
Birkenhead and Southdown Rams.
AN Agricultural Gentleman,"staasing on the top of a hill among the

YANKEES AND RUSSIANS.
QUR, friends who identify, the cause of the
Federal States with that of liberty, should read
this extract from the Moscow Journal:—

“RUSSIA.—THE RUSSIAN SQUADRON AT
NEW YORK.
“Negotiations must be entered into with America, so
that, in case of need, she may be able to reckon upon
us. The more intimate and solid our alliance with
America, the more England will find it to her interest to
keep upon good terms with Russia. The commercial world
in England shudderedatthenews of the Russian squadron
having been seen in the Atlantic. Our fleet was useless
to us during the Crimean war, but the eight frigates now
at sea will render us considerable services in the event of
war with the maritime Powers, for they will keep the
Commercial Navies of England and France in check-
This is the reason why Russia has dispatched them at
a favourable time to hold the sea. Our cruisers will find
refuge in the neutral ports of America; they will be the
terror of the Commercial marine of hostile Powers, and
will compel any such to employ half, their navies in
guarding their merchantmen.”
They should also consider the words spoken,
according to the Times, when ADMIRAL LEs-
soffsky was feasted at Astor House, in propos-
ing the health of the EMPERoR of Russia, by a
MR. BRADY, who called England “a detestable
land,” and eulogised the CzAR for being “abso-
lute as a monarch, and allied to the people of all
countries by his efforts in behalf of the freedom
of his own.”. M.R. BRADY is probably an Irish
gentleman, who has quitted his native country
in disgust with a Government which fails to

doubtless ashamed of the land of his birth, or
his fathers, which he has renounced for the freer

SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
It is not often that sporting matters, be they of ever such a
shady nature, find their way into our shadows; but we cannot help
noticing a startling Fact of the Turf, which, from being very regularly
º: # the papers, is now known to the public eye by the myste-
rious ulule O
MIDNIGHT BETTING.
What an awful scene must it be . . A room dimly lighted, a door-
eeper surveying the candidate for admission through a small grating,
and then, after cautiously opening the door to a short chain's length,
demanding the secret pass-word known only to the initiated. Every
one, armed with the steel of GILLOTT, or with a pointed weapon whose
marks are as indelible as the ſancied stain upon the little hand of the
Thane of Caudor's wife, moves stealthily from corner to corner, darkly
:::::::::: as he passes, to some hooded companion, on whose brow the
weight of more hats than one has left its dull red mark. What do ye
Black and Midnight Hag-glers ? Here, the trembling novice, still
unconvinced by the Home influences of Mediums, may quail before the
Qld Hands and Black legs that glide mysteriously about the room.
'Tis at this witching time of might, that news of the dark horses may
be heard, and, perhaps, at the first cock-crow, the last midnight Bet is
on, and the last midnight Bettors are off.
We have been hearing a great deal about the carelessness on board
the Solent Steamers. The short answers of the officials connected with
these boats to ordinary civil questions, will lead to their name being
changed from the Solent Steamers to the In-solent Steamers.
The EMPREss EugéNIE while in Spain was talking of bringing over
in her special train certain Matadores, Pigadores, Battledores, and other
entry of a like kidney, for the purpose of getting up a Bull Fight in
aris. An improvement has been suggested by a very high authority,
namely, that the Matadores shall be Russians, and that the sport for
the spectators shall be a JoHN BULL fight.
There will soon be a tight little Isle to let. , Ireland will shortly be
in the market, as the present tenants are leaving for America as
speedily as possible.
A few of the Japanese Princes came the other day to offer peaceful
gifts to one of our officers. The Captain, fearing some treachery, reſused

JEAMEs. “They say the Henglish Hupper Classes is subject to near sight;
so we'd need be, by Jingo, with wisitin' Cards no bigger than Postage
Stamps.”
CORPORATION REFORM.
“OH ! that this too, too solid flesh would melt l” is the bootless
exclamation of many who, like Hamlet, are “fat and scant of breath.”
Among them, for several years, appears to have been numbered the
author of a little pamphlet now before us, entitled Letter on Corpulence,
addressed to the Public, by WILLIAM BANTING. London: HARRIson
& Sons. MR. BANTING thus feelingly depicts the vexations which
corpulence entails upon its unfortunate victim:—
“Any one so afflicted is often subject to public remark, and though in conscience
he may care little about it, I am confident no man labouring under obesity can be
quite insensible to the sneers and remarks of the cruel and injudicious in public
assemblies, public vehicles, or the ordinary street traffic; nor to the annoyance of
finding no adequate space in a E. assembly if he should seek amusement or
need refreshment, and therefore he naturally keeps away as much as possible from
places where he is likely to be made the object of the taunts and remarks of others.
I am as regardless of public remark as most men, but I have felt these difficulties,
and therefore avoided such circumscribed accommodation and notice, and by that
means have been deprived of many advantages to health and comfort.”
It is certainly discomposing, if not annoying, to be called Ribs and
Tallow, and Bow-window, and to be saluted as Double-viscera (the
latter word transated) by the boys, or the cabmen who accost you
under that appellation with “Now then " and tell you to get out of
the way. In an omnibus the discomfort of corpulence is aggravated by
the jeers and titters of the passengers between whom the ſat man is
wedged, as well as by the smirk on the faces of his sniggering opposite
neighbours.
The serenest philosopher, is apt to be provoked by the insolence
which suddenly laughs him in the face, although he may not care a fig
for the knowledge of the fact that the whole of his acquaintance are
accustomed to ridicule him behind his back. If, his obesity is
conjoined with benevolence, he may even attempt, if invited, to dance
at , an evening party, in order to afford, mirth to the beholders by
exhibiting ... one of the most ludicrous objects in the world.
The merriment which the wise are prepared to create does not offend
them, who nevertheless might be enraged by unexpected derision;
although, to be sure, a corpulent, man should make up his mind to
expect that...wherever he goes. At any rate, he is certain, as MR.
BANTING intimates, of incurring it in, an omnibus, and if, to avoid it,
he clambers on to the roof, he generally cracks his trousers, breaks his
buttons, and hurts himself.
There is a homely pathos in our author's subjoined description of
the physical annoyances attendant, on what is vulgarly called a
'corpºration.” MR, BANTING had, it should be premised, placed
himself “in dock”—that is, under medical treatment—“perhaps twenty
times in as many years,” for the reduction of his bulk; but “physicians
were in vain;” and this was what he came to three years ago, at the
age of sixty-three:—
“Although no very great size or weight, still I could not stoop to tie my shoe, so
to speak, nor attend to the little offices humanity requires without considerable
pain and difficulty, which only the corpulent can understand; I have been com-
pelled to go down-stairs slowly backwards, to save the jar of increased weight upon
the ancle and knee joints, and been obliged to puff and blow with every slight
exertion, particularly that of going up-stairs. I have spared no pains to remedy
this by low living (moderation and light food was generally prescribed, but I had no
direct bill of fare to know what was really intended), and that, consequently,
brought the system into a low impoverished state, without decreasing corpulence,
caused many obnoxious boils to appear, and two rather formidable carbuncles, for
which I was ably operated upon and fed into increased obesity.”
Corpulence is generally the consequence of gluttony, and curable by
iroderation;, but there are many cases in which it co-exists with very
abstemious living, and MR. BANTING, though naturally a pretty good
trencherman, was never the slave of a municipal voracity. In such cases
can it be reduced by any abstinence short of low diet P MR. BANTING's
pamphlet is written to testify, by his own personal experience, that it
can. His sight beginning to ſail, and his hearing to be impaired, after
having, as aforesaid, consulted numerous practitioners to no purpose,
he a last “ſound the right man;” who put him on a plan of diet which
we proceed to transcribe in his own words for the benefit of Punch's
numerous readers, who laugh and grow ſat:—
“For breakfast, I take four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys, broiled!"fish
bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork; a large cup of tea (without milk or
sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce of dry toast.
“For dinner, Five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork,
any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any
kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira
—Champagne, Port, and Beer forbidden.
“For tea, Two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of tea without
milk or sugar.
“For supper, Three or four ounces of meat or fish, similar to dinner, with a glass
or two of claret.
“For nightcap, if required, A tumbler of grog—(gin, whisky, or brandy, without
sugar)—or a glass or two of claret or sherry.”
MR. BANTING, by the observance of this diet-scale, than which, as
he justly observes, “that man must be an extraordinary person who
would desire a better table,” has been “reduced many inches in bulk,
and thirty-five pounds in weight in thirty-eight weeks;” has got rid of
all the special inconveniences of obesity, has had his sight restored,
his hearing improved, and his “other bodily ailments” greatly
“ameliorated.”
The pri ciple of the regimen on which MR. BANTING appears to have
nearly regained his figure, is that of excluding “starch and saccharine
matter as much as possible.” It is, doubtless, a sound one; yet
vital chemistry transmutes potatoes into Irish muscle. PADDY, who
rejoices in potatoes, is often a stout ſellow, but he is never a fat one,
and the same may be said of SAwNEY, rejoicing in oatmeal. The
O'FLANAGANs are no fatter than the M'LEANs. A man who eats
potatoes and meat too, will eat more meat and §: more potatoes
than he would if he ate potatoes alone. Potatoes are sauce to
mutton, and beef. A safe rule for the reduction of, corpulence
would be that of eating as much as you can of any of those things
which you dislike, and nothing at all of anything that you like.
Another infallible plan for obtaining a diminution of bulk would be
that of marrying on the principle that what is enough for one is enough
for two. There is no encumbrance so bad as that which is borne by
the man who is a burden to himself. For further particulars as to the
method by which that burden may be rejected, let the overgrown
reader consult MR. BANTING's publication. Ye who waddle, a you
toddle, hooted through the streets and squares, hear MR. BANTING, no
longer panting, and puffing as he goes up-stairs.
SETTLED IN A CRACK.
OUR excellent friend, the Liverpool Mail, is exceeding angry with
LoRD Russell about those Rams, and castigates him vehemently.
May difference of opinion, et cetera; but the Mail's concluding obser-
vation is to the point:—
“Mr. LAIRD's great speech at Birkenhead contains a volume in a nutshell.”
So, according to the history of one ALEXANDER THE GREAT,...did
another j which was made to contain a volume called the Iliad.
That was a chronicle of a long and sanguinary war. . M.R. LAIRD might
have helped us to another. So we are rather thankful to EARL RUSSELL
for cracking the nutshell, and showing us, instead of a savage Iliad, a
Tory maggot.

FEDERAL PROCLIWITIES.
As writers always say when they are going to make a long preach-
ment, “the following paragraphs require no comment.”
We learn from New York that:—
“A grand municipal banquet was given to the Russian officers on Monday at the
Astor House. The British and French consuls and the officers of the British
and French fleets declined the invitation, upon E. of previous engagements.
Speeches were made lauding Russian policy and denouncing French and English
diplomacy. The Russian ambassador returned thanks for the EMPERoR of Russia's
health in warm terms. MR SEwARD sent a letter excusing his absence, and sug-
esting a toast to the health and honour of PRINCE GoRTchakoff, not more able in
efending his country's policy than just and liberal in conducting relations with
America."
In the same newspaper which contains the above statement (the
Daily Telegraph), and in the very next column, we read something about
the nature of the “policy” which MR. Seward, liberator of slaves, is
delighted to see defended so cleverly by the Russian Minister.
“Our news from Poland to-day exceeds in barbarity anything we have lately had
to record. The deportation to Siberia of the whole youthful population of a district,
many arrests for not signing an address expressive of devoted loyalty to the Czar,
imprisonments, and military murders—these are bad enough ; but, in addition, we
have two ladies, one cruelly flogged, receiving, indeed, 260 lashes, for not betraying
the hiding-place of her husband, and a second driven mad by the sight of her only
child torn from her arms and trampled to death before her eyes under the feet of
the Russian soldiery.”
That’s all. Except that we are heartily glad that no British or
French officers were present when the health and honour of the Cossack
was proposed at the instigation of the Federal.
Imperial Mnemonics.
WE hasten to supply a slight omission in our contemporaries’ trans-
lation of the speech of the EMPEROR. His Majesty with great con-
sideration delicately hinted to MM. BERRYER, Thiers, Jules-FAvRE,
and the other gentlemen who speak the sentiments of Paris, if not ol
France, that he hoped they would remember not to perjure themselves,
but the journals do not give the exact text. It was this. “You have
all taken the same oath to me” that I took to the Republic. The last
six words have not been reported, but it will be seen how materially they
increase the force of His Majesty’s charming eloquence.
FAREWELL TO FARMING.
“Success to Farming!” is a good old English toast, and so are
“Speed the Plough!” and “Prosperity to Agriculture!” But the time
seems tº be coming when such sentiments will seem quite out of place
on English soil, and if uttered will be spoken more in mockery than
earnest. At least, such is the opinion of a rural JEREMIAH who has
lately sent a lengthy Lamentation to the Times, on the decay of British
farmers, and their prospects of extinction, through many cogent causes,
one being that they shortly may expect to find no land in England left
forº to farm. This terrible prediction is told in these dark
Words:-
“The farmer's position at the present time is one not to be envied, and, so far as
my humble opinion goes, I see little prospect of its ever being better, so long as we
are at e.
-- #: I am told, can be delivered in the port of London at 33s. per qr, from
America, and in years of plenty cheaper. Agriculture is improving very much on
the Continent, and consequently more and more of its produce will be sent to this
country; and the English farmer, with all his multitude of implements and arti-
ficials, can never compete with it. Land in England will not pay for growing wheat,
and more than half of the purchasers of land at the present time purchase it with
an ultimate object of building. It is well known that we are depending on the
foreigner for more than one-third of our daily bread, and ultimately must depend
on him for the greatest part of it, if not all.
“No man, however contracted his ideas, however superficial his knowledge, can
be blind to this fact, that the greater part, if not the whole of the southern part of
this island, will be taken up by º: and railways, &c. Go in whatever-direc-
tion you may, you see building going on in a very rapid manner, and, looking at the
map, the present and the projectedlines of railway will render it a complete network.
This, then, must materially diminish * productive pºrt of the land, and substitute
--- ul nati
in its place the ptive. as a st can, perhaps, afford
to retire, build overherland, and purchase her necessary commodities of not
so prosperous.”
Here’s a pretty prospect this prophetic soul has pictured tº Goodbye
to farming, gentlemen, for there will soon be no more farms; and good
bye too, to foxhunting, and all our other field sports. For of course the
North, and East, and West will follow in due time the example of the
South, and from John o'Groat’s House down to the Land's End, there
will be bricks and mortar everywhere, and not a spot to shoot over.
Building leases will be granted in the place of farming ones, and for the
“four course shift,” the lawyers will have something to say about the
four-storey system. Turnip fields will disappear and so will partridges
and pheasants, and if they wish for sport, our foxhunters must emigrate.
As the green fields disappear the black towns will accumulate, and
swelling drop by drop, the sea of houses gradually will cover the whole
island. The country by degrees will cease to be a country, and, being
wholly built over, Great Britain will perhaps be re-chri
London.
A fearful state of things this for a man who loves a country life to
bring his mind to ponder on. Let us be thankful, O my brethren, that
we are not as were the Methuselahs of old, and that few of us need feel
much apprehension lest we be endowed with such obstinate vitality, as
to survive to see the prophecy here shadowed forth fulfilled.

A MESSAGE FROM THE SPIRIT OF SHAKSPEARE.
UNCH had been toiling through a pile of plans, programmes,
projects, prospectuses, proclamations, and propositions on
the subject of the celebration of the approaching ter-
centenary anniversary of SHAksPEARE's birth. A dozen
rival committees had been bombarding him with requests
to join them. . A hundred invitations for banquets, in
honour of the day lay upon his table: innumerable solici-
tations for his co-operation and assistance, in doing reve-
rence to the memory of the immortal WILLIAM, filled his
waste-paper basket. There was hardly anything he had not
been asked to do, from appearing in a round of favourite
characters from SHAKSPEARE's plays, to writing a masque
for the Crystal Palace, working in BioNDIN on the high-
rope, LeoTARD on the Trapeze, the antediluvian animals,
and the ethnological models, the HANDEL orchestra, and
the whole strength of the Metropolitan dramatic companies,
in private life and plain clothes.
There was one enthusiastic gentleman calling upon him
for designs for a Walhalla, to be erected on the Heights of
Dover, five hundred feet long by sixty high, to be filled
with groups of statuary, and adorned with frescoes, of
subjects from SHAKSPEARE's plays, with a grand allegorical
group for a centre-piece, of the Poet, taming the passions,
educating the affections, kindling imagination, and giving
the rein to fancy.
A second enthusiast enclosed him calculations of the
amount required to found SHAKSPEARE scholarships at all
our principal public schools. A third sought his opinion
of the working drawings for a Shakspearian museum, and chamber of relics, at Stratford-on-Avon, to be built of glass and iron and to take
in the birth:place, the site of New Place, the grammar school, the church, and, ANNE HATHAway's cottage. A fourth, more modest, only
asked Mr. Punch's advocacy for the foundation of SHAkspeaRE lectureships in all our principal towns, and offered himself as lecturer. A fift
enclosed Shakspeare, an Epic in Ten Books of an average of 1000 lines each, with the . that Mr. Punch would cast his eyes over it, and
then say whether any commemoratiºn of the great poet could be so appropriate as the publication of this tribute to his genius, and the adequate
remuneration of its author out of the public purse. No wonder if, weary and worm out, amid this multiplicity of schemes and suggestions,
Mr. Punch gently dropped asleep in his elbow chair.
And then he dreamt.
He saw in his dream a vast Temple, ſilled with forms, that first seemed shadowy, but as the mind was fixed on them gradually assumed all the
solidity and substance of living men and women, forms of beauty, and terror, of tenderness beyond expression, of sadness so intense and
mirth so fresh and sunny, that the mind contemplating them was seized with alternate contagion of tears, and laughter. . All this array of
thronging forms moved round a calm man, in black silk doublet and hose of Elizabethan fashion, with a bald forehead of singular height and
breadth, sparingly crowned with thin, soft, auburn, hair; a slight chesnut-coloured moustache covered his upper lip, and a peaked beard
scarcely concealed the outline of his firmly rounded chin.
He sat at his ease; the ſorms seemed to move, and group themselves at his bidding: but his will was put forth with such an absence of
ſº § effort, that you could scarce believe him the ruler of the thronging phantoms whose life seemed, almost more stirring and substantial
than his Own.
The effortless ease and majesty of this central personage at first blinded, you to the fact of his mighty stature, till you became
aware of it by, involuntary comparison of him with a host of little atomies, incessantly fretting and fuming and fussing about his feet,
climbing, as high as they could on his chair, prying into such parts of his clothes as they, could reach, and making frantic efforts, some to
'lay jà of the forms that circled about him, other, to bring them wiſhin the field of their telescopes, opera-glasses, eye-glasses,
spectacles of all colours, and all magnifying and diminishing powers. Not till you saw that these atomies were of the ordinary stature of
manhood did the mind, realise the colossal proportions of him about whom they pressed and fretted. Mr. Punch felt that he was looking at
SHAKSPEARE, his Creations, and his Commentators.
And then the vision changed, as visions do. The hall remained, but the central chair was empty, and though the thronging forms were still
visible, and here and there, shone in even a more vivid light, most of them looked distorted, and some were altogether transformed and travestied.
The swarms of commentators had given place to a crowd of much the same aspect and stature, and not less fussy and eager. These homuncules
were toiling, some singly, some in groups, to liſt up a number of little pedestals, all inscribed with the name of SHAKspeARE, but on which
Mr. Punch observed that almost every one of them in turn *...*to perch himself. No sooner was he up than a rival invariably came
to dislodge him, and in his turn aspired to the pedestal, to be, in his turn, upset. And then Mr. Punch knew that he was looking on the
Celebrators, as he had just before been looking on the Commentators of SHAKSPEARE.
Suddenly he heard a friendly rap on the table at his elbow. He started, as the spirit—for of course it was a spirit-spºiled out, letter by
letter—S. H. A. K. (he didn't put in the E) S. P. E. R. E!
Then he knew he was wide awake, and that, though no medium for the communications of mere vulgar spirits, WILLIAM SHAkspeaRE had
chosen Mr. Punch as the appropriate channel for conveying his thoughts to the mind of England, A.D. 1863.
“They talk of monuments to be set up to me,” he said, “of tercentenary celebrations, of scholarships to be founded, institutions to be
established, charities to be endowed, fancy balls to be danced and dressed, dinners to be eated, speeches to be uttered, all in honour of
WILL SHAKSPEARE-the woul-stapler’s son, who saw the light in Stratford-on-Avon, next St. George's day was three hundred years.
As if WILL SIIAKSPEARE wanted other monument of his body or his brainwork than he has lef behind him. Sute the tomb in Stratford-
on-Avon chancel suffices for the one, and my plays for the other. I might have wished ſor a better sculptor than the scurvy Dutchman who
*h. º: and DICK BURBAGE and WILL CoNDELL might have looked closer afer the rogues who printed their folio; but let both pass
—they’ll serve.
“Monument, quotha! my plays are my monument, and if they would do me honour, e'en let them do it, as a manager and play-writer would
wish it done. Let them take me a theatre—act me as I would be acted—not palmed on men upon the strength of cunning scenes, rich
hangings, fine clothes, huge . crowds, and such trumpery; but commended to them by means of honest speech, and well-graced
acting. Spend me your money in keeping up a theatre to this end, and if the public, at the first, be too deboshed by brainless show, and
apes’ tricks and foolery, to relish strong stage-meat, neatly dished and deſtly served up, the taste for it will come, and then let them that have
charge of the money, consult further about the spending ºf it—for the advancement of good stage playing—the paying for good plays—the
hiring of good actors, and so forth. For this I, WILL SHAKSPEARE, wrought while 1 lived, and by working for this, England will best
honour, and most worthily perpetuate, WILL SHAKSPEARE's memory.”
... Here the spirit ceased. But to Mr. Punch the suggestion seemed worth more than most spirit-communications, and so he has recorded
it, and begs to commend it to the cogitation of England.

WHILE THEY ARE ABOUT IT, THE AUTHoRITIEs HAD BETTER send A FEw SPECIAL Constables Down To BRIGHToN, wheae. THEY ARE

FRENCH REVOLUTION IN DRESS.
WE are indebted to the Paris correspondent of the Morning Post for
a summary of a “despatch from a Lady of the highest importance,”
which lately appeared in the Mémorial Diplomatique. This momentous
State Paper, signed GRAziosa, and relative to a subject of no less con-
sequence than that of wearing apparel, “is addressed to his Excellency
M. LE CHEvaLIER DEBRAUX De SALDANHA, who is requested, though
privately, to read and leave a copy of the despatch with all the pretty
women of Paris”—a pleasant and perhaps not very laborious task,
though we shouldn’t like to have to read even half a dozen lines to all
the pretty women in London.
At any rate, however, French ladies know how to make the most of
their beauty: and, diplomatising with that object—
“The PRINCESS GRAziosa º that all the pretty women of fashion on their
return from ‘the waters' find themselves under the influence of those fancy
toilettes which were permitted at Baden-Baden, Biarritz, and all other civilised
resorts of fashion. To part with costumes which were so becoming to varied des-
criptions of beauty, and put on the uniform of Paris is intolerable; it offends the
dignity of independence and lacerates the heart with a profound grief.”
So that the gayest Parisian fashions for November cover many a torn
and bleeding heart, and mock a sorrow deeper than that which drapes
itself in black. GRAZIOSA “cannot regard with indifference the mental
affliction to which so many amuable female minds are exposed.” Ac-
cordingly she has hoisted the banner of freedom of election in regard to
costume. Ladies who have a taste of their own, and have the courage
to consult it, will rejoice to learn that- -
P “It has been then decided by MADAME G–, “that she will wear her Figaro in
aris.’”
We hope some British beauty will outshine the foreign one by
wearing her Punch in London near her heart. But to proceed:—
“MADAME DE D. will continue to appear in the pretty short Scotch costume sug-
gested by her pretty feet.”
A very good suggestion, which, if our young ladies would adopt, it
M. save them the trouble of holding up their dresses with their
lands.
And then:—
“The CountEss G. has solemnly declared that nothing shall induce her to put
away her sea-side round hat, with the white wing of a bird coquettishly placed
therein, which makes her look five years younger."
She would look nicer with the wing of a pheasant in her round hat,
and more coquettish also, because the ornament would signify some-
thing very much like “Come and eat me,” as the little roast pigs
somewhere ran about saying. Yet the wing of a goose, which is the
wing of a white bird, is very nice too, would be attractive, and might, or
might not, be appropriate. However, a chicken's wing would be rather
unsuitable to a lady of whom we are told that a certain style of hat
“makes her look five years younger.” Is the diplomatic GRAziosa a
satirical TALLEYRAND F
Lastly:-
“The PRINorss P. has announced to her family “that she would not give up her
Polish boots for an empire.”
Polish boots are certainly more elegant, and more feminine, than
boots with military heels, not Polish, but polished, or such as might be
polished by a member of the Shoeblack Brigade.
Much, that is contrary to common sense, has been said about the
Rights of Women, but among those rights women may reasonably
claim the right of dressing as they please. We hail the dawn of inde-
pendence, and the resistance to the tyranny of Fashion proclaimed by
GRAziosa. It is an evidence of intelligent volition which may be con-
sidered to refute the too specious idea of the essentially instinctive
nature of the female mind. Hope for humanity is inspired by woman
asserting her rational prerogative in adopting a fancy-dress, albeit, that
of a revived Bloomer.
A Tribe of the Catti.
THE New York Anti-Slavery Standard says, “Russia is slaying a
people whom it has twice murdered.”. We candidly sympathise in the
indignation of the Irish gentleman who writes the article; but would
ask him how many lives he thinks Poles have P Does he mistake them
for Pole-Cats?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 201
THE NAGGLETONS AT HOVE.
Our friends have, like all other civilised people, been absent from the
Aſetropolis for some time. They took a house at Eastbourne, for the
season, but the defences which the doctors of that place made for it”
unhealthiness, convinced MR. and MRs. NAGGLEton that a locality
requiring so much advocacy had better be left to the sanatory autho-
rities. So they came on to Brighton. They have just come in to lunch.
Mr. Maggleton. I don't seem to want any lunch.
Mrs. Naggleton. It would be strange if you did, after eating all those
apples and sweetmeats and rubbish. - -
Mr. N. I had only one apple, and one pear-drop, which the children
made me take.
Mrs. N. Made you take'. And ſº call yourself the head of a family,
and pretend to guide and direct the rest. If you could not help in-
dulging your own school-boy tastes, you might have some consideration
for the children, and not stuff them with trash and spoil their dinners.
Mr. N. Why, you bought the apples yourself.
Mrs. N. But not to be eaten then. I meant them for dessert.
Mr. N. You didn't say so, and it was difficult to inſer, the fact from
your immediately proceeding to distribute them among the kids.
Mrs. M. Kids! Is that the language you wish your children to talk?
Mr. N. They are none of 'em in the room. -
Mrs. N. It would be just the same if they were. I have noticed that.
MR. SNOTCHLEY quoted one night a line he had learned from some
Latin classical poet which you would do well to study and act upon.
Mr. N. What did the Latin classical poet say to MR. SNOTCHLEY,
my dear, I forget, I’m sure. Was it Varium et mutabile semper famina &
Mrs. N. I dare say—it sounded like that, but it meant that the
greatest reverence is due to young persons.
Mr. N. I am sure, my dear, I show the utmost reverence to young
ersons—and to persons who are not so young. There is no harm in
ids, unless they butt your legs.
rs. N. Of course, you always take refuge in buffoonery.
Mr. N. No, sometimes I take refuge in bathing machines, as to-day,
when you dragged me out for a walk in spite of a sky that looked as
black as you did at my making an objection.
Mrs. N. We don’t come to the sea-side to stay in-doors, all day, but
to have the benefit of the fresh air. If you are so afraid of a little rain,
you should take a Macintosh and an umbrella.
Mr. N. You lent the first to MR. and the second to MRs. SNotchLEY
on Tuesday night, and neither have they had the grace to return.
Mrs. N. Did you expect MR. SNOTchLEY to come out in a day like
s
Mr. N. Well, you made me come out in a day like this, in fact this
very day.
Mrs. N. His habits are very different from yours. He has lived
with the superior classes, who remain at home when the weather is
unfavourable, or else go out in their carriages, while you have the
mercantile habits of a man who is tied to business, and must go out to
work like a clerk whether he likes it or not.
Mr. N. Yes, I’m very depraved and demoralised, I know, but one’s
balance at the banker's is none the worse for one's neglecting the
barometer.
Mrs. N. I am not reproaching you, HENRY, I am only stating a fact,
but you are so dreadfully thin-skinned that if I said the sun shone you
would find something to complain of.
Mr. N. I should, if you said so, just now,
plain of the absence of your usual veracity.
never to shine down here.
Mrs. N. I know what that means. Another hint that you want to
leave Brighton, and be back in your darling London.
Mr. M. (with dignity). I beg to say, MARIA, that I do not hint my
wishes, but signify them. When I £e. it time to end our sojourn by
#. Coast, I will say so, in the meantime do not cry out before you are
urt.
Mrs. N. Why, you have been as miserable as possible all the time we
have been here.
Mr. N. Thanks to your efforts, I have not been particularly com-
tº: but as I have made no complaint, I do not see that you need
make any.
Mrs. N. O. very well then, let us go back to-morrow.
Mr. N. We cannot do that, having to pay for the house until Wed-
mesday week. Besides (recovering himself) if you and the children are
enjoying yourselves, that is happiness for me.
Mrs. M. That’s right, scoff at domestic feeling. I cannot think, for
my part, what you married for.
Mr. M. Well, my dear, at this very long distance of time, I am really
unable to tell you at a moment's notice—and I do not observe around
me any particular aid to memory on the point. But I will endeavour
to recollect, and inform you on some other occasion. Have you finished
your lunch F
Mrs. N. Why?
* dear. I should com.
he sun appears to me
Mr. N. Because we might as well have the things taken away.
Mrs. N. What for P
Mr. N. Because somebody might call.
Mrs. N. Who?
Mr. N. How should, I know? Perhaps the polite and penitent
SNOTCHLEY might put his aristocracy into his pocket and bring home
my Macintosh.
Mrs. N. The fuss F. make about that miserable Macintosh is per-
fectly unbearable. I will walk over and fetch it home myself, and take
care how I lend any of your things again.
Mr. W. Don't walk, my dear, go in two cabs, for I’m sure one
wouldn't hold you in your present state of temper.
Mrs. N. I should like to know where you picked up that piece of
Vulgarity.
. Mr. W. Why, my love? Do you wish to go and look for another
piece like it *
Mrs. N. I quite shiver when I hear you talking to the children, and
I wait to hear what coarseness you are going to teach them next.
Mr. N. (sings). “With her shivery !. O, O, O,
The woman that couldn't get warm.”
Bless me, how the sea air freshens up one's voice. I could take the
chair at a Harmonic Meeting.
Mrs. N. (slowly). Yes, I . not dispute that.
Mr. N. I think there is one held somewhere near here.
mind to go, and take old S.Notchley with me.
Mrs. N. He ; to such a place |
Mr. N. l’ll bet you a pair of gloves he does, if I ask him.
Mrs. N. You would not presume to ask him.
Mr. N. You shall see. shall tell him that it is his duty, as an
instructor of youth, to be acquainted with all the snares with which
they might be tempted, and I’ll undertake to bring him home by mid-
night, slightly flavoured with Cavendish, which he will like as an
aristocratic baccy.
Mrs. N. Pray, pray, HENRY, do not talk in that manner. You
cannot imagine how offensive it is to my ears. Are you coming on the
Parade 2
Mr. M. The swells will not be there yet, my dear.
Mrs. N. You forget that we are not in Brighton, but have a long
distance to walk, thanks to your taking a house in this ridiculous
neighbourhood.
Mr. N. It was my fault, I suppose, that Eastbourne became dam-
gerous. It was my fault, I suppose, that Brighton was so full that we
couldn't get a house.
Mrs. N. Had we gone to Scarborough, as I begged that we might
do, we should have been in no danger, and we need not have hidden
ourselves in a hole like Hoye.
Mr. N. You are quite alliterative, MARIA, and I scorn to remind you
§: you utterly refused to go to Scarborough, when I offered to go
ere.
Mrs. N. Yes, after the scene you made, and the terrors you expressed
about the frightful expense, and then at the last minute pretended to
give way—of course no woman of ordinary spirit was going to be
treated like a child.
Mr. W. If l had treated you like a child, I should have taken you
just where I pleased, instead of coming to a place which I detest.
Mrs. N. Naturally you detest Brighton, because it is a place where
the upper classes come, and where a certain decorum and refinement
prevails, and you cannot lounge about the Parade at all hours in short
trousers, with a distorted wide-awake hat, a dirty old shooting jacket
with gaping pockets, and a clay pipe.
ji, N. That is a gross exaggeration, but that would be more sensible
than rigging oneself out like a Bond Street lounger, and parading up
and down for hours, smirking at acquaintances, staring at painted
women, and listening to a band playing tunes that you’d send a police-
man to stop if they were performed before your windows in town.
Mrs. N. You have no refinement, HENRY, and it is one of your
misfortunes. -
Mr. N. As you say, one of them. And what do you say to the paint
on the women's faces? -
Mrs. N. Are you going to accuse me of painting? ..
Mr. N. No, my dear, no, no (laughing). Even the lily, we read, may
be painted, but not, I think, the decidedly developed, not to say full-
blown rose.
Mrs. N. I make no answer to insults. -
Mr. N. I never offer any. Can't you take a joke?
Mrs. N. I delight in true wit, but not—
Mr. N. Not in wit whose essence is truth. But you won't come to
the point. What do you, a respectable British matron, say to walking
about among those animated paint-pots in pork-pie hats?
Mrs. N. Will you inform me how much worse it is for a woman to
lay vegetable rouge on her cheek, because it is pale, than ſor a man to
apply walnut pommade to his hair, because it is grey P
Mr. N. (floored). I wish you would leave my dressing-table alone.
I never can keep a single thing—somebody comes and takes it. i
didn’t know the hair º l bought was walnut pommade—I asked the

man for anything that was good for the hair, and I thought walnuts
were as harmless as anything else. What inconsistent nonsense you talk.
Mrs. N. I Hm. (Smiles.) -
[And they go on the Parade, and the humbled MR. NAGGLEToN is
quite civil and polite all the afternoon.
How, when, AND WHEREP
OR, THE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
AT four o'clock in the morning the happy
peasants on the top of the Rigi blow their
cow's-horns, and the miserable visitors,
who are just dropping gently into their
first sleep (for anything beyond a ſeverish
snooze has been utterly impracticable up
to this hour), will doubtless “blow those
horns” too, but nevertheless they will
grumble and get up to look at the Sunrise,
§ not because they like it, but because it is
§ the proper thing to do, and is in fact the
aim and end they’ve had in view all along.
Swaddled in rugs and blankets the
shivering Tourist appears in front of the
Hotel. As a rule the Sunrise is an utter
failure, though it ought not to be, consider-
ing how many times it has gone through
the part before. Like almost all theatrical
artistes, Glorious Apollo gets very care-
less. Stars are not free from this fault,
and the Sun is suffering from the force of
bad, example. We believe that he has
lately got into a very low Sun set. Unless
they’ve improved their arrangements with
new scenery, decorations, and appoint-
ments since we’ve been there, you must
not expect anything more than, a confused mass of clouds and mist,
and the only Rise you’re likely to see, is the rise which is pretty
certain to be taken out of the angry audience, who, however, if they are
free Britons, may use their privilege as such, and hiss the entire per-
formance. The cow-horn players actually have the impudence to go round
and ask for money from the assembled Tourists. Of course you will
simply say “that you never give to people in the streets,” and should
they artfully suggest that “you can give it, them in the House,” you
can ...; not to understand; or should, you feel yourself suffi-
ciently strong for the occasion, you can literally “take them in,” and
“pay them out” in a novel and unexpected manner.
he next movement is to get some breakfast, and then ask for your
bill. When you’ve got your bill, do not at once cut your stick, which
would be, what a low-bred woodman might call, a specimen of bill-
hooking it. -
The Young Jack and Jill having gone up the hill must now come
down; and here will be an
opportunity for Jack to
show his a-Jill-ity. It
takes about two hours and
a half to ascend the Rigi,
and it takes a quarter of
an hour to descend. There
are several modes of down-
ward progression. The
First is called:—
The Flying Fluteplayer.
Hold your alpenstock like
a flute, and whistle a tune,
if you can, to assist the
illusion. Stretch out one
leg, whichever you like;
march, quick time, don’t
stop playing the flute, and
away you go.—N.B. Paper
pens, ink, and the usua
forms for making your
will, can be obtained at
the Rigi Culm, and the
obliging landlord will, for a - -
consideration, be a witness to anything. The Second is termed—
The Wenturesome V. Sit down in the shape of a V, keeping your
hands disengaged, so as to save yourself from bumping against the sharp
nrºjections, which would otherwise annoy the unwary traveller. The
Third is known as–
The Cautious Crocodile, and is, perhaps, better adapted for the pro-
gress of invalids and elderly gentlemen than either of the above.
We advise the Tourist to descend on the Weggis side, where the lake
of Lucerne is. Here you are in the land of William TELL, as the
boatmen will tell you, and
where also you will be toll'd
for your boat. The traveller,
who understands German,
should take SchILLER's
Wilhelm Tell in his pocket;
and the traveller, who doesn't
understand it, will, if he take
it, keep it there.
Here you will see the giant
mountain, Mount Pilatus.
There is an old legend con-
cerning the derivation of
the name which everybody
knows, and according to
some, the title is only a cor-
ruption of Pileatus, which
means “Capped,” in allusion
to the ceremony always ob-
served by the superstitious
peasantry on looking in that
direction. Be the derivation
from the story of Pilatus, or
- - - the fact of being Pileatus,
one thing is certain, that, as the mountain can always give certain
prophetic signs of a coming storm, surer even than those of ADMIRAL
FitzRoy, he, the mountain,
not the Admiral, may be
considered as the safest
Pilot on the lake.
Land at Lucerne, and
heartily admire the memo-
rial Lion. Think of SIR
EDw1N LANDSEER, the
Nelson Column, Squirts
of Trafalgar Square, the
Lowther Arcade, and re-
joice in your proud birth-
right.
Visit Tell's Chapel on
the lake; then, to his me-
mory drink with spirit in
the waters of freedom at
Grütli; but be cautious
as to the amount of spirit
mixed with the waters,
lest, in keeping the pa.
triot's memory. you lose
your own. There have
been fierce disputes as to
the existence of TELL,
who is, some captious prigs assert, a Swiss Mrs. Harris.º. The same
story, they urge, was told of one Toko in Denmark. It is within our
province to set them right. The story of the Danish gentleman was
promulgated by the friends of Gessler, the oppressive Governor, who,
as we all know, got Toko from Tell. Hence the mistake.
The Tourist in Switzerland who wishes always to he a dandy in dress,
should be provided with MURRAY's invaluable Handbookyor Bucks.
Now then let us get to Thun, and if we have time, visit Interlachen,
which will bring us to the last scene of all that will end this strange
adventurous history.

Sºs Follet, under the head of
“Fashions for November,” ap-
pears fit, to have rather been
published under that of “Sport-
ing Intelligence:”
“A band of the same width as the
ttes on the skirtis put on the body,
ike a square berthe in front, and

To be sure, the rider of a horse
º for the Derby...could
hardly be spoken of as a “jockey
behind.” There is, however, a
description of race in which the
competing quadrupeds are all
ridden on the crupper, and to this
class of animals perhaps we must

AIR-" The Ram of Derby."
As I was sailing the Mersey
I saw a wonderful Ram,
THE RAM OF LIVERPOOL.
Which the people there they told me
Had frightened Uncle SAM.
Thinks I, it is no wonder
For the Ram's as long as a street,
And his head is covered with iron .
To smash whatever it meet.
And out of the small of his back, Sir,
Is sticking a roaring flue, ...
And under his terrible stern, Sir,
Is no end of an awful screw.
And a Ram we know is addicted
To rushing about in play," ...
And it might be a wiry time, Sir,
For whatever got into his way.
They said he was going to Egypt,
At least so his owner states,
But suppose he mistook the turning,
And made for Davis's straits.

of carrying a jockey behind. .
Le Follet has also the ensuing
remark about bonnets:-
“Many of them have soft crowns,
although these are not suited to the
style in which the hair is now worn.”
Begging pardon, of a lady for contradicting her, we must tell the Editress of Le Follet
- ãº. soft crowns—within or under them—are
particularly well suited to the fantastic style in which the hair is now worn.
I think that an honest drover
Might prove where he'd made a sale,
And not come smoothing us over
With a cock and a bullish tale.
And I think that Policeman Russell,
Who to keep the peace is bound,
Has used a wise discretion
In clapping the Ram in the Pound.
A SHREWSBURY CAKE.
MR. DAVID, MAsson's attention is respectfully solicited to the fol. -
lowing extract from the Shrewsbury Chronicle.
Stop, though. We must explain. -
No, on second thoughts, we will put it another way. MR. MAssoN
will have the kindness to read these two verses:—
“In a purer clime
My being fills with rapture; waves of thought
Roll in upon my spirit ; streams sublime
Break over me unsought.
Give me now my lyre 1
I feel the stirrings of a gift divine,
Within my bosom glows unearthly fire,
Lit by no skill of mine.”
They are preceded, in the complete poem, by nine more verses, which
Mr. Punch does not quote, because they touch upon matters to which
he never adverts lightly. -
Very well. Now, hear what the Salopian oracle has to say upon the
poem:-
“These lines were composed by the celebrated John MILºron, a short time before
This death; but, strange to say, they have not been reprinted in any modern edition
of . wºrks, and therefore are not much known. They are worthy of his glorious
genius.
Now, as MR. DAVID MAsson is supposed, and with reason, to be
more intimately acquainted, with the writings of MR. John MILTON
than is any other author of the age, it is remarkable that the first men:
tioned MR. M. should never have referred to this poem by the second
mentioned MR. M. Especially as the Shrewsbury Chronicle gives a
certificate that the verses are worthy of MR. MILTON’s “glorious
genus.
..When MR. MAsson shall have been sufficiently humbled by the
discovery that the Shrewsbury Chronicle knows more ahout Milton
than he does, and indeed knows so much, as to be able to gauge the
genius of a poet whose genius is not usually thought to be easily gauged,
*: will whisper something to him, for his comfort, in our very smallest
ype.
..º.º.º.:4:::::::::::iº nºw rule” tº
Still, Mr. Punch begs to cling, with the tenacity of a scared limpet,
to the dogma of critical infallibility.
QUERY-If you give two persons a seat in a cornfield, can this pro-
ceeding be called “setting them by the ears?”
A FOUL WORD FOR THE FAIR SEX.
CHIVALRous MR. PUNCH,
IT is with mingled feelings of horror and disgust that I would
bring to your attention one of the most brutal outrages on women that
have ever yet been perpetrated. Icite it from an article in the Scotsman,
which treats of the admission of the fair sex to the medical profession,
and in so doin º: vent to a few vinegarish remarks upon a paper
which was read by a certain MR. BRown, at the Social Science Congress
which was held a short while since." This gentleman-or gorilla, I
incline rather to call him-described the social status and distinction of
the sexes in language which it must have been most horrible to hear, if
this summary in the Scotsman be a credible report:—
“Man is made for work; his is the strong arm to expel poverty, to bring comfort
to the door. Woman is made, in common with bitter beer and tobacco, to urge him
to exertion, to soothe him in defeat."
“Bitter beer and tobacco !” ſaugh! what a vile simile! Breathes
there a man with soul so dead as to talk of Lovely Woman in the same
breath with such things—such low, common, nasty, noisome, vulgar,
bestial things—as bitter beer and tobacco Sir, surely such a senti.
ment could never have been emitted at the Social Science Congress. Its
president, Lord BROUGHAM, has ever been a devoted admirer of the
ladies, and would not have suffered such an insult to be offered to them.
So I cannot but presume it was the Scotsman that invented the vile
words which it puts into the mouth of MR. BRown: and instead of
begging you to call upon that gentleman to kick him for the outrage
(which, as champion of the ladies, it would be the privilege of Mr.
Punch to do), I would ask of you to pitch into the scribbler in the
Scotsman, and tell him—or it may be her, for I hear there are she-scrib-
blers in these degenerate days—that writers should take care, when
they epitomise a speech, not to weaken its effect by strong language of
their own.
I am, Sir, your, and the dear creatures,
Most sincere admirer and ever humble servant,
Beau Nash Buildings, Monday. ALBANY FITz-BRUMMELL.
P.S. As for Woman, Lovely Woman, being ever made a Doctor–
ugh Judy forbid such profanation of her sex. For only just consider,
Sir. How could one whisper a soft nothing to an ear that had been
hardened by the chaff of medical students, and the language of the
schools: or how could one press, tenderly the fingers which had just
been spreading a big blister, or dispensing a black dose?

THE LATEST THING IN IMPUDENCE.
* and as I shall be late, I 'll take Master's Latch Key.”
IMPENDING SACRILEGE,
... It is intended to remove from Westminster Abbey ſhe ashes of the
illustrious dead that rest within the precincts of that venerable edifice,
and re-inter them at Kensal Green. - - - -
... The foregoing announcement is one which, if there were any truth in
it, would astonish the natives, who owe allegiance to QUEEN VICTORIA,
considerably; and would also somewhat amaze foreigners, even those
who account us capable of any brutality. -
What, then, will the British Public, and other Publics wherever there
are any, and where there are none, what will Potentates and Princes
say to the annexed statement extracted from the columns of a contem-
porary 2–
“THE DESECRATION of BUNHILL-FIELDs BURIAL-ground.—This ground formed
one of the three great fields originally belonging to the Manor of Finsbury Farm,
and the lease for 1,000 years, now held by the Corporation, will expire in 1867, when
the property reverts to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The burial-ground, since
the year 1664, has been the great cemetery for Nonconformists, and here rest the
bones of John BUNYAN, the author of Pilgrim's Progress: GEoRGE Fox, the founder
of the Society of Friends; DR. DANIEL WILLIAMs, founder of the library in Redcross
Street; DANIEL DEFoE, author of Robinson Crusoe, DR. Isaac WATTs; Joseph
RITson, the antiquary; THoMAs Stothard, R.A.; PATRick Colquhoun, LL.D.
author of Our System of Police, and other well-known literary men, besides those of
the Buxtons, Sollys, TRAvers, FullkRs, Roberts, Morleys, Gibsons, MAITLANDs,
and other great dissenting families. . On the ground coming into the possession of
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, it is intended to remove the human remains lying
there, and let the ground on building leases.”
It is very likely that all that is mortal of John BUNYAN, except a
very small quantity of phosphate of lime, has evaporated into thin air.
But if any dust is of any consequence, some respect is, owing to that of
the most famous JACK the Giant Killer, who conquered Giant Doubt
and Giant Despair, and bequeathed the story of his victory to ages.
And what less can be said of the relics of that eternal benefactor to boy-
hood who created Robinson Crusoe, and survived the satire of Pope?
What's in a name, if the name of WATTs, and the Logic which has
memorised it, and the Psalmody which has consecrated it, cannot obtain
consideration for his grave? Is there no sanctity in the tomb of
SroTBARD, a painter—and not also a plumber and glazier?
We cannot be sure that the verses inscribed on ShakspeaRE's monu-
ment, deprecating the disturbance of his bones, and said to have been
written by himselſ, were really composed by the parish clerk. There is
reason, therefore, to suppose that the greatest of mankind attached some
importance to the chrysalis-shell whence the butterfly, had flown. His
judgment, coinciding with the common sentiment of humanity, should
give us pause in the idea, could we entertain it, of dislodging the residue
of great spirits, from Poet's Corner....The dust of genius, too,
consecrated the burial-ground of Bunhill Fields. -
. However, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, as such, will not recog- ||
mise that consecration, which is all that the Dissenters' cemetery has.
It is for the Dissenters themselves, in the first place, to care for the
conservation of the sepulchres of their fathers. It has been suggested
that they should devote a portion of their large Bicentenary Memorial.
Fund to the purchase of the freehold. They will be helped by many
who, regardless of the creed, respect the memory, of the giſted, the
learned, the venerable if quaint and prim, and rather pigheaded old
Nonconformists. ... Iºke, other intramural cemeteries, let the burial-
ground of Bunhill Fields be converted into a garden, in which the
remembrance of those whose actions “smell sweet and blossom in the
dust” shall be graced with the suitable emblems of trees and flowers. a

0 THE EMBARRASSED.—There are thousands of Tories who have
long struggled against the force of Liberal opinion, but few are aware that the
winning seats here and there only means that the Conservative agents have been
cleverer or perhaps less scrupulous than their antagonists, and that a general elec-
tion would replace the Tories in a hole, without their leaders being Gazetted as
Ministers. Money advanced for bribery is thrown away. Nor can a valuable and
pular Minister be slandered out of office, or tripped up by an attorney's bag. For

JAMEs. “No, Sir / Why, Sir, those will belong to old Mr. Shortshanks, who went

JACK RUSSELL’S APOLOGY TO JOHN BULL.
If you please, Sir, I’m not such a sneak, as you may think. It’s true I sold
HUDson; but it was his own fault, for not looking out sharper when he knew he
had to deal with me. But as to threatening anybody that I would punch their
heads, and then backing out when it came to the point, I say I didn't. It’s true I
told GoRTschakoff that it was a shame to bully the Poles, but I didn't say that
we would pitch into the Russians unless they left off: on the contrary, I holloaed
ºut aloud several times before the whole school that we weren't going to make a
fight of it. And now, you see, I was right. Here you have NapoleoN owning
that he shouldn't like to have a row with ALExANDER, who stood by him in that
Nice business and Savoy affair. Hogh: "I should think so one good turn
deserves another. Who was it that hung back and stopped short in 1856, just
when we wanted to go in and double Russia up? If he hadn't prevented us then,
we should have given the Muscovites a hiding that would have lasted them long
enough, and you wouldn't have had those fellows playing the game they’re up to
now, I know.
Fight! Hogh! I should like to know how we are to, if we are ever so game.
Where can we get to do it? In what field? Hohenzollers is on the other
side, and so is HAPsburg, I’ll be bound, if the truth was known. Catch them
letting us through their grounds! If we could trust Napoleon, to be sure, we
might, force our way; but we can’t. It be fought, he’d fight for another Idea, as
he calls it, like that Nice idea and the idea of Savoy, that I mentioned just now.
Oly, yes!. I dare say! Walker.
It's all very well for him to talk of a Congress, so as to settle all differences by
umpires. Isuppose CoBDEN put him up to that motion. It’s all very fine, but it
ºn't new ; it's as old as the Peace Society, and older. And when the umpires
haye decided, what then? Suppose Russia says, "Ishan’,” who is to make her?
I know very well that if we let the Russians go on bullying us in the way they
º, they are likely to end by getting to bully the whole world. It is only a ques.
In one of the recent repulses of the Federals, we read
that “they retreated to Liberty.” This is no new move:
ment, for ever since the war began, we, must say. that all
their steps have been backward ones in that direction. Of
course, they took possession of the town, ſor we all know
what capital good hands the Yankees are in taking a
tiºn of time, and of gunpowder and steam. But it isn't my fault they weren’t
kiboshed wiſe gunpo y 1ault they
n they ought to have been; it’s that Napoleon's fault, as I said
before, for f -
reasons of his own, which he now owns (and we know
what they were), we might have gone on and whopped
those fellows, and licked 'em into the middle of next
century, and rid the civilised world from all fear of them
for ever, so long. But now the chance has gone by, and
all that’s left for us chaps is to look out for our own
cheek. So I want to know what I could have said or
done more than what I have in answer to GoRTschakoff?
And, as far as that goes, at any rate I hope you’ll allow
that I’m neither such a muff nor such a humbug as I’ve
been called.
A QUEER FELLOW'S CAROL.

WE've all had a jolly good dinner?
It only comes round once a year;
The outer man’s warmed by the inner,
Choke-full of the best of good cheer.
How pleasant this here merry making
Is arter hard labour and toil!
Such a banquet as we’ve been º
Served up in host WALKER's best style!
Such a banquet, &c.
Roast beef, prime, and no two opinions,
Leg of mutton and trimmings thereto,
Roast goose, apple sauce, sage and inions,
Suckin' pig, cowheel, tripe, Irish slew,
And biled leg of pork and pease-puddun,
Plum puddun, and likewise mince pi

Which nobody, sure, can deny.

The liquors, the malt and the spirits,
They all was the best of the kind,
Ineedn't say more of their merits, , ,
Which them as don't see must be blind,
Our brother here keeps a good cellar,
Him, therefore, I’ll name for a toast,
For he is a jolly good feller,
And so here’s the health of our Host.
For he is, &c.
Here’s the health of our Doctor and Lawyer,
Who’ve honoured our meetin to day,
The Sawbones I calls a top-sawyer,

And as for our legal adviser,
To give that same Party his due,
There can't he a better, nor wiser,
Here's health and long life to the two.
There can’t be, &c.
Here’s the health of our worthy Collector,
What raises the funds of our club:
'Tis true, says some grumblin objector,

Here’s a health unto all absent brothers,
We deeply regrets they ain't here;
But then there’s the more for us others,

Premier came to the Palace by appointment with the document, he was
informed that His Serene Highness had gone to the play.
“Bother the play,” said the statesman, sotto voce. “Drive to the
theatre, can’t you?” he added, angrily, to his coachman, as if it were
the poor man's fault that his Sovereign was a frivolous personage.
“The Coachman showed that he could drive to the theatre, and did.
“Wait,” said the Premier, going up-stairs in no very good temper.
“Boxkeeper!!” - -

here, isn’t he?”
“Yes, Excellency.”
“Very well, open the door.”
“The door of the royal box, Excellency?”
“What other door do you think I mean, you great owl?” said the
Premier, striding to the box of his master.
The boxkeeper, in some trepidation, opened the door a very little
way, so little that if the Premier had been as thin as the late MR.
WILLIAM PITT, he could not have gone through.
“I have told you half-a-dozen times I don’t want any refreshments,”
roared a voice from within. -
“I’m not bringing you any, you idiot,” muttered the Premier, and
then entered with a profound bow.
“O, it’s you,” said His Serene Highness, good naturedly. “I’m
glad you’ve come. Here’s such a capital scene going on. That chap
hiding in the cupboard is Bobblewitz, and he thinks the officer, there,
Guttleburg, has come after his niece, but the fact is he wants a hamper of
sausage that has been delivered by mistake, and it is in that very
cupboard. I’ll bet you he’ll smell it out—you’re just in luck. Ha!
ha! Ital hal”
“I should not have ventured to intrude upon your Highness's intel-
lectual recreations,” said the Minister, “but the Message--"
“Bother the Message, let’s see about the Sausage,” said his High-
ness. “Ha! haſ Didn’t I say so? He sniffs if, and now he’ll discover
Bobblewitz. No, stop, here comes the girl, Magdalen...That stops him.
Isn’t she pretty, eh?”
“I am no great judge of female beauty, your Highness, but she
seems to me to be fat and badly painted. But if your Highness would
deign to accord me a moment or two, I need not interfere again with
your admiration of the young—or middle-aged person.”
“Well, what is it?” said his Highness, still keeping his lorg.nette on
Magdalen. “She’s not more than six-and-twenty, I tell you.”
“The Message is ready, and the Parliament is anxious to depart.
Your Highness has only to signify your assent to this document——”
4- Sº, Bobblewitz is pinching her arm, as a sign not to leave the
r00m.
“His Serene Highness is

“Which has been framed exactly in conformity with your Highness's
instructions.”
“That was a good scream, wasn’t it?” -
“Except in reference to the revenue, which cannot be described as
perfectly flourishing.”
“Now, you see, Guttleburg must make love to her, to account for
his presence in the house.” - -
“And we must give the promise to revise the railway taxation.”
“Eh! That was a good slap in the face she gave him. I think that
was given in real earnest. Perhaps there’s some row between them–
couldn't you go round and find out from some of the ballet-girls?”
“And the Minister of Religion must be reſerred to as an invaluable
official, to justify the demand for increased salary.”
“My eye he’s kneeling, and has stuck his spur into himself. O,
this is one of the best comedies I ever saw.”
“Those are the only alterations, your Highness, and I venture to
think that you will approve of them.”
“How he keeps rubbing himself. I wonder whether those spurs are
really pointed, or whether it’s only fun.” -
“I may assume your Highness's approval, and deliver the Message?”
said the Minister, rising.
“Eh, sit still. I swear I have not heard one word that you’ve been
saying...Can't you hold your tongue till the play is over.”
“In that case the Deputies will lose the night train, your Highness,
and they have had a long session.”
“I tell you what, Baron,” said the Elector, getting angry, “it is
not only impertinent but disloyal to come bothering me in this manner.
Is a theatre a place for such important business?”
“Your Highness did me the honour to command my attendance at
the Palace, and then not to be there to receive me.”
“I suppose I may go to the theatre if I like? When I made the
appointment I hadn't seen the play bill, and I didn’t know that Soldiers
and Sausages was to be played. It was your business to have informed

“I beg leave to place my portfolio in your Serene Highness's hands,”
said the Minister, bowing coldly, “and trust that my successor will be
better aware of the duties of a statesman.”
“Now then, there you go, flying out like gunpowder because one
just speaks to you, and here we are missing no end of fun. Here, por-
cupine that you are, give us hold of the paper, What a beastly hand-
writing, I suppose it’s that stiff-backed ass, PUMPLEBLUESKIN’s.”
“My nephew may not have all the graces of a courtier, your High-
ness, but he is a faithful servant of yours.”
“He looks like a servant out of livery. Well, as far as I can read it,
the thing seems all right. Stop, what’s that word?”
“Which, Highness?”
“That! Why, it’s ‘constitutional.” How dare you put such a
word into my mouth f I will not sanction the Message, and you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.”
“If your Highness will look at the context—”
“But I won’t, and I don't see any context. Where’s the context—
do you mean the green ribbon—what’s that got to do with it?” a
* I mean the sense of the passage, Highness.”
“There’s no sense in the passage, and you just go out into the
passage and scratch the word out, or 1 won't prorogue.” -
“I undertake to do so, Highness. With that correction, may I
deliver the document in P’”
His Serene Highness was going to refuse, but at this moment the
fair Magdalen sat down to take off her shoe ſor the further castigation
of her unwelcome lover, and the Sovereign impatiently signed to his
Prime Minister to be off.
So the lover was slapped and the Message delivered, and the Parlia-
ment of Hesse-Cassel prorogued., And this is the way the Germans
submit to be governed—the great Germans who claim a voice in the
affairs of Europe.
THE SCOTCH DISTEMPER.
DID you ever happen to consider how it is that a certain subject of
raillery against the Scotch, once popular, is now never alluded to, even
by the most prejudiced of the vulgar? The mention of the Caledonian
Violin, as extant in these days, would be an anachronism. A cutaneous
disease, for which the common name of that instrument was a euphe-
mism, has ceased to be peculiarly endemic in North Britain. This is
not a matter for unmingled rejoicing. The eruption, driven in, has
produced a constitutional disease, much aggravated by the brimstone
which its treatment had introduced into the system. Sabbatarianism is
the national complaint of Scotland repelled.

JUDICIOUS V. JUDICIAL SEPARATIONS.
We learn with sorrow that the recent appointment of a Judge of the
Matrimonial and Divorce Court, has caused severe, though, silent dis-
satisfaction to many amiable members of society. Their objection is
one not of degree but of kind. More learning, greater experience
higher ability were not required. It had, however been | hoped
that time would have taught our Legislators wisdom, and that two
Judges would have been appointed—one distinguished by a black cap
and confining his attention to scenes of tragical interest between
Othello and Desdemona; the other wearing ringlets or braids at dis-
cretion, and bestowing her liveliest sympathy on petitions for a judicious
separation. That such a division of }. would have been exceedingly
popular, a few extracts from the numerous communications we have
received in answer to our inquiries, will prove beyond all possibility of
dispute.
From LADY MANETER.
“While entertaining no personal objection to the Judge recently
appointed, LADY MANETER is notwithstanding decidedly of opinion
that ſeminine claims to juridical honours, have been culpably disre-
garded. Acts of cruelty, which constitute, if LADY MANETER is not
mistaken, the broadest tº: for a separation of the Eagle from 1be
Dove, can only be dealt with judiciously by women of enlightened minds.
ls not smoking in a drawing-room or any apartment consecrated by
muslin curtains most barbarous cruelty? i. not dulness of perception,
when new ſurniture, dress, equipage, &c., &c., are urgently demanded,
most unpardonable cruelty? Is not an insane antagonism to crinoline
most revolting cruelty? LADY MANETER pauses for a reply, not
doubting that some masculine upholder of existing abuses, with brazen
tffrontery, will rise and loudly answer–No.”
From the Misses ARTAxeRxEs, Minerva Lodge, College for Young Ladies.
“The Misses ARTAxERxes do not object to the recent appointment
in toto, but they do think that it would be extremely desirable to have
two assessors to counsel and advise the presiding! Judge in the satis-
factory discharge of his arduous functions. The Misses A. are not
cognisant of any objections having been made to the innovation sug-
gested, or before expatiating fully on this topic, they would dispose of
ihem seriatim. In the Admiralty Court it is perfectly well understood,
that the elder Brethren of the #. House render essential service
where wrecks, merely of ships, not of happiness, are involved. The
MIsses ARTAxeRxes opine |. the elder Sisters of the same establish:
ment, would be fit and proper persons to sit on the judicial Bench, and
support the Judge in delivering his dictum, who otherwise might sink
beneath the awful responsibility, which all not steeled to human suf-
fering must experience, while painfully striving to dissect secundum
attem the matrimonial knot.”
From MRs. HUPPER KRUST.
“MR. HuPPER, KRUST having presented his petition for a separation
on account of his having been locked out by my orders at a quarter past
eleven (PM.), I shall reserve my judgment on the question of Man's
judicial capacity, until the result º this application is known. Mean:
while, I should like to have some information respecting the habits of
Judges in general. If they are addicted to carrying latch-keys of their
own, I cannot *". at their hands when dealing with mine,
over which MR. II. K. never had, and never shall have, any power,
disposition or control.” .
| From the HoNour ABLE AUGUSTA EDGE-BONE.
“You ask if I approve of the recent appointment. Absurd." I approve
of no appointment. The question. I would put is simply this:... What
necessity is there for any such Tribunal at all? If a monster like that
created by FRANKENstEIN united to a Being of angelic disposition,
murmurs at being called upon to follow her with tremulous admiration,
his ingratitude admits of no defence. By such insensibility the bond of
union is cancelled to all intents and purposes—Could { descend to
petition a Court of vulgar wigs º powder; Oh rising with
imperial scorn, an EDGE-Box E would wave the marital incumbrance
there and then for ever into vacant air!”
From HANNAH HugLEY.
“i don't c y a pure Servent shoodn't Hav hirpinyons hupon publik

From Miss TWITHEM.
on ermine robes and tippets, should endeavour to pass themselves off
for elderly ladies, and yet pretend to be indignant, when a real lady
volunteers to relieve them of their disagreeable duties.”
From FANNY LITTLEPLOT.
“IN reply to your note, desiring my opinion, on a purely legal
question, I have no hesitation in saying that l wish sincerely, my dear
LORD PALMERsroN would invest me with judicial authority. Nothing
would please me so much as to have a set of dissatisfied people with
sour looks, bothering meſrom morning till night to redress iheir imagi-
nary grievances. What would I do? Listen. I would sentence
every pair of wranglers, whether senior or junior, to be confined in a
ºnitentiary, where they should be separated only by a glass partition.
There they should remain for six weeks contemplating each other's
wretchedness until they became so weary of it, that they would petition
he Court out of charity, to fit up the partition with folding-doors.
That would be my rule. I shouldn't study to make it nisi, to suit silly
people's tastes, and think those are very much to blame whose rules
are not as absolute as mine would be.”
We have a hundred more opinions in our portfolio, but we have
quoted enough. In conclusion we strongly recommend Miss LITTLE-
Plot's disciplinary process to our Law Reformers. A Court of Recon:
ciliation similar to that, which she so graphically describes, would
furnish a cheap cement for family jars, and please all lovers of social
harmony. Then we might witness such a phenomenon as never before
was known in horticulture... Fancy the apple of discord cast upon a
BARos WILDE, and after a little coaxing, producing a very sweet pair!
AN INTEMPERATE YANKEE WINTER.
According to the Worth American, the HoN. H. WINTER DAvis, of
Baltimore, at a Union Mass Meeting in Philadelphia lately, made a
speech, the conclusion of which may be interesting to the friends of the
Federals, in this country. After threatenings and slaughter breathed
against France, the WINTER of Yankee discontent belched the following
menace against ourselves:–
“And if ADMIRAL DuPont should live, he hoped to see his bombshells bursting
over the dome of St. Paul's, and the ruins of London Bridge tumbling into the
stream below."
When we call this a menace directed against ourselves, we mean our-
selves particularly. If St. Paul's is to be shelled, the bombs that are
to burst, over it being of course filled with Greek Fire, danger will
necessarily accrue to 85, Fleet Street. For your own, office is in
jeopardy, when the shop next door is burning, which it very soon
would be in the case supposed. This consideration, however, ought to
touch our neighbour and contemporary the Morning Starfish, as well as
us; for fire is no respecter of persons, even if it is the Greek fire of an
alien enemy with whom persons sympathise. A word to the wise, is
sufficient; though to be sure that is no reason for brevity in addressing
the Morning Starfish.
DERIVATION.

THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE.
His MAJESTY the Elected of the Millions. Enter to him, DR. PUNCH.
Dr. Punch. I have the honour to wish your Majesty a good morning.
. I trust that Her Majesty is in the best health and spirits. I hope that
the Imperial Prince is all that the fondest parents could desire.
The Emperor. Sit down, Doctor, and don’t be loquacious. I hate
too much talk.
Dr. P. In that hate, your Majesty, is—forgive me—part of the secret
of your people's admiration. A Frenchman thinks it a miracle that
any one should be able to hold his tongue.
The Emp. There may be something in that. Anyhow, hold yours.
J)r. P. I ºt your Majesty did me the honour of sending for me.
The Emp. I did. But I want you to listen.
Dr. P. If I thought I should hear any good of myself, Sire, I would
listen with pleasure. -
The Emp. If you will not, be silent, Doctor, I will communicate
with you through my new talking Minister.
Dr. P. I am dumb, Sire, in presence of that menace." -
The Emp. I have invited the Sovereigns of Europe to a Congress,
that we may settle all our troubles and quarrels by Arbitration.
Dr. P. And what, in the name of all that is reasonable and humane,
Sire, have I been preaching to you—I, Doctor PUNCH-for the last ten
years? What, in fact, have I been preaching to all the Sovereigns, and
Emperors, and Presidents ever since I mounted the pulpit in 1841°
The Emp. Confound {". are you going to favour me with a verbal
re-issue of all your back volumes |
Dr. P. No, Sire, hut I insist upon saying that I am glad and proud
to see the greatest King of the Earth—you will observe the masculine
gender in my observation—
The Emp. Well, well, everybody knows your chivalrous loyalty to
your own admirable Sovereign-get on.
Dr. P. Proud to see the greatest King of the Earth at length con-
verted to the faith which I have been preaching for twenty years;
namely, that war, except in self-defence, is a crime and a blunder.
The Emp. All wars are in self-defence.
Dr. P. That in Mexico, Sire, for instance? I did not hear that the
Mexicans were marching on Normandy, or even on Cayenne, which is
nearer to them, but your Majesty is perhaps better informed.
The Emp, Don't you talk cant. All wars are in self-defence. Are
you not defending yourselves against Japan? Have you not just de-
stroyed an entire city which—
Dr. P. Sire, we were not talking of Japan, and I believe that EARL
RussELL will have explanations to offer which will be entirely satis-
factory to—to parties without prejudice. But that is not the point.
have been proclaiming with all my might, for nearly, half a century,
that the Captains Tongue and Penought to do the work which barba-
rism intrusted to Captain Sword, and I am rejoiced to have made a
convert of the master of 600,000 soldiers.
The Emp, Haye you done? -
Dr. P. No, Sire; I have only just begun. And then, Sire, how
truly wise it is in you, as Emperor of France. to have taken this course.
Study to be quiet; and, as my friend EARL Russell says, Rest and be
thankful. You have no Constitution— -
The Emp. I’ll hunt with you, shoot with you, dine with you, -come,
I’ll even sit out a melodrama in eleven acts with you, for a thousand
napoleons. Or make it sovereigns.
Dr. P. Sire, could you suspect me of a personal reference? I mean
that you, as France, have no Constitution, and therefore cannot afford
to racket about as sturdy MRs. BRITANNIA can do. The quieter the
better, and as EMPEROR of FRANCE-
The Emp. “Of the French,” it says on the coins.
Dr. P. But the Parisians are Frenchmen, Sire, I have heard; and if
proclivities are to be judged by elections—
The Emp. Don't remind me of that infernal Duke of Defeats.

Paris I dare say a good many Frenchmen, especially those in the com-
mercial and hotel line, will be convinced that their patrotism was a

The Emp. Well, am I to have a Congress? That’s what I sent for

A Most gratifying evidence of progress, in Turkey is afforded by the
subjoined advertisement, extracted from the Terjuman Ahval, a journal
published at Constantinople:–
“Headaches, toothaches, lumbago, eye-sores, fever, &c., cured by a celebrated
divine just arrived from Asia Minor, by breathing on the patient and by charms.
Address, &c.
The Mussulmans are even with the British Aristocracy in medical
enlightenment. There are also in this capital advertising Mesmerists,
though they do not include any clergymen of the Church of England,
that we know of; and DR. CUMMING himself has never yet put forth
such pretensions, as those which are asserted by the “Celebrated
Divine” of the Mahometan persuasion at Stamboul, where he has “just
arrived from Asia Minor.” The “Clergyman of Cambridge University”
who offered to cure people of nervous and mental complaints, “from
benevolence rather than gain,” has long since departed to that clime
where quacks no longer advertise, and his cassock has fallen on no
successor in orders. -
It is true the Turks have no HollowAY, whose pills and ointment
(the pills, we suppose, rubbed in behind the ears, and the ointment
taken night and morning on toast) cure eruptive ſevers and small-pox.
They have no MoRIsoN, who, being dead, yet cureth all diseases by his
Universal Vegetable Medicine, which is, as we all know, an effectual
substitute for vaccination. And, above all, they have no Government
which endorses the advertisements of HollowAY, and MoRIsoN, and
QLD PARR, and KAYe's WoltsDELL, and Dixon, and Hooper, and all
the other nostrum vendors whose patent medicines yield a tribute
which is inodorous to the nostrils of the CHANCELLOR OF THE
Exchequer.
If, the ſortunes of Professor, HollowAY and his, brotherhood
should ever turn Turk with them, let them change with their fortunes,
turn Turks too, and set up at Constantinople, where the celebrity of
the Divine who has just arrived from Asia Minor to practise on the
Faithful is an assurance that they will prosper.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
DEAR PUNCH,
You have seen King Lear, but have you seen, Queen Leah?
for a queen she clearly is in her command over her audience, and the
power wherewith she sways them to a sympathy with her. If you have
not, go at once and take a stall and see her, and you will come away as
I did and own yourself her subject, though, thanks to the insufferable
badness of the drama, not till the fifth act will your allegiance be con-
essed.
Pray don’t fear from this beginning that I am going to let my admi-
ration run, away with me. Miss BATEMAN has been puffed and
pamphleted enough, and I have little wish to be regarded as her butter-
man. A young actress who aspires to queen it on the boards will
always have a court of foolish flatterers about her, and much damage
may be done her by their overflyw of praise. Still, without predicting
that Miss BATexA.N will surpass a RAchelor a SIDDoss, I am not
aſraid to say, that I think she has great talent, and there is the more
promise of her proving a great actress that in spite of all the schooling
with which she has been trained, she is natural and simple in producing
her effects. As we have spoken of her elsewhere, we will now turn to
clever Monsieu R FecuteR, who has re-opened the Lyceum, and the town
is ringing with his Bel Demonio—a Bel whereof I hardly know a critic
but has acted as a clapper. I am sorry I can't lenda'hand in this
applauding peal. Not that I object to the way the Bel is cast, but
that, to my thinking, it is not of good metal. Metaphor apart, the
piece is all bombast and bustle, and, unlike the Duke's Motto, gives no
whit of scope for acting. Now, when one has an actor so good as
M. Fechtes, one hates to see his talent wasted by his taking a bad
part; and his part in the new play is all bosh and bravado, and, except-
ing one short love-scene, has nothing that calls forth his careful
subtlety and skill. The piece is chokeful of "sensations,” and abounds
in hot pursuits and periious, escapes; but its misty plot is made the
more incomprehensible by being served up in short spasms, with
nothing to connect them, and just as you begin to take some little
interest in the bustle of the story, down comes the act-drop and
knocks it clean out of your head...The only thing, in fact, that really
pleased me in the play was to see the skill with which it has been put
upon the new stage. How many hundred thousands have been ſaid
out since last summer upon this new piece of mechanism I leave
dramatic statisticians to calculate and state; but, lavish as it has been,
I have no doubt the expenditure will bear abundant Fº for every
playgoer in London ought to go to the Lyceum, if it be only to
applaud some of the stage reforms there introduced. Farewell to the
old foot-lights, which are now sunk out of sight; and farewell to the
old dingy, dusty, dismal, dirty skies that used to dangle down eternally
in front, no matter if the scene were a dungeon or a drawing-room, or any.
where in nature where a sky could not be seen"; and farewell to the foot-
men who moved the chairs and tables at the sº of the scenes, and
were made nervous in so doing by the plaudits of the Gods; and fare-
well to the soapless shirt-sleeves of the carpenters, which have always
hitherto been terribly conspicuous in the shifting of a scene, and have
destroyed so much illusion in so many a fairy piece. Thanks to common
sense and men like MonstEUR FECHTER and MR. WEBSTER, the stage
is being cleared from many an old nuisance and conventional absurdity,
and improved in every way that gives a life-look to a scene. I only
hope M. FechTER's stage improvements will not blind him to the fact
that, in spite of the sensationists, there are still playgoers among us
who like to see good acting even better than good scenery, and care
more for the moulding than the mounting of a play. When he sees
this he, perhaps, will, look a whit more sharply at the new pieces sub-
mitted to him; and if he turns his eyes up for a happy inspiration, he
may see upon his ceiling the names of some old dramatists who are
worthy to be taken down and put upon his stage.
. With every wish for his well-doing, and for that of all good actors, I
sign myself, as heretofore, my dear Punch, ONE who PAYs.
P.S. In my next I hope to speak of MR. BALPE's new opera, and
I may also say a word about the Opera di Camera, which I find all the
great critics unanimous in praising, and which, in my small judginent, is
as pretty a piece of music as we have had for many a day.

How, when, AND WHEREP
OR, THE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
NTERLACHEN is of that pic-
turesque order of Swiss
villages contained in a
child's toy box. The plan
upon which it was originally
constructed is, as is the
work of every truly great
mind, of the very simplest
description, consisting in
fact of one side of a street
and a row of trees, and is
in consequence admirably
adapted for obviating the
necessity of a voluminous
guide book, or the smallest
chance of losing your way.
The residents are hotel-
keepers, lodging-house
keepers, and purveyors of
the necessaries of life.
During the season they are
busy enough, but when the
Tourists have departed, it
is supposed that to keep
themselves in good practice,
they stop at one another's
houses,. ; through the
pantomime of paying money
and the laughable farce of
making out the bill, in the
most correct manner. The visitors in the summer are Americans,
English, and waiters. We begin to think that somewhere or other,
Heaven only knows where, there is a Cosmopolitan Canton populated
entirely by waiters, possessing no nationality in particular; where the
children are born waiters, . from the moment of their beginning to
talk at all, speak five languages with equal incorrectness and ſacility.
Perhaps 'tis this mysterious spot that the retired waiter seeks, when
the familiar “Coming ” is about to change into the sure and certain
“Going.” Perhaps 'tis here that there is an Asylum ſor Dumb Waiters;
a Charitable Institution presided over, may be, by a Side-Board of
Directors. But we are wandering: let us return to Interlachen. Every
window in front commands some sort of view of the Jungfrau, and
from the back you can gaze upon the swift running waters of the Aar,
and the steep hill on the opposite bank, called the Harder; a name
evidently given to it by the many English pedestrians, who have ſound
the meadow bank on the Interlachen side the Easier. There is one
street musical nuisance, that comes out in the evening in the shape of
a band of five Swiss Minstrels in the national costume, who ſavour the
company with what they are pleased to call a song. Despite the
accuracy of the “get up,” we have our doubts as to the genuineness
of these minstrels’ nationality, for, coming upon them at an unguarded
moment, we couldn't help fancying that we heard the chief singer
talking with just the least taste in life of a brogue; and, but for the
assurance of a learned philologist, that there is a close affinity between
§. two hºuse. we could have sworn that the speaker was from the
unty Tip.
The gardens of the two principal hotels, we forget their names, adjoin
one another, which is a very pleasant discovery for Jones, who had pur-
posely gone to the one in order to avoid those BROWNs who are putting
up at the other—Jones' reason for this being, that he cannot put up
with the BRowns. How charmed then is he to find that there is

nothing to divide them!, May be he has, whispered soft nothings in
Miss LETITIA's, finely chiselled, in this instance very finely chiselled,
ear, or pressed her younger sister's hand, or done both impartially,
which is embarrassing; or there may be that little matter of a few
pounds still standing twixt Jones and OLD BRown, which causes BRown
to be very glad to meet Jones, but occasions no reciprocity of sentiment
in the latter gentleman's breast. The gardens form the stage for the
performance of many little comic dramas of everyday life.
The Tourist who is ſond of shooting, or who takes an interest in the
Volunteer Movement in his own country, will do well to walk along the
banks of the Aar, when the members of the Swiss Rifle Club are prac-
tising. The Switzers take up º in a hut about a hundred yards
from the river on, the Interlachen side: the Target is fixed upon the
opposite bank of the Aar. The happy and unsuspecting Tourist cannot
be too noisy during this walk... We advise him to be constantly shout-
ing out Hi,” or “Ho,” or “Hiho!” or “Hilliho,” or in fact any:
thing he likes, and as loud as he can, in order to attract the attention of
the marksmen, who, from their guarded position, cannot see anybody
coming, and the pedestrian will be lucky if the first inkling that he gets
of his proximity to the rifles, is hearing a whirr and then a sharp report
at no great distance from him. We say he will be lucky, as the ball may
be through your hat or your head before you know where you are.
One middle-aged English-
man of nervous temperament
held up his new hat, and
shouted to the riflemen to
show that he was there. The
Switzers mistook this for a
challenge to their skill in
hitting a new kind of target,
and in less than five seconds
as many bullets riddled his
bran-new gossamer. To go
upon all fours is no protec-
tion, as they might take you
ſor a beast, and though their
firing at you under these cir-
cumstances would be par-
donable, nay, even com-
mendable, yet it is admitted
on all hands, that whether
i. are killed by mistake
or somebody or something
else, or on purpose, the
result to yourself is equally
unpleasant. Perhaps, after
this, the conclusion to which
you will come, if you do not
come to any other unfortu-
mately premature conclusion
as above-mentioned, will be
the sensible one of not walking on the banks of the river Aar.
... If the Tourist is fond of Natural History, and for the matter of that,
if he isn't, he will come across some curious specimens of the Insect
tribe, and some too curious
specimens of the insect tribe
will come across him. We ne-
wer realised Spiders until we
saw them in this neighbour-
hood; neither could we have
imagined to what a Grass-
hopper might come at last, if
it once had its own way.
There was once upon a time a
Pantomime called the Butter-
fly's Ball, where all the
insects were as big as men,
but even in those early days S

they were men, because we

of a patent filter and the Thames Commissioners. Well, these awſul
beings are nothing to the sweet creatures inhabiting the fields on the
Harder Bank of the Aar.
In the heat of the day you go to sleep among the long grass, and are
dreaming that HER dear face is beaming upon you with love and tender-
mess, when suddenly you awake to the following dread reality here
depicted, to which in our terrified opinion the Dweller on the Threshold,
in * . LYTTON BULwer’s Zanoni, is not for one instant to be com-
pared. . .
THE EAGLE'S INVITATION.
THE Eagle called himself the pink of birds,
No wingèd thing more modest, milder, meeker;
Proved by that best of all criteria, words,
In every quarrel guardian of the weaker.
And yet, from ill designs however clear,
The Éagle was misconstrued and mistaken;
The Lambs drew tow’rds the º when he sailed near,
The Pigs made haste to save their piglings' bacon.
The Turkeys sought their pen; fussy DAME PARTLet
Clucked in her chicks or ducklings where they dabbled;
His wing's broad shadow the whole basse cour startled,
All save the Geese, who still serenely gabbled.
Such general distrust among his kind
Was very painful to the Eagle's feelings,
And he cast round, in his much-pondering mind,
To efface this false impression of his dealings.
“The potent beak and talons Nature gave
cannot lay aside—the more's the pity!
Or both from head and feet I’d gladly shave,
Though the proud buffetted, and jeered the witty.
“'Tis my misfortune—not my fault, alas!—
That Mother Nature has made me carnivorous;
How gladly, otherwise, I’d go to grass,
Enjoying peace and herbs with things herbivorous;
“Myself from this ill-odour to relieve,
Prove mine the innocence of babes and sucklings,
Convince men that my food I buy, not thieve,
And ne'er make raid on lambs, pigs, chicks, or ducklings,
“There’s but one way—my brother beasts and birds
Here in a solemn Congress to assemble,
To settle matters not with claws, but words,
And prove l’m not a thing at which to tremble.
“Why should the British Lion trade and culture
Neglect, to show his fangs at me, his brother?
Why should Russ Bear, Prussian and Austrian Vulture
Go thus armed to the teeth against each other?
“Come all and gather here, into my eyrie;
I charge myself with your accommodation:
Let generousſaith replace suspicion wary,
And for self-interest try self-abnegation.
“In the wide Kingdoms of earth, air, and sea,
All questions that want settlement let’s settle;
Far from us let recrimination be,
And vulgar interchange 'twixt pot and kettle.
“Heav'n knows I have no private ends behind,
No underland designs, no projects sinister;
I am a harmless bird-though much maligned;—
To the world's brotherhood who'd gladly minister.
“Come brethren?”—so the Eagle's missive spake,
And more mellifluous words were never written:
It made the Vultures stare, the Turkeys quake,.
And stirred e'en the slow Lion of Great Britain.
Quoth Austria's black Vulture, “I don’t mind -
M/hose prey’s ta'en, so that my preserves aren't peddled with ;"
The Prussian Vulture, too, was well inclined, -
“But, be it understood, our game's not meddled with.”
Quoth the Russ Bear, “While kindly winter freezes,
And angry Europe calls me o'er the coals,
Delay's my game: be it as Eagle pleases,
Provided he don't perch upon my Poles.”
The pip-sick Turkey swelled his scarlet wattles,
And gobbled, “Timeo Danaos—et Gallos ; ”
Small German Bantams talked quite big of battles,
And the Geese flapped applause, out of the shallows.
The Lion shifts and snorts and sniffs the air,
Lifting, deliberate, a doubtful face; . . . .
Then turns him three times round upon his lair,
And slowly settles down in his old place.
And growls, half-answer, half-interrogation,
“A message from the Eagle, H'm—I know !
Brotherhood, justice, and pacification?—
Don't seem to see it—and don't mean to go!
“Eagles may easily win gulls' applause; .
But 'tis my rule “saying’ to test by “doing; *
And as I laugh when Doves use beak and claws,
So I distrust when Eagles take to cooing.”
AEOLUS IN THE ORCHESTRA.
IN his proposal of a Congress, the French EMPEROR observes:—
* I take the initiative in such an overture, I do not yield to an impulse of
vanity."
“Taking the initiative in the overture” of course means, in plainer
Fnglish, that His Majesty, in Congress, intends to play first fiddle.
Supposing he succeeds in getting his band together, we doubt if those
who take a part in it will submit quite to his leadership, and we rather
fear his overture will be sadly unlike MeNDElssohn's Galm Sea and
Prosperous Voyage... Besides playing first fiddle, His Majesty inclines
rather to blowing his own trumpet; and if he attempts to play both
instruments at once, the chances are, we think, that there will be some
little discord. His Majesty is somewhat of an AEolus in his command
of that wind instrument to which we have referred, and hitherto his
tone has been so loud and warlike, that we can hardly fancy him per-
forming in a quiet overture of peace. We fear that when he takes the
chair at his proposed harmonic meeting he will find he has hard work
to do in keeping up the harmony, for some element of discord is
pretty sure to trouble him; and if his overture should be unfavourably
listened to, he would be among the first in kicking up a row.
Important News from America.
THE collecting of old postage-stamps has become such a mania in
the Northern States of America, that the supply of the genuine article
is insufficient to meet the demand. The Government has, therefore,
decided on a further issue of an immense quantity of Greenbacks,
which, it is expected, will answer nearly the same purpose in the end.

If you want to know whether any person whom you meet has lately
seen Miss KATE Joseph INE BATEMAN in Leah, all you have to do is to
look at your friend's eyes. . The amount of crying which that young
lady has caused among people who are not much in the habit of making
hydraulic demonstrations is extraordinary; and the odd part of the
thing is, that they bear her none of the malice which one usually bears
towards anybody who has set one's tears flowing; but, on the contrary,
they begin praising her with all their might, and finish by declaring
their intention to go and have another cry at the earliest opportunity.
Mr. Punch himself has yielded to the sympathetic magic. As a rule,
you might as easily resolve the Koh-i-Noor into a dew by talking to it,
as melt Mr. Punch's heart of diamond. His mission is to be made of
sterner stuff. Orpheus drew “iron tears down Pluto's cheek,” but
Orpheus, and all the Qrpheonites into the bargain, would draw down
nothing from Mr. Punch but a blow from his iron flail for their cheek.
He is firmer than Tilburina's Papa, and does not soften as a Father
while fixed as a Governor. But, as SIR WALTER observes:—
“Hearts are not flints, and flints are rent;"
(though we never knew a landlord who was at all happy to accept them
as such), and, for once in his liſe, Mr. Punch has given way. Miss
BATEMAN has “raised the waters.”
If you want a real “sensation,” and one which you need not be
ashamed of having experienced, go to the Adelphi, and if you can get
a place, sit down quietly and see the play. You need not be in a hurry
to be interested or excited, the sensation will come to you all in good
time. The drama is an adaptation of a work by a German Hebrew
named MozENTHAL, whom few persons would, from the specimen
before us, describe as a constructive dramatist of superhuman skill.
But a story is laid out, and Miss BATEMAN has to do the rest. She
takes the play calmly and resolutely into her own hands, and gradually
works up to something, the like whereof has not been achieved by any
actress of our day. Leah is a loving, revengeful woman, but not one
of those melodramatic ladies who have been, not to put too fine a point
upon it, rather a nuisance of late. She is selfish in her love, terrible
in her hate, but she has a higher nature that rises above selfish love
and savage hate, and which is called out in the later part of the play.
There is a curse of tremendous power, which no one will ever forget,
but it is not by this volcanic, display that Leah will be chiefly remem-
bered. The picture that will abide with us will be that of Leah crouch-
ing to caress a little child, and listening ſor a reply to her question as
to the child's name. The sound that will live in our ears will be the
wild womanly cry that answers the child's speech, the passion of sobs
that follow, and the marvellously sympathetic utierances of mingled
joy, and love, and forgiveness, which Miss BATEMAN pours out from
the fullest heart that ever gave vent to emotion. - -
This is a “sensation,” and as it is brought out, not by the inartistic
device of the exhibition of mere crime, nor by a somewhat more
artistic, iſ not more justifiable display of immoral passion, but from a
charm us with her true art and true womanhood.
A Music-mad King.
THE ears of the KING OF PRUssIA are too generally compared to
those of Midas. KING WILLIAM has a fine sense of music: indeed,
his mind, is much too musical ſor a constitutional sovereign. Nature
meant him for an absolute maestro. This is clear from the way, in
which he treats his Parliament. . He expects it simply to echo his
decrees. The truth is, that the legislative body which His Prussian
Majesty wants is not a Parliament, but a Chorus.

ZOOLOGICAL STREET MUSIC. WANTED.
DEAR PUNCH, - - -
AMONG the many scores of other, interesting creatures which
the Zoological Society, have recently exhibited, I am delighted to
observe that some Red Howling Monkeys have been added to the
various attractions of the beast-garden. Of these enchanting animals
a report before me states:—
“The ursine or red howler (Mycetes ursinus), the species to which these specimens
belong, is found in Guiana, Venezuela, and New Granada. Like others of the same
enus, it is remarkable for its extraordinary vocal powers. “Nothing,’ says the well
nown traveller, WATERtoN, who encountered this animal during his wanderings
in Demerara, “can sound more dreadful than its nocturnal howlings. . While lying
in your hammock in these i. and immeasurable wilds, you hear him howling
at intervals from eleven o'clock at night until daybreak. You would suppose that
half the wild beasts of the forest were collecting for the work of carnage. Now it
is the tremendous roar of the jaguar, as he springs upon his prey; now it changes to
his terrible and deep-toned growlings, as he is pressed on all sides by superior force;
and now you hear his last dying moan beneath a mortal wound.’”
And a further statement tells me that—
“The howling monkeys are provided with a 'special mechanism in the throat,
formed by the development of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, for the pro-
duction of these discordant sounds, which, according to HUMBoLDT, can be heard
at the distance of nearly a mile.”
I regret to learn, however, that these delightful animals, “appear to
possess a very delicate, organisation, and to suffer severely from the
effects of our changeable climate.” I am shocked to find that when
the latest bulletin was issued the invalids were “languishing from the
effects of close confinement,” and I hope some kind zoologist will pro-
pose that now and then they should be let out of their cages and taken
for a walk, or, if they would prefer it, allowed to climb about the trees
and bushes in the gardens, or to amuse themselves, like many a “young
monkey” in a pinafore, by plucking all the flowers that they can lay
their paws upon. If any be too weak to walk, or take this other active
exercise, I should hope an invalid carriage will be at their disposal; and
if it were announced that the Red Howlers would be wheeled about
the ſº in perambulators, every day while they continued in their
invalidish state, I have no doubt that the sufferers would become still
greater objects of attraction than they would ever be in health and in
their natural state.
It seems a pity the Howling Monkeys should not by some process
be acclimatised to England, for just consider, Sir, what valuable crea:
tures they would be, could they be trained to give street concerts for
the benefit of organ-grinders, and take a part in the nocturnal music of
the Waits. A voice whose howlings are quite audible at nearly a mile
off is an organ much more pººl than any barrel one I know of, and
would prove most useful in disturbing hardworked students, and
keeping sick people awake. Were bands of these Red Howlers to be
let loose, like the German bands, upon our quiet neighbourhoods, the
nuisance of street music might become so unendurable that Parliament
might be disposed in time to take the matter up. Every student knows
that it is even now so terrible that nothing short of howling monkeys
could aggravate its horrors, and I should like to see these animals per-
forming day and night before the houses of our senators, until in their
collective wisdom they might think it worth their while to pass a
stringent Act whereby street music should be stopped. - - -
Fondly hoping the Red Howlers may for this end be acclimatised,
believe me, my dear Punch, -
Yours disasted;
SUFFERER.
P.S. If the monkeys be too delicate to do what is required of them,
might not an Anti-Member-of-Parliament-Ever-Sleeping-Club be
started, to hire the worst of street musicians perpetually to haunt the
houses of M.P.'s, until they thought it worth their, while to do some-
thing or other, to mitigate a nuisance which, although innocuous to
; empty-headed people, is terribly tormenting to workers who have
rains

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[November 28, 1863.
FLAGGING INTEREST.
(From the Court Journal.)
ELIGHTFUL. news has ar-
rived The Champion of
the Seas, with MR. OUT-
RIDGE as Captain, and
MR. CHARLEs KEAN as
Chaplain, has arrived safely
at Melbourne. We also
learn that on
“Passing Cape Otway, where
there is a telegraph station
CAPTAIN OUTRIDGE signalle
that MR. KEAN was on board,
in answer to which announce-
ment the ensign was hoisted,
an honour heretofore only paid
to Queen's ships.”
As the Captain did not
hoist the ensign, the per-
formance cannot be de-
scribed by any irreverent
ribald as an Outridge on
the English flag, , and
indeed we see no objec-
tion to hoisting an Ensign,
that the poor young fellow
might have an early peep
at the great tragedian, but
we hope that the Ensign
came down all right. In
future the Navy will be divided into two classes, QUEEN’s ships, and
KEAN's ships. It was interesting, too, that this should have been
done at Cape Otway, because Otway was a dramatist, and wrote
a play in which MR. CHARLEs KEAN has distinguished himself.
In fact, everything has gone well, and we sincerely hope that the
brilliant career, which was opening to MR. CHARLEs, KEAN in the
Colonies will induce him to favour them with as long a visit as possible.
THE NAGGLETONS ON POLITICS.
The Sces E is laid in MR. NAGGLETON’s “Library,” an imposing apart-
ment measuring twelve feet by ten, and containing a book-case and a
boot-rack. Enter to MR. NAGGLETON, MRs. NAGGLETON, bearing
a newspaper.
Mr. Naggleton (who is at his desk, reading a large Blue Book and
making enormous notes therefrom). Ah, MARIA. One moment. “Wit-
ness considers that the outlay upon a Royal Palace ought to be under
the control of the vestry of i. parish in which such palace is situate.”
(...) And I concur. Now, then, my dear, what is the next
article
Mrs. Naggleton. You need not remind me of your tradesmanlike
education; but—
Mr. W. No, my dear, but if you use such language, I must take leave
to remind you of the rules of syntax. An education cannot be like a
tradesman. Devote the energies of your remarkable mind to the con-
sideration of that proposition.
Mrs. N. Be pleased to stop talking nonsense, and just tell me what
this means. [Shows him a paragraph in her newspaper.
Mr. W. (Reddening, but pretending to be unconscious), I am pleased
to see that you can condescend to take an interest in any periodical
besides Le Follet, my dear. What is this? (Reads.) “We understand
from good authority, that at the approaching general election, one o
the candidates for the representation of the great and liberal borough
of Finsbury will be found in the person of MR. HENRY NAGGLETON,
the eminent drysalter of Lower Thames Street, and of Westbourne
Gardens, Hyde Park. This gentleman's political principles entitle him
to the confidence of the electors, and his oratorical powers are of no
mean order. We hope that he will stand.” Well, I am sure that it is
very pleasing to be introduced in this favourable way to the notice of
the public.
Mrs. N. M.R. NAGGLETON |
Mr. M. He hears with ears.
[Rather uncomfortable, however, in spite of his quotation.
Mrs. N. You cannot mean to tell me that this—that you have given
the slightest authority for printing such a disgraceful and disgusting
paragraph. -
Mr. N. Modestly waiving the newspaper's compliments, I see
nothing to object to in the paragraph. All its statements are true. I
am a drysalter, and those are my two addresses.
Mrs. W. The newspaper ought to be prosecuted. As if the vulgarity
of printing your trade, and trade address, was not enough, you must
drag my house into the business.
Mr. W. Well, your house came out of the business.
Mrs. N. HENRY, this is no common affair. I generally speak my
mind, and there is an end of it, but this becomes serious, and you must
be good enough to abstain from insulting me with jokes. What does
this paragraph mean?
Mr. N. What it says.
Mrs. N. What!, You have the face to sit there and tell me that you
are going to squander the money which ought to be your children's, to
buy †. into Parliament for such a place as Finsbury. That it
should come to this
Mr. N. (savagely). That what should come to what?
Mrs. N. O, well, that is enough. I must consult with my family as
to what it is my duty to do. 1 feel crushed and bewildered.
Mr. M. Consult your family, Madam? What do you mean by that?
I have merely to inform you that if your family takes the liberty of
intruding its impertinence upon me, I shall make very short work with
your family, MRs. NAGGLEton. -
Mrs. Wiſcannot answer your violence, HENRY. That it should
come to this
Mr. N. (We fear with a strong expression which need not be set down).
If you would cease to repeat that idiotic cuckoo note, and talk sense, I
might answer you. If you can't, perhaps you will let me read.
Mrs. N. HENRY | HENRY |
[Looks earnestly at him, and then takes to her pockethandkerchief.
Mr. W. (relenting). MARIA, do not be so absurd. In the first place
there is no harm done at present, and in the second there is none
intended.
Mrs. N. (with a very long sob). O o!
Mr. W. There is nothing unreasonable in a man’s having an ambition
to sit in Parliament, I suppose?
Mrs. N. (with another very long sob), O-o!
Mr. N. Don’t go on in that way, or you will compel me to act with-
out consulting you. I had º: your advice and assistance.
Mrs. M. Mine! I help to ruin you and rob my children. HENRY |
Mr. M. Ruin and robbery be—left out of the argument. I tell you
that nothing is settled, but that if I stand for Finsbury it will be on
flºº understanding that I do not pay one shilling. Do you hear
t -
Mrs. W. It is well to treat me like a child, HENRY, but I listen to
the conversation that goes on around me. I understand your Jesuitry.
Mr. N. And I don’t understand the word.
Mrs. N. MR. S.NoTCHLEY mentioned the other evening how these
things are done. You do not pay. Qf course not. But somebody puts
a large sum of money into a bank, for bribing votes, and though you
have no idea who has done it, you are bound in honour to see that he
gets it again.
Mr. N. M.R. SNOTCHLEY has derived his experience from observing
and probably participating in the corrupt practices of his patrons, the
unscrupulous aristocracy, who—
Mrs. N. HENRY-it is a small matter at such a moment as this, but
your whole language has changed, and you talk as if you were making
speeches to the rabble.
Mr. N. Rabble, MARIA, is not a term to be used in describing any
portion of your fellow-creatures, and you will specially eliminate it from
your vocabulary during my connection with political life.
Mrs. N. Oh! That means that you are going to be connected with
the lowest of the low. If you must move out of your own sphere into
one for which you are ridiculously unfit, you might have tried for
something respectable.
Mr. N. For some pocket borough, I suppose, on sale by some friend
of MR. SNOTCHLEY’s.
Mrs. N. There you might at least have been elected like a gentleman.
Mr. W. Certainly. I might have broken the laws myself, and caused
a ſ: hundreds of other persons to take bribes and to perjure them-
Selves.
Mrs. N. If you are so much better and more virtuous than other
Members of Parliament, I wonder you condescend to join them.
Mr. N. (proudly). There are men, MARIA, who will enter Parliament
unstained by a single offence against the law, and if I enter it, I shall
be one of that band. ---
Mrs. M. Band, indeed, yes, a brass band, to profess such hypocritical
virtue. Don't I know that you can no more get elected for Finsbury
without the good-will of the public-houses than you can fly in the air.
Mr. N. (uneasily). Who told you that nonsense? -
Mr. N. Is it nonsense? I am not to be fooled. HENRY, I think it
my duty to tell you that you must be insane to go on in this manner.
I can account for your conduct in no other way.
Mr. N. And who asks you to account for my conduct.
Mrs. N. Everybody will ask me.
Mr. M. Who’s everybody. Your family, perhaps?
Mrs. N. Well, if they should show enough interest in my welfare and
º children's to remark that you ought to be very rich to engage in
elections--

:
!
Mr. M. You may ask them to show a little more interest, and pro-
mote your welfare and your children's by paying me certain debts
which you know of. -
Mrs. N. And you would consign my relatives to incarceration that
you º uander the money in the beer-houses of Islington' -
Mr. N. That speech is perhaps the greatest feat in the way of a flying
leap that will be performed during the whole hunting season. Ha! haſ
ha! What an old goose you are
Mrs. N. Pray, HENRY, pray take advice.
Mr. M. My dear, I’m quite well.
Mrs. N. Think of the children. Why should their prospects be
blighted for the sake of your foolish vanity. Don’t fly out, you know I
speak the truth, and only for your good. You are about as fit to be a
Member of Parliament as I am to make a steam-engine...You have no
seriousness, you can amuse people of your own sort with after-dinner
speeches of not very refined humour, but, you cannot speak so as to
command respect, and as for politics, you know nothing but what you
learn from newspapers. You will only be a laughing-stock, and it will
be very hard upon me to hear you made a butt in good society.
Mr. W. (in a white rage). Your unwifelike disrespect for me, and
º utter ignorance on political questions I can pardon, with some pity,
ut please to leave the children's names out, or I shall. leave the house.
Mrs. N. (quietly). Is it good grammar to say unwifelike disrespect.
Can disrespect be like a wife? - -
Mr. M. (snorting). Perhaps you will allow me to finish my reading?
Mrs. N. Before you turn me out of the room, will you be so kind as
to say what I am to answer when anybody asks me about the truth of
the paragraph?
Mr. W. Ask them in return how they think I made my money.
Mrs. N. What a questionſ -
Mr. N. Never mind; askit, and if they can't tell, say that it was by
minding my own business. - - -
Mrs. N. (sadly). And this is the treatment which a wife receives
when she humbly creeps into her husband's room and ventures to ask
for his affectionate confidence in a matter of such importance to them
both. Well, well!
Mr. N. Affectionate confidence! Pelts him with abuse for an hour,
and then talks of affectionate confidence.
Mrs. M. (almost tenderly). And cannot a man of the world, and a
husband, make a little allowance for the excitement of a wife whose
mind has been suddenly troubled, as much for his sake as her own, and
who beside is far from well?
Mr. N. I did not know you were not well, my dear MARIA. You
look the picture of health. Why don't you sit down?,
Mrs. N. (smiles). You did not ask me.
Mr. N. Ask you! How can you be so foolish. [Gives her a chair.
Mrs. N. Never mind now, dear, I must go up to the nursery. Don't
be angry with me.
Mr. N. You do try me, occasionally, MARIA, and really it is not the
thing to try and drive me. If you had not flown at me as you did, I
should have told you that before you came into the room, I had sent
off a letter to the paper to contradict the paragraph. I have no inten-
tion of standing for Finsbury. -
Mrs. N. Well, I did not think that upon reflection you would be
such an idiot as to offer yourself.
Mr. N. You did not * -
Mrs. N. No. But I am sorry you sent away the letter without
letting somebody else look over it to see that you had expressed your-
self with tact. (Has the door in her hand.) MR. S.Notchley will call
in the afternoon, and he could have corrected it for you. However, I
am glad that you have shuffled out of it somehow. [Erit, and shuts door.
[And on the whole it is as well that she did shut it. The enraged
politician takes the oaths and his seat, but not in a way that
would at all please that eminent theologian and bishop-stirrer,
the SPEAKER.
THE POPE’S EYE AND BETTY MARTIN.
THE lower orders in intellect of Italy are well known to believe in a
ridiculous superstition which ascribes to the gaze of some persons an
unlucky radiance under the name of jettatura, the person whose eye
emits it being called a jettatore, and that baleful organ itself the mal'
occhio or evil eye. Of all people in this world, that personally benevo-
lent old gentleman the Pope is supposed by the Romans to be gifted
with this sinister endowment, and they cite, as a proof of its operation,
the fall of a ballast-train off the new railway drawbridge over #. Tiber,
which structure His Holiness had solemnly blessed only a few days
before. As this accident arose from the bolting of the train at
time when the drawbridge happened to be up, and the train probably
bolted because it was not looked after, there are sufficient grounds for
referring to common negligence that effect of gravitation which the
Roman populace has imputed to the eye of the Pope. As nobody was
hurt by it, the Holy Father might even claim the credit of having
affected the bridge with a favourable eye instead of an evil one, and
thus averted the serious consequences which might have attended the
catastrophe there with connected. Many will attribute this fortunate
result, to the papal benediction, and perhaps His Holiness himself
may think that had something to do with it, if he is one of those patent-
medicine mongers who believe in their own pills.
It is said that Pio Nono, who is something of a
that his people impute to his smile of benignity an i ntary effect as
bad, as that which might be conceived to be exerted by a malicious
squint, and that he occasionally cracks jokes on his supposed quality of
a jetſaſore. No doubt he is accustomed to say that he knows it is all
his eye; and as often as he makes this remark, ANTONELLI, DE MÉRode,
and all the other Cardinals go into fits of laughter. "We may here
observe that there is one Pope's Eye which can never incur the discredit
of being an evil eye; and that is the Pope's Eye in a leg of mutton.

THE QUESTION OF COLOUR.
AM Inot a Man and a Brother?
No, replies Anthropology,
Less like than one ape's like another,
Distinct in craniology;
The form of your head and your face is
erior in particular;
our jaw projects more than our race’s:
Your front’s less perpendicular.
Besides thatº: skin is dyed sable,
You have also bones more ponderous;
Their weight is so considerable,
Alone it sinks you under us.
Your shanks, too, present a deflection
From rectilinearity:
We hold your long arms an objection
As against your parity.
Your great-toes are formed for prehension,
Like thumbs; to true humanity,
They prove, beyond contention,
That all your claims are vanity.
Your heel than our own’s rather longer;
Your hair is likewise woolly; you
Are the weaker, and we are the stronger;
So we’ve a right to bully you.
How strange will this new information
Appear to that Society
Combined for your emancipation!
Perchance 'twill shock their piety:
Perhaps it may stagger Lord BROUGHAM :
With more, too old to learn it, he
Will uphold, for all we can show 'em,
Your manhood and fraternity.
POLITICAL INFORMATION.
THE FIRST Lond of THE TREASURY is also called the Premier or
Prime Minister. PAM is a Premier, who is y prime.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR has the best place in the Cabinet. When
his colleagues get the sack, he loses the woolsack; but the loss is made
up to him with a £5,000 a-year or so pension instead.
The CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer’s office differs in one im:
portant point from that of the Lord Chancellor. It is not pretended
to have anything to do with Equity, of which the Income-Tax is a
standing violation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also is his own
taxing master.
The SECRETARY FoR Foreign AFFAIRs may be called our War
Minister, for whenever we do get involved in war, it is through him.
The SECRETARY FoR WAR, on the other hand, might be called the
Peace Minister, because his business is to get us out of the scrapes into
which we have been got by the Foreign Secretary. -
The SECRETARY of THE Home DEPARTMENT resembles the Foreign
Secretary in having to deal with rogues, but differs from him in the
circumstance that those rogues are domestic.
The Attorney-GENERAL is a rising Barrister, holding a brief for his
colleagues, who frequently, when in trouble, want the help of a lawyer
to get them out.
The Solicitor-GENERAL is the Attorney-General’s devil.
The CHIEF CoMºMissionER or WoRKs is our Minister for Æsthetic
affairs; a sort of comic edile.
The Horse GuARDs regulate the Army with a wisdom that savours
less : the horse than of a more patient but less docile and less noble
animal.
The ADMIRALTY comprises some land-lubbers; but is always at sea.

THE CRINOLINE STORM SIGNAL; A WARNING TO YOUNG LADIES AT THE
SEA-SIDE.
SHAMEFUL BARBARITY.
WE, had thought, erroneously it appears, that the days, of English cruelty, to the natives of
India had passed away, and that a more humane rule had been established. We were mistaken,
SIR CHARIES TREVELYAN himself, who, when at home, , was regarded as rather a wise and
enlightened man, has fallen, into the old ways, and it is with profound regret that we read this
latest act of his, than which we have rarely noted anything more savage:–
“SIR CHARLEs TREvely.AN has offered a prize of 500rs. for the best Essay on the following Thesis:—“Compare
the influence of Greek learning on the Arabs under the Abbasside Caliphs of Bagdad and the Ommiyade Caliphs
of Cordova, with the subsequent influence of Arabian learning on the reviving European mind after the dark
ages; and from the comparison infer the probable influence which the mature intellect of Europe should exercise
in its turn, now that it is once more brought in contact with the Mahommedan mind in India.”
Five, hundred rupees I, Why, it is worth, that to read the sentence. If this is a specimen of
what the mature intellect of Europe (and SIR CHARLEs's is a fine intellect, we cannot deny it,
while deploring its perversion), does, when brought into contact with the Mahommedan mind, we
can only deplore the case of the unfortunate followers of the Prophet. The “probable”
influence of such treatment may be easily
inferred and concisely described. The Mahom-
medan mind will shut up. In the name of
humanity we demand the recaloſ SIR CHARLEs
by the very first mail.
HOMOEOPATHIC SOUP.
TAKE a robin's leg, .
Mind, the drumstick merely ;
Put it in a tub,
Filled with water nearly. ,
Set it out of doors,
In a place that’s shady;
Let it stand a week,
(Three days for a lady).
Put a spoonful in
To a five-quart kettle,
It should be of tin,
Or perhaps bell metal.
Fill the kettle up
Put it on a boiling;
Skim the liquor well
To prevent its oiling.
Let the liquor boil
Half-an-hour or longer,
(If 'tis for a man
You may make it stronger).
Should you now desire
That the soup be flavoury,
Stir it once around .
With a stalk of savory.
When the soup is done,
Set it by to jell it;
Then three times a day
Let the patient smell it.
If he chance to die,
Say 'twas Nature did it;
But should he get well,
Give the Soup the credit.
STANLEY IS “THE CRY.”
THE Presbyterian organ of the Church of
England, we need not name our esteemed
Record, has performed an act of gracious
kindness, for which we are obliged to say
that the Record's usual habits had not pre-
pared us. We hasten to note it. That the
wisdom and justice of the appointment of
CANON STANLEY to the Deanery of West-
minster might be clear to everybody, the
Record gives its certificate that such appoint-
ment is “a melancholy fact.” Disapproba-
tion by the Record having been thus signi-
fied, of course every sensible person must
now be convinced that the Dean is the right
man in the right place. The voluntary tender-
ing of this conclusive evidence, shows a
noble instinct in the Presbyterian Church of
England journal.
Notes on the German Diet.
... THE German Diet must be sad sour krout
if it is going to curdle the milk of European
concord with its pretensions to Schleswig
and Holstein. ... If it were a generous diet it
would not bully Denmark, when it might
stand up on behalf of the Poles against a
Power of its own size. The German Diet
would be fine food for powder.
Q. Where does Neptune stable his horses?
A. Why, wherever the Sea-Mews may be,
of course.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SHADOWS OF THE WEEK.
NTER now our Theatrical Shadows, and
at once we take of our hat to MR.
FECHTER, expressing a hope that his
Theatrical Shadow may never, be less!
The Romantic Melodrama, Bel Demonio,
has been preceded by a charming little
piece, entitled Uncle Baby. Any one
with the slightest pretension to taste
in theatrical matters ought to go early
and see Uncle Baby. For the benefit
of those who, either by reason of a late
dinner or dyspepsy, circumstances over
which they have no control, may be
prevented from witnessing this truly
delightful Comedietta, we will attempt
to ſº. some, slight notion of the plot,
dialogue, and interesting situations.
The curtain rises and discovers Miss
CARLOTTA lºº dressed as Mary
(shall we say Mary? very well), and
seated at a desk. Miss IEcLERcQ looks at the audience, and every-
body cheers enthusiastically for about the space of two minutes, by
MR, BARNETT's, the Acting Manager's, watch. When this has sub-
sided the play begins in earnest.
Mary (putting some money in a secret drawer). Ah! for these many
years——
(Goes on saying something which evidently affects her deeply, but
which is totally inaudible in the fºllº and not heard in the other parts
of the House, in consequence of there being some confusion in the Box-
keepers' minds as to the precise numbering of the seats.)
Enter MR. ShoBE, lightly.
(He is supposed to be in love with Mary. Shall we call him Arthur’
we never heard name, and it wasn't in the bills:–very good then,
Arthur be it.)
4thur (aside). Ah, she little knows who's down-stairs. (Aloud.)
ary I
..] _Mary, (turn; suddenly and almost crying). Arthur ! (Pouts.) How
you frightened me. Looks at the carpet and pouts again.
Arthur (who evidently has very limited ideas on any subject—aside).
She little knows who’s down-stairs. (Aloud) Mary'ſ
[MARY pouts and locks up sixpence in a secret drawer.
4rthur (opening a door-aside). She little knows who is down stairs.
Enter a Girlish Young Lady, whom we'll call ELLEN.
Ellen (with feeble passion). Mary!
Mary (emotionally affectionate). Ellen! Sister!!
- They embrace three times.
4rthur (aside). She knows who was donº z
fully.) As it’s your birthday, Mary, I’ve brought you this.
("This” appeared from where we were sitting to be a small cabbage
º as Mary called it violets on the spot, we suppose she .
right.
Máry (rapturously). Oh, Arthur! [Shakes his hands heartily.
Jºlen. And I’ve brought you this. (We forget what.)
Aſary (more rapturously and sobbing). Oñ, Ellen!
[Embraces her several times.
Enter a Little Boy about nine years old, whom we will call JIMMY.
º, (squeaking). I’ve brought you some Wi-lets, be-cos Sister
loves Wi-leſs. - [Finishes in a very high key.
Mº, (ecstatically). Real Violets. (The others weren't then?). Oh!
She imbraces Jimmy, who stands with his hands in his pockets.
Then crosses and embraces ELLEN, who embraces MARY, who
shakes hands with ARTHUR, who pats JIMMY's head.
4rthur (suddenly). Let’s hide! [They all get behind tables and chairs.

Curtain descends.
This piece, turned into a very pretty ballet, with costumes à la
atteau, and sparkling music by MR. W. H. Montgomery, would
open the evening very well; but who that knows how to give a good
entertainment will dose his guests with a glass of sixth-rate Chablis
with his oysters, simply because the remainder of the dinner is to be
washed down with the very best sparkling Moet and Chaudon? No,
no, MR. FECHTER, Bel Demonio will suffice for everybody, and begin at
eight by all means; but if there must be a comedietta, by way of first
course, then let it be something better of its kind than Uncle Baby.
LINCOLN AND SHAKSPEARE.
A SENTIMENTAL admirer of PRESIDENT, LINcols, imitating the
sycophantish watch which parasites keep on the gestures of kings in the
Qld World, tells us in print that MR. LINcoin lately went to hear
Macbeth, and that when the Macduff had uttered the following celebrated
passage, the President “wore a sad, sober face, as if suddenly his
thoughts had wandered far away.”
“New sorrows
Strike on the face of heaven, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out
Like syllables of Dolourt.”
We are not surprised that the last word struck the President. The
syllables of Dol-lar well mouthed out, are just those which would arrest
MR. LINcolN's attention. But we suspect that his thoughts did not
wander farther than MR. CHAse's manufactory of Green Backs.
Stupid Old Woman.
MRs. PARTINGTON wants to know why the Americans cannot imitate
the French in this last move as in everything else. Why not submit
the quarrel to arbitration? She is sure MR. LINCOLN is arbitrary
enough for anything.

he Poetical Tourist will
make a point of walking
along the Lauter-brunnen
Road, only stopping at the
Castle of Unspunnen, the
reputed residence of the
armiable but mistakenly im-
ulsive Manfred, to call for
MR. PHELPs. Somebody
writing *...; this
Castle has observed, that,
“from its position in front
of the high Alps, LORD
BYRON must have had it
in , his eye.” . That the
noble. Poet, not being ex-
empted from the ills to
which all flesh is heir,
might have had at , some
time or another a stye in
his eye is probable, that
he ever had a castle in it
is simply, impossible. A
Cockney Tourist, however,
actually observed that, “If LoRD BYBoN 'ad a stye in the heye,
he might 'ave 'ad a castle in the 'air.” The Legend of the Castle of
Unspunnen is a very touching one, and will be sung to you by any
peasant for a mere song. The following is a translation adapted to the
well-known and once exceedingly popular air, Willikins and his Dinah:-
THE LEGEND OF IDA THE BOLD BARON'S CHILD.
QLD BUSKARD THE BARQN, the last of his race,
Had a very big body, and very red face,
That he came of a right Royal Stock, some suppose,
From the purple he constantly wore on his nose.
Singing: tooral li, tooral, &c.
In Unspunnen Castle this Baron did dwell,
He had but one daughter, a werry fine Swiss gal,
Her name it was IDA, with a fortune that seems
A whole heap o' money when told in centimes.
Singing: tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
Said the Baron one day, in a very stern voice,
“I want you to marry the man of my choice.”
Says she, “I can’t do it,” says the Baron, “For why?”
“’Cos,” says she, “I love RUDOLPH,” says the Baron, “My I—
—da,” tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
When the Baron heard this he was furious and riled,
And he bullied his daughter who patiently smiled,
Which annoyed him so much, that he hit at her crown
And u-pon a feather bed he knocked IDA down.
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
Then he bolted the door and he locked it outside,
...You shall never come out to be that RUDolph's bride;”
Then he kicked all his servants impartiallee,
Till the menials each felt like a vassal at sea.
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
While the Baron was a-swearing just like anythink,
RUDOLPH, at her window saw Miss IDA wink,
He squeezed through the iron bars, being but thin;
hile the Baron “let out,” he was being let in.
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
º
|\sº
* !
To Zähringen the fond loviers ran away,
And the Baron waged war upon RUDoLPH next day,
It lasted some time, as they went on this plan,
Each alternately fought and alternately ran.
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
At the end of two years, praps, or rather before,
The Baron one night heard a knock at his door,
Sharp as hit with the stick that the Scotch use at “Golſ,”
It was MISTER and Missis and MASTER RUDOLPH. ,
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
Then his Daughter kneltdown, and said she, “’I'm a Ma’;
Then held up an infant, “so like Grandpapal"
And the Baron, who had of real feeling no lack,
Felt hysterica passio all up his back.
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral l da.
“Oh, bless you, my IDA, my RUDOLPH and Boy!”
Said the Baron; and all from that moment was Joy!
And they wrote 'neath the crest that belongs to their kin,
“Love locked out of doors by the window gets in.”
Tooral I, tooral I, tooral Ida.
So much for the Baron and his fair daughter IDA.
LETTER FROM THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER.
DeAR Dr. PUNCH, Danbury Palace, Chelmsford.
I AM bound to testify to the gentlemanly character of the re-
monstrances which you sometimes think fit to address to myself and
other dignitaries. But I am grieved to notice a departure, last week,
from your ordinary courtesy.
You must be aware that I am not a Hebrew scholar, for Istated that
fact when I put down DR. ColeNso.
Yet last week you headed an article with what I know is, Hebrew,
because I have compared the letters with the alphabet in the beginning
of my PARKHURST's Lexicon.
I am willing to believe, however, that, you did not intend to annoy
me, and having protested against this blemish upon a very beautiful

THE DANISH DIFFICULTY EXPLAINED.
ou Ng persons, who
dine out, and wish
to be considered
well-informed young
diners-out, must de-
sire to be able, to
answer, in a few
simple words, the
question so fre-
quently put as to
the real value of the
difficulty about the
KING of DENMARK's
succession to, the
Schleswig-Holstein
duchies, Mr. Punch
will explain the mat-
terin a moment. The
case is this, KING
ChRISTIAN, being an
agnate, , is the col-
lateral heir male of
the German Diet,
and consequently the
E- Duchy of Holstein,
bein mediatised,
could only have
ascended to the
Landgravine of
Hesse in default of
consanguinity in the
younger branch of
the Sonderburg-Glucksburgs, and therefore Schleswig, by the surrender
of the DUKE of Saxe-CobURG GoTHA, was acquired as a fief in remainder
by the morganatic marriage of FREDERICK THE SEVENTH. This is
clear enough, of course. The difficulty, however, arises from the fact
that while the Danish protocol of 1852, which was drawn up by loRD
PAIMERSTON, but signed by LoRD MALMESBURY, repudiated er post
facto the claims of PRINCEss MARY of Anhalt, as remainder-woman
to the Electoress of AugustENBURG, it only operated as a uti
possidelis in reference to the interests of PRINCE CHRISTIAN of Schles-
wig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg, while BARON BUNSEN’s protest
against Catholicism, under the terms of the Edict of Nantes, of course
barred the whole of the lineal º of the Grand Duke from claiming
by virtue of the Salic clause of the Pragmatic Sanction. The question
is therefore exhaustively reduced to a very narrow compass, and the
dispute simplyis, whether an agnate who is not consanguineous, can, as a
Lutheran, hold a fief which is clothed by mediatisation with the character
of a neutral belligerent...This is really all that is at issue, and those
who seek to com licate the case by introducing the extraneous state-
ment, true no doubt in itself, that the PRINCEss of WALEs, who is
the daughter of the present KING OF DENMARK, made no public
renunciation of either the duchies, or the ivory hairbrushes, when she
dined with LoRD MAYOR Rose, are simply endeavouring to throw
dust in the eyes of Europe.
GAME-MURDER MADE EASY.
WHAT does the Times mean by the heading of this paragraph?—
“Good Sport.—The DUKE of C–, Lond G. M-, GENERAL H—, CoLoREL
M—, and Colonel N–, have shot this week over the L– preserves, near
N , and made a bag of 636 head—viz., 332 pheasants, 256 hares and rabbits,
and 48 partridges. On a second day the same party shot in three hours in C
Park, 190 pheasants, 60 hares, 23 rabbits, two partridges, and one woodcock. The
Duke of C– has also shot over the covers of GENERAL H–, in the same
neighbourhood, with the Duke of B–, Lord M. C.—, Lord S.–, the MAR-
sºlº of S-, and Colonel, M-. In two days 1,260 pheasants, 324 hares, 101
rabbits, and 16 partridges were shot, making a total of 1,635 head.”
* Good sport!” Good gracious ! Can you call such wholesale
butchery as this “good sport”? That six guns in two days should
kill (five wanting only) seventeen hundred head of game, is an act that
appertains less to a sportsman than a slaughterer; indeed is quite
unworthy to be spoken of as sport. There can surely be no sport in
destroying hares and pheasants where they exist in such abundance,
that a man can shoot well nightwo hundred of them in a day. Tobag
a brace or two of pheasants with a couple of good spaniels, to see your
dogs work well, to flush your game yourself, and to follow it up skil.
fully-this you may call “good sport,” and Punch will not º of
You. But Punch never will allow that lounging by a covert-side, and
firing at tame pheasants is an employment that can rightly be looked
upon as sport: No, no, my noble sportsmen. Walk your birds up
i: and use more dogs and ſewer beaters, and you will get a
etter appetite for dinner, and have less chance of getting headaches
from the º of your guns. If mere rapidity in killing be con-
sidered as “good sport,” why don't you use blunderbusses in the lieu
of common fowling-pieces, and have your hares and rabbits penned up
in a sheepfold before you begin shooting, so that you may slaughter,
y, a dozen at a shot. The same thing might be done with your par-
º and pheasants, which are so tame in large preserves that they
might easily be caught by the gamekeepers at feeding-time, when their
wings might just be clipped enough to stop their flying, so that when
the day for killing came, they might be huddled into poultry-pens and
shot upon the ground. Larger bags in this way might be made in
shorter time than is possible at present, and, to judge by the reports
which are paraded in the newspapers, some “sportsmen” seem to
think that the only aim in shooting is to make up a big bag.
OPERA. IN CHANCERY.
WHAT is all this quarrel in which Colonel Knox
inst MR. Gye is uplifting his Wox?.
One's sense of the fitness of things it quite shocks
When Harmony's friends give each other hard knocks.
Why, the case is just this. The brave Colonel had crocks
Full of gold, and no end of consols in the stocks,
And debentures, for aught that I know, in the Docks;
Of which tin, with true friendship (like that of Miss Toz)
He advanced heavy sums, but demanded a box,
To be kept every night, which in Latin is mor,
For his own occupation, no matter what flocks
Should crowd to the Opera and ask for it. Mor,
One night of a run upon LEADER and Cock's,
And other librarians, for boxes; when rocks
Had melted at Fº of young ladies in frocks
In the height of the fashion,-a keeper unlocks
The box set apart for the brave ColoneL KNox.
It was nine of the night by the watches and clocks,
When he comes to the house, with his elegant hocks
Invested in O the most beautiful socks,
And finds in possession a party that blocks
His entrance, and all his remonstrances mocks.
He might have gone off and beheld Bor and Cor,
Or to chapel, to SPURGEON's, to BINNEY’s, or BROCK's,
Or home to a novel of old PAUL DE Kock’s,
Or to read rare BEN Jonson’s fine play of The For,
Qr to TATT's and made bets upon horses and jocks,
Or to good PADDY GREEN’s to hear music of Locke's;
But no, on his mouth there hath º: the Big Ox,
And he says there’s a partnership. Firm: “GYE and KNox.”
FINE WORDS FOR FOUL WORKS.
THERE seems to be a growing fashion now for calling ſoul things by
fine names, and a word or two from Punch perhaps may aid in checking
it. A murder, for example, is seldom called a murder, it is generally
spoken of as an “appalling tragedy.” Now this word “tragedy” has
far too much of staginess about it to fit it to give force when used in
real life. By calling murders “ tragedies,” you class them, as it were,
among dramatic unrealities, and so weaken the abhorrence wherewith
we should d them. The penny-a-liners are of course the chief de-
linquents in this way, and that their example appears to be infectious
we may infer from the letters which have lately been in print about the
murders in the cab., From one of these communications, inserted in
the Daily Telegraph, and signed by a writer who adds M.D. to his
name, we quote the following words:–
“The question then arises who [sic] did the poisoner commence with in offering
the fatal chalice—the mother or the children?"
The “ſatal chalice” here referred to was a common pewter pint pot
from a public house, and we can, see no reason here for calling that
utensil by any finer name. On the contrary, indeed, we see strong
reason for not doing so; for the words “fatal chalice” have a stagy
smack about them, and are entirely out of place in a medical analysis of
the evidence brought forward in an actual case of crime. People who
can speak of a murder as a “tragedy” of course may be expected to
extend their paraphrasing, and talk of “fatal, chalices” where they
mean common pewter pois. Such poetry is apt to put a stage gloss
upon criminals, and to make us view their villanies as merely stage
effects. Many a man would shrink from murder, who, were it simply
called a tragedy, might feel a smaller dread of acting in it; and to our
thinking the threat of being “launched into etermity” sounds a good
deal less intimidating than the threat of being hanged. If people go
on speaking of a murder as a tragedy, they will soon talk of a murderer
as simply a tragedian; and an act that should excite the, deepest
feelings of abhorrence, may in time be merely viewed as a theatrical
performance, and if carried through with cleverness, as not unworthy
of applause.

THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENIUS.
If the Hull News may be relied upon for a truthful report of certain
proceedings before Mr. TRAVIs, the Stipendiary Magistrate of that
place, the following interesting little drama was performed the other
day, when an unfilial fisherman, named WILLIAM HAM, was sum-
*: by the Board of Guardians for neglecting to maintain his

Relieving Officer. Your Worship, I support this information, but
HAM will not support his lawful father and mother.
Unfilial Fisherman. Worship, I left home at thirteen years of age,
neither more nor less, and I have ever since done what I could for the
old ones, and wishing I could do more, but can’t.
Stipendiary Magistrate. HAM, do you happen to have any goods
which we can take away from you?
U. F. A few, Worship.
S. M. Because I don’t want to take you, if I can take them.
[His Worship considers.

U. F. Who’s a denyin' on it? Not me, to my knowledge.
S. M. HAM, I find I can't touch your goods, so you must be good
enough to go to prison for two months, with hard labour.
R. O. There, you see, HAM.
[The UNFILIAL FISHERMAN is conducted to the cells below.
S. M. (after a time). Bring that fisherman up again.
The fisherman is dived for, and restored to the realms of light.

with hard labour, therefore I shall not commit you direct, and you will
be good enough to pay a fine of Ten Shillings.

Yes, HAM, One Month. -

[The UNFILIAL Fish ERMAN is sent to prison, and the audience is
decidedly of opinion that MR. TRAvis is underpaid by a salary
of £800 for taking so much trouble with a case, and that he ought
to have £1000, and he thinks so, too.

A CHIVALROUS KING.
Abyssmia...We suspect that this word .does not convey much
impression to the minds of most people. , Except that we have all read
the poem MR. ColeRIDGE made in his sleep, about
“An Abyssinian maid
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of Mount Abora.”
The district in question is a terra incognita. But we shall hear more
about it soon, for the º whose name was KAssa, but is, by Coptic
baptism, TheoDORE, has been getting into scrapes, and is sending an
embassy to ask help from England. e owe him a good turn, out of
gratitude; for two English officers, volunteers in his army, having been
killed, the excellent Christian King came down in full force on the
slayers, took three thousand prisoners, and slew them all as offerings to
the English manes, and indeed proceeded to extremities by adding the
hands and feet of a hostile Prince, by way of rounding off the account.
Such chivalrous devotion to one's friends, in these Bohemian days when
a man smokes your cigars over-night and abuses you in print next day,
is quite refreshing, and we hope, that something will be done for
this mirror of friendship. Before, he became king, it seems that he
sold "º. and we think that for this reason, and for his
piety, MR, HARPER XII trees might take him up, and give him some
washing powders to scour his country of enemies, France is, unluckily
intriguing against him, or his business might be hooked into the

No. 3.-From the Same to the Same.
We ſhave considered, and don't think, the Congress necessary. Neither the
Treaty of Westphalia nor that of Utrecht was revised at a Congress, and the
Treaty of Vienna is, mainly, in full force. However, the EMPEROR can let us know
exactly what he proposes to discuss, and whether we are to be bound to lick any
monarchs, who may not see things as the majority in Congress does. Keep, of
course, awfully civil.
1. No. 4.—DROUYN DE LHUys to DE CADORE.
We have nothing to say against the Treaty of Vienna; indeed the EMPEROR
has bound himself to observe all engagements, aſter which of course there can be
no doubt of his views. But we think it wants re-editing. We cannot, as the
youngest of Sovereigns, pretend to bind Congress, nor can we even sav for our-
selves, at present, whether we should feel inclined to fight or not. We should
like to overhaul Poland, Denmark, the Turkish provinces, Italy, and Rome.
No. 5.-RUSSELL to CowLEY.
We have nothing to gain or lose...We don't see that a Congress will set matters
square. Nobody will give up anything. We have been preaching to Russia for
ºonths about Poland, and have been snubbed. Would the Pof E recognise the
KING of ITALY Would Austria give up Venice? What have Spain and Turkey
to do with Denmark? And really, is it asked that, a Congress shall meet
about Mouldy–Wallachia? All bosh. But I shall be too happy to write despatches

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [DECEMBER 5, 1863.
A CRAWLING COURT-MARTIAL.
ITHouT reference to any
particular tribunal, (and
certainly without any in-
clination to deal lightly or
prematurely with a certain
inquiry involving a very
painful story) Mr. Punch,
always anxious to amend
the institutions of his
country, must say that he
does not see any reason for
expecting any termination
to the sittings of a Court-
Martial where proceedings
go on after this fashion:-
LIEUT. M'SABRETASH
recalled, and his examina-
tion in chief proceeded
with.
= . The President. Do you
= wish to qualify your last
answer, just read to you,
- in any way? -
- Yes; I should like to
say generally, that it
doesn't exactly express my
- - Imeanling.
Prosecutor. Well, what was your meaning?," -
Prisoner. I am advised, MR, PRESIDENT and gentlemen, that such a question
ought not to be put; but I will not oppose it if I am allowed to ask the witness a
preliminary question or two. - - -
The Court consulted for an hour, and then intimated that LIEUT. M'SABRE-
TAsh must explain his meaning. - - -
Lieut. M'Sabretash. But I did not mean anything in particular.
Prosecutor. State your meaning generally. . -
Lieut. M'Sabretash. Well, what I suppose myself to have meant, to imply was,
that foreign service is not exactly the same thing as home service, and—
The President. If that is meant as a reflection on the Horse Guards, and an alle-
gation that officers abroad do not receive the same consideration as officers at home,
#. no observation on the charge, but I cannot allow.it to be imported into
this case.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I desire to make myself clearly understood."
The Prisoner. I can have no objection to that. - -
Lieut. M'Sabretash. When an officer is fat (a ſconsiderablej distance from head-
uarters——
Q The Prosecutor. We should know? what you mean by considerable. It is an
elastic word, and therefore capable of various interpretations.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I bow to the Court, and beg to substitute for “a considerable
distance” the phrase “a good way.” I would then say that when an officer is a
good way from head-quarters, he is compelled to rely upon himself in a great
measure—
The Prisoner. I am advised, MR. PRESIDENT and gentlemen, that if a witness is
permitted to enter upon the moral position of an officer, it is competent to me to
i. evidence to show that the witness himself was not so moral as he should
ave been.
After an hour's discussion the Court came to the resolution that the prisoner's
demand was legitimate. He was therefore directed to cross-examine the witness.
Prisoner. You spoke of morals, LIEUT. M'SABRETASH?
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I spoke of nothing of the kind.
Prisoner. I am in the hands of the Court.
The President. The word moral was your own, but the Court considers it legiti-
mately applied to the position the witness was describing.
Prisoner. Then I ask the witness whether he considers himself a moral officer.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. Unquestionably.
Prisoner. I have to request that the Court will read the eleven volumes which I
now put in.
The eleven volumes consisted of the works of J. J. Rousse.AU, in French, small
type. The Court having read them, signified to the prisoner to go on.
Prisoner. I now ask LIEUT. M'SABRETASH whether he is not in the habit of
reading those volumes?
Lieut. M'Sabretash. Certainly not. I do not understand a word of French.
Prisoner. But they were ſound in your quarters.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I am glad of it, because I was afraid they were lost. They
belong to a brother officer who left them in my charge. I never opened one of them.
Prisoner. In that case, I withdraw this part of the examination, as I had intended
to show that an officer who reads RousseAU cannot be considered moral. But,
with apologies to the Court, I proceed, as advised, to ask LIEUT. M. SABRETAsh
whether, on the 11th of July, 1859, he did not suddenly hear of the marriage
of a friend ºf his, CoLoREL Pigskin NER.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I will not swear to the date, but I admit that the news
came to me as a surprise.
Prisoner. What were the remarks you made on hearing it?
Lieut. M'Sabretash. As it is four years ago, I decline to
undertake to say exactly.
Prisoner. Were they not to the effect that Colonel
PIGSKINNER was an everlasting ass?
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I cannot say. I may have formed,
in respect of CoLonEL PIGSKINNER, an opinion which
may have been crudely expressed by the language you use,
and I may retain such opinion.
Prisoner. But this, or something like it, was said in
reference to his having married.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I think it probable. -
Prisoner. You considered him an everlasting ass for
entering into the holy estate of matrimony. Yet you have
just said that you call yourself a moral officer.
The President. We, think a stop must be, put to this
line of cross-examination, and we now think that the time
has come for the witness to explain what he was going to
say when the prisoner claimed the right to interfere.
The Prosecutor. As it is seven hours ago, I will refresh
the witness's memory. He was saying that an officer when
lºway from head-quarters was compelled to rely upon
1mself.
Prisoner. I am advised, MR. PRESIDENT, that I am
entitled to ask the witness whether he is in the habit of
going to church? -
The Court deliberated, and decided that the question
should not be put.
The Prosecutor. The witness will proceed from “rely
upon himself.”
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I beg to ask the Court to give me a
few hours to recollect myself.
The Prisoner. I am advised, MR. PRESIDENT, to protest
against any such delay being accorded. An officer who is
accustomed to rely upon himself ought to be able to answer
i º: question without taking several hours to consider
is reply.
The President. There is great force in that observation,
but nothing as yet is before the Court to inform it, judicially,
that the witness was speaking of himself, or that he was
not describing the Service generally.
Prisoner. Then, MR. PRESIDENT, if the witness is allowed
to enter into a general description of the Service, I am
advised that it Wii be competent to me to bring forward
other descriptions of it, and I ask leave to put in a variety
of military novels, which I shall ask the Court to read.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. To save the time of the Court—
The President. The time of the Court is of no conse-
quence, and the Court will sit here until Christmas, if neces-
sary. Unless you have some better reason to assign for the
course which you intend to take, the Court will adjourn to
consider the prisoner's demand. -
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I beg to say that the officer I
described did mean myself, and that when a good way from
head-quarters, I was .. to rely upon myself.
Prisoner. Who compelled you? :
Lieut. M'Sabretash. Well, nobody in particular, but I
was compelled.
Prisoner. But somebody must have compelled you. To
compel is an active verb, as I am advised, and there must
be an actor. Who was the actor?
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I repeat that I cannot say that any-
body was. I use the words in the common acceptation of
being obliged.
Prisoner. But somebody must have obliged you.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. You never did, and I take this oppor-
tunity of º: that a more disobliging person I never met
with since I received HER MAJESTY's Commission.
The President. The question for the witness is not as to
his personal feeling towards the accused, nor as to the
grammatical construction of a sentence, but as to what he
meant by the answer he gave yesterday afternoon. He has
elected to go on, and will be good enough to do so.
Lieut. M'Sabretash. An officer, a good way from head-
lº. is compelled to rely upon himself to a great
egree
Prisoner. I am advised to request that this witness's
answer, No. 1174, be read to him.
This being done, it appeared that the witness's former
words were “rely upon himself in a great measure.” .
Prisoner. I j. not detain the Court, but merely point
out the contradiction.
The President. There is no contradiction. A degree is a
measure. - -
Prisoner. But I am advised that every measure is not a
degree. A yard measure, for instance. If that is held to

be a degree I shall ask leave to put in Guy's Geography and Use of the
Globes, which I shall ask the Court to read. - -
Lieut. M'Sabretash. I am willing to withdraw any expressions which
I have used. - - -
Prisoner. I am advised to protest against any such course being per-
mitted, but I also call attention to the extreme pliancy of the witness's
conscience.
At this stage of the proceedings, the Court, which had sat for eight
hours and a halſ, adjourned, announcing that in the morning its decision
would be given on the last objection urged by the prisoner.
RUSSIAN PASTIMES IN POLAND,
MR. PUNCH. " - - ".
The heart of every Russian sojourner in a strange, land has
been thrilled with enthusiasm by the subjoined telegram of REUTEB's,
showing how zealously our CzAR is served in Poland by his soldier-
hangmen, who know how to deal with rebels:-
“Iaxarius Sruszynski was shot at Warsaw on the 14th, at 10 A.M., on the glacis
of the citadel. The soldiers fired three times at the unfortunate man, and although
he was bathed in blood, not one of his wounds was mortal. The officer in command
then came close up to him and shot him with his revolver, but still without inflicting
a mortal wound. The victim was then thrown into a pit, and buried while still
alive.”
How delightful are these details of the punishment of a revolter
against the divine government of our Imperial Master! The pangs ºf
the traitor shot almost to death by degrees, and then buried alive, regale
the hearts of the children of Holy Russia, just as we conceive the doom
of the enemies of Heaven to afford a pleasing spectacle to the Saints.
And, oh! with whatrapture we loyal subjects of the mighty ALEXAN-
DER read such interesting statements as the following, in a letter from
Warsaw:—
“We expect every day to hear of the execution of two ladies who have been con-
demned to death—the Abbess of the Convent of the Sisters of St. Felix, and a lady
who took refuge in that convent. It appears that this execution is delayed by the
hesitation of the Government which wavers between its desire to terrorise women
and its fear of the indignation of Europe.”
Not so, however. The Government of the Supreme Ruler of all the
Russias despises the indignation of Europe. It will hang, or behead,
or shoot, or flog the Abbess of St. Felix and her protégée to death.-I
hope it will flog them to death—in its own good time. In the mean-
while I trust that they are continually tortured, to the glory of our
CzAR; and I derive the most exquisite gratification from imagining that
I hear their shrieks and survey their contortions.
The writer of the letter above-quoted goes on to say:—
“If these two women are executed, I am certain that two hundred more will be
found ready to share their fate.”
I sincerely hope they will share it. And when those two hundred
women have been executed, may their execution be speedily º
that of another two hundred. The more the merrier. It is, indeed,
flººrs to read, in connection with the foregoing, the further remark
at:- 4
“In spite of all the atrocities committed by MoURAvner F-the flogging of women
to death, the slow torture inflicted on FLohkowski, who was attached to the tail of
a horse in full gallop—these victims of Russian cruelty have found numerous suc-
cessors.”
“One down tºother come on,” as your people say. This must go on
till the Poles are either exterminated or crushed; I had rather see them
crushed, surviving as examples of the wrath and vengeance of Qur
CzAR. But, Sir, you love a joke—don't you see one in the description
of FLORKowski’s punishment as “slow torture,” whereas that criminal
was “attached to the tail of a horse in ſull gallop P” I call that fast
torture. Don’t you? Well, Mr. Punch, I know that our “Russian
cruelties,” as your newspapers call the chastisements inflicted by the
avenging angels MoURAVIEFF and DE BERG, exasperate the British,
and the French, and every “civilised nation.” Your execrations amuse
us. You, alone, cannot get at us, and we defy you. You can't trust
the French, you dread a Popish state established in the East of Europe.
Prussia is for us, the other Powers have separate interests, which
render any alliance against us impossible, so we snap our fingers at
you, and the more you cry out upon us the more we shall keep on
shooting, hanging, and torturing the Poles right and leſt, and flogging
Polish #. to death. With sentiments of esteem for CoBDEN and
BRIGHT, the friends of our friends the Yankees, our allies in the event
of a war with England, accept the assurance of my supreme contempt
for that public opinion which has no arm long enough to reach, without
catching, A TARTAR.
P.S. What sport our gibbets and scourges in Poland must afford the
spirit of the blessed Nicholas !
A Ghost we should LIKE ExcessiveLY TO SEE.-The Ghost of
Crinoline.
HOW, WHEN AND WHERE P
OR, THE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
UNLESs the Tourist is going to somewhere else, he will not pursue the
Lauterbrunnen Road any farther, Qn his return to the hotel at Inter-
lachen, the pedestrian will probably be inclined to walk into his dinner.
The real economist, by the way, will never live en pension. It sounds very
mice; only six, ſtancs a day for everything ' You agree and commence,
let us say, with breakfast. Being an Englishman, and accustomed to
make rather a substantial affair of your first meal in the day, you are
somewhat surprised when the waiter brings you a small coffee-pot
holding about a cupfull and a half, a diminutive and ačrial looking
French roll, one small thin pat of butter, and a kind of large earthen-
ware sall-cellar filled with lump-sugar. It is true that whatever is
deficient in bread and butter is certainly made up to you in saccharine
nutriment; but, eke it out as you will, this is hardly a substitute for
the fish, meat and eggs of the domestic table. The guileless traveller
will probably call the waiter, and order, a couple of eggs and some more
bread. At midday the simple Simon will further command a light repast,
and, while enjoying himself with a cold collation, will say to a friend,
“Capital idea this, you know; I’m living en pension; only six francs
a day, and it includes everything.” The ſriend, being perhaps unwillin
to disturb this blissful state of ignorance, will perhaps say in a tone 9
surprise, “Oh, does it?” If the Tourist be of a fidgety, turn, he will
repeat these words to himself in his friend's absence in the form of
an inquiry as to “what’s he mean by ‘oh does it?” The explanation,
which will be given in the bill at the end of the week, will probably
cause the simple one to lengthen his face and shorten his stay.
“Why,” says the indignant gentleman, “I thoughten pension included
everything, and here (emphatically slapping the little account) I find eggs
charged extra.”
“Yes, M'sieu,” explains the polite garçon, “but M'sieu, must un-
derstand that everything in an en pension sense means only the regula-
tion breakfast provided by the hotel. Some coffee, a little bread, some
milk, some sugar, is everything that—”
“But—surely—Eggs—you know—” gasps the Tourist.
“Ah! M'sieu, eggs are not everything.”
And so the Tourist having learnt that, as at home so abroad, “Eggs
is Eggs,” and that the comprehensive Everything often means almost
Nothing, packs up his portmanteau and returns to England a wiser and
a sadder man. But he mustn't pack, and he mustn't go back, until he
has seen the sights round about Interlachen; unless indeed his econo-
mical living en pension has rendered his departure an inevitable necessity.
Seek then the Lake of Brienz and the
Giessbach Falls. If you are a member of
the Alpine Club you will take your way
to the Lake of Brienz by ascending the
Faulhorn and walking along a pleasant
footpath which cannot be, attempted
without a guide; so take this present
number with you, and there’ll be nothing
to fear. When on a dizzy height or a
dangerous pass, such as the one first men-
tioned, never look down at the depths below
you; such a proceeding is fraught, with
danger: on the other hand, you will find
that the method, practised by some, ºf
invariably keeping your eyes steadfastly
fixed on the sky, is not entirely without
its own, peculiar disadvantages. The
woods (about the Giessbach, Falls offer
many charms to the naturalist. Here the
rare hen Cockey.olly Bird pipes her tune-
ful lay; a peculiar note it is, and speci-
mens of this Ornithological curiosity may
be seen in the Lowther Arcade, the Pan-
theon, and the German Bazaar.
In Switzerland the Physiologist will
notice the glorious type of Face, immor-
talised by the carvers of wooden match-
boxes, nutmeg-graters, and ornamental
paper knives. The searcher after Physi- -
cal Facts may try to ascertain if their heads come off; but we believe
they do not, as a rule; still there’s no harm in making the experiment,
if agreeable to the peasant.
Strict Impartiality.
So strictly are the laws against smoking carried out at Windsor
Castle, that the very chimneys have received intimation from the Lord
ChambetºlaiN that they will be expected for the future to consume
their own smoke. It will thus be seen that not the least partiality is
shown, high or low.

THE WIRE FENCE."
(Dedicated to those Farmers and others in the Shires, who use that treacherous and unsportsmanlike contrivance.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-You carry your years so well, Ineed not remind
yOu º: many of them have elapsed, since you and I were undergraduates
together.
ou were a moderate weight, my old friend, before you married, and
a hard-goer, particularly over the mahogany, you cannot deny it. Don't
you remember how Garry Lloyd swore when you jumped upon him in
the Ripley brook? Ab —Time has rusted our spurs since then, but
you have still doubtless a ſellow-feeling for the º; ones, and take an
interest even now in the frolics of the flyers and the ſun of the field.
Well, my dear Mr. Punch, I gather from what I hear, that these
adventurous young men are in a sad taking this winter, that they con-
template their favourite horses with no pleasure, and are scarcely in
sufficient spirits to study the fit of their leathers and the setting-on of
their tops; they vibrate with delight no longer at the hounds’ challenge
or the huntsman's horn, and have altogether lost the neck-or-nothing
dash, which makes youth so enviable, and elevates the “beggar on
horseback” into something like a hero for the time.
“In short these funk, who never funked before,
And those who always funked, now funk the more.”
Not without reason either! as I think you will admit when I tell you
: ºtion I overheard at the next table to mine only last night
at my Ulub.
I was just peeping into a second pint of port after a light dinner
which you may imagine for yourself, when two hungry young men,
whose names I ascertained from the waiter to be MR SPARKLEs, of
somewhere in Cheshire, and CAPTAIN BRUSH, of the Hindoo Hussars,
entered on the following conversation:—
Brush, (loquitur). It’s no use, old fellow, the ºf: about over
º; and I’m very much afraid that wire fencing will put an end to
Our ſun.
Sparkles. But won't they take them down? I hear there's a Cir-
cular signed by every swell in England, going round all the hunting
Counties, entreating the farmers, for their own sakes, to leave off break-
ing all our necks.
Brush. If they don't, it’s all up, you may take your oath. It don't
matter to me, for I’m going back to India, and can fall back upon pig-
sticking; but it’s a bore for you fellows “who live at home at ease.”..
Sparkles. I meant to have bought a horse of one of my tenants this
week, but it’s no use having horses if one can’t ride straight, and I
daren’t for one, when every second fence is made a certainty. .
Brush. Have they ever got you?
Sparkles , (vehemently.) No l—and I’ll take care they never do.
Why it makes it about the most dangerous thing out.
Brush. The devil doubt ye, my boy, I found that out last season. I
was riding old Superb, you know my good old horse Superb by Tarquin,
the one that follows me about and puts his nose in my pocket. He’s
a good horse, and a bold one. Well, he was carrying me like a brick,
for I’d got a good start, and been lucky and all that, when I rode him
at a thickish place out of a large grass field without pulling him off his
stride, for the hounds were running like smoke. I can't help fancying
the old horse thought there was something up by the way he cocked his
ears, and went at it as if he'd eat it., Poor old boy! he never saw the
CURSED wire, how should he? and though he jumped an awful distance,
and let ºne off, he landed with his stomach on it and cut himself all to
ribbons. If he’d been a brute, he’d have broken my neck! I tell ye
the odds ain’t fair. I shall cut it in my small way. That’s neither here
northere, but when the great guns have all sold their horses, and the
swell packs are all given up, and there’s, no more hunting to be had,
why the country won't be much, fun in the winter, and I’m afraid a
: many poor devils will find themselves out of work and out of
bread.
This was obviously a long speech for the young soldier, and the waiter
łº at the moment with two tin-covered portions from the joint
(haunch of South-down kept to an hour), the subject was discontinued and
not again resumed... I could trace, however, a cloud upon SPARKLEs's
fair young brow, during the rest of his repast. He was, obviously
thoughtſul and ill at ease. His season I, fear is spoilt, his money
wasted, and there can be no question, he will refuse to buy his tenant's
horse, Can you not put in a word for these young ſellows, my kind old
friend ? Wire fences are certainly unnecessary in the winter, and
might easily be lifted in the hunting-season, and replaced, if required,

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
on May-day. . How would you have liked it yourself, when you used to
lead the whole University on Smoke-Jack?. Fancy riding.gaily at a
fence and never finding out a wire had been placed just four feet beyond
it till you got up with a very confused notion of locality, a broken
collar-bone, a crushed hat, and poor Smoke-Jack on three legs for the
rest of the season. Manyagood fellow may be dangerously hurt, and many
a gallant horse cruelly mauled, though I think in my heart, from what I
observed last might, that come w at may, “they won't get SPARKLEs!”
I remain, dear Mr. Punch, with the utmost respect, your old and
attached friend, LUCIUs LAMBSwool.
THE GAME OF NOVICE IN MARGARET STREET,
onomia, DEAREST, Now croquet is over
for the season, there is no game that I
know of to beat that of Roman Catholics.
You must enjoy it much at Claydon with
such capital players as MR. DRURY and
º, Father IGNATIys, and the other Monks
who perform Monks' tricks so cleverly in
the Church. We had a capital game here the other day, at All Saints
Margaret Street—played at Nuns–EMILY took the white veil an
vows for nyear. It was so nice; all in church: the altar all decked
out with flowers, and covered with white satin, and the postulant also
in white, dressed as a bride, in a lovely, wedding-dress, orange flowers
and everything complete; and what with a little artificial colour, in her
cheeks, which would otherwise have been rather too pale, she looked
so pretty—as we all said, “beautiful for ever.” -
Well, and then you know the candles on the altar were lighted, and
the service performed quite like a real mass-nobody but a regular
Roman Catholic could have told the difference, and the CARDINAL
himself would have been some time in finding it out. And so then
EMILY was questioned, and had to say that she was going to take the
vows of her own free will; and then she took them for a year; and the
Sisters all said, “Bless thee, Sister URSULA1* and that wicked wretch,
Bob WILLIERs, who was asked, whispered close behind me, “Bless thee,
thou art translated l’” And then URSULA, that is EMILY that was,
curtsied to the Lady Superior, and to the Father, who performed the
service, and a splendid Father our Clergyman made. Just then, while
the choir was singing Jubilate, we were so frightened by an idle school-
boy who poked his head in at the door, and cried out—“Cavy', the
Bishop’s coming.” When the ceremony was all over, we went to
breakfast; a regular wedding breakfast, you know, bridecake and
everything; and I kept a bit of the cake and put it under my pillow,
and dreamt of kissing the Pope's toe... We had such fun; pulled
crackers with the Father with Church mottoes enclosed; so good, some
of them, and WILLIERs was so, agreeable, but made himself such a
oose. He said he must kiss the bridemaids—and did! And what
o you think! He advised me to work the Father a pair of slippers
inlaid with glass beads inside the soles, and to embroider him a hair
shirt. The creatue suggested that we might find the materials off
our own heads. -- -
Everything went off so micely., EMILY's friends are in mourning
for her, as she is supposed to be dead to the world; her sisters look
well in black. The nunnery she goes into is attached to the Church,
and as much as possible like a real one I believe in discipline, whipping
and all. If EMILY finds all this too much of a joke, she can give it up
at the end of the year.
For further particulars see the Western Morning News. Write soon,
and be sure you tell me all about dear Father IGNATIUs. I wonder if
he will really keep his vows of celibacy? That dreadſul WILLIERs says
that perhaps Puseyism in sport will become Popery in earnest. What
a shame of him Believe me, dearest, ever yours,
Belgravia, December, 1863. ETHEL.
P.S. He has just called, in a white hat with black crape round it—
says it is ſor EMILY, and calls it butcher's mourning.
A MOTHER ON SMOKE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I AM very partial to country newspapers, and I believe that
most women are. You see nothing in the London papers except politics,
and long trials, and bursting ARMSTRONG guns, and quarrelling about
drainage. But in a good country paper you get column after column of
real news, nice little stories, and such information about the QUEEN and
the Princesses and other great people as you never can find in London
newspapers. I would sooner go without all of them than my own
º iºnal, which my sister sends me up weekly in exchange for
my Punch.
Well, in this week's county paper, I find this, Mr. Punch:—
“SMoRING Now-A-Days.-A You Ng THIRF.—Thomas Jones, of Oswestry, a boy
eleven years of age, was charged with stealing seven ounces of tobacco, the property
of the Great Western Railway Company. A policeman testified to finding the
tºbacco upon him, and it seems that he stole it to smoke with another boy. He
pleaded guilty. , Sentenced to be confined for the remainder of the day and once
whipped with nine strokes of a birch rod.”
Now, Mr. Punch, Idare say that if I had been on the bench of justice,
as they call it, I should have given this bad boy a§. scolding, and let
him off, for I see that he cried, and said he would not do it again. I
am sure I should, in fact, if the stealing a little tobacco, which I dare
say was going to the shop of some cheating cigar-seller, had been the
only thing. . If he had stolen it to give it to his father or somebody
else, I could not have allowed him to be much punis though of
course I am not defending stealing, and I would certainly have had
him locked up for the rest of the day, and let him have nothing but
cold meat and a very little beer for his dinner. But he stole the nasty
tobacco to smoke it, and now that the affair is all over, and as I did
not know that he was going to be whipped, I think I am glad of it,
though I hope he was not much hurt. It is perſectly shocking, Mr.
Punch, to see children of eleven, twelve, fourteen, and sixteen smoking
away at pipes and cigars as they do. When I see them in the street I
feel inclined to snatch away the tobacco, and throw it into the gutter
and say, “You little wretch, how dare you ruin your health, and stint
your growth in that way?” The doctors agree that though tobacco ma
not do a º man much harm (it only makes him a pig, and I wis
ou, could see the Utrecht velvet of my dining-room chairs after my
usband and a friend or two have had a smoky evening—and then the
price of cigars is perfectly wicked), it is most deleterious to young per-
sons, and the use of it ought to be put down by law. I am not at all
sure that the same punishment that MASTER THOMAs Jones received
would not be avery good thing for any little boy smoking, and as for the
bigger ones, they should be shut up to do the most severe Impositions.
I wish you would take up the subject, and prevent the rising generation
from being a stunted, sickly, sallow, surly, cigar-sucking set of stupids.

THE WIND DID IT.
MR. PUNCH stated, the other day, in conversation with his friend the
EMPEROR NAPOLEoN, that as to the Japanese affair EARL Russell had
an explanation to offer which would be quite satisfactory to all persons
without prejudice. LORD CLARENCE PAGET has since been permitted
to make this explanation, and anything more entirely satisfactory can
hardly, be, conceived. It is “the sweetest thing out.” We were
obliged to bombard PRINCE SATsUMA, in sheer self-defence, for he had
fired on us while inoffensively stealing his steamboats. We bombarded
accordingly, meaning only the slaughter of his men and the destruction
of his forts. But the Wind was thoughtless enough to get up, and
the sea-it is an awkward way it has—knows i.". than to get
agitated by the wind, and qur vessels shook and swayed about so that
it was quite impossible to direct our fire very carefully, and Kagosima,
a city of 180,000 people, was totally destroyed. Really no person of
ordinary candour and civility can say a word on the subject, aſter this
explanation; and if the Japanese bear any malice when they have read
our apology, it will show that they are savages, and unworthy of the
consideration of gentlemen. Still, if they like, they can, talk to the
Wind, which is indeed the last court of appeal for savages who have
complaints to make of over-ardent advances on the part of civilisation.

SIR,
BEING accustomed to receive numerous
invitations to dine, which are the only invitations
I ever ºp' allow me to suggest, for the in-
struction of persons who practise hospitality,
and the convenience of those whom they wish to
enjoy it, that, whenever º ask anybody to
dinner, they should enclose him, a bill of fare.
Esteeming and regarding my friends everyone
alike, and taking an equal pleasure in the society
of all those who are good to me, I should by that
means be enabled readily to decide what I now
often find a question of distressing difficulty,
namely, out of a number of houses where my com-
pany is requested on the same day, which to go
to. One can't write to all one's friends who ask
one to dinner, and say, “What are you going to
have?”—because that would look as if one's
regard for them were the sort of attachment
vulgarly called “cupboard love.” But if they
had any delicacy they would spare one the neces-
sity of making that inquiry, by letting one know
what delicacies they proposed to give him. Pray,
Sir, publish the hint which may induce them to
do so, and which, if it does, will be pronounced
one of the best things that have ever appeared in
Punch, by all who are such judges of good things
as your constant reader APIC[US.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
DEAR PUNCH,
I Wonder, is a play the more attractive to the public because
a score or two of swells have chanced to go and see it? One would
think a man went to a play because he wished to see it, and not
because he heard that peers and peeresses had seen it. Yet in many a
playbill now-a-days I see a puff protruded about some whiff of “royal
patronage” which has been waſted to the house, and scraps from some
Court Journal are paraded underneath, to show how many noble swells
have recently attended there.
If the fact that H. R. H. & Co., have * to see a play be regarded
as a critical opinion of its merits, would it not be well to state with
what parts chiefly H.R. H. & Co. were pleased, that the loyal British
playgoer might learn how to applaud where Royalty applauded. For
instance, were a farce to be advertised in this way, it might be said that
R. H. was graciously pleased to smile no less than twice in the first
scene, while LADY GIGGLETON was seen to snigger six times in the
second, and LoRD HAwe HAwe roared with laughter, all throughout
the piece, and for twenty minutes after the falling of the curtain. Or
were a pathetic drama to be puffed, the playbill-wright should gauge
the flood of tears that nightly overflowed the stalls, and state how
many peeresses were borne out fainting every evening, and how many
cambric handkerchiefs were nightly wetted through and through by
every Royal person in the Royal box.
While thus speaking of the Peerage and their patronage of the
drama, my thoughts are naturally directed to the Duke and his Motto,
now turned into the opera of “La Dame Blanche”—de Nevers. MR.
BALFE has had no easy task to set the play to music, and critics who
complain of the shortcomings of his work should be reminded of the
difficulties he has had to fight with. To my thinking, an opera should
have a simple, easily intelligible story, for music is adapted more to
give expression to passionate emotion than to portray the subtle phases
of a mazy and misty plot. Moreover, when a drama is turned into an
opera, people who have seen the one are apt to be dissatisfied, a little
with the other; for the singers miss the points which were made much
of by the actors, and the libretto sadly mars the neatness of the play.
But MR. BALFE, has done his best in what he had to do, and people
who like music will enjoy much of his opera, in spite of the fatigue of
hearing the encores which the clacqueurs of the music-shops are able
to demand. The quartette in the first act is to mythinking }. prettiest
morceau (is that the right word, Mr. Critic?) in the opera, and the
night when I was present it was sung extremely well. Indeed, the
singers all have done their best" to aid the composer, and the opera
is mounted as well as any foxhunter could wish himself to be. Musicians
who remember the shabby sort of way with which poor English Opera
was treated by the managers some twenty years ago; the scrimpiness
and scrubbiness of the scenery and chorus, whose faces were in general
as dingy as their dresses; should surely vote their thanks to the
Covent Garden Management, which in producing a new opera spares
neither trouble nor expense.
The Ticket of Leave Man still continues to do, well at the Olympic,
and has reached uninterruptedly its hundred-and-sixtieth night. This
success in chief degree is owing to its author, ſor the piece is written
carefully, the characters are natural, and the interest is sustained with
more than common skill. Moreover, it is acted evenly and well, with
less staginess and straining than in most plays of the sort. I notice,
though, in certain of the smaller parts, a tendency to this; and as the
F. depends in a great measure on its naturalness, this error should
e checked. What was said when Black-eyed Susan first achieved its
run should be borne in mind as being a wise warning on this point:-
“The minor theatres, although of late they have made great progress,
can never hope fairly to compete with the larger establishments, until
the practice indulged in by actors of verbally improving the author, and
thus in fact becoming rather improvvisatori than performers, is abolished.
No matter how irrelevant, how marring, how coarse be the ſancied joke,
if the sixpenny critic laugh, the actor-wag is satisfied, little thinking
how much he suffers in the mute condemnation of the discerning, and
who indeed may embrace in their wide censure the innocent author,
who probably has º though vainly remonstrated against the
offensive interpolation, which is to him at once an insult and an injury,
and a fatal sign of mediocrity in ‘the fool that uses it.’”
The little Opera di Camera at the Gallery of Illustration I think is
better worth a hearing than many larger works. In these days of
universal tum-tuming and too-tooing, chamber music is of course well
known to connoisseurs, and less instructed ears have lately learned to
like it at the pleasant “Monday Pops.” A chamber opera however
in England is quite new, and, judging by the specimen which MR.
GERMAN REED has lately introduced to us, there seems reason for
believing that the plant, though not a native here, will flourish on our
soil. A prettier little opera than this same Jessy Lea I think that even
the Italians will not easily invent, and I feel sure that Donizetti would
have commended the nice taste with which his sweet Elisir has been
composed afresh. The music is so pleasing that one's ears do not get
tired of it (who could ever tire of Miss Poole's singing P) and the
smack of amateurism about the three new vocalists, to my mind,

rather heightens than impairs the effect of a slight work which is

FURTHER FROM THE SPIRIT OF SHAKSPEARE.
(To the Worshipful Master Punch.)
RIGHT WoRTHY,
GHosts now-a-days are admitted to so much fuller and easier
speech of living men and women than they were in the days of good
UEEN Bess, that you must not marvel if I address you in the fashion
of your times rather than my own.
Ghosts were ghosts when I lived, and comported themselves with
gravity. I have tried to show one on the Boards, as I knew him, and
you may gauge the distance between embodied spirits in the seventeenth
and in the nineteenth century, by comparing my Ghost of Hamlet's
Father with the rapping ghosts who come at the call of Messrs. Home
and Howitt, MRs. DENNET or MRs. HAYDoN.
Of a truth I prefer the old style of ghost, and though I did lately try
the effect of a few raps on you, I found the process so slow (to say
nothing of the company elbowing me), that I was minded to make my
next communication through the post. We spirits are allowed pen
ink, and paper, and the post-office arrangements between our world an
yours are excellent.
I hold it well to enlarge a little on the subject of my late message to
you, whereinl said a good theatre would be the best monument to my
memory.
Of course in revisiting the glimpses of the moon, I often bend my
steps to London. I like to hover about my old haunts, the Bankside
and Blackfriars, and the Bear Garden, and to amuse myself by noting
the wonderſul changes that two centuries and a-half have made in men
and things. I visit the theatres, and marvel at the many huge and
splendid homes of the Drama that have replaced my poor old Globe and
Fortune, the Red Bull and the Curtain: to compare the stately scenes
that have succeeded our ragged traverses and curtains; the well-trained,
well-clad, and bravely appointed crowds, which stand for the five or six
ragged serving men, who in my day did duty for mobs, courts and armies.
have seen my own plays right royally apparelled, nobly housed, set in
grand frames, with fair backgrounds, but of the chief personages
therein, and their enacting—well—I have seen nought—of late days at
f|live, to hold the ears, and exercise the
least—to make me forget Dick BURBAGE, and my LoRD LEICESTER’s
men, his and my fellows, who strutted and bellowed, when I was in the
flesh, and trod the Boards with them. -
With all this, I have an embodied spirit's privilege to hear the critic's
complaints, and note the taste of the public. There is free passage for
me to managers' rooms and authors’ studies. I list to critics, and
authors of plays that cannot find their way to the stage, bitter in
denunciation of the scurvy brainless stuff brought out by your managers
and swallowed by your playgoers. I am doomed to overhear that my
own plays will not bring money unless it be as stately shows, or unless
some actor or actress from over sea bring to them the graces of a
foreign accent, and a French delivery. Many use my name as though it
were a spell or a heal-all; calling for “ShakspeaRE!” “SHAKSPEARE!”
as if my plays could change the tide of a people's taste, and bring back
to the theatre all I found or made there. Methinks, it would be
strange iſ, when all is changing, stage plays should stand still: if the
fashion of writing, the subjects, the manner I essayed with my co-mates
and copyists were to be the rule for all that came after us. I changed
º from what they were before my time, and I ever looked to see
ike change made when I should hold the Boards no more. But under
all outward changes, some things that go to a play, in my conceit of it,
methought should never die, or plays must too—to wit, true
thought, sweet or stately music of well-fitted speech, stirring and noble
action, deep passion, or kindly mirth and merriment. These make up
the tenure by which stage-playing and play-writing use the right to
- rains of men. Groundlings
there will everbe; and of such I had enow, methinks, in my lifetime.
Needs was I should tickle their ears by word-play and clownish
fº from which, but for pleasing them, I had adly refrained me.
was manager as well as play-writer, and if the fools brought grist to
my mill, they must be drawn in as well as the wise and the witty.
If, now, I say that the best monument to SHAKSPEARE would be a
theatre where good plays would be well and worthily put forth, think
not I would claim for myself or my fellows of the past sole hold, or
chiefhold of its stage. Every good play—be it writinyerse or prose,
be its characters kings or beg clowns, or courtiers, be its time in
the past or the present—may claim kin with the * of my writing,
and admission to a theatre devoted to my honour. Nay, rather such
plays are most akin to mine as are fullest of the living spirit of their
time, and most in tune with the hearts and pride of Englishmen... I
but ask for high and true thought, well-graced speech, and living
action; season these with what mirth you will—as all life is seasoned
with mirth—and they will like me all the better. Give me but, stuff
worthy to hold the ears of grown men, and not mere ape's tricks, or
show of painted wizards with no brains behind them, or piling up of
cunningly contrived engines, such as old BEN Jonson and MASTER
INIGo JöNEs were wont to quarrel over at Whitehall or Theobald's.
These toys may do well for a court-masque, or to follow, solider stage
meat, as cooks after beef serve devices of º and marchpaine.
But keep them to that. Let my theatre stay the stomach ºf its guests
with solider and manlier fare—holding the mirror up to Nature, and
showing the body of the time its true form and pressure.
Were the money about to be raised for amonument to me, used for the
support of such a theatre as this—men of fair fame, sound knowledge,
sufficient experience, and true love of stage-plays, being chosen to
administer it, with a fitting manager—such a one as old. Edwarn
ALLEYNE, or BURBAGE–to do the work under them-my spirit would
have a pleasanter haunt for its nights in London than it has now. But
you will ask me, what need of applying other money to this, than men
will be found willing to devote out of their own purses?. If the people
will come to see such plays—methinks I hear it said—they will make
profitable the theatre where they are acted. If they will not, to what
end strive to keep up by draughts from alien pouches that, which in
the end, must needs languish and fall?
This were true enough, were it not that you have in some sort a
taste to create—a people to draw from high-spiced or windy meats to
solider simpler fare—and the sore temptation—was I not myself a
manager?—of the day's profit, needed to meet the day's charge. The
moneys thus held in trust for my theatre would be a stay and a
stand-by-what your scriveners now-a-days call a reserve fund,-to be
drawn on, till its fair ſame was spread and grounded, till its actors
were trained and taught, till the public was slowly won to worthier
stage-fare than is put before them now. But this once done, throw
away the corks, in Heaven's name, and let my theatre sink or swim.
If it sink e'en let it, and leave me without a monument, other than
my printed plays and my tomb. But methinks it would not, sink.
And if it swam, my name would swim with it-swim as I would have
it, on the ark that floated the art I loved and lived for.
With this I commend my cause to your fair keeping and rest Master
Punch's true servant to command in all worthy service,
WILL SHAKSPEARE.

ment, during certain repairs, there was lately written up the generous

We allude to it only that it, may be—on authority—trampled down,

that Lord STANLEY of Alderley, the Post Master General, is “very
jealous of his name,” as a nobleman ought to be. . Further, that divers
of Her Majesty’s subjects congregate and dwell, in large numbers, at a
place called Alderley Edge, and naturally, if impudently, require postal
convenience for their large correspondence. That the LoRD STANLEY
of Alderley does not like this Alderley Edge, and considers that it takes
a liberty with his name in becoming more notorious than his own
Alderley. Therefore, as Post Master, he marks his sense of the rude-
ness of the Edge by causing its many letters to be sent through a Fº
which hath but few letters, to the detriment and inconvenience of the
Edgers. Now this is a wild and wondrous tale, and LoRD STANLEY of
Alderley will, we dare say, be down at No. 85, Fleet Street, in an hour
from the appearance of this paragraph, to assure us that the story is
simply another of the Starfish's objectionable canards. Still, we shall
be very glad to see him, and though he is only a Post Office official, we
shall ask him to sit down, and offer him all the hospitalities. And we
should like the edge taken off this Edgy Story.

How, when, AND WHEREP
OR, THE MODERN TOURIST'S GUIDE TO THE CONTINENT.
HE Tour is finished. From Antwerp to Interlachen
has been done, and nothing now remains but to
quit. “To those whom Providence has blessed
with affluence,” we say, winter at Rome, and
as, in that case the present Guide must unfortu-
nately be absent, let one general piece of advice
be given and acted upon; namely, ““Do” at
Rome; as they “do” at Rome.”
If an intelligent and enlightened Protestant
be on your guard; such is the ecclesiastical
tyranny in this ancient city, that every waiter
in your hotel is obliged to take orders, and you
may look upon each one of them as a Jesuit in
disguise. Visit the hotel kitchen and in the man
cook behold a Friar. Being accustomed to see
the notice, “You are requested to take off your
hat,” stuck up in your own St. Paul's, you will
make a point of keeping it on, there being no
such requirement in St. Peter's. . -
Pooh-pooh everything that is not strictly
English, and show your own, superiority over the
poor superstitious Italians by talking loudly in
the churches, and criticising in , any terms of
artistic slang with which you may be acquainted,

of the ancient Proverb will strike anyone aſter a
walk round the City, viz., that “Rome was not
built in a day.” We must not, however, forestall
a future trip; so if you be bound Romewards,
our paths lie in opposite directions. Farewell.
Homewards, to the coast; and we have nearly
reached the end, at all events the Ost-end, of our
journey. . And now, to occupy the time taken up
in retracing much of the old ground, we will
request the Traveller's attention to a few parting
remarks, the result of our own personal experi-
ence, which we will call—

invented a portable bath of that flexible material.
It was capable of being reduced to the size of an ordinary table
napkin when ſolded up, and might be carried in the tail coat pocket
with as much ſacility as a pocket-handkerchief. There were, and ever
will be, a few disadvantages accompanying this ingenious contrivance.
The first is,.. that supposing you’ve got it with you, everyone in the
carriage begins sniffing, and observing that there is “a strong smell
of india-rubber somewhere.” If you are nervous or bashful this is
unpleasant. If you are neither one nor the other, you will say, “Dearme,

rubber.
This bath was fitted up with a brazen mouth-piece, which rendered it
a somewhat unpleasant companion in the hinderpockets of any traveller,
who, forgetful of his treasure, was in the habit of impulsively jumping
into railway carriages and sitting down sharply. When required for
use, you had to sit down on the floor of your room, cross-legged like a
tailor, and applying your lips to the aforesaid mouth-piece, blow
into it with the vigour of at least three professional players sustaining
a note *. the gay bassoon. When we first travelled we purchased
one of these curiosities, intending to go over the wide world like a
cleanly DIOGENES.. The tale of our tub was brought to a sudden and
unexpected conclusion. It was, if we recollect right, at St. Gorshausen,
that, while we, orientally squatting as above-mentioned, were engaged
In filling our bath with air, the intelligent waiter entered our room, and
on seeing our undignified occupation, paused, stuttered out an apology
and quickly retired, leaving the door partly open. Now to get up and
shut this door would have been, under the circumstances a waste of
breath, and therefore as we had still a cheerful half hour’s “blow”
before us, we preferred keeping our seat. In a few minutes a
shuffling of feet in the passage and a sort of “hush-hush-hushing”
chorus, madeus aware of the presence of the landlord, landlady, his two
daughters, and other members of the establishment, not being otherwise
engaged, who were stealthily peeping into the room. Our host, on
observing that we stopped and probably appeared somewhat angry,
stepped forward, and by way of apology informed me, that “he and his
family were very musical: and so, hearing that the English gentleman
was just going to play a tune upon quite a new kind of instrument, they
had taken the liberty of being present at the performance.” This had
evidently been the report of the imaginative and artistic waiter. “My
daughters,” continued the landlord, “have a piano in the house, and
would accompany you with pleasure. Does the English gentleman play
by ear or from notes?”. Aſter an explanation of the real use of the
machine, we were evidently considered as a harmless lunatic; an opinion
shared in by everybody except the Boots, upon whose shoulders was
thrown the onerous duty of regularly every morning during my week's
stay, bringing two buckets ſull of water up to my room, six flights
of stairs above the level of the first landing. He went through the
work for three days, but on the fourth morning, he, for we have no
moral doubt that he it was, wreaked his miserable vengeance upon
us. On the previous afternoon he had cut a hole in the bottom of the
bath. . Of course there was no one who could, or if they could, would,
mend it. His vengeance was complete; for as a bath of some sort was
a necessity, we had to take those at the bottom of the house, fitted up
in its foundations, to which we had to descend exactly eight flights
of stairs. But we were fertile inexpedients for torturing the malicious
menial; so we made him come up the usual six flights to fetch our
sponge, soap, towels, and hair-brushes; descend eight flights following
us on our way to the bath; and finally, when we had finished our ablu-
tions, he was summoned to ascend the eight flights, bearing the afore-
said requisites back again, to our chamber. "We had lost our pet luxury,
and now began our travels in search of a tub, with what success shall
be hereafter shown.

288 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[DECEMBER 12, 1863.
*Two TALES OF
Aft
SERJEANTPARRY.
THE QUEEN'S BENCH.
CIRCUMSTANCE over which Mr.
Punch had no control compelled
him to be present in the Court
of Queen Victoria's Bench the
other morning at the unplea-
santly early houroften. Having,
therefore, to get up in the mid-
idle of the night, that is to say
at 8:30, A.M., he drove down to
Westminster Hall, in a bad cab
and a worsetemper, which latter
was in a very slight degree im-
proved by his finding all the
seats occupied, either by coun-
sel, or by the singularly frowsy
and disreputable-looking Public
which haunts the courts of jus-
tice, and makes them smell of
bad rum. He had his own
reasons for not going round
to the Lord Chief Justice's
private room, taking his Lord-
ship's arm-chair, dragging it into
court, and placing it next to
the Judge; though had he done
so, there is no doubt that SIR
ALEXANDER would have been
much pleased. Mr. Punch pre-
ferred to stand close to the jury-
box (into which, if the public
must be told, he expected to be
invited at a later date, but,
happily, was not) where he had
excellent profile views of MR.
Montagu'CHAMBERs and MR.
Briefly observing that he thinks the arrangements of this court
and every other, as regards accommodation for jurymen of the Future, as perfectly
beestly, and indignantly asking why an intelligent and elegant-minded juryman is
to stand and
besqueezed in an evil-smelling crowd, while folks who
we no
earthly business in the place, and who are evidently unmitigated Duffers, have all
the lofty and comfortable seats, he proceeds with his affecting narrative.
He arrived in time to be in at the death of a case which had occupied the Court
for severaldays. Two respectable medical men, Doctors
FRASER and ANDRews, had been persecuted during that
time for doing, in the most professional as well as the most
humane manner, their duty in reference to a female called
SYMM, who had taken to drinking, and had been a sufferer
from delirium tremens. This woman had been advised,
very wrongly, to drag her medical benefactors into a court
of law, and to try to prove that they had ill-treated her.
MR. SERJEANT PARRY tore the wretched case to pieces
with his accustomed energy and skill, and Mr. Punch had
the satisfaction of hearing SIR ALExANDER Cockburn sum
up with a lucidity which that learned Judge, if fortunate
enough to catch the expression in Mr. Punch's eye, must
have seen afforded him great satisfaction. The jury instantly
found a verdict for the Doctors-defendant. Mr. Punch was
almost as much pleased at this as at finding that the British
Themis did not want him that day, and he fought his way
out of court, cheering like one o'clock, which it was, by Big
BEN REDIvivus.
Now these two Doctors, for doing their duty by the
woman SYMM, have not only been aspersed and persecuted,
but have been put to very heavy expense in defending them-
selves. There must be an awfully long law-bill to pay. Con-
sidering that a Doctor ought not to be fined for showing
courage, skill, and humanity in a difficult and painful
case, Mr. Punch rejoices to read in the Lancet that a sub-
scription list has been opened at the office of that journal,
in order to aid these gentlemen in paying their lawyers.
With such names as those of DR. Forbes Winslow, Ma.
ERNEST HART, DR. SIBson, and MR. Fergusson at the
head of the list, and with Mr. Punch's simple but touch-
ing narrative above given, no other guarantee can be needed
as to the merits .# the case. He will therefore trouble
everybody who ever did or ever expects to need medical
service to send in something, (much or little, but much for
choice) to the Lancet Office, 423, Strand, W.C.
Also, he will trouble the Judges to ordain that seats
be kept for expectant jurymen, or, after this notice, he
shall º: paying the slightest attention to any juridical
invitation with which he may in future be honoured.
Q: What will º be the last language spoken on
earth? A. The Finnish.
A BOOM FROM BIG BEN.
DEAR PUNCH,
those confounded chimes are calling me to strike for them, and so
believe me, my dear boy,
Yours mournfully, BIG BEN.
KNowing you hate work, as every fellow does of course who
would be thought agentleman, I feel assured of your deep sympathy when
I tell you that my “hours of idleness” are over. Alas! yes, my dear
boy, such is the melancholy fact. Only see this brutal bulletin which
has been put in print about me:—
“Big BeN.—‘Big Ben' is once more *...* the time from the clock-tower
of Westminster Palace. It was discovered, on examination by the founders, Mrssrs.
MEARs, that it was not so cracked as people imagined, and consequently it has been
again set to work. The crack did not pass completely through the metal, and
though the tones are rather subdued, it performs its functions in the most exem-
plary manner, proclaiming the passing hours to distant parts of the metropolis.”
Painful, is it not, for a bell in my position to be set to work again,
after so many pleasant months of living like a gentleman, with nothing
on earth to do, or up in the air either. As for saying I “perform my
functions in the most exemplary manner,” I suppose that bit of kudos is
meant just to console me for my disappointment. I only know that
since I’ve been set to work again, I have done my very best to sound
my very worst, and make my voice as hoarse and husky as I can, in the
hope of being once more put upon the sick list. Give a dog a bad name
and lang him, says your proverb: but my fate was worse than that, for
the wretches hanged me first and gave me a bad name afterwards. Ah,
well, such is life We—I mean, we bells—are here to-day and hanged
to-morrow, and when once they’ve hanged us there is no rest for the
wicked. Cling, clang, bang! bim, bom, boom! We have to work both
day and night, and get no rest even on Sundays. I hoped to have
sneaked out of it by pretending I was cracked; but in these enlightened
times hang it ! even lunatics, you know, are set to work, for you are
told employment's good for them. Besides, they soon found out that I
was only cracked skin de p, and, as my tongue was sound enough, my
voice was not allected. Well, it comforts me to know that some folks
think me a great nuisance, and so perhaps they will petition to have me
work short hours, by which I mean that I should not be made to strike
the twelves and other long ones. I’m sure my deputy did well enough
when I was out of sorts, and I should only be too glad to hold my
tongue if they would let me. I must knock off rather suddenly, for
P.S. Would EARL RusseII, kindly mention my sad case, and say that
I am really much too delicate for daily active service? After what he
said in that Scottish speech of his, he must surely feel some sympathy
for those who, like myself, desire to “Rest and be thankful.”
FOULD, FOULD, FOULD !
PATIENCE, ill-treated EMPEROR,
Nor, baffled Paris, groan:
If you have not a Congress got,
‘You’ve a twelve-million Loan.
Think of the Northern saw (if sick
Glory's high price at learning),
“There is no loan that is so long,
But it must have a turning.”
Of money-loans that saw holds true,
Though muddy loans 'twas made for:
IIowe'er long debt and glory run,
IBoth, at last, must be paid for
“The French Lake.”
SAYs the Parisian Opinion Nationale, “Good bye to the Congress.
The Lords of the Isles have killed it.” Perhaps, not being exactly
eager to help France to her coveted title of the Lady of the Lake called
the Mediterranean.

CBINESE OBEDIENCE.
A TELEGRAM from, Trieste, thus announces about as affecting an
example of implicit and loyal obedience as it is possible to conceive:-
“Advices received here from Pekin, to the 3rd of October, state that the General-
in-Chief of the Imperial troops received from the EMPERoR an order to strangle
himself, and obeyed.”
Everybody knows SAM Johnson's paraphrase on
“Greeculus esuriens, in coelum jusseris, ibit.”
The alacrity of Johnson’s “fasting Monsieur,” and of JUVENAL’s
hungry Greekling, to do what they were told, is realised and literally
reduced to practice in the readiness with which the Generalissimo of the
Chinese Imperial forces committed suicide at the request of his Sove-
reign. He obsequiously went and hanged himself, taking his chance of
wending afterwards the poor little Greek beggar's way, or that of the
famishing, Frenchman. , Being told to go and be hanged and going
accordingly, a man exhibits a pattern of submission that beats all
!. holy obedience which Popery practises, and which is aped by
useyism.
The General-in-Chief of the EMPEROR OF CHINA’s ſorces should
have been general of the Jesuits instead. One who knew so well how
to obey as he did must have been an excellent Commander; and so
loyal an officer would have been just the right man in the right place at
the head of IGNATIUs Loyola’s army.
The case, however, assumes a different aspect, if we suppose that the
Chinese General hanged himself only to save his life from being more
gradually extinguished by vivisection, or some other form of torture.
In that point of view it will naturally suggest the conclusion that the
EMPERoR or CHINA, like the CzAR of Russia and the KING or Daho.

BEECHER FOR EVER I
Broadway, Wednesday.
WAL, Punch, old hoss, and what dy’e think of our bhoys neow?
Guess they’ve been and given yar blest Methodees the goby. Talk
about your SPURGIN 1. Punckinsºuash and thunder! See what A re-
ception we’ve bin givin toe our BEEcHER! Jist you have a squint at
this here extract from a newspaper, which gives a hull account of the
splash we made about him:—
“Our limited space precludes the possibility of giving a detailed description of
the decorations, but suffice it to say that the cultivated taste of hundreds of ladies
and gentlemen was exercised in adorning the interior of the building. The lecture-
room, which has recently been enlarged, was brilliantly illuminated with jets of
gas, the pillars on either side were tastefully festooned with evergreens, and sus-
pended at convenient distances from each other were a number of birdcages, con-
taining swcet songsters, whose unceasing melodious strains filled the room with
enchanting music.”
As bein emblematical of MR. BEECHER’s preaching, I hear that some
of these “sweet sºngsters” were meant to have been doves, but some.
heow they got pecked to death afore the meetin. So a mockin bird or
two were brought to take their place, and on one side of the room I
seed a “Laughing Jackass.” But go ahead, old hoss, with your perusal
of the peayper:-
“Ascending from the lecture-room the Sabbath schoolroom is reached, where was
º: to view one of the most beautiful spectacles which the eye can behold.
e first object that attracts the visitor is a fountain in the centre of the apartment
enclosed in a temple constructed of evergreen, each arch of which had inscriptions,
such as ‘Love,” “Truth,’ ‘Faith,” “Hope,” and similar sentiments. The temple
was adorned with rare flowers and birds, whose mellifluous notes made one feel as
if he were in fairy land, or roaming through Eden's bowers. Every part of this
room was gracefully adorned with evergreens and flowers, and at one end was a
large bower festooned with the American flag. A beautiful young lady was its
occupant, who disposed of bouquets to the visitors, and it is needless to remarkthat
she met with many purchasers. The air was redolent with the perfume of the
choice flowers which were scattered in profusion through the rooms; the ear was
enchanted by sweet strains from a secret company of instrumental musicians: and
the occasion furnished an excellent opportunity for the exchange of thought and
feeling, which was duly improved at intervals throughout the evening.”
Them birds which made you feel that your were “roaming in Eden's
bowers,” I suppose were birds of Paradise, though I didn’t chance to
see 'em. But in course I had a squint at the “beautiful young lady,”
and snakes 1 she looked so scrumptious that, arter buyin a big bookay
for to stick in my left buttonhole, I was forced to buy another for to
shove into my right one. While makin these here purchases, I tuk
good care, of cºurse, to “exchange” some tender “thoughts” and
highly amiable. “feelings,” and I felt it was my duty toe “improve the
opportunity,” by just giving her a wink as she handed me the flowers,
and a-squeezin of her fingers as she handed me my change. But I
couldn't spare much time for flummery and flirting, for I seed the bhoys
commencin toe pitch into the refreshments, and I calculate we Yankees
air all-fired smart at eatin, and soon gobble up a supper when we once
begin. There was enough for all, however, and so one didn't want (so
much at least as usual) to get one’s grub down at a gallop, for ſear one
might come short., Perhaps from this next extract you may pictur’ to
your mind what a blow-out had been bought for us:-
“During the intervals the refreshment saloon was liberally patronised, where
tea, coffee, ice-cream, and other delicacies were furnished by an efficient and atten-
tive committee of ladies and gentlemen, who spared no efforts to minister to the
comfort of the visitors. Some idea of the quantity of these articles provided for this
ovation may be formed when the fact is stated, that our reporter on passing in
observed a large waggon-load of ice-cream.”
Wal, I'm a whale at ices, and I guess of that are “waggonload.” I
corn-sumed pretty near upon a barrowload my-self. I swallered it slick
off, tew, without so much as whistlin'; for you see I wished to hear the
“grand instrumental concert,” which, as the peayper tells you, -
“Was given in the Church by the Germania Band.”
You Britishers I guess would have called that band a German one,
but our bhoys air everlastin “smart in fixin” up fine names. And I
calculate you Britishers would never have dreamt of giving a concert in
º". at least a concert where such pieces as the following were
played :- -
“Welcome Home-Grand March HELMs.MULLER.
Selections from the new opera, Ione PETRELLA.
Arietta in forma di Valse, Il Bacio . Arditi.
Green Seal Galop (by request) Lumbye.
Waltz, First Flirtations . - - - Strauss.
Little Darling, Polka tremblant (First time) Helmsmuller.”
Wal, arter this sublime and most appropriate selection, we had some
picturs brought to look at in a thing called a Stare-opticon, which I
guess is Greek for peep-show. And then came a heap of spoutin and
some more appropriate music, of which, for what I know, the following
was the
PROGRAMME: ;
Trumpet Solo, “Suomila tromba intrepida,” performed (on his own trumpet) by the
Rev. Mr. BeechER.
Drinking Chorus, “Here's a health to all Good Pastors,” Sung by the Congregation.
Nigger Melody, “I would I were with BeechER!" (Sung by a reverend gentleman of
colour, assuming the character of a converted Hottentot.)
Buffo Song by the Rev. MR. B., “Oh, what a fortunate humbugam I?"
(Slightly altered from the opera of Blanche de Nevers).
General Chorus, “He is a jolly good fellow,” Shouted by the Congregation.
Comic Song and Dance, “The Perfect Cure,” Rev. H. W. BeechER.
Convivial Chorus, “We won't go home till Morning," Sung (with brimming teacups
in their hands) by the Entire Congregation.
Whether all this here was done I can’t exactly say, for I’d swallered
such a heap of ice that I felt kyinder as though a slide had got inside of
me: so Iskedaddled away hum, afore the speakin was haaf over, and
tuk deown six gin-sling and a couple of brandy cocktails, just by way of
a preventive fur to keep myself from freezin. But the peayper-scrawler
says that “operatic airs” were played when they’d done spoutin, and
when he left “at nearly midnight, the festive scene was still progress-
ing.” For anything I know they may be at it still, for them Temperance
bhoys air stunners for a spree when once they’re warmed to it. But I
can’t stop toe inquirate, for I want to save the post, and just show you
what we’ve done toe glorify the bhoy whom you Britishers tried hard
to snub, and silence, but you couldn’t.
So I remain, old hoss, yours all’ys,
Jonathan GoLIAH EBENEzER Jones.
P.S. Why don't your young SPURGIN give a concert in his Taber-
nacle? If I were he I’d take a leaf from our bhoy BEEcher's music-
book, and hire a German hand at times to strike up in his church. A
polka now and then would jist wake up the congregation, and, after a
long sermon send'em cheerful to their hums. As an additional attrac-
tion, he might have a big drum behind him in his pulpit, and give a
bang on it whenever he seed anybody dozin', jist by way of an eye-
opener and a delicate reproof.
The Tory Black Horse.
WHEN ARCHBishop LAUp was on trial, he was told that if he had
not committed one great act of treason, he had perpetrated so many
small crimes as, taken together, made him a traitor. “I never knew,”
said the Archbishop, “that one hundred black rabhits made up a black
horse.” In the spirit of his Grace’s remark, Punch wants to ask the
Tories (who exult so frightfully over the gain of various isolated
elections), how many dozen Andovers, Windsors, and Readings will
make a Tory Government? Perhaps they will tell us aſter the writs for
the General Election shall have set the people doing the same sum.
THE ORDER, OF COURSE.
THE PRINCE of WALEs’s papa-in-law has, we see, just given him
an elephant. So our darling Princess will always have her own ivor
at hand, and there will never be another excuse for a Corporation jo
in the hairbrush line.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPICY BREEZE FROM CEYLON.
MR. PUNCH's Colonial connections are ramifying so enormously that
he is thinking of appointing a Colonial editor. (To prevent disappºint-
ment, no GREY, ELL19tt, or Irishman need apply.) From HER
Majesty's Fifty Colonies he receives an amount of correspondence
which he begs hereby to acknowledge, and friends at a distance, wil
please accept this intimation. He is obliged to keep his geógraphical
tap constantly turned on, he can tell you, especially when the Australian
mails come in. However, he is equal to the occasion, and has made
such proficiency that he is quite confident that Melbourne is not in
Tasmania, a point on which he should be sorry to examine a good many
Members of Parliament. -
Well, talking of Colonies and examinations, a Cingalese friend—
(won't he stamp when he reads this—we mean a friend in Ceylon) has
sent him an extract from a report of the Central School Commission, for
that interesting island, over which the spicy breezes blow soft, and
where every prospect pleases and only man is vile, according to BISHºP
HEBER. This extract purporteth to give some of the answers of the
best candidate out of twenty-six who underwent examination in Ceylon.
When Mr. Punch recollects the awful problem set for our unoffending
Indian fellow-subjects by Sir Charles TREvely.AN, to which, Mr.
Punch adverted the other day, it comes to his mind that he should like
to hear a Competition Wallah upon these responses.
“Longitude are lines which divides the earth into several spaces."
We consider this rather a good shot, and would respectfully offer M.R.
Cox, of Finsbury five minutes (PINNóck left alone) to write a better
answer.
“Grammar teaches us the art of speaking and reading, and of the proper manner
which they undergo.”
“Undergo” is not a bad word, because it shows that these poor
young fellows in Ceylon feel this persecution of being compelled to
submit to the arch-tyrant, L. MURRAY. Their allegiance is decidedly
imperfect.
“PETER the hermit"was a pilgrimage and he use to go to the holy city every
year to worship since he thought there his prayers would be more certainly
excepted.’”
Very near the mark again, and we request penny-a-liners, who criticise
a singer by saying that they were “delighted to hear her eliminate fresh
beauties from the favourite air of.” &c., not to turn up their phonogra-
phic noses.
“Before Bacon the people of England were not so acquainted with the subject,
because this was the first man who taught the people how to do it.
“(The above is tendered as a ‘short sketch’ of the history of Bacon, and is all
that is said upon the matter.)”
And quite enough too. All that most #: people know concerning
Bacon is that he lived about the time of ELIZABETH, is thought to
have written SHAksPEARE's plays, and said that knowledge is power,
which he never did say. Yes, some folks think he invented a New
Organ, for which they don’t thank him.
“MILton was a poet who lived in the present century, and who has been very
much esteemed by a many people for being an excellent poet.”
So he was. Will MR. Masson say that he was not an excellent poet?
We consider him an uncommonly excellent poet. As for the “present
century”—he lives in every century, he was not for an age, but for all
Centuries.
“In answer to the question “What changes have recently taken place in the ter.
ritorial extent of the Austrian Empire?'—one writes, “The change of monsoons and
weather has recently taken place in the territorial extent of the Austrian Empire.'"
Quite right. “Monsoons” is only a slip of the pen for “Mossoos.”
and the writer was evidently aware of the complication of French rela-
tions with Austria. The last extract we shall offer is this:–
“A simple historical allusion in a well-known poem by TENNYsoN,-where the
* oak” is spoken of—
“Wherein the younger CHARLEs abode
Till all the paths were dim,
And far below the Roundhead rode,
And humm'd a surly hymn."
Is thus explained by one of the very best of the candidates:—
“This allusion is referred to Milton. He was honoured by England, and he was
dear to England as an oak-tree was. He is said to have lived in the reign of young
CHARLEs in an age when literature had not flourished much. He is said to have
sung hymns in the road Roundhead.”
We consider this a brilliant and beautiful answer, and one which
resembles the celebrated note on SHAKSPEARE, which another annotator,
in an ecstacy of admiration, declared had placed his predecessor on a
level with the author. We have no doubt that the Ceylon candidate is
quite right, and that MR. TenNYson did mean Milton. He was noto-
riously fond of music, therefore might have hummed hymns, and his ill
success in the matrimonial line makes it very probable that he could be
surly on occasion. ... We firmly believe that he did live in the reign of
Young Chattles, though it was not Young CHARLEs's fault that his
living was not rather briefly put an end to. The “Road Roundhead”
gives us pause; but there is a Cromwell Road at Brompton, and we are
not to reject an original surmise merely because it is new to us, or what
would become of commentators generally P
On the whole we see no reason to be dissatisfied with the progress
made by our young friends in Ceylon, and if the following remark, which
our correspondent also sends, be applicable to the youth of that island,
||wº know another island (not a thousand miles from º: which is
only nine hundred and ninety-nine miles distant), to which the remark
would also be applicable, and as the Christmas holidays are coming,
parents and guardians will have an opportunity of testing the truth of
the allegation. -
“The youth of this country, as a rule, have excellent memories. They are able
to retain for a short time any amount of multiplex and (to them) almost unintelli-
gible sounds. These they are able to repeat more or less accurately, whenever a
corresponding set of familiar sounds, in the form of a question, is employed to
awaken the required train of associations.”

AND GREASE.
UDGING between the
gushings of unctuous
eloquence which wel-
comed the REv. M.
BEECHER home at the
meeting of his disciples
in Plymouth Church,
we may consider the
following effusion, from
the mouth of the REv.
Theodor E GUYLER, to
partake somewhat of
the character of oil of
vitriol:—
BEECHER
“I thank you just as I thank the wives of such men
as GRANT and But LER and GILMoRE, and the whole list
of heroic spirits that have left home to go out and do
battle for us; for not more clearly has GILMoRE done
grand service to the Union and to liberty when he
made Greek fire at Charleston than MR. BEECHER had
done glorious world-honoured service for the Union, the
constitution, and liberty when he sent the Greek fire
of truth right into the very heart of Secessia across
the sea. (Cheers.)”
The reverend speaker seems to represent the
Greek fire of GENERAL GILMoRE as the reduc-
tion of MR. BEECHER's preaching to practice.
The comparison between BEEchen and GIL-
MoRE does not appear to have been deemed
odious by the Yankee Methodists—who seem
Fire-Worshippers rather. But the uttermost
of out-and-out Yankeeisms is MR. GUYLER's
paraphrase for England as “Secessia across
the sea.” What a delightful coolness in the
implied assertion that England seceded from
her American colonies
LETTER FROM MISS FRANCIS
LYTTLE HUMBUG.
TO HER COUSIN MISS ELLEN LYTTLE HUMIBUG.
Rose Willa, Nov. 29, 1863.
MY DEAREST ELLEN
I MUsT just drop you a line, though
it is rather late; but I have to tell you of the
most delightful day I have ever spent in my
life, I think. Last Saturday we got a card from
the Miss FRIKLEs at Toxstock, to say that
they were going to show their fashions on Mon-
day, the 9th of November. Fancy my delight
and my surprise when Mamma told me, that I
should go with her, this year—for the first time
in my life / I could not sleep for three nights,
I assure you, my dear, for I was actually over-
come with hope and joy, and I don't know
what. So off we went this morning, Mamma,
JULIA, LYDIA, and poor little me.
We went by rail and early in the morning,
as we all wanted new bonnets and LYDIA a
new cloak. Thus we had the pleasure of seeing
arrive all the ladies—nobility, clergy, and gen-
try. Many of our cousins, of course, but then
the more dignified families in the neighbour-
hood: LADY lºossTone, the HoN. MRs.
Fish Mong ER from Redcar, LADY BRass-
FoundERY, the Miss PARROTTs, Miss WIL-
HELMINA Johnson, the HoN. MRs. SMITH
and Miss BRow N, the MissEs GEESE from
Elton Hall, &c. I missed Miss PHILLIs SNoBs
and her sister, but they have spent a few
months abroad, in Paris, &c. : and they, of
course, could not get anything from, or at,
the Miss FRIKLEs. Certainly not ' They are
lº. distinguée indeed, since they have come
ack.
You know (of course you know) that every-
thing is plaid this year; bonnets, shawls,
petticoats, dresses, muffs, cuffs, boots, garters,
&c. Even gentlemen are wearing plaid trousers,
isn’t it funny, dear. But the dresses for evening
and dinner-parties were delightful. I saw a
salmon - coloured dress trimmed with green
peas, and another flesh-coloured evening or
dinner-party dress, trimmed with onions, cauli-
flowers, carrots, and little stalks of celery.
Vegetables, grass, straw and hay, are much
worn. Caps are still very high, but trimmed
with radishes and onions for young married
ladies, who sometimes wear caps, and with
onions and turnips for dowagers.
Bulrushes are very fashionable for young
. and thistles and other weeds for
Widows.
Mamma bought such a sweet widow's cap for
AUNT LIzzle—poor thing, trimmed with a
cypress wreath, two sprigs of weeping willow,
thistles, hay, groundsel and other weeds.
All the dresses are worn looped up, a very
becoming ſashion for old maids and for those
who have a good pair of
Young ladies wear much grass for evening
parties, with heath and groundsel, which has a
very good effect.
Bonnets, of course, still very high, especially
the Church-bonnets, which are very pretty this
year, trimmed with much wheat and barley.
trings very wide, and, of course, nothing but
“Rob Roy” or “Royal Charlie.”
But before I conclude, I must tell youthat I
saw FLORAMACGREGoR at the FRIkies. She
was, as usually, very affectionate, and all dressed
in-tartan. … ------
“How do, my dear FAN,” she said. “Oh,
so glad to see you. How do you like my tartan
cloak We, of course, are almost obliged to
wear tartan, such a fashion belonging to our
family, and then JAMEs is so fond of it. Do
you know I am going to be married to JAMEs
MacIntosh (here she pulled out her little
tartan pocket-handkerchief) in Christmas week?
Oh, I am so happy, dear!”
Now to tell you, dearest Erlen, I was
never fond of Flora MacGREGoR, but
from to-day I have got such a dislike to
her, that I think of hating her! Yes, hate,

dearest, hate! I do not blush in writing this word. And that dry
MR. MACINTosh–O, I pity him!
But I must tell you that Flora got two bonnets and another tartan
cloak—the MacIntosh tartan, ugly: with too much green. And entre
nous—FLORA looks like a dairy-maid. But don’t tell, dear!

PUT THE SADDLE ON THE RIGHT HORSE.
A GREAT Western Engine-Driver, and Fireman, were fined last week
at the Oxford City Court, for being found drunk and incapable on their
engine.
It was an empty Luggage-train, so there were no lives, risked. The
Magistrates fined each of the men fifteen shillings. , Moderate—cer.
tainly—considering what a tipsy Engine-Driver might bring a train to.
But listen to the story told by the delinquents.
They admitted the ale and rum. They admitted they were incapable,
though they demurred to the word “drunk.” They declared in the
presence of the Company’s officers, and without contradiction, that
their day was fourteen hours, and that owing to extra pressure, they
had only had seventeen hours sleep the whole of the last week. Now,
suppose the empty luggage-train had been , a, full, passenger-train.
Suppose, instead of a four hours' detention at the Culham station, a
smash or a collision. Suppose any of the horrors supposable, with a
ſº lying helpless on the footplate of his engine and a driver little
elter, -
On whom should fall the blame and the punishment? On the men, out-
worn, and driven to stimulants as a substitute for sleep or a support
under exhaustion, or on the managers of the Company, who thus over-
work, or, in other words, under-pay their servants? for that is the
English of it.
A good deal in the way of railway reform was expected by SIDNEY
SMITH from burning a Bishop—marked, iſ minor good consequences
have been anticipated by Mr. Punch himself, from occasionally smash-
ing a Director. But useſul, though perhaps still, less brilliant results,
might follow from fining a Traffic Manager, in such cases as this Oxford
one, always taking care to fix the ſine at an amount rather more than
equivalent to fair wages for the over-work of the exhausted railway
servants, who succumb whether to the sleep they have been robbed of,
or the strong drink they take in lieu of it.
THE RELATIONS OF BLACK AND WHITE.
At the Anthropological Society's meeting recently a paper was read
on the subject of the Negro's place in Nature; its arāument, which
seemed, generally accepted by the philosophers present, tending to
place him a little above the monkeys and very much below white men.
In proof, that too much importance is not to be attached to the
structural analogies between SAMBo and Jocko, the Morning Post
observes that:-
“Qur most eminent comparative anatomist, it is well known, once classed as an
indubitable specimen of the negro t of skull, the cranium of toh s t
who was killed at Waterloo.” gro type - of a Scotch sergean

THE DOOM OF TOOTING COMMON.
º, CoNSIDERING by whom it was said that “a f. of chimneys is
better than a grove of trees,” the demolition of Thrale House and the
erection, on and about its site in Streatham Park, of a crowd of
stuccoed villas, must be regarded by the unprejudiced and thinking
mind as homage and not disrespect to the memory of DR, Johnson.
The shade of the great moralist and lexicographer may be supposed to
accept the smoke arising from, those habitations as so much incense:
Tooting adjoins Streatham, and the Philosopher of Fleet Street, seated
with the other spirits of the wise in the clouds, will rejoice in, the
probability that their surrounding fumes will soon be thickened by
contributions from Tooting Common, denser, and more sulphurous than
those which at present ascend from the wood-fires of the gipsies
encamped there. The most strenuous efforts are being made to accom-
plish the enclosure and appropriation of that unprofitable wild, which
now ºf: no rent to anybody, and exhales but little smoke, and not
much else at any time but the scent of furze-bloom and other flowers
In spring.
Some idea of the uselessness of Tooting Common may be derived
from the following description of it, for which we are indebted to our
contemporary the Express:—
“At all seasons it is beautiful, when the grand old elms are budding in spring
and the gorse is golden-blossomed, when the rich foliage of summer easts a cool
shade upon the grass, and the eye is charmed by the brown tints of autumn. The
gipsies lying before their tents, the bird-catchers laying their shares, the artists
painting in the open air, and the fair school-girls learning to sketch from nature,
give piquancy to the scene.”
Thus Tooting Common is simply ornamental, and of no more use
than Hampstead Heath, or Hyde Park, or Kensington Gardens, where
seedy overworked people go to idle about, for recreation and refresh-
ment, which they ought to be able to afford to seek by going as often as
they need some miles into the country by railway, or spending several
months of the year at the sea-side. - -
All who have a proper contempt for the common people, for their
pleasures and enjoyments, and for the privileges which they have
possessed from time immemorial, but should, for the aggrandisement of
individuals, have been deprived of long ago, will be gratified by the
information that an “Enclosure Commissioner”, has been holding an
inquiry in the village of Tooting, and taking evidence in favour of the
abolition of the Common. That evidence has been afforded in over-
whelming abundance, by a few little shopkeepers at Tooting, whose
interests happily coincide with those of the lord of the soil, bought sub-
ject to those rights of common of which he now confidently expects to
be enabled to dispossess the local and general public by means of an
Act of Parliament. The claims of this worthy to legislation for his
particular benefit are thus set forth by the contemporary above-quoted,
who seems to question them!-
“This is not a case in which patrimonial rights give any claim to inclosure. . It
is not disputed that the property was purchased a very few years ago, with full
knowledge of the public claims upon it, as, indeed, the merely nominal price which
was paid for it fully testifies. If Parliament should now give its sanction to the
scheme for building on this beautiful common, Parliament will simply give the
proprietor power to make a profit of 1,000 or 1,500 per cent. upon his investment, at
the cost of depriving the public of a right which they have always had, but which
they will never be able to recover if they once allow it to be wrested from them.”
Parliament will doubtless rejoice in passing the beneficent Act that
will transfer all the advantage, mostly sentimental, which Tooting
Common affords the mere public, in the concentrated form of 1,500 per
cent, profit, to one person. That Legislature which has sanctioned the
enclosures that are substituting groves of chimneys for groves of trees
in Epping and Hainault Forests, will surely be too happy to decree the
enclosure of Tooting Common. For the sake of the individual who
will be aggrandised thereby, it is to be hoped that nobody who may be
interested in the preservation of the Common has sufficient influence
in the House of Commons to secure the monopoly of that picturesque |
little waste to the contemptible public.

A Cheap Material for Public Buildings.
THE people of Plymouth are desirous, of
building a new Guildhall, the present one being
much too small—a site can be had near St.
Andrew's Church, but the difficulty is the want
of Funds; this, however, might be overcome, we
think, if the advice of one of the Town-Councillors
were taken, viz., to build it out of the sound of
the Church Bells.
HOOP-LA
RINOLINE.—The PATENT ONDINA, or Waved Jupon, does away
with the unsightly results of the ordinary hoops, and so perfect are the wave-
like bands, that a lady may ascend as stair, lean against a table, throw herself
into an arm-chair, pass to her stall at the Opera, or occupy a fourth seatin a carriage,
without inconvenience to herself or others, or provoking the rude remarks of the
observers, besides removing or modifying in an important degree all those pecu-
liarities tending to destroy the modesty of English women; and, lastly, it allows
the dress to fall into graceful folds. Price, &c. Illustrations free.
“Illustrations free!” they would also have been welcome. How would
the “wavelike” (beautiful but mysterious epithet !) bands have been
represented ? Probably as accommodating themselves to the creases—
the water-creases of a watered silk gown. She may go up a steep stair
without “provoking the rude remarks” of the gentlemen who may be fol-
lowing; an abusive custom, which as we gather from the advertisement,
any three occupants of a carriage adopt directly a lady takes the fourth
seat, and which, it appears, is equally the fashion with those habitués of
the Opera, before whom the unfortunate wearer of Crinoline is compelled
to pass, on the way to her stall. If the Jupon will †: a stop to such
rudeness, par Jupin let our wives, and daughters and their sons' wives
and daughters to a woman, patronise the Patent Ondina. On second
thoughts... as the Patent Ondina is º'ſ a lesser nuisance than the
nuisance it º professes to diminish, let us get rid of this as well.
Then will a lady be able to walk up the highest of stairs free from the
lowest glances, and lean against a table, throw herself away if she
pleases, or in fact do whatever she likes without inconveniencing
herself or, what is more important, anybody else; and any lady, being
herself in this matter free from fault, will not uncharitably attempt to
punish our shins.

So far the Vienna Court Circular. By a private note from a lady of
the Court, we hear that the EMPEROR facetiously remarked that as
birds, the presents were welcome, but as likenesses, superfluous, he
having already got photographs of his tiresome friends, the Pretenders

RULEs.
1. The ball may never be kicked when more than six feet from the
ground, any player repeating the offence must leave the game. -
2. If any player make a dent in another's leg by hacking, it may be
considered a h’accident.
3. No plain kick may be made except by a dab, who must look well
to his soles and heels. t
4. If a player is at sea he may take a punt kick; drop kicks are best
suited to members of a hydropathic establishment on a wet day.
5. To toe the ball a rope is not generally necessary.
6. A Police Magistrate should be in attendance to dispose of all
charges made by the players.
7. Free kicks are distributed gratis.
Hints to Young Players.
If you lose your wind, remember that the ball is blown as well as
yourself.
To run up the ball, we recommend climbing irons.
Be careful not to tear your shirt, for it will not avail you that you
are sewn up yourself, and have a stitch in your side.

A FACT.
“Only a A-pen-y, Marm, just towards a new set o' Night Shirts, Marm.”
SOLOMONS IN SAWNIELAND.
THE Saturday Review, the other day, endeavoured to extend its Scottish circu-
lation by inserting an abusive article on Scotland, declaring that, in Scotland, there
is no such thing as Mind; that the intellect of Scotchmen is utterly extinct; that in
Parliament the Scotch are the feeblest of debaters, and in like degree are imbecile
in their efforts at the desk, and that neither in the Courts, the Schools of Medicine,
nor the Pulpit, has anything like talent by the Scotch been lately shown.
Now everybody knows that if you pitch into a man in print, his friends are
sure to buy the |...; and so we have no doubt this savage article on Scotland has
obtained from friends of Scotland a large increase of buyers for the Saturday
Review. Of course we would not, for one moment, desire to be thought capable
of echoing the sentiments which, are above recorded; but that there are great
Phools among the Scotch, as well as great philosophers, we think a story which
has reached us through the Scºtsman newspaper will amply serve to show. From
this statement it appears that the churchgoers of Duthul have made some rather
curious objections to a º who had recently the honour of preferment to
their pulpit, and was objected to before the presbytery of Abernethy, who lunched,
we may suppose, upon the biscuits of that name. According to the Scotsman, his
unfitness for the office was thus logically proved:—
“One objector saw him enter the Church, and thought his walk was too slow, while his conver-
sation after entering was such as bore ample evidence to his weakness. Another said his eyes
were sunk in his head. Medical evidence was adduced as to the a rance of his nails, his teeth,
his gums, and the length of his fingers; and the agent for the . ectors stated in his concluding
address that the presentee was upwards of six feet high, and the proportion of weight to height
was only a stone perfoot.”
Were the kirk at Duthul, what is called a “Ladies' Church,” where piety in
petticoats chiefly pays the pew-rents, there might be some good reason in making
vol. xlv. C C
these objections. Personal appearance is of value in pet-
parsons, for ladies like a handsome manito look at in the
pulpit, and a couple of fine eyes, or a pair of handsome
whiskers, may often help a clergyman, in bringing people
to his church. But the Scotch, we should have thought,
were far too practical and pious to pay heed to such mere
vanities as personal good-looks; and, in their judgment of
a preacher, we should have fancied they would look more
to the powers of his mind than the proportions of his body.
Loftiness of intellect they fairly might demand in him, but
we can see no fair objection to mere loſtiness of person.
Nor, though his preaching might be justly required to carry
weight, can we allow them to be justified in sending him
to Scule, º for the purpose of objecting to his levity;
and while the shortness of his sermons might—with Scotch
hearers, at least—be a fair
surely be small justice in
length of his fingers. To a pet parson white teeth and
filbert-nails might be of service, in aiding him to make a
good . on his hearers; but when we find a parcel
of Scotc
ound for complaint, there can
en bringing evidence about their pastor's teeth
and nails, we must presume they do so from the thought
that as they want him to battle tooth and nail against the
“muckle black deil,” the condition of his nails and teeth is
somewhat of importance to them.
STARTLING THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.

the Timid Englishman as an “Eccentric.” Actor. But we
Hºly prepared for the following announcement in
e Izºnes :-
“THE CLAYDos Eccentricities.—MR. C. MATThews, one of the
monks of the “Order of St. Benedict, set on foot by ‘Brother Igna-
Tius," has been received into the Roman Catholic Church at the
Broughton Oratory. Mr. MATTHEws was known in the Order of St.
Benedict as ‘Brother Patrick.”
Ah! how little do we know of the workings of the
human mind, judging externally ' Who would have thought ||
while splitting their sides at the Haymarket within the last
few weeks, that the light touch-and-go [Comedian was
wearing a hair-shirt during, the performance and flogging
himself with a heavy discipline between the Acts and the
shoulders. Superficial folks would have thought that he
belonged rather to the order of the Theatre than that of
St. Benedict.

SHOOTING EXTRAORDINARY.
SoME interest will have been created by the paragraph
subjoined, from the Interness Advertiser:—
“Good Sport.—In Athol Forest, the other day, SIR ALExANDER
P. G. Cumming BART., of Altyre, killed two stags with a double-
barrelled breech-loading fowling-piece, right and left. He loaded
again, and brought down in a similar way two more. He again
loaded, and killed a fifth.”
“See, see!” as his Gloucestershire Worship says, “he
shot a fine shoot,” did SIR ALEXANDER P.G. CUMMING,
BART., of Altyre, if it cannot also be said, with theimmortal
Justice, that “he drew a good bow.” But may not that,
too, be likewise affirmed, in a sense? To be sure, it was
with a gun that the Scottish Baronet floored the stags right
and left, two after two, and those four down another come
on. But how about certain toads in the conglomerate of
which we heard some time ago from somebody of Altyre?
Does SIR. A. P. G. CUMMING know who that was, and
whether * of those toads have been preserved?. If they
have not, the archery of the gentleman who described them
will be probably considered as wonderful as the marksman-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FETTERS AND THE FLEECE.
S a rule, an exhibition of
specimens of the , inferior
creation is regarded as in-
structive. The monkeys at
the Zoological are not mo-
dels, in any respect, but we
all go to see them, Sundays
and workadays and all. And
it may not be amiss that we
should occasionally see Pic-
tures of the French Drawn
by Themselves. M. SCRIBE
drew one of these pictures
in a comedy called A Chain,
which MR. LEIcesTER
BuckINGHAM has “adapted”
for the Haymarket. Theatre,
and called Silken Fetters.
Mr. Punch perceived that it
was harmless, for reasons
stated hereafter, and there-
fore has not interfered with
a run now over for the pre-
sent. Subject to what we
are going to say, MR.
BuckinghAM has done his
work, very cleverly. . He has condensed the French, talk into ex-
tremely, neat English, preserved the striking situations, and, con-
trivances of the author, and shown his own ingenuity by a hold device
for getting rid of the immorality, in which he has entirely failed, as was
inevitable. You might as well hope to remove the flavour of garlic
from a Spanish dish. We have, however, one crow to pluck with him;
and it is a crow as big as an ostrich. If he had a cage of gorillas tº
exhibit, we are sure that he would be too conscientious a naturalist not
to label them as gorillas. He would not put them into trousers and
crinoline, and say they were Irish people. Then why has he called
M. Scribe's hºle; by English names, and transferred the scene of
their antics to this country. Such creatures and such feats would
simply be impossible here. M. Schibe keeps them in the right place.
For, see here. A great English lady, wife of an English Earl, who is
a gallant and distinguished sailor, and also a politician of note, hears
that her husband has been drowned. . She falls in love with a young
concert-singer, and marries him clandestinely. On their return from
church they hear that the Earl has not been drowned, and is coming
home." They separate on the instant. -- -
the Earl, who is a splendid fellow, takes astrong liking to the concert.
singer, whom the lady's influence has raised into a great literary position
(mind that, young singers, and please the ladies, and you may come to
write in Punch some º: and insists on his being invited to the house,
plans a capital marriage for him, and is his generous. benefactor. The
young man appreciates this kindness, and, having discovered that, he
never really loved the lady, and that he very much loves a pretty little
cousin—the girl the Earl destines for him—is most anxious to break
off with the Countess. Break off what? asks an astonished reader.
Why, the secret of the futile marriage is well kept, but the Countess
goes on loving the artist with intrusive intensity, hates her brave
husband, and speculates on the chances of his death, talks love to the
young man whenever she can get a hearing (though the Earl is walking
about the house at the time) tries to break the match with the cousin,
and finally wants the artist to elope with her. She is beaten out of the
field only by the most convincing proof that the young man detests his
Silken Fetters. So she goes to sea with the deluded Earl, and we hope
...” awfully sea-sick, and have serious talk with the chaplain
On board.
That is the French lady whom MR. BucKINGHAM has called by an
English name. The purpose of the stage being, according to WILLIAM
DESTRATFoRD, “to show Vice her own image,” the drama is purpose-
less, because in England we have no such types of Vice who can come to
the Haymarket and be improved. French Vice, however, iſ M. ScFIBE
be trustworthy, is abundantly exemplified in this comedy. On the above-
stated zoological precedent, there is no objection to such an exhibition,
and as the good taste as well as the morals of everybody in the house
set the audience from the beginning to the end dead against the
obtrusively immoral woman, and make them hope she will be blown
overboard, that the brave Earl may be free to marry an honest lady,
the piece can do no harm. We are glad to say that MRs. CHARLEs
MATHEws, though she takes immense pains with the part, cannot
enlist, our sympathies for LADY WINDERMERe, and our admiration is
strictly limited to her careful efforts and her faultless costume. The
most difficult and unthankful part we have, perhaps, ever seen, is
allotted to M.R. WILLIAM FARREN, who, as the artist, is in a false
position through the whole play. The audience can never be with him,
and MR. FARREN shows no little artistic talent in working up such
But they meet in society, and
material. ...He shows all the manliness and self-respect which his
authors will allow him, and fights determinately with the continuous
difficulty of maintaining a gentleman's bearing amid the most com-
promising situations., Ungrateful as the partis, it has demonstrated the
actor's great ability. MR. MATHEws, as an impossible attorney, has a part
which seems to be good, but of which neither he nor anybody else
can make much. MR. WRIGHT, at the Adelphi, turned it into broad
farce, but even so we remember it as a failure. MISS MARIA HARRIs
will be a charming little actress, one of these days, if people will only
let her alone, and not teach her conventionalities.
Mr. Punch's best thanks to MR. BUCKstone, MR. MATHEws, and
everybody who had a hand in reviving MR. PLANCHé's admirable
burlesque, the Golden Fleece. It acts as freshly as ever, because its fun
does not depend upon allusions to topics of the day, and because its wit
is unforced, and its humour true. The jokes, good ones, ring out as of
old, and there are epigrammatic lines which are better than jokes. And
we never saw MRs. CHARLEs MATHEws to so much advantage. She laid
hold of the character of Medea—no, she has clutched it in a vice, and
holds it as a discounting attorney holds an overdue bill. She is some-
thing more than tremendous in it—a tigress in a fever were a purring
kitten compared to Medea when she has worked herself up to a com-
plete sense of , her wrongs.
It is worth while going to
the theatre to hear the
“No” which answers MR,
CHARLES MATHEws's hope
that she won’t stand Jason's
conduct; and the two furi-
ous songs, especially the
—that capital exit
with the white arms waving,
must be something like the
sounds, and sight which

acchanals were coming
down to ... return him to Tº
.# instalments, Let =|º
us add that her Grecian gar- .
ments are charming, and
ought to make women in
crinoline think what they
might be if they would.
Mr. MATHEws's chorus is a
Greco-Anglican institution,
and MR. CoMPTON, as the
two Greek Kings, makes us
glad that we kept him, in-
stead of sending him to a
CATTLE:

LEY is a verydainty, Jason, and it is a comfort to hear her fresh young
voice in the music she gives so spiritedly. The two show scenes are
º mounted, but the Fleece, though Golden, does not depend
On glltter.
MR. MATHEws is like Cerberus, three gentlemen at once, or at least
in one evening. He finishes with the inimitable effrontery of Plumper,
in MR. BLANCHARD JERRoLD's farce of Cool as a Cucumber.
LIMITED LIABILITY.
THE following paragraph, from an ecclesiastical paper, calls for a little
explanation:-
“At the monthly Meeting of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge on
Tuesday, the REv. C. LANE in the Chair, the motion, “That it is desirable t a
version in Latin of the Book of Common Prayer be put forth by the Society, and
that º Standing Committee be requested to take steps for that purpose,' was
carried.”
Fºlly, why is Christian knowledge to be promoted on Tuesdays
only
§º. What is the difference between a Latin Prayer-book and
a Mlissa
Thirdly. As the Committee is standing, it can easily take steps, but
what is the “first position” for the purpose required?
That is Mr. Punch's fun. Now that he may not be supposed to be
unaware of the good sense of the arrangement recorded in such queer
English (may the Latin be better), he begs to say that he knows the
object of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge on Tuesday.
It is that all Roman Catholics, and especially Roman Catholic priests,
may be able to rend our prayer-book, and so discover that we are not
. the atheistic wretches we are supposed to be. The move is a
sensible one, and worthy of educated gentlemen like the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge on Tuesdays, and we wish them
success, “Fridays, Saturdays, and all,” as a Divine of the name of
WILLIAMS has remarked.

ONE of the critics, speaking
of MIss BATEMAN, the Miss

“Her vºice is a simple, natu-

just so much of veiled asperity É. Bon Jour, Messieurs / the Athenaeum is

rienced ear that it is of that

strain of expressing the true
tones of deep or violent emotion,
and will never need to disgui
its essential weakness an
verty of resource in conventional
ranting or whining.”
The epithet “unsophis-

a voice, for according to

inches of our porcupine

what this phrase can mean.
The bare notion of yelling
as applied to the voice ap-
pears to us a something that
our brains refuse to realise, and we should as soon expect to hear ºf a lady who was thought
to be short-sighted in her nose, or was said to have a deafened brilliance in her eyes.
SMART THINGS IN THEATHENAEUM.
THE 4thenaeum has lately been making some
aftempts at criticism in the style of the Satur.
day Review, with the meritorious industry of a
provincial actor trying to play Dundreary.
About an engraving of the iſ: FRANK Stone's
ind enough to make the remark that:
-- This is infinitely the best of the artist's works,—
some will say the only genuine picture he has produced
-certainly it is the only one that is likely to be accepted
by posterity.”
Has anybody been unduly extolling the works
of FRANK Stone? A gratuitous sneer at a
deceased artist cannot be imputed to the Athe-
nºwn. . The design to vex, a ghost would argue
a, belief inspiritualism. To this, however, the
Athenaum may be coming round. Besides the
foregºing, prediction relative to posterity, its

MR. J. MANNING's optical ghosts; thus con-
cluding:-
“The experiment is very strange and startling, butrea
science after all must beat the conjurors. We under-
take that Mr. Massing and his fellow opticians will
drive the Homes and Fosters quite out of the field.”
Does the Athenæum, then, believe that any
wonderful appearances at all are really visible at
the séances of Home and other Mediums? Does
it believe that MR. Home, who says that he
floated in the air, ever actually appeared to do
so to anybody in his senses? The admission of
the apparent facts of Spiritualism, even as con-
juring tricks, is a slight deviation from that
philosophical incredulity which has ever distin-
guished the Athenæum.

THE YANKEE HERCULES.
A PopULAR American paper,"bragging with the most ludicrous ex:
travagance, of the irresistible ordnance and impregnable ship-armour of
the Yankees, boasts that:—
“Pulaski and Sumter are battered down off hand, and our Monitors shed shot as
a duck sheds rain.”
A goose sheds rain no less than a duck, as the author of the fore-
going comparison might have remembered. He cackles on thus:–
“To take Gibraltar would be child's play to the Army and Navy which have
taken Wicksburg. Our first move in a war with England would be to anchor a
Dunderberg opposite to London, and proclaim our ultimatum of Greek fire or
unconditional surrender.”
The first move which the countrymen of ºfº, whether Irish
of the baser sort, or Yankees, made in the war with the Southern Con-
federacy, was a retrograde stampede. In that war which the malignant
snobs who write the most of their newspapers are ever, anticipating
with John BULL, their first move would probably resemble the move.
ment which they executed at Bull Run. They would be more likely to
skedaddle on the first opportunity than to anchor a º; Oppo-
site to London at any but a safe distance for London and for the
Dunderberg.
There is, however, some truth in what follows:–
“We have won for ourselves the title of the Hercules of nations. We are cleaning b
our own Augean stables at present, but we shall be ready for those of the other
Continent when our services are required.”
Those who are above referred to in the first person plural, are doubt-
less ready for any dirty work. But of all the feats of Hercules there
is only one which they can be said to emulate in any manner. Amongst
all the Yankee snake-stories there is not even a myth, to pretend that
the American Hercules strangled any Copperheads or other serpents
in his cradle. He has not i: destroyed anything like the Nemacan
Lion, much and often as he has menaced the British; neither has he
hitherto performed any such exploit as the capture of the Cretan Bull,
or any other bull, for all his tall talk about punishing a certain other
“Bull at his door.” But it is too true that those who call themselves the
Hercules of nations are doing something that has some analogy to
cleaning the Augean stables, and also that they diverted the course of a
river; though not for the purpose of drainage, but that of devastation.
Yes; they are making a stir which has at all events the effect of an
“º to clean out their own Augean stables.
eW .
A NEW ORDER OF WALOURRWANTED. "
At what is known to lawyers as a “Sitting in Error” which took
place the other morning in the Exchequer Chamber, the following con-
versation is said (we quote the Times report) to have occurred:–
“MR. MELLISH said bankruptcy was not now a crime. |
“The CHIEF BARoN. That is gone; it is no longer a crime. |
“MR. BARoS BRAMwell. It is rather a merit.”
If this really be the case (and we have a Judge's word for it) we
think that some new mark of merit should forthwith be established to
reward the men who nobly have been whitewashed in our Courts. An
Order of Trade Valour, for example, might be instituted, and heroes
who had proved their merit by a bankruptcy, might be decorated fitly
with a Basinghall Street Cross. In cases where a man had braved, we
will, not say the terrors—for there are none—of the law, by fraudu-
lently hiding a large portion of his goods, an extra medal might be
given to reward his splendid courage, and his name might be enrolled
among the very bravest of the bankrupt brave. A Ribbon of Insol-
yency might also be, provided, for traders less unscrupulous than
ankrupts in their failures, or less lucky in achieving a safe passage
through the Court. - - ---
Of course we are aware that allºt men have their failings; but
the º: of our tradesmen have thanks to our “amended” laws,
of late become so numerous, that we really think some public
notice should be taken of them, and we are glad of any chance that
helps to drag them into print. If the Order of Trade Valour which we
speak of be established, we would suggest that every bankrupt should
be forced to wear his order conspicuously upon him, and have the date
when he obtained it placarded largely in his shop. This would be
doing something for the credit of the country, which assuredly must
suffer if something be not done.

“To this I answer that no man ought to marry unless he can

EUROPA AND THE BULL.
OLD KING AGENoR’s flocks and herds were large, in sooth, and fair,
No end of fleecy multitude, the gentle shepherd's care,
And cattle, long-horned, short-horned, runts, sire bull and mother cow,
And ox about to furnish beef; meanwhile to tug the plough.
Well off no less was he for bristly tenants of the stye,
That craved their wash and barley-meal with never ceasing cry,
With grunts and squeaks importunate, innumerable swine
Contended with the blatant calves, baa-lambs, and lowing kine.
One bull there was, the nonpareil of all AGENOR's stock,
The marvel of Phoenician swains who wore the rural frock,
A snowy bull, a prize bull, such a sweetly pretty thing,
It charmed the maid EUROPA, the fair daughter of the King.
She patted and made much of it; she ſedit every day
Herself, with oilcake, cabbage, mangold wurzel, clover, hay,
Its horns with garlands did entwine, its tail with roses deck,
And pink and light blue ribbons tie around its burly neck.
Stretched, many a sunny summer's day beneath the linden's shade,
Its sides a couch afforded the reclining royal maid,
And when her arm its shoulder º: the Bull its head would put
About with eyes upturned, and kiss her tiny little foot.
A sudden thought EUROPA struck; ’twas strange and fanciful
That she should so much like to try a canter on the Bull.
She bounded on the creature's back without a guiding rein,
And suffered this unbridled Bull to bear her o'er the plain.
The Bull first gently jogged along; beginning to pursue
A faster course it galloped soon, and then like winking flew,
O'er hill and valley, wood and stream; no steed was e'er so fleet;
Swam slap across the Midworld Sea, and landed her in Crete.
The mighty JuPITER was hid within this one Bull's hide;
EUROPA on another Bull now takes another ride;
A quiet and a steady Bull behold her seated on; .
No JUPITER, no heathen Bull; his Christian name is John.
EUROPA heard a summons, which before she would obey,
She looked which way the Bull went and resolved to go that way.
Her presence though a strong will thought in Congress to compel,
She cast herself upon the Bull, that bears away the Belle.
SINGULAR SENTENCES.
We have no sentimental tenderness for a miscreant, British or
foreign; but we think that after a man is hanged he might be let alone.
Not so, however, think the colonial authorities, according to the
Taranaki Herald, which says,
“The trial of the half-caste prisoner, HoRI, on the two charges of having taken
part in the murders at Wairau, and on the attack on Lieut. WALLER, was concluded
on Monday. He was found guilty of both charges, and was sentenced to be hanged
for the first offence, and imprisoned for life for the second.”
We are curious to know how these sentences have been carried out,
and which was executed first. But as people's heels are above, their
heads at the antipodes, we conclude that they have other extraordinary
arrangements of truly Rabelaisian character.
Maxima Reverentia Puero.

We regret to state that the cause of America has for the moment
suffered a severe blow. The brave and enlightened CARMEL HEENAN
has succumbed to the stroke of an Englishman. We could well have
wished it otherwise, for at a time like this, when England is threatened
with the Yengeance of the noble Republic which she has insulted, any
additional irritation to its gallant citizens is to be deplored. Even in
the name of the victor in the fight is a fresh aggravation, but we rejoice
to believe that it is only in mimic war that a Republican can lie prostrate
before a King. The offensive and aristocratic arrangements by which
the humbler class, or as they are coarsely ...; the “roughs,”
were excluded from the fight as they are excluded from the polling
bºoth, were most unconstitutional; and we should like to know by
whose authority the brutal police bludgeoned away intelligent men
whose only crime was that they had not wrung three sovereigns from
taxes on the people, to spend them on selfish amusement. That the
aristocracy affected to patronise HEENAN instead of KING was simply a
piece of vulgar hypocrisy, though some titled idiots may have done it
under, the notion that he was a Confederate, an idea worthy of the
wretched fools of Belgravia. However, the Americans may be assured
that all Christian men in England hoped that he would have smashed
his adversary, and that the triumph of this KING, like the triumphs of
all other Kings, will soon pale before the advancing banners of the
glorious and re-United States of America.
BRAVERY IN BROADWAY.
Do the Americans ever go into mourning? -
One would almost fancy not, at least if one may form a judgment from
the following description.
Of the colours of the ladies' dresses worn now in New York— 3
“We must say the pretty peripatetics of Broadway present a d.º.º. spectacle.
Bright yellow cloaks with scarlet hoods, scarlet cloaks with yellow hoods, blue
clºaks with white hoods, purple cloaks with orange hoods, and striped and chequered
clºaks with crimson hoods, moving continually in prismatic procession through
that great exhibition thoroughfare, threaten with ‘colour blindness’ the man of
weak vision who ventures into the flare. The saffron, bright red, green, azure, and
white and cream-coloured feathers wherewith the ladies in conflagration decorate
their vivandière hats, planting the flaming tufts like torches in the forefronts of the
same, add much to their incendiary and auto da fé-ish aspect, and deepen the un-
pleasant impression produced upon feeble retinas by the blaze of their garments.
It really seems as if New York beauty and fashion had determined to substitute for
the fancy balls that were so much in vogue last winter a general street masquerade.
One would never surmise that a tremendous war was sweeping off by thousands
and tons of thousands the very flower of our population.”—New York Times.
When the Chinese are in mourning, we believe they dress in white,
and the Americans may possibly select the gayest colours to signify
their grief. If this be not the case, and supposing that their mourning,
like our own, consists of black, we are driven to J. that the
“pretty peripatetics,” who go tramping along Broadway in their rain-
bow-coloured raiment, have not lately lost a relative or a friend upon
the battlefield, or they would hardly dare to dress themselves in such
8. º way... Yet when one hears it stated that the war is sweeping
off the “flower” of the nation, one cannot avoid thinking that certain
of the relatives of the flower that has thus perished should by rights be
seen in weeds.
A CASE OF SIM-MONEY.
YE Gentlemen and Ladies of England who live at home at ease,
observe the following notice:—
“ MAN WAS MADE TO MOURN.”
MY Wife's Extravagance compels me reluctantly to caution the Public
against giving her Credit, as I will not be responsible for any Debts contracted
by her after this date.—WILLIAM SIM.
New Aberdour, 23rd Nov. 1S63.
Did MR. SIM ever learn the first verb in the Latin Grammar P If
not, he never will, as 'tis evident that Sim objects to the Sum.
Something Out of the Common.
“I SUPPOSE,” said a gentleman—pointing to one of those huge
perambulating photographic vans that go rolling about the country, and
which was then stationary on the common—“that thing is the fellow’s
parlour, kitchen, bed-room, -in short his everything?”
“Yes, his drawing-room included,” replied his witty companion.
How would you translate into Latin, “The Staff of Life P”
Why
any little boy could tell you, “Lignum Witoe,” to be sure.

HE travelling DIo-
Genes commences
his search for a tub,
let us say at the
Great and Grand
Hotel, Paris. This
hostelrie., is, fur-
nished with all sorts
of luxurious con-
trivances. For in-
stance, the room
that falls to your
lot is number one-
hundred and sixty-
five, at the top of
the house. ten
storeys high: an
objection is upon
the tip of your
tongue concerning
the number of stairs
which you’ll have
to encounter, when,
hey presto! up goes
the room in which
ou are sitting, and
efore you can say
Jack Robinson (we
- - - contend, by the way,
that this is far from being a natural exclamation for anyone when
startled or surprised), you are landed at the door of your lofty chamber,
Thus is...it that the visitor is conveyed to his apartment by means of
Hydraulic pressure, and, whenever he wants to descend, he is taken
down again by a Pneumatic Dispatch Pipe. MR. Home, the Medium,
might be utilised here, if he could only carry weight, and go up in the air
with the Tourists' luggage, whenever required., Your boxes are
unpacked by steam, i everything laid meatly in the chest of drawers
by a similar agency: in short, as far as our memory serves us, you
are washed, combed, brushed, dressed, put to bed and called in the
morning, all by machinery. Those who hear that there is a small
Nob in every room will set this place down for a very aristocratic
establishment. -
The knob, however, is of brass, and, in lieu of a bell, communicates
with a battery that sends an electric spark into the waiter who is calmly
'.. it. may be, perchance, dozing, at the end of the passage.
Another wire jerks the number of your room out of its place on the
wall and suddenly obtrudes itself upon his notice. The poor creature's
attention, being drawn to your requirements, by this really shocking
H. he steps upon a sliding board and, fº into your apartment
ike an amiable Corsican brother's ghost with his coat on. , Give your
order while the waiter's in the room; with all these electric-forces
about, there’s no knowing where he will be in another minute. The
menial does not go down-stairs to execute your commands: he knows a
trick worth two of that ; he sends a telegram to the cook, house-
keeper, boots, or whomsoever it may concern. Such are a few of the
improvements with which you will meet in the Great and Grand Hotel,
Paris...Surely here DioGENEs will obtain his matutinal Tub?, Let him
try. We did, and this is what they sent us. Nothing earthly did it
resemble, save a tin perambulator without its wheels. This curiosity
was a tight fit, for one, and held, if you could have wedged yourself
into it, about three tea-spoonfuls of water, and being of Nautilus' shell
shape, it laboured under the disadvantage of not possessing, of itself,
any power of remaining in an upright position... We explained (by the
Hotel Telegraph) that what we required was a hip-bath, and the master
of the hotel returned us the polite answer, also by telegraph, that he
had sent us the only hip-bath in the house.
We changed our quarters, and experimentalised at a smaller hotel.
An intelligent waiter listened to what we had to say, inquired the
amount | water which we wished the machine to hold, and the time
when we should want it, as it was so often in use. This sounded well,
so we told him our usual hour, and went to bed looking forward to the
joys of the morning. Punctually came the Garçon and brought us
a nondescript copper vessel; it might have been a saucepan, and it might
have served for a frying-pan; for our part, judging from its grimy
state, we believe that it had been
used in both capacities; but
whatever it might have been, there
was one thing which it most cer-
tainly was not, and that was a
bath. The waiter informed us
that it was what they called a
bath, and would we make haste,
as there was another gentleman,
- - an Englishman, waiting for it. We
generously gave up our claim, in order to send it on to him forthwith,
and we hope he liked it.
Our next inquiry was made at Lyons. Here they gave us a large
flower-pot. This might have served for one foot at a time, had the aper-
ture common to these articles been stuffed up with some more durable
substance than mud.
At Marseilles we were introduced to a very remarkable specimen
of the antique. At first sight we set it
down for a petrified mitre; but the bowl
and three legs rendered this position un-
tenable. Being brazen, it occurred to us
that it was not very far removed from an
inverted helmet: but here again the legs
came in our way and floored us... As to using
it for the ablutionary purposes of a sponging
bath, that was simply impossible. There was
no sitting or standing room init. We passed
about half-an-hour in trying to invent some
method, of adapting this vessel to our needs.
We failed to devise a plan, and ended as
usual by either going to the bath-room or
taking a dip in the river. -
At Nice all trouble of exercising our ingenuity was saved us by the
production of an article which the waiter evidently regarded as an un-
equalled work of art. He showed it to us with some pride. “M'sieu
wants a bath for his apartment; here it is, see!”. We did see: the
thing would have been nothing more or less than a fishing can, had it
not borne an equal resemblance to a slop-pail, and was like neither one
nor the other, inasmuch as it possessed four ". handles, which as
far as we could make out, rendered it useless, for any object save that
of ornament, for which, seeing that it was a dirty old green tin, it was
perhaps scarcely qualified. -
At Genoa they brought us a tea-urn with the heater in it complete.
At Montone, after a very great deal of trouble, the politest of land-
lords with much delight, assisted by three very civil and obliging waiters,
flattered himself that he at all events had succeeded in suiting, the
#. taste, in the way of tubs, to a nicety, and assisted by three
civil and obliging waiters, entered our room in great, triumph lugging
in a gigantic Oil Jar. Had he wished to put us quietly out of the way,
by the landlady playing Morgiana to our Forty. Thieves, this would not
have been a bad method of accomplishing his design. So far, the Tub
was not yet discovered.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOMETHING LIKE A WAR-CRY.
THE Enemy is upon us! The Railway League is in arms, and London
is to be given over as a prey to the destroyer. Well, if it must be so, it
must, as LoRD RUSSELL’s mottoso ſº observes, and we must rest and
be thankful that it is no worse, as that nobleman himself so justly
observes. But all is not yet lost. Let us see how far the foe has
already advanced, and whether we cannot cut his lines of communica-
tion, and try to overwhelm him in detail.
..MR. STANFORD, of Charing Cross, is a true patriot, and has thrown
himself, morally, or we should say, cartographically, in the way of the
advancing trains. He has just sent us a map, which is, we observe,
published at the small price of a bob, from which we learn what we
never knew before. He has supplied a real want, and in this hour of a
metropolis's peril wer, mder him our thanks. He shows us what railways
have already seized on London, and where we can get to if we like. The
whole sum of our folly in permitting the fiends to lay our capital waste
lºs out their own at interest is now revealed. What fools we
ave been .
* We have allowed one line to be laid out from King's Cross, and away
through once pleasant Kentish Town and *ś Hampstead, and for
what? That people may go to Gutteridge! ho wants to go to Gut-
teridge? Where’s Gutteridge? It is a ...; named place, the title
evidently corrupted from gutter edge, or edge of a gutter. That's an
inviting journey. We have permitted another line to be slashed through
gº; Finsbury, and dissenting Homerton, that people may get to
IR. G. DUCKETT's Canal. Who wants to go to his §. and who is
he, and what does he duck, and why should Finsbury and Homerton be
cut up for that? Then there’s another ridiculous line to disturb the
heads of the Nuns in the cemetery of that name, and to cut through the
old Oak of Honour Hill, and through all that delightful country, in order
to reach the Crystal Palace, to which there are already two excellent
railways, one for the cits, the other for the swells. . Then we perceive
that there is a new line to Greenwich, when it is notorious that, during
the white-bait season, which is the only time anybody but Bedlamites
go to Greenwich, the trafficis already so great that you can’t get a room
at MRs. QUART's or MR. HARTERMAIN's unless you write a week a-
head. Then there's the Underground line to be extended, for which
there might be an excuse, as at, present it seems that the promoters
merely grubbed and bored away like moles without minding where, and
therefore began where nobody comes and stopped where nobody wants
to º: But the necessity of mending a blunder does not † cuttin
up Finsbury Circus, about the only place where the people of that vici-
nage can get a little air. Lastly, we see that a new line is to be begun
at London Bridge, and run round in a great circle by Peckham and
Brixton till it comes to—where? You won't guess, Chelsea Hospital!
We are not joking, look at MR. STANFORD's map. These are some half
a dozen of the lines which are facts, or are going to be, and therefore
we can do nothing.” -
But something may be done º new aggressors, and we call on
the Senators of the moribund Parliament to deserve re-election by
making a vigorous fight against nearly all the schemes that have been
lodged. We protest against the Nelson Column and Qbelisk line, which
is to go through Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. We protest
against the Marble Arch and Mansion House line, which is to be carried
under St. Paul's; We protest against the Jack, Straw's Castle and
London Bridge Shades line, which is to run through the Reading Room
of the British Museum. We protest against the Palace Yard and Cre-
morne Gardens line, which is to have Westminster Hall for a terminus,
and go through, the Victoria Tower... We protest against the Bride
Court and Bricklayer's Arms line, which is to remove Mr. Punch's own
church, with the handsomest spire in London, bar one. And we protest
with all our might and main, and the big lion's mane into the bargain,
against the Primrose, Hill and Thames Tunnel line, which is to cut
through the Zoological Gardens. The railway people may say that they
do not mean all this wickedness, but we know better. They have done
us before. Look, at the horrible tank for which at this moment the
houses are going down on Ludgate Hill, the tank that is to shut out
St. Paul's. O, nothing of the kind was to be done—until the Act was
obtained. Look at that other appallingly hideous and gigantic iron tunnel
—no, don't look at it until you have got from under, for it has a pleasant
way of raining red-hot nuts and screws upon your hat—but when you are
safe at the BENNETT Clock-tower, look at the atrocity. , Did they show
us any picture of that, while they were getting their bills? Echo
answers that it will be *: if they did. We firmly believe that in
the mass of conspiracies, “lodged” on the 30th ultimo (it is a comfort,
though, a small one, to think that the plan-makers were worked nearly
to death, to be ready in time), are hidden schemes for effecting ever
º the objects we have protested against. Let Parliament loo
O it.
. Again we thank the patriot STANFORD. His magnificent and luxu-
rious maps of other parts of the world are wonders in their way, and his
eat London is a beautiful
# lorder to be asserted
ever run over. Lodge protests against the lines, and lodge barrels of gun-
powder under them; wake the Seven Sleepers with your thunder against
the Railway Sleepers, swear that the line shall be drawn somewhere, and
somewhere else than through your mansions and gardens; when you
quaff your porter, drink confusion to railway porters, and tell the com-
panies that they shall not have your room, and you will not have their
company. The railway-man shall not be monarch of all he º; Let
us rather treat him as a highwayman of old, and hang him in his own
surveying chains. Shall we be slaves to the Railway League? Is an
Englishman's house his castle? “Shall they Rail on and we be tamely
silent?” We pause for a reply? Werbum personale concordat cum
nominativo. Britons, to arms, and remember that England expects every
man to upset a train.
CONGRESS AND CONCORD.
THE, idea of the Congress proposed by NAPOLEON THE THIRD
would be a finer one than it is if all the Sovereigns invited to attend it
truly represented the various peoples under their thumbs. As it is,
the despots whose enormities and pretensions are the only reasons why
a Congress is wanted, merely speak for themselves. Hear his Holiness
the Pope :
“We co-operate, therefore in so laudable a project in a perfectly cordial spirit,
and can now earnestly assure your Majesty that all our moral support will be
afforded to the Congress, in order that the principles of justice, in these days so
much misunderstood and trodden under foot, may be re-established to the advan
of society in its present agitated state, that violated rights may be admitted in
order to be asserted in favour of those who have had to suffer by their violation;
and especially in order that the real pre-eminence which belongs naturally to the
Catholic religion, as being the only true one, may be re-established, especially in
Catholic countries."
So then the objects which the Pope contemplates as the result of the
Congress, for his own part, are the restitution of the provinces which
have rejected his rule, and the predominance of Popery over every other
creed even in Protestant states in some degree, but in Catholic coun-
tries in a degree still higher than that in which it predominates now.
What does he mean, if not the exaltation of CARDINAL WISEMAN over
the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURy in England, and the revival of the
Inquisition in Spain and elsewhere?, For a similar purpose he may
hope to have in time, organised, even here, a new Smithfield Club, to
which he will be able to send a Bull.
How would Louis NAPOLEoN like the idea of a º Congress
setting to work to the intent “that violated rights may be admitted in
in favour of those who have had to suffer by their
violation?” That idea, according to the Pope's definition of rights,
should be less pleasing to the Elect than to the Rejected of the People,
and appear not so admirable to NAPOLEoN THE THIRD as to the gentle-
man who calls himself HENRI, CINQ.
The Pope offers to give all his moral support to Congress with a yiew
to its re-establishment of what his Holiness understands by the principles
of justice. He has no physical support to give that NAPOLEON can fear.
§. with the Pope going into Congress for Legitimacy and Perse-
cution, the EMPERORs of Russia and Austria for the confirmation of
their sovereignty over Venetia and Poland, and all the other Potentates
each for his peculiar “leather,” which he thinksthere is " nothing like,”
º: ºngº, if it could take place, would constitute a pretty happy
amlly.

Those who are familiar with the phenomena of the Camera Obscura will readily understand the precaution taken by Miss Tabitha Prue, on being

SURE SIGNS OF COMING CHRISTMAS.
WHEN John answers the bell the first time, and brings up the news-
paper the moment it arrives; when MARY is absent not more than ten
minutes on an errand that can reasonably be executed in five, an
abstains from holding nocturnal assignations over the railings at the
area-gate; when CookEY serves up the dinner precisely to, a minute,
and keeps the dish-covers in a state of brighter effulgence than usual;
when young BUTTONs does not play at peg-top in the hall passage, or
go about the house whistling, or humming fragments from The Little
Warbler, or shake the house from head to foot by giving energetic
imitations of the Perfect Cure for the amusement of the servants in the
kitchen; when everything is nicely dusted, and every one rises in the
morning at the ringing of the very first bell; when master's º are
to be found always in the right place, and he hasn’t to hunt half an
hour for them with poor cold feet under the bed, inside the wardrobes,
up the chimney, and everywhere, until he finds them; when along letter
comes from STER JACKEY at school, trumpeting forth the most
wonderful accounts of scholastic improvement; when the young ladies
are most exemplary in their attendance at the breakfast table; when
the youngest daughter is detected furtively embroidering a floricultural
É. of sº or a highly illuminated pair of slippers; when MAMMA
eeps the housekeeping-book down to a degree of unexampled lowness;
when the dustmen clear away the rubbish, and make no demand for
“beer”; when the postman touches his hat as he meets you coming out
of the door, and the pew opener curtsies so low you are afraid she is
§§ to fall down upon the floor; when the beadle does not look so
lack, or the hulking big chimney-sweep (we beg his pardon, we mean
ramoneur) either; when poor relations timidly leave their cards, and
clerks perform unparalleled, prodigies of penmanship; when, the abo-
minable waits drive every wink of sleep from your virtuous pillow; but
when in all other respects nothing but peace, and cheerfulness, and clean-
liness reign paramount in the house, to say nothing of º nightcap
being aired regularly every might—then it is high time that, PATERFA-
MILIAs should take warning, and, considering his cheque-book carefully,
look out accordingly!
“HERE BE TRUTHS.”
MR. PUNCH always thought that in his own supernatural Almanack
he was about as bold, in dealing with great people, as a superior intel-
d|ligence ought to be. But he owns himself beaten out of the field by
the Farmer's Almanack, as described by the Salisbury and Winchester
Journal. After enumerating the ordinary contents of that periodical,
the reviewer says that it contains—
“A list of Cabinet Council and Chief Officers of State, manures, and the members
of the Houses of Lords and Commons, their price, and a large amount of general
useful matter. This Almanack deserves to be in the possession of every farmer in
the British isles.”
We should think it did, and of every politician, too. We shall get it
being º anxious to know the price of guano, and of sever
Members of Parliament who we know set a good price on themselves.
The editor might send us a copy.
COLLEGES OF COLOUR.
THE Times 'correspondent at New York mentions that the “Presi. -
dent of Brown University in Providence,” on the occasion of the [
departure of a Negro regiment from Rhode Island, declared of the
fratricide in progress, between the Federals and Confederates, that
“This war, whatever, its mission was at the outset, has now no other
object than the abolition of slavery.” It may be inferred from this I
declaration that the President of Brown University is favourable to
Emancipation, which is natural enough, because the Mulattoes in the
South are just as much slaves as the negroes themselves, and such a
seat of learning as a Brown University would enjoy no more liberty there
than a Black one.

MARRIAGE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
Y DEAR PUNCH,
I AM a hand-

looking for a hand-
some wife tomatch.
But I declare to
you I do so with
no little fear and
trembling, now
that I havechanced
to see the follow-
tºº.
which appeared
the other morning
in a Nottingham-

MARY W-,

will never pay them.
Good gracious

such a dreadful
iece of tyranny ?
could not have
believed a wife
would have be-
haved sobrutally P
hy, by Jove'
the woman actually would prevent her husband's, being a credit to
his tailor! Is not this bare ſact sufficient to frighten any handsome
bachelor from committing matrimony ? Very certainly I feel much more
nervous than I did about it. But aſter all, you know, perhaps the
notice was inserted only as a joke, and so the best we can do-espe-
cially in Punch—is just to have a laugh at it.
Yours in single blessedness (at present),
NARCIssus CROEsus CoELEBs.
P.S.. I think allusions to the “grey mare” are exceedingly indelicate;
still, if this notice be no joke, but written in grim earnest, I certainly
might feel inclined to wonder if the writer ever uses a side-saddle: nor
would it much astonish me to hear she clothed the crural portion of her
figure with a garment much too manly to be fashioned by a milliner.
ALDERLEY EDGE TAKEN OFF.
QF course, when Mr. Punch takes a British nobleman in hand, that
British nobleman is either brought upon his knees, or he is consigned to
the Asylum for Idiots. But Mr. Punch is always * happy when a
slight and gentlemanly hint-ºuaviter in moda–spares him the trouble
of extreme measures of any kind. He is delighted to find that in the
case of LoRD STANLEY of Alderley-Edge, or rather of LoRD STANLEY
of Alderley-opposite-Edge, the mere intimation that Mr. Punch wished
to see his Lordship on a post office matter has produced the most bene:
ficial results. The grievance, touching which Mr. Punch was inundated
with letters from enraged Edgers, is understood to exist no longer, and
the Post MASTER GENERAL is hereby informed that he may remain in
office quamdiu se bene gesserit. The Testimonial from Alderley Edge
may be sent up as soon as the Edgers please.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 257
EQUALITY BEFORE THE TAX-GATHERER.
ookEY WALKER, or
somebody else, has
written an article in
the Saturday Review,
extolling the finan-
cial measures of MR.
GLADSTONE, , , eulo:
ising the blessed
ncome-Tax, and
containing the sub-
joined passage rela-
tive to that popular
impost:—
“If the ignorant agi-
tation against equal tax-
ation ad not been
silenced or suspended in
1853, it would have been
impossible to raise the
vast sums which were
afterwards levied by
direct taxation for the
* of the Russian
ar.”
The Income-Tax
amounts nearly to
the completeness of
s what the Saturday
Reviewer means by
- equal taxation, but
not quite. If that
gentleman had a
marriageable daugh-
ter to dispose of, he
would, of course, out
of two men equall
worthy of her in all
other respects, and in receipt of equal incomes, but one of them deriving his
income from fixed property, and the oiler from personal exertions, very much rather
assign her, to the former. Considering the º; of a man entitled to a stated
income to bear the expense of matrimony vastly greater than that of a man merely
earning so much a-year, he would nevertheless have their respective incomes
taxed precisely, alike. Regarding one as a far richer man than the other, he is for
imposing exactly the same weight of taxation on both.
This is undeniably a sort of equal taxation as far as it goes, for it exacts from
one person a sum numerically equal to that which it levies on another who is
indefinitely better off... It thus certainly makes a tolerable approach to the arith-
metical equality of taxation against which people are so ignorant and unreasonable
as to clamour. But the perfection of that equality would be absolute º:
sameness not relative to circumstances at all; so much a-head. In short, the
height of that equal taxation which the Saturday Reviewer applauds, would be one
uniform Poll-Tax. When the income ceases the Income-Tax ceases—can any-
thing be , more just P One thing. If the Poll-Tax exceeded the whole amount
of a man's property, the excess could not be seized, and his taxation would stop
altogether. That would be juster.
THE CRUISE OF A PIRATE.
WELL! We have beheld the prize pigs at the Mangel Worzels' Exhibition
at Islington, but the cheek of some $.” beats anything we have seen there.
There is a Pirate vessel called the Alabama—you may call her a Floating Blockad
if you are on the Confederate side—and she goes about the waters picking up
the merchant vessels that are undefended, and modestly keeping out of the way of
anything that is a match for her. She is a Pirate, however, for she does not take
her helpless “prizes” into a Court, but plunders them and burns them. We there-
fore hope that one of UncLE SAM's vessels will get within range of her, and we are
the more spiteful against her, because her captain, one SEMMEs, is not a splendid
Corsair, like Conrad, or a Demon with good intentions, like the Red Rover; but
an ugly man, who is very uncouth in his manners, and very churlish towards ladies
who may happen to be his prisoners. Now this is behaviour uncommonly unworthy
of a pirate “half savage, half soft,” in whom a young lady of well regulated mind
can take an interest. However, his officers do not seem ashamed of themselves,
and one of them has written an account of the Alabama's cruise, from her escape
from Liverpool to her arrival at the Cape, and if anybody would like to read a
CHRISTMAS DAY IN THE WORKHOUSES.
HA! 'tis merry Christmas Day,
O! be joyful once a-year,
When, attired in workhouse grey,
We shall taste of beef and beer,
Justice now suspends her rod,
Mercy, from her ample store
Shall regale the rogues in quod,
Give us, even, something more.
Pauper, banish from thy breast
Envy, with despair and grief,
Thou shalt be well nigh as blest
In thy diet as the thief.
Slice of meat from off the round,
Wedge of fat plum-pudding—there,
With a pint of porter crowned,
Lothy good old English fare
'Tis as if a day of grace
Shone upon the realms of woe
And the wretched, for a space,
Rested in the depths below,
Comfort, for a while at least,
Gleams behind the workhouse door;
Christian England makes one feast,
Just at Christmas, for the Poor.

How charity some kindly nurse

While tribulation’s touching tone

ERMINE EMANCIPATED.
O, PRESBYTERIAN Record, in margined black be seen!
Dames de la Halle—of Exeter, tear all your crinoline !
Tºwn from thy horse, bold Newdegaret To Smithfield's fires appeal,
Glib WHALLEY, Phoenix from the ash of Spoon ER's burnt-out zeal'ſ
For see, upon the ermine comes a fearful scarlet smudge,
And on the British Bench there sits a downright Papist Judge.
What WILLIAM PITT desired to do, but never could perform,
What WELLINGTON did not desire, but did, and hushed a storm;
Emancipation's #. work, o'er which we had the row,
Was never in its fulness fairly carried out till now;
And Punch, the anti-Papal, marks the epoch with applause,
When any rag is torn away that tells of penal laws.
What harm a Papist Judge could do we found it hard to say:
A man who crossed himself might know who a crossed cheque should
pay;
A man ious confessed, might mulct a confitentem reum
And, though he prayed in Latin, judge what’s tuum and what's meum;
Though sprinkled with the holy eau, might give a wretch a drop,
And, even on fast-days, interfere loose evidence to stop.
But no, we wouldn't have him, though he’d all the legal lore
Of Coxe, and LITTLETON, and HALE, and BLAckstone, and ToM
MoRE.
Should a dark Papist sit aloft with EIDONS, BAYLEys, GURNEYs,
Who knew but he might shake the faith of Protestant attorneys?
Make clerks in articles turn priests, and copying clerks turn monks,
Nay, change the very bailiffs into Últramontanº sºun
We’re wiser, as the weeping Hall of Exeter may see:
loºp.WESTRURY has made a Judge of learned SERIEANT SHEE,
An Irish, Catholic; and yet St. Paul's is standing, yes,
Up to the time, at least, that these eight verses went to press).
n the Queen's Bench he sits aloft, bewigged, nor can we find
That Cockburn, CROMPTON, BLACKBURN, or John MELLOR has
resigned.
Yet wipe short-sighted eyes, Ofriends, and do not be afraid:
'Tis not to Rome, but Justice, that a legal debt is paid.
England permits no honest creed a character to flaw,
Nor prejudice to injure rights accorded by the law:
An upright man, a lawyer skilled, shall have his due, were he
Five hundred times more Catholic than MR. JUSTICE SHEE.
Punch is the best of Protestants, and lives in daily hope
To see a Priest, and nothing more, in him who’s now KING Pope.
And for such English priests as dare their Popish tricks to try,
He keeps a rod that oft hath made the raw material fly:
But when a lawſul prize is set, and hath been fairly wont.
His Writ is like his gracious,G]UEEN's, and saith, “Let itight be done.”
So here’s a Christmas bumper to you, MR. Justice SHEE;
Your elevation show we dare let Catholics be free:
Though CockBURN's hair is—auburn, and yours is white as snow,
That makes no odds upon the bench, as both wear wigs, you know;
And while a Judge is wise and just, no Englishman will care . . . . .
What's the language of his Lordship's creed, or the colour of his hair.
Justifiable Bigamy.
At the Central Criminal Court the other day, one John Double was
convicted of bigamy under extenuating circumstances, and sentenced
to one month's iº. That was not much; but still, if
Double is worthy of his name, has he not a right to have two wives?
