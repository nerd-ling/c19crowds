(A CHAPTER FROM THE HISTORY OF THE FUTURE.)
rpHE Confederates having put down the Federal Rebellion, the American people had time to look round them, and
consider how they could best reform institutions which had worked somewhat imperfectly. The executions of
Butleb and of James GoEnoir Bennett had tended to conciliate all parties, and the work of restoring good humour
was completed by the publication, on the part of the ex-President, Me. Lincoln, of a delightful volume, containing all
the facetious anecdotes with which he had successfully met the various Federal disasters. Mitchell and Manhattan
having been judicially drowned in one mud-cart, and the fanatic war-preaching clergymen of all denominations, together
with ninety-five per cent, of the newspaper writers, having been embarked in the old man-of-war, the Nemesis, which
was then carefully scuttled off Point Comfort, there was little left to do in the way of punishment.
North and South being unanimous in regard to the necessity of a new constitution, Conventions were held, and
the first step was to abolish universal suffrage. The next was to exclude from the vote all Irishmen, Germans, British
Insolvents, and other voluntary and involuntary refugees. A further process of filtration disfranchised all war-con-
tractors, telegram-manufacturers, stock-jobbers, liquor-vendors, and all persons who had ever assumed any of the
nicknames of party. A property and education test was established, and a very tolerable electoral body, representing
Honest America, was thus obtained. It was then seen that if a re-union of the States were possible, it could only be
under a King, who must not be an American.
Like the eyes of the millions of pigeons who, in one of Mb. Fenimoee Coopee's stories, were suddenly brought
down by the discharge of a cannon loaded with small shots, the eyes of all the Americans were suddenly upturned, and
they rested on His Royal Highness, the Geand Duke Punch.
A Deputation from America crossed the Atlantic, and without waiting to comb its hair, or to be introduced
by Messes. Adams, Slidell, and Iea Aldeidge (the North, South, and Coloured Ambassadors), entered The Presence.
"Guess, Highness, as you 're the King for our money," began the Honourable Washington Geeenbaok;
"so order the smartest crown and fixings as can be produced, and state date for your crownation, yes, Sir."
"On the part of the Old Aristocracy of the New World," said the Honourable Richmond Cottonpod, "I offer
Tour Royal Highness the opportunity of founding a dynasty that shall transplant the tree of chivalry into the rich soil
of Columbia."
"Iss, Ighness, you berry good King, you outrageous good King, you dam good King," said the Honourable

PREFACE.
Pompet Quabhibungo (slightly plagiarising from Mb. Chables Eeade), "so you unliminate yourself out of dis here,
and come and bo pointed with werry best Macassar, yup, yup."
The temptation was one which few mortals could have withstood. King of America, with a domain of
2900 long miles by 1730, or 2,963,666 square ones, and with 80,191,876 (and a quarter, including Tom Thumb) of
subjects. A despot, too, with a despotism untempcred even by epigrams, for the article is not manufactured in the
New World. Happily, for England, Punch is not Mortal,
Hp dashed away a tear, brighter than any of the 2783 diamonds in the diadem of his beloved Queen, cleared
his voice with an effort and & Cayenne lozenge, and, after a pause, uttered one word:
"Shan't I"
His voice and language were courteous, but it was felt that his purpose was adamant. The Honourable
Mb. Greenback was going to spit, but remembered where lie was; the Honourable Mb- Cottoxpoo muttered the
shadow of the ghost of an oath; the Honourable Mb. Quashibungo kicked out his foot at Tgbt, and W§* incontinently
bitten where the calf of his excellency's leg should have been.
"My duties are Here," said Ppks Punch, "But, Gentlemen, your King is There."
He pointed to a tall, vigorous, gaunt person who had accompanied the Deputation, unaccredited, and who had
been silently listening to the proceedings.
The West strode forward, in the person of a powerful Backwoodsman, with the eye of an eagle and the muscle
of a gladiator; but there was a dash of humour in the strong fellow's face, too.
"I ain't much of a figure for a crownd and garter, Old Hoss, but I calculate as you 'ye smashed the nut this
time. These chaps ain't made no great count of me up to now; but now's my turn, and may be they '11 knuckle
down, or I '11 have to take off my coat."
"State your claims more graciously, my powerful friend," said Duke Punch. "1 belieye that jn the fresh and
vigorous West will be found the Arbiter who should take America in hand, and the sooner he does it the better.
Gentlemen, a slight banquet awaits you in the next apartment, Let us go iu and drink to the prosperity of your
Country, and to the dynasty of your King"
"But I'd like to be judgmatical, Old Hoss," said the new Sovereign \ "and if you'd auy bit of a book with
the trew principles of a King's trade wrote out plain, you might loan it a fellow,"
"It is yours," said H.R.H., smiling, and presenting his

Glorious Apollo now has reached The fiufl.
Whore he pulls up, and takes another pull;
Earth's signs arrest tho driver, passing by:
So do tho public-houses of the sky.
The First Law of Nature—and more etpniallp at a
Theatre on thejlrtt night—is Order.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1864.
NOTES OP THE MONTH.
March 7. The feast of Perpetua,
that is Judy by conjunction.
Punch for over!
March 2\. Benedict. The name
of this Saint means blessed, and
is often used to signify a bride-
groom. Why do we never hear it
applied to a husband who has
passed his honeymoon? A youth
may be supposed to have the lot
of Benedict in view when be de-
clares that he'll bo blest if he

A GROAN FROM THE

M.P. when ho gets on his logs
should bear in mind that the
standing order demands concise-
ness, and he should, therefore,
trip lightly over the heads of his

a hint from the coiffeur of a Na-
tional School, who having heads
to dispose of with all possible
despatch, is not particular to a

HINTS ON HOUSE-HIRING.
BY A CLOWN OF THE OLD SCHOOL,
When you see a house to let,
knock at the front door, and.
when the cook or hoxisemaid
opens it, chuck her underneath
the chin, or prod her in the ribs,
saying with groat tenderness of
feeling, "Karrrrrrrek I" Then
fall violently in love with her,
and at once demand a kiss, tell-
ing her " O Maeeary, I loves yer
to suhstraction I" If she declines
to let you kiss her, twitch off
her whito cap and stick it on
your lieid, »nd then make faces
at her till she screams and runs
away, of course leaving the front
door open. You may then enter
tho house, and, if you find it
empty, take immediate posses-
sion, and show your right to do
so by smashing all the furniture
and flinging it out of window.
Should the rightful owner show
himself, and seem inclined to
make remonstrance, pitch a pil-
low at him, or cover him with
flour, and, when he is half blinded
with it, hit him in tho bread-
basket. If a policeman interfere,
pick his pocket of his truncheon
and hit him on the head with it:
or if you prefer it, draw a sword
from somebody and cut off the
policeman's bead with it Then
you may live happy in the house
that you have hired, until the
r/hostof the policeman comos at
night to haunt you.

IMITATION OF H03ACS.
An attempt at a Clastic Metre in a
very tmall quantity: dedicated
to Mr. Alfred Tennybon.
The Argument is on this wise,
in the first line a Farmer ex-
presses his disgust at the detri-
ment done to his seedlings; a
Friend makes him a present of
plenty of new potatoes, where-
upon he asks his companion to
"liquor up." The commence-
ment of line S is placed in the
mouths of beth speakers; first as
wine in the mouth of his friend,
secondly as an expression of ad-
miration for the quantity of pota-
toes presented to him in that of
the farmer. The next expression
(" all in rows") alludes to thn
plan of arrangement which his
servant is following, and this
changes into a desire to dress,
go out, and do the work himself.

THE GREAT BEAUTY OF

Thei ft great beauty is, that they
provoke conversation. They fur-
nish innumerable heads for dis-
cussion. If the cook happens to
be late for dinner (and cooks ge-
nerally are), they will find how
invaluable these new " Hoadu of

able reading they will supply to
even the hungriest, as its illus-
trated pages present some new
feature at every turn. Kven an
Alderman would forget his appe-
tite in devouring its contents.
The amusemtnt, too, is all the
greater as it gives ono an oppor-
tunity of criticising friends, not
only to their faces, but behind
their backs. A Photographic Al-

For it impresses the shrewd

surance of its virtues. Every
thinking mind discerns that a
hairdresser must bo interested
in the success as well as the sale
of a preparation for promoting
the growth of the hair. The phi-
losopher, therefore, instead of
being irritated by tho importu-
nity which thrusts Bear's Grease
into his ribs, regards it with

While generous tributes are everywhere paid to the Genius of him who has been suddenly called away in the
fulness of his power and the maturity of his fame, some who have for many years enjoyed the advantage of his
assistance and the delight of his society would simply record that they have lost a dear Friend. At an early period
in the history of this Periodical he became a Contributor to its pages, and he long continued to enrich them, and
though of late he had ceased to give other aid than suggestion and advice, he was a constant member of our
council, and sat with us on the eighth day from that which has saddened England's Christmas. Let the
brilliancy of his trained intellect, the terrible strength of his satire, the subtlety of his wit, the richness of his
humour, and the catholic range of his calm wisdom, be themes for others: the mourning friends who inscribe
these lines to his memory think of the affectionate nature, the cheerful companionship, the large heart and open
hand, the simple courteousness, and the endearing frankness of a brave, true, honest Gentleman, whom no pen
but his own could depict as those who knew him would desire.
COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
If we wish to "see ourselves as others see us," let us look at
Harper's Weekly, which thus holds up the mirror to us by a recent New
York post:—
"It is to avoid a rupture with the working population that Lord Palmers ton
has refused to recognise the rebels. Ho doubtless honestly expects to see the
United States destroyed; and calculates that, when that choerful catastrophe
occurs, he will crush out democracy in England. We think differently ; belioving
that we shall succeed, and that our success will lead to inoro systematic, and at the
same time we trust peaceful efforts for the recognition in Great Britain of the rights
of labour. Time will show which is right. Meanwhile it is right we should under-
stand that it is to the dread of the British working-men that we owe the present
forbearanco of the British Government."
Harper's Weekly calls itself a " Journal of Civilisation," and it is quite
clear that this title is pre-eminently deserved by a newspaper wnich
prefaces the statement we have quoted by a remark.that British work-
VOL. XLVI.
men are Great Britain's "dangerous classes,"/"and that they are quite
prepared for revolution if the Government take any steps to recognise
the South. In the case of their so doing, says the Weekly— or the
Weakly—the throne and aristocracy of England would " crumble in an
afternoon," and the civilising influence of mob-law and its concomitants
would produce that recognition of the rights of labour to which the
Northerners' success against the Southerners will lead. Then shall we
see the British workman whittling underneath his fig-tree, with a bowie
knife in one hand and a revolver in the other, prepared to make a
"systematic" effort to maintain what civilising journalsjike the Weekly
call his "rights."

rialism might even envy British Equity the power of sending a man to
gaol for a latitude of remark decided to be crirninal by a Judge without
a jury.
WHEN TO SHUT THE STABLE DOOR.
Mb. Punch,
A Question ab.out which a controversy is raised almost as
often as a man is sentenced to death, is, what degree of madness entitles
a culprit to be acquitted of murder on the ground of insanity? Homi-
cidal monomania, it is said on the one hand. On the other, nothing
short of a state in which the madman does not know what he is about.
On both sides this question is argued with much temper and little
logic. The disputants sneer and scoff at each other, and call one
another names. The party of severity calls the other the love-and-
mercy school, and is stigmatised in return as friends of the gallows, and
advocates of Jack Ketch.
Now, Sir, I am not one of the love-and-mercy school. If hanging a
madman for murder were likely to prevent any sane person from being
murdered, though there might be some objection to hanging the mad-
man, I would not press it. I should not mind hanging thieves, if
hanging would stop theft, because the cheapest way of disposing of a
rogue is to hang him. But then I have no disposition to insist on
hanging from a sentiment of manly sternness. Simply consult the
public safety, I say. With that paramount object in view, Sir, let me
direct your attention to a little point which seems to have escaped that
of both the love-and-mercy school, and the destructiveness and self
esteem schooL This it is, Mr. Punch. Is what the doctors call homi-
cidal monomania a fact? Is it true that certain persons, knowing well
what they are about, can be actuated by an irresistible impulse to kill?
If so, it strikes me that waiting until such persons commit murder, and
then hanging them is a very unwise course. Prevention is better than
cure, even if hemp is anything of the nature of a cure for murder. If
such homicidal maniacs exist out of confinement, it is probable that
there are many people going about who ought to be shut up. Thus
much I say, although it has no particular connection with plum-pudding,
mince-pie, holly and mistletoe, because, while I do not want any other
person s throat to be constricted, I am still more unwilling to have
my own cut; and would much rather live and let live, and am, Sir,
Your thoughtful reader,
Caveto.
P.S. If deficiency of the moral sense constitutes madness that may
break out in murder, let those who labour under it be shut up too, if
madhouses can be built large enough to contain them, and the consci-
entious portion of the public is numerous enough to master them. I am
no Cynic.
Mistaken in his Vocation.
This advertisement is from a Dublin Newspaper:—
pOOK (French).—A Frenchman wishes for a situation as Cook in a
v good establishment. None need apply but those who can afford him a person
capable of cooking chops and kidneys, as he has a great objection to menial work.
So have we, and for that matter to all sorts of work. But this
Frenchman is a Nass. He would delegate to an inferior the most
delicate and important work of the kitchen. Any fool can make a
supreme a la volaille attx truffes, but very few people can cook a chop.
We shall not send over and engage this gentleman as our chef.
HOUSEHOLDERS TO THE RESCUE!
What ho! what ho! stout Londoners,
Arm, arm against the foe!
The great Steam Giant stalks abroad,
To lay men's dwellings low!
By trench and mine and parallel
The Railway sappers crawl,
Still nearer and more near, till now
They breach each household wall!
Time was the Englishman his house
"His castle " called in pride;
But that was ere the railways ran
Their by-lines far and wide. «
Yet, teach the invading engineer
That, though the assault be fell,
There still is shot and loophole left,
And battle meant as well!
As from the machicoulis' jaws
Beleaguered men of old
Rained molten lead and pitch and stones
On those who stormed the hold:
Rain on the foe hard type, hard words,
Vials of wrath upset,
And have hot water near, that they
Therein themselves may get.
Suburban villa-holders,
Through shrubbery and lawn,
Say, shall the invading chain-bearer
Stalk till his line is drawn? ,
Tearing you from your garden-beds,
Laying your flowers par ierre,
Coming in squadrons, deuce knows whence,
And going, deuce knows where!
What is the villa of your choice,
The villa of your pride,
With tunnels through its basement floor,
And sidings by its side P
Embankments blocking out your view,
A Station, never still,
And through the hours, both great and small,
The railway whistle shrill!
For compensation they may talk:
But trust this word of mine—
Helpless you '11 writhe, if once you let
Them get you in a line:
The man that in " a loop" is caught,
Perforce must come to grass,
While o'er his prostrate property
The dumpy-levels pass!
'Tis not alone each railway gash
Fair nature's front defaces:
Nor that their lines, deuce take 'em, fall
In all the pleasant places.
Were it to serve true public need,
Our rights we might forego:
But for contractors', engineers ,
And lawyers' projects, No!
Then up, ye knowing Londoners,
Who smell the burrowing rat,
Combine against the invading lines
That lay men's laudmarks flat.
The iron's hot: strike, e'er 'tis cooled
'Gainst engineers' designs;
It'may be men must needs be ruled,
But not by iron lines!;
A Demand for an Execution.
Colonel Crawlbt has been "honourably acquitted" of the charges
that were brought against him in the matter of the unfortunate Ser-
geant Lilley. The Court-Martial system has also been tried, and the
result is its being sentenced to death at a very early date. We call
upon the Duke op Cambridge and the military authorities'not to show
any misplaced forbearance, but to execute the sentence of justice as
quickly as is consistent with humanity. That the System is insane we
all know, without any nonsense from mad-doctors, and it is therefore
that we call for execution. To spare it would be cruelty to. our noble
British Army.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE COBDEN COURT-MARTIAL.
HE Court-Martial of
Public Opinion, which
has been sitting for so
many days to try Mr.
Richard Cobden,
upon the charges be-
low stated, having
concluded its inquiry,
and having decided
upon its sentence, and
the latter having been
duly referred to Mr.
Punch for approval,
the result may now be
published.
Charges.
1. That the said
Richard Cobden
did gratuitously, and
without leave had and
obtained, interfere in
a question which
chiefly affected one
John Bright, of Bir-
mingham.
2. That the said
Richard'Cobden did so interfere in a coarse and intemperate manner,
bringing unfounded charges against several persons known and un-
known, in retaliation for an alleged offence against the said John
Bright.
3. That the said Richard Cobden did manifest a desire to degrade
the English Press to the level of that of America.
4. That the said Richard Cobden did fabricate an allegation that
the English journals are written by a person called "Anonymous,"
there being no such person in existence. _ 1
5. That the said Richard Cobden is in complicity 'with the said
John Bright and a knot of noisy but obscure individuals, to array
class against class, and to persuade the illiterate that they are oppressed.
6. That the said Richard Cobden, in similar complicity as above
mentioned, desires to arouse the illiterate classes to revolution, in order
to a seizure of the lands of the rich and a division thereof among the
poor.
Finding.
The Court of Public Opinion, with the approval of Mr. Punch, doth
find the said Richard Cobden guilty on the 1st charge, but with
extenuating circumstances.
The Court doth find the said Richard Cobden guilty on the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, and 5th charges.
The Court doth wholly and honourably acquit the said Richard
Cobden on the 6th charge, but considers that he is indiscreet in ad-
dressing a certain kind of language to those whom he describes as the
most illiterate people in Europe.
Sentence.
The Court cannot help taking into consideration the eminent ser-
vices rendered by the said Richard Cobden in the matters of the Corn
Laws and the French Treaty. It also makes allowance for his infirmity
of temper, and for a certain petulance and arrogance produced by his
having attained public distinction without the usual previous prepara-
tion. It is mindful of the fact that his mind has not been cultivated by
classical or logical education, as shown by his declaration that one
number of a journal called the Timet was worth " all the works of Thc-
cydides," and his subsequent declaration that he never reads the said
journal. Taking all circumstances into consideration, the Court doth
pronounce the following sentence; namely,—
That the said Richard Cobden do cause the Times newspaper to be
regularly delivered at his house, and do regularly read the same (adver-
tisements, begging letters, and epistles from parsons excepted), for one
year. That he do discontinue the perusal of his own journal, the
Morning Star, until that journal of religion and prize-fights ceases to be
an imitation of the vulgar Press of America. And that the said
Richard Cobden do, at all leisure hours and convenient seasons, try to
cultivate a little jollity and good feeling, and a belief that a publicist,
even though he writes like a gentleman and not like an American
journalist, may possibly be as good a fellow as the said Richard
Cobden would have been if he had not been spoiled.

UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE.
Here we are again! revelling in the cakes and ale of jolly old Father
Christmas! Begone dull care, and let the memory of past toil and
trouble fade away! There was nothing in them. Surely this vacation
is a pleasant time, and few enjoy it more than the weary student, who
during the foregoing Term, has been expending the midnight oil, wax,
sperm, or gas, as the case may be, in mastering that amount of learning
sternly required of all those who would assume'.the bands, strings, gown,
and hood of a fully developed Baccalaureus Artium. "None but the
brave deserve the Christmas Fare," said my worthy friend Old Double-
chin, the opulent stock-broker, as he ladled out the steaming punch
into the tumbler of his nephew, Jack Hofper the Cantab. Within
five minutes 'after the expression of tins sentiment Hopper's health
was proposed by an esteemed friend of the family in terms that were
intended to affect the young man to tears. The youthful object of the
toast managed, however, to restrain his emotion, and winked stealthily
at me when nobody eke was looking at him.
Ask ye why this laudation and jubilation? Is it not written in the
chronicles of the Cambridge Calendar, how that Hopper, of Trinity, had
taken his degree? Undoubtedly; with this eye from behind a glass
have I myself seen it. "My son, Sir," Old Hopper tells all his old
cronies, with paternal pride, went out in the Poll." He has picked
up that bit of academical slang from the lad, and not having been at the
University himself, has no very clear notions as to the precise meaning
of the phrase. "The Governor," observes Hopper junior to me,
confidentially, "knows nothing about these matters. He thinks the
Poll no end of a swell thing. I haven't told him that I Tiad a near
shave for the Tliird Class; so don't you let the cat out of the bag, there's
a good fellow." I am a good fellow, and far be it from me to undeceive
the venerable parent.
"How did you do the trick?" I ask of the successful B.A., when we
are alone. "You didn't go in for reading P"
"Didn't I, though!" replies Hopper. "I coached with old Whippit
of Cams all the Long and right through the Term."
"Whufb's a good man," I observe, remembering that I myself had
benefited by the services of that eminent private tutor.
"So he is," returns Hopper, " but Marfitt's a better. He's my
Tailor."
"Your what?"
"My Tailor. He made an examination suit after my own design,
and a very neat thing it was, specially in pockets. I reduced all my
useful knowledge to the very smallest possible characters on circular bits
of cardboard. For instance, the leading events in the Historv of the
Reformation were condensed into two cards, each the size of a five-
shilling piece. There was, however, a fault which occasioned me some
delay and trouble on the first day. I had so many pockets, and so
many subjects about me, that I couldn't for the life of me remember
where each one separately was situated.
The consequence was, that when a paper on Euclid was placed before
me, there existed some confusion in my mind as to whether his amusing
propositions were in my exterior or interior coat pockets, in the secret
receptacles of my sleeve-linings, under the strings at the back of my
waistcoat, or in an admirably contrived slit concealed beneath the third
button of the same garment in front, or in any other part of my dress.
Once or twice, when I wanted a translation of Virgil, I got hold of the
Beginning of History, v. 46, and had to return it to its hiding-place.
The Peloponnesian War was always turning up when not required;
and as to the Usurpation of Peisistratus and the Origin of the Greek
Colonies, it seemed to me that I was made up of nothing but information
on these historical questions. I got over the difficulty by drawing a
plan of my own person, like a surgical figure, marked all over, with
numbers, and I never had any bother after that.
ORDER OF POCKETS.
1. Beginning of Grecian History to p. 40.
2. Do. of Roman History to p. 102.
5. First and Second Books of Euclid.
4. Euclid finished.
6. Causes of the First and Second Funic Wars.
7. (First round tht corntr.) Virgil, First Half of Fourth Georgia
8. (Ditto oppositt sidt.) Do. Second Half of Do.
9. (Cuffs.) Persian Wars. Thcnnopyla*.
10. (Do.) Salamis. Mardoniua.
11. Algebra. Solutions of Probable Equations.
12. Arithmetic. Vulgar Fractions. Decimals.
13. History of Reformation, Part I.
14. Ditto. Fart 1L
It worked admirably. Let us suppose that question 1, was, "Give
some account of the Causes that led to the Second Punic WarP" Very
good. On referring to my plan, there I found it. Punic Wars, No. 5,
small pocket just over the heart. Out he came, out came the treble
power magnifier, and down went the answer as right as ninepence.
And so you see what I should advise any fellow to do, who can't cram
up in the regular way, is,"
But at this moment enters the paternal Hopper with the avuncular
Dovjblechin, and the teaching of experience is for the present lost.

Parker. " Oh, Ma'am,3! did that this Mornino, and it's on the Dressing Table ready to be Pinned on !".
KING CHRISTMAS DISCOURSES THE NEW YEAR.
King Christmas comes. Of his approach
Nature reveals no trace—
No frost is on the window-panes,
No snow on earth's green face.
The air is mild: in garden-bowers ]
I hear the thrushes sing;
And but that boughs are Dare of leaves,
We might believe 'twas Spring.
And yet by all his social signs.
I knew King Christmas nigh:
By grocers' shops and tradesmen's bills,
Waits, wassail-bowl, mince-pic,
Plum puddings with the Pantomimes
Upon the boards appear;
And workhouse tables groan, that groan,
Alas! but " once a-year."
But just before her bells rang out
Upon the midnight-hour,
I'saw, in dream. King Christmas set,
In a green holly-bower.
In his snap-dragon bowl's blue light
His face looked sad and long,
The while he rocked the infant year,
And crowed its cradle song.
"Sleep, Sixty-four, sleep while you may,
Who knows, what siglits await
Thy waking, in the troublous times |
That gather at thy gate.
Since angels heralded my reign
With 'Peace, goodwill to man,'
More darkly ne'er closed old year's life,
Or new year's life began.
"How can'I lift the wassail-bowl,
Where I see blood for wine?
How with my holly's glossy wreath
Blood-watered laurels twine?
How to snap-dragon or mince-pie
Or fair plum-pudding fall,
That seem to speak of mangled limbs,
And shell and cannon-ball?
".How hear the music of the dance
While listing, near and far,
Tumbril and gun and marching host
Of nations bound to war?
How with sweet carols greet thy birth
That op'st thine infant ear
On sentry's challenge, charger's neigh,
And trumpet ringing clear?
"A heavy time hath Sixty-three,
That now departs, lived through,
Across the Atlantic, brothers' hands
Seen brothers' blood imbue.
Seen Russia's heel on Poland's neck,
And Poland, in despair,
Holding vain hands to powers of earth
That turned them from her prayer.
"But sadder sights and bloodier scenes,
I fear, thy youth await,
New year, that fain to joy and love
Cliristmas would consecrate.
Oh, when will Heaven fulfil the words'
With which thy reign began,
And earth intone, o'er buried swords,
'Peace and good-will to man!'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Ionotus.—Yea. By the English Law a woman Is entitled
to dower out of tho estates of any man who has over
made her an offer. But she must hare registered the
offer in the Central Criminal Court, and given notice,
verbally, and in open court, to Mr. Justice Wilde, or
the judge in divorce for the time'being. She is not
bound to state the reasons for her rejection of the
suitor, but it is well to mention them to the usher,
who is a married man.
Famatico.—You are wrong, and the Musical World has
The words of the opera of Faust are se-
the writings of Dr.
which was written by
latod by the Earl of Aldborough.
W. U. Sikpbom.—Timbuctoo is an island in the Adriatic,
but we do not undertake to answer geographical
questions of which a schoolboy should be ashamed.
Ah Ill-used Elector.—Certainly he got in by bribery,
and. if he did not bribe you, you were very foolish not
to insist on your rights. You may call at his London
residence, aud state your wrongs to his footman, if
that will give you any satisfaction, it, is scarcely
worth while to bring an action.
Aspikakt. —Your hand-writing is quite good enough
for the War-Office, so far as we have seen tho auto-
graphs of the clerks there. We cannot read it, but
that proves nothing. As you ask us to tell you your
character from it, we should say that you are a mix-
ture of flippancy and foolishness, with a strong dash
of dishonesty, but you may have other defects which
are not revealed by your writing. From the crowbar
style of your dowuatrokes, we imagin*
burglar. We wish you every success.
Home from School—(E. A.) The first line you quote,
14 To be or not to be, that is the ovation,'
is.from Manfred, but we do not recollect the
the pretty lines,
"Inwards, outwards, to the aide*,
Men and beasts throw both their eye*,*
Perhaps some of,our readers can inform us.
Tocjours Past.—If riding in a second-class carriage
really makes you uncomfortable, and you can satisfy
a station-master of the fact, tbo Railway Companies,
are compelled, by their Acts, to let you ride in a first-
class, for sccond-class fares. It is done every day.
A Provincial,—We know of no handy little pocket
volume giving you the addresses of everybody in
London, except Kelly's Post Office Directory. Ask
for the Hydraulic Press edition, which weighs only
two tons.
Ltd la. P.—There is no law against smoking cigarettes
in an opera box, but it is aeldom done in the grand
tier, or when the Royal family are present.
A Photographer—The lady might not have been
handsome, and might have been hard to please, but
you were scarcely justified in calling her a squinting
old peacock with a sandy wig! We are quite sure
that no such remarks are ever made by Mr. Watkins,
Mr. May all, the Storeoscopics, or any other of the
high class of photographers. Do you tout T
A Political Stc-demt.—You are quite right Federal
Execution means Mr. Lincoln's intention of executing
Mr. Davis. The slight and only difficulties in tho way
of that process are the facts that Mr. Lincoln has not
yet caught Mr. Davis, and that three Confederate
armies are in the way. We hardly know what " po-
litical text book" to recommend you, but any sta-
tioner will sell you small text copy books.
Verblm Sap.—Our*'word" in answer to your "wl w
is tho monosyllable *' Go to Bath and get your head
shaved."*
A. B. F.—Procrastination is derived from the bed of
Procrustes, and means what the pantomime clown
means when ho says "How do you do to-morrow V
Wo have no idea wnat that is.
A Lover or the Swan or Avon.—Nonsense. The
line is corrected in all good editions. It should stand,
"Full of strange oaths and bearded like the Bard,
alluding, of course, to Gray'a Bard, whose beard
"Streamed like a metaphor in the troubled hair,"
Adolescent.—We do not think that any person could
learn German thoroughly in two hours, but we do
not say that the advertiser is a quack, as new me-
thods are discovered every day. It has taken us
twenty-two years, and oven yet we always profer
asking a frieud to order our dinner in Germany, be-
cause the last time we boldly ventured on demanding
some oysters the waiter brought us treacle.
Ambitious (Yarmouth).—Your handwriting is very bad
indeed, and the sentiments you express are worse.
We do not think you fit for any situation at all, but
get six months at tho treadmill, and then write to us
again.
Spabtacub.—The Constitution can ba seen in Downing
Street on Tuesdays and Fridays, by an order to be
obtained at a personal interview with Earl RusselL
But if ou any other day you he down on the pave-
ment before tho Government offices, and look in at
the kitchen windows, you can see some of the
machinery at work.
Jane Susan V . (Birmingham.)—You wish to get
your boy into the Royal Navy. We do not think you
will, for his photograph, which you enclose, repre-
sents the ugliest little wretch we ever beheld, and he
would frighten the horse marines. As his mother,
you may think these remarks harsh and uncalled
for, but it is the duty of a journalist to tell the truth.
Fiaijustitia^ mat ceding.
Adri.oitba. — A proper person can, without diffi-
culty, get presented at Court, but we do not
recommend you to ask her ladyship to perform that
office for you until your husband has quite completed
the negotiations for getting rid of your pork-shop.
As there are no drawing-rooms just now, you wilLnot
lose time.
A City Clerk.—Always use red ink in writing to any
gentleman who is In the Army. It is a compliment
to tho uniform, and the omission of slight and cus-
tomary courtesies betokens a vulgar mind.
I va khoe.—The celebrated novel of that name is a rather
highly coloured story of Ivan the Terrible, of Russia.
The author's name was Ivanhoff, and he was a bass
singer at the Royal Italian Opera.
A Grateful Reader—We are very much pleased at
the good opinion you express of us. It happens that
we never drink anything but water, but as we have
many friends who are more moderate in their tem-
perance, you can send the pipe of wine to 85, Fleet
Street. Pay the carriage, or we shall doubt the com-
pleteness of your gratitude.
A Colours* Up.—How many tunes are we to repeat
that a gentleman bows first? Is it in accordance
with civilisation to force upon the weaker vessel the
duty of deciding whether an acquaintance is to be
kept up or not? Bow to every lady you know, and
every lady you would like to know.
B. X P.—Tho same answer, stupid man. You are
utterly wrong about the etiquette of taking wine. It
it is true that in the higher circles it is now custo-
mary to glance at the hostess when you drink, but,
by a graceful compromise, you do not distinctly ad-
dress her, but say, in an undertone, "Here's luck 1"
It may mean a good wish, or that you are fortunate
in partaking of such wine—the latter sentiment is
not usually ours when dining with the aristocracy.
A Chaplain is respectfully informed that we do nofc
keep a register of fighting-publicans.
Dejected says she sent a carte de visits and stamps to
one of the fellows who advertise that they will copy
such things, and she has never been able to hear any
more about carte or stamps. Shall wo give her s note
of Introduction to the excellent Secretary of the
Asylum for Idiots?
No Bioot.—We think with you that Don Giovanni
would be much lightened, and rendered more In ac-
cordance with the tasteof the age by the substitution
of the dance of The Curt for the pedantic minuet, and
we know that many theatre-goers are of your
Perhaps some manager will take a hint so
based upon observation of popular feeling.
A Curious Bloater.—We know that the lady was
married, and is a widow, but we are unable to inform
you whether she drowned her husband or not. You
had better ask her, enclosing stamped envelope.
Scrutator.—Thanks for the information. We had not
been aware that the word "and" occurs only twice
in all tho plays of Shakspeare. We have no leisure
for verification of tho statement, but have no doubt
you are right.
Amabel.—A diphthong may bo obtained at any respec-
table saddlers. It is a thong used for horses in the
habit of dipping their ears, and thus showing mischief.
Bright Eves.—As a rule, we decline to promote matri-
monial arrangements. We have said to persons about
to marry. Don't," and we agree with Inspector
Bucket that marriage is a thing that most people
had better let alone. But as you say that you have
blue eyes, a good figure, no relations, and £800 a-year,
we will mention you at the Clubs. You must not
expect too much, when you have so little to offer.
Husbands fetch a good price in these days. We might
fet you a Government clerk, or something of that
ind? Canyouoook?
Abdiel Wiokouth,—Read the first part of our last
answer. What do you want to marry for? Learn to
play the flute. Your photograph represents a person
quite foolish enough for that, but not, we should
think, foolish enough to marry on £1000 a-year.
Herbert de la Tour.—We cannot inform you in what
year the Great Fire of 1660 happened. Consult the
Dictionary of Dates.
An Admirer.—Tho name of Shakespeare has recently
been discovered by a contemporary to be a corrup-
tion of Jacques-Pierre, and wo consider the deriva-
tion tho choicost bit of Shaksperianity. But as tho
immortal James Peter himself says, What's in a
name? Alderman Rose by any other name would
equally have been done out of his baronetcy.
Apex.—If you think that we are going to explain the
system of Leibnitz and his Monads to you for three
ponce, you are much mistaken. It took us a week,
with our coat off, to get at any idea of the things,
and even now—but never mind that. We don't
mind telling you that a monad is not anything to eat.
not the
jhteet objection, indeed we hate shaddock. But
his proposal, that we should " in our elevated faith
in human nature," supply him with the means of
imincr tmatiiifT to his stalwart conscientiousness"
to send us back the money, is a proposal which enter-
tains us, but is not one which we can entertain.
Misbrrimus.—We don't see what you have to complain
of. Tho young lady had accepted you and your pre-
sents, but finding that you did not read Punch, dis-
missed you with contempt, and threw your presents
out of window. We do not believe that there is a right
minded girl in the United Kingdom who would have
acted otherwise. The. idea of your asking «t to
intercede I
Fit, Non Nabcitur.—Your poem Is sweetly pretty, and
original in idea, and we regret we have only room for
a verse or two. It is far better thanJniost of the
poetry in the periodicals of tho day.
TO THE MOON.
"I see thee Ahiing in the sky.
And casting down a silvery flight,
Like some fair lamp hung up on high,)
To cheer the night.
"So bright thy beam that I can read
The smallest print with perfect esse.
And sweetly falls thy ray indeed
Upon the trees.
"Thou dost not a
Is gilded by the I
But comest in tram
When day Is done."
We have rarely seen a theme treated with so much
freshness, and truth, and power, and we predict for
you a high place among the bards of Britain.
A Provincial in Town.—Since the substitution of the
Bronse Coinage for that of Copper, the coins of George
III. have greatly risen in value. If you have, as
you say, several halfpence of the year 1869, take them
to the British Museum and ask for the Coin and Medal
The officials will gladly give you seven-
for c" ~v
i sun,
mirth
Lovino Louisa.—His remark seems rude, but as it is,
upon reflection, capable of a complimentary interpr
tatlon, we think that a truly devoted, affectionate,
and ladylike girl, as you describe yourself, should
have preferred accepting it in that sense to emptying
the dripping-pan over lum. Your hand-writing beto-
kens tho thorough lady, but "impudent" is not spelt
"lmpldcnt," and there is only one " e " in beast
A Nobleman.—The best physicians recommend you to
allow no day to elapse without;washing your face
and hands. Seme persons wash the latter twice in
tho twenty-four hours, but we can lay down no rule,
all depends on your constitution.
Reginald.—Quite correct. Rlszlo was smothered in
the Tower of London for offering to marry Gory Mary,
who was beheaded in Berkeley Castle by Richard the
First on his return from the Battle of Hohenllnden.
Tunino Fork,—We are obliged by your invitation to
set your "comio" lines to music, and present you
with the copyright, but we are unequal to tho task
of doing justice to melody Uko this :—
THE COVE THAT'S LOST HIS LATCH-KEY.
Mv spicy gents come list to me.
And I will tell you brief.
How a stunning swell as ever you see
Did come to awful grief.
For precious tight did he come homo
And thought he was in Kamtschatky,
'0„dear," says he, and gave a groan,
'I,'ve been and lost my Latch-key."
Latch, patch, catch, scratch, match,
hatch, batch.
"And I've been and lost my Latch-key."
It is very clever, as are the other nineteen verses,
and we recommend you to take them to any of tho
Muric Halls, at which they cannot fall to be accept-
able, being exactly in the style of the great hits at
those respectable establishments.
Miss St. Clair or the Aisles is a pew-opener, and
complains of the meanness of two ladles to whom she
gave seats before the sermon begun, but who gave
her one shilling only. We hope that it was a bad one,
but that the ladles did not know that. We always
keep bad money by us for the benefit of pew-openers
and box-keepers, extortionists whom we detest.
Am Amort Owl.—We can but answer your abuse with
a Scotch remark: "Hoot awa!"
B. B. B. Bees don't bark.—Aliquid. We don't chew
tobacco; thanks.—Maria-Matilda. Squint, of course
you do.—Peter Quince. Ho was right to kick you.
—Lucr Sparkler. Bats are not insects.—A Bad
Sleeper. Soap is not a soporific, but a letter like
yours is.—A Lover of Virtue is at least not egotistic.
—Kino's Cross. Then he had better recover his tem-
per.—Viscountess. Black lead your stove well, and
then rub as if your mistress was looking on.—A
Ssrious Hansom. If your fare whistles on a Sunday,
poke at him with the handle of your whip through
your trap, and charge him too much.—A Modest
Inquirer. Find out, and then you '11 know.—Gosh.
Bosh.

Tulip Cottage, Dee. 15,1863.
My Sweetest Fan,
Nothing could have been more
welcome to me than your kind and
dear letter, you sweet girl. I have
read it at least six tunes in the
evenings before I went to bed, and
I hasten to answer you a few lines,
my dear. Before I turn to the
fashions I must tell you that you
are quite right in hating that
flirty Flora MacGregor. Be not
ashamed of hating, dear! O! she
is the most deceitful creature I
have ever known; and she looks
just like a dairy-maid, you are quite
right, my dearest and sweetest Fan.
And that Mr. MacIntosh with
his dry face and his ugly ginger
whiskers,—I am sure no other girl
would have liked to have him for
her husband. But Flora! And t ^ s0 glad you toy me 0f tue

Louisa, is going to have an amber-

You cannot imagine how deceit-
ful that Flora is. Last Christmas,
when we were staying at the
Grange. Flora was invited too, and
we girls, even old Miss Meggy
(who would not tell her age at the
last Census), used to loop our

skirts as then was the rage, but
Flora would not do so. Now she
is so very fat (fair and f is
she?), and cousin Robert, who
is a cnarrning fellow with his little
black mustaches, found it out. Can
you guess, dear, why? What fun
we liad about it! Robert ob-
tained one of Flora's stockings
and filled it with chaff, and then
we measured it round the ankle
and it measured 13 inches! Did

you think it very nice? I hope
you will come to see us a little
after Christmas. We think of
having two parties, and I have
made lots of yule-cakes and mince-
meat. Do come, dear, we shall be
most happy to see you, for you are
such agood-humoured and cheerful
girl, and I wish to tell you some
other things about Flora Mac-
Gregor; and burn this, dearest
Fan, and give my love to your dear
Mamma, to Julia, Ltdia, and
Lilly, and believe me to remain,
ever your most affectionate and
loving cousin and friend,
Ellen Lyttle Humbug.
P.S. Wc have the washing-day,
so I shall hear some more news.
Can you send me a nice pattern for
a tight sleeve, dear?
UNSEASONABLE FESTIVITIES.
Our Yankee friends (if they will condescend to let us call them so)
appear most thoroughly inclined to spend a merry Christmas, jv."
by the following account of their festivities, which appeared the
morning in the New York World:—
DO YOU WANT LUXURIOUS WHISKERS'? If bo, you had better
purchase Punth't Almanack. Do not stop to ask us why, but run at once and'
buy It, or you may be too late, and some one else may grow the whiskers that you
court.
"Irving Hall is already engaged for dances nvo nights in the week, from the
present writing until the 18th of February. Promiuent among these is the Ball
Ifiven by the Hebrew young men on Monday evening; the Evacuation Ball, on the
night of the 25th, by the Marion Hose Company; the Thanksgiving Ball, on the
lit of the 26th, by the shipwrights of this city; the Hebrew Ladies' Bikam Cholon
S. .dety's Ball, December the 2nd, usually one of the most brilliant balls of the
season; the Ball of the Young Men's Catholic Association, on the 14th of December;
tbo Ball of the Caledonian club, on the 12th of January, the finest Scotch Ball of the
Reason; the Biennon Coterie, also a very elegant affair, occurring annually on the
2Mb of January; the grand New England Ball, on the 4th of February, beside very
ni.Lny others of less prominence."
We learn, besides, that at the City Assembly Rooms, "upwards of
fifty balls" will enliven this unusually festive season. Among them
our attention is especially directed to—
"The 'Longshoremen's National Benevolent Association Ball, on the 25th; the
Stram Boilermakers' Benevolent Association, on the 30th; the Machinists' Union
IV'tective Society's Ball, on the 2nd of December: the Ball of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians, on the 8th of Decomber; Ball ofthoThistlo Benevolent Association on
the 10th of December; Ball of tbo 5th Regiment National Guard on the 22nd of
Li' oember—one of the most msgnificent affairs to take place during the season; on
Um occasion of this Ball a military temple, composed entirely of muskets, and
reaching from the floor to the ceiling, will be erected in the centre of the grand
ball-room; the Father Mathew Temperance Ball on the 80th of December; the
grand costume and character Ball of the Lioderkranz, to occur on the 2nd or 3rd
of February, and to surpass any previous efforts."
At the Father Mathew Ball we presume that the refreshments will be
thoroughly teetotallish, and that not even a brandy-ball will be by any
means procurable. So that here, at all events, there will be none of the
"intoxication" to which this paragraph alludes in its concluding
sentence:—
11 The Apollo Rooms are engaged for dances for upwards of eighty nights, reaching
to the 1st of April. In fact, all the public halls are engaged for every night to the
end of February, and some of them far into April. Private balls and parties were
never so numerous, and as for theatres, thoy were never so thronged. It is quite
safe to say that this winter will see twice the money spent on balls, parties, theatres,
opera, and dresses to attend them of any former season in the metropolis. This
state of things cannot last always. The intoxication the country is now labouring
under will be followed before long by a season of profound depression."
Considering the war in which the country is engaged, one might have
guessed that rifle-balls and cannon-balls were thought of in New York
just now a good deal more than dancing ones. Judging by the gaieties
which are at present going on there, one certainly would fancy that the
ladies of New York were most of them Knownothings, in respectfof
knowing nothing of the bloodshed that is near them. They can surely
have no friends or relations in the army, or they would hardly cut then-
capers while those ,dear to them perhaps are lying dead upon the
battle-field, and the news thereof may come just in the middfe.of the
ball.
Punch loves a merry Christmas, and enjoys nothing so much as seeing
young people enjoy themselves. But if Punch were far from home, and
fighting for his country, he would scarcely find much pleasure in flunk-
ing that his girls were capering in ball-rooms at the time when he per-
haps was lying dead, or dying, with a bayonet between his ribs or a
bullet through his brain.
l THE PANTOMIMES OF THE WORLD.
-formance at all the
Jogy to the tricks that
The sort of entertainment now in course of
principal theatres presents many points of ans
serious fools are actually playing in earnest in both hemispheres.
When the clown burns the legs of the pantaloon and others with a red-
hot poker, he must remind every observer, who is endowed with the
organ of comparison, of Mouravieff and De Berg torturing Polish
captives to wring confessions out of them. What are the Russian
generals but truculent zanies perpetrating extravagant cruelties with
the knout and the stick, and perhaps the rack and the thumbscrews, and
the boots to boot P And what a regular clown's trick it was of the
Muscovite Governor to have a man hanged before his pardon could
reach him, lest he should reveal the torments which had been inflicted
on him. Hang him, or else he '11 say we've been cruel!" What a
hint for Mr. Boleno!
The incendiary shells which General Gilmore is pitching into
Charleston are hideously like the fireworks which are let off on the
stage, and the carnage in both Poland and America seems represented
by the people who are knocked down and pelted with turnips, cabbages,
carrots, and other vegetable missiles. The plunder that goes on is dra-
matised by clown and pantaloon in their division of the spoil of fish-
mongers' and pork-butchers' shops.
It is earnestly to be hoped tliat the clowns who play with the red-hot
poker in the pantomime of real life will burn their fingers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"CHAMBERS (NOT) LET OFF."
Shakstxarz.
N a recent case, before Me.
Divorce-Justice Wilde,
a gentleman admitted that
he occasionally joked with
his wife about the pretty
faces in Punch—" chaffed
was the military party's
word. On this, Mr. Mon-
tagu Chambers, who was
against him, was good
enough to say that "a man
who chaffed his wife out of
Punch " was just the person
to be guilty of certain atro-
cious conduct that was im-
futed. When Serjeant
'abut, the other day, was
making the Court roar with
fun against poor Chambers,
the Serjeant described him
as " all behind his age." We
incline to "think that this
must be so. Perhaps he
cannot read anything but
legal manuscripts. At any
rate it is clear that he
does not read Punch. For
if there is one title that Punch is prouder of than another it is that uni-
versally conceded to him, of the friend of Woman, the most beautiful
lessons as to behaviour to Woman drop a gentle dew over his spark-
ling diamonds, and he invariably holds up Woman as the Superior
being. Chambers had better retire to his Chambers, and study
Punch. It may improve him in many ways, and tend to sharpen his
forensic wits, for he lost the cause in aid of which he was
enough to utter the above ridiculous speech, and
monly right.
HISTRIO ANGLICANUS.
The mock-monk who goes about calling himself "Brother Ignatius"
on Sunday evening last week made his appearance in character, and
preached in the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Munster Square,
Regent's Park; f a Church,** says a reporter of the reverend mimic's
performance. "celebrated for some time for its ultra-ritualism." The
service which preceded the monologue delivered by Brother Ignatius
was sung to the music of real Vespers; and the account of the evening's
entertainment already quoted presents the following picture of Mr.
Ignatius's make-up as a friar:—
"During the service Brother Iosatttjr sat In the chancel seats appropriated for
the use of the priests, vested In his gown of serge, with cowl and sandals; and
though, as a monk, he has of course received the tonsure, yet it was noticed to be
much smaller than that of the monks in the Romish Church.1*,

Still we '11 fight, while we can show

All our hope s in pluck, you know,
And Unabating Vigour.
TRULY AWFUL.
Bv way of apology for his tonsure, if necessary, Brother Ignatius
luld perhaps plead that it is only a little one. As is his tonsure, so,
nci may imagine, are the rest of his monastic accoutrements, the rope's-
end with which he disciplines himself, the knots in it, and the hairs of
the harcskin, or "dickey of camel's hair such as pencils are made of,
which may be conjectured to do him duty for a horsehair shirt. Indeed
he appears to be a monk travesty on a small scale altogether; the
miniature mime of a friar: for, in continuation of the foregoing account
of him, we read that:—
"He is small of stature and apparently under 30."
The following slightly altered language of a juvenile poem may be
not inapplicable to Brother Ignatius :—
There was a little man,
And he had a little fun,
So fantastic was the life he led led led.
He went to Church, and played
The monk in masquerade,
'Twas thought that he was touched in the head, head, head.
Little Brother Ignatius, in short, seems to be engaged in making a
display which may be described as the whimsical personation of a
member of the regular Romish Order of Fratres Minores.
And it Does Look Like it.
Somebody says, that judging from appearances, the National Shaks-
feare Committee seems to think that the most appropriate tribute to
the author of the grandest of Scotch tragedies is a Great Mull.
False Quantities in the Westminster Prologue! Well, if the world
has the assurance not to come to an end after that, it is a world of which
the less said the better. We should as soon have thought of hearing
bad English from Mr. Gladstone or good from Alderman Sidney.
In the name of Thucydides and all his works, let Mr. Cobden bring
this fact before Parliament even before he impeaches any editors or any-
body else. Talk of illiterate masses, after this. We have not been able
to eat more than two pounds of plum-pudding at a sitting since we read
the awful fact. We presume, of course, that the school has finally
broken up. If we haa eleven hundred sons there we would take nearly
all of them away, and flog the others twice a week till further notice.
We cannot trust ourselves to write on such a subject.
Naval News.
The great advance which our Admiralty has made in the art of
navigation is not thoroughly known to the tax-paying public. In the
hope of making people more ready to receive the tax-gatherer, we sub-
join a line which we have just cut from the Edinburgh Couravt:—
"We understand that the British Fleet is going to Madrid."
"THE GLASS OF FASHION."
Our Theatrical Managers, who adapt Messrs. Phper and Dirckes'
patent to dramatic purposes, find their best authority in the greatest of
Dramatists himself, who distinctly states that the first object of the
Stage is to "Hold the Mirror up to Nature."
THOSE WHO ARE BLEST WITH AFFLUENCE should spend a
-*- portion of their wealth in buying Punch's Almanack, and distributing it among
their poorer fellow-creatures, who otherwise might only see it in shop windows. A
thousand pounds or so, if expended in this way, would give a great deal of amuse-
ment to a number of poor persona, and would prevent the pavements being blocked
up as they are before the Punch Office in Fleet Street, and wherever else the
Almanack is publicly exhibited.

THOUGHTS ON THE NEW YEAR.
Bt WILLIAM BARLOW.
Lo!! another year hath ended.
Numbered with the changeless past.
Will my clothes, if they are mended,
. Through another twelvemonths last?
Since when last I sought a tailor j
Longer 'tis than I can say;
Yet these garments must grow staler
Ere for fresh I 'U choose to pay.
Faded cloth will hold together,
Due repairs preserve old suits:
But, though skill will clout shoe-leather,
Oh, how soon we wear out Boots!
Ah! what art avails to cobble
Uppers, cracked and full of holes,
Though we may contrive to hobble
On'and on by cure of soles?
Here's a hat, which hat h exuded
Pinguid ooze by length of wear;
Of its nap 'tis all denuded:
Hats as well as heads grow bare!
Our corporeal forms, obeying
Not. our own, but Nature's will,
Year by year go on decaying,
But our clothes go faster still!
Good for years, yet this old raiment
May outlast this mortal clay,
May 1 so have no more payment
To provide for new array!
They must spare, whose means are slender,
What they best without can go; . .
That which grieves me to surrender,
Least of all, is outward show.
Food'and liquor cheer and cherish
■ Us in passing through this Vale,
Yield us pleasure whilst they perish,
As, for instance, beef and ale.
Unconsumed apparel shields us
Best against sharp atmosphere;
Its consumption no good yields us,
Only costs so much a-year.
"AN ENGLISHMAN'S HOUSE IS HIS CASTLE."
Is it? Well, in feudal times it may have been; but now-a-days
assuredly we cannot so consider it. If the Englishman at least be a
resident in London, he certainly can scarcely call his house his own,
and, in point of mere stability, it would clearly be sheer mockery to
view it as his castle. What with Railways and Main Drainages and
Holbom Valley Elevations, his house is anything but being in the least
degree impregnable, and may be taken and demolished without a chance
of nis preventing it. Indeed, if the Railways arc allowed to go on
knocking down our houses about our ears much longer, we poor Lon-
doners will hardly have a roof to cover us; and we shall have to adver-
tise that London is removed to the middle of Salisbury Plain, or the
interior of Africa, or somewhere else where we can live secure from
town " improvements."

THE HOUSEHOLDER'S VOICE CONDUCTOR.
A Voice Conductor, constructed after an old pattern, but on a new principle, has
just been patented. Instead of being similar in form and size to a miniature
ammonite, and small enough to be carried in the waistcoat pocket, it resembles in
shape, and exceeds in dimensions, the good old ear-trumpet of our grandfathers
ana grandmothers, and approaches the magnitude of such an acoustic instrument
as would suit the character and purposes of a deaf sovereign in the introduction
to one of those intellectual performances which at this season constitute the
principal attractions at the theatres. The use to which his Pantomimic Majesty
would apply his ear-trumpet would be principally that of beating his courtiers
about the head with it. That for which a Voice Conductor has been designedly
fabricated on a scale of exaggeration, is different. The Householder's Voice
Conductor as it is named by its inventor, is intended to be carried to the Clerken-
well and Central Criminal Court, by householders who may have the misfortune
to be summoned away from their businesses and the bosoms of their families to
perform the useless functions of Grand Jurymen at the Old Bailey and Middlesex
Sessions. The householder who has had the wisdom to provide himself with this
ingenious contrivance, should apply it to his ear with conspicuous alacrity whilst
the jury-list is called over, and, when the jury are to be sworn, he should get
close to the clerk who administers the oath, and insist upon thrusting the Voice
Conductor against his mouth. By thus attracting the attention of the presiding
Judge, he may happily succeed in obtaining his discharge; although, to be sure,
the Judge may justly consider stone-deafness itself to constitute no impediment to
the discharge of that limited duty, for the farce of whose performance the necessity
of attending to be cooped up in a filthy place, and brought into contact with
disgusting brutes, is imposed upon the Middlesex Grand Juryman.

KNOX ET PR.ETEREA NIHIL!
In these days of startling and puzzling advertisements, it
is pleasant to" find that the Go-a-headers in the fourth
quarter of the world are introducing an elegant and pleasing
style of literature into their advertising columns. We
extract the following from an American paper:—
"Light and Becoming.—It is very desirable at thiB Reason to
have the head furnished with a light, cool Hat; but at the some time
we must not ignore beauty, or sacrifice appearance to comfort,
especially when there is no occasion for it, while Knox, of No. 212,
Broadway, has such elegant and becoming styles of soft and straw Hats
suitable lor all heads, as light as air, and as cool as cucumbers."
The conjunction placed between "soft" and " straw"
suggests a difficulty. Are the Soft Hats not of straw, or
are the Straw Hats not soft? We should advise this
talented maker not to put his name in the crown of every
hat, lest some sharp rival might take occasion to observe that,
whether the material was hard or soft, 'twould be incon-
venient to walk about with perpetual Knox on the head.

The following is the real text of the letter which the Emperor op
France has sent to the little Pretender who has been proclaiming him-
self in Holstein. The latter, it may be remembered, wrote to Napoleon,
compared himself and his early misfortunes with the Emperor and his
mishaps, and asked for aid on the around that, like L. N., the Pretender
was appealing to the principle of nationalities. Count De Morny
kindly got us a copy of the letter, which we have translated literally.

Possibly such music may be sport to those who march, but it may
perhaps be death to those who are awakened by it. If every Volunteer,
when next he poos upon a night march, would as he passes through the
streets just think how many people may be lying fever-stricken, or
worn out with overwork, in the bed-chambers!above linn, he would, if
he possess any right and proper feeling, vote at once for stopping the
"drum's accordant sound," and refuse to march again with music in
the middle of the night.
The Waits, who3e mission is to make night hideous at Christinas
time.Tnay have some slight excuse for it in the fact that they earn
money—more's the pity—by their music, and at any rate their torturing
comes only once a-year. But Volunteers have no such pleas as these
to offer for their noise, and the sooner they are bound over to keep the.
peace the better. What with banjo brutes and barrel-organs to torture
us by day, and Volunteers to victimise ns with their bands by night,
people with good hearing have rather a bad time of it, and one begins
to envy people who were bom stone deaf.

DOGBERRY IN PRINT.
The Public may expect some-very amusing articles on the "Holstein
Difficulty" from the Special Correspondent of the Daily Telegraph.
We were led to this conclusion by thesubjomed-paragraph in his Letter
which appeared on the. twenty-ninth ofDecemberlast. Bays the Special
Correspondent:—
*' 1 think I toM you in ray last—though realty one writes amid such a bustle and
commotion that there is no recalling the memoranda noted on the wets'-skin tabUte
of owe'* brain" Ac. &c.
The itahes are ours. IT ever man wrote himself down an ass, this is
the modest individual. Editorial kindness, not to mention self-respect,
might surely have razed out the stultifying epithet, and allowed the
tablets to remain; or the line might have been treated as containing a
literal quibble, and been harmoniously understood as "the asses'-skin
tablets of one's bravin'." This interpolation of a "Y" would not have
had much of a "Wherefore" to account for it; but the charitable
Editor could have boldly quoted the example of certain Shakespearian
Commentators, who take every opportunity of inserting an / here, an m
or n there, as the case may be, without the slightest regard to either
rhyme or reason. We doubt not but tlmtevery Special Correspondent
is judiciously chosen from among, those whose powers of quick accurate
discrimination and ready discernment have been strengthened by that
experience which partly comes by length of days, or as we may say
in this particular case, by length of ears.
PUNCH m THE WILDERNESS.'
Mr. Punch answered so many Correspondents last week that he
intended to have done with those bothering parties for some time. But
here is a genuine communication, for which he must find room. Mr.
William Jones, late of Foregate Street, Chester, who resembles Lord
Palmerston in being a cabtnet-raaker, writes to the Chester Record
(which we hope in no degree resembles its Presbyterian namesake of
London) to say that when about 2,000 miles from civilisation, that is
to say at the W. (west, Mr. Cox) foot of the Rocky Mountains, among
the Blackfoot and Flathead Indians—
"We (Mr. Jokes and«nother EngHdimanj picked up a wholo loaf of Punch, and
had a great time over the camp fire.
No doubt. We are very glad that Itwo worthy men lighted on the
leaf in question. Thus doth Mr. Punch present himself, ubiquitously.
In what part of Creation is he not found, ready to be guide, phdosophcr
and friend? Such testimonials are nothing new to him, nevertheless
they are welcome. We lcam that Mr. Jones and his friend, with their
minds elevated by Mr. Punch's wisdom, and their hearts cheered by
Mr. Punch's wit, went manfully on their way, and we trust that they
are making their fortunes. Nuggets may be Laddressed, 85, Fleet

SPIRITUAL EXTRAVAGANCE.
The Ecclesiastical Commission has endowed benefices permanently
to the amount of £160,000 a-ycar. Their income is more than £250,000
a-year. What becomes of the difference? A part of that is paid for
the management of their funds. The sum applied to this purpose is
nearly £60,000. The rest docs not appear to be accounted for; but
nobody but a too insinuating fellow would on this account exclaim,
Who would not like to be an Ecclesiastical Commissioner? A poor
fellow, however, with a wife and several children, or with expensive
personal wants, may be permitted to express the wish that he had the
management of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' fund.

ANTI-SAUSAGE LEAGUE.
Mr. Beep to brave Monsieur Bordeaux,
are much for that Congress, you know,
you and I are old Europe's police,
with preventing a breach of the peace.
"These small German Sausages kick up a shine,
And when bad men conspire, Monsieur, good men combine,
So I think it becomes us, as vigilant Bobbies, ,
To tickle the various Tcutonical tobies."
Says Monsieur Bordeaux to his friend Mr. Beef,
"To take what's not ours is the act of a thief;
And I've mentioned the fact in a way he will feel
To that little Augustenburg beggar at Kiel.
"I've hinted beside, that, although I respect
The right of a people its King to elect,
If Denmark is wronged by this thing they 're about,
The Sausages party had better look out.
Now, if Beef and Bordeaux in opinion unite,
That the fat little Sausages mustn't show fight,
And the fat little Sausages won't be denied,
They mustn't complain if they find themselves fried.
Respecting Youth.
The old maxim, "Maxima debetur puero reveren/ia,"—a precept that
should be received with childlike trust, since it comes from Juvenal—
is only another confirmation of the solemn injunction that is always
being laid upon us, that if we wish to live to a good old age, we mustn't
abuse our youth.
, , t JUSTICES' ME11CY.
The subjoined statement, which has appeared in the Brighton Eramiter,
will be read with large allowance for the hard necessity by which
British Magistrates arc obliged in the administration at justice :—
"Punished for LlviNG too Lono.—A pauper in the Cckflald Union, named
William Novum, aged 82, was charged before the Magistrate* with refusing to
work. The poor old man, who had lived twelve years beyond the threescore years and
ten allotted to man, said he was unable to work, but their worships thought
differently, and sentenced him to twenty-one days' hard labour."
Everybody must sympathise with the kind-hearted Justices in the
sorrow witli wliich they felt themselves constrained, bound as they were
by their official duty, to commit a poor old boy of eighty-two to twenty-
one days' hard labour, a sentence that includes a diet as bad as workhouse-
fare, for declining work on the ground of inability to do it at his time of
life, which must have beeu manifest. That they " thought differently"
from the aged prisoner on this point is mere surmise; there could not
have been two opinions about it. It is not difficult to suggest a parallel
to the grief with which they were agonised in enforcing the law irre-
spectively of natural feeling. Brutus felt much the same when he sent
his sons to the block, or whatever the ancient Romans used instead of
one. Or these tender Beaks experienced anguish similar to that which
rends the hearts of benevolent Russian soldiers, compelled by De Berg
and Mouravieff to wlup, hang, and torture captive Poles. Poor
Justices! Yes; we pity them very much, and hope that the cruel law
which hast cost them so much pain will be mitigated. We wish thein
very many happy New Years, and the ability to do work, if necessary,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKEEAY.
(DECEMBER 24TH, 1S63.)
He was a cynic: By his life all wrought
Of generous acts, mild words and gentle ways:
His heart wide open to all kindly thought,.
His hand so quick to give, his tongue to praise.
He was a cynic: you might read it writ
In that broad brow, crowned with its silver hair;
In those blue eyes with child-like candour lit,
In the sweet smile his lips were wont to'
He was a , cynic: by the love that clung:
About him. from his children, friends, and kin:
By the sharp pain, light pen and gossip tongue
Wrought m him, chafing the son heart within.
He was a cynic: let his books confess
His Dobbin't silent love; or yet more rare,
His Aewcome's chivalry and simpleness;
His little Sister'r life of loving care.
And if his acts, af&ctions, works and ways
Stamp not upon the man the cynic's sneer,
From life to death, oh, public, turn your gazer—
The List scene of a cynical career!
These uninvited crowds, this hush that lies,
Unbrokeri, till the solemn words of prayer
From many hundred reverent voices rise
Into the sunny stillness of the air.
These tears, in eyes but little used to tears.
These sobs, from manly lips, hard set and grim,
Of friends, to whom his life lay bare for years.
Of strangers, who but knew his books, not him.
A cynic? Yes—if 'tis the cynic's part
To track the serpent's trail, with saddened eye,
To mark how good and ill divide the heart,
How lives in chequered shade and sunshine lie:
How e'en the best unto the worst is knit
By brotherhood of weakness, sin, and care-;
How; even in the worst, sparks may be lit
To show all is not utter darkness there.
Through Vanity's bright-flaunting fair he walked,
Marking the puppetB dance, the higglers play;
Saw Virtue tripping, honest effort baulked,
And sharpened wit on roguery's downward way;
And told us what he saw: and if he smiled1
His smile had more of sadness than of mirth—
But more of love than either. Undeffled,
Gentle, alike by accident of birth,
And gift of courtesy^ and grace of love,
When shall his friends find such another friend?
For them, and for his children God above
Has comfort: let us bow: God knows the end.
TO OUR JEWISH FRIENDS.
Mr. Bat am) Taylor, from whom Punch had reason to expect better
things, has, according to the American Correspondent of the Standard,
adopted the philo-Tartar tone of Mr.. Seward, and applauds the
Emperor of Russia, not for slave-emancipation, bnt for his cruelties
to the Poles. And Mr. Bayard Taylob is reported by the same
authority, to give a curious reason why Polish men should be hanged,
Polish ladies Hogged, and Polish children piked or kicked to death by
the Cossacks,
Out of every hundred Pules, ninety-nine arc Jaws, and the hundredth, is a
We strongly commend this humane argument to the respectful atten-
tion of the Barons Rothschild and other Hebrew capitalists. Perhaps,
when the clean-shaved, cat-eved, high-heeled emissary of St. Petersburg
next comes to fawn upon the great Jews and to ask money for his
master, he may receive a pleasant answer. We should like to know
that Mr. Bayard Taylor had been mis-represented, but as he writes
i for-the Tribune, which is all for exterminating the Southerners, we fear
that his admiration for the Cossack Federals and their doings in Poland,
'has really been illustrating itself in the ahove charming
; THE FECHTER FARCES.
Mb. Fechteb's system'of production seems to have- taken a hint
from the Pantomimes, in which a tenebrinous opening scene almost
invariably prefaces the discovery of a fairy region. Purely we suppose
on a principle of contrast, he always commences the entertainment with,
an execrable Farce, in order to sharpen our enjoyment of an interesting
drama. There is something classic in this notion. The Eleusinian
neophyte, it will be remembered, was always tortured in the first irv
stance, in order duly to prepare him for a state of enlightenment and,
transport. If we cannot believe that at the Lyceum we share the
raptures of the Esoterici, we are strongly inclined to think we get some
knowledge of their sufferings. Two of the dullest Faroes in our know-
ledge have been produced at this theatre, as its accustomed introduc-
tions, which if belonging to the category that on the French stage is
described aa being merely played " to raise the curtain," were sadly
deficient in the English requisite of being able to raise a laugh..
Of course the illiberal vulgar, who have nothing of the artist in
their nature, refer the badness of these pieces to the circumstance
that Mr. Fechter does not act in them himself; but his. pro-
ceeding, is susceptible of a much profounder interpretation. It is
just possible that he has something in his design that is educational,
that he punishes us in this fashion only in order to reform us; that' in
fact* he gives us the worst of Farces merely to disgust us with their
class, and so to elevate our taste to a due reverence, for Melodrama.
Willingly as we fall into this view; which however we must confess we
have too recently escaped from beef and pudding to discuss with per-
spicacity,; we regret that the last specimen of this; style of piece which
he has given us, is obnoxious to the charge of something more than
excessive duluess. We are constrained to say, that its features i are
peculiarly; photographic—they are not only flat, but coarse.
The Lo»t Child, as it is called, produced at this house, as tk
novelty, makes out its claim to newness in the fact that it presents a
pair of Mb. Smiths, who are mistaken for each other, and a modern
English sailor, whose only exclamation consists of " shiver my timbers,"
touohes of truth and ingenuity which we doubt not convulsed the public,
in the time!of Colley Cibber, whilst.it* humour exhibits the force of
being1 embodied, in a stuffed baby, wbich is handed, inx succession to
every character in the Farce, and thus creates the pleasantry not only
of exposing each of its guardians; to the suspicion of being: its parent,
but of enabling the gentlemen to say, that theyj are. unable; to grreiit'
nutriment!
New we have the utmost possible sympathy with a writer who as
hard up for a joke, or with a dramatist who is in'agitate of temporary'
mental embarrassment, and can find no friendly Mb. Marshall to
relieve him from his difficulty; but we shall scarcely bo thought intole-
rant if we object to a class of subject that necessarily involves indelicacy,'
;or to a style of treatment that gives its spirit the most unscrupulous .
jdistinctness. We are not the fanatics or the fools, (that is. supposing
;thev are not identical) to deny the drama a certain' freedom that is
ireally essential to its spirit, but if this freedom is not to be limited by a
tolerable respect for decency, we cannot understand the. ground on
'which we are to pay so high for it. Grossncss and indelicacy are tQ.be <
|had in the streets for nothing, and are among the cheapest matters
possible for those who need their stimuli, but if they are to be sold in:
'theatres, we must consider them rather dear at five-and-sixpence. for I
the boxes and six-and-sixpence for the stalls!
| At the same time we must own that our bewilderment at) this oo-
{currence is quite as great as our annoyance. Here ia. the theatre, which,
par excellence, boasts of its aristocratic patronage, pandering to tiic ,
gallery in a manner which would scarcely be, done at, the Marylebone. i
Here is an Actor-manager, who has won his laurels as l an exponent of
our exalted Shakspeare, doing his best to sustain a taste which) it
should be his chief task to improve. True it may be\ said that this
infliction only lasts till eight o'clock, and that if we are disgusted for
the first hour, we are delighted for the remaining three; but this is an
extenuation that would onlv deepen our perplexitv. This would be, to
say, that coarseness is an allowable portion of the Lyceum entertainment,
and was to be taken in advance like the Yankees take tobacco before
! dinner. It would be to affirm that eight o'clock was a boundary hour
, at this house between vulgarity on one side and good taste on the other,
j Up to which point the gallery was acknowledged as the only audience
Jiresent, and after which it was the rule to discover that there were also
adies and gentlemen: such an arrangement we are quite aware would
I not be without certain conveniences. It would be particularly advan-
! tageous for our fast young country visitors; it would enable them in
] one evening to pass into two distinct spheres of society. Up to eight
o'clock they could fancy themselves at the Coal Hole or the Alhambra,
'and afterwards enjoy an elegant drama at the Lyceum..'

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VERMIN FAMINE.
Mr. Punch.
The Fox-Famine," which is said to exist in Ayrshire, might,
by a natural mistake, be supposed to be a scarcity of geese and other
poultry, as a rats-and-mice famine would be understood to mean a
scarcity of cheese. It used to be a true saying that "the fox carries
the goose," but this hardly holds good in Ayrshire, and will soon cease
to be applicable to circumstances in that county, unless the measures
which, under the auspices of the Earl of Eglintox and the Marquis
or Ailsa, have been adopted in regard to the vulpine race, answer
their purpose. The Fox Famine means a dearth of foxes; and if the
disappearance of these useful animals before advancing agriculture and
civilisation cannot be arrested, there will soon be no foxes in that
division of Scotland to steal any geese, if there are any there besides
those which may or may not abound among the bimanous mammals.
To attempt to demonstrate the utility of foxes otherwise than by
taking a brush and ramming it down a gainsayer's throat, would appear
more ridiculous to those who hold it than to those who do not see it.
Who would have thought of arguing with a learned and venerable
nobleman if he really had been such a monodunce as to say that he
thought Shakspeare an overrated man? Foxhunting is like poetry;
is, in fact, a part of the poetry of the nation. So is every field-sport,
and all the animals of the chace are poetic things. But so, too, is all
woodcraft, with every creature that it concerns. Foxes are vermin"; but
they are fancy-vermin: and let those who deny the claims of fancy be
anathema. There are, however, other fancy-vermin besides foxes. There
are eagles, golden and other, falcons, hawks, owls, and other birds of
prey; besides badgers, polecats, weasels, stoats, and otters, of which
one was seen the other day in the valley of the Itchen, and has probably
been since killed by some curmudgeon, lest it should destroy a few trout.
These fancv-vermin were formerly numerous enough; not too much so:
they were kept under. But now that the successors of the old English
gentlemen have become poulterers, the British fauna, under the name of
vermin, are getting exterminated, in order that the greatest possible
quantity of game may be sent to market. In such a county as Hamp-
shire, for instance, you now scarcely ever see such a thing as a kite, or
a buzzard, or a sparrowhawk, or a raven.
The Fox, I know, is a sacred animal. He is dedicated to the rites of
Horse-Worship. I have, I trust, a proper respect for that form of
devotion, and for the Fox which it adores in subordination to the
superior quadruped. But let me also stick up for the divinity of the
fields and forests altogether, for old Pan, and the fauna at large, which
I take leave to call fancy-vermin; and so no more at present from your
faithful Medium, who begs that you will accept this communication as
transmitted from the spirit of
Museum Street, January, 1864. LinNjEUS.
Sir,
CRIME ITS OWN EXCUSE.
As a medical man, who has had much experience in lunacy
cases, I beg to call your attention to the following Police report:—
"An impudent looking girl named Brown, who had been remanded for stripping
children of their clothes, was brought up again before Mr. Henry. In one case she
had taken off every article worn by a little girl except its shift, and left it to perish
on a cold winter s evening in the doorway of a shop. Two children of five and
seven years old, who had been sent to the Victoria Theatre to attend a special
Religious Service, had also been stripped by her. Other cases were proved. Ha.
Henry fully committed her for trial."
Now, Sir, I sincerely trust that tliis poor girl will not be punished-
I have no morbid sympathy with crime, but I think that we ought to
inquire into the state of her mind. There are several things that may
be urged as extenuating reasons why she deprived these brats of their
clothes. She may have visited the Crystal Palace and been struck with
the beauty of the undraped infantine figure to such an extent that she
may have been unable to resist the impulse to reproduce the objects
that had impressed her ill-regulated mind. More probably, however,
she had seen objects of greater necessity than th#se well-cared-for
children, and in the impulse of uneducated benevolence had resorted to
this rough-and-ready plan of clothing the former, a course that would
denote a bewildered sense of justice, but not depravity. Again, as the
robbing children is a crime against which, when it is committed by a
sane person, Society revolts, we may suppose that a female who would
so act must have been driven out of her senses by some real or imaginary
wrong sustained from the parents of these children or of others, and
that she was wreaking an insane revenge. Lastly, Sir, she may liave
been in love, which is in itself a species of madness, and may have
stopped at no means by which she could purchase some Christmas
offering for the object of her affections.
Surely. Sir, Society will not allow this poor girl to be sent for three
months' hard labour for stripping a parcel of children, who have probably
been re-clothed by tins time. In the name of our profession, I call upon
you to publish this protest, and am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
Crotchet Lodge. Crankey Cracker, M.D. \
LETTER FROM MR. GLADSTONE.
My dear Mr. Punch, >
You know how happy and honoured I always feel in com-
municating with you, whether upon Chinaware, Taxes, or the Homeric
poems.
Of those three courses, the second is pleasantly open to me at the
present festive period.
You will remember—for you remember everything—that in my last
Budget I proposed sacrifices of national income to the amount of about
Three millions and one-third.
But there is really no calculating the amiable elasticity of our resources,
The national balance sheet (of which I send you the earliest copy) shows
that I have lost but half a million.
It is, I know, needless to say to you that a Penny of the Income-
Tax represents a Million.
It is, I hope, equally needless to say that I shall, on the strength of
this gratifying result, propose, in April next, to take off Two-Pence
from that tax.
Will you kindly make that announcement, in order to increase the
happiness of the present season, and will you believe me, with my best
regards to yourself and your estimable family (regards in which Sir
Stephen Glynne begs to join),
Yours most faithfully,
Hawarden Castle, Flintshire, William E. Gladstone.
New Year's Day, 1864.
Wonderful Agreement Between the French and English.
There is a plan in agitation to make a raffle of the Great Eastern.
The lotterv is to be organised and drawn at Frankfort, and the first
prize is to be the Big Ship itself. This will be designated—as is usual
with all lotteries on the Continent—" le pros lot," and there is no
denying that the lucky winner, when the monster vessel is handed over
to him, will receive "a great lot" for his money.
A CACKLE FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
Dear but Unbelieving Punch,
In your admirable Pocket-Book I read a clever letter from an
able Correspondent, proving quite conclusively that Shakspeare was
a Spirit-rapper, or at any rate nad faith in the existence of the Spirits.
That another divine poet—need I name poor dear Lord Byron ?—was
also a believer in them, is fully shown, I fancy, by the words his
Manfred uses, when about to summon the fair Witch of the Alps.
Mr. Phelps I hear, omitted them; but the words, you know, are
these :—
"I should be solo in this sweet solitude,
And with the Spirit of the plaice divide
The homage of these waters."
What with the sole and the plaice (Lord B. misspells it "place")
this passage may perhaps appear a little fishy. But to my mind it
conveys the most distinct assurance that Lord Byron was a Spiritualist;
and when such men as he and Shakspeare are thus proved to have
believed that Spirits do exist, surely it is time for Punch to be converted.
In hope of tins, believe me, yours, with the profoundest sympathy,
Clapham Common, Tuesday. AnnOldgoose.
A PULL AT A ROSE.
We have sympathised with Alderman Rose upon his having been
ill-treated by the Government, who refused him a baronetcy because he
is a Tory, and beat them at Southampton. But we shall not sympa-
thise with him any more if he supports cabmen in demanding double
their fare. A Hebrew gentleman and Ins friend took a cab a certain
distance, which being measured was found to be under a mile, and
therefore the fare was sixpence. Cabby demanded a shilling, and
Alderman Rose is reported to have said that Cabby "ought to have
had the shilling, as there were two persons," and the Alderman rather
snubbed the Hebrew, who said, fairly enough, that he had resisted the
cheat on principle. Now, really. Alderman, you must not do this sort
of thing. We rely upon the Fathers of the City to help the Mothers of
the Gracchi, and everybody else's mothers, against cab-extortioners, and
if Justice goes over to the wrong side, we shall take the liberty of sub-
mitting her scales to the Jury that goes- round seizing bad weights and
short measures. We hoped better things of you, Mr. Rose, and we
are afraid that you almost deserve to be a baronet—no, that's harsh, at
Christmas time, but don't do this again.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PAINT-POT ADVERTISEMENTS.
Will somebody please do some-
thing to induce Sir Richard
Mayne, or the Lord Mayor, or
Viscount Palmerston to
smash and put a stop to the
abominable practice of painting
tradesmen's names on all the
dead walls about London, not
excepting even those which
border Kensington Gardens,
and other spots that should be
sacredly kept free from such
defilement? The notice "Stick
no Bills" is entirely disre-
garded by these puffers in
white paint, who indeed appear
to seize precisely on those
places where bill-stickers are
warned off. The big posters
upon hoardings do not add
much, it is true, to the charm
of a street-landscape: still
there is something picturesque
and quaint in their oross-
readiugs. The white paint
puffs, however, have no re-
deeming feature, and are the
greater eyesore because pro-
truded in the spots you would
have thought most safe from puffery. When one is enjoying,
say, a sentimental saunter with- one's sweetheart, one hates to be
reminded of the cares and cost of housekeeping by seeing notices
advising one to "Go to Smouch for Baby Linen," or to "Try Buoqins's
Spring Bedsteads." Nor does one want to he perplexed by questions
asking one "Who's Griffiths?" or to be tola that Ma. Muggins's
"Emporium of Fashion" is somewhere in the wilds of Shoreditch
or of Stepney, where you as much expect to go as to Cayenne or
Chimborazo.
What with ugly Railway Bridges disfiguring our streets, and Electric
Wires like clot hes-lines carried along our house-tops, we Londoners have
certainly few prospects to be proud of. But if this paint-pot puffery be
suffered to extend itself we shall expect to see or church-towers dis-
figured like the Pyramids with the names of snobbish Englishmen, who
so long as they can puff themselves, care little what they spoil thereby.
We really almost wonder a Street Advertising Company has not long
since been established, which should utilise our public buildings by
covering them with trade advertisements. If the dome of St. Paul's
were only let out for this purpose, we think a very handsome rent might
be obtained for it. The Houses of Parliament might also serve in this
way, and be valuable on account of their extensive river frontage:
while Pillars like the Monument, Duke of York's, and the Nelson
Column would do famously for tradespeople to paint their names on in
large letters, to clap the "Gent's Half-Guinea Trousers" on the statue
at the top, and group a lot of cheap and n--ot nice tailors' dummies at
the base.
THE RUSSLVN GAME OF JACK KETCH.
According to one of Reuter's telegrams from Warsaw, the Chiola
gives the following description of a bit of fun which the Russians had
the other day at YVielun with a Polish'prisoner named Szusterski :—
~* " First they slowly strung him up, as usual in Russia; tho halter then broke, and
the victim, half strangled, fell on the ground. Another halter was procured, and
that broke also, tho victim falling this timo on his head, and inflicting a terrible
wound. He was then tied by the neck to the lower part of tho gallows by a third
halter, and four soldiers pulled himiby the legs till ho was dead. The officers who
were present at this shocking scene afterwards wont to a grand dinner, where they
drank and sang far into the night."
The Russians arc keeping up the good old European amusements
which in these degenerate days are thought barbarous by the other
nations of Europe, and are practised in no other part of the world,
except the dominions of the King of Dahomey and other part3 of
Africa. They play with a prisoner whom they execute much as the
French somewhat more than a century ago played with Damiens the
would-be regicide, or as our ancestors used to play with a condemned
traitor in putting him to death. Only they play thus with Polish
prisoners of war, and not criminals, and the belligerents of Poland who
fall into their hands may rejoice in tnat they are not drawn and quartered
alive as well as hanged a la Raise. The sportive Scythians who obey
the Czar will soon perhaps begin, just by way of reviving an amuse-
ment which good old European society was accustomed to enjoy at the
expense of malefactors, to break their captives on the wheel.
Why did we break off diplomatic relations with poor Bomba f Not
half tlie good old European games were performed in his name that are
now practised under the authority of Alexander? Why did we cut
Bomba and don't cut Alexander? Because Bomba was weak and we
are afraid that Alexander is strong? Oh! Perish the base suggestion.
Of course we do not believe that Db Berg and Mouravieff are such
funny fellows as they are made out, and are satisfied that they are not
in the habit of playing any practical jokes of a painful nature on captive
Poles.
FRAUDULENT FACE&.
The subjoined advertisement appeared the other day in.a.periodical
which it would be hard to name without a previous warning that this
sort of thing will not do:—
TO THE LADIES OF ENGLAND.—Mas E. Jezbbit, thirty years
Lady's Maid in the highest circles of England, Paris, and Spain,. will forward,
on receipt of twenty-four stamps, full directions in the new and lwautifnl art of
the FACE and EYES in the most brilliant style, with
unrivalled. Address, Miss K. Ji
An advertisement of this kind will not do t o appear on the wrapper of
a publication addressed to ladies, and accustomed to lie upon any table
where it is likely to be observed by Patebfamiuas. For if that gen-
tleman should chance to take up and inspect such a publication, and
find it to be the vehicle for introducing such an advertisement into his
house, he would most likely throw it behind the fire, and decree, its
discontinuance ins tauter. He would as soon allow his sons- to take in a
miscellany of which the advertising columns contained offers to give
them lessons in forgery, as let his daughters read one by- whose means
they might be corrupted with instruction in the art. of falsifying their
own faces.
There is nothing objectionable in getting up. a. faee when t hat.feat is
performed by a fly, or a spider, or any other insect' that. a: young lady
may allow to do it for fun, and such creatures, although unable to get
up the eyes, might get into them, and at least get up the nose, where
they would produce peculiar if not pleasant sensations. Tes; this is a
very nasty idea, but not half so nasty as getting up the fice with car-
mine and the eyes with belladonna.
At the present festive season of the year, boys may be excused for
indulging in the practice of making faces, if they can find no more
humorous amusement, suitable to the time. If girls choose to make
similar faces, let them too, for the exuberant spirits of the Christmas
holidays might be permitted to produce the phenomenon of a female
clown, and grinning through the horse-collar might be practised in the
boudoir to be performed in the drawing-room. But the trick of making
faces with pigment is filthy and repulsive; and the best, and bad is the
best, that can be said in its favour, is that, being (palpable, it is a safe
protection for a young lady from any gentle violence to be apprehended
under the mistletoe.
PRESIDENT'S ENGLISH.
Another Yankeeism nearly as illiterate as "reliable" has just been
imported by the Etna from New York, in one of Reuter's telegrams.
This communication, one of those evil ones wliich corrupt good language,
informs us that General Grant is very ill, and that, as the army is
about to settle into winter quarters, it is urged by General Grant's
physicians that he should go home to recuperate." Some years ago
Mr. Buckstone, hi a farce, acted a Yankee's part, in which fie had to
say, "If I live from July till eternity, I never [shall obliviate this here
go. The formation of "recuperate" from recupero may be more
defensible than that of "obliviate" from odlivitcor, but still "recupe-
rate" is a needless corruption of Latin. Why not stick to "recover?"
Besides the French word recuperer has a distinct meaning, and signifies
to retrieve. An American might, without any impropriety beyond that
of affectation, talk about taking action to recuperate his dollars, but
how cau people who call themselves members of the Anglo-Saxon family,
use such language? As for you who owe allegiance to Her Majesty,
and are in duty bound to maintain the purity of the Queen's English;
consider all such English as " Recuperate" President's English, spurious,
base, villanous; pray you, avoid it.

MATKIMONY UNDER THE MISTLETOE.
• • A Lay of New Fear's Eve.
There were lustres on the ceiling, there was music in the hall:
The fine old room was lighted up for the happy New Year's Ball.
The walls and the chandeliers were hung with sparkling evergreen,
And the single eye-glass of the high-bred ass was fixed in a smile serene.
The young were there, and the beautiful, the gallant and the gay,
And they danced, and they talked and flirted, and they laughed m life's
heyday,
(And thev took no heed of the elderly and the stout around who sat,
"Who had waists once slim and ancles trim, alas now gummy and fat!
But some of the stout and elderly looked on with leaden eye,
And compared themselves with the blades and belles as they went
bounding by,
Fair faces, fine figures, clean limbs, thought they. How much, when
Time has fled,
Will their sides be about; will their soles, trod out, like our own
abroad be spread?
Among those stout and elderly ones there was one who had sat her
down,
A lady who bore a humble name, for her husband's own was Brown.
She smiled on the youth and damsels fair, but cared not them to scan,
For her eyes and thought but one object sought, a rosy short round man
That short round man was her own John Brown, her true and loyal
mate,
Though Brown was grey, and not only that, but bald upon his pate,
But she held him thclianasomest man alive in country or in town;
And of all womankind there was none in his mind to compare with
Mrs. Brown.
John Browtj had finished his gossip and chat, and the night was well
nigh o'er.
And Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-three was verging on Sixty-four.
Like an old buck gay, he had wandered away from his buxom and
blooming old bride,
And now he had done with his jokes and fun Jic returned him to her
side.
He made her a bow, like a cavalier, as he drew on a white kid glove,
Saying, "Will you allow me the pleasure of dancing with you, my
love?"
"I am sure I shall be most happy," was the glad wife's prompt reply,
"And a good example, faith and troth, we '11 set the standcrs-by."
Down the middle and up again, down, up again and down.
Hands across, round about, in and out danced Mr. and Mrs. Browtj,
And a noble Earl to his Countess said, "In fact they are lovers now;
And by Jove I'm told some years have rolled since they pbghted the
nuptial vow!"
So they danced and danced till midnight's tongue the hour of twelve
nad tolled,
As the bells were ringing the New Year in and ringing out the Old,
Till they danced beneath the mistletoe bough and mingled nose and chin,
So will you no doubt, dance the Old Year out, young folks, and the New
one in.

A NEW VERSION OF THE POPULAR AIR, THE
KIEL ROW.
(As tung by L. X., the great Jxutto profondo, in the Imperial Concerts at
Compiigne, with unbounded applauee.)
Weel in the Kiel row, the Kiel row, the Kiel row,
Weel in the Kiel row, I see my way to win;
I '11 lay my life upon it, upon it, upon it,
I'll lay my life upon it, soon that pie my finger's in!
John Bull might trust to Johnny,
H words were current money;
But he's no match for Boney,
This letter-writer fine.
He snubbed my scheme so lightly,
And I felt angry slightly;
Now I retort, politely,
"Your Congress f What of mine!"
Chorus. Then weel in the Kiel row, &c.
Let Austria lean on Russell,
Let Prussia brag and bustle,
But Deutschlands flabby muscle
No terrors has for me;
No Spree they '11 find the Eider;
When Denmark sees beside her
Armed France, and me to guide her,
Then whose will Rhineland be?
Chorus. Then weel in the Kiel row, &c.

JUSTICE TO IRELAND.
SoRR,
Misther Admiral Fitzroy, writing to the Times
about the Storrms and thim great nautical pests, the Tim-
pests, and such like divarsions, says,—
"There is usually about a day's interval before Irish weather
reaches England/ &c.
And who's to blame for this? Sure 'tis the mismanage-
ment of the Saxon. What's to prevent them letting the
Irish weather start the day before, and then 'twill be here
in time.
I am, Son, yours contimptuously,
An Irish Owl.
THE NEW BABY.
"That's done it!" said Mr. Punch.
The fact is, that he was breakfasting in his elegant and luxurious
apartment in the shadow of the Church of Saint Bride, the handsomest
spire, bar one, in London. And he does not read the papers until after
breakfast, for he gets so indignant with bad English, brutal relieving
officers, base husbands, and puffing advertisements, that it is not giving
fair play to his cook to mix such things up with an artistic breakfast.
So he takes them with his subsequent cigar, and meantime reads
Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.
The bells of St. Bride suddenly dashed out into a wild chorus of
metallic jubilation.
"Hallo!" said Mr. Punch, recalling his fine mind from Burton's
celestial devils to terrestrial topics. "Have I been publishing another
new volume, that the world is m ecstacies f"
His Secretary entered.
This young Nobleman, who is the heir-apparent to a dukedom, and
is qualifying himself, under Mr. Punch's training, to be Prime Minister
when Pah resigns in 1884, had divined his chief's puzzledonij and at
once said, with the most highly-bred composure, and as if continuing a
conversation,
"The Princess of Wales presented us with a Prince about nine
o'clock last night."
"The telegram must have been sent to my private residence," said
Mr. Punch. "How is the dear young lady going on?"
"Excellently."
"Hooray! And a Prince P"
"A Prince," said the young Nobleman.
"That's done it," said Mr. Punch.
"I sec what you mean," said the young Nobleman.
"I should be sorry, my dear Marquis, if you did not. Explain what
I mean."
"You would say that this" most opportune'event has clinched the
nail. That we previously felt it a duty to prevent King Christian
from being robbed by the Sausages, but that now it is also a pleasure to
aid him. That the darling Princess having given the Queen a grand-
son, the Prince a son, and the nation a pet, we are not going to let
Schleswig be taken from her father."
"Very well said, Marquis, but call it Slesvick for the future. That
is the good old title, and we won't have the duchy Germanised, even in
name. Send beer to those ringers. I must write a nursery song for the
new baby."
The Secretary withdrew, and in ten minutes had made a beautiful
copy, on pink paper, of the following ditty, and was hurrying away_with
it to Frogmore:—
NURSERY SONG FOR THE NEW BABY.
O'slumber, my darling, thy sire is a Prince
Whom Mamma beheld skating not quite five hours since.
And Grandpapa Christian is off to the fray
With Germans, who'd steal his nice duchy away.
But slumber, my darling, the English are true,
And they '11 help him for love of Mamma and of you,
And the Channel fleet's coming with powder and shot,
And the Germans must run, or they 'II catch it all hot.
We have only to add that the infant Prince will be christened
Edward Christian Punch Alexander John Bull Slesvick.
A Star in the Ice.
The London S/ar and New York Herald, in an article"which describes
all England as in mourning because the Home Secretary has not
reversed another verdict by a jury, says that Town'ley has "escaped
Scot free." We do not know what is considered freedom in Scotland,
but in this country the being imprisoned in a lunatic asylum for
life, with the alternative of coming out to be hanged, is as mild an
allowance of freedom as even Mr. Lincoln would inflict on a Con-
federate. This gushing provincial Star and Herald should be a little
more trutliful.

HARD LINES IN
WINCHESTER GAOL._
Now all you rogues and
vagabonds that comes
from far and near,
Particular down from Lon-
don town a prowlun about
Hampshire,
You makes a joke of impri-
sonment; but you '11 tell a
different tale
If you gets a time for the
wages of crime to be spent
in Winchester Gaol.
I tell 'ee what, the Magist-
rates o' the County o'
Hants ha' done,
They've passed a resolution
by purty nigh two to one,
Proposed by the Earl o'
Carnarvon, whose motion
did prevail
For to 'stablish a strange
terreeable change in the
zystem o' Winchester Gaol.
Ten hours a-bed you rascals will no moor be 'loVd to lie,
As snug as e'er a fattun pig a snorun away in his stye,
: But you '11 ha' to rise wi' the labourin' man, and your sentence you Tl bewail,
When you're forced to turn out and bustle about in the mornun at Winchester
Gaol.
Li lieu o' them easy mattresses whereon to stretch your shanks,
You '11 he upon wood for the time to come; your beds 'ool be good hard planks.
And zo you 11 git boath bed and board • moreover your diet-scale
Wun't be not what it used, for you'll have it reduced zummut like in Winchester
Gaol.
Hard labour there wun|t mean mat-makun but tough and tiresome toil,
Stiff oaknm-pickun for indoors work, light fingers fit to spoil,
Besides the crank and the treadmill too, which 'ool make you steam,exhale,
And you '11 have your fill of severe shot-drill if you goes to Winchester Gaol.
Then arter hours o' labour to study they '11 make you turn,
Readun, writun, 'rithmetic and rehgion for to learn,
No entertainun litteratoor your lazure 'ool regale;
Good books confined to improve the mind will be zufferM in Winchester Gaol.
From intercommunication you '11 strictly be debarred, i
Not only in the zilent cell, but out in the prison yard,
And no more zingin' in chapel for the 'prisoned nightingale.
Sheer sorrow aud grief awaits the thief committed to Winchester Gaol.
It isn't for eddication that thieves to prison are sent,


A CONVICT'S COMPLAINT.
My cuss light on you, Lord Caernarvin,
And the Winchester Beaks in a row—
That wotes us poor convics for starvin'
Into Anipshire jugs druv' for to go!
Wunce Winchester Gaol was nice lodgin',
As a party could wish for to see,
For poor coves which the law failed in dodgin'-
As the case with the sharpest may be.
The grub it was. hample and waried;
The beds they was cozy and warm;
And a story-book, when a cove's wearied
Of oakum, don't do him no harm.
There was none o' your nasty crank labour:
The spells at the' wheel, warn't too 'ard:
And 'twas heasy to chat with jour neighbour
In chapel, or exercise-ward.
The Chaplain wam't stiffer to gammon,
Than Chaplains'm general we finds;
And the Doctor when we'd put the ham on,
The infirm'ry was quite to our minds.
Iu short, that 'ere jug was a moddle
Of what county-jugs ought to be-
Just the place a poor convic to coddle,
Wlule the Beaks is reformhi' o' he.
Now along of this 'ere Lord Cabxkarvtn,
A motion they've passed on the Beach,
Which us pom convics' comforts a' harvin,
Work 'U double, and wittlea retrench.
From our cribs we must turn of a mornin',
Like labourhi' men on the square;
I ne'er thought, whde such poor chaps a scornin'
I should ever be brought to that 'ere.
We ain't to have no more nice'books,
For hnprovin' our minds and all that;
And at chapel they Ml queer all our flukes,
And cut off a cove's cozy chat.
Iu short, if the leaks don't objee
To do aa Caernarvin adwiscs,
No convic as feels self-respec.
Will come up at the Ampshire"Assizes.
This I calls the rewerse o' improvement,
For parties in my situation;
In short, it's a retrograde movement
To punishment, from reformation.
Give me bub, grub, and lodgin' well warmed,
And I don't care how much I'm admonished;
I rayther likes bein' reformed,
But I wery much 'ates bein' punished.
SUBTERRANEAN POETRY.
We do not regard very highly, from a poetical point
of view, the following stanza, which is affixed in the car-
riages of t he Underground Railway:—
PASSENGERS ARE EARNESTLY REQUESTED,
NOT TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOORS, .
UNTIL THE TRAIN STOPS AT THE PLATPOBJt;
OE THBT'LL COME CROPPERS ON THB FLOORS.
It is rather jumping in the rhythm, but by laying the
emphasis in the first line on "ly," aud in the third upon
"td" and "at," we mar make it read tolerably well,
and as easily as most of the sensational poetry of the day.
But we have a more practical objection to it. So very much
of the notice is mere surplusage, or impertinence, in the
legal sense of that word. We begin with "Passengers."
Now, to whom else can the request be addressed except to
passengers, therefore why their nomination? It is not
meant for the porters, wno indeed look as if .tlley were
wronged when you tell them to open a door. Nor is it
addressed to the world at large. "Earnestly requested"
is very civil, but foolish. A much stronger plirase must
be needed to impress any fool who would open a door except
at the proper place. The " carriage " doors. Why carriage 't
What other doors are there to open? The same objection,
that of verbiage, applies to the stopping at the platform.
The train has no business to stop anywhere else. The last
line we admit to be both precise and elegant. But for the
idiots who can commit such an absurdity as that against
which the public is warned, a short, peremptory notice
would be tar better. The Under-ground people should
adopt the form which Mr. Punch, who travels a good deal
by the line, invariably uses when he sees au impatient
fool trying to get at the handle before the proper time,;
"DON'T TOUCH THE DOOR TILL THE TRAIN STOPS,
YOU ASS."

forwarding us a free ticket for a year.

with

"Over the sea, over the sen,
Cometh a bit of good sense to P.
Which he - been missing too lung."
He has been reading, for a good
while, a great many criticisms, as
they are politely called, upon music.
And it appears to him that the
critics, as they are politely called,
who write these things, have been
driven, by the profound contempt
whichall decent people must feel for
the mnsic of the Music Hall, into
an unwarranted dislike for every-
thing that is simply pleasant. Now,
no person will accuse Mr. Punched
wanting appreciation' for really High Art. Nothing can be too high for
him, except game. But he denies, in the face of certain critics, as they
are politely called, that everything you Don't Like is high art, and he
also denies that ereTything you Do Like is not high art. And having
for sometime meditated a great kick at 'folks who cannot be content
with applauding Hatdn and Beethoykn fwhom no man can applaud
so vociferously as Mr. Ptmeh) but must abuse such men as write real
music that appeals more easily to the sympathies, Mr. Punch finds
something like what he, meant to say, said oyer the sea.
In the Bombay Saturday Review there Js a very clever artielc on
Pseudo-Germanism, and this r*
critics, as they arc politely called r
"It is utterly Ignored that harmony is an exact science, that, a given note being
sounded, it is a mero matter of trouble and time to 'prodnce every varioly of coord
or accompaniment of which it is capable. That the modulations, from one key to
another, can be reduced to a table, liko any other calculation, and that Vrnni'ls a
perfect master of this sort of thing, but neglects it occasionally for a strain Of
melody, which sometimes equals that of Mozart. And yet it is fancied often timt
Flotow, because ho is a German, is profound, and Vnti>l uneducated as a musician'
Flotow simply writes ballad operas, however. Meyerbeer baa written more in
the ltali.m melodic style than in the harmonic, so called German, and without his
ravishing melodies all tho harmony in the world could not have made him what he
is. Melody is the sum of musical genius. This is quite uncontested amongst those
who know anything of the subject. Beethoven's, Mozart'b, Hayun's melodies
arc just as much Italian as they are German."
Here be truths. And we should like to hear the Musiral World'
which nevertheless can sometimes say a thing which is not utterly and
altogether away from the purpose, answer tins before we hear anything
more against 11 Trovatore. We are doubly pleased to advance these
views just now, because wc are thoroughly enraged with the Germans.
No people with harmony in their souls could have played the thorough
bass part which is indicated by the tenor of German policy, and we are
discontented with their Execution, with their Pretender's'overture, and
in fact with the whole German Band.

THE PLEASURES OE A PBISON.
Playgoers may remember that the Prisoner of War gives a not
unpleasant picture of the way men somehow manage to enjoy life when
made prisoners; but a still more attractive sketch of the delights, of
prison-life has been lately furnished by a Transatlantic paper:—,
"Thf RinmoNTj rTuaoNTRs.—The Richmond Correspondent of the Atlanta
Appeal describes a recent viait to the Hotel de Ltbhy. He found the passages and
ante-rooms of the prison piled up with boxes and bales of clothing and provisions
which had just been received from the North by nag of truce. Upon ascending to
tiie upper storeys of the building occupied by the priaoDcrs, he saw the greatest
prolusion of comforts and luxuries in the way of provant that even a riotous imagi-
nation could concelva Hams, smoked beef, Bologna) sausages, hung from the
rafters ; tin cans of potted meat, oysters, sardines, green peas, Ac., were arranged
on shelving against the walls; while the finest pippins rolled along the floors. Im-
mense packages of new publications, sets of chessmen, backgammon boxes, &c,
which had apparently just been opened for distribution, proved that the Yankees
did not intend their unhappy brethren should die of rsaut. The prisoners them-
selves were variously occupied, some lying at full length on the floor, deeply in-
volved in the tragic incidents of Miss Braddon'b novels; others playing whist and
euchre, or deeply pondering tho gambits ; others asleep; others again eating their
dinners."
It is whispered that the Northerners have had some little trouble in
recruiting for their army, and that Yankee volunteers have not been
flocking quite so readily to light for their dear country as the Govern-
ment might wish. Surely this must be the fault of the recruiting
sergeant chiefly, in not pointing out the benefits of being taken prisoner,
and then treated in the sumptuous way described above. If it wereour
business to find soldiers for the Northerners, we would go about the
country with a big drum and a trumpeter to call a crowd around ns, and
then we would invite them to behold a picture painted in the very
Carousing in the South. "Look

DINNERS FOR POOR CHILDREN WANTED.
Tub friends of M. Victok Hugo, and his foes too, for that matter,
must consider his Lea Miserahles as being a good work: but a still better
work of his was thus the other day recorded by the Guernsey Star;—
'* On Thursday last, being Christmas eve, M. Victor Huoo entertained at Haute-
ville House the poor children who, for about two years, have been the constant
recipients of his bounty. The party consisted of 40 children and several of their
parents, for tho whole of whom M. Huoo provides a substantial dinner onco a
fortnight, 20 being received each week. These children are entertained without
any regard to their nationality or religion, English, French, Guernsey, and Irish—
Protestants and Catholics—being equally welcome, poverty being tho only qualifica-
tion required.
"The party assembled on Thursday having been regaled with a solid dinner and
a dossert of cake and wino, were taken into the billiard room, where several visitors
were assembled, and where, much to their delight, the children saw tho table spread
with a liberal supply of useful apparel, such as jackets, gowns, shirts, caps, bonnets,
stockings, and shoes."
Thus the outer child was cared for not less than the inner one; the
latter being comforted by M. Victor Hugo as often as once a fortnight
during all the year. His motive for this systematic course of charity
the author of Les Mmrables thus explained
"In 184S, a commission of medical and other scientific mon had been appointed
by the French Government, to inquire into the causes of diseases, such as scrofula,
rickets, and impoverishment of tho blood (anffine couenntiue) to which the children
of the poor were exposed, and which produced so much mortality among them.
The committee reported it as their opinion that these diseases were caused by the
children being almost totally strangers to animal food, and that they might be
checked by their having a meal of fresh meat once a month. Owing to political
events, this report remained without effect, but it made a strong impression on his
(M. Huoo's) mind, and he determined that when circumstances should permit he
would test the soundness of the theory propounded. He had, therefore, about two
years ago, commenced tho humble little work of which the present meeting was a
Sirt. He had selected 40 young children from the most necessitous classes of
uernsoy, and to these ho had given, not once a month, but once a fortnight, a
sound meal composed of fresh meat and a small glass of wine. And he had the
satisfaction of finding that his humble experiment had been undoubtedly success-
ful. Many of his poor little children who had boon Buffering from one or the other
of tho diseases he had mentioned had been cured, and the physical constitution of
nearly the whole of them sensibly Improved,"
A meal of fresh meat once a month is not a very costly jrift to make
to a poor child, and yet this little present may be productive of great
benefit. The stronger a child is, the greater is the chance that he will
grow up a strong man: and the stronger a man is, the more work cau
he do, and the less chance will there be of his coining on the parish. So
putting charity aside, it would be a wise economy to give the children of
poor people now and then a meal of meat, and strengthen thus their
sinews and their constitutions. There is, besides, the fact that duty
should oblige us to take care of .the poor, and on this point M. Hugo
thus forcibly insists:—<
"He wished it to he clearly undorstood that he assumed no morit for what he
had done, for it was a part of his creed that it was the positive duty of the rich to
care for the poor—a duty imposed alike by Christianity and common sense—and
that the rich had no right to spend their superfluity on tholr own enjoyments, when
they saw their fellow-beings suffering around them. Ho had, he repeated, called
theso poor children together with the view of carrying out an important experiment,
but he had also done it for the purpose of giving an example. He had the gratifi-
cation of assisting 40 children; if 20 persons would do the same, 800 children would
be cared for, and it was impossible to say what amount of good might thus be done
for tho population of the island."
We most heartily commend M. Hugo's good example, and should be
glad to see steps taken by which it might be followed. Polks in general
perhaps might not find it quite convenient to invite a score of children
once a fortnight to their dinner-tables, for we fear there are few cooks
in this enlightened age who would condescend at any price to cook for
them. But surely folks might club together to hire a children's dining-
room, where little people with large appetites might have a grrjod meal
set before them once or twice a month. Public dinners are in general
most execrable nuisances, and Mr. Punch has long since ceased to have
anything to do with them. But if poor children's public dinners were
established in this country, Mr. Punch would be most happy to assist

towards their support by giving them the benefit of his world-wide pub-

rich, and we think that juvenile dinner-parties on the"plan we have pro-

THE ORGAN-GRINDER'S ECHO.
hebe is perhaps a little
obscurity in the sub-
joined extract from a
letter in the Post rela-
tive to the pest of street-

ADVERTISEMENTS:
RENDERED NECESSARY BY THE RAILWAY INVASION.
THE KING OF TIMBUCTOO PRESENTS HIS COMPLI-
ments to his nobility, gentry, and public, and bep to say that in
consequence of his palace being required by the London, Chatham and
Dover Railway, he is removing to a temporary wigwam over the way.
Justice and executions as usual, and cold missionary on the table every
day at 2.
"The law as It now
stands, even if sufficient in
itself to abate the above nui-
sance, seems from the recent
decisions of the Magistrates,
to be impracticable; for, if
I understand those decisions
rightly, it appears that the
moment a person is giving
an organ-grinder into cus-
tody a policeman must be
within sight ot the nuisance
at the time the nuisance is
In course of commission, so
that if the grinder has dis-
continued grinding (which,
of course, he will have done)
at the time the policeman
or constable is in sight the
organ-grinder cannot ba
legally given into custody."
^ At the moment when,
a', person is giving an
organ-grinder into cus-
tody a policeman is ne-
cessarily within sight of
the nuisance, because he must be sufficiently near it to put forth his
hand and collar it, or take it by any other handle that it may afford him
in the place . of a collar; and here we may suggest that policemen
should, in consideration for their natural repugnance to filth,' be
provided with tongs for the purpose of taking hold of a nuisance so
disgusting as an Italian organ-grinder, whose clothes are always
saturated with dirt, and. who, if he wears a collar, has probably a
state of things underneath it into which the idea of putting the ends of
your fingers is revolting. The nuisance would hardly continue in
course of commission wnilst the person annoyed by it was giving it
in charge; it would hardly have the impudence to commit itself to
that extent. What the Magistrates mean to say, apparently, is that
for an organ-grinder to be liable to be taken into custody he must
have been playing within the sight of a policeman. In this view of
then- ruling, however, everybody but Midas, and the female of Midas,
and colts the foals of Midas, will agree with the writer above-quoted in
the remark that:—
"Now, if that be the law, the sooner it is amended the better."
Because a policeman with street-musical proclivities has nothing to do
but to keep his back constantly turned to the quarter whence his ears
are regaled with 'organ-grinding in order to enjoy that abomination, the
perpetrator of it remaining all the while out of Ins sight.
What follows has in substance been said_before, but a nuisance is no
joke, and the complaint of it will bear repetition until it is abated:—
"The trifling nuisances of old times, such as the dustman's bell (and I believe
even the muffin belli, the newsmen's horn, the cry of 'sweep,' and many others
have been prohibited. Why not at once forbid street-music—-or at least give the
power to any inhabitant within hearing to order the removal of the nuisance?"
The only reply this question has as vet received is that whieh has been
given to it by a " nymph unseen." There is something to be said for
the dustman s bell, the muffin-bell, the newsman's horn, and the cry of
sweep. These noises were occasional, temporary, not atrocious and
absolutely intolerable; and they were useful noises. The organ-grinder's
noise is constant, protracted, execrable, distracting, besides being most
injurious to those whom it interrupts in the pursuit of intellectual occu-
pations, to say nothing of the sick whose rest it destroys; whilst it i»
of no use to anybody, affords no one much gratification, and only serves
a little to amuse the idleness of a few idiots. Every sane man ought to
be empowered to insist on not being subject to be driven mad by organ-
grinders, and to have his serious interests sacrificed to the slight
diversion of his silly neighbours. These considerations suggest that
an Act of Parliament should be made enabling any one who is annoyed
by organ-grindingjto prohibit it everywhere wittun'.the compass of his
hearing. Indignation asks " Why not?" and the voice of Echo is the
only one that responds to the appeal. Echo answers ".Not!"

SINGING IN THE KITCHEN.
Wonderful are the wants one sees announced in news-
papers! For instance only look at this:—
WANTED, in a Clergyman's Family >in the Country, a
good Plain Cook, who understands Baking, with the usual
branches of Cooking. A Church Woman indispensable, and one that
can Sing preferred. Age between 30 and 40.—Address, Ac.
Singing chambermaids, we know, are sometimes wanted
for the stage, but we never before heard a wish to hire a
singing cook. What sort of voice, we wonder, does this
clergyman require f and what proficiency in singing is
deemed needful in his kitchen ? It his housemaid be soprano,
he may possibly prefer a good eontralto for his cook: then
with a tenor for nis footman, and his butler a deep bass,
he might get up some delightful quartettes down Delow-
stairs, ana practise now and then an anthem for his
church.
In making choice of a new cook, we suppose he lets the
candidates all stand up in a row and sing a song a-piece:
and then, after picking out the one whose voice most pleases
him, we presume he next proceeds to ask her what she
knows of cooking, and puts her through the catechism of
the culinary art.
"Compliments
when Gentlefolks Meets."
We don't know when we have been so touched as by an
article in the Standard last week. We should have cried,
but were afraid of the tears freezing on our innocent nose.
After a most gratifying recognition of Mr. Punch's genius
and all that, the Standard says that he "scarcely ever"
forgets that he is a gentleman when addressing ladies.
"Never," would have Deen exacter truth, but we suppose
that the slight qualification was in the interest of two ladies
whom we should scorn to name on such an occasion, indeed
we would not hint that their respected names rhyme to
lamp and to the capital of France. We will do anything
in return to please the Standard, except tell him that the
Tories are coming in again, wliich we Know he would not
believe, and we hereby invite him to liquor to the health of

JUVENILE NOFUN ASYLUM.
The anniversary fete of this; lugubrious Institution was celebrated
yesterday in one of the Adelphi Arches.
More charming weather for such a festival could not be imagined, a
pure November fog diffusing an air of mystery, and awakening tender
reminiscences of gunpowder treason and plot. Several distinguished
members of the miserable monde were present, whose countenances
seemed in perfect unison with the atmosphere, to which they lent a tone
of deeper blue.
Shortly after noon four-and-twenty blue-nosed boys entered the
sequestered shade, their doleful band of husky fifes and muffled drums
playing, "Blow, Blow, thou Winter's Wind, with considerable varia-
tions.
Having walked several miles without rest or refreshment, the pupils
were allowed by the laws of gravity, to stand still for an hour with their
hands behind them, while their generous Patrons derived a melancholy
satisfaction from contemplating their mottled hue. In due time sea-
biscuits of extreme antiquity (made edible by stamps) were lavished
upon the children of the mist, followed by copious draughts of soft
water from Trafalgar Square, impregnated with substances, chiefly
carboniferous, but entirely exempt from any taint of magnesia or
steel.
The Governor, Mr. Jeremiah Groanaway, with spasmodic emotion,
addressed a laboured exhortation to his voracious audience, in which
he warned them to curb their appetites, and shun contact with those
who were mere creatures of common sense.
A blue-nosed boy in tight clothes, with rigid hair, pink eyes, and
cheeks resembling masses of aerated dough, then recited a didactic
poem called The Lark and the Croaker, written for this occasion by a
gifted hypochondriac. It described a conversation between a young
bird and an old bull-frog, and was listened to with unfeigned sorrow,
relieved only by involuntary yawns. The lark, who has just com-
menced his matutinal carolling, is suddenly interrupted by an
admonitory croak from the oldest inhabitant of the marshes, who
marvels hugely how any two-legged mortal can be so void of decorumf
as to go singing about the universe when all well-regulated frogs (and
toads too, for that matter) were at home and in their watery beds. The
result of the remonstrance is, that the conscience-stricken reveller
drops gently down to earth—hushes its reckless strains, and seating
itself beside old Mr. Croaker, promises to amend its ways, ana
renounce those flights of fancy which are so intolerably painful to
croakers of every denomination.
Martha Magg, a child only nine years of age, but whose care-worn
expression would nave graced a crone of ninety, then related her expe-
rience, embracing authentic anecdotes of infants (under twenty-one
years of age), who had gone to the bad, and whom she had vainly
struggled to wean from their insane love of gambolling. One promising
youth, whose principal crimes originated in an ungovernable passion for
"eye spy eye, was blinded by mud splashed from a coal waggon.
Another still more vicious juvenile, while recklessly pursuing the
ephemeral attraction of a butterfly, received a kick from a contemp-
tuous cow, of which he would carry a memento on his head so long as-
memory h|ld her seat in that distracted globe.
Martha Magg having withdrawn in deep dejection, a rosy gentle-
man, whose name we understood was Merriman, rose up and wished
to be informed by what patent process, the capacity of enjoyment had
been eliminated from the singular specimens of youthful inanity before
him. He had been present some time, and not one smile had been
exhibited by any of those little mouths in round pinafores. "At Pekin
(observed Mr. Merriman), toes are fiercely pinched by Tyrant Fashion,

wish of every well-wisher to the present Great Festival, in electing, on
his own responsibility, to the office of their Chairman, the late antagonistic
President, Mr. D'Hummy.
Mr. D'Hummy, [on being nudged by Mr. Chick], rose and said,

The reading of the Minutes led to an animated discussion as to
whether they were framed in grammatical language^ and a good deal of
language that was neither elegant nor grammatical was exchanged. A
Member proposed that a copy of Lindley Murray should be provided
for the use of the meeting, and ollered to go out and buy one at the
expense of the Secretary.

Mr. Chick rose to explain. He begged to say that since the last
meeting, he had come to the unanimous resolution of electing himself
Secretary, and that he now, of course, held that position. In discharge
of the duties of this office, he had received and answered several letters
from various influential personages in the United Kingdom, who had
expressed themselves favourably with regard to the present National
movement. Also; in bearing this onerous but.cheerfully self-imposed
burden, he had had the pleasure of calling on a few of his friends,
whose names he would now read to them; the Duke op Tcrnham
Green,
His Grace the Duke op Kenntngton,
The Marquis op Islington, with whom he had spent an hour or so

Splupp, continues). And I must say that at Ham (goes on. talking
inaudibly).
Mr. Wickins (violently). Is this conduct intended to stifle—to stifle
discussion?
Here Mr. CnicK plucked the Chairman by the sleeve, who on turning
and seeing Ma. Wickins on his legs, bowed to that gentleman, and
after smiling affably, was about to proceed with the discourse, in
which he had been just interrupted, when Mr. Chick handed him a
slip of paper. After inspecting the writing,
The Chairman (politely to Mr. Wickins, before sitting down). I
didn't know that you were speaking, Mr. Wiggins.
Mr. Chick, in explanation, regretted to inform the Meeting that
Mr. D'Hummy was slightly afflicted with deafness; (Hear, hear !)
Mr. Wickins. Sir, I must protest against being called Wigoins.
Mr. Smith said he was sorry to interrupt the last Speaker, but as a
practical man—he repeated as a practical man—he wanted to know
what they were going to do about the Adamite Festival? That was
their object in meeting together. They had been there .for nearly three
hours doing nothing. (Hear, hear !)
Mr. Wickins was understood to protest against being called Wiggins.
nMn. Chick said he would read to them a little poem thai he had just
written in honour of ._>sh»J
Mr. Smith. Question! (Hear, hear I)
Mr. Chick. Well then, he would read to them a list of every one
who wished his name to appear in public print, commencing with those
who had forwarded a guinea specially for that purpose.
This occupied about three-quarters of an hour, during which most of
the members left the room. At the conclusion, Mr. Chick wished to
know whether they'd like to hear the names of several members of the

vote of thanks to himself, and moved that he should act for the Com-
mittee in the interim before the next Meeting. This proposal having
been also negatived, Mr. Chick said that he should do what he liked
without reference to any of them.
Mr. Wickins. When and where do we meet again?
Mr. Chick. Don't know.
Mr. Wickins. Don't care.
After this the Meeting separated, and the amiable Chairman went
back to Ham by the omnibus.

Gladstone's speech at Buckley, Flintshire, on the working
classes and savings' banks:— .
"Tho public-house, after alL ministered to the wants of mankind;
and it was not to be expected—whether to be desired or not—that
the use of stimulants by whole communities could be altogether
dispensed with. At all events ho was sure it did not become those
who were in his own condition, and felt that it was necessary to
have somo assistance of that kind to enable them to go through
their labours, to denounce the moderate and rational and Christian-
like use of tin isc tilings, (/fear, hear /)"
Yes, hear, hear! gentlemen.

Saying, "Take care to keep your heads clear,
But unjust and unwise

Beer is a good familiar creature, if it be well used, and,
with the same proviso, the public-house is an excellent
institution. No doubt when used overmuch, it is too much
of a good tiling; and when the Chancellor op the
Exchequer says:—
"But still tho public-house was not a desirable place for the
workman to spond that portion of his life which was not absorbed by
labour and sleep and food."

"proceedings." It should therefore be known that upon' the first
occasion on which the great body of those whose names have been pro-

resulted in the exclusion of Mr. Thackeray's name from the list

CONTRABAND SPIRITS AT ROME.
It seems that1 Mr. Home, the Medium, is at present studying
sculpture at Rome, unless he has by this time been conducted out of
the Papal premises, not [to say dominions. The Spirits in which Mr.
Hoke is so large a dealer, are regarded as contraband by the Govern-
ment of the Pope. We are indebted to the Roman correspondent of
the Times for an extract from Mr, Home's diary, being the record of an
examination which he underwent in the presence of the police, before
whom he had been summoned to give an account of that wonderful
autobiography which he has published under the title of Incidents of my
Life, and which incredulous John Bull has received with extended
fingers, and a thumb applied to the extremity of his nose. The Papal
authorities, however, take a different view of Mr. Home's book from
that in which it presents itself to the British sight. They are evidently
inclined to make an auto dafe of his autobiography, and the result of
his interview with them was an order that he should leave Rome in
three days. But for the interference of the British Consul^ an involun-
tary egress from the Flaminian Gate, or some other outlet ot the Eternal
City, would have added another incident to the life of Mr. Home. He
has, however, obtained permission to remain in Rome on condition of
discontinuing that business in the spirit line, which, however, he dis-
owns, alleging that he does not call spirits from the vasty deep, but
that they will come when he does not call for them. As Mr. Home
was giving this account of his mediumship to his official interrogators,
the spirits, according to the subjoined extract from his own minutes of
what occurred, had the timely kindness to suit their action to his
word:—
"Do you see tho spirits asleep and awako ?—Both. Why do the spirits come to
you?—As a consolation, and to convince those who do not believe in the after
existence of tho soul. What religion do they teach ?—That depends. What do you
do to mako them come?' I was about to reply that I did nothing, when on the
table where ho was writing there come clear and distinct nips. He then said,
'But tho table also moves 1' Just as he was saying it tho table did move."
At present we must be content to say that this statement requires
confirmation. Who are its sponsors P Roman police officers, perhaps;
but we would rather have had the phenomenon which they may suppose
themselves to have witnessed submitted to the inspection of a British
Inspector or two, of the Detective Division. The motion of inanimate
objects, naturally fixed, is represented as being so ordinary an occur-
rence at Rome, that we might well expect to hear of the movements of
moveables. Where pictures and statues are apt to wink, it is not
astonishing that tables and other furniture should be given to turn.
The Papal Government apparently ascribes these several marvels of
motion to a spiritual cause; the image-winking, however, to the agency
of superior spirits, and the table-moving to that of inferior sorts, too
bad for rectification. There is reason to apprehend that the former
class of spirits will prove to be far above proof, and the latter as far
below it. Otherwise the Pope might order an experimentum crucis for
the extraction of truth, and the conversion of heretics. At all events,
if tables are found to turn in Mr, Home's presence, notwithstanding
that of the officers of the Inquisition, it would be worth while, with a
view to see whether they would stop, to try holy water. In saying
this, however, let us not be understood as wishing to cast any aspersion
on Mr. Home, whose ambition to be a sculptor we highly applaud.
We are sure that we wish him every success in chiselling marble at any
rate, and hope that his celebrity as a Medium will be exceeded by the
fame which he will acquire by the production of works above mediocrity.
The Two Dromios.
Mons. Mathieu de la Drome is to France what Admiral Fitzroy
is to England. He is the French, as our Admiral—who so nobly
weathers the storm—is the English, Clerk of the Weather. He is often
wrong, but oftener right, for many of his predictions have met with
most signal success. The two sharp-sighted seers into the middle of
next week agree on most points, especially those of the compass, and
there is but one little difference between them, and that is merely
nominal, for whereas Mons. Mathieu is the meteorological Prophet of
the Drome, Admiral Fitzroy may be called the Prophet of the Drum.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Jakpaby 23, 1864.

BRUMMAGEM LOYALTY.
ome of our readers may
have heard that in a
certain part of England
there exists an unfre-
quented market-town
called Birmingham,
where pistols, swords,
and toasting-forks, ana
other savage luxuries
are vended for the use
of semi-civilised man-
kind. This town some
five years since, was
brought into some
notice by a visit that
was paid to it by Her
Majesty the Queen,
who, attended by her
loved, and now la-
mented, good Prince
Consort, was pleased
graciously to go there,
for the purpose of
opening a place of
public recreation and
pure open-air amuse-
ment for the benefit of
people residing in that town. It mav be known perhaps, to some
half-dozen of our readers that the place of recreation which thus
royally was opened was, and is still, called or known as Aston Park:
and those of the half-dozen who are blest with the best memories may
remember certain words in the address read to the Queen upon
the day the Park was opened, which words, we .may remind them
without offence, were these:—
'* In some towns in 'your Majesty's dominions^ public "parks* have wisely been
provided by wealthy corporations ; in others, by the munificence of philanthropic
citizens: here, also, we are indebted to private liberality for two places of recre-
ation for the people; but to Birmingham alone has it been given to securo, by her
own exertions, an anciont park for the physical relaxation—an ancient hall for the
mental cultivation—of her variously employed and laborious population."
From "the wording of the phrase "to Birmingham alone has it been
given to secure," people who speak'English might be induced to fancy
that the purchase of the Park had been actually completed, and to
strengthen this belief, the address proceeds to state that the Park "has
been acquired," and of course one might have added, one would fancy,
"has been paid for." This it seems, however, by no means was the
case; and although the address was "signed by the then Mayor and
other gentlemen of local distinction," the statement that the property
called Aston Park "had been acquired" was, in point of fact, a most
egregious tittyhopper, not to use a shorter word. The truth is that
Her Majestv was swindled out of the patronage whioh she bestowed
upon; the Park, which, of course, she opened under the impression that
it had been bought and paid for; and we now learn that:—
"A number of gentlemen (Including the Rev. Dr. Mrn.BR,"the rector) feeling
deeply the disgrace which must fall upon the town if tho purchase of the hall and
park is not completed, have endeavoured to relieve the town from such a stigma by
raising a sum of money—£7,000—with tho view to stimulate the Town Council to
provide the remainder."
A memorial to this effect was the other day presented to the Birming-
ham Town Council, and the following resolution accordingly was
moved:—
"That, in order to socure the realisation of Her Most Gracious Majesty's expec-
tation and desire that Aston Park (which was publicly opened by the Qceen) shall
be permanently secured as a place for the healthy exercise and rational recreation of
the industrious classes, and in commemoration of the auspicious visit of Her
Majesty and her illustrious Consort the Prince Albert to this borough, on tho
15th day of June, IS5S, it is expedient that the park be purchased by this Council;
and for this purpose that tho Estate and Buildings Committee be authorised and
instructed to treat for and buy (at a sum not exceeding £26,000) tho said park and
tho hall, and other buildings standing thereon, as now or late held and occupied by
tho Aston Hall and Park Company, and to do and execute all necessary acts and
deeds that may be necessary to vost the same in tho corporation,'under the pro-
visions of the Birmingham Parks Act, 1854."
The report whioh we are quoting here ^becomes so very clearly incor-
rect that we canuot ask our readers anv longer to give credence to it.
Surely no one cau believe that an amendment was proposed to the effect
that the Town "was not pledged to purchase the Park," and it is
equally preposterous to put faith in the assertion that "no vote was
taken on the original resolution, and any decision was postponed until
the next meeting of the Council." We much prefer to think that the
trifling sum required for the purchase of the Park was immediately
voted by the Members of the Council, who indeed would but have had
to put their hands into their pockets to find loose cash enough there
jingling to make up the sum required. Then of course a vote of censure
was unanimously passed by the Town Council on itself, for its culpable
neglect in not having raised the money ever such a while ago • and the
humblest of petitions was directed to be forthwith presented to Her
Majesty, acknowledging the impudence wherewith' she had been
swindled into honouring the Town, but praying that, in mercy to their
wretched wives and families, the Members of the Council should not at
present be beheaded, for then: treasonable villainy in swindling thus their
Queen.
THE MODERN SAM HALL.

My name it is Sam Hall,

For a man, for a man,

With a pan, with a pan.

All my eye, all my eye.

But as there's such good cheer,

So good bye, so good bye.
"STARVATION PARTIES."
Under the above title the ladies of the Confederate division of the
American States are giving parties upon a principle which Mr. Punch
heartily wishes could be tried here. Friends assemble for a social
evening, music, dancing, conversation, but money being precious in the
present condition of things in the South, a hostess gives simple refresh-
ments, and does not think it necessary to squander a large sum in
luxuries. To the British matron, who cannot ask a few friends without
hiring a band, laying out a costly supper, engaging a half a dozen
waiters, and causing champagne to flow like water, such an expedient
as that of the Confederate ladies must be as revolting as are the
Southern States themselves. But to the British matron who thinks
that her friends come to see her and one another, and not for the sake
of what they can get to eat and drink, and who has the pluck to offer
simple hospitality instead of indulging in sumptuous extravagance, the
Starvation Parties, as they are pleasantly called, will seem sensible
things. Why should not young housekeepers, ana some who are less
young, take the hint from the beautiful ladies of the South—or, if pre-
ferred, from the beautiful Mr. Punch. He hereby encourages them to
try. We won't talk of Starvation, but suppose he honours such assem-
blies with a title from his own household. Let a Judy Party be the
name for an evening arranged in the rational way described. Husbands
will be found far more pliable, in the matter of party-giving, when wives
point out that everybody has gone away pleased, and yet the cheque
wanted for the expenses of the night is a very'small one. Mr. Punch
hardly knows, whether he dare add that the Richmond ladies attend
"in simple dress "—but he hazards this second hint, with a full sense
of its audacity. But he strongly believes that the happiness of society
(and he lives but to promote this) would be materially increased by the
Judy Party becoming a Domestic Institution.
Atrocious Outrage on Mazzini.
Tire French Police have been guilty of a diabolic attempt. They
have sought to throw into the house of M. Ma.zzini paper shells filled
with poisonous charges. Luckily these missiles struck against the
column of au English printing-house, and exploded without harm to
the intended victim, but with damaging effect upon the conspirators.
We believe that their extradition has been demanded-by the. British
Government.

is always something to be learned, even from an idiot, and Pass-
more Edwards sends us a new fact. He states that his friend the
Member for Rochdale "has flung his name into the Stars to blaze for
ever." Still, even this novel Fact is not stated with the precision
desirable in scientific statements. Mr. Cobden has, undoubtedly, flung
his name into a great many Stars—we think that so late as yesterday
there was an article about him—but they do not blaze for ever, but only
for about three minutes, while the domestic blows them to make the
wood in the grate catch fire. However, we are thankful for any
information, and have enclosed a spelling-book to Mr. Edwards, and
when he shall be a little advanced in rudimentary knowledge, we will
ask him to learn this couplet—all easy little words :—

ECCLESIASTICAL.
On the occasion of Dr. Penhkyn Stanley's taking his stall for (we
hope) several seasons in Westminster Abbey, the learned and reverend
gentleman had to hear certain formal addresses, and make the answers
common to these ceremonies. One novel question was, we hear, put; it
is supposed to have been framed by Dr. C. Wordsworth, with a view to
test the depth of the new dignitary's research. It was as follows:—
Q. What were the first two specimens of fruit in Paradise?
Dr. Stanley promptly replied, My dear Canon, the Serpent was the
first Meddler: Adam and Eve were the first Pair.
After this the Canon went off.
THE INNISKDLLINGS AND THE LLLLEYKILLINQS.
The nation must be a very unreasonable, not to say impolite nation,
if it is not perfectly satisfied with the very gentlemanly way in which
H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge has arranged the Crawley business.
Nothing could be in better taste. Colonel Crawley having been"
honourably acquitted on all the charges which the Horse Guards thought
could in fairness be brought against a gentleman, the Duke pleasantly
re-iterates the fact, and in replacing Colonel Crawley at the head of
the Liniskilling Dragoons, gives him just that friendly hint about tact
and temper which one veteran soldier might offer to another. All the
persons who were so rude as not to like Colonel Crawley, or to give
evidence in an ungeutlemauly manner, are severely wigged and menaced,
as such conduct justly deserves, and Sir Hugh Rose is apologised
to for J having been rebuked under a misapprehension. But the
noble generosity of the Horse Guards does not stop here, and as
if to confute the base and public-house charge that the humble
soldier is less considered than his superiors, the Duke of Cambridge
makes the most complete atonement to the manes of Serjeant-Major
Lilley, by frankly admitting that there is no particularproof that he
was not a sober man "up to the period of his arrest." This generous,
soldierly, and unstinted compensation must be more than satisfactory to
Lilley s relatives and to the nation, and in the interest of the Army,
and especially of the recruiting service, a copy of the Duke's remarks
should De largely distributed. As for the ridiculous, lawyer-like objec-
tions, that Lilley was kept under arrest in violation of the Articles of
War, and that he and his wife died under painful circumstances, we
really feel that it would be lowering the tone in which military matters
are discussed by gentlemen, to enter into explanations of such miserable
details. The Horse Guards have behavea as might have been ex-
pected.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SCOTTISH ECONOMY.
S this half bad? .The Scottish
people hare always asserted
themselves to be frugal and
economic, though Mr. Punch
has never, when seated at the
hospitable boards of the north,
been able to detect the slightest
evidence of the fact. How-'
ever, Glasgow has just given
a signal proof that economy is
a Scottish virtue. Everybody
knows, or ought to know, and
be it said to the confusion and
shame of London and her
foul cisterns and abominable
water-tubs, that every house
in Glasgow is supplied, from
basement to sky-parlour, with
the beautiful water of Loch
Katrine, which is so pure that
it stands next to distilled
water in the Health people's
reports. But it seems that
the Water Committee of Glas-
gow have discovered that
"great increase is being'made
in the consumption of water,"
and the Lord Provost has been
presiding at a meeting at which
'"Conversation took place as to the waste of water, and the propriety of having
an efficient staff of officers to see that no undue waste took place throughout the city.
It appeared in the course of the conversation that tho incroase in the consumption
of water was ten 'per cent., and the increase in the reooipts five per cent., which, it
was argued, showed that considerable waste took place."
"We are happy to add. that the practical character of [the Scottish
people was demonstrated by the resolution to which the meeting came,
and of which the following is a copy:—

That In order to sot a good example to our fellow citizens, and to prevent an
entirely needless waste of the element, this Meeting pledges itself .for the future to
take its whiskey in the form of drams, or as neat as convenient, and that in any
case, after the fourth tumbler of toddy, the water shall be diminished to one half,
and, in the case of an eke, to one-third of tho contents of tho k1&ss.'i '-
We are truly glad to hear this, and heartily wish that in London we
had the opportunity of making our grog with water like that laid on to
Glasgow. H companies would give us that, which we do want, instead
of Railways which we don't, such associations would not be the objects
of hatred and scorn (unlimited) which they now are.
WHAT IT IS COMING TO.
{Ah extract from the Police Reports </1865.)
William Smasher was yesterday charged with dashing a large
stone through the plate-glass window of Messrs. Rose and Tablecut,
jewellers, destroying property to the amount of £15, and stealing a
handful of rings, value £150.
The case having been clearly proved, Dr. Cranky Cracker, the
eminent "mad-doctor, was called, and said that the prisoner was suffering
under hallucination. His third cousin had gone out to the gold diggings
and failed, and this misfortune had given such a shock to his mind
that he had conceived an insane dislike of shops where gold was
exhibited.
The Magistrate said that the prisoner must of course be discharged.
Octavius Shanny was charged with having gone to the Exhibition
of the Royal Academy, and having stabbed and cut to pieces Mr.
Millais' noble picture of Aaron and Hur holding up the hands of Moses.
Being asked what he 1iad to say, the prisoner made faces at the
Magistrate.
Medical evidence was adduced to show that the prisoner, about
eighteen years before, had bought a coat of Moses . & Son, with which
he had been, for some reason, ttispleased, and that the name of Moses
had since been enough to excite him to the wildest acts.
The Magistrate regretted that under the circumstances the police
had taken the poor fellow into custody, and ordered his. immediate
discharge.
Larry M'Twolter, an Irish lad, was charged with dashing large
handfuls of mud into the carriages of ladies who were going to the
Queen's Drawing Room.
The prisoner showed the lamentable condition of his mind by taking
a sight at the worthy Magistrate, who said he need not trouble a
medical gentleman ready in attendance, and humanely added, "Go
away, poor boy; but don't do it again if you can help it."
The prisoner took another sight of gratitude, and retired.
Janet Drabber, a domestic servant, was charged with beating the
infant children of .her mistress, and with frightening one of them into
fits with a.hideous mask, because the child, who was in bed, cried, and
disturbed a friendly little supper in the kitchen.
The prisoner pleaded guilty, but said she couldn't abear children,
they were such tiresome little wretches, always wanting something or
other.
A medical man said that the prisoner's mind had been warped in her
youth, by her mothers taking away from her a doll which she had
stolen, and returning it to the shop, and from that time she had always
hated babies aiullchildren.
The Magistrate said that for a poor creature not to like children was
in itself punishment enough, discharged the prisoner, and hoped her
mistress would take her back into her service.
George Flashington, a clerk in a bank, was charged with embezzle-
ment. His defalcations amounted to about £1,500.
There was no defence to the case, but Dr. Sneaker Weasel, a
practitioner of two years' standing, unhesitatingly declared that the
prisoner was not responsible for his actions.
The attorney for the prosecution asked whether Dr. Weasel had
received or expected a douceur for giving such evidence.
The Magistrate, with some warmth, desired the witness not to answer,
and said that the attorney himself would probably not have attended
unless he expected to be paid.
Dr. Weasel said that the prisoner had lost heavily by»the breaking
down of Birch Broom in the Derby, and that the witness- knew this,
having been at the races with him. Coming home, the prisoner said it
was enough to drive a fellow wild.
The Magistrate said that the evidence was perfectly conclusive, and
discharged the prisoner.
Louisa Matilda Fitzmountcharlington, a young lady of good
connections, was charged with stealing a diamond brooch from the
toilette table of another lady who was staying at the same'hotel.
A chambermaid deposed to having seen the prisoner enter the room
stealthily, secrete the article, and glide out. It was discovered in her
trunk, which was carefully locked, and had to be forced open, the
prisoner refusing to give up the kev.
Two eminent physicians attended, and certified that they had talked
to her, andj had no doubt of her beingjirresponsible. She had no idea
as to the constitution of Switzerland, believed'1 that diamonds were
discovered in a polished state, had never heard of an Artesian Well, or
of Savonarola, or of the differential calculus, and thought that it was
unlucky to begm'things on a Priday, or to see the new imoon, for the
first time, through glass.
The Magistrate said that [it was extremely harsh to bring such a
person into a Police Court, and ordered her to be let out by the private
entrance.
Jeremiah Grumph, labourer, was charged with setting fire to a
stack, whereby the entire farm-buildings of his employer were burned
to the ground, and the lives of several persons lost.
Being asked for his defence, the prisoner began, in a rich Somerset-
shire dialect, to sing—
"What a pity such a vine young vellar should go
The Magistrate, with much kindness, assured him that there was no
fear of that, and asked him how he came to burn the stack.
The prisoner was apparently about to make a rational answer, when a
wink from his attorney, Mr. Mephibosheth, recalled him to his proper
line of defence, and he shouted—
"I did it afore his very eight, lor, how the chap did stare,
For it's my delight of a shining night, to make the hay-rick flare."
Medical evidence was about to be called to prove, as we understood,
that the prisoner's mind had been fearfully excited about fires, ever
since an itinerant lecturer had recited in his presence Lord Macaulay's
poem on the kindling of the Armada-beacons, but
The Magistrate said that he should expect and deserve to be mobbed
as he went home if he detained such a man, and ordered his immediate
discharge.
The prisoner asked, very quietly, for money to take him back to the
place where he had been in service, and this was at once given him out
of the poor-box.

THE COMING ELECTION.
There will probably next summer be a general elect ion, and we really think that 1
during their vacation our M. P.'s would be wise to spare a small shoe of their
leisure to prepare and ponder over their next year's election speeches. The toils |
of hunting, snooting, fishing, and other highly necessary senatorial occupations,
are of course, wc know, of far superior importance to any mere political study or
employment; and we are aware that many Members consider they best do their
duty to their country by living out of town, and out of troublesome Saint Stephen's,
as much as ever their constituents will suffer them to do so. Still in the finest
sporting season there must sometimes be wet days when in-door labour is accept-
able, and the preparing of a hustings speech is just that easy sort of work, which
when one is in the country, one feels competent to do.
Now there .ore two subjects wlu'ch seem just now of paramount importance,
and on which, when any candidate appears upon t he hustings, it is pretty certain t hat
he will be sharply questioned. Street Music is one of them, and Railway Inroads
the other: and it is clear that on the views which he maintains upon these subjects
his election or rejection will in chief degree depend. Do you like Street Music P
will be the first question proposed to him. Will you oppose new Railway Inroads?
he, no doubt, will next be asked; and if lie misplaces his affirmative and negative,
we shall, in point of Parliament, regard him as a cherub, and would give little for
his chance of getting a seat there. Unthinking persons possibly may argue, that
these matters arc mere London subjects, and that country candidates will not
be bored about them. But Punch hereby gives notice that he will not give his
support to any candidate who shirks the test-points he has mentioned: and any
Member who gets in by holding wrong views on these subjects, Punch intends to
bully, browbeat, joke, quiz, ridicule, make fun of, and turn into contempt, until that
Member gives up liis opinions or his seat.

A Brace of Dictators.
One Dictator at a time might be thought to be enough for even a
Republic; but according to RbtjtER :—
"The iron-clad Dictator has been successfully launched at New York."
So that there is an iron clad Dictator at New York, whilst there is. also a
shoddy-clad Dictator at Washington.
Madame La France is tossing
Uneasy, in her sleep;
The opiates she's been dosed with
No more bring slumbers deep.
"La Gloire's" morphine, for which she used
To crave, is waved away;
She kicks against the chloroform
Of " L'Empire e'est la Pais; '*
And even rejects the opium pill
Of "La Prospe'rile.'"
The "little games," that used to cheat
Her sick hours, lose their charm;
"Saving Society" won't chouse,
Nor Spectre Rouge" alarm.
She looks at her strait-waistcoat;
Feels where she has been bled:
Puts her hand with a dreamy look,
Up to her shaven head-
Feeling for Freedom's aureole,
Finds le tricorne instead:
Has doubts whether these douches
Of debt and tax and loan,
Prescribed by her kind doctor,
Were not best let alone;
Feels that her pulse beats steady;
Finds her limbs want free play;
Is hungry but would like her food''
Dressed in another way:
"Not a Vlmperiale" she cries,
But "a la Libcrte."
If this go on, Madame may soon
Of her rigime complain;
May e'en insist on getting up
And going out again!
Burst, Samson-like, the safety-bands
That swathe her, limb and side,
Tear her strait-waistcoat, e'en kick out
Her Keeper true and tried—
Against such dangerous symptoms,
'Tis urgent to provide.
What's to be done—bleed? blister?
No: first, our Congress bolus—
But Europe's M.D.'s shake their heads,
And leave our Doctor solus!
Try Avertissement-aiio&yue—
It don't work as it used:
De Morny's tonic bitters—
They 're scoffed at and refused:
Quick—Madame grows more restless—
The Doctor she's abused!
Ha! an idea! History tells
How Rome escaped the Gauls,
Thanks to a timely goose that hissed
From Capitolian walls.
But Paris has so many geese
Hissing into her ears,
Their voice may well be impotent
To stir or still her fears;
But she trusts Quacks: let fly a Duck!
And lo that Duck appears!
No common Canard, weakly fledged
From the Press hatching-pen:
From Reuter's office flown at nine,
To be knocked down at ten:
No Bourse lame-duck that waddles out,
But scarce its legs can feel,
Till it's caught, neck-wrung, plucked and picked,
Yet barely makes a meal—
Un Canard Colossal! to set
Weak eyes and brains a-reel!
Blood-red the colour of its wings,
(They '11 loom large in the air);
Stuffed full of bombs (they won t be cliarged
But look as if they were);

QUACKERY CRYING OUT.
The Quacks are greatly alarmed by the prospect of an additional
clause to the New Medical Bill, which', threatens to deprive them of
what they call their copyright in those notorious names under which
their specifics are advertised. One of these fellows, the other day, had
the impudence to write to one of the bronze papers, in vindication
of the craft by which they get their wealth, a letter, which thus
fear the result" of an inquiry which would be dreaded by some other
persons. Those others, of course, are the regularly educated physicians
and surgeqns, who differ from the patent medicine proprietors only in
having first received a general education, and then having carefully and
minutely studied anatomy, physiology, chemistry, nosology, and thera-
peutics, instead of having confined their studies to the practioe of
puffery.
The conclusion of this fellow's epistle is a fine example of that flatu-
lence which is incurable by any medicine:—
1 Incompetency, is it
"After that
1 in the i
. before referred to, of professional incompetency, is it
. of hummity' that these self-constituted guardians of the public
health should bo allowed wholly and solely to monopolise the practice! Medical
science. Sir! is this the only result of the accumulated knowledge of'tile medical
body, that 'they are still living in tho dark ages of medicine?' Then to whom aro
the afflicted to look if patent medicines are abolished?—1 am, Sir, yours, Ac., J.P."
"Kensington Park, Jan. 9.".
It is not difficult to understand whom the Quack speaks of as the
"self-constituted guardians of the public health." They are the medical
profession in general, and in particular the members of the Council
which regulates its affairs. But these gentlemen are constituted
guardians of the public health by Act of Parliament, and what the
Quack fears and deprecates is the enlargement of their authority, at his
cost. "To whom are the afflicted to look if patent medicines are
abolished?" To a respectable practitioner, who will prescribe for them
what is suitable for their complaint, and who will know what is the
matter with them. That is more than they know themselves, so that
when they take a specific remedy, supposing there is one, they-must
doubt whether they are taking the right, unless they are such fools as
to be incapable of thought, or to be capable of believing in a patent
medicine which cures all diseases, a panacea like that which Mil. J.P.
is most likely interested in the sale of.
"THE NEW MEDICAL BILL.
"To the Editor of the 'Daily Telegraph.'
M sir,—In fair'plsy, and also 'in the interest of humanity,' I trust you will allow
me, on behalf of the patent medicine vendors, a reply to 'J. R. W. S.,' as regards
bis statement on the compounding and prescribing of .patent medicines. In tho
AM place, it is a fact known to every one that it has boen chiefly by eschewing tho
use of those violent remedies to which he refers that patent medicines have generally
been so successful; and as regards that old stereotyped objection of tho one remedy
for so many forms of disease, I ask, in reply, why so many remedios are necessary
for the one simple object—the correction of the stomach and intestines ; for it is
upon the right function of these organs that health and disease depend."
It is perhaps allowable to answer a quack's question, for the benefit
of those whom it is meant to humbug. ■ Why are so many remedies
necessary for the correction of the stomach and intestines? Because
there are very many different states of the stomach and intestines, and
the other digestive organs not mentioned by the Quack, to the correction
of which different remedies are adapted. Moreover there are other
organs of the body, besides the digestive, upon whose right functions
health and disease depend, and on which medicines may be required to
act, so that the 'one simple object' of remedies is not 'the correction
of the stomach and intestines,' for which purpose the Correspondent of
the newspaper above quoted is doubtless the proprietor of some com-
pound advertised as infallible.
The Quack goes on to cite certain admissions on the part of medical
lecturers of the imperfection of medical science; whereon he remarks:—
"If this is a tTiie reflex of tho medical scionco of the present day, it is high time
that this gigantic medical monopoly should be abolished, and that tho efforts of
legislators should be exerted, not in fettering the bands of men who do understand
tho theory of cause and effect, and can comprehend the nature and action of the
remedies they employ, but rather in instituting a fair inquiry into the merits of the
several systems; and the patent medicine proprietors will not fear the result."
The men whose hands legislators should not try to fetter, because
they do understand the theory of cause and effect, by which the Quack
probably means the connection between cause ana effect, and who can
comprehend the nature and action of the remedies they employ, are,
according to him, the proprietors of patent medicines. They will not
UNTHINKING BEGGAES.
Mr. Punch,
The numerous beggars who, at this inclement season, are
accustomed to appear in the streets, suggest the inquiry, what is the
cause which most generally reduces people to poverty? The answer
that may too readily be given is, their own fault. This is- a mistake.
I would rather say, their own stupidity. What strongly impresses me
with the belief that pecuniary destitution is chiefly attributable to want
of sense, is the utter absence of all consideration which beggars usually
exhibit in the very act of soliciting charity of passengers.
A stout old gentleman, of an appearance which his friends may style
apoplectic, is walking along the street, tightly buttoned up in an over-
coat without pockets. Around his neck a railway wrapper is folded
several times, and his hands are enveloped in thick worsted gloves
encircled with a large roll of fur at the wrists. What possible induce-
ment, think you, shall prevail upon this old gentleman to undo his
accoutrements, throw himself open, and let the cold air into his bosom
and the pit of his stomach? Yet a street-beggar will get in the way of
this old gentleman, and without one thought of what he is asking nim
to do, will say, " Gentleman, please yer honour, bar yer got ar a copper
to give a poor man to buy 'im a bit o' bread." Have I got a copper!—
he means a bronze. Where, does he suppose? A copper!—that is
all he conceives that his request amounts to. A copper in an old gentle-
man's pocket is a simple copper to him; a Peter Bell of a beggar.
How is it to be got out? Does he expect this old gentleman to
unbutton his overcoat—for which purpose he must previously take off
his gloves and put them into his mouth, or else let them drop, and then
unwind the wrapper from around his throat—next to unoutton his
undercoat, and fumble in his waistcoat pockets, first in one and then
in the other, then in each of his coat pockets, and lastly in the pockets
of his trousers, to see if he can find a .penny or a halfpenny-^-probably
without success?
The deficiency of observation, perception, reason, and judgment, the
total vacuity of mind that alone could admit of so absurd an expecta-
tion, would render any person labouring under it incapable of managing
the commonest affairs, of preserving any property, or earning any sub-
sistence. Imagine to yourself this old gentleman taking himself to
pieces before the public in the manner above detailed; a spectacle to
the bystanders! It is what he is asked to do a dozen times every day
in the course of his constitutional. This has taught him rather to pity
the obtuseness than to blame the depravity of beggars. He is
Your humble Servant, Senex.
*«* There is much acuteness in our correspondent's remarks on
the thoughtless importunity of beggars. They ought to know that he
has subscribed.as much as he can afford to soup-kitchens, and put ail
his spare coppers into the poor box.—Punch.

FLUNKEIANA.
John Thomas Gorgeous. "I tell you what it ib. Cook! Fm a'most wobk out with them Leos o" Mutton and Legs o' Pork, and
I THINK IT'S 'IGH TIME SOME NEW HaNIMAL WAS INWKNTED!"
THE LONGEST JOKE ON RECOED.
Mk. Falconer must be regarded as the most stupendous of modern
jokers. He has concocted a Jeu d'Etprit which it takes two hours and
a-half to utter. He has written a drama called Night and Morn, the sole
purpose of which is to show that solitary confinement for twenty years
is a piece of experience that may be laughed at!
The ignorant world has fancied hitherto, that solitary confinement,
even for a year or two, has something horrible about it,—that it tends
to turn a bad man into a savage, and a good one into an idiot. There
have been philanthropists who have gone so far even as to denounce it
as a prolonged murder,—the mere withering a man to death, by which
society indulges in a brutal revenge upon a criminal instead of endea-
vouring to bring him to some sense of his misconduct. Whether these
views be true or not, it has been pretty generally believed that such a
punishment tends at least to numb the faculties, whiten the hair, and
rather effectually damp the spirits.
Mr. Falconer, however, assures us that we are entirely wrong upon
the point. He contends that solitary confinement, even for the space of
twenty years, may be endured without any damage either to the person
or the feelings. His hero, a worthy fellow, who has been unjustly caged
by an Italian duke, effects his escape from his dungeon without a grey
hair on his head or a wrinkle on his brow, and a decided feeling that his
long entombment was, after all, a pleasant adventure. So far from being
troubled with the ordinary feelings in such a case—the dulness, sadness,
or vindictivcness, that one would think proper to poor humanity—he has
not even a sense of annoyance. He jokes with his gaoler on the eve of his
escaping; he enjoys heartily the wonder of the governor at the disap-
pearance of his bedding, which he has turned into a rope ladder, and
lie wonders with a grave chuckle, how his family circle, the mice
and spiders, will possibly get on without him. He gives us in fact, the
idea of a fast young Italian who has been shut up for a night or two in
some mcdifeval round-house, and who on getting free, considers the
matter as rather an exciting bit of life.
Indeed the case is somewhat stronger. This philosopher regards his
punishment as a positively beneficial process. Solitary confinement for
twenty years, and endured by the victim of a tyrant, sharpens the
enjoyment of fresh air, and the salutary privilege of exercise. It is a
temporary retirement which really invigorates the senses, and has but
the one inconvenience, that it forbids the luxury of a barber. In fact, ac-
cording to Mr. Falconer, there is something cryptical in the nature
of a man, and he can only develop properly by being thrust into the dark.
Now we think it will be conceded that this is rather a new view of
the case, and possibly one that might be submitted with some little
advantage to Parliament. When it next discusses the penal system, in
addition to all the usual objections that have been urged to solitary
punishment, here is the fresh one furnished by Mr. Falconer, that it
may even be considered an enjoyment. However, let us be just to him.
He intends the whole affair as a joke, and its chief originality consists,
not merely in its requiring two hours and a-half for utterance, but in its
taking the shape of a drama, which has actually deceived our contempo-
raries into the belief of its serious purpose.
THE NATIONAL SHAKSPEARE COMMITTEE.
In order to complete Me record of certain "proceedings" which
have come under the unfavourable notice of the General Committee, it
should be stated that a so-called Report was issued by the Secretaries
without the sanction of the Committee. That;in one of the paragraphs
of this report the following words were used :—
"In connection with this list of names, it is impossible not to express the pro-
found regret which every one must feel at the sudden removal from among us of a
man of genius, about whoso form of invitation there was a passing difference of
opinion. His claims to a place in the Committee had been expressed in a formAl
vote and in a special invitation. Of his sympathy, and of his co-operation, had he
been spared to us, no sort of doubt can be entertained."
The Vote of Censure, which we recorded last week, as having been
passed by the General Committee in reference to the "proceedings"
which excluded Mr. Thackeray from the list of Vice-Presidents, has
been followed up by another vote of the General Committee. The so-
called Report containing the above disingenuous passage has been.
Bejected.

NOTHING LIKE A MECHANICAL TURN (FOR HAIR-BRUSHING).

THE LONDON AND SUBURBAN IRON AND MUD

PROSPECTUS.
Tee great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of first-class Scrap
Iron for the manufacture of Armour Plates, Soup Kettles, Armstrong
Guns, Home Secretaries, and other Marine Stores, has directed the
attention of certain members of our Scientific bodies, to the possibility
of recovering the large amount of metal deposited by wear and tear of
tire* of wheels, horse-shoes, &c. in the Mud of the London streets, and
now allowed to he useless.
The fact of the existence of a large metallic deposit in London Mud
being established, experiments have been made to test the proportions
in which this deposit exists, and the localities in which it mostly
abounds.
PRINCIPAL VEINS HITHERTO DISCOVERED.
1. "The Wheal Oxford," running the whole length of Oxford Street
and Holborn from the Marble Arch to the Bank. Good.
2. "The Wheal Crawley" commencing on Cornhill, running west-
wards through the Houses of Parliament, and terminating at the Horse
Guards. This is an immensely deep vein of Mud.
3. "The Wheal Mary Ann, lodes of considerable richness of which
are found to exist on tne area-steps of houses in quiet streets, where a
plain cook is kept. The richness of this vein is supposed to be attri-
butable to the quality of the Iron used in the heels of the Policemen's
boots, and in the ammunition boots issued to Her Majesty's Foot
Guards, being exceedingly good.
Other veins of equal value are also noted for experiment, the only
failure yet recorded beingthat of the "Wheal Cresswell." samples of
which obtained from the Divorce Court, proved to be too full of dirt to
be of any practical use.
The Company has for its object the working of these and other veins;
and as the mud is regularly collected by the street scavengers, no
regular staff will be required by the Company. It is confidently ex-
pected that the most eminent iron-founders in the Metropolis will
contend for the privilege of smelting the ore thus obtained; so that no
expense to the Company on that score need be apprehended.
Under these circumstances the Company will be freed from the
necessity of raising any Capital, and the profit on its Shares must there-
fore be enormous: a state of things quite unique in the history of
public undertakings.
The Promoters being anxious to benefit the mass of mankind rather
than to add to the accumulated wealth of a few, no capitalists or other
wealthy persons need apply; but the Shares of the Company are offered
to poor Widows, Clergymen with large families and small means,
Elderly Maiden Ladies in reduced circumstances, and others in a like
position.
Allotments of Shares upon application by prepaid letter, enclosing
2*. 6d. in postage stamps will be made to all parties eligible.
An early application is recommended.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IT IS AN ANCIENT MARINER."
We quite agree with Mb.
Cobden, that one can always
learn something from the
worst newspaper. We do j
not mean to say that the |
Hampshire Chronicle is the!
worst, indeed it seems to be
■ very respectable journal.
But we have certainly learned
something from the number
winch lies before us. It refers
to the promotion of Sir
Lucius Curtis, Baronet, to
the high posit ion of Admiral
of the Fleet, and assuredly
if length of service can entitle
a man to honours, the awful
and terrible age of Sm Lucius
gives him claim to be Very
First Lord of the Admiralty,
or anything he pleases. Be
kind enough to observe the
statements made bytheZfawp-
shire Chtomcle. First, as to
the Admiral's father -.—
"Sir Lucius it tie eldest son
of a distinguished Admiral of the
Red, who rendwod great MrriOM
at the Siego of Gibraltar, and
received hi* baronetcy in 17!H for his conduct as Captain of tU»Gt«fn Cliariotte. Lord Howe's nag-ehip, in
the battlos of May 22nd and June 1, 1724."
Longevity, it seems, runs great lengths in the family, and it was just like old Tory Govern-
ments to let a brave sailor wait exactly seventy years for the reward of bis valour. We
may remark, too, that it does great credit to Lord Howe that he fought his battles exactly
a year before he was born. But these exploits are nothing to those of our new Admiral,
as described by the Hampshire Chronicle:—
"The present Baronot was born.in 1716, entered the Navy in 1715, and commanded the Magici&int at the
Isle of Bourbon. Ho became Captain Jan. 22, 1S06; Rear-Admiral, June 2S, 1838; Vice-Admiral, Sept 15,

1842; and Admiral, July 9, 1255. He succeeded his father
j in 1810, having in the previous yoar been appointed a C.B. **
! So that this extraordinary Ancient Mariner
I had the goodness in the first place to be born
before his father, and in the next place to enter
, the Navy a year before he himself was born, a
noble act of devotion to his country's service.
But even those achievements are as nothing
| compared to his rushing back in the most valiant
manner into ancient history, and becoming an
Admiral in the time of Hexry this Third, then
retiring for a few centuries into honourable
obscurity, and modestly coming out again as
Captain, soon after Loan Nelson's death, when
remarkable sailors were much wanted. Histories
like these make us indeed proud of our brave
Navy, and we liave every re—on to hope that
Si* Lucius Curtis may livo to oammaml the
Channel Fleet in the year l-<"*\.

MALICIOUS .INTERFERENCE.
Mr. Punch,
I ijke to travel in a first-class railway carriage, with comfortable
arms and cushions, to enjoy the society and the conversation of my
betters, and to grab the newspapers they leave behind them on getting
out. But I do not like to pay for these luxuries.
Having invented a way of obtaining them, on the Underground
Railway, at a small price, I have read in the Telegraph, with ineffable
disgust, a mean letter in which the writer endeavours to get me cheated
out of the reward of my invention. I consider the writer to be a very
dishonest man.
My plan is very simple, like all great plans. I was obliged, for once,
to incur the expense of a first-class ticket, but this, once obtained, will
answer for all time. Every day I travel, I buy a third-class ticket;
but as I go down-stairs to the platform, I put the third-class card into
my pocket, and take out my first-class one, which, of course, I carefullv
preserve. You have to show tickets to the official at the wicket. I
show my first-class card. Of course there is no time, or it does not
occur to liim, as I hurry past, to ascertain that it is an old one—he can
see that it f* a first-class, and that's enough. I take my seat in the
patrician carriage, and enjoy myself as aforesaid. I need not say that
as the tickets are taken away at the gate, I there give up my third-class
ticket, aud go my way with the smile of virtue leaning on the arm of
talent.
That a writer should seek to" take away this cleverly and honestly
esrned privilege is so monstrous that I cannot trust myself to say more
than that 1 am,
Yours very truly,
.DlHDLEDUM DOO.
A SKETCH IN SCOTLAND.
Since the immortal meeting of the Brick Lane Temperance Society,
at which the Messrs. Wcller and the Reverend the Shepherd attended
(after refection elsewhere), and the latter, in response to the Chair-
man's fat smile aud invitation to address the Meeting, declined, on
the ground that the meeting was drunk, we liave seen nothing so good
as this, which we takejrom the Dundee Courier:—
11 On Sunday last, the minister of a large Congregation in Dundee was interrupted
in the course of his forenoon sermon by the repeated coughing of his auditors.
Pausing in the midst of his observations, he addressed his Congregation to the fol-
lowing effect:—' You go about the streets at the New Year time—you got drunk,
and get cold, then you come here and cough, cough like a park of artillery. I think
1 must give you a vacation of six weeks, that you may have time to get sober, and
to regain your health again."
This lenitive application did good, for the Congregation sat quiet, and
coughed no more than they would have dared to do had they been in
presence of the Queen, or any other great person, instead of being in a
mere Church. But one seat-holder, though he held his seat, could not
hold his tongue, and declared that tne Congregation was insulted. We
suspect that the Minister knew best. Li fact had the incident occurred
anywhere but in Scotland, where every man is proverbially sober, we
should have been sure that the Minister knew best. Hurrah, for the
toddy of Bonnie Dundee!
Jesting out of Place.
As the Eari, of D-by was walking down St. James's Street with
Mr. B-n-j-n D-sr-li the other evening, the noble Lord remarked to
the right honourable gentleman that the days were getting out, when
his companion promptly replied, "I wish the Whigs were."

hair set thin atop? Because if so, I'd recommend you to say nothing
to nobody, but just go quietly to work, and take a leaf from the French
fashion-books. See here, this is how Madame la Mode now teaches
her fair votaries to make up for what by Nature may unluckily be
wanting to them in the matter of hirsuteness. The words I quote are
taken from the Illustrated News, ami refer to what is now the way of
wearing hair in Paris: but I believe the fashion is invading London
also, for we are never safe in England from] French fashionable
invasions:—
"The quantity of han-wom le considerable, whether natural or borrowed, and the
c-itojpm especially should be very thick. A goodly amount of hair 1b required to be
colffed a ta mode. If yon have not sufficient, purchase some, says Madame la
Mode. There is not even much advantage in possessing a fine head of hair; the
wearing of fauxehevcux is so generally admitted and permitted that ladies sufficiently
rich m the capillary ornament usually pass for having had recourse to the fashion-
able importation, which is not considered in the least derogatory to the wearer's
beauty or attraction*'
I barveir't the least tJonception 'What a "catogan" may be, though I
have heard of cattish whiskers, and perhaps they are related to it. Bat
1 soy, what a beastly shame it seems that a girl who's got good hair
should be suspected to hawe bought it. Hang it all, I think if I were
a young lady and had a lot of hair, I'd wear it dangling down my back
all loose to -show that it was real. As for any girl's imagining that
buying her back hair is "not considered in the least derogatory to her
attractions," that's a very neat idea for a pernupder to promulgate, but
I doubt if men in general would be willing to endorse it. I am not
myself much tempted towards committing matrimony by the knowledge
that girk'no'w.a-days are in the habit of wearing wigs. Indeed, I think
that she who tries to add to her capillary attractions by wearing on her
head a lot of other people's hair should, if she thereby wins a husband,
be deemed guilty of obtaining marriage under false pretences, and, if
not punished more severely, at least should have her head shaved, and
be shown at 'evening parties for a month without a wig.
Some old classic chap has said that Venus could not charm even her
Vulcan -were she bald, and I have certainly some doubt whether a
beauty -without lmir would have many offers made to her, But total
baldness is by no means common with young ladies, and I don't expect
to sec a Venus Calva here in England, although they stuck a statue to
her once in ancient; Borne. But alady with sparse hair would assuredly
be more attractive to my eyesight if she had the courage to wear it
unadulterated, than if she picked the locks which once adorned another
to decorate herself. First catch your hair by nature, Miss, and then
dress it as you please, provided you don't add to it what is not your
own. But if you try to , beautify yourself by wearing faux eheveux, I
hope that nobody will ever mistake you for a haircss.
As a gentleman, of course, I can't bear being rude—especially to
ladies. But if I were introduced to a partner in a ball-room, and bad
any thoughts of asking her to be my-'partner for life, I should take care
by some means, before I popped the question to pull down her back
hair that I might see if it were home-grown or of foreign importation.
If bachelors hi general were to act upon this plan,' just fancy what dis-
coveries might be made at evening parties, and what a sweeping up of
curls there would be the morning afterwards!
I don't know who the fellow was of whom it is recorded that—
M Beauty draws him with a single hair."
But I have not such'faith myself in mere capillar)- attractiveness, and I
don't think any lock of hair will ever draw me into wedlock. Still I am
"free to confess" (as I shall say when I'm in Parliament) that I think
a hirsute head looks better than a bald one, and, if I ever lose my own
so far as to get married, I shall account it so much gain if, as my own
hair's getting thin, my wife's should be so thick as to make up for my
deficiency. But then hersrmust be genuine, and in no way adulterated;
for I hate to see young ladies giving themselves hairs that by nature
don't belong to them, and a'girl who wears a wig shall never share my
wigwam.
With which determination I cry, Down with borrowed tresses! A bat
Us faux eheveux! and remain, my dear [Punch, yours in all serenity
(while single),
CHARLEY CfELEBS.
More Confusion.
This telegram is not "reliable: "—
"Washington telegrams report that the Confederates are retreating from the
neighbourhood of Petersburg.1'
We thought that it was the Federals who had thrown themselves
into the anus of Russia for protection and patronage. Have the Con-
federates been trying the same game, and been repulsed. Bother the
telegrams, they are more trouble to us than all our money.
A RATING FOR THE BANK RATERS.
Will the Directors of that Bank of England oblige us so far as to let
that Rate of Discount alone? They really fidget with it in a most
unbusiness-like way, and they can have no idea of the trouble they
cause. Up one day, down the next, and then up again, until one does
not know what to do. It is very trying to have to consider in the
morning, while dressing, whether one ought to send another collar to
the wash, or whether, on the chance of the rate of discount going up on
Saturday, one ought to turn .the collar one lias worn the day before.
We know a case m which a prudent young man has actually declined to
take a pocket handkerchief out of the drawer, and has gone about
•■iffling to that degree that the Bank Parlour ought to be ashamed. We
ourselves have been drinking La Hose for more than a week, instead of
Lafitte, soleb/ because we wished to set an example of foret hought to our
boys, and for the same reason, wlule the Rate of Discount has been
played with, we have never given more than tenpence for a cigar,
except when we have smoked fewer than nine in the tweutv-four hours.
Moreover, though the interference is avowedly against the export of
gold, it affects, in some subtle manner, the issue of silver and we had
four rounds with a buss conductor in the Edgeware Road cm Tuesday
night, because he gave us two-and-fourpence in coppers when we paid
him half-a-crovm on account of his lawful twopence, and if be took his
black eye into the Bank Parlour, the Directors would be astonished.
There is nothing more wicked tlian trifling with the national onrrency,
and we shall look into the Parlour ourselves, and Parlay, as Inspector
Bucicet says, in a way that will make the Directors look nine ways for
Sunday.
MR, MILTON MODERNISED.
What needs my Shakspeare for his,bonoured bones,
The sovereigns of Brown, Robinson, and Jones?
Or that his hallowed relics should be bid
Under a Hepworth-Dlxon pyramid?
Dear aon of memory—great heir of fame,
Why all these little names tacked to thu name?
Thou may'st feel wonder and astonishment
At all this row about thy monument,
While to the shame of our dramatic Art,
Thy plays of our stage-banquet make no part.
Metuinks 'twere well, blushing, to bring to book,
Praises so empty, though so big they look,
And, with our Stage ungraeed of thy conceiving,
Own ourselves arrant humbugs, sell-deceiving:
Meanwhile do thou in quiet Stratford lie,
Heedless of all this buzzing of small fry!

LAW OF DIVORCE.
Sir,—A "Barrister" who lately wrote to the Times, in order to
draw public attention to the existing anomalies in the Law of Divorce,
omitted all mention of one of its most glaring absurdities. Allow me
to state a case in point. Mr. A. runs away with Mrs. B„ very good,
I mean of course very bad; well, Mrs. A. sues lor a Divorce from
Mr. A., and obtains an order for alimony pendente lite. Mr. A. objects
to pay this amount for the support of ins wife, whereupon t he Judge
"orders an attachment to issue." Now, Sir, if it be, as it certainly is,
in the power of the Judge Ordinary to order Mr. A.'s attachment to
Issue, why should he not be able judicially to order Mr. A.'s attachment
to Wife? I remain, Sir, yours thoughtfully,
A Revising Barrister.

THE JUVENILE PARTY.-A GREAT LIBERTY.
Juvenile. "Mamma, bear! Do Ton mow that Gentleman tickled me without beisjo introduced!'
NOT A BAD IDEA OF KING "WILLIAM.
Says the King to the Kaiser,
I think 'twould be wiser,
Since soldiers are stronger than sermons,
To leave off entreating,
And take to brow-beating
Our large batch of small (cousin) Germans.
With the bit in their muzzle.
O'er this vexed Duchy-puzzle,
So long and so loudly they've wrangled,
That Europe feels gravelled,
How a skein so sore ravelled
Is e'er to be got disentangled.
Diplomacy fumbled,
Till through it has tumbled,
And the knot all its pains keeps defying:
So at last to save labour,
They've snatched up the sabre
To cut it, instead of untying.
Now though swords, my dear Kaiser,
S>rawu with sense for adviser)
ay lead to short-cuts out of trouble,
Still a blade in its swing
Is a dangerous thing,
And its edges are apt to cut double.
So, as you, Coz, and I,
Must have hands in the pie,
And the pear of delay gets no riper.
Leave small Germans the word-play,
And We '11 take the sword-play,
As 'tis We must, at last, pay the piper.
Our schlagert we '11 flourish,
And Vaterland nourish
With the froth and the wind she delights in;
But we 'U take deue'd good care,
Though the sword may be bare,
Its polisn shan't suffer true fights in.
If BlSMARCK-ScHONHAUSEN,
My Prussia can cozen.
Surely, we, King and Kaiser together,
All Deutschland can gammon,
Its will clap a dam on,
And conjure this storm to fair weather.
REALLY NECESSARY LINES. -
The following are amongst the Railway schemes for which application
might as well be made by various Companies to obtain the sanction of
Parliament:—
The General Exhibition Railway, from Madame Tussaud's to the
Tower, with branches to St. Paul's, Westminster Abbey, the Houses
of Parliament, the other principal public buildings, the theatres, aud all
places of public amusement.
A Railway from Wine Office Court, Fleet Street, to the Temple, and
the different Inns of Court, to be called the Cheshire Cheese Railway.
A line from Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, to Hatton Garden.
A line extending from the Royal Exchange, Cornhill, to the Bank.
The Monument and London Bridge Junction Railway.
A line connecting London Stone with Aldgate Pump.
A New Game.—The pleasantest game of forfeits is that at present
played at the Adelphi theatre, where Miss Bateman "cries" to you,
ana you forfeit all claim to intelligence if you don't "guess" that she
is the finest artist that ever came from America.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BALLOONING EXTRAORDINARY.
A Letter from Messhs. Coxwell and Gijjbw!&'& aeronautical Dog.
Dear Toby,
Bow'ow are you? Bow Vow d'ye do ? "When this letter comes
to paw, you'll rather wonder what I've got to bark about, eh? I'm
going to astonish you, rather. I've got such a tale! Ah! 'twill make
your hair stand on end "like squills upon the fretful Proserpine," as
the Poet says. I know all about William, Shaksfeare. Didn't he
immortalise our race? P'raps you. with something of the wag about
you still, (tho' it wouldn't be still" if something of the wag—eh?
Bow, wow, wow !) will ask me how on earth I came to know anything
about Proserpine? Not on earth, Toby, my boy; but on a certain well-
intentioned pavement where our old friend Cerberus has his kennel.
Oh! don't I wish I had three heads! and three mouths! wouldn't I
iust eat! None of your nigger minstrel amusements of playing with
bones for me. To my subject.
Do you remember how when we were puppies together, we heard
our juvenile friends being instructed in "Twinkle,'.twinkle, little star,
how I wonder What you are," and so on? At this point, you, if your
politeness as well as your patience is exhausted, and a particle of your
djog-latinity still remains to you, will say, "Why do you mention all
this? Cur, why?" Because, Sir, I have been up to see the Star that
twinkles, no longer wonderful to me. It has been my lot to emulate
the acrobatic Cow, who, as runs the ancient legend, o'ertopped the
silvery Moon, and instead of wasting my time in the idiotic proceeding
of inanely 'laughing to see such sport" (what sport? pooh! 1 growl
at the notion!) I have been far, far away, to those regions ever so high
above the cobwebbed clouds, where we part to meet no more, or some-
thing of that sort, and we may be happy yet. Do I carry you with me?
It may be not: at all events, They did. "Who?" say you. Why
Coxwell and Glaisheb, the aeronauts. Do you read your Times regu-
larly? Very well, then, if you did you must have noticed that Mr. James
Glaisheb, m writing about his seventeenth Balloon Ascent, says:—
** We took a Bog and threo rabbits, to note their behaviour when above tho
Clouds, and tho effects of low temperature and sudden chouses upon them."
I was the Dog. But oh, those rabbits.' Mb. Glaisheb would soon
hare seen the effects of a sudden change upon them, if he'd only let me
get at 'em, as I wanted to do from the first moment of starting. A pair
of dullards; why will you believe it, the dolts both fell fast asleep: oh,
shouldn't I like to have beentlown upon them; but Coxwell wouldn't
let mei nor Glaisheb either. I know now that their conduct arose
entirely out of envy, jealousy, hatred, malice, and all uncbaritahleness,
because they ate those rabbits themselves, with onion-sauce in the
evening, and I didn't even come in for my share of the bones.
Babbits are game now, as you are aware, and when the Balloon
reached 13,000 feet above the earth, they must haye been, as Coxwell
observed, pretty high game.
At 2h. 45m. by Glaisheb's watch, I growled.
At 2h. 46m., oy the same, Coxwell kicked me.
At 3h. 31m. I tried to bite Glaisheb's calf, but couldn't comfortably.
At 3h. 36m. I thought I saw the moon, and howled.
At 3h. 37m. "Kick him!" says Coxwell, kindly. Glaisheb's a
bold man, but he is also a wise one, and he refrained. "No," says
he, "Let dogs delight to bark and bite, And scratch and tear and
Howl, Let bears and lions dance and fight—" "But don't let that dog
growl," says Coxwell, finishing the verse offhand.
At 4h. 9m. it was so dark that I couldn't see the rabbits. I scented
tbem though, the two little plump bunnies.
We were getting unpleasantly near the sea. "Aha!" says Coxwell,
who can condescend to a jest when he's not too lofty; "we've got the
two Rabbits and a little fresh Hare." I started up at this, and whined,
for L expected another animal to be added to our small collec-
tion. A Hare! thought I to myself, and I looked upon a good chivey
after the sly puss all round the car as a matter of course. In order to
suggest this to my masters, I whined again. "Kick that dog!" says
Coxwell. But Glaisheb pretended he couldn't sec me, and didn't
lift, his heel against mc. Then suddenly the full meaning of the joke
blazed upon mc. "Fresh H'air!" Oh, Coxwell, says I to myself,
who ought to be kicked now?
We lauded at a Warren. I don't mean the Master in Lunacy, with
whom you are, doubtless,' acquainted, but an open place where the
rabbits do mostly congregate. Messbs. Coxwell and Glaisheb were
hospitably entertained by Mb. Phitp, and my personal thanks are due
to his cook, who showed me every possible attention; though I regret
to state that the kitchen cat somewhat disturbed the harmony of the
evening. Glaisiier wants me to go with him to see the Dog Star. I
won't go if that Coxwell's to be of the party. What do you think
were the last words he uttered on that memorable evening?
"Good night," says Glaisher, taking his chamber candle.
"Good night," says Coxwell, yawning.
Por the life of me I couldn't help yawning too; something between a
yelp and a howl, call it a yowl.
'Kick that dog!" says Coxwell, going into his room. He didn't
dare do it himself. Glaisheb and myself were left alone in the passage.
I looked at Glaisheb, and he at me. I observed Glaisheb's toe moving
dubiously upwards. I growled. The next thing I saw was Glaisheb's
heels as he disappeared within his own bed-chamber. Adieu, dear
Toby.
I remain, yours truly,
The Ski Terrier.
ADVICE TO FEDERAL AMERICA
Ydo've now got a navy of iron,
And to man it your lankee lads,
But you haven't yet taken Charleston
With your navy of iron-clads.
'Tis defied by Secessia's power;
And your bluster we take at out case:
The Eagle won't frighten the Lion
Whilst a Semmes can sweep your seas.
You Yankees, whose sires left our fathers,
Your brothers forsake you to-day,
Your menacing overgrown Union
In vapour is passing away;
Let those that shall rise from its ashes,
More wise than itself was before,
Shake liands with the miscalled old tyrant,
And trade with John Bull at his door—
And where in the wide world's the nation
That you '11 harm with your Iron Ducks?
You can scaree hold your own seas and harbours
With your Irontides and Keokuk*.
Don't talk of your navy of iron,
But fling your brag to the breeie;
Give car to the counsels of Europe:
And Commerce restore on the i
THE FIRE. AGAIN.
Another victim- has been sacrificed to the grinning Moloch. Another
young girl has been burned to death to make an evening's show.
Maria Charles, a dancer at the Pavilion Theatre, is the sacrifice.
Her dress caught fire from some unprotected gas-lights used in the
Pantomime, and she has since expired. A puff paragraph, in which it
was stated that the means of extinguishing ure on such an occasion were
ready at hand, has been contradicted by the poor child's sister. We
shall of course read more puff paragraphs about the sorrow of the
management, and how nothing could exceed the kindness of its mquiries,
and the like. But why are not the lights protected, or if that cannot
be, why is it not made impossible for a girl, in her eagerness to
help a theatrical picture (and knowing what sort of gentle rebuke
will reward her for being out of place) from approaching the
flaring gas? A stage-manager will of course say that this is impos-
sible. So said the factory people, when they were asked to screen
their machinery, and prevent children from being torn to pieces;
but the factory people found it easy enough when the alternative was a
heavy fine, and the evidence was to be given by no sycophantish servant
of the establishment, but by a Government inspector. Something of the
same kind, enacted in reference to the theatre, would prevent these
oft-recurring burnt sacrifices: and English mothers in the boxes, with
their laughing children, would be spared the thought that when the
scene is the most brilliant, the chance is greatest that a shriek will
announce that some one else's child is in the agony of burning. If some
remedial measures are taken, poor Maria Charles will not have
died entirely in vain. We may say, with almost literal justification,
Peace to her ashes.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
The Viscount Dundreary, G.C.B. (Grand Card for Bucxstoke)
is entertaining a large circle of the nobility and other distinguished
persons at his seat—and in their seats—in the Market of Hay. Several
battues have taken place, and the noble Viscount has been very fortu-
nate with liis piece, and has frequently brought down the whole house.
Theatricals are also provided for the amusement of the guests, and the
favourite play, Our American Cousin, is being nightly performed to the
immense delight of the brilliant assemblage. We believe that an addition
to the party will soon be made in the person of the noble Viscount's
brother, the Hon. Samuel Dundreary, who has been for some time
on his travels, of which we understand his account is much coveted by
the Row—all the rows in fact. We venture to predict that it will be a
thing which every fellah will be able to .understand.—Fund's Court

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NOTICES FOR THE COMING SESSION.

etrofolitan Members of the Imperial Parliament
have already given the following Notices of
Motion, and Mr. Punch cordially hopes that every
one of the subjects will be not merely pressed,
but rammed right home into the waistcoat of
the Minister concerned, or unconcerned:—
To call attention to the disgraceful manner in which London has been
blockaded for months and months by the emissaries of Mr. Thwaites,
to the injury of trade} the hindrance of traffic, and the great expendi-
ture of bad language by the drivers of and riders in vehicles, and to
move that Mr. Thwaites be ordered to keep the said emissaries at
work night and day until his sewers shall be finished.
To move that the law-officers of the Crown be required to prosecute
the owners of Vans, and the ruffians who drive the same over every-
body and everything, a state of things more worthy of the votaries of
Juggernaut than of a civilised metropolis.
To call attention to the insufficient provision made for the houseless
poor, especially children, and to invite the House to a resolution that
the parishes which have disgraced themselves by turning away unfor-
tunate persons, during the winter months, be disfranchised, until ample
accommodation shall have been provided.
To move for leave to bring in a Bill enacting that the grinding
an Organ in ant street where the houses are rated at more
than £10 is a felony, and punishable as such; this enact-
ment being intended to leave the humbler classes in
possession op their music, while those who can procure
better shall not be tortured by the abominable nuisance at
present prevalent.
To move that no Sermon in any Church, Chapel, or other similar
edifice shall last more than twenty minutes, and that any Minister
offending against this rule shall be severely rebuked by the Ordinary,
and compelled to dine at an ordinary, or slap-bang, until he shall have
done penance in a sheet of Jeremy Taylor.
To move that any Pew-Opener, Box-keeper, Stall-keeper, Cloak-
keeper, or other servant who takes a fee for doing a duty that should
be performed withont one, shall be liable to the penalties of the law
against obtaining money under false pretences.
To call the attention of the House to the fact that the system of
cheating the poor by means of false weights and measures is largely on
the increase; that though the Magistrates are incessantly fining batches
of rascals who rob in this way, they boast that such fines are made up
by another week of similar cheating; and that exposure, unless it were
in the pillory, has no terror for these mean thieves.
To call the attention of the House to the invasion of London menaced
by the Railway schemers, and to move to refer the whole question to a
paid and permanent Committee out of the House, composed of architects
m whom the public has confidence, and who shall be chosen by the
votes of the occupiers of respectable houses.
To call the attention of the House to the National Shakspeare
Committee, and to move a resolution that the same, while it survives,
be placed under the surveillance of the medical officers who attend the
Asylum for Idiots and that at HanwelLj
POLITICAL PLUCK.
A Great Mill has been a standing symbol of passive prowess ever
since Don Quixote first made his appearance on those boards. It is
only recently, however, that a great Mill—such for instance as that
between South Mims and Wooton Bassett—has engrossed any large I
amount of public attention; until the wind set in from a certain influen- |
tial quarter, nobody worth notice had any conception of the fancy which
paints a Mill all eouleur de rose. Our present intention is not to tilt at
the Mill, but simply to point out one conspicuous cause which may partly
account for its sudden elevation.
Undoubtedly so long as Britons never—never will be slaves, there
will always be a market for muscles. The transactions, however, in
that market will to some extent depend upon competition in other
markets. If pleasure-seekers rush eagerly to see the Miller and his
Men, represented by barn-storming strollers, it is because the company
at the Theatre Royal St. Stephens are so addicted to gag, that they have
made a perfect farce of the once popular play, the School of Bfform. We
want political pluck as an antidote to Kinglike pugnacity. Let our
parliamentary Athletes instead of spending so much time in tossing for
choice of corners, and in tying then: colours to the stakes, set to work
in earnest. Jack Russell, though he hasn't much left of the chicken
about him, requires no training to improve his condition, and will
not want supporters if he shows as much bottom now, as he did
in the famous year when he knocked Old Sarum out of time. Since
then he has had ample opportunity for adding to his science and
improving his delivery. Pam again is still a judicious bottle-holder, and
will cheerfully lend a leg, we are assured, to any young man from the
country who, in sporting lingo, means business. As for Bright, the
Birmingham Slasher, though ne has metal in him, we fear from recent
ebullitions of temper, that ne can't take punishment, and as, like Cobby,
he excels chiefly m fibbing, those who admire the noble art of national
self-defence have very little expectation of seeing him the champion of
England. We sincerely regret that they are not equally distrustful
with reference to America.
Dick Logic alias Cobby has, we freely admit, done some clever
bruising on the Corn Exchange. His present Lancashire up and down
style of fighting, however, and his vicious practice of gouging his oppo-
nent, are not at all creditable to the sphere in which he lives and
moves. The only sphere, in fact, to which such tactics are suited is the
Dog Star (his natal planet, as we learn from Zadkiel) by whose influ-
ence his reputation as an ugly customer is mainly kept alive.
There is some talk among the flunkeys at the Carlton of Ben the
Darky, whose career has been a chequered one (he was matched not
many years ago against Gladstone, the flowery Chancellor, and for-
feited) coming forward again as a candidate for the belt. Ben, it will
be remembered, is an ex-waiter at the Queen's Head. Though not
remarkable for science, he has lately won golden opinions oy his
civility and good conduct. The Darky's friends are very anxious to
get up a benefit for Derby's pet Pug, which (if it ever should come off)
will no doubt be of service to him and them too, considering how long
they have all been out of place.
The New Gun.—The " Infant Prince," the six-pounder.
TOASTS BUTTERED A L'IRLANDAISE.
{To be handed round at all Irish Convivial Meetings.)
May the wing of Friendship ne'er want a friend, or a bottle to give
him!
May our endeavours to please always bear the morning's reflection!
Let us persistently keep our eyes shut, but our mouths open!
May we ne'er be at a loss for a bottle, or a head, to crack! _
Here's to a cloudy wind and southerly sky, and all absent friends,
who do good by stealth, and do not blush to speak of a man as they find
him, and, not forgetting the brave pilot who has weathered the storm,
nor the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft, may the present moment,
Gentlemen, be the worst of our lives!
"As He has Made His Bed."
"Uneasy lies "—so Shakspeare wrote,
"The head that wears a crown;"
But more than average mal-aise
Makes Prussia's monarch frown,
Who finds his bed stuffed full of thorns,
In shape of Eider down.
"OFF, STANLEY, OFF!
We have the utmost admiration for Dean Stanley. But sometimes
he goes a little too far. He stated in a recent lecture that "the world
could not now show a Solomon." The Dean's library must be
getting out of order—shall we send up a young man to complete Dr.
Stanley's set of Punch?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MATTER OF FACT VERDICT.

a somewhat extra-
ordinary verdict was re-
ported in a newspaper
Saragraph, as having been
ehvered by a coroner's
jury, touching the cause of
death in a case wherein a
boy accidentally hanged
himself till he was dead, in
consequence of having been
induced, by some stories
which he had heard, to try
how long he could hang
without choking:—
"Til* deceased on bearing
these stories, laughed at the
irt-M ef the> bey not being able
to release himself from the rope,
an. I he no dejobs then mentally
BBaolvod that ha would try the
experiment himself. He did so,
sod was hanged. The jury took
and re-
fly."
RAILWAY AGGRESSION ON LONDON.
Castle, is it? J Then—
what, warders, ho 1
He certainly was hanged,
and the jury were doubtless
right in taxing this view of
the case. Only this view of
the case was one which it
was Mpoastble for anybody
not to take. It did not require a coroner's jury, come from behind
t heir counters, to tell us that. The wording of the above verdict might
naturally be imputed to its reporter; but really coroner's juries are apt
to make such fools of themselves, that we cannot be sure that this
one did not really return the very simple verdict above recorded.
Should they ever sit upon the body of a person whose throat has
been cut, perhaps they will content themselves with taking this view of
the case. ,
THE UNIVERSITY OF BEER,
How not to do it is what we are so accustomed to instances of, that
whenever we meet with an example of how to do it, we rejoice in calling
attention to that extreme rarity. It is, then, with the greatest pleasure
that we present the public in general, and the United Kingdom Alliance
in particular, with the edifying item of current information which
follows:—
"The Barclay and Perkins of Vienna, Herr Dreter, died suddenly a few days
ago. He was the beet producer of Vienna beer, and died worth from 6,000,00011. to
8,000,000 9. (£800,000). His heir is Us only son, a boy of fourteen. The boy. after
finishing school, is to go fur three years to England to Barclay and Perkins's
establishment, work there till the age of twenty-one, and then assume the pa-
trimony."
The cause of both sobriety and exhilaration is promoted by whatever
tends to the production of good liquor. Most of that drunkenness,
with whose steady and spontaneous decline officious agitators are trying
to interfere by what they call a "Permissive Law," arises from indul-
gence in a quantity of liquor, which, if it were good, would enliven and
not stupefy, and would not exceed the measure of Temperance. A very
little bad beer is sufficient to cause drunkenness and incapability.
Brewing is a scientific art, and attainment of a high standard of malt
liquor can only be based on a sound and special education. The esta-
blishment of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins may be regarded as a sort
of College, to which the guardians of the youthful heir of Herr Dreyer
have done well and wisely to send that young gentleman for the com-
Jletion of his studies. Together with the other large brewing-firms of
iondon it constitutes a University of Beer, in which the successor to
the house of Drbyer will doubtless take high honours, besides the little
go and great go to be encountered in the distillery line. It may be that
he will also pass through a short course of reading at Reids: and if
also at Metjx's, tant mieus, with a view to the degree of double stout.
We wish every British Brewer who wishes his son to succeed him,
would send the young man to finish his education at the University of
Beer.
Every Englishman's house is his
"Up drawbridge, grooms;
Let the portcullis fall."
Or, what should come to the same thing, "Mary, bar the door, and
John go up-stairs with the blunderbuss, ready to fire out of window on
the emissaries of the Railway Company, if they attempt to break into
the premises." What, if we shoot a set of caitiffs in defence of our own
castle, shall we be liable to be hanged? Go to.
There may have been a time when the house of every Englishman
was so secured by tbe law of England against all invasion as to be a
building really equivalent to and deserving the name of a fortress;
though there is reason to doubt whether the old saying which ..'so calls
it, was not somewhat of the nature of one of those remarks made by
Coke upon Littleton, and meant to be jocose. Now, at any rate,
when a society of speculative adventurers, pursuing self-aggrandisement
under the pretence of the public advantage, has acquired the right to
buy our lands and tenements up on its own terms, and pay us at its
own time, in the mean time turning us out unceremoniously neck and
crop, to say that every Englishman's house is his castle, is to utter a
most bitter and cutting sarcasm at the expense of every man in England,
and particularly of every one who has fallen a victim to the legalised
burglary of the Railway Companies.
Are there no means of averting the imminent destruction of the] little
beauty which our capital possesses, and the injury, both in comfort and
in business, with which its inhabitants are threatened by the various
gangs that, under the name of Railway Companies, are about to apply
to Parliament for that jprivate legislation wliich will constitute them
legalised housebreake
There is a'very obvious
More Shakspearianity.
(Fivmtht "Athenawn.")
We ai^ 1 ippy to state that the following gentlemen have given then-
consent to have their names added to the National Shakspeare Com-
mittee :—Professor Holloway, Messrs. Moses and Son, Mr. Miles
(sixteen shilling trousers), Mr. Close, the Poet, Captain Atcherlky,
Rev. Dr. Ccmming, Mr. Cox. M.P., the Viscount Williams, Mr.
Jacky Sanders, and the Beadle of the Burlington Arcade.
the only
wonder is tfiat it has been neglected. Why do not all the householders
! in every district of London or the suburbs now in danger of devastation
or disturbance by a projected Railway, at once get up a petition and
present it to the Houses both of Lords and Commons against the
proposed scheme? Let them lose no time in taking at least that
precaution for the protection of their property, and the preservation of
the quiet and repose of their neighbourhood. Of course they will be
argued to be willing subjects of the outrage with which they are
menaced, if they don t cry out. 5-
Fancy a railroad cut through Kensington Gardens! We have fancied
it as the utmost conceivable atrocity of sordid Vandalism. But the
abomination is actually contemplated. The horse-ride which the eques-
trian orders wanted to establish there would be preferable to such an
eyesore, and earsore too, as the Iron Road among the flowers, and the
engine^cream and whistle mingling with the song of the thrushes and
blackbirds—if it didn't drive them away. Such a desecration is impos-
sible, we are told. Not at all. Parliament is likely enough to pernut.it.
Then the wretches who meditate it would certainly perpetrate it. As
, for them, they would not hesitate to make a railway in the Gardi'ii
of Eden.'.•
"It was all very well to run a line through the broad lands of a bloated
aristocrat, and break the deep silence of his ancestral hall by sending a
train rattling every half-hour under the eaves of the mansion in nis
park, afflicting his ears, affronting his pride, molesting his deer, and
scaring the birds from his rookery. But when the levelling agency of
the dumpy level is brought to bear on the homes and shops and ware-
houses of the middle classes, we then feel that Railway aggression is an
insufferable nuisance.
Petition, therefore, petition, petition, petition! And be quick about
it, unless you want your business broken up, your abodes demolished,
your hearths profaned, and all your household gods shivered round you
by the confederate money-grubbers who are now exerting all then-
energies to obtain permission to inflict these injuries on you by Act of
Parliament. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"BABY'S NAME."
The Honourable Mr. Button, M.P., in a speech at Portsmouth, the
other day, made a pretty allusion to the New Baby, but said that "he
could not name him, because he had appeared so suddenly that his
name was not yet ready for him." Mr. M. F. Tuppbb, who has been
loyally prompt with his tribute upon the occasion, has thoughtfully pro-
vided for this want. The Laureate of Albury, ui his new poem, calls
the Princess op Wales :— ,
"Thetis of our Northern Water."
With poetic reticence, he does not precisely propose a name for the
Hope of England, but if our—Lempriere—serves us rightly, the son
of Thetis was called Achilles. There's a splendid name! Prince
Achilles op England. And it would be a delicate compliment to the
Princess's brother, George op Greece. In favour of this name,
Mr. Punch withdraws his own claim to name the infant, as he did with
even greater promptness than Mr. TuprER.

A LADY ON SCHLE8WIG-H0LSTEIN.
Dear Mr, Punch. Tuesday.
Or course, like everybody else, loving and admiring our darling
Princess or Wales, I felt shocked and hurt at the wicked attempt to
take away her father's duchies. I do not pretend to understand the
question, not being'a strong-minded woman, but I should not like any
body to come and deprive me of a large piece of my garden, though a
horrible railway threatens to do so, and my husband, who has no more
feeling for flowers than a blind man, is quite delighted at the idea of
compensation, as if a few hundred pounds could compensate me for the
taking away my beautiful little beds which I have laid out so carefully,
and watered so regularly that I have caught at least twenty colds, one
on the top of another. But men are so inconsistent.
But I was going to say that I read in the Times that the Duke with
the long name, Augustus like, is one of the most splendidly handsome
men in the world, tremendously tall, with a most princelike air, and a
little sadness, poor dear fellow, arising from his early misfortunes, at
which the Emperor (whom you may call handsome if you like, but I
won't and shan't) made such unfeeling fun in that letter which you had
no business to print. Now you must see that it is impossible, for a
woman at all events, to feel animosity against a noble-looking creature
like that.
What I want you to do is, to use your influence to arrange things
pleasantly. I do not know whether this magnificent Prince, whom it is
a shame to call Pretender (and you might sav Chevalier at least), is
married or not. Perhaps it could be arranged for his wife, if he has one,
to retire in some way, on a morganatic pension, don't they call it ?—you
know. Then he might marry some Princess of Denmark, and rule over
the Duchies as dear Lord Carlisle does over Ireland. I am sure-this
is practical, though you men never allow that women can suggest any-
thing. Because it is not to be endured that Lord Russell (whom I
dare sav you will call a beauty, it would be just like you) should be
allowed to persecute that beautiful Duke. Please give your mind to the
subject, and oblige,
Your sincere admirer,
Gloucester Crescent. Rosa Matilda Spoons.
THE NATIONAL SHAKSPEARE COMMITTEE.
De morluis nil nisi Verum. The National Shakspeare Committee,
if not actually dead, is in ariicvlo, and the article is in the last Athen/eum,
the organ of the dominant executive. The Memorial absurdity is at an
end, or, as its originators say " may be left to time." This result was.
a certainty, after the statement which the seceding members of the
Committee submitted to the public, after the Times had delivered a
crushing condemnation of the scheme, and presented a pleasant physio-
logical sketch of "animalcules," and after the Daily News Telegraph,
and other journals had expressed cither pity or contempt for the con-
dition of the Committee. The leading journal of Scotland observes:—
"The London Committee bus split up; all its best members having seceded from
it; and the rump is far too weak to wriggle itself into public favour oven to the
amount of £30,000."
But it is well to die decently, and not with untruths in one's mouth.
The Athenteum cannot disband its men without falsely charging the
seceders with having retired because a plan of their own was not
adopted, such plan having in fact been merely a suggestion of 1hrec out
of the retiring Dody, and having been formally declared by them to be
only a suggestion, to be considered at a future time. And the Athentrum
offers a long list of names which it pretends are those of the executive,
the fact being that they arc names of distinguished persons, scarcely
one of whom has ever taken the slightest part in the proceedings, or set
his foot in the committee room. That, it will be seen, can by no possi-
bility be a description of the executive that has ruined the scheme. It
is enough to record these two mis-statements, and to wish the moribund
clique a better frame of mind.

THE SHAKSPEARE INCAPABLES.
We don't particularly care to kick a man when he is down, or a committee
either: and as the "Shakspeare National Committee" is down to zero nearly
in the national estimation, we have no great willingness to lift a pen against it.
Else we might remind its members that the utter want of confidence wherewith
their acts are now regarded is an entirely natural consequence of their prepos-
terous misdeeds. A committee that commences with chqueism and cabals, and
then proceeds to speechify and squabble about "forms of invitation," instead of
properly attending to the work that is required of it, can never gain the con-
fidence of people, nor their cheques.
The Committee talk of raising the pleasant little sum of thirty thousand pounds,
to build some sort of monument, they have no notion what. We may wish that
they may get it, but we rather think they won't, unless indeed they fork it out of
their own pockets. Siiakspeare needs no statue, all the world will say: and even
if he did, the Shakspeare National Committee are not fit to be trusted with the
business of erecting it. So if the Committee still persist in their delusion'that a
monument is wanted, the chances are, we think, that they themselves unhelped
will have to find the money for it.
Tliis being so, they will no doubt feel 'grateful for a hint as to a way by which
their resources might be aided: and since there is some talk of having Shaks-
peare performances" for the benefit of the Fund, we would in all humility suggest
to the Committee that they might get a little money by going about the country,
and appearing in the parts which they have lately been assuming. The Farce of
a Committee Meeting, if presented in the manner they have recently been acting
it, would be a splendid comic novelty, and, if its squabbles and absurdities were
acted to the life, it would be certain to amuse. A sort of Shadow Pantomime might
also be performed, to show the shadowy conceptions entertained by the Committee
of their duty to the nation, whose name they have assumed without asking for
permission, so far as we can learn. Were a Pantomime produced, we think that
one of the old women who sit on the Committee might be readily selected
to take the part of Columbine: and there need surely be small labour in
looking for a Clown, when so many of the Committee have been known to play
the fool.

A Telegram from Yankee Land has doubtless gratified
the Anti-Slavery Society with the information that:—
"Four negroes called at the Executive mansion on New Year's
day, and were presented to Mr. Lincoln. This Is the first occur-
rence of the kind in American history."
But when these negroes were presented to Abraham
he probably said to the gentleman at whose hands lie
received them:—" Thank you for nothing. What am I to
do with these Africans? I reckon I had already more on
my hands than I knew how to dispose of. So, if you want
really to obligate me, take back your gift."

A Madame de Paula, who keeps some kind of a

know nothing of the merits of the case, but would respect-
fully hint that the complainant has not indicated exactly
the correspondents .whose letters invariably tend to con-
vince those hard-natured creatures called Editors. We
prefer to be addressed by masculine laymen, because we
can kick them, morally, if they offend us, and because
they do not want an unlimited supply of Italics and
Small Capitals. -

DOMESTIC DEMONS.
The partial revival of
stition which lias oc-
curred in this latter
half of the nineteenth
century may surest
to minds not constitu-1
tionaUy incredulous
the question whether,
after all, there was not
some foundation for
the belief which our
ancestors entertained
in witchcraft. There
are said to be " strange
things among us" in
t ic form of talking
bles, and "spiritual
manifestations." Spi-
ritualism and nccro-
mancy are convertible
t erms. I f necromancy
is possible may not
sorcery be? This sort
of reasoning may end
i in attempts at coujura-
. tiou on the part of
some people who arc
no conjurors. They
will go chalking circles
and cabalistic . figures
on the floor, and en-
deavouring to repeat
the celebrated exploit
of Da. Faustis; and all this without getting themselves sent to Bedlam, unless they should
happen, for example, to murder a baby in order to use some of it in their incantations.
Nobody possessing a rational soul can be conceived capable of making that disposal of it
which tradition ascribes to Dr. Favjstus. But if any earthly inducement could prevail on any |
one to cuter into that transaction, it is one which is peculiarly prevalent in the present time.
If the horns and tail and cloven hoof could bo exchanged for the mediaeval chauuure, slashed
doublet, cap, and cock's tail feather, so they might for the powdered head, the laced coat,
the plush, the calves, and the pumps. The Ancient Nicholas could as easily take the
form of the modern Jeames as that of Mephii-
lopheles. His subordinate demons—who, we
know from Mil. Milton, "can either sex
ild find no difficulty in turning
themselves into servant-maids, and thus the
greatest plague in this life would be avoided bv
those wdUng, if able, to " jump the life to come.
Consider the comfort of being waited upon bv
servants up to their work, and content with
their wages, capable of executing all your com-
mand*, and even anticipating your wishes, whilst
they would have no followers such as^wxmld

Oh! if it were possible to be waited on by such

The dickins take them foreigners! they're always kicking up

A quarrelin' among theirselves, or else along with one another,
First French, Hungarians next, then Poles, and sitch, no rest, nor
peace, nor quiet,
And now all this here trouble's caused by that there nasty German
Diet.
Diet! I'd diet 'cm, indeed, for niakin' all this useless clatter,
And physic 'em besides I would, by Job, the rebbles! for that matter,
A goin' for no bit o' good to stir up gineral war and slaughter,
Their victuals should be all dry bread by rights, aud all their drink
ditch-water.
Yah! German Diet, sad sour krout and sausidges which there's no
good in.
Give me old Luglish fare, I say, roast beef, baked taters, and plum-
puddin'.
Diet ! m course it disagrees, and that perduces indigestion;
And so it is as I explains this plaguy Sclileswig-Holstein question.
Them Horstrians and Prooshans too, with them I han't got common
patience,
A givin' into the to do of them there petty smaller nations,
Ah there! they'll find out their mistake in havin' made theirselves sitch
ninnies,
"With Bonvpart about their house, and them there Kosscths and
Mazzinis.
I shouldn't mind if we was sure o' keeping clear of all their hobbles,
But when war comes as sure as fate the price of tea and sugar
doubles,
And there's more Income-Tax to pay by all that fills a decent
station,
The tag-rag gettin' off Scotch free, and that I calls confistication.
And so as to that Yankee war, although for my part I despises
Both sides alike, but then the price of calico and cotton rises,
Each other they might shoot and stab, for all I care, with guns and
sabres,
But when they consequence comes home we feels the quarrels of our
neighbours.
"FAC1LIS DESCENSUS AVERNI."
A Correspdndent of the Times, under the signature of " A Cornish
Miner," makes a statement whence it appears that, in the Parish of
Beer Ferris, Devon, within a circuit of half a-mile, there are, within
two feet of a pathway, some four-and-twenty unfeuced mining shafts or
holes in the ground, from 100 feet to 200 feet deep, and that, during the
last few years, several people have killed themselves by walking into
them unawares. If Beer Ferris, is worthy of its name, being a beery
district, the zigzag course which would be very generally pursued by
its inhabitants in walking home at night on a pathway sueh as that
above referred to, must almost inevitably bring some of them to grief,
if not to au end of all sorrow, in the chasms that yawn close beside
them.
It further appears that these murderous'pit-falls are all situated "on
the estates of the same noble proprietor." Here, surely, the "Cornish
Mi<ER"is in error. The proprietor of au estate in which unfenced
shafts are allowed to gape for victims by the parsimony that grudges to
rail them in, is a proprietor who cannot be noble. Whosoever owns
those estates, if there are any, in Beer Ferris, ou which these open-
mouthed pits of Acheron beset the wayfarer, he is a base proprietor;
unless, indeed, his astounding negligence may be imputed to idiotcy.
Furthermore it seems that, whilst there is an Act of Parliament which
prescribes fences for the mouths of ironstone and coal-mines, no law
exists to necessitate the like enclosures for lead, tiiL and copper-mines,
at the bottom of which, as certainly as at that of the others, the body
of a person falling would be dashed to pieces.
"A Cornish Miner" justly observes, that the lords of the manor
whereon shafts are left without fences, " ignore the moral law that pro-
perty has its duties as well as its rights." They may indeed be said to
bd regardless of the distinction between mine aud thine; the mine
down which thev let other people tumble, and the bones of those other
people t hat are broken at the bottom of them.

THE PUFF POETICAL.

ompassionating the exceed-
ing dulness of the authors
who are kept by tradesmen
to draw up the Puff adver-
tisements and paragraphs by
which the newspapers are
vulgarised, Mr. Punch has
prepared a few of these
articles, in the style of the
day, but of a more literary
and graceful texture. They
are at the service of any-
body who may send Mr.
Punch a handsome spenimen
of the advertised ware, and
a Bank of England note
for £100.
WOULD THAT WE TWO WERE LYING was, we thought,
scarcely a wish for a Clergyman to utter, because he must know
that lying is wrong; but upon a second perusal of the Rev. Charles
Kingsley's beautiful lines, we perceive that he refers to a physical
positiou and not a moral error. We therefore wish that he and the
public generally would come and inspect Flufpyboy and Stopfer's
monster collection of Beds, Bedding, and Bolsters.
T
HE IMMORTAL

remarked, in one of his spark-
ling plays, that "any man
who can write can answer a

-profound truths with which
the gigantic genius of
Shakspeare was studded
thick as quills upon the
frightful porcupine, but he
might have added; that the answering a letter becomes a labour we
delight in, if we use the -new OBlsctrimed Albata Brlpckosslnoxea

OWHY SHOULD THE GIRL OF MY SOUL BE IN TEARS,

wipe them away on one of Mrs. Flimsical's beautifully embroidered
pocket handkerchiefs, worked by the mermaids of Madagascar, and
price elevenpence halfpenny.

trated mustard, and may be bought at all the stations.

rMUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE, the^awteirt yet languishing
votary of the latter tenderpassion desired that it might play on, but
did not decide the question. There .can he.no doubt, however, that the
listening to music while food is being taken is extremely healthy, and
therefore the proprietor of the Slap-bangery Refreshment Rooms
begs to announce that he has secured three Italian organs, which will
perform while dinners are going on every day from 3 to 7.
0" LD MAN 'TISNOT SO DIFFICULT TO DIE, says Manfred

celebrated Hair Cutting and Dyeing Rooms, Low Holborn.
HEARTS ARE NOT FLINT, AND FLINTS ARE RENT,

object, She's all my Smutcher photographed her.

OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT you will hear mice running about

Clicker's Patent Mousetraps, which catches the mouse, extinguishes
him painlessly, throws him.out of window (open or shut) and sets
itself to catch another?
ANOTHER SHAKSPEARIAN.
By way of promoting what it has pleased somebody to call Shak-
sperianity, Mr. Punch begs to subjoin a portion of a circular which has
been issued by a provincial artist, who devotes himself to the elevated
art of—well, not to put too fine a point upon it—of pointing the hair.
The true poet is modest, and therefore we conceal this writer's name,
but, to adopt the style of the provincial press, he resides not a hundred
miles from a town where a sovereign, who had not his hair cut off, but
his head, surrendered himself to the Scotch, who sold him.
"POETRY.
"Poetry is of two kinds—Descriptive and Real—the former oxpressionably

In this kind of beautiful Poetry Shakspeare, from his mdcscribablo sublimity and
charming expression stands unrivalled. The real Poet, however, has another sphere
of action, he contributes literally to the Embellishment of the Human Frame; the
fascinating effect of which is demonstrating on the sensuous organs. Of all external
objects, a Graceful Person and a Beautiful Head of Hair is the most agreeable—is
the beau ideal of Poetry—the unerring appealer to the heart; winning our regards,
fixing our esteem, and riveting our affections. This Poetry.of the person can be
cultivated in every department by'visiting
"PETER PINDAR'S HAIR-CUTTINO AND CURLING ESTABLISHMENT.
"Peter Pinoar's Perukes are unquestionably the most unique of their kind, they
will fit the head so as to defy the detection of the greatest connoisseur; in short,
they only require to bo seen to be styled the archetype of Nature. N. U. Private
Rooms. Ladies'.Maids taught Hair Dressing."
Surely, surely, Mr. Pindar ought to have been placed on the
National Shakspeare Committee.
T\RINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES was a sweetly-
±J worded if slightly sentimental expression of feeling, by the late
Benjamin Jonson, and the subject has been pictorially treated with
much success by Mr. Calderon, but the "sweetest eyes were ever
seen" will wear in time, and then comes the question where to go for
Spectacles, to which the answer is, go to Squintum and Winker's.
HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE improve each shining
hour, is an mquiry which has never been answered, but those who
are desirous to improve all hours, whether they be shining or sloppy,
should provide themselves with one of Engine and Turner's cele-
brated Watches, warranted for eight-and-forty hours.
HOW SMALL OF ALL THAT HUMAN HEARTS ENDURE,
the part that Kings or laws can cause or cure, wrote the great
Lexicographer, Samuel Johnson, but if that admirable man l ad ever
tasted the hams cured at Brine's establishment, he would have said
that the latter had added to the harmless gaiety of nations.
A Medal of Protection.
Among the Italian decorations is one, worn by Signor Crispi and
others, called "The Medal of Marsala." If this signifies that the brave
fellows have drunk much of that liquid, we have no words strong
enough to express our admiration of their courage. And we know
what we are talking about, often dining in "genteel" districts, and we
have some thought of sending for the medal, and wearing it at dinner-
parties as a graceful hint. When certain smiling hosts say to us "I
hope you like that sherry, it comes from a first-rate fellow's cellar," we
shall simply turn our medal—thereby meaning "Quite the Reverse."

Quoth that Prince of Shop-walkers and Principals, Pam,
To his book-keeper Gladstone, and John, his head shop-man,
"I should know the public, yet puzzled I am,
What article's best in the window to pop, man.
"Last year trade was languid; there seemed nothing doing,
Then our stock didn't take, and the public held off it,
Till on striking our balance, for all Gladstone's screwing,
There appeared on the books scarce a penny of profit.
"From us those unprincipled chaps o'er the way.
How to dress their own window have managed to learn;
And don't mind (from our shop to draw custom away),
That untradesmanlike falsehood—you know—' same concern.'

And unless we find something the public to fix, •
I'm afraid, gents, that so far a fortune from winning,
The concern will be bankrupt, and dividend nix.

Thanks to you, Master Johnny, we've largely o'er-bought;

And of bad bills, I know, there's a box at the bank full;
How to save the concern when I ask you to ponder,
All you can suggest to one's,'Rest and be thankful.'
"As for Gladstone he does try to keep down expenses,
But he is such a beggar to argue and reason,
He '11 prove black white, spite of a customer's senses,
And to carry his point, would risk losing the Season.
"If it weren't for my manners, my style of shop-walking,
And shaving the ladies—or gents, for that matter;
Of Pam & Co. s smash soon the town would be talking.
Spite of Johnny's smart letters, and Gladstone's glib patter.
"There's one comfort, if people our goods ain't quite nuts on,
They fancy still less that chap's over the way:}

But a conscience don't suit Derby, Dizzy & Co.;

RATHER SIGNIFICANT.
An enterprising theatrical speculator was being dissuaded by some
friends from going to Australia and establishing a playhouse in the
wilds. "You'll nave nothing but kangaroos for audience," he was
told. The undaunted if imperfectly educated manager replied, "Well,
I suppose Kangaroo money is as good as anybody else's money.'
Whatever Kangaroo money may be worth, it is quite clear that Federal
money is not as good as English. The Great Western Railway of
Canada has reported that its losses during one half-year, last past, by
taking King Abraham's bad money, and turning it into Queen
Victoria's good ditto, amount to £29,460 13*. 6rf. The sixpence may
be dismissed as Mr. Mantilini dismissed the halfpenny, but a loss of

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
(We can only hear the words, "You 're a—" on account of the noise; but the rest arc
supposed to be)—" A Happy New Year to you!"
•' The Same to yoo, and many of them!" [Perhaps they imply something else.
TALLY-HO!
The cry of " Tally-ho!" is one which, if raised in Par-
liament' would probably awake responsive echoes, unmingled
with roars of Order!" Prefacing a speech, it would at
least attract attention. It may be hoped that this shout
will be heard on an early day in Parliament, not as pre-
liminary to a proposal for legislation relative to fox-huntingr,
but as the introduction of a motion concerning a kind of
more noxious vermin than foxes, and not tending to their
preservation. The vermin in question are glanced at in a
presentment adjoined to the verdict of a Coroner's Jury in
conclusion of an inquest held at Falmouth on the body of
one Mary Ann Angove, who had poisoned herself in a state
of mind caused by some tallymen, who, under a County
Court judgment, put a bailiff into her house to recover a
debt, which she had run up with them for clothes, un-
known to her husband. The finding was "Temporary
Insanity," and the observations which accompanied it,
unusually sensible for their source, were these:—
"Tho jury cannot separate without expressing a strong condem-
nation of the tally system as at present carried on, and would hope
that the Government would bo induced to pass some stringent
measure to stop the same, this jury believing that the death of the
deceased is clearly traceablo to the anxiety brought on by pro-
ceedings taken by the tallymen to realise a debt contracted with
them without her husband's knowledge."
There is no necessity for any statute to legalise the
extermination of tallymen. Every object that could be
gained by dooming them to die would be answered by an
enactment providing, more effectually than at present, that,
in cases wherein they give a married woman credit without
her husband's knowledge, they shall not recover.
New Fact in Electric Science.
Medical men state (and, curiously enough, it also stands
to reason) that a certain amount of electricity is conveyed
to the system by the receipt of a telegraphic message.
The words which nave run along the wire convey the fluid
to the clerk, who transmits it to the paper which you receive.
It is, the doctors say, a very healthy thing to take a
course of telegrams, and their efficacy is increased by the
shock which it gives most people to receive a telegram at
all. We had not looked at the matter in this light, but shall
immediately begin curing all our sick friends by incessant
transmissions of electrifying jokes.
OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
My dear Punch,
I think we now with safety may congratulate ourselves that
the reign of stage sensation is coming to an end, and that we are return-
ing to the reign of better sense. The Colleen Bawn and Octoroon have
gone where glory waits them in the provinces, perhaps: at the Peep o'
Day we no more get a peep o' nights in London, and the lovely Lady
Audley no longer is convicted of her ill deed at the well. Let that well
alone, is my advice to managers, for I cannot well believe that any good
can spring from it.
Some two or three years back, the great Mr. Bamboozlicault did
his best or worst to make our managers imagine that their audience
cared nothing for mere poetry or penmanship, and that a good, strong,
startling sensation scene or two was all that was required to make a
play succeed. How the great Mr. Bamboozlicault misjudged the
British playgoer the marked success of Manfred was quite proof enough
to show: and further evidence is furnished in the mere fact that Miss
Bateman by the poetry of her acting has for upwards of a hundred
nights been filling the Adelphi as full as it was ever while Bamboozli-
cault there reigned. The new play at the Princess's is another sign
moreover that good writing is still relished, and that there are playgoers
in plenty still existing who enjoy a play not merely for the set scenes
there may be in it. Donna Diana is decidedly the best piece which has
lately been imported for our stage, and although its adapter has a little
spoilt the last scene to produce a stage-effect which the author had
abstained from, he has upon the whole performed his adaptation with
much cleverness and taste. All who care to see what a good Spanish
play is like, should go and see El Desden con el Desden in its English
dress: and thanks to Mr. Vining they will no longer be annoyed by
the cries of "nuts, cakes, oranges, lemonade, and gingerbeer," whicn
used so rudely to destroy the nice illusions of the stage, and knock the
play out of one's head almost between the acts.
It may seem poor praise to say that the pantomime at this house is
really a very good one, for the advertisements assert of every pantomime
in London, that it is "universally acknowledged" to be the "very
best." There are some good scenes and good fun too in the one at
Drury Lane; but I think the heartiest laugh that I have had this season
was at the drollery of the donkey in St. George and the Dragon, the part
of the donkey being played by Mr. Frederick Payne. A runaway
donkey is not a very common sort of creature, and the funny way in
which Mr. Payne makes an ass of himself is enough to make one any
night burst out with a horse-laugh.
\Vhile I speak of Covent Garden, I must applaud the management for
bringing out Fanchettc. It really is a very pleasant little opera, and I
am not at all disposed to join with certain critics in making a complaint
about its Frenchiness of style. Light and lively music is just what our
composers seem least able to invent, and I only wish that one of them
would so far imitate the "Frenchy" school of composition as to let us
have an opera with a little of the sparkle of Ije Domino Noir. Not but
what the English style is also capable of liveliness. Mr. Macfarrex
is no copyist of Acber, yet his Jessy Lea is certainly a lively little
work, and its success proves that the public would be glad of others
like it. There was a brimming audience the last evening I heard
it, and though now withdrawn to make room for the new Egyptian
Entertainment (you can conceive what capital fun the trio at the Gal-
lery will make out of a tourist party at the Pyramids), it will, I hear, be
soon resumed as an afternoon attraction without spoiling the Egyptians
of the treasures they will nightly bring into the treasury.
There is little more to say about our theatres just now: but from
Australia we learn that after having, I doubt not, performed his part as
chaplain on board ship with great applause, the Rev. Charles Kean
has laid aside his parson's bands, and resumed his actor's buskin and
his natural stage strut. How correctly his great genius is judged at
the Antipodes this extract from the Melbourne. Herald amply serves to
show:—
"The chief charm of Mr. and Mrs. Kean's acting consists in their perfectly lifelike
and natural rendering of every character. Yoara of close study must have been
required to produce that ease of manner and studious avoidance of anything 'stagey'
that characterises their endeavours. Not the slightest approach to theatrical clap-
trap is ever observable—no courting tho plaudits of the pit and gallery—their

yet be made a vehicle for historical instruction and moral example."
Well, different men have different opinions. and as a critic in Aus-
tralia of course has better opportunities to cultivate his taste than one
who is unfortunate enough to live in London, it would scarce be seemly
in me to venture a denial that this estimate of Mr. Kean's great talent
as an actor is most thoroughly correct. I would merely say that as I
am a "pleasure-seeker" when I go to see a play, I wish with all my
heart that Mr. Kean in future would act only m Australia, where, if
his critic there be credible, his acting gives more pleasure to those who
are of course well competent to judge of it, than it does to your less
able correspondent, qne who pAYS
A GOOD HA'PORTH.
ir,—Here are a few sugges-
tions for the form thai a
Shakspearian Memorial ought
to take, forwarded to mo from
various quarters, in order
that they may obtain the
required publicity in the
columns of your widely-oir-
culated journal,
It is proposed—
1st. That it ought to be
about Shakspeare, or per-
haps M i ltox. but at ail events
somebody who lived about
that time, always excluding
Olivia Cromwsll,
2nd. That it must not be
anything to eat, or if it is, not
very hot, like a salad, which
would be emblematical of the
country where the poet re-
sided.
3rd. That it, whatever it
is, must be made of stones
from Stoney Stratford, out of
compliment to the district-
surveyors of Englaud as a
body.
4th. That it shall be portable, with pockets inside.
5th. That it shallTbe a Shakspeare Scholarship, to be holden on the
following conditions j viz.:—
That the candidate shall be able to repeat by heart and sing all
Collier's emendations to'MALONB's notes.
That the holder shall be required to read alond the entire plays of
Shakspeare every morning before breakfast, for the space of one year.
That in his second year of holding, he shall repeat the performance
with the addition'of dressinghimself in the costumes of all Shakspeare's
characters, including the Witches in Macbeth and the greasy citizen in
the Roman crowd.
That on the 23rd of every successive April, he shall hunt samphire
gatherers on the Cliffs of Dover.
That in honour of Falstaffs ragged army he"shall go to Coventry for
the remainder of the year.
Hoping, dear Punch, that the Members of the Shakspeare Committee
will give their serious attention to these propositions.
I remain, yours, energetically,
A Retired Hamlet.

OLD WORLD TALES, OR PASTIME FOR THE
PRESENT.
The summit of Mount Olympus, in Thessaly. was the abode of the
gods, goddesses, and deified heroes. No mortal, qua mortal, has ever
ascended these heights, with the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Benjamin
Disraeli. That most ancient deity Kronos or Saturn used .to devour lib
children, not with caresses, but literally, and without |auy caresses at all.
It was evident that he liked them though as his wife Queen Rhea could
not help remarking, he certainly had a very queer method of showing it.
They were for a long time a perfectly happy family, and his sons and
daughters born prior to his youngest, Zeus or Jupiter, never once disa-
greed with him. This last child, however, did not>hare the fate'of his elder
brothers and sisters: and consequently, modern writers on .the subject
bold that he was probably brought up at Harrow, seeing that his mother
never intended the young Jove to be an Eaten Bay.
Be this as it may, the fact stands that Mater Rhea, being in a diffi-
culty with regard to this child, did what mos t married ladies would
have done under similar circumstances. She consulted her mother,
Madame Terra.
"Let me have the child," said that estimable Matron.
"Yes, Mamma, if you think that's best," returned the dutiful
daughter, who, however, did not muoh relish the notion of putting her
favourite out to nurse. "But as Saturn is sure to ask for him, what
shall I tell him?"
"Urn!" Terra was considering. At length a bright thought struck
her.
"Of course," she observed, inquiringly. "Ha always used to send
for the children at dessert."
Rhea signified that suoh had been her amiable husbaud's custom.
"Hi indulges?" hinted her mother.
The tears rose ',to Rhea's eyes. She oould not but acknowledge the
existence of this unfortunate propeusity.
"I don't Uke to say it before you, my dear, for I wouldn't give you
pain for a moment, and a Mother ought never to set her daughter
against her s m -in-law; but I can't help saying that .Saturn does behave
like a brute."
rama!" expostulated poor Rhea,
ra was working herself into a fury,
only stick to his Ops and give up that nasty neotar-wine,
something with him; for the matter of that, though, we
could do a great deal more without him."
At this both ladies laughed, and when Terra's gravity was quite
restored, she resumed the subject in hand.
"You send the boy to me. I've some wonderful stone-fruit, candied
last'season when I was making my jams; Rocky Mountain plums, or
pome-granites we 're thinking of calling them. There!"
So saying, she produced from her store closet a fine specimen of the
first Orleans growth. It was floating like a luscious island in the midst
of a sea of syrup.
"Mind you wait for your opportunity," said thecrafty old lady; "and
the wretoh will swallow it down as if .it was the finest dish of kid he'd
ever tasted."
She alluded to the fashion of those primitive times, whioh was
to introduce the joint at the very close of the meal; a custom
that has since been adopted in some parts of Germany, Russia, and
elsewhere.
So Rhea thanked her kind mother, and reached the palace iust as
Kronos, who never waited for anybody, was sitting down to his dinner.
An Ecclesiastical Auctioneer.
The New York Times amuses us with a piece of truly American
intelligence:—
"Pew Sale.—At the commencement of the new year the usual meeting was
held in the Rev. Hexry Ward Beechkr's Ohurch to dispose of the sittings for tho
year. The church was crowded to its utmost capacity. Precisely at 7 o'clock Mr.
Beecher appeared on the platform, and in a few words stated the object of the
gathering and the terms of salo."
Was it on the platform that Mr. Beecher appeared? According to
our English notions, the reverend gentleman should have appeared in
the pulpit.

Iun. A tuneful aud accurate ear must be Mr. Longfellow's, and yet
from the internal evidence afforded by the volume, we gather tuat the
Transatlantic Rhapsodist (under which term are .not included Spiritual-
istic Media) approves of, nay more, has an affection for, itinerant
grinders of organs, midnight waits, and their unequal measures.
Herein lies the proof of our assertion; let the reader, any reader, open
the book at page 11, and he will there find the description of a Young
Poet, a graphic portrait of one of the Sitters around the cheerful Fire;
but the youth is praised, aye, actually praised, in the following couplet:
"He did not find his sleep less sweet
Fjr music in soma noi^abourins street."
Gsoi gracious! 'tis clear that Ma. Longfellow never knew the
pleasures of a quiet quarter in London. At this point, even as I am
penning these lines, comes an organ-man playing dismally round the
corner; and, if I mistake not, a small baud with brass enough for .any-
thin?, is at the other end of the street, just commencing the overture
to William TM. E;t.her they go or L They won't, so I '11 step out
and call upon Mr. Babbage.

COLNEY HATCH QUADKILLES.
Sm,
As I suppose your readers include a great many young ladies,
and young gentlemen whose ideas of diversion are in a great measure
similar to those of young ladies, whilst both the young gentlemen and
the young ladies have learned from the perusal of your pages to think,
let me invite them to exercise their reflecting powers on some facts
which must be premised by the following explanatory quotation from
the Times:—
"The Colmey Hatch Christmas Party.—Yesterday evening the managers of
the Colney Hatch Asylum gave their annual treat to the inmates of this excellent
Institution. On former occasions we have described so fully the incidents of these
entertainments that it is hardly necessary to say more now than that this Christmas
party was, as usual, a great success. Of the 1,900 inmates of the asylum about 600,
malo and female, were permitted to take part in the festivities, and to them were
added at least 300 visitors, who mingled freely in the crowd, and helped to promote
the fictitiouB solemnity of the occasion."
What I wish your young friends of both sexes to ponder is the nature
of the amusements wnich seem to have particularly delighted the crazy
and imbecile inmates of Colney Hatch. The report above quoted con-
tinues :—
11 The amusements provided by the "visiting committee were numerous, but
though the Nigger Minstrels were loudly applauded, the troupe of Chinese jugflrlers
and contortionists were by far the greatest favourites. The great dining hall of the
asylum was the chief sceno of the sports. At one end was erected a temporary
stage on which the various troupes engaged kept up a constunt succession of
amusements."
The intelligent readers of Punch, male and female, may amuse them-
selves, and perhaps instruct others, by reading to those others whom
it may concern the foregoing account of the sort of fun which is
peculiarly adapted to the class of mind to which Colney Hatch affords an
asylum. "They will not be surprised to find that the Nigger Minstrels,
and the Chinese jugglers and contortionists afford a special gratification
to the demented and insane. But the succeeding statement will puzzle
them:—
"In the remainder there was ample space for dancing, and, to tell the truth, if
the committee had engaged two or three quadrille bands, one to succeod the other,
so as to keep up a continual succession of danco music, perhaps they would best
have consulted the general taste. With or without purtuers, the patients never
seemed tired of whirling round the room either to the polka or waltz measures.*
Is it possible that much as Nigger Minstrels and Chinese mounte-
banks are to the taste of lunatics and idiots, yet that insanity and
impaired intelligence find recreation still more congenial in the sparkling,
music and the graceful movements of the dance?
What philosopher will dare to propose a solution of this apparent fact
in psychology? Not any will be hazarded by,

I wish they'd skin a few." Mr. Punch immediately ordered the savage!

Living as we have, you'd have ho Dyspepsia, I'll be bound; good bye."
NOBLE CHAFF.
The Earl of Derby, in his speech on the Address, playfully com-
pared Earl Russell to Bottom, the weaver. A peer who is accus-
tomed to spin yarns, might as well have said nothing about weavers.
If one noble Lord calls another by a name which is an euphemism for an
ass, no wonder that the other should retort in terras of corresponding
courtesy. Accordingly we find the Foreign Secretary giving the noble
Lord, the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords, a reply
equivalent to " You 're another," and something more. As thus:—
"But I will now'proceed to the comments which the noble Earl has made upon
my conduct. He began with a good deal of wit and with a good many facts. But
while his wit was excellent in itself—indeed, there could be none better, seeing
that it was all taken from Shakspeare—the facts of the noble Earl, which were his
own, had no more foundation than the story of Bottom, the weaver, himself."
The dream of Bottom, the weaver, of course the misreported Minister
said. "My dream shall be called Bottom's dream, because it hath no
bottom." So, neither, says the noble Earl Russell, had the facts of
the noble Earl op Derby. And then, quoting Sheridan, the former
noble Earl said that the latter "borrowed his wit from his memory, and
his facts from his imagination "—in other words, spoke the thing that
was not. And so began the Parliamentary new year in their Lordships'
house with the compliments of the Session.
FROM AN OLD HOSS.
Sir,
Hay? what? did you observe that an old Hoss like me, who
used to be ridden post many a time to Gretna Green, could be of no use
now in these Railway Days? Neigh, friend, but these steam people
are coming back to us, after all. Why, Sir, 'twas only t'other day that
I heard two of the Directors of the Greatest Line say to one another,
that their Excursion Trains to Somewhere and back for half-a-crown,
would never pay unless they were properly advertised, and that to
forward these Trains in every place, they must employ plenty of Posters.

ONE OF THE GREATEST "MYSTERIES OF PARIS,"
Here is a dreadful falling off! We read with amazement, tho ugh it
is true the curious event took place during the Carnival, that:—
"At a Public Ball given by the wife of the Prefect of tho Seine, at which 3,000
persons were present, no Crinolint was worn."
Bravo! The French Venus has at last left the iron cage in which
the Vulcan of Fashion had too long imprisoned her. Paris nad of late
been celebrated for two styles of fortifications, the enceinte continuie, and
the Crinoline, and really in point of area the one extended almost as far
as the other. The latter is fortunately now abolished, and there wiM be
all the more room consequently in Paris. The cry of " It n'y a plus de
Crinolines!" will be added to the old historical one of " // n'y a plus de
Pyrenees," and the removal of the barrier will give pleasure to thousands
ot patriotic Frenchmen, on account of there beiug one obstruction the less
in their country. Crinolines impeded free circulation fully as much as
passeports, and when the latter fell in France, we felt confident that
the former could not long stand up and assert their galling tyranny.
We congratulate the above Prefect upon having abolished this despo-
tism, which was like a big thorn always in one's side, and upon haymg
completely established a new era of freedom. This inauguration entitles
him for the future to adopt as his motto "Mens sana tn corpore sano,"
for it is clear that there now presides a mind that is sane in the prefec-
toral body of the Seine.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [F«bmrt 13, 1864.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
hursday, February
4M,lS6i. The young
gentlemen of the
Westminster Clas-
sical, Commercial,
and decidedly non-
Mathematical Aca-
demy re-assembled
after the holidays.
The Mistress was
not present, but one
of tbe Monitors,
Lord Westbury,
read a Message in
Her namr. This
had ham dmwn up
by the Head Master,
and some of his col-
leagues, and was
not very much ad-
mired. It was
thought to tell less
than any Message
that haa ever been
sent to the Academy,
even when Pitt
Sbcundus had risen
to be Head Master,
and chose that no-
body, should know
anything but what
he pleased to an-
nounce himself. But
it was said that
several of the Mas-
ters held differing
opinions, and had
been obliged to agree upon a Message that should express no opinion
at all, and if so, this is not the way to manage a great school which
gives tone to English Society. However, most of the boys seemed to
think that "Ola Pam" as they affectionately if irreverently call the
present Head Master, knew pretty well what he was about, and they
cheered him very loudly when he came, with his cane in his hand, into
the Lower School, the louder that a severe sentence had just been
passed on a low Irishman, who had been flinging mud at Old Pam, and
telling lies about him.
The Message was given, as usual, in the Upper Sehool, where the
noblemen are taught, or it is tried to teach thein. The Mistress's
eldest son, Edward Wales, was there, and so was his cousin George,
the soldier, who is a good-natured fellow but too much led away by his
chums, and not quite so considerate of his inferiors as a brave boy
should be. When the Mistress comes, the re-opening of school is quite
an imposing sight, and no end of ladies come, to see how their relations
look when being sent back to their forms. But on Thursday there was
not much of this kind of thing. The boys of the Lower School were
sent for, and came running in with their usual noise, and with the
gown-boy at their head.
The Message began with a pleasant subject, a mention of Ma. and
Mks. Edward Wales's little boy, who was born at Frogmore during
the holidays, to the great joy of everybody, as his parents, and his.grand-
mamma, tlve Mistress, are very dear to all of us.
Then the School was told of several things which were taking place
in various parts of the world, and it is right that these things should be
known, so the whole school went, as it were, into Geography class for
a short time, and was told this:—
That all the great Queens and Kings of Europe,'and many of the
little ones, had in 1852 solemnly put their hands and seals to an agree-
ment that nobody should take away any of the territories whieh the
King or Denmark then possessed. Now wc all know that in direct
violation of that agreement, the Germans are trying to take away two
pieces of the King's dominions,—two duchies, called Schlesvvig and
Holstein. While the Message was being delivered, cannons were
roaring, and men were being killed iu Schleswig, where the brave Danes
were trying to beat back the Prussians and Austriaus, and had really
done so many times, though the Germans had an immensely superior
number of men. Wc were told that England had tried to prevent the
fighting, and would try to stop it.
That the Japanese had behaved so ill to subjects of the Queen or
England that it had been necessary to demand satisfaction, which the
Tycoon, the Japanese temporal ruler, had given, but one of his proud
and powerful nobles, the Prince op Satzuma, had resisted, so that
English ships had been obliged to bombard his stronghold and bring
him to his senses. "Incidentally," a very large city had been burned
lamymany thousands 01 its lntiaDitauts nau oeen killed,
was converting tins naughty Prince to civilisation, and
hat the Queen regretted, as, we dare say did the inha-
>sima. However, you know, "sorry for it" is all that a
down, and probably many thousands of its inhabitants had been killed^

gentlemau or lady can saj.
That the New Zeahmders continue, in the most strange way, to
dislike having their lands settled upon by settlers who will soon settle
the tattoed people out of tin- way altogether, but that the English are
enforcing this Law of Settlement in a vigorous manner, and will soon
have shot so many tattoed folks, that the others will see how wrong it is
to object to civilisation and Christianity.
Tliat England has made a treaty with Austria, Prance, Prussia, and
Russia, by which sue gives up the Ionian Islands, and annexes them to
Greece, and is staking a treaty with the King uF Greece, who is fool-
ishly styled Km* <jk tub Hellenes (a Preuchioed title, and not to be
compared with the other aud noble one), as to the .terms of the union,
about which we shall hear a good deal more.
That the couditiou of England,was "on the whole" satisfactory, and
that she might look tor much cotton trout knds which have hitherto
given her but little.
That some Bishops and otherjgrave persons had been* ordered bv the
Queen or Km.la\;» to examine and to revise tke forms of words by
which clergymen bind themselves uot to preach anything but what is
said in the Prayer Book to be right.
This was all the Message had to say. Nothing about America, where
a dreadful war is going on; nothing about Poland, where the Russians
are doing very cruel and unjust things; nothing about Mexico, to which
a bran-new German Emperor is going to be sent, if he can borrow
money for clothes and housekeeping; nothing about China, where
English soldiers have helped the Imperialists to a victory, after which
these people committed most savage massacres. We all thought that
the Masters bad been so busily quarrelling that they had had no time to
read the newspapers. However, it did not much matter, and Monitor
Loan Westbury having read the Message very well, minding his
stops, sounding his aitches, and not dropping his voice at the end of
sentences, the Schools wene dismissed untd the regular hours for getting
to work. It is thought by the boys that there will be a good many
fights this half, and it is certain that there will be a great
bilious.

Mr. Punch having, with his usual exquisite flexibility of pen, thus
pleasantly allegorised the introductory ceremonial of Thursday last, pro- i
ceeds to the sterner—in fact to the Laurence Sterner duty of making a
Sentimental Journey through the debates of the Session. He doubts
not that he shall come to the episode of the Donkey in good time, and 1
promises not to forget the rope's end, or its use. Meantime let us
overhaul the Debate on the Address.
The Marquis op Sligo, who moved it, astonished the Browses, his
namesakes, by appearing in the elegant uniform of the London Irish
Volunteers. Lord Abercromby, the seconder, was "barely audible,"
which shows that though his place is at Tulliboddy, he, when in his I
place, is not a body like Tully.
Then, of course, the Earl or Derby stood up, to open the bombard-
ment, and having pleasantly chaffed Lord Sligo for having alluded to
many matters not in the Speech, of which Lord Derby supposed that
the Volunteer had not seen the latest edition, the Earl proceeded to make
notes on that document, and mentioned that 110 new cotton mills are
preparing to open in his Lordship's part of the country when trade shall
improve. He then invited Earl Russell to a little mill. He got to |
work at 'once. Loud Russell had turned out the Tories by t he trick i
of promising Parliamentary Reform, and being safely in oflice, had
thrown that notion overboard, told people to rest and lie thaukful, and
turned to foreign politics. As to these his policy had been " meddle
and muddle." Nihil quod tctigit non—conturbacU. He was like Bottom,
wanting to play every part, including Moonshine aud Lion, and like the
latter, knowing when to roar like a sucking dove. (These pleasantries
riled Earl John, who could reply with nothing newer than that Earl
Edwakd had drawn on his memory for his wit, and on his imagination
for liis facts—0! O! O !) Then Lord Derby waxed grave, and let
into his antagonist on a great number of points of foreign policy, hoping
we were not committed to a disastrous war with Germany, or to the
betrayal of Denmark, who had trusted us. Lastly, the Earl declared
that the vessel of the State was in a most perilous position, and he had
no confidence in the incompetent hands of the Ministry.
The Earl Russell was prompt to meet his foe, contradicted him
generally, aud in detail, and afflicted the Peers by going at great length
into the Sclileswig-Holstein business. The Danish Minister here had
expressly said that Denmark expected no material (which means physical)
aid from us, but ouly sympathy. A despatch from the Prussian Minister
stated that Prussia and Austria, though invading, meant to adhere to the
Treaty. (But please to wait until you have read something later.—P.)
Earl Grey, the Ileraclitus of the Peers, and Earl Granville, their
Democritus, having respectively wept and smiled over most subjects,
the Address was voted, aud the Lords.adjourned at 9'35.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
mons {Punch waits for performances) be it said that Lord Richard
Grosyenor, in the costume of a Cheshire Yeoman, moved the
Address, which was seconded by Mr. Goschen, the junior Member for
the Citv, and who is decidedly a clever man. Having thus made him
happy for life, let us proceed to say that
Mk. Disraeli delivered a slashing speech against Ministers generally,
•but chiefly against Lord Russell, to whose office .Mr. Disraeli has
obtained his own consent to succeed, when the Tories and the Cockli-
crancs come in. He considered that England was right in not going to
Congress, but wrong in having refused in a rude manner. As to Greece,
we had done nothing but blunder, and though one could guard against
an enemv; no human sagacity could baffle the unconscious machinations
of Stupidity. As for Denmark, Ministers had no policy, but came to
bes one from Parliament. They were always discourteous to the House
of Commons—let them be so—let them humiliate the Commons, but not
ask them to bear responsibility. We bad alienated all our allies, and
except the Kikg or Denmark, have not a friend in Europe. Where
were the papers which the House ought to have P
Lord Palmkrston said that Ministers had a policy, a very good one,
and one which the House would support. It was a Policy of Peace.
It was odd that if we bad no allies, other powers insisted on acting with
us, and France, Russia, and Sweden had joined us in calling on the
Germans to halt. The Premier made the same statement as Lord
Russell had dono about the undertaking by the Germans to respect
the Treaty. He promised no end of papers, and wished anybody joy
who had to read them, and he ended with some rather clever badinage
touching t he cruelty of Government in not giving Mr. Disraeli a peg on
which to hang an amendment.
Only three other points arose on which'jWr. Punch intends to remark.
One was, that after the Government had made the semi-satisfactory
statement about the Germans and the Treaty, Sir John Pakengtoti
was rude enough to bring out the fact tbat there was an "if" in the
matter. The Germans will respect the Treaty, tbey say, if the Danes
don't fight too hard, or obtain assistance from any other power. What
do yoa think of that, my Catti?
Secondly, Mr. Hennesst said (and was rebuked by Mr. Oi.^acrom
for the "indecorum" of saying), that wax with Germany hau been pre-
vented by the Queejt herself.
Thirdly, Mr. Kinglake asked, what the people would say if we now
went to war about agnails and cognacs—bother, we mean agnates and
cognates.
Then the Address was voted, and the Commons adjourned at 11'55.
Friday. In the Lords the Chancellor, who was last year empowered
to sell a number of small church-livings in the gift of the Crown, was
happy to announce that the article commanded a very high llgure.in the
market, and was much sought after.
Mr. Whiteside thought that Ireland ought to have been mentioned
in the Speech, drew rather a melancholy picture of the condition of that
country, and complained that the Chancellor of Ireland was wicked
enough not to give away much patronage to the enemies of the Govern-
ment. Sin Robert Peel thought that Ireland was getting on very
well, and that there was no need to make a fuss, ana Mr. O'Hagan
defended the Irish Chancellor, boldly and ably.
HIGHLY PROBABLE.
Said Duos to Shakspeare,
"In your cause to take spear
And ride a tilt, all in your colours,
Is what we aspire to,
'And England would Are to--
We, your National Monument-mullers."
Said Shakspeare to DrxoN,
"More half-pence than kicks on
My behalf though you 're anxious to scrape hence,
I'm afraid you will find
The Public inclined
To present you with more kicks'than half-pence."
LITERARY SMASHERS.
The Americans'are very fond of coming words. They do it almost as
extensively as Mr. Secretary Chase prints greenbacks, and we doubt
if the circulation of the one is much more valuable than that of the
other. They are unquestionably the largest utterers of false notes in
the world, so far as our lingual currency is concerned. If " the pure well
of English" is to remain "undefiled,"no Yankee should be allowed
henceforth to throw mud into it. It is a form of verbal expectoration
that is most profane, most detestable. This propensity for defiling that
which should be kept as pure as possible, has been greatly on the
increase within the last few years. - Indeed, it is with pain we confess
that, ever since the war began, the Yankees have been giving the
English (and if. has been a most savage way of displaying their animosity)
no hing but bad word*!
OUR RAILWAY KINGS AND COMMONS.
Caution! Only look at this :—
"It appears'from Bradshaw's Manual tbat the Session will open with forty-seven .
Railway directors in the House of Lords, and, one hundred and nfty-three in the
House of Commons."
People who complain of Railway Aggression may guess from this brief
paragraph what likelihood there is that Parliament will look to the
protection of their property. One might as well expect a parliament of
poachers to pass an Act for the protection of partridges and pheasants,
or a parliament of pickpockets to propose a law for making theft a
capital offence, as expect the present Parliament to protect our Capital
(to say nothing of our interests) from the Railways which are threatening
it. With two hundred directors to direct its demolition, London soon
will be so cut up tlrat we shall scarcely know it. What was once a
noble city will become merely a place where any railway rubbish may
be shot. Wherever he may live in it, a Londoner will find he cannot
call his home his own; for, as toon as he gets settled in it. his house,
the chances arc, will be required for some new Railway; and if he moves
into another, he will hardly get his things straight when he again has to
torn out. To judge by what one sees, as well as what one hears of, a
residence in London will soon not be procurable without a Railway
burrowing and rumbling through the cellar, or a Uailway running close
by on a level with the drawing-room, or a Railway bridged across the
street a few feet from the roof. Indeed, if Railway schemes continue to
pour in as they have done, we Londcmre may soon expect to see St.
Paul's pulled down, aud its ball and cross stuck up to adorn a monster
erected on its site.
THE DROP AND WHAT NEXT?
A Leader in the Morning Post, insisting, not without some show of
ason, that a murderer ought to be hanged whether he goes mad or
not, contains these words:—
"With regard to the question of preparation for the next world, that might
equally be ur*ed against hanging murderers at all. It is no mure valid as a reason
fur not executing a murderer gone mad after sentence than it is as a reason for
abolishing capital punishment altogether. To spare the murderer on t his account
is, to that extent, to hold out a positive and palpable temptation to commit murder.
But it is doubtful if any .reasonable person who has reflected logically on the subject
really ever supposed that, ae regard* tbe murderer's future position, the very sus-
picious sort of repentanoe thatcan tako place, during the very short interval between
sentence and execution, can make any difference one way or the other."
If it does not, to hang a man is to send him—whither?
Thither, whither because Hamlet wanted to send his uncle, he would
not kill him when he found him at prayers. If this is so, the farce of
spiritual ministration to the condemned criminal might as well be
abolished. If it is not so, then, as the Prince of Denmark remarks on
the above-mentioned occasion, to put him to death is "hire and salary,
not revenge." Hanging seems to be infinitely too bad or too good for
a being who, like Michael Cassio, has "a soul to be saved." if a man
dies as a dog, hang a murderer like a dog, by all means. But if not,
how then? Could secondary punishment be tried, with the under-
standing that, in case of its failure as a preventive measure, the stronger
remedy of hemp should be reverted to?
ENGLISH PLAYS AND FRENCH CRITICS.
We cite this from the Paris Correspondent of the Daily Telegraph :—
"In the Petit Journal of to-day I road that Mr. Webster, of the Adelphi, and his
'favourite interpreters of Shakspeare,' have taken twelve places in the steamer
from L< >ndon to Boulogne, and two special carriages—deux wagmit- ep&iaux—in the
train to Paris, and are about to perform here. The first perform mco will be the
Maid of Lyons, and then Othello, Lear, At You Lilce It, and Hamlet. Fkchter has
been offered thirty napoleons a night to join the expedition The critic, whoso

tion of English genius, and to call out tbe usual expression, of suocess, 'All right I
Shakspeare we know, and Loud Btron we know, but who is
James P In the "British host" of novelists the name is not unknown,
but the dramatic works of James by no means are familiar to us. After
a play by "Williams" it would rather be a novelty to see a farce by
James; and we hope that Mm. Webster, when he returns from Paris,
will let us have this treat. If he does so, like our French friend, "we
shall be in our stall," and ready to applaud the success of the per-
formance by shouting out, as usual in our theatres, "All right!"

TROTTING OUT THE HOBBIES.
Come spinners of long stapled yarn
For Parliamentary crochet,
With chaff-loads, to St. Stephen's barn,
Eh, vite, Messieurs, approchez I
Be it on spec, on sale, or view,
Now trot out all your hobbies,
Your thorough-breds and cock-tails too,
Hacks, cart-horses, and cobbies.
From dry statistics' barren waste,
From facts and figures' ploughed-land,
From the far-distant fields of taste,
From high ideal Cloud-land!
Empty the mare's nests, where your steeds
Have left their eggs to addle.
And, whatsoe'er your hobbies' breeds,
Muster to "boot and_saddle."
Here limps the over-trained old hack
All jocks have been astride of;
Who's had John Russell on his back,
Whom Dizzy's tried a ride of.
Poor old Reform! Through wear and tear,
In spite of sprain and spavin, you
Have still, so Bright ana Gibson swear,
A gallop for the Avenue!
Alas! is this the high-bred colt
All England once was sweet on—
So hard to hold, so strong to bolt,
His pins so firm and fleet on:
Engaged so deep, his friends scarce knew
Which event to begin with,—
The horse we backed till all was blue,
The nag all stood to win with!
Poor old boss! you may put up Bright,
In his flame-coloured jacket,—
Quote Gibson's tip, "the prad's all right,"
(With his cash will he back it P)—
"Rest and be thankful," cries the friend,
Who tooled him once 'gainst Bobby;
The toughest nags must have an end,—
Take home that hard-used hobby!
See where, behind, the string advance!
Hobbies out-running mention:
There's Berkeley's Ballot, Kinglake's France,
Cobden's Non-intervention:
Fitzgerald's Bounce, and Whalley's Cry,
Hennessy's Roman Candle,
Dizzy's Caucasian Mystery;
Lennox's Totcnley-Scandal:
A weedy, washy, leggy lot,
As ever paced the paddock!
No more like winners of a pot
Than sprat's like Dublin haddock,
Says Pam, with just a leetle wink
Over his wary shoulder,—
"Old Confidence is safe, I think.
Though he were ten years older!"
Fructicultural Economy.
An Apple-pie Order.—Those Horticulturists who supply their own
fruit puddings and tarts from their own garden, should take care, as early
as possible, to order the children to commence making apple-pie beds.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REAL RAILWAY ADVANTAGES.
Scene—The Consulting Room at the back of the house of Mr. Mag-
neesher, the eminent M.D. Place, within very easy walking
distance oj two new Metropolitan Lines, which, of course go to Charing
Cross. From the windows of the room can be seen an anything-but-
distant view of the two Ifejw Stations with telegraph posts, and signals
at work, Policemen, Porters, and Passengers moving to and fro; the
whole conveying an idea of great traffic and active Metropolitan
Railway life. Without the aid of a glass can be plainly read, on ilie
Right Hand of the View, a large placard headed, Bayswater, Bur-
lington Arcade, Charing Cross, and Borough Line. Trains
every Five Minutes!* Cheap Fares! And on the Left Hand
a larger placard, advertising The Brompton, Piccadilly, GBa-
rino Cross, Borough and Bloomsbury Line. Trains every
Seven Minutes! Cheaper Fares!

The Curtain rises to painfully slow mmic played before the front door by
an itinerant Organman. Mr. Magneesher discovered sealed,
looting over his book qf Fees and Professional Engagements. Front

out of order.

are shunting something or other, during which Consumptive
Patient strikes his chest several times, to explain that he has
got something the matter with his lungs.

Railway noises, shouts quickly). Heart?
Cons. Patient (catching the idea just in time). Lungs!

[Mr. Magneesher having expressed in pantomime that he will
"sound" his Patient, it about to apply the stethescope. Several
trains pass over iron railway bridge. Mr. Magneesher's house
is shaken violently. Mu. Magneesher is jerked-against Con-
sumptive Patient, taking him sharply in the ribs with the
stethescope.
Cons. Patient (falling in chair and turning very pale). Oh!

[Mr. Magneesher shakes both his fists wildly at the Railway
Stations, utters something not loud but deep, ami sits down to
write to all the Papers at once as the Curtain descends.
The closing declaration of M.'Rouher, in the dehate on the Address
voted by the French Chamber, is one whieh, accepting it as trust-
worthy, we should hail with loud cries of " Hear, hear!" The Imperial
Minister of State said that:—
''France will undertake no foreign war without preliminary e insert, except in
cases ia which her own boundaries or her own honour are concerned."
Mistrust, however, not altogether unfounded, might incline us to
receive the foregoing announcement with parliamentary exclamations
of "Oh, oh!" if not with unparliamentary shouts of "Walker!"
What does M Rouhkr mean by the boundaries of France? Those
which are laid down in the existing Map of Europe, or in the
Map of Europe as traced by the Imperial imagination? Because
the latter mav include the Rhine Provinces, at least, and at furthest
any extent of territory. The boundaries of France did not include
Savoy and Nice before France annexed, or eonveved them as the
wise call it; and it may be that any ease in which the conveyance
of any boundaries whatsoever by France is concerned would be a case
which France would consider that her boundaries ware concerned in.
Then too the honour of Frauoe would be concerned in any case wherein
her glory is concerned, if, ss seems probable, France regards honour
and glory as convertible terms.
The assurance that France will undertake 'no foreign war without
preliminary concert, affords some hope of harmony, which may, however,
turn out to be the mere preparation of a discord. France lias a reason-
able ear in music; give her the drums and fifes.
Nevertheless, the profession of M. Rouher ou behalf of France,
understood in its plain and natural sense, nicely expresses the principle
which every taxable Englishman will implore our Government to
observe in their foreign policy. We have not helped the Poles against
the Emperor of Russia, nor the South in their struggle to resist
Yankee subjugation; we lure not interfered to prevent the "grand
customs" that are practised by His Majesty the Kins or Dahomey.
Honour can hardly prick us on to any intervention, now that it has
tolerated infringements of the Treaty of Vienna. We are men of
business, and hare no business to fight except for our boundaries, and
the business which we carry on outside of them.

OUR LAW COURTS.
A Pastoral Entertainment.—German Reed's by Shirley Brooks.
In consequence of the numerous inconveniences still existing in the
legal "runs" out of the Warren of Westminster Hall, the Bench and
Bar have determined, as there appears to be but little chance of any
alterations, additions, or improvements, for some'time to come, to accom-
modate themselves to their unhappy circumstances. The officers of the
different Courts (to whom we hereby tender our best thanks—a legal
tender we in our ignorance hope—for their courtesy) havej?ut us in
possession of some of the possible arrangements.
In order to give a few seats to the Queen's Counsel near the Judges,
Justices Blackburn, Mellor, Crompton and Shee will sit in each
other's laps, turn and turn about.
Jurymen in use will adopt the same'plan. Jurymen in posse will he
in watt under the seats of the former gentlemen.
Senior Barristers will squat like tailors or Turks, so as to make room
for the Juniors who will be also squatting out of sight below the seats.
When Juniors have to address the Court, they shall'do so kneeling,
allowing their heads to appear above the partition. :..lu consequence of
this arrangement,. the term " Standing Counsel" to any Company shall
be abolished.
The Public shall be at liberty to sit wherever they please. Smoking
allowed in every part of the Court, except in the chimneys.
Refreshments.—Punctually at one o'clock, apples, oranges, gingerbeer
and Lists of the Causes shall be handed round by those respectable
she-vendors who have been ejected from the pits of the Haymarket,
Princess's, Lyceum and Adelphi theatres. There will be a private
Luncheon Bar for the Judges only behind the Court of Probate and
Divorce: here there will be a J udicial Luncheon on the table d'hote
principle, to be known as the Judge-Ordinary.
A supply of hot-water bottles, wrappers, comforters and'cloaks, and
other protectors against the various currents of air pouring in from all
sorts of unexpected quarters, will be let out by the Ushers and other
Officers of the Courts at a fixed tariff.
The Attorneys shall sit in their own draughts.
These practices will be probably adopted on the first of ApriL
The Great German Knavy.
The Cabinets of Berlin and Vienna arc said to have'givfen assurances
that the integrity of the Danish monarchy would be preserved. It
would be a fine thing if they could preserve their own; but there is too
much reasou to fear that they haven't got any.

THE WAR AND PEACE TAX.

Around our necks a millstone hangs,
Whn3e weight occasions cruel pangs;

SHUTTING 'EM UP.
Quite right, Mr. Yardley (Beak), and continue to be as firm as
Yardley Oak, celebrated by Cowper. It is quite time to put a stop
to the system of making a Police Court a sort of sub-editor's room,
where flimsy " is received in order to its publication in the newspaper.
The Magistrates have enough to do without listening to statements to
which people desire to give publicity. Punch reads with satisfaction
that the representatives of the General Omnibus Tympany (and by the
way. why are the weekly receipts of that Company published every
week, any more than the "takings" of Jones the butterman, and Fry
the tripeman of the New Cut, respectively ?) were thus received by the
respected Yardley :—
"Mr. Wilkinson (addressing the Magistrate) said—I beg to claim your indul-
gence for a few momenta in reference to an application which appears in tho papers
of this morning, and which was heard hero on Saturday last.
"Mr. Yardley. The application heard here, and you say it appears In the
newspapers?
"Mr. Wilkinson. Yes, Sir.
"Mr. Yardley. I cannot listen to you. You must address yoursoU to the
newspapers.
"Mr. Wilkinson. I only wish to make a statement that
"Mr. Yardley. Stop, Sir. I will not allow tin* Court to be made the arena for a
public discussion of what appears in newspapers.
11 Mr. Wilkinson made another t-ffort to be heard, when
"Mr. Yardley said he had no control over the newspapers, and therefore he
could not interfore in the matter.
"Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Church thon retired."
A very proper thing to do. Some persons seem to think that a
Magistrate sits to be talked to,' and they act as the French actor did
in the farce of Parlez au Portier. Seeing the inscription, he pretended
to take it for an invitation to general conversation, and insisted on
engaging the enraged Cerberus in gossip on every topic of the day.
Mr. Yardley does well to repress such attentions. If they are to be
permitted, we shall have gentlemen making a pleasant morning round
of calls at the police-offices, favouring Mr. Knox with opinions on the
new play, sketching the plot of the new novel for the benefit of Mr.
Arnold, congratulating Mr. Burcham on the progress of^the new
Garrick Club, and finishing off by enlightening Mr. Paget (very glad
to see you on the Bench, Mr. Paget, to which you will be an ornament)
with an analysis of the Schleswig-Holstein question. Mr. Yardley
deserves the thanks of his brother Magistrates, and receives those of
Mr. Punch,
ITALY.
It was with considerable pleasure, my dear Mr. Punch, that I read
the following announcement some days ago in the Times:—
"While laying
remains of an old
the pipes, three old paved streets wore discovered, and the
Port and some columns."
There's a treasure to set before a Pope! Why, Mr. Punch, you
can't now-a-days get a glass of an old Port, the genuine thing I mean,
for love or money. I hope His Holiness, or whoever has become the
owner, will at once see the urgent necessity of putting their old Port
into the Pipes. Thank Goodness there are very few non-conformists
among the Italian workmen; I tremble to think what would have been
the fate of this glorious wine, if the labourers who .discovered, it had
been Shakers.
Animus and Mens.
According to the United Service Gazette, a new military crime has
just been discovered at head-quarters. It is called animus, and seems
to mean giving evidence against a superior officer. Whatever animus
may have been displayed in some quarters, there is very little mens
discernible in others.

A NOVEL TEMPERANCE; MOVEMENT.
Correspondent in a news-
paper the other day, speak-
ing of a place which is called
Pierre-fltte (it is somewhere
in France, Cox, so do not
turn to Otaheite), informed
us that—
"By the byo, this same place,
Pierre-fitte, hat just been robbed
for the second time of an article
of public utility, which from its
nature must naturally throw
suspicion on any temperance
men who may be in that district.
For the second time within the
last twelvemonth the publio
pump, with all its gear, has
been stolen out of tho Fontaine
du Regard. Infaglne stealing a
pump, with the thermometer
many degrees below zero. Thore
can be no extenuation there.'*
Were we ever so much
given to indulge in klepto-
mania, a pump is certainly
about the very last thing in
the world that we should
ever dream of stealing. We
could fancy a man stealing an old wine-cask or a beer-barrel, for the scent of the
Manor migbt linger there still, and there might be possibly a drop of good stuff
left in it. But not even a teetotaller, we should think, would steal a pump, unless
he at the same time could purloin the spring that served it. To be sure, a pump
might possibly be sold, although it were a second hand one; or if it were put up the
spout, a trifle might be borrowed on it. But with the thermometer below zero, a
man must be a pump himself to give much for a pump, and the person who could
steal it must be wondrously cool-handed.

THE CAMBRIDGE PRIZE POEM-DENMARK.
And what's this German-Danish row about?
I think I know,
Germans want to go
Where'er they like, the Baltic in and out";
And when you look the map upon,
Pleasant it does not seem.
That Copenhagen should nave been
Placed as it were, right up a narrow spout.
Very big ships it is no use to send,
Because big ships are seen
Each shore between,
Nor doth the case it mead
If the big guns do plump their shot,
.And whether cold or hot,
Out of the way, is the best way to keep,
For if they hit, wood-work will surely rend.
I want to know how our dear friend Mossoo
The question judges.
I fear he grudges,
Germans and Danes must all the fighting do,
Perhaps the territorial slice
Which at the last is sure to go,
And always cuts so very nice,
Might grieve his poor heart through and through.

NEW NOTICES OF MOTION.
Now that Parliament has met again, to the high gratification of every-
body, we hope to hear of the following Notices of Motion being shortly
given :—
A Notice"of Motion to be at all times given to the lazy cabmen, who
go crawling about the streets with empty cabs, thereby turning London
into an immense cab-walk, and preventing other vehicles from pro-
ceeding at a reasonable rate: the said notice to consist of an energetic
intimation that these do-nothing cabmen are to hasten at once to the
nearest cab-stand, and there patiently await their hiring, or else to retire
instantly home with due convenient speed.
A Notice of Motion to be given to all Hansom drivers, that they
need not drive so furiously quick, threatening to cut off a foot-pas-
senger's toes, if no greater injury, every time they sharply turn a corner.
A Notice of Motion to be given to the drivers of all Pickford's vans
and railway goods' carts, conveying a similar caution to the above,
by which means they would not cause so many accidents, nor destroy
so many lives, nor subject their masters to such heavy expenses in the
shape of compensation money.
A Notice of Motion to be given to the contractors of the Middle-
Level Drainage Scheme to get on with their subterranean work a little
more quickly, as their long line of huge wooden traps, continually
foaming, howling, and vomiting, do not materially add to the freedom,
or the safety, of the passase of the thoroughfare, and certainly do not
contribute largely to the acknowledged beauty of the Metropolis.
A Notice of Motion to be given to the concocters of the various
Metropolitan Railways to carry their schemes elsewhere, with the
polite message that our streets are already sufficiently crowded, ugly,
noisy, and dangerous, without requiring the additional interference of
their darkening, defacing, deafening, defiling presence.
A Notice of Motion to be peremptorily given to all organ-grinders
and green baize bands, that they are to transport themselves and their
discordant instruments to lt.dy and Germany with the greatest pos-
sible speed, and distinctly to understand that there they are to
remain for ever and ever, under the extreme fear of being either ground
or blown to death the moment they set foot in this country again.
If the above Notices of Motion oould only be carried into execution,
they would do a great deal more good than tie many puerile vapid
questions which are being perpetually put to Ministers, ana which never
lead to any practical result, and which Notices, by the way, never have
any Motion in them at all, stopping almost invariably at the very point
from which they started.

TELEGRAMS WITH NOTES.
We have to thank Mr. Reuter for the following news:—
"Prince Fricdrrick Charles, of Prussia, employed 74 guns in tho attack upon
Mlssunde yesterday."
Artillery of aggression.
"Mlssunde was in flames."
Incendiaries!
"The attacks on Mlssunde yesterday were made by 9,000 Prussian troops and
two batteries of artillery."
Shame!
"The Danish force consisted of nine companies of infantry and two squadrons of
dragoons, iu all about 2,000 men."
Thermopylae over again—but who was Leonidas? The brute Xerxes
was represented we know, and so were the Persian slaves. Thermopylae
over again, but with a difference:—
"The Prussians mado two attacks, but were repulsed."
Hurrah!
"They at first left their dead and wounded on the field, but the greater part wero
subsequently removed."
Bad luck to the survivors! Miscreants!
"The Ornish loss was from 150 to 200, Including three officors killed and four
wounded."
Glory to the brave!
Slaughtering and. Sleighing.
Writing from New York the other day, "Manhattan" tells us:—
"The sleit(hin? is so fine that all tho New Yorkers and strangers who can enjoy
it forget the groat civil war aud its consoqueuces. Merrily go the million of sleigh-
bell* duriog too eutire twdnty-four hours. There is no cessation. One-tenth of the
costly furs that are aired every day would make warm the shivering and half frozen
armies of the Potomac."
Until poor human nature be much altered for the better, we cannot
expect that people who make money by a war will manifest much grief
for it. Still we think that the New Yorkers might show a more proper
feeling for those whose sons or fathers have perished in the war, were
they to let their sleigh-bells sometimes ring a muffled peaL

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

We expect to be told that this national solemnity is regu-
larly enacted, at stated seasons, in the Town Hall of
Stromness, and as it would have been abolished by the
^discriminate prohibition of dancing, the resolution against
that amusement was so worded as to allow a gentleman to
dance there by himself to his admiring countrymen.
ANECDOTE OF THE FROST.
Sly Gentleman {pretending to look at exposed thermometer). "Quite Thirty, bt
Jove!"
Young Lady Cousin (who has stopped by the most perfect accident). " I 'it nothing
or the kind, Sib; and the idea of your tbetendinq not to see me."
THE STROMNESS SCHOTTISCHE.
Some persons are said to be "too far north" to do anything foolish. Whether
this saying holds universally good may perhaps be questioned by persons of different
intelligence who may read the subjoined extract from the Orkney Herald:—
"A Veto upon Dancing.—The Town Council of Stromness have decided by a majority that
'promiscuous dancing' shall not be allowed within the Town HaJL Promiscuous dancing, wo
suppose, means dancing ongaged in at the same time by tho two sexes. In these circumstances
the Council might as well have adopted Councillor Dunnet's amendment, 1 That no dancing
should be allowed at all,' as a ball for ladies or gentlemen separately would be an absurdity never
heard of beyond the moral region of Strathboglo."
The "Spurgeon Quadrilles," we believe, originated in a joke made, or said to
have been made, by Mr. Spurgeon in one of his sermons. A ball for ladies
separately would be in effect a ballet, and appears not to have been prohibited, but
on the contrary to have been sanctioned by the resolution which forbids pro-
miscuous dancing" in the Town Hall of Stromness. That is the necessary
conclusion from the fact, that the amendment, which simply proposed that no
dancing should be allowed at all, was rejected. It does not perhaps equally
follow that the Town Councillors of Stromness contemplate the permission, in their
Hall, of balls composed exclusively of male dancers. If, however, they are fanatics
of the Strathbogian delusion, there is no saying of what bines they are incapable.
A sort of balls, formed by gentlemen separately, used to be danced in the Temple
by the learned Judges and the Bar, in conformity with ancient custom. Perhaps
the municipal authorities of Stromness are addicted to some such a venerable,
though ludicrous, practice. On certain high days and holidays it may be that, as
men of business, they are in the habit of dancing ceremonial jigs in their Town
Hall with their own partners.
It may be, however, that these gentlemen, who do not object to dancing, but
only to dancing with ladies, will seriously put forth a conceivable explanation of
their reason for disallowing promiscuous dancing, and yet declining to disallow
dancing as such. There is an exhibition, which our eyes have seen, performed
at certain Scottish fetes by a gigantic Sawney in plaid petticoats. It consists in
the execution, to a fast tune on the bagpipes, of a pas teul between the blades of
two claymores disposed on the ground, in the form of a St. Andrew's Cross.
THE ENVY OF THE WORLD.
All the nations how they hate us!
How they do vituperate us!
IS they could annihilate us
Oh, how happy they would be!
What can we have done to fire them,
With the rage that doth inspire them,
Not to do what we desire them,
When we leave them all so free?
Occupied with peaceful labour,
Ne'er do we attack a neighbour;
If we ever draw a sabre,
'Tis but to return a blow.
Never, basely acting under
Love of glory or of plunder,
Do we launcn our British thunder
Unprovoked on any foe.
All in turn attempt to use us,
Find they can't, and then abuse us,
Being able to accuse us
Not of any act unjust;
But it seems that we, old Ocean's
Sons, with our peculiar notions,
In the midst of their commotions
Stand unmoved; to their disgust.
Then we won't adopt their phrases;
Treat their theories as crazes;
Their bombast our laughter raises,
And their idols we eschew;
Don't revere their superstitions,
And their priestly exhibitions,
Ceremonies, impositions,
As they think we ought to do;
Smile when they upbraid and chide us,
And, wherein they can't abide us,
When they sneer at and deride us;
Laughing at our own expense.
Then we wash our hands and faces
Not alone, like other races,
Which in Continental places,
Gives the natives great offence.
And, what vexes most the nations,
We, for all solicitations,
Out of all their complications
Keep ourselves with constant will;
Weigh their auguries as a feather;
In their spite our troubles weather;
Round us while they rage together:
Go right on, and prosper still.
THE DROP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
Some objection has been raised to the alleged barbarity
of hanging seven criminals at once. The simultaneous
execution of any number of malefactors can be admitted to
be wrong only on the general ground of an acknowledgment
of the immorality of capital punishment. If it is right to
hang one man it is seven times as right to hang seven.
The execution of seven wrong-doers differs from that of one
only as a septet differs from a solo. There is no reason why
a gibbet should not be a seven-stringed instrument.
Granted, the rightfulness of the gallows, and "We are
Seven" is as good a neck-verse as any other. On the
contrary supposition a septuple execution is a sevenfold
wickedness, and the instinct that hesitates at hanging seven
people at once, whereas it would not scruple to hang one at
a time, is only a purblind moral sense, which, in order to be
enabled to see that an evil is an evil, requires it to be
magnified.

indifferent musicians. But
why not go and state my
grievance at head-quarters,
and petition Parliament to
free me from the nuisance f
Well, you kifow the off-baud
way in which petitions are
presented, and then chucked
aside, and never afterwards alluded to. Besides, the swells who sit in Parliament live mostly
in big houses, where the squeals of a street-organ can never fairly penetrate. So you see they
don't believe in the torments I, and such as I, continually endure, and they fancy our com-
plaints are ill-founded and ridiculous. I suppose they will next say that there are no such
things as barrel-organs, because it may so happen that they never chance to hear them: and
after that they may declare that there are no such things as nerves, since they chance to be so
fortunate as not to be tormented by them. But if they won't believe my word, perhaps they
will believe the Timet, and, speaking of the recent tables of mortality, this is what that journal
lately said upon the subject:—
"Diseases of the 1 .rain and nervous system killed nearly two hundred Londoners in a singl* week of last
month."
The Times insinuates that this was chiefly caused by overwork, and I won't deny that
such may partly have occasioned it. But street music is, to my mind, the chief cause of the

mortality. A nervous man comes home fagged
out with his day's work, and instead of getting
quietly his after-dinner nap, he is kept awake and
irritated by a beastly barrel-organ. Or perhaps
he is an artist, or a poor wretch of a writer, and
directly he sits down to work, some street-music
strikes up, and he loan half-an-honr or more in
vain attempts to stop it. Small as they may
seem to men robust and vigorous, these annoy-
ances are greatly felt by men of weaker health
whose brains are overworked. Indeed, I am
not at all sure but that street-music often
brings such victims to the doctor, and, by con
sequence perhaps, to the undertaker also. I know
if I were on a jury where a death were traced
to nervous or cerebral causes, and supposing it
were shown that the deceased disliked street-
music, I should do my very utmost to persuade
my brother jurymen to find at once a verdict of
"Musical Manslaughter by miscreants un-
known." Viewed as to its "effect upon men
sensitive in nerve, a street-organ is not merely
an instrument of tortare, but an instrument of
death; and if I had my way, I would no more
a man to play one in the streets than I
let him walk in public brandishing a
broadsword, or banging a revolver at every
man he met. Depend on it, dear Mr. Ptmck,
street-music might be stopped, if an Act were
introduced making street-musicians liable to
be taken into custody, and triad for a felonious
and foul attempt at manslanghter, on every
occasion when thev played within the hearing
of any one who hates them. I for one shall
not be satisfied until the matter is taken up,
and all street music-players also: and perhaps
with your assistance an Anti-Organ-Grinding
League may soon be pat in operation, which
may coerce the Government to pass the needful
Act.
With double windows to my study, and wool
in both my ears, I beg leave to subscribe myself

ACTING UPON SUGGESTIONS.
Mr. E. T. Smith, the present energetic Lessee of Astlcy's, announces
to the world in his unobtrusive advertisement that:—
"It will be his study to attend to every suggestion that will add to the comfort
and convenience of his Patrons. Stalls fauteuUa have been suggested for subscribers,
and are being manufactured."
The following suggestions are offered through the medium of our
columns, by numbers of the most influential personages.
That the Lessee at his own expense should send carriages to the
private residences of all those Patrons who have secured second row or
lrout seats beforehand, in order to convey them to the Theatre in
proper time, so that their entrance shall not disturb anybody after the
performance has be<run.
That a select body composed of the loveliest Coryphees shall receive
the hats and cloaks, and sprinkle with eau-de-cologue the pocket-hand-
kerchiefs of such as may desire it.
That to each row of seats throughout the House there should be
appointed a guide capable of explaining the intricate mysteries in which
the present Piece is mvolved, and to prevent the people from leaving
after the First Act under the pleasant impression that it is all over.
That there should be a Turkish Bath, a Hairdresser's Establishment,
Smoking Saloon, Reading Room, a Drawing Room for Ladies, Telegra-
phic Station, and Library attached to the establishment.
The Ladies suggest that Mr. Smith should combine his Dramatic
Exhibition with a Small Dog Show furnished with the best specimens of
Puppies out of the Stalls fauteuils.
A Trifle from Gibraltar.
An International Pigeon Shooting Match is about to be held in the
north of Prance. Some say that there will, later, be another, in the
South of Spain, and that the article aimed at will be the Rock.
Cricketing and Fashionable Intelligence.—We hear that a dis-
tinguished member of the Cricketing Eleven of All England is going to be
married. It is said that the object of his affections is a Beautiful Catch.
"PACKE'S VOBISCUM!"
The Leicester Journal is an excellent paper, and we dare say that its
art-critic is an excellent art-critic. But in noticing a portrait which has
just been painted, depicting Mr. Packe, M.P., for South Leicestershire,
that critic uses rather an equivocal expression:—

exceedingly well as he it thus

of the i
thus represented, and the picture itself 1
The praise, if somewhat general, is not immoderate, like the gushing
eulogies in which London critics indulge themselves. But the hint that
Mr. Packs looks well only in the picture is, we rather think, a breach
of the privileges of Parliament, and we suggest that the editor be called
to the bar of the House.
THE POETRY OF RAILWAYS.
Railway Companies are anything but poetical, and yet what a pictu-
resque notion of London must be conveyed to the thoroughly provincial
mind by the announcement of a Line to run right through 'Holborn
Valley." We must write the words once again, for we seem to inhale a
breath of fresh country air, and are inclined to babble of green fields,
murmuring brooks and shady nooks, as we write down—Holborn
Valley. It reminds us of the time when that much maligned monarch,
Richard the Third, inquired of the Bishop,—
Cre-fydds' Family Fare.
Such is the title of the thousand and first, just added to the thousand
cookery-books already in existence. "Cre-fydds" we presume to be
the Cymric form of "Griffiths ;" but surely a book devoted to
"Cre-fydds' Family Fare" is rather a superfluity, seeing that we have
always understood that family fare to consist exclusively of Welsh
rabbits, leeks, and cwrw.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
February 8, Monday. The Lords, like friends (according to a late
Peer named Byron), "met to Dart." But the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council met for an important purpose namely, to deliver
judgment in the case connected with Essays and Reviews. The Lord
Chancellor gave it, the Bishop of London and some Law Lords
being present. The sentence which Dr. Lushington passed upon the
Rev. Dr. Williams and the Ret. Mr. Wilson was reversed, and the
Bishop op Salisbury was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.
Without touching needlessly upon a very grave subject, it may be stated
that henceforth Clergymen are permitted to disbelieve that every word
in The Book is true, and to "hope" that the most terrible of Calvi-
nistic doctrines is based on an error.
England has Remonstrated with Austria and Prussia for sanctioning
the proclamation of the Schleswig-Holstein Pretender. This is all she
intends to do, seeing no reason to imitate the honest farmer who said
he had " remonstrated" with an insolent exciseman, and being asked to
what effect, responded that he did not know anything about effect, but
| that he had afterwards been obliged to borrow a hammer to straighten the
poker. England keeps her poker for her own fire, into which she does
not intend to pat too many irons. Friends at a distance, and near, will
please accept this intimation. Pah seemed inclined to think, or at
| feast to say, that Austria and Prussia might be disposed to respect
treaties. A celebrated Irishman remarked that pigs might fly, but that
I they were very unlikely birds to do it. The Premier showed earnest-
ness in denouncing the doctrines put forward by the Germans.
Cows may be interested in hearing that malt, for their food, may be
manufactured free of duty, but a tenth of the weight is to be linseed
cake, to prevent cow-malt from being made into human beer. The men
"whose talk is of bullocks" seemed pleased.
Mr. Gladstone proposed a measure for improving the character of
our Tax-Collectors. He also 'proposes that Taxes shall be demanded
by post, instead of letting a Collector come to your house when you are
out, or in an ill-temper, or have not the money handy. We think that
taking into consideration how the ladies bate the very name of tax, and
how impossible it is (Bless Them) to make them understand why such
things must be, Paterfamilias ought to be allowed grace in cases where
Materfamilias, in excessive disgust at the demand for money, has flung
the notice into the fire, or rammed it into one of the vases on the
ehimney-piece, so that it has been buried under spills, ends of string,
the handle of that drawer, the solitaire marble the child left on the rug,
the brass nail, the box of Cockle's, and the circular in aid of the
Society for Promoting Christianity among the English.
Then did Sir George Grey proceed to deal with Dr. Cranky
Cracker and his accomplices. After endeavouring to justify himself in
the matter of the person who ought to be the late G. V. Townley, he
introduced a Bill for altering the machinery by which mad-doctors
interpose between criminals and justice. Instead of leaving an attorney
to select any two Justices whom he. thinks will favour his client by
selecting Cranky Crackers to inquire into the state of his' mind, the
"Visiting Justices of the Gaol arc, exclusively, to select medical men in
cases of alleged insanity. Such doctors are to be registered practi-
tioners, so hundreds of dirty little men, who can be hired to say anything,
will be excluded. Next, the certificate is not to be final, but the Home
Secretary may order further inquiry. This plan does something for
the protection of Society, though not much. There was a debate, in
which a general opinion was expressed that Sir George Grey could
hardly have done otherwise than he did with Townley, and in which
Mr. Bright expressed his surprise that men could long act as Home
Secretaries, having to undergo the agonies of such responsibilities.
Many estimable persons could Dear a good many agonies for a front
place in the world, and £5000 a year. Sir John Pakington com-
plimented Sir George upon the firmness with which he had resisted
Lambeth and other pressure in the case of Wright, which firmness
Sir John thought did the Home Secretary " infinite credit." But
he thought that Townley ought to have been hung.
Mr. Milner Gibson bad a Committee of five appointed, to" meet a
similar Committee of Lords, and to take all the Metropolitan Railway
schemes into consideration. If these ten gentlemen do their duty, they
will make a clean sweep of a host of plans, and construct a system of
Railways that will be a boon to London. "If" is a little word, but
there is a world of meaning behind and before it. Punch docs not think
the Committee well selected, with reference to its special duty. The
leading members are chiefly remarkable for being very conversant with
the forms of the Houses.
Tuesday. Danish talk, of course, in the Lords, and a strongly worded
declaration from Lord Restandbethankjul, in favour of upholding
treaties.
Listen! The Duke op Somerset speaks. '" We have not as yet a
good broadside gun for the Navy." Need we add a word?
Danish talk in the Commons, and Lord Palmerston believing that
Austria and Prussia will give up Schleswig-Holstein when the Consti
to revoke it without war, and England having offered to be witness
to his engagement that he should, the deaths of all who have been
slain in the fights are simply atrocious Murders, committed by the King
of Prussia and the Emperor op Austria. \
Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald gave the Ministers a well-deserved
wigging for not producing the Danish papers. Mr. Latard said that
they would take three weeks to print. "Send them to the Timet," said
Lord Derby, when receiving a similar reply; we should then have
had them in eight-and-forty hours. Pam came to the rescue, but could
make no case. It may be that the printers for the House require three
weeks, but as it was known that the documents would be wanted, why
were not nine-tenths of them in hand a fortnight ago f Echo answers
that Government meant to keep them back as long as possible.
Then we debated the burning of Kagogima, Mr. Buxton moving a
resolution of regret at that "incident." He sketched with some power
the horrors which such a conflagration must have caused in a large city.
Lord Stanley thought lhat we had behaved ill or foolishly in most of
our dealings with Japan. Lord Robert Montague approved the
burning the city. Mr. Kinglake condemned our poncv. Mr.
Latard made an amusing speech, defended all that had been done, and
did not believe that the damage had been so awful as was represented,
as Orientals were accustomed to conflagrations, and always ready to
bolt. Mr. W. Forster rebuked Lord Russell for writing letters on
international law instead of minding his own business, which was to
understand Japanese affairs. Sir Rootdell Palmer said that we
had a right to bum the citv, and that Admiral Kuper had behaved
with great forbearance. Mr. Whiteside, of course dissented, and
complimented the commercial gentlemen for condemning an act per-
petrated in the interest of trade. Lord Palmerston made a long and
spirited—we had nearly written Cheeky—defence of the whole proceeding,
and hoped that no British Admiral would ever be fired upon without
returning the fire. He proposed to move the previous question, that
is, to prevent the expression of an opinion by the House, but the
Commons would not stand this, and divided (which it is very unusual
to do so early in the Session) when 164 voted that it was right to burn
Kagosima, and S5 thought it was wrong.
Axh Wednesday is the dav on which we make the actors and
actresses go without their salaries, in order that somebody may begin
Lent with a penance. The Houses made holiday, and we hope enjoyed
salt-fish and egg-sauce. We didn't—the fish was hard, and there was
not nearly enough sauce; but such is life.
Thursday. Lord Derby wanted the Steam Rams papers, and Lord
Russell would not give them, alleging that the production might
injure the Government case. Aries is giving Taurus a deal of bother.
Greenwich Hospital has been discovered to be a perfect marvel of
misappropriation of funds, and petty annoyances to inmates. We never
could understand why the old Salts looked so awfully crusty when wc
beheld them sunning their old wrinkles as wc strolled up from the
Railway to Mr. Quarterh art's and Mrs. Maine's. But the whole
business is to be overhauled.
Mr. Gladstone proposed to enable the Scotch banks to issue some
new bank-notes to replace others that had " lapsed." The £1 paper is
very convenient, and when a Scotchman finds twenty shillings he can
always make a note of it.
Ferrand the Furious, in his usual wild bull of Bashan fashion,
demanded the names of all persons who have ever acted as Charity
Commissioners. The bull was appropriately answered by one Lowe.
The names are to be given. There is reform-work to be done in this
direction, but scarcely by the Fiery Ferrand.
Friday. The conflagration of the Ballet, and the means of escape
provided for an audience in case of fire, were subjects which occupied
the Commons for a few minutes. Lord Sydney, Chamberlain, has
written to the green-rooms, advising caution. Shall we parody Lady
Mary? We will. Singeth the corps of "Jesuits of the short robe':"—
» children, fears forgot,
And what is much a happier lot, ,
We 'U havt no fftu-lighu bare.*'
Then came a debate about the Federal cruisers, and there were very
strong expressions of dissatisfaction at the outrages they commit upon
English vessels. But Lord Palmerston assures us that the American
Government is always very civil and sorry. However, murder by
Federals is now alleged, and though New York is not Japan, we really
think that some little notice ought to be taken of the affair. As Mr.
Keeley says is Twice Killed, If it's murder, mention it.M
tution shall have been revoked. If they do, the King having offered Another!"

INHUMANITY IN MAN.
From a statement by Mr. Sydney Hodges in the Timet, confirmed
by the Commissioners in Lunacy, it appears that the treatment of
Lunatics in the Isle of Man is very barbarous and disgusting. If the
manners of the Manxmen are not speedily amended in this particular,
we shall be obliged to propose that the Isle of Man shall henceforth be
called the Isle of Brute.
The inhumanity with which the insane are treated in Man cannot,
however, be dismissed with this remark. To the communication of
Mr, Hodges abovementioned is appended the following letter:—
"Office of Commissioners in Lunacy, 19, Whitehall Place, S. W., Jan. 2S.
"Sir,—I have laid before the Commissioners in Lunacy your letter of the 25th
Inst, and its enclosures. I am desired by them to stato, in reference to the case of
alleged neglect of a lunatic in the Isle of Man, they hare been long aware of tho
inadequacy of the provision for lunatics in that Island. The Government in that
Island are at present taking active measures to build a proper asylum ; but as a
considerable time must elapse before this can bo done, the Commissioners have
drawn the attention of tho Secretary of State to the desirability of making immediate
and temporary accommodation for these lunatics. The jurisdiction of this Board
does not, however, extend to the Isle of Man ; and I am therefore desired to state
that the Commissioners do not see what course can be taken in regard to the case
mentioned in Mr. Peacock's letter and pamphlet other than bringing it, as he
already has done, under the attention of the Lieutenant-Governor.
"I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
"Sydsbt Hodges, Esq." "W. C. Spring Rick, Secretary."
For ingenuous simplicity if this document can be matched, let the
pattern to it be sent to Mr. Punch. The Commissioners have long been
aware of the inadequacy of the provision for lunatics in that island."
Have they indeed? Then how came they, all along, not to bring it
under the cognisance of the Secretary of State, and not to suggest
to that Minister "the desirability of making immediate and temporary
accommodation for these lunatics," pending the establishment of per-
manent provision for them, a long time ago? Why did they wait to
be instigated to make a tardy representation to Government by Mr.
Sydney Hodges? Were they afraid that they would be snubbed by.
the Home Office, and desired to mind their own business exclusively,
and take no notice of brutalities not perpetrated simply within the
limits of their jurisdiction? If, with any reason, they entertained any
fear of this kind, and did not dare to communicate with the Home
Secretary till they were furnished with an excuse for taking that
liberty, then the only fellow to Sir George Grey is Captain Speke's
dark friend the African Monarch, who orders his wives to execution for
a breach of etiquette, when they presume to offer him anything to eat.
In that case these poor Commissioners are to be pitied and condoled
with as cramped and fettered by bonds of the most preposterous red
tape. Otherwise they may be considered as comparable to Captain
Speke's other dark friends, the African ladies, who are fed and fattened
and kept doing nothing, till, like our own prize pigs, they are unable to
stand. And then curiosity would like to ascertain the united weight of
the Commissioners in Lunacy, and to know if they grunted when Mr.
Sidney Hodges, in promoting their office, stirred them up.
The Commissioners of Lunacy allowed years to roll by before they
attended to the ill-treatment of lunatics beyond their jurisdiction. Are
they not all descendants of the gentleman who would not cry at a
pathetic sermon because it was preached out of his parish f
A Kind Suggestion.
Say the paragraphists,—
"The Conservatives have established a new organ in London, called the Realm."
Hadn't they better have called it the Seam, as at once easier to the
news-boys, and as indicating the probable amount of the circulation?
PIKES IN THEATRES.
Mr. Dion Boucicault has addressed a letter to the Era on this
subject. This talented gentleman ought to be an excellent authority
upon the easiest modes of egress from those places, which may have, at
any time, become too hot to hold him.

MULTUM IN PARVO.
Peak Me. Punch,—I hare been for
some time past in want of a Foot-
man. The Startupps next door
have had a boy in buttons for ever
so long, and as I said to my hus-
band (who is teally too tiresome in
some things), we can as well afford,
with a little management, to keep
a Page as the Stabtupps can.
Well, perhaps, that is not exactly
what I was going to say, as I must
not intrude upon your valuable
spaces (that is the proper term, is
it not ?) with my domestic matters,
but " when the heart is full the
head is out," as the poet says, and

vexatious, and addition is as bad,
for all the children's arms are taking

comes three times a day told me),
and I'm worrited (or worried, is
it?) to Death, but Fbedebicx
showed me an advertisement:—
FOOTMAN (UNDER). A Young
Man. Height 0 f t. 1.
And said sneeringly (he calls it his
fun, but it's his malice really), would that do? Now, my dear Mr.
Punch, what's this young man under?" At six feet one he couldn't
be under any Butler, even if we had one, who wasn't at least seven
feet. And then he'd want very high wages. How could I sharply
•overlook such a monster! Don't you think, my dear Mister Punch,
that there is some mystery about this? Perhaps the supposed menial
is of High Birth? Some people, (and the Startupps can put on the
cap if it fits 'em), may like to De waited upon by a smiling cherub up
aloft, but I don't pretend to this, and I do think that when Young
Footmen, who are young six-foot men, advertise their height, they might
also name their wages, and save a great deal of trouble to such as

the Ghost of Goldsmith, in a flutter of pleasure.
Goldsmith. My dear Doctob Major, and all of you, what do you think?
Dr. Johnson. We think, Sir, that you are going to make a foolish speech.
Goldsmith. You think wrongly. I am going to give you the pleasure
which good ghosts feel in the pleasure of a friend.
Dr. Johnson. Neatly said, Sir, and I beg your pardon.
Goldsmith. Now, Sir, you do wound me. But listen. They have
turned my comedy, She Stoops to Conquer, into an opera, and are playing
it at the finest theatre in London.
Garrick. Comedy, indeed! Farce, my dear Goldy.
Dr. Johnson. Davy, lace. Nomenclature is arbitrary.
Boswell. And you hate anything that is arbitrary, Db. Johnson?
Dr. Johnson. Sir, I will tell you what I hate worse,..and that is any-
thing that is idiotic.
Garrick. Poor Bozzy!
Dr. Johnson. Nay, Sir. {smiling) we know whom it is useless to bray
in a mortar. Now for this wondrous tale of your farce, Doctor.
Goldsmith. Farce, if you will, but it was the best production of its
day, unless you think that the Good Natured Man was as admirable.
But you shall not ruffle me. It has been set to music, and is once more
delighting all the intelligent metropolitans.
Garrick. I own that I think you have reason to be pleased. For at
least half of your language must have been cut out, and new words
must have been substituted.
Dr. Johnson. Yes, Davy, in the fashion in which you presumed to
improve the dramas by Shakspeare.;
Garrick. I knew my business.
Dr. Johnson. Yes, Sir, and so does the thief who steals my boots and
cuts them down into shoes.
Boswell. That is an admirable illustration, Sir.
Dr. Johnson. It is not, Sir, if it can please you.
Goldsmith. Come, Doctob Major, I never heard that Irene was ever
set to music.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, I suppose that a fiddler is incapable of even reading
Irene; but that is no excuse for your impertinence.
Boswell. I am sure, Db. Johnson, that Dr. Goldsmith meant
nothing.
Dr. Johnson. And, Sir, I am sure there is no one better qualified than
yourself to speak of a no-meaning. I used the word impertinence in
the legal sense, implying that Dr. Goldsmith's allusion was not perti-
nent to the matter in hand.
Boswell. It is worth while to incur your censure, Sir, to receive your
apology.
Dr. Johnson. You. Sir, frequently do the first, but seldom the second.
And you are pleased, Dr. Goldsmith, because your ideas have been
handed over to fiddlers and squallers to be reproduced in a mutilated
form, and to be applauded, not for themselves, but because they now
tickle the ears of fools. Fie, fie!
Boswell. You speak harshly of the divine art of music, Dr. Johnson,
yet you have told me that you once tried to learn the flageolet.
Dr. Johnson. I did Sir (smiling), and am sometimes apprehensive that
I caused reprehensible annoyance to the feline rivals of my melody
during their nocturnal peregrinations.
Garrick. Now, Sir, suppose that you had succeeded, and had become
a composer of music.
Dr. Johnson. Nay, Davy, suppose even a worse fate, and that I had
composed music for thy songs m honour of Shakspeare.
Goldsmith. I consider Miss Hardcastle the most charming character
in the range of English comedy, and I regret that I did not add music
to her various accomplishments.
Garrick. And that Colman did not allow you to accompany her upon
the flute?
Goldsmith. No, indeed; for then the audience would have attended to
me, and neglected the lady.
Dr. Johnson. Dr. Goldsmith, you pain me. You have written poems
which are an ornament to the literature of your country, and you take
a pride in a flippant farce that at the best sends a housefull of triflers
laughing to their Tieds.
Boswell [pensively). I have read much in ancient and modern history,
and have ever found that a man is unconscious of his real strength.
Dr. Johnson. Have you found, Sir, either in your vaunted and multi-
farious reading, or in your own nature, that a man is conscious of his
real weakness?
Boswell. That is a most profound question, Sir, and I am pleased with
myself for having been the means of inducing Dr. Johnson to state it.
Garrick. "A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear."
Dr. Johnson. Name the play, Sir, from which that line is taken.
Garrick. I am not sure that I can, Sir.
Dr. Johnson. And I am sure that you cannot, Sir. Yon players live
on the scraps from Shakspeasb's plates, but know nothing of the dishes
whence your morsels come. You are silent, Doctob GoLDSMrrH. If I
have grieved you, you injure me, for you forget how dearly I prize your
reputation.
Goldsmith. It would be much. Dr. Johnson, that I could not take
from you. But I insist on my right to be pleased that my merry play
is again before the town.
Dr. Johnson. Well, well, Sir, be pleased, and we will rejoice with you.
I undervalue no attempt to promote the harmless gaiety of many.
Boswell. I know, Dr. Johnson,'that you read Punch with pleasure.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, you know nothing about it. Punch, though I
could wish that he had called himself the Reforming Philosopher, or by
some more dignified name than one from the streets, is no mere jester,
but one who avails himself of his unequalled wit to point his admirable
morals. I regard Punch as the greatest teacher the world has possessed
since the year 1784.
Boswell. When you came here, Sir.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, you know nothing about it, or what were my move-
ments until your own arrival in 1785.
Goldsmith. Doctor, when you descend to such commonplace argu-
ments as dates, to confound an opponent, you must give me leave to
say. He Stoops to Conquer.
Dr. Johnson. Tis well said, Doctor (laughing).
Goldsmith. I have more to say, Sir, and now I may indeed hope to
interest Db. Johnson, who ever loved a brave man. My play has been
set by a gentleman named Macparren, who suffers under the deprivation
of sight, and who nevertheless labours vigorously at his art, aided by a
husband's best friend, and who has on this occasion, discoursed most
eloquent music.
Dr. Johnson. 'Tis" like your countrymen. Dr. Goldsmith, always to
begin at the wrong end of a story. Had you said thus much at the
commencement of your narration I had received it more respectfully.
Sir, the sympathy due to the gentleman's misfortune equals the honour
he should claim for dominating it. But there sounds Queen Proser-
pine's dinner belL We will drink a particular bumper of nectar to the
lortunes of Momus, now under the tuition of Caucus Apollo.
Boswell. What a tasteful and classical allusion to the musical setting
of our friend Oliver's play!
Dr. Johnson. Sir, you are a fool. [Exeunt.

Cos in Leap yeer tis the custim, as most heverybody nose,
For the gals to pop the question, hor in other turns propose.
And pawsibly if you ad popped, a nice gal has U R,
I might ave blushed, hand ung my ed, and whispered "Hask PapaR!"
But lor! theer aint no Sperrit in young ladies nowadays,
Like one reads in hold Romances hor in Mister Sheeltspur's plays:
Which as E's the greatest Poet as the Wurld ave ever Scene,
E's to ave a Ter Scent Tennery— hi Carat say what it mean,
But I ope it aint a Statty, cos we someow doesnt shine
At playink games o' Marbles in the monnymental line.
Which there's quite enough redicklus in our phamed Treffolger square,
Without avink poor dear Shakespeer to be larfed at stuck up there;
And I ardly think the Poet would be in his right location,
To be standink by the Docter as hinwented Waxination.
Nor wood it be agreeble to the littry world at lorge
To C their Sheekspue stuck up near the Pigtail of King Jorge!
But halthough as Mister Pope says in his phine and phlowink
rhymes
Hour Sheekspur were a poet as have "written for the Times," *
We've other things to talk about now Parlymink ave met,
Than the Sheekspur Ter Scent tennary and wheer it's to be set.
Fust of all there's Shcleszigolstine, a most hawfle word to say,
And to pernounce it prawperly I don't quite no the way,
Hand as for hunderstandink what the row there is about
I'd as soon Xpeck a English cook to underst& sour krout;
Wliich its a Germing hontray as doubtless youre awecr,
And is made of rotten cabbiages kep pickled in sour beer.
But Polly Tix of coarse aint 4 as intrestiiik to gurls
As earring if you ought to wear your air in plats or curls,
Though I'm told its now more phashnabble to ave it in big Bows,
And if gals aint enough to tie they buy some I suppose,
(Which Jane dear IThave often eard me praise your Ed of Air,
So I dont mean nothink pussnal now, I reelly do declare.)
But lor! there's nothink nattral in young ladies nowadays.
And Pliine Phiggers as theyre called is only Crinnylean and Stays,
While as for phine complecshins, they 're all pearlpowder and Paint,
Which if Gals is fond of kissink it I no a Man as aint!
But the most himportant subjic as is talked about this year,
Its about Dumb estic Suvvnts and their carricters my dear
For it seems as A young lady were got lately in disgrace
By forjink a Karackter for a Ousemaid out of plaice,
And in course the Wuthy Majjis Strait to oom the case were brort
Gave her a preshus Wiggink in the earring of the Court.
But phokes is too pertickler for the wages as they give,
And Deink Mortal creeturs y poor suvnts they must Live!
* Mb. John Thomas slightly misquotes the passage:—
11 He wrote not for an age, but for all time."
Printer'! Devil
Hand though a cook may ave a weekness for her freinds in the Purleece,
Hor may sell a few Wax candles with her drippink and her Greece,
And though ladiesmaids may wear their missus' wardrobe on their bax,
I think as their karackters needent menshing them there Fax.—
Of course in Suvvnts dickshonairies Puckwisits means Pelf,
But I ses as ow each missus ought to find that out erself,
Hand if a gent be wicktimised, and tuns away his cook,
Ow can it siggafy to Im whom else she tries to rook?
I'd say more on this matter deer in these here present rhymes,
But missis' bell ave rung for me some \ a dozen times,
Hand though it aint my custim for to harnser in a Nurry,
Hit wont Do to haggriwate er, hor she flies out in a Phi urry.
But ladies is hunreasnable to folks in their employ.
They wants a Man to move about as Vt E were a boy,
I Which I says my Carves won't stand it, for they 're onnest flesh and

i Hif they was hartifishil ones it might be oped they wood.
And then they calls one Lazy hif one's Careful of one's figger,

But lor! till I gits Married dear there's little opes of that.

And what with Halpine climbing up them hawful steeps of stairs
My legs is nearly wore away to drumstix, I declares.
In fack there aint a horficer in Harmy or in Navy,
Who's more on Hactive Suwice than

THE ATHENJEUM ON THE .EARLY CHRISTIANS.
Mr. Punch,—Please Sir, the Atheneeum says, in a review of (Lobj>
Robert Montague's Four Experiments in Church and State:—
"The author also asserts that 'the Pagans never persecuted one another,' which
assertion would be still harder to prove, for there certainly was a time when he
who would not bow to the supreme Jove, or fling a pinch of incense on the altar
of the Emperor, was thrown to the lions, to the torturers, or the flames."
"Christians ad leones.'" When the Roman mob cried out that,
and those who refused to sacrifice to Jupiter or Cesar were served
accordingly, does the Alhenaum mean to say that the Pagans persecuted
one another? That seems a strange saying for a paper so very par-
ticular about correctness as the Athetueum.
I remain, Sir,
Your affectionate young friend,
Hogsnorton Grammar School, First Form, Edwards, Jb,
Valentine's Day, 1864.
Please, Sir, of course it is impossible that the critic in the Athetueum
did not understand his author's meaning.
AUSTRIAN BARBARISM.
In the Austrian part of the band of robbers engaged in the spoliation
of Denmark, there is a particular gang called the Gondrecourt Brigade,
the head of it being a General of that name. An eye-witness of the
atrocities which these brigands have been perpetrating, states that:—
11 Wherever General Qondeooprt was seen, he was greeted with loud cheers by
the troops. The guns they brought back with them were gaily decorated in honour
of the patron saint of tho artillery, the Holy Barbara."
St. Barbara, of all Saints, must be allowed to be the fittest patroness
of barbarian ordnance. But what sort of a Saint is this "Holy
Barbara" who patronises the murderous instruments of Austrian bar-
barity? If there are two kinds of Angels, the celestial and the fallen,
there may also be two corresponding classes of Saints, and "Holy
Barbara may be one of class number Two. We know, thanks to Mr.
Mllton, who it was that first invented gunpowder and artillery; and
it is reasonable to sunpose that a Saint who presides over such things,
especially in the interest of Austrian felony, should be one of a sul-
phureous description. The Holy Barbara, who stands in the relation
of a Zamiel to the Hapsburgh great guns, may be taken to be holy, as
wc say, over the left; holy so to speak, with a hook. She cannot be
conceived to rank among the Saints in the Calendar; can only be
regarded as a Saint whom miscreants have cannonised.
Honest" Germans.
The German Powers contend that in declaring that they recognised
the integrity of the Danish monarchy, they did not engage to respect
it. Just so the recognition of a gentleman's watch and seals does not
prevent footpads from garotting him and stealing them.

THEATRICAL REALITIES.

[ ub Sensational Managers of
the present day are deter-
mined to leave nothing to
imagination. Your Con-
tributor's Drama was en-
titled Rudolpho the Rugged,

indeed would not if any one
had said it for him) that
the title is an admirable
one, and not less worthy of
praise is the work itself. It
will not now be. produced,
owing to a slight disagree-
ment between the Lessee
and myself, as to the intro-
duction of an aria for the
chief lady in the most thrill-
ing situation; I allude to
that part where Rudolpho
the Rugged, who is really
Timothy, the ninth Pon-
tiff of that name, in dis-
guise, is about to jump
from the top of the cliff
6,000 feet above the level
of the sea, upon the head of Mabel his adopted daughter, with a view
of putting a simultaneous end to the existence of both of 'em. Well,
Sir,—no matter. I will tell you how my Piece was to have been pro-
duced. In the respect of " getting up," I have no fault to find with
the liberality of the Manager. I blame him for being weak and yielding
to the airs and whims of tyrannical little singing Ladies; quos ego—
but, as I observed before, no matter.
Adieu for ever to the old plan of shaking a carpet when you would
represent the rolling sea. Farewell the profile boat and the canvas
cottage by the sea. Adieu, Imaginative Dramatic Genius, whoever you
may Be, and Welcome, Practical Carpenter.
My First Scene was "A Castle with view of Sea."
"What sea?" said the Manager.
I was not prepared for this, but readily and wittily replied, "The See
of Canterbury."
"Bring a map," says the Manager, "and'get a guide-book to—to—
to—let me see, he was pretending that he did know but had forgotten,
"let me see—where it Canterbury f"
L had to explain my joke, a miserable performance at any time [I
allude to the explanation, not the witticism], and added that I had had
no particular sea in my eye at the time.
'Margate's near," said the Manager," let us say the"sea at Margate."
"But why Margate?" I inquired.
"Because, don't you see, we can do the real thing, have a lot of it up
in air-tight cases: it '11 keep and will be a hit. Real Sea from The
Coast op England!!! There's a telling advertisement, my boy!"
And real Sea we should have had, as sure as your name's Punch.
The Castle was to have been built after the earliest Norman style of
Real Stone. Eminent architects had already been consulted. The
proposed Bill ran as follows:—
REAL CASTLE AND FORTIFIED RAMPARTS.
Reviewing the Troops: they are heard to ascend the stone staircases, which
for the satis/action of' the Audience, can be distinctly seen through the
Loopholes. Besiegers approach in Real Boats, armed with Real
Guns loaded with Powder and Ball.
N.B. Incompliance with theLoBD Chamberlain's expressed wishes,
the Manager warns all employed in his service against getting in the
way of the bullets, on pain of being heavily fined; and after this suf-
ficient warning, he begs to state that he will not hold himself in the least
responsible for any consequences whatsoever.
Scene 2.—The Point of the Junction between the North and South Coast
Railway Lines. Real Engines and Trains travelling at the rate of
forty miles an hour. Appalling Accident!
N.B. The Manager repeats a caution, similar to the one above, as to
supernumeraries who play the parts of Passengers in the different
carriages. They really must take care of themselves.
Well, Mr. Punch, then we were to have had a Room Scene, with real
ceiling, real glass which Rudolpho breaks in jumping'through the win-
dow, a real fire with coals and smoke—a comic scene here about the
smoke—and in fact everything real on the Stage with the exception of
one thing which I, as a Dramatic Author, would prefer to all the Carpen-
tering, Masonry, and Upholstery in the Metropolis, I allude, Sir, to
Reallt Good Acting! i
THE MASQUE OF PARIS.
No wonder masquing now enlists
The Imperial circle's passion;
Courtiers can but be copyists,
When crowned heads set the fashion; I
AIL from the Tuileries place-man to
The Tuileries pleasure-hunter,
Recast the cry Beati qui
In Domino moriuntur 7"
To "Ter-beati Domino
Fiventes quifruuntur!"
To dance and die in domino
Are two forms of beatitude:
But there's a third, which Emperors know,
To change masks with your attitude!
To wear a face that smiles with grace
On the bewitched beholder,
But as he turns, the guest discerns,
How the warm smile grows colder,
Till it dies down to stony frown.
When read o'er t'other shoulder.
The ladies of the Imperial Court,
Love their costumes to vary;
Now wantoning in skirts full short,
Now of their charms more chary:
One as a snow-storm* breathes cold East,
Then beams as summer weather: *
One flits a bat* then soars released
To gauze from wings of leather!
Bright-plumaged birds! France finds the feast,
And furnishes the feather!
As patches once with us showed Whig
Or Tory camp's dominion,
So here the masquer loves to rig
The matket of opinion.
Here, on a blonde venetia's* arm,
Hungary* shows her fetters;
There, Poland* strives in vain to alarm
Her diplomatic debtors;
While yon fair Mexicaine* might charm
Juarez t and his abettors.
And in and out the brilliant show,
Through diamonds' rain-bow blaze,
Through silken sheen, and golden glow,
And lace's woven haze,
Through shifting masks, the times that mock,
Or hint at change en fair,
Through brazen beauties, proud to stock
The Imperial Parc-aux-cerft,
Through Diplomates no kick can shock,
Best masked wil h faces bare—
Through starred chevaliers d'industrie,
(Bourse mushrooms of a day)
Through ribboned rooks and croupier dukes—
(For " L'Empire e'est lapaye"),—
Threading the crowd, in sable shroud
Of domino and mask,
The sphinx you mark, whose riddle dark
None read though all must ask—
The hand that moves, on his behooves,
These puppets to their task.
He shifts not mask and domino—
No change of garb he needs,
Whose life is ene great masquing show,
Of causes, cries, and creeds.
From bonnet-rouge to black soutane,
From Louis Blanc to Cobden,
Coats he has worn of all men's yarn,
All glasses hob-and-nobbed in,
All mills' grist garnered in his barn,
All troubled waters bobbed in!
Masfjue a la barbe! Yes 'twas the garb
That old highwaymen robbed in!
* Costumes at recent Imperial masked balls,
t Pronounce as a dissyllable, Hwares.
New Danish Oath.—" Dash my Schles-wig!"

BOKES IN FROST.
Dear Mr. Punch,
During the late .frost (so says a paragraph which has been
"making the round of the Journals ") wild-boars have appeared in
great numbers in different country places of France, and hunting-clubs
nave been established for the destruction of these troublesome animals.
In our great frosts ice suffer from the same infliction, only we spell
the word a little differently, and our frost-bound bores don't confine their
ravages to the fields, but actually force their way into the ladies' sanc-
tum sanctorum. Oh, Mr. Punch, if you only could have seen the damage
done, and the confusion caused by the bores in our county drawing-
rooms and boudoirs, during the hard frost which has lately put a stop to
hunting. The poor creatures may be tame enough generally; but the
frost makes them quite as wild in this country, as they can be in
Alsatia or anywhere else. I see the French have the same plan of
protecting themselves against this plague as we have,—I mean by
hunting-clubs. If it wasn't for our hunting-clubs, whenever hard frost
sets in, we should be fairly worried out of our houses by the bores in our
part of Blankshire. It is dreadful, when a nice little party of us girls
have got together for a little quiet crochet, or to talk over the last ball,
or the next charade-party, or one's mutual friends, or one's flirtatious,
or the last box of novels from Mudie's, to be suddenly scared by a rush
of huge hairy bores, white-toothed, long-whiskered, driven in-doors by
the hard weather, upsetting one's chairs, tangling one's wools, tumbling
over the ottomans, and making themselves generally disagreeable.
Some girls may say they like the sport of hunting them, or trapping
them, or even taming them; but any girl of spirit ought to be
ashamed of tackling the poor creatures at such times, out of con-
dition and cowed as they arc. I like to face my bore on equal terms:
to bring him down fairly, with a dead shot in the heart, after giving him
proper law, and all the sportswoman-like advantages of ground and
weather. I wouldn't give the flirt of u fan for the triumph of potting"
a poor depressed, half-starved, timid bore, driven by the frost from the
cover-side to the warmth and shclter'bf the boudoir or the billiard-room.
I hope you agree with me, Mr. Punch, and that you will recommend
all girls in country-houses to be merciful to the unhappy bores who may
seek refuge from the frost under the shadow of our crinolines.
Your constant reader,
Jeanle Brightwtjc.

A BADGE OF BRAVERY.
An Order by General Wrangel, premising
that, as fifty years ago Austria and Prussia, when
engaged in the same struggle, wore the same
badge, so now " when fortune, which cannot be
sufficiently praised, leads them again shoulder to
shoulder into battle, they are to adopt the same
symbol as of old." This symbol, we 'are told
by the telegram which transmitted the foregoing
flourish, "consists of a white band round the left
arm." General Wrangel may consider this
symbol to denote his allied troops to be a band
of brothers; but in the sight of English eyes it
represents a brotherhood of bandits. The Aus-
tnans and Prussians may recognise no other
common symbol than the white band round the
left arm of one another, but to our imagination
they all appear conspicuously marked between
the shoulders with a broad R. The drums and
fifes should play such marauders into dishonest
action with the Rogues' March.
William Cobbf.tt, illustrating the baseness of
certain bullies, applies to them the following
popular couplet:—
Father and Mother and I, with ft chosen hand,
Beat a poor Uttio hoy till ho couldn't go nor stand."
The Germans, small and great, in attacking
Denmark, are attempting an exploit just like that
described in the above lines; and the chosen
band therein mentioned exactly corresponds to
the Austrian and Prussian heroes who, with white
bands round their left arms, are marching
shoulder to shoulder against that little kingdom.
They might as well also wear white feathers in
their caps. It is to be wished that to the white
bands round their left arms might speedily be
added handcuffs at the wrists.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
February 15, Monday. Earl Russell was anxious to explain that
he had not been frightened, by Mr. Seward's menaces, into stopping
the Rams, also that Mr. Seward had sent no menaces at all. The fact
is that the American Minister over there knows the delight his country-
men take in tall talk, so he manufactures thundering despatches which
get into the Yankee press, and which he also transmits to the American
Minister over here. Mr. Adams is a gentleman, who dines with Lobd
Russell, and, after dinner, says, in an off-hand way, "I've got another
of Willy Seward's concoctions, my dear Lord; but of course I shan't
give it you—thanks, no, the claret." If this sort of tiling pleases the
great, enlightened, and dignified people of America, it would be very
churlish in us to find fault with it.
Lord Campbell, not considering the Schleswig-Holstein complica-
tion sufficiently labyrinthine, has §one back into history, and insists
that we are bound by a guarantee given in 1720. The appeal went to
the heart of the historical Foreign Secretary, who thirsted to enter
into the story of the Quadruple Alliance, the South Sea Bubble, the
exile of Atterbury, and other interesting events in the reign of Geor-
gius Primus, but restrained himself, and Degged leave to be mysterious
as to what .we should do if Schleswig were handed to the Duke of
AugiTstenburg. His Lordship hinted, however, that it would be
something truly awful.
Mr. Layard said that the English proposals for an armistice between
Denmark and the Germans had received an unsatisfactory answer.
Another rebuff. Really the mess that Master Johnny Russell makes
with the pens and inkstand is quite trying, and Mrs. Britannia will
be taking them away from him m a passion one of these days.
Tuesday. The Chancellor has sold the Little Livings to the number
of seventy, and at the handsome figure of £65,300. The principle being
thus established, there is nothing to prevent a bishopric or two from
being disposed of at any moment that the Church runs short of money,
or wants tore-arrange her affairs. Why not settle the church-rate
?uestion by selling Sodor and Man, say, to the Independent Anabaptist
chabodies? Earl Russell, attacked by Lord Carnarvon, about
the American cruisers, made a spirited little answer, said that we had
never consented to be responsible for the piracies of the Alabama, but
that it was a scandal and a reproach to our law that she had been able
to go from an English port. We have seized the Confederate vessel
Tuscaloosa, and meant to keep her till reclaimed by the Federal owner.
If the Richmond paper does not flame out at this, it will be because
Mitchell has no vitriol left.
A Bill for a new Brighton railwav was smashed. A Bill described
by Mr. Buchanan as intended to throw all the traffic between the east
and west of Scotland into the ;hands of one Company, was smashed.
This may have been right, but we beg to remark that the stations on the
Edinburgh and Glasgow line are execrable. Some other provincial Rail-
way Bills made progress, and then the whole night was devoted to a
discussion on the Private Bill System, which is admitted to be incon-
venient, unfair, and expensive. But the House is so averse to giving
up a morsel of its authority, that it will not consent to establish a
rational tribunal for examining Private Bills in a rational manner, i Mr.
Milner Gibson proposed some palliative resolutions, but they remind
one of the suggestion to bolt a door with a boiled carrot.
Wednesday. This, which used to be the Parliamentary Sunday, or at
least the day on which theological matters were discussed, is to be secu-
larised this Session, as the Dissenters announce an armistice. They state
that their exertions are, for the present, to undergo Depoliticalisation.
That is a stunning good word, and as the sailor, handing the bass viol
over the side, and fancying that the instrument was performed upon kit
fashion, expressed a lively curiosity to see "the big beggar as played on
this here, we should like to sec the Nonconformist gentleman who,
single-handed, launched that word into circulation. To-day the question
of county rating came up, and Mr. Villiers 'promised that Govern-
ment should attend to it. John Huggins, of the Epping Hunt, ought
to be examined as a witness, having given attention to the subject, for
when run away with he stated that
"He never saw a County go
At such a County ruto."
Thursday. Earl Granville said that the Government was considering
how to improve the Patent Museum and Library. One good way would
be to prevent its further increase by abolishing the Patent System
altogether, a recommendation in which Mr. Punch heartily agrees with
Mr. Bright.
We do not know what the Clerks of the Peace have been doing, but
the Lords seem anxious to devise a means for the more easy removal of
those officials. In the event of strife, could they not all be turned over
to Earl de Grey, and made Clerks of the War?
Brighton is notoriously a Liberal borough, and could easily have
returned a Liberal Member, and a very good one indeed, Mr. Henry
Fawcett, but for the illiberality of his rivals, of similar politics. Two
would go to the poll, one of them, Mr. Julian Goldsmid, polling to
the end, and as the Conservatives committed no such folly, Mr. Moor,
with 1663 votes, defeated the 2489 Liberals who scattered their support,

and he took his seat to-night, introduced by Mr. White, his Radical
colleague. So Brighton has no voice in legislation, or, rather, (as a
Moor is usually black) may be frivolously said to vote Black and
White.
Me. Layard, who in the Japan debate, had spoken slightingly of the
evidence afforded by a picture of the conflagration of Kagosima, made
gentlemanly amends to our contemporary, the Illustrated London News,
which has an artist in Japan, another in Schleswig, and a third in
Richmond (Disunited States), sill sketching away with the most valiant
disregard of danger.
The mortality among pauper children in Ireland is said to be greatly
and needlessly in excess, and Government introduces a Bill, generally
approved by the Irish Members, for dealing with the evil, avowedly in
the case of Dublin, but the measure will have a more extended action.
Then came up a debate in the interest of our friend the Penal Servitor.
Sir George Grey brought in a Bill, by which it is proposed to enact
that Five Years shall be the shortest term for penal servitude, instead
of Three, as now; but that by a system of "marks" to be given for
good conduct, a criminal may reduce that term by one-fourth. Trans-
portation b not abolished, because it is stated that Western Australia
at present desires to receive the 500 or 600 convicts whom we annually
remit thither. The "marks" system has worked well in Ireland, it
appears. There, the convict, if released before the expiry of his term,
is under the surveillance of the police, so that he may be claimed back
if not reclaimed, a rational precaution, of which Sir G. Grey seems
afraid. The "ticket-of leave ' system is to be unaltered (Sir George
repudiates the phrase, and calls the document a Licence), but if the
ticket-man commits a breach of licence, he is to be returned to. prison
to serve out the whole sentence, beginning back from the day he came
out. The Bill is also to empower local Magistrates to authorise the
instant Flogging of convicts who revolt in prison. Sir George exerted
himself to impress the House that it was a mistake to believe that men
obtained remissions of sentence by " coming over " t he chaplain. Any-
how, the criminal class itself believes this. There was a temperate
discussion on the measure.
Mr. William Ewart brought in a Permissive Bill in favour of the
Metric System. We doubt the utility of such a measure. Who would
learn how to do a sum if the master were not behind him, and ready to
make it indisputablv clear that he occupied that position of advantage?
Suppose, by way of a gentle experiment, we have a decimal coinage,
and enact a Permissive Bill, providing that people who will not be paia
in that coin shall not be paid at all, and if tliey refuse credit, shall .be
transported. We would not be severe, nothing is more unwise, _but a
little firmness is desirable in dealing with the prejudiced, j
Friday. On the motion of the Archbishop op Armagh, certain
returns concerning the Irish Church were ordered. We could not quite
hear what Da. Bbresford said, but are not inclined to think that
among them was a return of any of the money the Irish Church may
have taken for not doing its duty.
Mr. Cowper said that Messrs. Kelk and Lucas had by no means
cleared away the Exhibition building, and the Government had been
making a shine about it, as the site was wanted for a great many build-
ings, in which architects were to be asked to compete. Hadn't the
Pecksniffs better be looking up their pupils' designs, and preparing to
do their own worst.
We are negotiating with nine foreign countries in order to get Rags
cheaper. If costly wars spread, we shall soon find the European popu-
lation reduced to a state which will give us great advantages in this
commerce. Banners a-field means rags at home.
Mr. Newdegate asked Lord Palmkrston what he should do if the
Germans invaded Jutland, which is certainly Denmark Proper. Lord
Palmbrston said that such an entry would be an aggravation of the
violent outrage on justice already committed (loud cheers), and which in-
volved bloodshed for which Austria and Prussia were deeply responsible.
[Renewed cheers.) But he declined saying what Government would do
in a case which had not arisen. The newspapers which reported his
Lordship informed us, also, that the case had arisen. Perhaps by the
time the Germans have got to Skagen Cape, we shall have heard the
intentions of Government. Wc do not want to fight, of course, but an
instant and indignant withdrawal of the British representatives from
every place where German is jabbered, might be ordered, and Germany
might he made to include a visit to Coventry among her peregrinations
in foreign parts.
Criminals in the West Riding of Yorkslure, and their friends' and
enemies, are much excited upon the question where the West Riding
'Sizes are to be held. Sir George Grey, as usual, pursues a
vaccinating policy when asked to point out a spot. But Mr. Punch's
intimate knowledge of the question enables him to say that inasmuch
as there are 'Sizes already in York and Manchester, and as the whole
Riding hates Leeds,' and as Leeds is only an hour and twenty minutes
from York, there is no pretext for listening to the Leeds people, who
want to drag the law into their Avernian smoke, for their own profit
and advantage. If there are to be any new 'Sixes they ought to be held
at Wakefield, which lies convenient for the district concerned, and as the
Yorkshire folk are almost unanimous on the subject, they ought not to
be knocked down with the Census, the pedantic argument of the Leeds
people, and their only one. Sir J. Hay took the sense of the House
on the subject, and in favour of Wakefield, and was defeated by 19 only
in a House of 257, which was a victory, inasmuch as the votes for
Wakefield were substantive, the others being an agglomeration of
Ministers' friends and the like, who merely did as they were bidden.
Mr. Punch expects no end of hams and Yorkshire pies for this lucid and
noble advocacy of the West Riding.
Brother Jonathan having made a fall and handsome apology for the
seizure of a Confederate ship in Pankbar, Nova Scotia, no more need be
said on that subject. Ma. Layaed, liaving given this information,
answered Ma. Ki nglake, who had a Danish grievance,and Mr. Roebuck:
summed up the case by stating that Mh. Kinglake was one of that
nondescript class of politicians who were fond of finding mare's nests.
Gudrdati, ragazzetto! Ma. Kixglake may have a rod in pickle for you,
and he does not lay on the article negligently.
A Committee on the Insane Criminals' Bill finished the evening in
very good time. In fact, the Houses are taking things easily at
present, and they are right to get home early these abominably cold
nights. Snow, too—nix, my Parliamentary pals, must flake away.
SPIRITS IN THE COAL-HOLE.
Guttle reader, prithee how about our coal fields? Didn't
say that they were pretty nigh exhausted? Because, if not, the
are they will be so ere long; for only look at this:—
"Coal Gas B*a»dt—Permission to work * French patent for the mannfactnre
of Brandy from Coal Gas has recently been porch need for * large sua by an Bullish
Company, and the work of manufacture Is on the point of being started in London."
Brandy made from gas! By Bacchus! That's a bright idea! What
news for Mr. Homb and all the other Mediums, to hear that there are
spirits present in the coalscuttle! He would be a bold man, in good
truth, to set alight on his plum pudding, say, to brandy made from
coal-gas. Won't the price of Walbend just go up, after this? Only
fancy what demands there will be shortly for black diamonds, now it is
discovered that brandy can be made from them. No wonder it was
stated that Old King Coal was a merry old soul, seeing what a merry-
making spirit there was latent in him. "Cinnamon and ginger, nutmeg
and cloves," are said to give a nose a rubicund complexion; but only
think what inflammation of the cuticle may be caused by the absorption
of brandy made from coal-gas! Just conceive if Bardolph were living
now-a-days what a nose would his become after a glass or two of gas
brandy! Perhaps in course of time the spirit, like the gas whence it is
made, will be laid along the streets in pipes, and so conveyed into our
houses, and there kept constantly on tap, being measured out by meter.
We fear teetotalism then will have but a poor chance of winning many
converts. Tipsiness will be the rule and temperance the exception,
and we shall hear benignant hosts blandly whispering to their friends,
"I shay—hie—olefler, jush shtopantake—hie—nother glasshogash with
ush," while perhaps some jolly mortal, when he is asked to sing, will
hiccup out a stave like this:—
A bumper of brandy go fill, fill for me,
Far too poor for my palate is wine;
But brandy, if made from good coal gas it be,
Out of other drinks quite takes the shine.
Let the Temperance man try his clar't and champagne,
With weak stomachs such weak stuff may pass,
But a liquor to warm one and light up one's brain,
Is the brandy that's made from coal gas!
A PROFITABLE ENGAGEMENT.
Here is a sorrowful statement:—
"General Wranoel is, wo hear, to receive £300 a month extra pay during the
Danish invasion."
Therefore, General Wrangel is an interested party in the present
abominable struggle. As he is to receive £3,600 a year so long as it
lasts, you may be sure he will be in no great hurry to put a stop to it.
He has clearly a large interest in prolonging hostilities. The high
fiay (the General is evidently not serving in the Pays-Bas) must be
ooked upon as a handsome bonus for harassing the Danes as much as
Etssible, and so long as they will let him. Let us hope that, by the
anes forcing him to retreat, the above pay will be quickly converted
into a retiring pension. As it is, the General is, as lar as we can see,
the only person likely to derive any benefit from the present wicked
"In the Name of the Prophet."
Zadkmel is going to have a new wrapper for his Almanack. It is to
be of a pale gamboge colour: his authority for this is the combination
that is plainly alluded to in the line of Shakspeare's: "The Seer and
yellow leaf."

PANTOMIMIC ATROCITIES IN 1864.
nt, — Pantomimic atrocities
this year are greater than
has ever been known before.
The poor babies have been
principally J he sufferers. As
many as 2,753 have fallen
victims to the severity of
the season since last Boxing-
night. Two perish nightly
at Drury Lane Theatre.
Their cries before receiving
the last spoonful of pap have
generally been of the most
heart-rending description—
so much so, as to have made
the heart of Mr. Malthtjs
out-Herod Herod himself
in leaping with joy, if he
, could only have heard them.
This "murder of the inno-
cents," far from being visited
with shouts of indignation,
is hailed every evening with
the most joyous peals of
laughter, more especially by
the female portion of the
theatrical community. No
measures have yet been taken
to put a stop to this fearful increase of pantomimic infanticide, though we cannot help
thinking it must tend eventually to harden the hearts of the spectators. Not even a single
inquest has been held upon their mangled bodies; in fact, the only persons who have sat upon
them have been the Clown and Pantaloon, who have taken the most malicious delight in falling

upon them one after another, with all their
might. An elderly gcntlfnan has been blown
nightly from a gun. It is not known what par-
ticular offence he has committed, but he has been
thrust into the mouth of the gaping Armstrong,
without so much as his name or address being
asked, and in an instant stuck against all parts
of the building.
Four dozen charity boys have been forced into
cisterns, and, the lid being instantly put on, have
never appeared on the surface again. Police-
men, too, have been the favourite objects of ill-
treatment. They have been subjected to every
form of indignity; been cuffed, pelted, kicked,
bonnetted—but, all things considered, have borne
it with considerable good humour. Every kind
of practical joke has been practised upon them,
and amongst others that of throwing them into a
hot caiddron, apparently for no other purpose
than that of changing their colour from blue to
red. This, we are credibly informed, is only a
playful allusion to the crustacean tribe to which
they are popularly supposed to belong. No
deaths have fortunately resulted from this culinary
practice, but still the inhumanity of the pro-
ceeding cannot be too loudly condemned.
The red-hot poker, also, has this year been
most freely used, but we have not heard of any
fatal cases that have occurred from the liberal
application of it. Beyond making the patient
jump and howl a little, it does not seem to inflict
much injury. However, the Legislature should
look to it. I remain, yours respectfully,
A SoET-HEARTED PHILANTHROPIST.
CHILDRENfAND THEIR TORMENTORS.
Were we to illustrate a fairy tale, and wished to draw an ogre, we
should like to see a photograph of the writer of the following:—
BOARDING SCHOOLS WANTED, in London, for a boy, nine years,
and two girls, six and seven years old, requiring firm discipline, having become
wild and unruly, through, neglect occasioned by family misfortunes. No holiday
couJd be given, as holidays destroy any good effected at school. The father, quite
a gentleman, can only pay 20 guineas oach. This advertisement is only intended
for schools of pre-eminent efficiency for such cases, and prosperous enough to be
able and willing to accept such terms, and undertake the needed task of reformation
for the sake of the schools' own additional credit of success. Particulars and refe-
rences, by letter only.
Opinions doubtless differ as to what is meant by the' expression
"quite a gentleman," and possibly there may be people in the world
who may think the term applied without a shadow of unfitness to a
man who wants to send his children away out of his sight, and to get
them lodged and boarded, and supplied with needful schooling, at the
cost in a great measure ot the persons who receive them. As for his
pretending that he disapproves of holidays on the ground of their des-
troying the good effects of school, that pretence is so transparent that
half an eye may see through it. Of course his true objection is that,
were his children allowed holidays, they would have to live in them at
his expense: and besides, as he has evidently no love for his children,
he no doubt dislikes occasions that bring them to his sight. As for its
conducing to the "credit" of a school to help unnaturaffathers thus to
get rid of their children, surely no one but a Squeers could indulge in
such a thought. If through neglect at home, a child becomes unruly
and requires to be " reformed," it is right that at a proper age it should
be sent to school, if proper means are wanting for teaching it at home.
But a girl six years old can scarcely be so "wild " as to require, for her
taming, utter banishment from home: nor can she be much bettered by
being badly fed for twenty pounds a year, and, worse still, taught tb
grow up without knowing what " home" means.
i" OH DHAR! WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE?"
Is there anybody in the House of Commons who is fond of asking
riddles, and knows anything about India? If so, will he kindly ask
the Government this conundrum, which Mr. Punch has just received
from one who gives his real name and signs himself " a Pensioner:"—
"Qwttion. In order to keep self and three more from grinding want, what
description, quantity, Ac, of mechanimn is necessary to be employed to compel the
Immediate distribution of the Dhar Prise Money, seeing it was disbursed to the
troops scrviDg in India during the month of April, 1863?
The mechanism which impelled the long-delayed distribution of the
Delhi Prize Money was set in motion by a thump or two from Mr.
Punch's cudgel, and this same motive power is ever kept in readiness
to be similarly used. Of course our Military Swells are not the sort of
people to be bothered about prize money and trifles of that sort, while
any more important work is on their hands: but now that they have
done the iob of clearing Colonel Crawley, perhaps they may find
leisure in the course of the next year or so to give five minutes' thought
to the other Indian matter whicn is referred to them above.
A JOKE FROM THE COMMISSIONERS IN LUNACY.
A Sense of justice compels us to publish the following jocose, but
genuine epistle:—
"Office of Commitnoneri in lunacy, 19, Whitehall Place, S.W., Feb. 16, 1S64.
"Sir,—In reference to a statement in a notico on the Isle of Man Lunatics, con-
tained in the number of Pvnch for Siiturday next, I have the honour to state that
it was on the lltk of November, 1861. that the attention of the Secretary of State
was called by The Commissioners in Lunacy, to the inadequacy of the provision
made for these lunatics, and the necessity of making some immediato and tem-
porary arrangement in regard to them.
"The fact is adverted to in the 71st pago of the 16th Report of the Commissioners
in Lunacy, laid before Parliament in the month of July, 1862.
"I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
"The Editor of Punch." "W. C. Spring Rice."
For the publication of the foregoing letter, we owe some apology to
Sir George Grey, because ils essential point, namely, the statement
that the attention of the Secretary of State was called on the 11th of
November, 1861, to the condition of Lunatics in the Isle of Man, which
has remained the same as it was then till now in 1864, appears to be a
joke at the Home Secretary's expense.
FAWCETT AND BRIGHTON.
Clear head, sharp tongue, devoid of whim,
A slave to neither cant nor passion:
If all blind folk resembled him,
We could wish blindness were the fashion.
No, he's not blind. But Brighton is,
And it's no use for her to cry out,
Disfranchised—while true Liberals hiss—
"See, there goes Brighton with her eye out.'
To-morrow
Is in legal phraseology, a Dies n<m, for are we not being continually
told that To-morrow never comes? By the bye, the name of the Coming
Man must be To-morrow, which fully accounts for that tardy gentleman
never making his appearance. Perhaps, unused, as he must be, to the
ways of this world, he has incautiously taken his ticket on the Great
Eastern Railway?

"SPOKEN BY A DANCER."
My dear Me. Punch,
I Wish to address you a few words on a subnet which as
come before the notice of the public a good deal lately. Our Mananger
says how it is cheefly the underclothing of us Ladies of the ballet as
catch fire, and if we won't make them secuer from fire, He cannot help
it. But we all say the Mananger can help it; as, If it is cheefly the
under-clothing as catch fire, and not the Dress which the Mananger
pays for himsetf, why dosent He give us petticoats secuer from fire?
A Mananger says that we won't attend-to these things ourselves, He can
not help it. The public will say "stupid Girls, it is their own fault;"
but, my dear, they docnt quite understand it. Now, I want to tell the
public, that, we Ladies of the ballet, those of them which are in the front
Line (which I must explane is neerest the orchestrar) get about 15
| we will not spend another %s. 9d. out of our salary. That is why we do
not get that stuff, for we would rather stand the chance of burning, than
the sertenty of not being able to live, if we spend our salary on secuering
our clothes from fire. But they want us to dip our book-muslin petti-
coats in Tunget of Soder, I think is the name, when we wash them.

as I was saying, out of 15 shillings a week, a Lady of the ballet has in the
first to bye tints, fleshing Body and shoes. The best tights cost more
than | £2 odd, and so, very few of us can get them; out pink silk
stockings sown on to eotton tops of whitey-brown thread come to less,
and look as well from the front; but even on the best, you can not
depend on.them, as, unless you know how to mend them, and very few
of the new ones do, they are almost useless to a. lady who considers
her position when they nave once gone in ladders.
"r Ton may not know what ladders is, but it is when the silk goes any-
where and then splits downwards, leaving little threads of silk like the
steps of a ladder. Those which know no better darn the ladders, but
where there's one there may be half-a-dozen of them, and then the tights
wouldlbe darned all over, and the Mananger would complane of the look
of the thing, though he dosent find them himself, and it the lady dosent
get a new pair to please him, she may be pretty suer of not getting
engaged at Aw theatre again, and she couldn't go down to another in
the western! with untidey things like that. So that is another expense.
Of course when I say that us ladies cannot get the best tights, shoes,
and fleshings, I do not mean that Miss Langham and Miss De Veke
could not, who are in the front line. But we call them the Barroness,
that "is Miss L.. and the Countess, that is little De Verb, and they
come to rehersal in white crape or Paisley's shawls which cost ten or
twelve guinees a-peace, dressed up to the nines as we say, and they can
afford tights and fleshings all silk and everything else, though they were j
the greatest scrubs at one time, and only do get the same as us now, 15j.
a-week; but they are exseptions, and are fetched away in broghums
with corronettes or cockades, and if they doent receive no salary at
all they would not care.
Well, the shoes comes next. Pink satin shoes is about 5*. 6d. a pare,
dare say there will come One Day, when you will not be sorry for having
said a good word for
Tours, Sir, respecfully,
A Ladt of the Ballet.
SERIOUS FIGHTING OR NONE.
Mt Christian friends, I trust it is our firm determii
Never to go to war on sentimental provocation;
But meekly to endure all taunts, and insults, and offences,
Which break no bones, no money cost, or less than war'» expenses.
And if we arc compelled to fight by some act of hostility 1
More grievous than a trial of our patience and humility,
Since fight we must, I do hope we shall fight determined, steadily,
Peace to restore that they who broke shall not again break readily.
Vengeance, my friends, we couldn't think of taking, as professors,
But execution we may do, to terrify aggressors;
Forced to wage war, oh! let us, then, wage it as if we meant it:
Not evil to return, but make our enemies repent it.

DUPIN AND HIS DUPES.
Our esteemed friend M. Dupin has lately been
making a speech about the Suez Canal, and has been
good enough to say, according to the authorised
report in the Debals:—
"Bo far M England is concerned, it is true that she has often
attempted, through her envious and nagging diplomacy, to
hinder your undertaking, and put a stop to your works. Bat
England, who for so many years frightened all the world.
England now appears frightened at everything; (repealed
applauM). It may, therefore, be permitted to hope that she
will not go to war about the Suez Canal, and that she will
consolo herself with the reflection that whilst it emriches
other nations, none will derive more advantage from it than
herself."
We venture, with all respect, to reply to M.
Dupin, much in the way that his even more illus-
trious countryman, M. Cuvier, replied to the Acade-
micians, when they were " correcting " the dictionary.
"O, M. Cuvier," they said, as he entered one day,
"we have just dismissed a definition which will have
interest for you. We have settled the meaning of
the word Crab." "I shall be enchanted to hear
your definition, gentlemen." "This is it—Crab, a
red fish that goes oackwards." "Admirable, gentle-
men. Indeed, with the slight deduction that a crab
is not red, is not a fish, and does not walk backwards,
your definition is absolutely perfect." So, dear M. |
Dupin, we may observe that England is not envious,
never desired to frighten all the world, and is now
not in the least frightened—unless it be lest orators
of the candour and amiability of M. Dupin should
work Frenchmen into a false belief as to her power 1
when really in earnest, a belief which might lead
those worthy persons into conduct that would pro-
bably result in disasters to themselves. With that
slight deduction, M. Dlpin's statement is absolutely
unimpeachable.
Sacrifice to Snakspeare.
It is suggested that the work of Art in honour of
Shakspeare should be a Monumental Brass, and
that the most active and conspicuous gentleman
of the Commemoration Committee should furnish the
material.
HEMP FOR HEMP.
Mr. Punch",
Although a reasonably sober people, we are accounted by
some friends even, Quakers ana others, to be chargeable with a drop
too much. That drop is one which neither cheers nor inebriates; but
kills. Though not an infinitesimal drop, it is a homoeopathic remedy
for murder, exhibited on the principle that "like cures like." It is
questioned whether the end in view might not be as effectually achieved
by other means. Can we do nothing better than hang for murder to
prevent murder?
Well; we might break murderers on the wheel; and if the fear of
being hanged deters any number of persons from the commission of
murder, it is probable that the fear of Deing broken on the wheel would
deter more. Certainly it is better that murderers should die in torture
than that innocent persons should be murdered. Hanging is attended
with some pain as it is. A writer in the Morning Post recommends
that torture by whipping should be added to capital punishment for
murder. And why not, if the addition of whipping to hanging is likely
still further to diminish that number of murders which they are limited
to by simple hanging?
On the other nand, if any punishment, short of death-punishment,
would be as good a preventive of murder as that, I suppose everybody
would consider it preferable, except those who take a delight in the
spectacle, or the conception, of a man hanging, and arc glad to get a
legal excuse for hanging one occasionally.
In the meantime, Mr. Punch, let me call your attention to certain facts
relative to the gallows not perhaps generally considered. The firstof these
is the fact, that, practically, we do not in reality hang for the crime of mur-
der—we hang only for the accident of success in the attempt to murder.
Suppose, Sir, a ruffian takes a bludgeon and smashes your beautiful
nose, knocks out one of your fine eyes, Deats all your pearly front teeth
down your throat, and fractures your skull, intending to kill you.
Should you survive these injuries, this wretch who has ruined you for
life, escapes with penal servitude. If you happen to die he is hanged.
Why? Not for his fault, but, as far as your mere death goes, for his
misfortune. But, some foreigner will ask, Is this law? Ay, marry,
is't; British criminal law as administered.
Take the case of a miscreant who throttles you or breaks your head
in order to get possession of your watch and chain: a garotter. tf he
happens to kill you, he is liable to be hanged: otherwise not, how much
soever he may injure you. But a garotter, who crushes your windpipe
or batters in your temples, though he may not positively intend to
murder you, doesn't know that he will not, and cares not if he does.
Don't you think now, Sir, that the same secondary punishment as that
which would answer the purpose of putting a stop to garotte robberies
with murder as a possible result, would be as effectual for the prevention
of premeditated murder? Because, if it would, then let me invite you
to consider this other fact, namely, that the efficacy of a certain
secondary punishment to prevent garotte robberies, is now on trial.
Since whipping was superadded to penal servitude as the punishment
of robbery accompanied with violence, we have certainly heard very
little of garotting. Perhaps penal [servitude plus whipping would
deter wretches who meditate murder from committing it even more
effectually than the gallows. Vindictiveness would be enabled to rejoice
in the endurance, by the murderer under the lash, of pangs longer and
sharper than those which are momentary, or over in a few minutes.
Would it not, then, be a tolerably safe experiment to try the effect of
hemp in the secondary form of the Cat P We thus cut the knot of the
halter if we do not untie it, and if we do untie the slip-knot, we tie
stronger knots, perhaps, in the scourge. Fiat experimentum, I say, in
corpore vili; ana remain,
Yours really and truly, In Terrorem.
P.S. Calcraft should have compensation if he lost business.
Severe Caution to "Word-Mongers.
The following is a curious proof of how far many an idle word (and
in the document in question there were no less than 1050 words of that
particular dolcefar niente description) will carry:—
11 The Royal Speech," says the Opinione Nalionale, "on opening the Session of
the Kngliali Parliament, was transmitted to Paris by five wires."
However, we scarcely needed the above fact to convince us that the
Queen's Speech this year was the most wire-drawn production we have
ever known.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO HONOUR SHAKSPEARE.
The numerous admirers
of the admirable dra-
matic poet, William
Shakspeare, have re-
solved to present him
with a testimonial on
the occasion of his three
hundredth birth-day.
Testimonial we say,
instead of memorial,
because a memorial to
i i iiw • the "dear son of me-
\W-Wa. c-ai^v.-
tical bull. A testimo-
nial, not a memorial, is
the proper thing for the
immortal Shakspeare.
What is it to be? Ap-
parently somewhat ma-
nifold. The inhabitants
of Stratford on-Avon,
with their Mayor at
their head, and in con-
junction with several
other gentlemen, will
probably offer their
talented fellow-towns-
man a testimonial con-
siderably more hand-
some than a silver ink-
stand. It is proposed,
by the so-called Com-
memoration Committee,
they may get one. It
British Art can make a
statue at all, how can
it make one of a Wil-
liams now invisible to
ordinary mortals? No
authentic image of him, that a sculptor could copy, exists. Perhaps
the gentlemen commissioned to negotiate the statue had better apply
to Mr. Home the Medium, who has lately evinced some ability as a
sculptor, and has been cultivating it at Rome. The combination of
seership with sculpture might enable Home to make a statue that would
really resemble Shakspeare: and if his chisel did just ice to Shakspeare,
nobody would ever afterwards suspect him of chiselling any one else.
However the proposed statue, if made, is expected not to engross all
the funds that will be subscribed towards the glorification of Shak-
speare. There are several other ways and means by which it is designed
to effect that purpose. One of the best that has as yet been suggested,
is pointed out by Mr. Benjamin Webster, in a little memorandum
entitled "An Appeal to the Shakspeare Committee for the Royal
Dramatic College. Herein Mr. Webster puts the following question,
which really seems unanswerable:—
"What nobler monument could be erected to the Memory of Shakspeare, him-
self a player, than the building and endowing the two Schools of this College in his
name, and enabling a few worn-out actors to pass in comfort to their last home who
have contributed to your pleasure and amusement?"
Recollect that either by sanctimony, or starched exclusiveness, or both,
the actors have been done out of their proper share of " God's gift" and
Alleyn's offering at Dulwieh. Shakspeare, whose reticence of his per-
sonal feelings is peculiar, makes more than one exception in favour of
the " poor player." Here below he sympathised keenly with his fellow-
chips, and now he may be reasonably supposed to care at least as much
for them as about anything else on the surface of this planet. It seems
probable that by building, and endowing in his name, the two contem-
plated schools of the Royal Dramatic College, his countrvmen and lovers
would erect a pile of masonry whose use might enable him to recognise
it at his present altitude, whence he might have some difficulty in dis-
cerning so small a thing as the greatest piece of sculpture. If they will
set him up a graven image, they must; but, to make the gift the more
gracious, let them, in addition to a bronze or marble figure, endow him,
in the form which Mr. Webster names, with bricks and mortar.

THE USE OE ARMY CHAPLAINS.
In reporting the progress of the burglary which the combined Aus-
trians and Prussians have been committing in Schleswig, the Special
Correspondent of the Times, with reference to the latter division of the
gang, offers the ensuing observation to persons endowed with reason:—
*' I am not sure that it is likely to encourage young soldiers to be addressed upon
the field in the terms which an acquaintance of mine assured me be heard employed
to-day by a well-meaning Cnapbiin who, in a short discourse, intended to arouse
the religious feelings of a battalion, informed them that it was highly probable
very few of them might come out of the struggle upon which they were at that
moment about to enter."
A full report of the reverend gentleman's discourse would doubtless
have precluded any question as to its effect on their pluck. Of course
no military Chaplain would be suffered to suggest to nis congregation,
on the point of going into action, that the majority of them were going
to fall, and might then possibly go to another abode than that of bliss.
The cloth to which Army Chaplains belong must be no wet blanket.
It is their business to make the pith of thenomily which they address
to soldiers on the eve of battle the orthodox equivalent of the exhor-
tation which a Mussulman preacher would deliver under similar circum-
stances; predestination and promise; the latter still more inspiriting
than the prospect held out to the Faithful who perish in the attempt to
destroy their enemies:—
"They come, their kerchiefs green they wave.
And welcome with a kiss the brave,
Who falls in battle 'gainst a Giaour,
Is worthy an immortal bower."
So the Prussian Chaplain above referred to might have assured his
hearers:—
"Who falls in battle 'gainst a Dane,
For ever with the Sainta shall reign."
If he did not say something of that sort, he had better have held his
tongue, or at least nave preached unintelligibly, to the edification of his
martial flock. A scrap of Latin, such as—
"Cum sit justus vix securer*
might have" a cheering influence on the uninstnicted mind of a hero
about to march into the cannon's month. A sermon, however, enforcing
the moral of the foregoing line, would be deprecated by most intelligent
commanding officers as little calculated to foster that first of military
virtues, intrepidity. The mission of an Army Chaplain is different from
that of a common Curate, and his sphere of usefulness is quite another
thing. His vocation, officially considered, is by no means the same as
that of a Gaol Chaplain, or even that of a divine whose eloquence is
required to awaken the consciences of respectable sinners. If the
ministrations of an Army Chaplain do not quiet instead of awakening
the consciences of the soldiers who sit or stand under him, and should
sit or stand at ease there, the wish of any judicious General must be
that the benefit of those services were spared his troops and allotted to
I the enemy.
There is no reason to doubt that the Prussian Chaplain put the
subject of death and futurity in a hopeful light to the troops whom he
was preparing to cut the throats of the Danes. It is fair to suppose
that his ghostly admonitions urged them to fight like devils in the
certainty of dying like Christians. We may pretty safely assume that
he did his duty to the State, and satisfactorily answered one important
purpose for which, among the rest, he was ordained.
SLAVERY IN SCOTLAND.
Railway Literature.—In consequence of the vast increase of
travelling accommodation by Riil to all parts of the Kingdom, a
Portable Edition of Bradshaio's Guide for the ensuing year will be
published monthly, in three volumes at a time.
The following afflicting statement appeared the other day among the
Notices to Correspondents in a penny weekly paper:—
"Heather Bell, an English girl, just eighteen, tall, with a fine face and splendid
figure, at present residing in Scotland, a country which she detests, as well as the
peoplo in it, can only hopo for a release from her bondage by marrying a young
Englishman resident in England, and who had not the remotest idea of crossing
the border. She can boast of refined tastes, and a moderate independence aa regard*
fortune."
Is the age of chivalry, then, really past? Is there no young English
champion who will start forth, and release this maiden from her
bondage? What! a prisoner in Scotland, and with people she detests!
Such an outrage really puts one in an out-and-out rage. Just eighteen,
and tall is she? with a moderate independence, and a splendid figure P
By Saint George! we've really half a mind ourselves to go and see
what we can do for her. A wife and seven children, it is true, are some
slight hindrance; but in mercy to poor "Heather Bell" Sir J. P.
Wilde would doubtless break such trifling ties upon us. Yes, yes; it
must be so: fate has clearly willed it. So, farewell, Angelina!
farewell Jane. James, Juliana, John, Jorge, Julia, and Jemima!
What, ho! without there! Hansom! Varlet, catch us the next train.

Little Barling. "Why, Grandpa, Mamma wants me to go to a Pantomime

A MULL BT MAX MULLER.
Under the title of "A German Plea for Germans," Professor Max Muller
writes a long and elaborate letter to the Times, of which almost all from the begin-
ning to nearly the end will be denied, but what thus follows will be admitted, by
most Englishmen:—
"Every life that is sacrificed in this purposeless and unhallowed war is precious to some one,
to some mother, or wife, or daughter, or sister. Even those rapped and unkempt Croats have
their ragged and unkempt mothers and wives at home, who will go wild when they hear of
tho death of their sons and husbands. We have heard to-day of the death of the brave Prince

without ceasing; but let them work in the true spirit of peace and charity, not in the spirit of
OF WURTEMBURQ.
Denmark, a Prince of
We may hoar to-morrow of the death of'a Prince of Prussia, a Kino of
f Holstein.
Let those who have power and influence work for
ii'
hatred, malice, and uncharitablcness.'1
So the war which the Germans are waging againt the Danes is called by Pro-
fessor Max Muller a "purposeless and unhallowed war." And this is the
conclusion of "A German Plea for Germans." Such an end to such an apology
would seem rather suitable to an Irish Plea for Irishmen. Every life that is sacri-
ficed in a purposeless and unhallowed war is deservedly sacrificed if he that has lost
it engaged in that war of his own accord. If he was only driven into it as a sheep to
the | slaughter, then his life is sacrificed to gratify the vain ambition of odious
people and execrable sovereigns. Every Dane that is slain in the war now
raging, is murdered, if that war is, as Professor Max Muller says it is, a pur-
poseless and unhallowed one. His murderers are the German people in general,
and the rulers of the two chief German states in particular. His blood is on the
heads of the Germans, and on the heads of Francis-Joseph of Austria and
William of Prussia. On their heads also is the blood of all the ragged and
unkempt Croats, together with every soldier in every German regiment, besides the
ragged ones, that have been dragged unwillingly to die for nothing from mothers
and wives, who will no doubt go wild when they hear of the deaths of their sons
and husbands, butchered in vain.
But is the war of fifty to one forced by Germans on Denmark, indeed purposeless?
Listen, Professor Max Muller. As to the purpose of your countrymen and
clients, don't you hear a little bird that sings:—
"They 're fighting to steal
The harbour of Kiel"
The war is unhallowed enough; but no more purposeless than assassination com-
mitted for the purpose of plunder.
HANTS ON SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN.
What o' voreign complications,
'UI knows what that word manes,
Most upsets a feller's patience,
Is the Germans and the Danes.
Southern hotheads slays their brothers,
Why? for 'tis their nature to;
But I did think them there others
Too for north the like to do.
Wuss than French Mossoos, or Spanish,
Mad on glory and eeclaa,
Here's the Germans wi' the Danish
Gone to war about a straa!
If their word is to be taken,

If so be as they doan't lie.
This here Schleswig Holstein rumpus

Or a scene o' blood and slaughter
Acted out on Twyford Down,
All because the law's decided,
And the sarvis zaid or zung
In fine English, not provided
In the native Hampshire tongue!
Yaa! if that was all the matter,
'Twould ha' zoon bin zet to rights;
'Tain't about a pint o' patter
As the Danes and Germans fights.
Them there Germans has intentions
Of another sart and kind
From the purpose which they mentions;
Motives what they keeps behind.
Schleswig-Holstein when to sever
They designs from Denmark's State,
Their true ooject and endeavour
Is a Navy to create.
Don't you credit their profession!
Their design is for to steal,
And thereby to take possession
Of that Baltic Harbour, Kiel.
Let 'urn bide; they 're in a hobble,
Zaxons, Austrians, Proossians, Croats;
Mongst thcirselves they 're like to squabble:
Let 'urn cut ach others' droats,
Whilst Italians and Hungarians
For their liberty combine,
And the Vrench, on them barbarians,

THE GHOST OF A COMPLIMENT.
Our friend, the Morning Slar, speaking of a Miss
Townley, says:—
"That young lady appears to have established herself at the
Canterbury as the prima donna, of spectral opera."
This is a new kind of accomplishment. Where, too, is
the Spectral Opera generally performed? We suppose, at
some of "the Shades." The voices of ghosts, and such
spectral subjects, must be, we should imagine, a little
gone, and they would be rather inclined, one cannot help
fancying, to sing a trifle too deep—so deep that one would
not care about following them. By the Dye, with a rare
qualification, like the one above specified, Miss Townley
should be specially well up in Weber's Ruler of the Spirits.
We suppose the latter would fitly come under the denomi-
nation of " Spectral Opera?" and if a ballet was wanted for
it, they might appropriately introduce The Shadow Dance.

MR. BULL UPON THE DANISH QUESTION.
I don't want to fight j but I don't like to see
Two big bullies a small boy attack -.
And it may be deemed selfish and sneakish in me,
While wishing the boy from his bullies were free,
My fists in his aid to hold back.
Mind, it is not for cowardice, 'tis not for cost,
That I stand for the present aside:
And though Tories may tell me my prestige I've lost,
By their taunts into fighting I '11 never be forced,
While a loophole for Peace is untried.
Yes, I own that in state-craft not seldom I've erred,
Li diplomacy often been duped,
For I '\e somehow a habit of keeping my word,
A habit that seems to those statesmen absurd
Who so oft to deceive me have stooped.
That my efforts as yet have but little availed
To prevent needless bloodshed I own;
But the quarrel's not mine: and, although I have failed,
No fair reason the critics, my course who've assailed,
For armed interference have shown.
Is my honour in doubt? Have I plighted my word
With my cannon my counsels to back?
Then you '11 find by no fear of expense I'm deterred,
And when once the war spirit within me is stirred
'Tis not easy its fury to slack.
For glory, for interest, no war I will wage:
But, once shown 'tis my duty to fight,
Then 'tis fairly recorded in History's page
That I ne'er was a sluggard to throw down my gage,
And to cry, "Heaven prosper the llight!
Disinterested Opposition.
The House of Commons going into Committee of Supply
on the Naval Estimates, Mr. Bernal Osborne moved that
their consideration should be postponed till that day three
weeks. The Collective Wisdom rejected this proposal,
probably considering so precipitate an attempt to embarrass
the Government on the part of the Ex-Secretary of the
Admiralty, a proceeding somewhat out of place.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
February 22, Monday. Both Houses came up lively and smiling
and bent on mischief. There has been a scheme for a covered Arcade
between Regent Street and Bond Street, which would have given ladies
and swells a pleasant lounge when the weather was English. But divers
interests were menaced, and many shopkeepers very naturally objected
to a plan which would offer temptations to their esteemed patrons to
make purchases elsewhere than at existing shops. So a formidable
opposition, was got up, and as, luckily, a useful charity-school would
have had to be removed, the Bishops and Clergy were interested in
resistance. The brief was given to Lord Derby, who did his work with
his accustomed adroitness, showed that the Arcade would be of no use,
dilated upon the probability that naughty persons would go there (the
excuse by virtue of which the Quadrant was uglified), urged that the
passage would go through an empty space, and thereby check the cir-
culation of air, and he was generally so impressive upon all points
except the real one that the Bill was thrown out, though Lord
Malmesbury, as a man of the world, could not resist the temptation of
laugliing a little at his chief's grave vaticinations of evil. Mr. Punch,
who is a cosmopolite, often thinks with regret, when the air is drizzle
and the flags are slush, of the pleasant Arcades of Paris, and begs to
touch Lord Derby's classical nature by adding
NOSETIA
MINARC
ADIA
Government has sent out officers to watch the mode in which the
Federals carry on the war, in order to obtain any hints that may be
useful, but does not send similar envoys to the Confederate camp. On
the whole, Punch may possibly think that we might learn more by
studying the way in which a small nation successfully defends itself
against a large one, than by seeking lessons from commanders who have
overwhelming resources in hand, out no very brilliant ideas as to the
way to use them.
"PtJHCH and the Ministers on this divide;
They'd watch the conquered, he the conquering side."
The Commons plunged into the Dano-German, or rather the Disbaelo-
Gladstone war. The Conservatives again made demand for the
Papers, and were as angry at their being detained as a young articled
clerk is, at a slap bang, when the old gentleman in box 9 will spell the
advertisements m a journal which Mary-my-dear has warned him will
be taken "after him." Mr. Disraeli delivered a long and cutting
speech upon the deliberate wickedness of the Cabinet in not producing
the correspondence, and exclaimed, in a Goethian spirit, "We want
light." It he didn't get a light, he got a light answer from Mr. Glad-
stone, who complimented him on Ida skill in letting off " fireworks,"
and entirely declined to follow him in "saying smart things." In
answer to inquiries by Mr. Disraeli as to the seizure of Jutland, Mr.
Gladstone refused to give any information, because he had none. Then
Lord Robert Cecil dilated upon the "scorn " with which Europe is
treating our menaces (we have made none), and then Mr. Bernal
Osborne saw his way to make capital play. We will not have harm-
less fireworks," he said, and boldly moved that the Navy Estimates,
which stood for discussion, should be postponed. The spear was fairly
thrown, but Mr. Roebuck spoiled the fun by declaring that the pro-
posal amounted to a vote of want of confidence, and therefore he should
support it. Then, of course, Mr. Gladstone rose up defiant, and
offered battle, and Mr. Disraeli had to bring new tactics into work.
He bad a strong force with him, but it would not do to fight in earnest.
So he had to be dignified, to decline to take a vote by surprise, and to
hold his men back. But he could not manage this with all of them,
and though he and the mass of the Conservatives walked off, Mr.
Bernal Osborne went to division, the Radical leader of 36 Tories and
11 Liberals, but as there were 220 against him, he did not turn out the
Government that time. And then Lord Palmerston came in, and
took his seat amid,plaudits. Is not the game of Parliament a merry
one?
Docks at Malta, and Dockyards at home, were the lively themes of a
wrangle until 10.30.
Tuesday. Three of the Lords spoke, and all three sensibly, upon the
Penal Servitude System. Lord Grey said, very truly, that the difficult
question was, as to what the convict was to do when discharged, as
honest workmen will not labour with him. There is a problem worthy
vol. xlvi.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
the ingenuity of the Peerage, and that body would earn no end of
kudos by solving the same.
This, is worth notice. The Federals have been allowing the French,
with the consent of the English, to break the blockade, in order to get
at Tobacco, which is much wanted in France. At first the excuse was
made that the baccy had been bought before the war. But it came out
that ever so much of it had been bought after the war began, and yet
Lincoln let Napoleon have it, Russell assenting. Then, the excuse
was, that baccy forms part of the French revenue, of which Mr. Lincoln
and Queen Victoria are of course bound to take care. Well, but
baccy forms part of our revenue, and, moreover, we want cotton as
much as France wants cigars. Why cannot the Federals be as civil to
us as to France? Echo answers—but we decline to republish her
remarks, as they might offend Mr. Seward.
Mr. Locke King obtained leave to bring in a Bill for lowering the
county franchise to £10. He objects to rest, or to be thankful either.
The Bill will be thrown out about the middle of April.
On the preceding morning five foreigners, who had been convicted of
murder and piracy, were hanged, in a row, at the Old Bailey. To-night
the House had a Public Executions debate. Mr. Hibbert (Oldham)
described such scenes as disgusting, and contended that the behaviour
of the rabble showed that they produced no impression. Mr. Hadfleld
took the same view, and said that fights and executions were the most
popular spectacles of the day, and that if a fight occurred within two
hundred yards of that House, there would be. a Count. Sir George
Gret, for the Government, defended the Bystcm of capital punishments
in public; said that the execution of the pirates had taken place with I
the general approval of the public, that no doubt the very lowest orders'
assembled at such a scene, and that it was especially to them that its ■
lesson was addressed, that it was impossible to say how much crime
was prevented by the knowledge that murderers would be hanged, and
that Society was by no means prepared to forego a system which was
instinctively felt to deal just retribution and afford valuable security.
Alderman Sidney complained that almost every criminal was brought
into the City to be banged. Lord Henry Lennox had been to the
execution, and supported Mr. Hibbert's view, and next day some-
body wrote in the timet something which meant that the correspondent
and Lord Henry had been together to see a fight, so that he might
also have supported Mr. Hadfield's view. Mr. Bonham Carter
opposed executions, and Lord Grey de Wilton said that he went to
see Lani hanged, and thought that the impression made on the crowd
was salutary. So the matter ended.
Next, we had another smart debate, raised by Mr. Seymour Fitz-
gerald, about those unfortunate Rams of Mr. Laird's. The Attorney-
General, Lord Robert Cecil, Sir H. Cairns, and Mr. Walpole,
all went at the iron ships hammer and tongs, like jolly blacksmiths, but
the sensation of the nignt was created by the Conservative Mr. Thomas I
Baring, Merchant Pnnce, who drew away from his usual party, and in
the interest of Commerce denounced the system of arming privateers
in neutral ports to take part in war between belligerents. And Mr.
j Baking asked whether the defenders of Mr. Laird did not know per-
| fectly well that the Rams were for President Davis and nobody else.
I Of course everybody knew it, but what does that matter in a party
: squabble? The division (Mr. Fitzgerald had asked for the papers)
was a near one, and did not mean papers or no papers, but Federals or
Confederates, and there were 178 of the former to 153 of the latter.
Wednetday. The Cows' Malt Bill. The agriculturists do not like it
much, for thev regard it as a tub to the malt-tax whale. One odd
thing is, that beer lias been brewed with the mixture of linseed which
was to make brewing impossible, and Members have tasted it and
declare that it is very good beer—for the poor.
''Thurtday.—Nothing in the Senate except a little pleasant row about
differences of opinion as to the desirability of producing the Ram
i papers. The Attorney-General had told Lord Russell that they

Attorney-General had changed his opinion.

one.
Opposition Lords. Ha! ha! Ho! ho! Hee! hee!

Bravo, Mr. Cox! Hooray, Lord Fermoy! These epigrammatic but
ardent tributes of admiration and gratitude are most respectfully offered
to the above-named Metropolitan Members for moving and seconding an
amendment which crushed and smashed a Bill for keeping up a toll-gate
between St. Pancras and Islington for twenty-one years more. A likely
story, when all the tolls are being snuffed out as abominable nuisances.
Lord Enfield had put his name to the Bill, but as he had the grace
to behave like a nobleman and a gentleman, and say that he was ashamed,
and had done it without reading the Bill, we shall merely recommena
him in future to bear in mind a beautiful line in his own " Speaker,"
which says :—

Mr. Cowper did not see why the big clock at Westminster should
be kept alight after Parliament hours, but if the House liked to bum
no end of gas, it was none of his business. We do not know why
the Commons burst out laughing when Mr. Darby Griffith rose to
ask a rational question, or why they laughed again when Lord Pal-
merston gave a snubbing answer. There was more reason to laugh
when the Premier had to admit that having seized the Tuscaloosa we
had now found it expedient to let her go again • or when his Lordship
had to say that though we have got Austria and Prussia to assent to a
Conference, they laugh at our suggestion that there should be a sus-
pension of hostilities.
Then the Navy Estimates were taken, and the debate lasted far into
the night, and Government had a little beating—31 to 28, about one
o'clock. There is a reduction of sea-men and sea-boys, and it does sot
seem a wise one.
Friday. Colonel Crawley's friends in the Lords had a good deal
to say for him, and of course made the most of the acquittal. The
Duke of Cambridge was quite pleased with the result, and said that
the Colonel had gone back to his command with an unsullied reputation.
Punch considers that, the Colonel is a very lucky man, and that the
British Army is also lucky in having so wise a Commander as the Duke
of Cambridge. In fact, we are all pleased.
Under no circumstances is Town lit to be released from penal servi-
tude. The House cheered. We seldom bet, but—however, we won't
make an exception this time. 9
Ireland with all its wrongs, taxation included, was referred to a Select
Committee, and is now, we hope, shelved. This excellent act ended a
rattling week.
SENSATION CENSUS.
Precious and Protective Punch,
Now that the subject of Accidents by Fire in Theatres is on
the lapis, I want to know if you can induce any one in the House of
Commons to move for a Return of the number of killed or wounded,
temporarily or permanently injured among those actors who have been
engaged for the last two or three years in playing the Heroes and
Heroines of those exciting Sensational Productions, now so much the
vogue. The official document might be drawn up in the following

no more upon this subject at present, having promised to dine some-

may have time to enjoy an anti-dyspeptic cigar before going to witness
the new-thrillingly-exctting play lately brought out at the Surrey. 01

an early opportunity of witnessing a Sensation Piece in which the
Lessee himself, as one of the Personages of the Drama, incurs consider-
able personal risk, why, some untoward accident might happen, which
would cause the piece to be withdrawn, and, perhaps, the Theatre to be
shut up an event which would be a matter for perpetual regret to those
who had not had the good luck to be spectators of the performance
either before or upon the night of the disaster.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SHAKSPEARE AND HIS ASSAILANTS.
N poor dear Shaxspeare
the designs are as plen-
tiful as pick pockets.
Here is one suggested
by a writer in that influ-
ential print the West
London Obierxer:—
"As regards the Stratford-
on-Avon Memorial, let it by
ail means, be a startling
object to look upon. Sup-
posing: then—in these sen-
sation loving times, when
any novel design is sure to
attract the supfort of a pub-
lic that never weary of new
patterns, from Great East-
erns to self-threadingneedles
—supposing', then, 1 say, the
sTiifKt-tttion be made to enli-
ven the scenery of the btrth-:
place of the sweet Swan of
Avon, * England's highest
pride,' by erecting there a
porcelain tower, say of at
least one hundred feet high,
built with a solid core of
brickwork; the exterior
could be decorated illimi-I
tably with designs in por-
celain from the tragedies
and plays and poems of the
bard, and with enriched gal-
leries from base to top, and
stairs giving access thereto
—it would, I imagine, be
the ne plui ultra of enriched
design.''
Horace called his -works a monument more durable than brass, and
we really think that Shaksmsare's are more durable than crockery. A
porcelain tower doubtless might be made a pretty thing to look at—
while it lasted: but we fear that little boys would soon be tempted
to throw stones at it, and we know the best of crockery in such cases
will crack.

if we did not know that Harris in this instance is a Christian surname,
knowing as we do that Harry is only the semblance of a Christian
name.
We here see young Harrt, as it were, with his bearer up, and asking
Harris what he means by dragging his "faith" and his transference
of shop into the House of Lords. It is remarkable that Harry puts
the word "faith" in inverts, which setfm to imply a smile at the impu-
tation it conveys. Harris ought to have better known what Faith is
than to employ the speciality of Christianity as a synonym for the creed
acknowledged by a gentleman in Harry's theological position. But
there is a difference between the Earl of Malhesbury, and the
philosopher of that ilk, or any other. Mammy will be Mammy!
THE STAEF COLLEGE.
Dear Pmccn,
I have been a month reading for the next Staff College
Entrance Examination, but the subjects are so numerous that I am
quite bewildered, and want you to advise me what to do. The following
is the style of information I have already succeeded in picking up:—
"The Angle A is a right angle, and equal to ninety degrees of Fahren-
heit, measured on a scale showing a hundred and twenty-seven Spanish
kilometres to the square inch, multiplied by twice xy into the cube root
of the ravelin in Cormontaigne's fifteenth system, divided by decimal
000000 of a megalosaurus, completely upset the calculations of Arch-
duke Charles, who, with his army in a highly spheroidal state, was
endeavouring, at Marengo, on the Northern frontier of Spain, to turn
the flank of the Old Red Sandstone dissolved in bi-protocarburetted
hydrogen; the sandstone escapes, and the hydrogen forms a military
road across Mont Cenis, at a distance from Wellington's head-quarters,
and three aneroid barometers, doing as much work as seventeen tailors
working twenty-six hours a day, and protected by (rout de loup from the
vertical fire of three sapgabions ranged along the shoulder angle of a
plane of defilade erected on the hachure of a rhombic dodecahedron."
• Ever yours,
A Bewildered Candidate'for the Staff.
HARRY VERSUS HARRIS.
Lord Malmesbury having in the debate on the Royal Arcade'Bill,
thrown out, alluded to Mr. Harry Emanuel, the jeweller, of Brook-
Street, as "a gentleman of the Hebrew faith," Mr. Emanuel writes a
letter to the Ttnu>, wherein, after answering the noble Earl's statement
connecting him with "the perpetuation of the deficient width in Bond
Street," he makes the ensuing remark:—
"I, of course, very much regret that my * faith' and the fact of my Intended
removal should be obnoxious to the noble Lord, but am really at a loss to know
what either of these subjects can have had to do with the matter under discussion,
orwhy Lord Malmesbury should have obtruded them into a Parliamentary debate.''
It is a curions coincidence that whilst the plaintiff in this case names
himself Harry Emanuel, the defendant is named James Howard
Harris. Harry against Harris! Such an antagonism would incline
us to say, with a certain variation, "When Greek meets Greek," &c,
WHO WILL SAY A WORD FOR THEM?
My dear Punch,
That was a good letter which you put in your last number,
written by a ballet-girl—I beg your pardon, Miss, I mean to say, of
course, a Lady of the Ballet." I hope she and her sisterhood will
reap some good in consequence, and now the public know how little
these hard-working girls are paid, and what great expense they are put
to in the matter of their wardrobe, which the people who engage them
by rights ought to supply, I hope the public will at any rate regard
them with more charity, even if ;that charity be not allowed in case of
need to take substantial shape. Of course the public is too virtuous
to dream of founding an asylum for them, to which they might retire
when their dancing days are over, and where, in the event of accident
or illness, they might be nursed and tended at the public's own expense.
I can conceive the many obstacles there are to such a scheme, and how,
even were a Home for Ballet-girls established, it would be next door to
impossible to get trustees to manage it. What father of a family could
undertake the office, without continual torments in his domestic life?
Only just imagine the black looks he would be greeted with, on the
days when he returned from an inspection of the Home! Just conceive
the pious horror wherewith his wile would shrink and shudder at his
mention of that terribly contaminating place! And supposing there
should be some slight festivity at Christmas time, as is the custom now
at most Asylums, I believe, only think if he confessed that, as one of the
M.C.'s there, he had danced with a live ballet-girl, even though she was
past sixty, what an earthquake of domestic ties and friendships would
result! What matron would receive such a Pariah m her drawing-
room? What wife would not seek refuge in Sir J. P. Wilde, his
court?
So the notion of a National Asylum for Old Ballet-girls, I put aside
as quite preposterous in this our moral Christian land. Yet I suppose,
like other mortals, ballet-dancers do grow old, and they can't save much
to live on in their possible old age out of their twelve or fifteen shillings
salary per week. What becomes then of our Columbines, our Fairies
and our Sylphs, when they are over fifty, or are weakened in their legs?
Do their Managers provide them with some rural Bowers of Bliss, where
they may live in idle ease and happy freedom from the call-boy, until
the final call that summons them away? I fearme this conjecture is scarce
borne out by the fact that their Managers require them to buy their
satin shoes and silk tights and other costly clothing out of their twelve
shillings a-week. Yet even ballet-girls must live, even when they are
past work, though where and how they do so is a mystery to me. Were
a Home for them established, that mystery would be solved: for
although it might be difficult to get a building big enough to hold the
many applicants who doubtless soon would flock to it, still at the Home
funds might be furnished for those who could not live in it to be lodged
and fed elsewhere.
I just throw out the suggestion, but of course I don't expect that
any one will act on it, for I know that most rich people have far too
much morality to think of doing anything for such people as poor ballet-
girls, who are supposed to be descendeafrom some of the Lost Tribes.
Of course Polite Society can never be expected to take anything like an
interest in persons of,) his sort. Still although Polite Society may not
feel disposed to help to keep poor ballet-girls alive, I think Polite Society
would not be altogether pleased were ballet-girls extinct. When Mrs.
Overr Wrighteocse gets her annual Christmas box and takes her
children to a morning performance of a pantomime (which everybody
knows is far more moral than an evening one), I doubt if she or they
would like to find the part of Columbine omitted, and to be told that all
the fairies had retired from scenic life for fear of being destitute and
starved in their old age. So if the ballet-girls be needful to the plea-
sure of Society, I think Society might stretch a hand to help them in
their need.
With a million of apologies to the million of your moral readers for
intruding on their notice a subject of this highly objectionable sort, I
will only in conclusion add, that if my hint be taken and a subscription
fairly started for the purpose I have advocated, I shall be happy to sub-
scribe myself (at the bottom of a cheque, mind)
One who will Pay.

THE STOCKS AT ST. IVES.
The heart of every Sabbatarian beadle in the kingdom who reads the
Time), will have been warmed by the following paragraph which has
appeared therein:—
"Revival or thb Stocks.—On Tuesday afternoon three boys were kept in tho \
stocks at St. Ives, Cornwall, for three hours, for having plAyed marbles on Sunday.
This mode of punishment had not been adopted in this town for SO years, and the |
novel sight consequently attracted several hundreds of spectators."
All honour, that defiance of modern public feeling deserves, to those
Magistrates of the good old school who made no bones of putting a set
of idle boysj in the stocks. It had become fashionable to regard the
stocks as a barbarous anachronism, and Justices as not exactly entitled
to stand on no ceremony with boys. It is needless to inquire whether,
in playing marbles on a Sunday, the boys, who were so very properly
punished by the Cornish Magistrates, were violating the law. Anynow,
they were doubtless following their ordinary occupation. To persons,
indeed, who know how to appreciate a healthy unscrupulousness in
arbitrarily punishing street-boys, and especially to the clerical and ped-
agogical mmd, those Magistrates would have afforded high delight if
they had sentenced the boys to the stocks simply for playing marbles,
on any day of the week. In visiting juvenile Sabbath-breakers with that
punishment almost instantly on the .decision of the Queeu's Bench in
the haymaking case at Leigh, they will be considered by the highly
respectable people who admire their courage, to have acted as season-
ably as wisely. Sentimental twaddlers will ask if setting children in
the stocks for playing on a Sunday is the way to develop their religious
feelings? The sufficient answer is "Yes;" with a derisive grin.
Accordingly, of course the Home Secretary will not remove the gen-
tlemen who made so edifying an example of a leash of varlets as that
which is hereby proposed for his approbation, from the Commission of
the Peace. And. doubtless a sympathetic British populace must sym-
pathise so entirely with the proper parties in this matter, and is so
innocent of any acquaintance with the tragedy of Lear, that a line
adapted from that noole drama, namely:—
Who put the boys i' tho stocks?"
will not, whenever their worships make their
henceforth, be shouted in their ears.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AD CLERUM.
Mr. Punch, as the Great Public
Moralist of the age, has always
entertained the highest regard for
the clergy. How much they owe
him he needs not asseverate. Some
of the happiest things in the popular
discourses of the day, have been
derived from his columns. In the
benevolence of spirit that has always
influenced him, he now devotes a
chapter on Beards to their service.
The Country Clergy require this
attention; tney are behind the age,
and have not the opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the im-!
provements of this advancing
period. Mr. Punch has, therefore,
catalogued and arranged the various
methods of disposing of Nature's
noblest adornment to the face of
man, for their service. The Barbine •
Movement is altogether the pro-
perty of the Establishment,—no
Popish priest in this country has
entrenched upon this prerogative.
The Dissenters shave in gloomy
silence, leaving this noble field of
ecclesiastical adornment to the
Clergy of the Establishment. The
first oeard, Mr. Punch recommends
to his Clerical friends is Mufty.
This consists simply of a very bold
development of the hirsute privi-
leges of manhood.
hair is black and roses and lilies by the encouragement of whiskers
adorn the face of the youthful | and moustache, blending them to-
curate. It consists in a single curl
of hair passing under the chin from
temple to temple, like the frill of
a widow's cap. It must, however,
be very neatly arranged. The face
must be cleanly shaved, and curling-
tongs, bostrokizon, bandoline, and
gum Arabic, must all be judiciously
applied to put Rufty in good shape,
and keep him in goo<f order. A
doubt of a moustache may some-
times be advantageously admitted
with Rufty. This is a very insinu-
ating beard.
gether in one long roll, pointed at
the end, and communicating rigi-
dity by means of gum and bando-
line; the chin must be closely cut
or shaven. This is a very pious
beard.


Mufty is achieved by giving a
complete freedom to Nature. No
single hair is to be curtailed in
its luxurious growth. Truants are
indeed to be brought into order by
a proper application of the curling
tongs, a charming negligence to
be made apparent by the frequent
application of a well-greased palm
with a circular movement to the
mass of beard. But no water must
approach on any pretence the sacred
precinct admirea in the "Monks of
Old."
Mufty is an excellent device
wherewith to encounter Mr. Spur-
geon's "roaring Devils." It
answers the same purpose as war-
paint on an Indian's face.
Tufty comes next, a most appro-
priate ornament for jocose preachers
of the Spcrgeon class. It simply
consists of an oval unshaven spot
on the very point of the chin.
Neither whiskers nor moustache
consort with Tufty, he must be the
sole centre of attraction. The
advantages of this arrangement are
many. Be the preacher never so
dull, Tufty keeps up a bye-play of
his own, he wags up and down and
right and left, witn every move-
ment of the chin or draught in the
Church. The juvenile members of
a congregation are always much
edificaby Tufty. They watch him
with intense interest, and as he
sways to and fro " like that white
courser's tail, the Giant Steed to
be bestrode by Death," they gaze
on the fountain of orthodoxy with
supreme delight. Tufty gives great
point by his waggery to every joke,
and he certainly must be esteemed
a most facetious arrangement of
the pilose adornment.

Next in Order comes Rufty.
This is a most pleasing facial orna-
ment, it answers best where the

Next to Tufty comes the Jan,—
the lower line of the face must in
this case mark the limit to which
the razor may go. AVnen the hair
has arrived tat a certain growtli
then the razor must clear all su-
perfluity from the neck beneath,
leaving half an inch of hair in depth
to form the fan. Bandoline and
gum Arabic will give this fringe
the proper set; it greatly sets off
the human countenance as the fans
of peacock feathers do the Pope.
An insinuating preacher will deeply
impress the serious mind by a well-
disposed Fan.
A truly patriarchal beard next
demands our notice, it is the
Mosaic Horn. This is developed


The animal creation affords us
some lessons on this subject which
we may improve, and of which the
clergy have taken very proper ad-
vantage. For instance, the Tur-
keycock affords us a hint for a
very charming arrangement of pil-
osity. In this case we allow neither
beard nor moustache, but a very
simple development of the whisker.
It is brought down in the shape of
a turkeycock's jowls, the scizzors,
curling-tongs, with gum, and if
needful a horsehair centre, will
bring this admired form to perfec-
tion.

We next have the Gibbon, a very
becoming fringe, suggested by that
amiable species of ape. It is a
straight fringe round the face: it
only requires frequent brushing to
keep it stiff and straight, gum
may be required, and Mr. Punch
does not object to a tint of cos-
metic if the hair be turning grey.
The Lynx is most appropriate for
preachers of the Boanerges class.
It is easily achieved, but requires
attention: the eye-brows must be
gummed up at the corners, the
moustache properly turned up

line each side. A good Lynx ter-

rifies evil-doers, particularly of the j
female class. - -
The Goat is merely the under J
beard brought over the cravat;

it is very solemn and patriarchal.
The Niagara is unusual, but in a
few cases finds favour; it is formed

by shaving away all hirsute append-
ages above an ideal line drawn
across the face from the tip of one
ear to that of the other, and
allowing all below the line to grow
in perpendicular freedom. It be-
comes clerical gents of a middle age
who still rejoice in hirsute privi-
leges on the lower part of the coun-
tenance, and is an assertion of
vigorous manhood, especially be-
coming when the upper sphere of
the cranium has been divested of
its capillary attractions.
These are the principal beards
that adorn our pulpits; they admit
of many subdivisions which it
would be tedious to particularise.
No doubt they greatly strengthen
the Establishment by increasing the
respect in which the clergy are held.
Dissent came in with the razor;
Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley,
of course had beards, and it was
the beard that awed the rebellious
Puritan till the days of Laud.
The Roundheads clipped then-
locks in mockery of a shaven
clergy. The beard alone is want-
ing to restore unity and piety to
the land; it is a sure intimation
that the clergy are above the poor
vanities of the world—allow Nature
to assert her privileges—and are too

much taken up with higher duties to attend to the adornments of
their persons.
Mr. Punch concludes by suggesting that as they permit their hair to
grow "like eagle's feathers," they should suffer their "nails to grow
uke birds' claws," the effect of such a conjunction in the pulpit would
be irresistible.
SURPRISING ABUSE OF ENGLAND.
UEELy we ought to be very much ashamed of
ourselves, as a nation, for declining to sacrifice
hundreds of thousands of men and millions of
money in taking a part in Continental squabbles.
If we had any regard for our reputation, we
should feel very much hurt at the scornful and
abusive language in which we are spoken of
by the foreign Press, as for instance by a paper
representing one of the parties engaged in the
Schleswig-Holstein quarrel. Here are a few,
out of a whole column of cruel things, which
this indignant journal says about us English-
men:—
"England has never made herself remarkablo for the
knowledge of the condition of other nations, for a just
and logical mode of thought, or for the consideration
of foreign interosts and foreign opinions."
In the struggle against Napoleon the
First, for example, England consulted her own
interests only, and not those of foreigners at
all; witness the enormous national debt which
she incurred therein simply to enrich her fund-
holders. And now we have no knowledge of the
state of things in Schleswig and Holstein. We don't know that those
Duchies are invaded on a trumpery pretext, and that, in the former of
them, numbers of brave men have been slaughtered in the defence of
their country—do we? Or if we do know that Schleswig is suffering
the horrors of war, cruelly and wantonly inflicted, so incapable are we
of a just and logical mode of thought as not to perceive that we ought
instantly to send a contingent to the Danish Army and a fleet to the
Baltic, blockade every German port, and declare war against Austria
and Prussia, This illogical poltroonery is so like us! For:—
"When some years since, the attention of a no longer living English diplomatist,
casually residing at Vienna, was drawn to the logical contradictions iu oertain
despatches written by E a iu. Rubbkll, he replied that England had never based her
pride on being distinguished by logic. Lord Elgin might have easily become
acquainted with other observations respecting the character of English politics, and
if he had been sincere also, he would have found opportunity to reply that England
had never based her pride on being accurately informed respecting justice or
injustice ; or acting according to other motives than those of her own advantage,
united with her arrogance and her insolence respecting the rights of nations ; or on
magnanimity towards a weaker opponent in renouncing grounded or ungrounded
claims."
Thus, of course, we labour under the mistake of supposing that
justice is altogether on the side of the Germans, and mere injustice on
that of the Danes. With a selfish view to our own advantage only, we
not only deny the Danes assistance, but also treat their national rights,
violated by Germany, with the contempt of arrogance and insolence.

succour against her dastardly assailants. No, my dear readers, not so;
but as our humbler classes say, more t'other. The commencement of
the article of which the foregoing samples may have made you smile, is
as follows:—
"We are not at all surprised at the position which England has assumed against
Germany in tile Danish question."
England's offence, you see, consists in the moral aid which she has
given strong Denmark against weak Germany, and not in the reverse.
It is poor Germany is aggrieved. The journal which throws all the
foregoing, and much more, slops at us, is a Viennese paper, said to be
the organ of the Austrian Minister, M. von Schmehling. The title
under which it appears is that of the Wanderer, Well, well! Suppose
we call it the Vagabond.
A HAUNTED HOUSE!
Wondekful facts for the Ghost Club, Sir, as sure as I'm alive. My

Having heard that number Bi, Blank Place, a house belonging to
Mr. and Mrs. Wiiytey Brown, patients of mine, had the reputation of
being haunted, I frequently called there. Mrs. W. B., a remarkably
nice person, has frequently assured me, that, in the absence of her
husband, who's in the City from ten till five, she has often heard queer
noises. We watched for many days, from eleven till four, but could
detect nothing.
On last Tuesday, the 17th, however, as I wa6 going up-stairs,
I distinctly saw the head of a lady suddenly appear out of a door on
the landing, and from its pale hps, a solemn and peculiarly plaintive
voice proceed, saying—" Maria, bring me my body."
What fearful crime has, at some previous time, stained those floors
with gore, I know not. But I can testify that on the above occasion
I with my own ears heard a lonely head piteously imploring Maria,
(who, it appears, is the lady's maid, and will henceforth be narrowly
watched) to bring its body. j remaill) TOun> faithfully,

"On the contrary, English policy has many times distinguished itself by cringing
before the strong and by haughtiness to the weak. It is the character of
snobbism which is transferred from English private life to English politics. To
yield to the first opposition, and to indemnify itself for so doing on those who can
offer no resistance, has for a long time been the heroism of English policy, which
has taken good care not to pick a quarrel with'the United States, but therefore
carries off Brazilian ships because a drunken English officer, who had behaved
himself clownishly in the streets of Rio Janeiro, received a due reprimand from tho
police."
Exactly so; we pocketed the Trent affront on the one hand, and did
not submit the Brazilian business to arbitration on the other; much
less did we accept an award unfavourable to ourselves, and apologise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A POET IN A PET.
K f\ inch the "Mouse's Petition,"
| v V dear to pood little boys and
girls, Mr. Punch has seen
nothing more piteous than a
Poet's Plaint, which has jnst
appeared in the Athen<eum.
It is indeed a sort of Singing-
Mouse's Petition. The sor-
rows of the unhappy bard
must be deep indeed to cause
him to emit so lamentable a
wail, and we should like to
wipe his eyes and comfort
him, if we can.
Prosaically stated, his ease
is this. He, Mb. Henrt F.
Chorlet, being by profession
a Poet, was employed to
write English words, or words
which he might suppose to
be English, as a "book for
the opera called Faust. Mr.
Punch had the joy and delight
of reading these words in Ins
stall at Covent Garden, and
he recollects thinking that
though they were not worse
than Mr. Fitzball's lyrics,
they were not so melodious
as that other Poet's remark-
able strains. But as Faust
was not sung in the Chorleian
dialect, but in Italian, this
did not matter. But when
it was decided that Faust
should be performed, in
English, at Her Majesty's
Theatre, and Mr. Sims
Reeves was to be the victim
of the Personage whom Lord
Westbuby has dismissed
with costs," the unsingable
character of the Poet Chor-
let's divine verses became a serious fact, and in short the great English tenor was
obliged, after vain attempts to sing them, to stipulate that he should be furnished
with language adapted to the music, and to the expression of the various passions
of Dr. Fauslus. Such words were obtained (there must be another great poet in
existence, in addition to Fitzball and Chorlet, and who shall say that this is not
England's Augustan age P) and Mr. Sims Reeves made a grand success. The
critics, for some reason, told us nothing about Poet the Third, and though the new
words were printed in the theatre-books as "Alterations." the honour and glory of
them remained to Poet the Second. He has borne the laurels, vicariously, for
some time, but now they seem too heavy for his pensive brow, and he has disclaimed
them in that part of our esteemed contemporary the Athcnceum, wherein Mb,
CnoRLEY usually disports himself with quaint intimations that some Ladvwhom
the town admires is not altogether so bad an artist as she would be if she were
worse, or in similar amiable acridities. He complains, with a sweet and touching
sadness, that Mr. Reeves, without leave from or "warning to" him, the Poet,
discarded his effusions and sang those of the other Poet. And as he appeals to
thepublic, it would be rude, as well as unkind, not to notice his hard case.
We have been thinking how best to comfort him, but there are some woes which
refuse assuagement, and which time only can cure. Shall we scold Mr. Sims
Reeves? It certainly was very hard-hearted in him to refuse to spoil a great
part, in the fate of which his own reputation and the interests of the theatre were
at stake. He should have felt for the Poet, and struggled through his unsingable
lines. If the result had been failure, and the singer had damaged his fume and
the opera had not drawn, and the manager had lost his money, and the company
had been disbanded; never mind, there would have been balm m Gilead, and also
in Columbia, for the Poet Chorley's inspirations would have been sung. But
Mr. Sims Reeves would have artistic words, and the Poet wails. Poor dear
Poet. Will he dry his eyes and be pleased if Mr. Punch looks into the book,
and takes out one of the dear little songs which the Poet Chorlet has written? Let
us try:—
"Who needs bidding to daro
By a trumpet blown T
Who lacks pity to spare
When the Seld is isoan?
Who would fly from a foe
Tho' alone and last t
Or boast he was true,
As coward mtaht do.
When peril is pastff
There now. Is not that pretty and musical, and is not "blown" a neat rhyme
to won," and is not the first question lucidly put, and is it not sweetly true that
a coward might boast when peril is past, and when a foe is
alone and last, would it not be absurd to fly from him?
Come, Poet dear, out of an opera-full of gems like this you
can afford to let a few be sacrificed to the absolute necessity
of having the opera properly sung. That's well—we are
calmer now?
What? A fresh outbreak! What's the matter now?
Rest, rest, perturbed poet. What is it?" Mr. Santlet
(the admirable Valentine) found that he could not make the
Poet's words in the dying scene effective, and got others."
Nay, this is piling up the poetical agony, Pelion upon
Ossa. Punch feels unequal to do more in the comforting
line. Here are the two leading artists of the English
stage uniting to protest that Mb, Chorlet is not a lyric
poet. We give up. All we can say is, that he had better
lake the opera-house, and come out, himself, as Faust,
singing his own divine poetry, and afterwards he can give
his candid opinion of himself in the Athenteum.
A MAD WORLD.
Fear no more war; the world is grown
Too wise and too humane to fight.
Opinion's rule mankind will own,
And nations do each other right.
None but the warfare of police,
Henceforward will there be to do;
Short work: war but to keep the peace
When troubled by the evil few.
So saying good men went about,
And everywhere such talk was rife,
Ere yet fell Nicholas let out
The waters of accursed strife.
Then nat ion against nation rose;
And prophecies of war no more,
Were answered, by embattled foes,
With clash of arms and cannon's roar.
The world has ever since been vexed
With battle, bloodshed, death, and pain,
We, lest the plague should reach us next,
Ourselves on constant watch remain;
So much our prophets' words were worth,
So vain a tale of hope they told!
The peoples yet are mad; the earth
Is full of violence as of old.
On either side this globe to scan,
And view the havock rampant there,
Man, clutching at the throat of man,
Of humankind might breed despair.
Oh, wretched end of modern light,
If men can work each other woe
For frenzied lust of rule, in spite
Of all those fratricides must know!
Now Science, which we hoped was given
That mortals Nature might subdue,
Is taxed for bolts that, farthest driven,
May crush their fellows, flving true;
And armour to defend the sides
Of the strong ship that keeps the sea,
Or that which Ocean's bosom rides
With purpose to enslave the free.
And here, e'en here, the fiend's hot breath
We feel, and hear the demon's hiss.
The taunt which, to the work of death,
Would fain provoke us, as remiss.
Despise it; let the world rage, friends;
Whilst unmolested, stand alone;
A Power above will shape their ends:
We '11 trust it to direct our own.

MISS ELLEN LYTTLE HUMBUG TO HER COUSIN, MISS FRANCES LYTTLE HUMBUG.
Tulip Cottage, January 16,1864.
Mr Sweetest Fan,
We are all exceedingly sorry that yon
cannot come to see us. and thus we two must
console ourselves with letters, though a very
bad and poor consolation, when we thought of
opening our heart into that of a loving and
faithful friend. But, alas! our hopes are nothing
but bubbles, as TurrER so beautifully and em-
phatically says.
Now I must tell you that Miss Bell Hookje
has come back from Paris last week: she has
been absent for six months, in order to com-
plete her cdacation, and has been staying with
a French lady of a very good old family, the
Casserolles; and, dear, you cannot fancy; no,
'ou can't, how frenchined Miss Bell has
mw.

Sometimes she seems quite to be lost in
French phrases, as "Par exemple," and " Com-
ment vous poriez-vous f "—and then, recollecting
herself, she begs one's pardon in the most
graceful manner. She told us a great deal
about the Empress and the French fashions.
No one can fancy, she says, what a rage there is
for/»r at present. Fur and Hair. She says, it
is astonishing to see, hear, and read the requests
for whiskers, auburn hair, blond curls, moustaches
and brotcn fronts. All the caps, Bonnets and
hats are trimmed with fur; and she described
to us some beautiful coiffures made of monkey-
tails, cats'-patcs, and a group of little grey and
white mice. Curley pigs'-tails are much worn
by ladies of distinction, and many donkeys'-

tails in the Emperor's household; stuffed rats,
fox-tails and groups of different vermin by
elderly ladies (spinsters and such like) and
dowagers, mothers-in-law, and maiden aunts.

Of lions'-paws and bulls''-fails the French
seemed not to be very fond. Miss Hoopoe
did not know or say, why not; but she was
quite sure, that a drawing-room full of fashion-
able ladies is one of the grandest sights in gay
Paris.
Do you remember Jane Efpie Goldfinch,
dear P Poor thing, now, since she has lost her
aunt, she has been obliged to go as a compagnon
to a Mrs. Trump who lives two miles from
here.
But, 'dearest Fan, what a life the poor girl
must lead! Mrs. Trump is always grumbling
and taking stomachic drops which smell just
like gin (I have heard so), and poor Jane Erne
has to read to her for hours together. And

fancy, Mrs. Trump does not care for the
political, or literary, or even for the fashion-
able news—oh, no! but the poor girl has to
read all the " Notices to Correspondents" and
all the "Advertisements." Then Mrs. Trumf
is in her best spirits, and often exclaims: "I
wonder who is that gentleman who wants the
plain cook at 115, Oxford Square:" or, " Who
is that respectable young lady who wishes for
a situation as barmaid: Fudge, Pooh, Stuff!"
or, "Please, my dear would you read those
'Notices of Marriage' again, my dear?"
So they go on for hours. Fancy, dear, I have
to read the Papers, too; but to Papa, who
likes but the political news; and now J nave a
sad time with all the German names and places,
and generals in those tiresome duchies, you
know, dearest, General Schinkenbero, and
Prince Blutwurst, and Prince Schingel-
stein. And then Papa says, they were all
good-for-nothings with their pipes and sauer-
kraut. 1 don't know, dear, but Papa says so.
Now, I wish I could tell you some more news,
but we have very little here. I must not forget
to mention that we are expecting our new
Curate in the beginning of February. We
have not heard much about him, but some
say he is auburn and wears nice long whiskers,

and is rather iiigr, not in stature but in
Church I mean, dear. Others say, that he is
married; but old Mrs. Crowbill, who has
seen a good deal of the world, says, "there is
not a greater public and political nuisance than
a married Curate who comes to a little place
where there are many nice-looking girls." So,
now I must finish, for I have to do up some of
Papa's neckties—but what does Sir Walter
Scott say, dcarP "In this critical age, filial
piety must hide herself in a closet, if she has a

mind to darn her father's linen." Therefore,
don't tell, dear! don't I With love to all. ever

cousin,

Add sarcasms and contradictions—
You needn't mind weighing the stuff.—

But any salt will do.
Any paper a case will make,'
And any A irk a handle;

Wet powder smokes more than dry—

And come down like the stick.

Leap Year Day, 1864, Monday. The Marquis op Westmeatii
(born 1784) has got it into his venerable old head that in spite of M.
Mazzini's denial that he had anything to do with the plot against the
life of the Emperor Napoleon, the ex-Triumvir was concerned in the
matter. This is the Marquis's "moral conviction," and he wanted to
know whether, if the Government shared it, anything could be done to
anybody under the Alien Act. Lord Russell had no such moral con-
viction, and was going to do nothing. The Marquis of Westmeatii
and the Marquis de Boissy have several points m common, only the
husband of La Guiccioli is the cleverer old goose of the twain.
Lord St. Leonard's "ran over" the Townley case, after which
gymnastic performance he intimated his dissatisfaction at that person's
escape from capital punishment. The discussion arose on the Insane
Prisoners Bill, which was read a Second Time, and may be considered
as the Law of the Future.
Mr. Layard explained to the Commons that the Danish Government
had acted with the utmost loyalty and good faith in the matter of a ship
that was building, on the Clyde, for Denmark, and which we had
detained, as we were bound to do, not being at war with Denmark'
enemy, Germany. We hope not to become entitled to let the vessel go.
Mr. Layard also made the House laugh at the expense of Mr. Darby
Griffith, who wished to know whether telegraphic messages were
printed among the despatches laid before Parliament. They never are,
or we should have some pleasant conundrums under the blue covers.
Then we had a personal scene. Mr. Stanspeld, Lord of Admiralty,
is an old friend of Mazzini. The Proeurevr du Roi, as he is called because
Louis Napoleon is King of France, if not of Paris, was good enough,
in the recent trial of Greco and his accomplices, to insinuate that an
English gentleman, and member of the Ministry, might be in some way
cognisant of the assassination plot. Mr, Stanspeld gave an indignant
denial of the base and lying charge, and though his doing so was about
as needless as ever was anything done by anybody, we do not regret it;
because Mr. Stanspeld had an opportunity of declaring in the manliest
way, that he was proud of the friendship of Mazzini, a declaration of
course involving a belief in the impossibility of Mazzini's knowledge of
the plot. But this did not please the Pope's friend, Mr. Hennessy.
who renewed the imputation against the Italian gentleman, and called
him "this person," and was also impertinent enough to ask Mr. Stans-
peld whether the "person" was the " Ma. Flower" spoken of by the
Frenchman, and whether Mr. Stansfeld himself had ever aided in
collecting money for the Italian patriots. On the first point Mr.
Stanspeld had no knowledge, to the second question he gave a
negative, though, had the reply been " Yes," most persons would have
added "and quite right too. Then Lord Claude Hamilton and
Alderman Rose asked other little questions, and the House, ashamed
of the scene, shouted "Don't answer!"
Mr. Disraeli made a long and fierce speech in abuse of Lord
Russell, and described the Ministry thus: The drivers have lost the
road, the reins have fallen from their hands, the horses are wild. Now,"
he said, " what is your foreign policy?" Lord Palmerston retorted
with considerable energy, termed the oration " a flash speech," and bade
the orator go on reading the Papers, and then he would find out what
he professed to want to know. Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald de-
clared that we were in a critical position, due to want of firmness, to
vacillation, and to alternation of bragging and subserviency on the
part of the Government. If these Opposition men believe a quarter of what
they say, are they not utterly betraying their trust, as Oppositionists,
in not moving a vote of want of confidence? What's the good of snap-
ping and barking, why not try a good bite in earnest ?—and then we shall
see what we shall see.
The Chancellor op the Exchequer fixed the Budget for Thursday
the 7th of April. Twopence off the Income Tax, Mr. Gladstone, or
you will see something in Mr. Punch's eye, on the 8th of April, which
will remind you of the eye which Seeva opened upon the octagonal
Rajah, vide tne end of Thalaba the Destroyer, by Robert Southey,
antepenultimate Laureate.

of Naval Architecture. You don't believe thai. But it is true, and
what's more, the models from Somerset House are to go there, and
Lord Clarence Paget will not undertake to say that the arrangement
shall be temporary. No wonder the few Members who could collect
their senses after such an announcement divided the Committee, but
the fact was, that the House was so stunned that the Government
triumphed over foes in a state of coma. A School for Shipbuilding at
South Kensington! Arrangements are to be made for launching the
vessels into the basin in the Horticultural Gardens, in front of Ma.
Durham's memorial, and if they don't sink, they are to be carried on
the tops of omnibuses to the Serpentine, and there put into com-
mission.
Tuesday. Lord Clanbicarde takes upon himself to be uncomfort-
able because certain Americans are trying to raise recruits in Ireland.
Does the ex-Privy Seal remember what a father said to his boy in
answer to the bitter's hint for a fishing-holiday. "Papa, they say the
trout are biting this morning." "Well, my boy, you stick to your work,
and then they won't bite you." Let Lord Clanricarde hold his
tongue until a Federal sergeant offers him bounty-money. Something
was said about the Fenians, and Lord Granville exactly characterised
that idiot demonstration. He said that it was utterly contemptible.
Lord Hartington stated that there was to be a grand trial of the
rival guns, Armstrong v. Whitworth. Could not this be made at
South Kensington, if the neighbours don't mind about their windows?
A School of Naval Gunnery might surely be .set up beside the one
already mentioned.
Mb. Marsh, ex-sheep farmer, complained that the Civil and Miscel-
laneous Estimates increased enormously. He was quite right. But
Fred Peel said that it couldn't be helped. And he is quite right too.
Wednesday. A Bill for testing Chain Cables, so as to ensure the
safety of vessels at anchor, was referred to a select committee, and
Mr. Punch earnestly hopes that all its members have done a little sea-
foing, and know something of the enormous importance of the question,
t is much more probable, however, that it is in their committee room
that they will find themselves at sea.
Thursday. Mb. Hopwood asked that letters put into the General
Post Office on" Sunday might be sent off on that day. Mb. Fred
Peel strongly objected to this very anti-Sabbatarian proposal, and said
that 20,000 letters would be posted, and 220 men required to dispatch
them—besides, the provincials would be bothering for similar privileges
Apropos of which subject, Sib Rowland Hill resigns his office.
If every person who has received a letter, for one penny, would contribute
one penny stamp (an organised collection, in every town, would be a
labour of love, not to say fun, for unemployed ladies and gentlemen)
we might present Sib Rowland with the most noble parting Gift ever
offered to a public man, and assuredly no public man ever deserved a
gift so well as the originator of the Penny Postage. He has done
more to civilise the country, and to promote its prosperity, than any
living man. Will he take a peerage P Probably not, but if he will, he
ought to be in the next Gazette as Lobd Queenshead. And the gift,
in addition, ought to make him still more like the Rising Sun (as was
neatly said) than ever. He ought to be able to tip every little H ill and
great Hill with gold. If the people do not show their gratitude, now,
we shall cut Britain, and bring Timbuctoo into her place in the scale
of nations. But we won't believe that our teaching and his have been
lost. Come, ladies and gentlemen, buy books and cards, and set about
your collection of stamps. You may print this paragraph for universal
distribution.
Evidently the Government does not regard the Yeomanry as the
most important portion of our defensive service. It is not to be called
out for its week of training this year, whereby £46,000 will be saved.
But the proposed arrangement occasioned a great fight in the House,
for manv Members are yeomanry officers, and the uniform is a handsome
one, and the Government was all but beaten—saving itself by one only
in a House of 315. Great shouting and counter-shouting. Mb. Brand
is said to have whipped splendidly, at the crisis, but then this was
said by an enemy, wno wanted to snow that Ministers were coming
to grief.
Blood being up, we had another shindy. Mb. Ferband, whose
amiable business it is to bring up wretched old grievances, which were
not much when they occurred, and are now utterly stale, nad a rigma-
role story about the Comptroller of the Navy havmg worn his uniform
and cocked hat at an election in 1859. This is the literal fact j Mb.
Ferband meaning of course that the official in question improperly inter-
fered in the contest. Sib J. Hay had a letter from Anmiui. Robinson
declaring the allegation to be false, and saying that Mrs. Robinson
having had an odd curiosity to hear Ferband bellow, her husband had
gone to the hall to escort her home. While in the place, not wishing
to appear singular, he probably laughed at Febband. Mr. Febrand
having also abused Sir Baldwin Walkeb, Lord Clabence Paget
defended him, and declared that he would rather take Sib Baldwin's
word than Mr. Fe brand's oath. This, of course, was out of order, and,
we shudder to write it, the awful punishment of'Taking the Words Down
was menaced, but Sib John Pakington humanely spared the country
the pain of so appalling a spectacle, by inviting Lord Clabence to
retract. He begged to substitute the strongest words that were
Parliamentary. Lobd John Manners complimented Mb. Ferband
on his "pluck and courage," on which Mr. Bern al Osborne said,
with exceeding good sense and manliness. "that he saw no pluck in
abusing an absent man, and could not call that courage which never
withdrew an unjust accusation."
Lord Hartinoton introduced the Army Estimates. The cost of
our Army, Madam, this year will be Fourteen Millions, Eight Hundred
and Forty Four Thousand Eight Hundred and Eighty Eight golden
sovereigns. If your boy has not behaved well at dinner, make him
bring that sum into shillings, and then into pence, and then tell von
how many pounds of mutton at tenpence the money would bring.
But don't think that we are extravagant, O no! We spent £215,349
more last year, we assure you. Make your obnoxious boy .tell you what
proportion that vast saving bears to the great sum.
Friday. Sib William Miles demanded Government recognition o
the exploits of Captain Speke. Lobd Palmeeston admitted them,
and made a sort of vixerefortes excuse for doing no more. Dr. Living-
stone (Cheers, and we nope that the gallant missionary is safe, and
will read this) had done much in Africa. Count Stbzelecki had done
much in Australia. He could not make an exceptional recognition.
Pam does not often talk red tape, but this was of the rosiest. Mb.
Newdegale hinted that Da, Bekb thought he had preceded Speke.
Theoretically, he had.
A very proper tribute was paid to the aged Hebrew gentleman, Sib
Moses Montefiobb, who has visited the Sultan of Mobocco, and has
obtained a strong firman, protecting not only Jews but all non-
Mahometan subjects of the Sultan from the oppression and cruelty of
which we have heard so much.
The Golway job has resulted in the muddle that was expected.
Mb. Gladstone has a Bill for turning Government into an Assurance
Office. The plan is for the benefit of the humbler classes, and Mb.
Potteb and tnat sort of persons are agitating against it, whence we
infer that the Bill is a good one, but we wait for the Chancellor's
own explification thereof.
Lord Palmebston, in reference to the Sooohow massacre, pleasantly
said that all nations had their faults, and those of the Chinese were per-
fidy and oruelty. He hoped that .the rebellion would cease, and the
Emperor's authority be maintained. Under the circumstances he
describes we don't seem to care much about it. Then the sea-doings
of the Confederates were discussed, and it appears that Government
intends to remonstrate with Mr. Davis. The awkwardness is that our
Remonatrator will probably be caught by the Federals, en route. But
this might be arranged. The Penal Servitude Bill was debated, and
read a Second Time. Ma, Hardy commented, with just severity, upon
the exceeding mildness of the punishments awarded by some of the
Judges, for the most atrocious outrages. We must hare a talk to these
extra-kind old gentlemen.
A REAL RUFFIAN.
Of all the sensation outrages of the day perhaps this kind of thing is
the most outrageous:—
"The up mall train on tho North Dovoa Railway on Monday night had a narrow
escapo. On arriving about a quarter of a mile beyond Yeoford the driver of the
engine saw an obstruction on the line, into which, before speed could be reduced,
the train ran. There were one or two severe jolts, but the train pawed safely, and
was immediately pulled up. The obstruction was found to have been caused by a
wooden gate, which had been unhung and placed across the rails, and upon its heap
of large stones had been piled. There was another gate close by across the line."
It turned out that a labourer named George Nott had laid these
obstructions, and been seized; he admitted his guilt and professed his
sorrow. We are happy to say that he is committed for trial, and as the
Insane Prisoners Bill will have passed before he gets into the dock, no
Dr. Cbankby Cracker will be able to save him by showing that his
grandmother was a little mad, and his maternal uncle was hoLT on idiot.
The hideous wickedness of such a crime demands a severer punishment
than even a good deal of pain, or else if Ma. Nott were well flogged at
each station on the line—and back again—the agricultural mind might
receive a desirable impression touching the toleration of Society for
such
Inquiring Wife to Learned Husband.
"Leah's a Hebrew word, like Eve, and Adam,
But what's its meaning, dear, I've no idea?"
"It means what London never will be. Madam,
Of seeing Miss Kate Batsman playing Leah."
Truly Gratifying.—Mb, Smith, who has lately subscribed five
shillings to the National Shakspearian Fund, wi&hea his name to appear

murderer who has destroyed human life, and justly forfeited his own, Society should
be burthened with his support for a long term of yearsI"
This question implies what I have always regarded as the strongest
argument for the gallows. It docs seem to be hard that Society should
have to support a murderer—or, let me add, any other scoundrel.
Therefore hang—whom? Any scoundrel, I say, who constitutes himself
a nuisance which hanging will abate at the least cost on the whole.
Hang burglars, forgers, pickpockets even, if hanging will do this—not
otherwise. If there is another punishment which will do this better
than hanging, substitute that other punishment. Don't hang for
hanging's sake; for the mere congruity of hanging to murder, if murder
can Oe better prevented than by hanging. Can it? Appearances indi-
cate that it can. They may require confirmation, but, if they are con-
firmed, then, I think, the inexorable logic of facts will coincide with
that of your humble servant, really and truly, In Terrokem.
P.S. The violent opponents of capital punishment certainly expose
themselves to be taunted with "mawkisli sentiment" by its violent
advocates. By "mawkish sentiment" the latter disputants appear to
mean what the former call the "milk of human kindness. Cant
against cant, Mr. Punch. Severity and wrath are as sentimental as
love and mercy; and mawkish sentiment on one side may be said to be
matched by acrid sentiment on the other. But how can anybody who
| despises those who object to hanging as milksops, despise the hangman F
Why is that officer an object of disgust to any person, if that person
approves of his office? Yet some of the steadiest supporters of the
gallows shudder at Jack Ketch. On a late occasion they shrank from
Calcraft; whereas if they regard lus function as wholesome, they
should have shaken him heartily by the baud.
A COMPLIMENT TO THE NAVY.
From a Sketch taken in Regent Street.
A SOCIAL POLICE CASE.
A KNOTTY POINT IN QUESTION.
Mr. Punch,—You will have seen that "Humanitas," in the Pott.
considers, and very fairly considers, my suggestion that perhaps penal
servitude, with the delightful extra of whipping, would be a preventive
of murder more effectual than hanging, and accordingly, may be worth
a trial. But he* deprecates that experiment, and takes exception to the
logic of my argument in its behalf. Please to observe, Sir, that my
proposition of it is conditional; rests on the supposition of the reality
of an apparent fact, which I do not pretend to be cock-sure of. But if
that apparent fact is a real one, and no mistake, then I stick to my
"argal." And this is what I say :—
A stop seems to have been put pretty nearly, for the present, to
garotte robberies by the recent Act wuich punishes them with whipping
m addition to penal servitude. Since the enactment of that statute we
have heard very little of them. But several murders have occurred
between then and now. Is it really the case that the number of murders
committed during that interval has exceeded the number of garotte
robberies? for, if so, it looks, at least, as if the cat-o' -nine- tails, super-
added to penal servitude has for the criminal more terrors than the
other form of hemp. For the murderer, indeed, I may say; because a
garotter is a murderer, in point of guilt, and the law hangs him for one
if he chances to kill his victim.
It is an early day, just now, to draw a conclusion which time" may
refute, but if we go on for some time hanging, whilst murders continue
to outnumber garotte robberies, there will surely be good grounds for
concluding that our punishment for garotte robbery is more effectual
than our punishment for murder.
"Humanitas" very justly remarks that "Hanging may not be so
cruel as penal servitude—real penal servitude, not pampering, with
flogging once a week." But the flogging which has been assigned to
garotte robbery, and seems to check it, is limited, I think, to thrice.
Will that, or less than that, do to check murder? As much as will do
is enough for every purpose but that of vengeance. One flogging may
suffice. Flogging, to the number of fifty lashes, lasts longer than
hanging; and there is reason to suppose that it is more painful.
Flogging may therefore be more formidable than hanging to some
people, and if those are the sort of people who are prone to commit
murder, it is better for Society that they should be flogged than hanged.
I fully admit the force of the argument thus put by Humanitas :"—
"It may not, perhaps, be beside the question to ask why, in the case of the
Between Law, Horsewhips, and an improved state of public feeling,
certain newspapers which used to live upon the sale of dirty scandal,
and upon hush-money paid for suppressing it, have been finally extin-
guished, and such of the conductors as have not been hanged or trans-
ported, have died outcasts. But a new device has just been contrived,
whereby the confidence of private life can be violated for the sake of
making money. We have not heard that cash has been paid for
suppression, but a publication to which Mr. Punch is about to refer,
owes any success it may have achieved to a shameless outrage against
social law. Some large and vulgar-looking pages arc issued (we regret
to say from the office of a highly respectable newspaper) and on these
are printed lithographic facsimile reproductions of letters, many of them
antiquated and harmless enough, but others—which are, of course, the
feature of the affair—the writing of living persons, who have given no
consent to such publication.
In one case a private letter, referring to a very delicate business, was
procured from a collector of autographs, on the solemn promise that
nothing but the concluding words of form and the signature should be
copied. The letter was reproduced in full, and a painful subject is
revived, years after it had been forgotten. Other letters have been
indignantly rescued from the clutche. of the person who had obtained
possession of them; but it is, of course, impossible to say whose private
confidence may next be sold for sixpence.
This sort of thing is far more objectionable than the old scandal-
publishing, because everybody knew that the editors of the dirty
journals were scoundrels, and everybody valued their tales accordingly.
But a man or woman's own handwriting is evidence of the authenticity
of the publication. Old thoughts, opinions perhaps hastily formed and
hastily expressed, and since abandoned, private feelings, forgiven
offences, regretted animosities—what may not be disinterred, and given
to the public, for whom the confidence was never intended?
The system.must be stopped, and Mr. Punch intends to do his best to
stop it. He has ample means of doing so in the manner most damaging
to the parties concerned. But he prefers giving a first avertiisement,
and begs to announce that if he hears of another publication of a private
letter, without leave from the writer, or his family, the reprisal will
not be to the advantage of the offending parties, "which their names
is not unbeknown," to quote Mies. Haiiris.
"Importing Denmark's Health and England's too."
These is a subscription on foot (though it is a beggar we should like
to see on horseback, if that would make it get on faster) for sending
money to the Danes who have been wounded by the German burglars.
Mr. Punch heartily commends it to the notice of all who have money to
spare. Wc rather wish that it had been introduced to the pubhc by
somebody else than the Marquis or Clanricarse, because, as Shax-
speahe elegantly says, he is more an Antique Ituin'un than a Dane, and
therefore we re-introduce it ourselves. Money to be sent to the Lord
Mansion House, E.C., and money will make the Mayor go
j the bankers.

as to Guineas I always call 'em Pounds; bay the word—iiebh's
my Bill at six months 1"
THE MONKEYS OF. ST. BENEDICT.
The essential sameness of Man with the Gorilla has lately been urged
with much vehemence by some gentlemen who perhaps in their own
persons afford the strongest proofs of it. A plausible argument in its
favour, however, may be adduced in the behaviour of that eccentric
creature called Brother Ignatius, which is highly simious. This eccle-
siastical oddity is said to be now performing his monkey's tricks at
Norwich, where he, and some companions of his own breed,; have set
up an establishment, in which they imitate monks. It is called the
"Priory of Sts. Mary and Dunstan," which of course one would, a
priori, take to be a Roman Catholic institution. Its inmates style
themselves friars of the "English Order of St. Benedict;" and a blessed
lot they appear to be. In the Timet we read that:—
"Although the weather haa been extremely inclomcnt this month, Brother
Ignatius sits in a room without a fire, goes bareheadod, and traversos muddy and
snow coverod streets with feet protected by rough sandals only. In fact every
possible austerity Is practised by him and the brethren, who hare received a few
additions to their order of lato."
Bv this account it would seem that, if these mimics do not beat real
monks, they whip themselves, or perhaps one another. Really these
proceedings are much the sort of conduct that might be expected of a
rather superior kind of anthropoid apes. If Brother Ignatius were at
Rome, he would be doing as the Romans do; but what would be his
reward? The Pope, perhaps, would not have him put into a cage and
exhibited, or send nun about with an organ-grinder to display his
imitative powers on a table. But Brother Ignatius, if he persisted
in aping the Regular Clergy, would very likely get shut up by the
Inquisition.
The formation of a sham Nunnery at Norwich has been contemplated,
and is only impeded by lack of funds. Should it be established, let us hope
that the game of Monks and Nuns will end by the former marrying the
latter, and thus, in the state of conjugal blessedness, constituting what
is the only genuine English Order of St. Benedict.
THE LAT OP DOTS! FERRANDO.
Don Ferrando Whiskerandos is a stout and stalwart knight,
Woe be to the recreant Whigling meets his trenchant blade in fight: •
Mounted on his great war-hobby, barded all in brass of proof,
Trampling facts and crushing figures underneath his iron hoof,
Rides this fearsome Don Ferrando, first a word and then a blow,
Seeking Ogres, setting Giants up that he may lay them low!
Don Ferrando never stayeth, whatsoe'er he cometh to—
Yawning gulfs of logic leapeth, truth's resistful bars breaks through,
Spurneth breeding's flimsy barriers, into flinders till they fly,
Ridicule's sharp caltrops braveth, and gives laughter the go-by.
Mail of argument he wears not, point of polished fence he scorns,
Of the awfullest dilemma, rushes, fearless, on the horns!
Let the English sing the praises of St. George, the worm that slew,
Let the Irish to the clairtach cliaunt Milesian Boru;
Let the Cymraeg, in their Triads summon Arthur from his cave;
Let the Scot for Wallace wight bid Attocn rhyme and Black, lb
rave;
But let Britain's House of Commons in its Don Ferrando still
Boast knight-errant more adventurous, bolder front, and blinder will!
If St. George destroyed the dragon, what's such deed of derring-do?
Don Ferrando, when he'd killed the dragon, would have eat him too!
If Boroihme, that mighty monarch, at Clontarf defied the Dane,
Don Ferrando thrice has routed all his foes—thrice slain the slain.
If King Arthur braved the Raven, and the Saxon crests laid flat,
Hath not Don Ferrando smitten Captain Robinson's cocked hat?
H wight Wallace wielded falchion, whereof none might brook the
blow,
What was Wallace's long broadsword to Ferrando's longer bow?
With a blare of brazen trumpets and a roll of hollow drums,
Such his pluck, he runs a-muck at all, and oft a "mucker" comes.
Be it Cotton-Lords or Poor Laws, Whiggish Admiralty's wrong,
Or the Charity Commission, into them he goes ding-dong.
Now non-tequitun he dodgeth, cleaveth now negaturs through,
H he miss a Pam to fight with, what of that P A Boase will do!
Like the Knights of the Round Table, Don Ferrando hath his quest,
'Twas the Holy-Grail they sought for, he still seeketh the mare's nest.
When the great mare's nest he findeth, 'tis a glorious sight to see,
How left and right the addled eggs he flingeth round him furioushe,
Since Don Quixote slit the wine-skins and the windmills' arras defied,
Ne'er was Knight like Don Ferrando, of fair Devonport the pride!
DEGRADATION OF THE FRANCHISE.
To Mb, Punch.
Sir,
Though a working-man, I am not a bigoted Tory. On the
contrary. I wish that with proper restrictions, the franchise should be
extended to all respectable persons, provided that they give evidence of
good sense enough to follow the example of their betters in the exercise
of their right of voting.
But, Sir, the line must be drawn somewhere, 'and our glorious Con-
stitution must not be impaired by mock liberalism.
I observe with regret that the Irish Peers are so far unmindful of
their station as to be agitating for an extension of the franchise by
which they elect representatives, and I am grieved to sec that the
leading journal, usually the exponent of the feelings of the respectable
part ot the population, is giving prominence to the complaints of these
unwise aspirants to the suffrage.
Education, Sir, should precede political privileges, and I sec nothing
in the attainments or abilities of the Irish Peers to justify the proposed
degradation of the suffrage. I am aware that there are some honourable
exceptions to the rule, but I must protest, in the name of our venerated
Constitution, against the conferring the suffrage upon a class that does
not appear to me fit to be entrusted with political power. We must
not open the flood-gates, nor break the dams that have made our nation
what it is, the envy of the world and the cynosure of surrounding
peoples.
Hoping that you will employ your powerful pen in resisting revolu-
tionary efforts like those of the misguided Irish Peers, I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,

Often has it been my duty to inculcate this upon my

years between them. They are too young to be sent to
school, and too precocious to remain any longer at home.
In casting about for some method of disposing of these
two little men, short of dealing with them after the manner
of the cruel uncle with the Babes in the Wood, my eye fell
upon the following advertisement:—

"Common Bones Dull."
We should like to know how the Tambourine is P and
will our interested readers unite in kind inquiries after the
general efficiency of the Banjo and Accordion. Why does
not the Uncommon Bones from the genuine Christy's
Minstrels emigrate, and enliven the Brazilians. If the
'Common Bones' is dull, he'd better leave, as he won't
have much chance of making a Lively-hood.
SHUTTING UP OUR SUNDAYS.
Among the score or so of deputations that daily pester poor Lord
Palmerston, there was one the other day composed of carpenters and
painters, and people of that sort, who have to get their living by their
skill in handicraft, and who requested that his Lordship would kindly
stand their friend in the matter of promoting healthy Sunday recreation.
It appears some pious persons are doing all they can to make people
hate Sunday, by keeping them within doors, or else forcing them to
church. The deputation represented that Sunday was the only day on
which a great part of the Nation could go and see the pictures which
happen to belong to it; and they thought if British workmen were
allowed on Sunday afternoons to see the paintings in Trafalgar Square
and the statues in Great Russell Street, their minds would not be
harmed thereby but sensibly improved, and they would be the better
able to compete with foreign workmen in the matter of skilled taste.
Lord Palmerston, replying with less truthfulness than tact, declared
that British works were not inferior to foreign in design or manufacture,
and with regard to throwing open the Museum and the Gallery:—
"With respect to the object of the deputation, he belleTed his opinions were pretty
woU known—(A^ar, hear)—but he must remind them that there was a Tery strong
feeling the other way. He thought the most prudent course to pursuo at present
was to remain passive until public opinion was brought round to the object in view,
and in the meantime he advised them to inculcate their opinions, and thus hasten
on the accomplishment of their desire."
Very good, Lord Palmerston. Then the way to get what is
wanted is to get the matter talked about, and the way to get things
talked about is to mention them in Punch. If your Lordship's opinions
about Sunday arc "well known," so too arelfr. Punch's, which happen
to agree with them. Mr. Punch, however, cannot "remain passive,"
as you tell the working men to do, and see them robbed of Sunday by
the Sabbatarian fanatics, without feeling his fingers itch to take his cudgel
up and lay about him lustily. The fanatics once tried to rob the poor
man of his Sunday beer, but Mr. Punch stepped up in time to stop
their brutal act. No doubt the fanatics would like to rob the poor man
altogether of his liberty on Sunday, but Mr. Punch will not keep
passive, while they attempt to do so. If the fanatics had their own way,
nobody would be allowed to leave his house on Sunday except to go
to church, and his regular attendance there they would compel by the
Police. Pious people, who are rich of course, can stay at home and see
their pictures on a Sunday: but to throw open a gallery for the pleasure
of poor people, would be such desecration of the Sabbath as all proper
minds must shrink from and indignantly condemn.
If it be found sinful to improve one's mind on Sunday, by all means
let Museums and such places remain closed. But till the sinfulness is
shown him, Mr. Punch will not believe in it: nor will he "remain
passive " while the sinfulness, as he thinks, is wickedly assumed. A
man who works hard for six days at a monotonous employment needs
in some way recreation as well as rest upon the seventh, and looking
at good pictures is as innocent a pleasure as well can be devised for
him. By a reductio ad absurdum the truth is often to be reached. If it
be wrong to see such things as Turner's landscapes on a Sunday, it
may fairly be contended that it must be likewise wrong to see the
fields and trees and sunshine which Turner loved to paint. For the
mere sake of consistency, the people who keep shut our picture
galleries on Sunday should endeavour to do something towards keeping
Nature's pictures also from the public sight. The Universal Nature
Sunday Closing Movement would find doubtless many fanatics quite
ready to support it; and if it be found difficult to prevent the flowers
from blooming and the sun from shining on the first day of the week,
at least a trial might be made, by multiplying the police, to keep people
in their houses except during church-time, and to make them all
walk blindfold when they went to church.

NEWS OF THE WORLD.
Under the above heading, I engaged to furnish you (at least I think
it was you, for my memory is so unfortunately treacherous, that I can
scarcely carry anything in my head for more than two consecutive
hours) with a summary of the most interesting Home and Foreign
Intelligence. In setting my correspondence before the public you will
be, I nave no doubt, greatly taken with my peculiarly abrupt style;
this, if you will, you may attribute to my intense admiration of the
works of Doctor Laurence Sterne: and, if you will not, then you
must be good enough to consider that ..... (At this moment the
servant has just come in to ask me if I dine at home to-day)
I take up my pen again: I find that I have lost the thread of my narra-
tive: stay, it was not a narrative, no, allow me. I will just read
over what I have already written To resume; you
must be good enough to consider, that for a man gifted with such a
short memory as myself (I make no boast of my powers) to carry all
the news of the world in his head is almost an impossibility. Besides
the work that I am doing for you, I have also in hand a Treatise on
Algebra, an historical novel of the Lorenzo de' Medici period, a plot or
two for farces, a tragedy, and other lighter pieces; a complete refutation
of the Gnostic heresy, a new song for a soprano, and a Treatise upon
the Potteries of Peru, considered with regard to Dr. Colenso's theory
of Mosaics, and a few other papers for various mggazines, entering
fully into the political aspect of the leading theological problems of the
day.
Of course you edit all the matter sent in very carefully, so if you
should find among my contributions to your paper, any MSS. of mine
touching upon any of the above subjects, would you kindly send them
back to me, as they are sure to be of the utmost importance to
Yours very truly, Matthew Muddle.
P.S. The housemaid has been what she calls "setting my room to
rights," an operation which has thrown all my papers into the neatest
Eossible confusion. I haven't time to look over the parcel, but I can't
elp thinking that I've sent with those intended for your periodical a
sheet or two of the Historical Novel, or the Gnostic Heresy, or the
Algebraic Treatise, or something. Please return them immediately. M. M.

Chit-chat and General News.—During the past week the Serpentine,
frozen from end to end, has presented a gay and festive appearance.
Skaters cutting figures of eights and nines might have been seen . . .
No; by the way that was the week before, or the one previous to that;
at least I fancy there must have been ice somewhere about that time, as
I recollect a little boy saying to me—a dirty little street-boy saying to
me, such a capital thing, really sharp and clever as those little fellows
do sometimes, about .... dear me! how very strange, I had it on
the very tip of my pen just now—well, I dare say it will soon come
back, and tis just as good whether told sooner or later.
The Prussian question has been of course in everybody's mouth,
I mean the Danisn question, or German, or—you know all about it.
In a private letter from abroad, I hear that the Italian plot in Paris
against the Emperor Louis IS afoleon, was organised by Bernardo
Nardi, one of the Florentine citizens who had been exiled from his
countryinthe timeof PiETRODE'MEDici^accompanied byabouta hundred
of his partisans, surprised the Gate of Prato on the 6th of April, 1470.
In the same year, namely, 1470, anot her conspiracy was formed against
Galeazzo Sforza, under the leadership of Mazzini, who, however, as
we have read in the Times, disavows all complicity in the affair. The
theatres are all doing well, and the opera of She Stoops to Conquer
shows that a man like Mr. , I forget the composer's name; but
1 think he is some relation of that eminent comedian, Mr. Farren.
Well, I was going to say, that this play proves that the text of Shak-
spere has suffered from the witless introduction of vain, unthinking
actors. And, if the theatres were only made more comfortable, so that
one should not be cooped up in a little-ease of a stall, or tortured in a
seat of the dress circle, why, there can be no doubt that Jeremy
Taylor, Sherlock, and other divines, who interpret this passage in a
sense totally contrary to that attributed to it by Doctors Tittman,
Beveridge, and even the great Saint Hieronymus himself, were
unable to obtain a sight of the original Chaldaic version, ana have,
therefore, made a fierce attack upon Tertullian, who clearly says, as
I see by the advertisements, that the Colosseum, in the Regent's Park,
is closed, and so there is one popular place of amusement the less in
town. I suppose the ascending-room will be sent to one of the new
grand hotels for the convenience of the lodgers in the attics—seventeen
storeys above the level of the street. There is to be a Volunteer

FABLES FROM THE FRENCH.
The old story that we English sell our wives in Smithfield, and live
on raw beef steaks, doubtless still contiuues to be prevalent in France.
Electric telegraphs and steam-boats have apparently done little for our
friends across the Channel in the matter of improving their acquaintance
with Great Britain, and enlightening their ignorance of us and our
affairs. Here for instance is a statement which our friends have doubt-
less generally accepted as a truth: we quote it from the Paris corre-
spondent of the Daily Telegraph, who is speaking of an article by a
French dramatic critic which has recently appeared:—
M As an instance of how perfectly English Society is understood by
writers, I must tell you tbat I read in this same art icle that at the ' French play'
in London, the laughter follows some minutes after the joke, as the English cannot
see the point till they have looked in the dictionary."
We almost wonder that the Frenchman did not proceed to say that,
to save our swells the trouble of looking in their dictionaries, a number
of interpreters were always kept in readiness, and were let out just like
opera-glasses at half-a-crown a night. And he might as well have added
that the actors all stopped speaking after every speech, until it had
been properly translated to the audience. How such pauses would im-
prove the effect of a stage dialogue it were needless to assert; but the
assertion might as well be made by a French writer, as being for its
truthfulness a fit sequel to the statement that we quote above.
Again, here is another still more startling tale about ns, which we
cite from that surprising newspaper Le Sport:—
"There are from 3,000 to 4,900 ballet-girls in London, and a purveyor of eccentri-
cities (un entrepreneur cCexcentricite"*) is contemplating an arrangement with the
Palace of Crystal for an exhibition, at which a magnificent prize will be adjudged to
the fairest."
A show of babies might perhaps be permitted here in England, but he
would be a bold man who would venture to suggest that we should
have a show of ballet-girls. How would highly proper Clapham de-
nounce the dire suggestion! What immense cascades of virtuous
indignation would be spouted at the bare idea of such an exhibition!
What tremendous force of evidence would every British husband have
to bring to prove an alibi, were he accused at home of having gone to
such a show! Besides, where is the man brave enough to inspect four
thousand ballet-girls and decide which is the prettiest and should bear
away the prize? Paris, we suspect, had a rather scurvy time of it with
Juno and Minerva, after he awarded the apple to Miss Venus. But
the judge who should preside at the show which Le Sport speaks of
would have four thousand (barring one) offended deities to pacify, and,
we repeat, where is the Paris who would undertake the part?

CANARDS.
Some of the French Papers we find, upon the authority of an English
weekly contemporary, have been filling up their "valuable space " with
short paragraphs of the most startling penny-a-lining description.
Anecdotes of oysters which have leaped furiously upon their aggressors,
are among the mildest of these marvellous accounts. We present the
following to the notice of any Parisian Editor whose eye they may
catch, and we do not hereby reserve the right of translation.
The Musical Fish.—A. well-known Naturalist residing in Rue de
M fancying that he heard a sweet musical voice singing portions
of Mozart's Twelfth" in his kitchen, descended to the lower
regions for the purpose of ascertaining to whom among the domestics
this enchanting organ belonged. There was no one below-stairs; but
on the dresser was sitting a red herring, recently purchased, from whose
mouth proceeded the most dulcet strains. The nsh did not notice his
approach, being entirely wrapped up in a piece of music-paper, containing,
as it appears, that portion of the great composer's works which he haa
just been practising.
A Lady in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate was the other day
engaged in the delightfully refreshing pastime of picking periwinkles
out of their native shells by the ingenious method of applying a pin.
One of the creatures becoming furious at this intrusion upon his domain,
flew wildly at his tormentor, and bit her savagely on the lower jaw.
Assistance was speedily obtained, but not before the ferocious fish,
(there is no doubt now but that it was quite mad), had left its marks
on the legs and arms of two other ladies who had been similarly occupied.
It was subsequently conducted before the Magistrate at Thames
Street, who happening to be taking liis tea at that hour, immediately
eat it.
Banger of Eating Hard-boiled Eggs. Fearful Tragedy—-The other
morning as Mr. Mjvtjjs was sitting down to breakfast, he espied an
hard-boiled egg on the table. On gently attempting to crack its shell
with his spoon, the egg leaped up and hit him so violently between the
eyes as to cause internal hemorrhage of the triennial com. A little boy
happening to be looking in at the window, immediately alarmed the
neighbourhood with loud cries of "Ah! Balloon! Ah Bal-loon!"
Before, however, medical assistance could be procured, the unfortunate
gentleman fell a victim to his misplaced confidence. He was taken in
a cab to St. Paul's, where, after paying something over the usual fare,
he was interred with one solemnity. While the organ pealed forth its
grand farewell, there was scarcely a dry eye anywhere for miles round.
The festivities were not concluded until a late hour, and all returned
home thoroughly satisfied with the efforts made for their amusement.

GROSS IGNORANCE OF HEBREW.
UR Police Reports are
generally dull, now
that stipendiary Ma-
gistrates vervjseldom
make ridiculous re-
marks or pronounce
absurd or atrocious
sentences, and the
representatives of Jus-
tice Midas, and Judge
Jeffries in a small
way, arc to be found
only amongst the
Great Unpaid.
A case, however,
occurred the other
day at the Thames
Police Court, which
lias doubtless afforded
those who have read
it as fully reported in
the Morning Pott
much diversion; not,
however, by any means
at the expense of the
Magistral e who adju-
dicated thereon; but
at that of quite another
party.
Sacrilege, to be
sure, is no laughing
matter, and no mirth
can be excited, in any well-regulated mind by the statement that:—
** Ciiarles Evans, agod 29, was charged with burglary at tho Jews' Synagoguo,
Great Prescott Street, Wbitechapel, and stealing from "tho Ark" five scrolls of
parchment, containing the fivo books of Moses (PentatouchX valued at £00 or £70."
This was simply a grave charge of violating the sanctity of a place of
worship, and stealing property appraised at a very serious sum, and
perhaps worth much more. What would not Bishop Colenso, or
indeed any other Bishop understanding Hebrew, and wishing to know
all that he ought to know, give for an authentic MS. of the Pentateuch?
But it appears that the gentleman accused of taking Mosaic articles
frpm the Great Prescott Street Synagogue, conveyed them to the wrong
market; and herein lies what will perhaps be regarded as the fun of
this otherwise merely disgraceful aflair. To resume the report thereof:—
"Nathan Abrahams, roader at tho Synagogue, locked up the Chnjicl at six
o'clock on Wednesday evening, and on going there the foUowing morning ho found
tho back window open, and that tho five parchment scrolls had been rcuiovod from
tho Ark. They were bouud with silk, and covered with silk mantles, and there
was an ivory pointer on tho scrolls used in reading the Hebrew. He identified tho
silk and pointer producod as those bolonging to the serous."
The testimony of Nathan only went to the disappearance of the
Pentateuch from the Ark. But then:—
"Emmanuel Abrahams, of Cable Street, said he purchased tho silk and ivory
pointer of the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock on Thursday for 2«. 2d.
There were three pieces of blue silk, three pieces of ribbon, and'six pieces of yellow
silk."
No one, surely, but a man far too innocent to be a thief would
have taken such property for sale to the shop of Mr. Abrahams, who
proceeded to state what the accused must clearly have been ignorant of,
namely, that:—
"He was a Jew, and had seen ivory pointers like that at Jows' Synagogues, but
he did not know what they were till a neighbour, named Rosenburu, told him.
About an hour after, a man came from the Synagogue, and he producod the things
which were afterwards delivered to the police. That morning he was sent for to
the Synagogue, and on his way home he coiled at a coffee-shop and saw prisoner,
and gave him into custody."
What an absurdly simple fellow the alleged thief with a Christian
name must have been if he actually went to dispose of the appurtenances
of a stolen Hebrew Pentateuch to the repository of a Hebrew mer-
chant! Of course the Synagogue knew where to send for them. To
carry them there was just walking into the lion's mouth. It is rather
strange that this view was not exactly that taken by the presiding
Magistrate; so that:—
"Mr. PARTRinoE expressed his 'disgust that a Jew attending Synagoguo should
have bought such articles, and said he should not allow tho witness his expenses."
It must be allowed, however, that the light in which the case thus pre-
sented itself, in relation to the witness, certainly does in some degree
coincide with that in which it was represented by the accused:—
"Prisoner said he bought the things of a man in Petticoat Lane for Is., and tha
he had been told by Emmanuel Abrahams to bring him property at any time, wlietlier
he obtained it right or wrong."
the latter of these assertions, he disbe-
litted the prisoner'for trial. But those
H Mr. Partridge credite<
lieved the former; as he cor
who adopt what we may suppose to have Seen the Migistrate's opinion
on both of those points will not fail to recognise, in the abstraction of a
Pentateuch from ten Ark in a Synagogue, and the conveyance of its
furniture to such an establishment as that of Mr. Abrahams, a striking
proof of the connection between deficient education and crime. Any
but a very ignorant fellow would have known that, whatever might be
the rule at that emporium, there were some exceptions, and
would at least include the goods of the Synagogue.

When some long-standing brazen-faced job to i

And a zealous Reformer, or Minister bold
Takes the bull by the horns, out this Bogie is
From under the vest ry-room table.
"He's on us, is Centralisation!
Police! Here comes Centralisation !—
He wears wooden shoes,
And cats frogs and ragouts,
And will, straight, make Mossoos of the nation!"
Of their ill-gotten gains would you squeeze some fat board,
That has oattened on snug peculation?
From publicity's bull's-eye throw light on the hoard
Where the gains of some ancient Trusteeship are stored,
Or the spoils of some grey corporation P
"To the rescue! Here's Centralisation!
Thieves! Robbery! Wrong! Conliscation! ^.

The Palladium they'd steal,
With the jemmy of Centralisation !/'
When Bumbledom, big in belligerent pride,
Hands Paup'rism o'er to starvation,
Or has lifted its heel to spurn Misery aside
With so hearty a kick, that Gaunt Misery has died,
(As it will do, for sheer aggravation),
Inquiry is Centralisation!
The Poor-Law Board—Centralisation!
Bumble scorns their Inspectors—

And minions of CENTRALISATION!
Is a sewer to be made, a foul trade to be stopped
Inifull swing of its fragrant vocation P
Some plague-smitten court to be drained, sluiced, and mopped?
Some fever-nest purified, upas-tree lopped,
Whose shadow is death's ambush-station?
"Hands off with your Centralisation!
Saws and axes are Centralisation!
Better, self-governed still,
Leave the fever to kill,
Than the door ope to Centralisation!"
Now, when Gladstone brings thrift to each working bee's cell,
To guard toil's savings against spoliation,
Offers help that for agelabour's nest-egg may swell,
Prom roguery of rogues, and fool's folly as well
Guaranteed by the faith of the nation—

But don't save us by Centralisation!"

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
in able Punch,—When. Lord
Bybon wrote Manfred, he ra-
ther plumed himself upon the
notion that he had written
something that nobody could
act. But his Lordship was
mistaken, as Mb. Phelps has
shown, and Drury Lane is
crowded nightly by people who
applaud with fair discrimina-
tion his fine reading of the part.
After all, you see, good poetry
has still a hold upon the
public, in spite of the sensa-
tion stuff wherewith they have
been dosed. An awkward fact
is this for croakers who com-
plain of the degeneracy of the
age, and the downfall of the
drama, which every dozen years
or so is said to be extinct.
But the drama has a cat's vitality about it, and, though continually
talked of as going to the dogs, it somehow always manages to retrace
its steps.
Another old play has been recently revived at the Princess's, and one
almost as difficult as Manfred to be played. Were Shakspeare living
now, I fear his Comedy of Errors, if critically spoken of, would be con-
demned as a mere farce. Although dramatic critics now-a-days are too
much prone to write on rose-leaves with a dove's-quill dipped in treacle,
I apprehend that such a "comedy" would at least be mildly censured
as much overstrained in humour and improbable in plot: and Mr.
Shakspeare might be gently recommended for the future to confine
himself to tragedy, and not to show his versatility by failures of this
sort. However, a judicious application of the pruning knife has, by
Mr. Viking's counsel, cut the five acts down to one; ana so the farcical
construction of the play is not so censurable, now it is reduced to the
proportions of a farce. The two Dromios are acted by two brothers,
surnamed Webb, who in face and voice and person are so closely like
each other that one is really apt to wonder how they know who's who,
or which of them is which. People who are fond of being puzzled ana
bewildered should go to the Princess's, and try and guess which brother
is before them in each scene. If they did so I think nine times out of
ten they would guess wrongly, and the errors of the Comedy would
fairly be exceeded by the errors of the audience.
No doubt you have observed that, with other noble swells, Lord
Dundreary has returned to his Town house for the Season. A writer
in the Header informs me, that his Lordship, on the evening he came
back to us, "was welcomed by a crammed and enthusiastic audience."
I wonder, had they all been dining at the' Mansion House, and there
been surfeited with turtle and stuffed with salmon, jenison, iced punch
and champagne, and all the other dainties wherewith Lord Mayors
cram their guests. A crammed house I have heard of, but it is quite a
novelty to hear of a crammed audience, and I thank thee, gentle Reader,
for saying something new. By the bye, I wish his Lordship would give
up his silly tricks of stumbling against people and tumbling into
ladies' laps. He excites enough of laughter without stooping to such
clownisms, which, though they may please the gallery, offend the stalls
and boxes, and are excrescences quite foreign to the nature and the
humour and refinement of the part. One; looks for gag and claptrap
tricks from actors who have not the brains to win applause without
them; but Mr. Sothern is too clever to require such stage appliances,
and he should not forget that Lord Dundreary is a gentleman, and that
the faintest smack of coarseness is as much out of his character as it
would be for a sailor to walk out in top-boots.
At billiards only two are enough to play the Pyramid: but at the
Gallery of Illustration three players are required for it, and their varied,
style of playing is really worth a look. It is natural of course to find
Reeds by the Nile, and, if the scenery be as tempting there as Mr.
Telbin paints it, one can't wonder Mb. Parry, who is intensely fond
of sketching, should be found there also. What smart dresses they all
wear, and what smart sayings they all say, your imaginative readers
may think they can conceive- but I fancy if they pay a visit to the
Gallery they will own that their conceptions fall snort of the facts.
Some cynics growl and snarl at entertainments like the Pyramid,'on the
ground that, being judged from a dramatic point of view, there is too
much talking in them, and too little plot and action. But to find fault
with entertainments because they are not plays, is pretty much as
sensible as complaining of plum pudding for not Deing roast beef. The
Pyramid has plenty of good writing for its base, and I doubt not, will
stand firm on it for many a month to come. The only fault I find with
it is, that a piano appears upon the stage in Mb. PASRY'spresenee, and
somehow Me. Parby escapes having to sit down to it. However, after
the piano has been brought home from the Pyramid, the charming
Mrs. Roseleaf gives her little evening party with it, and the efforts of
her friends, Mr. Yeanay and Miss Gushingion, together with the stolid
man who thumps out the quadrilles, quite make, up for any musical
shortcomings in the Pyramid itself.
One of the critics, we observe, was kind enough to discover a new
merit in the Pyramid. He stated that it was the author's first dramatic
attempt. We do not know whether the theatrical profession rubs its
eyes, in private life, when exceedingly surprised, Dut if so, we can
imagine Mrs. Keeley, Mrs. Stirling, Mr. Wigan, Mr. Charles
Mathews, Mr. Webster, and a distinguished circle of brother and
sister artists performing that feat, on reading the above intelligence.
Indeed wc know that one of them was so excited at the information as
to break into epigram, and say, "Well, the Standard-bearer may keep
the Minstrel's watch, but does not keep his own upon the stage." But
criticism is an art of a peculiar character.
One who Pays.
PERIL OF PETTY TYRANNY.
The rational Members of the House of Commons who are concerned
to preserve personal liberty from the curtailment with which it is
threatened by officious agitators itching to regulate other people's
habits under pretence of promoting sobriety in days of decreasing
drunkenness, are implored to take notice that, in the absence of all of
them except a minority, Mr. Lawsox, the Member for Carlisle,
obtained leave to bring in a Bill for a Permissive Liquor Law, which
will, if it passes, enable a fussy knot of busy-bodies in any district to
keep it in a state of perpetual disquiet, by canvassing to bother the
inhabitants into voting for the closure of public-houses. In districts
amongst whose inhabitants certain fanatics predominate, it will actually
subject the reasonable remainder to privation of beer.
In the absence of the rational majority of the House of Commons,
Mr. Lawsox succeeded in getting his Liberty Restriction Bill read a
First Time.
The rational Members of the House of Commons are earnestly
requested to take care that Mr. Lawsos's Bill for subjecting English-
men to the despotism of an American Liquor Law, shall not be read a
Second Time. It will be, in May, unkss they look out, and muster in
force on the evening appointed for its Second Reading; which may be
changed.
"Shall I not take mine case hi mine inn?" "No!" savs the
faction represented by Mr. Lawsox. It rests with the Collective
Wisdom to outvote the Collective Polly, and say, " Yes!"
THE BANTING CODE.
Some glutton has stated that brave Mr. Banting
Himself has succumbed to the system he taught.
'Tis false, and he lives, neither puffing nor panting,
But down to a hundred and fifty pounds brought.
He's done it, and so may each overfed nigger
Who '11 simply adopt resolution severe
To avoid, if he wouldn't grow bigger and bigger,
All bread, butter, sugar, milk, tatoes, and beer.
Take a fresh lease of life, and commence a new era,
Mb. Banting's advice makes one long to begin—
"Drink claret and sherry, good grog, and Madeira,
Take four meals a day and—grow gracefully thin."
YOUR FRIEND POTTER.
Who is the Mr. Potteb, who is heading an agitation against the
proposed measure of Government, to provide real Life Assurance for the
working man? Is this the George Potteb who, some time ago,
Secretary to the Trades' Union, figured as the Coryphajus of workmen
on strike P Is this the Potter in whom they put their trust P If so,
their Potter is doing his best to pot them. But if there was once a
time when they were as clay in the hands of the Potter, that time must
be past now, and their Potteb will no longer mould them to his purpose,
if that purpose is to befool them into preferring untrustworthy to sound
assurance. It always appeared evident that Mr. George Potter had
some assurance of his own; but that will now be more obvious than
ever if it is the Potteb of the strike who is trying to oppose Mr.
Gladstone's scheme to secure the working man a provision for his old
age and his survivors, and to save him from swindlers. If the Trades'
Union Potter does not come forward, and disown identity with the
Potter whose exertions are directed to deprive the labouring classes
of a safe Life Assurance, he will find himself pointed at as he goes
about. The remark that everybody who knows him will make to the
working man will be: "That *s your friend Potter!" All the working
men who suffer themselves to be led by such a Potter, will be looked
upon as the very emptiest of Potter's vessels.

IN RE JOWETT!
What!
Eay a salary to Jowett?
low it!
That heretic—arch-heretic, indeed—
One of those rogues who recommends his creed
By honest work and modest learning!
A villain, a perverter of our youth—
One who, like Pilate, dares ask "What is truth?"
A sinner, who if all folks had what's fair,
Instead of a Professor's chair,
Should have a stake and faggots piled for burning.
What! pay a salary to pernicious Jowett?
N ot if I know it!
Learning is dangerous: the works of Jowett
Show it.
But as we can't remove him from his chair,
For want of Greek, or diligence, or care,
Or any act involving blame or scandal,
It is our duty as spiritual pastors,
Guides of the youth, o'erlookers, teachers, masters,
To gag this trumpeter of "the march of mind,"
To use the first extinguisher we find
To put out so pestiferous a candle!
So to the pack that howls at heels of Jowett,
What I say's, "Go it!"
Heresy's seed is rank! Shall Jowett
Sow it?
Tell me not, sciolists, Greek's not theology:
As if there's not a heterodox philology
That can be wrapped up cunningly in articles,
Impregnate accents, prepositions, particles,
Poisoning texts as strychnine poisons wheat.

"What's toxicology to do with farming?
And peck, and peck, and drop dead as they eat.
E'en so Greek roots poisonea may be by Jowett,
And who's to know it?
Therefore, as for the salary of Jowett,
Stow it!
The wolf is in the fold beyond a doubt,
And we, alas the while! can't drive him out.
But as to one point we 're determined, flat,
On our lost muttons he shall not wax fat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
Society has "long felt the want," to quote any modem Prospectus, of
a Conversational Guide. You meet your dearest friend; and displaythe
most tender interest in the state of his health by inquiring, " Ah! How
are you?" To which Dearest Friend returns, by way of answer, "Ah!
How are you?" and there the matter ends. It is all one to both as if
the reply had contained the most ample information upon the subject.
Everything must have a beginning,) and this will serve as the initiative
step in a conversation.
Some J people are utterly flustered and dumfounded on being sud-
denly met, and after the first greeting which may be as above, remain
silent, each nervously waiting for the other to begin. Perhaps the next
movement is for both to speak at once, and then for each to withdraw
bis words in favour of the other.
A sees B. in the street; he doesn't particularly wish to speak to him,
and has nothing of any especial consequence to say to him, yet he finds
himself compelled, as if by a sudden inspiration, to stop him.
A. (stopping B. and taking his hand). Halld! How are you?
B. (whosepouters of'thought are immediately prostrated). Ah! How
are you?
[Awkward pause, during which A. begins to wish that he had only
nodded and passed on, and B. is considering what novel observa-
tion he can make.
A. You're looking well.
This is said in a tone implying that tthe speaker isn't to be taken in
by mere outward appearances, and that there is no use in his friend's
saying he's very well if he isn t.
B. Yes, I am very well.
This is boldly outspoken, albeit somewhat rashly, as he straightway
remembers that he has been laid up with sciatica for the last ten days : so
he delivers himself of a sort of corrected copy of his former statement.
B. {confusedly). When 1 say I am well, 1 mean I haven't been well
lately.
(It is evident of course that he never meant anything of the sort).
Another awkward pause ensues, after which A., finding that.his friend
manifests no interest whatever in hi* physical condition, volunteers the
following information.
A. Well, I've not been near so well lately as I might.
This conveys the idea that he might have been better in health if he had
liked, but he didn't choose to take a mean advantage of his privileges.
And here it may be noted that if you tell an invalid that you yourself
are far from well, he immediately takes it as a personal affront to him;
a piece of coolness on your part in intruding upon his unhealthy domain
not for a moment to be tolerated. It is not unlikely that the slight
mention of your complaint will make him literally boast of his physical
infirmities. You've had a headache you tell him: "Ah," returns the
invalid, "but you don't have pains shooting right through the head, and
all over the leye, like sharp knives. That's a headache, if you lie,"
says he, as if it was something to be rather proud of than otherwise.
You humbly admit his immense superiority in this respect, and piously
express a hope that you may never know his sufferings. Yet somehow
or another even as you speak you are dissatisfied with yourself, and
would .like to be on an equal footing, or rather, heading, with him;
failing that, you set him downjfor a bit of a humbug, a man who makes
"such a fuss about a mere bilious headache." You congratulate your-
self that you are really as ill as he is, only you won't show it, ana are
bearing up like a martyr, while you can't help feeling annoyed with him
for trying to obtain sympathy under false pretences.
To continue; B. doesn't wish to hear A.'s symptoms, so observes, that
** he is afraid that he is rather in a hurry." Why "afraid?" Whv
"rather in a hurry?"
By the way there are some men who arc always in a hurry. That
fellow Twinch knocks at the door of my chambers, " must see me im-
mediately," I hear him say in the passage, and in he rushes.
"Hallo, Twinch!" I say, " sit down."
"Can't sit down," says Twinch, placing his hat upon the table and
immediately taking it up again. "Can't stop a moment. I only just
looked in to see how you are."
I thank Twtnch, and offer him a cigar.
"No, No, No! can't! haven't time," says Twinch, shaking his
h*ad fussily and walking to the window, out of which he stares for five
minutes at the pump or the porter in the court below, while I continue
my work.
"Well," he savs, presently clapping his hat on his head, "I must
go." With that he places himself with his back to the fire spreading
out his coat-tails. 1 go on steadily with my pen, taking no notice.
"I won't disturb you, now," says Twinch, after a silence of about
three minutes, during which he has been gazing up at the topmost and
dirtiest window-pane, "I see you 're busy."
"No, not very," I tell him, for courtesy's sake.
"Ah! but / am!" returns Twinch, rousing himself and hurrying to
the door, which he partially opens, Must be off. Most important,
—most important." This he says while rattling the door-handle. (I can't
bear anybody rattling a door-handle.)
"Where are you goingP" I ask.
"Eh! Oh! Ah! well I don't quite know; but I can't stop."
"But what are you going/or/"'
"I don't know, but it's most important—most important. Good bye."
And with a bang of my door (can't bear a man who bangs my door) he
is off.
Not for good; oh, no. He returns in something under five minutes
and pops his head in.
"What nowf" say I.
"Oh!" the exclamation invariably serves him as a sort of apology,
"I wanted to ask you if you know a fellow of the name of Mumpton,
John Mumpton, eh.P"
I own that I have never even heard of Mumpton.
"Ah!" Now he's rattling the handle with one hand and some keys
in his pocket with the other (can't bear this trick). "Ah!" he repeats,
with the air of a man who had been utterly thrown out of all his calcu-
lations by an unexpected discovery. "Then you don't know Mumpton
—John Mumpton. Ah! well! it doesn't matter, or else it might be im-
portant. Mustn't stop any longer!" And off he goes again, this time
m real earnest.
It is all through Twinch that I have gone astray. The present writer
set out intending to give you many valuable and useful hints upon Talk
for Travellers, a kind of pocket Ilinerarium containing what to say and
how to say it, but on his road he met with a—Twinch "with his Roley
Poley," or something no less idiotic than that insane chorus; and so
having been thus delayed, he can only safely promise more hereafter
upon this now generally interesting social subject.
CHARITY AND SHAKSPEAKB.
Shakspeabb,—now please, reader, do not skip this paragraph,
because, although you may have read enough of Shakspeabe lately, we
really have a word or two particular to say—8hakspeabe, everybody
knows, is to have a celebration on his three hundredth birthday, ana
everybody is preparing in some way or another to do something in his
memory and nonour on that day. Now the cheapest way and easiest
by which one well can show that one is not forgetful of him, is to buy
a bit of ribbon and stick it in one's buttonhole, as one did a year ago at
the marriage of our Prince. It was the right thing then to do, for of
course it showed one's loyalty, and it also in some measure was con-
ceived to show one's charity, for the ribbons, one was told, were
expressly made and sold to aid the poor weavers of Coventry, who for
some time previously had "got no work to do." The country was so
thick with white favours on the wedding day that it really almost seemed
as if it had been snowing them, and everybody trusted that the half-
starved folk of Coventry would get many a good meal out of the ribbons
they had made. Well, now, British Public, you must do the same for
Shakspeabe as you did for the Princess, of whose marriage day the
christening last week must have reminded you, and perhaps a little
stirred again your charitable blood. A ribbon has beCn designed for
Shakspeabe's Birthday, British Public, and it is to be bought any-
where, so we need name no address. This ribbon has been designed
not merely to commemorate the natal day of Shakspeabe, but also to
give work to the honest folk of Coventry, whose dinners have been
fewer and more far between of late than their stomachs may quite like.
So, British Public, go and buy this commemorative ribbon, and be
happy in the thought of doing a good deed. If the shade of Shak-
speabe could revisit this dull earth on the twenty-third of April, perhaps
of all the ways by which his memory is reverenced he might best of all
be pleased by the pleasant way in which his birthday has been used as
an occasion for promoting a little honest labour, and filling a few pockets
which have had but little in them for many a long day.
CUSTOMERS FOR STEAM-RAMS.
It is not to be endured that private ship-builders should have the
power, by an evasion of the law, to supply vessels of war to the enemies
of people with whom we are at peace, and, by so doing, involve us in
war with them. On the other hand it is intolerable that any foreign
nation should be empowered to limit the business of any British ship-
builder. Did not the Government offer to buy the steam-rams in the
Mersey, and was not that offer refused P
Because, then, why does not our dear old Pam ask the Legislature to
give Government the power of compelling the sale of any vessel of war
which it may think proper to buy at a fair valuation. A power the
same as that which is exercised by every money-grubbing railway com-
pany, at the expense of anybody, might surely be entrusted to her
Majesty's Ministers, for the pubhc good, and to the very slight disad-
vantage only of unpatriotic shipwrights. Remember, moreover, that
the British Navy would be much increased in efficiency by every
addition which it received from a private dockyard.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 7, Monday, The Committee fur defending London from rail-
way invasion has reported, and Lord Granville had the pleasure of
announcing, and Lord Punch of hearing, that seven of the schemes
have been summarily knocked on the head. There is something like
system in the arrangement of the lines whose promoters are to be allowed
to make out their case if they can. Moreover, the companies are to be
compelled to work together, so that one's journey may not be broken in
consequence of mter-railwayical malignity. Stick to this provision, our
Lords and Gentlemen, and give a traveller, whether on business or
pleasure, the means of recovering damages should he be detained five
miuutes at anv point between hew and the Isle of Dogs, or between
Streatham and Hornsey.

OUR COLOSSUS OF ROADS.
The Attorney-General stated that either Federal or Confederate
ships were entitled to capture British ships carrying contraband to the
port of the captor's enemy. But in each case the prize must be taken
to a Prize Court. Therefore, adds Mr. Punch, the Alabama is a pirate,
and Captatn Semites, when he reads this, will feel uncomfortaole in
the region circumvented by his cravat.
Mr. Disraeli requested Lord Paljierston's sentiments touching
the German burglary in Jutland. The Premier replied that the whole
invasion was an outrage and an injustice, and of course the Jutland
addition was an aggravation. But we had let the Germans understand our
opinion of their entire conduct, and it was not worth while squabbling
as to each separate step they took. This is contemptuous enough, but
the Germans are pachydermatous. Shall we put it plainer for the beer-
swillers. When you nave apprised a man that you consider him a thief
and a scoundrel, you do not watch him for a bit, and then add, "and I
also deem you a low cad."
Mr. Gladstone then explained the Government Annuities Bill. He
took two hours about it, and his speech was a treat. The object of the
Bill is to give the Working Classes a system of safe Life Assurance.
They are, to their honour, very earnest in this matter, and have about
30,000 Friendly Societies of various kinds. But these are mostly based
upon false principles, and between 8 and 0000 of them have become
bankrupt, while about 100 fail every year. The misery thus caused to
honest folks, who have been keeping up payments out of their earnings,
in the faith that they were making provision for the future, can be under-
stood. Government, in the most legitimate discharge of the duty of a
Governor, proposes to establish a State Assurance, as it established, to
i the inconceivable benefit of the people, State Savings Banks. The
nation will guarantee the payment of the policy, but as the system will
be sound, the nation will incur no risk. There is the case, and it seems
strange that there can be any objection to an act of common humanity.
The pick of the Conservatives at once signified approbation of the
scheme, but the Party emits clamours, auu in the interest of greedy
insurance offices, of inferior type, whose Touts are rampant all over the
country, and in the interest of'the keepers of public-houses where
Friendly Societies convene, there will be a demonstration, in which the
enemies of the Ministry will not be ashamed to join. Mr. Gladstone
made such a merciless exposure of the vices of the present system, and
Mr. Bovill, Conservative lawyer, told such tales of cases in which
defrauders of the poor had come under the unfavourable notice of a
sworn dozen of their countrymen, that there was an unusual sensation.
Lord Stanley applauded the Bill. You can't pull down a dirty old
house without disturbing the Vested Interests of rats, but dirty old
houses must come down for all that. Mr. Punch advises the Working
Classes of the land to address Mr. Gladstone, who is a second time
giving them an invaluable boon.
Tuesday. The Peers fired up. Lord Shaftesbury, the Premier's
near connection and bishop-maker, demanded to hear what the British
fleet was about. The Germans were waging a war which was wanton
and disgraceful beyond any recorded in history. If the Austrians sent
a fleet to t he Baltic, Lord Shaftesbury hoped that it would be met by a
British fleet, with orders to defend Denmark. So spoke the represen-
tative of the Religious World. Lord Ellenborough asked whether
Earl Russell would stand by and see an iniquitous crime perpetrated.
Lord Grey for once agreed with somebody, and that was Lord
Ellenborough, and moreover wished that Parliament could be allowed
to declare its opinions. Then a third Liberal peer, Lord Harrowby,
thought the Channel Fleet should be sent to the Baltic. Earl
Russell, thus incited, said that noble Lords could not expect him to
declare war on his own responsibility, and added that we should not go to
war for the Independence of Denmark, if that object could be
obtained without War. The fleet could easily be got to the Baltic,
and he did not think that Austrian and Prussian ships would like to
encounter those of Queen Victoria. Having relieved our minds, us
noblemen then went to dinner.
Mr. Milner Gibson stated the contents of the London Railways
Report, which was adopted, after attempts to save certain of the
schemes. Sir Joseph Paxton certainly gave some singularly strong
reasons why one of the rejected lines should have been preferred to an
accepted one. but Lord Stanley thought that the House, having
handed over the subject to the Committee, ought to accept its decisions,
or else go into every separate case. So thought the House.
Mr. Darby Griffith's mind is dreadfully harassed about telegrams
and despatches, and Mr. Layard, after a desperate effort to disinter
the honourable Member from a chaotic confusion of ideas, and being
still told that he had not explained himself, gave up the task, and the
House laughed, and cried "order" to Mr. Darby Grltfith. But we
do not see why any person should be laughed at for trying to increase
his stock of knowledge.
Mr. Disraeli. Papers?
Lord Palmerston. No more now, but more soon.
However disagreeable the word may be to the public, we are com-
pelled to write it. Education. We will be as short as possible. The
country gentlemen had been awfully well whipped, and the Opposition
benches were crowded. The aim was only to compel Mr. Lowe to give up
a portion of an Education Minute, which ordained that the Government
grant obtainable by a school on the capitation principle should be
lessened by the amount of the endowment of such school. Those who
are interested in the question know all about it, and those who are not
will be quite satisfied to know that in the presence of au overwhelming
majority, Mr. Lowe and the Government gave way.
A Committee was appointed to inquire into the working of the
Schools of Art, which are helped with public money. As Mr. Punch,
who directs the greatest School of Art in the world, is entirely supported
by public money,'and as he has no time to be bothering in a committee
room, answering idiotic questions, he begs to tender his evidence
en bloc. His School works in the best possible manner, and it will be
a wiry time for anybody who presumes to dispute that statement.
Wednesday. An Irish Policeman is as line looking and'-soldierly a fellow
as you—especially if you are a handsome Housemaid—can desire to
hand cold meat to on a summer's day. But the Irish Judges do not
think his efficiency equal to his magnificence, and SerH. Bruce wished
to appoint other constables for watching the Irish towns. There was
rather a hot debate. Sir R. Peel naturally stood up for the Peelers,
but was not so respectful in mention of the Judges as might have been
expected from his well-known reticence and good taste. He received
divers knocks for his irreverence, but the Bill was defeated.
Mr. Ewart moved the Second Reading of a Bill permitting people to
use the Metric System. It was seconded by Mr. Locke; not opposed
by Government, though Mr. Gibson declined to assist in working the

system; it was ridiculed by Mr. Henley; ably defended by Mr.
Adderley, who observed that there was no surer clap-trap in England
than to laugh at a system for being new-fangled, as every improvement in
the world was; approved by Mr. Hankey, and Mb. J. B. Smith; and
attacked by Mr. Walter, who also assailed the inoffensive Florin, as
a derice for cheating school-boys. Now, no schoolboy, with a right sense
of dignity, accepts a tip under gold, and we are quite sure that Mr.
Waxier is the fast person who would offer him an insulting guerdon.
After some more talk, the Second Reading was carried by 90 to 52.
Our dearly beloved Posterity, to you we speak, projecting our mind
into futurity. How you, with a complete and scientific metric system,
will smile at the reluctance with which we listened to the suggestion of
reform, and how yon will write of us as we write of our fathers, who
ridiculed the idea of Gas (" pay for something you can't even see? Hang
it, Sir; don't talk trash to a freeborn Englishman"); the idea of Locomo-
tives (" ride at the rate of twenty miles an hour? Confound it. Sir, are
you in or out of Bedlam P ") • the idea of Penny Postage (" send a letter
to the Highlands or the Land's End for a penny? Bless my wig, Sir, you
are a fool "J; the idea of an Electric Telegraph (" flash a message to Con-
stantinople in ten minutes, Sir! you ought to be locked up. I am sure
you are a swindler"); the idea of Punch ("publish a journal of the highest
art, the most sparkling wit, the most just criticism, and the most gene-
rous sentiments every week for three pence? Go to Bath, Sir, and get
vow head shaved"). But, dear Posterity, don't be too hard upon us.
You will be a bigot, and talk nonsense in your way, We know. Why
are you laughing at the idea of the Tunnel to America. You have got
one to France, and the Night Balloon Service to India. Don't be so
irrational, Posterity, and so unjust. We are clearing the way for you.
Thursday. We return to the reign of Qrna;!? Victoria, and do so
with the more pleasure that this day, being the anniversary of the mar-
riage of Edward, Prince ok Wales, with our beloved Alexandra of
Denmark, their first child was baptised by the names Albert, Victor,
Christian, Edward, the Qcxen holding the baby. Health and
happiness to AVCE.
The Story of the Guns came up in the'Commons, and the same day a
monster of 'Sir William Armstrong's was fired with ninety pounds of
powder against an iron plate made by Mr. Brown of Sheffield, who is
going to be the New Member for Sheffield, when it has settled whether
to drop Mr. Hadpield as he drops his haitches, or to dismiss Mr.
Tearem for not tearing anybody. Hie result was unsatisfactory to the
Gun Party. But Lord Clarence said that he thought on the whole we
were in advance of the French in the matter of guns. Then Govern-
ment "snapped " a vote of a million and a quarter, but was violently
blown up, and had to disgorge until a debate should liave taken place. On
the Mutiny Bill, there was discussion on the retention of Flogging and
Branding. A majority of 3 in a House of 87 maintained the Cat, a
majority of 30 in a House of 130 maintained the Brand. The first was
said to be necessary for "blackguards," the second to prevent Deserters
from re-enlisting. It was also urged that the French shot men, and the
Austriaus put them into a torture-room (rather a clever diabolic inven-
tion; a room all projecting angles, so that rest is impossible) for the
offences for which we flog. Mr. Punch is unconvinced.

Friday. Clanricarde intends to make a speech of inquiries about
America. Suppose he appointed a Commission consisting of himself,
to visit that region, with power to remain prosecuting his investigations,
until recalled by Mr. Punch.
Mr. S. Fitzgerald and Lord Palslerston had a dialogue about
the proposed Danish Conference, and a most lucid explanation on both
sides left the matter hi more Cimmerian obscurity than ever. Apropos
whereof, the Emperor op France has just said that this war is one of
"nationalities." This is held to mean that he sides with Germany. To
invent a new phrase for the occasion, nous verrons.
Lord Palmerston proposes to coutinue But Rowland Hill's
pension to Lady Hill, should Sir Rowland's power of taking it
terminate while Lady Hill shall be able to receive it. This is a com-
pliment, of course, but a very inadequate one, and Lous Stanley op
Alderley might have said a good deal more than he did when informing
the Lords of the resignation. Punch hears that his Stamp Committees,
suggested last week, are rapidly forming, and lie means to distinguish
those who are foremost in the work.
The week finished with a debate on the Decline of the Population of
Ireland. One great point was whether Lord Carlisle was right in
quoting Goldsmith, and dissenting from his view that a diminished
census was a thing to deplore. Sir Robert Peel made a rattling
speech, with a very free-and-easy sketch of the Fenians, whom he com-
pared to gorillas. In the interest of the latter, we protest against the
comparison.
INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE.
ever deficient in the gallantry
that naturally belongs to a true
gentleman. Punch never neglects
to make nimself agreeable to
the ladies: and he cannot do
this better than by saying a few
words on the subject of the
fashions, a topic which in femi-
nine eyes is vastly more impor-
tant than the War in Schleswig-
Holstein, or the Battles of the
Railways, or the other minor
matters which now interest man-
kind. Listen, ladies, therefore,
to the following description of a
costume which was lately dis-
played at the French Court:—
"A dress of lilac silk glace' .with
white, at the bottom of which if)
placed a wide pinked ruche in lilac
silk, whilst another smaller one in
white silk forms the middle of the
lilac one. Above this double rucbo
are placed seven flounces of rich
white blonde. These must be put on
close together, and headed by a ruche
of white tulle. The top one, however,
has a rucho of lilac and wbito pinked
silk, similar to the one at the bottom.
The pointed body is trimmed with
folds of white tulle, surrounding a
ruche of white and lilac silk."
We must just stop a bit to take breath after all these rushes, or
ruches as they are called. What they are we dare not work our brains
enough to guess. Still less are we inclined to tax our intellect by trying
to grasp a true conception of what is meant by this:—
11 Behind is a sash entirely new. This sash is composed of lilac silk, and has
three ends; the two side ones, short and ruched round with white silk, tcrminato
at the end in points; whilst the third, which is very much longer and wider than the
others, ends in two points, and is ruched all round also with white silk. From the

waist at the bock a small tail falls over the sash, similar to the jockey. This is
likewise trimmed with a white ruche."
Pray, ladies, can you tell us whether jockeys are accustomed to wear
imall tails in France, and, if not, to whose small tad is the one hero
mentioned similar? When one is told that women have taken to wear
tails, one naturally wonders what their tails are like. But leaving her
tad now, let us sec how the fair wearer of this dress adorned her
head:—
"The headdress to wear with this toilette is composed of a mixture of snowballs
and Purma violets with leaves, which latter, instead of imitating nature, are of a
violet colour, veined with silver."
Violet-hunting in the country is a pleasant sport for children, but
how many grown-up folks would gladly join in the pursuit if Nature
would but take a leaf out of the fashion-books, and permit her violets to
spring up " veined with silver!" But if this be against Nature, so too
is the mixture of violets with snowballs, and, to make the thing more
natural, we think the snowballs should be made so as to melt away
before the violets are seen. Wearing snowballs on the head might per-
haps be beneficial to persons with brain fever, but we should hardly
have imagined that people in their senses would have ever thought of
wearing them. However, of course all the absurdities invented by Dame
Fashion are not intended for the use of people who have anything like
senses to direct them in the matter of deciding how to dress.
The Successor of Csesar.
Sm George Bowyer, in a letter to the Times, correcting certain
alleged misrepresentations current respecting "The Pope and his
Visitors," says that:—
"The ceremony of kissing the foot (derived from the ceremonial of the ancient
Imporial Court) is only performed on certain occasions."
Well, to be sure! Didn't you always think that the ceremony of
kissing the Pope's foot was instituted by the Apostle, Peter?

We are not at liberty to anticipate Mr. Mapleson's advertised
production of Herr Wagner's grand Opera. All we can say at
present is, that the scene of Tannhiiitser is not laid in a tan-yard.

HOW TO USE YOUR MORLEYS.
Mr. Henry Morley, (a writer whose conscientiousness, condensed
thought, and felicity of expression need no praise from Mr. Punch)
having received from a certain organ of clique-criticism the treatment
that might have been expected, has thought it worth while to reply.
He has done so in a "comment" of serene mcrcilessness. Since
Marsyas came to naked grief for vulgar criticism, few of the Zoilus
tribe nave been more neatly divested of epidermis than has the Athenteum
critic been by Mr. Morley. One little bit of skinning we must note.
The book assailed is on English Writers, and every student of literature
should have it. Among the cackling charges of the critic is one alleging
that "the influences of the discovery of printing, of the classical re-
naissance, of the reformation are not even hinted at." Mr. Morley
quietly says,—
111 have myself always believed that Chaucer, with whom my book ends, lived
before the discovery of printing, or the Renaissance, or the Reformation."
Well, it used to be thought so, but the Athenteum has changed all
that, and will probably inform us in an early number that the Talis of
Cauntyrburye were not printed by Caxton.

POLICE NOTICE FOR CHURCH DOORS.
Unquestionably and decidedly, Mr. Punch is not goingto enter—
no, not to advance the tip of his toe—into the puddle which Theology is
stirring, to the detriment of Religion. But being a Detective, he simply
does his duty in pointing out that the Reverend Dr. Pusey, who is
taking the lead in certain movements, is a theological Ticket-of-Leave
Man, and if the Church chooses to employ him after this notice, it is
not Mr. Detective Punch's fault. The Oxford Tracts, non-natural
interpretations, Puseyism, church millinery, priestly prerogative, are
among the memorandums which are marked in the Committal book.
The Party has also lately been seen in affectionate conference with
somebody whose work is also on the Record, and who, under pretence
of going to sermons, haunts the Scotch Stores, and smuggles a Scotch
spirit into^church. The late Jowett affair at Oxford was an attempted
plant on the part of this Pusey, who wants to keep all things serene
just now, for fear of certain inquiries; but certain parties in the
provinces, who also are afraid of inquiries, were not sharp enough to
see his game, and so went blundering up and baffled him. Look out
for your Spoons—nobody else will be sold.

A-KNOCKING CP AGAINST ONE'S CRINOLINE."
SPADES AND CLUBS.
Sate us from our friends, and save us from our Friendly Societies, ought now
tojbe the cry of all th' labourers in England, excepting those, perhaps, who,
once a month or so, may want an excuse for getting drunk. Of course the
pothouse interest is dead against the scheme which Mb, Gladstone has proposed
for giving poor people the power of getting an annuity, without having to join a
pothouse club to do so. These clubs have given a knock-down blow tto many a
poor man. Under the pretence of saving, he has been tempted into spending;
and, in the thought that he is laying by a little that may help him in the hour of
sickness, he has laid out a good deal m ruining his health. Pothouse beer and pot-
house pipes will make sots of the most healthy, if too constantly indulged in; and
the man who may at first be glad of some excuse for going to a taproom, learns
speedily to 50 there without feeling the need of one.
But nothing good is ever done without a few bad words first; and nobody can
wonder that the people who profit most by the Friendly Societies should say ill
things of the scheme which now would knock them on the head. So we hear an
outcry raised, that the Government is threatening to rob us of our liberties, and
free-born Englishmen are warned to look after their rights. No doubt, were an
election to take place this next summer, such placards as(" No Tyranny!"
"No Government Protection!" would be stuck about the country; and various
dodges would be tried to make the rural mind imagine, that the Government
were trying to pocket all the poor man's money.they could lay their hands on, by
promising annuities they never meant to pay.
Labourers of England who don I live at home at ease, doubtless, are not difficult
to be tempted to a pothouse, where they find a fire to sit by and a chair to sit upon,
neither of which luxuries have they, perhaps, so good at home. The poor man ana
bis savings are easily parted when he sets foot in a pothouse, intending to invest
them for his future enjoyment. There's no time like the present, says a " friend"
at his elbow. O, be joyful, with a mug of beer! while you have the chance. And
this sentiment the landlord eloquently Dacks, offering, for "friendship's" sake, to
stand a mug himself, to drink the nealth of Mr, Hodge on his admission to
the Club. Mb, Gladstone must, of course, therefore, expect some opposition
at the first to his new scheme; but when it is known how warmly Mr. Punch
supports it, of course it will be thankfully accepted by the public, although it
won't be so acceptable to the public-house.

[March 26, 1
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 14th, Monday. Lord Granville assured the Peers, that
England was not joining any of the other Great Powers in a combina-
tion against Prance. Somebody, with a gilt for seeing further into
milestones than his neighbours, had found a hint to this effect in a
Russian despatch. Lord Granville spoke the truth, which he always
does, being a gentleman. But circumstauccs, to which Mr. Punch is
not permitted more particularly to allude, have come under his know-
ledge; and he has no Hesitation in stating, in the most positive manner,
that if certain complications of the European crisis should arise, it may
need the utmost exertions of diplomatic wisdom to prevent conse-
quences which might have a disturbing effect upon existing arrange-
ments. But this is confidential.
On the west of Africa the slave trade has diminished; on the east, it
has very much increased. John Bull, the sea-policeman, does all he
can; but his beat is very extensive, and the thieves are very numerous
and daring.
These Austrians are perfect cures, and will not take off the duty on
English-cured herrings. Perhaps certain fiery Peers would like to go
to war about that.
The War Office does everything to afford our soldiers the means of
cultivating gardens. The topic bristles with pegs for jokes, and sweet
songs on the Soldier's Garden might be written. One great soldier
was a great gardener, teste Pope :—
"And he whose lightning pierced the Iberian lines.
Now forms my quincunx and now ranks my vines."
That was Lord Peterborough, Mr. Cox, who founded St. Peters-
burg, and built the Cathedral which you may see on your way to York,
if you ever go there; and we don't know"why you shouldn't, if you
like.
Sir Charles Wood stated his intention of introducing the English
Sovereign into India. We thought that she had been lately re-intro-
duced, with some little eclat, to a very large Indian circle, by Lord
Clyde. Mr. Layard stated, that the Danes were blockading a good
many German places, one of which, called Swine-munde, seems happily
to typify the state of the German World. Mr. Lowe spoke ot the
difficulty of getting the poorer class to vaccinate, adding that they were
countenanced by persons who ought to know better. We trust that
the latter will catch the small-pox, as we have no mercy for them; and
yet they ought to be pitted.
Willingly would Mr. Punch abstain from reference to the awful
catastrophe at Sheffield. But he may do more good by stating, that
when a similar but far less terrible occurrence took place at Holmfirth
(for the second time) the nation raised £00,000 tor the survivors.
Much more will be needed now, and much more will be given. The
noble Gentlemen of Sheffield lost no time in hurrying together for the
aid of the surviving victims. Ten thousand pounds were on the table
before the second day was over. Honour to Lords Fitzwilliam and
Wharncliffe, honour to good Canon Sale, honour to John Brown
of the Armour Plates, to William Matthews, true as his own steel,
to Rodgers, the world's cutler, honour to all the good strong men who
rushed together to aid the helpless. The Prince of Wales could not
be in better company; and Mr. Punch rejoices to read the Queen's
name at the head of the list. In with your money men, women, and
children. There are hundreds of men, women, and children who want
your help; and nothing more need be said to us Islanders.
Mr. Roebuck (by the way, his aid was instantly sent, and Mr.
Hadfield, writing his message of kindness on Sunday, as was most fit,
gave a noble donation, and has forgiven us all fun) asked Sir George
Grey whether an inspector had been sent down to inquire into the
whole affair. Mr. Rawlinson, an engineer connected with the Home
Office, was to discharge this duty. Wc believe that it could not be in
better hands.
Mr. Layard had a curious explanation to make. Toucliing Kago-
sima and the Bombardment, it would now seem that we have all been
expending some slight indignation in excess. We are officially informed
that Kagosima had only 40,000 people instead of 180,000, that they all
got carefully out of the way of the shells, that nobody was hurt, that
the place has been rebuilt in an elegant manner, and that Prince
Satsuma sent fruit to our ships in return for our grape, so that our
moderation must have pleased the Japanese. The new version is a most
delightful one, and Mr. Punch is delighted, accordingly.
Wc mentioned the Government "grab" at the vote of supply. Mr.
Bright was very severe about it, and Mr. Gladstone, indignant (for,
of course, the affair was an accident) gave Mr. Bright a most tre-
mendous lecture. Then Lord Clarence Paget sent him a letter, for
which Mr. Bright ought to have called him out. We should have
had great pleasure in culling this from some contemporary:—
"Lord Clarence Paget and Mr. John Bright met this morning in Battersca
Park, the former attended by Lohd Hartingtos, the latter by an eminent Member
oftho Suciety of Friends. Arrangement being impossible, tho men were put up at |
twelve paces, and at the word both fired. Mr. Bright's ball went through an old 1
cow, who was thus happily released from mortal troubles, and Lord Clarence's
bullet fortunately took effect in the organ of an Italian, who was on his way to
early crime Tho seconds then interposed, and Mr. Bright declared that if it wen)
in accordance with his principles to forgive anybody, he would forgive Lord
Clarekce, whom ho thought the noblest fellow out, and Lord Clarence replied*
that if anything could induce him to become a Quaker, it would be the example of
his eloquent and gifted Friend, Mr. Bright. The party then went back to break-
fast'at tho Bedford Hotel. Coveut Garden, where tuey were joined by Mr. />«m-As
who lectured them on the folly of duelling, and healths were drunk until it was
time to adjourn to the House."
But, law (and Law) there was nothing like this. Mr. Bright
wrote a frank sort of apology, and offered to repeat it in the House.
Then wc had a scene. Mr. Roebuck made an opportunity of abusing
the Federals, whom he sweetly described as corrupt, base, cowardly,
and cruel. He then assailed Earl Russell with great fury; but de-
clared his confidence in Lord Paamerstox. The Premier is not the
man to accept compliments at the expense of a friend and colleague, so
he came out like Ajax in the Iliad, and threw his seven-fold shield over
the Teucer of the Foreign Office, defying the Hector to hurt him. This
was a very gentlemanly thing in Pam, and as he now sees, Mr. Punch
lias taken care that it shall not be forgotten. Well, there was more
American talk, Sir J. Fekgusson protested against Federal enlistments
in Ireland, Mr. Bright gave it to Mr. Roebuck hot and hot. and said
that the fact was that a recruit for the Federals got £100, and the only
marvel was that every Irishman, not a landowner or capitalist, did not
mn out of his " benighted and unhappy country." Lord Robert Cecil
thought the Confederates, in their adversity, much above the present
war-point of the English Government, Mr. Kinglake was terribly
scornful and sarcastic at Mr. Roebuck, and Mr. Caird—the only
speaker who was calm, and had information to give, and spoke from
personal knowledge of America—said that there was a silent revolution
beginning in the labour market, and that it would effectually settle the
laws of settlement and removal, but not in the way English employers
desired.
Simply noting that there was a preliminary Mazzini-Stansfeld
squabble to-night, when the tempest, to be described in its properplace
was indicated, and Ministers hoisted the storm-drum, Mr. Pttnek
proceeds to say that there was Committee of Supply on the Navy
Estimates, and that Mr. Lindsay, trying to reduce the vote for Dock-
'yard Workmen, obtained 29 supporters against 110 non-reductionists.
There was an extremely instructive and excessively stupid debate.
Tuesday. The Lords read the Cow Malt Bill a Second Time, and
Earl Grey remarked that those who were pressing a repeal of the
J Malt-Tax were virtually agitating for an increase of the Income-Tax.
• Well said, Lord G. But u the Tories were in to-morrow, does anybody
believe that Mr. Disraeli would sacrifice six millions? Punch is
green in perpetual youth, but virility and viridity are two things, and
the latter does not extend to his visual organs.
We never blame but with extreme pain, and we have pleasure in
stating that Mr. Ferrand has been very properly calling the attention
! of Government to the state of certain reservoirs which have not yet
burst, but which are regarded as dangerous.
| Another Crawley debate. It lasted all the evening. Will that do?
Or shall we add that General Peel and the Parliamentary soldiers
arc exceedingly indignant that civilians should presume to have opinions
on such matters.
Wednesday. We were to have been spared the theological Wednes
days, but to-day we had a debate wliich in some sort approached
theology. Mr. Dodson, of East Sussex, an Eton prizeman, who also
distinguished himself at Oxford, proposed to do away with the subscrip-
tion to the Thirty-Nine Articles, and so forth, at present required at
Oxford before a degree can be taken. The opposition was, of course,
fierce, and, equally of course, wrong ground was taken. For party
purposes, it was contended that the object of the change was the handing
! over the University to Dissenters. The truth is, and many men know
j it who will not admit it, that the object is to open the University to
I Churchmen. Education and inquiry have done tneir work, and thou-
sands of men who wish to remain members of the Church, object to
binding themselves to dogmas propounded in past centuries, and are too
conscientious to sign with reservation of right to treat the signature as
a form, and to interpret the pledge in any convenient way. Surely these
are not the men who should be kept out of the Universities. Mr.
Gladstone, whose loyalty to the Church is chivalry itself, voted for
the change, and six distinguished Conservatives did the same, while the
son of the Earl of Derby would not vote against it. Mr. Dodson
triumphed by a small majority, and the Lords will throw out the Bill;
but the tide, having once swept over the rubbish, will return and wash
it away.
Thursday. St. Patrick's Day, and the Commons were appropriately
imbued with the spirit in which that esteemed Saint used to be wor-
shipped by his fellow countrymen. But. before the fray, Lord Palmir-
ston stated that Denmark had assented to the Conference proposed by
England, and it is to be without an Armistice. We have next to hear
what France says.
"The way the row began," to quote an old song, was in this wise.

them. To-night the Chancellor vindicated himself at some length,
and Mr. Sheridan had a good innings. He showed much spirit, out
was slightly rude, saying that Mr. Gladstone ought to have taken
lessons from Elliston if he wished to play the character of a bully.
The remark might have come from the great and theatrical Sheridan,
only he would not have said so coarse a thing. Then Sir Minto Far-
quhar moved that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. Mr.
Hodgkinson opposed this, and made great fun by'quoting the miserable
doggerel puffs oy which certain Assurance Offices try to get business.
The verses are not nearly so good as those us servants read on the
tawdrv placards of the Marine Store Keepers, when we go on Saturdays
to sell the candles, dripping, keys, spoons, overcoats, and any other
trifles which we have stolen, or hidden away, during the week, to the
discontent of our masters and mistresses. But the poems of the Offices
and of the Stores are much in the same key, and in this style:—
"O where are you going, you merry throng P"
"To the 'Stunning Assurance,' so you come along."
"Buf what '111 get by my going there?"
"Why everything what is right and fair.
You '11 pay very low, and when you die
There 'Q be banknotes to wipe your widow's eye."
"Indeed! Then of delays 1 '11 have no endurance,
But haste with you, dear friends, to t he ' Stunning Assurance.'"
{The above is Copyright).
The House being thus put into temporary good humour. Mr.
Goschen, Member for the City, defended the Bill in a most elaborate
and able speech, and the debate was adjourned, for another kind of
scene was expected.
Sra Henry Josias Stracey, of Yarmouth and Boodle's, moved
"that the statement of the Procurcur-General on the trial of Greco,
implicating a Member of the House and of the Government in the plot
for the assassination of our ally, the Emperor op the French, deserves
the serious attention of the House." This was the formal opening of
the battle. The whips had been very busy, and more than 330 Members
were present. The Opposition thought it saw a good opportunity for
an " ugly rush" at the Ministry. And the rush was ugly enough, in
one sense. The object was to crush Mr. Stansfeld, and the Cabinet,
if it should stand by him. And it did stand by him. Lord Palmer-
ston's hands were up in no time. He condescend to address the
Emperor because a French lawyer had sought to please his master by
talking in the style of those French Colonels. Not old Pam, if he
knew it. Mr. Stansfeld's answer had been more than satisfactory.
"I should have felt humiliated," said the Bottlehohler, "had I had to
be a party to a communication to tell the French Government that an
English Member of Parliament, holding office in the Queen's Govern-
ment, was not connected with an infamous plot against the life of the
Empehor." Then he scoffed at the "seeming" friendship of the
Opposition for the Emperor, and reminded them that having once
given assent to a measure fyr preventing conspiracies, and having
found that by breaking their promises to support it they could oust a
Ministry, they had pocketed their indignation, and defeated the Bill.
A very dexterous smash, this, because it pleasingly brought to the
Emperor's attention the former affectionate conduct, of his new patrons.
Mr. Disraeli was very wrathful, and wondered that the Government
was afraid of any humiliation after its late exploits. He rang the
changes on poniards and assassins, and Mazzini; and his party cheered
him with more warmth than they usually show, for dislikes must be
forgotten when we can unite to damage enemies. Mr. Bright began
with some peace-making observations, but lie could not long restrain
his ardour tor battle, and dashed at the Tories with a chargc of trying
to exasperate the ill-feeling in France, and with having a hardly less
worthy object, than that of "worrying" the English Government.
Lord Robert Cecil renewed the accusation of sympathy with
assassins. Mr. Gladstone seconded Lord Palmerston, and severely
rebuked an "unmannerly" interruption. Lord Claude Hamilton
politely said that Mr. Stansfeld was either Mazzixi's accomplice or
dupe, and Mr. Cox said something which was drowned in the roar for a
division. There were 171 for Government, but 161 against it. Did
not both sides shout; one because Pam was victorious, the other
because the majority was only 10. Even the ladies behind the gallery
beat a tattoo of triumph with their fans, which was unconstitutional.
So ended the battle of Stansfeld-Mazzini.
Friday. Lord Ellenborough had intended to have a great Dano-
German night, but Lord Russell begged him to "shut up," and he
closed accordingly, like a gentleman.
More snarling over the Sheridan affair—a dull School for Scandal.
Mr. Stansfeld offered to resign, and Lord Palmerston told him
to do nothing of the kind. Touching which Mr. Osborne spoke
capitally, and called the conduct of the Opposition a painful persecution,
and then made it painful for the Opposition by dint of some damaging
ridicule.
A debate on the demolition of the fortresses of Corfu closed the First
Act of the Comedy called the Session. An interval of Easter Holidays
elapses before the next rise of the curtain. Vivat Reyina, and decidedly
no money returned.

Baby-shows there have been, we believe, in plenty, but it is quite a
noveltv to hear of a Lady-show. We wonder how the Female Artists
liked being inspected at their private view, and whether many of them
showed much colour in their cheeks at it. We presume they were
allowed to pose themselves artistically before their being viewed, and
to arrange their drapery with an eye to picturesque and personal effect.
Most ot them no doubt came in their newest bonnets, and their most
expansive Crinolines, and chose the dresses that best suited their com-
plexions for the show. We wish we had been present at the private
view, for it really must have been a very pretty sight, but as a public
character we suppose that Mr. Punch was considered inadmissible. We
trust next time that this objection will be waived, for we had always
rather see a pretty woman than her picture, and if the private view of
the Society of Lady Artists (we object to the word female," save
when applied to brutes) be what the writer in the Reader leads us to
imagine, we certainly should wish next season to attend it. Ladies
have in general remarkably short memories (except in millinery matters,
for they remember to a ribbon all t he dresses at a party held a dozen
years ago), but we trust the Lady Artists will recollect our wish, and
favour us next year with an admission card to see thein at their private
view.

TEUCEE, ASSAILED BY HECTOR, IS SHELTERED
UNDER THE SHIELD OF AJAX.
{Freely rendered into Hexameters by Mr. Punch, from Homer's Iliad,
0. yv. 266—332. After reading'the debates of Monday, March 14.)
Red-tape-strung was the bow, and pointed with gall were the arrows
Teucer bore to the field: from the quiver that rustled beside him,
Wing'd with grey-goose feathers, sharp missile on missile dispatching.
Not in the open he fought, but from under the buckler of Ajax—
Ajax Oiliades—forth-peeping, shot, frequent, his arrows:
Then, when they sped to their mark, or as they did oftener, missed it,
Teucer was nimble to run, like a child to the arms of its mother,
Back to the sheltering buckler that Ajax held, sedulous, o'er him—
Many had trusted the shield, and it ne'er failed a comrade inperil.
Say, whom first of the foe smote the arrows of far-shooting Teucer—
First, the great King of men he wounded, who rules in Lutetia,
There where he stood in his chariot, with Drouyndeluios that drove it:
Bitter the sting of the arrow that entered the joints of his harness,
Silent the King to the shaft, but not the less rankled its poison:
Then of the Teutons he struck many captains, inglorious in battle,
Bisharkos, Rechbergos, and Hallos the Hyperborean:
Then Atamus he smote; Sewardus that o'er the wide ocean
Shot with the long bow himself, as industrious an archer as Teucer:
Darbius next and Graius, and Harris, the grandson of Hermes.
But the more far-off the mark, the swifter andsharper the missile,
Certain to damage a friend, if, as often, 'twas wide of a foeman.
Him the father of mischief, in black and white that rejoices.
Seeing how swiftly and sharply he shot, drew near and applauded:
"Teucer, belov'a of my soul, Ioannulus, archer unwearied,
Still shoot on as thou shootest, if thou wouldst win honour before me;
Chiefs on both sides appalling, that never know whence nor yet whither
Fly thy terrible missiles, which strike where they least are expected.
Let but the_powers that I serve vouchsafe the upsetting of Europe,
Setting of kings by the ears, and to loggerheads Dringing the nations,
Unto thee, next to myself, I will offer a guerdon of honour,
Either an inkstand of lead, or a patent, self-acting despatch-box,
Furnished with lucifer-matches, and vitriol thy missiles for tipping."
Him thus Teucer bespake, Ioannulus, coldly, in answer;
"Why, oh monarch of mischief, thus spur on a horse that is willing?
Ne'er, while I have a hand to steady the grey goose's feather,
Ne'er will I pause from my shooting, not even though friends should
implore me;
Four great shots 1 have fired since first I was famed among archers,
And no shot of them all but sorely astonished the natives.
Many a chief I have pierced, since lately I entered the battle—
Albeit, none of them all seems any the worse for my shooting—
Still there is one dog yonder who barks, and girds at my arrows;
Hector Tearemides, big of tongue and brazen of forehead;
So he spake, and an arrow he loosed against Hector, but missed him:
Missed nim and smote at his side a Confederate chief he protected.
Him great Hector in wrath left seeking where Teucer had hit him';
Down from his high horse sprang, the horse that for kicking and biting
Hector himself had trained, impatient of bit or of bridle;
Sharp was the sound of his voice and big and bad was his language,
As at Teucer he rushed, Ioannulus, eager to crush him;
Snatching, as was his wont, the first big stone he encountered,
Reckless how heavy or sharp, so it answered his purpose of braining;
Straight at Teucer he rushed, and his big stone heavily heaving,
Smote him full on the hand, wherewith he shot off his arrows;
Numb the hand dropped at the wrist, with the grey goose feather it
guided,
Teucer sank to his knees, and his quiver-shafts rustled beneath him:
But not then did Ajax abandon his down-stricken comrade,—
Ajax Oiliades,—but o'er him extended his buckler,
Stout with its John Bull hide, that arrows and spear-shafts had blunted,]
Strong e'en unto defying the paving-stones wielded by Hector.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
Your Profound Thinker, chiefly on account of his being perpetually
lost in the profoundest thought, is the worst possible hand at opening a
conversation if suddenly addressed in the street.
Codger is one of this sort. In his own study Codger will sit in a
perfect bath of papers covered with intricate equations and logarithmical
approximations. In the matter of times and seasons I had rather have
Codger hung up in my hall than my present barometer, on which the
younger members of my family are fond of marking whatever kind of
weather best suits their fancy, thus causing me considerable inconve-
nience in the matter of great coat and umbrella. Now, although
Codger is such as I have stated him to be, yet I have known him to
become absolutely imbecile when unexpectedly hailed in a public
thoroughfare. On a pouring wet day I came upon Codger, or rather
wc came against one another at right angles.
"Hallo. Codger!" I exclaimed, and immediately added, by way of a
jest, which he from the nature of his pursuits would appreciate, " Quite
tropical weather this, eh f"
And Codger, who was totally unable to bring his tremendous powers
of mind to bear upon the manifest absurdity of my observation, gravely
replied :—
"Yes, quite."
Now I dare say that after we had parted, Codger, on his senses
returning to him, began to consider that his reply had been the best
that could have been given by him under the circumstances.
Some there are who being thoroughly taken aback by their friend's
salute, have a happy knack of making up for their want of readiness in
conversation, by pretending to make an attempt at recollecting what it
was they wanted to say to you.
A. {Stops B. in the street without any particular object in so doing).
"Ah, Bodger. I thought it was you." (After mating this sensible
remark, A. miles in a most amiable and friendly manner.)
Bodger (making an equally sensible reply). "Did you?" (They both
smile).
A. "Yes." (Smiles again, and loots at Bodger, as much as to say
that he can't keep up the conversation all by himself, and that it's his,
Bodger's, turn to speak note).
Bodger (who has not got the faintest notion of what is to come next,
adopts a cunning method for gaining time and collecting his scattered
senses). "Let me see—what was it I was going to say to you P"
(puts his head on one side, lite a raven).
A. To me f (This in a tone of surprise, but merely for the sake qf
saying something.)
A. feels that Bodger is acting a part, and Bodger is perfectly sen-
sible that his friend sees to the bottom of his shallow device.
In this little game they waste perhaps ten minutes out of the real
business of their lives. Perhaps it does them good.
A. (after Bodger has been in deep thought for a few seconds). " What
was it? can't you remember P"
Bodger (pretending to be in despair), "No," (after an interval of
thought shorter than before). "No!
A. "Well, it couldn't have been of much importance, whatever it
was." (This, incredulously).
Bodger (knowing full well that he is detected, but playing out his part
to the last). "Yes, it was though; I shall think of it presently. All
well at home?"
Of course he neither wishes nor waits for an answer to the anxious
inquiry, but straightway nods his head, smiles on his friend as if
encouraging him to keep on being "quite well at home," and with a
mutually hearty shake of the hand, they say—" Good bye."
And away go Bodger and A. in opposite directions. Does " what
he couldn't recollect but wants particularly to say to A." ever trouble
Bodger's mind again? Not a bit of it. That laughable farce is over
for these two at present.
With some folks, to be recognised from a distance in the street is
even worse than being happened upon while sharply turning a corner.
Tor instance, Dumpkins going down the street, sees Eddiwigs, at some
eighteen feet from him, coming up, on the same side; and at the very
same, moment Eddiwigs sees Dumpkins.
"Here's Dumpkins," says Eddiwigs to himself.
"Here's Eddiwigs," says Dumpkins to himself.
The next thought not expressed in words that occurs to both is, that
the meeting is very awkward, and that they wish they could get out of
each other's way. As there is no escape, without absolute rudeness,
each rather slackens than quickens his pace; Dumpkins lookingfrom
left to right as if unconscious of the approach of Eddiwigs, and Eddi-
wigs looking straight before him, but not at Dumpkins, but over his
head, at an imaginary point in the atmosphere. They have plenty of
time, each silently to himself, to arrange at least a fair opening for a
sensible and useful conversation; yet such is the fascination that the
approach of Dumpkins works upon the otherwise strong-minded Eddi-
wigs, and so powerful is the spell worked by the advancing Eddiwigs
upon the vigorous intellect of Dumpkins, that each tries to ignore the
presence of the other, and each vainly endeavours to distract his own
attention from the coming trouble.
Dumpkins must in all human probability meet Eddiwigs at last;
and so must Eddiwigs Dumpkins. I verdy believe that were there
no personal convenience consulted, they would choose rather to be
whirled up in the air, or to vanish somehow suddenly, than come across
one another at that precise moment. However, they do meet. Hands are
shaken. What is coming now? Nothing. Speechless! grinning
feebly at one another like a pair of nervous idiots. Dumpkins is the
first to rouse himself to something like a sense of the absurdity of his
position. With a violent effort he says, hesitatingly, " Well?"
This cleverly throws the onus loquendi on Eddiwigs.
But of what he says, and of what any one else says, and of what
every one under the circumstances ought to say, with the method of
saying it, I, if I may make so bold, will treat in a future paper upon
this same subject.
A DIGNIFIED CLERGYMAN.
You have heard, Sirs, no doubt, of a Reverend Gent,
Who, by name G. A. Denison, dates from East Brent,
In epistles which often appear in the Post,
And of which more epistle than gospel are most.
This Divine, you 're aware, by preferment Archdeacon,
Is a burning and shining light, flames as a beacon
On the highest High Church; and is evermore bouncing
Like a doctrinal cracker, denounced or denouncing.
He's as busy in each theological rumpus,
When the blast seems to blow from all points of the compass,
As, to word a sea-saying in periphrase blameless,
In a high gale of wind is a Personage nameless.
His last note of triumph, addressed to the Post, is
Touching Oxford's Greek Chair; G. A. Denison's boast is
The defeat of the statute proposed to endow it:
His success in restringing the income of Jowett.
What a noble revenge an opponent to wreak on
Por a dignified Clergyman, Mr. Archdeacon!
Don't you think that you rather your dignity smother
In your own pocket, striking at that of a brother?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Maiich 26, 1864.

THE PECUNIARY TEST.
Glorious majority of the Oxford Convocation; Reverend and Magnanimons
Gentlemen! Knowing that the salary of your Greek Professor ought to be ten times
as much as it is, you had the generosity and the justice to vote against the pro-
posed statute for giving him the remuneration due to his services. Your most sage
reason for doing this wise and noble act was that Ma. Jowett, within the latitude
allowed by the Established Church, holds theological opinions which differ from
your own.
You had a perfect right to vote that Mk. Jowett should not be paid more than
one-tenth of what he ought to receive for teaching the University Greek. That
is to say, you cannot be taken up and indicted for the injustice which you have done
Mr. Jowett; nor has that gentleman even an action for damages against you.
Yes, you had a right, in as far as you were able, to vote for denying Mb. Jowett
the means of subsistence. Much more has anybody, having the power, the right,
on the contrary, to give him a living.
There may be some persons, commanding ecclesiastical patronage, who would
rather, of the two, that Mk. Jowett should make a living at Oxford than hold
one in the Church'; but who, since you refuse .him_the former, will determine to
give him the latter.
The Crown would have an indisputable right to prefer' Mb. [Jowett to a
Bishopric; and would not this make very neat amends for the persecution
endured by a Regius Professor? What if the ultimate result of your attempt to
vindicate your opinions on a solemn subject by rejecting the proposal to raise a
gentleman s salary, and thus withholding from an industrious labourer the hire of
which you knew he was worthy, should be a Bishop Jowett? But that Mb.
Jowett was worthy of the hire which you piously withheld from him is perhaps more
than some of you did know. There is reason to suppose that, among the reverend
persecutors of the Oxford Professor of Greek, there are too many who at any
rate do not know the value of that language. Otherwise, for teaching it (to those
who are able to learn it) they would hardly nave limited him to £40 a-year.
H the Crown should he advised to elevate Mb. Jowett to the episcopal Bench,
suppose the conge" d'elite, the gracious permission to choose the nominee, should
be addressed to some of you. Perhaps your Dean and Chapter would refuse obedi-
ence to the Royal mandate: and, for conscience sake, submit to the penalty in
such case made and provided. Perhaps they would accept the alternative of
electing the Bishop, or taking the consequences; and elect the Bishop. Because
that is the sort of thing which your Reverences do in
retaining your preferment on condition of remaining; in law-
established fellowship with a man whom you denounce and
punish as a heretic, but who, if you were to call him one,
might prosecute you for libel. Declining to suffer for con-
science' sake yourselves, perhaps your Reverences would
be content to assert your orthodoxy by giving a Bishop,
whom you feared to reject, as much annoyance as you might
be able to cause him by any proceeding which would sub-
ject him to a privation of income.
The patience which enables you to put up with a judg-
ment that forces you to endure the communion of those
whom you anathematise, is a patience which transcends
resignation. So you continue in association with those
whom you deem misbelievers, and reconcile your position
with your consciences by the consideration that it enables
you to persecute them.
A PAIR OF POETS.
There is a Bard, the heir of fame,
His countrymen's delight,
He has a universal name—
^Mind you pronounce it right.
It'seeras to rhyme, not, as in gross
Mistake we did suppose,
As o docs in cathedral close;
So call him Poet Close.
The sons of song in couples run;
'Tis wondrous how they do.
For instance, there is Homer, one,
And there is Virgil, two.
Shaksfeare with Milton we combine;
Beaumont with Fletcher goes;
Dryden with Pope; whose mighty line
With that of Poet Close P
Just as we Scott with Byron pair,
And Wordsworth makes us think
Of Southey, even so we dare
Two living Bards to link.
In either's verse, with kindred light,
The fire of Genius glows;
And Poet Tupper we may cite
Along with Poet Close.
The Poet Tupper has a hold
On playful minds and mild,
And therefore have his poems sold
Like fire of species wild.
The other Poet, doubtless, would
As fast of his dispose,
Were but the sportive, green, and good,
Aware of Poet Close.
Oft Tupper, with unconscious touch,
Will make your sides ache sore;
You '11 laugh at Poet Close as much,
But he intends no more.
Nor is his pen to verse confined;
He likewise deals in prose.
Lo both, with graphic art combined—]
A book by Poet Close ! *
Poor Close's pension was revoked,
O revocation hard!
Fun because envious, critics poked
At Kirkby-Stephen's Bara.
What matter, if tne Public pays
The Minstrel what it owes,
And gilds, like Poet Tupper's bays,
The wreath of Poet Close P

THE TATTOO AND THE TRUMPET.
The New Zealanders have
saved the Yeomanry Ca-
valry. Ha! ha! A martial
array of heroes from the
Counties marched upon
Cambridge House a few
days ago, massacred the
porter at the lodge (who
is as well as can be ex-
pected), cut down the hall
porter (who is still better),
forced its way into the
Premier's room, and de-
clared that it would be
called out for graining as
usual. Pam had made up
his mind to give way, but
did not know what sort of
a reason to assign for
having let the Government
be all but beaten on the
question, and then for
having changed his mind.
So he was awfully affable,
showed "characteristic
affability and courtesy,"
says the report, and then?
a flash of inspiration coming to his aid, he declared that he had received such good
news from New Zealand that he could afford to spend part of the New Zealand
vote on the bumpkin chivalry. The heroes were ecstatic, and Pam will very, likely
gain some stray votes. We wouldn't disturb anybod v"s happiness, but would in the
most abject humility ask how, if a fortnight ago the Government was convinced

that the calling out these rustic cavaliers would be an un-
justifiable extravagance, it has suddenly become a proper
expenditure, because the Government lias in hand some
money given for quite another purpose. Setting this trifling
and perhaps irreverent query aside, Mr. Punch joins lustily
in the song popularly set to the Yeomanry trumpets:—
•* All you that are able,
Come down to the atablo,
And water your horses, and give them some corn,
And you who 're unable
To come to the stable,
May lie in tho blankets and keep yourselves i

stantaneous for heating a house as to contradict your wife.

mend him to try the experiment, and if he doesn't feel con-
siderably warmer after the process, we will consent to lose
our reputation of being a good prophet (to everybody that
we have commercial dealings with). However, we would
advise the bold man not to try the experiment a second
time, or else the house may become a great deal too hot to
hold him, and he will certainly have to seek refuge in his
Club, before he can get cool again.

BEFORE THE RACE.
Come, list to me, who wish to hear the glories of our crew,
I'll tell you all the names of those who wear the Cambridge Blue
First Hawkshaw comes, a stalwart bow, as tough as oak, nay toughe:
Look at him ye who wish to see the Antipodes to " duffer."
Swift as the Hawk in airy flight, strong as the guardsman Shaw,
We men of mortal muscles must contemplate him with awe.
Though I dwell by Cam's slow river, and I hope am not a bigot,
I think that Isis cannot boast a better man than Pigott:
Active, aud strong, and steady, and never known to shirk,
Of Corpus the quintessence, he is always fit for work.
The men of Thames will be amazed when they see our "Three" so strong,
And doubt if such a mighty form to mortal mould belong.
"What son is this?" they, one and all, will ask in awe and wonder;
The men of Cam will answer make, "A mighty son of thunder."
Next Hawkins comes at "number 4," the sole surviving pet
Of the patroness of rowing, the Lady Margaret;
When they think of his broad shoulders, and strong and sinewy arms,
Nor parents dear, nor brothers stern, need foster fond alarms.
Oh! a tear of love maternal in Etona's eye will quiver,
When she sees her favourite Kinglake also monarch of the river.
Oh! that I could honour fitly in this unassuming song
That wondrous combination of steady, long, and strong.
Then comes a true-blue mariner from the ever-glorious "First,"
In the golden arms of Glory and the lap of Vict'ry nurst;
Though blue may be his colours, there are better oarsmen few,
And Oxford when it sees him will perhaps look still more blue.
Then comes the son of Stephbn, as solid as a wall;
We need not add, who know his name, that he hails from Trinity Hall.
Oh! in the race, when comes at last the struggle close and dire.
May he have the wind and courage of his tutor and his sire;
May he think of all the glories of the ribbon black and white,
Ana add another jewel to the diadem so bright!
Then comes a name which Camas and Etona know full well,
A name that's always sure to win, and never will prove a sell.
0 what joy will fill a Bishop's heart on a far far distant shore,
When he sees our Stroke reviving the memories of yore!
Then old Cam will he revisit in fancy's fairy dream,
And rouse once more with sounding oar the slow and sluggish stream:
But who is this with voice so shrill, so resolute and ready P
Who cries so oft "too late!" "too soon!" "quicker forward!"
"Steady, steady!"
Why 'tis our young toxophilite, our Archbr bold and true,
The lightest and the tightest who has ever steered light-blue.
0 when he pulls the yielding string may he shoot both strong and
straight,
And may the flight be swift and sure of his mighty arrows eight!
May he add another victory to increase our Cambridge score;
May Father Thames again Dehold the light blue to the fore!
But ah! the name of Victory falls feebly on my ear—
Forgive me! 'tis not cowardice that bias me sued this tear,
1 weep to think that three long years have looked on our defeat;
For three long years we ne'er have known the taste of triumph sweet;
O Father Cam! 0 Father Thames! O ye nymphs of Chiswick eyot!
0 Triton! O Poseidon! Take some pity on our fate!
What's the use of resolution or of training or of science,
If anxious friends and relatives to our efforts bid defiance?
If they take our strongest heroes from the middle of the boat,
Lest exposure to the weather should give them a sore throat.
We've rowed our boat when wave ou wave o'er ship and crew was
plashing,
And little were we troubled by the steamers and the splashing.
0 little do the light-blues care when tempests round them gather,
We '11 meet the raging of the skies, but not an angry Father!
For though our vessel sank/our hearts were buoyant as a feather,
Since we knew that we had done our best in spite of wind and weather.
Then all ye Gods and Goddesses who rule o'er lake and river,
0 wipe away the trembling tear which in mine eye doth quiver!
O wipe away the dire defeats that now we often suffer,
Let not the name of Cambridge blue be breathed with that of " duffer!"
O melt the hearts of governors! For who can hope to thrive,
If, when we 're just together," they deprive us of our " Five?"
And lastly, when 'mid shouts and cheers and screams and deafening dins,
The two boats start upon their course
AFTER THE RACE.
$cu mihi, ©xforo toins!
"Eh? Mother."
Is not our dear old friend. Mother Church, a little inconsistent?
Of course she is, and a female who is not sometimes inconsistent is not
loveable. But it it odd that she should, in the Tests debate for instance,
declare that Subscriptions are her great support, and yet that she should
expect so little from her friends' Subscriptions that she clings to Church -
rates. Bless her old soul, nevertheless; in fact rather the more.

THE WAY THE CAT JUMPS.
Me. Punch,
Which way the Cat jumps in the House of Commons, you
can judge from the majority of 45 to 42 against the amendment on the
Mutiny Bill, moved by Mb. Cox, for the abolition of Flogging in the
Army.
Should the Cat-o'-Nine-Tails be eliminated from the Land and Sea
Forces, will the British Army and Navy, as captains and higher officers
in either service predict, become ungovernable? That tney will, we
cannot be quite sure, because they are not in a state of anarchy now as
gallant gentlemen predicted they would be in consequence of the reduc-
tion of the statutable number of lashes from infinity to fifty.
To be sure it is true that fifty ilashes and fifty lashes may be very
different things; and that five hundred or any number of lashes may be
preferable to fifty. The Act of Parliament which limited Courts Martial
and Colonels to fifty lashes, omitted to provide [that they should be
administered by a flogging machine, graduated to act with a certain
power, or that the force of the drummer's arm should be limited to a
stated sum by a dynamometer.
In thi3 matter of flogging, whatever may be the merits of the question
for or [against it, the glorious inconsistency which characterises our
constitutional legislation in general is particularly manifest.
We flog bad soldiers and sailors, and we flog no other bad men but
garotters and unruly convicts. Besides, we only flog bad boys. The
theory of flogging supposes fear of bodily pain. Almost the only men
we flog are men who for the consideration of their victuals, their lodg-
ing, and about three-half-pence a day to spend out of their wages, have
of their own accord put themselves m the way of being obliged to expose
themselves to the imminent risk of shattered limbs, lacerated bodies,
mutilated persons, death in the extremest of torments, or a life of misery
to which such a death is preferable. What is the Cat-'o-Nine-Tails to a
man who jests at rifle bullets, rockets, live shells, tand cold steel, or it
may be red-hot iron in the inside of him P If a man has no fear of
wounds to which the scratches of the Cat are flea-bites, will he fear the
CatP _ If he fears the Cat, has he one grain of the courage that is
requisite for a soldier? Would not the best thing the Army or Navy
could do with him be to get rid of him as soon as possible? He that is
afraid of a skin-deep laceration of the back can have " no stomach for
the fight," in which that organ is liable to more formidable injury.
If British soldiers and sailors were conscripts, many of them obligeJ
to risk their brains and bones, and viscera against their will there
might, one would think, certainly be considerable necessity for trie Cat,
or some equivalent, to keep a large number of involuntary warriors in
order. But they are all volunteers: and the French, pressed men, arc
kept in pretty good discipline by other means than stripes. Are those
means, as our gallant legislators tell us, bullets P Is it the fact that a
French soldier or sailor is shot where an Englishman is flogged?
I do not pretend to say, Mr. Punch, because I do not know, that
flogging in the Army and Navy could be safely abolished. But this I
say, that if it cannot, it had better be re-introduced, and that largely,
into the Roguery and Felonry. I don't know what there is in the voca-
tion of defending a land of freedom which should render a man peculiarly
liable to the punishment which is regarded as suitable only to a slave,
and, if suitable to any slave at all, is suitable to one who has incurred
servitude by his crimes. With kind regard to Colonels North and,
Knox, believe me, yours truly, jj, Terrorm.
P.S. Could there not be a trial of the 'suspended animation, so U>
speak, of the Cat for a year during peace, with a proviso for its revival
in the event of war P No, I suppose the Captains and Colonels will
say. Their honours and worships always say no to any proposal for
trying the temporary discontinuance of hanging or any other corporal
punishment. Are they afraid the experiment would succeed?
A SOCIAL POLICE CASE.
Mr. Putich, premising that his remarks recently made under the
above heading did not refer to a publication (a respectable and useful
one) called the Autograph Souvenir, has to say that he has received two
communications from the Editor of the publication to which those
remarks did refer. Mr. Punch never makes a grave statement in the
absence of evidence absolutely confirming it. Having made no
departure from that rule in the case in question, he has no intention of
either retracting a word of his previous allegations (evidently read by
the remonstrant in a state of mind which prevents a charge and its
terms from being duly comprehended) or of permitting them to be
contradicted, under the circumstances within his knowledge. But he
is glad to inter that no second avertusemtnt will be needed.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE
CIRCULAR
BORE.

{To (he Editor of "Punch.")
Slr,—Much as we are in-
debted to your friend Sir
Rowland Hill, cheap post-
age has occasioned one very
great bore. I mean the Cir-
cular Bore. Some impertinent
jackanapes will suggest that
a Rifle bore, for instance, is a
circular bore. I am not com-
plaining of that aperture or
any other. The Circular Bore
that annoys me is the Adver-
tising Circular Bore, Sir.
I hate a double rap, as such.
It may be the tax-collector's
instead of the postman's. No
news is good news; and a
letter is more likely to con-
tain unpleasant than agreeable
tidings. The best that I can
expect would arrive is a note
asking me to dine; and that
will most probably come from
somebody who doesn't keep
a better table than my own;
and then it will give me the
trouble of writing back to
say "No, I won t," in gra-
cious words.
The postman's knock, Sir,
therefore, knocks me over.
It throws me into a state of
apprehension which lasts
until I have got and torn
open the letter which it has
announced. And that, after
all, I find to contain a con-
founded linen-draper's puff.
The fool who sent it! As if,
in case I had a wife and
daughters, I should not
throw it behind the fire as
quickly again as I do. Some-
times it is addressed to a
hypothetical Mrs. S., and if there were
one, it would impose upon me through
her foolish passion for finery. I congratu-
late myself that I am not to be imposed
upon, Sir, But I have been disquieted,
Sir, and subjected to considerable uneasi-
ness, and I hate it.
There is another Circular Bore that
is even more aggravating than puff-
ing handbills. That is the Prospectus
Bore.
The Prospectus Bore I not only resent
as an attempt to take me in, Sir, but also
as a mockery of my limited circumstances,
Sir. It is the Circular of some new
Joint-Stock Bank, Assurance, Mining,
or other Bubble Company, a speculation
in which it invites me to invest money.
Now I have no money to invest, and if
I had any I should invest it either in
Government securities or freehold pro-
perty with a guaranteed title. But it
exasperates me, Sir, to be reminded that
I have no money to invest whilst so many
fools have plenty, and are cosened out of
it by a swindling circular like that before
me; a position. Sir, which it does not
long retain. In the meanwhile, Sir, I
console myself by exulting in the know-
ledge that I coula not be the dupe of any
such humbug, and I gloat, with pleasur-
able derision, over the considerately
supplied form of applications for shares, with its lines all so handily
ruled, and spaces nicely left for me to fill up, and the place where I am
to sign my name, as though it were a matter of course that I should.
I am not of a demonstrative nature, Sir, but, as 1 look at the trap
THE LATEST FKOM ALDERSHOT.
Mr. Snip's Foreman (with great anxiety). " Is Mn. St. Longwind at Home?"
Faithful B&tman (who smells a Dun)." Master's gone to a Court-mabtial.

thus set for me. I cannot help
grinning, ana whispering,
Walker!" through my
clenched teeth, whilst I press
the end of my nose flat with
my thumb, and vibrate my ex-
tended fingers with a will.
The Circular Bore, Sir, is
inflicted through the Post,
principally and especially on
men whose names, like mine,
are to be got at in a pro-
fessional catalogue. Por
being thus pestered, my chief
consolation, which I would
suggest to others, is, that
the gentry who have taken
the trouble to hunt up my
name for the purpose of
getting money out of me by a
humbugging circular, have
at least thrown away a
penny stamp on their specu-
lation upon the good-nature
or gullibility of, Sir, your
humble servant.
Smelfungus.
P.S. It would serve the
humbugs right to return their
Schedule filled up and signed
with the name and address
of an imaginary Smith or
Jones, Sir.
OUR OWN JO MILLER.
Who has not heard of Jo
Miller? But who has seen
the original Publication? We
have found this curiosity, and
now, in order to promote
witty conversation and genial
hilarity among those brilliant
diners-out whose powers are
on the wane, and among the
rising generation of wags, who
are still at their freshest, we
propose from time to time
giving a few specimens of
those exquisitely facetious stories, which
long ago set the tables of our great-
great-great-great-grandfathers in a roar,
but which have nowadays fallen into most
unmerited oblivion. The rare wit and
humour of the following anecdotes, be it
remarked, docs not lie upon the surface,
nor can the reader expect at once to
plumb the subtle depths, or reach the fine
points of Honest Joseph's funny stories.
Patience will overcome all the difficulties
of the pleasurable task. We will com-
mence with the following gems:—
A DOCTOR'S FEE.
A Certain Quack, calling one day on
an invalid, asked him, "how he did?"
"1 didn't," was the sufferer's reply.
"Then," cried the undaunted disciple
of Galen, "It must have been your
brother." With this he pocketed his fee,
but never returned to the House.
THE CLOWN AND THE TOFLAR.
A Wag, happening one day to be walk-
ing through St. James's Park, was ac-
costed in a somewhat rude style by an
elderly countryman who was staring up
at a stick that was suspended on a branch
of one of the trees. "Prithee, Sir,"
quoth Hodge, "is not this an injustice;
for I see a piece of wood that never did aught of harm to a soul hanging,
while there is a knave below that goes free." "Nay, friend," returned
the other, "but I see one that isn't." And so saying he turned on
his heel and departed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
ear Punch, — A
friend of mine, an Oxfor*
"man" he calls himself (for
as babies are lxtm nowadays
some five or six years old,
a boy of course becomes a
man before be is twenty),
lias recently been staying a
few days with me in town,
on the plea that his presence
was reauked at the boat-
race. To carry out this
notion, every day for up-
wards of a week before the
match, he used to stalk
into my study directly after
breakfast, and say, Well,
old boy, excuse rue, please,
I must be off to Putney.
You see, our men are going
to practise a new spurt,"
this with « knowing glance
at me as though to hint they
could not possibly get
through their work without
him. "Wedine at six, mind,
sharp." I used to bellow
after him as he banged the
door, and then tic dis
appeared behind a big cigar,
and I saw nothing more of
him until half-past seven.
Of course I knew my
stomach better than to wait for him, but I think be must have
bribed the cook to keep him in her mind, for she always seemed
to me to reserve the nicest dishes for him. A pipe of cavendish
was lit directly after the last mouthful, and then he used .to entertain
me with tales aoout "our men," and how splendidly they kept their
stroke, and what fine form they rowed in. After an hour or so of
boating slang, which I understand as much as I do Gaelic or Fceiee, he
then, just about my bed-time, used to vote that we should go and have
a game of pool, and a pipe at Paddy Greek's, where we should be
pretty safe to drop upon some fellows. Now, when I play billiards I
invariably lose, and, as the game thus grows monotonous, I proposed
to him one night, just by way of novelty, to look into some theatre.
To my astonishment, however, there seemed nothing on the stage that
he had not been to see, although he vowed to me he had not been in
Town since Christmas. I recommended, first, Miss Batekan.* " Queen
Leah? 0 yes, she's capital. I saw her in October, and didn't she
make me cry, just!" Then there's the Ticket-of-Leave Man: you like
a thrilling drama. "Thank you, my dear fellow, but I saw that twice
last summer." Well, then, there's the Haymarket. "What! and see
old Lord Dundreary, who's been playing for a century ?—puff—why,
my dear fellow, I saw him—puff—a dozen times at least a couple of
years ago—puffpuff—before even I left schoo—puffpuff— hern—puff-
before even I knew you—puffpuffpuffpuffpuff."
"Well, it really is a nuisance," said I, after a short pause, in which my
young friend nearly choked me by the quickness of his smoking; "but
if authors will write pieces so abominably attractive that they somehow
draw good houses for a couple of hundred nights, of course men like
you and me, who are getting rather biases, and don't much care to see
plays twice, really can't go to a theatre above once in a twelvemonth,
ana the managers can hardly wonder at our absence. But, come now,"
added I, just glancing at the Times," swells like you and me don't often
cross the Thames in our dramatic expeditions, so what d' ye say to
spending half-an-hour with Messieubs Shepherd and Anderson over
at the Surrey,? I hear that there's an out-and-out good blood-and-
thunder nautical sensation drama playing there, with a nice cold-blooded
murder and the storming of Algiers in it, and a cataract of Ileal Water
—from some Real Water Works!"
So in desperation and a hansom off we went," and found an audience
composed of some three thousand people, packed well nigh as tightly
as Sardines in a box, but all sitting in most evident enjoyment of the
plav, for which I learned that they had paid their sixpence to the
gallery and their shilling to the pit. (N.B. No half-price, except to
Croesuses of wealth enough to pay two shillings to the boxes, no daring
innovator having yet been bold enough to tempt a bloated aristocracy
to patronise the theatre, by stealing from the pittites a row or two of
stalls.)
Without quite echoing the playbill, that Ashore and Afloat "eclipses
Black-Eyed Susan," and presents "One Blaze of Triumph" from the
first to the last scene, I must admit that, when I saw it, the drama was
received with "tumultuous applause;" and there were starings, shout-
ings, stampings, and hand-clappings enough to be'described as "acclam-
ations of wonder and delight." The plot was more intelligible than I
quite expected; and all throughout the piece the author clearly did his
best to prevent a British audience from m»Ving a mistake between
villainy and virtue, and so took care that the murder which was done
in the first act should be committed coram populo, and not behind the
scenes. The humour was peculiar,' as in these over-water dramas it
usually is; but in neither word nor gesture was aught to be detected
at all savouring of coarseness; and this is more than may be said at
some genteeler theatres which I forbear to name. To tell your friend
in confidence, "Well, if 'tis so, it 'tis, and it can't be no 'tfu-er," may
not appear, perhaps, a very brilliant epigram, but the audience seemed
perfectly delighted with its pungency and [point; and when Hal Oai-
ford, being tempted to turn traitor at Algiers, turns his quid instead,
and, hitching up his trousers, says, "What! sail under false colours?
damme, no! sheer off, you monkey-eating swab! 1 mean to die True
Blue, and not Turkey Rhubarb," there is a roar of approbation at the
gallant fellow's courage, and the house is quite enraptured at the
sparkle of his wit.
Perhaps it is because he has the real cataract in his eye, that the
author seems throughout the play to strive after reality, and to make
his characters,do just what they naturally would do in real life. Thus,
in the murder scene, a person who, according to the playbill, is a
"wealthy but miserly landlord," while out walking with a friend, on a
sudden recollects he has £21100 about him, and so hands him this small
trifle to keep for a few days, which is precisely what a miser would
most naturally do. Meek villain, miser's bailiff, stabs friend with his
pocket-knife (which bears, of course, his name on it, and which he
takes good care to drop); and. as the notes for the £0080 are en a
bank which breaks unluckily before he gets them cashed, he walks
about for four yean with tliem in his pocket, that at the right motueu
they may prove liis guilt. Then, when Algiers is bombarded, on comes
Mr. Shepherd as a Wlant British sailor, with a broadsword in one
hand and a big Union Jack (a famous thing to fight with) in the other,
and a terrific one, two, over, one, two, under" fight ensues between
him and the bey, who also wears a broadsword, as Turks usually do.
All this, you see, is strictly true to nature and reality; and people who
read history, and are induced thereby to fancy that Algiers was taken
by Lord Exmouth, may discover at the Surrey that history is quite
wrong, and that the capture in reality was made by one Hal Oakford,
who, with his soft and cheery voice and light and springy bearing,
reminded me a little of dear old T. P. Cooke.
As to the sensation scene, which takes place in a eoal-mine, its chief
novelty consists in the fact that all the characters are left hanging in
mid-air at the falling of the curtain, and when the curtain again rises at
the bidding of the audience, the rescued heroine and her friends are still
in bodily suspense. Perhaps the next sensation climax will take place
in a balloon, and a terrific broadsword combat will come off in the car
between the hero and the villain, when the villain, being worsted, will
proceed to draw a blunderbuss out of his left boot, and, firing bang
at the balloon, will laugh ha! ha! as it collapses, and the act-drop
will descend while they both vanish down a trap. Of course, in the
next scene the audience will learn that the villain has been smashed:
and the hero will be seen with one arm in a sling and the other round
the heroine, who, being startled at her needle by the banging of the
blunderbuss, looked out and caught a glimpse of the iballoon as it col-
lapsed, and so, with woman's wit and quickness, scampered from her
cottage, carrying a feather-bed, which she laid upon the grass-plat just
in time to break her long-loved Harry's fall.
Trusting that Hal Oakford and the girl he nightly rescues will neither
of them break their legs, or even sprain their ancles, before their run is
over, I beg leave to subscribe myself as usual,
One who Pats.
SHAKSPEARIAN SCULPTURE.
An Advertisement of the Shakspeare Monument informs the Public
that:—
"It is proposed to commemorate the 300th birthday of Shakspeare by erecting
in Loudon a monument embracing a bronzo statue placed under a decorative oanony
in tho stylo of the Poet's period."
It is difficult to conceive a monument embracing a statue, if the monu-
ment is not a statue itself, or does not resemble either some animal, as
a monkey or a bear, capable of clasping or hugging, or some plant, like
a vine or a honeysuckle, accustomed to cling to and twine round objects.
Otherwise, a monument could hardly embrace a statue; if one is to
embrace the other, the statue should embrace the monument. If the
monument embracing the bronze statue to be erected in commemoration
of Shakspeare's birthday is to be itself a statue, well and good. The
bronze statue might be that of Juliet, and the other Romeo's, and Romeo
might be thus represented embracing Juliet. Or the two statues might
be a statue of Tiiania embracing a statue of Bottom.

SHIPLEY SWINE'S FEAST.
Speaking"of a particularly obstinate fool,|DR. JohnsoU said, "Sir
he would lie and tumble in a hogstye as long as you stood and called
him to come out." There are some men whose dispositions are won-
drously modified by those of the animals with which they are peculiarly
conversant; and the agricultural mind, dealing much with pigs, not
uncommonly induces tie bumpkin wnom it actuates to persist in
wallowing morally in the mire of prejudice and stupidity. The sub-
joined extract from a rural contemporary will illustrate tW preceding
observations:—
"SHIPLEY.
"In* Sparrow Club.—The annual mooting of tho Shipley Sparrow Club was
held at the Selsey Arms Inn, on the 2nd inst., when upwards of twenty member*
eat down to an excellent dinner, provided by Mr. and Mas. Slater in their usual
style. After the cloth was removed, the Chairman proceeded to look over the
accounts and award the prises; and announced that 9,910 bird's heads of various
kinds had been sent in during the year, being upwards of 2,000 more than hod been
Bent in any previous year. It was unanimously agreed to carry on the olub as
before, notwithstanding all that Punch and other unti-birdkillers have said about it."
The clowns who constitute the mischievous association calling itself
the Shipley Sparrow Club take an evident pride in their determination
to persist in their brutal endeavour to exterminate small birds, out of
sheer hoggish contradiction to what " Punch and the other anti-bird-
killers have said about it." The excellent dinner provided by Mb. and
Mss. Slateb in their usual style for these boors was probably not the
sort of meal that they are best able to appreciate, which is manifestly
barley-meal. But for their peculiar affinity to swine, the bumpkins who
have taken the name of the Sparrow Club would have most justlv
described themselves by that of the Goose Club; only they would
then have been liable to be confounded with more rational societies.
The Caterpillar Club would also be a suitable title for a set of farmers
who are such blockheads as to conspire for the destruction of sparrows.
Their attempt to destroy the destroyers of the vermin that ravage their
crops is suicidal; and the injury which they inflict on themselves, in
swimming against the stream of enlightened opinion, completes their
resemblance to the grunting quadruped which is regarded as the emblem
of obstinacy.
Notes and Queries.
The Pillory was not, in the first instance, a place where an offender
was obliged to take medicine, though whoever was placed therein,
undoubtedly had a dose of it.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
The last picture, uniting two subjects, to which I begged to call your
attention, was that of Dumpkins surprised in the street by Bodgek, and
its converse, of Bodger in the street surprised by Dumpkins. These
together would form an' admirable cartoon, and Mr. E. M. Ward is
welcome to the idea; whereupon I drink a water-glass to his health (to
his by the way distinctly not to mine, not being an bydropathist) and
return to our theme. Two persons unexpectedly and suddenly meet
one another in the street, and straightway each is more abashed by the
presence of the other, than would be any pickpocket caught redhandker-
chiefed in the fact. As it is my intention presently to show what ought
to be said, and what ought to be left unsaid, I must, in order to repre-
sent what actually is said on such occasions as the above mentioned,
very briefly recapitulate a portion of a former< paper.
Stand up, don't breathe upon the glasses, keep both eyes open and
observe,
Scene—A Street in London. Time— Mid-afternoon.
Out Dramatis Persona consist of Two Friends, whom tee will call 1st and
2nd Citizen. This may be termed Method No. 1.
1st Citizen {meeting 2nd Citizen, and feeling compelled to stop him as \f
he had got something of the utmost importance to communicate). Ah!
This in a tone of surprise, accompanied by.hand-shaking.
2nd Cit. (in same tone). Ah!
Now these exclamations ought to be written after the fashion of the
libretto of a duet.
1st Cit. I Ah,
2ndCit.\ An!
1st Cit. How are you?
2nd Cit. (with remarkable originality). How are you? (Then with
some slight originality). Eh?
We have previously noticed that no answer is expected by or from
either partVi
1st Of. Well! (Smiles at the top button of 2nd Cit.'s coat.) Well!
(Suddenly.) What are you doing with yourself, now, eh P
This is given as if expecting to hear that his friend is the same good-
for-nothing; worthless fellow that be always was, only worse. Now on
hearing this question, 2nd Citizen somehow or another does not feel
altogether comfortable, and entertains some hazy idea in his mind that,
under no circumstances, is an Englishman bound to criminate himself.
Consequently, as if he had some deep designs to conceal, he replies, in
a careless and indifferent manner evidently assumed, "Oh! urn—much-
as-usual-you-know" (all one word) "much as usual."
Now this style of answer takes it for granted that his friend has been,
for some time previous, deeply interested in his movements; his friend
it need hardly be said, has never thought or cared a rap about him. By
the way, this phrase to care a rap" is expressive, and was even more
significant when knockers were the sole means of making oneself heard
at the street-door. One who "does not care a rap for you" evidently
means a man who never thinks of calling at your house. But to.hie back.
"Now," thinks 1st atizen to himself, "I '11 show him that' he isn't
everybody, and that / haven't even heard of him for an age." This is,
as it were, an aside for—
1st Gi. (aloud and in an offhand manner). Still living at Camberwell?
2nd at. (roused to a sense of snobbish indignation by the thought that
there should exist a creature who remembered when he lined at Camberwell;
says, as if trying to recollect the time of such residence). Camberwell?
Camberwell? (Repeats it like a sleepy 'bus-conductor.) Let me see—
(Suddenly.) Oh— ah—yesyesyesyes (all one word, a string of affirmatives)
—Oil! we've left there a very long time.
1st Cit. (utterly uninterested). Oh! then you're—(cleverly)—then
you 're somewhere else now, eh P
This is not a bad hit as far as a mere guess goes.
2nd at. Yes. Oh yes, we've moved. (Debates within himself whether
he shall communicate the causes that urged him to his migration; decides
that he will do so). Yes, we've moved; for the fact is that (alters his
mind) Camberwell was all very well, (contradicts himself) but it was
rather a nuisance, and soKftnds that he's gelling into difficulties), and so
we moved.
2nd Cit. (who thought that his friend would never come to the end of tlie
story, says with an atr of relief). Ah!
PauseT During which they eye one another, then clear their throats
several times, as if they'd each swallowed a.chicken bone.
1*/ Cit. Wei£-er—
2nd at. Well—er—
1st Cit. (not wishing to be abrupt). Good bye. I'm very glad we met.
2nd Cit. So am I. (And evinces his delight by at once saying). Good
bye.
1st at.'(as he moves off calls). Look in and see us one of these days,
do. (Pushes off before his friend has time to ask for his address.)
2nd Cit. (speaking really to nobody), With pleasure.
Of course 1st Citizen does not want to see 2nd Citizen again, and 2nd
atizen never intends to call, and so ends the First Method.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THAME COUNTY-COURT LAW.
To J. 3. Pabey, Esq* Q.C.
My Deae Sib,
Did you ever, in the country, happen to see a stable-boy, or
the gardener, or a footman in livery, on one of his master's best horses,
galloping, full speed, the shortest way to the nearest market-town?
Or did you ever notice Mb. Younghusband running as fast as he
could go in the same direction? Of course; and I presume that you
understood the meaning of the phenomenon to;be the peculiar one
which is expressed in the cry of "Tlun for the Doctor!"
Now, then, how could you have come to the decision which you are
reported by my contemporary the Bicester Herald to have pronounced
a week or two ago in the Thame County Court in the case of " W. G.
Walker, p. the Guardians of the Thame Union." No wonder that
the reporter thereof has given Mr. Walker's initials. He doubtless
thought that plain Walker would be taken to indicate a hoax. And,
1 must say that the judgment, ox misjudgmcnt attributed to you in this
matter, is almost incredible.
No doubt you remember the suit to which I refer; but my other
readers must know that:—
"This wag a claim of £3 10s. for modical atl
elns
1 cases of childbirth'
Mb. Sawyer, barrister, instructed by Mil Parker, appeared for the defendants.
The plantiff represented bis own case, and in opening it said—My case is very
simple, as far as I understand. I reside at Brill, and am a medical district officer in
tho Thame Union."
Brill is, by some epicures, otherwise called workhouse turbot; but
I am afraid that it is no part of the dietary allowed in the Thame Union.
Pardon the slight impertinence pf this remark. I proceed; that is,
Mr. Walker does:—
"In that capacity I am called on to attend cases of midwifery. I have done so
in accordance with instructions issued by the Poor Law Commissioners. I have now
been kept out of my claim for three-quarters of a year; my charge is 10*. per case,
contracted with the Board of Guardians, and as their medical officer I am bound to
attend cases upon receiving an order to that effect from an overseer. Brill, with a
population of 1400 Inhabitants, has no resident midwife, and the relieving-officer
lives at Thame, a distance of seven miles. I have been at great trouble and exponso
coming over to the Board, endeavouring to get what is due to me, and tho last time
I attended I was told by tho Board that I had no claim upon them. If I have no
claim upon them, am I bound to attend to the orders of the overseers T"
A conversation here, it seems, ensued between you and Mr. Walker,
and that gentleman read the instructions issued by the Poor .Law
Commissioners, under which he had acted, and then lie appealed to you
as follows: with subsequent dialogue:—
"Ma. Walk™. What I have read are instructions supplied to us; are they not
in accordance with the Act of Parliament! , , „ . . ,f .fof„ j
"Mr. Sawyer referred his Honour to the Utter part of article48, where it stated
that orders issued by overseers must be in eases of sudden and urgent necessity
"The Jodoe. Do you considor that ordinary cases of confinement are those of a
sudden and urgent necessity T , , .. . n
"Ma. Walker. If I receive an order from an overseer, I am bound to attend.
You then laid the following obstetric law :—
"The Judoe. What I should term cases of sudden and urgent necessity would be
supposing that a woman was taken ill with childbirth on the road or in a field. I
should then have no difficulty in coming to a conclusion for tho plaintiff."
Now, how could you_ thus limit "cases of sudden and urgent
necessity," duly considering what is usually, ordinarily, and commonly
implied in "Run for the Doctor!" I know that some Judges are apt
to talk like old women. It would be paying you an unmerited com-
pliment to say that either the foregoing observation, or that imme-
diately subjoined, is anything like an old woman's, whatever may be
thought of your succeeding remark about the Guardians in their relation
to the pubhc purse, as '.though that were any reason why they should
decline to put money due into Mr. Walker's. Nor is the judgment
below recorded one which any old woman would have pronounced, under
the circumstances:—,
"The Judoe. Tho question is, who is to pay you t I am clearly of opinion that an
ordinary case of midwifery is not ono of sudden and urgent nooeasity, and, there-
fore, not one for which the Guardians would be liable to pay.
** Mb. Walker. How am I to act after this, when I receive an order to attend a
case? How is it possible for me to ascortain if it is a case that I may get paid for,
or one I am bound to attend at my own expense f
"The Judge. You must understand that the Board are not in this instance guar-
dians of thoir own purse, but of the public purse.
"Mr. Walker. Oh, yes I They are certainly guardians of the public purse.
"TheJuDOE. Judgment will be for defendants. Plaintiff is nonsuited."
However, you appear to have been prevailed upon to reconsider the
case; and—
"The overseers were then called, and Mr. Home, In reply to plaintiff, said, as
overseer he was applied to for the orders, and he considered they were cases of
necessity. Once or twice tho births took place in a few minutes after Mr. Walker
arrived there. He (the overseer) considered they were all cases requiring imme-
diate assistance; that some of the poor had not means to pay; and in one or two
instances tho parties for whom the orders were given were really in distressed
circumstances."
You stick to your opinion, however, refuse Mr. Walker's applica-
tion for an adjournment of the case, and again give judgment for the
defendants. That judgment is based on the position that the cases
which Mr. Walker was called upon to attend were not cases of urgency,
although iMa. Home, the overseer, swore that they were. I wonder
what conoeivable case requiring surgical aid you would consider a case
of urgency. Would a compound fracture of the skull be such a case,
would the case of a foreign body in the windpipe or a wound of the
femoral artery P As guardians of the public purse, not to mention their
own, the Thame Union Board will now perhaps expect you to decide
that not one of the cases just enumerated is a case of urgency among
paupers. What case can be, if not that in which, amongst the respect-
able classes, it is considered necessary to run for the doctor P Is not
this, Mr. Parry, parity of reasoning P Well now, Sir, suppose the
doctor is run for,'and does not come, in one of those cases which you
have ruled not to be cases of urgency, and, from accidents which Mr.
Walker can explain to you, the patient dies, what will a coroner's
jury say P Something doubtless, very hard of the doctor; unless the
case has occurred within the jurisdiction of the County Court over
which you preside; and then perhaps they will lay the death at nobody^
door, out oi deference to the judgment of Mr. Parry.
Accept, my dear Sir, the distinguished consideration of your remon-
strant servant, Pilgaexic.
Lxcim Place, March, 1864.
ADVERTISING A NEW ARTICLE.
It is well known that some seven Oxford clergymen, holding certain
dogmas ignored by the late decision of the Privy Council, have drawn
up a declaration of their belief of them, and sent it about to the rest of
the clergy for signature, as though with the view of constituting it
virtually a Fortieth Article. Not, however, content with the private
circulation of this document, they have actually published it in the
Timet, the Post, and other newspapers, as an advertisement, preceded
by the subjoined solicitation for names -.—
"The following Declaration, drawn up by a Committee appointed at a Mketiso
held at Oxford on February 25, 1S64, has been issued to every clergyman in
England and Ireland whoso address could bo ascertained. But, as there are upwards
of 3,000 of tho clergy whose addresses are uncertain, the Committee notify by
advertisement that signatures will be received by the Rev. W. B. Fbxmantlk,
Acting Secretary, or by any of tho Committee.
"Of tho many thousand names subscribed to the Declaration, the subjoined
names are published, in order to show the general concurrence with which it has
been received.
•*' (signed for the Committee) •' W. It. Fremantle, Acting Secretary,
"Claydon Rectory, Wlnslow."
Then comes the Declaration, undersigned by* about 209 Reverend,
some of them Very Reverend, Gentlemen. These, we are above
assured, are only a selection out of many thousands; or else we should
have been inclined to suspect, that the promoters of an Article 40,
having, apropos of the approaching Shakspeare Commemoration, been
studying the play of Richard III., had taken a hint from the manage-
ment with which Buckingham, as he relates to Ofoster, converted
"some ten voices" of "some followers of mine own'" into "general
applause and cheerful shout." We should have fancied that, m like
manner, the "general concurrence " of some 200 odd subscribera, out of
all the clergy, with the Oxford Declaration argued their doctrine and
consent with Pusey.
We wonder what Athanasius would have said to the idea of adver-
tising his creed in order to get it adopted by the Church. Pancy, if
printing had been invented in the fourth century, an advertisement in
the daily papers of the period, serving instead of a General Council.
Such a method of going to work to settle a point of theology would
not, perhaps, have tended to edify the heathen; nor can it be likely to
have much better effect in the present day. What next P We may
expect to see theological propositions posted on the walls, alongside of
gigantic playbills, and monster prints of scenes in a circus, and per-
formances of acrobats. We shall, perhaps, be invited, in colossal blue
and scarlet letters, to rush to this or that office or committee-room, and
record our vote for So-and-so, and such-and-such a definition of faith.
To advertise a new Article seems rather a commercial than a clerical
proceeding. It suggests the question, "What is the next Article P"
The Times, certainly, is an oecumenical journal; but the substitution of
advertising columns for ecclesiastical councils .cannot, at any rate, be
a Nice way of asserting orthodoxy.
Classical.
Were cheap Omnibuses known to the ancients?
Decidedly. When Julius Cssae was suffering from a violent cold,
Antony advised him not to go out walking on a rainy day, as he might
get his feet wet. "Meas pedes!" exclaimed the snuffling Dictator,
Jbo in pedi-bus;" evidently meaning, "penny-'bus."

A NEW PLAY BY SHAKSPEARE.
vk "facetious contemporary"
(need we name the Athenet-um f)
makes what, for want of further
evidence, we must presume to
be a joke, in its announcement
of the plays with which the
Shakspeare Festival in Lon-
don will be celebrated, which
our facetious contemporary in-
forms us will be these :—
"On Saturday, April 23, there
will be Shakspearian performances
at Drury Lane, the Haymarket,
Princess's, Adelphi, and St. James's;
also a grand Shakspearian fete at
the Crystal Palace. On Monday
evening, April 25. there will be a
Shakspeare performance at Sadler's
Wells and at the Strand ; on Tuesday,
April 26, at the Victoria; and on
Thursday, April 28, at the Surrey
and the Britannia. All these per-
formances will include a play or a
scene from Shakspeare. Mr. Buck-
stone will perform Twelfth Riant,
Bunkvm, and Venus and Adonis;
Mr. Falconer, Henry On Fourth;
and Mr. Fechter, Hamlet-"
We know that Shakspeare
wrote a poem called Venus and
Adonis, but we were not aware
that he composed it for the
stage. Will Ms. Buckstone,
we wonder, perform Venus or
Adonis? Whichever part he
takes, it will, doubtless, be a
treat to see him in the charac-
ter; and we shall certainly
endeavour not to miss the novel
sight.
But what are we to say to
the other play, called Bunkum,
which, after the comedy of Twelfth Night, Mr. Buckstone will perform i
We never before knew that Shakspeare wrote a piece called Bunkum;
and we must say, that we feel a little moved to wonder, that such men
as Messieurs Charles Knight, Collier, Halliwell, and Dyce
have, in all their Shakspeare huntings, never hunted up this play.
However, rather than accuse them of being sadly careless in making
their researches, we prefer to think this Bunkum is simply a production
of our jocose contemporary. Certainly, so far as our recollection serves
us, this is by no means the first time that our contemporary has some-
how mixed Bunkum up with Shakspeare; and we should not mind
predicting that it will not prove the last.

CABBY UNDER A MISTAKE.
The sympathies of our readers will not be invoked in vain on behalf
of the poor driver of a cabriolet whose affecting story may be thus
briefly related. His name was Charles Roffey, and he was hired by
Mr. Edward Weston, of Weston's Music-hall, Holborn, to drive him
from that place of entertainment to Tottenham-court Road; a distance
less than a mile. On reaching his destination Mr. Weston paid the
poor cabriolet driver the sum of 1*., being not more than only twice the
amount of his legal fare. Labouring under those excited feelings which
sometimes obtain the mastery of cabriolet drivers presented with a
remuneration which they deem inadequate, Roffey, unable to restrain
his emotions, gave utterance to them m observations addressed to cer-
tain other drivers of cabriolets who were standing by. To borrow the
words of a Bow Street Police Report wherein the foregoing particulars
are narrated, he, " addressing some other cabmen, told them that that
was Mr. Weston of the Music-hall, who had given him li., at the same
time applying some filthy expressions to liim." The customary utter-
ances ol an irritated cabriolet driver, suggestively described as filthy
expressions, will be familiar to most persons who are in the habit of
hiring cabriolets; and Mr. Weston, otfended with their application to
himself by Roffey, demanded his ticket, which Roffey declined to
give, and was retiring without delivering it, when he was arrested by a
policeman, and compelled to produce that token, which enabled Mr.
Weston to summon Turn before Mr. Hall for using abusive language.
The poor cabriolet driver was unable to deny the statement of Mr.
Weston, corroborated as it was by a policeman. He had, however, a
very remarkable excuse to offer in palliation of the offence which he had
committed. According to the above-quoted narrative:—
11 The prisoner said, ho had begun to move away beforo Mr. Weston asked for his
ticket; and. Indeed, ho was not going away altogether, but only to
He did not think he was guilty of using abusive language to MJL >
observations were addressed to the other cabmen."
Poor fellow! Who does not pity him that thinks of the very-
able mistake he made in supposing that he kept himself within
of the law so long as his observations touching Mr, Weston were made
not to that gentleman, but only at him?
The remainder of the tale is painful; but might have been more dis-
tressing. With regard to the observations which poor Rofpey had too
clearly intended for Mr. Weston's hearing:—
"Mr. Hall said, they were obviously meant to a
the other cabmen to derido him. Defendant must pay a fine of S0«.!
11 The defendant paid the fine."
He might have been unable to pay the fine, and, in default of pay-
ment, have been adjudged to a week at the treadmllL

BUOY THE LIFE-BOAT.
The deaths by fire, owing to crinoline, are very numerous, but no
statistics have given us the figures of the victims of tasteless vanity and
gregarious folly who, in consequence of wearing prodigious hooped
petticoats have been annually, during some years past, roasted alive
m their own grates. Great, however, as is the multitude that
perishes in the flames, it is smaller than the number of people killed
by water. The latter, too, has been partially ascertained, and, in so
far, consists principally of men, and mariners, to whom you gentlemen
of England that live at home at ease, and you ladies also, are indebted
for all the good tilings which you enjoy, besides home produce, and
including some of that.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Royal National Life-boat
Institution, held on Tuesday last week at the London Tavern, in the
report of the Committee then read, it was stated that:—
"With a shipping representing about fifty millions of tons, and 300,000
which cleared outwards and entered inwards from British ports during the past
year, a large uumbor of shipwrecks has become almost a natural sequence. Accord-
ingly it is found that 1,020 casualties took place last year on the shores and in the
seas of the British Isles, accompanied with the loss of 668 valuable lives—lives of
the utmost consequence to the commerce and defence of the country."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The sum of 568, 'in the preceding connection, is fearful enough, but
see below the amount which would have stood for it, but for the
exertions of the Life-boat Institution. The above-quoted paragraph
is followed by that which we rejoice to annex:—
"However, it is gratifying to find that during the same period 4,565 persons were
rescued by life-boats, the rocket-apparatus, shore-boats, and other means; 498 of
these owe their preservation to life-boats, 820 to the rocket apparatus, and 3,738 to
ships' own boats, steamers, fishing-boats, and other means."
After the enumeration of the above and other particulars, comes a
tabular statement of the number of lives per annum saved during the
last nine-aud-thirty'years. It may be sufficient to cite top and bottom
of thjs column, leaving the intermediate ciphers to be presumed:—
"In tho yoar
1824
No, of Lives Saved
124
In the year
1868
No. of Lives Saved
714
Let us, however,' append the total—13,568. Our Actuary being
otherwise engaged, we cannot at this moment get him to calculate the
pecuniary value of that number of lives, taken at the average on the
principles of a respectable and solvent Life Assurance Society, and can
only say that we should, like to have as much, in order to devote
ourselves to the gratuitous instruction and entertainment of mankind,
and the advocacy of all useful charities, amongst which the Life:boat
Institution will be allowed to rank, even by a Malthusian political
economist, and must be considered by everybody to hold almost, if not
quite, the very foremost place. Its operations are large and expensive;
their enlargement will .require increased expenditure. This Institution
will save more lives if it can get more money; and its bankers are
Messes. Willis, Pehcival, & Co., 76, Lombard Street • Messrs.
Coutts & Co., 59, Strand; and Messrs. Herrtes, Farqtjhar
& Co., 16, St. James's Street, London. Subscriptions may also be
sent to all the Bankers in the United Kingdom, or to any one of them
by persons whose means are not unlimited, and will also be received,
with a hooray, by the Secretary, Richard Lewis, Esq., at the office
of the Institution, 14, John Street, Adelphi, London, W.C. The
numerous testimonials to successful speculators, and other somebodies
of consequence to nobody but their sycophants and toadies, daily
advertised in the papers, prove that there are at present many persons
who have much more money than they well know what to do with. If
they do not send all of it to the Office, 85, Fleet Street, they had better
send some, if not all of it, to that of the Life-boat Institution.

DRINKING THE SHAMEFUL."
ear Mr. Punch,—Do yon
ever smoke? For your
own sake and your wife's,
I sincerely hope you don't.
I never would speak
harshly of other people's
weaknesses, but I nave no
sympathy with smokers,
so you may fancy with
what pleasure I seize on
every chance of saying a
bad word for them, and
bringing them to ridicule
and well-deserved con-
tempt.
Now, did you notice the
account that Mr. Gipford
Palgrave gave before
the lloyal Geographical
Society of his travels in
Arabia and his visit to the
Wahabites? These delight-
ful people (you will see
soon why I call them so)
are pious followers of
Mahomet, who live in the great central .plateau of Arabia, and are
more rigorous in adhering to the precepts of the Koran than Mahqm-
medans in general may be presumed to be. From the interesting
account which Mr. Palgrave gave of them, I must ask you just to
print the following short extract, for the benefit of people who may
think themselves more civilised and'mentallv enlightened than are these
benighted heathens, as we presume to call them:—

"The founder of this sect, Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab, who was born about a century
since at tho beautiful town of Hormeilcmeh (through which Mr. Palgrave passed),
revived the Mahommedan precepts in all their pristine strictness, so that any one
desirous of understanding what Islamism resembled in its palmy days of early
enthusiasm could not do better than visit Riadh. His followors are divided into
mollahs, or spiritual guides, who have nothing but learning and devotion to recom-
mend tbcm, and the great body of the people, who are governed by an hereditary
despotism, perhaps tho strictest and most extraordinary of any recorded in history.
So rigorously are the precepts of the Koran observed, that a debasing fatalism
supplies the place of all religion, of which Mr. Palorave cited some ludicrous
examples. Moreover, there is to Western notions the most grotesque disproportion
in the classification of great and little sins. Such sins as murder, robbery, and the
like are those of which Providence reserves the condign punishment to himsolf,
whereupon, 'Alla.hu Kherim 1' (' God is merciful 1') is the consolation that the
faithful believer mutters to account for the culprit escaping his just doom. On the
other hand, tho most deadly and abominable of all sins is tobacco-smoking 1—
'drinking the shameful I' as it is termed by the horror-stricken Wabaatte,"
Through the unlucky accident that I was born "a Christian, I can't
quite go so far as to say that I think murder is a less offence than
smoking, or to state as my opinion that "all smokers should be hanged.
But it would certainly delight me were they viewed with the same
horror that a murderer excites in ns, and were a very severe punish-
ment awarded for their crime. "Drinking the Shameful" is a very
proper name for it, and I should wish all shameful-drinkers excluded
from Society as rigidly as niggers are excluded in New York.
This, to some unthinking persons, may appeal; a harsh opinion; but
there really is no calculating what we, as a nation, have lost by letting
wretches drink the sliameful" here in England, and how immensely
we should gain by their immediate extirpation.
Mr. Palgrave says expressly, that the Wahabites display more taste
in their street-architecture than Londoners can boast of; and it is
clear their taste is purer, because they do not vitiate it by that per-
nicious practice whioh they so fitly speak of as "drinking the shame-
ful." Then see how hospitable and kind they are to travellers who
visit them, and how tolerant to those who differ from them in religion.
Such virtues are caused, doubtless, by mere abstinence from smoking,
which destroys the finer feelings while it ruins the digestion, and dries
up all the channels whioh afford vent for the generous emotions
of the heart. As men become dyspeptic, they grow dogmatic and
churlish: and I feel aure, that the bigotry which has robbed Pro-
fessor Jowett of the salary now due to him has mainly had its origin
in the fact that Oxford men are sadly fond of smoking, and thereby
have beoome less tolerant than the Wahabites, whom, as poor benighted
heathens, they are anxious to exterminate, or at all events convert.
Trusting soon to see an Anti-Drinking League established, which
shall include among its members the Drinkers of the Shameful, I beg
leave to subscribe myself, Yours without prejudice,
A Tobacco Stopper.
FRUSTRATION OF FOREIGN POLICY.
Oh i let us adhere to strict non-intervention,
Except by advice and remonstrance alone.
Between foreign nations engaged in contention,
Unless we have interests at stake of our own.
In going to war we don't know where we 're going to.
The course of events to predict what man dares?
And the Statesman will say this uncertainty's owing to
The great mutability of foreign affairs.
Full many a faithless desertion has taught us
To know that we never can trust our allies.
Forget not the lore that experience has bought us,
If you arc not less than the least of the wise.
Our friends of to-day may our foes be to-morrow;
And when you are left in the lurch, unawares,
Oh! then you too late will remember, with sorrow,
The great mutability of foreign affairs.
The tortuous paths of the neighbouring nations
Are not like our own ways straightforward and plain,
They fight for ideas, that is, annexations,
All keeping a look-out their own ends to gain.
And those who are leagued with us fail us whenever
It suits them'; behold, in this conduct of theirs,
That makes intervention a hopeless endeavour,
The great mutability of foreign affairs.
Full well we know what is war's only sure issue;
Much money to spend, and to lose many men.
Your alien friends will most certainly dish you,
May side with your enemies—where are you then?
Alone in the glory of vain self-devotion,
A load of taxation to leave to your heirs,
And ponder, meanwhile, with indignant emotion,
The great mutability of foreign affairs.
Alike if we join, or decline interfering
In foreigners quarrels, they give us ill names,
Inveighing against us, and railing, and sneering,
Because our intentions don't square with their aims.
Then steadfastly leave them alone to their changes,
And ever keep clear of their pitfalls and snares,
Considering what calculation deranges;
The great mutability of foreign affairs.

PAYNE v. PATER.
See Middlesex Sessions Report for Wednesday and Thursday, March 23rrf
and 2ith.
Mr. Payne may be vain, to crack small jokes too fain,
And the least in the world of a prater,
But not three times Payne's funning, or prosing or punning,
Could excuse the impert'nence of Pater.
If your Smith, Jones or Brown, when he dons wig and gown,
Peels tempted to play the dictator,
And to let loose his fury, on Judge and on Jury,
Let him take timely warning by Pater.
Punch knows not the person he's spending his verse on,
And his luck he conceives is the greater,
For to write himself fully both blunderer and bully,
Seems the principal object of Pater.
No doubt of his fitness to browbeat a witness,
Like a brazen-faced Bar Billingsgater,
Or a foreman to hector, who dares turn protector
Of the witness insulted by Pater.
But for higher vocations, that ask taste or patience,
Law or argument, tact or good-natur*,
Mr. Punch's impression's that Middlesex Sessions
Wouldn't find him a client of Pater.
When some poor wretch is bullied, his character sullied,
With additions of snob, sot, or satyr,
When jury's been fleered at, and judge has been sneered at,
There's an end of the prowess of Pater.
With Payne he felt pleasure his valour to measure,
Proved himself in abuse a first-rater,
But as thunder draws rain, so on pleasure came pain,
In a twenty-pound fine upon Pater.
For Payne has an odd kin in person of Bodkin,
A practised snob-anniliilator.
Pater Payne had defied, ere he'd Bodkin at side,
But Payne with his Bodkin floored Pater.
Then more power to the Bench, and may Counsel who'd trench
On its rights meet a stunning negatur:
And may Payne ne'er want Bodkin to pickle his rodkin
For tickling the toby of Pater!

THE TRAGEDY OF WILLIAM I.
Y n telegram from Ber-
lin we find that:—
"Tho Nfiu PrtwtUche
(Kreue) Zeitunff of to-day
says :—
'' Wo learn that tho Kin?,
on the anniversary of his
birthday, in a most cordial
manner expressed to the
Ministry his approval of
tho policy adopted, both
at home and abroad."
As the last anniver-
sary of the King of
Pucssia's birthday was
the 67th, nobody whose
desires are bounded by
possibility could con-
fidently wish him many
happy returns of it.
Tlirce more, happy or
otherwise, are, unless
they are destined to
exceed the average
number, all that can
await him; and, unless
he alters his courses,
more than anybody who
thinks thousands of
good lives of more
consequence than one evil life, can hope that he will see. The drama,
therefore, of his Prussian Majesty's life being so near it b close as it
is, and its approaching conclusion so clearly as it must be in his
Majesty's view, astonishment is created by nis approval of a policy
which, whatever it may be at home, is abroad]a policy of murder. He
must know that the curtain is about to fall on an Act comprising the
murder of the Danes, dictated by a policy which he avows as his own.
Is it possible that he does not ask himself, when the curtain shall
have fallen on the last Act of a life which thus winds up with the
authorship of a host of murderous atrocities, what is likely to be the
fate of the piece and the performer f

a case can be made out against you f

Witness. My Lord, he did take—

know that it was this man?
Witness. I have known him, I should think, for—

thing?
Witness. I was walking—
The Ixtw.' Who asked whether you were walking, or riding, or flying,
or crawling on your stomach? Answer the question. Did you sec him?
Witness. Yes, my Lord.
The Law. Was it at night or in the day?
Witness. At night.
The Late. Can you see in the dark P
Witness. There was a moon, my Lord.
The Law. Of course there was; but did it shine?
Witness. Very brightly.
The Law. You can swear that it was he, and no one else?
Witness. Yes, my Lord.
The Law. Do you know that he has a brother very like him?
Witness, It wasn't his brother, my Lord.
The Law. Answer the question, or you '11 get into trouble. Do you
know the fact that his brother is very like him?
Witness. He is not so very like, my Lord.
The Law. How dare you say that? It is only your opinion. Will
you swear that there was light enough to enable you to be certain that
this was the man?
Witness. I know the fellow well enough, my Lord.
The Law. How dare you call him names? You dislike him,
evidently, and the jury will be cautious in accepting your evidence. Be
careful, Sir!
Prisoner. He tells the truth, my Lord. I did—
The Law. Hold your tongue, my poor man.
Prisoner. But it is true that I toolc—
The Law. Keep him silent, Gaoler. Go down, you Sir, and feel
ashamed of having shown animosity in that sacred box. Gentlemen of
the Jury,—Such charges are easily made, but disproved with difficulty.
The witness had evidently an animus. The prisoner has borne a good
character, at least nothing has been proved against him, ana his
readiness to admit everything is creditable to him. Still, it is for you
to say, Guilty or Not Guilty.
Jury. Guilty, my Lord!
The Law. As the Jury has found you guilty of stealing these sove-
reigns, prisoner, I have only to pass sentence, which I shall make very
light. You will be imprisoned, without hard labour, for a month.
Prisoner. I can do that on my head, my Lord.

Scene—A French Court of Justice.
The Law. Prisoner, I am afraid you arc an awful scoundrel. Why
don't you confess, and mako reparation to society?
Prisoner. Because I am innocent.
The Late. You say that with a certain impudence which proves you
hardened in crime. How came you to rob your master P
Prisoner. I never did.
The Late. This reiteration of a plea which is clearly false is dis-
respectful to the Court, and will aggravate your punishment. Are you
fond of the theatre P
Prisoner. Yes.
The Law. That denotes a love of pleasure which is frequently found
united with dishonesty. Do you smoke?
Prisoner. A good deal.
The Law. Doubtless, to stupify the reproaches of a menacing con-
science. Do you go to mass?
Prisoner. At regular times.
The Law. That show* you to be a hypocrite. Now, witness, is ho
notguilty?
Witness. No, my Lord.
The Law. How dare you say that? Did you commit the crime your-
self?
Witness. Certainly not.
The Law. Don't answer in that petulant way. What is your character?
Are you fond of the theatre?
Witness. No.
The Law. Just so. A dark and gloomy nature cannot enjoy innocent
recreation. Do you smoke f
Witness. Very little.
The Law. You fear to be traced by the smell of your clothes. You
know that tobacco increases our revenue, and you wilfully abstain in
order to injure your country. Do you go to mass?
Witness. Seldom.
The Jmw. You feel your evil cliaracter unfits you for the solemnities
of the Church. Go down. The next. Now, what have you to say,
woman P
Witness. The accused is an excellent husband—
The Law. Are you his wife P
Witness. No, my Lord, but his wife's friend, and I know—
The Law. Then the less you have to say in future to the wife of an
accused person the better. Perhaps you arc in love with him.
Witness. My Lord, I have a husband whom I love, and children
whom I adore, and because any of them might be charged falsely, as the
prisoner is, I came to say what I can for justice.
The Law. That theatrical sentiment you have learned from some play,
and your reciting it here is most indecent. Go down. Gentlemen of
the Jury,—It is quite clear that this scoundrel is gudty. His insolent
denials, the class of witnesses, atheists, profligates, frequenters of
theatres, gloomy conspirators, and the like make his guilt evident:
besides which a gaoler neard him say Mon JJieu in sleep, which showed
temporary remorse. Finally. I happen to know that he is guilty, for
I knew his father in his'youth, and ue was a vile assassin. Gentlemen,
you have only to say Guilty.
The Jury. Not Guilty.
The Law. You are a contumacious set of rebellious and illogical pigs,
and I shall see whether the Procurcur of his Majesty cannot deal with
you as conspirators. Meanwhile, abandon the box you have dis-
graced, [Exeunt the jurymen, confirmed in Imperialism.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
(Or rather the want of it.)
We instance the following as a good specimen of unintentional gaucherie:—
"Mb. Fechter, wbilo playing in Bel Demonio, injured his arm through some complication
with his sword hiit. Tho piece having been under-studied, Ma. Jordan at once assumed the
character of Angtto in this emergency. 1 he injury is not serious."
What injury? The injury of Mb. Jordan playing Mr. Fechter's part? If
so, we can assure our blundering contemporary that the injury, far from being
"serious," was so slight as not to have been noticed by the public in the least.
We cannot accuse Public Opinion, from whom we are quoting, of quizzing, for
it is generally so staid, and solemn, and soberly collected; but if it cannot quiz
with oetter taste, it had better abandon the habit altogether for the future. It is
only adding insult to "injury" to attempt to turn into ridicule a deserving
actor, who had zealously taken up the part of a brother-player who had met
with a severe accident. Fie, fie, Public Opinion,
LADIES WHO ARE THE MOST PRESENTABLE IN AMERICA.
Here is a paragraph that carries its own acceptable weight with it:—
11 It is stated, that some ladies in tho Southern Confederacy are sending their plate to the
Treasury as a free offering to their country to relieve the pressure od the currency."
The Confederates, whilst they bless the above fair donors, may congratulate
themselves that their cause is not so black as the soi-disa/it friends of the slave
would wish to paint it. The "plate" thus freely given, is a consoling illustration
of the saying, that there is " no cloud so dark but what has its silver lining." Ladies
must be patriots indeed, who so disinterestedly give their "services" to their
suffering country. We have heard of kingdoms being conquered with gold.
Why then should not the South win its independence by means of silver? Should
the Confederates ever be victorious, they will be citizens, no longer of the American,
but the Argentine, Republic. Out of compliment to the sacrifice of their zealous
countrywomen, they ought then to change the name of the Mississippi to that of the
River Plate.

"AMERICAN ENLISTMENTS IN IRELAND.
"The Irish citizens of Cbarlcstown and Boston have been greatly excited this
week, in consoquenco of the arrival in Charlestown of So young Irishmen from the
city of Dublin, under extraordinary circumstances. These young men, 102 in all,
left Liverpool on February 27, in a steamer for Portland, which reached that city
on Wednesday morning, March 9. The men took au early breakfast, and then
landed. A few of them strayed away from their companions, but the remainder
came on to Boston in the afternoon train, in charge of tho emigrant agent, a Mr.
Finney, under whoso inducements and promises they left their homes. The men
are fine, stalwart follows, young mechanics, all from the city of Dublin. Their
story is, that they were induced to come to this country through the representa-
tions of this Mr. Finney, who was announced in the papers as an "emigration
agent for the principal railroads in New England, who was commissioned to pro-
cure 1,000 labourers. Tho terms he offered tbem were a froe passage, work imme-
diately on arrival, a new suit of clothes, and two pounds a month and found, for
wages."
Ye see this Mb. Finnet, the Emma Grating agent towld us a big lie
whin he said he'd got a railway over here for us to work on, where
we'd git two pounds a month forbye a suit of clothes and a free passage
across, not to mint ion that he promised us free lodgins* an' free living,
wid turtle soop an' beefsteaks like the Lord Mare gits in London. See
this, now, how the spalpeen has desaved the boys who'd faith in
him :—
"Upon their arrival in this city the men were conducted to an old building on
Bunker-bill Street, Charlestown, belonging to Mr. Jerome G. Kidder, of this city,
formerly used for his business purposes, but now improved as a * Mission House.'
"Mr. Kidder, the owner of tho building, presented himself on the night of their
arrlval, and told tho men, so it is reported by several of them, that the work they
were brought over to do was not ready. But that need mako no difference; they
need not bo idle a singlo day. They could enlist at once ; and he recommended
the 38th, an Irish regiment, to them. Upon this the suspicions were confirmed,
which had been growing upon the men, that they had been deceived and enticed
from their homes upon false protencea. Mb. Finnet now declares himself to be
agent for Mr. Kidder; and Wit Kidder protests, that he caused the men to bo
brought over here In good faith, actually and bond fide to work upon tho Charles-
town Waterworks. * * *
"Tho condition of the men the morning after their arrival in Charlestown was
anything but gratifying. Their number had already been diminished by those loft
behind at Portland, and of these tho recruiting agents had snapped up eight.
Without money, without friends, with scanty clothing, with no means to procure
sustenance, they would have suflbred greatly had not kind-hearted countrywomen
supplied their wants. Recruiting agents hovered round them, and in the cuurse of
the day gobbled up several. Yesterday morning they were still in Hunker-bill
Street, subsisting upon charity, and stiU pestered with rcciuiting agonts."
Tim, may be ye will mind how the English jintleman we met upon
the Key the night whin I left Doblin, an' by jaggcrs! he's a Jintleman
if ever one was made, forbye his pavin' for the whisky so ginrous as he
did, an' betther luck nor mine to him! I mind me how he towld us to
take care of ourselves an' not to trust thim Emma grating agents, an'
bad scran to them! And, whin I towld him I'd engaged mcself to
come across wid Mistrer Finney, he said he feared that Finney was
a fishy sort of name, and he hoped I wouldn't find a shark in him who
had it. By me sowl, an' he was right, an' I was wrong in leavin'
Doblin, for though I wasn't rich whin there, I'm now no betther off,
an' faix! a big deal worse I 'in thinking. Maybe I will turn sodger jist
to keep meseli alive, an' if I don't git shot maybe I 'U die of sheer star-
vation. I've no call to enlist, an' git my brains blowed out wid a small
swoord or a bagginet; but what am I to do to work myself a living
whin there's no work to be got, an' the only way of living is just to
run the chance of dyin' as a sodger?
So, Tim, me boy. I'd bid ye, if ye 're thinking to come over, jist
think twice about the matther, an' maybe second thoughts will turn
out to be best for ye. I like fightin' in coorse, wid a shillelagh in my
fist an' a friend or two to foight wid me. But foightin' wid an inimy's
another thing intirely, an' I think I'd feel no pleasure in gittin' my
skull cracked wid a big swoord or a blunderbust. So, Tim, if ye 'rc
in Doblin, ye'd best stay where you are until the foighting here is over,
and thin if I'm not kilt maybe ye'U find'me livin'here, and ready to
resave you wid a shake of honest hands, an' not wid a false mouth like
that ould shark, Mistber Finney, the mersheuary dechaiver as he is,

"Wednesday-morning last as ever rose, you says,'says you,
"It Is already, daring the few brlof weeks that the Session has lasted, ovident
enough that Lo»d Falmzmtoh's strength Is unequal to the duties of leadership in
that assembly. Constant absences on account of illness, confused recollection of
details, inability to answer questions upon current eTents without gross blunders,
and, above all, the obvious loss ot power to carry on a debate as the hours of the
night advance—all these symptoms tell their own tale too plainly."
Mrs. 0. Love and bless your dear memory, Susan, what a mind you
have, and I feel quite encouraged by having the privilege of calling of
you by the name of friend.
Mrs. II. The same here, Ma'am, I'm sure, and more. Yes, Sairey,
what this here nation wants is Wigger.
Mrs. G. We hoes it to the nation, Susan, to be wiggcrous. I'm not
a denying that there was a time when old Pam had something in him,
but bless your art, that's gonebyes. It ain't that them as you knows
and that I knows and that knows us and trusts us according, it ain't
that those parties wants to tako Hoffice—You know that, my woman?
Mrs. H. Ask me if I know it. Why, it was only last week as that
dear boy Ben, which will be sixty please the pigs he comes to next
year, he says to me, "Susan," says he, and you recollect what a chyce of
languidge Ben has—
Mrs. G. Ah, yes, wot did you call it, "not unadorned but hornet
eloquence."
Mrs. II. Hornate, my dear woman, when you write to your friends.
Mrs. 0. My friends can understand me, Ma'am, and when they don't

Mrs. H. No offence, Sairey.
Mrs. G. Which is not taken when not meant, Susan, and your elth.'
Mrs. H. In love. Which I was saying, Ben says to me, and I hope
not to worsen his langwidge by carrying the same, "Susan." says he,
"wold I exchange the mellifluous bowers of pleasant Huglicndcn for
the stultifarious invocations of horfice, but for the stale small vice of
Dopty as simmums me to haction," says he.
Mrs. G. Ah! Dooty's a holy thing, Susan.
Mrs. H. Which it are, Sairey, and we '11 drink its elth.
Mrs. G. Coupling, if I might be so bold, the sentiment, "A speedy
return of a wiggerous Ministry to horfice."
Mrs. H. We nave kept these people in power long enough, my dear.
Mrs. G. That we have. And -borne with too many of .their short-
comings, and too much of their owdacjous sauce, my dear.
Mrs. H. But the line must be draweir somewhere, and we must, draw
it at Wigger.
Mrs. G. That we must. It a pitchus spectacle, Susan, to behold old
Pam. That boy Ben is obleeged to lead the Ouse for him.
Mrs. H. And that's very kind in him, and how ungrateful is the
return, Sairey. To be tola one lets off Fireworks, and makes Hash
Speeches.
Mrs. G. Shocking, dear. But bad langwidge is hever a sintom of
decaying powers.
Mrs. H. In all Rotchfewcoal's Apathies there ain't a truer
maximum, my loved Sairey. You never hear Loed Derby say nothing
in the way of taunt, or try to cast obliquity on another party.
Mrs. G^ Never, my dear; and here's his elth, and may that true
nobleman.twhich never has constant absences on account of illness, and
scorns the gout, soon, assume his rightful place in the bawls ot the
Sufferings. * '■
Mrs. II. And'dear Mammy, won't it do our arts good to see
Mammyboy again a Foreign Officer?
Mrs. G. Don't be so fast, my good woman.1' He is a dear fellow, but
he was thought to be rayther too much of a Foreign Officer, as you call
it, and the required article, M'm, is an English officer.
Mrs. H. Sairey, you would wex a saint, which I am not at present:
nevertheless, doing my dooty in the spear in which I circulate, anil
asking you to tako back Woman, would purseed to ask you where's your
Englishman for your Foreign Horfice F
Mrs. Q. I thought as much, Ma'am.
Mrs. H. And how much might you be pleased to think, Ma'am?
Mrs. G. Bin, or to call a gentleman by bis right name, Mb.
Disreallt, Susan, aperiently does not open all his confidence to you,

Unfairs.
Mrs. II. Wavering your politeness, Ma'am, which would go into my

Budget P For well you know, Mrs. Gamp, and yon can't deny it, as
none of our men but Mr. Disreally can be trusted with more figures
than they can do on their fingers.

GARIBALDI'S SWELL GD1DE.
The following observations on the reception proper to be given to
Garibaldi, when he comes to London, were delivered by the
Honourable Mr. Gakdaw in the smoking room of the Ne Flu
Ultra „•—

weally ought to give the fellah a weception in some way, faw alUiw
the fellah s a fine fellah in his way; a sawt of hewo. What A'm afvw
of is, that the fellah'11 fall into the hands of the snobs. Of cainehe
must go and be glawwified by the Aldamen, and be feasted by the Lact
Maya, and pwesented with the fweedom of the City, and all that
sawt of thing; but A do awnestly hope that he has some judicious
fwend to keep him fwom fwattanising with the wnwking men, and the
people; because if he does that fellah will wenda it impossible fa*
fellahs to wecognise the fellah.
The wight sawt of thing would be a dinna at the Wag and Famish,
and the pwincipal quack clubs with the officaws of the quack wegiments;
to show himself at the Opwa and in Wotton Woe; but not much in
the stweets, in fact, scassly eva to the people, except, yes, except at the
Dawby. Then, there might be a dinna aw two at the Twafalga, ana
pawhaps at the Stah and Gahtah. He should be advised to vide,
mostly, instead of walking, and not to encourage crowds wound nis
hauce in demonstwative upwaw; and A should like to pwesent him. g
way of testimonial, with an eyeglass faw him to inspect the pc°Ple
thwough.
When he goes to dine at ;the Mansion House A would havei him *°

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM A LADY CORRESPONDENT.

Y dear Mr. Punch,—I
have just read this ridicu-
lous paragraph in one of
Papa's newspapers, and
though he scolds dreadfully
at us girls cutting bits out,
which we often do when we
find anything awfully good.
I shall risk his dear old
anger:—
"Smoking ik Railway Car-
riages.—Tho practice of smok-
ing in railway carriages is of-
fensive to many non-smokers,
and especially to women, and
we trust that railway boards
and railway managers will re-
new their efforts to check and
discourage it The railway
smoking-carriage is impracti-
cable and unattainable, and so
the smoker must make up his
mind to forego his cherished
luxury on railway journeys.
This is no real hardship, and
gallantry demands that sacrifice
of comfort should be made by
tho stronger sex. Let railway-
guards be cautioned against any
laxity of practice. It might
even be well to reward them
for doing their duty in such
cases with firmness and cour-
tesy."—Railway Newi.
My dear Mr. Punch, did- you ever read such horrible nonsense?
"Women," as the scribbler politely calls us, like the smell of a good
cigar (not wretched sixpenny things, of course) beyond all things, and
no girl but would prefer a man's being a little smoky to his carrying
perfume. As for any idiotic and fantastic women who can't bear a
cigar in a train, let them stay at home, they have no business to travel.
I do not smoke, but I may confess to you that il have often said
"Please, smoke," to my cousins and their friends, and I have more
than once delighted them, when they fancied no fire was to be had, by
producing a Vesta from my purse. I once made them smoke in a
carriage, in order to drive out a rude old gentleman who made a face at
my crinoline, and he was so frantic you can't think, but as the train
was express, and didn't stop, he could not complain, and he had no
witnesses. 1 dare say it was he who wrote the ridiculous and ill-
natured paragraph. Pray, my dear Punch, explain to all gentlemen
that it is quite a mistaken notion about our not liking cigars (but then
they must be good ones, you know), and if ever you come into our part
of the country, and we meet in a train, perhaps—I only say perhaps—
I may bite on the end of a very choice weed (don't you call them
weeds ?) for you. As to the guards, all gentlemen bribe them, and why
should not the poor men have an occasional half-crown. I am sure
they work hard enough. Anybody may smoke good tobacco where
I am, and I am not a fast girl, for all that, and mean to make a very
good wife. A ridiculous old idiot! Please show him up, that's a dear.
Believe me, yours very devotedly,
The Hawthorns. Arabella Brick.
necessary as so much fuel is for the performance of a steam-engine. We
can't stint a convict as we stint a pauper, unless we put aim to a
pauper's lighter work. Flesh and blood will not sustain hard labour on
workhouse diet. The hard labour of the crank and the treadmill can
only be done on the strength of a certain quantity of molasses, cocoa,
bread, meat, and potatoes, and, when done, it is a simple waste of that
amount of nutriment consumed. For the stomach is a furnace in its
way, equally with the stokehole of that steam-engine which multiplies
almost to infinity the numbers of your ubiquitous periodical.
I propose, then, Mr. Punch, that we should contrive, if we can, to
store up the force which many of our convicts in working a mere handle,
or treading a bare plank, unconnected with any useful mechanism, are
now only wasting on the prison air.
For instance, they might be employed in pumping atmospheric air
into iron cylinders furnished with valves like those which close the
chambers of air-guns, to keep the air in. The force put into the
convicts in the form of meat and vegetables, would thus be stored in
the compressed air, which it, put forth again in muscular power, had
driven into the cylinders. A proper register connected with the treadle,
or handle, by which the fellows worked the pump, would show when
they had condensed the requisite number of atmospheric volumes. The
cylinders thus stored with muscular force, so many reservoirs of hard
labour, could be put by and kept, to be applied, when wanted, to
furnish the motive power of their contents to any purpose for which it
might be suitable.
Other and better plans of bottling convict labour for use than the
method above proposed may occur to some of your many clever readers.
In that case sufficient effect will have been produced by the suggestion
of your diligent student, Abel Handy.
P.S. I am trying to invent some means of effecting the conservation
of that force which is vainly expended, and as I say, squandered, in
dancing.
HARD LABOUR IN STORE.
Mr. Punch,
Op course you know all about the Conservation of Force. You
know that the Conservation of Force is especially instanced in the Coal
Fields. You know that the force conserved in the Coal Fields is that
of the sun, which, vivifying pre-Adamite tree-ferns and other cryptogams,
extracted and appropriated to them carbon from the atmosphere, thus
incorporating itself in their substance, of which coals arc tne remains,
and now lying stored up in the coals. You know that we can extract
the sunbeams from coa& if we cannot get them out of cucumbers.
You know that the force of the sun, latent in coals, is reproduced
from them in the form of light and heat, and you know that heat is our
principal motive force, much exceeding that of horses. You know that
our magazines of force, the coal fields, are in course of exhaustion, which
must be completed at no very distant date, and that scientific men
cannot at present conceive what we shall possibly do for force when all
our coals will have been used up.
Now, Mr. Punch, the foregoing considerations surely prove that we
ought to economise force as much as ever we can, and not throw away
any force which we could anyhow save.
But, Sir, we are throwing force away in the muscular exertions of
every convict whom wc employ in unproductive labour. And of course
we are throwing money away in all the food that is required to keep up
the convict's muscular power. For that purpose so much food is as
OPPOSITION SAILING DIRECTIONS.
{For Getting-in.)
(BY SIR STAFFORD NORTBXOTE, ADMIRAL OF THE TRUE-BLUE.)
Toss up your caps, rank and file of back-benchers,
Talk big and bounceably, Tadpoles and Tapers;
For loaves to your cup-boards and fish to your trenchers,
Shout, slander, agitate, clamour for papers!
Pitch into Palmerston, ridicule Russell, boys—
(Osborne will help you to gag for the galleries)—
Work the MAZZiNi-cry, Young Stansfeld hustle, boys—
All sticks arc good to beat Whig dogs from salaries!
If things look warlike, lay all to the Minister,
Whose hot head thrusts peaceful Britannia on slaughter:
If things look peaceful, point the thumb sinister
At the sneaks who on John Bull's high heart throw cold water.
If they talk tall, say they 're blust'rers and bullies—
"Meddle and Muddle" an excellent phrase is—
If they sing small, style them spiritless cullies,
Who haven't.the pluck to go boldly to blazes!
Yon '11 find hosts of weak points, if you but put your souls in it;
First, take all they've not done; and if that's not sufficient,
Take all that they've done, and pick all sorts of holes in it;
Prove 'em neither omnipotent, nor yet omniscient.
Show their dealing with Church-rates a bungle and blunder,
(You needn't, of course, admit ours much the same was;
Show how in attempts at Reform they've knocked under—
(Not a word of wuat Dizzy's Reform little game was).
Point to the storms on the Continent brewing,
Ask if these are the pilots for shoals and rough seas?
Say a deal of what our friends would not think of doing,
But on what they would do, keep as dark as you please.
An indefinite programme one's future releases,
And no hand is so strong as the one that's not shown;
Our business just now's to tear their game to pieces,
When we 're in, 'twill be time to consider our own.
A Painful Reflection.
It is in matrimony, as in warfare, there is many a conference without
an armistice. In fact, we have known (to our sorrow, be it mentioned,
as well as the sorrow of innumerable others) the fighting to have been
all the fiercer whilst the conference was going on, and even to have
continued with tremendous severity long after the conference had been
over. It may appear like weakness, or cowardice, not to have parted
the belligerents, out the truth is intervention, in such cases, is always
a most perilous proceeding. He who interferes generally is exposed to
the fire of both sides.

The IIon. Mr. Cowpir, in declining to
let a procession enter the Green Park, on
Shaksfkare's birthday, in order to plant an
oak* (the cheapest testimonial we have yet
heard of, a little oak costing, we believe, the
modest sum of one and threepence) said—
"It U understood. It will be Impossible, on tfcc

THIS YEAR'S PICTURES.
To Mr. Punch.
Dear Sir,
In obedience to your instructions, and while waiting the time
to visit the studios of my more distinguished friends, I have gone the
round of the R.A.'s, or Rising Artists, who have not yet succeeded in
tting their pictures exhibited, but who hope for better luck this year,
have also to state, that, in consequence of these visits, my garments
mvc become so irrcclaimably scented with tobacco of the strongest
type, that certain differences of sentiment between myself and the
partner of my bosom and expenses have arisen; and, in order to pre-
vent, unpleasantness, I have withdrawn to Brighton.
Young Bolligrobbs has made much progress. His domestic picture,
Skinning Eels is very pure and conscientious, and he has evidently
studied the subject very lovingly; and a half-skinned eel endeavouring to
make its escape, and being seized by the cat, is a charming little episode.
Jollopf.r has executed hut one picture, but it is very fine. It is called
the Masonic Lodge, and he has represented with the utmost fidelity all
the costumes, emblems, and signs of masonry. The scene has dramatic
interest. An intrusive waiter at the Freemasons' Tavern has forced his
way into the Lodge, just as a new brother is going to be made, and has
instantly been cut down by the sword of the Tiler, while the Grand
Master, waving the red hot gridiron, denounces the profane miscreant.
The terror of the novice can be seen through the white night-cap drawn
over his face. Yowls has been very busy indeed, he has painted twenty-
nine works of great force and merit, but the best, I may say facile prin-
cept, is his Execution of Sam Hall, which has been done for the Society
for the Diffusion of Capital Punishments, and it is a master-piece of
gloomy grandeur. I believe that a well-known Comedian of the day has
sat for the culprit, whose expression of grim and humorous pathos is
worth whole sermons. Chiddlewicker is scarcely up to the mark of
Chiddlewickerism, if I may coin a word, yet his Giblets axe very truthful
and earnest, and the gizzard iu the foreground is worthy of Correggio.
Perhaps his lJamb,s Fry is more poetical, but is deficient in grouping.
Miss Matilda Tinkler has executed a marvellous work, and one
which will create a sensation by its unrivalled boldness. It is the Fight
for the Championship, and represents King delivering the awful blow
which prostrated the American Giant. You can hear the "thud," and
the crimsoned ground is depicted with Pre-Raphaelite literalness and
honesty. The faces are all portraits, and the leading nobility have sat
to Miss Tinkler. The likeness of the Bishop of Oxford is superb.
Her sister, Miss Rosamund Tinkler, has a clever little drawing-room
piece, The Stretcher, and the calm sternness of the Police as they carry
away a strapped and raging virago is very fine. The work is to be
engraved for an illustrated and splendid edition of the "Women of
England." Mrs. Spanker has done a touching little work. HisFint
Caning, which will be a favourite in all educational estah^hmenU.
The boy has been rather frightened than hurt, andSe Haking bff his
shoe to hurl it at another who was clearly the tell-tale. Anotk-r%J,
who has "caught it" in earnest, is rubbing his hands on a wet slate.
The whole is truly feminine and graceful.
Howbiggings uns surpassed himself with his Dissecting Rom, a work
of marvellous fidelity. The shuddering young student, to whom the
house surgeon, with calm irony, presents the scalpel, is admirable, and
so is the figure of the porter who is bringing in the beer. I must not
forget to mention Bandy Jockle's little picture, The Mudlark, a sweet
study, and the dead cat might have been painted by Laxdseeb or
Ansdell, if either had done it. 1 was greatly pleased with James
Snaggerton's Pickpocket at Bay, the thief is painted with mncli
honesty, and the face of t he woman clawing at t he remorseless clergy-
man who has lost his watch appeals to all the best sympathies of
her nature. Bargle's Jjcap Year is a happy conceit—a girl who has
been crossed in love, as is shown by a torn Valenl ine, leaps from Water-
loo Bridge, but is iu no danger, as her lover, who has only tried a. little
experiment to test her affection, is in a boat under the arch, with a
Humane Society's hook, and a marriage licence lies on the gnaw*
Lastly I must mention Dewlap's refined, scholarly and gracious work,
Napping Pepper. A mischievous footman, with a white sheet, has
appeared as a Pepper Ghost to the cook, who in her ecstasy of terror
empties the cayenne bottle over him, and you can literally hear him
roaring in torture—the tone is exquisitely delicate and the feeling i"ost
tender. I will speak of other works iu my next.

MRS. GAMP AND MRS. HARRIS ON THE SITUATION.
Yes—mum—take a drop of comfort, wich we needs it, missis 'Arris—
I ain't one, and you ain t one, my dear, as fetches, nor yet carries,
But down in the servants 'all, they knows how things is a progressiu'—
Wich I understand our Guvnor's goin' to give them Whigs a dressin'.
Now, I've always made it a dootjr, as true as my name's Sairey,
What the fam'ly does in the droring-room to uphold it in the airey,
And nobody can say of me, if the fam'ly thought fit to fight.
But Sairey Gamp stood by 'em, and proved as they was right.
But I do 'ate stuck-up people, my dear, and of all the stuck-up sets,
Them Palmingston people's the wust I know, and the older the wusser
they gets;
I've knowed the old man this many a year, he used oftens to come my
way,
And werry civil-spoken he were, and always somethink to say.
And there 'as been times, when I was young and fresh-lookin'—but,
lawk-a-day
What's the use of talkin' like that, Betsy—of days that's passed away?
But Palmingston ain't the man he was, he's a gittin' in years, you see,
And it ain't all parties as keeps their looks, nor their wits, like you
and me!
I 'ope I know what's ladylike, and I scorns low language and spites,
But this 'ere Palmingston's a keepin' our fam'ly out of their rights,
Which it's our dooty to wish 'em well, and say so, and 'elp 'em, that's
clear,
And when they comes into their own, let's 'ope they '11 think of old
sarvints, my dear.
If there's one thing I 'ate, dear, it's meddlin' in another party's quarrel,
Wich them Palmingstons will 'ave a finger in every pie, to a moral:
Not that they 're the English sperrit to go in lie men that means
fight in'
But, 'drat their bragian imperence, they all'ays quarrels in writin'!
You mark my words, whoever trusts them '11 find hisself left in the
lurch:
Wich they 're Papishcs, if not infidels, leastways they 'ates the Church!
So fill your glass up, Betsy, it's more comfortin' when it's' 'ot,
And 'ere's 'drat and down with them Palmingstons, for a shabby,
scaly lot!
MEASURES, NOT MEN.
Subjoined is part of an advertisement appearing in a contemporary:
"Gentlemen who don't ruw Tailors' Bills will find the Economy of Cash
Payments by giving their orders to B. Benjamin, Merchant Tailor."
Mb. Benjamin also advertises a saving of twenty per cent., to be
effected by resorting to his establishment instead of employing other
tailors. We much prefer this Benjamin's terms to those of a certain
other Benjamin, one of the principals in the House of Derby & Co.
They haven't the assurance to promise us economy of cash payments if
we give our orders to them, because they well know that we should find
just the reverse, and that, instead of saving twenty per cent, in any
way, we should very soon experience an increased per-centage of the
Income-Tax.
THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY.
The Prince Imperial has been giving a grand dinner to his young
companions in arms, "Les Enfans de la Troupe," at the Tuileries.
Surely a more appropriate place for the banquet would have been the
"Hotel des Princes, so celebrated for its dinners. The above juvenile
company, who are so fond of playing at soldiers, must be the well-known
"Enfans de la Patrie" that the Marseillaise is so fond of appealing to
in the cheering tones of " Allons.'" We notice that the young Napoleon
wore on that festive occasion his stripe for the first time as a Serjeant.
He is now what you may call the French Serjeant Parry—in other
words, he is unquestionably at present the first Serjeant de Paris, and
we beg accordingly, with all the honours, to salute him as such.

TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
"Yes," you will say, whoever you may be, "the First Method of
Street Talk is decidedly faulty; but bow shall it be mended?" Thus :—
In order that you may never be taken by surprise, and your conversa-
tional powers utterly paralysed by the sudden apparition of an acquaint-
ance, be prepared with certain sentences, which shall be equally well
adapted for all occasions, ordinary or extraordinary. With, such
assistance be it mine presently to prov ide you.
I purpose giving you certain idiomatic phrases; these can be easily
acquired, and glibly rattled off at a second's notice. But there will
occur to every thoughtful and provident mind, a case of two persons
meeting, where, though one may be ready with the pre-arranged words,
as just now mentioned, the other, either from not having duly studied
his Punch, or from a naturally defective memory, shall be unfurmshed
with a fit and proper reply. This difficulty shall likewise be

AND DIALOGUES FOB

I see that you arc pret ty well, perhaps very well—it is immaterial
?; and so am I—that is immaterial to you. At least, I won't enter
Arranged chiefly on the old Ecclesiastical Plan of Feriicle and
TUB JOVIAL GBEETIKQ.
V. Why, Jones! (Raise the eyebrows, smile, bring the right hand
down with a slap on that of your friend; this is intended to convey the
notion of heartiness.)
R. Ah,. Smitu! {Imitate the above pantomime, and grasp Smith's
hand manfully.)
V. Hallo, old boy! {Applicable to a person of any age, from sixteen
years old upwards.)
R. Well, old fellow! (A modification of the foregoing.)
This may be termed the Prelude. Now then comes the Topic. In
all cases, be it understood, that meteorological and valetudinarian
questions be compounded ana dismissed as follows:—
V.
to me _
into particulars about myself; nor do I wish you to say anything con-
cerning yourself; time being far too precious to be wasted in details so
totally uninteresting to each of us.
R. You are right: and, as you have a pair of eyes and a constitution
of some sort, it will be superfluous, on my part, to inform you as to
what kind of a day it is.
Instead of commencing, "Did you read the account of the debate
last night?" or, " Seen the Times to-day? By Jove, how Palmebston
did," &c.
Politics will be thus discussed:—
V. If, my dear Jones, you have seen to-day's papers, I am unable to
add to your stock of knowledge; if not, I have got sometliing better to
do than give you a resume of the Times.
R. I have read, my dear Smith, the daily papers, and have arrived at
the conclusion, that a slip-shod discussion on important public affairs by
two private individuals in the street, can to no great extent advantage
the policy of the Nation.
In lieu of commencing social topics with the hackneyed observation,
that "Town's getting very full," or, "Not many people in Town now,"
according to the time of year, the conversation, unaffected by changes
of season, shall flow on invariably in this stream:—
V. You know, as well as I do, what's going on in Town, and whether
it is a gay or dull season ■ and if you do not, it doesn't mat ter to me.
R. I've not seen you about anywhere; but, of course, I'vc not looked
for you, nor have I missed you.
V. Particulars concerning the operas and theatres you have, probably,
as much chance as I have of ascertaining for yourself.
R. True; and your opinion upon such matters will not affect my
enjoyment; nor, as I am aware, will mine, yours.
V. I daresay we shall both be at the Derby, or Ascot, or Newmarket.
As we neither bet, it doesn't signify.
R. I've no doubt I shall go. Whether we meet there or not is
indifferent alike to me and to you.
V. I think that this conversation should now come to an end.
R. Decidedly so.
V. Let me, therefore, say, that wc are all quite well at home, or not
all well at home, whichever you like.
It Oh! I don't care; and so arc we, in any state you like.
V. Thus having satisfied conventionality without an effort, let us
shake hands and say good bye.
R. Good bye.
You may dispense with any Hearty Humbug about, "Look us up,
old fellow," "Mind you drop in and see us at any time," and so forth;
but let the originally jovial character of the salutation be kept up iu the
valediction, thus:—
V. "I am very glad that we have met," as it will obviate my calling
upon you, and wc need not stop one another in the street for a long
I time to come.
R. "I am really delighted to have seen you," and do not care if I
never set eyes upon you again.
V. Good bye, old boy (kindly).
S. Good bye, old fellow (pailmusingly).
These V.'s and R.'s should be got by heart, or rather, by head and
mouth, the heart having but very little to do with it. Supposing that
you have mastered this dialogue, then, on meeting a friend, at once
proceed to throw out a feeler in the shape of the first Versiclc; should
he not return the proper Response, try him with the second; should he
fail in this also, I will explain to you in another Method how the
difficulty may be surmounted.

No Ciuesus as yet
Had contrived to get
Two guineas together to rub;
Jove spent no rap
At Hebe's tap,
Nor had Hercules joined his club.
No globules then
Up to Number Ten
Could be purchased of Mb. Epps;
No Tartar lx>ld,

Had gone up and down the.Steppes.
No gents were burk'd,
No garottcrs luik'd
Round a corner one's weazand to twist;
No Heenan's pate
Had felt the weight
Of a King's triumphant fist.
No plated ships
Had left their slips
With an enemy's force to cope;
No world wide fame
Spread Windsor's name
For either its kings or soap.
No Lesseits' canal
Raised a sad cabal
On account of its unpaid Fellahs;
The weather I vow
Was finer than now,
Por no people borrowed umbrellas.
An useless task
'Twas then to ask
For a rifle of Manton or Puhiuy;
No Habhage as yet
Was made to fret
By the notes of a hurdy-gurdy.
Where herds now browse
Were then no cows
Or horsrs, that now and then kick us;
None dug up bones,
Or labell'd stones,
Or had heard of a Hortus Siccus.
No cabs were known;
No widow'd crone
Gave balls with a stunning supper;
No beer was fined;
No trunks were lined
With the works of a Mabtin TirrER.

The heights of Portsdown being held
By Volunteers; my own desire
Did they who govern you fulfil,
As those that should succeed them will.
By glorious death your gallant youth
Ere now should have been decimated,
And glory's price to pay, forsooth,
At ten per cent, your incomes rated,
And likewise every other tax
Doubly redoubled on your backs.
War must befall you, soon or late;
Trust not a Power I need not name.
Believe in me; believe in Fate;
No matter which—they 're both the same.
Cashier your Palmebston, you fool!
Let Debby and Disraeli rule.
A TRAP TO CATCH A PICKPOCKET.
An interesting invention'which cannot be too soon introduced into
this country, is announced, with a delightful account of its mode of
action, by tne Lombardia of Milan, which says:—
"A young man with his arm caught In an Iron trap, has just been led through
the streets of this city to prison. A person named Varisco had Invented a gin to
catch pickpockets, which may easily be placed in a coat-pocket, and is so constructed
as to hold the hand of the thief as if in a vice. H. Varisco being in a locality which
those light-fingered gentry are thought to frequent, and remarking near him an
individual of a rather suspicious exterior, took from one of his pockets a handsome
silver snuff-box, at the same time assuming a simple air: then leisurely taking a
pinch from it, he placed it into a pocket provided with the trap. Presently the
stranger approached M Varisco, slipped his hand into the pocket, seined hold of
the bait, and in another second snowed by his cries that he was securely caught."
"And such an instrument I was to use," says Jones, " when I went
to the Opera, and the Derby, and the Zoological Gardens, and to hear
Spurgeon, and to Punch's Office at the hour of publication. Only,
worse luck, it had not been invented." Well; now it has, and will
shortly, no doubt, be on sale at all ironmongers. To be sure the para-
graph announcing its invention, headed The Pickpocket's Trap,"
appeared on the first instant, but then it was quoted by more than one
paper on the same day. Let us, then, hopefully believe that the trap to
catch a pickpocket is a fact. Might it not be called the Anti-Artful
Dodger f It really will be a very pretty toy for young fellows who are
hard up for fun to amuse themselves withal. Going anywhere in quest
of game of that sort which is called a lark, they will at least do well to
put one of these pickpocket-traps in each of their pockets. The capture
of a thief by means of it would be a capital joke in the first place, and
would soon become a common occurrence; the frequency of detection
would then discourage, and ultimately stop the pickpocket's pursuits.
The wearer of the trap, we of course presume, is furnished with a key
to it in order to unlock it when, daring a fit of absence, feeling in his
pocket, he gets caught in his own gin; but he might be in an awkward
fix if he forgot himself so far as to put both hands in his pockets, with a
trap in either. Self-preservation also demands that the jaws of the
pickpocket-trap should not be armed with sharp teeth, which would
sometimes accidentally bite the wearer's own fingers.
A GHOST-DOG.
At a late meeting of the Anthropological Society, according to a
report of its proceedings, papers were read by the Rev. F. W. Fabbar,
one of them on the alleged universal belief in a deity and a future state.
In the course of this paper the rev. lecturer told a good story:—
"The belief in the existence of some unknown power was not sufficient, Mr
Farrar observed, to prove belief in a Supreme Being, for even animals have a
consciousness of the existence of some superior unseen power; and he mentioned
the case of a dog that refused to enter a wood that was avoided by the inhabitants
in the neighbourhood, because it was reputed to be haunted."
Here is a case for the Spiritual Magazine, if it is only authentic. The
name and address of the canine prodigy referred to in the foregoing
anecdote are desirable. This must be a dog of the same breed with the
one in Pickwick that pulled up at the caution-board in the plantation,
notifying that all dogs trespassing would be shot. In all ghost-stories
wherein a dog is concerned the dog always slinks under the table, or
behind the spectators, with his tail between his legs. Almost any dog
may be terrified with a suitable combination of long pole, sheet, and
turnip-lantern. But a dog's avoidance of a wood reputed to be haunted
is something more than mere fright at an object which the creature does
not understand. It argues spiritual perception if the spot was really
haunted, and, if not, at any rate comprehension of the talk amongst the
people in the neighbourhood. So, then, this dog must have been one
if not supernaturally sagacious, at least uncommonly clever; must have
either hatl a good nose for ghosts, or a wonderful ear for conversation.

[April 16, 1864,
PUNCH. OR THE LONDON' CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
pril 4th, Monday. Lord Palmer-
ston is a very cruel man. You
may think that he isn't, but he is.
The Opposition had been spend-
ing their Easter holidays in get-
ting up speeches on the wicked-
ness of assassination, on the duty
of doing nothing that could of-
fend their beloved Sovereign the
Emperor op France (less Paris),
and on the necessity of turning
out a Government that included
a gentleman who knew another
gentleman who was accused by
the French police of knowing
something about a plot against
the Emperor. There was to have
been a tremendous storm. But
Mr. Stansfeld, the first item in
the above series, resolved to with-
draw from office. Lord Palmer-
stox, who had prevented his do-
ing so until the whole business
had been gone over, and the Op-
position had been defied, now felt
that Mr. Stansfeld had a right
to do as he pleased. That gen-
tleman resigned, and to-night,
having a free tongue, and speak-
ing as an independent Member,
he once more, and very fully, ex.
pounded the Mazzini business;
and though he cquld add no strength to the conviction held by Mr.
Punch and Society that Mr. Stansfeld had done nothing to be
ashamed of, he almost made the Opposition ashamed of themselves.
Indeed we may say quite • for as soon as they found themselves check-
mated, and all their hoarded thunder useless, they walked off, leaving
benches as empty as the threats of the usual occupants. But they
have driven a valuable public servant away from useful work, and that
of course is a comfort.
The Duke of Newcastle retires because he is ill. Mr. Cardwell
succeeds him, as Colonial Secretary, because we do not exactly know
why, and Lord Clarendon becomes Chancellor of the Duchy of Corn-
wall because he likes a g^ood cigar, and so does the Duke of Corn-
wall. If anybody can give a better reason, he may send it us or not,
just as he pleases, and we don't care which he does.
Tuesday. Lord Russell has been informing" the American Minister
that we will not allow enlistments of Queen's subjects as Federal
soldiers, and Mr. Adams says that any officer offending shall be dis-
missed. But the Irish idiots who'are kidnapped are tempted so largely
that they become accomplices in the crime against themselves, as they
find out when, instead of getting work and high pay, they are hurried
off to die in the mud of Virginia.
The Lisburn election (no, not Lisbon, Mr. Cox. What makes you
think that the capital of Portugal sends Members to the English Par-
liament ?) cannot be inquired into because one of the Committee is ill;
and all the wisdom of the Legislature is unequal to devising a scheme
for enabling the investigation to go on. Of course, to appoint a new
man, and to give him a day to read the past evidence and bring himself
up flush with his colleagues, would be impossible, unconstitutional,
inconceivable, unprecedented—and practical.
Alderman Salomons wants to rate property in the occupation of
Government, but the House, by 52 to 30, decided that he must be con-
tent with rating Government itself.
Wednesday. A bill for improving the Royal Court of Jersey—very
properly described by Mr. Hadfield as "a barbarons and absurd
Court"—was read a Second Time, with Sir G. Grey's approval, but he
wishes to hear what "the States of Jersey" have to say about it.
Governments are much too tender over the antiquated prejudices and
jobbing interests of these ridiculous islanders, and one would think we
were afraid of their revolting, whereas the Yacht Club could keep all
the islands in the most perfect order without troubling Iler Majesty's
ships.
Thursday. The Budget Night, and Mr. Gladstone in full force.
Punch had thought of giving the right honourable Chancellor's
address at full length, as it occupies only ten columns of the morning
papers, but on the whole he prefers to state its contents with brevity.
Two large cats and a respectable kitten were let out of the Bag.
Cat No. 1 was a great reduction of the Sugar duties. The sum
which Mr. Gladstone takes oil' will amount to One Million, three
hundred and thirty thousand golden sovereigns in a year, Materfamilias,
and it will be amusing to you to hear the new set of fictions by which
your grocer will prove to you that you ought to have no benefit from
the reduction.
Cat No. 2 was the taking off Oue Penny from the Income-Tax, -which
is now to be Sixpence. This diminution was of course due to the
frightful menaces which Mr. Punch had uttered upon all occasions when
the iuiquitously levied tax came under his indignant pen. M it. Glad-
stone looks to another reduction next year, and Mr. Punch particularly
advises him to keep his earnest eyes in that direction.
Kitten was a reduction of the shameful duty on Fire Insurances.
Half of the three shillings now levied is to be taken off insurances on
Stock in Trade only. We hope to see this kitten grow up into a large
cat by next April, as people ought not to be fined for trying to save
themselves from being ruined by fires.
The great speech was not an adorned one, but was singularly im-
pressive, and where an elevated tone could be adopted, you may be sure
Mb. Gladstone improved the occasion. His noble picture of the com-
mercial greatness of England combined the accuracy of a photograph
with the colouring of a Turner. People who turn away from the
figures of arithmetic, as mock-modest people turn away from figures of
classic soulpture, may nevertheless like a few point* from the speech.
not increase, as is'
bat
We have had a year of average pros;
Our Miscellaneous Estimates do i.
rather decrease in amount.
Our Surplus is Two Millions, and £352,000.
Our National Debt has decreased to Seven Hundred and Ninety-One
Millions, on which we pay about Twenty-Six Millions a year, anil rather
like the operation.
England is the ohampion of Peace and Justice throughout the world,
and is in fact the Friend of Humanity.
Remembering that, it is instructive to note that Mr. Gladstone is
happy to say that though the taste for ardcut spirits is decreasing here,
a large export trade in spirits is growing up.
The British manufacturer, "naving been pat through his usual
paroxysms of alarm" about the baccy trade, now makes more baccy
than ever.
The nominal oorn duty—one bob per quarter (of corn) is to be three-
pence per cwt, which is not a Welsh word, as it looks, but means a
hundredweig-ht.
The consumption of French wine has increased 300 per cent.
The duty on tea-sellers' licences is reduced. So is that on Hawkers'
Horses, which the Duke of St. Albas's, hereditary Grand Falconer,
may like to know if he rides.
Mr. Darby Griffiths was actually mentioned, with applause, by
the Great Gladstone, for a sensible little proposal about proxy duties,
and will henceforth be immortal, like a fly in amber.
"Jaggery " is the lowest form of sugar made in the East Indies.
"Dutch Numbers" is the universal language for construing sugar
duties.
The Malt Tax is not to be taken off, and if you were to take off half,
it would have to come on again, "and you may tell your children so."
The fine barley grower has No Grievance.
We are bound, in spite of our prosperity, to study Economy.
Nine hundred and fifty-four people out of every thousand are self-
supporting.
But there exists great distress. We have 810,000 paupers.
Our Surplus, after all the proposedjreductions, will be Two Hundred
and Thirty-Eight Thousand Pounds.
Having thus set up diners-out with material which will enable them
to chatter in the most profound manner, Mr. Punch begs to congratu-
late 'Mr. Gladstone on a magnificent intellectual effort, the value of
which will not be decreased by the allegation made by Mesdames Gamp
and Harris to the effect that the Ministers come in disguise to consult
Mr. Punch, and to receive his prompting. The loud cheers of the
House of Commons as the great orator sat down were nobly earned,
and did honour to him and to those whom he had instructed ana
delighted.
When the House found its tongue, the utterances were not very
remarkable. As in a theatre the eyes of men, When any well-graced
actor leaves the stage. Are idly bent on him who enters next, Thinking
his prattle to be tedious, Is a quotation which frequently occurs to
Mr. Punch. He will only note that Mr. Crawford thought he could
improve the sugar scheme; that Mr. Hubbard thought that more ought
to be done for the fire-insurers; that Mb. Whiteside thought some-
thing ought to be done about Irish spirits: that Mr. Morrell thought
the Malt duty ought to come off, and saia he should try to get it off:
that Mr. Bentinck thought the duty ought to be re-imposed on paper;
that Mr. Malins (who usually objects to everytliing) was almost half-
satisfied with the Budget; and that Mr. Bass "thought beer."
Vigorous to the last, Mr. Gladstone took all their points in his target,
and progress was reported.
Friday. Lord Palmerston assured the House that the interests of
the people of Schlcswig-Holstein would be very well taken care of at
the Conference. Later, Mb. Dillwyn, indignant at the bombardment
of Sonderborg, desired that our fleet should be at once sent to help the

Danes. Mr. Osborne protested against Me. Dillwyn's lashing him-
self into a rage with his own tail, like a lion, and then was smart upon
the Cabinet, the Conference, and the Correspondence. 6
"Smart was hla greeting, smarter Pah's reply;
Tia well, but persiflage is all my eye."
The Premier took the opportunity of speaking severely of the
Germans, and was reproved by Mr. Peacocke for being " aggravating,"
Peacocke having been reading nursery.poetry, and thinking—
"If I suffer such insolent airs to prevail,
Hay Juno pluck out all the eyes in my tail."
The other incident of the night was a singular speech by Lord
Edward Howard, the leader of the English Catholics, who. in reply
to a fierce attack by Mr. Newdegate upon the Oratorians at Brompton,
made some allusions to lost members of his own family, and their
position in another world. It was impossible not to be touched with
the simple devotional utterances of Lord Edward, but they were
certainly "extra-Parliamentary." Mr. Newdegate's onslaught upon
the Oratorians, and monastic institutions generally, seemed to have been
prompted by Mr. Alfred Smee, the medical man, who believes that
a relative of his was victimised by priests, but who has certainly been
less than considerate in the way in which he has dragged the names of
ladies into the controversy. On division, Mr. Newdegate's motion
for a Committee of Inquiry found 80 supporters and 113 opponents,
so the orator contra the Oratorians must put on more steam another
time. Let him study the Newdegate prize poem for 1828, "Machine
ti Vaporis impulse," and then Tie may attain the glory similarly
commemorated in 1844, " Triumpki Pontpa apud Romanos."

The visitor to the Royal Academy will have the Assistant-Judge
at the Middlesex Sessions, Mr. Bodkin, brought up before him for
his (the visitor's) judgment. A jury of his enlightened fellow-country-
men will pronounce upon his merits. This likeness (you'll say "There
he is!" directly you set eyes on it), which you will see, of course, by
day, is, as you will also see, by Knight. That's tip number one.
Will this be in the first place among the portraits? Send us thirteen
stamps, and you shall hear.
Mr. Sant's "Dick Whiilington listening to what tie London Belli
said;" not the first instance, by the way, of a lad being turned from his
straight course by the Belles—(is this the moral ?), whether of London
or any other place. Fortunate will that gentleman be who, for a prize,
draws what Mr. Sant paints. Then, there's a Boy in blue from the
same stable—we mean studio. "The hoy in yellow," you will remember,
"wins the day." As to what place the blue boy (no relation to Gains-
borough's, which, as it happens, wasn't blue at all) will occupy, why,
send us fourteen stamps, and you '11 hear something to your advantage.
The youngster bears the noble name of Raglan, of whom all boys, blue
coat or red coat, may be justly proud.
Tip the third. Send us twenty-four stamps—" two-bobs' worth" in
slang coinage—and we will attempt to give you an idea of one Roberts'
work. Mr. Roberts, R.A, hitherto renowned for his cool interiors,
has at length bestowed some attention upon his exterior. A view—and
such a view!—of Rome! Urbs Roma.' Food for the eyes—a very
feast of urbs! Ahem! for the third and last time.

WICKED WORK AT DYBBOL.
(To the Emperor op Austria and the King of Prussia.)
Sweet Sovereigns,
Whether or no you dare let your subjects see the Times
newspaper, of course you take good care to read it regularly yourselves.
Doubtless, you were amused by the account of your cut-throats' and
incendiaries' doings at Dybbol, given by the special correspondents of
that journal at the Danish head-quarters, and those of your rascals
respectively.
Particularly delightful to your Royal and Imperial minds must have
been the subjoined passages from the pen of the former of the writers
above mentioned. To see the attack of your Majesties' brigands upon
Dybbol's brave defenders, he had got upon a hill called the Castle
Battery, out of harm's way, as you are, only he made himself neces-
sarily safe, in order to do his duty in describing the horrors from which
you, the authors of them, keep your distance. And there, he tells us,
lie had a magnificent view of the Wemmingbund, and of the Dybbol
heights, now flashing fire all along the crest, like a marshy ground in a
southern climate all alive with swarms of fire-flies," Prussian locusts
and scorpions rather.
"It was not more," he says, ''than half-past three;" when you two,
doubtless, were snoring in your comfortable beds. It was one of the
loveliest mornings I ever Baw here. The air was perfectly still, and the ,
larks were soaring up into heaven with their sweet morning hymn. \
The moon was far down in the western horizon, with a morning planet
in her suite which I think must have been Mercury." Not Mars, your
Majesties; and Mercury, you know, was the god of thieves. Is not
the star of that order due to old Von Whangel and his colleague
Gablenz ?" The stars." continues the eye-witness of your wicked work,
"were all out. Behind us was the faintest possible streak of earliest
dawn." This was earth and sky as Heaven made them; now see what
the other power, and its human agents, made of them:—
"The cannonade from the Danish bastion was terrific, the rattle of the shells and
their bursting incessant; and, as an accompaniment to the roaring music, the
musketry fire swelled up in the air active and lively. Above the somewhat muffled
grumbling of the common musket, we could easily discern the sharp ringing ping f
ping ! * of the Prussian zindTUulelgewdir. The air was all alive with flashes of fire,
as 1 said, and the smoko lingered pale and ghastly over the vast landscape ; the
smoke in a thousand puffs from large and small fire-arms, the smoke also from a vast
conflagration arising from the doomed houses of the unfortunate Dybbol village"
Wc Britons, your Majesties, can fancy it Clapham, and bless you as
much as if we did.
The narrator adds, for the further satisfaction of your Majesties :—
"It was a scene worth walking many hundred milos to soe—a scene worth
waiting for many a long day."
Yes; but to my mind, it would have been better worth waiting for
many a long day if the primary pyrotechnists of this grand display of
fireworks had been roasting in their own conflagration. But the less
said about a "conflagration" which has been " waited for many a long
day," the better, perhaps, in the presence of monarchs who, if they
believe, should tremble.
Let me, your Majesties, quote you another pretty bit, to divert
your most gracious Majesties:—
"On my way to the Dybbol Windmill both times I had to pass several carts con-
veying the Danish wounded. Borne came on stretchers, borne on the shoulders of
stout ambulance men. They were, for the most part, bleeding at the head, having
been struck behind the parapots of the bastions. Not a few were lifeless, and 1 saw
a mangled mass of raw flesh and blood, which, had I not been told, I could hardly
believe to have been a man."
It is a pity that there was not on the spot a skilful artist to paint a
picture, from death, of this "mangled mass of raw flesh and blood,"
the image of your Majesties' Maker, marred by your Majesties' slaves.
Such a work of Art, German Art, would be a prize for which it would
be by no means derogatory to the dignity of your Majesties to compete
by lot. It could not be given to the worthier of you, for of you two
worthies there is no possibility of determining which is the worthier of
such a testimonial. Nobody can say that one of you is more deeply
stained than the other by the dastardly bloodguiltiness of a tyrant who
carries sword and fire into his neighbour's territory in order to avert
from his own head the consequences of his misgoverned subjects' dis-
affection. Your Majesties cannot conceive the disgust and detestation
with which your outrage on Denmark is regarded by
John Bull.
* May it please your Majesties, Mrs. Grondt says, "I 'd ping! ping! you, if I
had my wilL" I wouldn't That is not how we deal with those whose hands are
of your Majesties' colour. Wo do not ping I ping I them.

Potent performer! Blondin of debate!
Who, on thy high rope of yarns oratorical,
Treadest a path to turn a common pate,
With firm-set foot, and clear brain categorical,
Keeping thy balance, to mankind's amaze,
And ever and anon cracking a joke,
As eggs to make his omelette BLOMDrN broke,
Dropping on heads upturned in breathless gaze
The empty shells, as thou the well-turned phrase.
But where he bore, across his dangerous track
One desperate party, blinded, in a sack,
Thou, all across thy figures' long-stretched line,
A whole attentive Commons House dost bear—■
There being, we know, at least two parties there—
As blind, if not as brave, so I opine.
As he whom Blondin pick-a-back'a mid-air!
Blondin could juggle but with knives and balls,
Thou tossest, calmly, millions to and fro,
Bidd'st exports, imports, rev'nue-rises, falls,
In mazy ring round thy calm forehead flow,
While dazzled, doubting, awed, astonished, all
Listen and look, and hold their breath, and say
"Can this go on? This sum will surely fall,
That total drop." But no—he holds lus way,
His balance kept secure, through all that figure-play!
As Blondin knew to thrill the crowd intent, .
Skilful on nerves or cord his art to ply,
Now tottering, now stumbling as he went.
Till hearts ceased beating, as his fall seemed nigh;
So, now and then, wilt thou a pause essay,
A seeming hesitance, a doubtful air,
And Cecil pricks his ears, and Dizzy's clay
Warms with slow fife, and his eye 'gins to glare,
But soon the feint is played, and high in air
The proud head shows serene, the firm step holds its war.
Mysterious mind—whose power no task encumbers!
To grasp our many-millioned debt is thine,
Or with melado, jaggery and Dutch numbers,
And other nice distinctions saccharine,
To play, like one bred in the grocery line!
What task above, what task below thy power? ,
I own a brother, and with bended hunch
Vow, as I hail thee joint Lord of the hour,
"I would be Gladstone, if I were not Punch."

persons of strong imagination may be able to form an idea of'™
tipsiness is like. To aid them in so desirable a discovery, Mr."
would say that he never in his life had any doubt whether he was sow

A COOK'S ORACLE.
Pimcn, or rather my
dear Punch! what can
be the meaning of this?
You know, when that
little event came off
which made me the hap-
piest girl—I mean, of
course, Charley the
happiest man—you ad-
vised, in that dear kind
way! me always to look
after the servants, and
have good dinners. Well.
1 tool your advice, ana
have tried my very best.
The cook's a stupid old
woman, but I have done
marvels for her, and we
have charming little din-
ners in consequence.
The only things I did
not like iwere the legs
of mutton; they looked
so big. So yesterday,
when I went down-
stairs, I told the cook
that I wouldn't have
any more of those legs
in future, but would
have fore ones instead.
I can't think what came over the stupid old thing when 1 said this. I am sure, only
there's nothing to laugh at. She nearly did; but I never let them answer me,
you know; so she only curtsied, and said "Yes, M'uin;" and I came away;
because you know, my dear darling old Punch (you don't mind my calling you old,
do you ?), I was just a little frightened, I don't know what at, though; perhaps of
losing my temper. I told Charley when he came in; and, would you believe it?

he burst out laughing too, and said, calling me such hard
names, "Why, you stupid little duckey, a mutton ain't got
fore-legs!"
Now, my dear, dear old (you said you didn't mind my
calling^ you old), wise, clever Punch, do tell me what it
all means; because Charley won't, and I don't like to ask
the cook after giving her an order.
Excuse haste. And believe me, ]my dear, dear, kind,
good Punch, -u , .

THEATRES FOR LONDONERS.
The new managerial system of running the same pieces
for several years (a system utterly detrimental to dramatic
literature and to theatrical art) has produced the natural
effect. There is no wrong without a remedy. The Lovers
of the Drama (a distinct class from the people who will go
anywhere, provided a door is opened) have made represen-
tations to the country managers and to the "railway authori-
ties, and the result is that special Theatrical trains will start
from London, so as to enable the Playgoer to go to the
Play in towns where the performances are occasionally
changed. The managers at Bath, Bristol, Dover, Brighton,
Margate, and many places within easy reach have come
into the scheme: and as the trains will be very fast, and
the prices very low, Londoners will at last be enabled to
see a play now and then. The arrival of the trains will
he telegraphed to^the theatres, and the overture will begin
the moment the visitors are seated. The return transit
will be equally well arranged, and people will be at supper
in town earlier than they could be if they sat out a London
bill. The remedy was absolutely necessary, if the educated
classes were not to be allowed to lose all their taste for the
theatre, and the actors to lose all their chance of study and
improvement.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
Before coming to other methods of Street Duologues, I will de-
vote a few lines to the combination of three or more parties in the
street.
Let it be supposed that you, Mb. A, Mr, Anybody, accidentally fall
in with B., Mi. Boobitty, and C, Mb. Coobitty.
At a distance of twelve yards you catch sight of one another. "Hullo,"
says A. to himself, "here's Boobitty and Coobitty." Straightway he
feels that in the approaching engagement he will be overpowered, by
numbers. He looks to the right, he looks to the left, with naif a mind
to dare the perils of a crowded road, rather than encounter the united
forces of Boobitty and Coobitty. "They've seen me," he reasons
with himself, and very cowardice impels him onward towards his fate.
Irresolutely smiling, in painful consciousness of his weakness, and, with
his head so well in nana (if 1 may be allowed) as to be ready to return
the slightest acknowledgment on their part.
While A. is thus bracing himself up, B. says to C, interrogatively,
not being quite sure as to the extent of the Litter's intimacy with A.,
"Why that's A., isn't it?"
"Yes," returns B., guarding against any display][of emotion, which
might possibly be offensive to C. "So it is."
From the moment that they are aware of your proximity, a sudden
blight falls upon their conversation. It is sustained, if at all, with diffi-
culty. A few steps and A. meets B. and C. face to face.
Now comes a puzzler; with which of the two is A. first to shake
hands? He avoids the difficulty by offering this manual greeting to
neither. This negative commencement produces an air of constraint,
and all three are obviously embarrassed. A. tries to notice impartially
both B. and C. at a glance; and is uncomfortably impressed with a sense
of utter failure in the attainment of his object. In his opening sentence
he makes a similar attempt, and is equally unsuccessful.
A. (lookingfrom B. to C.) Well, you two? (Jocosely.) Where are you
going to? Eh f
This is a false step, bordering, in fact, upon an impertinence; as such
it is resented by B.
B. (in an offhand manner). Oh, nowhere.
This, of course, is absurd; and so Boobitty feels, for he immediately
adds, at least nowhere particular," which is as much as to say,
"Wherever it is we don't want your company, my hearty."
During this exchange, Coobitty, whose right arm is supported by
Boobitty's left, becomes deeply interested in the passers-by, equestrian
currustrian or pedestrian, and apparently pays no sort of attention to
the duologue.
A. (conscious qf having been snubbed). Oh!—Ah—urn—well—er.
(Then suddenly inspired). You 're both of you looking very well.
This, you see, is but a multiplication of the old conventionalism.
C. (unwillingly lugged into the conversation). Yes—I'm—a—(Believes
himself from further embarrassment by pretending a curiosity about a
dashing young lady on horseback.) Who s that, do you know P
This is addressed to B., who "ought to know," he says, "but
doesn't." A. can't even lay claim to acquaintance with the features
of the fair creature/and owns that "he hasn't got the smallest idea."
B. (to whose mind, after looking at A. for a few seconds, an idea presents
itself). You 're in Town now?
A. (dubiously, as if he wasn't). Ye-es. (Wishing to interest B.) I
suppose you are, too P Eh!
B. (decisively, as if Town couldn't gel on witliout him). Oh yes/yes.
For some time.
Up to this point the dialogue has not been so preternaturally spark-
ling as to preclude the necessity of introducing some enlivening topic.
A., oppressed by the fact that he is the third party, the one de trop,
makes a last effort to be brilliant .before [pursuing his onward course.
He remembers a common friend, and with an air of great anxiety, asks,
"Do either of you—" Note how cunningly he tackles them both, "Do
either of you remember—er—(Suddenly forgets all about it)—er—dear
me, what is the fellow's name t You kuow, he used to—um—Lor' !—
You'd know the name if I mentioned it, directly."
C. looks a( B. inquiringly, and B. (without the most remote notion qf
whom either A. or himself is talking). Do you mean E.?
A. (who doesn't know what he means). No, not E. It began with
Here occurs an incident requiring, on the part of A., the utmost
coolness, polite tact and presence of mind. For, while he is yet speaking,
a couple of gentlemen, one of whom is a friend of his, saunter past.
If A. turns to speak to him, it must appear as if he wished to cut B.
and C. If he only nods to F, en passant, F. may possibly feel himself
slighted. If he takes no notice ot the ncwkarrival, it will be for F. to
conclude that B. intends a deliberate insult; and this problem, specially
to a nervous man. becomes very difficult of solution. The whole case is,
I own, of a complex nature, aud it may be, exceptional. Yet must one
be prepared. In order, therefore, properly to grasp this stupendous
subject, and cut the knot sharply but delicately, I will commend the
position to my readers' careful study, begging them to send me their
ideas as to how they personally should act; and it shall be my task to
point out to them, should not their own ingenuity or experience render
my services unnecessary, the only proper method of gracefully extri-
cating yourself from this perlexing predicament; giving you, to speak,
as heretofore, alphabetically, and in some sort, algebraically, the process
whereby A. is to be eliminated.

REPORT OF A MEETING OF THE AMATEUR
CELIBACY SOCIETY, JUNIOR BRANCH.
{Kindly supplied by the Secretary.)
The minutes of the last meeting having been read and confirmed,
the Vice-President, in presenting his Report for his term of office,
congratulated honourable Members upon the flourishing state of the
Society. During the past six months the Society haa been instru-
mental in spreading dissension and discord in no less than five
parishes. (Cheering!) One parish in particular, where the clergyman
used to preach in a gown and read the service, the members of
the congregation all joining in the responses from their respective
Eews (groans), while the choir, led by a blacksmith, he presumed a
armonious blacksmith (great laughter) on the violin, with flute ac-
companiment, sang the ditties of Tate and Brady, had, under the
auspices of the Society, been so reformed, that the clergyman now
invariably intoned the service (a small choir of boys in surplices ably
doing the responses to Tallis in D), preached in an alb, thought of
procuring "beautiful vestments" (hear, hear), and had succeeded in
replacing Tate and Brady by plain-song hymns sung by an efficient
and highly-trained motett choir, open seats having, of course, been
substituted for pews. (Prolonged cheering.) There was one little draw-
back he had omitted to mention, which was, that the congregation had
all left the church and gone over to the dissenting chapel, which had
been lately enlarged. Honourable Members would, however, join with
him in rejoicing, that, by the efforts of the Society, the service in this
parish was now performed in so correct a manner as to satisfy the most
rigid and most zealous Anglican. (Thunders of applause.)
In conclusion, he begged to read to them the following extract from
a letter received from a member of this Society, who now held a curacy
in a small country parish:—
"We are getting on pretty well, but the people are very slow in taking up new
ideas. They object to the alms-begs I have introduced, and much prefer the old
metal-plates. My rector is nearly imbecile, so I have it all my own way, and wore
a small red cross sewn inside the neck-band of my surplice last Sunday. {Gnat
cheering, and a voice "plucky fellow! ") All the young ladies at a neighbouring
boarding-school are busily employed working me cushions and altar-cloths of
various colours from my own designs, and evince a laudable anxiety in the good
cause. The congregation, I am sorry to say, dalls off; but. by a judicious distribu-
tion of the dole, 1 have secured the regular attendanco at matins of five old men
and as many aged women. {Cheers.) They are not quite up to bowing so often or so
low as I could wish. I have spoken to them on the subject, and they assure me
their backs are stiff with ' the rheumatics' {laughter): so I must try the effect of
increasing their allowance. I am practising gymnastics myself, and can already
perform the service with much greater bodily ease and mental satisfaction than
before. The Society will be glad to learn that 1 am gradually becoming bald on
the top of my head." (loud applause.)
It having been moved and carried unanimously " That this report be
adopted," Mr. Gilbert Alban proposed, and Mb, Theodosius Chad
seconded, "That Messrs. Softsawder and Sons be commissioned to
supply the Members of the Society with vestments for their approaching
commemoration." To prove their fitness for the task, he (Mr. Gilbert
Alban) would read to the meeting the following advertisements which
he had received from them in answer to some inquiries he had made:—
REPOSITORY OF ECCLESIASTICAL ART.
Messrs. Softsawder and Sons. Man-Milliners. &c, beg respectfully
to inform Clergymen of the Anglican Church that theirs is the best
house in the trade for Ecclesiastical Vestments of all kinds, which they
provide in the newest fashion and of the most correct cut. In addition
to the usual robes indispensable to an Anglican Clergyman, Messrs. S.
and 8. beg to recommend to the notice of their clerical customers, the
following vestments, ecclesiastical and secular, tastefully designed by
an experienced mediaeval decorator, after the most correct models of
early Catholic times.
THE SURPLICE-ALB.
This chaste Vestment is unique of its kind, and combines with the
graceful folds of the surplice the elegant tournure of the alb. It has
been designed specially to meet the requirements of gentlemen who,
compelled by unavoidable circumstances to abstain from wearing the
"beautiful vestments" ordered by the Rubric, feel a conscientious
objection to that ordinary garb which, worn alike by Low Church and
High Church, causes no visible distinction between the Cathohc-minded
Anglican Priest, and the Protestant Minister of the Gospel. (Groans.)
Messrs. S. and S. have solved this truly distressing difficulty. The
Surplice-alb can be worn in the midst'ot a congregation sunk in the
deepest depths of ultra protestantism without detection, as by the unini-
ated it cannot be distinguished from an ordinary surplice. (Cheers.)
The high-minded Catholic divine can thus satisfy the scruples of his own
conscience without exciting any of that party Hostility which, though
truly gratifying to the amiable Anglican bigot, is but too often followed

by unmerited suspension at the hands of mistaken prelates, entailing not
unfrequently serious pecuniary loss. (Sensation and ffroans.)
SAINT BARTHOLOMEWS DALMATIC.
This gorgeous Vestment is well worth the attention of those icalous
Anglo-Catholics, who, regardless of consequences, are desirous of
spreading true Church principles by the alluring aid of brilliant colours
and glittering tinsel. Messrs. S. and S. assure their customers that
this striking garment has never been worn in an English Church without
causing furious dissension, and exciting passions of a most frightful kind.
(Hear, hear.)
S. B.'s Dalmatic can be had in all colours, but Messrs. S. and S.
would respectfully intimate that the sanguineous or blood-red is at the
present time the most fashionable as well as the most becoming colour.
N.B. This really first-rate article is strongly recommended by Brother
Ignatius and other well-known Churchmen.
OBSERVE!
Gorgeous Robes, equal to new, lent out on hire for extraordinary
oeremonials.
Hair Shirts (lined with the finest flannel) in all sizes (hear, hear).
A large supply of Sackcloth kept in stock.
Incense, scented a la Jockey Club, Frangipanni, Kiss-me-Quick, and
other fashionable perfumes, always in hand.
The reading of these advertisements was followed by loud and pro-
longed cheering.
The honourable gentleman then, in urging Members to vote for his
motion said,' that having read the advertisements, he thought it unne-
cessary to add any words of his own, and the President put the motion,
which after a short but animated discussion as to the respective merits of
violet and sky-blue silk for waistcoats, was oarried by a large majority.
This ending the business of the Society, the President dissolved the
WHO WILL SAY A WOED FOE THEM t
My dear Punch.
The other day you let me in your columns ask a question
which. I dare say, slightly shocked some of your highly moral readers,
but which perhaps you will allow me to repeat. Please let your printer
put it in a whisper of the very smallest type:—
"What becomes, then, of our columbines, our Curies and our sylphs, when they
are over fifty, or are weakened in their legs?"
To this I see that a dramatic paper has returned for answer—
"The General Theatrical Fund admits all pantonilmists, as well as performers
generally, to participate in tho privileges accorded to subscribers, and the Dramatic,
Equestrian, and Musical Sick Fund is available for all daucors In the hour of their
If this be really so, I am very glad to hear it: and the more people
subscribe to these two dramatic funds, the better chance poor ballet-
girls will have of being helped by them. But actors, pantomimists,
musicians, singers, dancers, acrobats, and horse-riders, not to mention
minor stage-folk, such as authors, prompters, carpenters, perruquiers,
and scene-painters—all these together form a vastly numerous assembly,
and among the many claims of a crowd so miscellaneous, the petition of
a ballet-girl may chance to be mislaid, or her share of .the funds raised
may be too small to bring much help to her. So let these two funds
flourish, and let a third be formed for the special use and succour of
sick fairies and old sylphs; and to relieve them from the thought that
they are wholly helped by charity, let them be asked themselves to
contribute to this fund, which then may be expanded out of charitable
pockets.
The man who will not help a woman in distress is unworthy of the
name of Smith or Brown or Jones, or any nobler appellation. For
women in distress, mind, are more helpless far than meu: and many a
lost name might have been saved by a few shillings. As ballet-girls get
old their little salaries decrease, and they are paid the least just when
through failing health, perhaps, the most is needful to them. It is with
hard work that they earn their living in a iplayhouse, and they barely
after all escape dying in a workhouse. Ever ready with then- small
means as they are to help each other, charity in their case most
assuredly begins at home: and as they minister so largely to the public
entertainment, the public surely may be asked in tune of need and
illness to minister to theirs.
So I would say to Brown or Jones or any other friend of mine ^ ho
has a pound or two to spare and an ounce or so of charity,1," Brown or
Jones, my boy, don't forget our actors! Neque tu choreas'sperne, puer,
which (excuse the scrap of Latin) means, And don't forget our ballet-
girls! Save them from the snares which beset their path in youth, by
giving them the hope of honest comfort in their age, and by your pre-
sent to their fund make their future happier than it might be without
you."

Dear Mb. Punch,—I write to tell you that I am quite willing not only to " aay
a word," but also to act in behalf of tho poor ballet-girls; and two ladies of my ac-
quaintance (whose names I send in confidence, and who both have had a long and
active experience in good works) are quite prepared to join with me in any plan you
can suggest for properly effecting the good end you have in view. My husband
need not fear any dark hints or black looks from roe, were he to act in such a
charity: but, I agree with you, some wives might object to see their tpo$ot brought
in contact with a bullet-girl, were she even over fifty and half dying from sheer
want.
Boing under a very great weekly obligation to you, my dear Afr. Punch, for the
pleasant laughs you give me, 1 shall be glad if I can help in any good work you sug-
gest, with all the lnfiuenoe, time and moneyrwhich is at my command.
Yours very sincerely, .
My dear Punch,—This wail for ballet-ladies is utterly a mistake. Most of them,
if not all, are working at various trades or professions with their relations, or by
themselvos, during the day ; and the theatre money is really extra what they earn
for their living. Independently of this fact, there aro two especial funds open to
the ballet-ladies, but we can never, get them to subscribe, small as the sul>ecription
is. * * * Your correspondent would do most good by subscribing to the Dramatic
Siok Fund. Your> eTer> A Mamaobr.
Deab PnKCH,—The Dramatic, Equestrian, and Musical Sick Fund especially pro-
vider for bullet-ladies. Threepence per week gives them ten shillings per week;
sixponce, fifteen; one penny extra, £10iat death. Added to which, they obtain
situations, and, in most oases, get the expenses of journeys paid by the managers to
whom they are sent. Once being members, they are relieved in distress, and
receive other advantages. There is also the Society of Dancers, which, I believe, is
open to them. Yours faithfully, As Hosobary Secretary.
Good Mr. Pouch,—One of the dramatic papers says your correspondent does not
seem to be aware that the Equestrian and Musical Sick Fund is "available for
dancers." Well, aa ballet-girls don't sing or even dance on horseback, usually, the
name of this same Fund would scarcely lead one to imagine that they were ever
helped by it. And are they? That's the question. I see by Rule IV. it Is stated
that " persons to be eligible must have been the last past three years in the exer-
cise of their profession, and deriving their entire livelihood from it" So if a fairy
sprains her ancle by coming up a trap in the third year of her subscription, or if a
'on the stage
ed. not one
[table fund.
ios, if it can be proved that, while subscribing to the fund, she has ever earned
a sixpence by her needle-work or other occupation off the stage, she will be held to
be ineligible to be aided by the Fund ; and as tho ladies of the ballet, I believe, are
scarcely paid sufficient salaries to live upon, it is but natural to fancy they must
seek elsewhere for work, which by Rule IV. must deprive them of assistance from
the Fund they arc invited to subscribe to. Yours truly, Mas. Candour.
Dear Punch,—Although a clergyman, I own I now and then enjoy a visit to a
theatre, when there is a good tragedy or comedy, aye, or even a good farce to see
and cry or laugh at. The Reverend Sydney Smith has given us his opinion that
nowhere is feeling to be more roused in favour of virtue than at a good play, that
nowhere is goodness to be learned with more enthusiasm ; and with this revered
and reverend opinion on my side, I care little what small carpers may aay about niy
fondness for theatrical excursions. So being a playgoer as well as a parson, I have
read with interest your letters about ballot-girls, in whose trials and temptations I
foel, as any Christian man must do, much sympathy and interest. But is It possible
to help them while living as they do 1 Low salaries are given on tho pretext that
the girls can look elsewhere for hire, and what their toes may fail to earn they may
bring in by their fingers. What this system tends to morally I need not pause to
ask: but I simply would inquire, what scheme can well amend it? Managers may
tell me all their '< ladies " are weU paid, and one way or another have abundant
means to live upon; and managers express a virtuous surprise that their ladies
don't subscribe to tho two provident societies established for their benefit. But is
it in the nature of a dancor to be provident? You don't find the brains of sixty with
the sinews of sixteen, and I should as soon expect a butterfly as a ballet-girl to be
provident
No, Sir. It is no use our trying to assist tho ballet-girls; the best thing we can
do for them would bo to abolish them. The ballet is a wretched mindless exhibi-
tion. It does no good to any, and it does much harm to many. Hundreds more
would go to tbo playhouse than do now, were the ballet swept away with all its im-
moralities. The managers would profit by tho vory stop they now might fear
would bring a loss to them: tho girfo would easily elsewhere get a less perilous em-
ployment: and a great scandal to Society would bo happily removed! So I say,
Down with the Ballet I and when pantomime time comes let the part of Columbine,
no matter how the children howl, be left out of the cast.
I send my card in confidence, and will call myself
I say, Punch, old boy, how about the ballet-girls? Havo you hit on a good plan
to help them when they want it? 1 'm ready with my money when you can tell
me where to send it. Hang it alL you know we mustn't let 'em go to the bad if
we can help it. Just concoive how dull and dismal the stage would look without
them.
I enclose my real name (don't let my wife see it, please,) and sign myself
Yours, Laicus.
*** Mr. Punch inserts these letters as a sample of the correspondence
which has reached him on this subject. It is seldom he intrudes a
grave theme in his pages, which are intended chiefly to enliven and
amuse. But the present is a subject which he believes must be of
interest to all who nave the interests of Womanity at heart. To them
he would appeal on behalf of the poor ballet-girls for sympathy and
succour, if sympathy and succour can by sufficient evidence be shown
to be deserved. For this cause he invites further letters on the sub-
ject, and as the ballet-girls themselves are presumably the best acquainted
with its details, perhaps they or their relations will supply him with
some facts to show then- own view of the case.

BALL-ROOM ETIQUEftE.
Arrival.—On getting out of your vehicle bow to the crowd, if any.
You never lose anything by politeness; if therefore you omit this first
ceremony, be not surprised should you find that your pickets have been
pocketed—we meanyour pockets have been picked.
On entering the Hall give a false name, something long that will last
from the bottom of the stairs to the top, and that'11 take five servants
to say it properly. Announce yourself, for instance, as Count
Pepperydewollachekotofolinsopiliskotzky. Get this well by heart
and give it out calmly and quickly; if you are undemonstrative in your
manner, they will set you down for his all Serene Highness.
Entering a Ball-room.—Be easy in your deportment. Flourish your
handkerchief: run your hand through your curled or uncurled hair;
bow to the North, South, East and West; pull your front lock of hair
to the Mistress of the House, jocosely winking at her the while; then,
with the affability of a true gentleman, turn to the Lady nearest you, and
at once enter into conversation. Adopt this formula:—" You look
precious hot? Been shaking the light fantastic, eh?" Here you cm
kick up your heels and cut a caper illustrative of the light fantastic
afore-mentioned. Continue thus:—" That's the- time of day! Pretty
time, isn't?" Hum whatever the band is playing. "Do they call your
hair red or yellow P I never knew the difference? Ain't yerwell?
You look seedy. Come down and have some lush: a brew of bitter.
Come on!" And without farther ceremony, take bold of her hand and
lead her down-stairs to the refreshments.
Asking a Lady to Dance.—\{ you've not been introduced, do not wait
for this mere empty form, but go up to the Lady and commence thus :-
"I say, Whatsyourname, will you favour me with this waltz? Don I
say yes, if you'd rather not? Lots of others where you come from?"
If she tells you she's engaged; say, " Oh Gammon! I know better than
that," and whisk her up off her seat before she can call upon Jack Robin-
son. Women will admire your dashing style.
The First Dance.—H the dancing has commenced before you read)
the Drawing-room, at once remonstrate with the Master of the House,
with whom you must now insist upon dancing a polka a la Spukgeos.
Sitting Out.—When1 you've nothing else to do, go out "on a balcony
and address the populace on any subject nearest your heart; say, you1
flannel waistcoat. Finish by throwing the flower-pots at the Mnian
Immediately upon this, return to the Ball-room and mix with the giddy
crowd.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
April 11M, Monday. In a certain Hall in the City of Palaces,—when
you direct a letter, it may be more convenient to the Post Office if you
write Oxford—there is hospitably brought out, in ancient and classically
inscribed silver, a precious liquid for the delectation of the visitor. It
is called Proof. No more need be said to those whose lips have touched
that goblet's rim. To the uninitiate nothing could be said, even by
the mighty master of language, Mr. Punch, D.C.L., that would convey
an idea of the splendour of that tipple. Had he that silver in hand, he
would empty it to the health of the Lord Chancellor, For to-night
that Lord brought in a Bill touching the Greek Professorship in the
City of Palaces. We all know how Mr. Jowett has been treated, how
the thinking, liberal, young, inquiring, grateful minds of Oxford wished
to treat him, and how they were defeated by an invasion of frantic
country parsons. But it is not to be borne that what Sydney Smith
called Wild Curates should compel a great scholar to teach Greek to the
University for £40 a-year. Lord Westbury has looked into his
patronage, and finds that he has certain canonries at his disposal, and
pleasantly calculates that on the doctrine of chances one of them should
be vacant in about a year. He proposes, as an act of Justice and of
Expediency, to attach a canonry to the Regius Professorship of Greek.
He hopes that the Lords will pass the Bill for this purpose, and that
Oxford will then endow the Proiessor with a sum equal to the Canonry
income, until the vacancy occurs. Punch hopes so too, for the question
is not one of creed, but of common honesty. And, Lord Westbury.
if such a thing should happen as that prejudice should be potent, ana
the Bill fail, you can give the first vacant Canonry to Professor
Jowett, without asking anybody's leave, and if you do, Mr. Punch will
make a special journey to his beloved Oxford for the express purpose of
emptying the aforesaid silver to your honour and glory and long life
and prosperity.
My Lords had a Danish debate. Lord Stratheden moved that
Government ought to have been more vigorous in supporting Den-
mark's claim for a mediation on treaty principles. The Duke op
Argyle defended the Cabinet. Earl Grey said that it had been
timid and vacillating. Earl Russell was fully conscious of the power
of England, but did not wish to hurry into war. Lord Derby called
him a Forcible Feeble, and charged him with a breach of pledge to
Denmark. We subordinated our political and military position to our
trading interests, and our bluster would have no effect on Europe.
Lord Wodehouse denied that there had been any pledge, and Lord
Granville hoped good results from the Conference. So does Lord
Punch, but as Lord Johnny was not altogether lucky at Vienna, it
cannot be offensive to Lord Russell if the other nobleman hints, while
Russell is being Dressed for the Fair, like Moses in the Vicar of
Wakefield, that we shall be a good deal more surprised than delighted,
if he brings us home a gross of green spectacles, or makes himself a
Spectacle of Greenness. The motion, having answered the purpose of
drawingthe fire of my noble sportsmen, was withdrawn.
Mr. Horsman demanded whether Ministers would ask Parliament's
approbation of any Conference bargain before ratifying it. Lord
Palmerston, with curious circumlocution, said that Ministers would
do all that was proper. Mr. Horsman was sure of that, but would
thev answer his question? Lobd Palmerston then explained that
such an undertaking would be wrong, because a plenipotentiary' was
supposed to have already plenty of power to act. The inextinguishable
Horsman then asked whether plenipotentiaries could exceed instruc-
tions? Lord Palmerston said that if they did, they went beyond then-
instructions, which proposition may, on the whole, be conceded.
It is with regret that Mr. Punch announces that Mr. Gladstone has
consented to refer his excellent Annuities Bill to a Select Committee; but
it is to be hoped that the measure( invaluable to the poor man, will come
out uninjured. Then we Supplied the Army till two in the morning.
This was the day, to be remembered in every household for the next
half-century, on which Garibaldi made his entry into London.
Tuesday. A Bill for flogging certain scoundrel offenders against
woman, was read a Second Time, and Lord Gkey took the opportunity
of rebuking, in strong language, some of our Judges for their habit of
inflicting ridiculously light sentences for brutal crimes. Mr. Punch

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
has had to speak of this, and may do so again in a still plainer way.
Offences against property are always visited in England with tremen-
dous severity; for instance, in the same newspaper which reports Lord
Grey, is the sentence on a barman and a glazier, who, for stealing five-
and-fourpence, have five years' penal serviiude, and a letter-carrier, for
taking half-a-sovereign and some stamps, has three, and the circum-
stances appear to justify the severity. But a hideous assault on a woman
in a condition needing all tenderness, is in the 3ame journal mentioned
as earning for the savage but six weeks in prison, and, next day, but t wo
months are g^iven for an outrage too revolting to be detailed litre. The
principle which prompted these latter decisions actuates several of Ni
Judges, who ought to know better, and if they will not listen to Lord
Grey, Mr. Punch may try the force of his own Representations.
Another Townley discussion, and the Chancellor, in defending the
Home Secretary, admitted that the present system under which sen-
tences are revised was most objectionable, and he thought we oaigUt
adopt the foreign plan of classifying the various decrees of murder.
The Ministry were defeated, by 101 to 93, on a motion of Lord
Robert Cecil's, for preventing Mr. Lowe from allowing the lie ports
of Inspectors of Schools to be "mutilated." Mr. Lowe urged that
they were not mutilated, but that he only out out matter which had aft
business there. The difference may strike the acute.
Wednesday. When Mr. Punch announced, ages ago, that Mr. Loce»
King had introduced a Bill for lowering the county franchise, the
Great Instructor added, " the Bill will be rejected some: time in April."
It was rejected to-day, by 158 to 45. Lord Palmerston would not
vote against it, because he thought that there ought to be a change in
the franchise, but he could not agree to lower it to £10, as that would
disturb the balance between trade and agriculture.
On an Irish Trespass Bill, Mr. Bright thought that while Irishmen
were flying their country, new powers ought not to be given for the
protection of game. Mr. Whiteside did not sec the logic, especially
as the object of the Bill was to relieve tenants from the hardship of
heing compelled by their landlords to prosecute poachers. We need
hardly say that no two human beings ever agreed upon au Irish ques-
tion, and at this moment we are utterly unaware whether the Irish
Salmon battle, which occupied a whole Session, gave the Salmons the
right of voting, or disfrancnised them for being Protestants.
Thursday. In reference to the Flogging Bill which has been men-
tioned, Lord Carnarvon said that all the gaolers who have been
examined agree that corporal punishment is more deterrent than any,
especially in the case of hardened offenders. The more we can hunt the
Cat out of the barracks and into the gaols the better. Lord Malmes-
bury took occasion to observe that the laws of England were not like
those of the Medes and Persians. The Barons said something different,
beginning with Nolumus, which Baron Malmesbtjry, though an Earl,
might have remembered, as he must have learned Latin at Oriel. Is he
going to turn Radical?
One Chalmers accuses the Admiralty of having prigged his ideas
about armour-plates. The First Lord was at some pains to prove that
though an iron-bound ship had a case, Chalmers had none.
"Shall not the Budget be postponed until we have discussed the
Malt-Tax, which many of us think ought to come off before the Sugar-
Duties?" Such was the question put to the House of Commons by
Colonel Barttelot, and the entire night was taken up in debating
what the answer should be. Finally, it was decided by 347 to 99 that
the answer should be "No," although the Malt-Tax had been under
discussion all those hours. Mr. Gladstone's sugar, corn, tea and
stamps resolutions were agreed to.
Friday. Lord Lucan thinks that soldiers ought to be enlisted for a
much longer term than at present. The Secretary of War states that
the present system works exceedingly well. Moreover, the change, which
shortened the term, was approved by the Victor of Waterloo. Where-
fore, the well-intentioned Lucan may cease his quite superfluous cluckin'.
Mr. Baxter would not take the place vacated by Mr. Stansfeld,
and it has beeu given to Mr. Childers, M.P. for Pontefract, and we
hope he will tear through work at the pace of his Flying namesake, the
quadruped of fame. It was extorted from Mr. Cowper, that the new
Museum at Broinpton, is to be large enough to hold the British Museum
beasts, and the Patents. Likewise, that a National Gallery is to be
built in the Garden of Burlington House.
Mr. Disraeli started up in great alarm, having discovered that there
are Five Under-Secretaries of State in the Commons, whereas the Con-
stitution permits four only to sit there. Lord Palmerston, equally
taken by surprise, begged time to consider the appalling fact. We may
be rash, even reckless; but we own that we should dine in peace, had
there been six.
Then we had an interesting debate on a motion of Mr. Forster's.
for a Committee to consider whether foreign nations could not be enabled
to communicate direct with the Foreign Office in matters of commerce,
instead of being handed backwards and forwards between that office
and the Board of Trade. As the interest in question is represented by
a receipt of £450,000,000 a-year, it may be just worth while to afford it
any reasonable business facilities. A Committee was appointed.
Debate whether the Irish are really virtuous, or whether they only
seem so because the Irish police cannot catch criminals, was enrled by
Mr. Osborne's declaring that whatever the people might be. Dahlia
Castle was a sink of iniquity. After which, an idea of Mr. Crawford's
that the Custom-house officers cannot discern between good sugar and
bad, was repudiated by the House by 133 to 17, and the Budget, which
has been accepted by the nation, made further, progress towards its
becoming law. Apropos whereof, a Bill is mMMTifl; is. for Concentrating
the Law Courts.

SINGING BY DEPUTY.

he famous School for Scandal was performed
the other morning with a famously strong cast,
as everybody knows, for the benefit of the
famous Royal Dramatic College; and every-
body knows, that on this special occasion the
part of Sir Harry, "with the original song," was kindly undertaken
by the famous Mb. Reeves, who, everybody might have known,
was conspicuous for his absence. The usual medical certificate was
produced, and read amid the laughter of the audience, who had
clearly come prepared to hear the usual apology which is expected
now whenever Mr. Sims Reeves is announced; and their merriment
was increased when his apologist informed them that the eminent
English tenor, Mr, Path, Bedford, had, in the emergency, been
asked to take the part. What cause there was for laughter Mr.
Punch could not quite see, unless, indeed, the audience expected
Mr. Bedford to sing them "Jolly Nose," instead of the more senti-
mental song which Sheridan has put into Sir Harry's vocal mouth.
Mr. Bedford played the character with far more weight than Mr.
Reeves (who is a slimmer man) could do; and if he did not sing the
song quite so sweetly as the latter might possibly have done, at least
he disappointed no one by not singing it. Mr. Punch would therefore
hope, that in future Mr. Bedford will hold himself in readiness to sing
for Mr. Reeves, whenever and wherever he is engaged to show him-
self. Considering how often Mr. Reeves is indisposed, it is high time
that a deputy should be permanently hired for him; and as Mr. Bed-
ford by no chance ever misses to appear when he is advertised, he is
about the fittest person to be chosen for the place. As it is, the
British Public, when they pay to hear Sims Reeves, are utterly uncer-
tain as to whom they really will hear; whereas, their doubt would be
dispelled, and tbeir good humour quite secured, were it announced
that Mr. Bedford would, if Mr. Reeves were absent, sing in Faust
or in Elijah, or whatever other music might chance to be selected for
him. Were it advertised beforehand that " Comfort ye, my people" or
"Sound an alarm," would, if Mr. Reeves were hoarse, "be sung by
Mr. Bedford, there would be no ground for complaint if Mr. Reeves
did not appear. Instead of keeping a physician continually in readiness
to certify that singers are afflicted with sore throats, surely managers of
theatres and concerts would do well to insist, that every singer whose
throat or inclination was apt at the last moment to compel nim to be
absent, should allow his name to be announced in the advertisements
coupled in a bracket with that of his appointed deputy, who, if he sang
or not, should share the plaudits and the pay.
ENGLISH EXTRA-SUPERFINE.
The subjoined example of jocular circumlocution is taken from a
report of Garibaldi's visit to the Royal Italian Opera. On this
occasion admission to the Floral Hall was given to persons going to the
boxes, stalls and pit, and to others at half-a-guinea each. And so:—
11 The doors wero opened for visitors at half-past *even, at wliich hour many
sought admission, and as evening dress had been made a tine qua non for all scion
after the hour named the place presented a very pleasing spectaclo, filled as it wits
by a crowd of peoplo whoso attire seemed to denote that they belonged to what ifl
usually denominated the * upper classes.'"
How many people there arc whose attire seems to denote that they
belong to " that part of society usually denominated the upper classes,'
when, if it were scrutinised, it would be discovered to oe of such a
quality as not by any means to denote the thing that it seems to! For
the style of evening dress wliich comes up to tine qua non, may be far
below the mark of ne plus ultra. And even when people's attire denotes
them to belong to those classes which are usually denominated, it does
not necessarily denote that they belong to those which really are, the
upper. Accordingly we are quite prepared for the reporter's succeeding
statement, that:—
11 For their amusement, previous to the arrival of the
visitor, tho
of the Hall, played
band of the Coldstream Guards, stationed at tho Bow Street
a selection of popular music, which the company listened to while perambulating
the spacious edifice."
This passage significantly suggests that those who were capable of
being amused by ' popular music were a sort of persons whose resem-
blance even to the merely so-called upper classes was but superficial.
We know what popular music is. A selection of music on the principle
of popularity would consist chiefly of such pieces as " The Cure," for
instance, "The Dark Girl dressed in Blue," and "/ 'm a Young Man
from the Country, but you don't get ocer me," with " The Whole Hog or
None," and a variety of negro melodies. The music which the company
listened to in the Floral Hall, "while perambulating the spacious
edifice," we may well suppose to have been carefully adapted to the ears
of " a crowd of people whose attire seemed to denote that they belonged
to what is usually denominated the 'upper classes,'" and who are so
described in a narrative which may be said to constitute a splendid
specimen of what is usually denominated penny-a-lining.
Last.
By advertisement we arc informed of another new work by Dr.
Cumming, The Destiny of Nations as indicated in Prophecy. A motto
which the prophetic doctor might prefix to this last production of his
literary constructiveness is " Small prophet, and quick returns."

ROME: NAPLES: LONDON.
THE WELCOMES OP GARIBALDI.
I saw three sisters: each of them a queen:
One with a stern square face, and regal brow,
Deep-lined where pressure of a crown had been,
With no crown save a priest's tiara, now.
Motley her garb: alb, chasuble ana cope,
Which, as her chafing still their folds would ope,
Beneath a tattered flamen's gown did show,
Or an Imperial toga's Tyrian sheen,'
Frayed, and besmirched with blood, and with debauch unclean.
Deep-bosomed and strong-limbed, and heavy-browed,
She sat like one that on a mighty past
Looks backward dreamily, from out a shroud
Of sin and shame and suffering round her cast,
Yet with an eager quivering of the nerves,
A memory of old conquest in the curves
Of her proud lip, lightnings that faded fast,
Yet stifl flashed up, under her eye-brows' cloud,
Saying.to men, "Beware! I am not crushed, though bowed."
More slight the Second Queen; a sweeter face,
Where Eastern languor tempered Southern fire;
Motions that gave to mirth their easiest grace,
But swept, in sudden storms, from mirth to ire:
The summer sun seemed seething in her blood.
The summer sky seemed mirrored in her mood;
So beautiful, so changeful; from desire
To loathing, from chill frown to hot embrace.
Her passionate gusts, like clouds, did each the other chase.
Bright vine-leaves wreathed her purple-glossy hair,
With grey-green olive, and gold-tassellea maize:
All gay ana parti-coloured was her wear,
Hall peasant's half princess's were her ways:
Blithe, buoyant, careless of to-morrow's fate,
So but to-day took mirthfulness for mate;
Ready for ban or blessing, scorn or praise;
For those who won her love with love to spare,
For those who earned her hate with a stiletto bare.
Sober and strong the third: of colder hue
And blunter features: yet a true-born queen:
The pure life telling in the brawny thew,
The honest nature m the eye serene.
The muscles knit with toil, whose tools did stand,
Mattock and spade and hammer, near her hand,
Yet not far off might other gear be seen,
Sword, bayonet, rifle, grooved and sighted true;
Uuhacked, unbruised, unused they might have been,
Yet yare, and lit for use,—blades sharp and barrels clean.
Crowned with fair towers she was, and from all lands
Trophies of art and industry, and spoils
Of labour and the chase, within her hands
She largely grasped: a mighty cable's coils
Her pillared neck, like Celtic tore of old
Circled with strands of triple-twisted gold.
She looked like one who, honouring manly toils,
Yet fit for more than sordid slaving stands,
And by a higher law than gold's her life commands.
These sisters communed curiously of one
Now in all mouths, one who among us came,
Though with no visible crown upon his brow,
King, crowned by deeds and consecrate by fame.
They knew him all the three, honoured and loved:
But question rose wherefore so greatly moved
Was that Third Queen, by one, to her, a name,
No liberator, at whose feet to bow.
So love can but be shown, not recking where or how

Quoth the First Queen: ■" For me he met the Gaul,
And beat Mm baffled back, one man to ten:
Held battered bastion long, and half-breached wall,
And bore my flag high in the eyes of men;
But you, oh Queen! sea-guarded and rock-based,
What foe of yours, what leaguer has he faced?
He left no wife for you in Snout's fen,
Tor you he staked not home and hope and all,
Nor showed he felt, for you, the dearest offering small."
The Second Queen said: "It were marvel strong
Should / not honour him who set me free
From Bourbon slavery and priestly wrong;
But what the liberation wrought for thee?
I crouched in fetters; his hand touched my chain,
It burst, and. lo! I sprang up free again:
But thoa unfettered art, save by thy sea,
Guardian, not gaoler; why thus loud and long,
The welcome of this man from all thy toiling throng?"
The Third Queen smiled, and answered them again:—
"True, gratitude nor love to him I owe,
That he maintained my walls, or broke my chain;
Yet I have chains to fear, ana a sore foe.
That foe world-worship, and that tyrant-sway
King Mammon's—worse than Gaul or Bourbon, they!
What living man has laid world-worship low
Under his feet, like this? Who, such disdain
Of chains that Mammon forge3 here below,
As this plain Captain did for Earth's example show?"
The voices ceased: vanished the vision fair,
But still those voices' music filled the air:
I heard the English crowd that went and came,
Loud pealing Garibaldi's pure and honoured name.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS/
In the last paper upon this subject I entangled my travellers in a
complication of street conversations, and in that network I, somewhat
unfairly, as it may seem to a few of the Unthinking, left them. The
case proposed was one requiring deliberation. To it, I will, at some
future time, venture a return, since it appears to me, that I have
incautiously advanced my students into toe sixth book, as it were, of
street-conversational problems, before they have^ thoroughly mastered
the rudiments of the first.
Let us then consider the Triologue, Quartologuc, and Quintologue,
&c, as subjects above our reach for the present. Let the last number
be unto us as an interpolation; and, herein, we will continue the
subject of the Simple Duologue. -
And, be it known unto all men, that the present writer's object is,
not merely to find fault with the mode ana style of such street con-
versations as come under his notice, but to improve, or rather to induce
his fellow-man, by a careful cultivation of expressions, sentences, salu-
tations, and valedictions, to improve the Art of Travelling Talk, hitherto
so lamentably neglected by even the highly-educated classes of Great
Britain, and I may. without offence, add, Ireland. To this end speaks
your Peripatetic Philosopher.
A few there are who, determined to import something of originality
into their dialogue, will, after the exchange of the first unanswered
greetings (I need not repeat them), come down upon you with the
statement of a fact, or a piece of news, which demands a show of interest
upon the part of the person addressed. As thus, the invariable prelude
being finished:—
A. Well? {Looks at B. smilingly, wondering if he's going to say
anything.)
B. Well P ( Would like to make some remark upon the weather, but thinks
he'd belter leave that for a last resort, in case nothing better turns up.)
A. I saw Charley in Town yesterday.
B. (not at the moment remembering who Charley m). No; did you?
A. Yes. He's in Town now.
B. Oh! {Here the conversation would come to an abrupt conclusion, but
that B. summons up sufficient courage to observe in an inquiring tone.) You
mean Charley Twiggletop?
A. No, no. Charley; my Brother. {He says this, as if it were
absurd lo suppose any other Charley could possibly be intended.)
"Oh! " says B., implying that this explanation has materially altered
the "question, whatever the question might, could, would, or should
have Deen.
A., having stated his fact, can only further impress it upon B. by
repetition. "Yes," says he, "I saw him yesterday.
"Ah, indeed!" returns B., to whom it now suddenly occurs, that
Charley, being his informant's brother, he, B., ought to exhibit some
extraordinary interest in him; so, with this idea, he adds, "1 should
like to see him."
"Well," answers B., "he '11 be in Town for some time."
"Oh!" says A., and seeing that he has necessarily committed himself
to a visit, feels compelled to asL "Is he staying at ?" This question
ends with a blank form, to be filled up by the other party.
B. No, he's at home. (This answer is intentionally vague, B. not
being quite sure as to whether a call from A. would be desirable.)
A. Oh! at ?{Blank again, to be filed up.)
B. {who won't fill up the blank, and, thinking it high time to finish the
duologue, begins to move off, saying jocosely mid sociably). Ies—same
old shop. Glad to see you. Mind you drop in.
A. lviUL With pleasure. {Then, with a view to probing the depth of
this hearty invitation, says) When P
B. (seeing through it, and not to be done). Oh! any time, any time.
Good bye! {adding more heartily than ever) take care of yourself. {Goes
off ^uiekly.)
A., taking this last unnecessary piece of advice as an impertinence,
merely smiles knowingly, concealing his thought by a pleasant double nod.
Now, you see, in the foregoing example, A. is undoubtedly at a disad-
vantage. B. oomes prepared with his statement. This same piece of
information, you may be sure, B. will repeat Ofer and over again to
everyone whom he may meet, for the next week to come. After
seven days or so, his commencement will be thus varied:—
"Charley was in Town last weak."
Then, in due course,
"Charley was in Town a fortnight ago."
After a month his single bit of information will assume this form:—
"Oh! Charley was in Town some little time ago."
And finally, retrospective observation yields to the prospective, and
B. tells you, with increased pleasure, that
"He expects Charley up in Ton shortly," or
"Charley's coming up next week."
Thus, my dear students, you will note how great an advantage it is to
be possessed of one invariable subject of conversation, which, by a mere
an entire existence. Perhaps
mutation of time, will serve you
you may be, unfortunately, obliged to substitute some other name for the
familiar one so often used. Ah! even in the midst of these most super-
ficial dialogaesof the street, we stumble upon a Reality; and if it should one
day chance that, when we meet A., he omits the old formula ooncerniug
his brother Charley, let us be cautious how we mention that^whtch he
avoids. Yes, my fellow-students, in the casual meetings of the merest
acquaintances, each, under cover of the hackneyed greetings and the
stalest forms of conventional salutation, may be practising the most
thoughtful and courteous consideration for the feelings of the other.
There are times, when the depth of the hatband will be, not only a valid
excuse, but a sufficient reason, for discussing the state of the weather,
the aspect of the country present and future, the police news of the
day's papers, or last night's Debate in the House.
A EUROPEAN ROW.
To Mr. Punch.
Sir,
You have a reasonable good ear in music; let you have the
tongs and bones: you are particularly fond of barrel-organs, I think,
and other locomotive harmonic machines, as well as of their itinerant
professors. Do you want a treat, then? If so, let me call your atten-
tion to a letter which has been written from Lyons by a gentleman who
signs himself " C. S. Merbjtt, Sec. pro tern?' Secretary to a Special
Committee of English residents in that city, associated with a larger
musical body:—
"On the 22nd of May will be held 1b Lyons, under the direction of the Commission
Gwn^ralo Org.wiis*trice, a ' Grand Coacoura1 of above 800 brass bands and choral
societies, coming from all parts of Franoe. Germany, Belgium, and Switaarland.
"The commission have unanimously adopted the resolution that the English
bands and musical societies should bo invited to come over and compete."
If the Philharmonic Band and the New Ditto, the bands of the two
Opera Houses, the entire vocal and instrumental executive of the Sacred
Harmonic Society, and the Monday Pops, together with that of the
Musical Union and Frank. Leslie's Choir, should unite in accepting
the foregoing invitation to go over and compete with three hundred
brass bands and choral societies, you will hear a competition unprece-
dented by anything of the kind, for the contest between Pan and Apollo
was another thing. You will hear this competition, Mr. Punch, whether
you go to hear it or not, if the three hundred brass bands and choral
societies on the one hand, and their antagonists on the other perform
together—that is as nearly as it will be possible for any conductor to
keep them together.
The efficiency of the brass bands will be much promoted if they are
joined by the Pope's Brass Band, as, being foreign bands, they might
well be; and the House of Commons would be relieved.
I am, Sir, your PMlliarmonic friend, ShjujuTious.
P.S. We can be blind or see at will. Why didn't Nature enable us
to stop our ears as well as our eyes, Sir? Oh, that cough below-stairs!

A HINT FOR TAILORS.

and old metal, and the poor-box be enriched with the pro-
ceeds of the sale.
Meanwhile, as the evening out-door concerts by the band
of the Commissionnaircs are certainly a step in the desired
direction—that, namely, of providing music for poor people
in places where their richer neighbours will not be annoyed
by it—Mr. Punch hopes that these concerts will flourish
and succeed, which, with his approval, they are pretty sure
to do.
OPEN-AIR CONCERTS.
Mr. Punch hates all street music with so cordial a hatred that he has almost
made up his mind to abandon the West End and go and live in Bethnal Green,
which is said to be so poor that a street band or a barrel-organ is never to be heard
in it. But street music is one thing, and park music another; and the band of the
Commissionnaires who perform now every evening in St. James's Park, give
unmixed pleasure to those who listen to it. There are few houses in St. James's
within earshot of these concerts, and, besides, the band plays at a reasonable hour,
when men have knocked off their day's work, and will not be disturbed by the
blaring of a trombone or the beating of a drum. So they who like to hear good
music in the open air should attend these out-door concerts which are daily given
gratis to those who can't afford to pay for entering the enclosure where the band is
stationed, for which privilege the sum of threepence is demanded, the entrance-
money going to the profit of the baud.
There are some persons who say that, as street music gives pleasure to a number
of poor people, other people who dislike it ought to grin and bear it for their poorer
neighbours sake. Now, Punch is ever ready to stick up for the poor, and would
be most unwilling to deprive them of a pleasure, seeing how few pleasures they are
able to afford themselves which richer folk can buy. Therefore, much as Punch
detests and execrates street music, and although it grievously disturbs him in his
work, he would not wish to see it prohibited entirely, though he certainly would
like to see it kept within fair bounds. This is a free country, and street organs
therefore flourish in it; but although they may give pleasure to some people, it is
undeniable that they give pain to others, while suffered to disturb sick persons and
brain-workers, as they virtually now do. So let street music be kept within some
reasonable control, and not be permitted where it is disliked. Spots for outdoor
concerts might surely be selected in various parts of town, where poor people might
rissemble for the sake of hearing music, and to these places let street bands and
street organs be confined. Any open air musician found performing out of bounds
should be beheaded, flogged, or flayed alive and dipped in boiling oil, according as
the magistrate in mercy should decide: and the barrel-organ, bagpipes, fiddle,
French horn, flute, trombone, or other instrument of torture on which he was
found playing, should be broken up and burnt, or else its fragments sold as firewood

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
A REPLY TO A PINK NOTE.
Dear little Governess, whose
pretty name is "Nina," and
whose character is evident
from her handwriting, com-
plains to Mr. Punch of having
been offered an engagement
by a pretender to religion
calling herself a lady, on terms
uncommonly shabby, even for
a hypocrite. She says, with
charming shyness, "I venture
to ask you to say something
in your own way (without
alluding to my letter or the
enclosed) upon this case."
Mr. Punch would be inex-
pressibly happy to execute
this order if he possibly could;
but even in stating it he
necessarily disobeys part of it.
Without alluding both to her
letter and to what is enclosed
therewith, it is impossible for
him even to say that he has
received a communication
from a young lady, informing
him of the wonderful mean-
ness of a party who shall be
nameless. He can say no
more on the subject, in his own way, or any way, than that the female who wanted his
correspondent to teach three children English, French, and Music, to wash them, dress them,
mend their clothes, and sleep in the same room with them, for a salary of nil, and no other
consideration beyond keep, and payment of her laundress, is a humbug, a skinflint, and a
screw, and that if her children grow iip in ignorance, vice, and dirt, it will be the fault of
their mother, who is too stingy to pay a proper price for their education.
Mr. Punch, however, will say this, that if he were a bachelor, he should himself have
an eligible engagement to offer on behalf of an unexceptionably handsome dealer, to the darling

who bespeaks his censure of a parsimonious hag.
The logic of Nina proves her such a true girl,
that he should certainly have proposed to her
the acceptance of that situation which is now
filled by another.
COOLNESS PARSONIFIED.
In matters of Church charity, clergymen are
certainly the coolest beggars living, whatever be
their warmth in Church doctrines and disputes.
Scarcely ever a day passes without our being
bored by post, or, worse still, by private inter-
view, to subscribe a five-pound note or so in aid
of some pet charity connected with the Church.
One of the last attacks upon our patience and
our purse was made last week, and, in sending
round the cap of maintenance by post, the
reverend beggars beg to call our notice to this
postscript at the foot of their appeal:—
"Should the reader be indisposed to contribute to the
fund, he is earnestly requested to return this Report to
Mk with hau-a-crown in postage stamps, in a
separate envelope, to assist in defraying the expenses of
the appeal."
We have often heard it said that asking costs
nothing, but in a-Jdng for subscriptions this is
not the case, and of course there are expenses
incurred in the collection of all charitable funds.
Still, we think it rather hard that people dis-
inclined, or who cannot well afford, to contribute
to a charity, should be asked for half-a-crown to
defray the cost of asking them if they will send a
cheque. Fancy a street beggar, when a shilling
is refused him, then "earnestly requesting" you
to give him a few coppers, to pay him forhis loss
of time and wear and tear of shoe-leather in
making the appeal!
BEEESHOP BEER.
Mr. Punch,
No doubt but what, when you've ben down our way you've
zin a feller in a mock frock out in the rhwoad on a Zunday arternoon,
a staggerin fust one zide o' the way and then t'other, zigzag, like a vlash
o' farked lightnun, only not so fast, and bimehy perhaps runnun slap
into the ditch, and comun vlop down.
You knows, in coorse, that there chap's drunk, and you thinks he've
a been drinkun two or dree ga'ans o' beer, as you've heerd zome on us
be able to do, and think notliun on't.
Not he. That feller most like han't a had above a pint. How much
more ood sitch as he be in case to affoord? I'll tell you what he've
ben drinkun of. In the fust place, no beer. The stuff zold under the
name of beer that have made that chap drunk, or pison'd un rather, is
the same sart of mixtur as what Mr. Du Cane t'other night in the
debate on the Malt-Tax gied the House a purscription vor from Dr.
Letheby. To be sure that was some of the mess that's sold at places
in London, but London beer or country beer, sitch kind o' public-nouse
beer is all one. This here's the compound; and Paamer med ha used
it instead o' stricknine:—
"A saccharine body—as foots and liquorice—to sweeten it; a bitter principle—
as'gontian, quassia, sumach, and Terra japtnuca—to give a stringency; a thickening
material—as linseed—to give body; a oolouring matter—as burnt sugar—to darken
it; CoccmIus Intlicu* to give a false strength ; and common salt, capsicum, copperas,
and Dantsic spruce, to produce a head, as well as to impart certain renuemonta of
flavour."
There, Mr. Punchy now you show that reseat to Mr. 8omes and
Mr. Lawson, and just you sav to 'urn, "There now, you United
Kingdom Alliance what-d'ye-call yourselves, now if you wants to per-
mote temperance and soberness, set to tryun to perwent publicans from
sellun sitch rotgout as that there. Dwoan't goo endeavour'n to bender
'um from supplyun holesome drink; but stop 'um from drenchun their
custumers wi' foots and lickerish, gentiun, quassier, sumick, terrer
japonicer, linseed ile, burnt sugger, cocklus hindicus, salt, capsicum,
copperass, and that good-for-nothun Jarman Dantzic spruce. Did
that, they'd praps do zum good. Couldn't they lay their two heads
together, and if there's any brains in 'um better than addled eggs, con-
trive a stronger law to punish them as 'dulterates beer? 'Tis too late
in the day, these times, to judge sitch offenders to be drowned in then-
own slops, but I do think they med be condemned to fine and imprison-
ment, with nuthun to drink but their cocklus hindicus and copperass
intire for a week.
In coorse you nose as well as I do that 'dulterated beer is owun to
the tax as makes malt dearer than copperass and the rest on't. Well,
howsomedever, I spose we must grin and bear the Malt-Tax, 'cause the
Incum-Tax is wuss, and the women and children hollers for cheap sugar;
zo Malt must gie way to Lollipops.

AMBI-OCULAR.
The Mark Lane Gazette contains the following appeal:—
TO REALLY EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ONLY.—Wanted,
^ Board and Residence (superior), in a village where a gentleman acting as a
Scripture Reader would be acceptable, and where trout-fishing and partridge-
shooting could bo procured. Address, Newton, &c.
This gentleman is evidently of the Divine Poet's opinion, that—
"Religion never was designed
To make our pleasures less."
There is a certain pleasant frankness about the advertisement. He is
particular about the creed of his hosts, but is by no means superior to
creature comforts, and the board and residenoe must be Superior. Our
Evangelical friend's combination of sporting and scripture reading
shows that Muscular Christianity is not the exelusive right of the
Broad Churchman, and we may venture to think that he will generally
do his readings in an evening, using the reasonably cloudy days, like
another St. Antony, in converting the fishes, only improving on that
Popish saint by converting them into Superior Board. As a scholar he
will remember Nulla dies sine Lined. We trust that he will be parti-
cular in bis language in the partridge-field, and never say, as alas wc
have too often heard worldly sportsmen exclaim, "Missed him, by
Jove!" or " Near as the Deuce! because that would be a very carnal
way of talking. However, we have good hopes of him, the rather that
he signs himself Newton, and has probably been christened after the
celebrated John Newton, first slave-trader, next evangelist. The only
objectionable word in his appeal is "acting." We hope that he is as
much in earnest about his reading as he manifestly is about his table
and sports. Altogether we consider the advertiser a very wide-awake
gentleman, with an eye a-piece for the celestial and terrestrial globes.

EXCESSIVELY INDISCREET.
The Conservatives, or at least the Tories, used to pique themselves
on politeness to the ladies. At times when the Whip thought nothing
of a woman unless she wore blue and canvassed butchers, the Tory
candidates invariably complimented the female auditors of election
speeches, and declared, that all women were Tories, because they loved
their homes, and their duties, and so on. But things are changing.
Here, on the supposed eve of a general election, when it is decidedly
the interest of all parties to be on the best of terms with the female
electors (they have no votes—haven't they, just ?), the new Conserva-
tive organ, the Realm, ccJmes out with the following declaration of war
against the ladies. Lion-hunting, says our young friend, has increased,
by reason of the increased liberty enjoyed by the fair sex." (Old-
fashioned phrase, isn't it? but never mind.)—
"Ladles formerly stayed at home more than they do now. We speak of middle-
class people. Whether it is that modern babies are better behaved, or that sewing-
machines save a deal of time formerly spent in stitching, or the fact that a number
of articles which used to be carefully prepared in the kitchen are now bought ready-
made at the grocer's; whatever be tno reason, the modern matron, whose mother
would have been immersed in household employments, finds plenty of time, if a
Londoner, to go to the Crystal Palace, and patronise John Parry, Woodin, and Co.;
or if a provincial dame, to come up to town lion-hunting. Now we have put the
cap on the person whom it fits. It is the provincial lady of the middle-class who is
always in exuberant Crinoline, assisting at ship-launches, layings of first stones,
presentations of colours, anniversaries, centenaries, tercentenaries—what you will.

The Shakspeare Monument.
At length we read that "It is proposed to commemorate the300th
birthday by erecting in London a monument embracing a bronze state
of Shakspeare."
The idea is affectionate, but the design will require some care, as thf
attitude of a monument embracing a statue may seem a little awkn™-
The mopument must not be too tall, or it will have to stoop to the
naciously driving before and behind her carriage, and staring at her with eyes of
double-opera-glass power. It is she who, for want of better game, pursued Mr.
Henry Ward Beecher from Exeter Ball to the ocean steamer in the Mersey. It Ls
she who will now do her best to spoil General Garibaldi's temper by her incessant
persecution. For goodness* sake 1 let him alone, Madam."
Now, without saying whether any part of this allegation is true—not
that Punch is afraid to say anything to the ladies, who adore him as he
adores them, and who can never be offended with him—Mr. Punch
begs to say that the promulgation of such opinions just now is indis-
creet. And if the Whig electioneerers know their work, they will
reprint the above paragraph by thousands, heading it, "Tory Opinion
of the Ladies." and circulate it profusely in every electoral district.
Then, when the dissolution has come, and the new writs are out, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
F course you know, dear
Punch, that, as our Shak-
speare needs no monument,
it has suddenly occurred to
us that we ought to give
him one. There are various
opinions as to what his mo-
nument ought properly to
be, and, since we are poor
hands at making monuments
in marble, it has been fancied
by some few of us that a sub-
stantial Shakspeare monu-
ment composed of bricks and
mortar would better serve
our turn. The suggestion, 1
believe, was first started in
your columns that a stately
Shakspeare theatre would
be the noblest monisnent
that England could atect,
and one that - Shakspcare.
were he living, himself would
most approve of. The tge
that knows not Shakspeare
I trust will never come:
but, at any rate, its advent
would be very much delayed
were there a national Shakspeare playhouse in the land that gave
him birth, and were it a condition in the tenure of that theatre that
one at least of Suakspeare's plays should yearly be produced there,
with all the pomp and circumstance the nation could command.
I have heard it sometimes argued that the time may come when
Shakspeare will cease to prove attractive, when his plots will be
thought feeble, his humour strained and pointless, and his language dull
and obsolete. For this the influence of railways is cited as a cause; and
though the fancy may seem laughable, there really seems some ground for
it. Railways certainly have made people less patient than they were at
public places of amusement, and less tolerant of anything approaching
to longwindedness, which some of Shakspeare's characters are clearly
rather given to. But I have not much fear myself of the bad time ever
coming, when Shakspeare will be sneered at as being too slow to keep
pace with the age, and so be shunted off the stage as being worn out
and old fashioned. Notwithstanding railway influence and fast trains,
and men to match, I still hold true to the belief that Shakspeare
"lived not for an age," but for all dramatic time, and that, while human
nature lasts, his plays, which picture it so faithfully, will ever be attrac-
tive. Croakers who pretend to have lost their faith in this, should go
to Drury Lane just now, and see how Shakspeare Alls it, and how the
many hundreds, who nightly are drawn thither by his play of Henry IF.,
strain eagerly their ears to catch the words that Shakspeare wrote for
them to near, and their eyes to see the action that accompanies the
words.
On the whole I think the play is very creditably played, and has been
carefully produced. Hotspur I applaud for Ins gallant speech and
bearing, but he must be careful lest his vehemence be too much for his
voice. I thought perhaps he acted best in the scenes where he is tamed
a bit, while prattling to bis wife, and his playful rugged tenderness she
took as a wife should. Falstaff I applaud too, with but little reserva-
tion, although if he were more unctuous, he would more be the fat
knight. In one addicted so to drink, the humour should not be too dry.
The Glendower scene and Welsh song have too often been omitted,
and are worthily restored; but, prithee, good Sir John, why is your
royal Crown and Cushion bit of merriment left out? And, good Mr.
Stage Manager, let the tumult of the battle not die away too much
while the set speeches are spoken; and it might make the scene more
life-like were a few more deaths to happen in it. After such a scrim-
mage as takes place upon the mound, one would expect a few additions
to the four dead men discovered at the opening of the scene, posed
neatly two and two, with their legs precisely parallel. The armour,
too, is certainly not strictly "of the period," as a glance at Mr. Punch's
History of Costume will clearly serve to show: but one need not be too
critical about these minor matters, if the broader stage effects are
attended to with care.
It is the authors fault perhaps that in many of the scenes it pleased
me quite as much to see the audience as the stage. They mostly
seemed so heartily to enjoy his play, that I myself enjoyed the sight of
their enjoyment as much as that of what was causing it. Of course the
stalls and the dress circle repress their approbation in obedience to the
stupid laws of boarding-school propriety which still govern at our theatres
the fashion of the day. There were no stalls or dress circle in the time
when Shakspeare wrote, and I '11 be sworn that good Queen Bess
and the fine ladies of her Court did more than feebly smile and snigger
at the humour of Jack Falttaff when they went to see the play. It
is a bad thing for the drama this abstaining from all natural emotion
and applause, and giving vent to feeble sniggers where there should be
hearty laughs. To stir up his stage impulses and make him act his
best, an actor must have sympathy both visible and audible, and if it
fails him from the boxes, be seeks it from the gallery, and is apt to
suit his acting to the pleasure of the gods. But despite the seeming
apathy of the Swells at Drury Lane and the Snobs who try to copy
them, the stalls and boxes snow themselves amused and entertained
as never a sensation play amused or entertained them; while as for
pit and gallery, the way they " brayvo" Hotspur's energy, and roar at
Falstaff s fun, should make the Shade of Shakspeare quit Elysium
one evening, and for that night only revisit this dull earth. I say, for
one night only, for although at the Princess's his Comedy of Errors
might have somewhat of temptation for him to prolong his stay with us,
I fear that elsewhere on our stage now there is little he would care for.
However much we have improved things in the last three hundred
years, we certainly have never excelled Shakspeare in our plays. In
stage effects and scenery we might show him something new, and as
compared with his dim, feebly candlclighted age, we might astonish
him perhaps by our superior enlightenment. But after all, one must
admit that people go to theatres to hear as well as see; and to people
who have anything that they can call a mind, there is less enlighten-
ment in gas and limelight moonshine than in sparkling fancy, and
brilliancy of wit.
Well, though we have no second Shakspeare we can boast of, we
may at least be thankful for the one we have; and we never should lose
sight of his presence on our stage, seeing we have little hope of looking
on his like. 0ne who ^s
P.S. I must just say two words for the two smart new burlesques
which were brought out on Easter Monday, the one at the Haymarket
and the other at the Royalty, which latter little nutshell of a theatre
is far better than a large one as a place for cracking jokes in. Under
Mrs. Selby'b management, the Royalty is rivalling the Bandbox in the
Strand in its repute for smart turlesques,—smart in scenery and
costumes as in parodies and puns.
FANCY BLACK.
Advertised in a contemporary, amidst a lot of other melancholy
millinery, we find, "Articles de Fantaisie Pour Deuil."
Only fancy articles of fancy for mourning! Fancy-mourning; fancy-
weeds: how fanciful! And what are they ?—" Chemisettes, Tulle
Sleeves, Berthes, Canzons, Jupons, Robes de Chambres, Garnitures des
Robes," &c. What sadly sweet things in mourning! Elegance in
sables! The idea of fancy mourning dress suggests that of a fancy
mourning dress ball. There is a "Lord Lovel Quadrille," which might
be danced on such an occasion, for one thing, and some dance-musical
genius might compose a "Coffin Quadrille" for another; also a
"Shroud Waltz," a "Knell Polka," and a Cotillon, which might be
called "The Cemetery." To descend from the fashionable sphere of
dancing to the plebeian, the more vivacious of the gay and festive
mourners, attired in articles de fantaisie pour deuil, might trip it on
the light fantastic toe to an " Undertaker's Hornpipe" or a' Mute's
Jig." Fancy mourning, perhaps, is meant to denote the grief of the
heirs of rich old gentlemen and ladies.
A NEW FAMILY.
It appears by the police reports that one banner was missing from
the Garibaldi procession, and its absence is to be deplored. Some-
body detained it from the rightful owners until too late for show. It
was the banner of the "Sons of Phoenix." We particularly wish we
had seen this illustration of natural history, as we have always bad
grave misgivings touching our friend Phoenix, and we should much like
to be introduced to his family. That he is a downy bird we never
doubted, but his sons appear to have carried downiness to the point of
softness, or they would not have let their flag be kept from them. But
we are glad the magisterial Beak helped the poor honest fellows, and
Mr. Punch hereby makes up to them the disappointment. Garibaldi
might not have seen their banner, he will be sure to see this.
Aerial Musicians.
Macbeth did "murder sleep;" so do the organ-grinders, besides
murdering Bellini and other composers. Owen Glendower says to
his company:—
"Tboie musicians that, shall play to you
, Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence."
Mr. Babbage, and other gentlemen of tender ears/would perhaps be
glad if the organ-fiends who distract their souls were hanging in the
air no farther off than the Old Bailey.

And, good fruit at home since wise policy bears,
Find fault with their betters in Foreign Affairs.

particulars see the popular Glee by the late Sir H. Bishop), and

To return.
He who adopts the Caroline or Charleian method, has great advan-
tages over the man of unsettled plan. Mrs. Gamp, it occurs to me,
was a Professor of this method. She never could fail in a conversation,
as long as she stuck to her Mrs. Harris. Make therefore for yourself
a Mrs. Harris. All difficulty vanishes at once; never shall you falter in
a duologue.
Thus: You make Wiggins your conversation-peg.
Good. You meet X: How are you, &c, &c, &c.
"Wiggins asked after you the other day," you then begin. If
your friend is taken aback, as he probably win be, or does not wish to
own his ignorance of one, who appears to have felt such an interest in
his welfare, he will say, as if in pleased surprise. "Did he?"
Upon which it is evident that you have it all your own way, and can
continue in what strain you will. For instance,
"Yes! he says he never sees you now." Here your friend may feel
compelled to account for not having been seen by Wiggins: if he
doesn't make any remark, go on. "By the way, I fancy he's goingto be
married. I don t know, I merely fancy so." This may lead to a con-
fession: if not, continue:—" I should like you two to dine with me, at
the Club, one of these days." Of course he will be delighted to meet
Wiggins, and may admit at this point, that he can't call to mind where he
has become acquainted withWiGGiNs, though, he will inform you, the name
seems familiar to him. "Oh!" you will answer, "he knows you, well
enough, by reputation." This will please him, whoever he is. And
you must meet him. What do you say to one day next week?" Your
friend has nothing to say to one day next week, or next month for that
matter; but after some show of consideration, he tells you that "he
shall be disengaged on certain days," and then looks at you, expecting
the invitation forthwith. "Very good," you reply. Then I'll ask
Wiggins, and find out when he can come. Good bye. Don't forget."
As you move away, be very particular on calling out, "Don't forget!"
it's just as good, real, ana as hearty as if you had given your friend a
positive invitation, date and time fixed. He departs, impressed with
the idea that he's going to dine with you, on one day next week
to meet Wiggins, and subsequently accepts other bond fide invi-
tations conditionally. Well, the dinner never comes off. What of
that P At some future time you two meet again. "Well," says he,
quite seriously, " I suppose you couldn't get Wiggins." You must take
care that this does not throw you off your guard; for ten to one but
you have forgotten all about the proposed Wigginsian festivity. Be
ready: do not appear puzzled— saying, "Wiggins! let me see—let me
see—Wiggins I or he may find you out, and. henceforth, in all con-
versations with him, you '11 have to be provided with some new topic;
which is vexatious. You will therefore say, "Ah! old Wiggins; he's
so busy! can't get away for a moment! But he's going to take a
holiday very soon, and then—then—my boy—we'll—" here, wink
knowingly, or use any action or facial expression, that will best describe

On my word I am disgusted. I give it 'up as a bad job. Do I not
well to be angry? After preaching for these many weeks past, after
pointing out unto my fellow-citizens the faults in their every-day street
conversations, hang me if they are not just as bad as ever they were!
Can I struggle with the inevitable P I am a Peripatetic, and to me is
not the Stoical patience. Yet will I make a last attempt at a reforma-
tion. My boy in buttons shall follow me, carrying a Diogenic tub,
something between a caviare barrel and a five-gallon cask. This shall
he place at the corners of frequented streets, and I, mounted upon the
top of it (Buttons will also carry a pan: of steps), will fulfil my
mission.

GRIEF OVER A CROQUET IRON, TAKING A HEADER INTO THE ARMS OF LADY HoNOBIA BOUNCEB 1
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
April 18lh, Monday. About five-and-twenty years ago, when Mr.
Punch's hair was not so dark as it now is when he has had proper time
to attend to his toilette, there appeared in the Examiner some very
clever papers on Nursery Rhymes. It was sought to' prove that the
series of apparently artless and not particularly coherent chants with
which mediaeval Mammas stilled the wails of the babies of the dark ages,
really comprised the most remarkable prophecies. Air. Punch remem-
bers being much struck with some of the interpretations, and they were
recalled to his mind by the awful event revealed on the Monday he is
mentioning. The Examiner writer quoted one couplet of which he was
unable to discover the secret meaning. It was this Nursery Song:—
"Bibble O. Bobblo O, Long Jack and Robin O,
Sbut your eye, eat a pie, mind you pull the bobbin, 0."
It must be admitted that the mystery of the meaning in these lines
might puzzle the Sphynx or Dr. Cumming. But everything comes to
him who knows how to wait. Monday revealed the secret. Let us
apply ourselves calmly and dispassionately to the interpretation of
prophecy, and we shall soon see how beautifully it fits into our
grooves.
Bibble 0 is a rendering of the Greek word signifying a book. Bobble 0
means Bob Lowe. Long Jack is more obscure, but Paxmebston is
not short, and his second name is John—this is a trifle when you are
at prophecies. Robin 0 is a touching reference to the last "Inspector"
of the Children who were taken from their home on the pretence of
education, "to be brought up in fair London." Shut your eye is a
delicate allusion to a matter so notorious, and so pointedly alluded to in
the next mentioned debate, that there need be no scruple about it.
"Mr. Lowe could not see what was going on in the House." Eat a
pie refers to the pie of humility which it was vainly sought to press
upon Mr. Lowe. Mind you pull the bobbin, 0, is in other words, be
sure that you have plenty of fled Tape at hand.
Now, dear brethren, put all these things together, and see how the
nursery prophecy enshrined the events of Monday. Bob Lowe,
charged with mutilating a Book, containing the reports of the In-
spectors of the Schools for poor babes, was defended by Lord Palmer-
ston, had been unable to see the document his foes were handing about
the House on the night of the hostile division, would not eat humble
pie, but had to succumb to red tape traditions, and has resigned!
Why, if Dr. Cumming could get within a mile of such evidence, he
would fix within five-and-twenty minutes the time when the next comet
is to knock this world into the middle of the sun. We rejoice to have
such an opportunity of showing our own skill, and of recalling recol-
lections of the wit of our ola friend the Examiner, who, by the way,
still upholds the cause of scholarly and epigrammatic writing against
the graphic slipslop and gush of the day.
Mr. Bob Lowe is no longer a member of the Government, and Mr.
Punch has something more to say. Mr. Lowe's exculpation of himself
from the charge brought against him was incomplete on the first night,
as Mr. Punch ventured to hint, but was so complete on the second that
the absurd thing is that he should have resigned. The Opposition have
ejected another good man, and on another frivolous pretence. It is
said that the old Whig lot in the Cabinet were very cold about the
matter, and did not care to stand by Lowe, as he is not one of the bine
blood. Had he been a Grey or an Elliott, he would not have been
sacrificed in this summary fashion. However, that is the Cabinet's
business, and if it is strong enough to tlirow away its good cards
without equivalent, let the game go on. Mr. H. Bruce, Member for
Merthyr Tydvil, succeeds Mr. Lowe, and has been re-elected. In his
address to his Welsh constituents lie showed with much exultation
that the Irish are an awful deal wickeder than the Welsh, numbers of
course duly allowed for. This is true; but then the Welsh live close to
a civilised nation, the English, and have the benefit of the example of
their neighbours. We must not be Pharisaical, my Cymry, although it
is quite right to set a proper value on ourselves, my bounding goats of
Snowdon.
To-day, Mr. Disraeli, in a strain of solemnity that might have
befitted the impeachment of Lord Palmehston for selling himself to
Tartary or Tartarus, opened up the dreadful story of the Five Under-
Secretaries. Let us at once allay the agitation of the country by
stating that Lord Palmerston owned his crime, but charged the
other side with being accomplices, and that the fearful danger to the
State has been removed. Sometimes it passes through our minds that
Mr. Disraeli has a noble ambition to be described in some brilliant
political novel of the next century, as "Lord Runnymkde, the spark-
line- seentic. who hp.lieved in nothine except the British Constitution,

and chiefly in that because he was its sole exponent in an age when
men shuddered at first principles."
Tuesday. Garibaldi having decided on* ending his visit to England,
much row arose among a certain class. It was not enough to tell them
that Garibaldi, by no means recovered from a dangerous wound, has
to take care of himself, and that if he is killed in England he will never
be able to do anything more for Italy. They roared and spluttered,
insisted on knowing better than the doctors or the patient himself,
passed resolutions, forced themselves into his presence, and all but
blew him up for daring to have a will of his own. Then it was
set about that the Emperor of the French was offended at Gari-
baldi's reception, and wished him sent away. Lord Granville and
Lord Palmerston having denied this, the Emperor of Austria was
next pitched upon, and the Conference was said to be delayed because
that Emperor demanded Garibaldi's extrusion. This absurdity being
extinguished, the Snobs did not know what to do, and Mr. Gladstonb
finished them all off by stating that he and others had advised Gari-
baldi to visit only a few of the provincial towns, but that he did not
like to make distinctions, and thought his best course was to go away.
Lord Shaftesburt has written to the same effect, and it will take a
good many tons of Snobbery to balance six words from Mr. Gladstone
and Lord Shaftesburt. So the hero departed, the Prince of Wales
having done himself honour and pleased the nation by paying Gari-
baldi a visit at Stafford House. Mr. Punch may also mention that
Garibaldi received a deputation from the Federals, declared himself a
Federal, and said that had his sword been needed by the North, it
should nave been drawn for Mr. Lincoln. It appears to Mr. Punch
to be needed excessively, but he is extraordinarily glad that it is not to
be drawn in a quarrel of which the brave, good, but easily-misled
Garibaldi sees but one phase only.
Wednesday. There was debate on a Bill about Irish Grand Juries, but
whatever it was, it was thrown out by 150 to 27, so we need not bother
about that.
Thursday. Garibaldi visited both Houses of Parliament, but did not
stop long, having to go into the City, and be made a Fishmonger.
Now he is at least as good as the owner of the Seal of the Fisherman.
To-night, while he was in the Senate, Lord Chelmsford was affording
the Chancellor an opportunity of expatiating upon the excellence of
his measure for cheapening Conveyancing. And there is no doubt that
the Act is an admirable one, but what can you do if the Solicitors set
themselves against it? And why should not the Solicitors set them-
selves against it, seeing that the only way in which a skilful gentleman
of that profession can get fairly paid for his labour and brains is by
means of long instead of short dceds|? A plan must be devised for
remunerating a scientific gentleman on some other principle than that
of the bill into which he is forced to stick as many foolish items as
possible. Some articles by Mr. Punch, at the time the subject was in

probable that the famous tin ,™

In the Commons, after Mr. Gladstone's Garibaldi explanation,
Mr. Sheridan endeavoured to disturb the Fire Assurance arrange-
ment proposed by the Budget, and was defeated by 170 to 117.
Afterwards an insidious attempt to convert the Committee on Mr.
Gladstone's Annuities Bill into a Shelf for that admirable measure
was also defeated, after a little plain English from Pam.
Friday. Lord Derby is resolved upon doing something for the
working classes who are ejected from their homes by what Cobbett
scoflingly called " warst Improvements," but which are improvements
for all that. The Earl insists that railwajs shall provide cheap trains
for taking the labourer to and from his work. This is not much to
demand, when we consider the monopoly conceded to the railways.
But the remedy will only meet half the grievance. The working
class want decent houses in and not out of town, and the question of
Block Colonies will come up sooner or later.
In a Chinese debate, Mr. Liddell clearly showed that we had done
everything that was wrong, and Mr. Latard demonstrated as clearly
that we had done everything that was right, after which the topic got
into the hands of Mr. Ferrand, and the House of course yawned and
counted itself out.
Saturday. Mr. Punch published his Tercentenary Number in honour
of Shakspeare, whose birthday this either was or was not, most likely
the latter, firstly, because Babies are not usually christened on the third
day, secondly, because New Style brings the alleged birthday to the 3rd
of May, and lastly, because there was an east wind in spite of the heat,
and Mr. Punch had no inclination to march in processions, or do any-
thing except contemplate with ecstasy his own magnificent picture of
his own Shakspearian procession.

CURS AND CRINOLINE.
The Times critic of the Cremorne Dog Show says in a judicious
notice of that interesting exhibition:—
"The pugs with which Hooarth has made us generally familiar—the rage in the
days of Queen Anne and hooped petticoats, and which have become fashionable
again under the congenial reign of crinoline—are here in great force. They are as
ugly as buUdogs, and as big as what the fancy has loft bulldogs now-a-days, but not
half so intelligent."
It is curious what a variety of things, many of very clifferent kinds,
are associated by some mysterious law of affinity. Some of them, to be
sure, are visibly and sensibly related, and go naturally together. Lamb
and mint sauce, beans and bacon, ducks and green peas, are intelligible
combinations, to be accounted for on gastronomies] principles. There
is an obvious connection, between a bulldog and a ruffian like Bill
Sykes. Some may not see at first sight any similar fitness in the com-
panionship between a pretty girl in hooped petticoats and a pug; but,
to an testhetical eye, as is the bull-dog to the knee-tights of the burglar,
so is the pug-dog to the skirts of the oelle, and the same relation extends
to the ankle-jacks of the former and the Balmorals of the latter. Hooped
petticoats and pugs have the common property of absurdity, and of a
beauty which consists in ugliness. Accordingly, the ridiculous fashion
and the grotesque animals in question came in together, continued
together, went out together, and reappear together. Hooped petti-
coats are always in the way, so are, pug-dogs; * both agree not only in
not being ornamental, but also in not being useful, nay, on the contrary,
in being inconvenient. Pugs are subject to hydrophobia, crinolines
occasion death by fire. Both are nuisances, constantly incurring the
execrations and maledictions of men. Between your worse than useless
crinoline and worse than useless cur there is a singular concurrence.
Very significant, too, is the fact that crinoline finds its natural corre-
spondence in creatures of the canine species; for that evidently denotes
it to be an excrescence of female puppyism.

THE SHAKSPEARE FLOWER-SHOW.
Poor Mr. Flower, the Mayor of Stratford and the manager of the
Shakspeare fetes, has had an anything but blooming time ot it of late.
He must have wished himself transplanted far away from where they
have potted him, for he has clearly not been living in a bed of roses.
First one Hamlet failed him, and th,en, alas! another • and when he had
come to terms with a Juliet in place of them, alaclc-a-day! the other
"leading lady" he relied on sent in her resignation, and left him in a
huff.
Well, let us trust that nevertheless the Shakspeare Flower Show will
succeed and bear abundant golden fruit. One might have hoped that
actors, wheu requested to do homage to the memory of Shakspeare,
would not have let their private jealousies hurt the public cause. As
the Flower Show at Stratford was meant solely for Sweet William, it
was certainly unseemly to show any London Pnde at it. However, we
repeat, we hope it may succeed, and that worthy Mr. Flower, who is
the very pink of courtesy, will not in any way be knocked to pieces by
the show, but be in his usual blooming condition at the end of it.

"Mr. Scttlly wished to put a question to the Chancellor or the Exchequer
relative to the reply he had just given to tho honourable Member fur Perth, whether
In the course of the conversation he had had with General Garibaldi he stated to
him that tho feeling of the Metropolis of England represented the feeling of the
people of Ireland on this subject (laughter), and did he recommend him not to go to
Ireland! (continued laughtery'
Was the honourable gentleman, whose utterly irrelevant question,
addressed as above to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, created
"laughter," and "continued laughter" Mr, Vincent Scullt or Mr,
Num Scull P or both?
Citt Intelligence.—Should the proposed Asylum for decayed Bill-
Brokers, Jobbers, and others on 'Change be ultimately built, it will
probably be at Stock-holm.

SINFULNESS OR SWIPES.
In a speech ou the Burial Service, the Rev. R Seymour, on liis legs
in the Lower House of Convocation, is reported to have cited the case
of a clergyman, the Vicar of St. Giles, Cambridge, who, some years ago,
had been suspended for refusing to bury a parishioner who had been
found dead in a ditch the morning after he had been last seen turned
out of a public-house in a drunken state. According to the Post, the
reverend speaker said, with reference to this unfortunate man—
"Let them strike out all the aervlco but the Biblo Lesson and the Lord's Prayor,
and oven then it would not be a fit service for such a sinner."
"Hear! hear!" from the assembled parsons. Hear what?
Such a sinner? So very great a sinner? How does Mr. Seymour
know that? Is he prepared to say that the deceased died of mere
excess; of drinking more than the equivalent of a clerical quantity of
sound port? May not the man have been merely the victim of bad
beer? Can Mr. Seymour take upon himself to say that this same
sinner was not "more sinned against than sinning?"
APRIL GARDENING TOR POLICEMEN.
Procure some of the old-fashioned Bow Street Runners, and train
them over your windows. A very pretty effect.
• Cab-Law.—If a Cabman or Organ-grinder is impertinent, you may
"shut him up," without being liable to the penalties of false imprison-
ment.
PUFFING AND PLAY BILLING.
Play-bill and Puff used once to be synonymous; and though we
have reformed the practice in part, we have not reformed it alto-
gether. Managers still blow their own trumpets in their own bills
more loudly than good taste justifies. We have not quite ceased to see
empty benches in the theatre transformed into "crowded houses." in
the bill; and very flat fiascos figuring away, in large letters, as " brilliant
successes." "Great nit" might still be translated every now and then
out of bill-fiction into treasury-fact as " miserable miss." In short,
farewell performances are not the only ones as to which the bill of the
play is not yet quite reliable. But besides being a stage for managers
to blow their trumpets from, the play-bill has another function. It is
the pedestal for the actor—that uuplumed peacock—to spread his tail
on, and admire himself, in all the glory of single lines and big letters.
Woe to the manager who dares bracket Mr. Bellows, the eminent
tragedian, with Mr. Small-bones, the walking gentleman, or to print
the name of the great Grigsbt, that popular low-comedian, in type no
argcr than that which sets out the name of Mr. Fumble, the second
old man. Rival eminences and pretensions in a theatre are gauged and
marked, ticketted and tested by primer and pica, and the lines of
demarcation between the histrionic upper-ten and rag-tag and bobtail
arc drawn by "double-leads," "rules," and " spaces."
Where manager and popular actor meet in the same body, it is no
wonder if the play-bill become too small for these two very great gen-
tlemen rolled into one colossus. And in the exact proportion that
the name of Mr. or M. Swagger grows bigger, those of Mr. or M.
Swagger's unhappy company dwindle, and grow less; till the troupe is
reduced to the dimensions of the smallest possible rushlights that
scarcely dare even to twinkle iii the blaze of the great central star. Of
course if the rushlights have any power of shining the central star
quietly appropriates their light, and revolves on his own axis with
immense pleasure to himself, though not always with the same
satisfaction to his employes or the public. But of all odious forms in
which this selfish assumption has lately taken to show itself, there is
one quite new, and that puzzles us. We learn that on such a night,
Mr. Swagger will appear (in all the distinction of large capitals),
say, as Bottom, supported by Messrs. Cypher, Small, Nobody.
Twopenny, Halfpenny, and Mesdames Shy, Still, Aspen, ana
Quiver, &c. (all in the humility of the smallest type).
How Mr. Swagger comes to be supported by actors so immeasurably
inferior as his company appear to be in his eyes, we are at a loss to
understand, unless it be that he is supported by them in the sense of
getting on to their shoulders, making them pedestals for his own eleva-
tion, and stepping-stones on his own way to success and fortune. Or
it may be that Mr. Swagger, in describing himself as "supported
by" Messrs. Cypher, Small & Co., means to confess that he is kept
on his legs by their services.
In whichever sense the word is used, whether as an avowal of cool
assumption or humble demerit, it is too candid. We should recommend
our stage Swaggers to trust more to their plays and less to their play-
bills, more to their theatrical achievements and less to their tricks of
type, more to the voice of genuine criticism and less to the sonorous
blasts of their own brazen trumpets. They may be sure that as " good
wine needs no bush," so good acting needs no puffery j and that if then-
art be tricky and their triumphs hollow, not all the self-laudation and
self-assertion fhat can be worked by forty-bill-sticker power will ward
off the day of detection, or avert the hour of downfall.
The jackdaw will be plucked bare of his peacock's feathers, though
he spend twenty hours out of the twenty-four in contemplation of his
borrowed tail, and have half succeeded in persuading himself, by dint of
assuring the public, that the feathers are his own, and that nobody else
has any right to wear them.
SHAKSPEARE AND SCIENCE.
Once, when Mr. Buckstone was performing Lear, at Drurv Lane,
with Mr. Pall Bedford in the part of Edgar, on his delivery,
in his usually impressive style, of that sublime passage—
"First lot mo talk with this philosopher:—
What is the cause of thundor?"
a precocious little girl, aged nine, the daughter of Mrs. Crammer
Head, exclaimed to her mother, loud enough to be heard all over the
house:—" Dearest Mamma, I can tell. It is the vibration of the par-
ticles of the atmosphere occasioned by the instantaneous transition of
the electric fluid."
Horrible!
An Illiterate Carpenter was the other day 'arrested upon his own
written confession. In a letter to his wife he had said that, "he'd
been to the Heastun Countess Stashun to catsh a train, when he had
saic'd his frend in two."

ASSES AT CANTERBURY.
How Shakspeare was commemorated 'at Canterbury,
we don't know; but the Kentish Chronicle thus tells us
how he has been slighted there :—
"The Sir John Falbtae* Inn, Canterbury. — Canterbury has
disgraced itself in the eyes of the literary world at a time when all
nations are preparing to do honour to the name of our immortal
Shakspeare. The Canterbury Pavement Commissioners, by a ma-
jority of one I have decreed the removal of Sir John Falstaff in that
city. For nearly a century has the sign been suspended by hand-
some iron-work before an inn at the west entrance to the city, near
the Westgato towers. It is but lust to say that aU the thinking and
intelligent members of the Court' opposed its removal. As a proof of
the obtuseness of one of tie Dogberry* who voted for its being taken
down, he was heard to say that ■ Shakspeare's works were rubbish.'
No doubt there are more people who, like the Dog-
berry above alluded to, think that Shakspeake's Works
are rubbish, than are dreamt of in your philosophy of
human nature. All the Bogberrys hate Shakskare in
their hearts, from a dim consciousness of stupidity which
makes them dully sensible of having been ridiculed in the
characters of Dogberry, and Verges, and Shallow. The Can-
terbury Pavement Commissioner who calls the works of
Shakspeare " rubbish," has Dogberry's wish fulfilled, for
Mr. Punch has the greatest pleasure in recording him as
the animal which his prototype desired himself to be
written down—an ass as great as any in Canterbury, and
that is saying something, and a great deal more than what
Dogberry wanted to be booked.
SHAKSPEARE IMPROVED.
To Mr. Punch.
Sin, • ■
I went, the other evening, to Drury Lane to see
Henry IV, and it struck me that Shakspeare missed a
capital point in that play, where Falstaff, in Act v., is lying
down, pretending to be killed, whilst Prince Henry makes
a speech over the body of Hotspur. Addressing his slain
antagonist, the Prince says:—
"The earth, that bears thee dead,
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman."
Here I should have introduced the following improvement:
"FaUtaff (raiting hUface, U> tht tmdierut). Don't it, though I"

fair groves, wherein birds sang sweetly, and cooled by runnels qf
bright water, while far off was a prospect qf high hills, in the midst
whereof the two-peaked Parnassus.
Therein, at the opening of the Masque, was discovered Shakspeare seated
on a mossy bank, set with violets, wild thyme, eglantine and musk-roses;
around him a company of the stage Poets qf all countries in their
proper habits, wearing garlands of bays. These were jEschylus,
Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus,
Terence, Calderon, Lote de Vega, Marlowe, Ben Jonson,
Webster, Ford, Peele, Greene, Massinger, Beaumont and
Fletcher, Racine, Corneille, Moliere, Congreve, Van-
bruoh, Farquhar, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Goethe, Schiller,
Scribe, Talfourd, Knowles, and many others. .
They gathered in ranks before Shakspeare, and presented him with this
HYMN.
(Full Chorus.)
Hail! thou in whom the several graces join
Of us who stirred men's reverence, griefs or joys;
Our best brain-metal minting into coin,
Gold, silver, iron, brass, and their alloys;
* If our readers ask why our Stage-directions are in the past tense, all we can say
Is, that so were Rare Ben Jonsos's in his Masques; and as Elizabethan is the word,
we follow the fashion.
Thy brain a continent all mines containing,
That breeds all metals without waste or waning,
Red gold, pale silver, brave brass, iron strong—
And, mixed these noblest elements among,
The dross of word-play, quip and crank and rhyme—
The rude and heavy matrix of thy time—
The ore wherein thy bedded metal lay,
As diamond in rock, or gold in clay.
We great in one, thou great in every, sort!
For terror, mastering our tragic masters;
For mirth, beyond our chief lords of disport;
Microcosm, rounding life's joys and disasters;
A central eye that sun-like looks on all.
And wakens life where'er it chance to fall!
Our master Shakspeare! At thy feet adown
We bow the heads, before which others how;
And offer thee of all our crowns a crown,
And Lords ourselves, thee for our Lord avow!
[Here they bowed reverently, and laid their crowns qf bays
before Shakspeare, who smiled graciously, but with a
pleasant gesture waived their reverence.

Shakspeare. But why to-day of all days t Here have I been these
three hundred years, and have fared well enough with no such music,
and no such moppings and mowings, and no crowns neither, but this
bald one that tiles in mine own brain-pan. That never yet felt lack of
the bays. Heaven be thanked, that gave me an easy mind, and other
gear to think of than mine own greatness!

Ben Jonson. What gear; Will P—what gear?
Shakspeare. My plays and my parts, and my shares and my player
fellows, first, Master Bun,—thou knowest there was enough there for
the best brain to carry, without thinking of what was to come, when
the play was over, the traverses drawn, the dresses locked up in the
tiring-room, and the players put away with their bravery, for the worms
to work their will or the one, as the moths of the other. And then,
when I was well rid of London and the Court, the Globe and Black-
friars, Bank-Side and the Bear-Garden, the play-writers and players—
Heaven be thanked for that latter quittance!—and came back to mine
own Stratford, had I not my beeves and my wheat, my malt and my
wool, my crofts and my croppings to see to, New-Place to order, my
wenches to guide and marry, my friends and neighbours to help and make
merry withal ?—to say nothing of the two plays by the year—a plague
on them !—that Heminge and Burbage would still have of me? Nay,
I had enough to do, I promise you, without gauging mine own great-
ness; and, an I had had leisure, what profit m putting it to such use?
Since when was greatness the greater for taking thought about it?
Ben Jonson. Ah, thou wert always a scatterbrain; careless of the
file; and wouldst let what knave pleased mar thy verses with ill-
printing. But as thou wert, thou wert worth us all, brave heart—ay,
were we ten times counted. Here, take my crown—I had not been so
ready to give it thee, in the^days we clinked cans at the "Mermaid."—
Take it, prythee.
Marlowe. And mine! There's blood on it . . . but you'll pardon
that ...
Ooethe. And mine!
Marlowe. Yours, Master Goethe ! '. . . {Here he looked angry, and
laid his hand on his dagger-haft.) There was a Fausltts, I would have you
remember, before the Court Theatre of Weimar was thought of . . .
Shakspeare. Nay (here he interposed, smiling), an it come to stealing,
let who will guard his crown ... I was an arrant thief ever, from the
days 1 stole worshipful Sir Thomas Lucy's deer, down to my latter
end—Apollo pardon me!—that I pillaged Master. North his Plutarch
for my Roman plays. ... So if every man must to his own again,
take my bays among you.
[Uere he took off hit crown, as if about to throw it among them.
All. Nay . . . nay! Not yours to us, but ours to you!
I Here they offered their crowns again, which Shakspeare put from
him with courteous gesture. As they entreated and he resisted,
came in Master Yvvcn,habited as a Mercury, Us baton wreathed
with serpents for a caduceus, wings on his hump, before and
behind, and his cap furnished with wings for apetasus.
Punch. Roo-too-it! Great news! Glorious news!! Second, edi-
tion!!! Great news! Glorious news!!

his habit, but his nose is Roman, or, by 'r lady, Rabelaisian rather, and
for his figure . . .

of infinite jest, of most rare fancy . . .

[Here he paused, and put his fingers to his nose . . . which perceiving,
Ben Jonson chid him angrily.
Ben Jonson. You filthy knave, know you no reverence?
[Whereon Master Punch took a sight at Rare Ben, and then his
face settled into gravity} and he put off his cap and bells, and
laid it reverently, with his bdton, at the feet qf Shakspeare.
Punch. Great news, oh mighty Master . . . from the upper«worId,
and all about you I
Shakspeare. About me! Have the Germans ceased to find mare's
nests in my plays?
Punch. Certainly not. They are as great in that quest as ever, and
are training Enghsh hunters to the same game, as Sussex peasants
train truffle-dogs.
Shakspeare. I am sorry for it. A little more good acting of my plays,
and less idle writing about them, were more Germane to the matter.
Punch. But less German!
Goethe. Nay. Master . . . one word for my countrymen . . .
Shakspeare. Too many German words, methinks, Master Goethe,
already. [Then he turned to Master Punch.] But your news?
Punch. England has discovered how great a wit it has in you . . .
Shakspeare. Umph! If it have taken England three hundred years
to do that . . .
Punch. Better late than never. Your countrymen—with the excep-
tion of Dean Close—are bent on honouring your memory, on this the
three-hundredth anniversary of your birth.
Shakspeare. But why the three-hundredth, more than the two hun-
dred and ninety and ninth, Master Punch? Why this year more than
any of the three hundred, for that matter?
Punch. That I cannot say.
Shakspeare. I had not discovered that my country's love was lacking
to me. But it were churlish to spurn honest respect, so they show it
fitly. Are they about to act my plays more than they have done?
Punch. On the contrary, many of those who are engaged in doing
you honour cry out on plays, count players Sons of Belial,
the stage as the ante-chamber to Tophet.
Shakspeare. Methinks I could well spare such worshippers,
you do still act my plays among you?
Punch. When they can be made the pedestal for an actor's vanity, or
the pretext for a manager's sensation-scene, the peg whereon to hang a
fine show, or the field tor fighting a big battle.
Shakspeare. Is it even so! At the Globe and Blackfriars I could
draw the Court—and the groundlings too—to my tragedies, comedies,
and histories, with a scurvy wardrobe, a ragged curtain, and a half-dozen
battered foils. But for your actors ... the Burbages and Taylobs
of your day ... are they that act my parts still followed?
Punch. If they be French, and fashionable.
Shakspeare. French? Your Monsieur did not use to speak onr
tongue t
Punch. Nor does he now. But John Bull is content to take hia
stage-English broken—nay, seems to love pour music best when ground
out by a French organ.
S/uiispeare. Out on it! li this be honouring of me! But what say
the English actors to such intrusion from over-sea?
Punch. The big ones refuse to march in French company: the little
ones, who must act to eat . . . eat, like your own Pistol, "eat and eke
swear."
Shakspeare. And so are the players by the ears! Said I not well?
They had better have left me quiet.
Punch. But your worship must look beyond the theatre. It is not
there the reverence for Shakspeare is to be found now-a-days. It is
our men of letters who have combined to pay you'
Shakspeare. And how do they pay it?
Punch. Even by quarrelling like the actors. . . . Seven cities con-
tended for the honour of Homer's birth: two fight over the honouring
of Shakspeare's memory—London and Stratford. Neither Committee
has yet done much, it is true: but they have got strings of great names
together, and abused each other, that it would do you good to hear
them. All through the length and breadth of merry England your
memory is to be drunk at dinners ...
Shakspeare. "A custom,—more honoured in the breach than the
observance." Go on—
Punch. Celebrated in entertainments . . .
Shakspeare. Over which the actors go to loggerheads, and the con-
trivers fall to fisticuffs. What next P
Punch. Recorded in monuments ...
Shakspeare. A " fixed figure for the hand of scorn to point his slow
unmoving finger at!" Continue. Beyond this lowest deep what
lower deep?
Punch. You are to be immortalised uTan ode by Martin Farouhar
Tupper!
[Here Shakspeare shuddered, and straightway fell into a swottnd;
the poets groaned, and covered their faces with their hands; an
earthquake shook Parnassus, whose peaks were seen to collapse
as if in an inward agony; Mastek Punch stood melancholy,
but unshaken.
And so Ended the Masque.

Hear the Bishop of London, on the Judgment of the Privy
Council and the Oxford Declaration:—
"We find that even youtu; Clergymen in tne first year of their ministry have
been appealed to 'for the lovo of God' to protest against the decisions of the highest
authority in Church and State, and some uncharitable and unchristian sentiments
have been published in the heat of controversy.
41 Wise men always deprecate such timos of agitation. Leaders of questionable
orthodoxy are apt to put themselves forward, and have their own serious faults
condoned as the reward of their zeal for the protest of the hour."
Dr. Pusey and Archdeacon Denison are respectfully recom-
mended, each of them, to put that in his pipe and smoke it.

LOGIC AND LIFE ASSURANCE.
At a late Meeting of the Institute of Actuaries, a
Paper on the Government Annuities Bill, commending it
as a whole, was read by Mr. M. N. Abler, of the Alliance
Assurance Company, a gentleman who may be supposed
to have known something of what he was talking about.
Another gentleman, a Ma. Hodge, said:—
"He objected to the Bill on the broad principle that the Govern-
ment had no right to interfere in such mattere. . . . Life Aasu-
rance waa aa much a buainoas aa brewing, or any other industrial
occupation; and he contended that, although Friendly Societies
worked badly, Government had no right to take their business upon 1
ita hand8, any more than to turn brewera because bad beer was
brewed."
Ms, Hodge also made the assertion that :—
"Aa a rule working men were not provident, and they oould not
be made so by Act of Parliament."
Then, Ms. Hodge, they will not insure in the Govern-
ment Assurance Office: and if so, how will Government
interfere with the business of Life Assurance P Does not
your confident argument, Mr. Hodge, against the mea-
sure proposed by Mr. Gladstone, evince the specialty
of personal assurance rather than that of knowledge about
any other? You cannot, at any rate, insure contradictory
premises against leading to opposite conclusions.

thology—the Gorgons settled down in a small fishing village,
subsequently called Gorgona, and gave themselves up to
the pleasant manufacture of the Celebrated Anchovies.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PAKLIAMENT.
April 25th, Monday. On the previous Saturday, birthday of the divine
Williams, certain working men met at Primrose Hill, to see Mr.
Phelps, the tragedian, confirm the plantation of an oak which had been
taken from another part of the Park, and which was set up in its new
locality in honour of
"The rock, the Oak not to bo wind-shaken."—Coriotanus.
This having been done, and some verses by Miss Eliza Cook having
been delivered by Dr. Westland Marston, and some water from the
Avon having been splashed over the tree, and the people, according to
the Committee, having proceeded to push and poke and pat the tree, in
order to promote its growth, the Divine Williams was dismissed, and
another meeting was held. This was a meeting of wrath. It was
intended to signify the disapprobation of one Beales, a revising barris-
ter, and some other folk, at Garibaldi's having taken the liberty to go
away to Caprera sooner than was expected. But, unluckily, general
instructions have been left with the police to the effect that as the
Parks are places for recreation, party meetings are not to be held there.
So, a policeman intimated to the discontented Beales that he must not
spout there. The hint was followed up by the approach of a strongish
body of Peelers, and the anti-GARlBALDi demonstration was somewhat
promptly abbreviated. To-night, Sir George Grey, being inter-
rogated on the subject, said that he had known nothing about the
Garibaldi meeting—thought that, under the circumstances, Beales
& Co. might have been allowed to say out their say, but that as a rule
the Parks were not to be used for such purposes. Considering that the
other Park was rendered inaccessible to the public the other day by
reason of a furious fight between the Catholics and the Garibaldians,
quiet folk have a right to request that folks will do their politics some-
where else. But the Primrose Hill grievance will be worked for some
time to come.
The House sat late, but the only measure of interest was one for
reforming the Irish Court of Chancery, which is said to be a horrible
Augeean stable. Resistance is made to the Bill, and it is thought that
to that peculiar invention, the Irish mind, there is something rather
plazing in the old Chancery system, that always works by fits and
starts, never quite finishes anything, "depends" so much upon
extraneous aid, and usually comes to an abrupt halt for want of means.
The new plan is to get rid of the Taxing Masters, to create a Vice-
Cbancellor and two Chief Clerks, and to assimilate the practice to that
of England.
Tuesday. Sir Cannibal Tattoo gives us a deal of trouble. To-night
long speeches were made about the war in New Zealand, and as to
the way we ought to treat the natives. The fact is, that we are in a
false position, and must make the best of it. The New Zealanders have
found out that a small nation of savages must be gradually improved
off the face of the earth by the settlement of white men in the territory,
and instead of accepting the situation and resigning themselves to then-
fate, which we would make as easy as we could for them, if they would
only be quiet, they revolt, as we call it, and propose to expel us. As
this, of course, is flying in the face of Civilisation and Progress, they at
once become outlaws and criminals, and in the interest of humanity we
must bring them to a proper sense of things. The colonists are for
doing things very abruptly, and have passed a strong Confiscation Bill,
and our gallant soldiers are doing their best to enlighten the New-
Zealand mind. The falsity of our position will be rectified in a few
years by the absence of ail who should challenge it, but those who
know the progress of this colony will not paint its early history in very
glowing colours.
Mr. Lindsay again asks for Harbours of Refuge. Sir Stafford
Northcote proposes that they should be paid for by Tolls on Shipping,
so the mercantile interest knows what to expect from Lord Derby's
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The House rejected both propositions,
and it is alleged that such harbours would simply be places of refuge
for "inferior shipping" whose interests the nation ought not to be
called on to protect. We do not think the argument adamantine, but
the country will not pay for more harbours, ,and is grateful for any
colourable plea in support of its resolution.

[Mat 7, 1864.
Wednesday. Mr. Newdegate tried to pass a Bill for arranging the
Church-rate question. He had taken a good deal of pains with it, and
was quite in earnest in endeavouring to settle the business, but he
could get but CO adherents, and 160 Members voted against him.
Sib J. Hay, who says that the Scotch people prefer notes to gold,
had a Bill for enabling them to have more notes, but it was opposed by
Mr. Black, and by Mr. Gladstone, who enunciated a golden rale of
Sir Robert Peel's, which we shall quote, as we have heard little of
currency wisdom lately. "Issue ought to be the subiect of strict
regulation by the State, bat the business of banking should be perfectly
free, and depend absolutely on the principle of competition." Floored,
as by a cannon-ball, the dead Bill was dragged out of the House, like a
slain gladiator, by the heels.
Then, as if to remind the world that one Sir Robert Peel is not
the other, the existing Pebl delivered a speech which was certainly
the most comic thing Punch has heard. On a discussion touching
the Irish Police, Captain Arch d all accused them of poaching when
they.had a chance. Answered Sir Robert, old Sir Robert's sob,
"He would put it to hon. Members if they had not all of them mado
game in wild parts of the country (Uiuf/iter). He confessed he had himself, when a
boy, poached (loud lauglutr); and they were at this moment engaged in the cele-
bration of the Tercentenary of Sitakspeare, who was himself a poacher."
The great practical joke of keeping Sir Robert Peel in a Ministry
is the grandest thing that even Lord Palmerston ever perpetrated.
Talk of Calioula, who made his horse a Consul!
Thursday. The Lords passed a Bill for inflicting the punishment of
whipping in the case of certain miscreants. Lord Gret giving the
Judges another severe reprimand. The Bill for giving a canonry to the
Greek Professor at Oxford was read a Second Time, Lord Derby
stating that it was generally approved by the University. Of course
it is, but what can the University do against a rush of frantic country
parsons, who stick in the mud of isolation and bigotry, gaining no new
ideas, and scarcely rubbing up their old ones, and who suddenly hear a
cry of " Orthodoxy, clubs! clubs!" and hurry into Oxford, all pre-
judice and perspiration, to defeat the real University. Punch thinks
that there ought, on such occasions, to be Examining Chaplains, who
should be put at the last station but one on the railway, and who
should be empowered to ascertain whether the reverend voter under-
stands the question he is coming to vote upon, and if, as is most
probable, he does not, he should be remitted to his parish to snarl at
his Dissenters and string his platitudes for Sunday.
The Commons had a delightful evening over the Tuscaloosa. This
was the Conrad, Federal vessel, taken by the pirate Alabama, and pre-
tended to be converted from a priie into a Confederate vessel of war.
We let her sto once, and the second time detained her, but then let her
go again. The Conservatives, who ate nearly all on t he Confederate
side, and who, if they were in office, would recognise the South, and
have us at war with the Federals in a fortnight, let off a quantity of
indignation about the wickedness of our Government in even detaining
the Tuscaloosa. Considering thai the Alabama herself escaped from
England by a disgraceful trick, which would perfectly warrant our
setting her if we got a chance, the coolness of complaining that we
inquire into the character of her captures is "rather rich." By 219 to
1S5 the Commons declined making cause with the Confederate
partisans.
Friday. But itis quite clear-that Lord Derby does not intend to try
for office. No man who expected to be hampered with the responsibility
of administration, would have delivered himself of the speech let off
to-night by the leader of the Opposition. It was about the Seizure of
the Steam Rams at Liverpool, and, clever as are many of our lawyers,
there is not oae of them whom .Messrs. Laird could have retained,
who could have made a cleverer address for his client, or one which
savoured less of the legislator and possible adviser of the Crown. Lord
Palmerston would as soon have thought of delivering such a speech,
when he was supposed to be looking to office, as of challenging the
speaker to a game at leap-frog. The Lords enjoyed the clever display,
and then Lord Russell quietly tore the argument into ribbons.
The Commons were informed that the Conference had been adjourned,
and even the Home Secretary did not know when it would meet
again. Hum! ha!
A Committee was' appointed to consider the very hard case of
Mb. Bewicks, who was entrapped into firms a pistol over the heads
of some rascally sheriff's officers, and was imprisoned and ruined in
consequence. The case is one of those exceptionally hard ones which
seem to demand consideration.
Mr. Digby Seymour very properly called attention to the
violation of the Act for prohibiting the sending littl
chimneys. The cruelties of the system ate too loathsome to be dwelt
upon. Sentimental and pious ladies prefer subscribing to societies for
converting little Hottentots to using influence to suppress these
atrocities committed upon white little children at home. Yet Lord
Shaftesbury is interested in the question—if the Exeter Hall ladies
do not care much about the children, they will surely listen to that
serious nobleman. Interference is promised.

A BEGGING LETTER FROM A BLUECOAT BOY.
Please, Sir, Mr. Punch.
will you just go in and
have a shy at our old Go-
vernors, and make them
change our togs and dress
like other fellows, and not
go about like girls in those
old stupid stuffy gowns,
which stick so to our legs
that we have to tuok 'era
up whenever we play foot-
ball, and as for ny-the-
gartcr, we never can play
thai, for if you try it with
a gown on, you arc safe
to come to grief. And
then in summer time you
know our gowns are
beastly hot and heavy,
and cling about one so that of course one can't play cricket, even if we
had a playground big enough to play it in, which you know we haven't,
or you wouldn't see so many of us staring through the railings and
looking awful wretched, when you pass our school.
1 remember you once made a sketch of one of us in Crinoline, which
you thought the Governors perhaps would recommend for us, if they
meant that we should dress more in the style of modern fashions, and
not be togged out in the uniform of centuries ago. I think if we wore
Crinoline, our gowns would look so foolish that the Governors would
let us take to wearing coats and jackets the same as other fellows, and
then perhaps we might leave off those bands, which make us look like
sucking parsons, and those beastly yellow stockings which we all of us
so hate. Fellows who know Shakspeare say he makes a chap in some
play make a big fool of himself by wearing yellow stockings, and as soon
as I know Greek I mean to hunt that passage up and turn it into
jambics, and send it as a Valentine for our Governors to see. There
was a story out last Christmas that they meant to change our dress, but
all they've done has been to give us black serge knickerbockers instead
of our old corduroy knee-breeches, and they haven't even changed the
colour of our stockings, which at least they might have done. Juvenal
says that poverty makes chaps look ridiculous, and if he had but
seen our gowns and yellow stockings, I'm sure he would have said that
charity does the same.
You know they call our big boys " Grecians ;" and if they'd let 'em
dress like Greeks, they'd look much better than they do. Greek
fellows wear petticoats, but these ain't half so bad as gowns, for they
are ever so much shorter and don't drag so at your knees. If we were
togged like Greeks we should not look a bit more un-English than we
now do, and a Greek costume is ever so much handsomer than ours is.
Besides, our Grecians would wear caps if they were drest like Greeks;
and that would be a comfort, if but to keep one's head clean. One
don't a bit mind going with one's head bare in the country; but one sees
such dust and smuts in London that one wants to have it covered;
though I don't quite know but what I'd rather go bareheaded than
wear those beastly chimney-pots the Eton fellows do.
So please, now, Mr. Punch, do just poke up our old Governors, and
make them let us dress like Christians; and if you put this letter in,
you must print some extra copies, for I mean to buy a couple, one to
send to our head-master and one to keep myself. So believe me your
affectionate young friend, Augustus Blobbs.
P.S. Couldn't you make a picture of one of our old Governors
out in our school uniform, and trying to play leapfrog, and so
tripped up by his gown and coming whack upon his nose? If you
could, it would be prime fun; only mind and make him ugly, and with
awful skinny legs.
P.S. You ought to have a coloured drawing of him, so as to show his
yellow stockings: and if you make him tumbling down, he should have
a bloody nose and a jolly good black eye.

Not Mr. Flower, Mayor of Stratford-on-Avon, on the Tercentenary

HORRIBLEJ)UTRAGE BY HEBREWS.
Really, Messrs. Noses & Sun fand if the sun burns your noses, we
can't help it), this is coming it a little—well, shall we be elegant, like
your costhumeth, and say this is going "the whole hogP" Punch
would not have ventured on such a similitude for the world, for polite-
ness is his essence and nature, but you began it. Very properly taking
advantage of the Shakspeariomania to give yourselves a good puff, you
have issued a not ill-written pamphlet, in which the poet's mention of
various articles of dress is made to lead up to the usual statements in
reference to your toggery warehouses. But your author has the indis-
cretion to promulgate his and your anti-Christian feelings in a way
which is really too much for us, addicted as we are to bacon at break-
fast. Speaking of Shaxspeare's name, you say :—
"what's in a name ?—a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"—but the
world does see something in a name, and would be sorry to designate so imperial a
genius as Shakspeare, by an insignificant or vulgar cognomen, such, for instance,
as Mb. Fio, Mb. HoGaPLfsu, or Mr. Dishclodt." .
Well, Shakspeare might have been called Moses, and even then we
should have admired his works. But what do you mean by vulgar
names? Did you never hear of Lord Bacon, or of Hogg the Ettnck
Shepherd, or of Ham in David Copperfield? But this is not your point.
You wish to display your bigoted hatred to us oppressed Christians,
and we won't stand it. You leave Shakspeare alone. He never took
much pains to say anything for you. With his fine art, he humanised
Shylock, in order to make his avarice and cruelty come out more
strongly, but W. S. hasn't a good word for you in any of his plays, and
if he never said anything about Moses, he took it out in Aaron.
There's nothing vulgar in "Pig," or " Hogsflesh" either, and if he had
been called "Dishclout," the Commentators would have shown in the
clearest manner that it was a corruption of Daiscloth, or the embroi-.
dered cloth laid on the dais, or place of honour, and that he was de-
scended from Edward the Fourth's upholsterer, Sir Amour (or
hammer) de Daisclothe. We are frizzling in far too furious a manner,
at your insult to Swine, to descend to argument, but we beg to inform
you that in seeking to depreciate the most delightful of our meats, you
have got the wrong Pig by the Tail, and your intolerance shows how
unlit you are to enjoy the toleration conferred on you, in a

WHAT TOBY THOUGHT AT THE DOOR OF THE
CONFERENCE-ROOM.
Tory sits by the Conference-ioom,
The Vehm-Gericht of diplomatists' doom.
Toby sniffs at what runs on the floor,
Prom the chink below the Conference-door.
Toby doesn't know what to think:
It looks like blood, but he hopes 'tis ink.
Toby listens, with ears on the watch
The bland diplomatists' whispers to catch,
And the pointed pens that the foolscap scratch—
But somehow Toby cannot hear,
Such horrible sounds are in his ear.
Of booming cannon and bursting shells
On the Schleswig fiords and the Schleswig fells;
And the groans of the wounded, left to die j
And the wail of the houseless, forced to fly;
And the low of the cattle whose byre is burning;
And the mother's cradle-song changed to mourning:
For a shell that goes up must needs come down,
And 'tis hap-hazard work bombarding a town,
And sei and age are all one to a splinter,
And 'tis ill-bivouacking in Schleswig-winter.
And Toby thinks—of the party in there,
Each in his gilt and cushioned chair,
With voices so soft and smiles so bland,
And never a stain on ever a hand,—
And wonders what wool they have in their ears,
That prevents their hearing the sounds he hears;
For if they heard, they never could sit
So smooth of speech, and prompt of wit,
Devising puzzles of war and peace,
Nor bidding that hell of sounds to cease.
And looking more close at the wet on the floor,
That oozes and oozes under the door,
Toby sees, as it soaks in the wood.
That the stain is not of ink, but blood;
Por blood may by diplomate pens be shed;
And by protocols more than by bullets are sped;
And they that are strong to save, yet stand,
With half of a heart, and a hesitant hand,
When the tiger springs on his helpless prey,
The tiger kills not more than they.—
And Toby thought about German culture,
And that, if man will play the vulture,
Ere vulture's folly he imitate,
'Twere well to remember vulture's fate;
Por vultures, when their feast they find,
Will gorge themselves both deaf and blind,
Till the wings are weak to lift the paunch
Prom its carrion perch on scull or haunch,
And, helpless alike to fight or fly,
They 're knocked o' the head by some sportsman sly,
Whose skill in cooking,—ce n'est pas peu,—
Can turn e'en vulture to pot-au-feu.
More Celebrations.
Another Tercentenary is announced—this time by the Serious
World. Calvin died in 1564—just three hundred years ago. Now
here is a celebration that may be said to be wanted, at least if the
memory of Calvin is to be preserved at all, as sensible people are
rather inclining to forget Calvin and a good deal that he taught. The
affair may be made verv effective, as fireworks can appropriately be
employed to an unlimited extent, and the affair may end with a splendid
reef fire business of Calvin burning Servetus for heresy in 1533.
Could not some arrangement be made for an amalgamation of the
Calvin and Guy Fawkes festivals?
A Nigger Nut to Crack.
Lookee yar you, Massa Bones, can yer gib dis child an answer to

ARISTOGYMNASTICS.
"The Countess dk G"*"* will have a dance in Carlton Gardens on the <Jth."
So says the Post, and we do not see the slightest reason why a lady
who is, we hope and suppose, in the full enjoyment of health and animal
spirits, should not treat herself to a little dance round the gardens of
her residence. We trust that old WATBRmGPOTTS, the gardener, will
take care to have the walks properly swept from leaves, and if there arc
many slugs, he must throw them into the next garden. He has been
spoken to once or twice about that heap of litter near the rolling-stone,
and we are sure it will not be necessary to mention it again. The lady^s
maid must and will be in attendance with a shawl, as, after exercise in
the open air, a chill is undesirable. We trust that the Countess de
q»»*» w^ enj0y ner uttle dance round the garden; and if she likes to
take a skipping-rope, by way of change, we see no objection. As we
are appealed to by the publication of the paragraph, common politeness
compels us to say that we strongly approve of ladies taking al fresco
amusement.

ERECTED TO THE MEMORY
or
THE LONDON NATIONAL TERCENTENARY
COMMITTEE,
APRIL 23, 1864,
BY THEIR FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR,
MR. PUNCH.
WHO SHOULD PAY THE BOXKEEPERS P
A Correspondent of a penny paper complains, that at some theatres
the boxkeepers, instead of being hired by the management, have actually
to pay three shillings nightly for their places. Of course this naturally
mates them importunate for fees, and greatly fosters the delusion under
which they mostly labour, that by virtue, or by vice rather, of their
situation, they are privileged to plague people until what they call "the
time-honoured shilling" fee be paid.
Now this "time-honoured shilling" custom is a custom honoured
more in the breach than the observance: and, like many another old
time-honoured custom, should, for the public comfort's sake, be swept
away forthwith. Not that we would rob a poor boxkeeper of his beer,
or of the shillings that he buys it with; but the shillings, we would
say, should be paid by the managers, and should not be extorted* from
the pockets of the public. If managers pretend that they charge so low
for seats that they cannot pay for servants to show the public into
them, let the prices be so raised that the boxkeepers may be paid out
of the higher sums received. But this, we apprehend, there will be
found small need for doing. Many a person is deterred from going
often to a theatre by the dread of being plagued and pestered by a
boxkeeper; and were this fear removed, doubtless playgoers would
increase, for anything that tends to the comfort of the audience must
surely tend to draw more people to the house. Moreover, man may do
what man has done, and managers may do what managers have done.
To his honour, be it said, that Mr. Webster was the first to do away
with the old system, and Mr. Fechter has been wise enough to follow
his good lead. At the Adelphi and Lyceum you are shown into your
seat by the civillest of attendants, who hand you a neat] playbill, and
are forbidden by the management to take a fec\ for doing so. The con-
sequence of this is, you are in the best of tempers when yon seUle in
your seat, and are in a thorough humour to enjoy the play; whereas it',
when you enter, you are pestered for a shilling which you view as an
extortion, and grumble if you pay, you take your seat, prepared to
growl all through the evening, and to grab at any pretext for getting up
a hiss.
Feeling sure that fees to boxkeepers are hated by the public. Punch
will gladly use his influence to stop them, and will most willingly make
known to an applauding universe the name of any manager who has the
good sense to distribute playbills gratis, to allow no fees to boxkeepers,
and thereby to attract the public to Iiis house.
A BREAK-DOWN IN THE ORCHESTRA.

"A CLASSICAL TERCENTENARY CELEBRATION,
** To the Editor of * The OreAofra.'
"Sir,—A* the Tercentenary of Shakspeare's birth Is now close at hand, it may
interest some of your readers to know how the Greeks and Romans did honour to
the memory of the illustrious dead. Aschylds,1 the frraaisatof their tragedians,
furnishes the best illustration. lie was killed, as is well known, as the Battle of
Marathon,11 b o 490, and was therefore regarded as a hero and martyr, as well as a
poet. The tercentenary * of his death thus fell during the brief sovereignty of
Cassaxpsb,* who resolved to hold a celebration of unusual pomp. The Nsmean
Games,* which, owing to the troubled condition of the country, had been discon-
tinued for some years, were revived, and a solemn procession was organised in the
usual manner, consisting first of girls bearing baskets (canephorn "). youths riding
on horseback, and bacchantes with thyrsi, concluding with the bust of the great
dramatist. Sacrifices were offered and libations poured to Apollo and the Muses-
Then followed the chariot and horse-races, and the jxntathlon, or contests in wrest,
ling, running, boxing, and throwing the quoit. The proceedings, which lasted five
days, terminated by the performance, Jn the theatre, of the Prometheus and Aga-
memnon, after which an ode was recited, composed expressly for the occasion.
The author's name is unknown, but Pausanias7 tells us that Horaos has copied
this ods in the opening of his ' Carmen Stoculare ';' • as the original, however, has
unfortunately perished, we cannot tell if this is the case.
"Any of your readers who may wish to learn more on this subject, and to com-
pare our modern manners and customs with those of the ancients, will find full
particulars in the tith volume of the Leipslc series of * Byzantine Historians,'*
where, at page 274, is a valuable fragment of Evagricb,1* giving a full account of
the ceremonies used. A briefer but very spirited narrative will also be found in
the 2nd volume of Oaju. Muller's ' Dorians,' 11 tub voce ' Nsmean Games.'

So much for a successful experiment on the stupidity of the Orchestra.
The editor of that severely critical publication will in future think twice,
perhaps, before he accuses of want of education gentlemen who may
hare at least learned enough at school to constitute him the victim of the
foregoing hoax.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HINT FROM HAMLET PRINCE OF DENMARK.
Let the King op Prussia, who approves of the policy-
signalised in the bombardment of Sonderborg, and the
slaughter of women and children, as well as soldiers, make
a note of the circumstance thus stated by the Times' Cor-
respondent with the Danish army :—
1' A poor soldier passed tinder our windows, both whoso legs bad
been shot away, and the anguish of hiB writhing stumps wrung from
him heartrending screams not to be forgotten by anv one who heard
them, an unusual occurrence among these enduring Northerner*, who
fur the most part die without a groan."
Suakspeare, apropos of Danes, makes Laertes in Hamlet
say to the priest who superintends the "maimed rites" of
Ophelia's burial:—
"I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
Whilst thou best howling."
Has his Majesty of Prussia any conception of what the
Poet ot this world and the next means hy "howling" in
the foregoing passage? If he has he must experience
qualms. Whom does King William suppose to be, in
the first instance responsible for the anguish of the
"writhing stumps" of that poor soldier whose legs were
shot off by Prussian artillery? Doubtless the " heartrend-
ing screams" which that poor fellow's torments "wrung
from him," will never " be forgotten by any one who heard
them." The hearers of them, were not, perhaps, limited to
the Times' Correspondent, and other persons within the
radius of a mile. Doe3 the King of Prussia know to
what ears blood wantonly and cruelly shed crieth from the
ground? Has he no fear that the screams of that tortured
Dane, and other tortured Danes, were loud enough to reach
them? Then let him lay his head on his pillow, and sleep
in peace.

FIRST OF MAY.-THE RIVALS.
TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
Snts, I was walking down St. James's Street, observant: from afar
off, I noted a gentleman walking towards me, with whom I have more
than a slight acquaintance. "Now," said I unto myself, " here comes
one who will have something to say for himself,—one who, as Falstaff
hath it, will'Talk wisely, and in the street, too;' whose senses will not
be scattered before the breath of my salutation, like chaff before the
wind." I knew him to be a careful student of his Punch; and at a
recent dinner-party he had entertained me with his highly instructive
and interesting conversation. Intending that my own form of saluta-
tion, and his direct answer to it, should be a model for all passers-by,
I stopped him, and greeted him m a loud tone, thus:—
"Ah! my dear Mister Guzzle! How do you do?"
To which he should have replied,
"Quite well," or "Ear from well, I thank you, my dear Mister
Peripatetic."
But, alas! for this great creature—this man of science—this brilliant
dinner-conversationalist!—he was—how can I express it?—he was
flabbergasted! I am not sure of the exact meaning of the word, but
I am interiorly convinced of its sense, and do here affirm that if ever a
man teas flabbergasted, Guzzle was that flabbergasted individual.
He said, with an idiotic smile, too, that meant nothing, "Ah! How
d'ye do?"
Oh, contemptible Conventionalism! enchaining even the spirits most
impatient of control! I pitied, and gave him another chance—
Thank you," said I, with much emphasis, "/ am very well."
This method, you will observe, was adopted by me, in order to show
him, that, though his question, coming, as it did, in the second place, had
been courteously met, mine, put first, still remained unanswered.
He lost his opportunity: he took no heed of the opening thus afforded
to him. It was his turn to speak, so I held my tongue, wisely, and my
breath, anxiously. The words came at last—
"Well,", said he, "how do these East winds suit you, eh?"
Oh, heavens! Had I not already told him that I was Quite Well?
If it had aoi been so, why should I have lied unto him? If the East winds
had done me injury, I should, in my answer to his first question, have
made it my theme.
Thus, then, I silenced him; reading him a lesson which I sincerely
Theatrical.

hope he will never forget:—" Sir," I answered, in a Johnsonian style
(my friends tell me that I resemble the great Doctor—specially at
dinner): this by the way. "Sir, had the meteorological" (J can say
this word very effectively, dividing it into well-enunciated syllables),
"had the meteo-ro-logical"—take your meteo short and crisp, ro very
long, finishing up with a very rapid logical, as if your pronouncing
machinery had got wrong, and was running down with a whizzle—" Sir,
had the me'teo-ro-18gIcSl fluctuations of this variable climate in any
degree affected my general state of salubrity" (here I took breath), I
should have made you acquainted with the interesting fact, when reply-
ing satisfactorily" (this word must be given with two /'s, if you 're to
make anything of it at all—thus, satis/ac-torilly) " to the question, which
you have already thought proper to put to me. Sir, you have not given
me any answer to my question, as to the state of your own health; I
must therefore suppose, that, you either have 'no health to speak of,' or
that you consider any inquiry of this kind, upon my part, as an instance
of such unwarrantable curiosity, as has not its parallel in the history of
created man. I regret, Sir, that your disdainful conduct has necessitated
these observations, and I now leave you, trusting that my words may
not be entirely thrown away upon you. Fare you well!"
With that, I, lifting up my hat towards high Heaven, with stately
gait pursued my onward course, and left him quailing where he stood.
Proudly wayfaring, I proceeded Pall-Mallwards. At this point I hide
my face in my hands—I weep bitter tears of humiliation. I have
fallen! Mea culpa! Mea maxima culpa! I fell, in the street; on
that pavement of which I was the strutting Chanticleer!
My fall was moral. In the ears of two sentinels guarding British
Art, m the ears of certain members of the Oxford and Cambridge Club—
not to mention nursery-maids, nondescript loungers, a commissionnaire,
a War Office clerk, and an intelligent policeman, who had overheard
my previous exhortation, and had followed me from St. James's Street,
bent upon instruction—yes! in their hearing I fell with a great ruin,
and, to the honour of their charity, be it spoken, they did not point the
fingers of scorn at me.
I will tell all. To me, conscious of rectitude, there came a jaunty
young fellow, who, by profession, i3 a barrister, but by practice is not.
He seized my hand—" How d' ye do? How d' ye do P How d' ye do?"
said he.
"Ah!" said I, "How are you?"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Hying words! Irrevocable!
Fiendish laughter rang in my ears. I fled—past the sentinels,
through St. James's Park, to the ducks—
"Quack! quack! quack!"
Oh, horrid chorus! cruel imputation! I sped onward,
onwardest.
"Hallo! old fellow!" oried Young Suxwror, in a fast
'* HOW ABB 10V y
Gracious Powers! I had not even a second given to me to frame a
reply. He was gone—gone, perhaps, for ever! and his question still
unanswered. I jumped into a cab, imploring the driver to pursue that
rapid Hansom. 1 was determined that I would retrieve the miserable
past, and answer his question at all hazards. We dashed after him. We
had gone nigh to catch him, when there met us a four-wheeler, with
luggage on the top, likewise being driven furiously. "Hallo!" cries
Doodlb, from within, "How abb tod!"
The answer stuck in my throat, like Amen in Macbeth's. Should I
turn back? No, my bounden duty was to answer in order, beginning
of course with Young Sumwun, who was number one.
And yet—at this moment an omnibus stopped the way. "Ah!" cries
a voice from the knife-board, where Noodle was seated, like a sweet
little cherub aloft, "How are tod?"
I thank my stars! Humbly, heartily,'do I thank my stars, that I
was able to answer him.
"I am far from well, I thank yon, Noodle!" said I, londly, yet
modulating my voice with a bass, as it were, of melancholy.
The omnibus ceased to obstruct our passage, and our conversation
was thus abruptly terminated. I had been permitted to redeem the
past, and as further pursuit of the Hansom would have been expensive,
I paid the Cabman, and hurried to my own sanctum.
do, and bustling out and in again whenever there's a chance. With
Faust upon the stage and Punch between the acts, the Opera would
really be a rational amusement, and for their own sakes we may hope
that Messieurs Gye and Mapleson will act on our kind hint.

AND THE NEW TENOR.
of
have you heard the
late
Engaged to sing by Gib the
Great?
A voico so high, the critics
state,
Has rarely been heard
in this Island.
His name's Wachtel, and
all agree
With ease he singeth a high
chest C,
A note that is far above you
or me,
E'en on our tiptoes tho' we
be,
Some say his tone is hard as
bricks,
And that with soft notes he
plays sad tricks,
But ne'er in his throat the
high C sticks,
So he carries the house
with a high hand.
In speaking of a singer,
it seems only natural to
break into song; so instead
of furnishing a critical ac-
count of the new tenor, which, if written in the style peculiar to critics,
would be completely unintelligible to less instructed readers, we prefer
to say our say of him in this elegant little poem, and Mr. Gtb has our
permission to buy as many copies of it as he pleases, and present them
to each person entering his theatre each evening it is open, until the
season ends.
This suggests to us the notion that Punch is quite as much an
essential thing to have with yon when visiting the Opera, as a white tie
or an opera-glass or a swallow-tailed dress-coat. Only think, dear boy,
what an immense boon it would be to all frequenters of the Opera, were
Punch put in their hands on entering the house! The Swells would
then have something pleasant to amuse themselves withal in the inter-
vals between the acts, and need not moon about the lobbies and saloons
as they now do, seeking feeble recreation in exchanging howd'yedah's,
and perusing the dull telegrams that come up from the House. Besides,
if every one had Punch to read between the acts, people in the stalls
perhaps would sit still in their seats until the Opera was over, and
would not worry other people by treading on their toes, or whisking
their big flounces en passant m their face. This is the usual nuisance
now at the end of every act, and, of course, if folk were properly intent
upon their Punch, they would not be jumping up and down as they now
ENGAGEMENT TO MISS PAITHFDLL.
There are many poor girls too good and too noble to marry for
money, fated to meet with no men whom they would be willing to
marry, and who would be willing, and likewise able, to marry them.
Many an excellent girl is there whose face is her fortune, and a fortune
not handsome enough to procure her a husband. Here and there is a
thinking girl, who does not believe in domestic happiness, or any other
in this world, and had rather not marry at all. Her intention is the
same as that expressed by the rustic maiden, who says, in the ballad of
Cupid's Garden:—
"For I means to live a vargoant and still the laurel wear."
Well; she who ever wears the laurel will never wear'the willow, nor
the weeds. But, say that she is portionless, how is she to afford wear-
ing the laurel? There i» no nunnery for her, and if there were one she
would not go into it; would rather pursue her maiden meditation fancy
free; not behind the bars of a grate: would not much prefer a Lady
Superior to a lord and master. Then there is the not perhaps very
exceptional case of the young widow, left destitute, whose affections are
in the other world, and who does not like to constitute herself a second-
hand wife. But how are all these women to live? Their lot is starvation
or industry, and who shall rescue them from the alternative of starva-
tion? Miss Emily Faithtdll will, as many of them as she can employ
in her Print ing-Ollice. She has set up a Pnnting-Office for the express
'purpose of affording women employment, and it has been in operation
now for several years. Not a few girls are there whom, perhaps, lack
of means would enforce to evil, worse evil, if possible, than even mer-
cenary marriage, if they were not supplied with the opportunity of
performing some use by the intelligent benevolence of Miss Faithfull.
For one of various means designed to provide women with work,
Ml6S Faithfull some time ago started the Victoria Magazine, respect-
ing which we extract the subjoined statement from the Daily News of
the 19th ult. :—
"The VlHoria Magawu was established in the spring of 1
intended as a publishing office for it, were opened at No. 14, Prinoes Street, Hanover
Square; but for the purpose of distributing the magazine among the bookselling
trade, and promoting its sale, it has been found desirable to transfer the publishing
department to a wholesale City house, the editing and printing of the Magazine
remaining in Miss Paithfoll's hands. The premises in Princes Street hare been
converted into a bookseller's and stationer's shop, in whioh Miss Faitiubjli. seeks
to promote, both directly and indirectly, the object she has at heart—the employ-
ment of her own ser. This she purposes to do by using, ss far as possible, the
services of female assistants, and by engaging in the various processes oonnected
with the stationery trade—such as book-binding, envelope-making, black-bordering,
stamping from dies, &c.—as much female labour as possible."
Miss Faithfull is entitled to the gratitude not only of her own sex
for her endeavours to afford penniless girls a refuge from famine or
matrimony. She also deserves the thanks of many a young fellow and
old fellow too, who, under infatuation, might make an offer of marriage,
which would be accepted by some girl who did not care about him, it,
in the Printing-Office of the Victoria Magazine, or Miss Faithfull's
shop at 14. Princes Street, Hanover Square, she had not found something
better to do than constituting herself a life-encumbrance to an unhappy
man.
HIGHLY PROPER.
The Churchwardens of a Church in Hull send us the Easter Balance
Sheet of the sacred edifice in Question, and we are very much pleased
with the following item:—
*' Cleaning tho Church, Ac. Washing Surplices, Vergers, Ringers, <fec., £79 2a. 6d."
We are very glad that the Reverend the Vicar and the Churchwardens
wash the vergers and ringers. Such attention to the cleanliness of the
inferior officials is most laudable, and we know to what cleanliness is
next. We have often seen vergers who were far from clean, and ringers
are notoriously beery and dirty. Mr. Punch hopes that the example
of this Hull Church will be followed by the Church of England
generally.

WHY DID GARIBALDI LEAVE SO SOON?
In order to set at rest for ever the above vexed question, which seems
to be perturbing a good many people, and causing them to emit the
most ridiculous guesses and objurgations, Mr. Punch begs to offer, at
one view, all the reasons which induced the gallant Garibaldi to leave
this country without allowing the provincials an opportunity of wringing
his hand off.
1st. Because he will want his hand to plant the banner of Italy on
the fortifications of Venice, and also of Rome.
2nd. Because he heard. that Mb. Tuffeb was coming after him to
recite an Ode in his honour.
3rd. Because Lobd Palmerston begged him to go, lest he might
excite democratic feelings, and thereby cor»pel the Ministry to bring in
a Reform Bill.
4th. Because the most Illustrious Personage believed that he had
designs upon the Crown of England.—N.B. The Prince of Wales's
visittwas for the purpose of requesting him not to stir up a revolution.
5th. Because the National Shakspearian Committee, having concluded
their work, wished:to organise a movement for a Gabibaldi memorial.
6th. Because the younger Gabibaldi had fallen so desperately in
love with a lady member of the Royal family, that it was necessary to
crush that sentiment in the early bud.
7th. Because it was not certain that Mb. Ch arles Kean might not
be coming back suddenly, in which case influence would be used to get
Gabibaldi to see that gentleman in Hamlet.
8th. Because Cabdinal Wiseman had blessed seventeen bludgeons,
and given them to as many stalwart Irishmen, previously absolved,
with orders to demolish Gabibaldi, and give Mr. Seely a great
beating.
9th. Because the Cockneys who insisted on riding in his carriage
spoke such atrocious Hinglish that it grated upon the delicate Italian
organisation, and he was especially annoyed at peing called a Nero of a
nunderd fights and a most magnaninimous Hcxilc.
10th. Because the idiotic British Washerwomen made such exceed-
ingly bad work with his red shirts, starching them in the wrong places,
as they do with the linen of their countrymen.
i 11th. Because he had a telegram announcing that the Pope was
going to send a brigand expedition to Caprera, with orders to eat
Gabibaldi's cook and housekeeper.
12th. Because the Englishwomen bothered his very life out for auto-
graphs, and he had sent away the insides of at least three mattrasses, as
locks of his hair, to the inconsiderate daughters of Albion.
There now! There are a dozen good reasons why he went away, and
I each is as good as the other. We now hope that the subject will be
dropped. ■
A CALL FOR A JEWISH SONG.
The Prussian authorities, under the paternallGovernment of William"
the Fibst, in their treatment of Posen, are emulating those atrocities
which the satraps of the Czab inflict on a larger part of Poland, by
flogging and otherwise torturing the inhabitants, on the most'frivolous
or groundless pretences, with diabolical malice. Amongst other victims,
a Jew was almost beaten to death by Prussian soldiers, "because he
refused to sing a Jewish song." The Israelite might" have complied
with the request of the miscreants in King William's pay, an'd'sungr
them one of the Psalms of David, say the 109th, in/Hebrew, without
any fear that they would have understood it, and comprehended that,
in the mouth of the singer, it was an imprecation of divine vengeance
on a br utal tyrant.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 2nd, Monday. Government has no intention of interfering
between the Irish landlord and the Irish tenant. The present system
seems to work very well; the tenant objects to paying his rent, and the
landlord objects to paying his debts, and the Encumbered Estates
Court and the blunderbuss smooth down any little irregularities which
interfere with general harmony.
Although the Scotch are stated to prefer notes to gold, because the
former are more easily hidden away in the " big Ha* Bible and in vast
snuff-boxes, Mb. Gladstone gives up his plan for increasing the issue
of bank-notes. We suspect, that being a gentleman of refined taste, he
has been shocked at the dreadful dirtiness of the paper sent up as con-
science-money by penitent Scots, and that he Tacks the Vespasian
philosophy.
"A loud and general cheer" followed Lobd Clarence Paget's
statement that the Channel squadron was in the Downs, that the stores
were nearly completed, and that the fleet would be ready to sail any-
where in twenty-four hours.
"All in the Downs the fleet is moored.
The steamers smoking in the wind;
Brave Admiral Dacres is on board.
And hopes a German foe to find.
Tell us, our jovial sailors, tell us true.
Won't you rejoice the Burglars' Ships to view?"
When a young lady wants to be married (and she is quite right to
marry if the young gentleman is old enough to know his own mind,
is cheerful but steady, and reads his Punch), and her lover has no
money except his income, he usually assnres his life, and settles the
amount on her and the probable babies. Would you believe it, young
ladies engaged or only hoping to be, Mr. Gladstone levies a duty on
the document which secures the money? He does; and though 124
nice gentlemen, in the ladies' interest, to-night begged him to take off
the unkind tax, he got 161 horrible curmudgeons and lady haters to
help him to keep it on. And yet that man speaks beautifully at a
wedding-breakfast, gushes like the champagne, and sparkles like the
iced-cake. What a world it is! However, do not let his cruelty pre-
vent your accepting eligible offers. Your husbands will undertake so
many dnties that this little one isn't worth making a fuss about. In
Supply we had a great fight about the Dockyard at Malta, and we
passed the Penal Servitude Act. Thieves at a distance (who may keep
there) will please accept this intimation. No Cards, if they once mis-
behave.
Tuesday. Sir George Grey stated that Austrian ships had arrived
in the Downs, but that the Austrian Government had solemnly declared
that Por The Present, the only order given to the commander was
to protect German commerce in the North Sea, and to prevent the
blockade of the Elbe and the Weser. Our Admiral was watching, but
the Minister declined to say what orders he had in the event of the
Austrians receiving any other orders. This reticence was proper, of
course, and John Bull is an excellent policeman and a strict disci-
plinarian. While folks are off his beat, ne does not touch them, but
just let them come on it.
The Sioux Indians are cruel savages, who murder women and child-
ren, and escape into our territory to avoid the vengeance of the Ameri-
can soldiery. Leave having been asked to pursue them over the
frontier, our Governor at the Red River has of course granted it,
stipulating that the miscreants shall not be extirpated upon the pre-
mises of our settlers. Mr. Hennessy spoke in a tone of remonstrance
on the subject. He probably thought that these savages had the same
claim to tenderness as the cannibal brigands sent out by the Holy See.
So do we, and so does the Colonial Secretary.
Mr. Somes, anti-beerman, stated that he proposed to let public-
houses be open on Sundays from one to two, and from eight to nine.
Mr. Punch proposes to strike out all the words after the first "to," and
for "nine to substitute "eleven." But he is ready to enact that
drunkenness shall not be accepted as an extenuation ot other offences,
but on the contrary, that it shall be separately and severely punished.
Mr. Ewart then brought on a debate on Capital Punishments, and
a very important step was taken in reference to an important subject.
The usual exchange of assertion was made, one party alleging that
hanging was inhuman, and did not prevent crime, the other party de-
claring that it was the only punishment which produced an effect upon
the dangerous classes, and deterred them from crime. Much stress was
laid upon the frequent escape of scoundrels, who would have been
doomed to penal servitude, but whom juries could not agree to hang.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Ma. Bright was glad the House had got rid of the Book of Genesis as
an authority on the subject. Sin George Grey believed that it would
neither be safe, nor in accordance with public feeling, to do away alto-
gether with executions. Mr. Ewart's motion was withdrawn, but a
Royal Commission is to issue, for the purpose of taking evidence as to
the nature and operation of the law, and the manner of the infliction of
the death punishment, and to report whether any alteration is desirable.
Whatever may be the report of this Commission, it is certain that
public opinion demands a graduated scale of punishment, and that
crimes, so different in character and atrocity as those of Wright, the
woman-slayer, and of Palmer, the poisoner, should not be called by
the same indiscriminating name, and treated accordingly.
Sir George Grey makes an attempt to diminish the nuisance of
Night Houses by closing them from one to four in the morning. Those
who "make night hideous" at these disreputable haunt* are not mem-
bers of the humbler class, nor will much suppression be effected until
they are invited to recover from the excitement of their amiable orgies
by spending a eouple of days of calm seclusion, improved by die un-
adorned eloquence of a solitary cell. It would be a pity, by a fine, to
deprive them of the money which they turn to so good an account.
Mr. Bass introduced a meritorious Bill for the better regulation of
street music within the metropolitan district. He proposes to define
for what " reasonable cause" a housekeeper may send away the Italian
pests. We observe that certain metropolitan Members are inclined, for
the sake of mob-popularity, to oppose t his measure. If they do, it will
be for Mr. Punak, in the interest of civilisation, to examine, from time to
time, how far they themselves may be liable to come into the list of
persons to be dismissed for reasonable cause. At present, if one's child
is dying, and a policeman cannot be found (as is nearly certain to be the
case), there is nothing to prevent a scoundrel from grinding a nigger
melody for an hour under the window, and an indignant parent who
shall thrash the vermin away, may be dragged to a police-court on the
day of the funeral.
A Bill for making Little Bankrupts was read a Second Time. It
is for extending the benefit of the bankrupt law to persons committed
by the County Courts. Observe Lord Westbury s Bill, introduced
on the Friday. Considering the uncommonly rough justice adminis-
tered at these places, where the plaintiff is regarded as an injured angel,
and the defendant as a swindling miscreant, something like fair play
should be accorded. On the other hand, some Members think that such
a measure will tend to curtail the credit the humbler class now get from
shopkeepers. If it should ruin the tallyman's trade, every sensible
person will rejoice, and in fact that object should be attained by a more
direct process—that of making it penal in a tallyman to sell anything to
a wife except in the actual presence of the husband. A good many
tallymen would go to gaol for perjury, at first, but. that misfortune
might be endured.
The useful Partnership Amendment Law ought to have made pro-
S^ess, but, after a debate, the House was counted. Mr. Thomas
artng objects to the Bill, and thinks that capitalists might lend
money, without interest, to worthy young men. On reading this, we
immediately sent off a note to Mr. Baring, asking for ten or twelve
thousand pounds on the terms he advocates, but the messenger had
not returned with the money up to our going to press.
Wednesday. Dulness carries it, the Metric System is effectually
opposed, and all that is to be done at present is to legalise contracts in
which the weights or measures mentioned are metric weights and mea-
sures. Dreadful nonsense was talked, and some Members evidently
thought that the metres meant poetical metres, and that Mr. Ewart
wished to compel us to talk over the counter in rhyme—e. g,,
I be recoverable. And there is a dab in the eye for greedy attorneys,
I who are not to bring actions in the Superior Courts for matters which
ought to come before the County Courts, as the sharks now do for the
sake, of course, of extra plunder.
Most unsatisfactory answers in the Commons about the Conference
and the ships, but we screwed out that the Aurora is gone to look after
the Austrians.
A most interesting debate on the Public School System. Yet the
House, which will crowd, and cram, and listen like mice, when any
twopenny personal quarrel or scandal is up, was in a hurry to "cut," as
Ma. Grant Duff said, one of the most important topics. Our Public
School System is being overhauled, and much good will result, as the
various elements which tend to produce manly, self-reliant, governing
men will be purified from the brutalities and corruptions that have been
fostered by prejudice and bigotry. Mr. Grant Dttff spoke up for the
modern languages and lighter accomplishments, and Mr. Gladstone,
as became an Oxonian, admitted their value, bat could not allow them
to be named wit h classical training.
Mr. Soma's Anti-beer BUI was refused even a First Beading. Sir
G. GttXY declined to allow the usual courtesy to such a measure. The
hardship of having to do right in certain company was illustrated by a
most coarse and vulgar speech from Mr. Roebuck, who "spat at the
Bill," and declared the million or so who had petitioned for it "canting
hypocrites," but the right thing was done, and the partial and oppres-
sive measure was rejected by 133 to 87.
or thus,—
or thus,—
"No, Miss, that Isn't what I mean,
Gut me three yards of bombazine."
"My children are such greedy hups,
I want another pint of shrimps."
"fcSome friends have come the country from,
Draw mo a quart of Ancient Tom."
at least, if they did not think so, they spoke so ridiculously about the
impossibility of obtaining an accurate metre that the above suggestions
would have been more rational. We do not wonder that even Mr.
Cobden, who thoroughly comprehends the question, was moved to
laugh at his friend, Mr. Milner Gibson. They will also laugh at us
in France, and, for once, their epigrams will be pointed by justice.
Thursday. Supply—ridicule of the Yeomanry, who, however, got their
money—and much talk about smooth bores and Armstrongs.
Friday. The Chancellor brought in a Bill for the relief of debtors
of the humbler class. At present the County Courts send them to
gaol by the thousand for debts of two shillings, half-a-crown, and the
like. In future there is to be no imprisonment, except in cases of
fraud, creditors may be arranged with, and no beer-house bill is to
ALL LN THE DOWNS.
{New Words to the old Air.)
All in the Downs the fleet is moored,
The powder shipped, the guns on board;
Long has Britannia endured,
Ere she would give the awful word—
"Go in, my hearts of oak, so tough and true,
And lick sweet Frederick-William black and blue."
Sweet Frederick-William on his guard
Has cheap and nasty laurels flung;
While by Court-toady and Court-bard
Sonderborg's massacre is sung.
The Dutchies' crown he grasps with thievish hands—
And though detected all unblushing stands!
Soon from the Downs the fleet unmoored
May to the Baltic shape its course:
Then comes the shock, that ne'er endured,'
Of Right and Might 'gainst Fraud and Force.
And King and Kaiser yet may vail their pride
To Strength with Justice once again allied!
A JOKE ABOUT A JUDGE.
Is the alleged fact, stated in this extract from a Parliamentary
summary, credible ?—
"Sir Q. Grey said, in reply to Mr. H. Berkelet, that the convict Hutcrwbox,
sentenced to four years' penal servitude for perjury in the case of Mr. Bewicke, of
Threepwood Hall. Northumberland, had been released on a ticket-of-leave after
eighteen months' imprisonment, upon the recommendation of the Judge who had
tried him."
Released on a ticket-of-leave P Why was not the poor man released
with a free pardon if he was discovered to have been innocent of the
perjury of wnich he had been found guilty P His evidence, whether true
or false, with that of others, had caused Mr. Bewicke to be convicted of
felony, to be adjudged to penal servitude, to incur forfeiture of goods,
and ruin of health as well as of estate. Hutchinson deserved to be
hanged as much as any murderer, or he did not deserve any punishment
at all; and if, at the instance of any Judge, he has obtained a ticket of-
leave,.that most unjust and foolish Judge, whoever he is, has either
made a most imperfect reparation to an injured man, or else has been
instrumental in turning loose upon Society a scoundrel who will perhaps
one of those dark nights garotte him; and serve him right.
Nasty.
The last advices from—welL we will not mention the name of the
place, it can be seen any of these fine mornings in the Times—have
stated, that, in that part of the world, the "shirtings are unchanged."
The shirtings of this people have been in this state for several weeks!

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SHAKSPEARE
DAT WITH AV
A PILGRIMAGE TO STRATFORD.
My dear Punch,
You haven't such a thing
as a rhinoceros about you?
eh? If you have, perhaps
you may arrive at some idea
of what it is to be thick-
skinned, and I beg leave to
observe that in the thickness
of my cuticle I resemble a
rhinoceros. So don't attempt
to dart your shafts of ridicule
at me, if 1 confess 1 have
been making a pilgrimage to
Stratford. I would call him
a wise man who never in his
life had done a thing more
foolish than go to pay his
homage at the shrine of
Shakspeare. Among the
names scratched on the ceil-
ing of the room where he
was born you may see the
name of one whom England
mourned Last Christmas, and
you will hardly care to laugh
at me for following his foot-
steps.
Many pilgrims lately have
. been visiting the shrine, and
many relics of St.. Shakspeare
have been publicly on view
there to excite their veneration. Among the other show-things, they
beheld the Shakspeare goblet from which David Gaukick drank, and
the Shakspeare snuff-box, which Kemblr may have sneezed from.
They saw a fragment of the mulberry-tree that Shakspeare used to sit
under, and they were shown, moreover, the veritable cane which Shak-
speare used to carry walking, and possibly belabourthe street-boys withal
who chaffed him. They saw a score or more of portraits, supposed to
have been cut from signboards of the period, which may have adorned
the hostelry yclept "the Shakspeare Head j" and they beheld the
bran-new cast in plaster of his face, and were requested to hobserve
the 'airs still sticking in it< which are a satisfying proof that the relic is
quite genuine, although nobody has heard oi its existence until now.
As an imposing and appropriate climax to the show, they beheld the
Shakspeare shield ana other handsome bits of plate, which were given
to that eminent tragedian, Mr. Kean, who bemg in Australia, could
not himself be personally present at the show. They might drop a tear
or not as they gazed upon these relics, and endeavour to look interested,
while they possibly felt bored; and having duly "done" the relics,
they might go home to their families, and might roll their poet's eye
with the fine frenzy of a Close, as they mused on all the marvels
which as pilgrims they had seen.
With relics, then, the shrine was most abundantly endowed; but
shall I shock you very much if I confess I scarcely looked at them?
Will you regard me as a Monster if I own that Shakspeare's walking-
stick nad but little more effect upon my bump of veneration than (until
the Pope lays hold of me) would St. Goutus's big toe, or the eyeglass
of St. Squint us. Leaving others to the relics, my aim was to see the
House, and it pleased me very greatly to find that it is carefully and
reverently kept, and that the butcher's scales and flesh-hooks have been
cast out of toe temple. But twenty years ago the House of Shak-
speare was regarded with but little more esteem than the house of
Snooks or Smith, and at the lowly doorway where the Poet of all time
was dandled when a baby, the shopkeepers of Stratford bought their
steaks and mutton-chops. But offended Punch stepped in and bade the
nation buy the house, and the nation did his bidding, as it usually does.
So now the house is placed in proper care and keeping, free from damp
as well as damage by the penknives of the pilgrims, who, if permitted,
long ago would have chipped it up for snuffboxes, and put it in their
pockets.
Yet had the object of my pilgrimage but been to see the House, I
might have saved myself the journey by just going down to Sydenham
The Shakspeare house is there, as everybody knows, and they who
cannot make a pilgrimage to Stratford-upon-Avon, should go and see
the slice of it now in the Crystal Palace. But I wished to see the
neighbourhood, and to walk where Shakspeare walked, and view the
scenes where Nature filled him with her poetry. So, after seeing As
You Like It very creditably played, I strolled to Charlecote Park, and
sat "under the greenwood tree" that haply may have sprouted from
the one which Shakspeare had in his mind's eye the while he wrote:
and there the herd of deer I saw were haply some of them descendants
of the "poor sequestered stag," and the " fat and greasy citizens,"
whereof he makes his Jaques so eloquently speak. But before this I
had walked, as Shakspeare often walked, to Shottery, where his sweet-
heart used to live. "Prithee, friend," quoth I, to a rustic I encoun-
tered, "wilt direct my pilgrim feet, to Mistress Hathaway, her cot-
tage?" "Noa, zur, that a carnt," quod he, "four Oi'm a strarnger
hereaboot, an' Oi dunt knaw where she do live." Yes, beshrew me, he
said, "do." So, in terror, I forebore from the interchange of further
parley with him, lest, may be, I should learn that he knew no more.
But what about the banquet, good pilgrim, and the ball, and all the
other revelries that graced the Tercentenary? Nay, friend, ask me not
to write anent these matters. When 1 donned my pilgrim's shoon—
I mean my stoutest pair of boots—and grasped my pilgrim's staff—I
mean my best umbrella—I whispered to myself, "Pilgrim, thou carest
naught for the vain pleasures of the crowd. It delights thee not to
listen to dull after-dinner speeches, or to prank thyself in spangled and
fanciful attire, that therein thou mayest caper to the twangings of a
fiddle, or the tootlings of a flute. Let others feast and flirt and flounce
it an thej lief; and fancy, if they please, that by so doing they pay
homage to the shrine where they ore met. Be it thine to take thine
ease (if thou canst find it) at thine inn, and, ere thou goest to thy train,
to quaff another cup of ale for thy health's sake: for Stratford ale is a
rare tipple, and, were Shakspeare living now, it might tempt him to
himself, as the legend saith he did when fuddling with the
of
"Piping Pebworth, dancing Maratou,
Haimted Hillborongb, hungry Grafton,
Dudging Exhall, Papist Wickford.
Beggarly Broom and, drunken Bedford."
While such brave beer is brewed there, it needs no Tercentenary to
tempt a man to 8tratford; and, when in its normal quiet, he will see
the town far liker what it was when Shakspeare lived in it, than when
blatant with brass bands, and fluttering with flags, and flaunting with
the finery of jubilee processions.
Becommending Stratford heartily as a place to pass a day in, be it
but to sec the pleasautest of little towns and the prettiest of country
churches, 1 remain, my dear Punch, yours with reverence,
Vagabundus.
SHAKSPEABJAN NOTE.
Such was the inclement state of the weather in the days of Queen
Bess, that the crops could not be got in after the usual fashion. To
this Shakspbarb has feelingly alluded, in the refrain of the Clown't song
at the end of Twelfth Night:—
14 With a hay, hoe, the wind and the rain,
For tho rain it raineth every day."
The use of a hoe, in connection with hay, is, we take it, unprecedented
in any agricultural annals. If the second line gives us a true view of
that time, then for the change of our climate we ought to be truly
thankful. This, we believe, escaped the attention of the erudite and
laborious Dr. Farmer.
A NATIONAL DEMONSTRATION.
The attention of Parliament will have been called to the subjoined
announcement in the Times:—
"A Very Questionable Honour.—On Sunday tho Kino or Prussia conferred
the Ordor of the Black Eagle on his Royal Highness Prince Aueed."
Before these words appear in print an honourable Member will of
course have moved that an humble address be presented to Her Majesty
praying that a gift, the acceptance of which, at the hands of a potentate
engaged in an unjustifiable war conducted with shameful barbarity, is
derogatory to the honour of the British Sovereign and People, may be
immediately returned.
Boxing their Mitres.
The Bishop-Maker flew into a passion with his bishops the other
day. Out of the twenty-four, said Lord Shaftesbury, not one had
condescended to come and talk at the meeting of the Society for Con-
verting Jews. "It was a gross neglect oi duty." Bather strong
language for a layman to use in regard to the hierarchy, but we are
glad to see that the Head of the Church asserts his mastership. The
only excuse that we can think of for the naughty bishops is in the fact,
that if you divide the income of the Society by the number of Jews it
annually converts, you find that it costs about £750 to make an indif-
ferent Christian, and the bishops very properly discourage extravagance.
The Member for Sugar.
The House of Commons lately has occupied itself a good deal with
the question of the Sugar Duties. Its views of that question do not
appear to be so much influenced as one would think they might be by
the opinions of an honourable Member who may be supposed to be an
authority on the subject of sugar—Mr. Du Cane.

A WORD WITH SPAIN.
Spain is waking up in earnest. Hear the last news:
"It is proposed to construct on Spanish soil a maritime canal, to supersede the
Straits of Gibraltar."
We call this mean. After the trouble we took to get (no, not much
to get, but) to keep, Gibraltar, we really consider the proposed trick
unworthy of a chivalrous nation. However, the world is becoming
very vulgar and mercantile, and it is of no use complaining. One
would like to know the particulars, and how our flank is to be turned.
Perhaps the new canal is to begin at the mouth of the Giddle-kee-veer,
(written Guadalquiver, and rhymed to gentle river in young ladies'
songs) and come out at Malaga, a very good hundred miles of cutting
as the crow cuts, with some nice tunnelling in the way. The Spaniards,
of course, can't do it; and if it is to be done, the decent thing would be
to offer the job to an English company, whom Mr. Punch will back to
be through before Lessefs has done Suez. But why not be econo-
mical, gentlemen Spaniards—why not buy Gibraltar of us? We '11 sell
it very cheap. Spain to turn Protestant, and England to have all the
Port for twenty years; or we 'U say the Port and never mind the Pro-
testantism. Come, that will be cheaper than the canal. You had
better make a bargain, or we may happen to sell the place at Tangier,
and bring the Moors back into Europe. Remember, England is a
Mahometan power, and with a little reinforcement from India, could
easily restore the crescent in Spain. We don't wish to put on the
screw, but this Gibraltar notion is so very mean that we are obliged to
speak out. But the Spaniards are mean. Didn't their great poet.
Quintana, write a great poem on the battle of Trafalgar, and omit all

THE COMPLETE LETTER WRITER'8 REFLECTIONS.
(In the Foreign Office.)
Well, really, I think when one looks about Europe
One may say that matters are going on swimmingly
For a party wno likes to give fools and knaves due rope.
Ana then seize the opening to lecture them trimmingly.
Not to speak of the numerous tempests in tea-cups—
As, the state of row normal in China, Japan,
New Zealand, or Athens, where Greek against Greek ups
And ats it, in spite of King Geobgb, poor young man! —
In Turkey there's Abdul-as-iz looking sickly,
And like to be Abdul-as-was if his vassals
Go on setting their backs up like porcupines prickly
'Gainst Mahovnd and the Moslem, his Cadis and Castles.
To Roumans and Turks, spite of snubs, sneers, and scornings,
The despatches I've penned (if they knew how to read)!
The valu'ble lectures, and lessons, and warnings,
I've fired at the Russians (who paid them no heed)!
There was Tartar oppression and Polish prostration
Gave a chance for a lecture on duties and rights,
And I think I may say I improved the occasion—
If no other improvement my labour requites.
I June that my language was all that it should be:
That I trod, with due pressure, on Russia's corns:
And you '11 own, nothing neater or more nimble could be
Than the way, when she growled, that I drew in my horns.
America, too, has afforded an opening
For some very complete letter-writing indeed:
And I'll back my transitions from snarling to soap'ning
For neatness 'gainst most things you 're likely to read.
But of all the magnificent chances for writing
That ever a born despatch-writer befell,
The best's German's quarrel with Dane: while they're fighting,
I sit in my office, and give it both well.
Where they 're both in the wrong I demonstrate astutely,
What both ought to do I distinctly lay down;
Recommend calm to Denmark, while suffering acutely,
And justice to Prussia, while cribbing a crown.
For foul deeds I can find words still fairer and more fair:
As for fighting—it's always a hazardous game:
And if apprehension of war should breed warfare,
We must plead our intentions, and pocket the blame.
Talk's the thing I prefer, if I'm cut off my writing:
And a Conf 'rence may lead to despatches again:
There's only one course that I deprecate—fighting—
And such stuff as " Beitanmia ruling the main."
If we're cuffed on the right cheek, our duty (we 're told it)
Is to offer the left cheek for cuff number two:
We've a great deal of cheek yet uncuffed—so let's hold it
For Prussia and Austria to cuff black and blue.
It is true one still talks of the old British Lion:
But the animal now is the sign of a shop:
As a nation of tradesmen, on business relying,
We must stick to despatches, and armaments drop.
It is true we are strong, that our strength might be mighty
To protect right and weakness from brute-force and wrong;
But business is business: such notions are flighty,
Helping weakness don't pay: better side with the strong.
If one's forced to protest, just to keep up appearances,
We '11 protest in strong language, for words are but wind.
As for action—just think of our cargoes and clearances!
Leave those to draw swords who have no shops to mind.
Be Lunatico.

PAWS OFF!
Mb, Punch criticises critics and everybody else. His infallibility
claims right to supervise all things. If he habitually lets "the best
public instructors" alone rather severely, it is chiefly because they,
habitually, write a set of stereotype platitudes which offer no point for
comment. Their grand aim is to "give no offence," especially to managers
(for reasons which, as no critic is also a dramatic author, Mr. Punch
never could fathom) and to use as many adjectives and superlatives as
can conveniently be enlisted into the service of Mb. Puff, never so
dominant as now. But when Mr. Punch, who reads everything, per-
ceives a disposition towards better things, he is not slow to recognise
the exception to the general and humiliating rule. Last week: he
observed in his faithful friend and intense admirer, the Morning Star, a
notice of a new adaptation from the French, a piece called David
Oarrick, and the criticism is a very just and proper one. Indeed, the
theatrical critic for the Star, though somewhat prone to discover ex-
quisite perfection, sparkling wit, "gems," and the like, in the inferior
drama, as presented at inferior theatres, has evidently a sense of the
fitness of things theatrical, and if he would treat of those things in the
interest of the public, and without the slightest care about anybody but
the public, might speak his mind with advantage to the drama.
In this new piece, taken from a play of M. de Melleville, called
Sullivan, the character of David Oarrick has been very objectionably
dealt with. The French author took no such liberty, perhaps remem-
bering that the great actor was from the French family named G aebique.
It was reserved for the English adapter to depict him in an unworthy
manner, and to falsify his history. Gabbick had his faults, who but
Mr. Punch has none, but the worst was an elaborate vanity. He was a
Ssntleman and a scholar, the intimate friend of Johnson, Reynolds,
urke, and Goldsmith, his art was of the highest orderhe was the
admiration of his age, and he was held worthy of a place in Westminster
Abbey. That is not the kind of name that should be used
"To point a Playbill, or adorn a Faroe."
Furthermore, everybody knows that he married a most estimable and
loveable lady, Eva-Mabia Violetta, or Veigal, and the touching
record that we have of her long widowed life should have prevented a
sham love affair and a sham marriage from being presented as part of
the history of her husband, presented within a stone's throw from the
house which we daily look at with interest from its having been the
home of the Garricks.
Wherefore, we read with real satisfaction, the following protest in
the Morning Star:—
"Oarrick in the new play refuses a proffered annuity, bnt agrees to behave in
such a manner as shall induce a young lndy to regard him with ineffable disgust,
and in compliance with this engagement, Doing invited to dinner, he pretends to
be drunk, and behaves so disreputably that the young lady who was enamoured of
him herself orders him to leave the house. Now, if ever there was an actor who
had a reverence for his art, and a regard for the character of its professors, that man
was David Oarrick. It was quite natural that ho should counsel the father of a
love-sick girl, who had been smitten by seeing him as Romeo, to disenchant her by
showing him to her in a repulsive character; but to impute to him the deliberate
degradation of his vocation in the eyes of those who already held it in no high
esteem by mumming bestiality for the mere satisfaction of a stranger's wish which
he was in no wise bound to respect, is a foul libel on his memory, and, as such,
should be resented and denounced. But this is not the only liberty which the
adapter takes with biographical veracity. He makes Qarrick desperately in love
with Ada Ingot, and marries him to her at the end of the third act, leaving it to
be supposed that their wedded life was a short if not a merry one, and that she
disappeared from this mortal sphere in time to allow Qarrick to marry Mdlle.
Violettb seven years afterwards, and disappeared so thoroughly that contemporary
history gives no hint of her existence. The piece in which the greatest of English
actors is thus scandalously misrepresented," he.
Mr. Punch cordially endorses this protest. Where is the system of
mangling and disfiguring biography to stop? Mbs. Gabbick died so
recently as 1822, so that a lapse of forty years entitles a dramatist to
break into a reverenced house, upset the old Lares and Penates, and
substitute plaster images of his own. The families of later actors than
Gabbick had better look out, or we may have the noble figure of
Charles Kemble introduced upon the stage, and see him marry, not
Miss de Camp, but some gouty alderman's daughter of the Regency
period—nay, why stop at gentlemen—could not Mbs. Siddons be fitted
with a farce-scene ana a second match?" Hast no reverence?" By
the way, what is a Licenser for? Had the profaned character been the
grandfather of one of our Dukes, or even the Marquis of Steyne, the
piece would have been promptly ordered into dock for refitting. Ha!

THE REJECTED OF THE ACADEMY.

Vice.
Sir,—Leaving to such of your
critics as like to paint refined
gold and gild the hly, the work
of dilating upon the merits of the
artists who have attained fame,
and whose pictures are this year
exhibited, let me rather console
the unfortunate by noticing a few
of the Rejected Works. I have
IHllR. /WW IU\\ II 'J unsuccessful painters, and have
made in some cases slight sketches
of the paintings. My own pri-
vate opinion is, that there is an
immense deal of unrecognised
talent in this country, and when
the new and vast Halls of Art at
BurlingtonHouse shall be opened,
and the malevolent Academicians
shall be deprived of their only
excuse for rejecting the works of
young rivals, you will see how
cruelly rising genius has been
dealt with.
For instance, Sir, here is young Sylvan Bluggerby's picture. He
simply calls it, Vice. How would the conventional artist have treated
it? Most likely in an objectionable manner.. We might have had vice
rendered fascinating, and the temptations of St. Antony might have
been reproduced, really with a demoralising purpose, though under the
pretence of moral teaching. Look above, Sir, at Bluggerby's way of
presenting Vice. Is there anything demoralising there? Is that in the
Etty or Frost style? No, Sir; Clapham might buy that picture.
And yet look at the subtle moral. Observe the conscientiously painted
screw, and see how, after
one twist, this Vice will
hold its victim in an iron
clutch. Who would be vi-
cious after gazing on this?
And yet this was rejected.
Is the Hanging Committee
truly virtuous?
Now, Sir, we come to a
sea-piece. I know that a
good deal is said about
Mr. Stanfleld's wonderful
waves, and the deep cool
sea-green of Mr. Hook.
But look at this painting,
by James Dollopps, of The
Chops of the Channel. The
composition is beautiful, the
pyramidal or School of
Athens form is classically
adhered to, and there is a
true inspiration.
The old place is by the sea, as you may notice by the gulls flying, and
the artist subtly hints, with the poet, that Love [the Old, Old Story)
"still hath something of the sea, from whence his mother rose." I
wish you could see the light upon the falling shutter, aerial perspective
has never been carried to such perfection.


The Chops of the Channel.
movement about the whole which shows
The flesh tints are exquisite, and so is the contrast
between the meatiness of the chops and the transparency of the water.
Any one who has ever seen a similar scene can testify to its fidelity.
Then, Mr. Punch, I present to you an outline of a work by Sam

The Old, Old Story.
Blibe. It bears the same title as one of F. Stone's pictures, but is
treated far more poetically. Anybody can draw a sentimental boy and
girl, but look at this, The Old, Old Story. Is there not poetry there?
The Mill Race.
This is, again, a rural scene, by Edward Smacker, and is called
The Mill Race. When the Mill on the Floss, or any other sporting
story, requires illustration, here is the artist. Look at the vigour of
the figure a little in the rear, but soon to be first. Michael Angelo
never drew anything like that hind leg. The work was originally called
Don Quixote's Dream, but the home-
lier name was preferred.
This grand, yet simple work is
called, after an interesting work on
the lower orders,—The Missing Link.
The artist, the young and accom-
plished Snapfebton, had intended
to call it Thais, but the absence of
explanatory figures seemed to make
this less desirable. Mr. Ruskin
writes eloquently upon the way in
which you should first do your pic-
ture, and then stick in a bit of red,
"and all is in a flame." and I hope he
will call and see the bit of red at the
end of this link. It is marvellous.
So, in its way, is Scrumbleboy's pic-
ture from Macbeth, "This is a sorry
Sight!" The vigorous drawing, and
the profound knowledge of anatomy
displayed here, speak for themselves;
and truly artistic is the reticence
with which the face of Macbeth is
kept in the side-ground, so that the
idea of shrinking and terror may be
maintained. Let me next ask you to
examine Miss Astragal's lovely . .
and poetical Venus Rising from the Sea. Here, a subject which is better
let alone is let alone, ana ill place of an undraped coquette staring at
sea-monsters, we have a sparkling planet ascending from ttie waves.
In the original the natural effect of the water dropping off the ravs
of the star, which is still wet, is given with a fairy brilliancy. The

But we cannot think that the excellent Bishop, Lord Auckland, who

one statement. He said that "they had got Mr. George Gilbert

expect that Mr. Scott will abandon his profession, and let himself be
built into Bath Abbey, is rather too much. We mow his honourable
devotion to cathedral architecture, but this is too Pointed a Style of

the Improvident Society shall, as a preliminary step, show his fitness
for so doing by spending at the very least a clear naif of his wages in
porter, ale or gin, or other alcoholic liquor, on the day on which he first
applies to be a member.
Rule II. That six weeks shall elapse between his application and
the day of his election, and that, as a further test of his fitness for the
membership, the candidate shall nightly, during his probation, attend
the public-house where the Improvidents' assemble, and spend not less
than tcnpence before he goes to bed.
Rule III. That on the night of his election the candidate shall stand
at least a pot of beer to every member of the Society who is present at
the meeting, and a shillingsworth of spirits to the treasurer and secretary
and each of the trustees, who will therein drink his health on his
admission to the Club.
Rule IV. That all the members shall assemble every Friday and
Saturday at eight o'clock at night, those being the evenings on which
wages are now paid; and that every member who, from any cause, is
absent on either of those evenings shall be fined a shilling for each night
of his absence, which sum shall be demanded of him when he next
attends, and shall be spent in beer or other alcoholic liquor by the
members of the Club.
Rule V. That a subscription of one shilling shall weekly be paid in
by every Improvident; ana that, at the time of his paring his subscrip-
tion, he shall drink a pot of beer and smoke not fewer than six pipes.
Rule VL That when any claim is made on the Society for any
illness, accident, or death of any member, it shall be lawful for the
treasurer to call a special meeting to investigate the claim, when a
special pot of beer shall be served to every member out of the Club
funds.
Rule VTL That, if the claim be sanctioned, another special meeting
shall be convened for payment of the sum awarded, when another pot
of beer shall, in like manner, be served to every member who attends;
and tha secretary, treasurer, and trustees of the Club shall be allowed a
bottle of wine a-head out of the Club funds, or if they prefer it, a bowl
a-piece of punch.
Rule VIII. That when any death occurs in the Society, all the
members shall assemble to attend the funeral, and, to show their grief
becomingly, shall spend the evening afterwards at their usual public-
house.
Rule IX. That the funds of the Society be confided to the keeping
of not less than four trustees, who shall not be held responsible for any
misappropriation, shortcoming, or misuse.
Rule X. That it shall be lawful for the trustees, whenever they
think fit, to break up the Society, without assigning to the members
any reason for so doing, and without being requireq to exhibit their
accounts, or to surrender any money remaining in their hands.
With such admirable rules to provide for its safe working, it is
impossible to doubt that the Improvident Society will prove a splendid
boon to every working man who joins it. Clearly the establishment of
similar societies will prove how needless and uncalled-for, not to say
tyrannical and wickedly unjust, is the threatened interference in the
matter by the Government, who, by their proposed measure, have been
seen in their true colours as the violent oppressors of the British
working-man. Through the wisdom of the rules by which it will be
regulated, the Improvident Society will very clearly demonstrate what
good habits are engendered by clubs held at pubhc-houses. and with
what absolute security the working-classes may entrust their hard-
earned weekly savings to the friendly hands held out to relieve them—
of their coin.

POOR OLD DEARS!
Our. dear old friends, Mesdames Gamp and Harris, continue to scold
us in the most outrageous manner; and though we assure these ladies,
with tears in our fine eyes, that nothing from them can make us angry
—we owe them too much—we cannot help feeling their unkyindness.
But for Mr. Punch, who would know that such organs of the Great
Conservative Party were in existence? When the very chiefs of the
G. C. Party repudiate the poor old women, simply because they have
grown aged and a little discursive, is it not chivalrous in Mr. Punch to
uphold the bewildered matrons, and to insist upon honour being shown
to their grey hairs? Dear Gamp and Harris, you do not know what
pains Punch takes for you. He lias repeatedly, in private (for he is
very intimate with all clever folk), reproached some of the best of the
Conservative lot for the scorn or neglect with which they treat the
Conservative press; and what is the constant answer? Hold your
tongue, you cynic, won't you! We can't get any clever fellows to go
the whole hog with us, and what's the use of these twaddling, emo-
tional, Sword-of-Gideon beggars?" The language is not refined, but a
certain licence is permitted^ to the angry. Mr. Punch has replied,
sweetly, that a Party claiming half the Commons, and two-thirds of the
Lords, and no end of parsons, squires, and beadles, ought to have an
Organ, and that organ should play authorised music. Fresh abuse, too
painful to set down, has been the result, and Mr. Punch has even been
informed that he takes an unfair political advantage in attacking the
Tories for anything that Gamp and Harris may "cackle." Yes. cackle
was the coarse word; and when Lord ••**•• reads this, let him
blush. But Mr. Punch does not mean to desert his dear old women.
"What—an old woman must not be cast away," says Dryden. And
for the dear angry old souls' complaint that Mr. Punch makes "no
fun" out of the humiliated honour of England," and the British Lion
crouching miserably at the heels of the French poodle, all he answers
is, Wait a bit. Wait till the Tories come in, and then we will have fun
enough and to spare. Mr. Punch has put them out twice within the
last ten years, but the way he will do it when they come in again shall
even make Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Harris crack their old staylaces and
sneeze themselves into fits of laughter. Bless the old dears!
THE SEVEN SLEEPERS IN TROUBLE.
That England is the land of liberty, what foreigner will doubt who
reads the subjoined paragraph from the Times ?—
"A New Crime.—On Tuesday morning seven gipsies were charged, before tho
Rev. Uriah Ton kin, at Hayle (Cornwall), with sleeping under tents, and wore each
committed to 21 days' imprisonment in the county gaol, with hard labour. The
party consisted of mother and six children, aged 20,16, 15,13,10, and S years."
The punishment of twenty-one days' imprisonment and hard labour
is one which is very terrible to evil-doers. A thief would much rather
"have three months." An imprisonment of twenty-one days, with hard
labour, is also imprisonment with hard fare—imprisonment on a diet so
low as to be insufficient to support life for a much longer period. Such
a punishment as this is well calculated to impress upon gipsies, and
especially gipsies of ten and eight year3 of age, tne illegality of sleeping
under tents, if that repose is illegal, which it must be, or else the Rev.
Uriah Tonkin had better be relieved of the office of adrninistering
what he imagines to be justice. Let us hope that the incarceration, by
the fiat of that worshipful and reverend gentleman, of a mother and her
six offending children, for taking the liberty of passing the night after
the manner of the patriarch Abraham and his family, will operate as a
salutary example on unthinking persons of the better orders who do not
mind what they are about when engaged in a pic-nic under the shelter
afforded by Messrs. Edgington.

Agricultural Distress.
In the Agricultural districts there has lately been much
distress, arising from the inability of large fanners to
resolve the following problem:—
Q. If a man, having one Dairy, found that the building
another was of vital consequence to the pecuniary interests
of his milk-trade, why ought the erection of such house,
as aforesaid, to be a matter of but minor importance?
The answer to this is:—Because such a building as
above-mentioned would be, from its very nature, only a
Second-dairy Consideration.
An Answer Required—Dr. Cullen says the back-
bone of Ireland has gone to America. He omitted to state
when the jawbone was to follow.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 11. Monday. Yes, only the eleventh of May, but the public
will be happy to hear that the Session is already considered as virtually
over. "Its neck is understood to be broken," says the Timet, and the
Chancellor this week spoke of the impending "massacre of the
innocents." This is truly delightful, and who knows but that some of
these days it may not be discovered that the sun can rise, and men can
dine, ana the young can marry and be given in marriage, and under-
takers can prosper, and all in the absence of Parliaments. We are
horribly in advance of our age, we know; but every year some
superstition is vanishing, and why should not Mr. Lefevre's wig
fly up to the stars and shine with Berenice's hair.
Lord Campbell tried to get up a Polish demonstration, and Lord
Russell replied to him in so exquisitely Whiggish a way that it ought
not to be forgotten. "Poland's true policy is to wait until the Russian
Liberal Party shall come into power. The dear little old man thinks
but of lobbies, and divisions, and party cheers at four in the morning,
and fancies that he hears Prince Suwarroff, and Duke Constantine,
and (Baron Knoutemall announcing that they merely hold their
places until His Constitutional Majesty the Emperor shall be pleased
to nominate their successors. Russian heads must be punched
considerably in the meantime. As a burlesque writer would probably
say—
"A Russian Speaker now were out of place,
Czars must nap pepper ere they give the Mace.'*
In the Commons there was a curious scene. It was announced that
the Conference had arranged an armistice, for a month, between the
Danes and the Germans. A few minutes later a telegram was read,
stating that three Danish vessels had engaged five Austrian vessels near
Heligoland, that the Danes were victorious, and the Austrians were
hurrying away for Heligoland, so as to be in English waters. The
House of Commons rang with cheering.
We had a long Supply debate, with a little infusion of Catholic and
Protestant rancour (a school question) to make it endurable—the Part-
nershipBill was much mangled, and will probably be withdrawn, and
Fred Peel brought in a Bill enablingthe Queen to grant a lease for 999
years of the College of Physicians, in Pall Mall East. Ah! Long before
that lease shall be out it is to be hoped that the world will have learned
to do without physicians, of any kind.
Tuesday. Lord Ellenborough withdrew his Bill for establishing a
sort of Council to revise Capital Sentences, the Government having
assented to the appointment of a " Hanging Committee." Lord Redes-
dale expressed his dislike of "extenuating circumstances." They never
were so ingeniously pleaded, in Mr. Punch's recollection, as when a
Frenchman, who had murdered his father, and also his mother, hoped
that the Court would have mercy on a poor Orphan.
Mr. White, of Brighton, objected to our present system of taxation.
Mr. Gladstone admitted that it had objectionable points, but said that
the question was not how to do what was best in theory, but how to
get the money out of people's pockets. The House was Counted Out.
Wednesday. This day was rather remarkable. It may be mentioned
in history with the days on which CjEsar crossed the Rubicon, Mario
went over to the Covent Garden Opera, and Lord Derby abandoned the
Reform Ministers. Mr. Baines moved the Second Reading of his Bill
for lowering the suffrage in boroughs to £6. This is avowedly a Radical
measure. The Conservatives have always opposed it on their own
grounds. The Liberals (since they have been in office) have met such
proposals by objecting that they Were made at a wrong time; that the
public did not care about the matter; that the franchise might properly
be lowered, but that the amount proposed was not a wise one; that the
scheme was only fragmentary; that the Government ought to have
charge of such measure, and so forth; and this sort of thing was
expected from the Minister who might have to speak to-day. But Mr.
Cave having moved the previous question, the Chancellor of the

for Oxford University, arose, and delivered
peech in favour of Mr. Baines's Bill. Par
Exchequer, and M.I
himself of a very strong speecn in
liament, he said, had not done its duty in regard to Reform—there
ought to be a sensible increase in the Constituency from the working
classes—those who would exclude 49-50tn» of that class ought to show
why this should be—he believed that if the upper portion of the lower
order were admitted, they would not vote for demagogues, and that there
was a very good feeling between that class and their superiors. He
supported the BUI, and paired off in its favour with Mr. Lever, who
was against it. Mr. Whiteside expressed his astonishment, and
wished that Lord Palmerston had been present, as he would have
proved to his refractory Chancellor that such a Bill ought not to pass.
There was a longish debate, and t he Bill was rejected by 272 to 216.
All the world wants to know the meaning of this sudden conversion of
the Conservative Member for Oxford to the views of Messrs. Bright
and Cobden. Is he going to throw the University over, and offer
himself for Finsbury? Lf so, Mb. Cox had better stand for Oxford,
and we advise him to go down to Commemoration, and get made a
D.C.L.
Thursday. Yankee agents are very active in kidnapping poor ignorant
Irishry and the like, pretending to engage them for railway work, but
really catching them for the Federal army. Lokd Russell promises
to remonstrate, but he will do no good, the temptation to smuggle the
article Irishman is too high. We can only enter these grievances in an
account to be set against the demand with which we are threatened,
for compensation for the damage done by the vessels we have allowed
the Southerners to steal out of our dockyards.
Are we never to hear the last of the Education squabbles? Sir
George Gret and the Government have found out, after a month, that
their honour is wounded by the vote which caused Mr. Lowe to resign.
So they demand a Committee to inquire into their conduct. Mr.
Bernal Osborne took an opportunity of giving some very hard words
to Lord Robert Cecil and his party, in reference to their charge*
against Mr. Lowe, and was in no way daunted by the threat that hat
words should be taken down. On the following night, Mr. Lowj
himself had something rather severe to say about Members who avail
themselves of information supplied by disloyal or discharged servants of
Government. Touching which, there is much to be said on both sides.
One hates a man who is not true to his employers and his " salt," but
just as our allegiance to the Queen over-rides all smaller ties and obli-
gations, it may he that a duty to the nation may interfere with technical
devotion to a certain office and set of head clerks. All such cases must
be judged separately, and on their own merits, and in the present case,
though Mr. Lowe is a loss, it is quite clear that a most objectionable
system of suppression has been brought to light through the spite of his
enemies.
We had rather an amusing debate, in Supply, about the Parks.
Regent's Park costs about £10,000 a-year, though we have no idea how
the money can go, unless it is in lozenges for the men who make night
hideous by bellowing frantically " All out," until they get frightfully
hoarse. It is not spent in cleansing the Ornamental Water, the odour
from which is at times simply poisonous, nor is it spent in keeping order
in the Park, and preventing great coarse louts from insulting nurse-
maids, knocking down children, and beating their remonstrant little
brothers. In faot, Regent's Park is the worst kept of all the Parks, and
the representations and complaints made to Mr. Punch upon the sub-
ject are awful.
Friday. While the armistice lasts, the German robbers are to desist
from robbing the Jutlanders. Louis Napoleon, our dear, do you so
very much want that German frontier? We are not desirous to spoil
our maps, but if your heart is so very deeply set upon it—" we will
speak further of this business."
Lord Westbury's plan for doing justice to Professor Jowett has
not met with the approval of the Lords, who incline to try whether the
University itself cannot be brought to do what is right. The hard thing
is that, if the matter were left to the University itself, justice would be
done at once; but it is the outlying parsons, saturated with the preju-
dices of stagnant parishes, who rush perspiring into Oxford and neutra-
lise the votes of the men who think, and who are really interested in
the question. The Bill stands over, Lord Westbury not forgetting to
say a sharp thing or two about " hollow pretences." It came out the
same night, in the Commons, that the Archbishop of Canterbury has
the right of conferring the degree of M.D. Let him exercise it in favour
of Mr. Jowett, and order him to bleed and shave the heads of the frantic
majority that is bringing the Church into contempt by bigotry.
Here we would mention, that twice this week Mere was interesting
debate touching Mr. Herbert, the painter, and the glorious fresco
which he has set up in the New Palace of Westminster. Let us record
a generous tribute paid to the work by Mr. Bright, who was for a large
vote in reward for so noble a creation. The unanimous homage of the
House was liberally paid to Mr. Herbert, and yet it was impossible
to extort from Government more than a promise that the mean pay
already Mr. Herbert's by right should be, in some muddling and
unexplained way, somewhat increased. Had it been a case of some
clumsy sea-officer (with high friends) who had smashed one of our ships'
on a rock, and wanted compensation for the loss of his own outfit, it would
have been instantly and fully accorded, with a severe rebuke to any low-
minded economist who would add to the sufferings of a gallant officer
by refusing to buy him a new dressing-case. How "the Services"
would have started up and borne tribute to the clumsy man's merits.
But here was only a painter who has done a work that will live when
every name in both the Army and Navy Lists shall be utterly forgotten.
We finished the week with an American dispute. That is to say,
Mr. Thomas Basing, Conservative, is scandalised that the pirate
Georgia, which was got away from England by false pretences, and has
since been devastating Federal commerce, should now be in Liverpool,
and yet not be seized. iTbe Attorney-General had to justify our non-
j action, and his technicalities were highly satisfactory to those who
desired an excuse for not doing anything. To speak conidentially, and
on the «aderstanding that things go nolurther, the case m this. If we
only knew which way the war was going! If we were certain that the
glorious and almighty bird of freedom that waves its alablaster wings in
Washington and smiles !on all that is free and enlightened, would
triumph over those savage, disloyal, feroeams rebels, those stealers and
(loggers of men and women; those ruffians, assassins, and what not, we
should know what to do. But if that resolute and gallant band of
Confederated gentlemen, who have withdrawn from the vulgar and
tyrannical Yankees, ana, aided by their faithful colowed vassals,
have maintained so noble a resistance against the loafers, jobbers,
miscreants, seam and spawn of the North—if these Southern patriots
should establish their independence—why .
Therefore, you see, the crisis demands the greatest amount of talk

SILEUCE THOSE STREET 0RGAUS.
The name of Mr. Bass is announced as that of the author of a
Bill for the abatement of the Organ-nuisance, thus epitomised in the
Timet.—
"STunsf Homo.—Mr. Bass's Bill Is very short. It describes the existing L*w
as insamctont fer the protection of householders from annoyance by street nvisi-
cians, and ft proposes to enact that any householder, personally or by his servant
or by a Police Constable, 'may require any street musician or singer to depart from
the neighbourhood of the house ; and a penalty up to 40l. is imposed on every one
who, after being so required to depart, sounds or plays upon any musical instrument
or sings in any thoroughfare near such house. It is to bo lawful for a Police Con-
stablo to take the offendor into custody without a warrant. The Bill extends only
to the metropolitan polioc district. The second reading is fixed for the Sth of June."
May the manly voice of Bass prove effectual when raised in Parlia-
ment against the childish treble of the dissonant pipes of those grinding
organs which delight none but idle nursemaids and their squalling
charges. If Mr. Bass carries his much-required measure, we shall have a
higher opinion of him than ever; and he is a legislator of whom we have
never thought small beer. The interests of beer, it must be remem-
bered, are deeply concerned in the suppression of barrel organs. Tne
beer which Mr. Bass is famous for brewing will keep in any climate as
long as nobody drinks it; but even Bass's beer is liable to be turned
sour by organ-grinding. Should his Bill for the protection of house-
holders' ears become law, we shall have no hesitation in recommending
his beer as safe to remain sound under all external conditions. We shall
also propose that the relief from organ-grinders obtained by Mr. Bass
shall be commemorated by a monument inclusive of a Basso rilievo.
There will be time enough between this and the Sth of June to
rectify any portion of the wording of the Bill which may be capable of
any latitude of construction. Let it distinctly provide that the organ-
grinders, singers, and bands, shall, when required, be obliged to go
entirely out of hearing, and make themselves altogether scarce, and no
mistake.
The Great Well Paid.
At the annual Ascension Dinner at Lambeth Palace, given by th«

England and Ireland were present, together with the Bishops or
London, Durham, Winchester, St. Asaph, Chichester, Oxford,
Bangor, Llandaff, Gloucester, Salisbury, Ely, Carlisle, Wor-
cester, Lichfield, St. David's, Down and Connor, and Lincoln.
Their united incomes amounted to a considerable sum.

more exactly, the

plains an act of;
rascality which has
just been com-
mitted by the State
Legislature:—'

the belief that ho
would receive six per
cent, in the standard
currency of the world,
namely, gold or silver,
or its equivalent, will
this year receive about
four per cent., and pos-
sibly only throe.
As a, or the,
respectable Ameri-
can paper, the New
York Timet indig-
nantly repudiates this act of partial repudiation, instead of glorying in
it. In thus expressing an honest opinion that journal has distinguished
itself by an act of courage which, let us hope, has not caused its office
to be demolished by the public of New York.
Our own Timet, in its American correspondence, contains, besides an
account of the roguery above related, the statement following :—
"New York, however, does not stand alone in its dishonesty. The State of Ohio,
which had a reserve in gold sufficient to discharge the interest of the debt due to
its domestic and foreign creditors, had the meanness to sell at a high premium tho
gold which it held in reserve to meet its liabilities, to pay its creditors in greenbacks
at par, and to pocket the difference."
The sufferers by the financial dodges above specified will of course be
exclusively foreigners. What Yankee would ever lend money to his
own State? The greenness of the greenhorns who have sunk their eash
in the New York and Ohio securities, falsely so called, is suitably repaid
in greepbacks. There are probably not a few of these unfortunate
yokels. The world has grown but little if any wiser than it was when
Sydney Smith said that he had invested in Pennsylvanian bonds in
common "with many other unwise people." The cheated creditors of
Ohio and New York, to be sure, may say that they were never such
fools as to expect that those States would be restrained from cheating
them by any moral considerations. They perhaps relied only on the
assurance that the greatest rogues will pay just interest if it is their
interest so to do, as it may be supposed to be if they wish ever to be
trusted again. But Yankees take a short-sighted view of their own
interest, which for the present lies in cheating other people out of theirs.
If they look farther, they speculate on the forgetfulness of mankind,
and the ignorance or disregard, on the part of fools, of the warnings
afforded by the fate of other fools.

POLICE REPORT EXTRAORDINARY.
Two ruffianly-looking personages of foreign appearance, and speaking
broken English, who gave their names as Frederick-William Louis
Hohenzollern, and Francis-Joseph Hapsburg, were charged before
Mr. Sull, the sitting Magistrate, with an aggravated assault and high-
way robbery, accompanied by brutal and unnecessary violence, on a
poor little Dane, Christian Glucksbourg.
The complainant presented a frightful spectacle.. His head was enve-
loped in surgical bandages, one of his arms in a sling, the hand of the
other strapped with adhesive plaster, and he seemed unable to crawl
except with the support of two sticks. When ofTered a seat on the
bencn by the worthy Magistrate, he seemed so affected by the brutal
treatment he had so evidently received, as at first to distrust even the
worthy Magistrate's kindness, declaring in broken English, with a
strong North German accent and much angry vehemence, that England
was a verdammter deceiving place—that he had suffered from trusting
Englishmen: how did he know the officers might not pull away the
chair from under him, and let him down suddenly; he had oeen let down
once too often already; how did he know they weren't all in league
with those wretches, pointing to the prisoners; and a great deal more
to the same effect j showing great obstinacy in his asseverations, and
resisting every attempt of the worthy Magistrate to stop him, or to
obtain explanation of the particulars of the assault. The worthy
Magistrate at last interposed, and begged the complainant to compose
himself. He was among friends there, and need not be afraid either of
being taken in, or made the subject of practical jokes or ill-treatment.
He (Mr. B.) sat there in the Court of public opinion, to administer the
law, and inflict summary punishment, and. he would take care the
complainant had full justice.
The complainant on this became calmer, and as well as his fearful
injuries and imperfect knowledge of the English language would allow
him, went on to state that he had recently succeeded to a consider-
able, though rather embarrassed, Estate in Copenhagen, including
some outlying land in Jutland, Schleswig and Holstein, as to the
ownership of some parcels of which—more particularly the last— there
had been long disputes and much litigation in the time of the
former owner. The prisoners at the bar appear in the first instance
to have gone to this land, of which the complainant had just taken
possession, under cover of a regular writ of ejectment, which they
insisted on serving, as agents of certain claimants. But whether
this claim rested on an alleged title as heirs-at-law, or as mortgagees,
by virtue of a failure of covenant, or what its exact character was, we
found it impossible to make out, from the very confused account of the
complainant, the constant interruption of the prisoners, and the
extremely imperfect efforts of several volunteer interpreters who
intruded their services with rather suspicious eagerness. At last the
worthy Magistrate got a little impatient, and said "he was not sitting
there to try a nice question of title; a brutal assault had evidently been
committed. You had only to look at the unfortunate object in the
witness-box to see that."
Here the older and more plausible prisoner, Hohenzollern, inter-
rupted with great vehemence:—"Glucksbourg was a bully and a
tyrant; he had behaved shamefully to his (prisoner's) relations, and all
he (prisoner) had done was to protect his relations from the complain-
ant's violence. This gentleman (pointing to the other prisoner) had
gone with him to help liim."
The worthy Magistrate said, " Surely, it did not require two great
hulking fellows, like the prisoners, to deal with one small and weaklv
person, like complainant, even if they had any legal rights, or good
ground of grievance against him."
The complainant protested "he had never ill-used prisoners' rela-
tions; he only wanted his rierhts, of which the prisoners and their
relations had ousted him." He then stated that on going down to
take possession of his property, prisoners, who had collected an armed
posse of followers just outside the gate, declared, with very bad lan-
guage, that they would be the death of him if he dared to set foot on
the Land. Complainant remonstrated, and offered to go into the papers
with them, and to make an appointment for the earliest day possible
with his men of business for the purpose. The prisoners said " that

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
was all stuff and nonsense: that they'd been humbugged long enough;
they'd be if they'd stand any more palaver; they meant to have
the land then and there; they were twenty to his one: if he resisted,
it would be the worse for him."
Complainant told them he wasn't to be bullied, and warned them off
at their peril: "If he was weak, he'd friends who wouldn't see him ill-
treated and robbed"—(here the complainant became much affected);
"he thought he might say that: had had friends who had promised to
stand byhim and see him through it—they hadn't kept their word:
he would rather not say who those friends were."
The prisoners replied that "he and his friends might be ." Was
it necessary to repeat the exact language?
The worthy Magistrate said it was not necessary.
"Prisoners then advanced, threateningly, to the gate. He tried to
hold it, with the help of two farm-servants, and a woman who was
weeding, and a small boy who had been fetched from crow-keeping in
the neighbouring fields, but the prisoners and their followers, who
carried fire-arms, had forced the gate, nearly—if not quite—murdered
the complainant s servants—he saw the men on the ground, a huge
fellow running after the boy with a jack-knife, and several men
kicking the woman, before lie lost his own senses—then knocked
down complainant, beat and cut him fearfully, firing several
shots into him as he lay on the ground, jumped on him with heavy |
boots, tied his hands and feet, tore the clothes off his back, took all
his money and papers, and would no doubt have finished him outright,
hut for the arrival of a strong body of the European police-force, who
had been drawn to the spot by the disturbance."
The worthy Magistrate said it wasT very extraordinary there never
seemed to be any lack of policemen after an outrage. He only wished
they were as active in preventing rows and assaults, as they were ready
to make their appearance in that Court, and talk about them after they
were over.
Inspector RUS3ELX "hoped the worthy Magistrate didn't mean the
police neglected their duty; because if such a statement was published
by the reporters with the worthy Magistrate's name to give-it weight—"
Mb. B. "could only say that he wished the police would now and
then try the plan of looking the stable-door before the steed was stolen."
—Laughter in Court, which was instantly suppressed by the worthy
Magistrate: "He would clear the Court if that was repeated. This
was a very serious case; a poor man had been brutally ill-treated, robbed,
and beaten within an inch of his life—if he ever got over it." Here
the complainant became very faint, and was supplied by the Usher with
a glass of water, which revived him.
The prisoners, on being called upon for their defence, made a rambling
and contradictory statement, to the effect that they had only been
acting for their relatives, the real owners of the property, who had been
kept out of their rights by the complainant and the owner he claimed
under; his legal title was bad. Didn't remember that they had once
recognised his title and signed a paper to that effect. (On being shown
the paper.) Had no doubt they did; but that was in consideration of
promises that hadn't been kept. Always kept their own promises. The
prisoner, though he looked small and weakly, was- really a very violent,
harsh, tyrannical, and bullying person. Prisoners were hard working
men, who paid their way, respected other people's rights, and only
wished to do as they'd be done by. They had been called in by their
relations, who required protection from complainant. They were very
fond of their relations—quite a happy family. Their relatioas were
not now in possession—quite the reverse. They (prisoners) were, and
meant to remain so—in trust for their relations. Their feelings were
outraged; they might have used a little more violence than was neces-
sarv, but it was all the prisoner's fault. Hoped the Magistrate wouldn't
be hard on them. They were willing to own the prisoner's title now,
and to make it square with him if they had a chaaee."
The worthy Magistrate said " he would remand the case for a month,
and the prisoners had better try to settle matters with the compkinant
in the meantime. It was one of the most brutal outrages he ever
remembered; and if a satisfactory arrangement were not made, with
ample compensation to the complainant for bis sufferings and fosses,
he (the Magistrate) would promise the^ prisoners the heaviest punish-
ment he was empowered to inflict."
These observations were followed by applause from the bystanders,
which was instantly suppressed by the Magistrate. It was stated in
the Court that the complainant is a most quiet and inoffensive person,
and that be has a daughter very respectably married is this country.
We condole with her sincerely on the abominable usage which her father
has experienced.
SIR GIOVANNI FALSTAFF.
less thee, Bottom, bless thee!
thou art translated !"—
But whether into High
Dutch, Portuguese, French,
Feejee, or Italian, Peter
Quince doth not inform us.
Still we really should not
wonder if, some evening at
the Opera, we be intro-
duced to U Dolce Braso
Bottom. That certainly
wouldscarce soundstranger
in our ears than Sir Gio-
vanni Falstaff. Imagine
plain Jack Falstaff being
dubbed Sib Giovanni!
Conceive his being spoken
of as qitesto grasso Cava-
litre! Fancy hearing him
complaining of the scurvy
trick played on him by le
Mogli Scherzanti, and his
describing in a recitative
how they had half smothered
him net cetto del bucato;
and then only think of his
calling to the tapsters," Ola
da ber port ate — dov' i'l
mio sack!""
Assuredly " plump Jack"
is one of the last persons
we should have ever
dreamed of seeing appear
as an Italian, and warbling
a duet. But Shakspeare has been acted everywhere of late, and one
can surely no more wonder to find him at Her Majesty's than to see
him at the Vic.
As presented at Her Majesty's, the weakest part in Falstaff is Sir
John himself. O that Lablache the Great had lived to play the
character! What a jollity would he have thrown into the part, and,
even without padding, how well he would have looked it! Still Falstaff
(barring Falstaff) is most creditably "executed," as the slang phrase
goes, and a special word of praise is due to Phaulein Tietjens, who

is the chief executioner. They who have heard her best in tragedy—say
as Norma or Lucrezia—might doubt if she could play one of the sprightly
Merry Wives. But let them go and see, and then if they have any eyes
they will soon see that she can; and if they have any ears'than what II
Dolce Bravo Bottom possessed in his translation, they will certainly
discover that she can sing her part as sweetly asishe sprightly performs
it. The other Moglie Scherzante too is treally vastly pleasant; and,
thanks to good Signor Arditi, who does not drown the voices to show
how fine his band is, the music of Sir Giovanni can be heard throughout
with pleasure, though Giovanni, Sir, in spite of his rotundity, has not
such solid stuff in him as Giovanni, Don.
INTENSELY SYMBOLICAL.
We have a friend who is great in mathematics. In fact he is so
wrapt up in them that he converses solely in mathematical language.
He addresses communications to his cousin, Ensign A., of the Fifth,
"n sin 'a." He is equally precise in other matters. Finding; him one
morning deeply immersed in Lunar Theory under the inspiration of the
fragrant weed, we asked him how he could possibly read and smoke; to
which we received answer, "That he was one of those men who con-
sidered that the pipe and cymbals (symbols) harmonised." Speaking
to him of the fate of Henry the Eighth's wives, he observed,
that with regard to Anne Boletn and Catherine Howard, it was
certainly a case of "oblique axes." Since which we have quite
despaired of reforming the excentric Angle."
A Barbarous Name.
Br a letter from St. Petersburg we are informed that —
"The Gband Dcke Michael, brother of the Eupekor, Lieutenant of his Majesty
in the Caucasus, and Commandant of the troops stationed there, will for the future
bear the title of Commander-in-Chief (glaTnocomandouyoustcby)."
The sound of "glavnocomandouyoustchy" may be laughable, but its
sense is no joke. To us " glavnocomandouyoustchy" seems only a hard
word, but the unhappy people who are subject to the satrap so denomi-
nated probably find his tyranny hard lines.
THE BEST NEWS TOR MANY A DAY.
The combined flotilla of the Empebob of Austria and the King
op Prussia has been defeated.
So have the troops of the King of Dahomey.

A SCENE OF HIGH COMEDY.
Last week a deputation waited upon the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in order to call him to account for his real or supposed
share in causing the departure of Garibaldi at an earlier date than
was pleasing to divers persons who had intended to hook themselves on
to the Italian Liberator during the progress he had originally designed
to make through the provinces. The deputation consisted of persons
whose names are nearly all unknown to Mr. Punch and to the public,
but Mr. Gladstone received his visitors with the most preternatural
affability, and the following is a slightly condensed report of the
interview:—
A Mr. Beales. "We thought that you wanted to see us.
Mr. Gladstone. "Well, no, that is not it. But you may ask me any
questions you like, and I may mention that I have read a speech by one
of you, called Shaen, which contains statements that are untrue.
Mr. Beales. He says they are not.
Mr. Gladstone. Bxally. But as nobody but Garibaldi and myself
were present at the interview Ma. Shaen pretends to describe, I don't
know how he means to support his allegations.
A Mb. Shaen (of the Irish persuasion) then made a statement.
Mb. Gladstone explained what had really occurred, and declared the
rest of the story to be "absolute invention. He, on the part of eight
gentlemen, had told Garibaldi that he had undertaken w hat would be
perilous to his health.
Mb. Shaen believed that the General believed that pressure had
been put upon him.
Me. Gladstone had told Gabibaldi that fables were abroad, and
therefore had made an explanation in the House of Commons.
Mr. Shaen said that people were under an impression.
Mr. Gladstone. People should not get under impressions. There
was such a thing as being too clever and outwitting oneself. 1 Lord
Aberdeen used to say, that he had a habit of believing people, and it
was a very good habit. He, Mr. Gladstone, detested an atmosphere
of suspicion.
A Mr. Odgers. The working class are not satisfied. They had
nothing to do with his keeping bad hours, as they always wanted to see
him between six and nine in the morning.
Mb. Gladstone. Why couldn't you leave him to rest in bed?
Mr. Odgers. He said he was well enough.
Mb. Gladstone. I can't go into the question of liis health, bat
there is Db. Febgusson's letter.
A Mb. Baxtee Langley. Being in the Medical Profession myself,
I consider that letter unprofessional.
Mb, Gladstone. Dear me, are you, and do you? But I really
cannot go into that subject.
Mb. Beales. The excitement was pleasureable.
Mb. Gladstone. Do you think so?
Mb. Baxter Langley. The people think that you have been made
a tool of.
Mb. Gladstone. Eeally. "Well, now, I tliink Gabibaldi did right
to forego the tour. No man, not even Lord Palmerston, could have
gone through the proposed work.
Mr. Shaen. Lord Shaftesbury was told by Garibaldi that he
hoped it was not expected that he should tell a lie.
Mb. Gladstone. I know nothing about that.
Mr. Baxter Langley. The Queen's name has been mixed up in
the matter, and reports are about tending to diminish the popularity of
the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Mr. Gladstone. People might be considerate enough to remember
that the Prince and Princess are not so happy as I am, and cannot meet
estimable deputations and defend themselves.
Mr. Beales. Well, on the whole, we think that you have been explicit.

TALK FOR TRAVELLERS.
Should we not touch upon
Equestrian dialogues, having
done with Pedestrians?
The Hone presents at once
a subject for remark, and re-
moves all difficulty in opening
a street conversation. Whe-
ther you understand a horse's
points, or not, is of no conse-
quence. A. is on horseback,
and B. is on foot. If both
were pedestrians they would
be at a loss for a topic, merely repeating some few of the inanities,
which have been, in these papers, so often reprobated. As it is, B. is
the first to speak, and either placing his hand on the horse's mane,
if near enough to the kerb, or critically examining his hoofs, he says,
"That's a nice animal you've got there."
B. calls him an animal, as if uncertain whether it is a cow, a pig, or a
buffalo that his friend is bestriding.
"Yes," replies A., slightly stooping forward, and patting the horse;
"he's not bad."
"A very nice nag," says B., who will not commit himself to parti-
cularising, by calling it a mare, or a horse. He would probably like to
venture upon saying something about a cob or a filly; but as names of this
sort are likely to lead the user of them into the difficulties of an un-
known country, he adopts the safer course of generalising.
"Have you had it any time?" he inquires. Observe that B. does
not venture upon saying Him or Her. Of course it is perfectly imma-
terial to him whether the horse has belonged to A. for one, seven,
fourteen, twenty-one, or any other term of years.
"Yes," says A. vaguely, being quite aware that whatever information
he may give is a matter of not the slightest interest to his interrogator;
"I've had him some time." He then adds in an off-hand manner,
"He suits me very well."
This is to give B. to understand that his opinion, whatever it may
be, will have not the slightest weight with A., and therefore B. need not
trouble himself to form one.
"Yes," returns B., "he looks a good, useful,—er—sort of —er—"
B. has some difficulty in finishing the sentence: he doesn't like the
sound of " horse." Mare, from his friend's conversation, is evidently
not the word; and it sounds insulting to call him a beast.
So, after a few seconds of er-er-erring, during which he eyes the hind
quarters, he happily hits upon a way out of his muddle.
"Yes," says he. making a sort of corrected copy of his speech, "a
very useful sort of creature."
I only hack him," observes A.
"Ah!" returns B., as if this was exactly what he had expected.
"You don't ride much yourself, eh?" asks A., feeling that it is his
turn to start afresh.
Mark what an absurd form of question this is. B. either rides or he
does not. B: he rides, he rides, himself; whether much or little is not
to the purpose. It is himself who rides, when he does ride.
"No, not much note," answers B.
By this B. would imply, that, at one time, he used to keep six horses
at least, and ride every day and all day.
"Going into the Park?" asks B.
"Yes, I think so," answers A., hereby implying that his friend can't
suggest any better destination for an equestrian.
T< Well/ says B. '* Good by.e."
The horseman only nods a farewell, and so they part company.
The above dialogue, translated for general use, will run as follows,
and should be learnt by all Equepedestrian Conversationalists :—
B. I see you are on horseback and I'm afoot; but you're not a bit
the better for all that. I speak to you because I rather like to be seen
talking to a man showily mounted.
A. I permit you to stop and talk to me, because I feel some sort of
pity for your situation on the pavement.
B. I don't know anything about a horse, but it's not worth while
abusing it, so I mav as wellsay it's a nice animal.
A. My dear B., 1 don't care a rap for your opinion one way or the
other, but, as you say it it a nice animal, I do not mind informing you
that you are right.
B. 1 should like to find fault with him it I could, and, I've no doubt
but that a horsedealer would tell you the brute isn't worth sixpence;
yet, as it in no way concerns me, I repeat that it seems a very useful
sort of creature.
A. Yes, and you would be. very glad to have such an one yourself.
I don't think you can ride, 1 'm pretty sure you can't afford to keep,
or hire, but I '11 just flatter you, my poor fellow, by asking you if you
ride much yourself? I '11 stop for your answer merely out of indolent
politeness, only I hope you will give it as quickly as possible, because
I've really had quite enough of you.
B. You 're not acquainted with my means, and ior aught you kuow,
I can ride as often as I like; however, as you have never, to my know-
ledge, seen me when mounted, it will be as well to answer that I don't
ride much now. As an impertinent fellow like you, may ask
certain other needless, but uncomfortable, questions, I will suggest your
pursuing your road immediately, by asking if you 're going into the
Park.
A. I am, because that's what I came out for; but I shall mot say so
for certain to you, or else you '11 make a point of following and nodding
to me in Rotten Bow, or waylaying me at the corner of the Drive.
Ta-ta mv poor B., I am for an Equestrian Swagger among Equestrian
Fellow-S"waggerers; for aught I care, while I wave my hand and smile
cheeringly upon you, you may go to the blank. Ta-ta.
My Mission is accomplished. Henceforth I will be silent; oyster-
wise. Dumb until, that is in good Latinity, dumb, dum the voice of
necessity evokes again the Social Prophet and Beprover.
Farewell, my Pedestrians of Piccadilly. Remember my lessons, short

question.

THE LUCK OF MR. SPURGEON.
Under the heading of "A Valuable Dead Letter," a newspaper
paragraph, the other day, related a good story about Mr. Spurgeon,
to the effect following. Mr. Spurgeon, like a sensible man, is in the
habit of declining to take in letters which are not prepaid. One
amongst the epistles rejected by the reverend gentleman having been
opened at the Dead Letter Office, was remitted to him with a state-
ment that, being anonymous, it could not be returned to the sender,
and that it contained something valuable. On this hint, Spurgeon
accepted the letter on the usual terms. It enclosed a £20 note. He
will probably take care in future how he turns away any note from his
door, and at any rate we shall ever observe that caution. Now,
here is a chance for any person really gifted with clairvoyance. Whoso-
ever can engage to tell, by that faculty, whether an unopened letter
contains a banknote, may be assured of lucrative employment at 85,
Fleet Street. The clairvoyant shall receive half the amount of every
note so discerned in any unstamped envelope that may be sent to Punch.

THE DEFKAUDED OF DELHI.
Delhi will have fallen seven years ago come next July. Will the
captors of Delhi have been by that time paid the prize money which is due
to some 3,000 of them? As yet they have received only the first instal-
ment of it, and nothing whatever subsequently to the payment of that,
one year and eight months since. The interval has been occupied by the
Government with an inquiry into what it calls "contingent claims."
So much is stated by one of those who, on this pretence, have been kept
out of their money. According to this complainant, who writes to the
Times under the signature of "The Father of One who Fell,"
the soldiers, whose valour is rewarded by protracted delay in rendering
them their portion of its fruits, are getting impatient of the treatment
which they thus experience at the hands of the nonsolvent authorities.
He says that "More than one regiment has threatened that, if called
out for active service, they would protest against going till its claim
was satisfied." The Government perhaps thinks it a good joke to
recompense the troops who quelled a mutiny by driving them to the
verge of mutiny themselves. The following extract from the letter
above-quoted will show how the Delhi prize-money is paid, when any of
it is paid at all:—j,

offer them a small bribe was first admitted, while those who bad no cash to spare
were obliged to wait."
To give a man the trouble of going seven miles eight times to get
£8 12s. is to do what is calculated to discourage him from continuing
to go for the money. If this persevering person had not persevered,
had stopped at the seventh journey, and, instead of going ,the eighth,
had given up his demand as a bad job, he would have done that which
those who gave him all that trouble apparently wished to make him do.
He was fubbed off and fubbed off, like Dame Quietly by Falsiaff, and,
for all that is visible, with equal honesty. It is inconceivable how the
redtapism, "contingent claims," can be any other than a shuffling'
excuse. If contingent claims did not prevent a first instalment of the
Delhi Prize Money from being paid, in what way do they prevent the
payment of another, or the whole? Why is the money to De paid at I
long intervals, as a dividend is declared out of a bankrupt's estate f
Does Downing Street do business after the manner of Basingnall Street?
If Downing Street is not the quarter infamous for not paying the'
soldiers, what is that which is? is it Whitehall, or do Whitehall and
Downing Street divide the infamy? Base are the knaves who do not
pay what they owe, and whv are the rogues who retain the money they
are bound to administer like a musical instrument P Because they are
double-base. And who are they who retain the Delhi Prize Money F
Some gentleman in the House of Commons will perhaps ask the

Godfather to the Crystal Palace, and having in that capacity care-
fully tended it from the erection of the first iron to the ena of tne last
concert, and being moreover on the whole tolerably well satisfied with
his god-child, Mr. Punch has received, not without emotion, a circular
upon one subject which has always given him pain. I
There is no doubt that the Refreshment Department at the Palace
has been the Blot on the Transparent Escutcheon. No civilised person
ever thinks of dining there. Yet it would be the pleasantest place near
London for the great business of life, could that business be per-
formed with befitting rites. How delightful it were, to the husband
whose occupation keeps him in town during the day, to appoint a
meeting at seven, at the Rosery, with her whom he has sworn not only
to cherish hut to nourish, and with whom, sweetly smiling at his punc-
tuality, he might proceed to the brilliant saloon, or the quiet cabinet,
feast, tastefully, yet not extravagantly, and then, emerging into Sir
Joseph's lovely gardens, send up the only cloud that should come over
the happiness of good-tempered persons in easy circumstances. How
pleasant for the father of a couple or a leash of bright-eyed daughters—
for the manly and kindly-bantering son of an attached mother—for the
attentive nephew of two not unendowed and non-evangelical aunts—for
the lover of a graceful maiden and (for the time) of her placid Mamma—
to finish a charming promenade in that Palace with either a merry, calm,
or sentimental repast, according to idiosyncrasy. But hitherto the thing
has been impossible.
Not, Mr. Punch repeats, without emotion, has he received a touching
Circular or Communication, stating that a new era has commenced.
Two new Men appear upon the scene. He knows nothing, literally
nothing of them, but their names are of good omen. One is called
Bertram, a name dear to the admirers of Robert le Biable, and the
other is called, not Robert, but Roberts, a name that hath been borne
by many good men. and by no bad men that we remember. Let us
overhaul their manifesto.
They promise Important Improvements. Mr. Punch assures them
that the field is almost unlimited.
New Dining Saloons, adapted for from four to thirty people. Thirty
be hanged, but a room for four will hold Mr. and Mrs. Punch, and he
often wants a room that will hold eight, and never sits down with more.
Roberts is, personally, to superintend the cuisine. We like the
word " personally." It would be pleasant to us to know that he had
kicked a cook, pour encourager les autres. Let him be stern, and never
make an excuse for a cook under any circumstances whatever, except
the non-punctuality of guests, whom, under such circumstances, we
hereby authorise him to insult, blandly. A cook is the slave of Time,
and owes his chief allegiance there. In any other case of complaint,
let the cook's second offence be his last.
The Tariff will be arranged with Moderation. All very well, but
cheapness is dearness if nastiness be present. Charge reasonably for
ood viands. We do not want a slap-bang on Sydenham Hill, neither
o we want to pay as at Richmond, where a season hath three months
only. We will dine with you all the year round if you will make it
worth our while.
"The Wines have been selected from the best cellars." We shall
take the liberty of testing this statement before we offer a remark,
beyond saying that we have drunk,—at least tasted—wine—at least
fluid—whereof we can only say that we have no doubt that it was
selected from the best cellars, to be got rid of, as we select weeds from
gardens.
"Allsofp's Pale Ale. Barclay and Perkins's Porter." These
be good words ; pace Mr. Banting.
The Refreshment Counters will present 'an increased display of
fight refreshments." Well, an improvement on dry sandwiches and
stale sponge cakes is conceivable. "There will be greater quickness
of (attendance." Hitherto, so far as Mr. Punch has observed, the
waiters either quarrel frightfully, or converse confidentially, and in
neither case is the public a gainer. "The Tea and Coffee will be of the
highest character." We never tried the tea, but, urged by unwise
women, have three or four times ordered what was called coffee, and
though it might be good enough for ladies at the Crystal Palace, no
high-minded gentleman at penal servitude would praise it. Mr. hit-
timer would have said that it did him good to be tried with the coffee
of affliction, and Mr. Uriah Ileep would have said that it was 'umble
stuff and we ought to be 'umble. When one thinks of the coffee in
Paris—Bom!
Well, Punch is true to his god-child, and gladly gives it this one more
chance in regard to Refreshments. It is the most important question
connected with the well-doing of the Palace. Make the Crystal
Dinner a London feature. We shall be down, incog, one of these fine
days, and our report of the proceedings shall be as frank and outspoken
as has been our welcome of the promise. Shall we not take our ease in
our Crystal P $?&NC$.

"ASKING FOR MORE."
The poor Custom House officials are clamouring for
more pay, and no wonder, when their salaries have re-
mained unimproved for twenty years. Mr. Punch feels
that the time nas come when we should mend our Custom,
our Manners having advanced with the age. The Custom
House clerks ask to be put on a footing with their
brethren of the Inland Revenue, and why should they not?
It is by no means the custom of Mr. Punch to underpay
any of his Civil Servants who do their work well, and he
hopes the Government will listen to the unanimous and
forcible petitions which have been presented in shoals to
Parliament, and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
will loosen the strings of the public purse, and enable the
deserving and hardworking Customs officials to live in a
decent and respectable way. Those collecting twenty-
four millions of money must feel the tortures of Tantalus,
when they see "Money, money, everywhere, but almost
none for them;" whilst their more fortunate confreres in
the squandering departments of the Civil Service receive
respectable salaries.
THE RECRUITING SURGEON.
We are not as yet at war, so that there is no extraordinary number
of legs and arms in the Army requiring amputation, nor do any bullets
need to be extracted from the bodies of any British soldiers, except
those engaged in fighting the Maories, not to mention the blackamoors
of Ashantce, who fight shy. What is there,' then, to account for this
advertisement, which has appeared in the Times ?—
ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 6, WHITEHALL YARD, 22nd April, 1864.
ACTING ASSISTANT-SURGEONS being REQUIRED, tor temporary
service with the Army in tho United Kingdom, gentlemen duly registered to
practise niedicino and surgery under the Medical Act of 1858, and desirous of
obtaining such appointments, may apply immediately to the Director-Genoral for
the printed form required to be filled up by every Candidato previous to employ-
ment. They will receive pay at tho rate of 10*. a-day, and allowances equal to those
of a Staff Assistaut-Surgeon. Gentlemen are not eligible for theso appointments
whose age exceeds forty years.
J. B. GIBSON, M.D., Director-General.
Whence the pressing demand for Army Surgeons, manifested by the
foregoing notice? Simply, from the revocation, at Head Quarters, of
the Royal Warrant of 1858, which assured Surgeons in the Army of
suitable relative rank, proper precedence, and the social position due to
gentlemen. The faith thus pledged was coolly broken by certain other
orders called the Queen's Regulations, issued in 1S59, wliich rescinded
the Queen's Warrant of 1858 with a dishonesty most derogatory to
Her Majesty's name, audaciously connected with them. These new
arrangements, dictated at the instance of the so-called "combatant"
officers, provided that the medical officers should rank as civilians, and
be treated as snobs. The consequence is what has necessitated the
above advertisement. There is a surgeon-famine in the Army. Men of
education refuse an office which subordinates them to a lad who is pos-
sibly a contemptible puppy. Service in the Army, instead of being sought
through the ordeal of a competitive examination by spirited young
Surgeons, has to be importunately tendered to practitioners of the ma-
ture age of forty. Their practice must be very unprofitable if they can
gain anything by exchanging it for temporary employment in the Army.
When the gallant combatant officer, who insists that his Surgeon shall
be a snob, comes to have his leg removed, or a bullet extracted from his
hip-joint, he will perhaps lament that the operation has to be performed
by an operator for whom Dr. Gibson, the Director-General, was reduced
to advertise, in his capacity of Recruiting Medical Officer.
Colonel North, in a late debate on the Estimates, stated that there
were two hundred vacancies for Army Surgeons the other day, and that
only six candidates presented themselves for examination. If war
ensue, and the Duke of Cambridge, in action, should unfortunately
receive any injury needing surgical aid, it is to be hoped that the Sureeon
who shall render that aitf to his Royal Highness will be one of those
six. In the meanwhile, perhaps, the restitution of the Royal Warrant
of 1858 will relieve Dr. Gibson of the necessity of touting for surgeons
to job the Army.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 19. Thursday. It seems hardly worth mentioning, but a form is
a form, as the boy said when he knocked his shins against one,
and the Berkleian usher said it was no matter. The Commons
re-assembled after the Whitsuntide holidays, and then did a much more
sensible t hing—they adjourned almost immediately.
Friday. Again the Commons met, and Lord Palmerston appeared
among them after his illness, and was received with all acclamation.
Some talk on foreign politics elicited the facts that the Government do
not intend to interfere in China—unless it seems expedient so to do-^
and that the very objectionable Ashantee war is to be concluded. This
latter news is satisfactory.
For the Use of Schools.
(By a Cockney )
Why should not Dr. Watts' Poems be read by youth?
Because they contain Hymn-morality.

AN ADVENTURE WITH THE PAPAL BRIGANDS.
His Holiness the Pope, the other day, gave utterance to some
very fine sentiments touching the atrocities committed by order of the
Emperor op Russia on the insurgent Poles. The subjoined state-
ment, however, in a letter from the Times' Correspondent at Naples,
would seem to show that the Holy Pather shines much less brightly in
practice than he does in preaching with regard to nationalities asserting
their independence:—
14 It is a very speaking comment on the evil influence which Rome exercises in
this province, that brigandage is now confined almost exclusively to the Basilicata
and Terra di Lavoro, which latter district borders on the Papal States, nero fresh
bands are reported continually, while in the Basilicata, under the direction of
General Pallayicini, they are exterminated."
Torture and murder, to say nothing of cannibalism, as practised by
St. Cipriano di Gala and his companions in bonds under sentence of
martyrdom, appear to be, in the estimation of his Holiness, one thing
when perpetrated in the service of the schismatic Czar, and another
when performed in that of the faithful ex-King op Naples. However,
be that as it may, the Pope's privileged robbers are not so much more
brutal than savage beasts as to be incapable of being mollified by the
charms of music. So, at least, it appears from the sequel of the fore-
going statement:—
11 A curious story is told of the capture of a tenor named Gcolielmi, when on his
road to Potenza, to sing in the theatre of that city during the Carnival. Full of
apprehension, ho resolved on trying the effect of his voice, and sang a romanza of
Vfhdi. The band were delighted, treated him with great attention, and made him
rich presents; but it was not till after a captivity of two months that he obtained
his liberty, and then his hair was white, although he was only twenty-five years
of age."
Here is a safe plot for an Opera. All the regular elements of a
popular lyrical drama are present. You have an adventure among
brigands, the hero of which is himself a singer. He mollifies the
ruffians into whose hands he has fallen by the charms of song. The
action takes place amid Italian scenery. A dance of the bandits with
their female associates absolutely introduces itself. So does a drinking
chorus with a burden of tric-trac, or snick-snack, or something equally
sensible, and a peasant girl's ballad, with as wise a refrain of tra lira la.
A vesper hymn, illustrative of the piety of the papal freebooters, is
equally a matter of course. The author of the libretto will only have to
provide the hero with a heroine, whom he ultimately marries, his
whitened hair having been completely restored to its previous colour by
Rowlands' "Incomparable Macassar." The Opera might be entitled
The Tenor among Thieves, and, out of compliment to the patron of
Messrs. La Gala & Co., it should be dedicated to the Pope.
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.
Remarking on the Prince of Wales's graceful address at the
Literary Fund dinner, a daily contemporary says—
"A dedication to some illustrious personage will no longer sell a dull volume;
and the compliments of My Lord or his Graco would l«3 wholly inefficacious to
induce Meksrs. Longman or Bradbury and Evans to become the publishers of a
work which had not its own merits to recommend it."
We are not in possession of authority to make any statement on
behalf of Messrs. Longman, but we are sure that in all transactions
they would be guided by their accustomed good judgment. But
Mr. Punch may possibly have had some slight glimpses into the minds
of the gentlemen last mentioned, and may be justified in saying that
"compliments " is a word of elastic meaning, and that if that word
accompanied a manuscript transmitted to those parties by a real
nobleman, they would not think of insulting the aristocracy by limiting
the significance of the syllables. They would be held to mean that his
Grace guaranteed the entire expenses of the work, and a sale to himself,
if not to the public, of at least 50,000 copies. If a work were entirely
unobjectionable, therefore, the "compliments" of a nobleman would
certainly procure its publication in Whitelriars, and Mr. Punch may
mention this, on the part of his friends, as a modest aristocracy may at
present be debarred from publishing much which would appear were the
exact cost ascertainable.

"Yes, there was no Escape for it; there was Adolphus Muffyns, of the
External Amalgamation Office, on the Outside of a Hornsey 'Buss, in a
Lock on Ludqate Hill, just over Mrs. Swellington's Barouche."—(Extract
from an unpublished US.)
PLAY IN PUBLIC OFFICES.
The attention of the Ministry is hereby directed to the expediency of immediately
supplying the Government offices with billiard-tables. A painful shock has been
inflicted on the feelings of all who sympathise with the right sort of people, by
Lord de Grey's dismissal and degradation of the 'clerks in the Accountant-
General's Office for playing at chicken-hazard during office-hours.
Lord de Grey, however, can hardly be much blamed for this act of severity.
It was almost if not quite necessary, for doubtless the gambling in the Accountant-
General's Office would have come to the knowledge of the Opposition, and then,
unless the parties implicated in it had important Conservative connections,
the Earl of Derby in the House of Lords, and Mr. Disraeli in the House
of Commons, would of course have made a fuss about it in order to damage the
Government.
It must be admitted that chicken-hazard, blind-hookey, and pitch-and-toss are not
exactly fit kind of games to amuse the leisure of gentlemen in public offices. But
that leisure is very abundant. In the Accountant-General's Office, for instance, they
have nothing more to do than to examine slightly voluminous accounts from all
parts of the world relative to stores, pay, and allowances of all kinds; to check,
arithmetically, the expenditure of the fifteen millions which the country has to pay
for its military establishments.
Therefore, it is a mere vulgar error to suppose that the business of the nation
is neglected by Government clerks when they amuse themselves with games of
chance. Nobody but-a Snob suspects that the delay in settling "contingent
accounts," and distributing the Delhi Prize-money, can have arisen from any such
cause as chicken-hazard. Ihe hours between ten and four must necessarily be most
of them vacant hours, unless employed somehow otherwise than in official labour.
It is not every clerk who has the inclinationlor the ability to devote those vacant
hours either to the study or the augmentation of his country's literature, or to any
other profitable pursuit. The nails of clerks employed under Government do not
grow so fast that those gentlemen can find a constant resource in paring them. So,
to keep idle hands out of that mischief which, according to Dr. Watts, the
Personage who is now at the Klxg of Prussia's elbow ever finds for them to
do, the Government has no choice but to furnish its officials with the means of
innocent recreation, such as billiards, except the option of providing them with
work instead of play.
MAY GROANS.
(From a Sensitive Londoner, with a tendency to Dyspepsia,
and a hatred of Conventionalism, Poetry, and
Humbug.)
Oh, May is here! Yes—May is here—
It's called " sweet spring-time of the year"—
And asses one knows are going about,
Remarking " the chestnuts at Bushy are out"—
If they had their own way. I haven't a doubt
They d see London somethinged before they'd
To serve the Cockney snobs for a show.
I cant say I've known much that was sweet
In the Mays I've passed in our " quiet street."
It's either been sultry and stifling and steaming—
(Oh, Lord! there's that baby next door screaming)—
Thermometer eighty in the shade—
Such weather may suit the baking trade—
With the flags red-hot to one's wretched soles,
And one's butter melting without hot rolls;
And one's meat getting high as one's spirits get low—
And even one's sky-blue" on the go—
That '■ what most idiots mean when they say,
"I call this a most delightful May!"
I admit 'tisn't often one has to complain
Of the want of cold, and wind, and rain;
For most of our merry months of May
Are wretched in just the other way.
Frost at nights, with hot sun and east wind by day—
A nice state of things for people like me,
To whom an east wind is misery!
I certainly do remember Mays
That were wretched in very various ways;
But a May that answers the poet's description,
As far as / know, is absolute fiction.
Besides, leaving weather out of the question,
And all its effects on health and digestion—
Supposing rheumatism not to exist,
Ana lumbago not there with its twinge and t wist,
And bile and bronchitis, and cold and catarrh,
'Mong the things that were, not the things that are—
I ask you what are the joys of May,
As known to London, at this time o' day P
Is't in the May Meetings at Exeter Hall,
Where fanatics snuffle, and brag, and bawl,
And strait-laced Christians pitch into each other,
About some humbugging scheme or another f
Or, leaving saints, and turning to sinners,
Is the joy of the month in its public dinners ?—
With their poisonous wine and their horrible dishes,
Their dish-water soups and their flabby fishes,
Stale entrees, and roasts half cold, half raw,
And pastry that should be forbidden by law,—
Their forced subscriptions,—licensed robbery,—
Their long-winded speeches,—organised snobbery,—
Their puffy toast-masters, oniony waiters—
Exasperating exasperators,—
The steam and the smell, and the hurry and heat,—
The stuff you must hear, and the stuff you must eat!
It may well be the "merry month of May '•'
With a public dinner every day!
Or is it because the London Season
This month attains its height of unreason . . .
Its balls, where there's no room for dancing,
Its Rotten Row, too crowded for prancing—
Its routs where your best luck's to stick in the door;
Its Operas and Concerts, where music's a bore;
Its Derby drags, with their cargoes dreary
Of dupes and demireps, brazen and beery;
Its stuck-up dinners, that set you gaping,
Where every snob his betters is aping;
As if a la Russe could excuse or explain
Green-grocers and gooseberry champagne,
Or the sin of bad dishes, at undue hours,
Were the less for being disguised in flowers.
For which of all these pleasures, say,
Must I hail the " merry month of May?"
Perhaps in the country there may be Mays
With a better right to the poef s praise:
But what to me are the birds elsewhere,
Who hear the organs in street and square:

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
Y dear Punch,—
If managers run
pieces only while
they draw, and if
the merits of a play
have anything to do
with its attractive-
ness to playgoers, I
doubt if the two
Comedies which
have lately been pro-
duced will be found
to hold the stage
for many hundred
nights. It charmed
me as a playgoer to
hear that two new
pieces were about
to be made visible;
but the gloss went
off the charm when
I learned that they
were both of them
. - _—-y. adapted from the
\ Cii™" French, and more-
over were adapted
^s^j^~~^=s"— both from the same
play. I had smacked
my lips beforehand
to think what doubled relish I should have for the] two novelties; but
alackaday! the entrees were stale and richauffees, and there was the
same flavour at the bottom of them both. Of the one served at the
Haymarket, Punch hath already spoken, and with justice, in dispraise;
and I need but add a word to hint that David Garrick, even if he did
get tipsy, was too much of a gentleman to stumble against ladies and
tumble on their laps. Of the piece at the St. James's—which is less
obnoxious in some sense than the other, as the name of a great actor
is not taken in vain in it—I cannot say I think the reputation of its
author is advantaged much by having this "new" Comedy of his
dragged out of the obscurity where it has been hidden for some half-a-
score of years. As a critic who writes anything that is not compli-
mentary, will soon be as rare a creature as a Dodo or a Phoenix, I beg
to prove that such an animal is not yet quite extinct, by quoting
what the Morning Advertiser says—and very sensibly withal— anent the
Foxchase :—
"Such a play is of the stage most stagey; and Mr. BorrciCAni.T has shown bis
utter contempt for anything but getting a laugh at bis generally smart dialogue, or
exciting by some surprising sensation. Actual character, human probability,
natural coherence of conduct, ho seems to consider as antique and pedantic requi-
sites of a drama. To push along and keep moving, and if possible to excite, are tho

about his Tercentenary; that's all over, thank goodness! and bis birth-
day may be kept for another hundred years without a blare of penny
trumpets and a blaze of fireworks—Shakspeare was no scholar, so
his friend Ben Jonson tells us: and it may indeed be doubted if he
ever went to school. • His "small Latin and less Greek" he picked up
nobody knows where: and perhaps to read and write in his case "came

do things that a common mortal can't. I fear young Ltjbberlye for
instance, would never find much Greek or Latin come to him by^instinct,

went to school, yet there are ample reasons why a school with
Shakspeare's name to back it should be started, for the good of the
profession to which himself belonged. The project has been fairly set
afoot by Mr. Webster, and it remains now for the public to make it a
success. Subscription lists are open for this new public school, which
will differ from the old ones in so far that it will give a gratis education
only to the children of those living by the stage. Actors, as a rule,
have many claims upon their pockets, and can't afford to send their sons
to Charterhouse or Harrow, where they would not be cold-shouldered,
as the chance is they may be at "little snivelling private schools." So
I hope the Shakspeare Eton will flourish and succeed; and assuredly
the names (the Provost of Eton foremost) that appear in the Committee
list, are a sufficient guarantee that the scheme deserves success.
One who Pays.
P.S. I must just add one word to say that people who remember how
charmingly Priscilla Horton used to act the dainty Ariel, and to
warble' Where the bee sucks" may once again hear her sweet voice in
it at the Gallery of Illustration, where she and Mr. Reed now have
some pleasant Shakspeare music after their return from Egypt every
evening, and before dear Mrs. Roseleaf gives her charming "little
party."
"PAPER-PA-i^A."
On Saturday last the Inaugural Dinner of the Newspaper Press
Fund took place at the Freemasons Hall, and the Chairman was Lord
Houghton, whom, in connection with literature, we prefer to call
Mr. Monckton Milnes. His speech was in admirable taste. The
Fund needs no recommendation, but everybody who reads a paper
ought to send a contribution, and the names of all the best men of
what Mr. Carlyle calls "the writing sort" are guarantees for the
due administration of the institution. Mr. Punch will only say, that
to those who do not support this association, and have not
real and valid excuse (not an Income-Tax excuse, but one satis-
factory to the conscience), he wishes all sorts of newspaper evils.
For instance. May their paper be late, or not come at all, when
there is most interesting news. When they have been presented at
Court, may their names be left out by mistake, or may an error
make the world believe that it is their hateful cousins and not
themselves who have been honoured. If any of their family get into a
scrape and come before a Magistrate, may the case be reported in full,
and if the wrong-doer should be in the lamily of some very dear and
particular friend, may the report be omitted. May any marriage they
put in be printed wrongly, and Smidjtiie be reduced to plain Smith.
May Supplements often come to them instead of the inside sheets. If
they live in the country, may the local postmaster always steal their
paper to amuse his Sunday. May their contributions to charities be
published in shillings instead of pounds, and when they write complaining
letters about anything, may the Editor either omit them, or put in a
jeering title to the letter, and, by mistake, the real name and address.
There—cordially wishing them all this if they do not support the
Newspaper Press Fund, we cordially wish them the exact reverses if
they do.
A FRAGMENT BY MR. R. BROWNING AND THE
PRINTERS.
The Observer, the other day, rebuked Messrs. Clowes and Sons,
Printers of the Royal Academy Catalogue, on I he liberties taken by
them with the metre and punctuation of Mr. Robert Browning's
Fragment, descriptive of Leighton's picture of Orpheus and Eurydice,
which, thanks to the Printers, or Mr. Browning, is as follows:—
"But give them me—the mouth, the eyes, the brow. Let them once moro absorb
me I One look now will lap me round for ever, not to pass out of in* light, though
darkness lie beyond I Hold mo but safe again within tho bond of ono iinmorud
look I AU woe that was forgotten, and all terror that may be defied ; no past is
mine, no future 1 look at me I"
"Look at me," indeed! We looked at the fragment until we became
quite dizzy. The darkness certainly does not "lie beyond us" at
present. Is it Orpheus, or is it Eurydice, who requests the loan of the
other's mouth, eyes, and brow'( To be absorbed in a mouth is simply
suggestive of cannibalism! And although we ourselves have ere this,
had many nice girls in our eye, we should object to the absorption of
the bodily presence of the brawny Orpheus "in that precious sense."
Can any lawyer of our acquaintance frame a Bond of an immortal look
for us? We are anxious to see the party without any past or future,
and would, out of charity, give him a present to console him. If the
printers are to blame, surely Mr. Browning will avenge himself by
giving them " one look that will lap them round for ever.

THREE CHEERS FOR BASS AND HIS BARREL OF BEER, AND OUT WITH THE FOREIGN
RUFFIAN AND HIS BARREL-ORGAN!
THE FALSE START.
From our Political Turf-reporter.
I have only time for a line about that false start of Gladstone's,
which has caused so much talk. The fact is that this jockey is nearly
the cleverest fellow out, and as you know, he's quite up to the Greeks,
and not to be done when tin's in question. ( Nobody rides neater, and
though he keeps the whip pretty quiet, he makes it felt when he does
use it. But there are wheels withui wheels, and on that Wednesday,
when the New Franchise Stakes were run for, it was expected that he
would ride Procrastination, and make a waiting race of it, lo and behold
there he was on democracy. I suppose it had been squared among the
nobs, but nobody thought that Gladstone, of all jockeys, would let a
horse bolt with him. Bolt he did though, and all the shouting in the
world was no good; he never got the nag's head round till he'd past
the U.S. (universal suffrage) post, when he pulled up. I need not
say the Baines lot were radiant at getting Gladstone into their
colours, but though he showed his horse's points he did no more, and
when the struggle came, Democracy was pumped out, and Previous
Question came in previously, by many lengths. Gladstone has been
blamed by some who have the pluck to cheek him, which everybody
hasn't, but he says he knows what he's about, and does not keep all his
eggs in one basket. He adds that one of these days he '11 show some
folks the way to take the lead and keep it, and I dare say he will.
Clear Enough.
A Provincial journal says, "We observe that some Scotch writers
actually advocate the street-organs, which are found such a nuisance in
civilised cities. We cannot understand this." Our provincial friend is
dull. Street-organs supply a noisy and rather a coarse amusement—
and one which can be got for notlung. Ergo, Sawney likes them.
University INTELLIGENCE.—The Great Lights of the University of
Cambridge are the Two Moderators.
FROM A GRATIFIED SWELL.
Dear, Punch, Conservative Club.
I don't often write letters, or bore myself in any way more
than I can help, but I must say that I think a great benefit has been
conferred upon good society. I mean by the way the Times has to-day
adopted with the names in the Births, Marriages, and Deaths column.
That printing the leading names in big letters, don't you know P
Declare to you I haven't, looked down that column for years. The
class of folks that, because they have the half guinea, or whatever it is,
to pay for the printing their names, have been pleased to advertise their
domestic arrangements, have made the list perfectly offensive. Swear
to you, a fellow read out at breakfast the other morning that the land-
lord at the "Pig and Whistle" had married the barmaid from the
"Cow and Cucumber." What the deuce right have such canaille to
compel me to take notice of their concerns, just because I want to see
whether anybody I know has been and died or anything?
Times don't go half far enough, and ought to exercise a censorship
about these notices, and not send all over the civilised world the
important information that an attorney's clerk's lady has presented him
with an attorneylet, or that a butcher respected in the parish (is tbat
R. I. P. ?) has transmitted the chopping block to his successor. Or they
might put this sort of thing by itself, and keep a separate part—conse-
crated ground—for us. But it's something to print the names in big
letters, as one learns to skim them, like a butterfly, and miss the in-
fernal hollyhocks and cabbage roses, and settle on the tulips and
camellias—pretty image that, old fellow. I tried it in a quadrille, and it
went no end.
Can't help thinking that your notion for a fourth column, for Divorces,
ought to be taken up, for a fellow never knows who he's talking to in
these days, but all in good time. I've a right to be glad of this approach
to reform, for the Times that had my marriage with Ladt Annabella
in it put us between the marriage of my tailor and that of her mother's
upholsterer, and we nearly had a row at Windermere because she
thought it was my fault. Knows better than to make any rows now,
but the moral's the same. .

PUNCH'S DERBY PROPHECY.
Always ready with a Prophecy, my bloaters, when the Derby day cornea round,
likewise when it comes square, as I hope it will to all of you, and as I'm sure it will
to such of you as put your trust and confidence in your only true and lawful prophet
one and indivisible, like the French Empire, except that that's divided into two
parts, Paris and France, eh, M. the Minister of Lost Elections? But never mind that
at the Derby—Lord Derby has lost elections before now and behind then, and
yet 111 bet Malmesbcry's English to Johnny Ross ell's French, that my Loan
Rupert never sulked over it. Revenons A nos moutons, which means let us come on
to our horses. Birch-Broom turns up first Of course he is good in a Sweep, (ha !)
but a birch to be of any good, must come behind othor things. New brooms sweep
clean, and I have no doubt of many pockets being swept with the utmost cleanli-
ness. Next comes Coast Guard. Now, the bxislnoss of that personage is not o much
running with spirit as preventing spirits being run, but then we don't always all
mind our own business, or everybody's business would be minded, and the Golden
Ago would come bock and Austria Redux and all that. And a Coast Guard is
always ready at a signal. On we goes to Paris. How do you do, our American friend,
and how are your light heart and ten pair of—yes. Sir. Now yew calculate as a
Yankee razor, sharpened in Paris, will just shave All England, you guess. Wall—
only don't knock your head agin it, and then say it was me. Baragah is an offen.
sively obscure name, and comes from the savages who use boomerangs, but when
the bell rings he may be thought a bel Salage. On Ely I see the odds taken frce-ly.
Mr. Cartwriqbt's namo is a good one for a dentist, but does the horse under-
stand Stopping T Now for Blair Athol. Blair's Sermons are stupefying, so is
Athol broee, but that doesn't make no odds, you fool, as the ghost politely re-
marked to the young lady who objected to bo buried on the frivolous ground that
she wasn't dead. Well, bloaters, Blair Athol, liko my heart, is in the Highlands,
but you see these are Epsom Downs. fftc timothy rue temmery be your motto.
Copenhagen was peppered by Nelson, and also carried Wellington very well at
Waterloo, but is now getting old. However, he comes out of the Danes'bury stable,
which is consistent in him, and he is half bred, and a half bred is better than no
loaf, my loafers. What's a Holly-fox—& sly cove who gets in all his Christmas invita-
tions and chooses the best, or is it Yorkshire for Halifax? 1 can't find it in Ma.
Charles Knight's English Cyclopaedia, and anything that isn't there, isn't worth
knowing. He belongs to Valentine, so we '11 see whether the Derby Day in future
shall be called Valentine's Day. If so, won't the Falmouth bells ring, my dear lord
of Tregothnan? Historian is a good name, and historians are long-winded, though
they don't get over the ground quick. Prince Arthur came to grief over a wall—
mightn't have done so over a hedge—don't you. King John was in the list, and if
he had run, Prince Arthur would, I should think, have done all he knew to get away
from his sanguinolent uncle, but uncle'» scratched, and nephew lacks the domestic
stimulus. As for Forager, I was challenged by a rival poet to make a rhyme to his
name. I shut up the pump in a minute; for says I, "If the brute will not start, I
me&n Forager, call some eminent counsel—don't scoff; Serjeant Ballantine, shrewd
Mr. Orridoe or, Serjeant Parry will soon gtt him off." There's rhyme, no extra
charge. Isaak Walton won't get me in a line, and Dormouse ta&j roll up. Then. Idler,
well, dulce est—to be an idler—in loco, but there 'e a motive to be locomotive at Epsom.
I don't seem to see him In front. If you ask me what Ackworth is, I reply to you with

may do something if the jockey will behave better to him than Kino Charles did,

Apennine,says Shelley; but shelling out on him's another matter ; and though
the racing folks insist on spelling him with two p'a, he may not bo as right as two
pease. However, Appenine comes of a good stock, though clearly not an Alpen-
stock. I shall look at Planet through my telescopo, and may find him near the
Pole. Master Richard's mamma is called Energy, and 1 think he will show himself
a lively little boy. A word in your private ear—notice Privateer. Then there's a
horse called Windham. This Is such a common name now that they might as well
have called him Smith. His mother was a Fright; but he may be a beauty.
Warrior, if like his nautical namesake, can't bo selected as a cockboat; and
as he belongs to a nobleman called Bateman, I hope he '11 run as well as Leah.
American associations naturally lead me to Washington (there is a Southern
American Association, called an army, which may, spite appearances, lead Gene-
ral Lee there one of these days), and ho is the son of Charleston, and, like
another Charleston, finds "no takers." I next name Sans Change, who may
leave his friends' pockets so. Dancing out of France Into Spain, like Doctor
Forster'b pupils when they had been whipped, I perceive Guerilla, but if you'd
called him Gorilla, I shouldn't put a monkey on him. Major and Miner may pair
off together, and be blowed, or, if you Insist on a complete syllogism, my third propo-
sition is that wc should now liquor. That's better, and having wiped my mouth
with cambric, I take up Surat, merely to say that I' don't cotton to him. Ho was
formerly called Rthoboam, who was the son of Solomon, who is not In the raco,
though •Solon is, a horse from the isle of wisdom, need I name Oireland? If he
gives much law he '11 lose, even if ho gives it to Outlaw, who will bo proclaimed any-
thing but winner. He must be rather a pirate than an outlaw, for he carries a
Cannon. Signalman will not, I think, be seen at the poet; Rappel's name certainly
implies beating, but for bis mamma's lovely name, Hesperithusa (I shall call my
next daughter so), I wish him luck. Take off your hats, for here are Cathedral and
East Minster (what's that about Nave's-mire, knave ?), but I am not one of the
choristers who sing about tho former, and as for the latter. As I was going over
West-Minster Bridge, I met a West-Minster scholar; He pulled off his hat, And-
Drew off his glove, and wished me a very good morrow, and you may apply the
verse, and ask your children his name, which you have told them in the affable
little recitation. Regarding Wardance, my dancing days are over (though I should
like to make Colonel Wauob dance to an accompaniment of my own performance);
but this Indian dance was usually executed around the stake of a victim,
and Victim was Wardance's dam, and he may get the stake if he can. Peon, pro-
nounced pune, has also Indian proclivities; but I fear this poor Indian has .an
untutored mind, and through Epsom mists will not see much behind. Touching
Alpheus—well, c'itait primitxvement un chasseur, says M. Quichekat, and he muBt go
at a quicker rate than I think he will if ho is not still found following something
else. Jack Frost is out of place in May, and won't be in a place at the finish, and
the Knight of Snowdon, who is one of (Walter) Scott's lot, will also, I fear be
a Roderick Doo. Then there is an anonymous article, the Hersey filly, but I
fear this JUet d'Hcrsey will not bo in great domand among the horsophagi.
Now, my beloved bloaters, what shall wo say to Scottish Chief? Is his heart
in the Highlands too, or is yours in your highlows? Tia good to bo Merry
and wise, To get of the race a good view, /Tis good to eat Fortntjm'b
game pies, And drink hock, if you're asked so to do. Still remember, the
Scottish Chiefs was written by Miss Porter, and some persons may miss porter
and find only small beer. The difficulty as regards Cambuscan is that Chaccer
accents the last syllable, and Milton the second, and are we to follow Johnny or
Geoffrey. No consequence? Why, you everlasting outrageous insensate owl and
hippopotamus, are we not speaking of a horse, and is a question of feet of no con-
sequence? By Jovel By Thor I By Seeva I By Buddha 1 Cambuscan may
rhyme with Tuscan, or Cambuscan may rhyme with Mart Ann, and I had rather
rhyme than reason with Mary Ann, or any other of her delightful gender. But,
not to Leave untold The Story of Cambuscan bold, I think he will win if a certain
obstacle does not prevent him. Lastly there Is General Peel, in honour of whom

I will tell you whether you will let mo or not, that when Shakspeare made
Thersites observe "Did not The General run then,1' Shakspeare (who knew Peele
well) knew what ho was writing about. After what I have said, my bloaters, you
would be nothing better than herrings, mere soldiers, heavy dragoons, if you wanted
any plainer indication of the winner of the Derby for 1864, but I will just add that,
as you see, his name is in fact the same as that of yours perpetually,
THE EXCELSIOR BILL.
The well-known song, Excelsior, always reminds us of a climbing boy,
though with this difference, that, whereas its hero reaches the mountain
top, the sweep is likely to be stifled half-way up the chimney. But
Excelsior ought not to remind us of climbing boys, at any rate of those
who climb chimneys, as the employment of such chimney-sweeps was
prohibited by Act of Parliament twenty years ago. This Act has, how-
ever, come to be evaded to such an extent, that more than three
thousand children are still kept at labour in the filthy and unhealthy
slavery of chimney-chmbing. The kidnapping of little boys for that
servitude has even been revived, and it appears that the children used
in sweeping chimneys are not boys only. At a meeting, lately held at
York, with a view to the suppression of this cruel usage, or abuse, of
infants, the following agreement was signed by the assembled Sweeps:—
11 We, the undersigned Master Sweeps of the City of York, mutually agree, from
and after this data, not to employ Climbing Boys and Girls in our business; that
tho Act of Parliament on their behalf made should be strictly complied with; and
that we ought no longer to risk tho heavy penalties it prescribes, both against house-
holders and ourselves."
It thus appears that, in York at least, the employment of climbing girls
has become almost or quite as common as that of climbing boys. It is
enough to say against chimney-climbing that, besides its nastmess, and
its obvious cruelty/ it is the cause of a malignant disease—for which see
Cooper's Surgical Dictionary under the head of Cancer. Well, then,
the Earl op Shaftesbury has introduced into the House of Lords a
Bill for the effectual protection of children from Master Chimney-Sweeps.
Amongst other provisions well, calculated to accomplish this purpose
there is one whereby—
"A chimney-sweeper convicted of compelling, or knowingly allowing, a person
under 21 to ascend a chimney, or enter a flue for sweeping it, or extinguishing fire,
may be sent to prison for a term not exceeding six months, with .or without hard
labour."
With hard labour, by all means. This clause, if enforced, will prac-
tically do pretty well, as there are very few adults of the dimensions of
Tom Thumb, and those few possess so great a fortune in their own
littleness, that they can be under no temptation to climb chimneys for
a living. Of course Parliament will take care to pass the above-quoted
Bill: and then the Excelsior movement will have to be practised by no
Sweep except Master Sweeps, offending against the statute enacted to
restrain their brutality. Tliey, indeed, will practise the movement,
without making the ascent, which " Excelsior" implies, on the treadmill.
A Fat Angel.
A Critic in the Morning Star says that he has always been accus-
tomed to regard Sir John Valstaff as—what do you think? "A kind
of fallen Archangel." Well, that did not occur to us, even when we
saw Mr. Phelps lying on the ground after Shrewsbury fight. But
there is authority, Falstaff's own, for the idea. "Your ill Angel is light
—he that looks on me may take me without weighing." Still, a fallen
Archangel! However, a fallen Star should know.

Old Lady. " Well, I'm sure no Woman wtth tiie least Sense of Decency would think of going down that wat to it.'
MORE MATLOCK CODICILS.
(By Special Express Telegraph.)
Matlock, Monday, 12 a.m.
In addition to the new Codicil that tumbled out of the bed, which, by
a remarkably lucky coincidence, was purchased by Mb. Else's brother-
in-law, another has just been found in an old bird cage which used to
contain a favourite canary of the late Mr. Nuttall's. It bequeaths
£150,000 to Ma. Else, who is to look for it till he Cuds it.
Half-past Four.
Another Codicil has been discovered. A farmer's bay, going home
after work, went bird-nesting, and fell down a disused mine-shaft, at the
bottom of which he found a warming-pau, containing a new Codicil, in
which Mr. Nuttall bequeaths the Peak, Derbyshire, with all the
Satanic scenery, to Mr. Else. The poor boy is very little injured, as
the depth was only eighty yards.
Quarter-past Nine.
A fresh Codicil has turned np. Some men digging in a field near
Mr. Else's, found an enormous large turnip, which they wantonly split
across with their spades, and out came a bottle, containing a Codicil,
by which Mr. Nuttall bequeaths Chatsworth to Mr. Else for life,
remainder to the Duke of Devonshire. An ejectment has been served
on his Grace.
Half-past Twelve.
Wonders will never cease! A heavy shower of rain choked up the
gutters of a house next door to Mr. Else's, and a man went up to
remove the obstruction. In doing so, he found an abandoned nest of a
magpie, and in it a brass tobacco-box, covered with bladder, and on
this oemg opened, there were found nine fourpenny pieces, and a Codicil
giving Mr. Else eighteen houses in Sheffield, and a sack of potatoes
said to be lying at a pawnbroker's in that town.
Quarter to Three.
Again accident has contributed to justice. A female cottager near
Mr. Else's had complained of severe pains in her inside, and thought
she should like some warm beer. Expressing this wish in the hearing
of Mr. Else's cook, the latter kindly fetched an old sauce-pan to warm
the beer in. On opening this, a Codicil was found, enfolding some
poor man's plaister, also some corn-plaisters, all of which are devised to
Mr. Else for life, with cross-remainders over to the most deserving
inmates of the Matlock Union.
Half-past Seven.
No more Codicils have been found up to this hour, but public opinion

Quarter to Eleven {night).
A most singular and almost melodramatic discovery has been made.
Evening Service had been held at Matlock church, and a young woman
fell asleep in one of the pews, and was locked in. There are ghosts in
her family, so she was not frightened, but made herself a comfortable
bed in the churchwarden's pew, with the cushions. Under one which
sha removed, she found a Codicil, which she hastily read by moonlight,
and immediately rang the bells, and on the astounded sexton opening
the door, she rushed over him and out of the edifice. He is likely to
recover, and so is Mr. Else, for the new Codicil gives him one side of
the principal street in Derby, and all the onions in the testator's
hayloft.
Seven (morning).
There are rumours of more Codicils, especially of one which is said to
have been found in a washing-stand drawer, and which is reported to
contain sixteen hundred spade guineas and a tooth-brush, but I abstain
from sending particulars until I can verify them.

A CARD.
A Political organ declares with a sigh
That reformers are rightly for indolence blamed,
And that what we all want is A Very Good Cry
Of which no class of citizen need be ashamed.

That the article wanted has come from Judtea;
And now may be had every night, about VIII,

THE JOIHT-STOCK BUBBLE COMPANIES BUBSTING-
UP ASSOCIATION.
Preliminary Meeting of this
excellent Society was held
t heothcr morning at Phillis's
Rooms, for the purpose of
electing a working Com-
mittee and, of determining
the mode by which the ends
of the Society might best
be carried out. As many
as one hundred and eleven
ladies were present, the ma-
jority of whom were recog-
nised as being the sisters,
wives and daughters of gen-
tlemen well known to be of
speculative temperament,
and who may be regarded
as the principal supporters
of new joint-stock oubble
schemes. After a discussion
of some matters not quite
relevant to the objects of
the meeting, such as the
Crystal Palace Flower Show
ana the last new shape for
bonnets, Mrs. Prudence
Smythi was voted to the
chair, and in opening the
business proceedings of the
j, the Chairwoman observed that the aim of the Society was to
promote the bursting-up of joint-stock bubble companies. (Hear.) She
need hardly tell the ladies whom she saw before her that the production
of these bubbles was daily on the increase. Nearly every lady present,
doubtless, had to read the paper to her husband or papa, or, if not
required to read it, had (which was worse) to listen to it while he read
it out to her (Cries of *' Yes, dear!" "Oh, it's horrid ! ") Now they
knew that the first thing their pas and husbands looked at, or asked to
have read out to them, was that odious dry stuff about the City and the
Money Market. (Sighs and groans.) Instead of reading about the
Court, and what the Prince op Wales did yesterday, and matters
which a lady would consider of chief interest, what their pas and
husbands wanted was to hear about the funds, and to know if things
were "getting easier" or not, and whether such and such a bank had
been "going up or down," and what was the last price that so and so
was "quoted at." (Titters.') Some ladies might smile at tins masculine
propensity, but she (the Chairwoman) considered it to be no laughing
matter. They might depend on it that men who seemed so anxious
about money had not much to spare of it, and, when a husband appeared
nervous about the price of shares, his wife might feel assured that he
had made a bad investment. (Nods of assent, and a Voice, " Quite true,
dear!") Now the aim of the Society was to discourage speculation,
and restrain papas and husbands from blindly running into it. She felt
sure that female influence, if properly directed, might do much towards
this object, and, by dissuading gentlemen from venturing their money
in insecure "securities," might by degrees relieve the country from
the speculative schemes which persons without principle now found it
to t heir interest to endeavour to promote. (Murmurs of applause and
much tapping of the floor with the sticks of parasols.)
Mrs. Aspenne said she trembled to t hink what would become of her,
if sometliing were not done to keep her husband from the City, where
she knew he must be losing mints and mints of money every time he
went to it. (Sensation.) Her nerves were in good order before he
took to speculating, but now the slightest tiling would put her in a
quiver, and every day at breakfast time she really 9hook all over when
she handed bin the Times. (Great sympathy, and several cries of " Oh,
poor dear !") She had observed that lie looked pale whenever certain
names (which she believed were'those of some atrocious bubble schemes)
were mentioned in his presence, and she had heard liini cry "confound
it!" on several occasions when he looked into the newspaper, and once
he used so violent and terrible an expression that it very nearly threw
her into a fit, (Cries of " Oh, the brute I")
Mrs. Seedie said they saw in her a victim of imprudent speculation.
Her husband when he married, had a tolerable income, or she would
not have had him. (A Voice, "Quit* right, dear; I wouldn't.") In an
evil hour, however, he was tempted by a friend to put some money in
the Sunbeams out of Snowballs Steam Extraction Company, in which
his money as quickly molted as the snowballs would have'done. To
retrieve his loss, he joined the Chickweed and Groundsel Sub-Sea Cul-
tivation Company, and when this had likewise failed, he rashly placed
the small remainder of his property in the General Oceanic Highway
Lighting Company, which was started for the purpose of lighting up
the sea, by means of gaslamps placed in it a hundred yards apart, just
fancy, all over the world. (Titters.) This scheme succeeded only in
making light the purses of those who were investors in it, and now ne
makmg light the purses of those who were investors in it, I
husband was so poor that, as they saw, his wife was scarce fit to be
seen. (Sensation and a shrill Voice, "No, she really isn't.")
Mrs. Greymare said her husband never speculated. (Cheering and
cries of" What a darling duck I") She should like to catch him at it.
(Laughter). If she did so, he might rest assured that he would have no
peace untd he desisted. Thank goodness, the had a strong mind, and
she would take good care she wasn't ruined by his weak one. (" Tkat's
right, dear ! ") She thought that married ladies had the power in their
hands, or rather in their tongues, to keep their precious husbands out
of speculative messes. A course of curtain lectures, if properly
administered, would in most cases be found to act as a deterrent; and,
when a husband had been making a great donkey of himself in some
fine bubble speculation, she would recommend nis wife to treat him
with her sourest and sulkiest of looks, and to lose no opportunity of
saying sometlung stinging, especially in company. (Hear.) In this way,
husbands might be taught to spend their money on their wives, as by
rights they ought to do (applause), and not to waste it in imprudent
and reckless speculation.
Miss Peacock, who was most extravagantly dressed, and wore a
crinoline of mute a score of yards in its circumference, said that really
nobody could tell what she had suffered from these horrid bubble com-
panies. Her Pa at one time used to give her a new bonnet once a
quarter, and a new frock every month (A Voice, "Oh my I hoie delight-
ful !"), and when she wanted a new ball-dress she only had to ask for it.
(Sensation, and cries of "Gracious me! hotc nice!") But since he
joined sonic dreadful company (she forgot its odious name), he had
behaved in an atrociously mean and stingy manner. Her bonnet, as
they saw, was trimmed with only ribbon, and not one scrap of lace (a
Fotce, "Poor dear! so it is ! "), and she bad actually to exist sometimes
for seven weeks together without getting a new dress. {Great cm
miseration, and cries of " Oh, how dreadful!")
Mrs. Flash ley said her case was worse even than^ Miss Peacock's.
(Question.) Yes, she who, ladies might remember, always used to
pride herself on dressing in t he fashion, had now, as they perceived, to
wear a bonnet made last season and a mantle two years old. (" Dear,
dear, hotc truly terrible!") And all tins misery was owing to those
wretched bubble companies, which it was the bounden duty, she con-
ceived, of every lady to discourage and suppress. (" We trill! tee tetUff)
A year ago her husband possessed a certain income of some £3000
a-year, which, as ladies knew, was little enough to live upon (a Voice,
"Tei, I should think so"), and in the hope of getting a larger interest for
his money, he had embarked iu speculation which had very nearly
ruined him. At the instance of a friend, who was one of the directors,
he first of all invested in the North and South Pole Junction Atmo-
spheric Railway Company; and, when this bubble had burst, instead
of taking warning by ti :ie loss he had sustained, he actually took some
shares in the Popgun and Pegtop Foreign Manufacture Company, and
allowed his name to appear as a director of the Submarine Anemone
Steam Propagation Company, both which bubble speculations had, if
she might be permitted the masculine expression, come rapidly to gnef.
(Sensation.) That was what she and her family were coming to, she
knew, and it would be a mercy soon if they'd so much as common
bread and meat to live upon. Last autumn, instead of going down the
Rhine, she had actually to take her darling girls to Ramsgate; and she
expected soon her pin-mouey would so much be reduced that she woidd
scarce be able to buy a bit of ribbon with it, much less a silk dress.
(General consternation, and a chorus of " Oh, poor thing !")
The Chairwoman then rose and moved a resolution to the effect that
speculation was terribly destructive to the interests of the ladies,
because it tempted men to waste in it what they might spend upon
their wives. The resolution being carried with considerable clamour,
and the meeting having pledgett itself to support the Joint-Stock
Bubble Companies Bursting-Up Association, lunch was ordered in,
and further business was postponed until the .middle of next week. |

The Bishop op London, in the course of a sensible speech, deli-

to take in all classes of working men." As yet this object has been
accomplished by Working Men's Clubs only in a sense not contemplated
by the Bishop of London. The Benefit Clnbs are Working Men's
Clubs, and some of them have taken in the working

glad to see that the following advertiser is a root-and-branch

Garibaldi has published a letter, in Turin, wliercin he
warmly thanks the English nation for its hospitality, and
adds, 'I withdrew when I saw fit to do so, without ceding

out to Caprera to examine the Liberator, and to ask him,
first, whether the above statement is true, and, secondly,
what he means by making them look like the greatest fools
who ever earned notoriety by hooking little names on to a
big name? We admit that for the first time in his life
Garibaldi has done an unkind thing. But patience has its
limits, though folly has none.
A Trifle Too Meek.
Our dear Bishops are not brave. Should another James
the Second arise, we fear that there are no Seven to give
a new Macaulay the chance of writing another such
immortal chapter as that which describes the Trial. The
Earl of Shaftesbury has charged the whole bench with
"a gross breach of duty," and not one of them has dared
to call him to account in the House of Lords. Yet he is
thought to represent the Exeter Hall mind. Either the
Bishops despise Exeter Hall, and its " brav " or they arc
sadly deficient in the courage which should characterise
noblemen. Does a spiritual peer mean a peer without
spirit?
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 23rd. Monday. Lord Palmerston having remembered that
Tuesday was the Queen's birthday, and Wednesday the Derby Day,
mentioned those facts to the House, and proposed that both anniver-
saries should be observed as holidays. His proposition was received
in the most cheerful manner. Nothing else, of the slightest conse-
quence, was said.
Tuesday. Her Majesty completed her Porty-fifth year.
Wednesday. Blair Athol won the Derby.
Thursday. In the House of Lords there was debate upon the conduct
of the Prussians in Jutland, who are revenging themselves, by plunder
on land, for their losses at sea. Lord Russell spoke of arrangements
and promises which are clearly violated. Lord Ellenborough hoped
that the Sovereign imitated George III., and did not allow German
connections to influence her conduct. Lord Russell said that what-
ever Ministers proposed to the Queen, Her Majesty assented to, an
answer which was unfair to his Royal Mistress, because it was a mere
evasion, whereas he might have given a frank and complete reply.
Then the Duke of Buccleuch proposed to let Scotch Episcopal
clergymen into the Church of England, whereat the Bishops had a good
deal to say, and the Bill goes to a Committee.
In the Commons Mr. Hennessy originated a debate about Poland,
and wished the House to resolve that Russia had violated her engage-
ments, and therefore had forfeited her sovereignty in that country.
Lord Palmerston spoke at some length, and agreed that Russia had
behaved tyrannically, but he thought that it would be below the
dignity of the House to pass a resolution which it was not iutended to
follow by any action.
Friday. The Lords (and we are bound to say that all idea of legisla-
tion being abandoned in both Houses, and a scries of conversazione
being instituted instead, the conversations in the Upper House are far
the most piquant and interesting) had a pleasant discussion on Educa-
tion as practised at our Public Schools. Lord Stanhope expressed
himself with much grace and good sense. He would not hear of the
abolition of the study of Latin, wherein he is right, for graphic and
slip-slop writing is far too prevalent, and it is desirable to keep up
something like purity, besides, the interchange of a few words from
Horace is a freemasonic sign between gentlemen previously strangers,
and at once does away with any apprehension of dropped aitches or
pocketpicking. But he thinks that a great deal too much Greek is
taught, and here he is right again, because there are but two Greek
words that anybody need understand, kudos and nous, and most young
ladies, even, are now aware of the meaning of both. Further, he con-
siders that everybody should know French, and for the third time we
have much pleasure in endorsing his opinion, for otherwise people
could not read the Parisian letter in the Realm, which declines to translate
its French correspondent. But as regards the accomplishments which
Lord Stanhope lavours, we are not so sure. Music certainly keeps'a
good many young persons out of mischief, and if not very bad, is almost
tolerable under certain restrictions, and drawing has the same merit,
with the additional one of being quieter; but we incline to agree with the
Times that the great object of education is to teach a young fellow that
he must grapple with matters which are hard to master, even though he
thoroughly dislikes them, and they give him the headache. Loud
Clarendon had something to urge in reply, and defended the recom-
mendations of the Commissioners on Education, who represented that
at Public Schools lads were not.thoroughly grounded even in what it was
professed to teach, and were not able to stand the gentlest College
examination without coaching. Our Schools he thought behind the
age, and though it was not proposed to legislate for them, lie hoped
that the authorities would take the hint. This kind of chat occupied
the hour before dinner, which was announced at a quarter-past seven.
The Commons made a long evening of it, having some eighteen mat-
ters to talk over, but most of them were bores. Complaint was made
by some Irish gentlemen that the Law Life Assurance Company has
acquired a good deal of property in Conncmara, and manages it in a
cold-blooded Saxon way, making the poor tenants pay their rents,

THE CRYSTAL PALACE OPERA.
Being blessed with what is
called "a good ear for music,"
(though which ear is the good
one we can't precisely specify),
we never miss a chance of going
■to the Opera. We rejoice
therefore to hear that a new
Opera is open to us, and that,
as it will be open only in the
afternoon, it will not interfere
with our visits to the old ones.
We have an Opera in a Hay-
market and an Opera in a
Garden (to wit, the one called
Coveut), and this Season we
have also an Opera in a Green-
house. At the Crystal Palace
Concerts Opera music is per-
formed by the best of foreign
artists (if we were a critic, we
of course should say artistes),
and performed as well as eit her
in the Garden or the Hay-
market. At these pleasant
Concerts, too, you sit in cool
fresh air, and not in heat and
gaslight, and you have greenery
to look at. if you have not
scenery. In many scenes,
moreover, the Crystal Palace
greenery is all that can be
wished. There are real flowers there for the garden scene in Faust,
and that is more than you will see upon the stage of Mr. Gye, or
that of Mr. Mapleson.
Thus at the Crystal Palace Opera there is pleasure for your nose as
well as for your ears and eyes; and you hear the sweetest airs of
DoNiZEdii or Mozart,—
"While gales of roses round you rise,"
as Mr. Thomas Moore affirms they did around Anacreon.
So thank you, Mr. Bowley, for your Opera at Sydenham, where one
may pleasantly employ one's ears and eyes and nose from lunch-time
until dinner: after which, if one so liketh, one may take them in the
evening to the Opera in London.

Everybody at table was silent, in order to hear my exposition.
I'd have given anything for a tooth-ache, or a summons on business
that would have taken me out of the room.
Here was a question with a vengeance! "What is the American
War about F"
I attempted to parry, jocosely. "About as bad, Ma'am," I began,
using a very old form of joke, much patronised by my lamented Grand-
father, and preserved in our family, when this She-inquisitor interrupted
me with, "No, Mr. Muddle, I mean what is the Cause of the War P"
Had I been asked the Origin of Evil, I could have spoken well,
knowing that others knew little more on the subject than I. But on
the Cause of the American War! that was quite another thing.
"Well, Miss Vivid," I said (sh/:'s a maiden ladv, affecting a girlish
carelessness regarding everything, but—ahem!!, " Well, Miss Vivid,"
I said, sententiously, You see the North and South" (I was safe so
far), The North and South are—in fact—fighting.'with one another, in
order, ahem—to see which will get the mastery." This was all very
safe, and would have historically suited the Romans and Carthaginians,
Jews and Philistines, English and Maoris, Sayers and Heenan, or
any other combatants.
But," persisted the intelligent female, "which are the Confederates,
and which t he Federals P"
Now this is precisely the point that has invariably puzzled me. How
many times I nave got the fact by heart, I'm afraid to say; but 1 've
always forgotten it again. I wisely answered her thus—
"The Confederates are those who confederate together—from two
Latin words, con and federate: and the Federals are those who don't
j con-federate, but are Bound by a Fadus or treaty."
"Yes," said she, " but are the Northerners the Confederates, or the
Sout herners?"
The eyes of the dinner-party were upon me.
"I must do something to save my character," I said to myself.
Boldly assuming an air of incredulity—" What!" I exclaimed, "You
do not mean to say that you don't know?"
"Well," she began, apologetically
Directly she fell into this strain, Hhe game was mine. She was a
weak soul, and I triumphed. Sir, I refused to give her the required
information, on the score that she ought to ascertain it for herself from
the Papers. At this moment, an old gentleman stepped in good-
naturedly, and said
But 1 beg your pardon—this is not what he said, but what / say—my
intention was to nave given you a general article ou social, political,
polemical, and moral subjects.
Sir, if my memory serves me fairly, I will write to you upon the very
first opportunity.
TOPICS OF THE DAY.
{General, Political, Polemical, Moral, Social.)
It is a long time since I treated yon to a general article on the cur-
rent events of the day. I then told you, if you will refer to the Number
(which it is, I forget), that I was blessed, or otherwise, with the very
shortest memory of man, which seems always to be running to the con-
trary. That is a legal phrase, you know, and exactly expresses my case.
Talking of cases, I must say a few words about America. Of course,
one has to converse on this unhappy subject continually; but although
I manage very fairly, I have never thoroughly mastered the events.
The other day 1 came into my club, and anxiously inquired for the
Second Edition of the Timet. I generally do this as early as possible in
the afternoon, and then somebody is sure to say, "Eh! whatp Second
Edition P Any important Telegrams from America P"

Pooh, pooh, no thanks—there, take your hands out of your pockets, I want no
*' trifle of your Winnings," dear bloaters. When I give you a piece of sporting
information I do it out of sheer generosity and good-nature, and not for the sake of

MY BUTLER.
A TALE OF PBIDE AND PUNISHMENT.
TART I.—PRIDE.
Now if there be, as I believe,
Foul spirits in the air,
Who grin to see us mortals grieve,
Ana dance at our despair,
They must have had a special treat,
And shrieked with prescient fun,
"When, in a somewhat obscure street,
I sought for Mrs. Grun-
dy's office, where, my Paper said,
I could not fail to find
Servants, in every virtue bred,
Both male and womankind.
And when "come in" my rat-tat4at
Evoked at 73,
There in a pleasant parlour sat
Dame Grundy at her tea.
Ah, never, since, in days long fled,
My boyhood did perspire,
Applying surreptitious bread
To unpermitted fire,—
Never such toast my wistful eyea
Had lit with hunger's glow,
And, in my gladness and surprise,
1 told Dame Grundy so!
"Might she presume?" "Oh, surely, yes,
Nor formal words begin;
One sniff of buttered toast like this
Doth make the whole world kin."
She pointed to a cushioned chair,
And from her mantel-shelf
She took, and wiped with dainty care
A cup of shining delf.
There, in a cozy corner snug,
I gave myself to tea,
'Till, hke the cat upon ner rug,
I purred with pletho-ry.
And then to business—first we had
A plaint of dole and woe,
Of servants going to the bad
As fast as they could go.
So changed, so lapsed to foul disgrace
Since that more virtuous age,
"When no one ever left their pi
And rather liked low wage.
We spoke of butlers who had passed
Their lives in one pan-try,
And left their little all at last
To the Infirma-ry.
Of cooks, high-principled, whom gay
Butchers could ne er allure;
Who weighed each joint, and gave away
Their dripping to the poor.
Cooks, who ne'er scowled with sullen ire,
When friends to dine dropped in,
But smiled, their " faces all afire
With labour," not with gin.
Of happy housemaids, passing fair,
But as cold Dian chaste,
Who nor by lads nor laces were
Compressed about the waist.
No charm from Nature's lovely 1
They ever sought to rob:
Nor added to what she defines,
Save that sweet cap, called "Mob."
And then from those pure halcyon days
In which Dame Grundy served,
To modern servants' wicked ways
Our conversation swerved.
I spoke of Ladies-maids I'd met
On other peoples' stairs,
And bowed to them as of our set,"
They gave themselves such airs.
I quoted "Punch:"—what pencil could
On " Flunkeyana" preach—
Sermons in stones, or rather wood,
Like thine, delicious Leech!
But when I asked, "Was "Virtue dead,
And whether Grundy knew
Of ana honest folk?" she said,
"Well yes, there was a few. .
"There was a few, and though, perhaps,
She didn't ought to say,
And meant no nasty sneers nor snaps
At Smith's across the way—
"But fax was fax, which scorn she should
A gentleman deceive,
And, asking parding, hoped I would j
A widdy's word believe,
"That of all servants, most renowned
For conduct and good looks,
The names and ages would be found
In Martha Grundy's books."
What joyous news! my tongue, inspired
By trustfulness and tea,
"Could she then find," at once inquired,
"A butler fit for me?"
"Fust, would I kindly please to state
What wages there was guv P
For" (with a smile, said Grundy's mate)
"The best won't sarve for luv."
A transitory smile, for when
Of " Forty Pounds" I spake,
Her lineaments relapsed, and then
She gave them all a shake.
"Nothink fust-rate," she, pitying, sighed,
"Which well beknown it is,
Could at that figure be supplied,
So salaries was riz."
"She did know one, perhaps I might
At fifty pounds engage,
A tip-top man, a treasure quite,
She'd knowed him from a page.
"Knowed him as footman, valet, in
The best of fami-lies;
An under-butler last he'd bin,
Right Hon. the Earl op G.'s."
Ah, woefraught words! for one of those
Grim spirits in the air,
Who love to gaze upon our throes,
And dance at our despair,
Heard them, and stooped with fiendish hate,
To whisper in mine ear;
"You'd like to have a man to wait,
Who'd waited on a Peer."
"You'd like to see your table set,
And envious friends to view,
With novel taste, reserved as yet
For noblemen and you.
"You'd like your buckskins soft and white,
Instead of hard and stained;
You'd like your 'tops' to gleam as bright
As laurels when it rained.
"You'd like all offices performed,'
As for la haute noblesse,
Your champagne iced, your claret warmed,
Your 'things' put out to dress.
"You'd like," he paused: the Angler saw,
His float to bob and dip—
His bait was in my wretched maw,
His hook was in my hp!
EYES EIGHT, VOLUNTEERS!
It is a mistake to suppose that the gallantry of our brave Volunteers
does not, for the present, expose them to personal danger. A letter in
the Times from "A Surgeon to a London Hospital," pointing out
the mischief done by cheap percussion caps in putting out the eyes of
the boys, and likewise and otherwise injuring the Cockney sportsmen
and all who are accustomed to use them, has received, in the same
journal, the following corroboration from a witness who signs himself
"A Volunteer :"—•
"The percussion caps supplied with the ball cartridges Issued the last two years
to Volunteer corps on exploding, are attended with exactly similar results as the
supposed cheap caps described by your correspondent. Instead of, as formerly,
expanding only upon explosion, the caps now fly into two or three and even five
pieces. 1 was standing a few days since about three yards to the right of a friend
while firing kneeling, and was struck by a piece of an exploded cap, which cut
through my trousers and fetched blood. I found tho piece adhering to the cloth.
On another occasion I saw a man struck twice in the course of an hour In the face
while firing, laying his cheek open."
The caps denounced in the Surgeon's letter to the Times, instead of
being made of good copper, are composed of a cheap alloy, which is
brittle, and, when the cap explodes, flies about. That such caps should
be supplied to the public by manufacturing scoundrels is too much of a
piece with the reckless rascality prevalent amongst the present race of
commercial men to excite any wonder. But it is astonishing that the
officials employed by Government to supply the Volunteers with proper
ammunition are not more careful or competent than to supply them
with percussion caps by which they run an imminent risk of having
their eyes destroyed every time they use them. We should like to
know whether the issue of these cheap and bad caps is the result of
beggarly economy somewhere, or villanous fraud. If, as is likely, a
long time elapses before this evil is reformed, Volunteers, if they value
their eyesight, will in the meanwhile buy then* own caps, and save that
sight without which there is no use in sighting their rifles.
Salmon or Whitebait?
A Court of Aldermen will shortly be called to take into serious
consideration the question whether or no it is expedient to promote the
breeding of Salmon in the Thames. It will be recollected that some
weeks ago a Salmon token about the mouth of that river was found to
be full of whitebait, which were supposed to have attracted him thither.
Now if, in case there are Salmon in the Thames, the Salmon will eat up
the Whitebait, the question will be between Salmon and Whitebait,
and this is the momentous one which their. Worships will have to decide.
court dress.
Gentlemen should go to Court in knee-breeches. If you have
any conscientious scruples on this matter, a compromise may be
effected by tucking up your trousers. This is not perhaps generally
known.

. YET ANOTHER AMERICANISM.
"Here, Maria, Hold my Cloak while I have a Fling with Stranger!"
REVERSING THE PROVERB.
A FABLE, BY JOHN (PUNCH) GAY.
That oysters may be crossed in love
Is, well we know, the law of Jove,
But hear the poet, and you '11 find,
They 're also troubled in their mind.
Bold Bethell, now a noble Peer,
Of brow serene and tongue severe.
Had ordered lunch, and at his wish
A dozen natives graced the dish:
Fat, juicy bivalves, fresh and white,
Fit for a Judge's toothsome bite,
The ale was pale, the bread was new,
The butter delicate of hue,
A slight but nourishing refection,
Not interfering with reflection,
But formed to silence inward groans
While plaintiiFs counsel bores and drones.
Withdrawn to his retiring room,
Erst used by Eldon, Lyndhurst, Brougham,
His Lordship cast his robe aside,
And with content his luncheon eyed.
"Here's my Refresher in the cause,
And better earned than Jabbjek Jaw's."
He said, the tiny trident reared,
And the first fish had all but speared,
When, vertical upon the board,
An Oyster thus addressed my Lord,
Not in a whistling timid key,
lut in a voice well-trained at sea.
"Ho! Equity's great guard and friend!
Attention and assistance lend."
Unblanched as was Pelides' cheek
When his own horse began to speak,
Was Bethell's face. He slightly backed:
"Move, but confine yourself to fact."
"My Lord," the Oyster said again,
(Edging away from the Cayenne)
We ask relief, nor singly come,
But in the name of Oysterdom.
Too long, my Lord, a proverb old
Links us with justice missed, or sold,
Too long we've been the ribald type
Of all who'd give the law a wipe,
And now we hold it fitting time
That you should quite reverse the rhyme.
Why should an Oyster's fate recal
Two suitors cheated of their all?
Why should dull fools the Oyster quote
As tumbling down the lawyer's throat?
My Lord, our state is one of trouble,
We heave, we hiss, we spit, we bubble,
That we, aristocrats of food,
Should always suffer jeers so rude,
So beg that you, whose powerful hand
Protects all Natives of the land,
(And land, as well your Lordship knows,
Is where the ocean ebbs and flows,)
Will take some measures to abate
The nuisance of our grievous fate,
And cancel the injurious saw
Which thus describes the end of law :—
'A shell for him, a shell for thee,
The Oyster is the lawyer's fee.'
So make your Orator your debtor.
Orator, if you like it better."
He ceased, arranged his beardy fringe,
And sank upon his widowed hinge.

The Keeper of the Conscience smiled:
Paused, and replied, in accents mild:—
"From many a Silk and Stuff in there,
From many a politician rare,
From many a Lord, profane, divine,
I've heard much worse harangues than thine.
The only drawback I would state
Is that your rhetoric's rather late.
Of two greats blots I've sought to purge
The law. and meet the views you urge.
The Rick I've helped with measures bold,
And land is cheaply bought and sold:
The grim Conveyancer is crushed,
His dusty webs away I've brushed,
And those who '11 learn my simple rules,
May save large costs—who won't, are Fools.
The Poor are now my earnest care,
The workman hath enough to bear,
Nor scoundrel tallymen shall join
"With bailiffs for his hard-earned coin,
And low Attorneys, long his dread,
Shall now beg coarse but honest bread.
Henceforth the rhyme that carries smart
To my poor Ojster's oozy heart,
Shall in another fashion run,
And thus be passed by sire to son:
'The Oyster where it ought to be,
And shell and shell the lawyer's fee.'"
Again he smiled, so says the fable,
And drew his chair up near the table, .
When all the Oysters, seen and hid,
Cried, "Eat, and welcome." And he did.

THE STREET-NUISANCE REMOVAL BILL.
ake Notice,—Gentlemen of
the House of Commons,
next year there will be a
General Election, and such
of you as entertain a wish
to keep your seats, had
better take good care to be
found in them next Wed-
nesday, that you may help
to pass the Bill which Mr.
Bass has introduced to
relieve us from the misery
inflicted by street-music.
Haply there be some of
you who, living in the
country, where a street
band or a banjo is a plea-
surable excitement, or else
studying and sleeping, (the
words are oftentimes syno-
nymous) at the back of a
town house . so big that
no street-noise is heard
through it—there be some
of you, I say, who may
doubt if a mere hand-organ
can ever prove a nuisance.
Indeed some of you,
perhaps, may entertain a doubt if street-musicians still exist, since you
yourselves so rarely hear them. To guard against your being misguided
by these doubtings into giving a wrong vote, Mr. Punch begs to inform
you that fifty street tormentors were met the other morning in but
naif an hoar's walk, within a very little distance from his own official
residence. Mr. Punch knows an eye-witness who will (if he be. asked
politely) make affidavit of this fact,* and Ma. Bass, may make what
use of the intelligence he pleases, when he moves the second reading
of his Bill. "'
;- So, Gentlemen, now's your time to secure your next election; and
here s a little song which you may sing next week in chorus, when you
go into the lobby to vote for Ma. Bass :—
Here's to the Member whose Bill Punch hath seen,
And its purport most thoroughly sifted:
'Twill surely receive the assent of the Queen,
When through Commons and Lords it hath drifted.
Let the Bill pass,
Vote for brave Bass,
The man who'd encourage street-music's an ass.
* Deposition taken before worthy Mr. Punch In the Court of St. Bride:—On
Tuesday, May the Seventeenth, while walking from the Elephant and Castle over
Blackfriars Bridge to the foot of Ludgate Hill, at eight o'clock, a.m., I met the
■following band-itti, vie. ;—
39 Barrel Organs.
1 Monster ditto, drawn by pony.
2 Dirty little whistling boys, each with a white mouse.
2 Fiends with hurdygurdies ; and
6 Italian Pifferari, who in their scarecrow clothing looked anything but spiffy-rari.

They are talking of giving beer to cattle. Let 'em put some spirits
into 'em,—say gin. Well, say you, what kind of gin F Why, say I, as

THE ROBBERS IN JUTLAND.
The subjoined, as given by Renter's Express, is part of the proclama-
tion issued by General Falkenstbin, the Second Robber of the Kino
Of Prussia's gang of marauders in Jutland, otherwise called Com-
mander-in-Chief of his Prussian Majesty's troops there, by order of
the First Robber, alias, his Excellency Field Marshal Freihekr von
Wrangbl. It is a statement of the scale of contributions to bs levied
on Danish.landlords for the supply of the Prussian thieves:—
"1. To Officers.—For breakfast: coffao, with accessories. Por dinner: soup, meat,
and vegetables, roast an 1 sweets, butter, and cheese, and a bottle ef wine. Fer
supper: tea, bread and butter, and meat Ei^ht cigars per man daily.
3. To Men.—Fur breakfast: coffee and accessories. For dinner: soup, 1 pound
of meat and vegetables, bread and cheese, a bottle of beer, an eighth of a pound ef
tobacco, or ten cigars per man.
"S. To Hortcs.—Four measures of oats, 8 pounds ot hay, and the necessary
straw."
Well now, really, the liberality of these allowances for Prussian felons
and cutthroats is extreme. It beats even the dietary profusion on
which convicts were until lately, if they are not still, regaled in British
prisons. In the most luxurious of all our gaols, criminals, we believe,
were never indulged with cigars, if with any tobacco at all; certainly
none of them have ever been allowed so many cigars as from eight to
ten, or as much tobacco as an eighth of a pound a-day apiece.
Some one may say that it is not fair to compare the Prussian soldiers
occupying Jutland to the malefactors who occupy our gaols. There are
differences between them. The principal one is that the Prussian
soldiery are out of gaol, whereas the British felonry are in gaol. The
other is that whilst the latter depredators are spontaneous, the former
are compelled to plunder their neighbours. But though the Prussia*
soldiery in Jutland are out of gaol, they are maintained equally with the
British felonry at the expense of the public with whom they are at war.
And, notwithstanding that the Kino of Prussia's forces are plun-
derers iby command of his Majesty, they do his Majesty's will nothing
loath.
In the' foregoing extracts from General 'Faikenstein's villanous
edict, it will be observed that for breakfast, both officers and men are
allowed "coffee with accessories." Doubtless, "accessories" mean
bread-and-butter, sugar, milk and cream, eggs, nam, and whatever else
the brigands may please to call for. The word " accessories" suggests
a question. If the principals»in the murder of the Danes at Sdnderborg
and elsewhere deserve to oe hanged, what do the accessories before and
after the fact deserve P
Falkenstbin! The name reminds us of Wallensteds; no doubt
by a natural association with The Robbers.
The King of Prussia and Herr von Bismarck, in ordering the
plunder and slaughter of the Danes, have, to borrow the words of an
author said to be known in Prussia, though his writings have not
exerted any moral influence there, out taught bloody instructions,
which may one of these days return to plague the inventors, if the
inventors are in the'land of the living, not in a worse. They have thrown
away all regard to the rules of civilised warfare, and in any war in which
they may hereafter be engaged with any nation, both sides are to be as
barbarous as they please. Any enemy invading Prussia will, by Prussia's
own precedent, be justified in ravaging Prussia with the most merciless
cruelty, and will be encouraged in so doing by the applause of all honest
A Protest.
We observe an incessant announcement of a fact of limited interest.
We perpetually read "Janita's Cross." Of the lady we have no know-
ledge, and of course know nothing of the reasons for her crossness, but
be she and they what they may, we think her friends act harshly in publicly
recording what is really a private affair, especially as her temper may
be attributable to the eccentric weather. We have often reprehended
these invasions of the sanctity of domestic life.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

UNIVERSAL HERO-WORSHIP COMPANY (LIMITED).
INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES' ACT, 1862.
[By operation of which the liability of each shareholder will be
limited to the amount of cheers, or other manifestations of enthusiasm
(including banners, dinners, subscriptions to memorials, &c.) invested.]
ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.
The Company has been formed to supply a want severely felt in
these days of general enlightenment, keen appetite for sensation, and
singularly demonstrative enthusiasm.
Every sharp-sighted person must have remarked, with regret, the
great waste of popular and productive enthusiasm, on occasions like the
late visit of General Garibaldi, the Shakspeare Tercentenary, the
Burns and Handel Festivals, &c. &c, owing to the want of a proper
organisation for employing these manifestations in a remunerative
manner, on the great principle of co-operative capital which seems
destined to be the regenerator of industry in the present day. How
productive popular enthusiasm may be made is sufficiently shown by the
enormous profits realised by enterprising individuals, or Associations—
as the Directors of the Royal and Italian Opera, the Crystal Palace, and
principal Railway Companies—by judicious operations in the wide-
spread excitement on the subject of General Garibaldi, the memory
of Shakspeare, and similar investments of Hero-Worship.
It is hardly necessary to point out that co-operation and combination
would have enormously increased even these large receipts, and secured
to a gigantic Association, such as that now brought forward, the returns
hitherto monopolised by individuals or small Companies. The Directors
have introduced this Company with a view to extend to the wide, and
hitherto only imperfectly worked field of Hero-Worship, the principles
on which are founded the Oridit Mobilier and Credit Foncier in France,
and the influential Companies lately formed in imitation of them among
ourselves. As these Associations gather into a mountain of aggregated
capital myriads of pecuniary molehills, so the Directors propose to fuse
A GOOD COOKE.
Quibble, a cab-dr!ver (the name is from the police
J report) summons a fare. Apparent misunderstanding—
claim allowed. Two other points. Mr. Cooke, Magistrate,
reprobates, most strongly, the practice indulged in, by
■ snobs, of " treating cabby." The custom is a vulgar relic
I of the old coach time, when bottle-nosed ruffians were
■ propitiated by donated liquor. And if "cabby "gets treated
too much, and a subsequent fare is ill-treated, who's to-
blame? We trust that all Magistrates will instantly con-
sider any case proved as against any treater. Next, Mb.
Cooke, Magistrate, strongly reprobated the practice in-
dulged in by cabmen of saying, "I'll leave it to you, Sir."
It plainly means, as Mr. Cooke says, extortion. But this- j
can easily be remedied. The moment a cabman ha* said
that, the law of fares is suspended. Let the rider pay six-
pence, and let the Magistrate refuse all further redress.'
Mr. Cooke, however, deserves thanks for his judicial and
judicious lesson.
"TRAVELLERS DO STRANGE THINGS."
"TnouGHT is free," says a singer in the Tempest, and so
for that matter is dress. Yet, without the slightest idea of
infringing upon sumptuary liberties, is not—eh—well—but
is not this rather—you understand—an odd costume for a
person engaged in commercial pursuits. He says,—
TOWN TRAVELLER.—Has Travelled Eight Years in '■
skirts, stays, under-clothing, and millinery. First-class refe-
rences.—Address • *, Shepherdess Walk.
The address makes the affair quite Arcadian, but as the
advertiser has first-class references, we shall ride second-
class should we see him in the train, for fear of being
provoked into the rudeness of smiling. That's all.
A Hint.
The Telegrams from Germany say that "the prospects
of the Duke op Augustenburg have greatly improved"
When a swaggering lodger, who established himself on
the first-floor, is sent up to the attics, he usually ob- j
tains an improved prospect, but seldom boasts much
about it.
into an overwhelming general excitement the small individual enthu-
siasms now unproductive, or productive to particular speculators
only.
The money returns of the undertaking they have every reason to 1
believe will be enormous.
In furtherance of their object the Directors propose that the Company
should enter into arrangements with General Garibaldi for a pro- 1
longed residence, and widely extended series of progresses, in this
country (having first taken all necessary precautions for the fortification
of his health), and this they have reason to think may be effected on
terms which, while they will defray the General's expenses on the
most liberal scale, will yet, owing to the simple habits of the General,
be insignificant in comparison with the returns to be expected by the
Company.
They have also entered into negotiations with several leaders of
fashion, and persons high in the official world, on terms highly advan-
tageous to the Company,—it having been found that publicity and
notoriety (which the Company will be in a position to secure in their
most imposing form) are of greater weight with these classes than pecu-
niary remuneration.
It is the purpose of the Directors, in all cases, to work, in the first
instance, all the metropolitan sources of admiration and sympathy.
When these are exhausted, their operations will be transferred to
the provincial field of supply.
They have already entered into preliminary arrangements with
former objects of hero-worship, now thrown into the shade, but which
only require a little judicious treatment, and a course of well-directed
newspaper articles—for which the Directors need only say that they'
command the most eligible channels—to be again made productive.'
The operations of the Company will gain greatly by being systematic, j
as the various veins of enthusiasm will be judiciously tapped in a care- |
fully-planned order, based on the soundest calculation of the love of
variety and sensation among the masses, high and low. Thus a course of
patriots will be followed by one of Continental sovereigns, with occa- j
sional intervals of popular pugilists, high-rope performers, and literary
lions, alive and dead.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
As the best means of ensuring brilliancy and effect for their operations,
the Directors are happy to say that they have all but concluded nego-
tiations with Mr. E. T. Smith, Mr. Cooke, and Messrs. Howes and
Cushing for the use of the banners and scenic resources of the first,
and the equestrian studs, performing elephants, and four-legged lions of
the latter. The best results are anticipated from the artful combination
of the quadrupeds and bipeds of the genus Leo, which has hitherto been
neglected. They have also made a abend offer—now under favourable
consideration at Her Majesty's Office of Works—for the funeral-car of
the late Duke of Wellington, which they propose to turn to account
in the celebration of deceased worthies. Mr. Martin Farquhab
Tupper has accepted, provisionally, the arduous office of bard to the
Company, and negotiations are in progress with Poet (not Archdeacon)
Close, to relieve Mb, Tupper on the rare occasions when he requires
time to think, or his Pegasus to recover his wind. Dr. Cumming has
kindly agreed to accept the office of Clerical Enthusiast and Millenarian
Trumpeter to the Company: and Messrs. Washington Wilks and
G. F. Train have been applied to, to act as Standing Orators when no
enthusiastic nobleman is available to take the chair at the demonstra-
tions which it is one main object of the Company to organise through-
out the length and breadth of the land.
Extensive arrangements will be made with Keepers and Showmen
of Lions, alive or dead; and Proprietors of Relics, Hero-worship-Pro-
moters, Anniversary-Organisers, and owners of Moral-Engines for the
Production of Enthusiasm at high-pressure, will be treated with on
liberal terms and in the strictest confidence.

jokes.
7. Smoking will be permitted in all parts of the building. The pro-

TRIBUTE TO THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE.
His Rotal Highness this Duke of Cambridge, at a banquet
deservedly given to him by the Salters' Company, in responding to
the toast of His Royal Highness's name associated with that of
"The Army, Navy, and Volunteers," made a remark which may, with
special propriety, be transferred to these columns. Said the Com-
mander-in-Chief to the Worshipful Salters:—
"Tho way to make your moral influence bear on tho affairs of tbe world in by
keeping your physical power so efficient, that should tbe moral influence broak
down, a ready resort can be made to the physicaL (Cheers and a Laugh.)'1
"We congratulate the Duke of Cambridge on the foregoing obser-
vation, which, being an extremely sensible one, of course created a
laugh. An extremely sensible observation generally does. A very wise
saying produces just the same effect as a very foolish one. The wisdom
of the ancient jester afforded as much amusement as his folly. Perhaps
t lie former was sometimes mistaken lor the latter by those who called
t he jester their " fool." In the sense in which they probably used the
word, we may be permitted to say that the Duke of Cambridge, at
the dinner that was given to him by the Salters' Company, in pro-
pounding a maxim the truth of which is so strikingly illustrated by the
conduct of all foreign powers, and especially just now by that of Austria
and Prussia, made a very great fool of himself. His Royal Highness
deserves to be crowned with our own cap and bells.

PROFESSORS IN A PASSION.
Let dogs delight to quarrel over their bones; but, Members of the
Ethnological Society, do not fall out over yours. Cannot skulls be dis-
cussed by philosophers without the interchange of abuse? You should
not let such angry passions rise as you did one evening last week, at a
meeting of your learned Association, when a Paper was read by Dr.
Donovan, On Empirical and Scientific Physiognomy;" the system
of Lavater in contrast with that of Gall and Spurzheim. In the
course of his observations on that subject, Dr. Donovan is reported to
have " made fun" of some remarks of Sir David Brewster respecting
it. He thereby fairly laid his own open to be made fun of likewise by
any ethnologist present capable of making fun. Instead of that, his
opponents made use pf strong language. Professor Busk is stated to
have denounced his paper as a " farrago of nonsense," and his jocosity
in regard to Brewster as " disgraceful to a scientific meeting." Dr.
Hunt is represented as having declared that it " ought not to be read,"
and another gentleman, we are told, said that a work of Combe's on
Phrenology, quoted by Dr. Donovan, was "one of the most trashy
publications on a scientific subject which had ever appeared." Dr.
Donovan, in reply, expressed the gratification he felt in having "trotted
the antiphrenologists out."
Mr. Punch is a decided phrenologist, because he has himself such a
fine forehead. He believes that when an antiphrenologist is a violent
antiphrenologist, it .is simply because that antiphrenologist has a bad
one.
After-Derby Prosody.
Svnalrpha is the cutting off a vowel at the end of a word before
another at the beginning of a word: as, " 'Ishatoay w'havc in IK army."
Ertklipxis is the cutting off the letter M before another word: as,
"We won't goho'dl morling."
Cram is the contraction of two syllables into one: as, " Til d'light
doesh'pear."
Dictrem is the resolving one syllable into two: as, "Fhe'tha jo-

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mat 2Glh. Monday. A nation with a virtue which all nations admire,
bravery, and doubtless with other virtues which are not so apparent to
the eye of John Bull, with his constable, taxes-paying, and general de-
corum ideas, as they might seem to a less rational person, is in course of
extermination. There were, a few years ago, 100,000 Maoris in New
Zealand, there are now about 50,000. In a few more years there will
be none, and against this loss are to be set two items, the comfort of
the colonists, who covet quiet possession of the Maori lands, and the
extinction of Lord Macaulay s abominable New Zealander. Lord
Lyttleton, speaking to-night, considered that we had not behaved
altogether humanely to these aborigines, with.whom we are now waging
a warfare that means something as like extermination as the usages of
polite war will permit. As nobody knows anything about the colonies,
it may not be superfluous to mention that while England ruled the New
Zealand settlers, the natives got tolerably fair play, but now that we
have given the settlers a Constitution, they not only seek to have the
Maoris put down altogether (and it is very natural that they should)
but they make English folks carry on and pay for the war. In Punch's
spirit of the most impartial justice he ought to add, that there are many
Volunteers, among the colonists, who are extremely ready to aid in
serving out the New Zealanders, and that the latter war after a fashion
which they think fair, but which we call murder. This was the subject
of the Monday night conversation in the Lords, and the Government
had not much to say, but thought that the first thing to be done was to
subjugate the natives. This work the gallant General Cameron is
doing with all desirable vigour.
Those Liverpool Steam-Rams, which of course were not built for the
Confederates, but for the French, also for the Bey of Tunis, likewise
for the Pacha of Egypt, are delivered from law, for the Government has
bought them for the nation, for £220,000. As the Confederates had
nothing to do with them—did not the builders say so ?—it is very strange
that Confederate organs should express irritation at this purchase, but
there are some things that no fellah, not even an Egyptian Fellah, can
be expected to understand.
The Volunteer Review, before the Prince and Princess of "Waxes,
was a glorious sight. As glorious, in its way, was the muddle about
tickets to behold it. Red Tape was once more in all its glory. People
who ought to have had cards bad none, and people who had no right to
any haa lots, a state of things which was alleviated by tickets being of
no use, because the police let anybody who liked take the places. The
mess is between the War Office, the Police, and the Works, and it may
be illustrated by the fact that tickets were thrust into the hands of
Volunteers as they were marching to the ground, when such things
must have been singularly useful. System is not dead, and we shall
have another Crimean business one of these days, unless we establish a
Volunteer War Office. An official of pur sang would far rather a
regiment went to battle without cartridges than that they should be
given out before all possible letters had been written, all possible entries
made in ledgers, and all possible red tape expended. It did not much
matter in the Park, but it will matter a great deal in Prussia, or
wherever the next war may be.
Parliament ascended to semi-practical joking, and a debate on the
Spirit Duties was linked to one on Mr. Home and his Spirits, and his
expulsion from Rome. Whiteside was for cheapening the alcohol,
and Roebuck for avenging the Spirit-rapper. Government triumphed
on the first point, and common sense on the second. Sir Edwin's
Lions were again promised—one this year.
Tuesday. Lord Granville, answering Lord Chelmsford on a
matter of no consequence, accused the good-natured, but rather talkative
ex-Chancellor of being still actuated by a rule dear to young barristers,
namely, that " it is unprofessional to refuse any brief. Slightly imper-
tinent, out not so bad. The Penal Servitude Bill was read a Second
Time, Lord Grey thinking it not severe enough. Some Peers saw
objections to the proposed police surveillance over the ticket-holders.
It would be well if the police had also surveillance over the ticket-sellers,
who establish mock box-offices to cheat Opera-going provincials, who
deserve it, however, because they will not go to the rightplace.
A great Chinese debate in the Commons, but as Mr. Cobden justly
said that a man would sleep more soundly if he knew the whole Chinese
Empire, of 300.000.000 souls, were to be destroyed in the night, than if
he had arranged to nave a tooth pulled out in the morning, we snail merely
say that British interference in China was deprecated and defended, and

[Junk 11,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
that London will be much more interested in learning that Alderman
Salomons brought in a Bill for doing away with Tolls on our Bridges.
By the way, how a cabman hates to hear the instant "right," from
the tollman at Waterloo. It shows that you had your twopence ready—
ergo that you know London—ergo that you know the fare.
Finally, we had a " warm " debate on the formation of the Committee
which Government has discovered is necessary to clem- its honour in
the Robert Lowe and Document-Mutilation business. Mb.. Clat bit
Loud Robert Cecil very hard for his sharp practice in handing about
a paper which he knew Mb, Lowe was physically incapable of seeing.
Later, a Committee of Five, with two non-voting adsessors, was ap-
pointed. Who cares?
Wednesday. The Bill for doing away with the Tests at Oxford.
Rather a warm debate—the fires of theology do warm people, especially
amateurs of that pursuit. Lord Robert Cecil declared that no man
could be a good Churchman who was not a good Conservative, whereto
Sir George Grey demurred. Mr, Leatham's speech was far the
best. He is a Dissenter. Of course he supported the Bill, but said
that his fear was lest young Dissenters, going to Oxford, should yield to
the genius loci, and become Churchmen. Archbishop Punch sees no
objection to this. His Bishops tell him that the new clergy daily fall
shorter and shorter of the desired standard, and judging by his own
experience, he can well believe it. Why not let iu the fresh, acute,
fearless, young Dissenters? They want to be Scholars and Gentlemen.
Dissent erects beautiful Gothic churches that shame the wretched
contract-built bams of Evangelical architects, and as for social status,
the Reverend Mr, Jat, a Star of Nonconformity, has left, as bis
parting legacy to the rising sectarians, advice to marry rich girls,"
though not endowed with personal advantages." Is not
manly? The Bill triumphed, on this stage, by 236 to 236
Thursday. Inspired by Mr. Punch's Cartoon of last "week, Lord
Clanricarde brought in a Bill in favour of the British Oyster. During
June, oysters are not in (except in the celebrated picture of the
"Chelsea Pensioners hearing the News of Waterloo"), and we shall
therefore examine Messrs. Pimm, Lynn, Rule, Harvey, and other
eminent oyster-merchants, who have now plenty of leisure and lobsters.
With deep regret, and some shame, Mr. Punch states that he has
again been a heavy sufferer from his unfortunate habit of hearing both
sides before a rush into gush. He is convinced that the best course
is instantly to accept a police report, or a provincial paragraph, and
dash into indignation. Having foolishly waited for explanations, in
reference to a case of prima Jacie hardship, and an apparently severe
sentence by Mr. Payne, the Magistrate, Mr. Punch is done. Sir
George Grey stated to-night that the culprit had lied awfully, and was
a confirmed rogue, and that there was nothing to find fault with in the
sentence. In future, Mr. Punch intends to imitate some of his contem-
poraries, and to attack Judges and Magistrates on the statements of
prisoners, or his poetry and enthusiasm will be chilled.
An Education Wrangle, and Irish Chancery. We shall not insult
readers by adding a word.
A Bill called the Married Women's Acknowledgment Bill was read
a Second Time. But why useless legislation? Everybody knows how
prompt a married woman is to acknowledge anything that her husband
does in the hope of pleasing her. How, if the husband makes her a
present, she would die (or own she dyed) sooner than criticise it
unkindly, or say that he had better give her money instead of wasting
it on rubbish, and then she could buy what she really wanted, and had
begged and prayed for so often. How instantly she makes acknow-
ledgment if she is in the wrong, or thinks it would please you to be
told so. We deprecate all needless law-making, and hope that the
Lords, who are the husbands of Ladies, will throw this measure out.
Friday. Lord Shaftesbury earnestly advocated the Bill for pro-
hibiting the employment of boys in sweeping chimneys. That after
nearly 1864 years of Christianity such a measure should be necessary is
very horrible, and also very suggestive. The details which the Earl
brought forward are too shocking for reproduction here, but fine ladies
who mew over the sorrows of the Circassians, and devout ladies who
send missionaries to the Chinese, had better know what is done in then-
own houses, and within a few feet of their own beds, with the children
of white English folk.
New Minister Ciiilders explained that Greenwich Hospital is to be
reformed. The building is to be kept for the infirm, and the other old
salts are to have their allowances, and spend them where they like. At
present, the Hospital lias £150,01)0 a-year, and wastes £80,000.
The Scotchmen actually had a debate, but it ended in the decision
that Scotland manages her legislation very quietly and well, and that no
alteration in the system is wanted.
ABBEOKUTA AND DYBBOL.
Oh the King op Dahomey's infuriate ire
Against Abbeokuta breathed slaughter and fire!
He went forth with his men and his women of might,
To assault it, and sack it, and raze it outright.
He led on his black bands in their battle array,
All at hirst for the bloodshed, all keen for the prey:
And they grinned and they glared, males and females as well,
Whilst they tramped to the tomtom with warwhoop and yell-
But the Egbas, forewarned, had long kept a look-out,' •
And their walls had well mounted and manned round about,
By their brave Abashorun prepared to abide
All the onslaught of Badaiiung's rapine and pride.
Thrice oae thousand armed savages rush on the wall,
But the battlements blaze, and the miscreants fall,
right down, those
• their foes.
Some sprawl biting the dust, these are shot
Are dragged over the ramparts and slain by
Lo, to scale the w»U striving, the Amazons' band,
Of ten thousand black rascak oae thousand were slain,
Besides many more wounded; two thousand were ta'en.
With the Egbas behind them the rest of them
And the first ran
with
of them fled,
King atC
O that right could at DybboL too, thus have prevailed.
And the lavage attack upon Sonderborg failed!
Yes. and O that King William. King Badahung's
Had been thus chased away with a flea in his ear!,
But this difference there is 'tween Dahomey's dark sons,
And your Prussians; the negroes have no needle-guns,
Or those thieves might have seized on their neighb
And the fate of the Egbas been that of the Danes.
Great and grave is the peril wherein the world stands,'
From the weapons of science in savages' hands.
Let us look to our arms, that, in coming to blows,
We may lick, like the Egbas, the like of their foes.

"We need hardly say how great is our respect for the intelligence ot
the Law: in fact, it is only out of regard for the maintenance of its due
dignity, that we feel compelled to draw the attention of the members of
the Learned Profession to the system of flagrant pulling adopted in the
legal announcements of the newspapers. We allude especially to the
notices relating to the Bankruptcy Court. Thus, may be seen in one
single staring line—
"Mr, Registrar Roche is the Registrar of the day."
A very excellent gentleman and most admirable Registrar. But
to say that he is "The Registrar of the Day! "—that is, the Regis-
trar par excellence—is rather hard upon Mr. Hazlitt, who is, we are
sure, no whit behind Mr. Roche in the skill with which he discharges
his professional duties. It's all very well for Messrs. Noses & Son,
or Buy'em & Co., to placard the town with flaring posters to the effect
that he (that is, either one or the other) is the The Snip of the Day;
but it is a step or two down the ladder for Mr. Registrar Roche to
be a party to such an arrogant assertion as that of which we complain.
While upon this subject, we would draw attention to the mode in
which Public Business in transacted by some of our principal Legal
Functionaries. Among the arrangements we find:—

probably) was boiled in Smithlield, in the dark ages, for
poisoning an entire family in soup, and his recipe, with
slight modification, is evidently in the possession of several
cheap eating-houses; and this wholesale boiling of one's

A ROAR FROM A LION.
Mb. Punch,
I am a Lion; in fact, I am He Lion whose cast, if you live
long enough, you may live to see adorning the completed Nelson
Column. My great-grandfather first sat as a model for the work, and
the honour that thus reached him has through succeeding generations
descended upon me. Both my grandfather and father spent their lives
in the same service, and as I inherit a likeness to the family, Sir Edwin
next did methe honour to select me for the work. Of course, I thought
it a great compliment, and have tried to look my best. But I've been
sitting such a time now that I'm getting rather tired of it, and I'm
afraid that my expression is not quite what it was. Besides, I don't
mind telling you that my hair is falling oil', and my tail is sadly bare
from being so much sat upon. I don't want to whine about my per-
sonal disfigurement, or to growl because my patience is pretty nigh
worn out. I know Sir Edwin would not have kept me so long sitting,
but that he wished to take the greatest pains about the correctness of
his cast. Still I wish you would just hint to him that time is of im-
portance at my somewliat advanced age, and that he had best complete
my likeness before I get quite bald, and altogether lose my pristine
elegance of figure.
If you chance to come my way, I hope you will look in, and if it be
feeding time, come and pick a bone with me. The tiger says I am so
aged that you would hardly know me. But any of the keepers will
direct you to my den, and 1 shall be delighted to shake you by the paw,
and thank you for your kind insertion of this letter.
With a roar of admiration at the way in which my family are always
drawn in Punch, I beg leave to subscribe myself,
Yours faithfully,'
Thx Lion.
P.S. If yon come I hope you will bring Toby, as I know some little
cubs who would revel in a romp with him.
Hagiologt.—Patron of a Fukmariet.—St. Poly-carp.
A GRATEFUL COUNTRY.
In commenting, the other day, on the Volunteer Review, then in
prospect, a contemporary remarks that:—
"Every man who is on tbe ground deserves woll of England, and England is not
wont to be ungrateful to her sons who render her good service."
Most true. As the Army and Navy Gazette observes, in an article
relative to a certain gallant body of forces :—
"Any one who chooses may employ one of the finest soldiers who ever faced an
enemy—whoso breast is covered with medals and ribands, amid which Ipi . that
of the Victoria Cross—to run of errands for him for threepence a mile, and the man
who belonged to this very battalion of which we speak is glad to get it."
A Commissionnaire with the Order of Valour on his breast, and an 1
empty sleeve pinned by the cuff beside it, running an errand for three-
pence, and glad to get the money, presents a fine example of England's
gratitude to her sons who render her good service, and lose a limb in
doing so. A still finer example is presented by a winner of the Victoria
Cross who has lost his legs, and cannot run, and will be very much
obliged to you if you will give him a halfpenny.

it comes to be engaged with anything like equal numbers of an enemy,
will administer to its adversaries a sound drubbing.

had merely meant to say that party
differences should never induce him

however, was allayed by Mr.

the timely discovery, that if in the

to say that theoretical belief should

From a Twaddling Old Cynical Fidget.
We say "posting a letter." Our combative cousins across the sea
say, " mailing a letter." They are nearest right. Post is a meaningless
word now—except when a letter is put into a pillar. But mails still
exist. Without further critical remark, we will add that mailing a letter
is a much safer course than femaling one; for a gentleman to whom you
confide your despatch has some idea of the desirability of early posting,
whereas a lady thinks any time will do—except when the letter is to
ask Mr. Webster or Mr. Fechter for stalls.

A GROWL FROM A BRITISH FLAT.
Well—here I am—laid up against the wall of the Lyceum scene-
dock, werry bad in my distemper, and my size as much redooced as if
I'd been kep on Banting's system for a twelvemonth. Wish I had.
It's a deal wuss thanlthat. I'm laid off, bless ye. Flats ain't no use in
this here theayter now, leastways not behind the scenes; they've no
objection to 'em in front, I '11 be bound. We 're on the French system,
we are: our scenes is worked under the stage—all ground and set-pieces,
and no wings nor borders nor grooves, nor nothing as it used to be.
Well, they may say what they like, 'taint English. English scenes, ever
since I knowed a theayter—and I was primed, sixty year ago under Old
Green wood at the Lane—has been worked fair and above board, unless
it was a sink now and then, or a pant ermine scene, or some such low-lived
Christmas or Easter rubbidge, that was painted for the lower horders,
and lodged on the mazarine-floor, which it's much the same thing in the
theayter as the airy or cellars in an 'ouse. But the real respectable
cloths and flats—them as did the regular stock business, and worked the
season—we'd a' seen a stage-manager far enough if he'd tried it on,
lowering us to the mazarine floor. We was down to the legitimate
business, we was—the sides and crossins and pints that's been good
for three rounds ever since Betterton's time, and Garrick's and
Kemble's, and old Kean's. We kuowM 'ow a play should be got up,
togged, and mounted, from the first music to the come-down of the
dickey. We'd a' seen the theayter farther afore we'i a* stood a live
Mossoo in Sha&speare. I don't believe there's a real old legitimate
British flat that respects hisself as a flat in a London theayter ought tu,
that wouldn't have stuck in his groove agin all the scene-men that ever
shoved, sooner than 'ave let hisself be run on to back an 'Amlet in a
flaxen wig, and without his left stockin' rolled down to show the
fleshins.
But it's all of a piece. Bless you, nous avong changy too slar. as we
say in this theayter. We upsets the old pints, pitches wenerable old
scene flats to blazes, tramples on the vested rights of properties that's
been in the theayter since old Nosey led the music, kicks O.P. and F.S.
about the prompt-book, as if they was no better nor supers or bally-
gals, picks the stock to pieces, and bundles out 'ard working old shirts
and shapes, robes and fl«»hin« to take their chance among the Jews
and the rag-shops, as if they 'adn't 'arned a right to be wore, as long as
they could 'ang together.
But the scenery! Naturally that's what I feel most. All our fam'ly
that's allowed in the place is sent down-stairs—we ain't to be seen on
the fust floor—oh dear no! We 're low, we are ... we must be kep'
dark, and do our work, like servants in swell fam'lies, without bein'
seen. They said we wasn't to be heard neither. But we showed 'em
the difference. Blest if ever I hear such a row, as in these here 'Amlet
sets. The Guv'nor will make a tidy thing of it, if the public makes as
much noise about the rewiwal as his set-pieces does. And I don't
wonder at 'em . . . knockin' their 'eads together in the dark, poor
things, down in that nasty mazarine. It may do for French flats:
I. dare say they 're used to it, as they is to frog-size, and scene-shifters
in wooden shoes; but it don't soot British battens, can was that's got
relations in Her Majesty's navy, and colours that ain't got no call
whatsumever to the tricolor. So, if set-pieces does run rusty, and
flats won't be druv*, and flaps strike work, and objects to play, and
sinks sulks, and flies 'angs fire, it's only nateral, put down as they is,
and trampled on, and the werry size in their werns set on the bile, at
being ordered about by a Frenchman!
And what doe3 it all come to? What does he get out on it, arter all?
A front scene jammed down agin the float, and a big set at the back,
the last so far back, it's ruination in cloths and supers, and the first so
far forrard, that actin's impossible, and effect's out of the question.
I defy the best scene that ever old Stanny knocked off at the Lane or
such as Telbin hisself turns out, to do its work with pleasure to itself
and satisfaction to its employers within eight foot of the float.
I fancy I see myself offered such a situation, when I was took off
the frame. Flats has their feelings. I was rayther nuts on myself, I
can tell ve, when I was a young 'un. Bein' a Gothic Castle, with a
racticable door and sloats and scruto-work about me. it's only nat'ral
should have some fam'ly pride. Many and many s the night I've
been run on for the platform of the Castle of Elsinoor. I wouldn't like
to say how often poor Jem Ward's walked afore me as the Ghost at the
Lane. Jem had a feelin' for his line o' business. He'd a' stood none
of your parley-voos.
Owsomever, if this sort of thing goes on, the company will be runnin'
as rusty as the scenery, that's one comfort. The Guv'nor's a takiu
in out on 'em, and sarves 'em right too. There's his name in the street
posters a good hinch longer nor any o' theirs, and all theirs, from the
King down to Bernardo and Marcellus, the same size to a nail. They '11
like that, uncommon! The Guv'nor a'nt no mercy on 'em, and I'm
glad on it. A party as can treat scenery as he's done ain't to be
expected to think much of his company.
About the actin' ?—Well I like the Guv'nor in 'Amlet better than I
thought I should. He's gettin' into a pint or two, 'ere and there; and,
if he goes on another twelvemonth, he '11 know something about the
pronounciation of the English language—that is, if he '11 only take time,
and mind his stops, and put his hemphasis right. The worst on it is.
that he do slip about dreadful when he gets excited, and makes an awful
'ash of the dialect. About the make-up; well, p'raps you '11 say there
ain't no 'arm in a flaxen wig—mind, / don't tlnnk so—but I 'ope you '11
allow there ain't no reason 'Amlet should wear that 'ere black crape
widder's cap 'atop on it; it do make him look uncommon top-'eavy.
And I'd like to know if 1Amlet hadn't ought to look a leettle out of
sorts, arter he seen the ghost. If the Guv'nor won't turn down his
stockin's, at least he might 'ave a leettle of the front curl took out of
his wig. or something or other. But he look as band-boxy in the third
and fifth acts as he do in the first. Blest if that can be right.
About the rest? Well, for a scratch lot , they 're not bad. Mind, I
don't see why the Guv'nor's name should be in such uncommon big
letters. The wust on 'em all is that they've ketched the way of the
place, and gone in agin' the old business.
There's that Emery now—I remember his father in Tyke. He's a
clever young man, but he ain't made up as I remember the King. He's
more like the picture of Danish Kings that our property man was
showin' the other day out of the Illustrated History of England, and he
seem to make the points pretty much as he likes without caring much
for the old ways. His father wouldn't a'stood that. And there's
John Brougham's Polonius—why he make him quite a respectable
old gentleman—hasn't none of the old gags; didn't get six good
laughs in all his nine lengths. Why, old Dowton had ^m in a roar
all through. His Polonius was a'most as great as his Major Sturgeon.
Ah—that was something like an actor. No, I was fairly ashamed o'
Brougham. What? Polonius was an old gentleman . . .? Trusted
by the King and Queen and the rest of the Royal Family P a sort of
Prime Minister! much such as Palmekston is now? Well! wonders
will never cease. There's nothing like new lights. The old 'uns was
enough for me. The Poloniuses in my time went in for the laughs and
the gags.
About the Ophelia! Well, I dunnow. I remember'em all—from
Mrs. Jordan and Miss O'Neil downards. . . There was Prissy
Horton too, in Mac's time at the Garden .... and the Lane I
arterwards! She was a good un. I didn't think there was a gal on
the stage now could a' got a new rise out of the part. But that there
little Terby—;I don't mind tellin' you—she give me a reg'lar turn. I've
knowed her since she was a mite at the Princesses. A good, quiet,
clever, 'ard-working, little thing as ever took her pound a week home
to her family. She d a pleasant smile for everybody, and everybody
had a kind word for her. We was all quite fond on her somehow.
Some said she'd do great things. I didn't. I've seen lots of these
young 'uns. They are mostly like forced mushrooms—werry well early
m the season, but not worth much when the reglar-grow'd ones comes
in. But this here little girl—she've growed somehow, since they give
over forcing on her. Mind I won't say she were the old style. She
didn't come the Elocution, as I've heerd some on 'em; and she don't
give herself the airs of a first juvenile lady, and take the stage, and eye
the audience over, as 'much as to say, Here I am. won t you give
me a round?" She've a good deal to learn, I should say, afore she
makes the most of herself. But somehow she looked so good and
sweet, and innocent; and she spoke so pretty in that scene with
Laertes, and seemed so sad when they all keeps a snubbin' on her
about young 'Amlet. and then when she give 'Amlet back bis presents
. . altogether, somehow—mind it warn't actin' as I've seed it, and
been taught it ought to be—but still it brought my 'art into my prac-
ticable door, and set my old water-colour a runnin'—/ say it's the
damp, when any o' these here new-fangled set-pieces on the mazarine
floor pokes their fun at me. In short, it give me a regular turn.
I can't say more than that. The mad scene? Well, I can't tell you;
it made me cry, and sent a cold shiver down my battens; and I'd rayther
not talk about it, on'y I recommend you to go and see it. Never mind
the Guv'nor's bad English. You go and see it. P'raps you '11 tell me
whether it's actin'or not. Leastways it's werry affectin' . . . but mind
it ain't the old style. Prissy Horton, perhaps, she warn't old style
neither, bless her heart. I often thinks I'll ask Telbin if he can't get
me a turn at the Gallery of Illustration along with Pris3Y. But I feel
I'd like to have a night or two more of little Kate Terry's Ophelia
first.
I know I'm on'y an old flat—but them's my feelins.
Biters Bit.
"An M.P." corroborated by "An Ex-M.P.," writing to the Times,
complains of having been pestered with a telegram which turned out to
be the puffing advertisement of a firm of dentists, from their name
apparently Semitic. Dentists, who resort to the means adopted by
these persons to obtain publicity and custom, must be supposed to deal
in teeth which may be expected to bite.
Why is Mr. Bass like a Dentist? Because he's going to remove
the grinders.

THE LATITUDE OF LADIES.
In the House of Commons I find Mr. Cowper making the
subjoined observation relative to the fact that, at the Volunteer Review,
many persons, regardless of the notice printed on the cards of admission,
which reserved the first three rows of chairs for ladies, took the front
seats for themselves, and refused to give them up to those whom they
were intended for:—,
"It was a source of great regret to him that Englishmen should have disgraced
themselves, as he thought they had done, on Saturday afternoon, by retaining
seats while ladies were standing by."
Sir, I am not the person to advocate want of gallantry, and proper
behaviour towards ladies. But what I say. is, if they want to have
that consideration shown them which they nave been accustomed to
receive, and still think themselves entitled to expect—they had better
give np Crinoline. Ladies, however, naturally attractive and agreeable,
are not to suppose that they can create interest, and also an obstruction.
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, Smelpuxgus.

ORGAN-GRINDING AT HIGHBURY,
^^(^^^^^k S^^^ Peculiar kind of case, one
that the messenger experienced a no more kindly

The case above epitomised is, as aforesaid, a
class case. Who, living in those squares and
other regions of London which are inhabited by
a certain class of civic people, is not familiar
with the annoyance occasioned by an organ-
grinder patronised by a bounceable woman, of
tawdry exterior and violent deportment, whose
husband, as well as herself, has connexions in
Houndsditch. When remonstrated with by any
gentleman who has the misfortune to live near
nim, on the disturbance occasioned by his wife's
musical proclivities, he becomes insolent and
abusive. Who does not recognise this sort of

on keeping him there. Re-
monstrance with Mr. Halle only occasioned him to rush into the house of the complainant,
and, according to the latter's statement, behave himself in a very offensive manner. There
was no remedy for the annoyance thus caused by discord encouraged by vulgarity. The
Italian wretch had a legal right to remain where he was stationed by his patrons to the injury
of his neighbour. Mr. Halle's ignorance of his duty towards his neighbour, appeared so great
to the Magistrate, that he charitably sent an officer to instruct him therein. It is to be feared
The Correspondent of a contemporary says,
"I think that a surprise may be expected, aud
that the Austrian, with one single step, will raise
himself to a tremendous height." We have no
objection to see any burglar imitate the last act
of Haman, but we think that he will require
boys under his care, believing that she had found them a home. But the course
pursued by the defendant with regard to the younger boy was Buch as rendered him
unfit to have the charge of boys. Tho boy was set to learn lessons, and because he
did not accomplish them to the defendant's satisfaction, he 'flew' upon him, and
beat him about the head and face in a most unmerciful manner, by which his
nervous system suffored so great a shock that it was some days before he recovered.
The poor child's head, face, and ears were all bruised, and although the assault
complained of happened some seventeen days ago, the marks about hi* head and
cheeks were stiU visible. Db. Jlffbrson, who was the medical adviser of the
family, and who was caUed in to see tho boy, would tell them that if such treatment
had been continued it would have been at the risk of the child's life."
SKETCHES FROM SOME SCHOOLS.
There can be no doubt that the male young of the human species
g^ve their elders much trouble. As Mrs. German Reed asserts
nightly:—
"The Essence of all Bother
Is bottled in a Boy."
If we send him to a public school, he is most unreasonably dissatisfied
with his treatment. He states, truly enough, that his blanket is taken
away on a cold night to warm a bigger lad; that he is perpetually
licked with sticks or cricket stumps; that he is tumbled over walls to
smuggle forbidden drinks in, is flogged by his senior if he does not go,
and by his master if he does; has to lay his hand on the table that his
tyrant may cut at his fingers with the edge of a college cap; that he is
brutally kicked; that he has .little sleep and always wakes in a fright;
that six cuts over the calf of his leg with a racket is his senior's way of
hinting displeasure; that he has to perform the united menial offices of
a scullion and a shoeblack j and that after a few months of fagging he
is no longer fit for the athletic exercises in which he formerly excelled.
The case was heard at great length and very fairly; counsel's state-
ment was certainlv made out, though another boy tried to soften the
case, "but admitted that Mr. E. G. Smith had told him what to say,"
and though a housemaid, called Jowell—it should have been Jewel—
with the most loyal alacrity swore that the child was "even more
sprightly and cheerful after the punishment than before." The magis-
trates deliberated, and then fined Mr. Edgar G. Smith, Five Pounds.
Such are some Public and some Private Schools; and really it is im-
possible not to feel irritated at the trouble one has to dispose satisfac-
torily of the creature called a Boy. However, as he must have been
created for some wise reason, we must try and do our duty by him,
bother as he is; and certainly we scarcely think that duty fulfilled by
sending him to Schools, Public or Private, like those which have been
illustrated in the Parliamentary evidence, or in the case of Mr. Edgar
G. Smith of Beckenham. We are afraid, parents, and especially
mothers, that you must really take the trouble of making a good many
inquiries before vou delegate your duties; and Mr. Punch, in the interest
of the risen ana rising generations will aid you so far as he can, by
giving you any information he may possess as to where not to send the
latter. We want another Cowper and another Tirocinium.
This, ladies, and especially mothers, is all proved, and solemnly
written down, as evidence taken before Parliamentary Commissioners
who were ordered to inquire into our Public School system. You may
read it, and much more-which you will not find such pleasant reading
as a sensation novel. Well, as we have said, boys complain, and some
parents take them out of what the foolish children are pleased to call
misery" some don't.
But when you have taken your troublesome child out of his "misery,"
you must do something with him. You try a Private School. If you
are fortunate, that is, if you make proper inquiries, and become
acquainted with the master, and do not choose a teacher with less care
than you use in choosing a butler, you will probably discover a worthy
guide, philosopher, and friend for your son; and happily there are
hundreds of such men, now at work for the England ot the Future.
But you may as well be careful, or you may have more bother.
A HERCULES ON THE FIDDLE.
Wonderful are the words of writers upon music. For instance, see
this scrap from a recent report of a Philharmonic Concert :—
Last week, at the Bromley Petty Sessions, the Magistrates had to
deal with a Mr. Edgar Glennie Smith, who keeps a private school
at Beckenham. The parents of two little boys, one ten, the other eight,
placed them with Mr. E. G. Smith, and as the terms were £150 a-year,
the establishment must have been considered respectable. The little
boy had been delicate, "and," said Serjeant Ballantine (corrobo-
rated by the mother on oath) :—
"The next instrumental piece—BeETnovES's violin concerto, a colossus, to
grapplo with which successfully demands no loss than the grasp and vigour of a
Hercules on the fiddle—took us into another world."
A Hercules on the fiddle! That's rather a strong phrase. We sup-
pose we next shall hear of a Jupiter on the trombone, or a Mars upon
the drum. And fancy a bit of fiddling that can carry away a critic
"into another world!" Why it really almost beats Mr. Home and
his accordion. Perhaps the critic when he got there heard the music of
the spheres, or Pan upon his pipes playing The Ruler of the Spirits. If
so, he might as well have written a report of the performance.
"Tho boya were sent to the school on the express understanding that no per-
sonal chastisement was to be administered, their mother having pointed out that
the child was delicate and subject to glandular swellings, and it was upon the
assurance of Mr. Smith that he used persuasion and endeavoured to win tho love
of tho boys, and never resorted to personal violence, that she consented to leave her

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June Mi. Monday. The hero of the week, and of all weeks in which
letters are delivered, Sir Rowxand Hill, is to receive £20,000 as a
Eresent from the Government, to which directly and indirectly, he will
ave presented millions, with advantage and contentment, moreover,
to the contributors to the revenue. The gift was recommended, in the
Lords to-night, by the Chancellor in the name of the Queen. On
the following Wednesday, in the Sheldonian theatre at Oxford,
Mr. Punch had the pleasure and glory of seeing his distinguished friend
receive the degree of D.C.L., which may, pro hue vice, be interpreted,
Donor of Cheap Letters.
The nuisance of Park Lane, the narrowest and most dangerous street
in civilised London, was assailed by Lord Lucan, Lord Malmes-
bury, and the Commander-in-Chief. Of course, the authorities shift
the responsibility; somebody says that it is the business of St. George's
vestry, somebody else that it is the Government business, and a third
somebody that it is the business of Thwaites, and among them all
people are knocked down and nearly killed, or the traffic is closely
blocked, fifty times a day. Why not break through Hamilton Place
without asking anybody's leave, and then get an Act of Indemnity?
Are we always to be the slaves to red tape and vested interests P There
is a corn-chandler, too, who has the fiendish wickedness and demoniacal
effrontery to let carts, containing his goods, be loaded and unloaded at
his door, to the hindrance of carriages? Why is he not hanged?
These are specimens of all the arguments on the subject. But some-
thing ought to be done, for Mr. Punch himself, who is royal in his love
for punctuality, was actually late at a party in Eaton Square last
Wednesday, owing to the Park Lane block, and to his having let his
outriders go to chapel.
An interesting conversation on Public School Education" elicited the
important fact that when William Lennox Lascelles Fitzgerald
de Ros, Baron, was a little boy at school, he was fag to the present
Archbishop of Canterbury, cleaned his shoes, and doesn't seem to
have been much wallopped by his Grace (or the marks have gone away),
for Lord de Ros declared to-night that fagging was a good institution.
Mr. Punch declares it to be nothing of the kind, but an institution that
makes a weak boy a sneak, and a strong boy a tyrant. The Bishop of
London, as usual, spoke wisely, deprecated leaving things as they are,
and strongly advocated the teaching French. So do we; not that
French is worth learning, for itself, for it is a wretched language, but
as (and possibly by reason of this last fact) the majority of people un-
derstand it, French is one of the disagreeable necessities of the time.
You do not learn French in order to study poetry or eloquence, but in
order to be able to vituperate French cooks, and assure the various
French ladies whom you meet that you have been, for the first time in
your life, inspired by each of them with a passion which will be enclosed
with you in the tomb. Therefore, we quite agree with the Bishop.
Lord Derby said that Grammar could not be taught at Public Schools.
We can't say how this may be, but it never is. The Archbishop
thought that "French ought to be made imperative," and our friend
the Elected of the Millions will doubtless concur with the Protestant
hierarch.
There has been a great powder explosion at Corfu, but Lord Har-
tington was happy to say that, as it had occurred since our troops left,
it was only Greess that had been blown up.
Lady Elgin, widow of one of the best and ablest noblemen who ever
preferred serving his country to living an idle and foolish life, is, most
properly, to have a pension of £1000 a year, in testimony of our sense
of the merits of her illustrious husband. We trust that she may long
be reminded of a nation's gratitude.
Then we had a lively row. The Conference was the theme, and Mr.
Disraeli made what Pam called "a magnificent display of virtuous
indignation." He abused the Government for telling nothing, also for
having no policy, also for abandoning the policy which Lord Palmer-
ston had vigorously announced a few weeks back. The Premier com-
plained of being attacked when he could not defend himself, demanded
what policy the Opposition wanted, and refused further explanations.
Lord Robert Cecil accused him of making an experiment on the
patience of the House, and of betraying Denmark under the pretext of
serving her. Mr. Kinglake rather agreed, generally, with Mr.
Disraeli, but thought the Government might be right in backing out
of an untenable position.
Then we hatf a still livelier row. The National Gallery was the
theme, and Mr. Cowper asked for £10,000 towards the erection of a
col. xlvi.

new one at Burlington House—to cost in all £152,000. The most
fearful nonsense was profusely talked on all sides, but finally the House
decided that the Academicians should walk, and not the Old Masters,
and Lord John Manners beat the Government by a large majority,
174 to 122.
Tuesday. Mr. Caird made an able speech in favour of his proposal
for the collecting and publishing Agricultural Statistics. The subject
is extremely important, and perfectly uninteresting, except to the
producers of the nation's food, and to smart London men, wbo on the
strength of having taken villas a few miles out of town, cock their eyes
in the most profound manner at the fields they pass in the train, and
talk about "poor soil" and " thin crops" as solemnly as if six months
back they knew wheat from barley. Government resisted the proposal,
and Mr. Caird beat the Government by 74 to 62.
Wednesday. Mr. Lawson's Bill for robbing a poor man of his beer
was—we don't like strong language, but the vulgar tongue ia proper
when common prayer demands strong action- kicked out by an
indignant House, the numbers being, kickers 292, friends of the kicked
Bill, 35. That was all right. Mr. Punch hates intoxication almost as
much as he hates tyranny, and will add, that while rejoicing that a partial
and oppressive measure has been defeated, he desires to see drunken-
ness much more severely punished than at present., instead of its being
accepted as any sort of extenuation of the crimes it generates.
Thursday. Lord Westbury has a new plan for giving attorneys
their due. He promised to explain it at a later date. We deem it right
to mention that we are opposed to corporal punishments, and therefore
trust that these will not torm part of his scheme.
Federal enlistment in this Kingdom still annoys sundry Peers, but
Lord Russell said that it was effected, not by Mr. Lincoln's
Government, but by private speculators, and added, consolingly, that
"only Irishmen could be credulous enough to be so deluded."
Lord Russell also said, in reference to.the American struggle, that
"he wished the North could see the inconsistency of attempting, by
war, to prevent five or six millions of their former fellow-subjects from
Sutting into action the principle of independence which, on every
th of July, they met in New England to celebrate." Messrs. Lincoln
& Davis will please to take notice that these are the Earl's own words,
addressed to the Peers of England, and that the report is no forgery.
Are we apprehended t
Lord Palkerston stated that, by agreement of Conference, the
German burglars were not to resume their course of crime for a fort-
night after the expiration of the armistice.'
Mr. Gladstone, ever eager for the better collection of taxes, moved
on his Bill for making his machinery more effective. It was a good
deal opposed, but unwisely. If we are to be plundered, at least do not
let the plunder be wasted in transitu.
The Street Music Bill came on for Second Reading, and Mb. Bass
showed that the present law was, as Sir Richard Mavne complained,
wholly inefficient to prevent a cruel nuisance. Sir Richard said that
unless a person could declare that he was actually dying, the police had
no power to remove a grinding ruffian who might seek to extort pay
from the friends of the sick man. Mr. Lawson said that the publicans
chiefly maintain the musicians, as it is good policy to hire the brutes to
amuse drinkers into sotting themselves. Here, by the way, licensing
Magistrates have a good pull on the Bungs. Mr. Ayrton and
Mr. Adderley supported the Seoond Reading. Mr. Butt, as might
be expected from ws name, went on the Bung side, and as might be
expected from his antecedents, talked Bosh. So, for a wonder, did
Mr. Gladstone, who, however, may be justified, if he is bent, as it
would appear, on courting popularity among those whose applause is
not usually coveted by educated men. However, Jus colleague. Sir
George Grey, who is too proud to stoop for such plaudit, spoke in
favour of the repression of a nuisance wnich especially assails those
on whom Mr. Gladstone is ever ready to pile taxation, though he will
not help to relieve them from annoyances that do much to prevent their
earning the income he mulcts. Sir Robert Peel also delivered him-
self in manly fashion, in favour of the Bill, and ridiculed Mr. Glad-
stone's crotchet that there was any wish to hinder the people of
amusement, the object being to send the musicians where they are
liked, instead of permitting them to get hush money out ot the
tormented folks by whom they are hated. We are happy to add that
an attempt to defeat the Bill was itself defeated by a majority of 37,
and the Bill was read a Second Time.
Friday. It seems that it is the Danes who will not hear of a longer
armistice than the one above mentioned. They are full of fight, and
they object to the German burglars having time to settle and strengthen
themselves in the districts which they have violated.
A plan of Lord Robert Cecil's for saving trouble to the Parlia-
mentary Committees was discussed, but not approved. As if most of
the Parliament men did not privately enjoy the dignity and fuss of
sitting on Committees. Besides, they are an excuse for avoiding
flower shows, garden parties, fetes, concerts, and all the rest of the
afflicting follies of fashionable life.
Of course, a really interesting debate on the subject of a Gold Coinage
for our Eastern Empire was unattractive. Finally, the House w
Counted Out. We ought to add that at the parliamentary pigeon-match
at Hornsey, the Opposition killed more birds than the Liberals, from
which fact we have no doubt that the Conservative organs will argue
that Lord Derby ought to come into office—they use much weaker
arguments for the delight of the dowagers and the donkeys of
the Party.
MISCONDUCT TO THE MAYOB OF WINDSOB.
Behold a prodigy till now unheard of and unknown,
A Mayor repulsed from showing his devotion to the Throne;'
A thing 'tis to wide ope the eyes and bristle up the hair!
The thought of such indignity inflicted on a Mayor!
The Queen, returned from Scotland, was at Windsor Station due,
And 1 went to greet my Sovereign, like a Mayor and liegeman true,
As sure I was in duty bound to dance attendance there:
Such, on all such occasions, is the place of every Mayor.
We—I and Mr. Alderman, my worthy brother, Blunt—1
Did thither march, Her Majesty with welcome to confront
There followed in our retinue a train of ladies fair,
Who, by accustomed privilege, accompanied the Mayor.
But when we reached the Station—I can hardly tell my tale—
I pant, I gasp, I gulch, I choke; my stifled accents fail—
Railway policemen barred the door, and did, yes they did dare,''!
Deny me entrance—me, I say—me, me myself, the Mayor!
"8trict orders from the platform's view the public to exclude P
Why, fellows, what! We are the Mayor and not the multitude.
Knaves, look at me! How! Don't you see the robes and chain I wear';'
"You can't have no admission here for all you are the Mayor."
Who ever read, or heard, or thought, or dreamt of such a scene?'
Policemen telling their own Mayor he can't approach his Queen'
111 if in England monarchy can ever come to tore,
It will if Jacks in Office stand between it and the Mayor.
A LIFT FOR A LADIES' SCHOOL.
Like every true gentleman, Mr. Punch loves the ladies; and being a
man of mind, he specially loves such of them as mentally are loveable.
I Mr. Punch's love is vast, and embraces all womanity: but, provided they
| be equally devoted and attached to him, he must own that he prefers a
I pretty woman who has brains to a pretty one without them. So Mr.
Punch is ever ready to encourage with his smile any scheme which
| tends to show that there are ladies in existence who not merely have
, brains, but are learning how to use them: and as the Female School of
, Art appears adapted to this end, Mr. Punch thinks it deserving that
I he should say a word for it.
"To make this institution permanent and self-supporting," the Com-
| mittee say they want more scholars and more school-rooms. Whether
the art scholars all wear crinoline or not, the Committee do not state.
Haply some of them have brains enough to counsel its rejection; or
i perhaps it is a rule that the scholars hang their hoops up when they
'enter school, and by sitting with limp skirts, take up as little space as
possible. Be this how it may, the school wants two new class rooms,
and a portion of the building fund is promised by the Government, pro-
vided that the rest of it "be raised by other means." Among these
other means, a bazaar is to be held on the Twenty-third of June, and
people who like walking in the Gardens at South Kensington had better
walk there then. The Prince of Wales is going, and so is the
1 Princess, and so too is Prince Punch. Not a word more need be
said to show that everybody who is anybody, will be present at the
fete, and if you would not be thought a nobody, you had best not keep
away from it.
SOBER AND DISORDERLY.
At a meeting held on Monday last week, in Exeter Hall, under the
auspices of the United Kingdom Alliance for the Suppression of the
Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, the first of a string of resolutions in
favour of Mr. Lawson's now rejected Permissive Bill, having been put
by the Chairman, was carried almost but not quite unanimously, "one
unfortunate person near the door," says the Times, "holding up his
hand against it." Of course you would think that the wretch was
I treated by an assembly convened for the purpose of enforcing sobriety
I with silent contempt. Oh, dear, no !—
"This wu the signal for a tremendous uproar, which was with great difficulty
quelled by the Chairman."
Such, as exhibited by an assembly of agitating teetotallers, is tem-
perance!

TALLYHO THE ORGAN-GRINDER!
Dear Punch,
You know everything, from talking in Chaldce to playing
knurr-and-spell (if I could think of anything more difficult I'd mention
it), so of course vou know that there's a comic song extant called
Tallyho the Grinder! I never heard the song myself, and I don't
desire to hear it, for I detest all singing, save the singing of a tea-
kettle. Still, I really wish that one of your young poets would just
parody this soug, and adapt it to the use of those who hate street
music. Tallyho the Grinder! would be a famous song to sing while
hunting down an organ-man; and I will give you some idea of how 1
think it should be sung. I would suggest that the first verse should
b e written as a solo for the infuriated householder, who, being tortured
p»ast endurance by the grinding of a hand-organ, at length rushes forth
resolved to tallyho the grinder, and hunt him from the street. A duet
might next ensue for him and the policeman, whom he luckily encoun-
ters just outside his doorstep, and by a bit of silver suasion gets to join
him in the chace. The " varmint" having "stolen away " the chorus,
Tallyho the Grinder! might be sung by all the pack of idle dogs who
are about, and who are ever ready to give tongue in a pursuit. When
the chorus flags, the burden of the song might be kept up by the
policemen, each one in rotation when the beast comes on his beat.
Were some such hunting song as this adapted for the sport, the chace
of organ-grinders might become a most exciting and most popular
pursuit, and our streets might soon be cleared from the varmints that
infest tliem; for after every limit, of course, the organ should be broken
up and thrown among the pack.
Trusting some of your young Tennysons may carry out my notion,
and compose a rattling good organ-hunting song, believe me, with much
sympathy for all enraged by street musicians, yours constantly,
I. Ratus.
P.S. If a subscription pack be started to hunt down street mu-
sicians, I know a lot of would-be quiet fellows, like myself, who would
willingly subscribe to it.

POLICE CASE EXTRAORDINARY.
PROCEEDINGS ON REMAND, BEFORE MR. BULL.
(From our own Reporter).
The two disreputable foreigners, Francis-Joseph Charles Haps-
burg, and Frederick-William Louis Hohenzollern,* were brought
up on remand on the charge of assault and highway robbery with
violence, preferred against them by a weakly and undersized Dane,
Christian Glucksbourg. We lhave already described the deplorable
condition of the Complainant. He appeared somewhat recovered from
the effects of the ruffianly treatment which he had experienced from the
Prisoners, though he was still unable to move without crutches, and
complained of severe internal injuries, causing serious intestinal derange-
ment. His face showed several ghastly scars, and his right arm was
still bandaged. His doctors are understood to have recommended
amputation, but to this the sufferer very naturally objects.
In answer to the worthy Magistrate's inquiries, Complainant said that
"he still felt very weak and ill: doubted it he should ever get over the
ill-treatment of the Prisoners, but hadn't lost his pluck for all that. If
he couldn't get back the property that had been taken from him, and
obtain security against future violence, he'd stick to the prosecution,
though it cost him the coat off his back and the shoes off his feet. He
had been violently threatened by the Prisoners' associates since the
former proceedings in this Court. They wished him to compromise
the case and make an agreement with the Prisoners, leaving the
plunder in their hands, and declared if he refused to agree to this, they
would have his life. But he was determined to have Ins rights—if he
died for it."
The plucky manner in which the Complainant expressed this deter-
mination, in spite of the contrast between his weakly and disabled
appearance, and the embodiment of brute force in the brawny, hulking
prisoners, produced a burst of applause in the Court, which was
instantly suppressed by the worthy Magistrate, who said that "much
• See our "Police Report Extraordinary," page 210.
as he admired pluck—and certainly the Complainant appeared a person
of great courage—this was a Court of Justice, in which such expressions
of feeling could not be tolerated."
He wished to know whether, since he had remanded the case, the
Complainant had been able to come to any fair terms with the
Prisoners. He could not approve of anything like compounding of
felony; but here there certainly had been some dispute about title,
which just removed the case from the category of ordinary highway
robbery with violence, and justified a remand with a view to arrange-
ment between the parties.
Glucksbourg said that he had not been able to come to any terms.
The Prisoners' agents had been in occupation of the house, which
formed part of the property in dispute, ever since the assault upon
him, and had been eating and drinking, as he understood, in the most
wasteful and expensive manner, at his expense; they had killed his
cows, calves, sheep, pigs, and fowls; broken into his cellar, and smoked
his tobacco. Then they had kissed his maid-servants repeatedly. . . .
The worthy Magistrate inquired if the maid-servants had lodged any
complaint of that abominable outrage.
Glucksbourg said he was not aware that they had actually applied
for warrants against the offenders, but they were understood to nave
complained .... they did not like being kissed .... not br the
Prisoners' men; they were plain, wore beards, smelt strong of tobacco
and garlic, and had an objection to soap and water .... in fact, they
were pigs, hounds, and schelmen (a German term of abuse and
contempt as we understood from M. Albert, the intelligent inter-
preter).
The ^Prisoners here interposed, and asked if this sort of language
was to be permitted .... It was very painful to their feelings.
The worthy Magistrate said (severely) he should have had more
consideration for the Prisoners' feelings if they had had a little more
consideration for the Complainant's bones and pockets. (Laughter in
Court, in which the Complainant joined.) Still, he would recommend
the Complainant to avoid abusive language.
Complainant said he did not complain so much of their kissing the
maids, nor even of the havoc they had made in his larder and cellar, as

of their continued occupation of the property. They had absolutely
refused to stir, and now declared it was their intention to remain in
possession, in defiance of the European Police. He wished to know if
this was to be put up with. He had asked Inspector Russell to
make a representation to the Prisoners' agents ....
Inspector Russell said he had made a representation—several
representations .... had done nothing but make representations for
the last month, but as yet without effect: they were representations in
writing. He had copies with him which he would be glad to read to
the worthy Magistrate ....
The worthy Magistrate said he had much rather not. There was a
good deal too much representation in writing, he thought, went on in
the Inspector's Office. He thought persons employed in a Police
Station would do well to busy themselves less with pen, ink, and paper,
and more with their bulls'-eyes, truncheons, and handcuffs, and with
looking sharp after suspicious characters and notorious offenders. What
had the Inspector to say as to the reception of his representations by
the Prisoners' agents?
Inspector Russell said he could not say anything very pleasant
.... indeed, if the worthy Magistrate would allow nim. he would
rather not say anything at present .... he was still making repre-
sentations ....
The worthy Magistrate said he took that for granted.
Inspector still hoped that the Prisoners and their friends might be
brought to reason. Had reason to think that the Prisoners had some
shadow of a ground of complaint against Glucksbourg.
The Prisoners here burst into loud asseverations that they were the
most innocent, injured, and ill-used of men: a declaration which called
forth an irrepressible burst of hissing and hooting among the crowd in
Court, which the worthy Magistrate in vain endeavoured to suppress.
The Complainant here muttered something about a Cross—about the
Police being in league with the Prisoners.
Inspector Russell said he protested against such an insinuation.
He had made a suggestion to the Prisoners to give up a considerable
part of the property in dispute; in which case he thought they were not
likely to dispute Complainant's possession of the remainder. Considered
it was part of his duty to make such suggestions—in writing of course;
might nave put it disagreeably for Complainant, but didn't mean to
do so. Hoped the Magistrate was satisfied of that, and approved of
what he had done.
The worthy Magistrate said that might have been all very well before
the Prisoners had committed such a brutal assault. But he must say,
he thought the Inspector had failed grossly in his duty, in not pre-
venting the outrage. He owned he saw the beginning of the fray: he
had been in communication with the Prisoners; he had been appealed
to for protection by the Complainant, and seemed to have promised it.
The Inspector said he only did so conditionally.
The Magistrate did not wish to go into that. He wished to know
why he had not prevented the assault?
The Inspector said he had only a very small force at his command,
and was afraid, if he interfered, the row would spread itself further,
as much excitement prevailed in the neighbourhood. Had generally
found that his interference made matters worse.
The worthy Magistrate said he could not wonder at it, if it was
the sort of interference he seemed to have such a taste for—inter-
ference in writing. It was the duty of the Police to prevent the be-
ginning of these outrages at any hazard. What were the Police for but
to keep the peace? They carried their truncheons for no other pur-
pose, and if, in the fulfilment 'of their duty of keeping the peace, it
became necessary to break the heads of ruffians like the Prisoners,
it might be a disagreeable duty—particularly to the Prisoners—but it
must oe done. As to the offer that had been made to the Complainant,
and which Inspector Russell seemed to have taken upon himself to
pronounce reasonable—he had no sufficient evidence how that might
be, and would at present offer no opinion; but he would remand
the Prisoners for another fortnight, that Complainant might have
time to turn round and think it over. At the, same time lie must
warn the Prisoners, that if they, or their agents, threatened, or other-
wise bullied, or assaulted the Complainant, it would be the worse for
them.
Complainant, who protested vehemently against the arrangement
proposed under the sanction of the Inspector, was led out of Court
by nis daughter, a very interesting young lady, who had stood near her
father during the proceedings, showing him the most filial attentions.
The worthy Magistrate bowed to her on her
the crowd gave her three cheers,
the Court, and

THE DESERTS OF ARMY DOCTORS.
It appears that there is a great dearth of Surgeons in the Army,
particularly in the Indian branch of it. No Assistant-Surgeon has been
gazetted for the Indian service since 1861. Such is the statement of
'X" in the Morning Post, and according to "A Sufferer," writing
in the same paper, Government has adopted a singularly likely measure
to remedy the surgeon famine amongst Her Majesty's forces in
India:—
'The pay and allowances have always hitherto been equal to £1,200 a-year, hut
now reduced to £800, so that at one sweep every Regimental Burgeon In India
is at once deprived of £400 a-year of this hard-earned'
As we tell the plundered Danes, half a loaf is better than no bread,
and £S00 to £1,200 is as more than half a loaf, according to Cocker,
or Colenso, who is an authority at any rate on this sort of numbers.
But the expenses of living in India leave an officer little to bless himself
with out of an income of £800; so that there is moderation in "A
Sufferer's" remark that:—
"After this, if medical men can still bo found to enter the Army, then, I say
they richly deserve all they get."
Certainly they do; and very much more.
Mr. Bass's Bill.
For the removal of Street'Nuisances, we do not want the "Law as
it Stands;" but we require it to be put in -motion against all Organ
Grinders and other unmusical wretches, with one great sweeping order
to "Move on!"

berry Bush—difficult quadrille, this Lancers, with the great rotatory
figure—set to her, 0, ah, thanks—hope I didn't tread upon your dress—

tion, perhaps—now, ladies, all round us—here we go round the Mulberry
Bush, the Mulberry Bush, the Mulberry Bush. You can't think how
pretty you all look from the gallery when you make that deep slow
curtsey. Why didn't I stay in the gallery, then, if I liked it so much?
Because I liked better to be down here, dancing with somebody who
doesn't appreciate my feelings. Let's go and have some ice. Not yet,
very well. That—yes, that is Lord Morn. Looks as pleasant as his
name? Very neat—I'll tell him what you say. How well the Masons
look to-night with their collars and stars and badges? Am I a

alike on most subjects. Not to flatter myself? May I flatter you?
No, I don't think I could—one never flatters when—Mamma looking at

useless. The only paragraph which he has forwarded is as follows.—Ed. Punch.)
The merry undergraduates had early crowded the upper gallery of
Sir Christopher's beautiful theatre, and their shouts could be heard
long before you reached the famous edifice. Entering, you beheld a
brilliant array of ladies in what may be called the dress circle, while a
miscellaneous mass of masculine humanity filled the pit. The cheers
and jokes of the students occupied an hour, and then the organ* spoke
out, the anthem was heard, the great doors opened, a lane was formed
through the crowd, and an awful procession of Dons entered, and
ascended to the seats of dignity, the Vice-Chancellor himself taking
the chair of Lord Derby. Small reverence had the high blooded youth
of England, on this day, for those dread Dons, and chaff was poured out
like hail. The Vice-Chancellor vainly tried to be heard, and looked
rather more angry than was necessary. But the forms were observed,
and at length the red-gowned candidates (we do not forget the
meaning of candidatus) for the honours of the day were intro-
duced. A tall and stately Beresford, Archbishop, a closely shaven
and gentlemanly French historian, Thierry, the thoughtful presence
of Arthur Helps, were noted with approbation, Ireland was honoured
in Lord Bandon, and Money in Lord Overstone. But the cheers
of the undergraduates were few, and somewhat cynical, until one
man ascended, and stood by Travers Twiss. As soon as the name
was known, a shout arose that might almost have been heard at the
General Post Office. Sin Rowland Hill came to receive his crowning
honour—the Man of Letters in the Home of Learning. Again and
again came the cheering, in a storm and had the grateful under-
graduates known that an earnest and thoughtful face, with white hair
around it, on the Vice-Chancellor's right, was that of a brother who
had come to see his brother receive his guerdon, another cheer would
have gone out for Matthew Davenport Hill. The new D.C.L.
took his seat amid renewed plaudits, and the theatre has never echoed
to cheers bestowed more worthily than by Oxford of 1864 upon the
great civilizcr of the day.
[Cordially approved. Otitic omnia! We have only to add that our Correspondent,
having certainly done his duty in recording the above gratifying event, appears to
have taken himself off to St. John's College, to the ftle mentioned in bis first
rigmarole, and somewhat later, to have secretly departed in company with a lovely
heiress, to whom he was next day united, as may be seen in the Timet of Saturday.

Bernal Osborne touching the
of the Conference:—
"Tho noble Lord had told the House

was that they had now arrived at the

Lord knew that if by answers such as
he had just given, he could veil himself
behind his position of a negotiator—If
he could put of? from day to day the
necessity of giving the House of Com-
mons the account which he was bound
to render—if he could put oft* any ex-
planation until the summer was so far
advanced that ho could not be called to

(Chtert.) And to the noble Lord and
those who sat with him the welfare of
Denmark, the maintenance of treaties,
and tho upholding of the pledged
word of England were trifles compared
with that which was paramount in
their minds—the advanced state of the
Session. (Cheert, and criet of * Oh I')."
This is plain speaking, as plain as speaking can be to be parliamentary.
It imputes to Lord Palmerston conduct which, out of Parliament,
might, in language not at all too strong to be applicable, be called that
of a traitor and a scoundrel.
But how can we sufficiently express our admiration for a statesman,
whether rising or risen, whose conscience will permit him, and whose
confidence will enable him, to accuse Lord Palmerston to his face of
sacrificing the righteous cause, and his country's faith and honour, to a
base desire to retain office? Of course the statesman who can dare to
bring such an accusation against such a man. must feel strong in the
consciousness of belonging to a party whose leaders not only never ask
questions tending to hinder the public service, in the hope of damaging
the Government which they wish to supplant, but also never make
common cause with a Liberal placehunter who does ask questions of
that kind from displeasure at being out of place. "What stronger
breastplate than a heart untainted? The statesman, who feels that
under his ribs, is thrice armed, or rather four times, for around his
breast there are robur et ees triplex; not only the robur, British oak, the
symbol of Conservative principles, but also-the <es triplex: which
appears to fortify the brow if not the bosom of Lord R. Cecil.

A YORKSHIRE SHEPHERD.
Amongst contemporary events which ought to be commemorated,
may be noticed the retirement from the service of his employers, of a
very meritorious Shepherd. This is Mr. E. Shepherd, six years
Assistant-Governor, and then thirty-two years Governor of the West
Riding Prison. He retires on account of the exigences of his health.
Mr. Shepherd introduced the Silent System into the prison discipline
of England in 1833. Though the silent system has made much noise,
many people will now first know to whom the country is indebted for
that Pythagorean improvement in penal probation.
The management of the West Riding Prison, as conducted by Mr.
Shepherd, saves the West Riding about £7000 per annum. He has
rendered it in a great measure self-supporting, as a House of Correction
which is at the same time a manufactory of goods in cocoa-nut fibre.
The sum of £7000 a-year is somewhat preferable to the results of unpro-
ductive labour, isn't it P
Mr. Shepherd has also established a successful Reformatory Insti-
tution, an "Industrial Home," in the neighbourhood of the Wakefield
Prison. It pays its own expenses, and has 300 reformed rogues, out of
734 rogues, to show as the fruits of its working. So that this Shepherd
has act null v contrived to whiten some of those black sheep that have
constituted the flocks committed to his custody.
The facts above specified are stated in a memorial addressed by Mr.
Shepherd to the Magistrates whom he has served so long, and they
have done themselves the honour to refer to the Visiting Justices "the
consideration of a retiring pension to be granted to Mr. Shepherd to
the full extent allowed by law," which he will get, of course. In
justice to the Justices of the West Riding it is necessary to remark
that the liberality which handsomely remunerates long and faithful
services is particularly creditable to those who are themselves the
"Great Unpaid."

PEACE OFFERINGS AT THE PALACE.
There are so many pretty things to look at in the Crystal Palace
that, even if you were an Argus, you, with all your hundred eyes, might
miss seeing one half of them when you spend an afternoon there. Some
of the prettiest things, however, you will find in the Art-Union Court,
and if you have not seen them you had better go next Saturday, and
get presented at this court, for which, you may as well be warned, a
court suit is not necessary. You will find the Prince of Wales and his
Princess at the court, and when you leave it, if you like, you may put
them in your pocket. To this privilege, however, you will only be
entitled by becoming a Subscriber to the Crystal Palace Art Union,
which you may do by merely paying one, two, three, or five guineas,
as may suit your income and your inclination. Besides the Pnnce and
Princess, you will also be permitted to put Shakspeare in your
pocket, if four guineas be paid; and as he (at the Crystal Palace) is
only thirteen inches high, his presence in your coat-tail will not much
incommode you.
If you wish to make your wife a present for her drawing-room (and
this, after the Derby Day, you perhaps may think expedient), you will
find in this Art Union many articles of vertu which will atone for any
vice you may, in her opinion, have committed on that day. Moreover,
for each guinea you subscribe you get a chance of winning something
in the Prize Distribution; and if you chance to -have been born beneath
a lucky star, you may get a prize of very much more value than you ever
gained at school. So, after the next concert, go and be presented at
the Art-Union Court; and when you have appeased your wife and
enriched her drawing-room, be grateful to your Punch for teaching yon
how to do so.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June 131 A. Monday. We like the persistence of the Yorkshire men, who are not
inclined to say die about the removal of the Assizes to dirty, smoky, crowdy
Leeds. It is true that the Order in Council has been made, that Judges 'Black-
burn and Keating have made an appointment for interviews with gentlemen
who are to come under the unfavourable notice of twelve of their countrymen,' and
that the Leeds folk have been artfully incurring expenses to prepare Courts, in
order to be able to talk about good faith and all that. The sturdy men who desire
that Wakefield should be the place don't care for all this, they have a good case
(which they should have been prompter to press) and Lord Wharncliffe fought
their battle to-night in the Lords, carrying, by 80 to 54, an address for recon-
sidering the decision, and Mr. Estcourt has given notice of a similar motion in
the Commons. At the end of the week the Queen sent word that the above
appointment must stand, but that the subject was quite open to re-consideration as
regards subsequent Assizes. Now, Yorkshire, stick to your work.
More Public Schools talk in the Lords, and it appears that Lord Granville,
speaking of the merits of some of the Christ Church men, let out something which
one of the Examiners writes to say his Lordship had no right to tell, and also told
inaccurately. Later in the week the Bill, on which so much has been said, passed,
after an eulogium by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe on the English Schools.
We dare say that they are better than those in Turkey, though the Turks do not
torture little boys, nor take away their blankets on a cold night, to warm bigger
boys. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe states that these Schools form character.
This is a safe statement, as proof and disproof are alike impossible, and we must
accept the declaration that the Public Boys are like the Welsnman's Owl, and that
if they can't talk (especially French) they are beggars to think.
A Bill about fishing at Heme Bay was read a Second Time in the Commons.
We have not seen this measure, but hope that it does not propose to interdict the
harmless amusement of trying to catch white salmon from on the long pier, because,
as one never catches anything but cold and chaff, it is hard to say that vested in-
terests are injured by the process. Has the one policeman been examined. H not,
we shall have the Bill sent to a Select Committee, for the sake of the tradesmen
who let on lease the most remarkable fishing-rods that ever amused the congregation
of St. Antony.
Government, having been compelled to keep the present
National Gallery, means to make us feel what we have been
about. Mr. Cowper proposes to enlarge the place at an
expense of £300,000. Moreover, he will not say that he
intends to give the Academicians immediate notice to quit.
We are open to a bet that unless the Ministry go out, the
Lion-column will be finished long before the improved Gal-
lery, and that all complaints will be met by a taunt about
Burlington House. The official mind is obstinate and
slightly spiteful.
Three times this week has Lord Palmerston declared,
with emphasis, that he knew nothing about what was going
on in the Conference. Once he answered, tartly, that he
was not a member of that body, and therefore could give
no information. It is rumoured that he is discontented
with the non-proceedings, but we shall hear all about it
some time or other. The House takes his replies very
good-humouredly.
We had a debate on the case of Azeem Jah, who claims
the title of Nawab of the Carnatic. We have some idea
what the last word means, because a poet (the poets are
your best embalmers) once told us to beware ot Russia,
and that—
11 By Allah the Awful, if late by a sun,
The Carnatic will stablo tho steed* of the Don."
But about his Highness, Jah who is alleged to have been
wronged by the East India Company, we own to having
known little until Mr. Smollett recited his History. Mr.
Lowe said that the Nawabs had been traitors, and though
our transactions had not been such as we (need to be par-
ticularly proud of, there was no use in reviving such
stories, and so thought the House. We had, however,
some sharp words, for the Attorney-General had been rude
enough to laugh, and no Member of the Government had
spoken. Sir Roundell, (who is not a laughing man, but
may have been put into a merry mood bv a certain task
which he was daily performing, that of editing a Family
Library edition of some difficult love-letters, for the Peers
of England) explained his laugh, and Pam said that Minis-
ters would not reply in debate, if they are not allowed to
finish discussions, instead of being replied upon. This must
have amused Mr. Disraeli.
We guaranteed a New Zealand loan, and were told that
General Cameron was pounding Sir Cannibal Tattoo
in great style.
Tuesday. The Lords united in a tribute of praise to Sir
Rowland Hill, and in the grant of £20,000 to that illus-
trious D.C.L. Lord Brougham spoke out warmly touch-
ing the incalculable advantages which the middle and
lower classes had derived from the facilities afforded for
correspondence. The upper classes are not much of the
"writing sort." as Mb. Carlyle says, but education and
reformed public schools will in time make those classes
also aware of the utility of letters.
Many thousands of children are overworked, but other-
wise shamefully neglected, in various Factories, and an
excellent Bill, for bringing the poor little creatures under
the provisions of the Factory Acts, was read a Second
Time. Its chief promoter is Mr. Austin Henry Bruce,
Under-Secretary for the Home Department, and the chil-
dren should be told the name of tliis worthy Welshman.
Mr. Darby Griffiths does not see why the Post-
master-General should be a Peer. Nor docs Mr. Punch,
and he intends to be in his place when Mr. Griffiths
extorts from some Minister the red tape reasons for the
existing custom.
An Income-Tax debate arose, Mr. Hubbard, the inde-
fatigable, once more attacking the present unjust and cruel
tax. His objections to it are, however, somewliat better
than the system he would substitute, aud of course Mr.
Gladstone was ready with a reply. Mr. Bovill said—
and let it be recorded to his honour—that " nothing could
justify taxing jtesh and blood, brains and intellect, at the
same rate as realised property." Mr. Hubbard expressed
his confidence in the ultimate triumph of the principles
he advocated. They will triumph some day, but not until
millions of money shall have been wickedly exacted from
the class which, from its love of industry and order, is the
easy victim of clumsy financiers. But some day the middle
class will put out its strength, and then terrified Chan-
cellors of Exchequer will begin disgorging like leeches
when you salt them.
Then we debated on Irish Education. Protestantism is

from crime by the reflection that if convicted he would be beggared.
Mr. Whiteside thought that hanging a man was almost enough
punishment. Mr. Forster's Bill was read a Second Time.
Thursday. Some time this Session we are fo have the Lords' Report
on the system of over-working Milliners and Dressmakers. Of course
such creatures can wait, though their employers' customers can't.
A good hearing in the Commons. Ships are off to fetch away the
troops who have oeen engaged in the Ashantee War. But there was
a frightful story told next night, and a catastrophe, which red tape
thought much more frightful, nearly followed.
What is to be said to the blatant Ferbahd, who burst on the Com-
mons to-night with one of his choicest orations against the Charity
Inspectors? There was much truth, of the most disagreeable kind, in
what he said, and no doubt the Whigs have grabbed all the patronage
in the most unblushing manner, and the antecedents of some of the
folks whom they have appointed are not brilliant. That was just the
sort of case for Mr. Ferrand, and he revelled in it. The Minister
said that there was no objection to inquiry, but that Mr. Ferrand's
language was so offensive that there could be no acceding to his propo-
sition, and Mr. J. A. Smith reminded the House that in 1844 the
Commons had branded Mr. Ferrand with a charge of calumny. By
116 to 40 his motion was rejected. But if some gentleman would bring
the matter on, the result might be diiferent.
Then we had a long Supply debate, and some good fun about the
Pope and Mr. Odo Russell (who privately talks to his Holiness about
England, because, as we will not receive an ecclesiastical envoy—
Jupiter knows why !—we cannot have regular relations with Rome),
and Lord Palmerston defended the tone that had been taken,
"because the House was in a merry humour." Why should it not be
merry, when voting away thousands of sovereigns? The Monileur,
speaking of M. Renan, says that * men of intellect always display irri-
tation when you talk to them of so low a thing as money. The House
of Commons was not irritated, though the subject was much pressed
upon it, but we would by no means draw an impertinent conclusion.
Friday. The small trader (who has a vote) is too strong, at present,
for the working man, and the Chancellor has withdrawn his County
Courts Bill, for the relief of the latter, as he believed that the measure
would notpass in the Commons.
Lord Ellenborough, with a view to intervention in behalf of
Denmark, demanded whether our fleet were equal at once to the
blockade of the German ports and the defence ot the Danish islands.
Lord Russell, guarding himself in a generality, said that the fleet was
prepared for any service it might be called on to render. Lord Derby
said that if the Conference led to no definite issue Parliament would no
longer allow its voice to be stifled. The Government organs give very
significant hints to the Germans that England may fight, and the French
organs say that if the war be resumed, she must.
Lord Gage is unhappy because chapters from the Apocrypha are
sometimes read in church, and so is Lord Ebury, because, he says,
that work contains things which it is "unpleasant to read in the
presence of ladies." Lord Lyttleton reminded the delicate nobles
that the same remark applies, with greatly increased force, to the Jewish
Scriptures. The Bishops op London and Oxford stated that there
were very noble passages in the Apocrypha, and the latter Bishop said
that Lord Ebury, by reading them, would become, not a sadder but a
wiser man. Lord Gage's anti-Apocryphal Bill was wit hdrawn.but we have
no objection to console him with a new title, that of Lord Greengage.
But in the Commons the Government was all but killed. The
proceedings were curious. A debate on the Ashantee war was opened
by Sir John Hay, who lost a brother in the expedition, and all but
avenged him by destroying the Government. After a long and earnest
discussion, closed by a fiery encounter between the Premier and the
Opposition leader, there was a division on Sir John'3 motion, which
was practically a vote of censure in respect to the Ashantee affair. The
numbers were 283 to 226, the Government getting a majority of seven
only, in a House of 459 Members. The Opposition, cheering was
thunderous for about three minutes. So this week the Parliamentary
squib finished with a good bang.

General Remarks.—June is sometimes one of the summer months in
London. There is no certainty about the matter.
Housekeeper's Tablet.—Peculiar mode of preparing Salmon for Dinner.
—Purchase a Salmon alive. Let it go without anything to eat for
four-and-twenty hours, it will then be thoroughly prepared for dinner.
Whitebait are really young whales. To the taste for this delicacy,
providentially, as says Mr. Quatremain, implanted in our countrymen's
gullets, do we owe it that the sea is still navigable.
Domestic.—When your husband brings home a friend to dinner
unexpectedly, overwhelm the guest with continued) apologies for the
scantiness of the meal. Frown at your husband, and do not permit him
to take twice of any dish. ,
The most Economical Method of getting a nice little cold Dinner for
Four.—Order it to be hot for One.
Bad Day.—The 22nd of June is a bad day for lending anyone £100.
This may be very generally applied throughout the year.
Advice.—In June and July avoid mad dogs.
Fishing.—Glitter attracts mackerel. Nearly all fish may be taken
with tin. Try the experiment at any fishmonger's, who will tell you the
quantity of tin required.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY BUTLER.
[A TALE OF PBIDE AND PUNISHMENT.
PART n.
PUNISHMENT.
I have a cart, a homely cart,
Which carries to and fro
My servants, when they come, depart.
Or on a visit go.
For my new man I sent that same,
And sore perplexed was I,
When piled with luggage, back it came,
But he came in a fly!
I went to scold, but when I met
My butler, courteous, bland,
Obsequiously polite, and yet
Extmguishingly grand.
More calm, more self-possessed, more neat
From boot to well-brushed hair,
Than certain of my guests he'd meet,
And wait behind their chair.
And when he bowed and spoke to me
ifk. voice to calm and soothe)
'o-day's Times would I please to See?
Just ironed, dry and smooth.
I could not chide, perhaps I'd best
At once the trick declare,
And own, a coward fool confest.
To chide I did not dare!
No! from the very first he took
Me as his lawful prize;
And though my slave in tone and look,
Began to patronise.
In tone: yet something in mine ear
Still said, with quiet ease,
"Of course you will not interfere;
I'm from the Earl of G.'s."
In look: yet did I ofttimes see
The question in his face,
"j'How could you bring a man like me
To such a poky place.P"
The way he moved, his'stately tread,
Made all my rooms look small:
I could have punched that builder's head
Who planned my narrow hall.
I showed him o'er my cellars, stocked
With wines and eau de vie,
And when we left, he calmly locked
The door, and kept the key.
He "nuts out'
My ties
what he likes, each day
est Lafitte doth flow,
And yet I dare not say him nay,
My Lord of G. does so.
I have two suits of evening dothest,
The one for common wear,
And one, by Poole, which only goes
Out on occasions rare.
Or rather used to gd, for now
It comes out every day,—
"The worn-out blacks" he told me how
"Of course he'd put away."
My "tops," 't is true, are'white as snow,
My boots like f
„ ' jet,
My buckskins all I wish, but oh!
The bills for paste I get.
• • • • •
In every country neighbourhood
Presides some gorgeous swell.
Who doth by wealth or noble blood
All meaner folk excel.
Our grandees are exalted high
From their abundant means;
In house, dress, equipage, none vie
With the De Wtnton Greenes.
Such glass, such crockery, and plate!
A menu so refined!
My cook for days I seem to hate
When with the Greenes I've dined.
And when, with condescension sweet,
They come to dine with us,
These potentates wc ever treat
With great parade and fuss.
And knowing the great love they bear
To their high-sounding name,
Our butlers we instruct with care
How to give out the same.
They came one night, begemmed and flounced,
And grand as kings and queens,—
"Mr. and Mrs." (he announced)
"And two Miss Winter Greenes!"
And though with sham simplicity
And mock respect 'twas done;
The truth still twinkled in his eye.
"I '11 rile these snobs for fun!
And then to see, all dinner through,
The supercilious Stare
With which my butler deigned to view
The other servants there:
Gazing with calm disdain, as though
He said, " 'Twixt you and me
There's no resemblance—union—no
Butter'i Analogy"
As for the Reverend Jones's man,
A fresh-caught, country lout,
Before the second course began,
He coolly turned him out.
I marked in Reverend Jones's mien
A change;—I saw him wince;—
And on our friendship there has been
A chilhiess ever since.
» • • • •
Oh, if there be, as I believe,
Grim spirits in the air,
Who love to see us mortals grieve,
And dance at our despair—
How must they chuckle to proclaim,
And glory to deride,
The anguish, punishment, and shame
Of my poor fallen pride!
MR. GLADSTONE'S MORNING CONCERT.
A Concert was given yesterday morning to the Right Hon. the
Chancellor op the Exchequer, in front of his private( residence at
Carlton Terrace. The entertainment commenced by a'' vocal and
instrumental performance of nigger-minstrels, who executed a variety
of national airs. The programme included :—
M Polly Perkins" SNOBsoy.
March from Fawt Goitnod.
"The Young Man from the Country " . . . Gentkins,
The Dark Girl Dressed In Bluo" . . . . Beest.
*' Still so Gently" Bellini.
Sestet—" We've got no Work to do" . . . Cadoebs.
Fantasia on Violin Bloke.
Recitative—" My Christian Friends" . . . Mdvper.
Pot-Pourri LaxdlAuper.
The first five pieces of the foregoing list were performed on the
grinding organ by Signor Spobchini, of Genoa and Saffron Hill, who
encored himself several times. Cadgers's popular invocation of public
charity was characteristically rendered by a party of singers in white
aprons, who personated mechanics out of employ; a lot well known to
the police. The fantasia of that obscure composer, Bloke, was inter-
preted by Mr. Milbank in his usual style; and the blindman's Appeal,
My Christian Friends," was effectively delivered by Bampield. A
German band performed. Landlatjfer's medley of polkas, waltzes, and
overtures, and did, in every respect, full justice to the composer's name.
The effect produeed on Mr. Gladstone, by the performances above
specified, in regard to street music, was, it is said, a determination to
support instead of opposing Mr. Bass's Bill for the abatement of that
nuisance.
An Eton Fag.—No, child, majora cammuu does not mean "let us
cane the bigger boys," but we could expect no better scholarship from
you, and we appreciate the wish that was father to the translation.
THE LEGAL GAME OF FORFEITS.
The House of Commons has been behaving itself pretty well lately.
It has kicked out Somes's Bill and Lawson's Bill, and it is going to
give a Second Reading to Mr.,Charles Forster's Forfeiture of Lands
and Goods Bill. As the law is, anybody convicted of the slightest
offence which may be nominally a lelony, forfeits land and goods;
whereas a villain found guilty of the grossest crime, if it be legally only
a misdemeanor, forfeits nothing. Manslaughter by misfortune, for
which a just iudge would award five minutes' imprisonment, entails
forfeiture. Ihus a British and brutish jury may be enabled to ruin a
poor doctor, for example, who has had the ill-luck to kill a patient
in endeavouring to save his life.
By forfeiture of land and goods the innocent family of a felon is
punished as well as himself. If he is hanged or transported for life, it
touches them alone.
These wrongs considered, can it be conceived that any Member of
Parliament could have been capable of opposing Mr. Forster's measure
designed to right them? That measure was, however, opposed by
Mr. W. Hunt, the representative of North Northamptonshire. What
manner of men must the men of North Northamptonshire be? Shall
you not think that ithe majority of them, with respect to legislation,
have the intelligence of asses and the moral sense of pigs, if they re-elect
Mb.W.iHdntP _____
Ecclesiastical.
A Traveller on the Eastern Counties Line wishes to know when
Bishop Stortford was consecrated?
We can not inform him.
It is rumoured that Signor Tamberlik is to be created an Italian
Bishop, with a see in alt.
Leah.—The Great Leah Bateman has left us: let us console our<
selves with a Greenwich dinner, and the little White Bait, man.

CONTINENTAL TOURISTS' COMPANY (LIMITED).
Abbreviated Prospectus.
This Company has been formed in order to supply a long-felt want.
This want is, solely and only, of money in the pockets of the Promoters
and Directors.
It must be evident to every one who has been in any way interested
in the statistics of our vast and increasing population, that there are
thousands among us, who, either from want of means, time, or oppor-
tunity, are totally unable to quit their own native country and inspect
for themselves the beauties of Foreign Lands. Li the first of these
just mentioned positions have been placed for many years the present
Promoters and Directors of this Company. They now propose to
remove these existing disabilities, and to afford themselves ample means
for visiting the most distant parts of the habitable Globe.
Arrangements have already been made by which the best rooms in
the first-class Continental Hotels can be secured for the Travelling
Directors, who will spare no expense in the interests of the Share-
holders.
The practical control of affairs will be placed in the hands of a
Manager, who is a gentleman of sound experience, and who has passed,
during the greater part of his life, from city to town, from town to
village, from village to mere encampments, adopting the most econo-
mical principles.
With a view to purchasing a Special Private Hotel, there will be an
additional Deposit made upon the Shares, and the Directors will take
a Site.
Further particulars, with a Form of Application for Shares, &c, See,
will be shortly issued.
At the Opera.
"Oh, that dear duck, Mario, how like a nightingale he sings!"
exclaimed a gushing girl the other night to Lord Dundreary, "W-well,
no, I c-can't see that p-p-precisely," said his Lordship, "il any fella's
lite a n-n-nightingale, it must be Jug-jug-lini!"
THE FRITH OF FROME.
There is a place called Frome, which elects Lord Edward Thtttse,
as it has a perfect right to do. and which has just had a Conservative
banquet, to which, if the Mechanics, in whose Hall it took place, have
no objection, we have none. The two Lords Thtnne were the aris-
tocracy at this feast, and it might seem that the Committee were hard
up for speakers, as a martial parson had to propose the health of the
Army, Navy, Yeomanry, and Volunteers. Another parson made a little
speech, which has caught the Rev. Mr. Punch's eye:—
"The Rev. E. C. Frith in the course of his remarks, said that though he could
not quite agree with what was said in the House of Commons the other day, that
every Churchman must necessarily be a Conservative, still he thought the propo-
sition might be inverted, and that it might be said, every good Churchman should
be a Conservative."
Mr. Frith is no doubt a good man, but if his sermons are framed on
the model of the above sentence, we should 'prefer attending his
church when he didn't preach. It really is not "inverting " Bobbt
Cecil's nonsense to prefix "good" to Churchman, and to substitute
for the verb of necessity the preterite of shall, as an auxiliary verb
denoting obligation. Is this Conservative grammar? If so, no wonder
that the party forgets its antecedents and quarrels with its relatives.
Pleasant American News.
(for Once.)
Lx the interest of all the playgoers, Mr. Punch contradicts, (on au-
thority) the statement that Miss Bateman "is about to leave the
Stage, and marry a gallant officer in Her Majesty's Service." Miss
Batbkan is not going to leave the Stage, nor to marry any officer,
gallant or otherwise. It] is true, however, that she is engaged, and it
is to Mr. Webster, and will fulfil her vow by appearing at nis theatre
early in the new year. Public writers have no business to rend our
bosoms with false tidings, and those who spread perturbing reports
ought to be made to pay for the cab we took to ascertain the fact, and
the champagne we had to drink before we could allay our agitation.
