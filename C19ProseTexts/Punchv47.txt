PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\'97December 31, 1864.\
\
Me. Punch is in his Library, smoking. Mrs. Punch in an arm-chair, knitting a Counterpane. The faithful Toby\
announces "The Earl of Derby."\
1VTR- PUNCH. Admit him to The Presence. Don't go, Judina. The Earl is a very delightful person.\
-"-I Mrs. P. No, dear, I am not dressed,\'97and look at my liuir.\
Mr. P. Since I was first tangled in its meshes, I never saw it looking prettier.\
Mrs. P. Nonsense, you great goose. [Exit.\
Enter Lord Derby, with two books.\
Lord D. (whose quick eye catches sight of a crinoline and graceful head vanishing through a bookcase door.) Good\
morning, Mr. Punch. But\'97I fear I have disturbed a pleasanter interview.\
Mr. P. I was merely checking the washing-bill for the week, my dear Lord. Take the chair vacated by my\
Chancellor of the Exchequer.\
Lord D. (seats himself). Some people say that there is a Chancellor of the Exchequer ready to take another chair\
when vacated.\
Mr. P. Do they? I know nothing about politics. (Hands cigar-case.)\
Lord D. That's a little too strong.\
Mr. P. I assure you no. It is quite mild.\
Lord D. I didn't mean the cigar, but the assertion. You, who know every move on the board, and could play\
the game\'97or six games\'97blindfolded.\
Mr. P. Only one\'97Blindman's Buff. I like that at Christmas, because it compels one to feel for one's fellow-\
creatures.\
Lord D. Very good, vjry good.\
Mr. P. Praise from Sir Hubert\'97that is, from Edwabd\'97Stanley, is\'97and so forth. And what have you got\
there? I am glad to see that you are not too great a man to carry things for yourself.\
Lord D. (winks.) I can't always carry everything I should like to carry. But as for books, a great Oxford Don\
told me, in my youth, that there were three things any gentleman might have under his arm\'97a book, a gold-headed cane,\
and a handsome woman. Apropos of the latter, I again apologise for having sent Mrs. Punch out of the room.\
Mr. P. I scorn to repay your courtesy, my dear Derby, by remarking that Conservatives have not alwayB been so\
scrupulous about turning out women.\

iv PREFACE. [December 31, 1864.\
Lord L>. Ha! ha! I despise a man who would stop a good thing because it might annoy a friend.\
Mr. P. Tou are right. It is easier to make new friends than new jokes. And what is that handsome book,\
bound, I can see at this distance, by Hatdat? Don't make a joke about hey-day, please.\
Lord D. Wasn't going to. This is a copy of my Homer, and I beg you to accept it.\
Mr. P. "Kings begged of a beggar." Beggar as I am in thanks, I thank you. I have also to thank you for tie\
pleasure I have already received from a careful perusal of the volumes.\
Lord D. Have you really found time? How do you manage?\
Mr. P. By the simple process of neglecting a duty when I am offered a pleasure.\
Lord D. I would not hear your enemy\'97if you have one\'97say so.\
Mr. P. I am sure that you will never have the opportunity, as you do not keep company with my only enemies,\
knaves and fools. Let me just ray that I consider your Homer a masterly performance, honourable to you, and valuable\
to your countrymen, and I hope you like the cigar?\
Lord D. So well that I shall ask you to fill my case\'97a very fine brand indeed. Talking of Brand reminds me,\
Shall we go in for a division?\
Mr. P. What says the tailor P\
Lord L>. Well, if he counted for nine, we could do the thing comfortably.\
Mr. P. Till he does, stick as you be.\
Lord D. Ah! But you talk Pam.\
Mr. P. By Jove, or shall I say by Zeus, (you are quite right, by the way, not to Greekify the names\'97I can't\
read Lane's Arabian Nights, because he hadn't your good sense). I don't talk Pam half as much as every Conservative\
who offers himself. The first thing your men do at the hustings is to declare Palmers-ton the national favourite. In\
the face of that fact divide\'97and conquer.\
Lord D. Of course J see that, but then I wear spectacles.\
Mr. P. Order a gross for your friends\'97green ones, if you like. But bother politics, I tell you I don't care about\
them. I am very glad that you have been turning to fresh fields and pastures new. Isn't Achilles pleasanter company\
than the Angel?\
Lord D. Mr. Disraeli is extremely pleasant company, Mb. Punch. And he is more like A chilles than you\
remember, for be records that in earlier life he " stood on the plains of Troy, and cursed his destiny."\
Mr. P. Well be might, considering that it was to lead politicians whose talk is of bullocks, and to win the odd\
trick with politicians whose talk is bulls. There, don't be angry!\
Lord D. I was never angry in my life\'97but we 're a big Party.\
Mr. P. Granted; but the nation's a bigger. Going? Well, one thing more. That is a beautiful bit in your\
translation where Glatjctjs and Diomed change armour.\
Lord D. Glad you like it. I have at least given back the sense, which Pope perverted, and have made Jupiter\
deprive Glatjctjs of his judgment before he made the bad bargain.\
Mr. P. In exchange for Diomed's brass armour, price nine oxen, Glatjctjs gives him a golden suit, price a\
hundred. I will be Glauctjs, pro hdc vice. I have not lost my judgment, but, as you have given me your Homer, I give\
you (smiles sweetly) my\

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.\
JUNE 80M. Monday. Really, in the best of the Season, it is not the\
thing to expect the (fay young Viscount Punch to be attending\
Parliament. He has enough to do in what is philosophically called the\
"reflex of energy," namely, the pursuit of pleasure. And though he\
cordially agrees with the late Sir G. C. Lewis, who said, inimitably,\
that fife would be very tolerable, but for its pleasures," the ladies\
have claims upon him which he is not the nobleman to ignore. What\
with his flower-shows, his morning-concerts (you dear Grisi, you are\
worth all the young ones, yet), his garden-parties, his fetes, his horti-\
cultural bazaars, his Alexandra Park, his botanic gardens, his dinners\
at Grinnage and the Etoile el Jarretiire, his operas, his balls, ,\
"Hastati potiua, Gynuque, et Polka\'97mipremus\
Sub matituna luce, Rogerus Eques."\
to say nothing of Paddy Green's, of which, however, he could say\
much that would be acceptable to many a "dear fellow," the Viscount\
finds little time for his senatorial duties. However, he looks into\
Parliament when he remembers it, and happens to be in the neigh-\
bourhood. Indeed, his determination to study and thoroughly compre-\
hend the magnificent "Moses " with which Mr. Herbert has adorned\
the Palace of Westminster, has taken the Viscount to that edifice\
pretty regularly of late.\
To-day there was a dramatic entrance in the Commons, where as a\
rule a member's exit is more pleasant to behold and see. Everybody,\
naturally, desired a Ministerial statement about the Conference, and as\
to what England was going to do, and Mr. Disraeli led off with three\
solemn questions on the subject. Mb. Gladstone told him to put his\
queries on the paper for next day. "Oh!" cried Members. Mr.\
Disraeij said that such questions might properly be put without\
notice. '* Hear!" cried the House. Mr. Osborne wished to know\
what Lord Russell meant by saying that the British Fleet was pre-\
pared for any service. Mb. Gladstone objected to further questions\
m the absence of Lord Palmebston. Mr. Fitzgerald said that\
every Minister must know all about the matter, and hoped that answers\
would be insisted on. Mr. Dabby Gbiffith, received as usual with\
"much laughter," nevertheless told a home truth, for he said that the\
Government was notoriously divided on the Danish question. More-\
over, he hoped that if the Conference did not arrange matters satisfac-\
torily, England would put forth her Naval Strength. "Hear, hear!"\
cried a great many voices. Loud John Manners said that it was the\
duty of Lord Palmebston to be in his\
Enter Lord Palmebston. Loud cheers.\
Lord John Mannebs and Mb. Osbobne instantly set upon him for\
information.\
Viscount Palmebston said that when Lobd Russell replied that\
the fleet was ready to go anvwhere, he meant that it was prepared for\
any service, and so it was. He declined giving any further explanations,\
except that when the armistice should be over, the war would recom-\
mence, unless an arrangement were made.\
Mr. Bright, in a very sweet manner, said that he never asked\
questions, nor would he do so then, but he thought that Lord\
Palmebston would get on better if he would tell all he could.\
Lord Palmebston regretted to be obliged to repeat, that for the\
present his Tongue was Tied.\
Later in the week, when every one knew that the Conference could\
or would settle nothing, it was announced that the untying the tongues\
of the Premier and the Foreign Secretary should be performed on\
the following Monday. Lord Russell said that the recommencement\
of the War was the most probable event.\
The Gladstonian Bill for giving the Working Man a safe Assurance\
was passed, and very justifiable congratulations were exchanged upon\
the enactment of a law calculated to do so much good to the humbler\
classes. Mr. Punch hereby credits Mr. Gladstone with a large item\
of honour for his wisdom and courage in this matter, in fact begs him\
to receive the Assurance, &c.\
Having seen to the interests of good men, we next took the bad men\
in hand, and by a majority of 116 to 49 we read the Gaols Bill a Second\
Time. The Government was warmly supported by Sib John Paking-\
ton, a Conservative, who understands the subject. Mb. Whalley\
talked some anti-Catnolic nonsense, but the Brummagem Spooner was.\
of course, not heeded. The Criminal class will discover, when this Bill\
becomes law, that "doing that lot upon my head" will be a diflicult\
feat in gymnastics. _ _\
After so much smooth sailing came a storm. The Third Bill was like\
the third wave, in elassic reading. Mr. Gladstone's measure for\
vol. xlvii.\

\
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
[Jolt 2, 1864.\
improving the machinery of tax-collecting was adjudged by the\
House to be no improvement at all, and moreover, to oe a partial\
measure, London being excluded from its operation. So, although we\
had come to Third Reading, and although Mr. Gladstone made a\
gallant defence, we threw out the measure, defeating the Ministry by\
132 to 128.\
Then we'threw out, by 40 to 21, a little Bill for making all the Irish\
railways run Sunday trains. The Opposition was not Sabbatarian but\
liuancial, it being contended that certain companies could not afford to\
perform the additional journeys. The decision seems just, for it would\
be in the interest of an English traveller only that the extra trains could\
be wanted, as time and date are no object to the Hibernian mind, so an\
Irishman can just as well journey on Saturday, or Monday, or next\
week, and Scotchmen think it wicked to travel or whistle ou Sunday.\
Tuesday. The recent row at a Romish Reformatory in LincohisMrc.\
was discussed by the few Lords who think it worth while to attend\
debates (Punch will have something to say to Your Lordships about\
this contempt of the High Court ol Parliament one of these days, and\
he is collecting photographs of the absentee Peerage, not, in the first\
instance, for Mis. Punch's album,) and Lord Arundel of Wardour\
denied that the institution in question was entirely managed by monks,\
which Lord Derby was very glad to hear. It. seems, however, that\
it was necessary to hand it over, for a time, to the Order of the\
Flagellants.\
Navigators (we do not mean navvies, though the services of the latter\
might be useful in the case) will take notice' that we are* not going to\
blast Daunf s Rock, but only to put a bell-buoy on it. We hope that\
he will be attentive, and ring his bell like a good bell-boy whenever he\
sees a ship coming. We might have mentioned this last week, but it\
seems more in keeping with the careless way such matters are dealt\
with by the authorities, to note it on a day when nothing was said\
about it. Most English people think that Daunt's Rock is some cele-\
brated .kind of Dublin toffy, but nobody can know everything. Ma.\
Maguire deserves much applause for getting anything done to a\
dangerous nuisance, which the United Kmgdom ought to blow to\
Smithereens, wherever that locality may be.\
Another Irish complication, which we shall certainly not unravel.\
The Bill for improving Irish Chancery is disliked by Mr. Whiteside,\
who abused it tor two hours and a half, and then, by one vote, beat the\
Government,, and referred the Bill to a Select Committee. But then\
it turned out that the proceedings had been irregular, and also that\
somebody had voted against his intention, and\'97but what on earth does\
it matter?\
t Australia sadly wants a Rowland Hill. On the plea that the\
present rate of postage to that region does not pay, the Post Office has\
raised the charge from sixpence to one shilling, but it is to be fourpence\
by private ship. Mr. Punch, in the interest Doth of this countrv and\
the noble colony, denounces the proceeding as being unjust, and based\
on a false economy. Intercourse between us and the colonists should\
be encouraged to the utmost, and the requisite money should be taken\
out of the large profits made on home postage. If anybody in England,\
except Mr. Punch, knew anything about Australia, such an oppressive\
and ridiculous arrangement would not be permitted, but most people,\
and everybody at the Colonial Office, believe that Uobart Town is in\
New Holland, Melbourne in South Australia, Adelaide in New South\
Wales, and Australia somewhere in the Atlantic.\
Berkeley and 123 begged Ballot. Pah and 212 preferred Publicity.\
Mr. Hennessy lamented the increase of Irish Emigration, and\
wished something done to stop it. He was stopped, after being told\
there was nothing to lament about, by the carrying of the previous\
question by 80 to 52.\
Wednesday. Mr. Hubbard's Bill for permitting folks to use the\
Metric System went through Committee. It lies before Mr. Punch.\
It is a very little Bill, but there are some stunning long words in the\
Schedule. Omitting Dismals, ladies, we may inform you that a\
Myriametre is not the metre in which Miriam, the Hebrew songstress,\
composed, but 6 miles and 376 yards, that the word Are is not part of\
a verb, but 119 square yards; that when you send nurse to the public\
house for a pint of porter (such things are) you are lawfully at liberty\
to tell her to ask for a Dekalitre, and that when the witch in Macbeth\
was buying " three ounces of a red haired wench," the old wretch might,\
had this Bill then been Scotch law, have demanded a Hectogram.\
Then, apropos of Scotch law, we defeated a Bill for allowing English\
Bank notes to circulate in Scotland. It seems that the natives love\
that exceeding dirty old rag, called a Scotch note, and disloyally prefer\
it to a sovereign. We do not think that it would be right to interfere\
with a harmless provincial prejudice, but, considering that English\
tourists invented Scotland and support it, some arrangement might be\
made for the receipt, from such persons, of the corns and paper of\
civilisation.\
c A remark, in a similar spirit, will apply to a proposal to make the\
Royal Court of Jersey act justly and rationally. The Jerseyites are\
frantic at such an attempt, and m the extremity of their despair have\
promised to do the work themselves. It they do not, it will simply be\
necessary to enact that no English person who may visit the beautiful\
1 island, shall be liable to its ludicrous laws. Jersey would be a delightful\
place, but.for the Jerseyites.\
Thursday. Welcome to work, indefatigable old friend, Hexrt\
Brougham. A Bill for preventing bribery, eh? How? By maliiiij\
imprisonment the penalty. Very good. But do you think\'97do yoa\
now\'97t hat the attorneys will allow their subjects in the Commons to\
vote for such- a- measure? Never mind, we are rejoiced to see you k\
the field againt old Giantkiller.\
The Bishop or Oxford has a Bill allowing the masters of Collegiate\
Schools to read prayers to the- boys. The Primate supported it, Ik\
Tait approved it, and the thing is done at Harrow and the other great\
Schools. Rut the Bill frightened the Chancellor, and actually,\
Lord Shatthburt on "parochial" grounds. Dr. WrLBK&roBa\
"could not understand the pious zeal" of Lord Westbury. But, as\
Earl Rnnu didn't like the measure, it stands over for future dis-\
cussion. We regret to add that the Bisho* of Oxford fell from b\
horse in going home after endeavouring to promote so very rot,,\
an object, but we hope that ha- will soon recover. The Lords can u\
spare a crack debater.\
Ou the previous Sunday morning, the Federal frigate, the Kearur[f\
sank the Confederate frigate, the Alabama, near Cherbourg, when\
man covered- himself with honour -which no one will contest, the bran\

whether Government had noted the artillery lesson to be learned foe\
the fight off Cherbourg. It should be mentioned whenever there is tali\
of braver death than that met in the heat of battle.\
A long partisan debate on Irish Education again brought out bitter-\
ness from some who would rather see children untaught than taught b;<\
Catholics.\
Friday. The Lords talked for a short time about, the Royal Academy\
and this is a pleasant way of spending an hour. The Commons hi a\
Malt- tax .battle, in which Mr. Gladstone conquered, preventing\'bb\
resolution condemnatory of the tax, but the attendance was not large,\
considering the fuss that is made on the subject.\
We conclude the chronicle by stating that the Lord CHAifCELMS\
\
has revealed the mode in which he proposes to deal with Attorneys.\
The client is to\

LAWSON AND LIQUORS.\
\
\
bmirbd Punch, This world\
me no enjoyment much\
than that of a glass of strong\
imbibed in the course of a _\
long walk, at the bar of a decent\
well-conducted public-house. In an establishment of this description,\
the other day, on such an occasion, whilst I was recruiting my frame\
with that refreshment, a member of the working classes excited my\
curiosity by asking the landlord officiating at the tap for a goof "Law-\
son ;" whereupon mine host served him with a quantity of some kind\
of spirit. "Lawson!" I exclaimed; "dear me, what is Lawson P"'\
The working man grinned, and the landlord replied:\'97" Gin, Sir. They\
calls gin 'Lawson' now. Sir, 'cept o' Sundays, and then they calls\
it 'Somes.' Brandy they calls 'Trevelyan,' and rum 'Harvey,'\
and whiskey they calls 'Pope ;' Irish whiskey: and Scotch, 'Forbes\
Mackenzie.' Then there's different kinds o' beer. Sir- Burton\
they calls ' Band of Hope,' and Kcnnet 'United Kingdom Alliance.'"\
"Well to be sure!" said I, "and I shouldn't wonder if they were,\
by-and-by, to call sherry-cobler 'Harrington,' and mint-julep 'Hey-\
worth,' and brandy smash 'Jabez Burns,' and timber-doodle 'Canon\
Jenkins,' after the names of the Alliance's leading members." "Yes,\
Sir," said the landlord, "and werry likely they'll give the name of\
'Dean Close' to punch." "Indeed," I replied, "I think that ex-\
tremely probable; or perhaps they '11 make the Dean a Bishop; and it\
appears to me a subject of regret that the industrious orders should\
be provoked, by injudicious agitation, to associate, out of bravado,\
respectable and reverend names with liquors, which, however salubrious\
in moderate quantities, are, when partaken of in excess, intoxicating."\
"-'Tis werry lamentable, Sir," said the landlord, "isn't it?"\
Yours affectionately, Ambulator.\

Private Jones. "No, Sir!"\
Captain of Company. "But I say it is, Sir! Rioht about Face, and Look at it!'\
HONOUR TO THE Br&VE!\
Before us is a very sensible letter, signed "Bedford Pim, Com-\
mander R.N., Hon. Secretary," and dated from the Junior United\
Service Club. It announces, as information "which will doubtless\
gratify the admirers of the gallantry displayed by the officers and crew\
of the renowned Alabama in the late action off Cherbourg," the fact\
"that it has been determined to present Captain Semmes with a hand-\
some sword to replace that which he has buried with his sinking ship."\
Further, this judicious notification requests that "Gentlemen wishing\
to participate in this testimony to unflinching patriotism and naval\
daring will be good enough to communicate with the chairman of the\
committee, Admiral Anson, United Service Club, Pall-mall:" or with\
the writer himself. Lastly; a postscript preceded with "N.B." inti-\
mates that, "In order to give a larger number of friends the opportu-\
nity of contributing, the subscription is limited to one guinea each."\
This invocation will of course be sufficient to draw down upon the trea-\
surer of the committee above referred to a golden shower, considerably\
heavier than that which descended on Daniie.\
It is not for a moment to be supposed that the measure of presenting\
a sword to Captain Semmes, of the Alabama, is, on the part of officers\
in Her Majesty's Service, any the least violation of that neutrality in\
regard to the American belligerents which ha3 been enjoined by the\
Queen's Proclamation. In arming the Captain of the Alabama, no\
offence will be given like that which was taken at the supply of arms to\
the Alabama herself. If the Captain of the Kearsarge had been in\
Captain Semmes's place, that is to say, had he fought till his ship sank\
under him, after having eluded all the Confederate cruisers, and de-\
stroyed a great many Confederate merchant vessels, which may be\
supposed, no doubt those gentlemen who are going to give Semmes a\
sword for his mere gallantry, would be equally in a hurry to present one\
on the same account to Semmes's antagonist, Captain.Winslow.\
Should the Prussians and their King drag us into war with them, and\
a Prussian privateer, fitted out at New York and manned with Yankees,\
after having under the command of a German Captain swept a great\
Sart of our commerce from the seas, get sunk by a British sloop off\
'Oston, and should that Captain be picked up by the owner of an\
American yacht, and taken ashore, and hailed and made much of by\
officers of the United States Navy, and should they present him,\
amongst them, with a sword of honour, of course we shall, with that\
magnanimity which is ever characteristic of the British Public, only\
applaud their generous recognition of the valour and hardihood of our\
brave though mischievous and deadly enemy.\
In the prospect of imminent war with Prussia and Germany, no!\
only is & demonstration of sympathy with the commander of a Con-\
federate privateer highly seasonable, but, being made in the confident\
assurance that it will be liberally construed by those who would his\
Captain Semmes if they could catch him, it implies a delicate compli-\
ment to the people of the United States. We may assure ourselves\
that they will take it as such, and that those who intend to be parties\
to it had not much better mind their own business.\
A TRAP LAID FOR A HUSBAND.\
People sometimes wonder why it is that other people do not marry;\
and there is certainly small lack of ladies in the world, if gentlemen\
would only make up their minds to have them. Various are the wav>\
wherein a woman sets her cap at you; and here is one which, if there\
be any truth in an advertisement, seems well nigh irresistible :\'97\

A's:\
Curious Legal Custom.\'97Can any of your readers\
whether the following custom obtains in any other place than Little\
Tiddleywiuks. When a person owes money to another, and will not\
pay, the latter consults an attorney, who sends the former what is called\
A Lawyer's Letter." It is not an amiable practice, and I should be\
glad to hear that it is local only. Impecuniosus.\
Quaint Saying.\'97What is the origin of the phrase "Satupon,?' as\
applied to a discomfited person F I have sometimes thought that it\
may come from satti (enough), but I have chiefly heard it from1 turf\
men, military officers, and others seldom rightly suspected of classical\
proclivities. "Anti Slang.\
Wanted, a Quotation.\'97 I am a young author, and' having just\
completed a work, I want a good quotation for the title-page, and I\
dare say that some of the well-read contributors to " N. & Q." can aid\
me, ana I shall be much obliged' by any one doing so. My work, is on,\
the advantages of Industry, and I desire

making an allusion to the Bee, and its habit of improving time, and\
stocking its cells from any available floral source. Juvenis.\
"Customs in Society.\'97When the ladies retire' after dinner, why\
does the master of the house flick his table napkin after his wife, who\
leaves the room last F Is it a superstition? And why does he take\
her place at the .table, and say '"Now, then," as- if the enjoyment of\
the evening were really going to commence F And why does the gen-\
tleman who has hitherto been the most stupid and dismal, suddenly\
begin to grin, and proceed to rattle out jokes which certainly require\
the absence of ladies\'97and of gentlemen. As T am> preparing a work\
on etiquette, I shall be glad of any enlightenment on\
To Lady-Commentators.\'97 In the Circulating Library at Southend,\
Essex, is a copy of Sir Bulwer Lytton's beautiful, romance, Zanoni.\
There is a manuscript note in the margin of the page which describes\
the Apparition of the Dreadful Eyes and the Manifestation of the Unut-\
terable Horror, and the words, written by a graceful female pen, are\
"Truly hawful." As I think I recognise a kindred spirit in the anno-\
tation, I should be very glad if she would send her address to me, under\
cover to your office. -. Spirit-Rapper.\
A Classical Qctbry.\'97Do the best authorities at Oxford, (or\
Cambridge, if anything about Latin is known there) consider that\
Horace's phrase celeri saucius implies that the ancients were acquainted\
with celery sauce? Gryfpyd.\
Pedigree op the Smiths.\'97I am endeavouring to trace the pedigree\
of the Smiths of Tottenham Court Road. I have certificates as far back\
as John Smith, fruiterer, who lived in Holborn in 1815, but beyond this\
I cannot get. Can any of your correspondents aid me F We have a\
tradition that a Smith was knocked down in the Lord George Gordon\
riots, and an aged member of the family, resident in almshouses at\
Aldgate, thinks that either a Smith ("a smart young dandy") whom\
she knew in youth, or his friend Brown (" who went up in a balloon ")\
came home very tipsy after the fireworks in honour of the Allied\
Sovereigns, and these facts may serve as clues. I shall be glad of an\
early reply, for a visitor to the house lately remarked that she would\
not wonder if Mr. Smith got knighted one of these fine days, and it\
may be well to be prepared for Heralds' College.\
Samuel Traddles, (Solicitor).\
Animosity towards Spiders.\'97Can any of the correspondents of\
"N. & Q." inform me what is thought to be the origin of this'feeling F\
I haw recently married, and my bachelor study was rather profusely\
adorned with hangings produced by the industrious and indefatigable\
animal. To my surprise, during my absence one day, my wife and the\
housemaid cleared them all away, and in answer to my astonished\
inquiries,'! could get no explanation from the former, except that I was\
a pig. I suppose that there is some female superstition on the subject,\
and should be glad to be informed what, having no animosity myself\
towards a creature that sets authors so good an example of the poet's\
golden rule, Nulla dies sine lined. Dominie Sampson.\
Explanation op a Poem.\'97Dr. Watts is usually a model of good\
sense. But why does he, in his moral song about ants, make the fol-\
lowing complaint?\
"These emmets, how little they are In our eyes!"\
Would one not rather wish that they should not be in our eyes at all.\
than announce that they very seldom get there? Perhaps the learned\
Attorney-General, who edits our hymns so admirably, would explain\
the passage. It would not be beneath liis dignity, for I see with plea-\
sure that the learned Solicitor-General exhibits a picture in this year's\
Academy, and I am glad to see that great persons grow so affable.\
Meus Oculus.\
Polio Lobe.\'97Riding recently in the Rogent's Park, anl having\
some little difficulty with my horse, some juveniles, who were watching\
us with evident amusement, exclaimed, Get inside, Sir." I do not\
know whether they were advising me to take the horse within the\
enclosure, but I should think not, oecause the gates were locked, and I\
am induced to believe that the exclamataou'was^a specimen! of the quaint\
and time-honoured " chaff" of the humbler classes. Have any of your\
correspondents an idea of its meaning f Cockney.\
Nursery Rhymes.\'97The rising generation is grateful to 'you for\
allowing your correspondents to record the interesting evidences of\
domestio playfulness, and in the hope that the following may be new to\
many nurseries, 1 send it. I first heard it from' my old nurse who, I\
think, had in girl-hood been in some subordinate situation in the family\
of Lord Eldon. Hence; perhaps, the allusion'to the wig, though it is\
hardly probable that domestics would allow themselves to jest about\
the attire of tli\
s of their noble employer:\'97\

suppose that the elegant Hamlet would, use a term equivalent to the\

mentioned as among the players in the Globe cempaoy. ^Was he the\

he calls his father an old mole, his venerable friend a fishmonger, and the players\
gentlemen.\'97Ed. Punch's N. <fr Q.)\
Social Freemasonry.\'97At a dancing party the other night, I had\
no partner, so I went down alone to supper. I obtained a plate, and\
by some management got two wings of a fowl, three slices of tongue,\
and a help of lobster salad, with some good pieces, and roe. I was\
retiring to eat it in a corner, when a tall "swell, in a very affable\
manner, took the plate from me, saying, "Just wnat a lady wants."\
Then I saw him eating it himself. I am not much used to society. Is\
the phrase a sort of pass-word, to be accepted like a freemason's Sign.\
And if so, what is its origin F Simon Soft.\
Taking a Sight.\'97A more vulgar and offensive gesture than what\
is known as "taking a sight" can hardly be, and I am glad to say that\
it is used now only by the aristocracy in clubs and by the lowest cads\
at the doors of public-houses. Yet it had once a grave significance, and\
was practised by the highest persons, for Lord Bacon says, that my\
Ld Walsinghame, being stirred to erect unto himself a mansion, was\
asked by the Queen's Mai* how his house prospered. 'Alack, most\
dread Sovereign,' he said, 'I lack a spot to Duild it upon.' The\
Sueen, pointing through the casement to a fair^domam (none of her\
race's) did reply, finger to note,' My lord, take a site.'"\
A Dublin Architect.\
Pawnbrokers.\'971 am informed by a menial that the lower orders\
speak of a pawnbroker (a person who lends money on pledges) by the\
name of " My Uncle." The habits of the inferior creation have some\
interest for an observer of nature, and should the circumstances be\
known to any gentleman who reads "N. & Q.,"- he will perhaps favour\
me with an explanation. Is this a ludicrous effort on the. part of the\
canaille to get some fragment of a pedigree F\
De La Montmorency-Biggs.\
A Dodge Defeated.\'97In a beautiful and exciting novel .which is\
now the rage in Society, and which is called Emerald, or tie Pardonable\
Parricide, 1 find the following allusion. "Dashing his fair bride from\
him, he gazed on her in horror, as did Lycus the Centaur at the ser-\
pentine incarnation." Pray, who was Lycus the Centaur f\
[Ambulator.\

seal, the date of the engraving of which I cannot determine, but I shall\
be happy to show it to any one who will come into Cornwall, and call\
on me. It is mounted in brass, the engraved substance is' glass, and\
the device is a ship at sea, with the motto, (a corner chipped off and a\

THE CENTENARY INSURANCE COMPANY.\
We understand that with this title it is proposed to start a Company\
whose object will be to insure to all the persons who subscribe to it a\
commemorative festival upon their hundredth birthday, if they then be\
dead. It is generally acknowledged that everybody nowadays must\
have a Centenary, and people who have any fear that they may escape\
having one may, by insuring in this Company, relieve their minds at\
once from such a painful apprehension, and rest assured their hundredth\
birthday will, if they die before it, be borne publicly in mind.\
The chief object, however, of the Company will be to provide work\
for the people who like getting up Centenaries, and by celebrating\
others try to celebrate themselves. As the daisy may feel proud that, if\
not the rose itself, it has lived near to the rose, and become in some\
degree ennobled by the neighbourhood, so small promoters of Cente-\
naries may derive reflected greatness from the greater men they glorify.\
Poets, whose poetic feet are very much too weak to climb Parnassus\
without help, try to raise themselves by clinging to some stronger\
climber's skirts. The being named in the same breath with greater\
men of letters, may be thought by some to magnify a name of little\
note; and so when a Centenary is purposed to be kept, there is never\
any lack of men to act on the Committee, and have their names paraded\
publicly in print.\
Another hardly less important object of the Company is to keep up\
the supply of birthdays to be celebrated, which, it is feared, might\
otherwise ere long become exhausted. It is not every day that one can\
catch a Shakspeare or a Burns to be centenarified, and, for want of\
some one better, one will soon have to fall back upon a Tomkins or a\
Smith. Whether the prospect of being held in popular remembrance\
upon one's hundredth birthday would act as an incentive to the writing\
ot good poetry, or the doing of good deeds, is a question which this\
Company perhaps may help to answer; and if the answer be affirmative,\
we may well wish that the Company may meet with all success.\
Impertinent.\'97Amongst our miscellaneous reading, we fell over a\

DREADFUL MORAL DUNCES.\

Bewicke, who suffered penal servitude on conviction through perjury,\
state, in their report denying his claim to redress for that infliction,\
that:\'97\
"They aro unablo to accede to the proposition that persons who have been con-\
victed in due course of law by evidence subsequently proved to be false are enuuw\
to compensation out of the public purse." j\
Are these gentlemen able to accede to the proposition that anybody\
whosoever, who has suffered any conceivable outrage, is entitled to any\
compensation at all P If a person injured by the mistake of a Judge\
and jury is not entitled to compensation out of the public purse, how\
can anybody accidentally injured by the agents of an individual be\
entitled to any compensation out of a private purse? What difference,\
as to claim for compensation, is there between being crushed by tie\
error of a court of law, and being driven over by a blundering coachman?\
The legislators who are "unable to accede to the proposition," self-\
evident to anybody endowed with any conscientiousness, " that persons\
who have been convicted in due course of law by evidence subsequently\
proved to be false are entitled to compensation out of the public purse,\
would probably have that inability removed by an unmerited subjection\
for a very limited period to the discipline of a felon's gaol, which, for\
the stimulation of their stupid moral sense, might advantageously\
include several whippings.\

SUGGESTIVE ADVERTISEMENT-FAMILIES SUPPLIED IN CASKS AND BOTTLES.\
VISIT OF PRINCE PUNCH TO THE ART-SCHOLARS'\
BAZAAR\
"O My dear Prince Punch, you must; indeed you must," said\
the Princess, adding with her sweetest smile, "you know we couldn't\
possibly get through it all without you."\
So Prince Punch, who is all ears when a pretty lady speaks, graced\
the Arcades of South Kensington with his countenance last Thursday,\
and opened the bazaar for the Female School of Art.\
"Are these the lady scholars? they look very attractive, don't they?"\
whispered Alexandra, as she glanced at the nice girls in white dresses\
and red ribbons, the colours of her country. "Attractive," said Prince\
Punch, "Why, yes, as art-students of course, their study\'97he! he!\'97\
is to draw. But see, this is the Ceremonial Hall that we have reached,\
and here are all the cere-monies ready to be handed to your Royal\
Highness." While yet he spake, the purse-bearers silently approached,\
and handed to the Princess the five guineas they had paid for the\
privilege of doing so. "Speech is silver," said Prince Punch, "but\
you see. Silence is golden. I had rather have five guineas from the\
hands of a young lady who knows when to hold her tongue, than five\
columns of gabble from an orator who doesn't."\
Then the Princess and her suite\'97her suite being sweet Prince\
Punch\'97were taken into custody by six terrible policemen, and marched\
away like malefactors through a squeeze of starers into the bazaar.\
Here she set a good example to bazaar-goers in general, for she stopped\
at every stall to say a pleasant word or two, and make a pretty pur-\
chase; whereas, bazaar-goers in general do chatter, but don't buy.\
The stall-keepers were so pretty that Prince Punch soon found his\
hands full and his purse quite empty; and, but for the presence of the\
half-dozen policemen, his heart would have been stolen a dozen times\
at least before he left the too, too fascinating place.\
"You '11 come and have some lunch and a weed, before your Park,\
won't you?" said Albert Edward, temptingly. But the other Prince\
was adamant, even to this offer, for he had rashly made a vow not to\
smoke before his dinner; and so, after he had handed Alexandra to\
her carriage, he took Toby to the Dog Show to exchange a few bow-\
wows with the Dog-fish of the Andes, the Colossal Cur of Corsica\
and some other foreign friends. Then, having improved his mind with\
a whole five minutes' course of scientific lectures, at the famous Panly-\
Toole-y-Technic Institution, he sought some bodily improvement at the\
place where the refreshments should have been served out. But after\
waiting six and thirty minutes for an ice, and at length succeeding only\
in grabbing an ice spoon, Prince Punch was led to think that he\
would be a nice spoon to wait there any longer, and so he, wisely\
postponed luncheon till it was time to dine.\
THE AMERICAN QUESTION.\
According to an American paper called the Albany Evening Jomd,\
the practice of extorting confession by torture has been revived in what\
still "claims" to be the Model Republic. For: \'97\
"Johnson the deserter, who attempted to hide his uniform last week i\'bb an \'ab"*\
house on the hill, and then rigged himself up in cittaen's clothes, has been mads j\'bb\
own up at the barracks. After the thumbscrews had been applied, he said that t\'bb\
name was Jamks Hunt, and gave the name and numbor of the regiment to which\
ho belonged and where he enlisted."\
The Yankees appear now to be going a-head, as perhaps their Irish\
immigrants tell them, by reversing the engine. One engine to which\
they seem in a fair way to revert, is the rack, and by application to its\
mechanism of the beneficent power of steam, they will doubtless render\
it a great improvement on the antiquated apparatus for applying the\
question extraordinary." The Federal Steam-Rack may be expected\
to figure in any considerable contribution which Yankeedoodledom .may\
make to any future International Exhibition. The ingenuity of the\
countrymen of General Butler will enable them to adapt steam, as a\
motive force, to all varieties of the more complicated machinery \'ab\
torture. As yet they content themselves with one of its simplest\
instruments. But now that they employ the thumbscrews, to make\
prisoners "own up," they will next, perhaps, adopt the "Scavengers\
Daughter."\

AN APPEAL TO ENGLAND.\
Englishmen, Countrymen, Friends !\'97remain no longer\
insensible to the taunts which are so earnestly addressed\
to you by foreigners, and are so thoughtfully taken up and\
repeated by candid and well-intentioned and beneficial\
persons amongst ourselves. Do recognise the truth that\
you are laughed at by your well-wishers, and let them lash\
you into that noble rage with which their ridicule ought\
long since to have inflamed you.\
Draw the sword instantly; never mind if you can only\
flourish it in the air. Level the bayonet, notwithstanding\
that you see nothing within your reach to charge. Fire,\
though there be no enemy within range of your rifled\
ordnance, and your shot fall harmless, and your shells\
explode ineffectually in the atmosphere.\
What a set of cowards you will deserve to he called if you\
hesitate to pit ten thousand men against only half a million!\
What a nation of mean, stingy, sordid shopkeepers you\
will justly be styled if you sit down for a moment to count\
the cost of a war that may not come to much more than\
two or three hundred, and will perhaps let you in for less\
than a thousand millions sterling!\
Will you be basely unmindful of the gratitude with which\
you have uniformly been repaid by other nations for the\
slight assistance which, when their liberties have been\
assailed and their soil invaded, you have occasionally ren-\
dered them at an insignificant expense both of life and\
money?\
Show yourselves, for once, at the invitation of the whole\
world, which is solicitous for your welfare no less (him\
your honour, capable of going to war for an Idea other than\
that of getting anything By doing so; indeed just the reverse\
of it.\
Do not grudge the industrious Yaukees any number of\
merchantships which their privateers will capture sailiug\
under your enemy's flag. Follow the example of disinte-\
rested, self-sacrificing, enthusiastic generosity which is set\
you by almost all the other nations around you.\

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.\
June 27lh. Monday. It is difficult to say what took people in such\
crowds to make themselves uncomfortable, for hours, in both Houses of\
Parliament to-day, inasmuch as all the newspapers had told us, at break-\
last, that the Government of the Queen would not go to war with\
Germany. But there were great crowds; and the Pbejce of Wale3,\
with his and our endeared Princess, went to the Hous3 of Lords to\
i hear Earl Russell.\
i Were not Mr. Punch writing for Posterity, he would add nothing to\
'the above paragraph. But ages after all the newspapers of Tuesdav,\
I the 28th of June, 1864, shall nave become scattered and undistinguish-\
able dust, his adamantine tablets will be consulted for the history of\
I England. He therefore respectfully apprises the Ages that on this\
afternoon Viscount Palmerston, Premier of England, atatis\'97never\
i mind, but he was bom in 1784\'97and Earl Russell, Foreign Secretary, 1\
i horn 1792, delivered two of the most remarkable speeches made by\
them in the whole course of their prolonged Parliamentary history.\
They gave narratives of the progress of the Dano-German quarrel,\
| stated the effect of the Treaty of London of 1852 (that famous Pro-\
missory Note to which France, Russia, and England were parties, but\
1 which the two former signatories hint that England alone ought to pay,\
only England doesn't seem to see it in that light), referred to the Fede-\
ral Execution, and then to the German Burglarious Entry, and to the\
war in which Denmark made such gallant resistance to the hordes of\
invaders. Though both Lords were friends of the late Tom Moore,\
they missed a fine opportunity of quoting one of his finest passages:\'97 ]\
"But vain was valour, vain the flower\
Of Denmark in that dreadful hour\
Against the German's whelming power.\
In vain they met him, helm to helm,\
Upon the threshold of the realm\
He came in brutal force to sway.\
And with their corpses blocked his way."\
But then Lords have not Mr. Punch's fine memory and prompt habit\
of adaptation. But they proceeded to say that the parties who signed\
the Treaty of 1852 suggested a Conference; that England had tried, in\
vain, to obtain a previous armistice, but that suspension of hostilities\
was arranged by the Council which met in London. Then we were told\
of the discussions, which it is of the less consequence to describe, seeing\
that they ended in nothing but the exchange of polite bows, and the\
assurances of the foreigners that they had enjoyed a delightful visit to\
the Isle of Fogs. Denmark conceded all Holstein and nearly half Schles-\
wig at the suggestion of England, but refused to retreat behind a certain\
line, while the Burglars declared that they would have more. Then the\
King of Denmark said that he would resume the fight for the rest of\
his possessions. The armistice, prolonged to six weeks, expired, and\
the slaughter has been resumed.\
We all knew all this. Then came the question, was England to go\
to war for Denmark?\
Lord Palmerston said that Denmark had been ill used, and that the\
sympathies of the whole English nation were with her.\
But in the very origin of the quarrel she had been wrong, though she\
had completely set herself right.\
She rejected the last demand at the Conference, though her accept-\
ance of it might have led to peace.\
France and Russia had refused to draw the sword for her.\
Therefore, if England interfered, she would have to encounter the\
whole force of Germany.\
The Government of the Queen had not thought it their duty to go\
to war.\
Bat if Copenhagen were attacked, or the King of Denmark were\
made a prisoner, their decision might be subject to reconsideration.\
Such was the Premier's statement, and Earl Russell's was like\
unto it, but he added that we were the more bound to remain neutral\
now, as the War in America might end, and then we might have, at\
any time, a rupture with a nation possessing an enormous army and a\
powerful navy.\
To the which speeches provisional replies were made by the leaders of\
Opposition.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
Lord Derby wished the Lords to abstain from any immediate\
expression of opinion. It would shortly be for Parliament to decide 1\
whether Ministers had preserved the honour of England, and whether\
the Continental difficulty was not the result of their weak and vacil-\
lating policy.\
Mr. Disraeli had, at the beginning of the Session, condemned the\
course of Government. Had the Papers been duly produced, the\
House might have given earlier advice and judgment. He should\
speedily take the opinion of the Commons on the conduct of Ministers.\
He described Lord Palmerston's last words as another of his spirit-\
less and senseless menaces, and thought the policy of Messrs. Cobden\
and Bright better and more intelligible than that of the Ministry.\
On the next day,\
Tuesday, Mr. Disraeli, amid loud Conservative cheers, gave notice\
that on the following Monday he should move a Vote of Censure.\
Mr. Kinglake (Eothen) subsequently pave notice of au Amend-\
ment to the effect that the House approves the conduct of Government\
in abstaining from war. 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 *>*-'\
And now Posterity knows all about it, and is prepared to study the\
next instalment of t he history of the battle. ] t will be found adequately\
described in Mr. Punch's next number, and the historian has taken off\
his coat, and is preparing himself by a perusal of Natibk, Thiers,\
Carlyle, and the Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World.\
A little fight took place on this Tuesday, when the Ministers were\
beaten, by 79 to H), on Mr. Doulton's motion, that Government ought\
to provide for the keeping open spaces in and around London. The\
mouths of Mr. Peel and Mr. Cowper presented very open spaces at\
a proposition so counter to red-tape ideas, but there is a good deal to\
be said for it. A Select Committee is to consider the subject.\
Lord Brougham thinks that as Brazil has dropped the Slave Trade,\
we may repeal the very severe Aberdeen Act which has made her do so.\
Lord Russell thinks, with Mr. Punch, that we had better wait a little,\
especially as Brazil and England are not just, now on speaking terms.\
To-night the Prince ana Princess of Wales and Mr. Punch we*t\
to the Adelphi to see the Dead Heart, and all three agreed that Mr.\
.Webster's subtle, elaborated, and vigorous acting was an artistic treat,\
doubly acceptable now that good acting is growing scarcer and searcer.\
If any reader does not see what this fact has to do with Parliament, his\
intellect must be so feeble that it is not worth while to explain the\
connection.\
Wednesday. Mr. Hennessy had an agreeable opportunity of ascer-\
taining the value which the House of Commons sets upon Lis wisdom\
as a legislator. He moved the Second Reading of some Bill for\
tampering with the Irish Poor Law, and the House threw it out by\
201 to 24.\
The Bill, on which there has been so much debate, for abolishing the\
Tests that keep certain Dissenters out of Oxford University, went into\
Committee, and great contention was expected. But Mr. Selwyn and\
the Conservatives would not touch the measure, and simply announced\
that they meant to throw it out on the Third Reading as they did.\
Then we went into Committee on Mr. Bass's Bill for relieving from\
the nuisance of Street Organs those who deem them a nuisance. The\
sensible men had all the argument and all the majorities, but a good\
deal of flippaut folly was emitted in the public-house, servant-maid, and\
street idler's interest. Allusion being made to the street Punch, whose\
form the Great Punch playfully borrowed, and has idealised into a thing\
of beauty and a joy for ever, Sir John Pakington paid us a handsome\
but perfectly just, compliment, describing Us both as Institutions of\
the Country. We were still more pleased to find that this experienced\
and practical nobleman, who, as Chairman of Quarter Sessions, knows\
the nature of vagabonds and their patrons, supported Mr. Bass. So\
did Sir George Grey, who said that the Bill was merely an alteration\
of the existing law which enabled a householder to object to street\
music if i!, interfered with his calling. Perhaps the Home Secretary's\
statement will outweigh all the ridiculous misrepresentations of such\
people as Sir John Shelley and Mr. Ayrton, who also made some\
miserable jokes, better suited to their Westminster and Tower Hamlet\
mobs than to the House of Commons. By a majority of 201 to 87\
the Committee approved the principal feature of the Bill, and its\
friends triumphed on other divisions, refusing by 17a to 51 to postpone\
the discussion, which was ^continued until the time for rising on\
Wednesdays.\
Thursday. Posterity, may we trouble you again for a moment P You\
will hardly believe that up to this day civilised London had borne to\
have its carriages and horsemen arrested and robbed by highwaymen,\
called turnpike keepers; but it was only to-day that Lord Ravens-\
worth, rising in the Lords, reminded t he Peers, with jubilation, that\
Metropolitan Tolls ended that night. Even now, the south bank of the\
Thames is exposed to the same nuisance, but will hardly bear it long,\
as Mr. Bradfield, the exterminator of the North Bank pikemen, is\
again at work.\
Lord Carlisle, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, was accused by Lord\
Donotjghmore of having been too ready to pardon certain criminals.\
Lord Carlisle is a good-natured man, but in the cases\
Lord Chelmsford, his political opponent, testified that the pardons\
were justifiable. Lord Leitrim called Lord Carlisle a traitor and\
other hard names, and got a witheringly contemptuous answer from\
Lord Granville.\
It is pleasing to see that amid these disputes the Commons arc\
gentlemen who remember what is due to the ladies. Sir George\
Bowyer wished the grating between them and the House done away\
with, but Mr. Cowper feared that if this were done they would\
exercise an undesirable influence over the House. What he meant\
Punch cannot tell. If their presence would encourage Members to\
speak their best, and to behave gracefully, we should like to see them\
around the Speaker's tabic, on which flowers might be placed. Mr.\
Heygate, member for Leicester, did still more valuable service to the\
ladies, by demanding improvement in the ventilation of their gallery,\
for which polite attention they will owe him theirs when he next speaks,\
and as he speaks well, the duty will be a pleasure.\
Education of Naval Architects, and Education generally helped on\
the evening. Then on the vote of\'97pooh, a trifle, \'a397,1S2 for the\
department of Science and Art, we had some fan. Mr. Gregory\
abused the Kensington- Museum, Sir G. Bowybr said it contained a\
sedan stolen from the Duki of Tuscany, and Mr. Ayrton said some-\
thing which we prefer to give in bis own words as reported;\'97\
"Literary productions had lately been patronised at Kensington, and the last of\
them he hud Been. It was called Mvmfto Jumbo: or the Mountttiiu of ttu Moon on\
Ut* Qaboon, which aeemed to be the moat remarkable compouadt of nonsense that he\
had erer seen. Indeed, it was the sbeenet ilrmsense that coadd be conceived, without\
wit or humour or any other redeemlng-quality. Ho bad met with a very respectable\

(laughur.) The gentleman's (being was that aa he had a wife and\
no choice, and therefore must make a fool of himself."\
family he had\
Later, in a debate on the Greek Loan, Mr.Lttjox made a speech.\
Now tlus gentleman has more than once been smart on Mr. Gladston e,\
who is a dangerous person to b\'a9 smart upon. To-night, in reply, the\
Chancellor told Mr. Lyoon that his mind seemed to have got into\
that state of confusion in which it generally was at that time of night.\
Let this mean what it might, it could scarcely he described as civility\
in txcelsis.\
Friday. Lord Grey objects to the way we ate going on in Ta*paa.\
So does the Bishop of Oxfowb, whom Bishop Punch was happy to\
see in the House again. Lord Russell said that all was correct,\
errors excepted.\
In the Commons there was a great scene. The Conservatives thought\
that the Oxford Tests Bill could not come on for Third Reading until\
late, as there was Supply, and an Irish Bill promising great strife, so\
they ordered their men to be down at 12. But business slipped through\
as if it had been greased, and when the Oxford Bill came on, the Liberals\
were terribly strong, and the others not. But the Conservatives talked\
against time, the Liberals not putting up a speaker, and even howling\
down Mr. Neate, their own man, and at last on division, the numbers\
were equal, 170 each way. An awful row. The Speaker gave a casting\
vote for the Bill, and then came the death-question, "That this Bill do\
pass?" But three more men had arrived, and two were Conservatives,\
so the Tests were retained by 173 to 171. Tne House Was perfectly\
frantic, and the shouts of the victors might have been heard at Oxford\
itself.\
The week was brought to a more creditable ending. The Anti Organ\
Fiend Bill passed through Committee, with an Amendment to the\
effect that when we give a fiend in charge we oan go wdtk him to the\
station-house. Nothing could give us more pleasure.\
NATIONAL DEFENSIVE ECONOMY.\
The taxpayers of England owe much to Captain Palliser, of the\
18th Hussars, for his invention of chilled shot, iron shot more than\
equal to steel, made by being cast in a mould of cold iron. Captain\
Palliser's chilled shot cost, only \'a3\'bb. a-piece, whereas steel shot come\
to at. least \'a31 10*\\ The chilled "shot invented by Captain Palliser,\
after having penetrated the side of an iron-elad, 'fly into pieces, which\
answer all the purpose of a bursting shell. Now, 30.f. is a great price\
to pay for a shot, over and above the powder, and when that snm is\
fired at the enemies of England there ought to be plenty of them to\
show for it. It is as much as a whole host of them is worth; and the\
man who has given us a shot that will kill as many or more for 2*.,\
deserves well of his country.\
British Influence Abroad.\
The King of Dahomey continues to celebrate his Grand Customs,\
which consist in the sacrifice of human victims, and yet England declines\
to engage in war for the sake of putting a stop to those atrocities. All\
the Continental journals agree hi the declaration that we arc fast losing\
our influence in Africa.\

parts of speech arc employed as terms either of vituperation or that\
species of banter which amongst the viler portion of ourselves, and their\
aristocratic imitators, is called chaff."\
Now, if a man is either, as they say, "chaffed," or "slanged," lie is\
apt to look like a fool uulrss he pays back his adversary in his own coin.\
I wish to suggest something better than this. Suppose he pays his\
adversary off iu higher coin. A very few perfectly unobjectionable\
phrases will enable Lim to effect that repayment in the superior currency\
with interest. There arc some two or three, which, with the aid of a\
little self-possession, will always supply a retort more than equal to the\
occasion.\
I would say, then, to my fellow working man, "when anybody calls\
you a dreadful substantive, or applies a horrid adjective to you, how\
much better than a recourse to the usual Tu quoque it would be to\
answer "For Shame!" or "Oh, fie!" Or, instead of returning a\
coarse, invitation by another still coarser, to say, "Excuse me," or\
"No, 1 thank you," or " Don't be rude." You thus either shut your\
opponent up, and put him down, or you exasperate him, and he gets\
into a rage, and loses his head, and exposes himself to derision. When\
your companion states what is not true, you may just as well say, "Oh,\
what a story!" as "You 're a liar," qualifying the offensive noun\
with an odious epithet. And then, as to suiting the word to the action.\
Instead of using the contemptuous gesture that commonly accompanies\
a rough repartee: instead of applying the thumb to the end of the nose\
and extending the lingers, illustrate your deprecatory ejaculation or\
remonstrance merely with an uplifted forefinger, and a gentle nod.\
This gesture will highly enhance, the effect of such a mild reproof as\
"Naughty!" addressed to a brutal and stupid man, and will give a\
stinging poignancy to the simple exclamation "Oh!"\
If, Sir, some of the more influential individuals of our class would\
make a poiut of practising the advice which I thus proffer, they\
soou bring strong language into ridicule, and render its use a*\
qucnt among working men as it is amongst the wealthier classes. This\
little reform of their conversation would, I am sure, do much to remove\
a prejudice not altogether groundless, which causes some fastidious\

[July 9, 1864.\
\
I THE EAST CHALKSHIRE ARTILLERY VOLUNTEERS AT GUN PRACTICE.\
No. 3 (Menacingly to his Officer, who is finding fault with the aim). "Ye munna tooch t" Gun, Mon; A 'ye qot a Bet on't!!"\
WHO ARE THE SNEAKS?\
Me. Punch,\
Who, after all, are they who have deserved and betrayed\
Denmark, invaded and ravaged by Teutonic scouudrcldom under the\
"hegemony" of PrussiaP "Her Majesty's Government," shouts\
Her Majesty's Opposition. "Perfidious Albion!" howl malignant\
foreigners. "We certainly have lowered ourselves in the eyes of\
Europe," cackle and hiss, with gregarious imbecility, English geese. I\
beg the goose's pardon; 'tis a silly oird, but defiles not its own nest.\
Certainly, Sir, it is undeniable that Her Majesty's Government,\
having in vain attempted to restore peace by moral suasion, declines to\
attempt that object by physical force, which England would have to\
put forth by herself, pitching into Teutonic scoundreldom unaided by\
any other ot the neutral powers, pitching, alone amongst them all, into\
a scoundreldom of seventy millions. France will not help. Russia will\
not help. Not to fight for Denmark against overwhelming odds may\
be very pusillanimous; but is the pusillanimity of the British Cabinet\
greater than that of the French and Russian Imperial Governments,\
and is Albion more perfidious than Russia and France? England has\
offered to fight if i liey would. They won't. If Lord Palmerston is\
a sneak and a humbug, is not Louis Napoleon something worse than\
another?\
"Oh! but Lord Palmerston some time ago gave breath to the\
menace that if Prussia and Austria did to Denmark that which they\
have done, 'Denmark would not stand alone.'" Well, what then? I\
suppose he said what he thought and expected. He gave France and\
Russia credit for 1 he same honest intention to enforce right as that of\
England. France and Russia have failed him. Really, Mr. Punch, if\
there is any perfidy or poltroonery in this matter, I can see none that\
is chargeable on Albion especially, or that lies in particular at the door\
of Cambridge House. Greenness, not perfidy, seems to me to have\
been the fault of Ministers. They were so verdant as to believe that\
France and Russia would unite with England in going to war for an\
idea simply moral.\
The patriot Disraeli asks the House of Commons to declare that\
the course pursued by Her Majesty's Government in regard to the\
Danish question, "has lowered the just influence of this country in the\
councils of Europe." Why didn't he likewise invite it to affirm that\
the line taken in the same business by the councils of Europe has\
lowered the just influence which they ought to have in each other?\
How many words have been wasted on Dizzy's motion, when it would\
have received an amply sufficient answer in one of two syllables,\
"Humbug!" This would have been the sole reply vouchsafed to it by\
an assembly less studious of eloquence than brevity, consulting which,\
I rest, calling myself your\

SOFT WORDS AND POLITICAL PARSNIPS.\
"The Neighbour softens, but the Satirist is rosolved."\'97The Critic.\
Punch is placable, even to extremes. And if anything could melt\
him into forgetfulness of his duty to society, it would be the appear-\
ance of this paragraph in the Standard:\'97\
11 Our facetious contemporary and neighbour in Fleet Street has his occasional\
poke at us, and we endeavour to rcturu it, though at the odds at which a grave\
journal encounters an accomplished wit But we bolievo our old friend Punch *\
heart to be in tho right place, and, Conservatives at we are, we heartily applaud tb'j\
true English feeling which ho manifests on all occasions when the nation's heart U\
stirred. Nothing can be fairer than tho way in which the Liberal satirist has\
treated tho Danish question or tho conduct of the Opposition, and his mordant\
cartoons oxpress, if not very gently, certainly with complete truth, tho feelings\
of the country, lie shall now see that tho Conservatives are. as he says, going to\
do 4 summut,' and, to borrow his own stylo, we may add that he will soon seo\
Conservative statesmen at the 'summit' of popularity."\
We are not in the habit of making quite such startling epigrams as\
that with which the above paragraph concludes, but we may say that we\
naturally and cordially agree in the sentiment which it contains. Never-\
theless, Punch must be permitted to believe that Lord Derby will not\
be Prime Minister next week, and " we may add" that we shall feel it\
our duty to keep him out of office for the present, the Standard's\
blandishments notwithstanding.\

1.\'97BEFORE BASS.\
RlBHI thou thus, dim morn, again,\
Upon the dull and dreary street,\
Where, 'ere in Farringford's retreat\
I sought oblivion of my pain,\
CADGING EXTRAORDINARY-A FACT.\
Enter Art-Critic\
Art-Critic. "Haw! I write the Art Critiques for several of the most influential\
Journals and Magazines. Have you any Pictures you could show me that you\
would like noticed? I've observed, my dear fellow, you've not been done justice\
lo by the Press. Ah! that is a most charming thing you have on the easel there.\
That head is delickmaly\'97[$e., fye, usque ad nauseam]. Hem! 1 've been writing\
a Work on Metaphysics and the Heathen Mythology. Let me have the pleasure of\
adding your Name to my List of Subscribers. Cost very trifling, and I '11 write you\
a stunning Notice in the Flunkey's Chronicle. I know you Artis's like a pull!\
| The Listener's blood curdles.] 'One good turn deserves another, you know.' Twig?\
I It'tut*.] Them as use me well, I use them well."\
[Hating heard enough, our Artist, with a withering smile, shows this learned\
Author I lie door.\
A TRIPLE TOO SMART.\
The Smart Snob's Organ is grinding frantically for the benefit of the other\
organs for whose utterances pennies are also pitched into the street by people who\
like coarse amusement. While we recognise the sacred sympathies of such brother-\
hood, we must protest against downright falsehood. The tops of tho Busses" like\
a grin as preparation for the day's work, and we allow that the Smart Snob supplies\
grin, and occasional gush, in a very honest manner. And one would not be hard\
upon claptrap necessary in the way of trade in these days of pushing and bawling.\
But as it is simply false, and not at all funny, to say that Ma. Bass's Bill for the\
protection of the sick and the dying, (to say nothing of classes with whom Snobs\
have little in common) from the cruelties of the organ-fiends, is a measure for\
depriving the poor of music, we may hint that such writing tends to excite a con-\
tempt which we are far from feeling, as a general rule, for any one who strives to\
please the harmless tastes of his customers. The Bill is calculated to give the poor\
ten times as much music as they get at present, for it is meant to drive the organs\
from quarters where they are not wanted. The organ-owners now derive their\
chief income from hush-money, we wish them to receive it as payment for welcome\
service. If the profits of the miscreants who import the unhappy Italians, treat\
them brutally, and mainly live upon the black-mail they extort, be lessened by a\
police measure, we do not see in this prospect any case for the lamentations of a re-\
spectable journalist. As to sneers at the alleged feelings of the late Mr. Thackeray,\
or at those of Mr. Carlyle, Mr. Charles Dickens, Mr. Babbage, End the\
musical artists of London, such things are matters of taste, and the tops of the\
Busses are not, perhaps, very appreciative of true art or science. But tell the\
truth, even to smart Snobs.\
1 groaned and fretted painful years,\
Stretched on the barrelorj\
Though sleeping in a tirst-\

The kilted bag-piper's strathspey,\
Made misery keener than before.\

Came ophicleide, bassoon, French I\
In linked discord clanged about.\
Morn passed\'97dull day to dark declined:\
(ias, London's better sun, gave light:\
Those sounds still hideous made the night;\
Till life seemed one perpetual grind.\

For staying here I can but die,\

With tuneless tunes my music marred!\

Where no street-music is allowed;\
Where to the ass-ears of the crowd,\

I left fair Farringford's retreat:\
I said, I will rescek the town j\
Though green in Park and Sqi\
And dust and clamour choke the street.\
\
Again as in the years gone by,\
I sleep wit hin my first-floor-back;\
Nor cotton for my ears 1 lack,\
Though all unused 'lis left to lie.\
The sun still wears his cap of cloud,\
As did the sun 1 used to know;\
I hear the cry of " milk below,"\
And " water-creases" clamouring loud.\
The sea of wheels still roars and rolls;\
The pavement still is vexed of feet;\
Yet a strange peace broods o'er the street,\
And all unchafed we poet-souls\
May shoot our swallow-flights of song,\
Nor struggle with the organ's blare:\
And nigger-melodists forbear,\
And German bands, resolved in wrong.\
Like a caged thrush, that yet doth fill\
The hours with music as they pass,\
1 sing my gratitude to Bass,\
And them that voted for his Bill!\
III.\'97SELF-QUESTION.\
And have I done sweet music wrong,\
That deem the organ-man accurst,\
And for their praise in song have burst\
Who drained his barrel of its song?\

PUNCH OR THE LONDON CTTAPJVART.\
A poet I, an organ he;\
Is this our quarrel and no more?\
I drive a rival from the door;\
Two of a trade can ne'er agree.,\
Or am I hard, as Atrtox holds,\
Denying prisoned area-belles\
The only joy that gloom dispels\
Of days sore vexed with toils and scolds f\
Ah !\'97no: 'tis that I love too well\
The music that those organs slay;\
'Tis that my glance too oft will stray,\
Pleased with some blooming area-belle,\
Unwilling that her eyes should err,\
From the policeman drawn aside,\
Or Grenadier, his country's pride,\
To that black whiskered foreigner\
Who grins and grinds, and grinds and\
And in the area's smile elate\
Defies the first-floor's rage and hate,\
And, if I seize him, kicks my shins!\
TWELVE THOUGHTS\
FOR THOSE TEMPTED TO TRAVEL.\
iters Railway people,\
with an artfulness\
which cannot be too\
much condemned,\
are now exciting\
families, especially\
the ladies, with ideas\
of travelling during\
the recess. Tempt-\
ing little pamphlets,\
describing routes,\
and offering Return\
Tickets, the price\
put in shillings to\
look smaller, are\
being sent into\
houses, with disturb-\
ing results. To coun-\
teract this agency,\
Mr. Punch begs to\
submit to the heads\
of families a few\
considerations which\
Paterfamilias will do\
well to urge upon\
those who wish him\
to yield to Railway\
blandishment.\
Why it is so much, better to Stop in Town.\
You can see after the cleaning of your house, dusting your books,\
and so on, and you will have such nice leisure for doing those large\
windows with the clever imitation of coloured glass.\
You can walk so comfortably in the Parks and Kensington Gardens,\
and have your choice of chairs, as there will be no disagreeable crowd,\
and no dust from carriages.\
You can have orders, or even boxes, for any theatres that may be\
open, as the managers will be only too glad to see you.\
You can study geography, and improve yourself so much, by engaging\
all your travelling friends to write to you to tell you what they are\
seeing, and you can follow them\'97on the map.\
You can promenade Regent Street so agreeably, and if there is not\
much in the shop windows at that season, so much the better, as you\
will not be tempted to purchase what you don't want.\
You will feel so much more comfortable, watching over your own\
premises, instead of leaving them to servants who will nave in followers,\
and perhaps set the house on fire.\
You can have your children home from school for the Michaelmas\
holidays, and even an extra week, during which you can examine them\
carefully as to their progress, and take them to the British Museum,\
and that of Practical Geology, also to the Thames Tunnel.\
You can walk with your male relatives into parts of London which\
you have never seen, as Whitechapel, Ratcliffe Highway, and Bow, and\
you will gain quite new ideas of the enormous size of our noble\
Metropolis.\
You will avoid those long, cold, dull evenings in the country, and\
especially by the sea-side, when, you are tired out, can't get a new book,\
\
and are ashamed to have a fire, and you can spend them in the comfort\
oi your own house.\
You can fetch up such a deal of reading which you have never had\
time to manage during the Season, and besides, can resolutely set your-\
self to Alison, ILallam, Hume and Smollett, and other really\
instructive writers.\
You can see a great deal of your poor and unpresentable relations,\
and ask them to tea, hear all their quarrels and grievances, and advise\
them as to the bringing up their children, and otherwise discharge the\
duties of consanguinity.\
And you cannot think how much more yon will enjoy a country\
holiday in 1865 if you omit taking one in 1864, besides that whes, your\
friends return to town you will have so much more leisure to listen to\
all their narratives of travel, having none to bore them with in return.\
So\
Don't Go Out of\
CROQUET,\
rv.\
The turf whereon the Croquet players meet,\
Should be by scythe and roller kept so neat.\
That not e'en " fairy troops which nimbly play,\
And by the springs dance out the summer day,"\
(La which quotation I do scent a pun\
Where Brown of Devon, sure, intended none.)\
Could for their Almack's wish a better floor.\
Give as its length, one hundred feet, no more,\
And sixty-five for width: this will be found\
A general scale for every Croquet ground.\
How through the spaces 'twixt the trees, that keep\
The garden border-land, at every peep,\
A varying landscape may our praise excite;\
How, so to fix th' artistic line of sight\
That, true perspective's rules thus well applied,\
The eye may catch new wonders on each side,\
Until enchanted by this magic scene.\
We own a Chatsworth in a Dowling I\
How such harmonious colours to coll\
As may but aid the general effect,\
flow a fit spot, from shadows free to find,\
Patent to Sun, impervious to the Wind,\
How to make boundless seem contracted space\
In what ethereal term 'twere best to place\
The point where vanishes each airy line,\
Be that Thy task, Sir Joseph, 'tisn't mine.\
A nervous arm, cool head, and steady aim,\
These the essentials of the Croquet game.\
The corpus sanum and mens satut too\
Are both required. Yet, 'twixt me and you,\
As to mens sana\'97 why, there was a match\
At Croquet, t'other day, at Colney Hatch;\
But this, whatever Croquet's foes may say,'\
Proves naught: the hatchers did but play at play\
Behold young Rackety whose very first\
Cry in the morning's "Let me quench my thirst!"\
He '11 dozo while healthy gamesters seek the field,\
His shaking hand the mallet could not wield;\
Up on the sofa stretched he takes his nap.\
While the light novel tumbles from his lap,\
Thus to beguile the Summer hours he tries,\
A burden to himself, a sport for flies!\
For this poor wretch with enervated arms,\
Our manly Croquet hath no sort of charms:\
If I've digressed you will admit I've shown\
How high is our sweet pastime's moral tone.\
When my capricious Muse to details stoops,\
She '11 tell us of the mallets, balls, and hoops,\
The pegs, the colours and tne marking clips.\
Hearken! once more she's opening her lips.\
Sing, sing my Muse! she won't\'97this is distressing,\
The lady does require so much pressing.\
"Here's the piano, now we hope you 11 sing;\
Choose for yourself; oh, any little thing I"\
She smiles, and shakes her head\'97" Oh I if she might\
Be held excused but merely for this night,\
Sbe'd take it as a favour." What we can't\
Refuse, 'tis our best policy to grant:\
And therefore, Miss, you 're free. But our esteem\
You '11 lose, save you next week resume your theme.\

A DOMESTIC RECIPE.\
Mr. Pusch has seen a new periodical called the\
Bystander. At present it is rather slow, and he would\
advise it, as policemen usually advise bystanders, to\
move on. But, as Geokgb Herbert says, no one\
should disdain to pick out treasures from an earthen\
pot: and here is a treasure of a recipe from the new\
work :\'97\
"How to Dp.al wrm a Cross Persoh.\'97We know of no better\
rule thin to keep one's temper under provocation; but this w\'bb\
know is a very difficult thing. Perfect silence is the only way\
some people can keep their tempers, and that to a cross person\
is often but adding fuel to the flame. A little unexpected act etj\
attention, or kindness at such a time, will sometimes surprise your\
opponent into good humour in spite of himself, and start repentant\
tears from hia eyes. Happy he who can do this"\
Well, yes, for to do it properly, he must have a decent\
account at his bankers. We would, in the first place,\
clear away any idea of crossness between masculines,\
because it a fellow shows us the slightest sign of\
temper, we simply pitch the nearest thine at his nead,\
call him a name, which is scarcely one of compliment,\
and walk out of the room. Nor have we anything to\
'do with the way in which a lady should vanquish a cross\
| man\'97the ladies know their own business. But we\
I have tried the above recipe in the case of a cross\

\f0  woman, and with extraordinary success. At the\
moment when the frown was angriest, the pout the\
prominentest, and the foot the shakiest, we suddenly\
clasped a bracelet on one arm, and put a box (grand\
tier) for Faust into the hand belonging to the other.\
We are almost ashamed to say what was the result.\
But it comes expensive, though, and wc agree with\
the Bystander, happy he who can do this.\

Important to Spanish Bondholders.\
Ik the Money Article of the Timet it is thus written :\'97\
"The financial position of Spain is beginning to give rise to\
serious conjectures."\
Those who are interested in Spanish solvency wilbe\
reassured by this announcement of authority, which on\
all commercial and pecuniary matters is acknowledged\
to be infallible. They will take heart from the assurance\
that the financial position of Spain is at last beginning to\
give rise to conjectures of a serious nature. It is so\
long since Spanish finance was looked upon as anything\
but a joke!\

RAILWAY JOKING.\
Dear Punch,\
What funny fellows are these Railway directors\'97the Great\
Western ones especially! Such a famous practical joke they play on\
poor excursionists, and on Sunday mornings too, which makes the thiDg\
si ill funnier. You sec a notice issued, that weekly on that day an\
Excursion train will start for Windsor, Maidenhead and Henley at nine\
o'clock, a.m., and half-a-crown or so a seat. So you cut yourself in\
shaving, in your hurry to be ready, (for early rising on a Sunday is not\
a sane man's usual rule), and, having scampered to the station, you see\
a finger-notice pointing "*y To the Excursion Train;" but if you do\
as I did, you find the gate to which the finger points is locked, and\
nobody is there to tell you where to find the train. Then, if you do as\
I did, you go to the first ticket-clerk you happen to discover, and ask\
for a cheap ticket to the place you want to go to. He says, at least to\
me lie said, "There's no cheap tickets there," and, if you do as I did,\
you '11 be fool enough to credit him, and pay him the full fare. You\
will afterwards discover that cheap tickets were issued, although not\
at the ticket-hole applied to the first-cla\'abs, which chanced to be the one\
at which you happened to present yourself. Of course the clerk might\
have informed you, without much loss of breath, that thoush he gave\
no cheap tickets, another fellow did; but then, you see, the joke of the\
directors would be spoiled, and the joke is just to tempt poor devils\
like me to cheap trains, and then make us pay pretty dearly for a seat\
in them. In the hope that I may see a director reading this, and ask\
him how he likes it, I subscribe myself,\
Yours truthfully, One of the Done.\
P S. Perhaps you H say it served me right for travelling on a Sunday.\
Well, I won't do so again\'97at least not on the Great Western.\
VOICES OF THE NIGHT.\
Mk. Punch in his society is constantly, of course, a hearer of good\
things ; but the two best things that he has heard for many a long day are\
the charming voice of Patti in the Opera of Faust, and the noble voice\
of Titiens in the Opera of Fidelia. Of Patti, Mr. Punch need only say\
her Margherita is a pearl (as the name is said to indicate), which shines\
brightly in the brilliant setting Mr. Gye has given to it. Mr. Punch has\
seen and heard half-a-dozen Margheritas, and hopes to live to hear and\
see at least six dozen of them more; but though each of them may\
have some special claims to praise, he scarcely expects one of them wifl\
please him on the whole so well as Adelina Patti.\
With regard to Leonora, such singing and such acting make Punch\
young again to witness; for while doing so, a score of years fall off\
from bis shoulders, and he fancies himself hearing the best singers of\
old days before voices were worn threadbare by the fury of a Verdi\
and the blaring of a band. The noble music of Beethoven " rendered"\
(as the slang goes) by the noble voice of Titiens, is one of those good\
things that one can never have too much of; and as the Prince or\
Wales has shown his taste for music by " specially desiring" this for\
one last final extra night, Mr. Punch will, in the name of his million\
and one readers, also specially desire it for at least a score of positively\
final last nights more.\

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.\
The Week, July 4\'979. We hope that the Conservatives are now happy\
in their minds. They have been incessantly informing us, for the last two\
or three years, that the House of Commons, representing the country,\
desired nothing so much as to turn Lord Palmerston's Cabinet out of\
office. They have won several isolated elections, and bad convinced\
themselves that these little victories had filed and smoothed down the\
little majority possessed by the Government. We have for a long time\
been assured that Mr. Disraeli had but to go in and win.\
Mr. Punch, who is a tremendous Conservative, but also a being of\
extraordinary;wisdom, has always replied to these statements by begging\
his friends not to dwell in a fool's Paradise. He has assured them that\
the House and the country wished for Lord Palmerston's continuance\
in office, and that the Tories, who make an excellent Opposition\'97for\
the ideal of opposition is a reasonable obstructiveness\'97are not at present\
wanted at the head of the State. For this advice and assurance, which\
he has always tendered in the most delicate and respectful manner, he\
has been horribly abused by Conservative organs, some of which have\
accused him of being bribed by Lord Palmerston, as if Punch was not\
much more able andlikely to bribe Pam than to be bribed by him. He\
has been assailed in the style of the defunct scandalous journals that did\
not spare the names of the ladies of an antagonist's family. And all for\
telling the silly, hungry rank and file of the Conservatives what their\
leaders knew quite well, and dared not tell, namely, that they could not\
turn out Lord Palmerston.\
Now the attempt has been made, and under the most favourable\
circumstances. They could not have expected so capital a chance.\
The sweet face and the popularity of the Princess of Wales, a weak\
and gallant nation fighting bravely against overwhelming millions,\
England awfully abused and ridiculed on the Continent, a rather too\
meddlesome Foreign Secretary to bait, a strong national feeling for the\
Danes, indignation at German atrocities, a series of partial failures in\
diplomacy, the recklessness of a moribund Parliament, all combined to\
promise success to an attack. It has been made, and after a week of\
debate the House of Commons has decided, by a majority of 18 in a\
house of 60S, that the Conservatives shall not come into office. Now.\
perhaps, they wish that they had taken the advice of their faithful\
Punch, instead of abusing that gentle creature.\
(< They can plaster up their wounds in any way they like. The Standard\
"cannot think it a political victory." Nobody has asked the Standard\
to think about anything\'97we hope more humanity exists among us.\
VOL. XLVTI.\
Presently we shall be told that A. was pledged, and broke his word, that B.\
had the gout, that C. would have been with them, but that his wife was ill,\
that D. was shut out, that E. had an unfortunate quarrel with Colonel\
Taylor, that F. is a neighbour of Sir Charles Wood and had bene\
talked over, that G. is a reprobate apostate for whom no condemnation\
is too strong, that H. is a violent Protestant and has been offended by\
the Irish Alliance, that I. missed the train, that J. got into the wrong\
lobby, that K.'s wife is on such terms with Lady Russell that K.\
could hardly vote, especially as Mrs. K. is not in a state of health to\
bear agitation, that L. is suffering under a heavy family affliction (his\
rich uncle has married a housemaid), that M. having been snubbed by\
Mr. Disraeli in 1859, remembered it on Saturday morning, that N.'s\
brother is in a mess with his accounts as a Government clerk, that 0.\
wants a ship for his son, that P. has discovered a dormant claim to a\
Peerage, and has interpreted a confidential wink of Lord Westbury's\
to mean that if P. will not be obnoxious he shall be Lord Pjgwiggin,\
one of these days, that Q.'s daughter visits one of the Maids of Honour,\
and the doting father is ruled by Arabella, and that very foolishly\
(and our people are not half so attentive to these things as Cambridge\
House), It. was not asked to Lady Derby's last party, and his name\
wasn't even given to the newspapers, so he managed to be ill. Here\
are exactly 18 men, and if they had done their duty, as might have been\
expected, where would have been your Palmerston majority? Very\
true. But perhaps Mr. Brand has got 18 letters out of the Liberal\
alphabet which have also been sulking, or honouring their wives and\
daughters, or feeling Protestant, and the rest of it. And be this as it\
may, nobody wants to know how Humpty-Dumpty fell from the wall,\
when we see him lying a smashed conglomerate of egg-shell, yolk, and\
white,\'97and not over fresh.\
Mr. Punch has, upon occasion, reported the hugest debates with a\
condensation ana a minuteness which have excited the wonder of the\
world. Having read every line of the Danish debate, as it will be\
called, because it had really nothing to do with Denmark, he has moved,\
seconded, and unanimously carried a resolution to the effect, that upon\
this occasion he shall be pleasing himself most by merely indicating the\
course of the affair, and noting a few points. The object of the resolu-\
tion moved by Mr. Disraeli was to turn out the Government. The\
Conservative whips never believed that it could be done, but the party\
resolved to try. They had, really, a very good prima facie case, and,\
moreover, as they have done next to nothing all the Session, they were\
bound to give some signs of organised action, if theywere to be con-\
sidered a party at all. The resolution moved by Mr. Disraeli was to\
the effect that the policy of Government had lowered the just influence\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
of England, and it was of course a vote of censure, and was meant and\
accepted as one.\
Monday. Mr. Disraeli moved this resolution in a speech of three\
hours. His cue was to be tremendously solemn and judicial. He cited\
vast quantities of documentary evidence, and sought to show that we\
had deceived Denmark, had insulted and alienated France, and had\
humiliated England. It a dull, decorous statesman had compiled this\
speech, it would have been complimented, but something more brilliant\
was expected from the author of Conmgsby. On the other hand, when\
it was Known that Mr. Gladstone would reply, people did not expect\
much, because the Chancellor's peace-at-almost-any-price policy is\
not capable of lively illustration. But when Mr. Gladstone, after\
meeting the documentary evidence, and charging his antagonist with\
"falsification" (there was a riot over the word, and over "calumnies,"\
and then we had all sorts of gentlemanly retractations), abandoned\
defence, and declared war on Mr. Disraeli, the Chancellor showed\
himself a terrible gladiator, and showered his blows like wintry rain.\
The retort of the Ministers is, "You never have told, and you don't tell\
now, what you would have done."\
Messrs. Newdegate and Kinglake moved amendments, the first a\
strong expression in favour of Denmark, the second a strong expression\
in favour of Government.\
General Peel was indignant, and likewise pious, at least to the\
extent of ending his speech with a text, declaring that the Govern-\
ment had made us a shame to our enemies and a scorn and derision to\
them that are round about us.\
I Lord Stanley (a long head) disclaimed a war policy, and talked of\
the resolution as a protest. Lord Derby's son is not to be done,\
i The Lobd Advocate was the only other speaker to-night.\
Tuesday. Mr. Cobden set out his own non-interference-with-any-\
thing-or-anybody views very cleverly, and ridiculed the Tories for\
wanting to remove Pam, who did their work, in the way of discouraging\
reform and encouraging extravagance, much better than they would be\
allowed to do it. /\
Mr. Roebuck abused the Germans very handsomely, and believed\
that Lobd Palmerston thought Lord Russell a dreadful encum-\
brance. Pam shook his head. "Oh, but I know better," said the\
omniscient Roebuck.\
Mr. Hobsman made an exceedingly clever speech, well composed,\
and full of point and antithesis. He slashed at everybody, and Mr.\
Disraeli, at the end of the week, called him the " Superior Person"\
of the House. He voted with Government,\
i Other speakers. Lobd Robert Cecil, flat and weak. W. E.\
Forster. Butler Johnstone. Lord Harry Vane. Mr. Liddbll.\
Lord Robert Montague. Mr. Whalley (some fun, of the gorilla\
sort\'97he began preaching against the Pope). Mr. Seymour Fitz-\
gerald (ready and able).\
Thursday. Mr. Layard. He defended Lord Russell, and dealt\
some good rough knocks. It was after this speech that the row came.\
Mr. Gatborse Hardy. An effective Conservative speech, pleasantly\
delivered.\
Mr. Bentojck. Speech noticeable chiefly because this great Con-\
servative is by no means full of admiration of his chiefs, and called the\
resolution a rosewater one. Also, in the interest of Protestantism and\
honesty, he let out his belief that the Conservatives had gained certain\
of the ultramontane party, by peculiar means.\
Other speakers. Sir F. Goldsmid. Mr. Cogan. Mb, Peacocke.\
The Attorney-General. Lord John Manners\'97with a neat Latin\
quotation\'97there has not been much classical citation in this debate.\
Friday. Fourth and last night. Bernal Osborne opened, firing\
away good stores. He advised the Liberals not to care what might be\
the result of the division, whether logo killed Cassio, or Cassio him, or\
each the other. Smart, if not statesmanly. Many speeches came alter\
his, but at length Lord Palmerston. loudly cheered, rose. He came\
out with the old spirit. He regretted the pains the Opposition took to\
degrade and vilify their country. He denied that the influence of the\
country was lowered, the charge was a gratuitous libel by those who\
were aiming at office. And, taking the proposed vote as one of censure,\
he showed some reasons why the Government deserved something\
better than censure from the country. In four years they have taken off\
twelve millions of taxes. They have reduced the National Debt by\
eleven millions. They have obtained a French treaty, which has\
enormously increased imports and exports. They have diminished the\
expenditure by three millions. They have fortified our arsenals,\
established our Volunteer system, reformed India\'97and kept us out of\
war. What could\
Mr. Disbaeli reply to that f That was the real answer to the reso-\
lution about Denmark. He saw which way the game was going, made\
some not inapposite jokes on portions of the debate, and somewhat\
gracefully threw himself on his sword.\
At two in the morning of Saturday the numbers were announced.\
Mr. Newdegate was with difficulty induced to withdraw his amend-\
ment, and the House divided on Mr. Kinglake's. The numbers were\
313 to 295.\
There has been but one other House of Commons matter of import-\
ance. The Street Music Bill has been read a Third Time in the Commons,\
and has passed. A Metropolitan Member, eager for another claptrap,\
hoped that it would be thrown, out of the House of Lords. Mr. Punch,\
somewhat excited with the grand debates of the week, has only leisure\
to recollect what appeared in the Times newspaper, when, after a late\
and furious debate, the Reform Bill was rejected. "The Lords hare\
thrown out the Reform Bill. Who can say that when tee next publish\
there will be a Home of Lords f" The hint may be put a little stronger\
in regard to the Music Bill; as, if it be lost, it will be our painful duty\
to do away with the hereditary branch of the Legislature.\
But we have also to mention, not that it much matters, that on the\
night on which the Commons declared that they would not turn out\
Lord Palmerston, the Lords, by a majority of 4, (133 to 119) also\
declared that they would not have Lord Derby as Premier. But\
Lords on both sides then pulled out proxies, that is, the opinions of\
people who had not heard the arguments, and as the Tory bundle of\
these papers was a little thicker than the Liberal one, the result is called\
a majority of 9 for the Derbyites. Here is another little consolation,\
with which Mr. Punch leaves them for the present.\
THE GREAT AJTHTJAX CRICKET-MATCH.\
(From our Colteett-Hatchney Correspondent, as usual.)\
The Great Annual Cricket-Match was the other day played in the\
celebrated grounds not a hundred miles from Colwell S'atch, between\
the Hauwell Eleven and the Baker Street Eleven from Madame\
Tussaud's. It was a glorious day, and the sun beamed on the assem-\
bled multitude who were engaged in piercing holes in their boots pre-\
paratory to putting on their skates. The Umpire arrived in a hamper\
from Town, and was immediately bound hand and foot in his chair,\
which he filled to the satisfaction of every one concerned.\
As the clock struck one, another clock in the village struck two, ami\
a general riot ensued.\
Amid the tears of the children, the execrations of the Umpire, and\
the benediction of the daggers (by the kind permission of Sigrob\
Costa, who had led his horse with his baton all the way froM Town),\
the game commenced.\
The betting was even, the odds being'in favour of the winners.\
At a preconcerted signal the attack was made.\
The names and colours of the riders were successively hoisted up\
above the pavilion, so that they could be seen by the Dean of St.\
Paul's, who was making shorthand notes for the convenience of the\
Organist.\
19 a.m. the wickets were pitched at the bowler, who, giving a loud\
fled into the wilderness. The Police are on his track,\
joined is the score:\'97\

The Colwell Hatchers went in for a hundred and came out without\
them. The bowling was excellent on both sides at ouce. The batting\
was beyond all praise, and the wicket-keepers, who were smashed to\
atoms, expressed themselves highly pleased with the performance.\
Bootjacks were in great request tor hitting people on the head with,\
and fire-irons were at a premium. Among the nobility and gentry\
present we were glad to notice no one we knew. The Umpire, with\
strict impartiality, declared in favour of neither, until threatened with\
the torture, when he succumbed.\
The Colwell Hatchers went away early, but returned to finish the\
game when nobody was looking.\
Madame Tussaud's Eleven were1 last seen melting away in the\
distance.\
The two Elevens subsequently dined together: the casualties were\
numerous.\
All returned to town, grateful to the worthy \\ icar for a rational and\
well-spent day.\

S POLICY.\
Some of our readers\
nay remember an old\
school-book, entitled En-\
iield's Speaker. They\
will be reminded of some\
of the parliamentary eloquence preserved in'that volume, by the sub-\
joined extract from the T report of Mr. Disraeli's speech on hi*\
motion of a vote of censuic on the Government:\'97\
"If em 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  criticism is made on bis ambiguous conduct the noble Lord asks dm\
'What is toot policy?' (Chter* artul cnunitr cktm.) My answer is\'97my policy is the\
honour of England. (Chttrt, and critt of ' Ok /' /Vsm the MmUierial bencktt.) My\
policy la the honour of England and tho peace of Europe, and the noblo Lord has\
betrayed both."\
Indeed, the foregoing beats anything in Enfield's Speaker; but that\
is little to say. Mr. Disraeli excels himself. "My policy is the\
honour of England and the peace of Europe," is a declaration of prin-\
ciple more sonorous and not less significant than that which was\
epitomised in "Our old Constitution and our young Queen!"\
The next time that Dizzy is asked what his policy is, he will perhaps\
reply, "A policy of assurance."\
FALSE FINE EYES.\
The subjoined advertisement, addressed to the sillier portion of the\
softer sex, appeared the other day in the Morning Post:\'97\
BELLA DONNA produces a brilliant Eye. This Lotion is prepared\
according to an Armenian recipe. Tho ladies of Asia hold it in high repute for\
its qualities to give brilliancy, vivacity, and the powor of fascination to the eye."\
Belladonna so named from its use in the form of a wash by Italian\
ladies, not for giving "brilliancy, vivacity, and the power of fascina-\
tion," which they did not want, to the eye," but to produce a delicate\
whiteness of the skin, is a plant called in plain English, Deadly Night-\
shade. Besides poisoning those who take it internally, it will, if out-\
wardly applied to the eye, or near it, cause paralysis of the iris, and\
consequently dilatation of the pupil. As the iris is a contractile curtain,\
contracting in the light, so as to regulate the admission of light into the\
eye, of course, if its contraction is artiticially hindered, more light than is\
requisite for the eye is let into it. More light than is necessary tor the eye\
is, of course, more than is good for it, and too much light does for the eye\
what too much of a good thing does for any other organ; does for it\
regularly in the end. The use of Belladonna by stupidity to give itself\
the appearance of animation is likely, therefore, to result in the addition\
of ocular blindness to mental.\
It is of course useless to observe that the dilated pupil caused by\
belladonna employed for the purpose of giving " brilliancy, vivacity, and\
the power of lascinatiou to the eye," is distinguished at a glance from\
the glowing gaze of emotion and intelligence. The language of the eye\
under the influence of belladonna, used to give it artificial expression,\
proclaims a fool, so that there is no need of talking to her to find her\
out. These remarks are made not with the least expectation of per-\
suading any young lady who is in the habit of using belladonna eyewater\
to leave it off, but only with the view of inducing her father, or brother,\
or guardian, who may happen to find a bottle of that stuif left anywhere\
about the house, to throw it out of window.\

Rise, charming Judy, at the mallet's sound,\
Let your Balmorals press the Croquet ground,\
I from the hall will bring the needful tools,\
And will explain to j ob the simple rules.\
What implements the game demands, my lips\
Shall utter; mallets, balls, pegs, hoops, and clips.\
The Pegs are two, which Posts some choose to call,\
One shows the starting and the winning ball;\
For, as the faithful boomerang the same,\
Our Croquet ball returneth whence it came j\
(I leave it for my readers' thoughtful mind,\
A graver simile than this to find.)\
The other Peg, or Post, as we may say,\
Forms the grand turning point for all who play.\
Each Post, which of a seasoned ash we'd make,\
Should to a point be tapered like a stake;\
These, of the Croquet plane, the north, south pole,\
Between these terms the balls contending roll;\
As to their length, two feet, is my advice,\
One inch one eighth for thickness will suffice:\
Eight coloured rings, by which the balls are meant,\
Upon each peg we always represent,\
In any order, red, white, green we '11 say,\
But, that once fixed, in turn these colours play;\
In choosing pegs, you by experience learned,\
The nicely polished take ana smoothly turned;\
Each " pointed," "polished," "neatly turned,"\'97thus it\
Is like some mot of Smith's or Jbrsold's wit.\

"And what are those?" says Judy. Then she stoops\
To hide a blush while I reply, "the Hoops."\
But think not, fairest of thy sex, I mean\
Offence of any kind t o crinoline.\
Nay, I detest it not, I only say\
That sometimes it is rather in the way.\
Most women (trust me, I am not so rude\
As Judy, or yourself, Ma'am, to include,)\
I'd punish with a heavy fine, if e'er\
A spreading crinoline they dared to wear;\
For.their sweet sakes and. not for mine alone,\
I'd do it; for, Miss, Madam, you must own\
That, though your figure is the one to bear it,\
How few there are who gracefully can wear it!\
IX.\
As when the stubborn bow Ulysses bent,\
Through every ring the victor arrow went.\
So, as to hoops, the would-be winner's ball\
Must, starting from the post, go through them all.\
These hoops (of iron wire made quite round,\
Nor square nor flat will suit the Croquet ground,)\
Should have both ends fixed firmly in the grass,\
Showing an arch, through which the ball must pass,\
Height thirteen inches, ten the space to fill.\
More either way would naught allow for skill:\
Now, as I said last week. Sing up, my Muse!"\
And, as she said last week, "Sir, 1 refuse."\
Just when we in our Croquet are progressing,\
She jibs and stops dead short: no sort of pressing\
Will make her sing a note: I'm\'97blank\'97but there\
She would have made e'en Tate and Brady swear,\
But that they had, as it to me occurs,\
A great deal more to do with llymns than Hers.\
Well. Talleyrand was right: since all must know\
I will not quote his celebrated mot.\

Two Good Reasons for Two Good Things.\

are but 50,000 English Jews, 7 or 8 are elected to Parliament, while,\
though there are 2,000,000 of English Catholics, they send but one\
Catholic Member. The explanation is, that the elected Jews are wise\
men\'97and so are the Catholic electors.\

Dear Tom,\
I Hope you are quite well. I am quite well. I hope your\
sister is quite well. Give my love to her. There has been a jolly fight\
between Ben Dizzy and Bill Gladstone, and Ben has got well licked,\
and 1 am jolly glad of it, for Ben has been an awful nuisance all this\
half, and saving nasty things of one, and getting beastly cocky. You\
know Ben is in the other House and so he couldn't get at me, for you\
know I am in the Upper House, among the other Big Boys. But he\
kept saying spiteful things of me, all behind my back, where he knew\
I could not answer him, and at last he got so cheeky that he pitched\
into Old Pam, and said he'd fight him and Bill Gladstone, to see\
who should be cock. You know Old Pam has been cock of the school\
for ever such a while, and our fellows all like him, because he is so good-\
natured, and is such a clever chap at getting fellows out of messes.\
Ben was a great fool to think that he could fight Bill Gladstone\
and Old Pam, for everybody knows that he's no match for either of\
them. Ben's not a baa hitter, and he's pretty smart in fibbing; but\
though he's pretty lively in setting on his legs, you know we all agree that\
there's no bottom in him, and although his style is showy, he has little real\
strength. You should have seen just how Bill Gladstone floored him\
the first round, there never was a fairer knock-down than he gave him.\
Then he seized him like a rat, and gave him such a shaking, and Dizzy\
looked quite white, and I don't wonder at it. I think Diz will be more\
careful now that the conceit has been a little taken out of him. He's\
got such a black eye, and everybody says that he deserved quite what\
he got, and I know I'm precious glad of it, for he was awful cheeky.\
We break up in a few days, and I hope that we shan't have to come\
to School again till February. So I've a jolly lot of holiday before me\
to write letters, which you know I'm very fond of. And so I must\

VON BISMARCK'S WORD.\
Under the title of "The Proposed Holy Alliance," the Morning\
Post has lately been publishing some alleged correspondence, revealing\
a conspiracy against constitutional Government in Europe between\
Von Bismarck, Von Rechkerg, Gortschakoff, and other ministers\
and agents of the three great European Scoundreldoms of Austria,\
Russia, and Prussia. We might have doubted the authenticity of these\
documents but for the subjoined telegram, addressed to the Prussian\
Ambassador in London -.\'97\
"Carltbad, J\\Uy 3.\
"Your Excellency is expressly authorised to declare that the two P\
patches on the Holy Alliance, published in yesterday's Morning Pott,\
invented.\
"No such document, nor anything similar, exists. \'84 mj\'97gj)\
Considering, in relation to veracity, the assertions which were made\
by Herrvon Bismarck respecting the intentions of Prussia in invading\
the Danish territories, we need only see his name affixed to a statement\
to convince us that the reverse of it is true. The disavowal, equally\

\
THE DRAMA IN THE DRAWING-ROOM.\
Klt Amateur Theatricals\
are now the vogue. The\
following remarks may be\
prettily made by any mem-\
ber or members of the\
delighted audience at the\
conclusion of any private\
performance:\'97\
No. 1.\'97" You 'must be\
very tired after all your\
exertions."\
"Well, to tell you the\
truth, I am rather," says\
Mr. Pipps, candidly, who\
has, by his own particu-\
lar desire, played the chief\
character in three pieces.\
His tone is that of a\
martyr to the amusement\
of society.\
No. 2.\'97" Oh, Mr. Stam-\
per, how could you make\
yourself so hideous? I'm\
sure I should never have\
known you."\
Mr. Symper smiles\
feebly at this delicate flat-\
tery, and takes much cre-\
dit to himself as an artiste.\
He has paid particular at-\
tention to his evening dress\
. and general/personal ap-\
:~ pearance, so that he may\
be in no way identified\
with the ruffian whom he\
has been impersonating.\
No. 3.\'97" It really went\
off admirably. I must\
congratulate you on your\
success."\
Mr. Mivtns looks fool-\
ish, and tries to persuade himself that his first appearance has not been\
such a failure after all.\
No. 4.\'97" What a beautiful dress that was! Where did you get it\
from?"\
Mrs. Thaylyre would have preferred a complimentary remark upon\
her acting; but answers graciously, giving the name of the costumier.\
No. 5.\'97" Oh, you made lis laugh so! I was quite afraid tliat' you\
would hear met"\
The distinguished Amateur, who has been playing the low Comedian's\
Iiart in a Farce, inwardly wishes that the audience had laughed a little\
ouder. _\
No. 6.\'97" I've seen all those pieces played by professionals. I saw\
Charles Mathews play your part in the first piece, and I must\
say"\
"Ah, of course, you oughtn't to compare the two," says Amateur,\
deprecating stern criticism; howbeit he is of opinion that out for con-\
ventional prejudice he is not much behind that admirable comedian.\
No. 7.\'97" You must have played very often, Mr. Noodle," observes\
an amiable lady, with the sweetest smile. "You seemed so much at\
your ease on the stage."\
Mr. Noodle, who has made his first entrance apparently through a\
wall instead ot a door, and has invariably found himself behind the\
person on the stage who was speaking to him, is, of course, delighted\
to hear it.\
No. 8.\'97" That wonderful look that you gave! I can't make out how\
you can do it!"\
As the gentleman can't explain the matter satisfactorily himself, he\
merely sniggers, examines the carpet-pattern, and twiddles a couple\
of shillings in his waistcoat pocket.\
No. 9.\'97" How very well Mr. So and So played," says some pleasant\
young lady, knowing that this remark is so peculiarly acceptable to a\
brother Amateur.\
"Yes, oh yes, very well, very well indeed," replies brother Amateur.\
Of course this is a moat hearty and honest opinion, and. equally of\
course, he doesn't say to another brother Amateur that he didn't\
think much of So and So's playing in that piece, did he, eh P"\
These few suggestions for Drawing-room Conversations will, we feel\
sure, tend to promote such charitable sentiments as it is ever our object\
to implant in the large heart of existing Society.\

THROWING STONES FROM ACROSS .\
THE WATER\
We find that the foreign correspondents are\
continually alluding to, and making extracts\
from an influential journal they call The Cro$$\
Journal. We imagine they mean by this the\
Kreuz Zeitung; but if so, why don't they say so?\
The English title might lead to all kinds of\
errors, for really any less-informed person than\
ourselves might innocently suppose they were\
malevolently sneering at the Saturday Eerie*,\
or else pointing the finger of irreverence at the\
dear old Morning Herald\'97formerly bitter foes\
of ours, but now our warmest friends and allies.\
On their joint parts, as they are scarcely able to\
defend themselves, we beg most indignantly to\
protest against the intended affront.\
ELEEMOSYNARY EAU DE COLOGNE.\
The subjoined paragraph is taken from a column of general news in\
the Post.\'97\
"The Horse Show. Agricultural Hall.\'97Regardless of expense, the enter-\
prising Mr. Joseph Stuart, of 7, Westboume Place, Bishop's Hood West, occupies\
a stall, in the gallery, with a supply of the genuine ' Jersey Eau de Cologne, which\
is not only patronised by Her Majesty, but is also ten percent, stronger than any\
other similar article."\
If the foregoing statement is correct, the enterprising Mb. Joseph\
Stuart is an uncommonly good fellow. He undertook to provide the\
visitors to the Islington Horse Show with a gratuitous distribution of\
Eau de Cologne. The announcement that ne occupies a stall there\
with a supply of that odoriferous article, contains no intimation that he\
charges anything for it; on the contrary, represents him as occupying\
the stall "regardless of expense." H he sells the Eau de Cologne, even\
at a loss, he cannot be wholly regardless of expense, because he does\
regard so much expense as is equal to the difference between selling it\
at a loss and giving it altogether away; and an alleged sale of Eau de\
Cologne, or anything else, would be simply a sell.\
But what are we to think of the allegation that the "genuine 'Jersey'\
Eau de Cologne is not only patronised by Her Majesty, but is also\
ten per cent, stronger than any other similar article?" Surely this is\
an anticlimax. "lis not only ten per cent, stronger than any other\
similar article, but is also patronised by Her Majesty." That is the\
\
called strong is often the reverse of pleasant; but when we are told that\
a scent is not only ten per cent, stronger than any similar scent, but is\
also honoured by Her Majesty's patronage, we understand that its\
strength is sweetness, and if we wished to imbue our pocket handker-\
chiefs with fragrance, and make ourselves generally agreeable by diffusing\
a grateful savour around us, we should, considering that the Queen's\
name is a tower of strength, make choice of the perfume fortified with\
that of Victoria, and, if it were to be sold, lay out money on the\
strength of it.\

SPIRIT-MOVING TRADE INTELLIGENCE.\
Ip we may believe the announcements in the Newspapers, the spirits\
in New York are playing wondrous pranks. They apparently have left\
off twisting easy chairs about and turning tables topsy-turvy, and have\
applied themselves to moving precious metals and provisions. By the\
commercial news transmitted through the Times the other day, we learn\
that on the twentieth of June "gold, which stood at 198L suddenly\
jumped to 201," and we further are informed, under date the twenty-\
third, that:\'97\
"Gold rose yesterday to 245; to-day it has oscillated between 205 and 225."\
This jumping about and rising and oscillating movement on the part\
of gold must clearly have been caused by spiritual agency, for, so far as\
we have knowledge of the nature of this metal, it has nothing automatic\
that could give it motive power.\
But spirit-influence still more curious is described in the next para-\
graph, which speaks in verb-less language of\'97\
"Breadstuas rising. Provisions excited and irregular. Sugars firm. Coffee\
unchanged."\
Here the spirits clearly have been at their work again, and have\
caused an elevation on the part of breadstuff's, doubtless similar to that\
which they produced in Mr. Home. If they would kindly undertake\
to effect a rise in bread just at the right moment in the course of manu-\
facture, the bakers would be thankful for the saving of their yeast.\
But unluckily the spirits never condescend to stoop to any sort of\
useful work, and we nave small hope of their helping us in any hour of\
knead. What kind of provisions were "excited and irregular" we\
are not precisely told; and we may draw upon our fancy for the picture\
of hams wildly waltzing about the larders, and rounds of beef in their\
excitement prancing with polonies or capering with calves* heads.\
A Diplomatic Munchausen.\
In the House of Commons, the other evening. Lord Palmersto!!\
stated that the Prussian Ambassador desired to deny the authenticity\
of the letters published as Bismarck's in the Post "with all the weight\
of his official character." Ha! A nice distinction! The Prussian\
Ambassador's personal character may weigh as much as gold or plati-\
num: but his Excellency does not pledge that. It is far too much to\
say that all the weight of his official character equals that of a feather.\

if it are, you had the broughtage of me up, and might hare eliminated\
me into a consternation of talent.\
Paul B. I taught you your reading, my obtuse and antiseptic child,\
but read you will not, neither improve your little mind, you ungrateful\
and intransitive preterpluperfectibility.\
Toole. Don't say that, Guv'nor; don't be hard upon a promiscuous\

Paul B. Within your what, my uninstructed one? Say that again,\
or say something else.\

Paul B. You must be irresponsible, to make such a response. What\
do you mean by " meteor?" hay P\
Toole. No, not hay; nor yet Will o' the wisp of straw. I am given\
to understand that it is a delicate French Gallicism, and means "in my\
line like."\
Paul B. Your line like! You mean metier, I suppose, my polyglot-\
tical baby?\
Toole. I was afeard if I sounded it too Frenchy as you wouldn't have\
understood me, Guv'nor. But you've no call to aey as I never read.\
I have just been reading a work of suppernatural interest.\
Paul B. Did it keep you from your supper, my greedy one?\
Toole. Well, I won t go quite so fur into waoouum as to say that,\
Guv'nor, but it made me enjoy the sassingers to that degree as I got\
the nightmare, and dreamed I were Mount Vesuvius in a eruption,\
spitting out laver, which indeed I always do in real life, hating that\
same nasty weggitable.\
i Paul B. Favour mc, favour me, favour me with the nomenclature of\
the literary production which has stimulated your tardy predilection for\
the Muses.\
Toole. Gov'nor, we are married men, and had better talk according.\
I have nothing to say about Muses. I have been reading a book. It s\
name, says you? Hurry no man's appellations, says I; one day you\
may have a title-page of your own. 1 wrote it down: Wanderings and\
Recollections, Facts, not Fancies, by Paul Bedford. Ever hear that\
name, Gov'nor?\
Paul B. That concatenation of syllabic utterances does not seem\
entirely novel to my auricular organs.\
Toole. Very likely. Ah! But did you ever hear that name before?\
Paul B. Have I not said so, unpenphrastic one? And the emana-\
tions of this autobiographical historiographer have excited your organs\
of approbativeness.\
Toole. Now I '11 tell you what it is, Gov'nor. I'm a plain man.\
Paul B. Were a prize offered for a plainer, I believe that it would\
remain the undisputed property of the liberal benefactor who pro-\
posed it.\
Toole. You are an indigenous old Behemoth and a hypochondriacal\
Anabaptist, if you come to that. I can say long words as well as you,\
but I prefer common civility.\
Paul B. It is well, my excitable one. Now, impart to me your im-\
pression of the literary performance of Mb. Bedford.\
Toole. Why, it's a stunner.\
Paul B. The epithet is compact, but might be expanded with advan-\
tage to the platitudinarian intellect of the nineteenth century.\
Toole. Well, I was talking about it with a lot of Swells, and them as\
know'd better than rac, and the Swells say that the book is Paul\
Bedford to the life, and all the better for beuig so, and that everybody\
ought to read it, and have a jolly good laugh.\
Paul B. So recommended, I snail probably administer some leisure to\
the perusal of the tome in question. And I am glad, our uncultured\
one, that you are not so palpable a relative of the family whose susten-\
tation is derived from a certain Scottish wild flower as I had appre-\
hended.\

EXTORTION UNDER GOVERNMENT.\
To John Arthur Roebuck, Esq.\
Dear Tearem,\
. Whenever any vermin are engaged in doing mischief behind\
the curtain in official quarters, you are the fellow to go in and rout\
them out. Before this reaches you, very likely you will have been\
induced to raise your honest bark in the House of Commons by some\
letters which have lately appeared in the Times, whence it appears that\
there is some nasty creature in the Inland Revenue Office at work in\
extorting legacy duty from the representatives and descendants of\
parties by whom it is alleged to have oeen left unpaid many years ago\'97\
as many as forty. Down come demands of this kind on executors of\
executors for principal and interest to the amount of nearly three hun-\
dred pounds. Records relative to the original executorship have been\
lost or destroyed; the past payment of the duty cannot be proved, and\
people who know and could know no more about it than the Man in\
the Moon, are fain to submit to the exaction, and pay the whole of the\
money rather than risk the cost of a defence against a Government\
prosecution. See the Times of Thursday, July 7th, in case you happen\
to have overlooked these monstrous cases of legal extortion\'97if it is\
legal. Read the letter, entitled "Hardships of Executors."\
Talk of the oppression exercised by despotic governments; talk of\
any imposition enforced upon the subjects of an Austrian, Russian, or\
Prussian tyrant!1 Talk of any atrocity, short of bodily torture, inflicted\
on the people of his late Majesty of Naples! As for the Pope, his\
Holiness would doubtless feel nis paternal heart lacerated by the mere\
supposition that he was capable of permitting such cruel injustice as\
that which is, as I have told you, practised by some vile underling in\
the Inland Revenue Office. To pattern it we should have to go to\
Turkey\'97the Turkey of Bajazet and Amurath.\
What kind of a creature is it that has set himself to the odious work\
of ferreting out these obsolete claims of the Government on persons\
who are innocent of any knowledge of them? Is it some clerk who\
seeks promotion by the ostentation of a pitiless zeal? Or is it a wretch\
who takes a malignant delight in improving the opportunity that his\
situation affords him of subjecting as many people as he can to annoy-\
ance, distraction, and perhaps even misery and ruin? How comes it\
that he has been suffered\'97he cannot have been commissioned\'97to do\
this dirty work for his superiors? You will doubtless elicit, if you\
have not elicited, an answer to these questions from the Chancellor\
op the Exchequer, or some other responsible party. What brute is\
it that is either amusing himself, or trying to get on, oy extortion in the\
Inland Revenue Office? Find him, Tearem! Fetch him out! Shake\
him, boy! Sess! And believe me, yours ever,\
P.S. Who now will ever dare to accept the office of executor, so long\
as the Inland Revenue Office comes down upon an executor's executor\
for legacy duty on property which he never dreamt of?\
THE LATE MR. WILKS.\
The sudden decease of a political writer and speaker. Mr. Washing-\
ton Wilks, has produced an appeal to the public on behalf of his widow\
and six children. This appeal we heartily second, in the interest of those\
whose helplessness demands all kindly aid, and without any approbation\
of the claim set up that Mr. W. Wilks sacrificed his time to the making\
speeches at public meetings "with a total disregard to his health or\
pecuniary interests." No husband or father has a right to earn such a\
plaudit. He would have seen this, had he lived longer, and would have\
acted up to his conviction, for he was a very earnest man. Help for\
the widow and her children may be sent to the Honorary Secretary of\
the Fund, 65; Fleet Street, and they have the strongest claim upon\
those who will, .we hope, on this occasion deserve the name of Ultra-\
Liberals.\

"WHERE 'S REBECCA P"\
WniHE is Rebecca, Lady Crawley iiec Sharp?\
! The last time we heard of her ladyship was soon\
'after the death of his excellency, Sib Rawdon\
Crawley, when she had taken to distributing\
tracts. If that occupation have not weaned her\
from worldly vanities, Lady Crawley had better\
go over to Paris, and join her illustrious family,\
that of Montmorency, in its protest against Im-\
perial caprice. It seems that the noble old title\
of Dec de Montmorency (no one can forget\
Rebecca's claim of kindred) having become ex-\
tinct, the Emperor has revived it, and bestowed\
it on the Due de Talleyrand-Perigord, who,\
if his pedigree he rightly stated, has as good a\
claim as anybody to that which nobody has a\
right to claim at all. But all the branches of the\
old family are in arms, heraldic and mctaphoric,\
and they appeal to such law as the Elected of the\
Millions has left them, for a sentence against his\
net. Surely Rebecca Lady Crawley will be\
ard of in the matter, and it appears to Mr.\
Punch that on the ground of respectability, she\
is quite as much entitled to be heard as a good\
many who arc mixed up in the fray. "My mo-\
ther was a Montmorency" should be a passport\
to the Tuilerics itself, where anything like old\
blood must be at a premium, among such bril-\
iancies as the Due De la Boubse, the Babok\

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.\
July, Wth, Monday. The feelings of the Clergymen who are adverse\
to saying what is charitable over a deceased person continue to find an\
exponent in Lord Ebury, who persists in demanding an alteration of\
the beautiful burial service of the Church. The Archbishop of\
Canterbury has no objection to a commission for inquiring into the\
subject. The Bishop of London will not hear of alterations in the\
service, but thinks that something might be done to relax the law under\
which the Clergyman is compelled to speak charitably of those whom\
he would prefer to describe to their friends as having gone to a place of\
torture. It will be a pity if some anodyne be not invented for these\
gentle-hearted portions of the surplice population.\
The Mabquis of Westmeath, who is seventy-nine years of age, and\
who, having recently been divorced from his second wife, has just\
married a third, is entitled, both from his age and from his experience\
of church ceremonies, to complain of the inconvenient mode in which\
the services are arranged in the Chapels-Royal. The subject, how-\
ever, is not one of intense interest to the public generally, and\
we do not know, .in fact, what the conjugal Marquis complains\
about.\
On the Shutting Public Houses Bill (which was afterwards passed)\
Lokd Brougham called attention to the advantages of the Cheap\
Kitchens, of which Mr. Punch has said so much. Lord Brougham\
apprised the Peers that for a penny he had obtained a basin of as good\
soup as any of their Lordships could get at homeland that for fourpence\
a plate of meat and vegetables of similar excellence can be had. Did\
not Mr. Punch introduce the system from Glasgow? Knowing that\
such excellent and cheap food can be had, why do young idiots go to\
slap-bangs and eat sodden meat? Because they think such places\
more "genteel." But they are very foolish, especially the short-pipe\
smokers, who need nourishing food to counteract the stunting process\
which is making them such wretched little sallow animals that one\
really hates to look at them on the top of the omnibus, where, by the\
way, they have no business to be, for they ought to walk to their work.\
If Lord Brougham did not say all this, he thought it, and Mr. Punch\
means to get him to say it some evening.\
Mr. Ferkand, making a great row (though he had more than one\
good case to-night, but spoiled it by his violence) was told by Sib\
eorge Grey that he "always spoke under great excitement, and was\
not aware what he said."\
The House then "laughed consumedly" at Mr. Darby Griffith,\
but this is the regular amusement of the House, and hardly worth\
chronicling. He asked some absurd question about what does it\
signify?\
On an Irish Education Vote, to which of course we should not refer\
were there not something more interesting than Irish Education involved,\
there was told, by a Minister, a little romance which beats all the\
sensationists. An Irish gentleman lay under the misfortune of being\
suspected of murdering his wife by poison. The interior of the departed\
was sent to the surgeons at the Cork infirmary to be analysed. The\
unfortunate Irish gentleman had fallen in love with a new Irish lady,\
who was to wed him as soon as he was legally acquitted of getting\
irregularly free from the first marriage. So lie bribed a porter, or\
somebody, at the infirmary, to set the place on fire, in order that any\
evidence that might be obtained from the interior of his wife might be\
destroyed; and the plan was carried out with partial success. Now\
that is something like a story, and we have a presentiment that we\
shall read it in a book, and the novelist will introduce the usual clumsy\
vindication of a disagreeable tale\'97" it actually occurred," as if that had\
anything to do with art.\
Finally, we had a British Museum debate, and Mr. Walpole men-\
tioned various interesting purchases that had been made, none of which,\
any more than a whole host of other invaluable things, can the public\
see, until those beasts and birds shall be taken away. While we can\
see four beautiful giraffes and two hippopotamuses alive, it is too\
absurd to fling lovely Greek marbles into a cellar, to leave room for\
that dusty splitting old straddler of a camclopard, and the wooden-\
looking river-horse at the Museum.\
Tuesday. Lord Shaftesbury, having mentioned a rumour that the\
Prussians had murdered 400 Swedish Volunteers in cold blood, and\
being informed by Lord Russell that he had ascertained that the\
burglars were not guilty of this crime, expressed his satisfaction, but\
declined to make any apology, fairly arguing that the general conduct\

of the Prussians deprived them of any right to complain of any sus-\
picion.\
Lord Malmesbury stated the case of the advocates of the Street\
Music Bill in a temperate and convincing speech, and the Bill was read\
a Second Tune. And the Bill allowing the Masters of Collegiate\
Schools to read prayers, was passed, in spite of the extraordinary objec-\
tions of a few Peers. *\
Lord Palmerston explained that the Brazilian Government behaved\
as ill as they possibly could in regard to Slavery, and to the Negroes\
whom they were forced to emancipate, and said that the Brazilian\
Slave Trade was carried on by the scum of the earth. It was only the\
fear of British cannon that kept the Brazilians to any show of decency.\
The Portuguese were equally criminal, and for still lower motives.\
Mb. Darby Griffiths was then honoured with a Count Out.\
Wednesday. We had another theological Wednesday. Mr. Bottverie\
endeavoured, to do away with the law which connects the Universities\
with the Church of England. For once, a basic principle became\
matter of debate, and battle was given on the question whether the\
Universities ought to be merely national schools, or nurseries of the\
State religion. Mr. Walpole of course took the latter view, but\
dwelt upon the catholic and comprehensive character of a Church that\
includes men of extremely diverse views. Mr. Monsell said that\
under the proposed Bill, M. Renan might be a teacher in a University,\
and Mr. Boutbrib could make no better answer than "No, he is a\
Frenchman." Whalley the Wise supported the Bill, because many\
persons at Oxford were inclined to Popery. The House roared, at\
which probably Mr. Darby Griffith felt jealous, as he must suppose\
himself the person chiefly entitled to make the House laugh. We must\
get up an entertainment for Whalley and Darby to present, all over\
the country, during the holidays. They would eclipse the\
who lately' made a hit as the Ttoo Dromios. Mr. Neatb (i\
Town) opposed the Bill, which was rejected by 157 to 101.\
Then a number of Bills were withdrawn, and divers whitebait,\
ming a little lower down than Westminster, began to feel\
their minds, and to ask one another why fish were\
on the altar of the British Constitution.\
Thursday. The Commons insisted on restoring to the Penal Servitude\
Bill the clause compelling Ticket-of-leave men to report themselves\
once a month to the police. The Lords, after some discussion, decided\
great\
u the\
by 62 to 25 that the clause should be accepted, so Ma. William Sy\
will be obliged, occasionally, to leave his card at the house of\
betters: a dreadfully oppressive rule, but genteel folks have to unde:\
the same penance for weeks together, and feel proud of the task.\
Government really does not see how to compel Railway Companies\
to provide a means of communication between passengers aad the\
guard. Very well, very well. Just wait until Mr. Punch takes his seat\
as a jury-man in a case in which damages are asked by reason of a dis-\
aster that might have been prevented had such communication been\
established. Eh, brother jurymen? "For the plaintiff, mv Lord,\
damages \'a310,000. and the jury wishes that he had asked \'a320,000." We\
have made England into a Heptarchy, governed by\
Railway Kings, but we can temper their despotism by\
form of verdicts.\
We had then a New Zealand debate, in the course of which Ma,\
Roebuck expressed his opinion that the natives must be exterminated,\
and Ms. Cobdew expressed his that Ma. Roebuck was no better than\
a Thug. The late news is not pleasant. Sir Cannibal Tattoo is\
lighting very hard, and very cleverly, for his own. sod his father's land,\
and not only are his military tactics able, but he manifests a spirit\
which makes it very painful to feel that we are shooting him in the\
interest of land-speculators. One of the gallant old chiefs, believing\
that the English had surrounded him. summoned his warriors, read\
them some portions of our Prayer Book, offered \'bbp a short prayer of\
his own, and then said, "Now, let us die by the hands of"\
He and his followers dashed upon us, and cut their way'\
safety. If HavelOck or any other of our own fighting\
done this, we should have had a burst of plaudit, and acres of bad\
poetry in his honour. This war ought to be brought to an end, or left\
to the colonists. However we guaranteed them a loan, by 92 to 55.\
Mr. Darby Griffith, amid wild cries and laughter, wished to know\
about Denmark, "and about our policy in other matters." Needless\
to add, that he got nothing out of Pam. But he had a right to put\
himself " in evidence," for his rival, Whalley thb Wise, had just got\
a great shout by charging the New Zealand Rebellion upon the\
Papists.\
Mr. Punch was much too busy at Wimbledon, shooting for the\
Queen's Prize, to have any time or attention for any more Parliament\
at present. He will be found to have knocked the Friday into next\
week\'97a feat often talked about but never previously performed.\
\
EARLY BIRDS.\
E lately published the pro-\
spectus of a joint-stock com-\
pany for working popular\
enthusiasm to a profit, and\
drawing dividends out of\
hero-worship. Who knows\
how soon we may find this\
Company quoted in the mar-\
ket, now that the domestic\
virtues are begmning to be\
cultivated on co-operative\
principles, and stimulated\
by rewards which are only\
dividends in another form ?.\
We had long known, on\
Lord Dundreary's authority,\
that "the Early Bird picks\
up the worm:" but hence-\
forth the Early Birds have\
determined that they will\
not only pick up worms, but\
money. These Early Birds\
have actually invited the\
birds that flatter themselves\
they mean to be early, or\
are otherwise deeply im-\
pressed with the virtue of earliness, to unite themselves into a Society\'97\
which might as well be a Company at once\'97called "The Early Rising\
Association." Their prospectus, or body of rules (printed at Man-\
chester), now before us, authenticated by the names of a bond-fide\
President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Honorary Secretary, sets out\
ostentatiously\
\'95' The object of this Association is to promote Early Rising."\
"Well\'97and why not?" an Early Bird may ask. If temperance is to\
be promoted by people laying their heads together\'97a timber stockade,\
or pah, to keep out the foul fiend, strong dnnk\'97why not early rising,\
or cleanliness, or piety, or ready money dealing?\
The " Soap-and-Water Society," might be a highly useful organisa-\
tion, with a badge, and the motto, "How are you off for Soap?" the\
proper apparatus of tines for dirty faces and fingers, and prizes for the\
\
members who should show clean hands for the greatest number of\
days in the year. So might a society for cultivating in common the\
great virtue of punctuality in payments\'97the Ready-Reckoners they\
might be called\'97with "Down with your Dust," for a motto. Indeed\
one does not see why the principle should not be carried still further,\
and extended to the culture of the Cardinal virtues as well as mere\
domestic good habits. Why should not the Decalogue be distributed,\
on joint-stock principles (with liability strictly limited to a particular\
virtue), and piety, Sabbath-keeping, honouring one's father and mother,\
abstinence from murder, theft, evil-speaking, lying, and slandering,\
made sources of profit in the shape of prizes for the good people, to\
be made up by fines on the naughty ones, till the world nad been\
taught that virtue was no longer to be her own reward, but might be\
made to bring in a comfortable addition to one's income.\
The most serious objection to this plan is, that as these societies\
operated the fines would get smaller and smaller, and of course the\
prizes with them, till by the time we had brought up all the virtues to\
a premium, there would be no premiums available for them.\
However, we will not do the Early Birds the injustice to think that\
such sordid considerations ever occurred to them. Besides they know\
that it wili be a long time before they can induce everybody to be\
completely dressed every day by 8 a.m.," as each member of t he society\
is to be by the first rule. The rule does not say " up and dressed"\'97!\
whence we infer that if an Early Bird liked to dress himself in bed, or\
to dress himself and go to bed again in his feathers, he would earn\
his day. Then comes a scale of fines to be paid by members not\
dressed at 8 a.m., rising from the mild infliction of Id., after 8 and\
before 8 30, to the alarming figure of 10*. after 11!\
Again, there is a loop-hole opened by the words "completely\
dressed." What is complete dressing? It is a matter of taste: we\
know a gentleman, who generally makes his first appearance in nothing\
but a dressing gown and slippers. One has heard of shirt-collar ana\
straps as a light and airy costume. Surely the society won't require\
/\'bb//-dress. Do they admit peignoirs for ladies and shooting coats, or\
dressing-gowns for males? Do they insist on boots, or tolerate slippers?\
Are trousers indispensable? We see a great field for quibble and\
litigation in these words.\
'On Sundays," (Rule II.) "each.\
must be completely dressed by\
"III. Any member on payment of 10\'ab. is privileged to stay In bed all day,\
except Sundays, when the nno will bo \'a31."\
This is a direct encouragement to any unfortunate Early Bird who\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
"V. Each member must\
hour and minute at which he\
may be caught napping after eleven, not to get up at all, as be is free of\
bed for the whole day for the 1130 fine. "In for three hours in for\
four-and-twenty," is a dangerous principle to admit in a society where\
the temptation to a debauch .between the blankets will, at times, be\
almost irresistible.\
"IV. No excuse for being late will be taken except illness, in which case no fines\
need be paid, and the invalid will be considered as not being late, provided that the\
number of days' illness does not exceed sixty."\
This puzzles us. In the first place, what is the illness that is to let\
an Early Bird off? Will a slight head-ache, or an all-overishness, or a\
general sense of "not feeling very well," or an indisposition to get up,\
Be allowed as illness? And who is to certify the illness? Are Early\
Birds to be put on their honour daily? or is the Association to keep\
doctors for verification? And why, in the name of justice, is an\
unlucky Early Bird, who is ill for more than sixty days, to lose all right\
to indulgence? Is it supposed that if an Early Bird is unable to get\
up at eight o'clock for sixty days running, be may as well die at once\'97\
that he has forfeited all the rights and claims of an Early Bird, and may\
be devoured, in the shape of fines, by the other Early Birds about him,\
as, indeed, we know it is the practice of some birds to fall on and chaw\
up their sick companions? Or is it expected that the terror of the fines\
to come will bring the ailments of all Early Birds to a cure before the\
sixty days are out? Or that all diseases ought to be crushed\'97like the\
Confederate resistance\'97" within sixty days?" Or that no Early Bird,\
as is an Early Bird, can be ill more than sixty days running, and if he\
plead illness for longer, is, ipso facto, convicted of imposture, and\
"taille'able et corteable a merci" like a feudal villein in\
the Revolution P\
led with A book, in which daily to enter the\
and. Each member is put on his honour."\
This answers a query put above. But still\'97? Books are all very well,\
but who is to ensure honest entries? Qttis aatodiat ipsos earlyhirdos?\
"Each member is put on his honour." True. But will he stay there,\
without being looked after? If Early Birds can be trusted to sit\
perched on their honours quietly, and without hopping off or fluttering\
away, under either the fear of fines or the hope of premium, then we\
can "only say they are rartz aves\'97a new breed of Phoenixes\'97birds of a\
feather\'97a feather in their caps\'97birds, not of prey, but praise\'97true\
birds of Paradise.\
Then come the rules about fines and premiums, fixing how the latter\
are to be raised by the former, and to be three\'97the first of one-half the\
sum total of fines, the second of one-third, and the third of one-sixth,\
after expenses. No member is to be eligible for these prizes unless he\
has paid no fines on 340, 320, and 300 days in the year. Ties are to be\
settled by minutes in bed on late mornings. We see a good deal of\
wrangling in prospect over all this. And then to think of the Early\
Birds " sitting on their honour " all through this tempest of temptation!\
The society ought to be called "an association for putting people on\
their honour." Bule X. is another puzzler:\'97\
"If an able-bodied and an Invalid are opwll;- deserving of a prize, the preference\
will be given to the former."\
"Who's to* decide when Early Birds disagree ? 'V Not reason nor\
justice. They would have said where two people are equally deserving,\
divide the prize. But the Early Birds say, that when an invalid Early\
Bird has struggled against his ailments ana triumphed\'97when in spite\
of all the ills bis flesh is heir to, he has been up and carefully\
dressed\'97who shall say at what cost of resolution and suffering?\'97daily\
for 340 days by 8 in the morning, he is to yield the prize to some\
great, strong, hulking Early Bird, who has no nerves, and never knew\
ache, pain or twinge, or was conscious of a liver, stomach, or digestive\
apparatus, and who gets up, not from any sense of duty, fear of fines,\
or nope of premiums, but simply from the promptings of his rude, coarse, j\
insensible, and brutally robust system,'that won't let him lie a-bed, if he\
wished it ever so!\
This we must call the very acme of unfairness, and even cruelty.\
The year of the Early Birds is to end on the 5th of April, when\
the books and fines are to be made up and settled, and prizes awarded\
and distributed, &c. as soon as possible after that date. On this we\
would only remark that there is clearly a mistake'of four days in fixing\
the Early Birds' field-day.\
Bule XV. is remarkable:\'97'\
"A member will not be considered completely dressed without his badge, and\
must never appear in public without It, on penalty of a fine of Id."\
A question arises on this\'97on the legal principle, expressio vnius est\
ercltisto alterius. As a member is not to be considered .completely\
dressed without his badge, is he to be considered completely dressed\
with it? In other words, will wearing the badge be considered com-\
plete dressing? If so, we should like to see the badge before we join\
the Association ....\
By Bule XIX. honorary members are to be admitted on payment of\
five shillings, and will have the privilege\'97of wearing the badge.\
This would seem to imply that the badge must be something orna-\
mental or useful, and increases our desire to see an article, the privi-\
lege of wearing which is worth five shillings, while it constitutes a\
complete dress in itself. We trust the Metropolitan Magistrates have\
been consulted, and that Early Birds in their badges will oe recognised\
as "completely dressed," by the law as well as by the rules of the\
Association.\
Li conclusion, we beg to assure our readers that the Association we\
have been commenting on, really exists. If "birds of a feather flock\
together," Early Birds, it is to be supposed, will join it. If we may\
judge of the probable composition of the society by the Early Birds of\
our acquaintance, we should say that it would bring together, encou-\
rage, inflate, and otherwise aid, abet, and comfort a highly conceited\
and disagreeable set of birds, who are in the habit of revenging\
themselves, for the discomfort of their own early rising, by crowing over\
every other kind of bird for the rest of the day. And our conviction\
is, that the fewer\
the said Early Birds pick up by dint of their\
the better.\

Hint to Fellahs who Call on Us.\
In a case, the other day, at the Middlesex Sessions, Mr. Oscar Lj.\
Burn accused Mr. Morelli, a clown, of assault. But it came out\
that when Mr. Morelli proceeded to beat Mr. Oscar La Burn, the\
latter, by his own admission, "was humming a tune from the Trovatore."\
The sentence was very light. We are glad to see that Judges and\
juries appreciate the boring practice of humming hack old tunes. If\
the air had been out of Mirella, Morelli might have been amerced\
more heavily.\

CROQUET.\
A Parenthesis.\
An English-Frenchman, whom this pen respects,\
Tells me that in my use of circumflex\
Over the "e" in Croquet, as you see,\
I am in no way authorised. iL'aprU\
Of the French language asks for. I confess,\
A circumflex when we omit an "s.")\
My sole authority's John J a -ques; so\
I give him up. Ask him, he ought to know.\
x.\
If you 're a hand at Billiards, then yon\
Will choose a mallet as you would a cue:\
The mallet should be made of Box or Ash,\
All other kinds you may set down as trash;\
Four shapes there are: howbeit, you will see\
But one in constant use. Now this should be\
So balanced, as to need but little strength,\
And, on an average, three feet in length.\
Sometimes the play demands a smartish rap,\
Sometimes you will but give a gentle tap j\
So that you can strike soft or hard with ease,\
You '11 hold the mallet any way you please.\
A coloured ring should every mallet note\'97\
One blue, one red, and so on, as in rote\
Mark both the starting and the turning pegs,\
Like varied garters on two wooden legs.\
XL\
The Croquet Ball comes next; and this should be,\
If made of English wood, formed from that tree\
Which in our parks and forests may be found.\
Whence sylvan 'Peckers draw a hollow sound.\
But better far to bear the mallet's knocks,\
Are Croquet Balls turned out of Turkey-Box';\
Three inches, and a fraction, five by eight,\
Circumference; and fourteen ounces, weight.\
Of Turkey Boxwood made, or Beech, these two;\
Beside, I know none other that would do.\
XII.\
For setting out the Hoops there are three ways,\
Some this approve, some that, some t'other praise,\
Who hold the one the other two condemn,\
And, vice vend, are condemned by them.\
To settle this there is no certain voice,\
You buy your implements and take your choice.\
Test every mode: whate'er you think the best\
Straightway determine on; and, for the rest,\
In this old rule the surest guide you '11 find,\
In non-essentials, have a liberal mind,\
Let, in essentials, Unity prevail,\
In all things, Charity: we yet may hail,\
One of these summer days, though now too late,\
An Act, whose object, it shall duly state,\
Is for the Better Regulation and\
Improvement of the Game throughout the land;\
"Whereas "\'97away with legal phrase!\'97" An Act\
Of Croquet Uniformity" in fact.\
im.\
When six or eight are playing, then the clip\
Is used: 't is made of metal: with a nip\
'T is fixed upon the hoop, through which yon next\
Are going: this decides the question vexed\
As to the player's progress, stops all jangling,\
One Croquet clip a* once cuts short much wrangling;\
So, ladies. I advise its use: but that\
Will call for further notice. Verbum sat.\
xrv.\
Aid me, ye playful nymphs that flit around\
The Pegs and Hoops ot every Croquet Ground!\
Ye gentle spirits do not mock, nor blame\
My humble efforts to describe the Game.\
Eight's the full complement of players: more\
Than six is bad, / think

Of equal skill for Croquet's laurels fight,\
This the best form of game. Say, am I right?\
Let Messrs. Robinson and .1 ones choose sides;\
Miss Smith, Miss Brown; perchance their future brides,\
Events do happen strange as those we read,\
And Croquet, may to Hymen's Altar lead.\
Jones wins the Toss, and, cunning dog, forthwith\
Takes for his partner blonde Miss Emmy Smith;\
While Robinson, who'd just begun to frown,\
Looks happy and selects brunette Miss Brown.\
On Emmy, Bine her partner's care bestows,\
And her with Yellow does Brunette oppose; ,\
Jones chooses Green: two laugh: "he laughs who wins:\
To Robinson the Red: and Red begins.\
BARCELONIAN BOOBIES.\
One has heard that musical fools are the greatest of all fools, and it\
is hard to struggle against such evidence as this. Here is a bit from\
the Musical World, and the story is inserted without a word of com-\
ment, and as if such idiotcies were the most natural and proper demon-\
stration in the world. At Barcelona a piece of foolery has been perpe-\
trated as a special mark of respect to Meyerbeer," who, if he had\
been alive and at all resembled his celebrated fellow-Hebrew, Men-\
doza, would have made his special mark exactly between the eyes of\
the blockhead who could get up such an affair. A sham monument was\
erected on the stage, carpenters, redolent of garlick, of course, swearing\
and quarrelling as they held it up:\'97\
Nine members or the company each bore a letter, surrounded by immortelle!, ot\
kbwcr's name, which they fixed to the monument. On the latter lay the\
\'84 of the celebrated composer's three great masterpieces. They were crovned\
with laurel by the members of the company, headed by the famous double-bassist,\
Bottesini. The audience, in their enthusiasm, let loose upon the stage white doyea\
with black ribbons round their necks, and it so happened that one of the doves\
Boctzsiki's wreath, just as BoTTesnn had laid it down."\
How sweet! Let us hope that the dove was not from the pigeon-\
house of Tobit. How pretty! What a pity that the bird did not\
settle on the fiddler's head, when the "enthusiasm" might have been\
still greater j for unless we can suppose that doves with ribbons on\
them build in the Barcelona opera-boxes, to be ready when wanted,\
the enthusiasm must have been rehearsed at the poulterers' and milli-\
ners'shops. Well, we don't want to be Pharisaical, and we own that\
English mobs, gentle and simple, do behave ridiculously at times, but we\
do not believe that grown-up English folk would do anything but roar\
with laughter, if a sentimental manager attempted such tom-foolery.\
On the other hand, we pay real homage to Meterbeer, by regarding\
his works as the great attraction of our Season. We wonder whether\
one of those Barcelonian fribbles would pay a guinea to hear one of the\
"three great master-pieces?" We don t believe it.\

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.\
Dear Punch,\
Somnambulism and insanity have both been represented on\
the operatic stage, and witnessed with the plaudits of many a pleased\
audience. Amino walks in sleep, and Lucia goes mad, and both of them\
to such sweet music that one is charmed by what to some people might\
seem a painful exhibition. More recently, composers have from mental\
aberrations turned to physical complaints, and sickness has been sweetly\
set to music for the stage. In one Opera the heroine goes off in a\
consumption, and the chief interest is sustained by her portrayal of\
the gradual advance of the disease; while in a still more recent work\
the unhappy prima donna is smitten by a sun-stroke, and dies after\
seeing visions, which she vocally describes. Perhaps ague will be\
chosen next for operatic treatment, and this disease would admirably\
suit the French vibrato style of singing, which fosters quite an agueish\
vibration of the voice. For vocalists who sing as it they had the\
shivers, a sharp attack of ague would be just the very thing to make\
their singing natural; and while the tenor had his shaking fits, the\
baritone or bass might be afflicted with the gout, which would give\
good opportunity for a burst of vocal, vehemence whenever a twinge\
came, or some one trod on his big toe.\
One surely sees enough of sickness in the world, without wanting to\
see it introduced upon the stage, and I could wish that in Mirella the\
sun-stroke had been stricken out of the libretto, ere the pen of the\
composer had begun to labour at it. Of course if foolish girls go\
walking in hot climates with nothing on their heads, they run the risk\
of being smitten by a coup-de-ioleil; but there is very little interest in\
the sight of such an accident, and really I should like Mirella all the\
better if, when she wandered forth to pray for her lost lover, she had\
the common sense to put her shawl and bonnet on, and, for fear of\
sun-stroke, take a parasol. When she sees the vision of what is called\
in the libretto "a wonderful city on the brink of a large lake," and\
sings out in an extasy, "Fors e Gerusalem, ed il suo templo santo; fors e\
I'avel delle Dive del mar," I dare say a good many people thought it\
very fine; but I could not help reflecting that the poet had derived his\
inspiration from the ballad, wherein poor little Billy sings at the\
masthead:\'97\
"I sco Jerusalem and Madagascar,\
And North and South Amerikee,\
And the British fleet a ridin* at anchor.\
With Admiral Nklsoh, K.C.B."\
With all its faults, however (and for these not the composer but the\
poet may be thanked), I think Mirella quite worth hearing by those\
who like to hear a pretty, pleasant, piquant, unpretentious pastoral\
Opera: and I would specially give credit for the way in which this last\
named quality throughout is borne in mind. To people who are fond\
of judging by comparison, and cannot hear one opera without thinking\
of another, I would say that the bold song of the rough suitor Orrias is\
as picturesque and rugged and well suited to the character, as the song\
of Mephistopheles, "LHo dell' or;" while the charming recitative which\
precedes the air Mirella sings before Orrias comes to plague her, is a\
bit that made me think of Weber and Mozart. What most pleased\
me. however, was\'97no, not your song, Mrs. Trebelll piquant as it is,\
and piquante as are you; nor yet your one song, Miss Volpini, pretty as\
it is, and pretty as are you\'97but the duet "Ah, parla ancor!" in which\
the two girls' voices blend so charmingly and sweetly that he must have\
the ears of Midas, who does not feel a pleasant tickle in them while he\
listens to the strain.\
I should not have spoken of the opera so much, but that of the\
theatres there is so little to be said. Indeed our managers this\
season seem somewhat bent on following the early closing move-\
ment, for unless you cross the Thames, or made a journey to the\
City, you will only find four theatres which are not now shut up. At\
these you have the choice of either seeing the Ticket of Leave Man for\
the three hundred and sixtieth time, or of seeing Mr. Webster in one\
of his old parts (Janet Pride or the Dead Henrt, pray which, Mr. Critic,\
do you incline to call his best ?) or of seeing a new play\'97at least a\
newly borrowed one\'97for Ma'amseile Stella Colas, or of seeing a\
new burlesque on the now fashionable Faust. If you have caught the\
Faust fever, and have given your two guineas to see Patti as Mar-\

PUNCH OR THE LONDON CHARIVART.\
gherita, you will hardly grudge a crown to see Mrs. Charles Mathews,\
and note the points wherein her conception of the character differs from\
your pet's. Moreover, you will find that her husband gives a thoroughly\
new reading to the part of Mephistopheles, quite distinct from that\
attempted by Gassier or Faure: and, as a further tempting novelty,\
you will in Fatal at the St. James's, find the Poodle introduced, whom,\
out of reverence for Gothe, Toby was particularly pleased and proud\
to see.\
As to the Princess's play, it is certainly worth seeing, if only to rub\
up one's Spanish history a bit, and improve one's acquaintance with\
King Philip the StcoND-and his father, Charles the Fitth. If,\
from glancing at the playbill, you expect to see some likeness in his\
Majesty, King Philip, to the actor, Mr. Vising, you will certainly be\
disappointed, for, except perhaps in voice, there is no resemblance\
whatever to be traced. The King looks as if he had been framed as his\
own portrait, and had walked out of his frame, so like a fine old Spanish\
picture does he look. Au teste, Ma'amselle Stella Colas is a\
graceful little person, and her attitudes are always pleasant to behold.\
But though her admirers doubtless like to see as much of her as possible,\
she should not have been tempted to play two parts at once, for it\
needlessly fatigues her, and must perplex the pit. I don't want to find\
fault though, for both parts suit her very well; and I very much prefer\
to see her in a piece where (your pardon, Mr. French Author) the words\
are of small consequence, than to see her make a talking ballet-girl of\
Juliet, and to hear the charming poetry of Shaksfeare spoiled by a\
French accent and a somewhat mouthing voice.\
One who Pats.\
THE\
GREAT RESTORATIVE PARTY.\
To Lord John Manners.\
ONSERVATIVE\
Lord, \'97 Now the\
Vote of Censure\
has broken down,\
allow me to tell your\
Lordship what. Our\
party must be re-\
organised. We must\
return to the old\
ways. In the first\
place, let us drop the\
name of Conserva-\
tives. What docs\
it mean? Conserva-\
tives of what? Of\
things as they are?\
Why then we con-\
serve all the Liberal\
legislation of the\
last five-and-thirty\
years. Conserve'\
roses and apricots!\
Conserve my eye!\
I call myself sim-\
ply a Tory; always\
did, always shall.\
I don't want to con-\
serve the whole of\
the present state of\
things, by any\
means. I wish to\
rescind all of it that\
may say I would if I\
\
In fact I\
is the work of Whigs and Radicals\
could abolish the best part of it.\
The so ealled Conservative Party may get into office by a turn of\
luck, but it will never stay there. No party can keep in place now\
except by concession to popular demands. The only difference between\
the Conservative and Liberal parties is, that the former party does that\
with a bad grace, and the latter with a good grace. It must of course\
be the favourite of the two.\
Office is at least as hopeless for truckling trimming Conservatives as\
it is for old Tories. But since we can't get place, let us stand by our\
principles. If all is lost but honour, we may anyhow as well keep\
honour. Conservatives are upholding the very measures which they\
denounced and opposed with all their might only the other day! I call\
that tergiversation. I say it is disgraceful. We may own that we have\
been beaten, but ought to maintain that we were in the right. Let us\
assert boldly that we were, and are, and always have been. They ask\
what our policy is? Let our straightforward answer be:\'97" A retro-\
grade policy." Let us boldly proclaim that we desire to reverse all the\
measures that our predecessors opposed; restore the Test and Corpo-\
ration Acts, repeal Catholic Emancipation and Reform, re-enact the\
Corn Laws, re-establish Protection at large, exclude Dissenters again\
from the Universities altogether, and subject all national education to\
the Established Church.\
If we cannot be content with the good old-fashioned name of Tories,\
we might also call ourselves Restoratives; our avowed design being\
the restoration, if possible, of the good old times.\
My proposal is not Quixotic at all. I don't expect that we shall\
get into office, professing the objects and intentions which I avow.\
But we have a better chance than your sneaking Conservatives.\
America is going to the bad, the Continent of Europe, where not in\
anarchy, is under oppression. Englishmen are frightened; reform has been\
dropped; reaction has begun; it may end in the reascent of Toryism.\
The prosperity of. the country under Liberal Government is an insu-\
perable fact to us at present: but prosperity is eating up the land; and\
m the meanwhile benefits nobody but the commercial classes and the\
common people. The dearness of butcher's meat is owing to the rise\
of wages; and there are plenty of people who are sick of a prosperity\
which is that of others. Prosperity will some day end in a crash. Let\
us bide our time. Disraeli may not seem to see all this; very well,\
then, we must depose him, and find another Ben whose Christian\
name -may be John, if your Lordship is of the same mind with your\
humble servant,\

Interfere with strong hand, and enforce Europe's\
You 're a pretty Policeman, John Bull, to allow\
Those two fellows out yonder to kick up that row.\
Ah! yes, much, no doubt, old one, 'twould answer your ends\
If I did put a stop to those games of your friends.\
But one can't collar two, and you know I should find\
There's another of your lot those parties behind.\
That is all a pretence to excuse standing by.\
Two to one? Pack of stuff. Isn't France your ally?\
Of your backing out only Napoleon's afraid;\
If you '11 go the whole hog, France will give you her aid.\
Come, I say, now, you, whom I renounce and defy,\
Do you think that you see any green in my eye?\
What a nice course is that you would have me pursue,\
France does nothing for nothing as strictly as you.\
Didn't VicTOR-EMMANtjrL Napoleon employ?\
And what had he to pay for it? Nice and Savoy.\
Let a generous idea your counsels inspire.\
You have no end of guns, but you won't open fire.\
Though the weak are attacked, you exert not your might.\
You have ships, you have soldiers, now why don't you fight':\
Either fight or disarm, you behave like a goose,\
Keeping up these huge armaments\'97what is their use?\
Oh! what, don't you know that? Well then, wait and you '11 see,\
In case any of those friends of yours molest me.\
Now then, back, and be off, for your hoof I espy;\
And you won't humbug me, so it's no use to try.\
MRS. HARRIS BANGS THE BISHOPS.\
We were afraid that the Conservative organs would be a little angry\
at the overthrow of all their party hopes, and the falsification of all\
their party prophecies, by the majority that has confirmed Pak in the\
possession of office. But though we "give the losers leave to chide,"\
they should have a little decorum. Who so devout and devoted a\
friend of the Church of England, who so reverent to its venerable\
bishops " sacred with the oil of the Apostolic succession," as our reli-\
gious friend the Standard? Who so piously indignant at Dissenters\
and other atheists, who dare wickedly to think that bishops are only\
men? But it seems that bishops are angels only when they vote with\
Lord Derby:. Hear what the religious Standard says of the others:\'97\
"The Bench of Bishops is filled with the creatures of the Whig party, who opouly\
avow, with an elasticity of conscience to vhich only Bpiscopacy can attain, that they are\
bound to vote even for a falsehood rather than not ' nvignify their maker*.'"\
We shudder. This from the great Church of England organ! We\
thought by the scoff at "Episcopacy," that we were reading the Pres-\
byterian Record, but the words are the words of Mrs. Harris of Shoe\
Lane. What shall be said unto her when she gets another religious fit,\
and the venerable hierarchs of the Catholic and Apostolic Church lie-\
come angels again ?" Elasticity of conscience to which only Episcopacy\
can attain." And this is the paper which the clergy are thought to\
read, and to consider "ably written." It derides Episcopacy, and\
profanely parodies the Bible! Mrs. Harris, Mrs. Harris, why don't\
they keep the pens and ink from you when you are excited, M'm?\

(From our Colwell-Hatchney Housekeeper's Companion.)\
Window Cleaning.\'97Be careful not to stand outside the windows, but\
sit down upon them, pulling up the lower sash, and pulling down the\
upper one at the same time. Take out each pane separately, and clean\
it. This should be done quickly. If the windows are of plate "glass,\
their appearance is much improved by throwing stones and dust over\
them. Clean the corners of each pane with a sharp-pointed stick, which\
you can easily push through, so as to remove the dust from the\
interior and exterior simultaneously. . ,\
The Housekeeper's Companion also contains the following excellent\
Rules for establisliing Libraries in villages and village towns:\'97\
1. That every subscriber be allowed to take out all the books at a\
time.\
2. That he may not keep them away for more than a month, except\
after special application to the Librarian, which shall be invariably\
refused; but which refusal, to avoid all offence, shall not have any\
effect on the subscriber. i\
3. That all persons paying nothing a-year, half in advance, shall\
become life-members, and be admitted to all the privileges of a full\
member. \'95\
4. That a member shall be only a full member after dinner.\
5. That for the purpose of diffusing useful knowledge in the village,\
all the books shalf be in Hebrew, Sanscrit, Syro-Chaldaic, and ancient\
Hindu characters.\
6. That the library shall be open once a-year, from ten till four, during\
which time the Free list will be entirely suspended.\
7. No restriction as to evening dress, which will be worn by all sub-\
scribers throughout the current year.\

THE WICKED LITTLE ONES.\
The Evangelical Alliance, as it modestly calls itself, has been holding\
a four days' conference at Edinburgh. The discourses were not re-\
markable for anything but length. But the Alliance felt itself bound to\
do something to promote Sabbath Observance, and we are privileged in\
being allowed to state that a devout man, the Rev. Dr. Jenkins, was\
inspired with a revelation, which if it be properly heeded, will prevent\
all Sabbath desecration for the end of time:\'97\
"The Rev. Dr. Jenkins said, that he greatly feared that partnls vert nut tvji-\
eimlly cartful to put the childrm t toys out of sight on Saturday night."\
Now we have it. The children do it all. Wicked little wretches!\
If they had their way, we believe that instead of going three times to\
chapel, and learning catechism between "worship," the profane little\
heretics would sit out in a field, and string flowers and sing, and even\
play cup-and-ball. It is awful to think of such juvenile depravity, and\
we heartily thank the stern Jenkins for pointing out the crimes of the\
lisping generation. Now we shall know how to prevent Sabbath dese-\
cration. Little did we imagine that the real authors of so much evil\
were crawling about our knees. But for the future let them look out for\
birch and Calvinism.\

LOFTY SPECULATIONS.\
People who Lave more money than they know what to do with should dispose\
of it in the purchase of shares in some of those highly promising joint-stock\
companies, so many of which we now see advertised in the newspapers and in\
circulars sent to us through the Post-Office or left by errand boys at the door.\
If a man is estimated by the company he keeps, he will of course improve his\
social position by joining a company, in which his fellow-members will, many of\
them, be noblemen. It is now getting to be quite a common proceeding amongst\
the aristocracy to become directors of associations formed for the purpose of\
keeping taverns and shops, or, as their advertisements say, of " acquiring the\
business of Messrs. So and So," guaranteed to return at least ten per cent.\
Various prospectuses of these dignified concerns are before the world\'97or behind\
the fire. In addition to the schemes already proposed by noble lords and gentlemen\
to small capitalists who regard interest rather than security, we may announce\
the following:\'97\
The Queen's Counsel Company (Limited).\'97The formation of this Company\
has been effected with a view to acquire the practice of the Queen's Counsel. Its\
efforts will likewise be directed to tmying up that of the learned Serjeants, and\
the other leading barristers.\
The Medical Attendance Company (Limited).\'97The object of this Association\
is that of acquiring the practice of the principal Physicians and Surgeons of London,\
and supplying medicine and advice and surgical aid of a superior quality to the\
British public.\
Snip and Co. (Limited).\'97This Company has been formed, as its name implies,\
for the purpose of acquiring the business of Mess\'bb3. Snip, Goosey and Co., the\
celebrated tailors.\
The United Applewoman, Tater-Can and Oyster Stall Company (Limited),\'97\
has been formed for the acquisition of the whole of the business at present\
carried on by the old women, costermongers, and others who keep the various\
fruit, and fish-stalls oi this grea' Metropolis. Capital \'a31,000.000, in 10,000 shares of\
\'a3100 each, of which it is not intended to call up more than 6d. a share.\
Having submitted the foregoing list of eligible investments to confiding minds,\
we may ask what product of domestic cookery is resembled\
by an airy commercial speculation which comes to grief?\
Not a hash; no: do you give it up? Bubble and Squeak.\

break his arm, the poet declared that "there was another result-of tho~e\
accursed Corn-Laws." Driven into a corner, the ingenuity of the poetic\
mind did, we believe, devise a concatenation of events which connected\
the broken arm with Protection. We guaranteed a loan to carry on a\
war which every one wishes at an end. Government declares that it is\
only a small portion of the natives who are opposed to us, and also\
deutes that the colonial merchants supply those natives with arms. No,\

took so much pains to explain, for promoting the use of the Metric\
System. Nearly all the Chambers of Commerce are in its favour, said\
the Duke op Argyll. Lord Brougham regarded it as au important\

A speculator having got up a sort of Crcmorne in tlrat peaceful dis-\

declining to license the place. The public-house interest has of\
course, a mouthpiece in Mr. Cox, of Finsbury, and he demanded\
that Government should bring in a Bill compelling the Magistrates to\
give reasons for such a refusal. Sir George Grjsy replied that it was\
no busiuess of his to bring in such a Bill.\
A necessary measure has been somewhat hastily introduced, but\
ought not therefore to be rejected. It is a Bill for the Belief of the\
Casual Poor of London. The purport is to charge all the parishes with\
a general rate in aid of the unfortunate, instead of leaving them to the\
untender mercies of the present system. If honourable Members hail\

noticeable by reason of the extreme calmness and courtesy of Lord\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
Tbe House lias been called the pleasantest club in London, but there\
is no other club where such impertinence would be tolerated. We\
doubt whether the Codgers would permit it.\
Mr. A Tit ton urged, not without prima facie reason, that inasmuch\
as Prussia had brekeu the treaty ol Vienna and the peace of Europe,\
England ought not to hold herself bound to continue to guarantee to\
J'russia the Saxon provinces which she holds under that Treaty. But\
Loud Palmerston could not see that the gross misconduct of Prussia\
freed us from Treaty engagements.\
A Bill passed for enabling the authorities to regulate the traffic over\
the London bridges. This police measure was so much wanted that\
we are surprised it was not violently opposed by some Metropolitan\
Members, and declared to be a violation of common law rights, the\
Thirty-Nine Articles, Magna Charla, and the Vaccination Act.\
Friday. Loud Stratford de Bedcltffe desired to know whether\
there were any truth in the rumours of a new Holy Alliance. Lord\
Bussell thought there was none, and that if there were any, a Holy\
Alliance could do little harm in these days, especially as France and\
England were daily drawn closer together. This may be so. But\
Lord Stratford de Bidcliffe does well to look out. When a\
policeman sees three well-known thieves in friendly council, he does no\
harm in favouring them with a rather rude stare from his bull's-eye.\
Mr. Cobpek delivered a long, and exceedingly clever speech on the\
impolicy of Government in being the Manufacturer of ships, guns, coats,\
rifles, and other things which be contended could be obtained on far\
better terms from private enterpr se. There was much sense in what\
he said, t>f course. But we do not imagine that the time is very near\
when we shall quite carry out. his views, and when, England being^ at\

Cambridge. I suppose the Working Women of the Working Women's\
College, all but those who\
"Means to lire as vargeants and still the laurel wear,"\
will expect to marry University Working Men, at least, and will\
set their caps at the trencher-cap and not at that which consists\
of brown paper. Barristers, physicians and surgeons, beneficed\
clergymen; such, I presume, are the Working Men who, wanting\
wives, will go to the Working Wromen's College for those requisites.\
As yet, however, the Working Women's College is not actually in\
existence. For its actual establishment, however, the old, old condition\
is indispensable. "Money is required," as usual. "There are una-\
voidable expenses which must be incurred," of coarse. You may read\
by <S'terlight that:\'97\
"These are estimated at between \'a3300 and \'a3350 a-year. In order that the per-\
manency of the institution may be secured, the promoters aflk that at hast two\
years' expenses shall be guaranteed, and for assistance in this respect they appeal\
to the public."\
So now then, if any of your readers are blessed with infant, daughters\
whom they would like to get qualified by-and-by for the wives of\
literary and scientific swells, or the g<>\\ crnesscs of gentlemen's children,\
let them come down on the nail for the Working Women's College. I\
suppose they may send their money to the office of the Star. Having\
an ardent attachment to a young lady who I very much wish had\
been sent to a Working Women's College, she is so awfully ignorant,\
I remain, your constant Subscriber,\
WIVES FOR WORKING MEN.\
Old Punch,\
There is now before me a newspaper called the Morning\
Star. It is a penny paper, but really contains one good thing. That\
is an account of a proposed institution, to be called a "W7orking\
Women's College." It is to be constituted like the Working Man's\
College which there is in Great Ormond Street, where I suppose the\
literary working men who some time ago wrote to the Times for and\
against extension of the suffrage, were educated. The original Literary\
Dustman was brought up, as you know, elsewhere, but in the neigh-\
bourhood :\'97\
"You recollects the cinder eep as stood by Gray's Irm Lane, Sirs."\
About the Working Men's College, though. I am not joking, and\
don't in the least mean to make fun of the Working Women's.\
Among its promoters the Star names Mr. Litchfield and Mr. V.\
Lushington, the Bev. E. D. Maurice, Professor Seeley. Pro-\
fessor Cairnes, Dr. Chapman, and Mr. Wt. T. Malleson: all men\
of a material more or less substantial than straw. The Star, with\
reference to the two'former of these gentlemen, remarks that:\'97'\
"The Association of Mr. LrrcnriFLD and Mr Y. LoSHrtffOTON with the proposed\
institution is, in itself, a guaranteo that the project is no weak invention to make a\
flash in the pan, and then be seen no more."\
No doubt; only allow me to say t bat the Morning Star cannot have been\
np very early to talk of a Hash in the pan at this time of day, when pans\
may be said to have been exploded long ago by the explosion of copper\
caps, which, in tlieir turn, needles will soon explode in exploding car-\
tridges for breechloaders. The Star is evidently no shooting star. The\
antiquated metaphor, however, of your brilliant contemporary, detracts\
not Inn? from the interest of its article on that modern institution to\
which that metaphor relates negatively, and is inapplicable. The article\
in qnest:ou on the contemplated Working Women's College assures us\
thereof that:\'97\
"The programme which the promoters put forward has nothing visionary about\
it. Tbe liBt of the subjects for which elementary and advanced classes will be\
formed includes Latin and French, vocal music, drawing, social economy, and\
physiology, besides the moro ordinary but certainly not less useful arithmetic,\
grammar, history, and geography."\
Come, I ssy_Punch, this will be a Working Women's College, indeed.\
What sort of Working Men do yon think those will be who will be\
suitable mates for the Working Women of the Working Women's\
College? We are all Working Men, as many of us as have anything to\
do, and do it. It seems to me that to be eligible for the hand of a\
Spinster of Arts even, who has graduated at the Working Women's\
Cullege, a fellow ought to have taken a pretty good degree at Oxford or\
\
Beautiful Stars.\
There are two stars visible just now, that all dramatic star-gasers\
ought, certainly to see. Of these Stella:, the one is Stella Colas at\
the Princess's Theatre, and the other is La Stella dell Norte at the\
opera-house of Mr. Gye. They both are evening stars, and in the eyes\
of their admirers doubtless both of them are viewed as stars of the first\
magnitude. Telescopes to see these stars may be hired any evening at\
a very trifling charge, and all who wish to take a sight at them must\
look somewhat sharp about it, as the stars will both be setting in a rery\
few more nights.\

BRIGANDAGE AT SYDENHAM.\
Mb, Punch, Sir,\
Until the afternoon of Saturday, the sixteenth of July, I\
hare all my lifetime been under the impression that this was a free\
country. Provided that one did not trespass upon private property,\
1 thought that in Great Britain one might go just where one pleased,\
and do just what one chose to do. On the fatal day, however, to which\
I have referred, this fond belief of mine was effectually dissipated.\
That afternoon, in a weak moment, (my watch unluckily had stopped,\
and so L can't precisely specify which moment was the weak one,) I\
allowed a friend to take me with him to the Crystal Palace. "Come\
and see the pretty actresses," said he to me, alluringly, "They hold a\
fancy fair to-day for the Dramatic College, and you may stare at them,\
you Know, as much as ever you like, and won't nave to pay a penny for\
the privilege of doing so." Well, thought I, one doesn't often get the\
chance of seeing actresses for nothing. So in my innocence I went,\
and, donkey that I was, I quite forgot to recollect to leave my purse\
behind me.\
Well, Sir, directly I set foot within that fatal fancy fair, I found my\
freedom gone, nearly all my money also. A dozen pretty robbers held\
mc captive by their smiles, and would not suffer me to go till i had\
paid good ransom. How many fans and fancy-fairings and photographs\
I purchased is more than I can say; but when my pockets were quite\
full of things that were quite useless to me, one fair syren held me spell\
bound by the magic of her eyes, the while she deftly fastened a rose-bud\
in my button-hole. "Only half-a-crown" I had to pay her for this\
ornament, which I knew in Covent Garden would have cost me only\
twopence. "But you know it's for the College," said she, with a\
sweet smile, and, after robbing me of half-a-crown, thus robbed me of\
remonstrance. And, Sir, will you believe it? while these brigands\
pillaged me, the police stood calmly by, and never stirred a hand to\
help me! There was I entrapped, waylaid and robbed, and at the\
mercy of a gang of thieves who really looked most killing; yet not one\
officer of justice came there to my rescue.\
Having wholly lost my heart and very nearly all my money, I con-\
trived at length to slip away from the Scylla of these Syrens, but then\
1 came to a Charybdis in the shape of an Aunt Sally ground,' which\
completely wrecked my hope that the plundering was ended. Here I\
was kept prisoner until I had paid for half a sovereign's worth of shies,\
and had been so far successful with them as to hit Auut Sally three\
times on her nose. Then, being released, I was dragged to a magician'\
who conjured half-a-crown down my throat wil.hout my knowing it; am\
after being forced to pay two shdlings more to be frightened by a gk&U\
1 had my few remaining wits completely frightened out of me by find"1?\
mj self suddenly in the company of a gorilla, a hon, a big bear, and s<we\
few dozen more wild beasts.\
Add to all these tortures the still more crnel one of being forced to\
go without my dinner (for the rough-and-tumble feed you pay so dearly\
for at Sydenham, it were a mockery to speak of by the sacred name "j\
dinner, when any shilling slap-bang is far worthier of the word), add\
this climax to my misery, and you will hardly wonder that I still P1"'1\
and grumble at the treatment I received.5 But charity, as Lord\
dreary says, helps annually to cover a whole multit ude of skins, and the\
money I was robbed of I know will be well spent in a good charitable\
cause. So I will forgive the Syrens, though I know I can't forge'\
them: and I '11 acknowledge, if they please, that the remembrance "t\
their smiles is a sufficient compensation for the injuries I sustained.\
Wishing the Dramatic College therefore all success, which this yearly\
playing of The Robbers must tend greatly to ensure, believe me,<iiy\

There were young Ministeres and old Ministeres,\

That with Time had nought to do.\
They have ta'en the water at Whitehall-stairs,\
In a steamboat chartered free:\
They haTe steamed full fast the Bridges past\

TRAPS TO CATCH FOOLS.\
Many a valuable lesson on the art of getting money, may be learnt\
from the quack doctors ofthe present day. Their contrivances, though\
very clumsy, are found to answer. A penny-worth of treacle, one pinch\
of cayenne pepper, half a dozen rusty nails, a pint of fluid, and a five\
shilling advertisement, is a failure if it only produce five or six sove-\
reigns. A full-sized goose, has been found equivalent to four race-\
horses, a continental tour, and a diamond brooch. The laughter of the\
'vermin-monger was only moderated by the assurance of his friends,\
that the bird had escaped with a few feathers untouched.\
A small volume circulated through the post, forms an excellent bait.\
; Such a work is easily set up by any unscrupulous printer. The four\
| ingredients\'97mendacity, indecency, blasphemy, and rubbish have only\
: to be well-mixed, and the nauseous compound is sure to be greedily\
swallowed by several lunatics.\
Any individual who has failed in the coaUand-potato-line may do well\
! with a museum. The wax and plaster models must be made on the\
same principles that Mr. Puff employed for his plays,\'97" not to show\
occurrences that happen every day, but things just so strange, that\
'though they never did, they might happen." The beadle (a negro is to\
"be preferred), and the curator should be paid a commission on the\
1 plunder; otherwise they are apt to get dull on the strong drinks con-\
[tained in the preparation jars. It must be remembered that these\
decoy-ducks have to sing the praises of their master, and to give his\
private address for "consultation." To do this with effect requires\
discrimination and judgment. These qualifications are more actively\
brought into play, when it is known that they will be productive. An\
attendant who wastes two or three yards of insinuating talk upon "a\
young man from the country," without indirectly getting to his purse,\
must be ignorant of the very rudiments of the business.\
The despatch of midnight telegrams with " Hints on the Teeth," can\
hardly be recommended at present. A few years hence, when the non-\
restraint system has come fully into play, and Hanwell is converted into\
a suburban tea-garden, it will answer better. Bven dentists may be in\
advance of the age in which they live.\
N.B. The Medical Act, which a generous Government designed for\
the protection of the public, has proved an utter failure. Dr. Punch\
seriously advises his credulous friends not to be made the dupes and\
laughing-stock of the jack-puddings of 1864, whether the latter adver-\
tise themselves as " registered" or "non-registered practitioners," or\
resort to newspapers of apparent respectability, but which ought to\
find their way to the dust-bin of every decent family. The very best\
tonic for nervousness, groundless fears, and imaginary premature decay\
can be obtained in Fleet Street, every Wednesday, for t'\
The Victor of Wimbledon.\

\
PORTRAIT OF THE HASS'\
WHO BKNDS THE FALSE TELEGRAMS TO THE PAPERS.\
MORAL RISKS OF RAILWAYS.\
Mb, Punch,\
The undersigned, equally with Cavendo Tutus, and Pater-\
familias, and other correspondents of your grave contemporaries, is\
impressed with the necessity for providing some way of communication\
between railway passengers and the guard. He is no less impressed\
with the fear that it never will be provided until Railway Companies\
are compelled to provide it by their own interest. A suggestion for\
creating that interest on their behalf will, with your leave, be proposed\
by him, premising that he, for his own part, and for that of others,\
regards those means of communication as required, not only for the\
security of defencelessness from ruffianism, but also for the protection\
of innocence from false accusation. It will not be until Sydney Smith's\
hypothetical prelate has been given into custody on a fictitious charge\
of rudeness by a wicked young woman, that this necessity of a safeguard\
for railway-travellers will be perceived.\
In the meanwhile the expediency of sacrificing comfort to safety of\
good name, insured by unmitigated publicity, may be considered. With\
the view of gaining that point, persons hitherto accustomed to travel in\
first-class carriages, might now take to going by the third class, and so\
continue till they can trust themselves in the first without fear for their\
reputation. That is the suggestion for the above-mentioned purpose,\
offered by your old friend, AuDI Pab.tz^\
Profitable Beading.\
Paterfamilias will be caught by the subjoined advertisement, which\
appeared the other day iu one of the Penny Papers:\'97\
"Elopexent and Markiage in Hioh Life.\'97A full account of the recent elope-\
ment and marriage in high lile will appear in the, &c. Ac. Also, a coluured plate\
of the latest Paris Fashions, and all the latest Fashion and Dress Mews of the\
week."\
The contents above specified, of the paper alluded to, will, taken\
altogether, be doubtless considered by Paterfamilias highly calculated\
to edify his daughters.\
SOME PROSPECT OF A MILLENNIUM.\
We rejoice to find a writer in the enlightened Revue del Deux Monde*\
following up some comments on the subject of British non-intervention,\
with the subjoined observations on that of French:\'97\
11 We think that we, also, would do well to abstain for some time from rater-\
meddling in foreign affairs. France would only gain by falling buck on herself, and\
as in the space of two years ber policy has failed abroad, fhe should pursue at home\
successes more profitable than the diplomatic triumphs which have recently baffled\
all her combinations Our policy should be comprised in two words,\'97lil>erty and\
peace; bberty, which will give us back the sentiment of our rights, which will\
associate us sincerely, really to public affairs, which will complete our political\
education, which will renew the generous propagandism that we exercised lor forty\
years in Europe: peace, by wh ch we sl\'bball render fruitful all the elements of our\
internal prosjierity and atrenwtben the springs of our power. As for our part, vre\
have been convinced for a long timo putt that the surest means of insuring abroad\
the efficacy of French influence is to urge on Liberal measures at home."\
If the foregoing sound and sensible remarks may be taken as the\
expression of French public opinion, France is to be congratulated on\
having awakened at last to a perception of the right course for a\
rational people to pursue, that is to say the course pursued by this\
country. France has not, hitherto, as some Frenchmen have boasted,\
and too many Englishmen have believed, taken the lead in civilisation;\
but she is now at least more nearly doing so than she ever was here-\
tofore, by following that of England. Prussia and Germany, in the\
meanwhile, are adopting the policy of conquest, aggression, plunder,\
murder, and glory, which repentant Euglaud and France has wisely\
discarded. In good time, the French influence, with which neighbouring\
nations will be affected by the spectacle of a France enjoying the happi-\
ness about to be created by the Imperial Government in urging on\
Liberal measures at home, will cause those nations to kick out their\
despots. Prussia, Austria, and Germany will t hen follow in the wake of\
France, as France has followed in that of England; Russia in the same\
way will follow the Germanic nations, and be followed by the kingdoms\
of Ashantee and Dahomey.\
MERCENARIES WELL PAID.\
Mr. Punch,\
Tuus remarks the correspondent of the Neu> Fork Tribune,\
writing from Fredericksburg, on the sufferings of the wounded in the\
American Civil War:\'97\
"Over every rod of the way and in the best two-horse spring ambulances, a\
jarring motion was communicated ny the absence of half the planks on the planked\
side of the road, and the ruts and holes cut into the clay side during a week's rsis\
by the transportation machinery of an army of 100,000 men. On Buch a highway,\
and in such a manner, did these poor fellows, who stretch their hands out of these\
ambulances and army waggons for tin-cupfuls of water, painfully travel\'97some\
with arms off at the shoulder, some with legs off above the knee, some absolutely\
with an arm and leg both off, hundreda shot through the leg or the arm, or the\
breast, some with horrible wounds of tho face even to the loss of the jaw and the\
destruction of speech\'97all presenting in the aggregate every possible variety of\
gun-shot wound."\
Among these mutilated soldiers, Mr. Punchy there were probably\
some for whose miseries we must feel a pity which we cannot express.\
Very likely their number included certain wounded Confederates,\
i Ineffable compassion is due to brave men jolted over rough roads,\
j maimed of arms and legs, or having their bones shattered, their faces\
smashed, or their jaws shot off, and having incurred this wretchedness\
in defence of home and country. But what sympathy can we feel for\
the wretches who have received these hideous injuries in the endeavour,\
for the sake of dollars, or of glory and promotion, or from a mere savage\
love of fighting, and in a spirit of wantonness, to inflict them upon\
others who have never wronged them? It might seem a charity to\
distribute among them a few copies of the above-quoted extract from\
the New York Tribune, with remarks explanatory of the personal\
privations and inconveniences therein detailed.\
I remain, Sir, and hope I may continue, yours ever,\
Armament Square, July, 1804. j Pax.\
THE GERMAN BAND.\
We wish that Mr. Bass, in his bill against bad music, could have\
shown some way of silencing that troublesome German band, which\
has done so much of late to disturb the peace of Europe, The King\
of Prussia has been playing the first fiddle in this baud, and playing\
it in harmony with the Emperor of Austria. Under then- joint\
leadership the band has done its best to make itself a nuisance, and\
very serious complaints have been on all sides urged against it, to which\
it has however paid but little heed. A meeting has been held to protest\
against the band, as disturbers of the peace; but though everybody\
said that the nuisance should be stopped, nobody seemed willing to take\
active steps to stop it. As we abominate all rows, we trust this German\
band may shortly be bound over by somebody to keep the peace, though\
we know of no one who lias sufficient faith in them to offer to come\
forward as surety for their doing so.\

One mallet's length from what at first we call\
The Starting Fusr., the player puts his ball,\
Here o'er the red our Robinson, with calm\
Determination, lifts his dexter arm,\
Whose hand, which even Savers' self might a\
Grasps the firm mallet gleaming in the Sun.\
Not otherwise did Artiiuk lift on hi^h\
The bright Excalibur and foes defy.\
"Now then, look out!" Red's war-cry 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 \
The weapon slowly cuts the fragrant air,\
The list'ners hear the dullest tap proclaim\
The first blow given iu th' exciting game.\
Here Robinson's right hand its cunning shows,\
Through the first Hoop the ball obedient goes,\
And rolling onward seeks with gentlest pace\
'Twixt first and second Hoop a middle place.\
Whence its skilled master with no waste of force\
Can the next 'vantage gain upon his course.\
The Two Hoops won, the Red must now go through\
The Third, that's parallel with number two;\
But from it distant twenty feet, and so\
Back at a sharpish angle you must go.\
Now herein lies the art of arts, to send\
Yourself to such a place as not to lend\
The smallest aid to your opponent, yet\
Where you '11 from your ally assistance get.\
Well, Robinson this crafty method knows,\
And will essay; but he cannot "dispose."\
A buzzing fly or some malicious elf\
Taking that form, or Beelzebub himself,\
The very king of flies, comes up to worry him,\
And when he should be slow and sure to hurry him.\
The Blue and Green do much enjoy the joke,\
Brunette is angry: Red is "off his stroke."\
Dame Fortune suddenly her wheel reverses,\
And his ill luck Red, sotto voce, curses.\
The fickle jade who's backed him, now has tricked him,\
He hits to where he 'II fall an easy victim.\
His turn is over; for this rule's obeyed,\
By none may two successive strokes be played,\
Save one of these three following things you've done -\
Have Roqued, Croqued, or a Hoop just won.\
The meaning of these terms I '11 soon explain.\
At present Robinson can't play again.\
Now Jones commences, and both Hoops he makes.\
Then steady aim he from the second takes\
At Red, and if he hits him, 'twill be seen\
What we by Ruquettiug a personj" mean.\
Huzza! 'tis done! Miss Smith the deed applauds\
As partisans cry out "well hit" at Lord's.\
Napuleou-like, with folded arms and frown,\
Stands Red. "Oh dear!" sighs heavily Miss Brown.\
Intent upon the game, without a word,\
Jon us puts the Green in front of Hoop the third.\
Touching the Red, and thus the foes have met,\
On Green is Jones's foot securely set.\
Wheu Greek meets Greek, we 're told and not before,\
That awful moment comes the tug of war;\
To CroquSt Red, is Jones's present end,\
That is by striking Green the Red to send\
Up to the limits of the Croquet plane,\
Whence he 'II lose time in coming back again\
To his original position; now\
To "Croquet anyone" I've told yon how.\
Jones struck the Green, and thwack! the Green struck Rod,\
Who from his stronger foeman shudd'ring fled.\
Honour the brave! he cannot choose but yield,\
And leave the Green possessor of the field.\
Deem not, careering Jones, that you have won\
The game till all you've got to do is done.;\
Nor be faint-hearted, oh ye other two,\
Till he has done all that he's got to do.\
Never should one despairing side cry Actum\

Lord Edward Howard was pathetic about the foolish fellows who\
go to America and are trapped for the Federal service. We imagine\
that the number is really rather small, bat it is well that emigrants\
should be warned. Mr. Peter Alfred Taylor, the emphatic\
Radical Member for Leicester, took an opportunity of declaring that\
forth the Anti- j the Federals were resolved to put down Slavery, and had the power to\
Grinders' Act, on i do so. With the Confederates ravaging Mary hud and throwing\
Washington and New York into consternation, the declaration seemed\
a Utile ill-timed. Peter had better go down to his constituents and\
blow them up well for being such remans as .to tear Mr. Coxwell's\
balloon to pieces and nearly murder him, because they thought his\
ascent was not to take place. Their treatment of the balloon was the\
more surprising, because folks who return a P\'a3TER Xatlor must be\
rather partial to a Wind-bag.\

and the Sultan. If you are visiting Constantinople, you will of course\
go to the Mosque of St. Sophia, and do not forget to buy a handful of\
those pretty coloured glass cubes that your guides scratch out of the\
great mosaics.\
We regret that Federals and Confederates are still fighting. By the\
way, New York seems to have been a good deal riled, because the\
Deerhound did not hand over the Confederates whom she saved from\
drowning; but why don't the Yankees abuse Louis Napoleon for not\
giving up those who escaped to Cherbourg P\
Very much obliged to the Commons for the money voted. The m\

The Commons talked miscellaneously. Lord Palmerston utterly\
declined to attempt any mediation in America. The Fortifications Bill\
passed after a debate, in which Lord Hartington stated that the\
country was by no means in a " deplorable" condition in regard to\
ordnance. We are glad to hear it, but only the other day the Duke of\
Somerset asserted that wc had no good broadside gun. A Bill for\
sending out raw and half-taught medical officers to India was rejected,\
which was well, but it is not so well that the Army is medically officered,\
to a great extent, by such persons, because men of talent will not enter\
a service in which they are ill-treated.\
The BUI for providing relief for the Casual Poor of London went\
through Committee, and was afterwards hastened through the Lords\
and passed; so that there is reason to hope that wc shall be spared\
many painful and shameful scenes with which men who walk the streets\
on winter nights have been unhappily familiar.\
Moreover, the Commons set themselves against the Bill for the Sur-\
render of Criminals between us and Prussia, inasmuch as we know\
what despots mean by criminals, and we arc not going to be entrapped liberal and munifioent ones,\

The House rescinded the Vote that turned' Bob Lowe out of office.\
Now, he had better rescind his resignation. It was clearly shown that\
he had not done anything dishonourable. It was by no means so clear\
that his enemies had not.\
Mr. Layard said that we could do nothing more for the Circassians,\
whom the Russians have expelled, with their usual barbarous fidelity\
to a policy of acquisition. The brave mountaineers and their long rifles\
will be missed on a day when they might have rendered good service.\
Tuesday and Wednesday. Routine and flat talk. We except a clever\
but awfully bumptious speech from Lord Ellenborough, who retains\
the old-fashioned idea that Britannia rules, not only the waves, but\
all the shores they wash.\
Thursday. The Lords, but not in their Parliamentary capacity, de-\
cided that Mrs. Longworth Yelverton was not the lawful wife of I\
but talking of that, we have not settled that Sir Sydney Cotton is to\
be the new Indian Commander, although he is seventy-three, or so, and\
therefore, of course, the fittest man for the place.\
New Zealand is not quieted. But only a part of the natives are in\
revolt. It is to be hoped that among those who will be finally oblite-\
rated will be Lord Macaulay's eternal New Zealander, who is now\
becoming a nuisance of which the police should take notice.\
Our East Indian possessions are developing their resources, and the\
people there are generally content. Grant Duff was abominably rude\
to Charley Wood, about his inarticulate budget, and deserves to w\
called Grant Duffer.\

the other Chancellor walked into them elegantly.\
The new Act for making Advances for Public Works in the Manufac-\
turing Districts will be useful. Are you not glad to be out of the way\
of public works in London P What with Mr, Thwaites's Sewer barn-\
cades, and the Embankment carters, there is no moving in the streets.\
But I suppose, as the French say, one can't make an omelette without\
breaking eggs.\
The Act for making it easier to make Railways will make them\
cheaper to make. But if the directors do not invent some mode of\
enabling passengers to communicate with guards, and accidents happen,\
it is to.be hoped that juries will give thundering damages.\
General well-being and contentment prevail through the Queen's\
dominions. But this remark doesn't apply to people who would like to\
get out of town in this fine weather, but are obliged to remain and\
attend to the ignominious details of terrestrial business.\
We are glad to remark the progressive increase and developement of\
the national resources. This sentiment is Me. GiAj\'bbTOMB?s. and it is\
not impossible that in the Deep Solitudes of Hawarden Castle, he may\
invent some Awful Sells in the way of new taxes. But1 sufficient for\
the Session is the Budget thereof.\
We are also glad that you. have been able to diminish taxation. By j\
a precious little, say you, but that's ungrateful, and. you must not\
look a gift-remission in the figures. If Gladstone had laid on taxes\
instead of taking them off, you know that you would have borne it\
patiently. The middle classes never complain.\
On returning to your respective (and respectable) Counties you will\
still have important duties to perform, and we hope the grouse will be\
plentiful ana not too strong on the wince By the way, this speech does-\
not apply to such of you as live in Middlesex, because* here you are.\
That s awkward, not to say unconstitutional. We will vary the\
formula next prorogation.\
Some of these duties are connected with the linking together of\
several portions of the community. This does not mean the acts of\
such of you as are Magistrates, when you order different kinds of cul-\
prits to be hand-cuffed in couples, but alludes to jolly field-sports in\
which all classes can join; races, private theatricals, and all that sort\
of thing.\
May all that you do tend to the happiness of the people. Some folks\
may hint that your dispersion, and ceasing from dull debating, may be\
one means to that end. But we must occasionally be serious, and you\
know what is really intended. I do not know that I need detain you\
any longer, and several gentlemen of the Commons will be glad to\
go and snake hands with the Speaker. I should keep gloves on, as the\
weather is so warm, but this is matter of taste, or rather of feeling.\
That is what the Speech might have been, as well as what it was, but\
such as it was, Mr. Punch rejoices that it has been said, and it is with\
much satisfaction that he again puts the stopper into the bottle of\
Essence of Parliament.\
LADIES IN PARLIAMENT.\
Dear Mr. Punch,\
Op course I never read debates, no lady ever does, unless\
indeed she is made to do so by a brutal-minded husband, or a tyrannous\
Papa. But now and then I own, I do like hearing a debate, at least I\
mean I like the fun of sitting by and chatting with the lady friends one\
goes with, and quizzing the poor Members whom one knows, and loves\
to laugh at. So I was very glad to hear that Sir G. Bowter intended\
to ask somebody or other to take away the nasty grating stuck before\
the Ladies' Gallery, and so give us air to breathe and not keep us caged\
up like canaries as we have been. But do you know, Fred tells me\
that the Government won't do it, because they say that if the horrid\
grating were removed, our faces would be visible, and this the stupid\
things declare "would exercise an influence on the proceedings of the\
House which would not be desirable." Fred tells me Mr. Cowper\
used these very words, and as a married man, I think he ought to be\
ashamed of them. In any decent company, the influence of ladies must\
always be desirable, and Sir G. Bowter was quite right in reminding\
Mr, Cowper that ladies were allowed to sit in open galleries in the\
House of lords, for the Peers have no objection to see a pretty bonnet\
and a pretty face beneath it, and are not afraid of being injured by their\
inflnence. Fred says, that Mr, Cowper said, he thought the House\
of Commons was not inclined'to be "exposed to such an ordeal" as\
the presence of a lot of ladies visible would be. Ordeal/ Gracious me!\
Why, one would think the man was talking about walking on hot\
ploughshares, or being stretched upon the rack! The idea of ladies'\
presence being viewed as an "ordeal" for men to undergo, when I'm\
sure they ouglit to view it as an honour and a compliment.\
As for Members being influenced by seeing ladies near them, well,\
perhaps at times they would be, and it would be a very good thing if\
they were. Talk of women's tongues, indeed! I declare we don't love\
talking half so much as men do. And the nonsense that men say, too I\
at least when they sit in Parliament. I'm sure there's not one speech\
in fifty that's worth listening to, and not one in a thousand where the\
man might not in half the time have spoken all he had to say. You\
never heard such hesitation, such hem'ing and such ha'ing, and such a\
saying of the same things over and over again. Well, men may tell us\
that we ladies don't know when to hold our tongues, but we shall cer-\
tainly not learn much if we follow their example.\
I really think if ladies might sit where they were seen, the Members\
would be awed into a better style of speaking. At least they wouldn't\
be so prone to call each other names, as now and then they seem to be;\
because men don't like being chaffed or bullied before ladies, and so the\
debates would be cleared from personalities. Besides when men had\
talked enough, and were beginning to be bores, a grumble from the\
gallerywould be quite enough to stop them. Indeed I should not be\
surprised if ladies were requested to sit on great occasions just opposite\
their husbands, so that, when an orator was getting rather prosy, he\
might just-catch his wife's eye, and prudently sit down before he had\
quite made himself a nuisance to the house.\
England being still in a semi-savage state, ladies are not yet allowed\
to sit in parliament\'97except behind a screen; where, though their\
tongues, say the reporters, may now and then be heard, they are not\
permitted to take part in the debates. I trust that by next Session the\
screen may be removed, as a proof that civilisation is advancing in this\
country; and that though their tongues be sileut, ladies may be suf-\
fered to take part in the debates with as many speaking glances:as they\
feel inclined to give.\
In the hope that Mr. Punch, who is the champion of lhe-ladies, will,\
for the credit of the country, carry this amendment, I beg leave to\
subscribe myself, in all feminine humility,\

P.S. I don't wonder that the Lords beat the Commons in their\
rifle-shooting. How ran men expect to gets sight worth having when\

THE ARMY-SURGEON FAMINE.\
AN INTERCEPTED LETTER\
To Earl de Grey and Ripon.\
My dear De Grey,\
Something must be done to provide the Army with competent\
Surgeons. It seems that they are not to be bad at the terms we offer\
them. Men of education will not come forward to compete for appoint-\
ments by which they do not acquire the position of gentlemen, and the\
pay necessary to maintain it. That is not surprising.\
What, then, is to be done P Common sense, uninformed of military\
matters, would suggest the immediate increase of Army-Surgeons' pay,\
and recognition of their social standing. But the former step would be\
a difficulty for Mr. Gladstone, and the combatant officers will never\
stand the latter. If ever so many Surgeons were killed or wounded in\
operating under fire, it would not signify. The others look upon them\
as civilians, and something lower. I may say that they regard them as\
intermediate between gentlemen and tailors. This may be absurd. It\
is perhaps absurd even of them to despise tailors. But the fact remains\
that they do despise tailors, and would not associate with tailors at all,\
and will not submit to associate on terms of equality with Surgeons.\
There is no arguing with a prejudice.\
Now I should like those who are capable of judging the question to\
consider whether it would not be quite possible to procure plenty of\
Surgeons for the Army, cheap, and perfectly competent, by the simple\
expedient of revising the standard of qualification at present fixed as\
necessary to the competence of Army-Surgeons. I don't know, but it\
strikes me, that a man could learn to cutoff a leg perfectly well without\
learning more of anything else than a butcher, usually knows. I don't\
see that even the ability to perform the most complicated operation in\
surgery requires any more education than what has generally been\
received by a common cabinet-maker. Why shouldn't a man tie an\
artery as expertly as possible, without being exactly able to pronounce\
its Latin name? I suspect the hitch is in that Latin. And if, in\
addition, you require Greek, and modern languages, you render it still\
more insuperable.\
So much for surgery. Now as regards medicine. Considering how\
doctors differ, may we not safely conclude that what they call medical\
science is all humbug, and all that is really useful in medicine is the\
knowledge of what to give for this or that complaint, which might\
easily be acquired by any druggist's apprentice F I put what they call\
diagnosis, and all that, out of the question. I suppose it's easy to tell\
one fever from another, and organic diseases can't be cured, and men\
who are afflicted with them are of no use in the Army. If, then, a\
Surgeon need know no more beyond his own art than a skilled mechanic,\
and if all the knowledge requisite for a physician is no more than might\
be learned by a shop-boy behind a counter, why exact more from an\
Army medical officer f Why catechise him in botany and chemistry,\
and philosophy? Examine him in his own business, and nothing but\
that. In that subject him to competition if youi like; invite Surgeons\
to compete for employment as you might hairdressers. Then you will\
get the sort of fellows you want; fellows who will be satisfied with\
moderate pay, who will not want, and indeed would be disinclined, to\
associate with officers and gentlemen; would be content to mess, where\
they would feel at their ease, with the non-commissioned officers.\
Iii short, if we persist in not giving Army-Surgeons the pay or the\
treatment suitable to educated officers and gentlemen, we must make\
up our minds to accept illiterate snobs for Army-Surgeons. By\

LONDON CHAPJVART.\
\
EXHIBITION\
To be seen Gratis, in Regent Street; the Victim evidently "heretics'" heads. Again:\
briefs and bulls for the commemoration and glorification of St. Simon\
Stock. And now, the other day:\'97\
"After the Upso of five hundred and ninety-nine years from the date of the death\
of the Saint, there appeared in the Cathedral of Bordeaux the Prior of the Carme-\
lite Monastery of London, with one of his Religious, and attended by an English\
layman. The objoct of their visit was to secure a relic of the illustrious English\
Saint, which was to be carried to the country where his first breath had been\
drawn."\
"After the lapse of five hundred and ninety-nine years," now, in the\
nineteenth century, as we used to say before society bad dreamt of\
spirit-rapping, three educated English Roman Catholics appear in\
the Cathedral of Bordeaux, to beg for a bit of dead man for religious\
purposes. They and some others, priests and laymen, marched in\
procession from the Sacristy of the Cathedral to the Chapel where\
the relics were preserved, ana then was enacted the following scene of\
what, if the account of it, as below given, bad appeared in a so-called\
"Evangelical" novel, one would take for an ultra-Protestant's fiction of\
Popish "mummery"!\'97\
"The oasocontaining the relics having been brought into the sacristy, they were\
uncovered according to the appointed ritual. The Prior of London, having exhibited\
the authorisation of the Cardinal Archbishop, obtained an undivided relic, which\
was laid upon a silver cloth-covered pall, and secured by two white silk ribbons\
passed'round tho bone, and sealed at each of the four nids with the seal of the\
Archbishopric. So secured, the relic was placed within a reliquary, and fastened\
down upon a cushion with golden hands. Tho reliquary itself was then eleeed and\
sealed in eight places with the seal of the Archiepiscop.il Sec of Bordeaux. The\
sealed reliquary was then given up to tho Prior of London."\
Now, if this is not indeed "mummery," what solemnity of burlesque\
can be conceived that is? With allowance for the difference between\
verse and prose, the foregoing statement reads like a passage in the\
IngoUtbu Legends. The relic, it will have been observed, consisted of a\
bone. The attention of " the Prior or London," and the Cardinal\
Archbishop," and Cardinal Chigi, who has formally attested this\
relic of St. Simon Stock, may be invited to the fact that it was a bare\
bone. The body of the Saint, when first disinterred, remained "free\
; from corruption, exhaling a marvellous odour;" perhaps a most ancient\
and fishlike smell. But chemistry had got hold of it, and slow decom-\
position had denuded its bones as effectually as if they had been those\
of an alderman, or any other man. The flesh of St. Simon Stock has\
resolved itself into gases long ago, and it does not appear that his few\
remaining bones continue to exhale any odour at all. "A wide distri-\
bution of the relics of St. Simon Stock has been made," we are told,\
"at various periods." For instance:\'97\
"In 1423 our Religious of the town of Ghent received an arm of tho Saint. This\
holy relic, after having been exposed to the veneration of the Faithful in their\
church up to the year 1678, was then wrested from their keeping by the heretics of\
that period. Other robes of our Saint, preserved till that time In the Churches of\
Cologne and of Bruges, in Flanders, underwent the same fate."\
The Saint's arm appears not to have been miraculously capable of\
I holding its own. Otherwise, it might surely as well have punched the\
scekerinq from a Bottle of one of the Advertised Mixtures.\
OSTEOLOGY OF AN OLD SAINT.\
Who was that " Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer," with whom Justice\
Shallow "fought behind Gray's Inn?" Is it possible that he could\
have been a collateral descendant\'97a direct one of course he could not\
have been\'97of St. Simon Stock? And who, most people will ask, was\
St. Simon Stock? He was an English Carmelite monk, who, however,\
became Prior of Bordeaux, and died there on the 10th of May, 1265,\
aged 101. We transcribe the following particulars respecting him from\
a narrative which appeared some time ago in the Toilet, headed " Relics\
of St. Simon Stock :"\'97\
"Saint Simox Stock was interred at tho door of the Carmelite Church, in accord-\
ance with his own express wish ; but, in consequence of the prodigies that were\
there enacted, the Archbishop of Bordeaux, Pierre Roscidival, visited the\
church, caused the body to be taken up from the earth, and placed it upon an\
altar, for tho more convenient veneration of the faithful. So great was the con-\
course of the people upon this occasion, that the whole body was left three days\
exposed witbin tho church, and it remained 'freo from corruption, exhaling a\
marvellous odour.'"\
It had, doubtless, been converted into adipocire, subsequently decom-\
posed, as we shall see. However\'97\
"Prom that time numerous miraculous cures were effected, and it is related that\
the number and authenticity of these oases occasioned many wonderful conversions,\
to the great joy of hoaven and earth. Tho Archbishop, 'after having satisfied\
public devotion, ordered that the body of St. Simon Stock should be placed in a\
more honourable placo until such time as a chapel, which was afterwards built,\
could be raised/"\
So 'the Archbishop granted the friars a habeas corpus^ and accord-\
ingly they had the body of St. Simon Stock transferred to a chapel,\
where it was venerated. Simon was canonised by Pope Nicholas the\
Third, in 1276, and from that time to 1680 divers Popes issued sundry\
I In our Church at Valenciennes, a finger of the Saint la still preserved with great\
veneration. This precious relic, which escaped the fury of the heretics, has been\
the instrument of many prodigies from 1606 to the present time."\
St. Simon Stock's votaries appear to have torn him in pieces:\'97\
II The tomb of St. Simon Stock was opened in 1595, on the occasion of the visit of\
a celebrated Doctor of Salamanca, Religious of the Order in Spain, who had. travelled\
to Bordeaux to visit tho tomb of tho Saint. He asked for and obtained of our\
Superiors the bone of one leg for the Church of our monastery at Salamanca; and\
also one of the sides (une des c6tes) for our Church at Valencia. At Orleans, in\
Franco, the Church of our Fathers was about the same time enriched with one of\
the sides (d'une des cotes) of St. Simon Stock, which is kept in n reliquary carried\
proceesionally every year through the town on the Second Feast of Pentecost. In\
1617 the Carmelites of the convent in Paris obtained also some part of the relics ot\
St. Simon Stock, at the solicitation of M. Mark Antoine de Gourouks, the first\
President of tho Parliament of Bordeaux."\
One pious ecclesiastic, however, seems to have done what he could to\
put the saint together again:\'97\
"In 1863, by the order of the Most Rev. Father General Jerome Ari, all that\
remained to us of the relics of the Saint's holy body was transferred to a rich\
'chasse'of silver, ornamented with precious stones and other works. His holy\
skull was placed within a silver bust and the lower jaw within a silver box."\
St. Simon Stock was not of Shak.speare\\s mind; that is, he had\
not, seemingly, that decided objection to the disturbance of his remains\
which the divine W'llliams recorded in strong language. See, what\
St. Simon has accordingly been reduced to :\'97\
\'95' Amongst the remaining relics are the cranium and jaw of the Saint, part of one\
femur, and parte of other bones. The largest entire relic was that now possessed\
by the English Fathers."\
And, as for that :\'97\
"The relic within its shrino is now honoured in the Chape1 of the Carmelite\
Monastery at Kensington."\
In short, the biggest remaining relic of St. Simon Stock is part of\
the Kensington Carmelite Friars' stock in trade.\

THE LAST OF THE BENEFICENT LASH.\
We have heard little of garotting since the enactment of the statute\
which awarded stripes to the offence so named. Ruffians may fondly\
imagine that Act to have become a dead letter. If any do, they will be\
undeceived by an instructive narration which has appeared in the\
Durham Chronicle, thus commencing:\'97\
"Flogging Garotters.\'97John Cbocdack and Thomas Allison, who were con*\
victcd at the Assizes last week of garotte robberies at Sunderland, and sentenced,\
tho former to five years and the latter to ten years' penal servitude, with 20 lashes\
each, underwent the punishment of flogging at the County Prison on Saturday."\
So much may be sufficient for some scoundrels, who understand well\
enough what a flogging means, and are adequately admonished by a\
knowledge of the fact that two of their peers have had one. But there\
are others whose conceptions of the unpleasantness of being flogged are\
so vague, that any information calculated to give them clear and definite\
ideas on that subject is very desirable for such blackguards. They will\
profit by learning, from the continuation of the foregoing statement,\
that:\'97\
"The instrument of punishment was manufactured by a sailor, who is under-\
going imprisonment in the gaol, expressly for the purpose. The cat is ingeniously\
composed of nine thongs of stout leather, in each of which are nine knots, and these\
being connected to a flexible handle, the power, wielded by strong hands, is\
terrific."\
The construction of the corrective implement thus neatly and pre-\
cisely described, appears to have been quite a labour of love to the\
sailor, who so ingeniously composed it. This scourge is apparently a\
very considerable improvement on the knout, and would doubtless be\
highly approved of, as such, by the Emperor op Russia and General\
Mouravdjfp, for the purpose of causing order to reign in Warsaw, or\
elsewhere amongst insurgent Poles. After a line particularising the\
effects of its vigorous application to an indefinite surface of integument,\
those whom it may concern are apprised that:\'97\
"The prisoners were firmly tied up in a reclining position, the lower part of their\
\'95 boulders exposed, the higher and lower part of their backs being protected by\
padding. The warders, Hodgson and Allison, executed their task with the skill\
of more practised hands."\
By the "reclining position" in which the reporter states that Mb.\
Croudace and Mr. Allison were tied up, he probably means the\
reverse of what he says. A reclining position would have been more\
comfortable for those gentlemen than convenient for the warders who\
had to do them justice. Perhaps he intended to say that they were\
made fast in an inclined position; though it must have been against\
their inclination that they were so fastened. Anyhow their situation\
was such as to enable their disciplinary attendants to get well at them\
so as to execute their task "with the skill of more practised bands."\
The warders not only did this, but they did it with an enthusiasm, and\
a muscular vigour, which seem to have been inspired and stimulated by\
the very strongest antipathy to garotters, such an antipathy as might\
be supposed likely to be felt by persons whose best friends had been\
garotted by the criminals whom they were commissioned to flog.\
Consequently:\'97\
"The first lash was received with comparative equanimity by each prisoner; bat\
on the second 1"\
What follows may be perfectly well apprehended by the imagination\
of Punch's readers. The physical details, however, omitted here, will\
doubtless have been attentively perused by the unimaginative sort of\
persons for whose study they are suitable, and to whose edification they\
must conduce, in the penny papers. We will only add the sequel to\
those instructive particulars:\'97\
"When tho punishment had been inflicted, the prisoners were taken down and\
removed to the prison infirmary in a state of complete prostration,\'97indeed it is\
averred that neither of them could have received another lash without the greatest\
danger. Although the prisoners did not witness the punishment they could hear\
the shrieks of the unhappy sufferers in their cells, and it is to be hoped the contem-\
plation of the punishment may have a salutary effect on their minds."\
It is, indeed. All well constituted minds will agree in the amiable\
aspiration expressed by the reporter of the Durham Chronicle, and sin-\
cerely hope that the consideration of the flogging administered to\
Messrs. Croudace and Allison, garotters, may have a salutary\
effect not only on the minds of the prisoners who had the advantage of\
hearing them roar, but also on the minds of miscreants disposed to\
imitate their crimes, who were out of hearing of their cries. The in-\
fliction of the lash is a degrading and dreadful punishment. May all\
further recourse to it, for the cast Ration of garotters, be rendered\
unnecessary by the discontinuance of garotting.\
A Hint to the Park-Keepers.\
We understand that, out of compliment to those who chiefly use it,\
and who by their behaviour drive away more decent visitors, it is\
intended that St Tames's Park shall be henceforth called St. Giles's.\

A MARTINET OUT OF ORDER.\
eally Indian military service\
appears, in some instances, to\
produce on the intellect a\
peculiar effect, such as may\
be considered to be exem-\
plified in the statement thus\
quoted by the Times:\'97\
"A ParticularColonel.\'97The\
BTigltihman says, 'Our readers\
will remember that a short time\
past Colosel Walters, of Her\
Majesty's 35th, commanding at\
Fyzabad, placed Lieut. Proctor,\
the cantonment joint magistrate,\
under arrest for appearing at a\
ball in plain clothes. Tho matter\
was referred to tho Viceroy by the\
Chief Commissioner, and his Ex-\
cellency has expressed decided\
disapproval of Colon el Wa lters's\
conduct, on the ground that it\
would be highly inconvenient,\
and attended often with serious\
results, if a commanding officer\
were allowed to place a military\
officer in civil employ under\
arrest for what is, after all,\
scarcely a military offence. The\
Viceroy has also requested the\
Commander-in-Chief to take such\
notice as ho may think fit of\
Colonel Walters's conduct'"\
What is there to render it\
necessary that a British officer should appear in his uniform at a ball?\
Why may he not wear plain clothes like any other man, leaving\
decoration to the ladies? For them, indeed, a ball may be regarded\
as a fit opportunity of display, but Colonel Walters seems to\
require that officers should make it an occasion of parade. It may\
be a Colonel's business to prescribe the costume in which his subordi-\
nates are to face a battery of cannon, but what concern has he with\
that in which they dance at balls? If, at those festive assemblies,\
instead of waltzes and quadrilles, it were customary to execute war-\
dances, there would at least be some propriety in warlike attire, and\
still more in war-paint, which might, with consistency, be enforced by\
a savage Colonel. The notice which the Commander-in-Chief will\
probably take of the conduct of Colonel Walters in placing\
Lieutenant Proctor under arrest for the ridiculous .reason above\
specified will probably result, under medical direction, in the administra-\
tion of antibiuous medicine to the gallant Colonel, and the application\
of cooling lotions to his head.\
\
HINTS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF FEMALE\
SERVANTS, ADDRESSED TO LADIES.\
BY AN EXPERIENCED HOUSEKEEPER.\
The want of some practical treatise on the management of that\
peculiar class of individuals, female domestic servants, has long been\
felt in the household world. It would be impossible for us within the\
compass of the following remarks to give anything but a slight sketch\
of a subject, which may at some future time, we hope, be treated of in\
a more masterly and exhaustive manner by abler hands. The few hints\
we propose to give may not, however, be without their effect Lu pro-\
ducing a better understanding between mistress and servant; for\
without some guide the best mtentioned persons are often through\
ignorance, led into errors which they themselves may be afterwards the\
readiest to deplore.\
On engaging a new servant, it is best at once to state, without cir-\
cumlocution, that the place is an exceedingly hard one, and that you\
very much fear she is not equal to the work. It is but mistaken kind-\
ness to attempt to set things in a pleasant and comfortable light at first.\
A little exaggeration the other way is better, as the subsequent sur-\
prise will be all the more pleasant to her on finding the work not so\
hard as represented.\
It is a good plan when you are initiating the new maid into her\
duties, to digress at length on the merits and good qualities of some\
predecessor. Feelingly deplore her loss, express very faint hopes of\
ever getting one like her again, and end Dy a general lamentation\
over servants as they used to be, the small wages they used to ask, in\
comparison with what they demand now-a-days, (it will add force to\
your remarks if you illustrate them by a reference to the wages you\
give to the new-comer), and their plain and inexpensive raiment as\
compared with the tawdry finery ana crinolines of the present time;\
and as servants who are fond of dress generall,V"'Jontnve to obtain\
Fashionable Intelligence.\
(From St. Oila's Chronicle.)\
The interesting infant daughter of an unlicensed Spirit Seller, in the\
neighbourhood of the Seven Dials, is to be christened Oinny.\
most admirers, you will thus be led by easy stages from crinoline to\
followers, against whom it. is, of course, natural, nay, indispensable to\
the maintenance of due order and obedience that you should inveigh in\
no measured terms.\
Having thus made matters smooth, and paved the way to a good\
understanding between herself and yourself, you will have the satis-\
faction of perceiving that you have made her "know her, place," a\
branch of knowledge which all authorities agree to be most necessary\
for servants of every grade.\
Should she have "a misfortin," as the breaking of a wine-glass, or\
the like, begin at once to blame her clumsiness, and on no account\
listen to any explanation ("qui s'excuse." you know, "s'acaae fh but\
threaten to deduct the value of the article out of her wages; for though\
you are, of course, aware that servants have to handle more fragile\
articles in one day than you have in a month, that can be no reason\
whatever for even the pretence of leniency, than which a mistress can\
possess no greater fault.\
Take opportunities of blaming her before her fellow servants, this\
will be soothing to her feelings (if she has any, but it has been shrewdly\
conjectured that servants have none, at least to speak of, indeed some\
persons have gone so far as to consider them mere machines,) and in\
giving your orders send them by word of mouth from one servant to\
another (two heads are better than one) so that should they not be\
duly executed, you can have no hesitation in giving a general scolding\
all round, which is often a relief after any little family disagreement,\
such as will occur sometimes even in tne best regulated households.\
Never scruple to contradict your maid servant'flatly, even when you\
know you are wrong, (how can order be preserved in a house where\
servants know better than thair mistresses ?) should she plainly prove\
you to be in the wrong.don't give way, for that argues moral-weakness,\
but persist in your assertion, whatever it may be, and don't, on any\
account, listen to her. A proneness on the part of a servant to speak\
in her own justification must be at once repressed, it is generally the\
result of that false system of over education, now, alas! so prevalent\
among the lower orders.\
As a general rule, argue with your servants on trivial subiects; if\
you are getting the woret off, raise your voice and out-talk them,\
for, remember, your dignity must never be compromised, nor will it\
do to lose your seltrespect in your intercourse with menials. Be\
continually on your guard against depredations. Depend upon it,\
servants are always ready to take advantage of their employers. To\
prevent, if possible, this pilfering on their part, maintain a system of\
mistrust. Insinuate on every occasion that the loaves of bread have\
been cut (it is not a bad plan to notch the bread or otherwise mark it),\
the milk watered, and the sugar taken. Always count the lumps. Do\
so before the servants, (it is as well to be open and above board in one's\
actions). Be assured that nothing does servants so much good as the\
being suspected. It keeps them up to their work, and whatever mis-\
guided individuals may say to the contrary, induces a more Christian\
spirit in mistress and maid. Should one of your servants tell you that\
her parents are dangerously ill, and express a wish to go and see them,\
you can have no compunction in refusing to give her permission, at the\
same time evince astonishment that she should be so wanting in all\
proper feeling as to wish to leave you. Ask her what she thinks you\
are to do while she is away. If she still persists for some unaccountable\
reason in wishing to go, for fear of what malignant busybodies may\
say, allow her ungraciously to do so, but restrict her so closely as to\
time that she shall have only three-quarters of an hour clear at her\
home, however ill her parents may be. It will never do for you. to\
suffer inconvenience for trifles;^\
Rise late yourself, and scold the maids for their laziness in lying so\
long in bed. Assert positively that the clock had struck seven before\
they were down\'97your being asleep at that time should be no bar to\
your doing your duty to yourself or them.\
Finally, when you are at a loss (which a good manager never should\
be) upon what subject to have a difference with, or vulgarly speaking, |\
to blow up your cook, you must fall back upon that grand P&<% <**\
rhutance dripping, or if it be winter time, upon candles. They are\
splendid topics for an animated discussion, the first named especially, i\
introducing, as it does, the grand question of perquisites, with all its I\
intricate ramifications.\

HOWLING GAROTTERS.\
As if a flogged ruffian were not tolerably competent to howl for\
himself, the Morning Star helps him with an additional bellow. A\
couple of garotting scoundrels came under the cat at Durham the other\
day, and because the lash was administered in an efficacious way, our\
contemporary raises as much outcry as if he, and not the cowardly\
brutes m question had "caught it." What sentimental nonsense next P\
Mr. Punch abhors and detests the lash as a punishment for the soldier,\
but there is a peculiar and special case in which such an infliction is\
exactly the thing to be desired. The villains who, for the sake of plunder,\
make a dastardly attack in the dark, and fell and stun an honest man,\
upon whose fife and energy depends the well-doing of a family, deserve\
any amount of punishment; but the best, both as chastisement and as\
example, is that which they most dread, and there is nothing so dreaded\
by them as physical pain. It seems that these Durham rascals, though\
soundly flogged, were castigated with far more tenderness than is\
bestowed on the soldier. Pads to protect their upper and lower regions\
were provided. But the lash was admirably well laid on, and they\
howled and shrieked tremendously, and when something was said about\
it in the House, Sir George Grey replied that all had been done in\
conformity with law, but that really "flogging must be a disagreeable\
operation." The House laughed and applauded, and the nation, which\
reserves its sympathy for deserving objects (witness the Wimbledon\
abstinence from amusement, and from firing, for the sake of one unfor-\
tunate man) will say," Serve the scoundrels right, and let the same dose\
be administered whenever such dastardly ruffians can be got under the\
swing of the not quite harmless, but decidedly necessary Cat."\

Is it the biscuits or the baker that must be second-hand? In either\

a taste for buying biscuits second-hand, after some one else has munched\
them P Or, in the other case, pray what on earth is meant by a "second-\
hand " baker! Footmen advertise themselves sometimes as being "single-\
handed," so possibly the advertiser put in "second-hand" to make it\
clear he wished the baker to possess a second hand, which in any time\
of knead would certainly be useful to him.\

[August 13,\
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
SEA-LIONS AT SCHOOL.\
E gentlemen of Eng-\
land who don't live\
on bread and cheese,\
but can give your-\
selves good dinners\
down at Greenwich\
if you please, Punch\
has some six words\
to say which he will\
thank you to attend\
to.\
You may recollect,\
perhaps, that on your\
road to Greenwich,\
that is if you go by\
WH railroad, you pass a\
certain station which\
is called Kew Cross.\
Now there exists in\
that same neigh-\
bourhood a certain\
Royal Naval School,\
which more than\
thirty years ago was\
founded for the be-\
nefit of sons of Naval\
officers, and of offi-\
cers in the Marines.\
If when you next go\
down to Whitebait you just pull up at New Cross, you may learn that at this\
school for future Colltngwoods and Nelsons :\'97\
"Nearly two hundred sons of Naval and Marino officers are now receiving the benefits of a\
first-rate education, qualifying them for any pursuit in life, on less terms than the actual coat\
of their maintenance, and a portion of these pupils, in necessitous circumstances, are maintained\
gratuitously, and on a merely nominal charge, preference being given to the orphans of those\
who have fallen in the country's service; and it is an ennobling feature in this school that the\
names of these, or the terms upon which they are admitted, are unknown to any ono in the\
establishment. Cases of pressing necessity are at once met. How promptly this is done may be\
seen from the report of the Council, who refer, with pride, to the immediate admission, upon the\
foundation, of the son of an officer who was drowned in Her Majesty's ship Orpheu*, and to numerous\
other instances in which orphans have been received, without the delay, expenso, and anxiety of\
canvassing for votes; all these cases being thoroughly sifted and decided solely on their merits."\
If you have time enough, you also may just have a little chat with Mr. Alfred\
Eames, who has managed from its birth the finances of the school, and, to bis\
credit be it said, never has allowed it to get into debt. Mr. Eames is much too\
modest to brag of his good management; but if you chance to look benevolent,\
he will very likely drop a gentle hint that schools, however well they are managed,\
\
do as a rule cost money, and that the Royal Naval School is\
no exception to the rule. On hearing this, perhaps, you\
will assume a hurried air" and pull your watch out nastily,\
and suddenly remember that your train is due for Green-\
wich. Of course Punch too well knows what is due to a\
good appetite, to recommend you to run risks of being'\
late for dinner and finding your fish spoiled. But, dinne r\
being over, and the bump of your benevolence being- plea-\
santry excited by the whitebait you have copiously been\
washing down your throat, just talk the matter over with\
the friends you have around you; and, as you glance at\
Greenwich Hospital, where old. sea-lions have a den pro-\
vided them for life, just cast your eye up-stream and think\
of New Cross Naval School, which has been launched ex-\
ressly for the sons of old sea-lions, of a somewhat higher\
Ten thousand pounds or so is all that is required for th?\
completion of the School, which then will hold three\
hundred scholars, as its founders wished it should do. If\
you don't happen to have this trifling sum about you after\
payment of your bill (and after a fish-dinner one is apt to\
find one's person somewhat fuller than one's purse), the\
best thing you can do is just to write a cheque tor the few\
hundreds or so lying idle at your banker's, and get the\
friends about you to do the same. Tor fear of any acci-\
dent, you can stop on your way home and leave the\
cheques with Mr. Eames, who, if you ask him prettily,\
will not object to take them because perhaps the signatures\
are not written quite straight.\
It has been lyrically stated that\'97\
"Britain's best bulwarks are her wooden walls."\
But wooden walls, or even iron ones, would prove of little\
service, if wooden heads commanded them. By the Royal\
Naval School the heads of future Captains are saved from\
growing ligneous, and Admirals that are to be have their J\
brains put in good trim to go on active service whenever\
there is need. So, ye gentlemen of England, who'd live\
at home at ease, Without fear of molestation by the French ,\
or Portuguese, or Russians, Prussians, Spaniards, Turks,\
Dutch, Yankees, or Chinese, Or any other nation that has\
ships upon the seas. Subscribe unto the Naval School at\
Now Cross if you please, And teach our young sea-lions\
how to mind their \'a3*s and p's. Only one wing more is\
wanted to complete this Naval School; so give your ten\
thousand pounds more, gentlemen, and up will go this I\
wing: ana the school, having two wings, will then get on I\
"like flying." |\
r f\
EXTORTION OF INLAND REVENUE.\
From letters that continue to be sent to the Times by executors and\
lawyers, it appears that the authorities of the Inland Revenue Office\
are conducting the affairs of their Legacy and Succession Duty\
Department like low tradesmen, rascals who Keep their accounts in a\
slovenly way, neglect to enter the payments made to them, and every\
now and then try on the dodge of sending in again the bill that has been\
already paid, on the chance that the loss of receipts by the customer\
will enable them to make him pay it twice over; when the receipts are\
produced against them saying that they are " very sorry." The agent\
of this scoundrelism is, of course, not to be blamed for it, if, in its execu-\
tion, he only obeys orders. He is no more a thief than the Jack\
Ketch who hangs an innocent man by official warrant is a murderer.\
The instrument of the extortion practised by the Legacy Duty Office is\
named in the Times, a Mb. Trevor. His employment seems to consist\
in looking up the accounts of duty due and settled some twenty, thirty,\
or forty years ago, but of which the settlement was unrecorded by the\
fault of negb'gent clerks, and demanding the repayment of the Govern-\
ment bill with the menace of a Crown prosecution. If this Trevor is\
not a malignant misanthrope, availing himself of the facilities of his\
position to amuse himself by the infliction of misery and ruin upon\
everybody whom he finds in his power, his employers will surely be at\
once dismissed from Her Majesty's Service. The Trevoracity of these\
harpies is insufferable. Either they should be sent about their business,\
or Mr. Trevor should be obliged to exchange his situation for an\
appointment in Bedlam.\
Architectural.\
It is said that portions of St. Paul's must shortly undergo repair.\
It is also proposed that a Festival in honour of Sir Christopher be\
held. The Dean, however, opposes all Wren-ovation.\
Sport.\'97Nice Dinner for Sporting Men.\'97Steaks and Cup.\
LATHER AND SMOKE.\
We read in the Leicester Journal that a barber, named Allen,\
charged before the Magistrates of the balloon-destroying borough with\
Sunday shaving, pleaded\'97\
"That the persons who laid the informations were actually carrying on\
of a much more annoying and demoralising character, that of tobacconist and cigar\
dealers, and were teaching boys and youths to smoke bad Cigar* on tkt Sunday, to the\
annoyance of all respoctable persons."\
Well said. Allen the Shaver. For boys and youths to smoke at all\
is bad, for them to smoke on Sunday is worse, but for them to smoke\
bad Cigars on Sunday to the annoyance of respectable people is worst.\
You are a logical man, and we dare say an easy shaver, and we agree\
with the Magistrates that there was very great force in what you said.\
We wish they had not fined you. We approve your protest against the\
sickening signt of brats sucking tobacco. It is a pity that the police\
are not empowered to take away pipes and cigars from the little\
wretches, and box their asinine ears. However, as we must not say\
with Pope,\
"Let humble Alls*, with on awkward shame,\
Shave beards by stealth and blush to find it fame,"\
Mr. Punch makes the fine up to you by this piece of fame, well\
deserved by your remonstrance.\

NEW RAILWAY SIGNALS.\
(From the Code Qodsonian.)\
ome, 'now," said rthe\
Learned Judge to Mr.\
Godson, the Traffic Ma-\
nager of the South Western\
Railway 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  Company, who\
was giving such lucid evi-\
dence in the matter of the\
fatal accident at Egham\
Station, "Is that a serious\
answer? It really might\
be put into Punch."\
Whereupon Mb. Justice\
Punch, respecting the opi-\
nion thus expressed, and\
being perfectly agreeable\
to submit his will to his\
Willes, immediately com-\
municated with the S. W.,\
Traffic Master, offering to\
stand as Godfather to any\
clever contribution from\
Godson.\
Mr. Justice Punch has\
now much pleasure in sub-\
mitting to the public a set\
of entirely New Ruhjs and\
Regulations which are\
3 for the future guidance of the officials connected with the New Railway\
ilich, when opened, will be entitled, The N. S. E. W. Colwell Hatchney\
1. GENERAL SIGNALS.\
\
Blowing a Whistle.\
Blowing a Nose.\
Playing the Trombone.\
Waving your Hand gracefully.\
Waiving an Objection politely.\
Stirring the Fire with the Sugar-tongs.\
Imitating Hekr Von Joel on a Walking Stick.\
Winding up a Watch (Anybody's) the wrong\
way.\
(With Power to add to their Ifumbir.)\
As these general signals have no arbitrary signification, they may mean\
anything, everything, nothing, or something, wluch it will be the duty of the stoker,\
the engine-driver, the signalman, the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker,\
sitting in Committee on the top of a first class compartment, in an express\
train, to decide upon, and see carried out, even if accompanied with personal\
violence. (\
2. The persons employed on the Line shall be a tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,\
ploughboy, apothecary, thief. This will ensure due attention being paid to all\
classes of Her Majesty's subjects. Each one of these shall be empowered to give\
signals to any one else.\
3. Waving a black flag on a black dark night far away from any lifht, means danger.\
4. Standing on a Line on which the express train is just coming, means danger\
to one person. Two in the same position, means danger to more, and so on.\
TIME.\
1. The Trains on the New Line shall run every seven minutes, and in order to\
prevent confusion, fifteen minutes at least shall be allowed between the starting\
and departure of each Train.\
2. Every ten minutes, a plate-layer shall cross the line as a signal to the fireman\
that his dinner is ready.\
3. There shall be five minutes' difference between all the clocks at the several\
stations on the Line, so as to ensure the quickest train reaching its destination\
in no time, and to suit the requirements of BradshaVs Railway Ouide.\
4. The Company intend to run Trains just whenever they like, without reference\
to any stated times, which are only a source of nuisance, and unnecessary excite-\
ment to the travelling public. t|\
DUTIES OF SIGNALMAN.\
The' Bed Flag. The Signalman may wave the Red Elag, whenever he feels\
elated or excited, as a sign of his jollity and happiness.\
Red and Blue Flags. To be waved as a sign that it is a Director's birthday.\
Waving a White Flag Violently. Means "Hooray!" "Three cheers," &c, or\
anything of that sort.\
The Red Light shall mean "Stop!" except when it means "Go on!"\
The Blue, vice versa.\
The Qreen shall mean nothing.\
The Yellow anything.\
General Rules.\'97Blue on yellow, Red's your player in hand. As at Pool, so here,\
the aim of the Company is to fill the Pockets, and " lives" are lost at this game.\
THE GUARDS.\
Every Guard shall carry a Red light, a Blue light, a Bengal light and a box\
of Child's Night Lights. He shall also l>e light-headed. He will also be provided\
with as many flags as M. Robin used to produce out of an ordinary hat; besides the\
Standards of all Nations. He shall also carry all the Act*\
of Parliament affecting Railways, and a book containing\
Lines from different Poels, and a short history of the Seven\
Sleepers. He must know the current number of Bradshaur j\
by heart.\
NOTICE.\
The Company will hold themselves responsible for \\\
nothing.\
CROQUET.\
This is the state at present of the game,\
Miss Smith's not had her turn: Miss Brown the same 7.\
Red, croqued, does for speedy vengeance call,\
While Green continues strking now the ball;\
This rule can't fail the losers to provoke,\
Viz., that a Croquet's followed by a stroke;\
Ofttimes, to Croquet helps you to a place,\
Which you would not have reached so soon; this case\
Was Jones's, for, at Hoop three, is the Green\
Where he could not, without Red's help, have been;\
Thus selfishly ambitious worldlings play,\
Clinging to who will help them on their way,\
Whom, being used, they will, at the first chance,\
Croquet away, and thus themselves advance.\
At the third Hoop now Green prepares to fire,\
With grim delight Red views him strike the wire,\
And better luck next time," cries Red, "old fellow!"\
"Show him no quarter, but be careful, Yellow."\
This to Brunette, who makes the first and second,\
Then Roquets Green, on which she had not reckoned,\
Then Croquets him away, not very far,\
While Robinson exclaims, "Green, there you are!"\
As through the third Hoop goes Brunette \'95 the two\
Foes eye each other, "Now the fourth she '11 do."\
Right through again! all are astonished; she\
Is more amazed than any of the three.\
The fifth, at her next stroke she cannot do;\
Hoop five, to four, is, as was- three to two;\
The last but one before the turning post\
Is number five, which she, as 'twere, may coast;\
So for this neutral Port does Yellow steer,\
Placing herself the wished-for haven near.\
xvin.\
N .B. You mayn't, howe'er its place entice,\
The same ball Croquet in your one turn twice,\
'Tis as immutable as Median laws.\
But yet to this there is a saving clause:\'97\
If twice you'd have a ball your Croquet take,\
Between the strokes, your Hoop, in order, make.\
Yellow, Green Croqued, can't th' assault anew\
Repeat, till she her proper Hoop's gone through -\
When through the Hoop that's next, the Yellow s been,\
Naught hinders but she can re-Croquet Green.\
Observe, my friends, the fourth stroke that Jones\
Was viciously, not well, or wisely played.\
When Green drove Red as far away from sight\
As possible, he did it out of spite:\
He should nave Croquetted Hed that't might arrive\
Where it would help him on through number five;\
Before which, meeting him, with well-aimed thwack,\
He'd send him to Hoop nine, till he came back;\
And so on: thus the Second player may\
At once make all the Hoops by skilful play.\
Without a purpose Croquet not a ball:\
Or really play, or do not play at all.\
Ladies, at Croquet I'd not have much talking,\
Some chatter from a spiteful love of baulking.\
The silent player plans a careful game,\
And shoots the careless with a surer aim.\
Thankful for Small Mercies.\
The Irish are certainly the oddest birds out. Thai\
collection of "Martyrs of Circumstance," the Avonmore\
Lot, has been ringing bells, drinking healths, and making\
speeches at an Irish place called Belleisle. all for ioy\
because the House of Lords has solemnly declared that\
Lord Avonmore's son, Major Yelverton, was not to be\
believed. We don't see much in that declaration to cause\
either astonishment or jubilation. However, the " Siege of\
Belleisle" is not raised yet.\

Second Manly Voice. "Yes;\'97Nice Breeze, so Refreshin' after the 'bated Hatmosphebe of the Metropolis!!"\
[And Laura was properly Chaffed by her Younger Sister; who took stock of the Speakers.\
THE OLD, OLD STORY.\
\{Respectfully Dedicated to Small German Princes in general.) ,\
There is an ancient fable tbat everybody knows,\
Wbose truth and point come closer home the older that one grows.\
It is as young as yesterday, ancient as Homer's times:\
Its moral's seen in action in all ages, ranks and climes.\
A cat once with a monkey lived in Bund, if not in Bond,\
Which Puss\'97or Pruss let's call her\'97was of roasted chesnuts fond;\
But on these toothsome fruits while she was fain to close her jaws,\
She had a wholesome horror of singed hair and toasted paws. ,\
One day Miss Pruss, much meditant upon her favourite Diet,\
Long o'er her claws in velvet sheathed with closed lids bad sat quiet;\
Sudden her green eye twinkled; she rose, purred sweet on Pug,\
And closed her soft fur round him in an electric hug.\
Now this monkey was, at some points, an exception to his kind;\
Neither lecherous, nor yet treacherous, nor to mischief much inclined:\
Bumptious be was: went with his nose in air and tail tight-curled:\
Chattered: laid down the law\'97in short, a monkey of the world\'97\
But on the whole a kindly, inoffensive little Pug,\
Quite contented in a mirror to gloat on his own mug,\
If kept out of the way of edge-tools, gun-powder, fire,\'97\
Things Pugs always come to grief with, and so most to them aspire.\
But whether 'twas the thrilling of Miss Pruss's fiery fur,\
Or the seductive whisper of her insidious purr,\
Certain it is, Pug's passions seemed to take a sudden start,\
And Miss Pruss's crave for chesnuts flashed through his bttle heart.\
"Chesnuts!" mewed Puss. "Roast-chesnuts! Duchy chesnuts! or\
I die-"\
And " Chesnuts! Duchy chesnuts!" chattered Pug, "or so do I."\
"'Tis I will bght the fire," quoth Puss, "and all the world I vouch\
That 'tis not for myself I roast, but that Pug may fill his pouch."\
Then Pug clawed Puss in gratitude, and Puss purred sweet on\
Pag; , J\
The fire was made, the chesnuts kid in the ashes, smooth and snug;\
They hissed, spat, sweated, shrivelled, split, while Pug and Puss, safe\
posted,\
Watched their various ways of showing their objections to being roasted.\
"They 're done!" quoth Puss, "How savoury they smell! but, Pug,\
I say,\
We mustn't let 'em roast too long, or they '11 roast all away.\
Now to extract the dainties from the fire's hungry maw!"\
"Don't burn yourself!" quoth Pug. Quoth Puss: "Oh no\'97I'll\
use your paw!"\
So said, so done: ere simple Pug could argue, plan, inquire,\
His luckless paw was into, and the nuts out of, the fire.\
You may see him chafing, chattering, wringing bis blistered paw,\
While Puss nibbles up the chesnuts, and bids Pug "hold his jaw."\
MORAL.\
The moral's the important point; if in our adaptation\
We.'ve reversed the actors' functions, excuse the alteration.\
Our Puss we've made the artful one, our Pug the tool eximious,\
As Bismarck fits the feline part, the smaller powers the sinuous.\
"I Deny your Major."\'97Faitiaff.\
Dod's Peerage says that Major Yelverton is connected with the\
houses of Sayers and of Walker. There is a class of sayers whose\
sayings make many people say " Walker!" but we did not expect such\
rudeness from the House of Lords.\

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
WHALLEY THE WISE.\
Mb. G. H. Whalley has lost no time in giving an account of bis\
Parliamentary Stewardship to the intelligent electors of Peterborough,\
who do themselves so much honour, and so thoroughly vindicate their\
title to the franchise, by returning that determined enemy of Popery.\
We regret that we can find room only for a portion of his admirable\
address to his constituents.\
Mb. Whalley, after a sketch of the past Session, and references to\
his introduction of a protest against the Church of Rome on the Third\
Beading of every Railway Bill and other domestic measure, proceeded:\
"I shall continue this coarse. 1 am asked what Popery has to do with\
railways? I answer, Everything. I know that nearly every station-\
master is a Jesuit in disguise, and some day when there is a Roman\
Catholic rebellion, and troops are wanted, the lines will be blocked, and\
probably collisions will be arranged for the destruction of the Queen's\
soldiers. The Jesuits are everywhere. Do you know why the Nelson\
Column is not complete? Because Popery obstructs homage to the\
victor of Roman Catholic fleets, and Sm Edwin Landseeb has been\
converted. (Cheers.) Do you know that the Lobd. Chancellor of\
England, in utter defiance of the law that the keeper of the Queen's\
conscience shall have no Popish leanings, has favoured the interests of\
Mrs. Yelvebton? Why? Because that lady is a Catholic. \{Sensation.)\
Do you know that the Queen op Spain has ordered a statue to\
Columbus? WhyP Because the Emperob op the French has\
founded a new Catholic empire in America, and that in ten years\
Federals and Confederates will lie at the feet of the Pope. Gentlemen.\
1 have often felt pangs of conscience at representing a borough called\
after St. Peter, and I do wish you would change the name of your town.\
\{Cheers.) Are you aware that in the heart of London, in front of the\
most magnificent railway terminus we have, is rising a beautiful and\
costly copy of an Eleanors Cross, the superstitious monument erected\
by a Popish king P Do yon know that the conductor of the music at\
our noblest opera-house, (visited I am sorry to say by the Heir to the\
Throne) is M Costa, a Catholic, and that he has got a dispensation for\
leading the Huguenots and the National Anthem P Have you heard\
that Earl Russell, the pretended enemy of Popery, is going to bring\
in a Bill' for restoring to his relative's property its old Popish name of\
Convent Garden? You knew, gentlemen, that the London General\
Omnibus Company was a foreign speculation, but do you know that all\
the conductors are Jesuit priests, that they charge naif fares to pas-\
sengers who cross themselves, and misdirect to Catholic chapels those\
who inquire the way to Protestant places of worship. (Shame.) Yes,\
gentlemen, and can you hear with patience that a Catholic Tract Society\
has obtained leave from Mr. Panizzi, of the British Museum, to insert\
a tract in every volume of the Library? Does Mb. Panizzi's name\
remind you of England or of Italy? Was there a word, gentlemen, in\
the Queen's Speech last week, to remind us that the Sovereign is a\
Protestant P Not one. But the Queen was made to go out of her way\
to express satisfaction that she is on good terms with the Empebob op\
China. Who'cares for the Emperor op China in himself? But what\
so-called Christian religionists have had for hundreds of years the\
freatest sway in the Chinese Empire\'97who have been tolerated when\
'rotestants have been excluded? Why, the Jesuits. (Cheers.) Again,\
do you note that it is made matter of boast that the French ana English\
are drawing into closer alliance, Catholic with Protestant? (Cheers.)\
Ay, you cheer, but that is not all. Who is our friend's friend? Who,\
at this moment of the increased amity is about to visit the Tuileries?\
The King op Spain. Does that anti-Protestant bigot come for nothing?\
Will Lobd Cowley see him? We live in awful and perilous times,\
gentlemen. I know for a fact that there were hundreds of Catholics\
among the Riflemen at Wimbledon, and that if one of them had been\
the best marksman of the meeting, Lady Elcho would have unhesi-\
tatingly presented him with the Queen's Prize. (Sensation.) Yes, and\
how soon would that silver vase have become the ornament of a Popish\
mass-house? It was providential that it fell to Mb. Wyatt, who is a\
Protestant, but no thanks to the authorities. Why have passports\
just been so universally abolished on the Continent? In order to\
entrap Englishmen and Englishwomen into Catholic countries in order\
to promote proselytism P Why has the cross on St. Paul's just been\
ostentatiously and splendidly regilt? Look at that. And why is a\
magnificent bridge being constructed, at vast expense, at Blackfriars\'97\
ana observe that Popish name, gentlemen. Because Blackfriars Bridge\
will open a tempting and delightful road from mid-London to Cardinal\
Wiseman's Popish cathedral, St. George's. Lastly, gentlemen, though\
I could give you a hundred similarly alarming demonstrations, hear this.\
You have heard of Mb. Banting. His system is artfully promulgated\
all over the country. It is pretended that he merely desires to reduce\
the over-corpulent. Bah! He is a Jesuit priest, and his object is to\
introduce and make popular the Popish practice of regular Easting.\
Yes, gentlemen, I repeat that we live in perilous times, and the Triple\
Crown will soon dominate the Three Kingdoms."\
Mb. Whalley sat down amidst loud cheers and passionate cries of\
"No Popery!"\

having kindly abstained from punching my head In the presence of females at\
tho Music Hall on Saturday night, for saying In an unguarded instant that you was\
no gentleman, I humbly recal that objectionable sentiment, which was only\
prompted by the heat of the moment, and of the room, and of the Iced lemonade,\
and by your shoving me off my seat, and calling me a dirty little snob, and 1 regret\
using expressions as are derogatory, and you may publish this.\

THE NAGGLETONS UPON HOME.\
The happy couple are at Breakfast in their house in the fashionable locality\
in which we had last the pleasure of meeting them. Mr. Naggleton\
is, of course, reading his "Times." Mks. Naggleton has received\
some letters by the morning post, and has been meditating on their\
contents.\
Mrs. Naggleton. Henry, this is the Eirst of August.\
Mr. Naggleton \{without looking up). Maria, your chronology is indis-\
putable. Moreover, I wish you many happy returns of the day.\
Mrs. N. Good feeling would dictate your avoiding a joke on that\
subject, Henby.\
Mr. N. \{conscious). O, isn't it your birthday, my dear? But that is\
no reason why I should not wish you a happy return of the day, or of\
any day.\
Mrs. N. Happiness is a word for persons who are differently circum-\
stanced from myself, Henry, but I am making no complaint. I merely\
reminded you that this is the first of August.\
Mr. N. (prepares to receive cavalry). 1 had already learned that fact\
from the newspaper.\
Mrs. N. You may learn something else from it, I dare say, and be\
told that everybody but ourselves is out of town.\
Mr. N. If there is such a personal statement, my dear, I shall come\
to it presently, and I will then consider whether I ought to call the\
editor to account.\
Mrs. N. I think, Henry, that by this time you have known me quite\
long enough\
Mr. N. My dear, I am incapable of admitting anything so rude.\
Mrs. N. \{emphatically). Quite long enough to be aware that nonsense\
may delay what I may wish to say, but cannot prevent it.\
Mr. N. Have I ever refused my tribute to your pertinacity, my dear\
Maria? What do you wish to say now?\
Mrs. N. What it would not have been necessary for me to say, if I\
had had a different husband.\
Mr. N. Well, you have an indifferent one. Agreed. Go on.\
Mrs. N. Indifferent, indeed, Henry. Indifferent to the state of my\
health, and that of his children.\
ibfr. N. Agreed, again. How hard he tried to get you from Mrs.\
Owleybird's party on Friday, when morning was dawning. And how\
pleasantly he handed Dr. Peter Grievous a cheque for thirty-seven\
pounds on Saturday for medical attendance. Your husband is all that\
is objectionable, but make the best of him while he lasts.\
Mrs. N. \{mildly). It is, I am sure, as much for your own sake as\
mine that I wish, if we are to visit the Continent, that we should not\
delay until the season becomes unhealthy.\
Mr. N. But suppose we are not to visit the Continent. Who's the\
Continent, that we owe him so much attention?\
Mrs. N. O, go to Southend, if you like, or stay at home, and shut\
the front shutters. I don't care.\
Mr. N. Very well, my dear. As that is the case, I will consider\
those two excellent suggestions. At first blush I seem to prefer the\
shutters.\
Mrs. N. Is this the way in which we ought to converse, Henst r I\
am sure that I hear nothing like it between other couples. Me.\
Winkxetop can be playful in answering his wife, but it is affectionate\
fun.\
Mr. N. Playful darlings!\
Mrs. N. And though Mr. and Mrs. Gough-Hawe are always\
laughing, they understand one another, and she has no wish ungratified.\
But you are always in an attitude of fighting and resistance.\
Mr. N. Ajax defying the lightning; eh? Am I so ferocious? Well,\
look on me as another classical sculpture, the Dying Gladiator; and now,\
what can I do for you before I die r\
Mrs. N. Ah! Those allusions remind me of what would indeed make\
me happy. But it is of no use talking.\
Mr. N. Never mind that. Talk. What is it F Do you want to go\
to M. Brucciani's new gallery, and see his casts f\
Mrs. N. Shall I ever see Rome? Here is a letter from Mrs. Bosses,\
who is there, and who writes in perfect raptures of its treasures of art\
and of antiquity.\
Mr. N. Mrs. Bosser? No, no, Maria. Come.\
Mrs. N. There is her letter. \{Throws it to him.)\
Mr. N. No, thank you. Lord Palmerston says he has had no\
time for twenty years to read anything but manuscript. I prefer print,\
not being eighty. But Mrs. Bosser. I think it was that eminent\
lover of art who told us Landseer's dogs were clever, but not equal to\
those of Animal Carracci, and I am sure it was that eminent anti-\
quarian who told us that Hereford Cathedral was being restored in the\
Renaissance style.\
Mrs. N. Your spiteful memory supplies an argument against yon.\
We go abroad to learn.\
Mr. N. Some of us, like" yourself, my dear Maria, have nothing to\
learn, except how to stay at home.\
Mrs. N. I am too painfully conscious of my own deficiencies to\
accept an insincere compliment dictated by a mean economy.\
Mr. N. (enraged). Then I would avoid exposing those deficiencies\
to fellow-travellers, as you would do in a place like Rome.\
Mrs. N. (gently). There was a time, Henry, when you pretended to\
take pleasure in showing new objects to your wife, and making her\
enjoy them by your clever explanations, and the information that you\
have so curiously acquired.\
Mr. N. (hit, but staggering up). There is nothing curious in it. I\
have endeavoured to read books, and I have tried to remember what\
was in them.\
Mrs. N. Men's minds are so much better trained than ours, and you\
I earn to apply your knowledge at a moment's notice. I know nothing\

more delightful to a wife than to be able to turn to her husband for\
anything she wants to know, and I am sure that if you and I could see\
Rome together, it would be something to remember all our lives.\
Mr. N. (moved). My dear, I am a humble but faithful adherent to\
the Church of England as by Law Established. What could I say to\
myself, if your Protestant principles should be sapped by the Scarlet\
Lady, and you should seek refuge in a convent?\
Mrs. N. (playfully). I took the veil once, my love, and my courage\
has not been so very well rewarded that I am inclined to try again; so\
do not be afraid, or perhaps I should say, have no hopes.\
Mr. N. Well, but look here now. Another year 1 would not object.\
But we are too late for Rome this year.\
Mrs. N. We can never be too late for the Eternal City. Mrs.\
Bosser is enchanted with it.\
Mr. N. The Eternal City and Widow Bosses. "Powers eternal,\
such names mingled." Really, Mama, the idea of a woman of your\
intellectual power being led by that idiot, at whom you used to be always\
laughing.\
Mrs. N.lsxa. not led by her, Henry.\
Mr. N. (artfully). Yes, you are; and I cannot understand the ascen-\
dency she has acquired over you. Even Snotchley, the milk-and-\
honey boy, has remarked that you dress at her, repeat her foolish sayings,\
and surrender your own judgment to hers.\
Mrs. N. If you permit another person to make disparaging remarks\
to you about your own wife, I say no more.\
Mr. N. But I did not permit it. The words were hardly out of his\
mouth when I gave him my mind on his impertinence, and he will not\
repeat it; but, to do him justice, he apologised by urging that he only\
noticed what everybody else said, wondering at your humility.\
Mrs. N. That settles the question.\
Mr. N. And you will not give further cause for such tattle by\
following Mrs. Bosses to Rome at her bidding.\
Mrs. N. I will go to Rome to show how utterly I despise tattlers\
and backbiters.\
Mr. N. (hoist with his own petard). I do not quite see it in that light.\
Mrs. N. If you have the spirit of a man, you will. And I will write\
to Mr. Snotchley this very morning, and tell him among other things,\
that while Mrs. Snotchley owes me for the very shawl in which she\
came to my party\
Mr. N. \{mildly, seeing a door of deliverance). What shawl, my dear?\
Mrs. N (indignantly). What shawl? Have men no eyes? Did you\
not put it on her great shoulders yourself, and quote something\
ridiculous about not displaying her beauties to the moon.\
Mr. N. (quietly). I understood you to say it was your shawl, my\
e one I gave you on your\'97birthday? (With meaning.)\
I Mrs. N. (within). I did not think I should get him even to Paris; but\
there's nothing like asking for more than you want. That is safe, and\
I love Paris. I wonder whether Mr. Snotchley did'say a word of all\
that. I will call and lunch there, and perhaps she will pay me. Lucky\
I did not tell him that I had sold the shawl to her at half-price.\
dear. Theone\
I never liked it, as you know,\
Mr. N. You told me it was sweet.\
Mrs. N. I didn't\'97or I hadn't tried it on\'97or one changes one's mind.\
At least she said she liked it, and I let her have it at the price you said\
it cost, and she owes me the money.\
Mr. N. (to himself). Not a bad bargain for us, if she pays that, and\
takes a year's credit. Maria, I don't like this.\
Mrs. N. Don't like what?\
Mr. N. I say nothing about ladies selling things\'97I suppose you have\
your own code of high manners. But I made you a present on your\
birthday, and you pretend to be delighted with it, and then you sell it.\
I shall remember that.\
Mrs. N. No doubt you will. It will be an admirable excuse for\
stinginess for the rest of your life.\
Mr. N. I have never been stingy, and you have no right to say so.\
Mrs. N. I shall say what I like.\
Mr. N. Still, at your time of life, you should set your children an\
example of speaking the truth.\
Mrs. N.Sol do.\
Mr. N. I deny it. And I repeat that you did not do a wife-like act\
in parting with a present of mine.\
Mrs. N. A wonderful present, certainly, to make a fuss about. And\
I am not a child, or a slave, to have a thing given me on condition I\
always watch over it, and never lose it.\
Mr. N. If your temper had been given you on those conditions, my\
dear, I fear you would be without one. I am glad to find that you\
are not.\
Mrs. N. (suddenly changing from volcano to iceberg). Will you buy a\
Continental Bradshate to-day, and ascertain about tne route to Italy?\
Mr. N. (solemnly). I will not. No, Maria. Every walk we might\
take in Rome would remind me of this painful disclosure. As you have\
said, the Eternal City would be an eternal memory. The Tarpeian\
Rock would recal domestic treachery. The Via Sacra would show me\
Mrs. Snotchle y goin\'a7 to church in my shawl. Bitter thoughts would\
have a long Triumph in the Forum; and the inevitable ball at the\
banker's would make me think of the cheque Snotchley owes. South-\

TESTIMONIAL TO LORD PALMERSTON.\
A Most flattering Testimonial has been rendered to Lobd Palmer-\
ston by certain agents of a Power whose opinion of any British\
Government is a safe test of the strength or weakness, as well as of\
the merits of its foreign policy. Mr. Gaskell, the Member for Wen-\
lock, has addressed a letter to a local journal, in answer to an accusa-\
tion which it had brought against him of cowardice in not having voted\
with the so-called Conservatives in the division on Mr. Disraeli's\
Vote of Censure, for which the House of Commons substituted a Vote\
of Confidence. Ma. Gaskell says:\'97\
111 did not support the Government because I disapproved of the course which\
they pursued on the Danish question. I did not vote with the Opposition because\
I could not affirm, with them, that I thought England had been degraded. More-\
over, it was not my wish to see Lord Palmerston displaced. Foreign ecclesiastics,\
then recently arrived in London, and other declared and determined enemies to\
constitutional freedom, were then endeavouring to effect his downfall. For that, if\
for no other reason, I should have declined to Join in the vote of censuro."\
Hear, electors of Wenlock, hear your Member. Here is a real Con-\
servative for you; free and independent electors of Wenlock, make\
much of him. Mr. Gaskell is one of those true Conservatives who\
want to conserve constitutional liberty at home and encourage it abroad,\
and whose sole object is not simply that of conserving place when they\
can get it. He knows the value of a statesman whose downfall is\
eagerly desired by his Holiness the Pope, who sends over foreign eccle-\
siastics to endeavour to effect it, which they can only do by employing\
spiritual persuasion or intimidation to enlist Roman Catholics on the\
side of that party which includes Mr. Newdegate. In endeavouring\
to effect the downfall of Lohd Palmerston, those foreign ecclesiastics\
do him not only the greatest honour that they can, but also the greatest\
service. They dispel the fancyor refute the pretence that England is\
losing influence in Europe. We may be sure that England has plenty\
of influence in Europe so long as we see the emissaries of the Pope\
hard at work endeavouring to effect the downfall of the Minister who\
wields it. We are, moreover, sure that he wields it aright. "Vote for\
Lord Palmerston and Constitutional Freedom at home and abroad ! *\
That will now be the Liberal and truly Conservative cry at every\
election. That of the party whom the Opposition leaders lead by the\
nose, will, to express what is really their only distinctive policy, be\
"Derby:, Disraeli, and Pio Nono the Popb King for Ever!"\
Much good may it do them!\
RACES WITHOUT HORSES.\
Mr. Punch has been favoured with a copy of the Rules and Regu-\
lations issued "by permission of Major-General Ridley" for the\
giidance of the managers of the races at the Camp, Curragh, Ireland,\
ad the gallant Major-General been Old Bob Ridley, we should not\
have been surprised at any bit of fun like the penultimate rule, which is\
this:\'97\
"The horKt are to be at the post precisely at the advertised times, or the races *iU\

knot of English officers. Perhaps, however, they are acclimatised.\

Mrs. N. The Baltimores go on Thursday, and that's why I want to\
see them, but it is so like you to shelter yourself behind a mean catch.\
Mr. N. Your image is rather confused, my dear, and savoureth less\
of your favourite, Dante, than of your favourite, Dundreary. Shel-\
tering behind a catch would be difficult, even to an expert cricketer.\
Mrs. N. Trash!\
Mr. N. \{struggling to be civil, but not esaetly succeeding). True. But\
King Solomon has told us to answer a\'97wise person according to his\
wisdom.\
Mrs. N. I don't believe there's another man in London calling: him-\
self a gentleman who would allow people to leave ridiculous messages\
at his door to make a servant grin when she delivers them.\
Mr. N. I have already given you my opinion on that kind of message,\
so we need not re-open the subject. If you like, I will leave you at\
Baltimore's and call for you in an hour and a half.\
Mrs. N. I shall do no such thing.\
Mr. N. I said what / would do, my dear, if you liked.\
Mrs. N. Certainly, that you may go to some low haunt or other with\
Mr. Waring, and come back to the Baltimorks in a state of vulgar\
excitement.\
Mr. N. Serene in good intent, Maria, I defy that taunt. We are\
going to see a nobleman, a real nobleman, my dear, and to listen to tas\
aristocratic and improving conversation for the time I have mentioned.\
Mrs. N. Asii any nobleman would receive Mr. Waring and you!\
Mr. N. I am soins by the divine creature's express invitation, not to\
say command, Mrs. Naggleton. Now!\
Mrs. N. I will believe tluit when I see it.\
Mr. N. Duly thanking you for your wifely confidence and respect, I\
will at once permit you to see it. There!\
[He gives her a note, in which he is informed by the'Adjutant of the\
Westbourne Volunteers that they are to eome to drill that\
at Eight, when the Colonel, Lord Silveetongue, will be\
present.\
Mrs. N. \{having read it with that contemptuous haste so delightful in\
woman). I did not think that you were such a Tool. You must excuse\
the word. I know no better one.\
Mr. N. \{in a white rage). Well, that is an excuse, I admit. And I\
deserve the word, for\'97for several reasons, one being before my face.\
However, there are limits to everything. \{Rises.) I will send up your\
cheque from wherever I may be to-morrow. Good evening.\
Mrs. N. \{thinking of the Paris trip). Now, Henry, is not that\
cowardly, and just like a man? A wife does not exactly see the\
rationality of something he is doing, and instead of defending it, he runs\
away, at a time of year too when she is without a soul to speak to.\
Mr. N. She had better speak to her own soul, at least to her con-\
science, and ask what she deserves.\
Mrs. JV. I was wrong. There! But I have been far from well all\
day, and you startled me so with the sudden paper that I did not know\
what I said. How can you be so cross?\
Mr. N. Cross is not the word.\
Mrs. N. Haven't I begged your pardon? But why could you not\
tell me that you were going to be a Volunteer.\
Mr. N. I had planned what I foolishly thought would be a pleasant\
little surprise for you and the children when 1 came down in the uni-\
form. But I ought to have known how little I could calculate upon\
your abominable temper.\
Mrs. tf. And if my temper is not quite what it was, what has spoiled\
it but the trials of my married life? And you ought therefore to be the\
last person to revile me for it.\
Mr. N. You say what is perfectly untrue, and no woman ever had less\
to complain of.\
Mrs. N. Ah! You little know what people say.\
Mr. N. And I care as little.\
Mrs. N. \{has a capital rejoinder, and if she were only in Paris !\'97hut as\
it is only says). Mv dear Henry, do not set the strength of your mind\
against mine. Allow me a woman's privilege to be unreasonable. And\
come, if I let you go to Lord Silvertongue, will you promise not to\
be later than ten?\
Mr. N. If I am, tell the servant to go round for you.\
Mrs. N. Now that's unkind, after what I have said.\
Mr. N. After what you have said, I don't think so.\
Mrs. N. Yes, it is. Go and learn your drill,\'97I suppose that was\
what Mr. Waring meant by grill\'97and make friends with Lord\
Silvertongue, and ask him to come and see us.\
Mr. N. Not very likely that he will.\
Mrs. N. I don't know why. It is a fine noble family, certainly, but\
he is only the second peer, and his grandfather made his fortune by\
honourable commerce, just as you have done. _ Where is the wonderful\
difference between you?\
Mr. N. \{utterly subdued). You wicked radical, you; I wonder\
fat Peerage there, which you study so hard, doesn't explode aud b!\
you away.\
Mrs. N. I respect the aristocracy, dear, but to depieeiate the great\
middle class would ill become the wife of a mercantile man\
Mr. N. \{but not spitefully). Or the niece of a celebrated acc\
Mrs. N. Henry!\
Mr. N. Acclimatiser of infant'aristocrats.\
Mrs. K \{thoughtfully). Do you know that I flunk poor Uncle would\
have liked to be called that? He was fond of sonoroas expressions.\
Mr. Jf. \{laughing). The taste is hereditary.\
Mrs. Jf. \{see* the Tuileries). Don't .begui scolding' me agaia. You\
might invite me to come and see you\'97grilled, Ot I must tell that to\
the children.\
Mr. Jf. \{uneasily). Well, yes, certainly, but vtw had better wait until\
the Corps is a little more perfect in certain exercise*\
Mrs. If. \{innocently). Such as the goose-step, dear? I think I ihave\
heard of that manoeuvre.\
Mr. If. That ia\'97they call it the balance-step without gaining' ground\
\'97that is an early accomplishment.\
Mrs. Jf. Show me how you do it; do, dear?\
Mr. Jf. (rather red). Nevermind now. I will smother time. Now\
ifa vim wish me to go with you to the Baitimores?\
Mr*. Jf. Of course I do. They are going to Brussels, which m only\
a little Paris, after all, I believe, and I want you to say to them, care-\
lessly, ia your humorous way, that a little Paris is not big enoagh fur\
us, and that we are going to the great one.\
Mr. . V. Bat we are not.\
Mr*. Jf. O yea, dear, we are. Ton know you promised that, and you\
never go back from your word to me. You promised mc faithfully.\
Mr. Jf. Bad faghah.\
Mrs. Jf. Then well mead it with good French. Was not that clever,\
Mr. Hkirt? And mind yem bring out what I tefl you neatly to the\
Baltiworks. I shall lead op to it, so look out. By the way, what\
was the large parcel Sarah spoke of?\
Mr. If. (slightly sheepishly). My uniform.\
Mrt. Jf. O, go and put. it on\'97you must, and you shall. I should like\
to see it of all things. Couldn't you fro to Paris in it?\
Mr. Jf. Certainly not.\
Mr*. Jf. I don't know why. The French are a military nation, and\
would take it as a compliment.\
Mr. Jf. I have no desire to compliment the French nation.\
Mrs. If. But you have a desire to compliment me. Go up and put the\
uniform on, and knock at the children's door and tell them to come\
down. Then we '11 go to Mrs. Baltimore's. Would you mind having\
a cab, as I am rather tired?\
Mr. Jf. As yon like. Be ready at half-past seven.\
Mrs. Jf. All right. You are quite like the Duke or Wj\
already in your prompt orders. _'\
Mr. N. \{half grumbling). 1 wish I wasn't like him in has ,\
France.\
Mrs. Jf. Yes, I should think 1,'would have a cab. Fancy walking iu\
daylight with a man who has on a uniform for the first time! But I\
have clenched Paris. Men are very weak. If he had called me a fool,\
I would have made it Rome before I spoke to him again. But we\
must put up with them. Come in, darlings.\
Shakspearian.\
What proof exists that Prince Arthur, King John's nephew, possessed;\
a large stock of linen?\
Because Shakspeare, who was thoroughly blank-versed iu the\
history of that time, makes the unfortunate boy, when meditating a\
departure from England, say,\
"IU find a thousand shift! to got away."\
It is improbable that these were his grandam's. They were subsequently\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
GRAND HOTELS,\
AND THE MUCH-ADO-ABOUT-NOTHING SYSTEM.\
\
Vast improvement has\
been lately introduced\
in the building of our\
Large Hotels. New\
systems of Management\
are being tried at some\
of the Grandest of the\
Grand Hotels. The\
following Rules appear\
to be in experimental\
working at the mag-\
nificent establishment\
recently erected, on one\
of the most command-\
ing sites, opposite the\
fashionable parade of\
London-super-Mare:\'97\
Rule 1.\'97For keeping\
the accounts clear, and\
preventing either confu-\
sion on the part of Hie\
waiters, or disappoint-\
ment to the customer;\
and, further, for promo-\
ting civility in the serv-\
ants of the House.\
Probable Hypothesis;\
the customer gives an\
order to the waiter, in\
the Coffee Room. If\
this waiter be not the\
waiter officially author-\
ised to receive such\
order, then this waiter\
must inform the said\
customer, that he ought\
to address himself to\
another waiter, at the\
same time expressing\
his deep regret that he\
is prevented, by exist-\
ing regulations, from personally attending to the gentleman's wants.\
Hereupon, if there be time, he may apply his napkin to his eye, inti-\
mating thereby that he is affected even unto tears. He may then,\
unless otherwise engaged -at his own special table, proceed in search\
of the required waiter.\
Rule 2.\'97When the customer gives his order to the right waiter in\
the right place. The waiter so addressed shall say, "Yes, Sir," slowly\
and .distinctly, shall not move any glasses from any table for no particu-\
lar purpose, shall not dust a clean table-cloth with his napkin, nor shall\
he go to the side-board fox the sake of touching the green glass con-\
taining toothpicks, whence ordinary waiters generally appear to derive\
fresh strength and energy, as did Some-one-seus from his native earth;\
but, eschewing such unnecessary trifling, shall at once proceed on his\
mission in the manner following:\'97\
Given. The order for a glass of sherry and soda-water.\
Observe. Here be two ingredients for the one drink, and several\
things required.\
First, Sherry. Seoondly, A glass wherein to put it. Thirdly, A\
decent silver salver whereon to hand it. Fourthly, A bottle of soda-\
water. Fifthly, A large tumbler. Sixthly, A knife. Seventhly, A\
corkscrew (perhaps). Eighthly, A tray whereon to carry these last.\
Fully impressed with the magnitude of this commission, the waiter\
will walk thoughtfully to a corner of the room, where\'97\
Rule 3 \'97Shall be seated one matronly personage, attended by a\
damsel, whose joint business it shall be to receive the orders from the\
waiter, enter them in a book, and take the waiter's number before he\
leaves the room. (This plan has been adapted from that in use at the\
Railway Stations applied: to cab-drivers. The Committee of the New\
Grand Hotel are not above taking a hint.) It shall be the business of\
1 he damsel to prevent the matron from making wrong entries j and the\
matron shall keep a vigilant eye upon the movements of the damsel.\
Rule i.\'97Having seen that his surname, Christian name, number,\
and order, have been duly registered in the abovementioned book, the\
waiter shall then walk to a glass door, behind which shall be seated\
t hree clerks, to whom he shall communicate the wishes of the customer.\
One of these clerks shall enter the order in a large book, supervised by\
the two other clerks, who shall look over his shoulder; second clerk\
shall then enter it in a larger book, while the other two look over his\
shoulder, and so on with the third. During this time, the waiter shall\
look over his own shoulder; the left shoulder. He shall then receive a\
cheque for the sherry to the amount required; i.e., one glass.\
Rule 5.\'97The waiter shall then proceed to another glass door, where,\
after a similar ceremony, he shall receive another cheque for soda-water.\
(This prevents all confusion.)\
Rule 6.\'97He shall then get the order stamped by the maid at the\
bar; get the barmaid's stamp ratified by the head-waiter; get the head-\
waiter's ratification of the barmaid's stamp endorsed by the sub-manager;\
the sub-manager's endorsement warranted by the manager up one\
flight of stairs; the warranty of the manager up one flight of stairs,\
approved of by the assistant-under-secretary on the third landing; the\
assistant-under-secretary's approval of the manager's warranty signed\
by the under-secretary, third flight; such signature witnessed, by the\
secretary; the secretary's signature countersigned by the resident-\
director top story, [who shall telegraph particulars to the committee;\
then come down-stairs, with the copy of the telegram of particulars\
and the order-cheque, containing the resident-director's counter-sig-\
nature to the secretary's signature to the under-secretary's third\
flight approval of the assistant-under-secretary's signature to the\
manager s up one flight of stairs warranty of the sub-manager's en-\
dorsement ol the head-waiter's ratification to the barmaid's stamp to\
the cheque that the registered waiter had procured from one of the\
clerks behind the glass door in the Coffee Room.\
He shall then proceed to fetch the sherry.\
Rule 7.\'97The above will be carefully repeated for the Soda-water.\
Rule 8.\'97The barmaid shall then apply to the under-cellarman, who\
shall inform the cellarman, who shall notify the same to the master-\
cellarman, who sliall depute the sub-under-cellarman to give the bar-\
maid the required sherry.\
Rule 9.\'97So also for the soda-water; application to be made to the\
refrigerator-man, and so forth.\
Rule 10.\'97The waiter shall procure another waiter to assist him in\
bringing in the sherry on its salver, the soda-water on its tray, and the\
under-porter to open the Coffee Room door.\
Rule 11. (appended hereunto by the public). Having found the sherry\
and soda-water, the waiter will now proceed to find\'97the customer.\
PKOFESSIONAL LOVE SONG.\
THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT.\
I Know I mind the Surgery bell, and roll the frequent pills,\
I know I draw the paupers teeth, and cure their coughs wit h squills;\
While she\'97a banker's only child (J. P., D. L., Esquire),\
Is belle at all the County balls, and beauty of the shire.\
The diagnosis of my case the sympathetic know,\
That counter-irritant, the boy, has probed it long ago;\
He sees the flush, the start, the stare, when she goes riding by,\
And grins the while he idly spreads the lively Spanish fly.\
Good bye to " Watson" when the eye a sight of some one gets\'97\
The merest glimpse of Bella's nose nosology upsets:\
Or if dispensing and I hear her piebalds from the Park\'97\
The cooling lotions I neglect her lineaments to mark.\
I '11 go to Guy's, I '11 carve my way to surgical renown,\
I '11 five on pulse till I'm the boast of my natal market-town;\
And in this local print.\'97How now! some water, I'm unwell\'97\
The palpitation at my heart no stethescope can tell!\
"Match in High Life\'97on the lapis\'97and to come off in May,\
'Twixtthe lovely and accomplished Miss B. Blank and General J."\
'Tis well that boy is in the town delivering pills and doses, *\
Just let him mind his eye! I'm mad. He might get ecchymosis!\
Farewell the hope each Sunday brought that passing down the aisle,\
She might vouchsafe to gladden me with one phlogistic smile;\
Farewell the dream, that sitting by the Surgery fire was bliss,\
Of one day giving her the sweet emulsion of a kiss.\
There is no salve on all the shelves can mitigate my smart;\
Not all the College can reduce a fracture of the heart!\
As so my Donna Bella's going to become another's wife,\
Come, Belladonna, berry dear, and ease me of my life.\
Theatrical.\
An Energetic Provincial Manager advertises an Operatic, as well as\
a Dramatic and Ballet Company. He intends that this shall be, he\
says, a "Treble Company." Surely he will have some difficulty in\
ting Operas specially composed for a Treble Company. Where's\

WOMEN AND WALKING-STICKS.\
The statement that Eve once presented Adah with a little Cain,\
may perhaps, by a bad punster be considered a good answer when one\
is asked if walking-sticks may be esteemed to be of ancient date. But\
whether their antiquity be provable or no, it seems that Canes are more\
and more now coming into modern use: for the Empress of the\
French, has taken them in hand, and as Empress of the Fashions her\
influence is all-potent to make popular her taste. Eor the instruction\
of our lady readers, we copy what was lately said on this important\
point in a contemporary print:\'97\
"As the little cane has been seen In the hand of the Sovereign, all other young\
women have adopted it This cane is now made equal in value to a jewel, and u\
generally white\'97in pearl, ivory, or rhinoceros ivory, or in white wood, japanned\
and varnished, and all the art possessed by workers in ivory is lavished on this little\
object. The Chinese ivory cane is carved all over with pagodas, side by side with\
the inhabitants of Fekin; whilst those from Dieppe represent the knotted bark of\
a tree, and are ornamented with acorns in white silk or any bright colour. The\
head of the cano is engraved with the initials or crest, and often encrusted with\
turquoise or garnets."\
Some ladies stick at nothing in making themselves fashionable, so we\
can hardly be surprised to find them take to wearing sticks. Never-\
theless, a description of these ladies' canes, we think, is not superfluous,\
or cynics when they hear of a woman with a walking-stick, might\
imagine her resembling an old fairy in a pantomime, supported by a\
crutch. Now, if we were a young lady (and our figure is so slim and\
elegant that it were no great stretch of fancy to imagine that we were\
one), we should not like to be belikened to the Mothers Bunch and\
Goose, or to poor old Goody Two Shoes, and people of that sort. But a\
cane such as is above described, we should be sure that no old person\
would ever dream of carrying, excepting they were in a stage of second\
childhood, and could not take a walk without some plaything in their\
hand. A walking-stick of ivory "carved all over with pagodas and\
inhabitants of Pekin," is a sort of thing that nobody would carry for\
convenience, and its only point of usefulness would be that it might\
help the fortunes of the glove-makers, for with a very little handling, it\
certainly would play sad havoc with one's gloves. On this ground, we\
assuredly as father of a family, shall forbid our girls from following this\
fashion of the Empress, however great a tyrant they may think us for\
so doing. But all Papas have not their daughters under such control\
as we have, and in some cases perhaps, a compromise may be found\
needful, to prevent a flat refusal to obey Papa's behest. Here we would\
advise him, if he can, to make the bargain that if Julia and Emllt will\
persist in carrying canes, they will both abstain while doing so from\
buying parasols. More than half the ladies who carry parasols, do so\
when the sun has not the least idea of shining, and when therefore those\
articles are not of the least use to them. On sucb occasions, walking-\
canes would serve them just as well, and be cheaper in their wear and\
tear perhaps than parasols. An economic girl might, with a little\
ingenuity, convert her last year's parasol stick into a new walking one,\
ana so save Papa the cost of the ivory pagodas to which allusion has\
been made. But we fear it is not fashionable to be economic, and a\
young lady who would condescend to manufacture her own walking-\
stick, would probably have sense enough to walk without a stick at all.\

SEVERITY OF THE SCOTCH SUNDAY.\
E learn from the In-\
vergordon Times, that\
the other Saturday\
evening. Her Majes-\
ty's Ship Salami s.\
carrying the Com-\
missioners on Fish-\
eries and their for-\
tunes, having arrived\
at Invergordon:\'97\
"Those in command\
applied here to get on\
board supplies of pro-\
visions, on Sunday; but\
our merchants, much as\
they value the orders to\
supply Her Majesty's\
ships, and painful as it\
would be for them to\
see our gallant\
starve, respectfully\
dined to execute\
orders sooner than\
o'clock on the\
morning."\
Her Majesty\
might, in the exercise\
of ner royal preroga-\
tive, confer a merited\
distinction on the\
Sabbatarians of In-\
vergordon. She might command that the name of the port at which\
her ships were refused the supply of necessaries on a Sunday should be\
changed to Inverscribe, or Inverpharisee. But then the Scribes and\
Pharisees did understand the difference between the seventh day and\
the first, and, whilst observing their Sabbath to excess, really observed\
the Sabbath. The obstinate perversity of the Scotch mind on this point\
may be regarded as typified m the national emblem, the thistle, taken\
to signify the mental food of Scotchmen. Invergordon, for the future,\
had better be called Inverdonkie.\
\
CROQUET.\
XIX.\
Now, 'tis Miss Emmy's turn; she strikes the Blue,\
The first Hoop gains, but misses number two.\
Quoth timid Blue, "I am not playing well."\
While Green defines her failure as "a sell."\
"Ho!" from the farthest corner comes a shout\
Whence Croqued Robinson wouU fain get out;\
Then as the stricken rock by Old Tiler's sledge\
Baced with the wind, so now from edge to edge\
Plies the Bed ball; too strong the stroke for good,\
The Bed stops just eight feet past where it should\
By Green, to whom some time since it occurred\
To be by Yellow Croqued, Hoop the third\
Must now be gained: yet stay, Green can't go through,\
He can but " place himself." and voila (out.\
The fifth Hoop, unmolested, Yellow seeks\
Through that, then through the sixth and last she sneaks,\
The last, I mean, before the turning peg\
At which she aims, when Bed is heard to beg\
That she'll be cautious; some folks who would serve one\
With t\'bbooa advice, oft manage to unnerve one.\
Brur.ettc, "i know that I shan't do it," cried;\
Taen Yeilow luakfs, in cricket phrase, "a Wide."\
1 ilmy pretends, the cunning little soul.\
With, her dark foe's misfortune to condole,\
"Wnile quietly the second Hoop she makes,\
And on her backward road her partner takes,\
Whom she, with much more certainty than haste,\
Now Croquets, through the third, from where he's placed;\
Then following to the same propitious spot,\
Makes the fourth Hoop for both, a wondrous shot!\
In Blue-green breast see dying hope revive,\
Her place Blue takes for gaining number five,\
And first she '11, passive, serve her partner's need;\
Miss Emmy's play's been very good, indeed.\
xx.\
Still the Third Hoop invites the fretting Bed,\
He nearly reaches it: his luck has fled.\
Green runs to Blue, who Boqued, Croqued, flies\
Through the fifth Hoop, then near it soon Green lies,\
And passing through the sixth, his skill is such\
That ne the Turn-peg manages to touch.\
To hit the post again, then help his mate,\
His plan: the Yellow makes him hesitate:\
He strikes the post, returning, then one look\
At Yellow settles him j 'twill suit his book\
To Croquet her to Jericho, let's say;\
And Jones was right, it was the game to play.\
So first he Boqucts Yellow, and then whips\
His foot atop of Green, and then\'97he slips!\
His stroke is lost, and, such is fortune's whim,\
She, whom he came to Croquet, Croquets him.\
THE LAST STROKE.\
Much as I have described goes on the game:\
The play of course is never twice the same.\
When you, forestalling victory, shall march\
'Neath the last Hoop as your triumphal arch,\
Think not the work for honest hands is over,\
For till you hit the post you are "A Raver;"\
Which means, that you, though bound in turn to strike,\
May Croquet anyone just whea you like.\
Your mission is your slow-coach friends to seek,\
And like a true knight-errant help the weak.\
When to the post the winning-ball you send\
Where it began, your Croquet-life will end:\
With gentle blow thus terminates the game,\
And goes the mortal player whence he came.\
To'ards the marquee then let your steps be best;\
Let your Caprera be the Ladies' tent;\
With laurel-wreath the victor most be crowned,\
You 're sure to find some laurels, on the. ground;\
Though how to weave a wreath is not so plain,\
11\
L'BNVOI.\
A great deal more I might have said, indeed\
Have written volumes that "who run may read;"\
Volumes! if on this subject I'd penn'd one,\
Whoe'er should read, would yeey quickly run.\
Say, reader, have you ever tried to guess\
The weekly problems of the Game of Chess,\
Which, with a ground-plan of a board, my eye\
Have oft attracted? Aren't they monstrous dry?\
And so I found, (I thank Chess for the hint,)\
That Croquet's not a bit less dry\'97in print.\
"Red Croquets Blue, hits Yellow, moves to three,"\
It puzzles you? 'Egad, it's puzzled me.\
Lie there my Croquet-pen. The mallet I\
Henceforth will wield. A few words, then, good bye:\
We're told that Squeers, the Schoolmaster of York,,\
Had a queer mode of setting boys to work:\
Take the word "winder," when a boy had seen it,\
And spelt it, Squeers then sent him oil to clean it.\
Reader, spell Croquet. Good. In one word say it:\
That's good again. Now then, you go and play it. ,\
WHY AND BECAUSE.\
Dear Mr. Punch",\
The paragraphists say,\
"It is gratifying to observe the unanimous testimony of the Judges during the\
present assizes, that crime was never so low in Ireland as it is now."\
Crime is always low, in fact vulgar, whether committed in Ireland, or\
elsewhere, and I do not understand the Irish Judges. If they mean\
rare, why can't they say so? And if they do mean rare, I am rejoiced\
to hear of its rarity, and scorn to hint that the population of Ireland\
was never so scanty as it is now. Why do black sheep eat so much\
less than white ones? Because the black are much the fewer.\

THE IRREMOVABLE DEPOSIT JOINT STOCK\
BANKING COMPANY.\
This Company has been established to meet a pressing\
want, which has been long severely felt by persons of genteel\
but somewhat slender means, as well as by the members of\
the poorer classes. It will afford a safe, and at the same\
time a permanent investment for all sums, however small,\
which 'are entrusted to its keeping, and on which a very\
liberal rate of interest will be guaranteed. In fact, the\
principal intention of this Deposit Company, is to retain\
whatever principal may chance to be confided, to it, and out\
of this to pay as high a, rate of interest as the managers\
may find it to their interest to allow.\
The Government have taken great credit to themselves\
for the Act which they have passed for granting Govern-\
ment Annuities, and have also plumed themselves upon the\
notable success of the Post Official Savings Banks, esta-\
blished not long since. Both these measures were intended\
to induce the poor to save, and lay up money for old age,\
receiving or accumulating interest by their doing so.\
There is this defect, however, in all Government invest-\
ments, that the money which is put in them, will be paid\
out at any moment when the owners may apply for it.\
Now in the Irremovable Deposit Company, this evil will\
be stopped, for nobody will be permitted to withdraw above\
a quarter of the money he may place in it. Depositors will\
thus be saved from the temptation of drawing out their\
savings on some frivolous pretence, such as sickness, emi-\
gration, or protracted want of work. Moreover, though\
they cannot spend their own money themselves, they will at\
any rate continue to possess the satisfaction of knowing it\
is standing to their credit at the Bank, until the Bank\
Directors may think proper to make use of it.\
For further particulars and terms as to obtaining a place\
on the Directorship, which it is expected will yield a certain\
income of at least ten thousand a-year, apply to Jebemiah\
Diddles, No. L Scamp Buildings, Shark Street, where the\
business of the Company is for the present carried on.\

A CHAT ABOUT THE NETLEY MONUMENT.\
Scene\'97Inside a First Class Carriage. Swell and Surgeon passengers.\
Swell. Deuce! \{Winking and blinking violently; presses fingers to his\
eye) Ah!\
Surgeon. Something in your'eye?\
Swell. Cinder from engine.\
Surg. Let me take it out.\
Swell. Thanks.\
Surg. Where do you feel it?\
Swell. Here\'97just here.\
Surg. Under the upper eyelid. Wait a minute\'97must evert the\
lid. Don't be alarmed (taking out pocket ease); only want this thing.\
\{Accomplishes the operation by the help of a small probe). There!\
Out?\
Swell \{winks and blinks). Out! Thanks. By Jove! \{Observing case\
returned to pocket.) Lucky to have a Surgeon in the train.\
Surg. That is lucky, sometimes.\
Swell. Too often. Every train ought to carry a Surgeon.\
Surg. Yes, and an Assistant-Surgeon, to operate if necessary on the\
other. A man can't cut off his own leg.\
Swell. That is one of those things that no fellow can be expected to\
do. A Surgeon in a railway-train is as liable to be smashed as any other\
fellow. He is like a Surgeon under fire. Right and proper, that Netley\
Monument.\
Surg. To the fifty-four medical officers who fell in the Crimea.\
Swell. Monument will be a rather fine thing.\
Surg. Yes; but it won't do.\
Swell. Why?\
Surg. It won't encourage fifty-four more, or any number of fellows, to\
fall in the Crimea or elsewhere on the present terms.\
Swell. Ha! Yes. There's a regular Surgeon-Famine in the Army.\
It's a great bore.\
Surg. The famine might be relieved easily enough.\
Swell. What do the Surgeons want? Better pay?\
Surg. Well, yes; but more than that; better treatment. Fraternity\
and equality.\
Swell. Ah yes! I understand. To stand on the^ footing of brother\
officers and gentlemen.\
Surg. That's all. It isn't much.\
Swell. Well, you see, a Queen's warrant was issued to give them\
that. But the combatant officers wouldn't stand it.\
Surg. So when the doctors had been hooked in, the warrant was\
coolly rescinded.\
Swell. It certainly was an awful swindle.\
Surg. Talk of combatant officers! Isn't a fellow who may have to\
take up an artery in a shower of bullets as much a combatant officer as\
a General who as often as not directs strategic operations at a safe\
distance from them; if not exactly, as the showman says, "him taking\
good care to keep out of 'arm's way?"\
Swell. That was "Bonaparty, I think.\
Surg. "Napoleon Bonapabty." Wasn't Thomson, who was left on\
the field in charge of the wounded all night, which killed him, a com-\
batant officer?\
Swell. As much so as any fellow who ever won the Victoria Cross.\
Surg. There was a time, to be sure, when Army-Surgeons were a\
rough lot.\
Swell. In short, when Surgeons were Snobs. It's odd how long\
prejudice survives. The tradition of the Army is, that they are Snobs\
still.\
Surg. Yes; and good care is taken to keep them Snobs by refusing to\
treat them as gentlemen. Able Surgeons won't accept the position of\
Snobs. So the authorities have absolutely been reduced to advertise\
for Acting-Assistant-Surgeons.\
Swell. Certainly the cleverest way to getTthe compound of Surgeon\
and Snob which they appear to want. Only I'm afraid it doesn't\
answer. Have an idea! As they are resolved that the medical officers\
in the Army shall be Snobs, they should head their advertisements :\'97\
"Wanted. Snobs for Surgeons."\
Surg. They will most assuredly get no Surgeons hut Suobs, unless\
they give in. Decent fellows, men of education, steadily refuse to\
compete for the service. Doctors do agree on this point; and their\
unanimity is wonderful.\
Swell. It is very plucky of them, and does them the greatest credit.\
I admire their spirit, by Jove. The medical profession hanging together\

like bagmen.\
Surg. I think we've shown the Horse Guards that we are inde-\
pendent gentlemen, anyhow. Surgeons in the Army must have their\
claims conceded, or the Army will have to do without Surgeons.\
Swell. The thing is to remove the absurd prejudice against Surgeons.\
Ha! Have an idea! The way would be to place the medical profes-\

THE NEW WHIST-RULES.\
0 oblige the Portland, Ar-\
lington, Garrick, and\
other clubs where the finest\
Whist is played, a Com-\
mittee has been appointed\
to frame a few additional\
rules not to be found in\
Ccelebs, Cavendish, Bald-\
win, or any of the standard\
authorities. As everybody\
now plays whist, and as it is\
a solemn truth that "the\
young man who does not\
learn it is preparing for him-\
self a miserable old age,"\
Mr. Punch has pleasure in\
giving the New Rules a\
world-wide circulation.\
Call. You must never call\
for anything, when at whist,\
except for seltzer and sherry,\
and you may call for this once only during a rubber.\
Slam. A very rude habit. When you enter or leave the card-room,\
close the door gently.\
Tenace. Nothing is more unbecoming than to be vulgarly tenacious,\
but it is well to have your rights recognised.\
See-Saw. You ought not to leave the table during a rubber, for a\
game at this, no matter how much you may desire to stretch your limbs.\
In all good clubs, however, a plank and barrel are kept in the strangers'\
room for the recreation of whist-players, between the games.\
Cutting. Cut everybody during the game, except when you are obliged\
to speak. Whist requires absolute silence.\
Bumper. If the waiter hands you this, beware of slopping and wetting\
the cards, as old players do not like it.\
Lone, ii you are in this, you had better not play whist until cured.\
Lurch. This applies to games on board a yacht, or other vessel. It\
adversary s hand when he falls into\
\
is ungentlemanly to look\
your lap.\
Treble. If your voice is of this character, there is additional reason\
for your silence, for nothing is more detestable than a squeaker.\
Renounce. Old-fashioned gentlemen, who dislike vulgar swearing, use\
this active verb as part of an oath. The late Mr. Dowton was always\
saying "renounce me." But it is better avoided.\
Tierce major, or minor must never be mentioned when you are playing\
with a brewer.\
Longest Players. These withdraw by rotation after the second rubber,\
so you see the advantage of being a little man.\
Abandoned Hands. Never play with people of this kind.\
Bald Lead. When this is led, the adversary must say "dash my\
wig."\
Ragged Cards. If these are dealt to you," call the card-room waiter,\
and silently kick him.\
Ruffs. They are the same birds as Beeves, but you should not talk\
of them at play. . " When you shoot, shoot, when you play whist, play\
whist." (Charles Dance.)\
King-Card in Petto.\'97If you keep it there too long, your partner is\
justified in being also in a pet.\
Cutting Out. Nothing can be more annoying to the other players than\
your doing this during a game. If a messenger has come and wants\
you, let him wait.\
Cutting into a Table\'97 Cut your initials, if you have a knife, but do\
no more. It wastes time and spoils the cloth.\
Asking for Trumps. You can ask. if you like, but the dealer ought not\
to attend to you, out to give out the cards impartially.\
Odds. Are always in favour of even tempers.\

To Professor Holloway.\
We should decline the fulfilment of a moral obligation were\
we to withhold our testimony to the certain cure invariablyresulting\
from the use of those invaluable medicines, Holloway's Pills and\
Ointment. Bilious and stomach complaints; all diseases springing\
from foul blood, malarious districts, overheated atmospheres, hot or\
cold climates, unhealthy employments, over-exertion, indolence, intem-\
ferance or total abstinence, can be cured by these noble remedies,\
ever, ague, influenza, bronchitis, diphtheria, whooping-cough, measles,\
small-pox, thrush, stomach complaints, bilious disorders, affections of\
the eye and the mind, and the great toe, are easily met and readily\
conquered by your unrivalled medicaments. They are an effectual and\
instantaneous remedy for the mulligrubs. Both act harmoniously in\
preserving the pure and best materials of the body, and in expelling all\
that is redundant, effete, or corrupt, restoring the British constitution\
by a process precluding any occasion for the ballot and extension of the\
suffrage. Thus the Cure is not slight and ephemeral, (as it is with the\
credulous, who swallow quantities of stuff which is unwholesome if not\
inert), but complete and permanent, as thousands who have been cured\
of dropsy, cancer, fatty degeneration of the heart,, noli-me-tangere, and\
glanders m the human subject, have gratefully testified. Invalids' and\
sufferers in every quarter of the globe, including hunters in the' prairies\
of America, who have been bitten by the rattle-snake and the marsh-\
mocassin, have been thoroughly renovated by your remedies. Having\
administered your Ointment and applied your Pills to numerous per-\
sons, we are enabled to subjoin a few out of 60,000 cures.\

THE BUTTERCUP AND DAISY LEAGUE.\
There is in the music-shop windows on sale a vulgar song, entitled\
"I'd choose to be a Daisy." Its title, however, is suggestive, and has,\
in fact, helped to suggest a proposal which may happily find favour.\
For the rest, this suggestion is derived from a paragraph in the Times,\
stating the tnreatened destruction, and the attempt in progress at the\
rescue, of a beautiful meadow, forming part of the view from Carisbrook\
Castle in the Isle of Wight. "Gently sweeping from the carriage road\
below, down to the placid mill-stream, is a flowery meadow, 'ever\
blooming fresh and fair,' and studded with luxuriant elms; beyond the\
stream are the smiling gardens and verdant lawns of the west end of the\
village of Carisbrooke." Such is the reporter's account of this piece of\
"charming rural scenery," which goes by the name of the "Volunteer\
Field," having been bought, half-a-century ago, by the Volunteer\
officcis of the Isle of Wight, out of their pay, applied by them "to\
Volunteer and charitable purposes." For these purposes, the money\
and the land were vested in trustees; but the money all went smash in\
a local bank some time ago, and it turned out, the other day, that\
"arrangements" had "been made for letting the land on ground-rents\
for building purposes." No wonder that "at Newport and everywhere\
throughout the island, the project for carrying out t his work of destruc-\
tion has called forth strong feelings of disapprobation." The only\
wonder is that a project for spoiling a part of the Isle of Wight was\
ever listened to by the Trustee of the land, who is no Snob, but Sir\
Henry Oglander, whose ancestors came in with the Conqueror. It\
is as hard to conceive an old English baronet acceding to such a scheme\
as to fancy Fauns and Dryads consenting to the felling of timber. And\
yet we have to fight for Hampstead Heath against Sir Thomas Maryon\
Wilson.\
However, Sir Henry Oglander is not Sir Thomas Wilson, nor\
is a Trustee who acts in the interest of others, like a proprietor who [\
simply consults his own. Sir Henry Oglander is a gentleman; and\
if the fine old blood had stagnated, and induced a lethargy of soul, it I\
was stirred up by a deputation from the Newport Town Council, that\
waited on him " with the view of setting before him the destruction of\
rural scenery which the inroad of bricks and mortar would involve,\
and inducing him to abandon the project." He promised to do all he\
could to meet the wishes of the Newport people. But "a portion of the\
land has been already let." May the larger part be saved from the\
defacing clutches of the speculative builder!\
The song, "I'd choose to be a Daisy" associated with the foregoing\
particulars, has suggested the foundation' of a Society for the defence\
of Woods, Forests, Commons, Moors, and all other wild and beautiful\
places, from enclosure, agriculture, and bricks and mortar. This league\
for the preservation of English scenery will call itself "The Buttercups\
and Daisies."\
It is not good even for grocers, cheesemongers, butchers, bakers,\
linendrapers, tailors, and shoemakers, that the beauty of the country\
adjacent to their shops should be ruined; spiritually it is bad for them,\
and financially also. The Isle of Wight has been called the Garden of\
England. What sort of customers will its shopkeepers get when the\
parterres and flower beds of this garden are covered with bricks and\
mortar? Even the haberdasher and huckster may, with an enlightened\
eye to business, if the association above proposed should be organised,\
be disposed to become a Buttercup and choose to be a Daisy.\

THE WAY TO MEET THE TIMES.\
XToan Old Croaker.)\
Mr Poor-spirited Friend, 1\
What fun it is to hear a small man like you, grumble, as you\
do, at being forced to contribute to that general prosperity which you\
are invitea to share! You are out of keeping with the time\'97behind\
your age. Since you are forced to contribute to the general prosperity,\
why do you not accept the invitation to share it?\
You complain, forsooth, that the Income-Tax deprives you of the\
savings which, against old age and loss of employment, you ought to\
hoard out of your slender and precarious income. Poor petty miser!\
How much would sixpence in the pound be to save out of an income\
which is slender and precarious? You ought not to have a precarious\
and slender income. You should make a fortune. Why don't you\
speculate and be rich? Invest in several of those numerous joint-stock\
companies that will yield you twenty per cent, for your money. If you\
have no money to invest, borrow it at five per cent. Who will lend it\
to you? Nobody, while you live in such a hole and so shabbily as you\
do. Take a large house in a good district, give parties, and live up\
to the means which you should determine to get.\
The very basis of the country's present prosperity, which you call in-\
flated, is our fiscal system. There is something pitifully laughable in your\
objection to direct taxation! You say that the State confiscates a large\
part of your little income, and offers you compensation by encouraging\
you to spend the remainder. Well, why don t you take the compen-\
sation? You don't want it, you say; don't want the cheapened lux-\
uries which the facility of purchasing is the boon conferred on you by\
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in return for taking away your\
money. But you ought to want them. And you ought to make money\
to enable yourself to enjoy them. Make money, and make others make\
money. The price of butcher's meat, and of many other things, is\
ruinously liigh r Pooh! Make the more money, and enrich your butcher,\
and others. Produce and consume more. You are not half either\
of a producer or a consumer. Raise your consumption to the social\
standard, and increase your production, that is to say acquisition, with\
all your might. Don't talk of frugality, husbandry, thrift. Those very\
words are obsolete. Be as covetous as you please; but no parsimony!\
Don't be a narrow niggard; be a lavish screw. Sumptuous avarice is\
the fashion of the day, instead of cheeseparing economy.\
Probably, if you were living in a district where turnpike tolls have\
been abolished, you would complain of having to contribute, as a rate-\
payer, to the maintenance of the roads in more than a just proportion\
to your use of them, whereas what would be your proper course in such\
a case would be to indemnify yourself by using them more, and keeping\
horses and a carriage. I dare say, now, if any one were to leave you\
\'a31000, you would go and invest it in the Three-per-cents, as an old\
woman or a country curate would have done formerly. What would\
be the use of \'a330 of yearly dividend to you? You would be better\
without it, inside the workhouse. Risk a \'a31000 for \'a3200 a-year, and\
then risk that at the same rate, and so on. Nothing venture nothing\
have. What if you fail? You fail. You must fail somewhen. Any-\
how death is a sure smash for everybody. Failure need not come first.\
If it come, and is intolerable, why\'97there is chloroform.\
Are you subjected to cruel grinding, little sufferer? Don't groan\
under it, like a weak idle fool. Endure the grinding, and reimburse\
yourself by grasping with redoubled energy. The harder you are\
ground, grasp the wider. Never think of the end. It may be opulence,\
may be pauperism, may be penal servitude. At the worst there is\
always\'97chloroform. The life to come? Oh, bother! you must jump\
that, and not stand in the way of this world with your galoches and old\
umbrella. Who are you that you should have a way of your own which\
is not the world's? Go with the majority, sacrifice, or you will be\
sacrificed to Mammon, as some dyslogistically call the Spirit of the\
Age. I prefer the name of Plutus.\
An Old Story Spoiled.\
A Contemporary relates a wonderful anecdote about a hen. that\
flew at a cow in defence of her chickens, and killed the cow with one\
blow of her bill. This statement is not quite correct. To make the\
story perfectly genuine the hen should be a cock, and the cow a bull.\

I, on their behalf in\
particular, and in the\
interests of Society\
in general, have re-\
cently commenced\
my tour. The fol-\
lowing is my report:\
Winklebeach, Sus-\
sex Coast.\'97Winkle-\
beach, so called from\
the splendid speci-\
mens of the 'Winkle\
tribe found on its rocks, was recommended to me, as an out-of-the-way spot, by\
my young friend Shkymper, whose father, it appears, is the owner of some\
considerable property in the neighbourhood.\
The Railway has not yet reached Winklebeach. The nearest station is four miles\
distant. A message by telegraph is unknown. The Times is a luxury; an enter-\
prising general shopkeeper procures an occasional copy of Punch, which he permits\
to be read in his shop at a halfpenny a head, finally presenting it, munificently, to\
the Mayor and Corporation of the Town. The Mayor is the monopolising baker,\
the Corporation is represented by the aforesaid enterprising general shopman.\
The Civil Executive Force consists of one un-intelligent policeman, who is under\
no sort of control, having refused to take any oaths on conscientious principles;\
he is on and off duty all day and night, taking turn and turn about with himself.\
The inhabitants chiefly get a livelihood either by lying on their backs on the beach,\
or walking out to the Downs, and then walking hack again. The Elders of the\
people disappear usually at the early age of One hundred. There is a church, and an\
Independent chapel. The latter is remarkably Independent, and seldom opens its\
doors. There are only six houses in any way worthy of the name; numerous\
thatched cottages; and an ancient hostelrie called The Old Inn. These particulars\
having been obtained from Shrympbr, I decided that this, of all others, must be\
the shop for Quiet. Through my humble instrumentality,11 foresaw the future Quiet\
Greatness of Winklebeach.\
Of the means of Conveyance to Winklebeach.\
Monday, July. Extract from Note Book.\'97The only traveller alighting at the New\
Station of Swashborough. Nobody cared about taking my ticket. At length,\
after some trouble, a deaf old lady was summoned from her tea, by a small\
boy, who was digging potatoes. "Grandmother," cried the lad, "here's 'un wants\
to give tickutt." His aged relative received the pasteboard, and was returning to\
her placid meal, when I stopped her by asking, ' if I could get a conveyance to\

"Sure," said she, and straightway gave directions to her grandson, who ran off\
somewhere or other, and in the course of a quarter-of-an-hour returned with\
Something or other, which (we will term a vehicle. Such a vehicle! it wasn't a\
hackney-coach, because it was a bathiDg-machine, and it wasn't a bathing machine,\
because it was a hackney-coach. In I got with my portmanteau, and an uneasy\
time I had of it over the rough half-made roads; for the hackney-bathing-coach-\
machine had not been fitted with patent springs, and was unprovided with a\
cushion. I cheered myself with the inspiring thought, that, at all events, the [nui-\
sances and annoyances of cockney civilisation had not reached Winklebeach, and,\
despite the fact of my being unable to remain on the seat for more than two con-\
secutive minutes at a time, 1 was happy, idealising.\
FIRST DAT AT WINKLEBEACH.\
-i'30 p.m.\'97Arrived at the Old Inn, Winklebeach, facing a beautiful green leading\
on to Ihc beach. Clear view of the sea. Everything charming. Not a soul\
about. Boy wants six shillings for driving me. I'appeal to landlady. It appears\
that he is entitled to ask what he likes, there being a monopoly of "fancy bathing\
coaches in these parts, I pay him. Will I have a room? 1 will. Facing the sea?\
By all means. Dinner P Certainly. When? Now, or as quickly as possible.\
What will I have? What can I have? Oh, anything. Good. Then, let's say\
lamb. Oh! can't have lamb. No matter: a small leg of mutton. No mutton!\
No, not to-day, because it's Monday! What, not a chop? Oh yes, in twenty\
minutes. Chops be it. "Prawns and'Winkles to follow,\
of course?" Of course. Platefuls of these are brought\
in after dinner. Like Prawns, doat on 'Winkles.\
5'30.\'97I have unpacked, made myself comfortable, and\
sat down to my chop. The sea-breeze fans me through the\
open window, and a peppering of sand sprinkles my plate.\
"The Sea! the Sea! the o-o-pen Sea!" and so forth.\
Here .is quiet: real quiet. How very odd: I heard some-\
thing like a cheer. Another. I am informed by the\
waiting-maid that a Cricket-match, Trade v. Gentry, is\
juat being finished. Ah! a gala day, probably. Oh no,\
there's Cricket every day about this time of year, and a\
match'ouce a week. Ahem! Well that's scarcely a draw-\
back. 1 hear no more cheers. I will light a cigar and\
stroll.\
7'30.\'97Not a soul on the beach, save a few fishermen\
mending their nets. So picturesque! they smoke while\
thus employed. Pax vobiscum, ye fishermen: go on mend-\
ing your nets by all means. Pax to\'971 can't help fancying\
that I heard an oath. Another. Another. Their con-\
versation is limited; but seems to consist chiefly of oaths,\
and objectionable terms of endearment. 1 shall quit the\
beach.\
8 o'Clock\'97 In my room! Will have tea P What should\
I like? Oh, as usual. They bring two plates full of\
enormous prawns and 'winkles. Shall commence my report\
of this quiet place for mv employers. "Winklebeach is\
the quietest place in \}' \\ ery strange, there must be\
a quarrel goinit on outside. In front of my window\
are assembled I should say, all the inhabitants, mostly\
fishermen, lisherboys, tisherwomen, of various ages and\
sizes; some sitting on the low sea-wall, some squatting,\
some standing,\'97but all, as far as I can gather, talking\
simultaneously. I ring for the handmaid. I am informed\
that " there is nothing the matter, they are only talking\
over the Cricket-match. They always do that." Oh, do\
they! Then I will slightly modify my report and say,\
"Winklebeach is, except in one trifling particular, the\
quietest "By the way, the Cricket-match was between\
the Trade and Gentry. By this light I cannot distinguish\
the Trade from the Gentry; nor docs their language ma-\
terially assist me to discriminate.\
8'30.\'97A great clattering, a shuffling of feet , and a con\
fusion of voices in the room under mine. I ring my bell.\
Not fire, I hope. Oh dear no, the Cricketers are sitting\
down to supper. Do they sit down in this manner every\
night? Oh no, not every night. Thank you. "Winkle-\
beach is, except in one or two trilling particulars, the\
quietest"\
915.\'97The tinkling of a banjo! It is, there is no doubt\
about it, it is in the room below. Ha! the burden of a\
well-known song arises! Can I believe my ears! "Is\
the Pretty Polly Perkins of Paddington Green." Chorus\
everybody trying to mark time with their thick-soled\
clumsy feet, each man according to his own idea. "She's\
as beautiful," &c. I ring my bell. Docs this go on every\
night? No, this does not; man with banjo is a visitor.\
That's lucky; dropped in by accident, eh? Oh no, be\
generally comes on a Cricket-match evening. Oh! thank\
you. "Winklebeach is, except on Cricket-match evenings,\
when the man with the banjo comes, the quietest"\
10.\'97Somebody has taken to sing sentimental songs,\
with much chorus. As the night advances, the songs\
seem to be all chorus. Some rustic is trying his hand on\
the banjo. I shall go to bed. The wind has begun to\
howl.\
10 30.\'97Cricketing Party breaking up. Rain. Cricketing\
party very noisy. Hail, I should say, judging from the\
pattering at my window. Stones, as I live! Small stones.\
Crash! I look out; and am jeered at, perhaps by the mis-\
creant with, banjo. Feet scuttling away in all directions.\
An Englishman's room is his castle. What a cold I shall\
have to-morrow. 1 .light a candle to write this, and go to\
bed. How the wina has got up; that reminds me, so\
have I. To bed. One line more. "Winklebeach is, with\
the exception of cricketing, supper-parties, and banjos, the\
quietest "Puff! Candle out. Bed.\

PICTORIAL ADVERTISEMENTS.\
A Great Classic has told us (and as we knew it without him we are\
noways obliged), that there is nothing like appealing to the Eye, if you\
wish to secure attention. The remark has not the least bearing on\
what we are going to say, inasmuch as printing appeals to the eye, as\
well as engraving; but the man who neglects to show that he has be=n\
classically educated, is unworthy the name of a scholar and a gentleman.\
With this exordium (another scholastic expression), we beg to call\
at tention to the following specimen of a new style of advertising. In\
these days of hurry and scramble no appeal can be too emphatic, and\
we consider this new means of attracting attention decidedly worthy of\

HOW TO KNOW WHEN PARLIAMENT IS UP.\
Report of an Accident during the Session.\
On Tuesday night, at half-past Eight, one of the engines on the new\
I portion of the Great Southern and Northern Railway ran away, and\
dashing through the wall of the bridge over Squitterton Street, Clerken-\
well, fell into the street. Happily no one was passing at the time, so\
no harm was done beyond the destruction of the engine, and of a cos-\
tcrmonger's barrow.\
Report of an Accident after the Session.\
It would be late in the day to dilate upon the great advantages which\
Society has derived from the invention of our Railway System, and we\
confess that we hail every extension of that system with what we hope\
is not an unreasonable pleasure. At the same time the most fervent\
admirers of the Railway must admit that there are some drawbacks\
which, though they cannot be regarded as blemishes upon a noble\
invention, are not unfrequently productive of serious mischief. For-\
tunately in the incident which we are about to describe there are\
no features of a painful character, but it is impossible not to feel that\
under other circumstances we might have had a far more lamentable\
tale to tell than that which we have now to narrate. The opening of\
tlie auxiliary branch of the Great Southern and Northern RaUway nas\
been a deciaed boon to the inhabitants of the densely populated neigh-\
bourhood through which the extension has taken place, and until\
Tuesday in the current week, the extreme care of tbe intelligent officials\
has prevented the slightest casualty from marring the gratification with\
which this Metropolitan Improvement has been welcomed. But there\
is no rule without an exception, and the evening to which we have\
referred was destined to create such an exception in the case of the line\
to which our preliminary remarks refer. There is some little discrepancy\
in the accounts of the exact period at which the accident occurred, some\
witnesses stating that it took place at half-past eight, p.m., and others\
insisting that it was nearer a quarter to nine, but this may be in some\
measure accounted for by the fact that the population of Squitterton\
Street is not of that class which deems it essential to carry an unim-\
peachable chronometer, like one by Me. Bennett, and is content to\
depend for a general knowledge of the hour upon the clocks which form\
part of the furniture of the leading shops, and which not uncommonly\
vary to an appreciable extent. But about the time in question, the\
neighbourhood was thrown into a state of extraordinary excitement by\
the news that a Railway Accident had occurred. At first it was\
rumoured that the Birmingham express train, with all its travellers,\
had been precipitated into the street, but on recollection that the\
Birmingham trains do not travel by the new line, this idea was dis-\
missed, and the population hastened to discover for itself what was the\
nature of the calamity. It was at once seen that a magnificent engine,\
the name of which we were unable to detect, owing to the peculiar way\
in which it had fallen, had been eliminated from its proper sphere, and\
had plunged into the street below. Beneath it, and happily its only\
victims, were a large number of herrings and apples, the property of\
one James Snoggin, a costermonger \{and a native we believe of Bat-\
tersea or Chelsea) who had retired for a few moments of refreshment to\
the nearest public house, the Carp and Tinder-box, kept by a respected\
landlord, Mr. Dobbs, who is a subscriber to the Licensed Victuallers'\
Asylum, and the other charities of that admirable body. The distress\
of the poor man at the destruction of his stock in trade excited much\
sympathy, and a subscription, headed by a few choice spirits who arc in\
the habit of using the Carp and Tinder-box, was commenced for him at\
the instance of the worthy host. We have at present no further particulars\
of public interest, for the station-master declined to furnish us with any\
opinion of his own as to the proximate cause of the accident, and the\
porters and workmen may be excused by the excitement of the hour,\
and the necessities of exertion, for the apparent incivility which referred\
us to the most objectionable sources for information. We may add,\
however, that several of the inhabitants had been heard to say that the\
bridge did not look strong enough to bear the weight that constantly\
passed over it, and though this remark did not apply to the wall, which\
alone gave way, it will no doubt have due consideration when the\
searching investigation, which will of course be demanded, shall take\
place. Should we obtain any further particulars, they shall be published.\
Latest Particulars.\
Wc have still failed to obtain the name of the engine, owing to the\
extreme reluctance of the Railway officials to afford any information;\
but a person named Stoggeb, who is engaged in the occupation of a\
was something at all\
or the Fhantom.\
A NY one finding the above is earnestly requested to Keep it.\
crossing-sweeper near the spot, believes that it\

Yankee Overture to the South.\
Bull sold me arms and ammunition, and he sold you ship3; he\

A LITTLE FAMILY BREEZE.\
Mrs. T. "What a Wretch you must be, T.; wer don't tou take me off? Don't tou see I'm overtook with the Tide, ahtj\

T. "Well, then\'97will tou promise not to Kick up such a Row when I stop out Late of a Saturday?"\
PREMATURE SMOKING.\
Like many other profound thinkers, Mr. Punch is fond of smoking,\
and he naturally entertains a sympathy for smokers. To have his\
sympathy, however, smokers must smoke sensibly, and not commit\
excesses. Mr. Punch likes moderate drinking, but he hates to see men\
drunk; and he regards immoderate smokers as only a shade less to be\
despised by him than drunkards.\
Smoking prematurely is, to Mr. Punch's thinking, the worst form of\
excess, and the one which moves in him most hatred and disgust.\
Smoking prematurely is a selGsh snobbish practice, and it is matter for\
regret that there are not more means to stop it. Clearly it is nonsense\
to pretend that boys can really have a need or liking for tobacco, or be a\
whit the better or the happier for using it. Boys who prematurely smoke\
do so not because they like it, but because they think it manly to be\
seen able to smoke. Such smokers are. in fact, mean silly little snobs,\
and all right-minded people justly hold them in contempt. Nature\
does her best to act as their tobacco-stopper; f but by practice they\
acquire the power to smoke without being made sick by it, and, this\
done, they delude themselves by fancying that tobacco has become a\
vital neea to them, and when they smoke they try to think they really\
relish it. This however is sheer nonsense, for the true taste for tobacco\
comes alone with age, like the appetite for turtle, and is not to be\
acquired by those who prematurely seek it.\
Moreover, boys who take to smoking have not the sense to put due\
bounds on their indulgence, and they are apt to smoke at times when\
it does them the most injury, and is to others the worst nuisance.\
Unable to control themselves, they smoke in business hours and in\
going to their business; and when going out to dinner they take a\
turtive pipe, and even come into a drawing-room with coats that stink\
of stale tobacco: Now, tobacco is a good thing, and good things\
ought not to be wasted. Smoking prematurely is a worse than waste,\
for it annoys people about him and only harms the smoker. One cannot\
well doubt this, if ane but sees the pimply cheeks and tallowy complexions\
of the young short-pipe-sucking fools who meet us everywhere.\
Every whiff they take out helps to blow their brains out, and puts out\
of tune their organs of digestion. Few men can smoke early in\
the day without its hurting them, and any boy who does so runs!\
assuredly be weakened both in body and in mind by it. A boy (which\
word applies to all youths under twenty) who goes to business daily\
with a pipe between his teeth has put an enemy into his mouth\
that will steal away his brains, and it is well that his employer should\
be warned against the robbery. Smoking prematurely is a habit as\
injurious as taking early morning drams, or drinking port wine before\
dinner; and as the evil has increased to really serious dimensions,\
Mr. Punch may be excused for making serious remarks, and not making\
a joke of it.\

EXAMINATIONS FOR LADIES.\
\
ie great success of the Examinations\
which have lately been instituted,\
under University authority, for the\

e adoption of a system of Ex-\
aminations for Ladies. Particu-\
lars will shortly be announced, and\
in the meantime the first portion of\
the Questions has been issued, that\
ladies may direct their attention to\
the necessary studies.\
The following are the first four\

all bad laws, and let Sir Charles Phiffs publish any new ones\

RECIPROCITY ON ONE SIDE.\
We had not noticed the heading of the following advertisement in\
the Telegraph when giving way to our first burst or admiration at the\
kindliness and benevolence of the advertisers :\'97\
A Lady and Gentleman having no family of their own would take a MALE\
CHILD from its BIRTH, or from that to three months old, and bring it up entirely\
as their own.\'97Address, Ac.\
We had begun a mental survey of the households of our friends, and\
were considering to what over-stocked establishment we should enclose\
the invitation, when our eye darted up to the first line, and we beheld\
a word, and something else. We saw this:\'97\
JpOR \'a3100.\
Well, this would be cheap if the transaction could be made secure.\
A precious boy costs a precious deal more than JElOO^efore you have\
done with him. But as the sale of an infant (except in the way of a\
high-life marriage) is not recognised by the law of England, and as,\
when the money had been spent, and the baby-buyers got ti^ed of their\
bargain, they might send it back by the Parcels Delivery Company, we\
resolved, on second thoughts, to keep the advertisement as a. curiosity\
for the readers of Punch.\

We always regarded the Napoleon family as mentally if not physically\
strong, but information which we have just received from Glasgow, and\
which is published in the North British Daily Mail of the 17th of\
August (we give the date for the benefit of M. Thiers, or any other\
historian of the Napoleonic dynasty), shows that one member at least of\
the distinguished Corsican family is possessed of personal strength\
which would make him very formidable in battle, dud his tendencies\
lead him into such a scene. The Mail says, in its account of Prince\
Napoleon's visit to the Scottish capital (yes, Mrs. Edina, the Scottish\
capital, and how do you like that ?)\
"The utmost privacy has been observed in all tho movements of his Royal High-\
ness, insomuch so that he preferred lifting a cab on the stand, in preference to\
sending out for it"\
Achilles, we believe, was too much for a rival who had three tre-\
mendous horses harnessed to his car. Walter Scott tells us of a\
Scottish knight, who at a blow divided an English knight, horse and all,\
into two instalments. In Morgante Maggiore we read how the friendly\
giant carried his dead horse to Orlando. But none of these feats equal\
the deed of the Samsonic Prince Napoleon, and his cousin may be\
congratulated on the vast strength of the Atlas who aids in upholding\
the Imperial throne.\

A PUZZLE BY A PARSON.\
Here is an announcement which is constantly perplexing us :\'97\
TTNMANAGEABLE BOYS, or Youths (up to 20 years), made perfectly\
U tractable and gentlemanly, in one year, by a clergyman, near town, of 80 years'\
experience, whose peculiarly persuasive, high moral and religious training at once\
elevates children of peculiar tempers and disposition (because not understood) to\
the level of others. A most liberal education, including modem languages, suc-\
cessful preparation for every examination and vocation in life, and every gentle-\
manly comfort, on moderate terms. Address, for interview, Ac.\
By starvation and severity a boy may be made "tractable," doubtless,\
in a twelvemonth; but how can it be predicted with anything like cer-\
tainty that he will be made " gentlemanly" in that restricted time. Of\
course, religious training may do much good to a boy, but if his dis-\
position is to be a snob, or sneak, or scoundrel, we scarcely think a\
twelvemonth would suffice to make him gentlemanly, in the right sense\
of that word. Gentlemen unluckily do not spring up like mushrooms:\
and, in minds quite unprepared for them, truly gentlemanly qualities\
are not of rapid growth. We are told there are born gentlemen, and\
there doubtless are born blackguards, and to make one of these latter\
a gentleman in a twelvemonth, is more than forty parson power would\
be able to effect.\
Quite Pat.\
Under the heading of The Belfast Riots, the other day, there was a\
letter in the Standard signed "O Mores," animadverting on one which\
had before appeared in that journal with the subscription of " 0 Tem-\
pora." From the temper displayed in these communications, as well\
as from the subject to which they relate, it may be surmised that their\
respective authors might, consulting aptitude, have penned their sig-\
natures with the least taste of a modification. They should have written\
themselves down O'Tempora, and O'Mores.\

ZOOLOGICAL RECREATION.\
\
okthy Ma. Punch,\
The interest\
excited by the late\
swimming matches\
suggests a season-\
able question for\
zoologists. Let\
me revive the con-\
troversy about\
Man's place in\
Nature, which has\
flagged for some\
little time, by ask-\
ing that question;\
which perhaps\
Professor Owen\
or Professor\
Huxley will an-\
swer.\
You know, Sir,\
that animals are\
distinguished from\
man not only by\
deficiencies but\
also endowments;\
as well by the pos-\
session of instinct\
as by the want of\
think all quad-\
rupeds swim natu-\
rally, whereas no\
men do. Now I\
want to know whether tne quadrumana swim naturally. The question\
I wish to ask anybody who can answer it is, "Do monkeys swim?"\
This point, if there is any doubt about it, might easily be settled in\
the Zoological Gardens, by tossing the orang-outang into the hippo-\
potamus's tank. Or an Italian organ-grinder's monkey might be put\
to the proof, and his master, too; for if an orang-outang is what you\
call an anthropoid ape, an Italian organ-grinder is what you may call a\
pithecoid man, and lie is a body such as the proverb recommends for\
experimental purposes, and a ducking would clean him. Jocko and\
Giacomo, or whatever the grinning alien may call himself, are, to be\
sure, disgustingly like; yet I hope there is an essential difference\
between Simia and\
Homo.\
P.S. I have, perhaps, too hastily assumed that mankind does not\
swim naturally. Do babies swim? I am not a papa, and few mothers\
are philosophical; but no doubt you could get many a wet nurse,\
having the care of a lady's infant, to determine this inquiry for you in a\
tub.\'97H.\

In an age pre-eminently distinguished by commercial enterprise, it is\
somewhat remarkable that an organisation similar to that embraced by\
the "Anti-Railway Assault and Robbery Guarantee Company," should\
never have met with any vigilant promoter. It is now proposed to\
combine in one grand Joint-Stock undertaking the experts who on\
British Banks or Hounslow Heath have hitherto found exercise for their\
predatory powers. The papal administration has never hesitated to\
recognise and reward talent in any guise\'97even when assuming the\
scarlet cloak of a brigand. Our non-paternal Government firmly declines\
to employ for its own advantage, the faculties of felony, even when they\
have successfully passed a penal examination, and secured those much-\
coveted diplomas, popularly known as tickets-of-leave. Under these\
circumstances the formation of a Company has become with the noble-\
man and gentlemen whose names are attached to this Prospectus, a\
matter of paramount necessity, while it supplies a desideratum which\
has long been secretly felt by all who love.their specie.\
Respect for those conservative feelings which shrink instinctively\
from innovation, impels us to make one simple but important remark".\
The honourable custom of black-mail to which in feudal times the border\
barons occasionally lent a helping hand, affords a precedent for this\
institution, and denotes the principle on which it is based.\
The Anti-Railway Assault and Robbery Guarantee Company will\
grant, according to a graduated scale regulated by the nervousness of\
the insurer, a safe conduct to all parts of the United Kingdom\'97Ireland\
excepted.\
An ornamental card, embodying the Policy of Insurance, worn on the\
hat or mantle, will entitle the bearer, whether lady or gentleman, to\
the respectful forbearance and chivalrous protection of the company's\
agents on any specified Railway, and at all hours of the night.\
Luggage properly belonging to Insurers, and taken by the Company's\
Agents through inadvertence, will be restored within forty-eight hours\
after written application to the Secretary.\
Ladies publicly exposing their watcnes will vacate their policies\
unless at the time of granting the same, such extraordinary risk shall\
be duly paid for and provided.\
No loss occasioned by skirt-pockets will be recognised, except on\
payment of a premium proportioned to the facilities offered.\
Convivial gentlemen returning from City Dinners, can'insure for a\
single journey at very moderate premiums.\
Members of Parliament, Fellows from the Universities and the Stock\
Exchange, desirous of witnessing the noble art of self-defence, as illus-\
trated in a contest for the championship, may insure in this office to a\
limited extent against insult and spoliation. The Company will, how-\
ever, under no circumstances insure the retention by its owner of any\
ring valued at more than five shillings sterling.\
Special Policies granted to muscular Divines, securing immunity from\
ecchymosis of the eye, or a broken nose.\
Clubs liberally treated with. Twenty per cent, discount allowed to\
Members of the Carlton, in token of their warlike spirit and recent zeal\
for the National honour.\
N.B. The Shareholders in this Company will be gratified to leani\
that the Directors of all the Great Lines have unanimously resolved not\
to open any communication between Passenger and Guard, or to\
sanction any other precaution which might be detrimental to the\
interests of the Anti-Railway Assault and Robbery Guarantee Company.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
\
FROM OUR ILL-USED CONTRIBUTOR.\
Mr. Punch. The Temple.\
ib,\'97I consider myself\
an ill-used man. I\
. am aware that ill-\
used men are awfully\
unpopular, but I do\
not care about popu-\
larity. You have\
sentenced me to\
Penal Servitude in\
London, at a time\
when I ought to be\
far away, like all the\
rest of your young\
men. and as good\
conduct is no longer\
to be reckoned in\
regard to the re-\
mission of a sentence,\
I trust 1 am too faith-\
ful a Protestant to\
attempt any works\
of supererogation. I\
shall stay in town,\
and I shall write,\
since better may\
not be," but you\
need not look for\
any of that loyal and\
gushing zeal which I display at other times in your interest.\
You instruct me "to remain in London, and to take a general view\
of what is going on." Dolus latet in aeneralibus, as the old lawyers say,\
but for the first word you may read dolor, as more descriptive of my\
present state of mind. Besides, there is nothing going on, except the\
Thames Embankment.\
You have frequently remarked, and t have not dissented from the\
propositions, that my style combines the easy flow of Addison with the\
vigour of Macaulat, that it is studded with the wit of Sydney Smith,\
and with the pregnant epithets of CarlYle^ while its undercurrent of\
philosophy is redolent of Tupper, and its poetic proclivities remind you\
of Longfellow and Tennyson. Or if you have not exactly said that,\
critics say it everyday of any author they are told to puff, and I deserve\
such recognition quite as much as anybody. But, Sir, charming as my\
style may/be, it will be ruined by such work as that to which you have\
so inconsiderately doomed me.\
London would be a howling wilderness, if there were anybody left in\
it to howl. Forty-eight hours have elapsed since I have spoken to any\
human being except my cook (the housemaid is visiting at Ramsgate)\
and the waiter at the Club, who is sulky because other waiters are\
having their holiday in fine weather, and he believes\'97and I hope\'97that\
he will have wet days. I am losing the gift of speech. I misapply\
words. I spoke civilly to a cabman on Tuesday, though the brute put\
me down two doors further than the house I wanted. I said to that\
sulky waiter, "Oblige me with some bread," and he had the impudence\
to think that I was going to be facetious with him. I promptly cured\
him of that idea when he proceeded to forget the French mustard, but\
you see the state to which solitude has reduced me. I am getting\
nervous, too, and when my cabman was lashing his horse and tearing\
up a street covered all over with heedless children, I was weak enough\
to shut my eyes, and very nearly told him to drive more slowly. You\
are responsible for debilitating the finest intellect in your service.\
Where am I to go? Nearly every theatre is shut. I have seen the\
Ticket-of-Leave Man until 1 could prompt without book. I went so\
often to that witty and enchanting entertainment, The Pyramid, that\
Mr. Reed believed I wanted to steal his lovely bull-dog. Alfred\
Mellon has given me nine boxes for his Concerts, which are the best\
things in the world, but I am horribly afraid he thinks that I sell them,\
knowing the demand for them\'97this is a good puff, but it is deserved.\
I know Masks and Faces by heart; besides, that heart is on the waters\
with Leah, and the theatre without her makes me pensive. Mr. Voting's\
house on fire excites me too much to leave me a tranquil enjoyment of\
my Welsh rabbit at Paddy Green's, and Mr. Grben himself, though\
he addresses me in the words of some song, "/ have always a Welcome\
for Thee," evidently imagines that I am in town, at such a time, for no\
good purpose. Besides, you do not pay me a large (if inadequate)\
salary to write about theatres and mutton chops.\
Certainly, a few nights ago the Club was crowded, that is for the\
time of year. There were four men in it, including your Ill-used Con-\
tributor. There was 7\
thing else, I am in no\
way I might have called ,\
friends do) and he told me that he had come to town to consult an\
oculist. My playful retort you will have quickness enough to imagine,\
\
but he declared that it was not all my Eye, but his, and he was savage\
at a second epigram which I launched in reference to a certain greenness\
which I suggested that the operator had better remove. Oculist! I\
know why ne came up. My lawyers are his lawyers, and though soli-\
citors never betray professional confidence, one can't help seeing papers\
when they lie under your very proboscis or nose. Mr. Jehosuaphat,\
of the Hebrew persuasion, has a knack of recallingsome of his friends\
to town, just when they least want to come. As Bertie chose to try\
to mystify me, perhaps I didn't lead the conversation into Jewry, and\
make him fidget in his chair, in spite of his tenpenny cigar, the extra-\
vagant beast. Then the next quarter of the party was Ted Cleveland.\
He was perfectly miserable, lie cannot get away at all, his partners\
being off, but he did not care about that much while he knew that Miss\
Maria (\'abA-never mind) was safe at her uncle the parson's, in the country\
village, with about nine she-cousins and a hobbadehoy. But Maria and.\
the eldest Miss Concordance have been invited to the Larches, and\
Mrs. Fircone has always three or four Guards, or Treasury men, or some\
such awful swells pervading the house. Ted somehow managed to let\
his misery out, and Bertie and I ran the bag-fox like men. We looked\
at our watches, and told him that Charley Stratton, the handsomest\
chap in the 119th, must just then be taking Maria in to dinner; and\
later we pointed out that Charley, who has a wonderful mumble just\
above a whisper, which he has artistically cultivated, must be having\
food innings by that time. And we pictured a pic-nic among the rocks\
y the cascade, and Maria, with abbreviated crinoline, helping\
Charley to boil the kettle, which nearly made poor Teddy boil over\
with jealousy and rage. The best of it was, too, that I knew Charley\
had left the Larches for Scotland last week. So we had some little\
pleasure that evening, but what is one Oasis in a desert P And talking\
of that, what is an Oasis F\
The other man will not stand chaff. This was Henry Vampire. I\
found him in the Library, scribbling his hardest, with a lot of books\
beside him. He apprised me, with much objectionable but forcible\
language, that his editor (there are other tyrants beside yourself) had\
sent him four or five theological works to be elaborately reviewed, and\
he was knocking them off as fast as he could, for he had promised him-\
self a fortnight's good gambling at Baden-Baden. To my demand why\
he did not work in his <)wn Well-stocked study, he replied that the\
painters were in it, and he referred to those apathetic mechanics with a\
strength of adjective and participle which showed how earnest his theo-\
logical reading had made him. I invited him to join me and Bertie at\
our humble repast, but he replied savagely that he would neither eat\
nor drink until he had polished off the everlasting humbug who had\
written the volumes to which Vampy was doing as much justice as\
he knew. I have seen the review since, and I am bound to say that\
the Rev. Carney, D.D., owes small thanks to those paint-pots of Egypt.\
But Bertie Walpole has, I suppose, squared it with Jehosuaphat.\
and Ted sulks at home, and Vampire has ventilated his theology, and\
is off to the play-tables of Baden-Baden. At all events, there is\
nobody in the Club, except the impersonation of discomfort who has\
the honour to address you. I have nothing to do, nothing to read, no-\
body to speak to. I work away at the newspapers doggedly, but news-\
papers, at this period, are sad and solemn things. One gives me a leader\
to-day on the Education of the Orphans of Criminals, another on the\
Drainage of the Outhouses on Farms, and a third on the Law of Patents.\
Still I Tead them, as a prisoner counts the nails in the door of his cell.\
Then I look out at a window, and see a railway van, and hope it will\
break down, and a costermonger's cart, and wish there was a law against\
his bellowing, and seven empty cabs, crawling, and they remind me of\
the railway station to which you have forbidden me to drive. Then I\
look out at another window, but the prospect is not materially varied.\
Then I go to the desk, and see what is for dinner, and behold very few\
things, and none that I like, except grouse, which is four shillings, and\
you know whether I am paid highly enough to afford grouse. Then I\
go and smoke, and that destroys the little appetite I had, and I take\
sherry and American bitters to wing it back, wnich it doesn't. Then I\
read the evening papers, and they are stupider than the morning ones,\
and badly dried by that- detestable and sulky waiter. Finally, I sit\
down gloomily to dinner, and take much more wine than I want in\
order to help on the evening. Lastly, I smoke again, many cigars, but\
I do not enjoy them, and my mouth is hot, and gin-sling I think makes\
you thirstier, nevertheless I take it. Ultimately, I go home in a\
Hansom, and the driver asks me an extra sixpence because he has been\
doing nothing all day. I give it him because I have been doing nothing\
all day: in other times I should have told him he ought to be ashamed\
of his idleness, and left him with the repartee instead of the sixpence.\
But I am demoralised. Then I go into my house, and find two letters\
from duns who know I am in town, and one from my wife, stating that\
she and the family are delighted with Scarborough, and that she wants\
money. Then I go.up-stairs to bed, and find all the carpets taken away\
to be cleaned or done some other nonsense with. And I can't sleep,\
having had no mental or bodily work, and when I do I dream that I am\
in a drain and bellowing up the grating to be taken out, and none of the\
passers-by can hear me. And all this is your doing.\
Nevertheless I remain, with affection and respect, your dutiful\
Contributor, Epicurus Rotundus.\

Liille Innocent (in an audible little Voice in Ike middle of the Sermon). "Ma! was that the Organ?"\
[We hope Old Dubblcby will take die hint, and not make such an awful noise Blowing his Nose in Church far the /aim.\
CREATORS OF RELIGIOUS RIOTS.\
Time was when the Government of the day found themselves called\
upon to administer " a heavy blow and a great discouragement to Pro-\
testantism." There has again arisen a necessity for the same stroke of\
policy. Just because the Roman Catholics of Dublin, in the exercise\
of that freedom to which they are entitled, get up an O'Connell de-\
monstration, the Protestants of Belfast, imagining themselves entitled\
to a corresponding freedom, must needs get up an anti-O'CoNNELL\
demonstration! They well knew that their Roman-Catholic fellow-\
citizens cannot stand contradiction, and are sure to return chalT with\
stones. They know how dangerous it is to vex them; then why do\
they do it F They go and make a Guy of O'Connell, and, of course,\
provoke those religious people to assault them with intent to kill them\
or do them grievous bodily harm. Hence the Belfast riots.\
Then see what has happened in Jersey. A Mr. T. G. Owens, of\
London, who probably may be heard of at Exeter Hall, comes down\
from the capital of the larger island to that of the smaller, and under-\
takes to deliver in the Prince of Wales Assembly Rooms, three lectures\
on " Bible Truths and Romish Errors." As if be were not aware that\
it makes the generality of Roman Catholics very angry to call any of\
their doctrines erroneous P What was the consequence of Mr. Owen's\
impudent imprudence? Of these lectures, as we learn from a report in\
a contemporary:\'97\
"The first was delivered on Tuesday evening, and effort* wore then made by a\
number of Catholics to seize the lecturer, whose life they threatened."\
Their object, of course, was to silence the assailant of their opinions\
in the shortest and most effectual way. The attempts of the Faithful\
to destroy the Heretic were, however, unsuccessful. The bigoted\
incendiary escaped from them and their pious indignation by a side-\
entrance to the hall. He was silenced without having been killed.\
This partial success was sufficient to quiet the champions of Roman\
doctrine, for the time during which Mr. Owens was obliged to hold\
his irritating tongue:\'97\
"On.Wcdnesday night, however, the part which was played by the mob proved\
of a most serious character, ttoon after scvon o'clock a largo number of Roman\
Catholics, many of them armed with bludgeons, collected at the door of the Lecture\
Hall, and commenced yelling and hooting. They woro aided and urged on\
between twenty and thirty women of the low Irish class. After creating immense\
uproar outside, they smashed the windows of the Hall by throwing stones through\
them, whilo some of tho women yelled * Fire I Fire I'"\
This gentle violence was emblematical. The windows were smashed,\
to symbolise heretical darkness. The stones thrown through them were\
arguments, calculated to beat conviction into Protestant Leads; arp-\
ments truly suitable to the vindication of the see of Peter, as that\
name is synonymous with stone, if not exactly with pebble. The\
hint which the ladies meant to convey in the words which the reporter\
pleases to say they " yelled," is obvious. Will it be believed that, not\
only were the Roman-Catholic controvertists put down by the police\
under the direction of the Bailiff (Mr. G. Hammond) and the Con-\
stable of the Town (Mr. John Gilbert), but, on Thursday evening,\
the parish constable, instructed, no doubt, by his fanatical superiors,\
took measures to secure the impious Protestant, in his offensive endea-\
vour to impugn the dogmas of Infallibility in a public lecture-hall, from\
interruption on the part of their zealous believers P So Owens, in a\
lecture on "Transubstantiation and the Mass," was actually enabled to\
state his impertinent objections to those mysteries as freely and openly\
as a Roman-Catholic, priest or layman, would be allowed to argue that\
the Church of England is a humbug!\
If a law, prohibiting, under sufficiently heavy penalties, all attempt\
at the disproof of Roman Catholic tenets, existed!, it is probable that\
the Roman-Catholic lower orders would seldom take the law into their\
own hands. The re-enactment of the statute Be Hatretico Comfortndo,\
would be tolerably certain to prevent all such disturbances as those\
which have taken place in Jersey and Belfast. But though that is not\
to be hoped for by an oppressed minority, they may perhaps reasonably\
expect that the Legislature will interpose, to prevent them from being\
provoked to outrage and violence, by the secondary punishment of penal\
servitude, adjudged, without mercy, to those who exasperate them by\
gainsaying them.\

not by dr. newman.\
Mr. Putsch,\
I Turn to you, Sir, as the friend of the oppressed\'97the ever\
generous apologist for youth's short-comings\'97above all, I turn to you,\
Sir, in your omniscience as knowing more, or certainly more knowing\
than all those Commissioners to whose wise conclusions, as exhibited in\
their Report on Public Schools, I refuse to defer. I am one of that\
class, Mr. Punch, who having passed the days, all the days of my boy-\
hood, at a first Public School, turn out at the end a know-nothing\'97\
Anglici, Sir, a fool!\'97and yet, Sir, being all this (I need not repeat\
the graphic description given by the Commissioners), I venture to\
appeal; to you in apology for my class. I hope to show you that the\
ded is not so black as those worthies have painted him. I hope to\
show you, Sir\'97and through you, the.whole world beside\'97that I am not\
so wholly useless in my generation. The Commissioners tell you what\
I am not worth, hear me while I strive to show you what I am.\
Now, Sir, these gentlemen parade against me, that after all these\
years of education I cannot put a common-place "^English sentence into\
decent Latin. Now, Mr. Punch, I beg you to take any one of your\
own telling, terse paragraphs, and request of those gentlemen on cither\
side of the House, or Sir, in either House, to do that passage Ciceroni-\
cally. and give me the result! Get up, Mr. Bright; Mr. Cox of\
Finsbury, up I and apart from whisperings with Messrs. Gladstone,\
Cabdwell, Lowe, or a pocket Ainsworth, \'a7ive us Mr. Punch's\
last more Ciceroniano, or if it like you better, Liviano," or more like\
Punch still, "Terentiano," and I bet you twopence to a farthing\
that you are nowhere. Or, Betting aside the Cambridge quidnuncs,\
just put it to the Hon. Members aforesaid to! explain OOCKXT\'97\

\f0  P??P\'84 and what will you get out of'em? Or, ask\
them to give in detail as recorded ,by Polybius, the dialogue of Han-\
nibal and Napoleon on the best way of crossing the Alps, with the\
dates and particulars of the Marengo and Cannee fights, and which com-\
manded at which, and which was First Consul, Bonaparte, or F abuts\
or Gregory of Nazianzen, and where Nazianzen was, and if it is, and\
see how blank their faces and their papers will be! Well, Sir, you will\
say, this is nothing to the point; but pardon me, when I say, that it is\
all to the point; for though these gentlemen don't, know these things,\
they make (many of them) very decent M.P.'s; and so I, though I don't\
know them any more than they do, make in my proportions very often\
a very useful member of Society. Nay, more, Mr. Punch and a very\
important more too. which these wiseacres ignore in toto. After all, I do\
not come away such a fool as they would make me, for though I may\
not know who did what in which chapter, or who dragged who round\
the walls of what\'97whether it was Brasidas, or Cleon, or Pompey or.\
Gustavus.Vasa, who crossed the Rubicon and look Calais; yet for all\
this I have read and learned to admire deeds of derring-do. and to\
imitate acts of courage and heroism, and to despise those which savour\
of meanness, and cowardice, and blackguardism; and so when I see my\
old governor at home, educated as I have been, and no more able to\
come the scholar than I am. yet honoured by the old poor who don't\
go away from his gate unrelieved, and doing his duty by his people, like\
a trump that he is, I hope one day to be like him, and live as he lives,\
and die as he will die, with Hope in his eye, [and many a tear-drop on\
theeyes of those who stand by his grave-side.\
What, good Sir, I should like to ask you, has all his philosophy and\
Greek done this or that Professor, but to unsettle, may be his own\
mind, as it has done that of many of his followers? What good has his\
history done that man which causes him to mis-believe the highest of\
all history? or what good has his arithmetic done that Prelate from\
over the sea, who has Dccomc a subject for Nursery Rhymes, and whose\
books, as they tell me, are the laughing-stocks of scholars? Or, again\'97\
(but I must shut up, or you '11 reject me) to come nearer home; are our\
little female cousins and sisters, or those we hope one day to be nearer\
and dearer still, are they not to be thought of? May we not know how\
to take care of them\'97on the saddle, or the drag, or the boat \'97or when\
by their side, is it only in science that we may venture to open our\
lips? Apropos of these melting moments, is this to be the character of\

combustion going on in the organism?" And she replies, Ah, yes,\
profound disciple of a learned master, and to know further, that as the\
temperature of bodies is increased, so does a proportionate increase in\
bulk accrue." "Ah, Fairest, I had forgotten that! Then should this\
weather last, what a whopper will Mes. Grampus be!"\
But I forbear, Mr. Punch, you have wisdom, you see what I mean,\

QUIET WATERING-PLACES.\
SECOND DAY AT WINKLEBEACH.\
Continue \'97 Tues-\
day Morning. \'97\
Not slept well.\
Complain to\
chambermaid of\
being bitten. She\
asks. "did I go\
on trie beach yes\
terday?" I did.\
"Ah well, great\
many fl**s on the\
beacn. I must\
have brought 'em\
in." Glorious\
weather. Fresh\
sea-breeze com-\
ing in at my bed-\
room window,\
My watch has\
stopped. The\
old clock on the\
stairs strikes five.\
One gets up early\
by instinct here,\
Few nursemaids\
and children\
about, and somebody in the distance bathing. "Early to bed and early\
to rise," &c. Bah! what a smell of stale tobacco and rum in the\
passage: bother the Cricketers and man with banjo. Order breakfast.\
TJpTietimes," say I, affably to the maid. Not earlier than usual.\
Oh! I mustn't mind the clock on the stairs; the works are out of\
order. To-day it's five hours behind. "What will I have for break-\
fast?" Oh, anything. Very good. Prawns and 'winkles.\
11 a.m.\'97Walk out towards the beach. A few fishermen sauntering\
about. After all, this is a quiet place. I lie down and try to count the\
large waves. Little child wants to know what time it is. How can I\
tell? Dear me! here's quite a crowd of gentlemen coming on the\
beach. Excursionists, I'm afraid. No, not gay enough for excur-\
sionists. Surveyors, perhaps: inspectors of breakwaters or fortresses,\
only there are no breakwaters or fortresses. I've got it, they are the\
Gentry who played Cricket against the Trade. Five of the party,\
most respectable elderly gentlemen, suddenly take off their shoes and\
stockings, and dance barefooted in the waves.\
Three others commence leapfrog on the beach. Healthy, but eccen-\
tric. I ask a lounging boatman if the Cricketing gentry do this every\
day P Lounging boatman informs me, "Them aur t Cricketers, them's\
a party brought down, once a week, for a holiday, from the sylum."\
The Asylum P "Ay; them's lunatics."\
I quit the shingle and enter a note. "Winklebeach, with the excep-\
tion of the Cricketers, the Banjo and the Lunatics, is the quietest\
12-30\'97What will I have for dinner to-day? What can I haveP Ob,\
anything. Well, say lamb. It appears that I may say lamb, but can't\
get it. Why not P Because it's Tuesday. As this is a perfectly satis-\
factory reason to the landlady, I content myself with saying, "Oh yes,\
of course," not liking to appear ignorant. Well then, mutton. Not\
mutton to-day, Sir, I'm afraid, because to-morrow's Wednesday. Well,\
a duck or a fowl. A fowl be it.\
Note.\'97" The provisions at Winklebeach must be chosen according to\
the day. The butcher, it appears, kills something or other on Wednes-\
day: it is therefore well to watch the butcher's proceedings closely."\
One o'Cloclc.\'97Bring me luncheon. More prawns, more winkles,\
larger than ever. There is a broad green in front, specially adapted for\
loungers, who do not care about the beach. Dear me! what is that up\
there on a wall An advertisement, as I'm alive! "Flickster's\
Mammoth Circus with an Elephant. Tumbling Clowns, and the Greatest\
Wonder of the World, Little Book! The Grand Spectacle of Blue\
Beard!!!" Have I avoided London and the GasUghted Theatre to\
fall into the clutches of Little Boolu? It cannot be. Yes, it is, though.\
Coming events cast their shadows, and already the little children, freed\
from school, are frisking over the green\'97the lounger's quiet green\'97\
playing at the elephant, the horses, the tumbling clowns, Blue Beard,\
the Mammoth, Little Boolu and the Circus in general, by anticipation.\
Note.\'97" Winklebeach, with the exception of," &c. &c. &c.\
2 p.m.\'971 will seek a quiet spot under the cliff, where the circling\
seagull builds its nest, and all is chalk and cheerless. Solitude, I woo\
thee. What are those two boys doing with that gun P Climbing about\
with the deadly weapon at full cock. Hallo! Hi! don't point it this\
way. The ruffians laugh. They pretend that they mistook my white\
wide-awake for a seagull. Here s twopence not to let off that gun\
near me. They take the twopence and promise. Good boys. Pop!\
bang! I knew it. They saw a gull and fired. Saw a gull! Yes, I\
should think they did.\
2'30.\'97Back to luncheon. From my window I see somebody in a\
uniform. "We shall be quite lively this afternoon," says the landlady.\
Lively! Horrid idea. What does the good woman mean P "Why,\
there's to be artillery practice and volunteer firing on the ramparts."\
The ramparts ?" Yes, I can see the ramparts from my window." So\
I can, there's one cannon on them, and a flagstaff. Do they often fire\
the cannon P No, not often; but they will to-day.\
3'30.\'97Volunteers take possession of Lounging Green. Every one\
comes out to see them. There are six volunteers and a corporal. There\
is a grand review. They charge the corporal, and storm the ramparts.\
\
open a book\
4 30.\'97All over. Every one gone to dinner [or tea. Perfect calm.\
Shall write and read. After all, Winklebeach is a very quiet\'97ah\'97\
what\'97An Organ!\'97An Organ!!! playing La mia Letizia very slowly.\
Can't he be sent away? Sent away, indeed. Residents pay him to\
come and amuse them periodically. There is a crowd already ronnd\
the grinning Italian; all the Winklebeach windows are open, and trade\
generally is suspended. Away! Away! Over the Downs into the\
Weald of Sussex! Away! Away!\
6.\'97I have been caught in the rain on the Downs, and have returned\
for dinner. Good duck. Organ-grinder gone. The wind has changed,\
and I fancy I smeU.drains. On inquiry I find 1 am right.\
8.\'97After dinner, the Winklebeach Volunteer brass band play on the\
Green. The organ was better than this. The landlady thinks "they\
don't play so bad, considerin'." Send for the bathing-hackney-machine-\
coach. I'm off. There ain't no more trains to-night. Houp-la, tckk!\
Here's the Circus coming in; five caravans and another brass band.\
Everyone comes to the old Inn. The Organ-man has not gone away!\
the Man with Banjo returns, the Artillery-men come in to drink, the\
Volunteer band fraternise with the Circus band, and all assemble, in the\
tap-room under my sitting-room, for an orgie.\
9 30.\'97I will avoid them and he on the beach in the stilly night, f It\
is no use, out of doors they are setting up Circus tents, and the\
hammering is unbearable. Their camp-fires smoke and their lamps\
smell.\
10T1.\'97In my room. Tea. Hang the prawns! take away the\
'winkles! The bands playing in the room Delow, talking, singing,\
shouting, jingling of glasses and shuffling of feet. I ring my bell five\
times, and am not attended to. Will this noise last long r No, not\
long, most of the gentlemen (save the mark !) are going to bed. So it\
appears! Bang bang bang, stamp stamp, scuffle scuffle, up the stairs\
about twenty of them apparently. "Good night, Bill! Good night,\
Jim!" Bang bang bed room doors. Row up-stairs, some onegot into\
somebody's room by mistake. Bang bang, scuffle scuffle. "Which is\
my room ? "\'97" Where's the candle!"\'97' Don't make that noise!"\
(This request is shouted at the top of somebody's voice.)\'97" Hallo1\
Hi!"\'97" You're disturbing the house, Jim."\'97"Ha! ha! ha!"-\
"Here's my room," bang bang.\'97" Here's mine!" bang bang\'97\
"Here are our rooms," bang bang bang bang bang, ad lid. Thank\
heavens! While all sleep I can read Zimmermann On Solitude, and calm\
my agitation. They've Degun throwing the boots out into the passage.\
More jumping and kicking and stamping overhead. The Circus Acro-\

own native Volunteer band, its own Cannon, its weekly Cricket\
matches, its evening convivialities, is naturally one of the quietest"\
Out, out, brief candle.\
One o'Clock.\'97I relight my candle, in order to try and catch a con-\
founded moth that won't let me go to sleep. Over the bed; on to the\
drawers; I've got him, with a toweLlon the wall: no, I haven't. Hang\
the brute, I've fallen oyer the hip-bath. Somebody stamping above;\
knocking at wall. "Will I be good enough to make less noise, as no\
one can get to sleep." 'Pon my word, that's cool. The moth is now\
secured under a tumbler. Such a specimen for naturalists, as big as a\
mouse; a marine moth; something Detween a large prawn and a bat:\
peculiar to Winklebeach, I hope.\

HEAVY CHARGE.\
Sot William Armstrong's monster gun\
At Shoeburyness resounds.\
To try what damage can be done,\
And bang! goes forty pounds.\
Good forty pounds at every shot;\
Consider of it well;\
And also full as much, if not\
Much more, for every shell.\
What's there to show for this expense\
Of powder and of ball?\
Hole in a shield, the model fence\
Of Ironsides; that's all,\
Save proof that if, with skilful aim,\
The gun were levelled true,\
And Ironsides invading came,\
'Twould riddle her sides too.\
In peace, for practice, we must fight\
Imaginary foes,\
Since war is ever in our sight;\
That's how the money goes.\
But how, against invading fleet,\
Much faster it would go\
Had we an enemy to beat\
At forty pounds a blow!\
Suppose your gunner's aim to fail,\
As oft the case may be;\
Your forty pounds, of no avail,\
Go plump into the sea.\
To such a tune if war require\
Our giant guns to play,\
Some hundred millions we shall fire\
In little time away.\
But will the bolt, so pitched aright,\
(Which sometimes may betide,)\
As foreign Ironsides to smite,\
And penetrate her side,\
Do damage in a measure such\
As due proportion bounds?\
For oh! it should do very much\
Indeed for forty pounds.\
Bomb, certain Ironsides to smash,\
For dog-cheap we should hold,\
Though more its charge were worth, in cash,\
Than fulminating gold.\
Therewith, come whosoe'er might come,\
Prepared we could remain,\
Nor need keep firing off the sum\
Of forty pounds in vain.\
THE GREEK AND DANISH QUESTIONS.\
That pious, but liberal and enlightened journal, the Kreuz-ZeUung,\
the celebrated organ of constitutional government in Germany, ascribes\
the misfortunes which, in the dismemberment of Denmark, have\
befallen Christian IX, to a judgment wherewith that monarch has\
been visited by Heaven, because he allowed his son George to accept\
the throne of Greece, vice Otho, expelled. The journal of the Cross\
demands to know what right George had,to it? and asks:\'97\
'Have not the victories of DUppel and Alien riven the answer of the living God\
to the Cavuurist policy of Kino Christian at Athens!"\
Because, argues the Kreuz-Zeitung, Christian let George become\
the sovereign of the Greek people, who had deposed Otho, and whom\
Otho had abandoned, therefore Christian robbed Otho of Greece;\
and for having robbed Otho of Greece, Divine Justice suffered him to\
be robbed, in his turn, of Schleswig and Holstein. This argument\
shows how cleverly a journal of high principle can combine the respect\
due to crowned heads with the rebuke of rascality. If King Christian\
was robbed of Schleswig and Holstein, who were the thieves P And if\
the peaceful acceptance of the Greek crown was a robbery, were not\
the victories by which Duppel and Aken were taken, robbery aggra-\
vated by murder? and who are they that were both thieves and mur-\
derers? An answer to these questions may be returned at the conve-\
nience of the Emperor op Austria and the King op Prussia.\
ISN'T HE IN A RAGE?\
"Anger," says quaint old Fuller, "is one of the sinews of the soul,\
and he that hath it not hath a maimed mind." This Irish advertiser\
must be a sinewy party:\'97\
DOG LOST.\'97Stolen on Sunday last, about two o'clock, from Compton\
House, Rialto-bridge, Grand Canal, a very small rod Terrier, with cropped ears\
and tail; very strong made. Whoever restores him will be rewarded, but God help\
any one he is found with after this notice.\
The advertisement was in the Dublin Dailv Exprest, and contrary to\
our wont, we give the address as per original, being perfectly scared at\
the thundering denunciation, and anxious to prevent any fellow creature\
from encountering the advertiser's fiery wrath. Sena the dog back,\
whoever yon are that has got it. if you think that the owner is as\
"strong made" as the beast. Send him. back, if he were twice as\
small. Hurry, now!\
First Warning.\
The Bankers of London have made an arrangement by which their\
unfortunate clerks will be prevented from leaving work on Saturdays\
until four o'clock. This won't do. We know a bank on which the\
wild thyme grows, but we decline to know any bank in which time is\
dealt with in this wild manner. The new Order must be cleared out of\
the Clearing House, or Mr. Punch will make such an awful run upon\
the bankers as will astonish their weak minds. What can they be\
dreaming of, to think that he will stand such tyranny P They must\
rescind tneir order, or set their houses in ditto. Punch.\
A FEDERAL HERCULES.\
One set-off against the evils and horrors of war is the development\
which it gives to moral and physical qualities. The following wonderful\
instance of heroism and bodily prowess, engendered by the great\
struggle in which the contending States of America are engaged, is\
related by the New York Times:\'97\
"Superhuman Fkat.\'97Major Shay, of the 22nd Indiana, was severely wounded,\
but subsequently took prisoner the Colonel of the 33rd Arkansas, and swam with\
him across Peachtree Creek."\
When we consider that, in order to swim with his prisoner across\
Peachtree Creek, the Major must have taken the Colonel in his mouth,\
we are enabled to form some idea of the effort which the performance\
of that prodigy must have cost him. On the other hand, we are called\
upon to admire the Colonel's chivalry, in submitting, under the obliga-\
tion of his parole of honour, to be carried quietly over the water by his\
captor like a duck by a Newfoundland dog.\
GALLANTRY OF BRITISH JURYMEN.\
Commenting on a recent action of breach of promise of marriage,\
brought by a man of fifty-five against a woman ot sixty-nine, and con-\
ducted in a Court of Justice at Leeds exactly as it might have been,\
less cigars and brandy-and-water, by a Judge and Jury Club in a pot-\
house, the Morning Pott very pertinently asks, what is the reason why,\
whilst female plaintiffs, in such cases, receive handsome damages, male\
plaintiffs get laughed at, and nothing besides but an amount of damages\
represented, according to the customary suggestion of counsel, by "the\
smallest denomination of coin known in the country?"\
The reason is, that petty jurymen are mostly fathers and brothers,\
who want to get their own daughters and sisters off their hands, but\
wish their male relations not to marry.\
A Laughable Image.\
To protect the so-called Achilles Statue in Hyde Park, from whose\
plinth some letters have been removed, from further damage, a corre-\
spondent of the Builder suggests that it should be surrounded with "a\
sunk ha-ha fence." The statue in question, being supposed by con-\
noisseurs of sculpture to be not that of the son of Pbleus, but to repre-\
sent a common gladiator, and having also, as it stands, a highly\
ludicrous appearance, has always, when encompassed by a circle of\
spectators, a sufficient ha-ha around it.\
A Representative Man.\
Said Pam, at, and of, Tiverton :\'97\
"We all know that those who aro past thoir childhood (especially those of the fair\
sex) retain their good looks to a later period of life than is often thoir lot in other\
parts of the world. (Lauyhltr and cheers.\}'\
It is not announcing a truism to say that Lord Palmerston is the\
Representative of Tiverton.\
PRETTT BUTTERFLY I\
Alexandre Dumas is writing a book called Essenet of Religion.\
What a subject for a Frenchman, and a French novelist f He must\
have made some strange mistake, and fancied that religion is some kind\
of perfume, sold on the Boulevards. Tell him, somebody.\

RESPONSIBILITY AND NUMBER ONE.\
Some time ago, certain officers in Ireland, having, in the discharge of their duty, to quel! a\
mob, ordered the men to (ire on it, and so killed some of it. A Coroner's jury charged them\
with wilful murder. On this charge they were allowed to be brought to trial. They were\
acquitted of it, indeed, but they had had to endure the horror of a trial for their lives, and to\
incur the cost of their defence. This was calculated to make all officers, civil as well as\
military, take care how they quelled a mob lor the future. The results of the salutary lesson\
thus impressed on authorities we have just seen at Belfast. Enforcement of responsibility\
can have no other effect on sane people than that of making them resolve to do nothing for\
which they can possibly become responsible. Responsibility is surely intended to make folks\
take care to be safe. How can a strictly logical Public complain that it answers its purpose P\
Exact strict responsibility for all blunders, mistakes, and errors of judgment. But then,\
if you want anybody but a fool to run the least risk in serving you\'97don't you wish you may\
get him? IIow nice to enjoy both the satisfaction of exacting responsibility, and also the\
advantage derived from daring! How equally nice would be the cake which you could cat\
and keep too!\
A WORD TO A WESTRY.\
A New Medical Officer is wanted in Marylebone. Upwards of two hundred doctors have\
designated their distinguished! brother, Dr. Hassall, as the man for the place. That these\
educated gentlemen, who have the best means of forming a judgment on the subject, should\
have made the suggestion, has enraged that awful body the Marylebone Vestry. This\
splutters and swaggers, and taking advantage, in the pettiest manner, of a word the doctors\
have used\'97the word everybody else uses in regard to the Vestry in question\'97"delegates,"\
the terrible Vestrymen denounce the Medical Profession for its interference. Now, if Mary-\
lebone were Iloundsditch, or the New Cut, or any place where adulteration and fraud In\
trade were the rule and not the exception, we could understand the hatred of t radesmen for a\
man like Dr. Hassall, who has shown up very mercilessly the merciless tricks of shop-\
keepers. But the tradesmen who form the majority of the Marylebone Vestry are of a high\
class, and cannot be suspected of ill-will towards an cxposer of disgraceful practices. Still,\
it looks fishy to see Trade banded against Hassall, and for the sake of the "good taste\
of which these swell parochials are so justly proud, Punch thinks that they should listen\
to the Profession on a subject which it must understand better than they can.\
The Noble Army of Yankees.\
It is said that a German worthy, named Karl von Essenghen, at New York, has devised\
a plan for intercepting the Victoria, communicating with MCller, and enabling him to escape\
in a fishing-boat and enlist in the Army of the United States, for a bounty to be pocketed by\
Mr. von Essenghen. If Mr. Muller did really murder Ma. Bkiggs, he will be just the\
sort of recruit for the Federal Army.\
A VISIT TO THE PROMENADE\
CONCERTS.\
(Air.\'97" The Low-backed Car.")\
To Mr. Mellon's Concerts,\
I went the other day;\
(I should say night), 'twas that I might,\
Hear his musicians play;\
But the Programme told me what I had.\
Before that time not known,\
That among the men was Ali Ben,\
Who would play on his Turkophone.\
Now what was his Turkophone?\
I couldn't make out, I own;\
I asked all around, but no one could be found,\
Who was up to the Turkophone.\
I'd heard Carlotta Patti,\
Miss Htjddart well I knew,\
And a German maid, who sweetly played\
On the grand pianny, too;\
And Mr. Levy who had\
Charmed Louis on his throne;\
But somehow very few had\
Ever heard of a Turkophone.\
Now what was a Turkophone?\
I couldn't make out, I own;\
I asked all around, but no one could be found,\
Who was up to the Turkophone.\
I didn't mind Rossini,\
I wearied of Mozart;\
And the worst of bores 1 considered the pause,\
'Twixt the first and second part.\
I grew so agitated that,\
I scarce could stand alone;\
And I cried out, "When will Ali Ben\
"Come and play on his Turkophone?"\
Oh, what is a Turkophone?\
I cannot make out, I own.\
Is it wind, is it string, oh what sort of a thing,\
Is this wonderful Turkophone?\
'Twas very near eleven,\
Mr. Mellon gives a rap:\
And a man in a fez cries out, "Oh, ycz,"\
Like a foreign sort of chap.\
And then was the great Ali Ben,\
To the English public shown;\
He was dressed in his best, in a Turkish vest,\
And he carried the Turkophone.\
But was it the Turkophone P\
I couldn't make out, I own.\
'Twas a lute, or a flute, or a hautboy; but no boy\
Could swear 'twas the Turkophone.\
He handled it so neatly\
Before the list'ning crowd,\
And he piped and wiped, and he wiped and\
piped,\
Then looked around and bowed.\
And the people all applauded,\
For he brought out such a tone,\
And the man at the harp had to look very sharp\
To keep up with the Turkophone.\
As he tootled the Turkophone,\
The player on the trombone\
Put his hand to Lis car, and t hen let fall a tear\
As he grinned at the Turkophone.].\
'Twas the Last of Summer Roses\
He played, and then I smiled, i\
When very soon we lost the tune\
In his variations wild.\
So away we went to supper,\
For hungry had we grown,\
And ordered some "Fizz," which the right\
thing is\
1 With a devilled Turkeybone.\
That wonderful Turkophone!\

AN IRISH MARE'S NEST.\
The Mayor of Belfast, a grocer named Lytle, has been awfully\
wigged by the Marquis of Donegall, Provincial Grand Master of\
Masons, for absence from Belfast during the recent scenes of savagery.\
The grocer says he wasn't well, but did not leave his duty until the\
night of the day on which the riots began, besides which, in anticipation\
of a fray, he had called in 150 extra policemen. Then he went to Har-\
rogate. Now we do not expect grocers to be logicians, and we are\
quite content when they sell us good currants and coffee at a fair price.\
But when they turn Mayors, and begin to "hargyfy," we must apply\
the test usual in dealing with the utterances of great men. If Ms.\
Lytle thought that there was any chance of a row, he ought to have\
stayed; if he did not think so, why did he send for extra peelers? How-\
ever, what he lacks in logic he makes up Irish fashion, declaring himself\
to be a very grand kind of man, and taunting Lord Donegall with not\
having done his, the Mayor's, own business. Clearly he ought to have\
been a valiant Mayor\'97like our own Sir William Walworth\'97snatched\
up his mace (not that which he keeps in the drawer with the ginger),\
beaten a drum (not a drum of his excellent figs), and caused the rioters\
on both sides to "nap pepper." The Marquis has put the saddle on\
the right horse, but Belfast has put the gown on the wrong mayor.\
Amends to Leicester.\
The Balloonatics of Leicester are incensed with Mr. Punch for\
having hinted that people who elect a certain kind of orator should have\
been kinder to a Wind-bag. They inform him, haughtily, first, that\
Mr. Coxwell's balloon was not destroyed by Leicester men, but by\
excursionists, and secondly that Leicester wants no dictation as to its\
choice of a representative. If the former statement be true, we will\
pardon the little escape of electoral gas manifested in the second, the\
rather that the Leicester men are subscribing pennies to buy the gallant\
aeronaut a new balloon\'97a most graceful way of skying their coppers.\
OUR OWN REVIEW.\
A New Poem with an old title has just come under our notice. It\
is called The " Lay" of the Last Minstrel, and is very properly dedicated\
to Mr. Bass, M.P. The introduction is very fine, and the allusion, in\
the third line, to\'97\
"His withered chuk"\
no less poetical than true. The organman's cheek is, we trust, rapidly\
diminishing:\'97\

Who sang of Babdaoe chivalry.\
For well-a-day 1 their date was fled,\
His tuneful brethren all wero dead,\
And he, by just police suppressed,\

may get it.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARiVAKl.\
\
A VISIT TO MYNHEER VAN DUNK.\
ear Punch,\'97As\
a man of very\
varied and exten-\
sive information,\
you doubtless are\
aware that Her\
Majesty Queen\
Anne is dead, and\
that our once\
allies the Dutch\
have taken Hol-\
land. But there\
are certain other\
facts relating to\
that country\
which may very\
likely not have\
come within your\
notice; and I\
should not be sur-\
prised if, in com-\
mon with most\
Englishmen, you\
still labour under\
numerous delu-\
sions as to Dutch-\
land. I dare say\
now you fancy\
that, excepting\
cheese, perhaps,\
there is nothing\
there worth looking at. A few pictures there may be, in the tea-board\
style of art, and here and there a quaint costume, not as yet extinguished\
by the milliners of Paris. Your notion of a Dutchman is taken very\
probably from Knickerbocker's History, and formed upon the model\
of the famous Rip Fan WMel. You imagine him a man about as broad\
as he is long, whose habit is to sit at home all day smoking a huge\
meerschaum, and never opening his fat lips, excepting when his pipe or\
bis stomach may want filling. The sage Dutchmen, you have read,\
when their city was attacked, sat smoking in mute council till the frag-\
rant cloud they blew enveloped all their city, and thus hid it from the\
enemy. Well, Dutchmen certainly do smoke, but they don't smoke\
meerschaums now, and but few clay pipes are visible. The modern\
Rip Fan WMel would most likely go to sleep with a cigar between his\
lips, for cigars are now in vogue with all smokers in Holland. Soldier,\
sailor, tinker, tailor, gentleman, apothecary,* small boy, thief, every one\
you see there is smoking a cigar. Weeds in Holland are as plentiful\
as weeds now in the Thames, and if you have pulled from Oxford lately,\
you can estimate their number without much fear of adding to it. A\
row from Oxford down to Windsor is like rowing through a salad; and\
if the drought should last much longer, I expect to hear that Croquet\
has been played upon the river, ana the regatta reach at Henley lias\
been chosen for a cricket-match.\
Put aside, then, if you please, your old Knickerbocker notions, and\
learn that Dutchmen now, excepting that they mostly shave, are vastly\
like to Englishmen. Tollite barbarum !" Away with the barber!" has\
been our cry of late, but is not echoed yet by Dutchmen. A moustache\
is here the rule, in Holland the exception; and, so far as 1 could see, a\
beard is very seldom reared there. The Dutch are not more silent than\
ourselves, and are scarcely greater smokers; and in many of their ways\
\'97their love of home comforts, for instance, and their industry in busi-\
ness\'97they show a strongly-marked resemblance to the English. They\
eat roast beef, and they drmk beer, and go to clubs to read the news-\
paper, in a manner not much different from that of most Great Britons.\
Their country is in fact a sort of foreign England, and any English\
visitor soon finds himself at home there. On the whole, I think their\
churches and their other public buildings quite as ugly as our own;\
and though they pay a little more regard to picturesqueness in then-\
houses, these do not look a whit less likely than our own to yield a\
comfortable dwelling-place. As a rule, their rooms seem far more lofty\
than our own; and their front doors are so gigantic that they all seem\
made for Brobdingnags. Not being a business man, I could not value,\
as it merited, the vastness of their warehouses; but I delighted to\
observe how beauty in their architecture blended with utility, and how\
the decorated gable ends, on which such pains and paint had been care-\
fully bestowed, were all furnished with a hook to haul up\'97if not mer-\
chandise\'97chairs, chests of drawers, and dinner tables.\
Not for the world would 1 throw doubt upon the dicta of our Bishops.\
But the Bishop who informed us, in the joDiest of glees, that our friend\

\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  Whon you write to your Dutch friends, you should spell this 11 apotheek," and\
yon may ask why the apotheeks always have a ghastly-carved head stuck outside\
their shops, with the mouth gaping its widest, as though taking a big pill t\
Mynheer Van Dunk "drank brandy-and-water gaily," and daily\
quenched his thirst with half a gallon of that spirit, 1 iiear can hardly\
be relied on for correctness in his statement. If, however, it be true,\
Mynheer Van Dunk must have been quite an exception to the rule\
which Dutchmen practise in their drinking. Beer is their chief tipple,\
and the few who call for spirits, take Schiedam, not brandy. II you go\
into a Koffijhuis, you find that eight in ten, at least, are drinking beer,\
while the other two most probably are sipping lemonade, or some mild\
drink of that sort. I never saw a drunken man in my week's visit;\
and, indeed, the beer which is commonly consumed seems hardly to be\
capable of producing drunkenness. Poor, thin, wishywashy stuff it is,\
not better than our swipes," and has but very little flavour excepting\
what is nasty. I pity Dutchmen for their living so remote from Bass\
and Aisorp, and for their distance from the nectar brewed by Char-\
rington or Truman. I think a British Beer Exporting Company\
should in charity be started for the benefit of Dutchmen, to enlighten\
their poor minds by showing what good stuff from malt and hops can\
be extracted. Care, however, must be taken that the barrels and the\
bottles be not tampered with in transit, and then refilled with German\
wishwash. Of all the tricks in trade I think this the most odious.\
What torture can be greater than to get a bottle marked with the red\
pyramid of Bass, and to find that it contains some continental nasti-\
ness? I experienced this agony myself at Amster-hem! (as the genteel\
lady called it), and was charged a guilder for the disappointment. Of\
course, big brewers cannot stoop to bottle their own Deer; but they\
might appoint their bottlers, and make them use stamped corks, and\
then Englishmen abroad would not be duped as I was. Marked bottles\
may, of course, be emptied and refilled with any vat-rinsings and cask-\
dregs; but marked corks, when once drawn, could not be used again,\
and I would make it penal to imitate the stamp on them.\
I have said that Holland often reminded me of England, but the beer\
I tried to drink there certainly did little to refresh my recollection. At\
the same hotel, however, where I was duped so Bass-Iy, my native land\
was strongly brought into my memory. I arrived on Sunday evening,\
as weary and as hungry as a long Dutch sermon, followed by a short\
journey, could make me. "Waiter! garcon! Jan!" said X in nay\
best Dutch, '* I want some dinner, sharp now! Vat haben you to\
giben me P" I thought he looked a Dutcnman, so I gave myself the\
trouble to speak in his own language. But, beslirew me! the knave\
answered, "Dinnersir? yessir. 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 \'95 Whatwouldyoupleaseto'avesir?" just\
as though I had arrived at any swell hotel in England. "Oh, well," I\
replied, a little disappointed at not having to talk Dutch, "I want\
something nice and foreign, un diner du pays, voyez-vous," said I; for\
when travelling abroad I never lose a chance of trotting out my French,\
albeit that plain English may be vastly more intelligible. "Furrin-\
dtnnerP Yessir. Bringyouabiledfowlsir, horwouldy'pleaseto'averoast-\
beef P" Boiled fowl or roast beef! Wasn't that a pretty dish to set\
before an Enslishman, whose main desire in travelling was to expel all\
thoughts of England, and live a foreign life! But I was much too\
hungry to move any amendment of this wretched bill of fare, and so I\
sat and vainly tried to think myself abroad the while I ate roast beef\
off a dinner-plate marked " Wedgwood," served on an Irish table-cloth,\
and carved with a Sheffield knife and fork.\
I have another word or two to say about the Dutch, so I beg leare to\
subscribe myself, yours, dear Punch, eternally (until the middle of\
next week, say),\

"BEES ARE HUMMING, I AM COMING."\
We think that a line has accidentally slipped out of the last letter from\
the Bee-Master. He says that critics of the wasp kind are delighted\
when they can discover a trumpery blemish in the works of Tennyson\
or Longfellow. Has not the printer managed to omit the words that\
should follow\'97something of this kind, " or detect a careless lapsus in a\
Lecture on Prophecy." Eh, Dr. Bee-Master? Nevertheless your\

CLUB CONVERSATION\
(FOR THE TIME OF YEAR).\
Scene\'97Beading Room of the Club. Solitary Member, who has read\
all the papers, serials, and magazines, is discovered sitting at writing-\
table, trying to remember some one to whom he owes a Utter; as writing\
to anybody is more sociable than speaking to nobody. Door opens,\
and enter, cautiously, De Feu le.\
Sol. Member (.laying down his pen and elevating his eyebrows). Hallo!\
De Feble (as if intensely surprised). What, you here!\
Sol. Mem. (rising, with outstretched hand, and in his heartiest manner):\
How are you?\
De Feble (making the usual satisfactory reply). How are you?\
During the Season, De Feble nods, and iust manages to recognise\
the existence of Solitary Memeer, and the latter speaks of the former\
as " that conceited puppy De Feble, whom he should like to kick," or\
words to that effect. But now, in the desolation of a St. James's Street\
Club, it is a hand to grasp, a human voice with a word of sympathetic\
welcome, even though that hand be nothing but a paw, and the voice a\
yelp, which by a logical development of tne canine simile they both\
very well might be.\
Sol. Mem. (returning to his seat, making as though his letter was of\
great consequence in order to give De Feble the idea that business detains\
him in Town). Well\'97and so\'97you\'97 (after the first glow of heartiness\
there comes over them both, but more especially over the one who has made\
the first advance, an indefinable chill)\'97you\'97(hits on a bright idea)\'97\
you 're in Town, are you r\
De Feble (rather ashamed of himself, and'not liking to admit the\
fact all at once, says dubiously). Well\'97yes. But\'97 am\'97(clears his\
fashionable reputation at the expense of his veracity), I'm going down\
into the country to-night.\
Sol. Mem. Ah! (Wishes he could say so, too; thinks he will say so.)\
I'm a\'97(becomes nervous, and thinks he won't), at least I'm not going\
away yet awhile.\
De Feble \{feeling that he has got the advantage over his acquaintance\
now). Ah! I shall be away for some time.\
Sol. Mem. (fidgeting with his pen). Ah! (vaguely), going to Hertford-\
shire P\
De Feble (with some uncertainty). No, no, (as much as to say that he\
could go to Hertfordshire if he pleased). I shall get some shooting at my\
Uncle's, and so forth, as usual.\
[Shrugging his shoulders as if the arrangements bored him.\
Sol. Mem. (Smiling thoughtfully). Yes. (Looks serious and wonders\
what the deuce he was smiling at.) Yes.\
[Begins to watch the few people in the street.\
De Feble (tracking back). $es. I shall be off to-night, (knocking his\
cane on the floor) or to-morrow morning, early.\
[Watchespeople in the street.\
Sol. Mem. Ah\'97yes\'97er\'97. [Bites pen.\
De Feble. Well\'97or (looks at his watch), let me see, I must\'97\
[Mumbles something to himself.\
Sol. Mem. Um\'97am\'97\
[Tears up apiece qf paper, and makes a show of commencing a letter.\
De Feble. Well\'97er\'97 (as if about to say something of great importance\
which he had left for the last moment)\'97Good bye.\
Sol. Mem. Good bye. (Nods pleasantly, but omits the ceremony of\
shaking hands.)\
Exit De Feble, making a mental memorandum to the effect that lie\
must not,for his own credit's sake, enter the Club again for some\
De Feble partly regrets within himself that he did not ask the Soli-\
tary One if he was going to "dine at the Club\'97and go anywhere;"\
but he cannot do that now, so he feeds at some remote restaurant, or\
in his own chambers with himself and his Familiar Humbug.\
Solitary Member entertains a better feeling towards De Feble\
after this interview, than he ever did before. For De Feble's\
blooming companions being all out of Town, the natural man is peeping\
out through the artificial man; the buckram Court dress of the season\
has been taken off, and De Feble goes easily in his smoking coat. And\
so it comes to pass, that, in the letter which Solitary Member does\
pen to a friend out of Town, this sentence stands recorded\'97" I met\
De Feele in Town to-day. He's not such a bad fellow, after all." So\
these two men are, both of them, the better for being chucked against\
one another, by an unfashionable Fate, in this entr'acte time of the year.\
The Weather.\
The storm which was in London on a Sunday, visited several parts\
of the Country during the week. It was heartily welcomed wherever\
it dropped in. This sounds all very well, and is of course at this season,\
the fashionably correct movement; but what, we may ask, will the poor\
bound-down-to-London Londoners do, when even the Wettest Weather\
leaves Town?\
advice.\
How to make a Watch keep time.\'97Hever wind it up, it will then keep\
the same time all the year round.\

sures of the sea-shore, or\
the excitements of foreign\

if you wouldlet me go away,\
and you know that such pro-\

by an errant Contributor.\
Mais tu I'as voulu.\
That Irish agriculturist\
who fed his pig one day and\
starved him the next, and so\
on, in order that the bacon\
might show alternate slices\
of fat and lean, has relieved Admiral Pitzroy at the weather office, for\
everybody is relieved except myself. Yesterday it rained steadily, and\
I was wet through with rain. To-day the sun scorches and\'97antithesis\
demands what delicacy denies\'97let me merely say that I am unpleasantly\
hot. The tradesman who supplies ice to my refrigerator here is of\
course at Hastings or Dieppe, at all events he lias sent me no ice. Yet\
I paid his bill, at his request, a fortnight ago. The next time he wants\
to leave town, he need not depend upon my aid to put him in funds.\
I will pay his ice-bill at Christmas, and console him for the delay with a\
jest touching the fittingness of things. I drink your health in luke-\
warm soda-water, and you may imagine the attendant good wishes.\
Last week I gently complained, or rather I faintly murmured, because\
of many hardships. I hinted that by enforcing my sojourn in town at\
such a time you were debilitating the finest intellect in your service.\
1 regret to say that you are answerable for a still worse state of things.\
I have become addicted to play. Among the fluctuating population of\
five who now pervade the Club, three play whist, or imagine that they\
do so. They conspired on Thursday to induce me to join them, and I\
was, as our humbler fellow-creatures sav, "that helpless," that I tore\
myself from the Annual Register for 1?89, and dragged myself into the\
card-room. I play well, but it is upon a theory of my own, which is\
based upon the principle of paying no at tention to the plav of the others\
at the table. This play is not understood by ordinary minds, and though\
my promptitude at Athanasian repartee prevents persons from frequently\
remonstrating with me, I perceive that my play is disagreeable to my\
companions. This is some compensation, I allow, for my misfortunes,\
but it is only a sentimental compensation, and is not much in account\
against the loss of six, eight, and nine pounds, odd shillings, lost by me\
on three afternoons respectively. I believe, at least, that such will be\
the opinion of Mils. Epicurus, to whom, on the remote chance of a\
wife's troubling herself to read her husband's rubbish, I hereby break\
the pleasing news. The fault, if there be any, of course is entirely your\
own, for had you allowed me to be at. Scarborough with my family, as\
would beseem a husband and a father, I should not have been playing\
whist with the heartless at the Opossum Club. I do not know whether\
I shall play again to-morrow, but very likely there will be an addition\
to the load on your editorial conscience, and to the demand which I\
shall have to make upon you as the Chancellor of Mr. Punch's Exchequer.\
And I will add, though that obstinate idiot, Snoozer, couldn't or\
wouldn't see it, and wickedly provoked me into using bad language by\
his persistency, I was right at the end of the .game, as second hand,\
remaining with tenace in trumps and king of another suit guarded,\
eldest hand holding minor tenace and the corresponding ace, and leading\
the ace, I was right, I say (and Snoozer be hanged) to sacrifice my\
king, because then I brought it to an equal chance whether I won three\
or two tricks; whereas, il I had held Daek king, three couldn't have\
been made: and if you don't see this, you are as numb a hand as\
Snoozer, and I don't care a red cent what CffiLEBS says, or anybody\
else.\
I meant to go and see the balloon start from the Crystal Palace one\
day last week, and to have described the ascent, in order to give you\
something novel and exciting, but I forgot the affair on the very day.\
i You may have remarked, or you may not, and you may accept the pro-\
found observation in lieu of the graphic detail that would otherwise\
have tilled this paragraph, that when one is exceedingly busy with all\
'one's intellectual steam at high pressure, an able man, like myself, never\
| forgets anything, and a score of important things are all attended to at\
the right moment and in .the best manner. Whereas, when one has\
nothing to do, except one or two things, the chances are that they are\
forgotten, or dawdled over, and dealt with in an unsatisfactory way.\
This is illustrated in London and Provincial life. An active Londoner,\
with all his hours crowded, finds time to write or answer letters. A\
bucolic party, with abundant leisure, can never find time to write when\
he ought, and invariably begins his letter with some excuse for delay;\
a parson called, or a pig had to be killed, or there was no ink,\
Goody Brown's children h*d got the hooping-cough and ne had visited\
them and feared to send aontagion in the letter. But about the balloon.\
Perhaps it was as well I did not go, for in my state of mind a very little\
would have tempted me to ascend with Mr. CoXWell. I did (joup\
once from Cremorne Gardens with Mr. Green, and never enjoyed\
myself more, especially the ooming back from Erith marshes, (where we\
landed,) in a damp old mouldy omnibus, drawn by two cart-horses.\
Perhaps there be men, now decorous and rotund like myself, who\
remember that night, and whether night or morning looked upon the\
returned voyagers when they emerged from a roaring eqfe (we wittily\
and monosyllabically called it eafe) near the rcapeciad Bucksto.ve's\
theatre. But my second voyage might not have been so prosperous,\
and what would you have thought of yourself then, to say nothing of\
the compensation which my executors would have exacted from you in\
the interest of that female at Scarborough?\
I You will be happy to know that tlie Thames Embankment is going\
on well. The incessant fall of the Monkey, and the equally incessant\
bawling and swearing of the intelligent operatives, whom I take to be\
mainly of the Irish persuasion, now disturb not my aooustomed ears,\
but about onoe in every two hours I hear a preternatural row, and then\
1 know that a horse and oart have been cast into the Thames in company\
with the load which it had been intended to add to the bank. Some-\
times horse and cart are dragged out, amid shouts and execrations that\
might be heard from the Temple to Greenwich (where I have not dined\
once this year), but at other times I incline to believe that the animal,\
being drowned, is interred in the Embankment, and laid away for a few\
cent uries, at the end of which his bones will be dug out, ana set up in\
the British Museum at Kensington, in evidence that the English of the\
Victorian age buried horses with funeral rites, and could have been by\
no means the Christians they described themselves in the leading\
articles and sermons of the period. By the way, I suspect, entre uui,\
that we, the Victorians, may be somewhat roughly handled by posterity\
for one or two other matters about which we are rather complacent,\
and I think, therefore, that we are wise in our generation in\
praising ourselves as much as possible (as we do on the slightest pro-\
vocation), while we have the opportunity. We are a great and glorious\
people, but I wish we could manage to do posterity out of the law ana\
criminal reports and a few other records of the day. However, my om\
writings will tell to all time that while I was proud of the progress o:\
my country, I was not blind to her errors, winch I always sought to\
correct.\
You will probably ask me, in the private note enclosing your cheque\
how 1 spent my Sunday. I reply by anticipation to this unjustifiable\
demand, by stating that I do not consider you entitled to inquire. That\
day is a holiday, even to me. It is a holiday to all except to the thou-\
sands engaged in getting up the daily papers for Monday. I hope the\
Sabbatarians are aware of the exception, and that every dweller a:\
j Clapham or any other pious neighbourhood, who reads a paper on Mon-\
day, knows that he or she is an accomplice in what he or she considers\
criminal. The Sunday papers are all prepared on Saturday, but the\
, newspaper, the absence ol which on Monday morning'would, I few,\
( cause considerable ill-temper in the families and at the counting-houses\
of the patrons of Exeter Hall, is produced by the literary and mechani-\
cal labour of Sunday. No humbug can do away with this fact; and\
until Sabbatarianism registers and keeps a vow never to read a Monday\
newspaper, Sabbatarianism is just as wicked as the evil barber who\
shaves the mechanic before the bells ring.\

district church being closed for repairs, and 1 having been severely\
admonished by more than one bishop of my acquaintance upon the duty\
I of keeping to my parish, I permitted my one remaining servant (<"0\
disclaimed any such scruples) to leave our house in my charge, and to\
go to her own church. I hope she did. She took extraordinary paue\
j with her toilette, and I observed that she was joined, at the corner ut\
the Square, by a smiling young man. simply and elegantly attired, whose\
red waistcoat, blue cravat, and yellow gloves had quite a floral elect\
upon the eye. The discourse they attended must have been l\'b0DS'P\

their own dull sermons. For after a course of the close, pithy, pregnant\

STREET-AECHITECTURE.\
Dear Sir,\
I have not visited London for some time, but being'called up to\
the Metropolis on business, Ihave made the best use of my spare moments\
by walking through the great thoroughfares, and noting the present\
vast improvements in Street-Architecture. I was much struck with\
an Ecclesiastical Building in the Strand at the corner of Catherine\
Street. To what order of architecture it belongs I am unable to\
say, but it is, perhaps, a' sort of Scott-Goth-ItalianNorman-Puginesque\
style, which presents to the eye of the spectator a confusing beauty\
entirely its own. It is evidently a Monastery, or a Nunnery; or, on\
second thoughts, it might be a Roman Catholio Chapel, with house\
and schools attached. While thinking the matter over, from the opposite\
side of the way, it suddenly occurred to me that it might be an lrvingite\
place of worship, or something perhaps of the Early-Enjtlish-Italian\
order, built specially, according to some original design, for Brother\
Ignatius. A gentleman also much interested in the subject suggested\
that it was "Baths and Wash'uBes." He said, that he spoke from\
experience, as he has found that almost, alljnew buildings of this fashion\
ultimately turn out to be Bulbs and Wash'uses. Some one tried to\
make me believe that it was intended for a Music Hall. But though I\
may be a young man from the country, yet am I not to be got over in\
that manner. The idea of the Perfect Cure, or the Dark Girl, or any\
other of those vulgarities, being perpetrated within the solemn cloister!\
No, no. It's a Monastery, or a Chapel or Church of some kind, or\
I'm another. On Sunday I attempted to enter what I thought was a\
pretty little Gothic Chapel, not a hundred miles from Leicester Square.\
1 was nearly being taken up by a Policeman for attempting a burglary\
upon the London and Leicester Square Bank! There seems to be some\
want of originality in design among our architects. Let a Chapel be a\
Chape], a Music Hall be a Music Hall, a Bank a Bank, and let me sign\
wself, Yours truly, Little Ben.\
MIXED PUNCH.\
Last week, Mr. Punch received a sensation. The Times published a\
letter, to which were appended some lines, headed Prison Verses. These\
the correspondent stated to have been found on a prisoner in a certain\
gaol. A glance at the verses, which are excessively clever, as Mr.\
Punch's next words will prove, showed him that they were His Own.\
They adorned his columns a few years ago, and are an improvement\
upon Dr. Watts's poem, Whene'er I take my Walks Abroad. Mr.\
Punch's sensation, however, was not one of pride\'97quite the reverse.\
He was filled with sorrow that a man who could and did read Punch,\
should not have been preserved from error, and should have behaved so\
evilly as to have deserved imprisonment. As Mr. Punch moodily\
brooded over this fact, he looked at the verses again, and to his partial\
satisfaction found that some of them had been altered and debased.\
The criminal had studied them from an impure edition. This, of\
course, removes all blame from Mr. Punch. If a doctor prescribes a\
drug, and that, drug be administered in an adulterated form, it is not\
his fault if the patient continues ill. Mr. Punch has sent to the\
governor of the gaol a correct copy, to be given to the prisoner when\
his sentence shall have expired, and no doubt his reformation will then\
be complete.\

A VISIT TO MYNHEER VAN DUNK.\
ear Punch,\'97His Brilliancy\
the Duke of Diamonds was\
staying at the Hague while\
1 was there, but though 1\
sojourned at the same hotel,\
I had not the good fortune\
to see him or his brilliants.\
It was the Haagsche Cou-\
raitt that told me of his pre-\
sence, and on referring to\
the file, I found that for a\
month or so his name had\
been paraded at the head of\
the arrival list. For a mere\
Mister of course but one\
announcement will suffice,\
and he may consider him-\
self in luck if he gets that.\
But a Royal Duke you\
know sheds such a lustre\
on a place, that immense\
care must be taken to tell\
the world his whereabouts.\
I dare say now the jmce of\
lodgings has been rising at\
the Hague, ever since the\
happy day when the Duke\
of Diamonds entered it.\
Some people like the privi-\
lege of living near the rose,\
even though the rose be\
fading and not in the best\
odour. I hear his Brilliancy\
when travelling always takes his diamonds with him, knowing no one\
he can trust enough to leave them with at home. If this be so, I cer-\
tainly don't envy him his jewels; indeed I rather feel my pity rising\
for this poor old royal Sindbarl, whose precious stones must surely\
be a'precious burden to him, well nigh as wearying in travel as the Ola\
Man of the Sea.\
'S Gravenhage, or La Haye, or, as we English say, the Hague, is\
certainly the nicest place to stay at in all Holland, and if you have\
never been there, you will find it worth a visit. It is not so picturesque\
as Rotterdam or Haarlem, which latter town is full of quaint old high-\
peaked gable-ends, that an artist finds it difficult to pass by without\
sketching. At the Hague are finer houses, but of much more modern\
date, and, I scarce need say, a good deal less attractive to one's pencil.\
I think wherever one goes nowadays one finds this is the case, and that\
architects now study comfort more than picturesqueness. The chief\
charm of the Hague, however, is its wood, wherein is not too fine a\
palace, which the King makes his abiding place j wisely giving it the\
preference to the Dam at Am&terditto, where his other palace stands\
and many doubtful smells surround it. Now, there are few things I\
hate more than being dragged to see a Palace. But besides its olever\
frescoes and its curious Japan work, the palace in the wood is worth a\
visit for its ball-room, as is that at Amsterdam\'97which, by the way,\
your Majesty, sadly wants new doors to all the state apartments. Really,\
those I saw were of the scrubbiest and shabbiest. But the ball-room\
there, they told me, is the highest in the world; a hundred feet from\
floor to ceiling! an altitude which, if they please, the young ladies who\
caper there may call the height of luxury.\
At the Hague, the wood I spoke of is quite thick with fine large\
beech-trees, whose shade the sun finds hardly penetrable; and in\
the middle is some water which is grandly called a lake, and by its\
margin some good music is once or twice a week or so performed by a\
good band to the delight of a good audience. Some few square yards\
near the orchestra are railed off for a Societeit, whose members, I pre-\
sume, are payers of the pipers; but elsewhere you may stand or walk or\
sit about and hear good music gratis. I heard a symphony by Men-\
delssohn played here in the open air to at least three thousand\
listeners, who scarce moved foot or tongue until the final note of it.\
They lounged about and chatted while the dance-music wasplayed, but\
when Mbndelssohn began they all intend ora tenebant. We nave no\
big wood in London, where the ground sells by the inch; but a band\
plays in our parks at times, and, as happens at the Hague, many poorer\
folk are pleased by it. But I wonder if a symphony that lasted half-an-\
hour or so would here be heard with so much relish and applauded with\
such vehemence.\
People go to bed in Dutchland at a reasonable hour, and there are\
not many street noises to prevent your sleeping. At the Hague I\
thought the kloppermen, whose business is to keep the peace, were\
liveliest in breaking it. They are armed with clumsy clappers, like\
what boys use to scare the crows with, and these they clap about the\
streets at night, and call out what's o'clock, which people fast asleep\
must find extremely useful. Au reste, I only heard one barrel-organ\
while I was in Holland; but now Mr. Bass's Bill has passed, some of\
our legion may be driven thither. Moreover, the Dutch street-boys\
are less musical than ours, and not so much addicted to bellowing and\
cat-calling. The dogs too are, I fancy, better taught to hold then-\
tongues than they are in this freei country. Still I would not advise\
Toby yet to emigrate to Dutchland. There are real dog-carts there still,\
that is, small carts drawn by dogs (harnessed four abreast sometimes)\
who don't look very happy in them. Besides, as dogs delight occa-\
sionally to bite as well as Dark, Toby would not be allowed to take his\
walks abroad without having a muzzle on. By the way, this talk of\
dogs reminds me that at Omsterdom (as the natives mostly call it) I\
got an Anglo-French-Dutoh dictionary to improve my mind a bit one\
rather rainy morning; and herein, wishing to pick up a useful word or\
two that might serve me while in Holland, under the 1\
suddenly I\
T quite\

I forget what was the Dutch for it. But, will you believe me? there\
was no mention of Toby.' With kind regards to whom, believe me\
yours sincerely, Vaoabondus.\
FORM AND SUBSTANCE.\
(A Poem by a Pat title)\
I "it an ultimate atom of matter,\
And revolve, in a Varying round\
Of relations, from former to latter,\
And back, in and out of the ground.\
Through the River I went to the acre\
From the City, returning in wheat.\
Here I am again, sent, by the baker,\
In the loaf that you 're going to eat.\
All existence is but circulation,\
Up and down, down and up, as before,\
This is that in mere recombination\
We ourselves are ourselves evermore.\
A RECEIPT.\
The Saturday Review quoted the other day an admirable receipt from\
"British and Foreign Spirits," which was called "our own" Punch:\
after giving some very generous directions as to the quantities and\
qualities of rum, sugar, sherry or port, and orange bitter*, it finishes\
with:\'97\
"Fill the tumbler up with boiling water, and stir together."\
Two correspondents write to us, complaining of the hardship attendant\
'upon any attempt at compliance with the last requisition. They used\
aQ the ingredients, multiplied according to the size of their bowl, and not\
only filled, but also emptied their tumblers (they are unable to say how\
many times, but certainly more than once), and then found that to\
"stir together," or indeed to stir at .all, was a physical impossibility.\
Left sitting.\
NOTES AND QUERIES.\
A Railway Committee in 1861, are restoring the Cross of Charing,\
on which a Puritan Committee vented their spite in 1641. It is being\
reared in front of the Grand Hotel. Can any of iyour readers inform\
me as to the truth of the following hypothesis:\'97\
The many Eleanor's Crosses are supposed by some, to have had\
their origin in the frequent bickerings ot the Royal Naggletonians.\
Whenever the Queen lost her temper, as, for instance, she did at\
Waltham, the King quietly observed Eleanor's Cross." Where-\
upon, with a Courtier s officious zeal, a subscription was immediately\
got up by one of the Lords in Waiting, and a lasting memorial of the\
Queen's violence was speedily erected.\

> Short Wriist.\
"Short whist," says a descendant of Mrs. Battle, whose opinions\
on the game are very generally knowa, " is a rubber, where two, out of\
four, are hard-up players, unable to settle their losses. This is very\
"short whist."\
"Long whist," adds this excellent matron, "is Mr. Battle's con-\
stant excuse for coming home from his Club, at four o'clock in the\

"ROMANCE IN A DRAPER'S SHOP."\
So the tale is headed with which Mr. Punch proposes to delight his\
readers. It is told in the Liverpool Courier. But he is obliged to say\
at once that the story is not at all exciting. In fact, there is no\
romance in it, and its sole interest arises from the truly beautiful way\
in which it is told by the Liverpool writer. It affords an illustration\
of the value which a genius can confer upon the most ordinary material,\
by high-class manipulation. A log of wood is worth twopence, but\
that log in the hands of a Grinling Gibbons became something that\
nobles fought for. This adventure of a shopman is nothing, but mark\
how sweetly it is told.\
We begin with a profound thonght :\'97\
11 In an incident that has just occurred in Liverpool we have another evidence of\
how the powerful promptings of a tender heart control the more reflective senses\
of the mind."\
Another evidence. Observe the art of the true artist. Ton have not\
been told by him of any preceding evidence, but by the adroit use of the\
word "another" he compels you to recal all the touching narratives\
which you have ever read, and thus, having saturated you, as it were,\
with romance, he plunges your prepared soul into his own magic\
cauldron. The exquisite and subtle philosophy and psychology of the\
last line need no pointing out\'97you at once behold the marvellous\
machinery of our being, and you see the powerful pumpings\'97we beg\
pardon\'97promptings of the heart working at the more reflective senses,\
and leaving alone the less reflective ones. Now for the tale :\'97\
"In a rather extensive business establishment in Liverpool, where several\
assistants are engaged, there might have been seen, a week or two since, a yount*\
man of commanding deportment and of agreeable features, who gave effect to his\
avocation behind the counter In a manner that was at once inviting to the customers\
and conducive to the success of his master."\
The artist in every line. A more vulgar hand would have impaired\
Legal "Instruments."\'97" Soft Recorders." 1\
the pathos of his story by describing the business establishment. He [\
would have told you of the counters strewed with the rich silks\
and satins of the world, of majestic mirrors reflecting the counte-\
nance of chaffering beauty, of the majestic shop-walker striding\
proudly about, with a severe glance for the vassals and an obsequious\
smile for the customers, of the gay and animated scene presented by\
an emporium where commerce spreads her choicest wares to tempt the\
taste of opulence. No; the "romancer" knows better. He does not\
even set the establishment high\'97it is but "rather" extensive, and\
only " several" assistants are engaged. Thus, simply set, with a plain\
background, rises in giant proportion the godlike figure of the Hero.\
His commanding deportment at once impresses you, and you can hear\
his haughty order, "'And down that roll of flannel." and the next\
moment you see the blandness of his "agreeable features" as he\
"gives effect to his avocation." The flannel is sold ere he whips out\
his wand, and the sharp matron eyes, that ordinarily watch the mea-\
suring process so sharply, are softened for him, and he metes out the\
material in the calm knowledge that he is trusted. Trusted! Ah,\
trusted indeed, and with the richest trust\'97the love of woman.\
11 With many customers he became a favourite, but with one in particular. More\
than once\'97sometimes moro than twice\'97in the counge of a week, a carriage would\
be drawn up at the shop-door, from which would emerge a lady, apparently be-\
tween thirty and forty years of a^e\'97tall, of delicate appearance, but with an outline\
of features that unmistakeably indicated an aristocratic descent."\
The lady would "emerge from the shop-door," as stated by the\
romancer, and stand in all aristocratic pride Defore the counter usually\
graced by the handsome young plebeian. Nay, the last word was\
wrong, the romancer himself hastened to eliminate it. Aristocratic\
love ennobles its object, and he is no plebeian.\
"If the young gentleman\'97we say young, for he was scarcely twenty-one years\
of age\'97"\
And a very good reason for calling him young. We could not desire a\

Ill\
better. A gentleman scarcely twenty-one is young, and though we are\
young at fifty, that is nothing to the point. "If the young gentleman\'97\
"Was not at his accustomed position behind the counter upon her entering the\
shop, sho mado the most urgent Inquiries after him, desiring that be should attend\
to her and no one else. The worthy proprietor was always too happy to comply\
with her desire, for she was one of those first-rato customers that settled a good\
lodger account once in six months without tho allowance of the ordinary discount."\
"Attend to her and no one else." Pretty, playful command. The\
"worthy proprietor" (and the adjective is well chosen, for he who could\
see his good fortune m having such a shopman was worthy of it) is\
represented as having acted upon a commercial, rather than a senti-\
mental view of the case, and here, once more, the conscientious artist\
in words puts forth his power. Had he described a Liverpool draper\
as yielding to "the powerful promptings of a tender heart," and as\
encouraging a love affair for its own sake, we should all have felt that\
the thing, if not impossible, was improbable. Bat by instantly assign-\
ing a good business reason, and in good business English\'97 she was\
one of those first-rate customers that settled an account without dis-\
count," wc are not disturbed in our romance by the suggestion of an\
incongruity :-\'97\
"The favourite sslcsmsn was soon at his post serving the lady, and though a\
goodly number of articles might be disposed of, there appeared to exist a 'peculiar\
something' in the 4 business transaction' which in the course of time looked very\
much like a worm cordiality of sentiment, and a reciprocity of feeling and idea\
bordering upon mutual attachment."\
KdI'Sseai; could not have traced the progress of affection more deli-\
cately, nor could the vocabulary of Gbobges Sand have more sweetly\
set out the deepening tones of love. We are reminded of lines committed\
to memory when we were even younger than the hero of the tale:\'97\
"A mutual flame was quickly caught.\
Was auickly too revealed,\
Pot neither bosom lodged a wish\
Which vrrtne keeps concealed."\
Pass we by, reluctantly, the record of the playful "chaff" of envious\
shopmates, who in Dundreary accents, declared that no fellah could\
understand what was going on, and let us hasten to the crisis. The\
Young Lochinvar of Liverpool was away with his bride:\'97\
"Since one day last week, however, the buxom stripling has become rum at as\
far as the establishment is concorned, while the face of the lady as well has not\
presented itself within the visionary region of the other assistants or their employer."\
The excitement of the narrative has elevated the narrator into lan-\
guage somewhat more poetic, and a thought less clear than usual, but\
we are authorised to state that the "non-presentation of the face within\
the visionary region," means that nobody in the shop has seen the lady.\
We need hardly say that this little obscurity is no fault, but a proof of\
the self-exciting power of genius, and appropriately closes the epic part\
of the narrative. The idyllic portion remains, and it is charmingly\
simple:\'97\
"A letter was addressed by the young man to his mother on the eve prior to his\
leaving, stating 'that he had left his old placo to better himself elsewhere. Fortune\
had suddenly smiled upon him in a wondrous manner!' He assured his mother\
that,' tho next time she confronted her " darling boy " the would see him a gentle-\
man of the first stomp.'"\
This touching incident was perhaps not much, but the art with which\
it is thrown in at the close of the tale, invests it with a significance not\
to be overlooked. We have hitherto heard only of the personal attrac-\
tions, and graceful attentions of the hero, bat we now are told of the\
excellence of his heart, and are adroitly led to infer that as a good and\
thoughtful son makes a good and kind husband, the fair duchess, or\
whatever the aristocrat may be, will be happy in the husband she has\
claimed from the counter. We shall look out for the presentations to\
the Prince next Season. Meantime we rejoiee in having lighted (thanks\
to the Morning Star) upon a simple tale, so beautifully told as to be\
invested with all the charm of romance.\
\
DBAWINGROOM AND WATERING-PLACE SPORTING\
INTELLIGENCE.\
Y DBAS PUWCH,\'97\
During the past\
Season several pro-\
mising fillies have\
been trotted out, of\
whose doings we\
shall expect to hear\
great things next\
year. Numerous\
matches of a very\
sporting character\
have come off, and\
a great deal of love\
has been made and\
lost over the events.\
We hear of many\
young thorough-\
breds still in the\
trainer's hands at\
Brighton, Scarbo-\
rough, Clapham,\
and other places\
noted for their ad-\
mirable Training Establishments, under the management of mature sharp-eyed\
spinsters, and hard-working assistants.\
At the many rout and sit-down suppers'there were plenty of entries for the\
Ladies' Plate.\
Among the younger gentlemen there were several Flat Races, which do not call\
for any special notice.\
The winning-post at most of the 'Sfeeple-chaces during the Season was either\
at St. George^, Hanover Square, or St. Paul's, Knightsbridge. Of the Langham\
Steeple-chace we have heard scarcely anything at all.\
The following are names of those who, according to the latest telegrams, have\
been struck out of their engagements :\'97\
On the 16th instant, 9 a.m., Lady Valstngham Deux-temps, out of her Hanover\
Square engagement: She has changed hands, we hear, but the owner has not yet\
been mentioned.\
On the 20th instant, 10 a.m., Miss Fanny Flirt, out of ber Oxford engagement,\
entered into during the excitement of the Commemoration. This was not, as we be-\
lieved from the first, a bond fide affair. Really Matchmakers should be more\
cautious.\
On the 22nd instant, 11 a.m., Miss Florence Fowlek out of all her engagements.\
These were thirteen in number, entered into at various times under Ball-room, Pic-\
nic and Moonlight circumstances. With this telegram comes the information that\
she has been entered for a fresh engagement with an eligible parti. Future date\
unknown.\
Paid Forfeit.\'97The Hon. Miss Mart Moth. The match was to have come\
off on the 23rd instant between the Moth and the Ensign.\
The Ensign was at his post, St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, to\
time. The Moth never put in an appearance. Her\
backers, who were all present, were much chagrined. She\
has since paid forfeit, and sent back all the Ensign's letters\
and pTesents.\
Paid Forfeit\'97Mrs. Vane Weathercock. On the 19th\
instant she did not put in an appearance for the Breakfast\
Cup, causing great anxiety to her owner. She has paid\
forfeit of her former good position in Society.\
Mr. Van Doubledollar, the great Dutch Merchant,\
has purchased Lady Penelope Farthtngsworth, eldest\
daughter of the Marquis op Hardup. One small engage-\
ment for a small sum off in consequence. No love lost.\
Trial Stake*.\'97Miss Flighty and Captain John Im-\
pulse to start from Boulogne for one day. There are\
some difficulties in the way, but it looks like a match.\
Prospective for 1865.\'97In the next year's Annual, Miss\
Blonde, Lady Sweetlips and Miss Fille de L'Heiress\
are to be engaged. Fille de L'Heiress carries \'a3300,000\
weight, as a maiden, and with this she ought to win.\
Bachelor'\'bb Middle-aged Stakes.\'97Mrs. Martha O'Leary,\
widow, trained at Margate, winner five years ago of the Fat\
Buck Stakes, will have it all her own way.\
The colours of the winners'have been chiefly white body,\
no sleevps, lace veils and orange-blossom wreaths.\
The Matrimonial Jockey; Club has this Season issued\
its orders to the effect that .there shall be "No Cards"\
of the races, correct or incorrect.\
Nursery Stakes.\'97Of these it is evident we cannot at pre-\
sent say anything. But we hope that in spite of all the\
complaints with which we have met in various sportii\
quarters, there will be no deterioration in the true breed\
English Thoroughbreds.\
From the Training Establishments we hear that Miss\
GospRiGnTLY, of Brighton, has a fine team for the Broinp-\
ton and Kensington Buck Drawing Christmas Stakes.\
Wild Agnes, now at Miss Backboard's Academy, Clap-\
ham, is backed for a good place in Society's Races next year.\
Sweetheart's Correspondent at Scarborough says that Little\
Pickle, age thirteen, at Miss Violet Powder's Ladies' Col-\
lege, is much improved, and will take a good deal of beating.\
Miss Alice Bkauxyeux, aged seventeen, now at Miss\
Watchpul's Seminary, Richmond, will have to be run in\
blinkers.\
Bachelor's Convivial'Stakes, for Steeple-chacers that have\
refused to take the great leap. This is an entirely new race.\
We should imagine that there will be a goodly list of entries.\
On last settling day several well-known jilters were posted\
and warned from the ring. No more at present from yours,\
Saddle and Bridal.\

"Who would not fight for such a Church? Who would not die for such a Church\

To fight is something to do for a Church; to die is something more;\
what can anyone do beyond that? Go to the hustings, says Aacn-\

RAILWAY SUTTEE.\
Bailway Directors! A letter in the Morning Pott contains an\
alarming account of a fire in a railway carriage, caused by a lump of\
burning coke which entered it from the engine. This accident chanced\
to happen on the Paris and Strasbourg line, but the like might occur\
any day on a British one. The carriage contained "two ladies in light\
summer dresses, with one other gentleman" than the gentleman who\
narrates the accident. "In an instant the cushions and the trimmings\
of the carriages were in flames and the ladies in hysterics. I had,"\
continues the latter gentleman, "the presence of mind to close the\
window at once to stop the draught, and applying my paletot, which\
Poole sent me this day week, I succeeded in stifling the nascent con-\
flagration." The Poole that furnished this paletot could not, of course,\
supply the water which would have been more effectual. Not only was\
the paletot sacrificed, but in that sacrifice the hands of Mr. Poole's\
client were " dreadfully burnt to the bone, and" his "shattered nerves\
received a shock which," he remarks, "they are not fitted to endure."\
He adds, "I shudder at the contemplation of what might have occurred\
had the blazing mass fallen into the lap of one of the lovely French\
girls seated in the carriage." In conclusion, he mentions that, on the\
same line last year, a lady and a gentleman in a coupe near the head of\
a train were actually burnt to death.\
These facts, Gentlemen, imperatively require you to provide all your\
trains with a water supply sufficient to extinguish any fire which may\
occur in any one of the carriages. The great danger is not that the fittings,\
but that other contents of the carriage, much more combustible, may\
catch fire. If there is a lady therein, it is sure to be filled with linen-\
drapery. These inflammable fabrics are spread out on a steel cage\
apparently made on purpose to ventilate them in the event of their\
ignition. Should they ignite, the consequence must be a sudden rush\
of flame, and the instantaneous conversion of what we may call Beauty\
into animal charcoal!\
Well, gentlemen, this may not much signify to Beauty, which would\
not surround itself with fuel, disposed for a Suttee, if it were not pre-\
pared, morally as well as physically, to undergo cremation at any time.\
But what if one of you were the companion of Beauty thus all at once\
enveloped in blazes? If, Mr. Chairman, tua res agitur, paries cum\
proximus ardet, how much more when your fellow passenger's crino-\
line and all its paraphernalia are in flames? What are you to i1i? Put\
the lady out, if but for your own sake. But how, without a sufficiency\
of water F'\
Connected with a properly constructed reservoir, a hose, running the\
whole length of the train, and sending into every carriage a branch\
fitted with a stopcock, would enable any gentleman at a moment's\
notice to constitute himself fireman to a lady on fire. With this con-\
trivance you might, if sufficiently alert, play on the blazing fal-lals at\
least in time to save yourself from being mvolved in their conflagration,\
and thus affording a meal to the devouring element.\
The hose should extend into all the carriages, third class and all.\
Crinoline is worn without regard to circumstances; and lucifer matches\
are likely to explode at distances safe from sparks out of the engine.\
Gentlemen will smoke if ladies will allow them, and ladies, as they\
increase in manliness, will soon smoke too.\
"Husbands, insure your Wives." This, gentlemen, is a caution\
which you ought to post conspicuously at every station, with the further\
warning of "Doubly Hazardous."\

A MERMAID'S DIARY.\
\
\
hair-brush twice.\
The Seaside, South Coast.\
O dear Mr. Punch,\'97One reads all sorts of books\
by the sea-side, and I have lately been looking\
into an old book called the Spectator. I am told\
it was the Punch of those days. Well, I lighted\
on a piece of advice to young ladies to keep a\
diary of each day, hour by hour. I thought this\
such a good notion that I determined to try, and I send you a little\
bit of my journal. If you arc good-natured, and print it, I may send\
yon some more. But, of course, keep my name secret, or I shall never\
hear the last of it. I should like to see myself in print, I confess, and\
most of all in your delightful pages.\
;Ever your\
DIARY.\
Monday, 8-9 a.m.\'97Dressing. Dropped my\
I know it's all nonsense, but I wish I had not.\
9- 10.\'97Breakfast. Edward shook hands as usual, and sat next\
me, but suddenly turned cold and silent. Ue cannot have had letters\
t o-day, as there is no London post. What has poor me done P\
10- 11.\'97Gave Edward six opportunities ot speaking to me, but\
he did not, and went out to smoke. I was almost rude to Mamma, but\
she need not have begun to grumble about my not practising on that\
wretched sea-side instrument. And 1 was quite right in saying that\
she ought to make the children do their lessons every day.\
11- 12.\'97Bathed. The sea cold, and the bathing-woman rude.\
Edward never came to meet us.'\
12- 1 p.m.\'97Doing my hair. Broke my comb.\
1- 2.\'97Lunch, and looking at photograph book. Took out Ed-\
ward's sister. She may be very good in tier way, but she's a Guy.\
Wondered whether he would notice it.\
2- 3.\'97The boys proposed a sail. Edward objected. Of course\
! I was for it. At last Mamma refused, because old Miss Grirbles had\
1 said she should call. What nonsense spoiling an afternoon for that poor\
] old thing, who only comes for what she can get!\
3- 4.\'97In my bed-room, trying to read Ivanhoe. What rubbish it is!\
4- 5.\'97Took the little ones for a walk. Scolded them well all the\
way, for they are certainly the rudest children I know.\
5- 6.\'97Dinner. One of the little Malcolms came in, and insisted\
on sitting next to me, in Edward's place. He made no attempt to\
move her, and it was not for me to do it. He was very " attentive and\
gentlemanly," and I hate it. I hate hypocrisy. But I was as gracious\
as my lord, and thanked him, in the sweetest way, for a peach. I will\
have it out with him before I write again.\
6- 8.\'97I said I would. We all went for a walk along the sands,\
and when he offered me his arm over the rocks, I told him to offer\
it to Mamma. The dinner had given him back his temper, and he\
made a joke about his arm and his liand going together. Being relieved\
by finding that there was nothing serious, I gave it him well, and asked\
him what 'happiness one could expect with a person of an uncertain\
temper. I went on as long as I dared, and until his voice began to\
deepen, and then I asked him what I had done? He was ashamed to\
tell me, and well he might be, though I like his taking notice of every-\
thing. I had come down to breakfast without his brooch, and with the\
one Captain Seymour gave me for a Philippina. If Edward is\
humble enough (which he was not) he shall see something. We came\
home very good friends.\
8- 9.\'97Begged that the children might stay up and play the Race\
Game, poor little things. They ought to enjoy their holiday, and I am\
sure they are very good. Had such luck at the game, and Edward\
was second horse.\
9- 10.\'97Music. He has very good taste, though he does not sing,\
and soon detected that Rosa Clarke (whom I hate) sang false.\
He made some nonsense verses to one of our songs, and I declare that\
they were much cleverer than the original. He must send them to Punch.\
10- 11.\'97Soda-water and things. When we went up, Edward\
went out to smoke, and think about me, he said. I said I hoped that\
he would think more properly than he had been doing all day, but I\
don't believe that he went out very much depressed by the rebuke.\
Heard him calling in the dogs, and it struck me that his voice was like\
Mario's in tone. Read a little more of Ivanhoe, and came on a beau-\
tiful passage. I am glad Roteena had blue eyes.\
Tuesday, S-9 a.m.\'97Dressing.\
9- 10.\'97Breakfast. He pretended to take pains not to see whether I\
had any brooch at all. He can be very funny, and if he took to the\
stage I am sure he would excel any of the actors.\
10- 11.\'97Such a dear little note from Edward's sister, who has\
been sketching a certain oak-tree, with a seat under it that just hoUk\
two, and it is for me. She recollects. Ran up-stairs and put back her\
photograph in the book, and felt rather angry with Edward for having\
made me take it out yesterday. Forgave him, however, but did not\
tell him so.\
11- 12.\'97Bathing. The sea lovely. I swam four strokes without\
touching the sand. Edward came to meet us, and said somet .\
very pretty about mermaids. I wish he would write poetry, I am sure\
1 what he said was very like something iu Tennyson.\
I 12-1 p.m.\'97Doing my hair\'97the Mermaid's hair. Why is it called\
unlucky to give one s hair to anybody one Ukes? It seems nonsense,\
but after the hairbrush misfortune I will run no more risks,\
j 1-2.\'97Lunch. Edward is very fond of sardines. He made a capital\
French joke about his being Le Roi des Sardes. It is not everybody\
that could make a joke in a foreign language.\
2-5.\'97The boys again proposed a sail. Edward thought it was\
not a good day for the sea, and of course he was right, for he has\
yachted a great deal. So we had a drive to the ruins of Rottenstoue\
Castle, and Edward gave a mock lecture on its history, which made us\
all scream. It ought to be written down, and he thall. ,\
i 5-6.\'97Dinner. Miss Malcolm and her brother came. He is to\
: Cambridge, and full of conceit, but Edward shut him up awfull;;,\
i asking him some question in mathematics about the square of a high\
pot in use. Polly Malcolm worked hard with her great black eves,\
out Edward hates that sort of eye. He is'severe, though, in saying\
that she squints. Her nose is not straight, but I like justice, and told\
him so.\
I 6-8.\'97We went on the pier. As Edward and I were standing a!\
the end, I asked him whether sea-water was good for brooches. He\
stared so funnily. Then I took out Captain Sbymour's, and quietly\
dropped it into the sea. "Some Mermaid might like it," I said, "this\
Mermaid doesn't care about it." What strange creatures men are.\
He almost scolded me for "thinking it necessary to make'a sacrifice ol\
an ornament." I didn't think it necessary, and I chose to do it.\
8- 10.\'97Music, round games, and nonsense. I was old maid three\
times running. Polly sang, and she has a great loud voice, which\
Edward praised very fairly, saying that she had ho style and no feeling,\
and that it was not the voice for a home.\
11.\'97To bed. Dreamed that Captain Seymour was a porpoise,\
and was swimming round the pier trying to find his brooch, and that\
Edward was trying to harpoon him.\
Wednesday, 8-9 a.m.\'97Dressing. Heard an awful shouting among\
the children, and presently Louisa ran in to me to show me a beautiful\
doll which Edward had sent for from London for her. It had blue\
eyes. He had given presents to all the others, because it was Mamma's\
birthday. How he remembers things !|\
9- 10.\'97Breakfast. Asked him for some marmalade, for the sake\
of whispering that some blue-eyed dolls must eat. How quick he is!\
He answered that " lips, though rosy, must still be fed."\
10- 121\'97Too rough for bathing to-day. Edward drew some letters\
for me to illuminate. They were his motto, "Sapere Jude," and the\
initials are those of my Christian names, Sybil Ada, which is J\
very extraordinary coincidence. And he had a surprise for me. Such\
a lovely ring\'97pearls and emeralds. He said he did not wish me to be\
jealous of the other children, and ill-use them. The joke nearly made\
me cry, for I remembered how cross I had been to the poor little\
things on Monday night. He took pains to mention twice that he had\
brought the ring with him from London, and I did not understand at\
first why he laid stress on this. Now I do, and it is just like his pnde.\
He would not let me think he was making up to me for throwing away\
that brooch. As if I did not hate it, and the giver, and everything aud\
everybody that could give him a moment's annoyance!\
12- 1 p.m.\'97Mamma again going on about practising, so I sent\
Edward to smoke on the rocks( and I rattled away at the horrid piano-\
forte until we had a little crowd of fishethnen leaning over the garden\
rails. Wasn't I a mermaid, then, Ma. Edward? ,\
1.\'97Lunch. We seem to be always eating and drinking by ttj\
sea-side. The boys declare that it is awfully jolly, aud talk Mjj\'99\
"grub" as if they never had anything to eat at home\'97the dreaara\
little pigs! Edward suggested, gravely, that there should be anotbtf\
lunch introduced, about three, in order to enable exhausted nature to\
hold on till five.\
2-5.\'97A delightful sail. Edward pointed out the new fortifications,\
aud explained to us that many of them were quite wrong and useles.\

I saw a long article in an old number of the Times on the same subject,\
and though Edward did not say that he had written it, I should not\
he surprised if he had, as the arguments were exactly the same, only\
Edward was clearer in his verbal explanation.\
5-6.\'97Dinner. Afterwards Edward proposed dear Mamma's health,\
and almost brought the tears into our eyes by his feeling language. He\
speaks beautifully, and so like a gentleman. I could have kissed him.\
l'erhaps 1 did, afterwards.\
6- 10.\'97Round games, and nonsense. At cross questions Louisa\
asked me, what was the use of a wedding-ring, and Charley Stothahd\
answered, "To catch a mermaid." This was very odd indeed, unless\
Edward had been prompting. I told him he had, but he said no, and\
t hat we had a flood of good omens setting in strong, which was a very\
clever sea-side image, I thought.\
10-11.\'97We went off early, but Edward and Charley Stothard\
sat on the rocks till nearly twelve o'clock, and I should like to know\
what they were talking about all that. time. Mermaids, perhaps. I\
kill know.\

else so much as for a Soldier.\
Now, of all the fellows in\
a Regiment, I assure you,\
1 consider the Surgeon to\
be, generally, the most of a\
gentleman. He is at least\
tas much of one as any of\
them, and he has, if regu-\
larly appointed, been made\
as much more of a gentle-\
man than the rest as a much\
better education than they\
have had could make him.\
The indignity which Army\
Surgeons are treated with proceeds not from pride of rank and birth\
on the part of any of their Drother officers, but from a consciousness of\
the want of those advantages on the part of some of them. In this\
commercial country many a fellow enters the Army who never had a\
grandfather that he could give any account of, and the best that such a\
fellow can say of his pedigree usually is that his father was a tailor.\
More commonly an officer of that class of fellows is the son of a large\
mercantile rogue, or a swindling railway jobber. Well, he cannot help\
that; and he is rich, and his own money at least was not ill-gotten;\
and he might be a 'gentleman if he chose. But instead of that, he is\
too often a purse-proud Snob. This is the sort of fellow that thinks it\
necessary to assert his position by insisting on the abasement of Army\
Surgeons. It is not the Swells in a regiment, Punch, who are insolent\
to the Surgeon, but only the Snobs. Mushrooms these Snobs are called\
by men who have less respect for a mushroom than I have, for I con-\
sider it an excellent ingredient, not an objectionable one, in a mess.\
Those who term them mushrooms, will further say that, inasmuch as\
they peculiarly abound in the Cavalry, the majority of them are Horse\
Mushrooms; but, comparing these bloated and extremely offensive\
Snobs to fungi, I would rather name them Toadstools.\
I consider the Surgeon quite as much a combatant officer as myself.\
We don't in these days, charge with lances in rest, and we no longer\
brandish battle-axes and maces. He is as likely to be struck down at\
any time by disease, sometimes by shot, as I am. I wish no invidious\
distinction to be made between him and myself. I would not assign\
him the uniform of a Beadle. Let him wear that of his relative rank m\
the Army, or be allowed to dress in plain clothes, so that he might, as\
perhaps he would like to, be distinguished from a combatant fool.\
Unless the reasonable demands of the Army Surgeons are granted,\
I shall be obliged to throw up my Commission. Suppose I am killed in\
action, well and good. I am prepared for that. But I may be wounded.\
For that 1 am prepared too. 1 am always ready to lose a limb for my\
country. But my country must take care that it shall be skilfullv\
amputated. I expect my country to provide that any operation which\
its service may require me to undergo shall be performed safely,\
quickly, and pleasantly, as much as it can be. Certainly I value my\
blood too highly to allow it to be spilt by a bungling operator. I don't\
at all relish the idea of an Acting-Assistant Surgeon, obtained by\
advertisement, attempting to extract a bullet deeply lodged in the com-\
plicated anatomy of your humble servant,\

HIPPOPHAGY AGAIN.\
Okb of the Secretaries of the French Society for the Protection of\
Animals, in a lecture given the other day in Paris at the Garden of\

of food, demonstrating its acceptability with a tureen of horse soup, and\
another dish of that noble animal dressed a la davbe, which he offered\
to his audience, and they, including many ladies, devoured. Well;\
who shall tax them with eating strange food? If all the prime tongues\
ready cooked, on sale at our British grocers', could speak, and would\
tell the truth, we apprehend that not a few of them would neigh.\
There is support, doubtless, in saddle of horse, but, for eating, we\

SCURVY ROGUES.\
Me. Punch,\
Do you, Sir, consider it altogether a ground for rejoicing, in the\
interests of humanity, that the frequency of garotte robberies has greatly\
diminished since the assignment of flogging to those crimes, and the\
actual infliction of that painful and degrading punishment on criminals\
connoted of them? I will tell you why I ask that question, Sir.\
You see, Mr. Punch, that the success with which the cat-o'-nine-tails\
has been tried as a preventive of one species of crime, is calculated to\
engender just an idea\'97a surmise\'97a suspicion\'97that its application\
might prove equally effectual for the prevention of some other crimes.\
And then " Suppose we try it"\'97is so natural a suggestion. If the cat\
should be tried further, and found to answer, to what extent might not\
its employment be carried? I tremble to think, Sir.\
The other day there appeared in the Times a letter dated from this\
place, and signed " W. F., on the subject of "Spurious Lime Juice."\
The writer of this communication adverts to the statement of Ma.\
Harkt Leach, resident medical officer to the Dreadnought hospital-\
ship, that patients under his care for scurvy had told him " that they\
would not or could not drink the lime-juice served out during the\
voyage, because it was so bad." "W. F." proceeds to say that "a\
large quantity of so-called lemon-juice, which is supplied to ships going\
long voyages, contains no juice of the lemon; it is manufactured in this\
country from tartaric and other acids, at a cheap cost, and flavoured\
with essence of lemon to imitate the genuine article." Having pointed\
out that this counterfeit of lemon or lime-juice is not anti-scorbutic at\
all, he declares that " it is notorious that in Liverpool large quantities\
of the spurious article are manufactured and sold for ships' stores for\
the use of ships' crews and emigrants." Now, Sir, those who know\
what scurvy is, will feel that the supply of sailors and ships with good-\
for-nothing rubbish under the name of a remedy for it, is what may,\
with an economy of strong language, be called a heartless fraud. The\
fraud is not merely heartless, it is, with all possible respect for the large\
manufacturers who are guilty of it, I must acknowledge, positively and\
extremely cruel.\
For ordinary acts of cheating and swindling, you know, Sir, Society is\
pretty well content with the imprisonment and hard labour at present\
awarded to rogues. You see, a compassionate public thinks the dis-\
cipline of the scourge too severe even for a criminal who, by deliberate\
dishonesty, has reduced several families from affluence to beggary.\
There is cruelty in this sort of crime, to be sure, but it is a cruelty\
which the majority of us, Sir, are not imaginative enough to appreciate,\
so long as it does not affect ourselves. What scurvy is, however, most\
people can understand, and nearly everybody, therefore, can see how\
cruel it is, for the mere sake of gain, to practise an imposition which\
must have the effect of letting multitudes rot and die of that dreadful\
disease. Now this element, you observe, Sir, of cruelty in the manu-\
facture of sham lime-juice, distinctly seen, and seen also to be aggra-\
vated by a peculiar intensity of baseness, may, I am almost afraid, so\
inflame the public mind, as to create a demand that the perpetrators of\
that deception, being as cruel as garotters, shall be whipped as welL\
I feel for my neighbour, Mr. Punch, as a respectable man; my neigh-\
bour over the way. Therefore I shudder at the apprehension that\
manufacturers of sham lemon-juice may soon be made liable to be\
flogged. A ruffian in corduroy breeches and hobnailed half-boots, yelling\
under the lash is an object that may, by some minds, be regarded with\
complacency, but I could not bear to behold the chief proprietor of\
those extensive works, a sleek, smooth gentleman in a suit of black,\
having his spectacles taken off, and his decent coat stripped from his\
back, and being tied up and flogged. Could you, Sir P Could yon\
endure hearing the shrieks of a man who had always occupied a proud\
mercantile position before he came to be placed in that unpleasant one\
at the whipping-post? Perhaps you will say that his cries would be\
drowned by louder noises ringing in your mind's ear\'97the groans of\
victims dying of scurvy through his wicked forgery of lime-juice. This\
is just what I fear the Public will soon begin to say, and then the\
authorities of yonder correctional establishment may have to witness\
what I shrink from imagining\'97the head of that eminent and wealthy\
firm undergoing corporal chastisement administered with an energy that\
will make him howl. I cannot tell you how that sight would shock one\
whose hatred of a rascal is less intense than his veneration for a person\
whose deportment and exterior are those of\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
QUIET WATERING-PLACES.\
Where have I not been since quitting Winklebeach! I've been\
roaming, I've been roaming, and I shall go roaming still^but I'm\
coming, but I'm coming, to the conclusion that a really Quiet Watering-\
place is nowhere to be found. This is the statement that I have put\
before the Company (Limited) in whose interests, coinciding, as they\
do, with those of my own mental and physical requirements, I have\
been lately travelling. From Sussex to Wales.\
No. n.\'97GWRYSTHLOGWDD.\
First day.\'97Arrived at Bangor, very early in the morning. Went to\
bed in the Bishop's Arms. At breakfast asked Boots where was the\
Quietest Watering-place in the neighbourhood. In his opinion I\
couldn't do better than go to Gwrysthlogwdd. What name did he\
say ?" Gwrysthlogwdd." Oh, thank you! Would he be good enough\
to write it down? The Landlord would. Oh! thank you againP It\
was a place only just started, he informed me. Capital fishing. Beau-\
tiful falls. "The Menai Straits, as it might be here," he illustrated\
this with his napkin, and I said, "Yes,"\'97"and the sea round as it\
might be here," napkin again. Was there bathing?" Yes, he should\
say there was bathing: he knew there was shooting, because Snt John\
Llanrooster, who was as it might be the Squire, lived in the Castle\
which you'd see as you went by the road, which lay here as it might\
be" in the direction of the ham on the sideboard. Very well; then I\
would go in the afternoon.\
Would I have a car or a boat P I might go to Beaumaris by steamer,\
and cross to Gwrysthlogwdd in a small ooat. I'd better to do this, as\
there wasn't a car in.\
4 p.m.\'97Landed at Beaumaris. Where did I wantTto go to? I\
showed paper with unpronounceable name written on it. Boatman\
couldn't read it. Intelligent person on pier deciphered it. Oh, thank\
you, very much! No boat to be obtained just now, but if I'd wait\
an hour or so. something would happen to the wind or the tide, or both,\
and I could be taken across. Owen Owen would take me. Where\
was he P Oh, somewhere. Very good, then I would leave my port-\
manteau in charge of the intelligent man at the pier, and visit the town.\
4'30.\'97At Beaumaris Castle, viewing the ruins. In the chapel. Ah'\
here the peaceful old monks used to pass their hours in silent medita-\
tion. How soothing! How calmly could I here rest, and fancy the\
organ pealing forth\'97Toodle turn turn\'97tiddle tiddle turn. An organ!\
by all that s inharmonious! Flaying "The Dark Girl Dressed in\
Blue" if I mistake not. I will seek the remains of the grand old\
refectory. Here at all events\'97" Just a little more lobster salad, old\
fellow."\'97" Don't give him all the champagne." Pop, pop, pop I Oh\
dear! there's a nasty grasshopper in my tart!"\'97" I say, we 11 make\
that old organ chap play a dance," ha, ha, ha!" Of course." A dance!\
in these hallowed precincts. It only wanted that to complete it. Away\
to the wilds of the watering-place with an unpronounceable name.\
5'30.\'97On the pier. Intelligent man with my portmanteau not to be\
seen. Has gone to his tea. Oh, thank you 1 Owen Owen had sailed\
about a quarter-of-an-hour ago with the gentleman's portmanteau. He\
thought I wanted it taken across. He often does jobs of that sort.\
Does he P "His mate'd take me." His mate is sitting on the pier\
railing, engaged, I take it, from the movement of his cheeks, in the\
exhilarating occupation of chewing tobacco. He expectorates obliquely,\
and nods. Evidently a man of few words. After a pause, during\
which I am looking at Owen Owen's mate, expecting him to make\
an observation, he descends leisurely from his perch, and goes down a\
ladder at the pier side. _ Two more mates leaning over the rail com-\
mence a conversation in some guttural unknown tongue. Of course\
they are speaking Welsh. I should like to know what they are saying.\
They occasionally look at me and laugh, from which I gather that\
I am the subject of their remarks. Pleasant honest dogs, these sons\
of the ocean.\
6.\'97Down the ladder and into a little cockle-shell of a boat. Very\
damp. After a good deal of bumping against the pier, and shipping a\
considerable quantity of water, we are taken by a sudden gust, which\
almost capsises us, several yards (do they measure at sea by yards P no,\
it's fathoms or knots, I think\'97say knots) many knots down stream\'97\
or up stream, for' I can't make out which way the water is going; it\
this note on landing. Oh, ye gentlemen, who live at home at ease, how\
little do ye think upon the dangers of crossing from Beaumaris to\
Gwrysthlogwdd. In a second the large sail was anywhere, nowhere,\
flapping about in the breeze. He told me to hold the line loosely, and\
I did. I, myself, was jerked on to the floor (is it floor ?) of the boat,\
where I lay,"with the ballast. Owen's mate used language unbecoming\
a Christian and a Welshman. Being in his power, I pretended, rather\
to enjoy his observations than otherwise. We couldn't get'up'to the\
shore, ou account, he said, of the tide. The land was half a mile distant,\
and not a soul to be seen anywhere. I was strongly.impressed with\
the quietude of Gwrysthlogwdd.\
"Halloo!" cried Owen's mate. No answer. Owen's mate used\
language, and said, that I must help to get the blank boat in, unless I\
wanted to sit there, till turn of blank tide. When might that be? Oh.\
three blank hours hence. Evidently a man of few words, and those of\
an emphatic character which he uses as often as possible. We prepared\
to jump into the briny deep, and tug the boat to shore. When I say\
lee prepared, I mean, / did. Owen's mate going in, boots and all.\
Owen's mate did give way to his temper, fearfully. I explained, as\
1 politely as possible, that I had not been brought up to this kind of\
work. It never struck me, until now, that Owen's mate had'been\
drinking. Gwrysthlogwdd is, at present, too quiet a place, at least,\
just in this quarter. There's not a creature to be seen, and the\
inebriated son of the ocean, insists upon leaving his boat, and carrying\
me on his back to land. I submit, without my shoes and stockings.\
Through a lot of sandy, slushy mud, we gain the beach. Owen's\
mate had kept himself on his legs, and me on his back, in a wonderful\
manner. What is his \{are P Five shillings P - He shakes liis]head. Six P\
He won't hear of it. Seven P He's impracticable. H'm! I see a\
fisherman on the beach. Here, my good man, how much shall I give\
Owen's mate P Fisherman, a good-humoured looking person, shakes\
his head, and says, down in his throat, some words which sound as if\
consisting chiefly of "gV' and "r"s." Is it possible, he doesn't\
understand English? Another fisherman comes. "How much shall\
I,"\'97Good gracious! he is shaking his head. They are all shaking their\
heads. Owen's mate sleepily.\
Two more inhabitants, female, come down on to the shingle. Two\
little boys make for the boat, returning at a run, with my shoes and\
stockings. Upon these I seized, and after putting them on, presented\
Owen's mate with half a sovereign. Seeing this, the male and female\
natives, and the two .little boys, set upon Owen's mate.\
7.\'97From this distance, i.e., the door of the Inn of Gwrysthlogwdd,\
I can still see them fighting for the prize. The mate's boat has dis-\
appeared, and this is now you $et to this new Welsh Watering-place,\
by water. I have since ascertained that the way here by land, is only\
safe to those thoroughly acquainted with the Mountain Geography.\
First Note. Made in my diary, on the doorstep of the Old Village Inn.\
This is, indeed, a Lovely Quiet Place. I will knock and inquire con-\
cerning accommodation, and by the way, my portmanteau.\
A FRIENDLY LITTLE ARTICLE.\
We are told by Alphonse Karr that "Friendship between two\
women is always a plot against a third." We deny it, as we always\
make a point of denying all the spiteful things that are said against the\
beautiful sex. And what is the friendship between two men, we should\
like to know P If we had the inclination to be cynical, under the de-\
ceitful notion that we were being extremely clever, we might answer:\
"Friendship between two men is a continual struggle as to which of\
the two shall do the other." We are afraid we are not the only persons\
in this world who labour under the melancholy conceit that, to be clever,\
we have only to be cynical.\
was Jrown'd here," he says, in a husky voice. "I never can pass this\
here point," he adds, "without drinking summut." _\
While engaged in this touching tribute to his friend's memory, he\
gave me the sail line (is that the name ?) to hold. I do this cheerfully,\
but nervously, withal.\
Ten Minutes afterwards. He is still drinking the pious memory,\
occasionally stopping to meditate. I gently suggest, that if he would\
not mind steering a little, we might get on in a more even manner. At\
this moment, there comes, what Owen's mate calls a lurch. 1 finish\
Wliat we Learn in Foreign Farts.\
When last we were in Paris, we strolled into the Palais de Justice,\
and soon found ourselves wandering in the famous Salle des Pas Perdus.\
On inquiring, we discovered that the Salle des Fas was not intended\
as a companion refuge to the Champ de Mars; and we also learnt that\
the Pas Perdus were in no way paternally related to the Enfants Trouvis.\
These facts were no less new than pleasmg to us, and so accordingly we\
have made a note of them.\
A RETORT THAT IS A LITTLE TOO SPIRITED.\
Retaliation in commerce, as in other things, sometimes takes a\
most sava?e form. Now look at Iudia, how we treat her in our com-\
mercial relations! Because India sends us her cotton badly ginned, is\
that any reason, we ask, why we should send her our sherries so fear-\
fully brandied?\
A QUESTION FOR NOTES AND QUERIES.\

Review of Weather for July.\
During the past month, there was a restless wind that blew down its own smoke, and took\
off the edge of the meridian with its own plane.\
In the morning, attenuated nimbi dwindled into a luminous canopy, whose height was 6000\
feet above the sea-level.\
Cumuli and cirrhi gave themselves up to the full development of ozone; while Summer\
Meteoric Phosphorescent Trains met the Radiating Steamers within live minutes of each\
other.\
Thermometer in the Sun at 4'30 p.m. (How it got there, no one knows.\'97B., June.)\
At midnight, on the 17th, the Rev. F. C. Robarts of Frant, shot with considerable\
velocity across Ursa Major, and disappeared after traversing an approximated space.\
(Guv'nor got this out of the Times, think.\'97Buzz, Junk.)\
On the following morning the wind returned to France, and, in a test slip, fell between a\
wet and a dry bath, showing some external signs of discoloration.\
It will be seen by reference to the table. (At this point I made a reference to the table.\
My respected parent had disappeared. Yrs., &c, B. Junr.)\
Startling Cruelty.\
A "Well-known Upholsterer, whose name shall not be held np to universal execration,\
because this course could not be adopted without puffery, undertook the contract for keeping\
well furnished, repairing and re-decorating the Ophthalmic Hospital. We accidentally caught\
sight of the bill for the current year. One of the largest items recurring over and over again\
was "Rods for the Blind." Shall the unfortunate and helpless be flogged for their misfor-\
tunes under our very noses, under our very eye-lashes? Shame! Shame!\

THE CONSERVATIVE'S PROGRESS.\
A SONG INSTEAD OP A SPEECH.\
I (For After Dinner.)\
More years than I will own'ago,\
With Eldon in his glory.\
Of change I was the mortal foe,\
An out-and-out old Tory.\
We lost, through statesmen heeding facts\
Apparent to the senses,\
The Test and Corporation Acts;\
There went our first defences.\
The barriers, thus, of Church and State,\
Removed, the foe might enter:\
Still he would be, at any rate,\
A Protestant Dissenter.\
But then we had, unfaithful Chief,\
To gulp our indignation\
At Roman Catholic Relief:\
Oh, that Emancipation!\
One more post gone I had to own;\
But Act, once passed, is valid:\
We, round the Altar and the Throne,\
Closed in again, and rallied.\
When soon a democratic storm\
Did vehemently stir us,\
And Parliamentary Reform\
Abolished rotten boroughs.\
So I, for an accomplished fact,\
Accepted revolution;\
Yet, aiming still to save intact\
Our glorious Constitution,\
In hopes I might illname outlive,\
Instinct with spirit vital,\
New named myself Conservative,\
And lost my party title.\
To keep all things just as they \\\
1 ceased not my endeavour;\
Some things which it had been my <\
To keep from being ever.\
Municipal Reform to stay\
We wasted machinations;\
Those landmarks, too, were swept away;\
Our ancient Corporations.\
Gone goose is gone goose; 'tis absurd\
To mind what can't be mended.\
As Peel advised, I registered,\
And on the watch attended.\
But our inconstant Chief once more\
Imposed on our affection;\
For all the British Lion's roar,\
Free Trade displaced Protection.\
Divorce, to rich ones unconfined,\
For injured partners married,\
I strove against, but grew resigned\
To it when it was carried.\
Law of the land 'tis now at last,\
And I'm the law's defender,\
Nailing my colours to the mast,\
My motto, "No Surrender!"\
I steadily refused consent\
To give up that condition\
That kept Jews out. of Parliament;\
Until they got admission.\
The wound that made soon cicatrised,\
'Twas not of serious nature,\
I stuck to the unchristianised.\
Still British, Legislature.\
Now Vote by Ballot I '11 withstand\
Henceforth, untd it passes,\
And hold as long, with steady hand,\
The Suffrage from the Masses,\
Conservative of all that's past;\
Consistent as a martyr:\

Then a few chosen young ladies joined in the procession, and from the\
following description, which was in a Norwich newspaper, you may\
form some notion of how very nice we looked\'97\
"A young lady of about 13, dressed in flowing white robes and long white veil\
over her head, bearing bluo satin banner with the words in cloth-of-silver ' Hail\
Mart.'\
"Young lady with a gorgeous white satin banner of the Virgin rising on elouds of\
silver to heaven, her feet planted on the serpent's head, which was very lifelike;\
her dress was of silver, with purple velvet cloak studded with gold stars; emeralds\
and pearls were let Into the border of the dress and gave it a dazzling appearance.\
"Young lady with blue satra-aiid-silver banner, of the Virgin and Child enthroned,\
the words 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  Salve Begina' in gold lotters placed round the top of the banner."\
I leave you to guess, dear, which of these was me, and you can fancy\
that at Vespers with the priests and monks and acolyths sitting or\
kneeling before the altar, and the white robed and veiled young ladies\
all arranged in rows behind, the "effect was quite dramatic," as the\
newspaper declares, indeed Charley says it must have really been as\
food as a play. Then we had a lovely sermon from dear Father\
'igfacius (as that wretch persists in calling him); and do you know,\
dear, he can play the organ, and even beat the drum, at least so Fanny\
Fribble tells me, and I know he has a drum in chapel, and most\
solemnly it sounds. The sermon lasted twenty minutes, wnich, as the\
paper says, was "very short for him," and after this\'97but there, the\
newspaper shall tell you what came next:\'97\
"By the time the lecture was over it was quite dark, only the moon had just\
risen over St Andrew's Hall. The procession re-formed as before, lighted tapers of\
wax being offered to all who were willing to follow in the procession. Hundreds\
did so, and the extraordinary appearance of the Innumerable lights, the waving\
banners glittering in the rising moonlight, the soft chanting, the white veils of the\
girls, the crimson robes of the boys, the rapt attention of the dense crowds, who\
seemed perfectly amazed, the complete circle of light round the garden and court-\
yard (for the procession colled serpent-like round the whole preroises), was indeed\
a strange and fairy-like scene."\
Some of us went home then, but the monks (as Charley said) re-\
solved to make a night of it; and so\'97\
"Matins were sung at two on Monday morning, followed by lauds at three. The\
solemn chant and organ peal from the Convent Chapel sounded strangely on the\
night air of our Protestant city ; the night was so still that it was heard far away\
down the streets and alleys. The lauds' bell rung at 3 a. m. When this was over at\
4'15, the dawn was approaching rapidly. The procession, as at vespers, formed, the\
congregation following with lighted tapers, left the Convent chanting, wound its\
way up the narrow street opposite the gate, continued across Tombland, down past\
the west front of the Cathedral, up Princes Street, across St. Andrew's Plain, and\
then returned down Elm Hill. On arriving at the monastery gate, all sung 'Ood\
Save the Queen,' and entered the sacred precincts singing the Doxology."\
That odious Cousin Charley vowed to me next morning that when\
the music woke him he thought it was the cats! But then he reflected\
that cats in common life don't sing God Save the Queen, and so he\
changed his mind about them. He says he questions if Her Majesty\
would much like having her name mixed up with such sham popish\
I humbug, as he irreverently calls it. I'm sure I don't know about that,\
but I do know I enjoyed it vastly, humbug though he thinks it. You\
I see, dear, we have no opera in Norwich, and Dalls are few and far\
i between, and I'm sure girls should be thankful to these dear darling\
j Benedictines for affording them a little rational amusement. If it were\
'not for the delightful evenings such as that I have described, I'm sure\
I don't know when I should ever get the chance here of wearing a white\
dress, and going to an evening party. Indeed the being drest in flowing\
robes of white, with a veil over one's head, really makes one feel almost\
like going to be married! and I'm sure I could have kissed that dear\
Father Superior, who looked as satisfied as though he were giving one\
away! When you come to Norwich I will show you the dear man, and\
you will see if you agree with me in thinking him so handsome. I hope\
you won't be very long before you come, dear, for I so want you to see\
me in my white dress and veil, and to ask you if you don't think that\
the latter would look better with a wreath of orange blossom.\
A thousand thousand loves, dear, and believe me ever ever yours,\
(until I'm tome one else's), Selina Simple.\

Aao<ra6os, the people-rbuser; while her falsetto proves that the tone of\
the prudent maiden goddess is as high as ever it was in the days of the\
Greeks and Trojans. But, oh my heart! Oh, Venus! Oh, Aphrodite!\
with your large languishing eyes and beautiful hair! Every one knows\
what the Judgment of Paris was, and, on our word and honour, that of\
London must coincide with it. Here Boxkeeper take me away, and\

her son? The words seemed a trouble to this young lady, who ought\
to be reminded that she is not playing "Love in Idleness." To the\
tune of the " Groves of Blarney" we may sing, for we must sing, "that's\
the humour of it,"\'97\

We read, by SW-light, that, at the Congress of Malines, one speaker\
was for acknowledging no country, but merging all national distinctions\
in the sole sovereignty of the Pope; and he was loudly cheered for his\
suggestion. Pope, Pope, Pope, hooray!\
Pomanus sum citis is not exactly what this enthusiast wished to be\
able to say. The Roman Citizens want to be freemen of United Italy.\
If the devotee of Pio Nono, who would fain have the Pope-Monarch to\
rule over himself and his associates, were to state accurately what be\
desires to be, he would say Pomanus sum servus. Perhaps he would\
think it hard if the law of his own country were to const itute him an alien,\
and his fellow citizens or subjects were to treat him as such, and turn\
him out. It is a pity that people who, like this thoroughgoing PaP151\}\
wish to transfer their allegiance to the Pope, and there were many of\
them at Malines, cannot, all of them together, go and occupy some\
uninhabited island, there to be governed bv a Papal Lord\'97Lieutenant\

I A BROAD HINT.\
When wnx oub Travelling; Fellow Countrymen learn not to make such\
Guts of themselves on the Continent? If this Bbiton would only look at\
those three young French Fellows opposite him, and learn a Lesson of\
Taste, what a difference it would make I\
FLYING LADIES.\
The last novelty with which the French Goddess of Fashion has endowed her\
votaresses, is a bold thine in leggings; long high-heeled boots, "extending up to\
the calf." Calves! Well. Plush, in the shape of bonnets, decorates heads; what\
next will it set off, think you, Mb. John Thomas? The new chaussure wherein the\
ladies about the Imperial Court admire themselves and each other, and amaze man-\
kind, appears to be something between the Napoleon, and what we may call the\
Sykes or house-breaker's anklejack. Adjoined to the becoming articles of feminine\
apparel above described are walking-sticks, equally becoming, made of ivory, prettily\
mottled and speckled, wherewith the booted belles, models of the beau sexe, strut\
about delightfully conscious\'97\
"Of the nice conduct of a clouded cane.*\
Hooped petticoats, high-heels, and walking-sticks! What more can Beauty\
desire, to .attain the perfection of costume, but a steeple-crowned hat P Only one\
thing. Approximation to Mother Shipton requires the addition of a broom.\
That would indeed be pretty; and useful too.\
The other day, according to a paragraph in a newspaper, a lady, on a visit to\
Dover, was blown over the pier, a depth of thirty feet, into two or three feet of\
water. She was not much hurt. The wind, which caught her dress as she was\
standing on the top of some steps, let her down lightly. Fortunately it did not\
carry her out to sea, where, without a rudder to steer her course with, she would\
have been lost. This case, however, suggests the possibility that ladies might be\
enabled to fly by the suitable arrangement of a flighty style of dress. With a very\
slight expansion of the present circumference of hoops, a lady might, at pleasure,\
by adjusting her Crinoline to the direction of the blast, at least in a high wind,\
get caught up aloft and transported through the air to considerable distances. She\
would thus, with the help of a broom, serving the same purpose as that of a bird's\
tail, precisely accomplish the art of flying as practised by Mrs. Shipton and her\
sisterhood. Of course the broom would oe an ornamental one, a fancy broom, the\
broomstick gilt, for instance, and bound with green, blue, or red morocco leather,\
or otherwise decorated.\
Crowded thoroughfares and public places, now subject to that grievous obstruc-\
tion which is evermore created by Crinoline, would be relieved of it as often as the\
wearers of that combination of parachute and petticoats\
rose from the pavement, or promenade, and took a flight of\
some distance overhead.\
The broom would at any rate be a most eflicient adjunct\
to the witchery of that charming style of dress which\
French ladies nave adopted, and English ladies will copy.\
The Illustrious Lady who rules the world of fiddle-faddle\
needs only appear with a broom added to her rig-out to set\
the elegant fashion of wearing brooms. No doubt the\
example of the Empress op the French would be fol-\
lowed by the great majority of the female sex if her Im-\
perial Majesty were to take to wearing rings in her nose.\
THE MODERN FRIAR OF ORDERS GRAY.\
It was a Friar of Orders Gray,\
Who'd preach in Munster Square,\
At the Church of St. Mary Magdalen,\
And crowds, I trow, went there.\
Now Friars of Orders Gray, you know,\
Must walk about barefooted;\
But to some constitutions this\
Is not exactly suited.\
So after Brother Ignatius\
Had daily shown his toes,\
One morn, says he, " Good gracious?\
I've got a cold in my nose."\
From his home he sent a letter\
To the Shepherd of Munster Square,\
To inform the Fold, that a dreadful cold\
Would prevent his.coming there.\
Oh, wrathful was the Shepherd\
Of the Flock in Munster Square,\
And he bounded like a leopard,\
All up the pulpit-stair.\
And says: "The Friar of Orders Gray,\
Whom ye came here to see,\
Has written a letter just to say,\
That here he will not be.\
"By cold and a sort of hoarseness,\
He's of his voice bereft;"\
At this, with a touch of coarseness,\
He pointed over his left.\
"A monk, forsooth, with a cold! in bed!\
His conduct's niminy-pim'ny!\
Why, a cowl's of no more use to his head,\
Than 'tis to my smokeless chimney.\
"If we'd given him forty or fifty pound,\
Or one of those sums twice told,\
We shouldn't have heard, as you'd have found,\
A word of his dreadful cold.\
"Of course you clearly see the cause,\
There's nothing to be earned;\
We don't take money at the doors,\
Or it would be returned.\
"But / will preach you a sermon,\
If you'll be content with me,"\
And lie preached on the Dews of Hermon,\
Sweet as Christian charity.\
"tOh. beauteous are those feet, they say,\
Who press the Hill-top dews;\
But a modern Friar of Orders Grey,\
Ought to walk about in shoes."\
On Dit.\
In the Scotch Athletic Sports which took place in the\
presence of the Prince of Wales, one Donald Dinne\
carried off most of the prizes.\
"Who is that?" asked his Royal Highness, pointing to\
the stalwart peasant.\
"The Dee-side Champion, Sir," was the answer.\
"Dee-side Champion!" quoth his Koyal Highness,\
pleasantly, " That he is, Dee-cided[y.".\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
\
FROM OUR ILL-USED CONTRIBUTOR.\
To Mr. Puntk.\
The Tempi*.\
Boras are getting intolerable,\
my dear Mr. Punch. I will\
not stay in Town any longer.\
One owes a duty, of course,\
to one's employers, but one\
owes an older and higher duty\
to oneself. I dare say that\
you do not know who wrote\
the lines, " I see a hand you\
cannot see that beckons me\
away." Well, I do know.\
They were written by Thomas\
Tickell, who died in 1710,\
and (previously) wrote in the\
Spectator. They came into\
my head when I was teeing a\
lady off at the Station of .the\
Great Northern Railway, and\
when I beheld a painted hand\
fointing the way to the trains,\
feel that I must depart from\
Town, and I abstain from\
leaving an address, so that\
your tyrannous indignation\
may have time to expend itself\
on your menials instead of me.\
"Go, show your slaves how\
choleric you are." I assure\
you that I am acting in your\
interest, if you could only see\
things in that light. I don't\
want your money. Limpets\
from the rock, a biscuit soaked\
in sea-water (the artist's break-\
fast in the Home of the Seven\
Gables), a few shrimps\'97such\
is enough for me at the sea-\
side. Anything but the silent\
and solitary system at the\
club, though all the luxuries\
in season are on the carte, and stewed partridge is not the worst dish in the\
world.\
If there is one delightful and instructive walk in London, it is the south side of\
the Strand. Emerge from the deep solitudes and awful cells of the Temple, and turn\
your respectable nose Westward with me, my friend. What can we not see as we\
slowly wander with onr faces to the 8un, who, by the way, makes a mistake in\
shining in that direction in the afternoon\'97it is the only drawback to perfect enjoy-\
ment. For he glares in your eyes, and you cannot distinguish the countenances of I\
those you meet in time to avoid those whom you do not wish to meet. Posterity I\
will twist the Strand a little, and amend this fault, unless the Sun himself shall\
correct it by some alteration of the precession of the equinoxes, or some rectification\
of the altitude of the azimuth, or other astronomical reform. But let us be bold.\
The slothful man saith, "there is a lion in the path." We shall not see any lions\
(even at the Nelson Column), and we will hope to meet no bores. Let us commence\
our course of study, even before we pass under Messrs. Child's book closet. I\
would modify Dr. Johnson's sly thought, as we go through the Bar. I would be\
loth to have my head upon it, for it is the only head I have. But I could be well\
pleased, were my name "mingled with those" of depositors in yon aged Bank.\
You, Mr. Punch, might\'97but I say no more. All comes to him who knows how to\
wait. And I am an excellent waiter\'97ask the lovelv girls on whom I attended so\
.sedulously at that pic-nic at Hampton Court, at which to my deep regret, Mrs.\
Epicurus was prevented from attending.\
Look at all these wonderful instruments in this window. Here is a thermometer\
that tells you how cold it will be on Christmas Eve next. Here is a storm-glass\
that informs you what kind of weather you will have on your birthday, next year.\
Here is a telescope, very cheap, that will enable you to hear the doves cooing in the\
planet Venus. Here is a microscope that shows you that your skin, which you look\
at so complacently is coarser than the sail-cloth of the yot in which I hope to be\
when you read this. Proceed we. Whose fairy fountains are these, and why doth\
that golden ball dance in the water? Read the thanks of your Sovereign for an\
unequalled filter. Now,we come to philtres of another kind\'97love-charms. Here\
is a window full of delicate devices in gold and silver. We are past those things,\
my friend, but a set of handsome studs would be acceptable to me, and your taste\
is unexceptionable. You will think about it? Bless you. On then, nor pause to\
note that array of portmanteaux and traveller's bags, or you may tempt me into\
thoughts that may carry me away before my time. Here is the office of the great\
Illustrated newspaper, the treasure of all homes from China to Peru, and this week\
it has a portrait of Thomas Carlyle, Talus with the Iron Flail, destroyer of Shams.\
1 grieve that he should waste years in unravelling Prussian scoundrelisms, chiefly\
of the vulgar sort, but we truly great men sometimes cast ourselves away for a time,\
as I am doing now. Let us look at these\
There is you, my friend, and there is I, but\
neither of\
our fine faces is justice done\'97let us proceed. This is a\
fine shop with its plate glass and its ivories and dressing-\
cases. What ancient philosopher, led through a fair,\
pleasingly remarked, "What a number of things that I do\
not want?" Halt\'97for it were highly convenient not to be\
run over by the fiery steeds and scarlet carts which bear a\
name I think I have heard before\'97the name of Smith.\
Each of those carts, my friend, would furnish matter for an\
essay\'97it is rude to yawn, my friend, when a gentleman, a\
talking to you.\
When will the respected owner of this picture-shop\
remove that portrait of the fat priest of the Anglican per-\
suasion, whose countenance speaketh of port wine and plu-\
rality V I have been looking at it for fifteen years at leas'.\
I never looked to see the name. I dare lay he was a good\
man, but I am weary of his nose. Here is a great photo-\
graphic chemist\'97observe that noble likeness of t!\
Laureate, and recite to me ihe best passages from \'a3nock\
Arden, while I smoke a cigar in this airy side-street. \\- .\
prefer going on. Be it so. Here is an intelligent lady wb:\
selleth Parian ornaments, delicate statuettes\'97remember he:\
when you have caused displeasure at home, and would re-\
instate yourself in the good graces of Mrs. Ptjnch. This 15\
Somerset House. Tell me whence its name, who built it,\
and what is the use of the Audit Office? 1 iawt.noragtime-\
met men who could resolve me the first two demands, never\
could I get an answer to the third. For the Audit is a\
sham. Boys are sometimes sent by mischievous younr\
gentlemen to run in and ask the Porter for "tiwo-rpenn'orth\
of audits;" but they come out bewailing and rubbing thej-\
ears. Do you see that watch-face high up below a window;\
I was told, when a child, by an uncle, that an Irish labourer,\
repairing the place, fell, and was caught by Ins watch on i\
nail, and saved. I believed this. Later in life, I learned \\\
that the little dial was put there to test the power of certain\
Government telescopes. I immediately disbelieved every-'\
tiling that my Uncle had ever told me. Observe the moral,\
if you have any nephews, my friend, and never tell them lies\
that can be found out.\
Pictorial art is in fall blaze as we proceed, and it is de-\
lightful to think how much of it one can buy for a little\
money in these days. But if we are to linger at this great\
book-shop, we most give up t he afternoon to it. The mere\
titles, if carefully read, would make a man fit for intel-\
lectual society. When the good time comes, and, pike in\
hand, I plunder London, I shall make a merciless sweep\
here, for I have a fine taste for books, so the proprietors\
know what to expect. This is Waterloo Bridge. Ton\
remind me that Canova said it was worth coming to\
England to see it. Canova was a great man, but I lore\
not his Dancing-girls. Let us discuss the true principles c f\
sculpture. Nof My friend, the Strand is lost on you.\
Anybody can stare into windows, but it is the lessons they\
suggest which gives value to the walk- Here are telegraph\
wires\'97thick as an elephant's leg, thin as a girl's skipping\
rope. Recite Tennyson's Skipping Rope, and say why it is\
not in the later editions. Or come on, for I cannot listen\
to a preachment over these wires, and the progress of sci-\
ence binding nations together\'97we get all that in graptue\
leading articles, apropos whereof, here is the office of that\
excellent journal, the Globe, a most readable paper, very\
shrewd and epigrammatic. Do you know who writes the\
Paris letter f What is the Latin for naiiircp?\
Why do you want to walk faster\'97we cannot dine before\
seven\'97what could we do with the rest of the evening f\
You want to consider the dinner before ordering it. O,\
my friend, this is luxury, yet include John the Gilt when\
you are meditating on our fishes. "What beauties does\
Flora disclose" as we pass this magazine of sweet odours\
once Ackerhann's, as in the days of Thomas Moore, who\
bade the Marchesa come to the Palace,\'97\
"With the nowest No-Popery sermon that '8 going:\
O bid her come, with her bright treasea flowing,\
All gentle and juvenile, curly and pray.\
In tho manner of Ackermann's dresses for May."\
People could write in those days, Mr. Punch, no offence\
to you, Sir, who can also write. I perceive your glances\
across the road. No, the pictured Leah is not there now,\
and the real Leah reposes on the broad breast of Ocean, but\
he is bearing her back to us, and she shall be welcome as\
the flowers in the month above mentioned. Ha! There\
will be no more sense to be got out of or into you, now\
that this fountain of sentiment has been unsealed; so\

Anticipating,\
rail to the Times, we beg _\
to the existence of certain difficulties on the Cruxregis Line, which\
rsnder the journey from the Metropolitan Terminus to Capfield, less\
agreeable and enjoyable than it might be. These difficulties, attracting\
to themselves but a very small share of popular notice, have existed for\
a long time, ever since, in fact, the formation of the Line, and may be\
termed Railway Cuttings into Conversation.\
By way of illustration, let us suppose the interior of a first-class\
carnage in the up-train, occupied by an elderly gentleman bound for the\
City, who has clandestinely brought away with him the Time* from the\
family breakfast table, in order to enjoy his Earliest Intelligence quietly\
in the train, and profitably spend the hour of locomotion. Given also in\
the same carriage, a Junior Partner in a Banking firm, wishing to\
strengthen a novel theory upon the subject of Discount, by mas-\
tering a financial article in the Economist; a sporting man, with a paper\
containing the weights, and the latest state of the odds, with which it is\
necessary that he should become thoroughly acquainted, if he is to "pull\
off" anything at the next meeting; and a Stock Exchange man, who,\
wishing to be on a pleasant footing with the Banker, tries to engage\
him in a semi-sportnnanJike conversation as to the scarcity of coverts,\
the shyness of the birds, and price of land.\
These gentlemen, each, intent upon his own particular pursuit, are to\

several tunnels, cutting, at brief intervals, into their reading or conver-\

This statement may be\
questioned, but we think\
the fact quite possible, and\
we have certainly no evi-\
dence to show that it is not\
so. We have often heard\
of persons remembering an\
incident by remembering a\
scent with which it is asso-\
ciated. We know that\
Jones, for instance, never\
eats roast goose with its interior concomitants, without the smell\
thereof reminding him of how he snatched a kiss in his early days of\
courtship, and how his Julia reproached him for approaching her when\
he had eaten\'97sniff! she need not ask him what. Instead then of denying\
that the nose affects the mind and may invigorate the memory, we would\
take those facts for granted, and see what may be made of them. If\
smells refresh the memory, why should not the nose be utilised and\
trained as a mnemonical assistant, and used in 'education both at\
Colleges and Schools? Were a student to read Homer with some\
refreshing perfume besprinkled on his handkerchief, that scent in after\
life might freshen up his knowledge of the Iliad and Odyssey, and call\
to mind some classic beauty he might otherwise forget. So a tough\
problem of Euclid might perchance be brought to mind by a sniff of\
Eau de Cologne, while an argument of Paley might be stamped upon\
the memory by a whiff of peppermint.'ascending through the nose.\
If scents can thus be utilised, a competitive examination would be\
determined in favour of the man who had not merely the most nous,\
but the most nose. This at least would be the case supposing that the\
power of smell be enjoyed in fair proportion to mere longitude of\
nose. Whether this be so is more than we can say; and we may leave\
the point to be decided by those persons who may deem it worth,\
determining.\

Dear Sm,\
I write without the knowledge, yet I hope not at the risk'of\
the displeasure of my Venerable Friend\'97it is needless for me to say that\
I allude to the great and good Dr. Johnson\'97to invite your polite and\
candid attention to a fact which is not only in a high degree interesting\
in itself, but which is almost invaluable when we regard it as a new\
proof of the sagacity of that remarkable man. Semper vigilant in ade\
lares.\
When the authorities of the City of London were about to construct\
the bridge which was at the time destined to be adorned by the noble\
and illustrious title of the Earl of Chatham, but which vulgar persons\
have been permitted to call by the commonplace and local name of\
Blackfriars, there was considerable controversy as to the best method\
of building the viaduct in question. My venerable friend, of course,\
adopted the cause of good sense and of sound reason, and advocated a\
plan which was not ultimately adopted. His letters in the Gazetteer\
are among the most favourable specimens of his multifarious wisdom,\
and it is difficult to understand how, when Dr. Johnson had favoured\
the public with his opinions on that or any other subject, they should\
fail to carry conviction. But nemo omnibus horis sapit. The City\
authorities\'97gentlemen whose urbanity and hospitality 1 have not the\
slightest intention of denying\'97were unable to see the extraordinary\
force of Dr. Johnson's arguments, and the work was entrusted to a\
countryman of mine, Mr. Mylne, of whom I have every desire to speak\
with respect.\
Little more than a century has elapsed, Sir, and the bridge has ceased\
to be a safe or commodious means of transit. Temporary appliances\
produced temporary security at the cost of unsightliness in the struc-\
ture and obstruction to the navigation. The bridge is already in course\
of demolition, and that which should have been for ages a metropolitan\
thoroughfare is now a scene in which Hibernian labourers contend,\
with frightful and profane exclamations, for the honour of causing the\
largest amount of destruction within an allotted,period of time. TFere\
I permitted to be jocose, I might playfully say that the Saint, NEPOXm.\
to whom the Greek Church superstitiously assigns the guardianship oi\
bridges, because a legend asserts that he was cast from such an edifice\
into the stream, must smile in derision upon the ruins of Chatham\
Bridge. But, Sir, when the reputation of a sage\'97my good and renc-\
rable friend, Dr. Johnson\'97is at stake, it is no time for levity, and 1\
am reminded by himself that dulce est desipere in loco.\
My design in this communication is to recal to your recollection the\
circumstance that Dr. Johnson was dissatisfied with the plan on which\
the bridge was constructed, and that little more than a century has\
vindicated the great philosopher's wisdom. It might not be an un-\
worthy recognition of his character, and of the profound sense which he\
displayed in connection with the subject, were the new bridge to bear\
the honoured name of Samuel Johnson.\

A VISIT TO MYNHEER VAN DUNK.\
Dear Punch,\
Schbvening is the Ratnsgate, Brighton, Hastings and Scar-\
borough of Holland, and is distant only a short league from the Hague.\
If youhave fourpence you may ride there through a tunnel of green trees,\
under which is a horse Train-way, constructed on the Yankee plan that\
'bus drivers abused with so much vocal vehemence when it was tried in\
London. When suddenly I stumbled on this tramway at the Hague, I\
said to a reflective fellow tourist at my elbow, "Now here we see good\
proof that the Dutchman hath a genius for mechanical invention even\
as hath the go-ahead American or Briton. This railway is no doubt of\
purely Dutch construction; Dutch both in manufacture and in the men\
who manage it." While thus I eloquent discoursed, behold, up came a\
first-class carriage; and, to confirm my words, I overheard this frag-\
ment of a dialogue between the Dutch Sub-manager and Dutch driver\
of the train:\'97\
First Dutchman \{hastily). Now then, where's them 'orses' cloths,\
Bill?\
Second ditto \{calmly). Aven't got 'em 'ere.\
First ditto \{savagely). Aven't got 'em 'ere P Then why the\'97British\
expletive\'97ain't yer got 'em ere?\
Schevening I should say must be a good place to be idle at, for there\
are no nice shells to pick up, and no nice cliffs to climb, and no nice\
boats to hire for fishing. All that you can do there, if you want some\
occupation, is to scramble up some sandhills until you fill your shoes,\
and then every five seconds to pull them off and empty them. Or you\
may take a bath from a wonderful machine, a sort of old yellow post-\
chaise with an awning where the back should be. As the shore is very\
flat, you have to wade some distance before you wet your knees; but\
you will feel relieved to think that you are not in modest England, and\
therefore not exposed to telescopic observation.\
I think the straw hats of the fishwomen are decidedly the things\
the most worth looking at in Schevening (except perhaps the cottages\
where live the wearers, which are a lesson to our poor folk in the way\
of cleanliness). Mighty structures are these straw hats, an inch thick\
at the least, and turned up in the side-brim to the semblance of a\
cheese-cutter. Atop of them huge fish-baskets are balanced with much\
ease, while the broad brims save from soiling the neat white close-frilled\
caps, and clean-washed faces under them. Except among the visitors,\
I saw no Crinoline at Schevening; but I was grieved to see that else-\
where its invasion was observable. And it pained me to remark that\
bonnets were more common than they were ten years ago, and that the\
splendid old Dutch skull-plates were going out of fashion. These,\
however, you still see upon some country village swellesses, who it may\
be have inherited their grandeur from their grandmothers. Here ana\
there too you still see the corkscrew horns or hairpins, which are worn\
so as to stick ont on both sides of the forehead, and are intended, I\
believe, to frighten male admirers from attempting osculation.\
Patrice quit exul Sea quoque fugit ?\'97you can't well get to Holland\
without crossing the sea; and haply this to some people may act as a\
deterrent. For myself, I sailed there in a yacht, and so escaped the\
many smells a steamboat's atmosphere is air to. (By the by, O brother\
yachtsman, bear in mind when you cruise there, to take your dingay\
with yon. A pull along the not-unlike-to-Venice streets of Rotterdam\
is an amusing after-breakfast little bit of exercise, and funnily astonishes\
the minds of female natives. Besides, there is famous gull and spoon-\
bill, and teal, and other wildfowl shooting in the river, and bathing with\
a seal in sight is quite a new thing to a Cockney.) But even, if you go\
by steam the trip will well repay you. In this fast used-up age it is\
worth a little seasickness to get a little novelty, and a few days at\
the Hague will freshen your mind more than a good many at\
Hastings. In the matter of amusements, if you are fond of music,\
you may hear Mozart for nothing; and if you want to shake your\
toes, you may go to a "Groot Bal met buitengewone iUuminatie,"\
without any fear of finding it a foreign copy of Cremorne. You may\
improve your Dutch, moreover, by studying the shop-fronts, and\
speculating what is meant by "Tapperii en Slitterij," and whether\
from the common word "cigarrenhandel" it be . fair to guess that\
handles are sold there for cigars. When you travel by a Spoorweg.\
or a railway as we call it, you will find the fare is posted on a board\
outside the station, and that it is also printed on your ticket, to\
save you from the chance of being swindled by the clerk; ana as\
the guard can walk along the tram just when he pleases, you will\
not much fear being murdered if you chance to fall asleep. Then\
if you love pictures, you may see Paul Potter's Bull and the Anatomy\
School of Rembrandt: and you may feast your eyes upon the kitchen\
scenes of Tenters, the minutenesses of Uteris, the sea-pieces of Van-\
dbrveldt, and the drolleries of Jan Steen. By way of further novelty,\
you will not see an English painting in the galleries, and this a little\
may surprise you, remembering what clever fellows you have left in\
Easel Street and Maulstick Square at home. But everywhere you go,\
you will see people who look the pictures of happiness and health, who\
may remind you of some English living pictures you have love for.\
Clean, frugal and industrious; honest, civil and obliging; the Dutch\
are not by any means a bad people to live among; and although John\
Bull of course stands A 1 in the world, he might learn a few good\
lessons from his friends across the sea. Men make money in Holland\
as well as they do here, and to me they seem to make it far more quietly\
and easily, and without the worry, flurry, and the wearing, tearing,\
hurry-scurry now so common here.\
Holland is, in fact, a pleasant country for a holiday, to those who\
have no wish to make a labour of their leisure. There are no mountains\
to climb, and but few lions to visit. The Haarlem organ is the principal,\
but the afternoon I heard it, it was sadly out of tune, or else it may be,\
I was. I was repaid though for my visit by seeing a Dutch christening.\
The mothers sat in a big pew just underneath the pulpit; and at a given\
signal the babies were brought in, each covered with a napkin, like a\
tray of things for lunch. Each in turn was then uncovered and thrice\
sprinkled by the priest, who sternly gave the mothers such a longwinded\
jobation, that I should think they would be careful not to have another\
christening to go through, if they anyhow could help it.\
Moreover, let me hint that, though the beer is bad, the Schiedam is\
undeniable; and 0 Brother, you can buy cigars at four or five a penny,\
and can actually smoke them without suffering much harm. So take\
a trip through Dutchland before going up the Rhine; and you will\
enjoy the mountains more, for the molehills you have left.\
Believe me, Punch, my booooy,, yours with every etcetera of my\
etcetera etcetera etcetera, Vagabundus.\

No. II.\'97GWRYSTHLOGWDD (Continued).\
7 p.m. A Beautiful Summer's Evening.\'97Before knocking at the Inn-\
door\'97it struck me that it must indeed be a very quiet place, where one\
had to knock at the door of the hostelrie, in order to attract attention\'97\
before knocking I surveyed the exterior. It was everything in a rural\
way that could be desired. Honeysuckles, wild^oses, and tame roses\
too for aught I know, mingled with the ivy, that, in climbing up to the\
roof, almost hid the windows from view. I cannot say whether it was\
the ivy that mingled with the honeysuckles or the honeysuckles with\
the ivy, not being a horticulturist, but the general effect led me to ex-\
claim, with much feeling, "This is indeed quiet; this is indeed'charming:\
here could I stay for ever: let me enter within the pretty rustic porch,\
and make inquiries."\
I fancy I hear a growl. No doubt about it. Within the rustic porch,\
right in front of the door, lies an enormous dog, of a shaggy and uncom-\
promising appearance. Let me see: let me try to remember some\
anecdotes of savage animals, and the way to master them. There's\
nothing like fixing your eye upon them. I do this, and he fixes his eye\
on me. I advance one step: the intelligent animal lifts his nostrils up\
quiveringly, and displays his teeth, still growling. 11 I retreat, he will\
follow me; if I advance, it is evident that he will be down upon me\'97\
very much down upon me. I say "Poo' fellow, there, poo' old flow!"\
and try to appear as if I wasn't afraid of him. He's not to be taken\
in\'97evidently a dog not to be trifled with. 'Pon my word, 'tis very\
wrong to leave him out here. It's very dangerous. Where's Owen's\
mate, and the rest of the combatants? All disappeared. My involun-\
tary turning at this moment towards the beach has roused my canine\
detective. He is on all-fours. I never saw such an uncouth beast. I\
have been since informed that they are very common in Wales, and ruu\
about loose over the mountains.\
The inn-door was suddenly opened by a gentleman, who (as I subse-\
quently ascertained) filled the lucrative offices of Boots-and-Stableman;\
this undaunted person said grrrrrrrrrrr to the dog; and the animal, who\
was nothing more than a bully after all, making a great show before a\
stranger, slunk off, growling and gurgling within his hairy self.\
"Is my portmanteau comef" I inquire. A buxom, trim-looking,\
elderly female appears. The Landlady, doubtless. Yes, a portmanteau\
has arrived. There it was. Mine P Yes. Now, if you please, would\
you show me to a room P Can't do that! Why not P Because there\
isn't a room. Oh !" At least not empty. You see, sir," she goes on.\
to explain, "It's Saturday." This did not at first sight make the case\
much clearer, and strongly reminded me of Winklebeach and. the\
Butcher. "And on Saturday, you see, Sir, there's them Excur-\
sionists "The what? "The Excursionists from Bangor, and\
Beaumaris, and all such places. Lor' bless you! and we has 'em from\
Chester too, sometimes, tor the fishing and picnicking." I sat down on\
my portmanteau. "The pleasure parties" (Pleasure parties! confound\
'em ?) "all stops here." Bright idea 1 I will go where the pleasure\
parties do not stop. Come, Boots, shoulder my portmanteau to the\
other Inn. "The other Inn! Lor" bless you f there ain't no other\
Inn!" But I can't get back to Beaumaris. No, they say, I can't do\
that. Welh then, what can I do? I want dinner and a bed: only for\
to-night. Landlady looks at Boots, Boots at her. They'll manage it\
somehow. There are some young College gentlemen, who are on a\
reading party, as wouldn't mind my joining them. They've got the\
sofas, and a mattrass or two, in the parlour. I can have a shake-down\
under the table, or on it, if I like. Here's a prospect! Where are all\
the people now? Oh, they've not come in yet? They're out fishing\
and amusing themselves: some have gone out to the coast by Llan-\
dudno, shooting Puffins. Did I ever see a Puffin? No; hang the\
Puffin! What11 I have for dinner? As usual, what have they got?\
Well, there's a nice piece of beef. Good! the very thing. "They had\
that for luncheon," says a neat waitress, who has been summoned to\
the conclave. Who's they? The young gentlemen from College.\
Well, what else besides beef? A nice cold fowl. Good! By all\
means, fetch the fowl. Waitress is afraid there aren't much left o' that.\
It turned out that there was nothing left of that. "The young gents had\
taken it out, with some Tongue, thinking as they might be hungry."\

There is a peaceful air about this place, that inclines me to commune\
with myself, in my note-book. The hum of the insects soothes me. I\
wish that man had not begun mending something or other in the yard.\
I don't know what it is, but it seems to require a great deal of ham-\
mering. The Landlady comes out smilingly. She is saying something\
f o me. I really can't near a word. She gives me to understand (by\
dint of shouting, in opposition to the hammer) that they can accommo-\
date me with a Ded, but not a room to myself. They've got an old iron\
bedstead, which Owen is nailing together. Oh, thank you. That is,\

Owen, 1 believe? Yes, that is the name of the Boots. It is her name\

Evan Owen or Owen Evan, for variety.\

"Hollo! Mrs. Owen!" "Here we are, again!" More senseless\
whoowhooping and shouting announces the arrival of the Three Jovial\
Collegians.\
Mas. Owen explains my peculiarly painful position. They say, " Oh,\
all right!" and dispense with any further ceremony by at once hoping\
that I have a good appetite, and asking me whether I should prefer\
having my dinner at once, or adopting ttie alternative of waiting until 1\
got it? This was put to me by the shortest of the three, and elicited a\
roar of laughter. Such laughter! you could have heard it miles off.\
"We've only," said the tallest, "a very quiet little dinner!" Quiet!\
Is it possible P It may be; but not another day do I stop here, if I can\
possibly help it.\

EQUALITY BEFORE THE TAX-GATHERER.\
A Writer on "The Inland Revenue," in the Saturday\
Review, expresses a hope that certain wealthy manufac-\
turers have learned to apply the true test to the com-\
parative taxation of earnings and of realised property,"\
and adds:\'97\
"They arc concluded by their own admission that it is not\
business of tho tax-gatherer to correct tho inequalities of fortune."\
Just so. That is not the tax-gatherer's business.\
Therefore an improvement on our present fiscal arrange-\
ments, which have been made with some little regard to\
the inequalities of fortune, would be taxation imposed with\
none at all.\
One uniform poll-tax, levied equally on everybody whose\
fortune it would not exceed, and on everybody else to the\
extent of his whole fortune, would constitute the perfection,\
of that indifference to the inequalities of fortune which is\
not quite reached by Schedule 1).\

TWO PEARLS IN ONE SETTING.\
See this jewel of an advertisement, which appeared the other morning\
one of our cheap newspapers:\'97\
If ANTED, a CHILD to WET-NURSE. Aged 26. dood health.\'97\

\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  Address, 4c.\
Men of sixty are quite commonly addressed or talked of as "old\
>ys," but this is the first time we ever heard of a child" being of\
ie age of six-and-twenty. In extreme old age men come to what is\
died their second childhood, but they are not such babies then that\
ley have need to be wet-nursed. , To want a child of six-and-twenty\
;ars of age for that purpose certainly to our notion appears a little\
ngular; T)ut the following announcement, which appeared in the same\
ewspaper, seems to show that there are "children" who require to\
3 nursed when they are over twenty:\'97\
J URSE WANTED, in a Small Family, where there are three children,\
'age not under 20.\
Unless these children all be dwarfs, it seems to us absurd to call this\
"small family." How can a family be small that has three great\
ulkine members of an "age not under twenty." We wonder, are I\
lese children still attired in Dibs and tuckers, or have they yet arrived\
; the maturity of pinafores? And we wonder even more why a nurse j\
wanted for them. Is she required to keep them from falling out of.\
indow, or from tumbling into the fire? Has she to take care against\
leir eating too much pudding, or swallowing too many lollipops, orj\
laking suckers of their thumbs? Will she have to take these "children,\
je not under twenty,'* out in a perambulator, and will she box their j\
irs if they do not sit quite quiet in it, the while she flirts a bit with, i\
)me fine soldier in the Park? A hundred other questions naturally |\
ccur to us, when we find a nurse is wanted for children so advanced in\
?e; but although we put some of our questions here in print, we have\
o wish to be bothered by receiving any answers to them.\

intolerable rubbish that persons,\'97because they have been for a few miles\
or for a few days on the Continent,\'97think they are privileged to bore\
their friends with the moment they return amongst them. Of all bores\
I think the travelling bore is the one that goes to the greatest lengths\
in his powers of boredom. The man who goes to the top of Mont\
Blanc should be condemned to squat there for the remainder of his h'e>\
to prevent his ever touching on the subject in any other form after-\

TRIUMPH OF HOMOEOPATHY.\
Italian doctors bled Cavour for typhus. H Pids the Noth had\
been Alexander the Sixth, they would be suspected of having been\
feed by the Pope. Cavour died.\
General de Willisen, Prussian Minister at Rome, was seized the\
other day, with "pemiciosa" fever. The doctors did not kill him.\
His physician was a homceopathist. The only cure for the permdom;\
a sort of ague caused by malaria, is quinine in large doses. That\
remedy m those quantities was not prescribed for General db mi-\
lisen. The General was physicked with globules. He died in a S\'bb\
hours. Pemiciosa fever alone killed him. Typhus apart from treat-\
ment, did not kill Cavour. So homoeopathy triumphs on the whole.\

SOLUTION OF A DIFFICULTY.\
Everybody knows that there are in existence two skulls of Oltvek\
Cromwell, and tbat the smaller one is satisfactorily explained by the 1\
curator in charge thereof to have been good King Oliver's skull when I\
he was a little boy. We have now a somewhat parallel case. At the\
Archaeological Meeting at Warwick, Lord Denbigh exhibited the\
dagger with which Felton killed the Duke op Buckingham. Mr. 1\
Thistlethwayte, of Hampshire, has also the dagger with which the\
deed was done. Were it necessary to choose between the relics, we\
hope that we know our place too well not to give the verdict in favour i\
of the dagger belonging to the nobleman. But there is no need for an\
invidious selection. Felton was a very determined man, and no doubt\
took a dagger in each hand, and brought the bad duke to account by\
double entry. It is pleasant when an archaeological problem can be so\
simply solved.\
Paved with. Gold.\
Asked Mr. Disbaeli, the other day,\
"Wfi.it would have been the effect upon England if this year there had been Gold\
Draina!"\
We hardly know, but we think that England would have been very\
much astonished, and would have believed that in laying them down a\
first step was being taken to realise the provincial idea of London,\
whose streets are paved with gold. The question illustrates the gorgeous\
Oriental imagination of the Conservative leader.\

No. II.\'97GWRYSTHLOGWDD (Co:\
S'45 p.m.\'97At this hour we dined. When I say "we," I mean the\
three Jolly Companions from College, and mvself. The name of the first\
\'97I call him the first, because he was the tallest, strongest, and loudest\
of the party\'97was, as I gathered from the other two, Scissors. He had\
another name, I presume, but I didn't catch it. The second was known,\
| among the friends of his youth, as the Gorilla. I need not dwell upon\
i the peculiar fitness of this title; if Du Chaillu had seen him, he would\
I have shot him out of hand; and serve him right. The youngest and\
, smallest was invariably addressed by an initial letter, J., and always\
| spoke of himself in the third person, as J. W. H.\
I was very hungry; "so were they;" and this announcement on\
their part, seeing that they outnumbered me by two mouths, was on\
the whole, rather unsatisfactory.\
"There, Stranger," said the Scissors\'97at this appellation, by the way,\
there was a roar of laughter,\'97politely giving me the first ladle-full of\
soup, " Peg away. If you want any more you must holloa." It was a\
very small ladle and not quite full; I smiled, as cheerfully as possible,\
by way of answer, thereby wishing to intimate that I should be ready\
to " holloa" in a very short space of time. I hate holloaing, and should\
have preferred saying, politely, "Mr. Scissors, if my honourable friend\
will permit me to call him so, will you kindly oblige me with some more\
soup." The others were still hard at work with their spoons, and of\
course, though I had finished in less than a minute, I did not like to\
intrude my wants upon their necessities. J. having scarcely swallowed\
his last spoonful, had no such scruples, and at once reached out his\
plate to Scissors.\
"Allow me," said I, handing it for him in my most elegant manner.\
"All right, Stranger." All laughed at this. "J. W. H. is the boy\
for soup," said J., speaking of himself. It is but justice to him to say,\
t hat he was the boy, not only for soup, but as it afterwards appeared,\
for beef, poultry, tart, cheese, and anything that came to table. As\
I handed J. W. H.'s plate, the Gorilla was in waiting with his. My\
turn came next, but Scissors somehow managed to get another plate-\
full, while I was ringing the bell at the request of the Gorilla, who was,\
in point of fact, much nearer the bell-handle than I was.\
"Hullo, Stranger!" another roar that went through my head like i\
cannonade. "What do you want?"\
I explained that soup was my object. More laughter. Scissors to\
afraid that there was no more soup. I could have the tureen if I Kked.\
Roars of laughter.\
"If you'd only sent word that you'd been coming, you see, J. W. H."\
said that young gentleman, "would have killed the fatted veal." More\
laughter, during which the waitress enters, to know what we want.\
Strange to say, one after another deny the fact of ringing.\
"The Stranger rang," growls the Gorilla.\
"Ha! ha! ha!" Shouts of laughter.\
I am obliged to own that I did touch the bell, and am in the fooh\'bbh\
position of being unable to say for what purpose.\
"Sherry" suggests Scissors.\
"A bottle of Sherry," orders the Gorilla, surlily.\
"J. W. H. is the boy for sherry," says the least of the Jollv Col-\
legians, winking at me. Mrs. Owbn sends in her best sherry (Heaven\
defend me then from Mrs. Owen's worst!) and the repast proceeds.\
Oft as I have regretted my want of a College education, I never feat\
the want of it so much as at this moment. The cheery young fellows\
gave me many opportunities of joining in their conversation, of which I\
was no more able to avail myself, than if I had been dining with the\
chiefs of a Red Indian tribe conversing in their own native tongue.\
J. W. H. would ask, for instance, "Did I know Baxter of Corpus?"\
Well. I didn't, and though I tried my hardest to interest myself in an\
anecdote concerning the aforesaid Baxter, yet I could not but perceive,\
that my ignorance was a subject of pity to my companions who, while\
Baxter was on the tapis, did not even try to make their remarks\
intelligible.\
It was much the same when Scissors began. "Do you recollect old\
Smith?" Well, both the | Gorilla and J. W. H. recollected old\
Smith, and for the matter of that, so did I; and what was more, I said\
so. This astonished them. 1 was about to observe, jocularly, that\
Smith was not such an uncommon name as they might imagine, when\
the Gorilla inquired "whether I meant Smith of Keys?"\
"Of Keys? No. The gentleman I was alluding to was neither a\
locksmith, nor"\
Roars of laughter, in which I joined, having evidently made a joke\
without knowing it.\
"J. W. H. drinks your health, Stranger, and that of Keys!"\

"Ha! Ha! Ha!" Whereupon I nearly choked myself in my\
endeavour to laugh heartily, and drink to J. W. H. at one and the same\
moment.\
The Gorilla here rose from his chair, and slapped me violently on\
the back. He said he had heard it was good for that sort of thing.\
Thank you, much obliged. Should he do it again? No thank you,\
not again.\
"Keys," they informed me was spelt Caius: but I wasn't to be\
taken in like that.\

that "J. W. H. is the boy for pipes." And so it appears; having a\
store by him of short black navvy-looking clays, old meerschaum pipes,\
and wooden dittos. I am no great smoker, but agree to the proposition\
that a quiet cigar after dinner\'97 a quiet cigar mind you,\'97will be most\
acceptable.\

sopping:, soaking, in they come, a party of damp strangers.\
WiU the gentlemen allow a few of the party in their room," asks\
Mrs. Owen.\
"No: J. W. H. knows a trick worth two of that," is the accommo-\
reply.\
sreupon the moist Tourists, who have been, and still are, counter-\
acting the effects of the water outside by taking restoratives internally,\
become abusive, and breathe vengeance and brandy. Collegians defy\
the Tourists, and Tourists defy Collegians. Tourists prepare to storm\
the sitting-room. "If you please," I sav, "I think I should like to go\
out." Pooh! Would I side with those Snobs of Tourists! No, never!\
"We (the Collegians) will give them a licking. J. W. H. is the boy\
for a row." Confound him: he seems to be the boy for everything!\
I attempt to demonstrate that the Tourists, though undoubtedly Snobs,\

hammering at in the afternoon, has just been brought in for me. It\
appears to be ingeniously constructed of loose pieces of sharp iron,\

MUSHROOMS AND PROPERTY.\
rudent practical farmers of\
the fen counties, having\
become alive to the value\
of mushrooms, have set\
up notices warning people\
against trespassing in\
search of those fungi. The\
law relative to mushrooms\
is in an unsatisfactory state.\
Let there be no wild mush-\
rooms. Let all mushrooms\
be declared property. A\
mushroom contains the es-\
sential elements of meat;\
what more can you say of\
a sheep? Do away with\
all wild things whatsoever,\
let there be nothing wild\
any more, nothing common\
even on commons. Why\
should anybody have more\
right to take mushrooms\
from off a common than\
he has to take geese? En-\
close all commons; let\
there be no common pro-\
perty; no common air even,\
out of public buildings, except in the public roads.\
Let there be no more wild strawberries or blackberries. In some of\
the Western States of America blackberries are an article of commerce,\
might be here, are good for pies and jam, might be sold in Covent\
Garden. Make blackberries property; hips and haws also.\
Neither let there be wild plants. Many of them are medicinal;\
herbalists drive a trade in them. Eyebright will fetch from a penny to\
twopence a bunch, betony and wood sage perhaps as much. As to\
dandelion\'97why, it is worth no end of calomel. Children should no\
longer be allowed to make monkey-chains out of the flower-stalks of\
this valuable simple. All herbs and flowers called wild have at least a\
botanical value; let there be an end of wild flowers; let all flowers\
belong to the owner of the soil on which they grow. Gathering them\
ought to be made larceny, and little boys and girls, guilty of picking\
daisies and buttercups, should be liable to be sent to the House of\
Correction and whipped.\
Butterflies are worth something as entomological specimens; their\
chase, in which youth at present indulge with impunity, should be con-\
stituted an indictable offence on the part of all unauthorised persons,\
and the right to pursue and capture them should be restricted to the\
proprietors of the fields and meadows over which they flutter, or to the\
Lord of the Manor.\
It is high time to discard the antiquated notion that there is any such\
quality as wildness inherent in any natural production so as to make it\
common property. This is one of the fallacies which we have derived\
from our illiberal ancestors. The landed property of this great country\
is to a large extent passing from the hands of an hereditary aristocracy\
into those of our merchant princes, a more magnanimous class of men,\
who, having made their fortunes by commerce, know what property is,\
and what ought to be property that is not, and how to make the most\
of everything. These are the true exclusives, who only seek to exclude\
others from the acquisition of anything without paying for it. The\
doctrine that there are some things uncultivated and at large which\
nobody can claim, and anybody may take, is a relic of feudal barbarism.\
The new landed gentry of England^e too wise to permit all manner of\
persons to run about over their estates gathering mushrooms. They\
have too much respect for a mushroom.\

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHATUVAIU.\
THE ROYAL BRITISH ASSOCIATION\
UNDBR HTDROTHBRMAL INFLUENCE. a\
When we listened the other day to Sis Charles Lyell discussing\
the mysteries of geology and the hydrothermal blessings of Bath, we\
paused on one pregnant period, and we have paused on it ever since.\
The inhabitants of sea and land," said the distinguished President of\
the Association, "before and after the grand development of ice and\
snow, were nearly the same." What, said we, meditatively, is the\
grand development of ice and snow but our friend, Dr. Grusselbacr's\
development P Here are the simple terms in which that great savant's\
discovery is made known to the world, and the world in general, and\
no doubt several of the stars, will sympathise with us in our disappoint-\
ment that it was not brought before the Association in a more formal\
manner. .\
"It has been stated that Dr. Grusselback, of the University of Upsala, lately\
restored to activity a snake, which had been frozen to torpidity lor ten years. It is\
also reported that ho proposed to the Swedish Government to experiment on criminals.\
He proposes to reduce the individual to complete torpor by the gradual application\
of cold, and to icauscitato him after a year or two."\
It was no doubt very pleasant for the good people of Bath to\
hear so learned a Theban descanting on hydrothermal influence in the\
geological change, seeing that Bath owes to the same influence its\
celebrity, and the people their prosperity. But where was Dr. Grus-\
selback P <
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 . The interests of science and the propriety of the case\
required that he should be brought into the theatre in a box of ice\
preserved by his own process, and that he should be vivified by the\
President with hydrothermal applications till he stood up before the\
meeting, an evidence that he was like "other creatures before and\
after this grand development of ice and snow.\
But the Doctor Came not, and we are left to speculate on the histo-\
rical, pre-historical, and for that matter, post-historical evidence of the\
practicability of this new development of ice being as grand as the old,\
and that as ice was once, according to Sir Charles Lyell, remarkably\
r.*\'b0Aii ;\'84 \'ab\'abtho

\f0 \'95and Sir Richard Steele in the Spectator.)\
eir rum with a hatchet, and dig their water\
wiiii u aiiauo, ouu ~~ .. ~rds as they spake fell to pieces on the deck.\
Gradually there was a universal silence; they tried to sing but could\
not; they tried to shout, but it was dumb show; they made their\
mouths to whistle, but their hps blew out no sound; a musician among\
them attempted to play his flute, but the flute was voiceless:\'97\
14 'Twos so cold they could not keep tho log.\
They scarcely knew they had toes on,\
And the very skipper's voice was frozen\
For all bis grog."\
But all of a sudden there came a thaw, and the air was straightway\
filled with voices. Every man heard himself talking at a distance, the\
skipper's voice was heard shouting out orders away to leeward; the\
boatswain was awoke by hearing himself swearing his customary oaths,\
while in his hammock below. Several songs were heard sung at once\
by unseen singers, and the cook's flute on the galley shelf (after several\
stray notes by way of overture) played a tune or two of its own accord.\
It was not till after some reflection that the crew saw through this\
mystery, and concluded as a matter of course that the sounds which now\
fell from the rigging, and rose from the sea and the cabin companion\
way, and the ship's hold, were the frozen-up shouts, sougs, oaths, tunes,\
ana attempts at conversation let loose by the thaw.\
This was one example of the "grand developnient of the ice and\
snow." Another which we have read of was the discovery of the bodies\
of a number of people who had been frozen up in an Alpine Pass for a\
period of some eighteen years. Some of them were subjected to Sir\
Charles Lyell's "hydrothermal influence," and were likely to be\
brought to life when the director of the experiment discovered the body\
of an uncle whose estate he had inherited, and consequently gave up\
the experiment as a bad job. Indeed the hydrothermal system, which\
has had so much to do in the internal affairs of the earth, and which has,\
according to Sir Charles, transformed bits of Roman bricks into opals\
in the ancient aqueduct at Piombieres, is a most important domestic as\
well as geological agent. It melts rocks and it moulds husbands. We\
all know what it is to be kept in hot water, if not from our own expe-\
rience, at least from that of others; we can accordingly appreciate what\
it has done, and is doing, and will do; we can trust to it as the great\
agent for counteracting, in due time, the antiphlogistic treatment pro-\
posed by Dr. Grusselback. A great opportunity for proving the\
effects of both was lost, when in 1843 Middendore, digging for odds\
and ends among. Siberian ice, came upon the'complete carcase; of a\
mammoth, which had been preserved ui a frozen mass for\
thousand years. Here was nature anticipating the TJpsala Professor.\
Had that savant been present with his experimental snake in his pocket,\
he would have resuscitated the ten-thousand-year-old mammoth by\
hydrothermal influence.\
No wonder then we missed this gentleman at the Bath meetings; wc\
looked through all the sections, but found him not. He has reanimated\
a snake after keeping it in a frozen state for eleven years; but as for\
the resuscitation of the ten-thousand-year-old 'mammoth, he wishes to\
be allowed to carry out his experiment in corpore viti on the persons of\
public malefactors. A most laudable design, who shall deny it[P The\
proposal is novel, economical and humane: it is especially worth the\
consideration of the British Government in these days when secondary\
punishments arc our great difficulty, and there is a great objection to\
hanging. What are we to do with our criminals? says everybody.\
Australia won't take them, the gaols are full, and tickets-of-leave are\
so many garotte licences. Freeze them up, of course! It will save\
gaols and gaolers, meat, light, clothing, and heaven knows what,\
amounting to a million sterling per annum. It will save the Home\
Office an immensity of trouble, and perhaps alter the last office of the\
law. What say you, Sir George? Shall we box .them up in an ice-\
house like Scotch salmon P and after the expiring of the sentence, say\
often years' freezing, they might be subjected to the " hydrothermal"\
treatment of a hot hath, and brought to their senses.\
But scientific truths admit no limitation of their principles; once get\
hold of one, and there is no saying where it may carry you. So let us\
see how far " the grand ice and snow development" may be carried.\
There are great men who are before their age. Why not freeze them\
up too, and keep them like King Arthur, in the Isle of Avillon, till\
another generation comes abreast of them? Then subject them gently\
to the hydrothermal influence." It is not to be supposed that time\
would count against them in their allotted years with the whole clock-\
work of the animal economy at a dead stop. Why should we not take\
Mr. Gladstone, and freeze him up till another generation be fit for\
democratic reform and philosophical finance? Shall we lay Mr. Dis-\
raeli out in icy state in some natural Valhalla, to sleep in frost and\
snow till the Asian Mystery approach a solution? It would relieve the\
Opposition of a difficulty, and the Ministry of the too frequent use of the\
Member for Bucks' "hydrothermal" fomentations. Mr. Bright might\
be stored away till the beginning of the century, and rise with great\
eclat with his Reform Bill in his hand, in time for the first Birmingham\
election in the year of Grace two thousand.\
The hydrothermal Mb. Roebuck, what should we do with him?\
Freeze him up ten months out of any twelve, and keep him from all\
Cutlers' Feasts hereafter, to keep him from cutting himself. There is\
the French Emperor: just now lie has got everything quiet, might he\
not dedicate himself to the future of France, ana allow himself to be\
j frozen up till a time of emergency and danger? His loving subjects\
would no doubt keep his Majesty with great care in an imperial ice-box\
till bis counsel was wanted, like the mystic books of the wizard,\
Michael Scott, in his tomb m the Abbey of our Lady of Lannercost.\
As vanity is tojits owner the mother of imaginary greatness, King\
William, of Prussia, might be persuaded to submit to the postpone-\
! ment of his residuary years under the freezing system; no doubtlit would\
i be sine die: he might be accordingly ticketed to be "left till called\
| for," and if ever he were again, it would probably be to brush the boots\
of a French master. As for his generals, Von Wrasgel and Prince\
j Charles Frederick, as they are useless in peace, and in war could\
only achieve tinfoil laurels under Austrian protection, let them be\
frozen up like Dr. Grusselback's viper against the day of dirty work,\
when a small foe and an ignoble cause demand such heroes.\
THE MUSICAL FARMER.\
In his Speech at Aylesbury, Mr. Disraeli said,\
"The Farmer may, in one respect, be compared to a Public Singer."\
Well, yes, there is no denying that the Farmer does " sing out" when-\
ever lie can get a chance. But there is another reason why the Farmer\
is like a Public Singer. He should do his best with his\
while the sun shines.\
Narrow-Minded Old Thing!\
"And what's to be the end of this wicked wasteful American war?"\
asked Mrs. Grundy. "The Union, grandma," said Isaac. "That\
I believe, my dear," said his grandmother; "but when I was young,\
they called it the Workhouse. But it's the same thing, my dear, the\
same thing." Mrs. Grundy is an unenlightened old woman, and ought\
to be ashamed of herself.\

OUR DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT.\
Dear Pxjnch,\
Everybody knows that there is nobody now in London,\
excepting some two millions of scribblers, shopkeepers and such folk,\
who, of course, are nobody. So the man who is obliged to pass a night\
in Town on his journey from the moors to the turnip-fields and stubbles,\
may find it difficult to know where and how to spend the evening.\
After a solitary dinner a la Ortuoe at his Club, where he will hardly see\
a living thing except blackbeetles, he will in despair be forced to look\
into the newspaper, to see what there is to see that he has not seen at\
the theatres.\
Beginning alphabetically, A stands for the Ad el pi i i .so call a hansom cab\
and go to the Adelphi, and see Toole in Stephen Digges. Many people\
fancy that when an actor takes to playing in broad farce, he quite unfits\
himself for any other kind of piece. But Mr. Toole can act well with-\
out trying to be funny, and has something in him beyond the mere\
capacity to raise a vacant laugh.\
But supposing that our friend has been to the Adelphi, and has thus\
exhausted A in his dramatic alphabet, he may wish to know how doth\
the busy B improve an after-dinner hour for the benefit of playgoers. The\
Britannia is the only playhouse that begins with B, and this stands so\
remote in the far East that to travel there from Clubland were a journey\
not unlike that of the author of Eulhen. However, Swells occasionally\
do the strangest things when there is nobody to see them, and so a tour\
to the Britannia may be suggested as a way of killing time for a few\
hours, in the interval occurring between grouse and partridge slaughter.\
The plays most popular at this house are chiefly of the blood-and-brim-\
stone, mystery-and-murder sort, with very commonly a ghost in them,\
or, as the bills prefer to call it, in big type, an AWFUL APPARI-\
TION I! t To the traveller from Clubland the audience will, however,\
afford as strange a sight as any on the stage. It is really worth the\
i journey to see that mass of faces all intent upon 1 he play, and staring\
I their sixpenny worth with all their main and might. There are some\
three thousand people nightly crammed in that great "minor" theatre,\
and, excepting when the comic man inclines their throats to laughter,\
or when a baby wakes and squalls and is clamoured into silence, scarce\
a foot is heard to shuffle or a tongue to speak. How many babies\
there are nightly to be seen at the Britannia I am afraid to guess, and\
how many drops of poison\'97that is, gin or other " soothing syrup"\'97\
are given to keep them quiet. I dread still more to conceive. But the\
babies survive somehow, at least many of them do: though if a law\
were made to prohibit the admission of babies to a theatre, or music\
hall, or concert-room, or any other stifling place where grown-up people\
closely congregate, I think the Registrar would soon report the death-\
rate had decreased.\
To quote, not quite correctly, an old song I remember :\'97\
** C stands for Covcnt Garden, of the drama now bereft,\
D for Drury Lane, where our Bhakspjuhe still is left"\
At the first of these two theatres the solitary Swell who is on his way\
to Stubbleshire may go to one of Mr. Alfred Mellon's cheap but\
charming Concerts, where, besides some pleasant dance-tunes which, if\
he be young enough, will set his toes a-tingling, he will hear some real\
music by Beethoven or Mendelssohn, performed to a good audience\
by a famously good band. Moreover, he will hear Carlotta Patti,\
who sings so high at times that you expect her, like a skylark, to sing\
clean out of sight; and he will hear the wondrous Turkophone played\
by Ali Ben Soualle so early in the evening that by ten o'clock or so\
he may criticise its merits in company with a cigar and with his old\
friend Paddy Green. N.B. Friends at a distance had better accept\
the intimation that Mr. Mellon's Concerts will only last a few more\
nights, for the English Opera Company (Limited) will soon take pos-\
session of the theatre, and Mr. Mellon will descend from the throne\
which he now occupies to his old Conductor's chair. \'bb\

I shall have a great respect for it) Shaksfeare migrated last Season to\

will be continued. Mr. Phelps next Saturday will re-appear as plump\
Jack Falstaff, and that day week his plumpness will dwindle into lean\
and slippered Justice Shallow. On the Saturday that follows, Mr.\
Phelps will black his face, and for a week perform Othello; and then,\
after one week's rest (wherein the shade of Shakspkare, if he revisit\
this dull earth,'may see his charming Imogen once more upon the stage)\
the Swells who are ia Town may improve their minds by going some fine\
evening to Macbeth, which is to be revived "on a scale of great com-\
pleteness," with real broomsticks for the witches, and real eye of\
newt and toe of frog," and other savoury imgredients for the hell-broth\
that they brew. Mr. Creswick the careful, is associated with him,\
so you see here is a feast of Shakspeare in prospect, and 1 hope it\
will pay better than the Shakspeare feast at Stratford which was\
held last Spring.\
I have only reached the letter D in my dramatic alphabet, yet you\
see here are four theatres where any solitary Swell who is in Town at\
this dull season may go if he so please. How many other nights'\
amusement the other two-and-twenty letters may afford him, 1 will,\

\
Splendid specimen of\
the British Snob\
(Sn. alrox) exhibited\

to get admission into\
the room where\
Mcller was de-\
tained, by walking\
in the rear of two\
of the detective officers. Going up to MuiiER^he shook hands with\
Mm, saving, "And you are Franz Mcller. Well, I am glad to see\
you and shake hands with you. Do you think you will be able to\
prove your innocence P" In answer to the Snob, Muller replied,\
I do." The Snob then, speaking "in a loud tone of voice," said,\
"Youlaiow, Muller, this is a very serious charge." To this asinine\
observation, Miiller made no reply, but Detective Patrick, who of\
course had heard it, immediately rebuked the Snob, telling him that\
"his own good sense ought to hare prevented him addressing the\
prisoner at all," and thereupon desired him to leave the room, which\
the Snob would not do till the request had been repeated.\
Detective Patrick may be apt at apprehending fugitives, but he had\
no apprehension of the nature of the Snob to whom he was talking.\
Such a Snob has no good sense, nor any sense or feeling at all beyond\
a sense of self-importance, and a feeling of desire to participate in the\
notoriety, no matter what, of anybody notorious.\
It is the nature and property of this sort of Snob to obtrude himself\
on any man whose name for good or evil is before the public, if he can\
anyhow get at him, and to endeavour to obtain some sort of notice from\
him, contemptuous rather than none. It signifies little to the Snob\
who or what the public man is, so lone as the man is public; he regards\
a public man as he does a public building; and takes a liberty with the\
former as he cuts out his name on the latter. If Garibaldi had been\
at Liverpool he would have forced himself into Garibaldi's presence,\
and tried to shake hands with him; but doubtless he is somewhat\
gladder to have shaken Miller's hand than he would be to have\
grasped that of Garibaldi. If Muller had kicked him instead of\
shaking hands with him, he would have been better pleased than he\
would if he had not been touched by Muller at all. He would have\
wished Muller, rather than not paying any attention to him, to say,\
"Take that man away." There is no physical substance more offensive\
to the olfactory nerves than this sort of Snob is to the interior nostrils.\
His moral odour is such that he is quite unbearable, and it is dreadful\
to be in the same room with him.\

CLEKGYMEN IN BORROWED ROBES.\
The blessed Father or Brother Ignatius, and his troop of mimic\
monks, running about the country with shaven heads, and wearing\
frocks, cowls, and sandals, are mistaken by many people for real mem-\
bers of a monastic order. The law, however, forbids genuine friars to\
sport their conventual habits in public. It protects the Roman Catholic\
clergy, both regular and secular, from Protestant little boys, who in\
some districts would be their followers and not their disciples. It does\
not, however, prohibit the procession of Guy Fawkes, nor forbid a\
buffoon or a mountebank to masquerade in Popish vestments. Did it\
ever contemplate the possibility that the friends of an Anglican clergy-\
man would suffer him to go about in the trim affected by Ignatius and\
his companions?\
Ignatius and one of his company, according to the Leeds Mercury,\
appeared, last Saturday, at York, attired in character. They went to\
the New Roman Catholic Church of St. Wilfrid. There they knelt\
before the altar, as though really saying their prayers: then they\
pressed their lips to the floor. It was as much like the real thing as an\
artificial fly appears to a trout. As such it was taken; for :\'97\
"A number of Catholics were in tho church, and mistaking them for high func-\
tionaries of their own faith, bent thoir knees before them for their blessing. This\
the 'Father* and his brother bestowed in Latin. Afterwards it was discovered who\
they were, and then their proceedings assumed the character of a good joke."\
Father [Ignatius and his associate might, in some districts, have\
found that they had carried a joke too far. Their joke, or what would\
have been taken for a joke, would have been resented as profane tom-\
foolery. The ecclesiastical jackdaws would have been stripped of their\
feathers, and have suffered worse than anything that excommunication\
inflicted on the famous jackdaw of Rheims. The forbearance of the\
York Roman Catholics is laudable. Some others, not content with\
stripping these pretenders to monasticism, might have proceeded to\
teach them what it really is, by subjecting their hides to the discipline\
of the rope's end. That discipline would once have been prescribed as\
salutary for any unfortunate person imagining himself to be somebody\
else. If the reverend gentleman who has taken the name of Ignatius\
is not merely making a fool of himself, and really believes that he is a\
monk, is he much other than what he would be if he thought himself\
the Pope?\
ALL IN A BROTHERLY WAY.\
The following extract is borrowed from the Newcastle Chronicle, and\
may be looked upon as a characteristic incident of a very stormy\
meeting (need we say it was a religious one ?) that took place in the\
Lecture Hall of that town:\'97\
"A voice from an individual in the front of the platform: How can you explain\
to me that it would be a blessing for me to become a Monk? (Great la wider.)\
"Brother Iohattus \{with tmtideraUt warmth, and lacking fiercely at the/elin). It\
could not be a blessing. Sir."\
We advise our bare-footed Monk to change his" name, instantly from\
Brother Ignatius to Brother Lndignatius.\
The Ethnology of Capitular Barbarism.\
It is a question for ethnologists on what tribe of barbarians to affiliate\
those dignitaries of whose ill-doings in chipping off the surfaces of our\
Cathedrals we have lately heard so much. Those who flayed St. Bar-\
tholomew alive are supposed to have been Armenians, and the Saturday\
declares it an unjust reviling of Genseric to father these modern flayers\
upon the Vandals. Sir Charles Ltbll might connect them with his\
pre-historic skinners of flints, but it is our own conviction that they\
belong to the Chip-away tribe.\

We are aware that fictitious names are used by sporting men, but we\

_ MATRIMONY.\
Steady, respectable, invalided Young Gentleman,\

yearn of age, whose physician advises bim to marry, be having a little incomo,\
but not sufficient to keep himself and a wife too in the style be is now living, is\
desirous of meeting with a Lady with a little further income, who be may make his\
wife. Bhe must be of a kind and cheerful disposition. Age and beauty no object\
Apply, stating age and particulars, L.B.D., Post Office, Ipswich.\
Many questions arise to the mind of a cynical and cold-hearted reader\
of the above, but it offers such attractions to young ladies who wish to\
be married (which means, we hope, all young ladies who are single)\
that answers must have poured in by scores, and criticism is useless.\
Yet why does the interesting invalid describe himself "as between 24\
and 32." This is very precise, and yet there is no precision. Doesn't\
he know how old he is 'f Why does he say that the age of the lady is\
no object, and in the next sentence desire her to state it P Did his\
doctor desire him to write the atrocious English about " the style he is\
now living," and is the medical man guilty of the passage " who he may\
make his wife?" And was it the doctor's impudence or the patient's\
that prompted an invitation to a "kind and cheerful" girl to link\
herself for life to a selfish ignorant fellow who wants an unpaid nurse\
with money. Mr. Punch laughs at many oddities of advert isement, but\
there be some which excite his wrath. This would be one, but that he\
feels that justice will be done on a patient in the bands of the sort of\
doctor who could "advise" thi* attempt against woman.\
Ecclesiastical.\
De. Mashing, Roman Catholic Provost of Westminster, lately\
preached, we hear, a most touching sermon. Most of his male auditors\
were in tears. It was remarked at the time, that this was not like\
Dr. Manning's usual style; that it was, in fact, Un-manning."\

A PLACE FOR A PERFECT CURE.\
Most of the London Hospitals are named after Saints. There are\
St. Bartholomew's, St. Thomas's, St. George's\'97not to mention St.\
Luke's. To these may be added All Saints', which, though situated it\
Eastbourne, is connected with Margaret Street.\
Hospitals are institutions peculiarly Christian. To be sure, they\
were invented before the Reformation.' But Hospitals are not among\
the errors of Popery. Neither is All Saints' an error of Popery without\
the Pope. There is no mistake, Popish or Protestant, about Hospitals.\
The speciality of this All Saints' Hospital is, that it is a Convalescent\
Hospital. For such an institution many a London Hospital Surgeon\
has cried and wrung his hands. It is, in many of the most "interesting\
cases," the one thing needful to effect\'97banish the idea of any allusion\
to an odious idiotic comic song\'97a Perfect Cure.\
There can be no doubt that money contributed to Hospitals will be\
found a good investment after railway debentures, and the Three per\
cent Consols, and even freehold property with a registered title, will\
have ceased to be securities. Anybody, therefore, who has money to\
spare, should, instead of fooling it away in the funds, or on land, bestow\
it on Hospitals, and such like charitable institutions, and would do well\
to send a good lot of it to All Saints' Hospital.\
New Idea in Ethnology. ,\
Accoedino to a distinguished explorer of Africa, the Makololos\
justify cattle-stealing by the argument that those who cannot keep then-\
cattle have no right to have them. This is exactly Rob Rot's logic,\
and suggests an affinity between the Makololos and M'Gregors. What\
is the orthography of the former clan's name P Should it not be spelt\
M'CulloloP That would be very like M'Culloch. Radically they\
must be the same names. The supposition of an original connection\
between the Land of Cakes and the Land of Negroes is corroborated\
by the fact that Scotland, as well as Africa, abounds in Blackies. ,\

THE BANTING RESTAURANT JOINT STOCK COMPANY\
(LIMITED).\
An Association under the foregoing title has been formed for the\
purpose of enabling persons endowed with a hearty appetite, to gratify\
it without incurring the penalty of corpulence, too generally consequent\
on its indulgence.\
The undertaking contemplated by this Society is that of establishing\
Dining Halls and Refreshment Rooms, at which the bill of fare shall be\
framed on the dietetic principles recommended by Mr. Banting.\
The Banting Restaurant Company will devote its earnest attention\
to the preparation of viands which, whilst excluding, as much as pos-\
sible, saccharine, farinaceous, and oleaginous matters, shall nevertheless\
administer, in the highest degree compatible with the absence of those\
savoury substances, to the pleasures of the palate.\
Leading Professors of Chemistry and Gastronomy have been engaged\
to unite their efforts in the invention of Dishes which shall answer the\
purpose which the Company has in view. By the aid of these scientific\
gentlemen, the Directors of the Banting Restaurant Company con-\
fidently trust to enable the gourmand to combine enjoyment with\
gracility, and whilst, as the popular phrase is, playing a good stick, to\
preserve a good figure.\
They have not the slightest doubt that the profits of the Company\
will exceed cent, per cent.\
The Capital of the Banting Restaurant Company consists of\
\'a310.000,000, in Shares of One Shilling each, of which half the amount\
has been paid up, and the remainder may be sent .to 85, Fleet Street.\

Of course you take\

It has been re-\

have been complain-\
ing, ladies, of the\
scarcity of good Servants. The complaint is getting chronic, General Punch is\
afraid, and it is not easy to discover what will stop it. Girls object to\
now-a-days, you say, and they who should be dairymaids lie\
\
be dressmakers. So when your housemaid Mart left you this last\
(and why the silly thing should want so to marry that bald baker's man you really can't\
imagine), you found it a hard matter to find a fit successor. What with hunting\
up advertisements, and calling upon Agents, and seeing candidates who called on\
you in crinoline and cabs, and writing for their characters, and paying their\
;naes, you know you never were so worried and tormented in your life; and,\
that you persuaded Charles to take you down to Brighton, there really is no\
telling how your health might have been broken. Well then, ladies, would you not\
be thankful to know where a good Servant was always to be had, or, if not, a good\
girl whom, being previously well trained, you could soon make a good Servant P\
Give your thanks to General Punch, then, and order\

QUIET WATERING-PLACES.\
No. II.\'97GWRYSTBLOGWDD (Continued).\
[Parenthetical Note.\'97Since the publication of my first paper on\
Gwrysthlogwdd, I have received some fifty or sixty communications, by\
letter, by telegram, by prospectuses, by local newspapers, in which\
strongly-marked lines were described about certain paragraphs intended\
for my special notice, and through the various other media afforded\
us by the enterprising activity of this progressive age, informing me\
concerning the existence of small retired watering-places of that very\
character, which it is the highest aim and object of the Limited Com-\
pany, whose representative lam, to preserve. Should, however, these\
places become generally known, our great and good object will be\
defeated. Suppose Gwrysthlogwdd to be the spot required (which, as\
I have already demonstrated, it certainly is not), then if Mr. and Mrs.\
Mundus (under this name you observe I playfully, yet with some-\
what of a classic dignity, express the World and his Wife), then, I say,\
if Mr. and Mrs. Mundus come down "to be quiet" at Gwrysthlo-\
gwdd, how long will the quiet of Gwrysthlogwdd remain? No; let\
me receive private information, by all means, about such places, but none\
of your flaming advertisements, sent hither and thither through the\
length and breadth of the land. Our Company will quietly buy up any\
promising village or small towji of the required description. We shall\
establish a quiet hotel, where the servants, chambermaids included,\
shall be dressed in quiet colours; the bar shall be provided with quiet\
cigars; quiet pipes sliall induce postprandial snoozes. The hired horses\
shall be quiet to ride or drive." The only approach to anything like\
a manufactory in the place shall be a Still; and if the village possess\
but an unpronounceable name, so that to answer the question, "Where\
are you going to stay?" or, Where have you been stopping?" or,\
"To what place does such and such a road lean ?" will be a verbal impos-\
sibility, then we shall have arrived at something not very many degrees\
removed from perfection. I have offered the above remarks in the\
most charitable and friendly spirit, for it is a grief and a pain to me to\
see such a chance thrown away by publicity, as occurs in the following\
advertisement, kindly forwarded to me by a most estimable lady, whose\
name I have thoughtfully erased:\'97\

With four entertaining rooms, one person alone need never be at a\

in water-colours. Then the name! Any attempt at pronouncing it\
would throw the bold divulger of our secret into strong convulsions.\
There are, I believe, masonic words which may not be breathed ate in\

The moon is shining in through the chinks of the shutter. Another\
of the party has begun to snore, in a different style too, and alternating\
with Scissobs. Is there anything more annoying, more irritating, than\
snoring P Snuffing and smoking may be selfish habits; but oh, the\
selfishness of snoring! The rat in the wainscot has been joined by\
other rats, and the walls are alive. 1 shut my eyes, and try to, as it\
were, play at being asleep. The effort makes me more wakeful than\
ever.\
I even try, by way of furthering the illusion, a sort of amateur snore,\
but give up the attempt as entailing physical suffering, and a proba-\
bility of waking my companions. Was that a blackbeetle on the floor?\
I have heard dreadful stories about blackbeetles. There is no crime I\
believe that a blackbeetle will not commit. Supposine that, one should\

hand to lay hold of my boots, lest a blackbeetle should crawl on to\
my fingers. I will leave it to chance.\
The church clock strikes something or other, I'am'unable to say\

nie feel very uncomfortable. He's walking in his sleep!!! I'm in a\
cold shiver. At this moment recurs to me a horrible story about some\
traveller who was stopping at a monastery and forgot to lock the door\
of the cell in which lie was placed for the night. I recollect that a\
sleeping monk walked into this cell with a knife, and ugh!\
What is that he has in his hand? Oh! only a watch-key: he can't do\
much harm with that. He is winding up his watch. He sighs heavily.\
He must be very cold about the legs. I wonder the others have not\
been awakened by Ihe moonlight. Yes! they have been disturbed, and\
are now moving. Scissobs is the first. I try to attract his attention\
to the condition of his friend. He understands me: at least he gets\
out of bed and walks across the room. Heavens! He doesn't under-\
stand me. He approaches the window. Good gracious! is it possible?\
He too is walking in his sleep. What are nails m a bed to this? I have\
seen the nuns in Roberto at the opera, and the statue in Don Giovanni.\
1 remind myself that I am no believer iu ghos's. It won't do. I think\
of Amina, and try to whistle an air from the Sonnambula. My lips are\
parched, and I feel as if I was going to be very ill. I whisper across,\
fearfully, to the Gorilla. Perhaps he knows how to deal with his\
friends in this state, and will kindly awaken them. The Gorilla rises.\
1 beg him, over the edge of my blankets, to be cautious. He heeds me\
not. Ha! ha! The horrid truth breaks in upon me, stronger than the\
pale moonlight! They are all walking in their tleep! What on earth\
shall I do now?\
"COLD CUEATE."\
Extracts from elegant Epistle of young Lady in the Country, to her\
friend in Town:\'97\
\'95,. \'95 * The Parsonage Shepherd's Vale.\
Papa is so much in want of a little Cold Curate you can't\
think, dear. Till last winter we always had a cheap and abundant\
supply, but now, for some reason or other, we can only get it by paying\
a very high price\'97at all events, more than Papa thinks we ought to\
pay \'95 *_ * Papa is a little near in trifles, not that he denies me\
anything, in proof of which, he has just bought me such a sweet pair\
of bay ponies with silver bells, which tinkle as I drive. * * but\
he don't like spending much on his cloth. * \'bb * The Curate is a\
shy bird, and the scarcity is by some supposed to be owing to the hard-\
ness of the ground, and to game-keepers of Manors keeping such sharp\
watch over their Lordship's preserves, so that little birds have no\
chance of picking sp much there * * * Our neighbours, the\
Misses Lovelawn, are exceedingly fond of Curate, but prefer it warm\
* * it is so nice at tea * * and is such a relish to the muffins\
* * \'95 the tongue is in general very tender, and is considered a great\
delicacy * \'bb \'95 Curates are not like turtle cutlets, and you seldom\
hear people complain of their being too rich * * * with respect to\
its haoits, it naturally endeavours to secure a nice roosting-place in the\
church, to which it is much attached, but rarely succeeds in feathering\
its nest \'95 * \'95 You can hardly wonder therefore at its looking with\
hungry eye at the black bird's comfortable couch over its head, and\
envying the downy one. * * * Though I don't care much for\
Curate myself (it's too dry for my taste), I think something should be\
done to improve its condition, and make it more plump and partridge-\
like * * Lord Palmerston, I have heard Horace say, is a keen\
sportsman, couldn't he direct hts people to throw a few bread-crumbs\

they would like to, but dare not hop the twig. * * * The old\
rooks, of course, would show caws against it, but P. would be com-\
mended by all who have any feeling for fledglings. * * * The\
Curate, we all know, has a soft bill, and a long one sometimes to pro-\
vide for. When you look at his innocent little beak wide open, you\
may fancy him saying, "Pray don't make game of me\'97I cannot dig,\
and unless a smart shower brings out the gruhs, I shall find it very\
hard to get a living" * * * Remember me kindly to Horace, and\

incessantly besieged with\
applications for employ-\

are for the most part fool-\

creature himself walks\
about the world in a coat\
of darkness and with a gold\
pen of swiftness, and when\

When they turn out muffs,\

and continues to instruct\

usually preserves and files\
such petitions, for reference and amusement in the after-days, and in\
some slack time he may entertain society with some sketches of its would-\

than usual, and one which comes 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  from a further region than even\
Bohemia, in fact from India, he is inclined to publish the document, for\
the sake of its originality and of its poetry. He suppresses the name ol\
the writer, but assures him of Mr. Punch's distinguished consideration.\
How better to serve his correspondent than by printing his letter, Mr\
Punch knows not, but would add that the eminent Indian must be\
satisfied with this glory, and need not forwardfcny of the " disertashins"\

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
FROM OUR ILL-USEO CONTRIBUTOR.\
Mi dear Mr. Puvch, St. Hilda's, by ike Sea.\
Tee above is not the name of the place where I am, at least\
not the name given in the maps of the present day. although I dare say\
that in the chart carried by the vessel which took the nuns, in Marmion,\
on that delightful voyage (when the young ladies told competition\
stories about their Saints), this spot was called S. JM5a, Uirgn. The\
reasons why I abstain from giving the modern name are two-fold; first,\
I do not wish you to know where I am, as you would bother me for\
manuscript; and. secondly, I like the place so much that I do not want\
to bring it into publicity, and cram it with Cockneys. I assure the\
latter that it will not suit them. There are no ridiculous amusements,\
and nobody makes three toilettes a day. and struts about to flirt, and\
show fine clothes. And, moreover^ the battling' is perfectly decorous.\
I am about 250 miles from the Temple, in lit. 54. 29. 24, and 36. 39.\
W. It. I ascertained this myself with the aid of a sexton and a\
quadroon, at high water, when the sun's attitude was couchant, and the\
globe was highly rectified with spirits, which were also highly rectified,\
for I verified the calculation by drinking them, without sugar, as recom-\
mended by Mb. Mechl\
We do not do anything here, except eat and drink, and drive up and\
down the most awful hills into the roost delightful scenery. Eating and\
drinking are very good, and I am shocked to discover what awful cheats\
the London fishmongers and poulterers are. I get for sixpence fishes\
for which my metropolitan fish-seller would charge me two shillings;\
and as for grouse and partridges, the price I pay here makes me shud-\
der to think of the wickedness of Town. I cannot get good cigars here\
at any price; but the same remark applies to the Metropolis; for though\
I admit that there are one or two places in London where you can, by\
favour, obtain a tolerable weed for tenpence, I consider that a price\
which no married man ought topay in the present condition of Vene-\
zuela Bonds and Great Wheal Virgins. Beer excellent, and scarcely\
any foot to the honest bottles. Furthermore, my experience of the\
landladies is exactly opposed to my reminiscences of divers insolent,\
greedy, cheating harpies under whose clutches I have come during\
various sea-side sojourns. The houses are clean, the lodging-letters\
smiling and civiL your dishes and liquors are left intact, and you are\
charged for nothing but what you have had, and for that in strict\
moderation. Therefore I am exceedingly desirous to keep off the\
Cockneys, who are unworthy of such treatment, and whose objection-\
able ways would soon spoil our Eden.\
We have some drawbacks, however. There is a harbour, which is\
picturesque at high water, and it is a pleasing sight to sit at the end of\
the pier and! see an armada of fishing boats go forth to fetch me my\
whitings. But at low water, this harbour, into which St. Hilda's is, I\
suppose, drained, is about ten times more abominable in the eyes of my\
nose than was our own beloved Thamesis during that awful summer when\
we Templars had to sit with closed windows, and the glass at 90\'b0, and\
when, you may recollect, you were taking drains all day long, at inter-\
vals of seven minutes or less. I declare that it is worse than Marseilles.\
On the rock whose haughty brow frowns o'er old ocean's foaming flood,\
call it? However, we are 'bound to be missionaries wherever we go*\
and I have hinted to the authorities here that there is such a thing as a\
Dog-tax, and that Ma. Gladstone would be very much pleased with\
them, and would probably come and stay here for a season, if they\
would take up all stray dogs, and examine any claimants as to the\
existence of a certain document called a Dog-tax receipt. There are\
excellent tan-yards here, also, and dog-skin makes very good gloves. I\
trust that there will be a reform in this particular before I come again,\
as I fully intend to do.\
In other respects I heartily approve of St. Hilda's. There is a ehnrch\
(horribly churchwardened with galleries) on the highest of hills, and\
you can ascend it by one of those awful roads which frighten you in\
nightmares. Or you may climb up exactly as many stairs as there are\
feet in the Monument, London. Or you may go by a wide, but easy\
circumbendibus. You will be amply rewarded, not only inside the\
church (which is served excellently), but by the sight of some glorious\
old ruins, and by the perusal of the following epitaph. I alter all the\
and where the aristocratic part of St. Hilda's is situate, (you do not\
perceive this atrocious aroma; but descend into St. Hilda's com\
or linger on the quay to study\
you will temporarily a|\
commercial,\
amphibious fellow-creatures, and\
agree with some old philosopher that the sense of\
smell was given us as a punishment. This heresy you will repudiate on\
climbing the heights again, and scenting the glorious ocean, which rolls\
in straight from the North Pole; to which latter fact I attribute a\
wooden kind of flavour which I sometimes detect in the air.\
Another drawback is to be found in the Noises. Now I am not one\
of your fastidious people who cannot bear to hear a child cry\'97on the\
contrary, I rather like it, because the row probably shows that somebody\
is educating the child, after the fashion recommended by the wisest and\
most moral of men, Solomon L If the child howls because it has\
fallen'down, I am also glad, because it cannot be seriously hurt if it can\
bellow, and slight pain will teach it carefulness, and save it from future\
damage. But the howling of the brats at St. Hilda's is something\
preposterous. They bellow on no need or provocation whatever. It\
seems suddenly to occur to them in the street that it would be a neat\
thing to begin to yell, and they carry'out the idea with splendid energy.\
If you see three together, two are sure to be crying aloud, and the\
chances are that some sturdy mother (moother they call her here)\
comes up and gives the third excellent reason for joiningin the vocal\
trio. I believe that the habit is the relic of some old Pagan super-\
stition, or some old device for frightening away the Danes, who were\
very troublesome to St. Hilda, and burned her out of house and home\
ever so many times. But worse than the children are the canine popu-\
lation, as a penny-a-liner would say. The juveniles go to sleep at night,\
but the dogs never do. And everybody keeps a dog, and there are\
scores of dogs who keep themselves, and when they are not fighting\
they are baying the moon, and when there is no moon they bay the gas.\
I have not slept once for eleven days and nights, I believe, in conse-\
quence of this hideous nuisance, and I must have a remarkably fine\
constitution to be able to endure so long a Virgil, vigil,\'97what do you\
names, but give the inscription as sculptured:\'97\

give out work for the recess. As for our readers, I fear that there is\
the same love of what is amusing, the same dislike for what is instruc-\
tive, that we have observed among our feminine population in London,\
and to which I attribute the comparatively slight success of my own\
admirable Anglo-Saxon novel, and my beautiful Tales qf Ancient Mada-\

made by a score of pretty girls at the library,\'97" Ah/' Ijsaid, in a melan-\

Tell us of some lovely blue-eyed fairy girl, who fell in love (as she sat in\
the train) with a splendid giant colonel, with a red beard, ana melancholy\
eyes, on seeing him knock, with one blow, the very life out of a railway\
porter who accidentally ran against him. Tell us how they met at a\
castle near the crags, and how she learned that he never would marry\
during the life of a beloved grandmother, on whom he doted, and who\
was always with him. How the blue-eyed fairy, hearing that the aged\
lady loved mushrooms, schemed to feed her with toadstools, but a\
wedding-ring that fell from the old finger into the dish, changed colour,\
and betrayed the trick. How, failing by poison, the blue-eyed angei\
went out for a walk with the old woman, and pushed her over a cliff.\
But her spectacles were saved by a pensive fisherman. Blue-eyes\
marries the splendid giant, but he wearies of her, and her love turns to\
hate. The fisherman has her secret\'97he draws much money from her.\
He shall have one secret more. Let him rid her of her hateful giant,\
and name his reward. The splendid giant loves fishing from a boat\'97let\
him have it for the last time. That death-struggle in the boat was\
awful; and but for the ghastly wound received unawares, and but for\
the dying lobster that clutched the hand of the gigantic husband, the\
fisherman had been rent in pieces. But he vanquishes, and what reward\
does he claim F The hand of the blue-eyed fairy! She consent*, with\
that fatal smile of sweetness, and they are wed. But, on the bridal\
eve, what finds she on her pillow? The Old Lady's Spectacles! Ha!\
The dose she had prepared for the ambitious fisher descends her own\
alabaster throat, and the grandmother is avenged. The giant has been\
picked up\'97he is not dead\'97and he forgives the misled fisherman, who\
turns out to be his own foster-brother, and they enter a monastery, and\
live a pious and penitential life as Brother Goliath and Brother Pis-\

Romola, justly remarking that it requires one to know Florence from\

\
A REAL AMERICAN POEM.\
It has been remarked by people who have nothing to do but to m ate\
remarks (a kind of people we hate), that the American War has pro-\
duced no poet. Usually, when a nation is stirred to its heart, the\
feelings of that heart find vent in song. But with nothing save the\
most blatant doggerel have the American writers as yet celebrated any\
of the brave deeds which both sides have performed in the Three Years,\
that is. Ninety Days, War.\
We have, happily, an exception to make to the general rule. A Poet\
has arisen in the North. He is worthy to sing its praises. His latest\
outburst has just reached us, and with the purest desire to do justice\
to a great and gushing being, we reproduce his work for a world's\
admiration. It matters nothing to Punch that the Poem is an attack\
upon England. We can venerate genius, no matter whether it sings\
our eulogy or our condemnation. We call on the world to read ana\
admire the Poem we are going to reprint. The name of the author\'97\
we admit that the name is not euphonious, but is Tupper exactly music,\
or is Close harmonv ?\'97the name is Bungay\'97 George W ii a km i ng pajoi\
Bungay, of New York. He is, we believe, one of the editors of the\
Tribune (Mr. Horace Greeley's paper), and is a person without\
what is vulgarly called education, as appears from an autograph before\
us in which he spells August "Agust," and "certainly" as he would\
pronounce it, "ceartainly." He is also, we understand, the editor of a\
New York "religious paper," called the Independent. It is to the\
honour of our American brethren that they 6et little value on a man's\
position or worldly learning, and respectfully submit to his teaching,\
provided the stuff is in him. And that the stuff is in Bungay, let this\
noble war-song testify. It is in honour of the Kearsarge, a Federal\
frigate, which it may, even at this distance of time, be remembered,\

LARGE AND SMALL* GERMANS.\
Some question has been raised whether the German Society was\
quite right in coming forward to provide Muller with legal assistance.\
Of course it was. The German Society represents the great German\
nation. Every merely accused person is presumed to be innocent. The\
fallaciousness of circumstantial evidence has often been proved. How\
is the German Society to know that Mi'ller is not as guiltless as the\
unborn babe? But even suppose they believed him to have killed, not\
to say murdered, Mr. Briggs. What then? Mr. Briggs was only\
an Englishman. How much is an Englishman better than a Dane?\
What is one Englishman to thousands of Danes? Is there any essential\
difference between Mr. Briggs's watch and chain and the duchies of\
Schleswig and Holstein P Is there any difference at all between delibe-\
rately and wilfully causing the massacres of Dybbol and Sonderborg to\
obtain possession of those duchies, and deliberately and wilfully slaying\
Mr. Briggs for the sake of his watch and chain, except the difference\
between thousands of Danes and that one Englishman? It is as yet\
doubtful who slew poor Mb. Briggs, but nobody doubts who slew the\
poor Danes. Loyalty demands that the Germans should defend the\
King of Prussia from the same accusation as that alleged against\
Muller. Their loyalty would be justly regarded as llunkej ism, if they\
had refused to perform the same service for their poor countryman,\
Muller, as that which they render their precious King.\

Sung, and of Campbell's Nelson and the North so nobly emulated in\

THE CONDITION OF THE ARMY MEDICAL OFFICER.\
That learned body, the College of Physicians, has appointed, so we\
learn, a committee to "inquire into the condition of the army medical\
officers." We are delighted to hear it, and wish the committee a happy\
deliverance in due time: hut it occurs to us that the inquiry is some-\
what extensive, and not particularly well defined. It is, however, clear\
that the investigation has one limit; it cannot be into the conditions of\
the army medical service (the which we regret, for it needs looking into),\
since the Fellows would have said so had they meant it. We infer that\
as the College is medical, the committee medical, and the conditions\
which they understand medical, this must be a Medical Board inquiry\
into the conditions of the bodies of their brethren, which are at times\
exposed to danger, and into the conditions of their minds under the\
wrongs which they suffer; and we hope it will aid in improving the\
conditions of their purses.\

The Pofe is said to be thinking of making Monsignore Manning a\

PERILS OF HIPPOPHAGY.\
\
ertatn Correspondence Las\
been sent us in a mysterious\
way for publication, and from\
which we select the following.\
Omitting some personal com-\
pliments to our dog Toby, for\
which he returns his best bow-\
wow, we present these curious\
emanations of feline genius to\
such epicures as have a taste\
for the subject to which they\
refer, [and capacity to digest\
it:\'97\
Ma. Grimalkin to\
Miss Tabitha.\
Mt dear Tabbt,\
1 suppose yon read the\
French papers P They are\
somewhat deficient perhaps in\
freedom of tone, but the feuille-\
tons so much admired by your\
sex are exceedingly well done,\
Government, I believe, giving\
every encouragement to that\
branch of journalism.\
Well then, it appears by\
those amusing ephemera that\
has bees started, whose avowed object is to infringe upon our vested rights.\
How, say you T Why, by taking that noble animal the Horse from the purveyor's barrow,\
and attaching it to the gourmand's carte. Not satisfied with the heterogeneous diet\
(including frog a la mode) to which he has been accustomed for ages, Monsieur ie cuisine\
now is sharpening his pliant knife over steed steaks, and making sauce piquante for colt chops\
or fillet of filly.\
The fashion of course will travel with steam speed to this country, and we may anticipate\
that the piece de resistance will be haunch of hunter, at the next gorgeous banquet of the\
Mayor.\
Nor will it be long ere Parliament is required to repeal its antiquated Bills of Fare. The\
Speaker's dinner will soon be tainted with Hippophagy. Then who can tell what effect\
upon a liberal party may be produced by three coursers and a dessert? I fear that B\'97 O\'97\
will be stimulated to horse play; R\'97 will bolt with the bit between his teeth; and C\'97\
attempt astonishing leaps, before eventually subsiding into a ditch.\
But this is not all. Conservatives perhaps will, like Chameleons, take their colour from\
that on which they feed. Picture the jibbing of D\'97t when people want him to trot briskly up\
Constitution Hill. What a crib-biter D\'97i may become if a foreign Secretary is placed in\
his manger. N\'97 of course will rear and lash out wildly if a juvenile Guy Faux crosses the\
road; and as for Bishops, they will certainly shy if they eatch sight of any men at work\
in doing necessary repairs to a Church. 1 tremble to think of the Irish Member\'97he will\
certainly turn out a roarer, and prove a greater annoyance than the wildest goose of the\
Commons.\
Depend on it, my dear Tabby, this new-fangled Hippophagy will complete what factious\
oratory has sometimes nearly accomplished, and Dring legislation to a dead-lock; official reti-\
cence will be greater than ever. A Minister will take advantage .of its demoralising\
influence, and when bored by a volley of questions, will answer with an official curtness,\
that no one can cavil at, though singularly suggestive of a neigh.\
Here I pause, for methinks I smell a rat, Yours, &c,\
Three Colts Lane.\
From Miss Tabitha to Mb.\
My sear Grim,\
You look at Hippophagy chiefly from a political point of view. It is alarming enough\
certainly under that aspect, out much more so if you go below stairs and see what costly\
dishes the noble animal you refer to will drag after it, when taken from the barrow and\
attached to the carte. You know, dear Gkim, by personal observation, how fastidious our\
modern menials are\'97how scornfully they repudiate any connection with the cold shoulder, and\
turn up their eloquent noses when they have made a hash of it. What delicious morceava\
will they deem themselves entitled to under the new dietary! Mart and Jane will stipu-\
late for those expensive luxuries\'97Pony pudding and Galloway dumplings. Mr. Coachman\
will not be satisfied with anything less than saddle of Charger, ana collared Cob. Jeames\
perhaps will languidly confess that he prefers his Jennet a little high, and Mrs. Housekeeper\
Stilton will of course reserve to herself the Thoroughbreds as included in the culinary\
sweets of office.\
Then what is to become of us P Are we to be put upon veal cutlets and such like insi-\
pidities, until we haven't courage enough left to look a mouse in the face P No, my dear\
Grim, I '11 never submit to such indignity; and if Master persists in exchanging his dishes\
for mine, I shall emigrate without notice to the Isle of Dogs, where I hope to meet with\
more generous and gentlemanly behaviour.\
Surely, Grim, our superiors, par excellence, being omnivorous, might be content with what\
-they've got, and leave us in tranquil possession of our Arabians. If their jaded appetites\
pine for a change of aliment, let them, instead of coveting our dainties, ruminate over the\
Mule's poor relation, of which they have recently made such an Asinine show.\
Philosophers may say what they please; but I\
contend that Hippophagy is most revolting, and\
if we had an Ossian amongst us, its advocates\
would tremble at the indignation of the mews.\
Yours, &c, Tabitha.\
Cateaton Street.\
P.S. A great deal has been lately written\
about deterioration in racers, &c. Take my\
word for it, Grim, and I am a pretty good judge,\
it is all pooh, pooh, nonsense. I feel certain that\
my table is supplied with much better meat than\
any which, forty or fifty years ago, my great-\
great-granamother enjoyed. There is a tradition\
in our family, that when Eclipse came to us, the\
poor beast, what with age and work, was as\
tough as a drum-stick. Look at the cattle that\
are now brought to our market\'97they are, if not\
quite as tender, almost as young as a lamb.\
HAT FOR HAT.\
By Correspondence from Paris we are in-\
formed that Cardinal dm Bonnechose has de-\
livered to Pius the Ninth a sum of 150,000 fr.\
arising from Peter's pence. One good turn\
deserves another. The Pope has given De\
Bonnechose a hat, and Db Bonnecho.se has\
repaid the gift in kind. He has presented his\
Holiness the hat which had been sent round on\
his Holiness's behalf, with a hatful of money\
in it. The Holy Father has truly made a good\
thing of Bonnechose.\

at Brother Ignatius and his practices that she\
has given up bead-work and playing at Pope.\

not go to the Crystal Palace, because the Com-\

FLUNKIETTES AT SCHWALBACH.\
(To Mr. Punch.)'\
Sib,\
The opinion, which you lately felt yourself called upon to\
express, that the example of the Em i rbss or the French would be\
foil owed by the great majority of the female sex, if her Imperial Majesty\
were to take to wearing rings in her nose, may be considered, by some\
unthinking persons, to have been based on an exaggerated estimate of\
the proclivity of women in general to imitate that illustrious lady.\
Your estimates, Sir, are always framed with a scrupulous regard to\
accuracy, and are invariablv verified. Full justification, at least of that\
one which I refer to, has already appeared in a letter from Schwalbach\
in the Patrie, describing the habits, peculiarities, proceedings, and\
attire,\'97giving, in short, the natural history of Her Majesty, as observed\
at that medicinal watering-place. The writer of this interesting memoir\
says:\'97\
'' The water of the Weiasbrunnen, among ita other qualities, ia said to be injurious\
to the teeth. Therefore, before the arrival of Her Majesty, the ladien made use of\
glass tubes, by means of which they could drink the water without having to fear\
that while recovering their health, they would lose their teeth. Since the Em-\
press swallows each glass of water as a draught, those tubes have been thrown\
aside."\
For aught that it was possible for the ladies at Schwalbach to know,\
Sir, the Empress drank the Weissbrunnen water out of a tumbler,\
without the precaution of using a tube, just because she did not know\
that it was injurious to the teeth.or even from a possible want of solicitude\
for their preservation. I suppose that Nature has blessed Her Majesty\
with teeth of pearly whiteness, adamantine durability, and chemical com-\
position proof against all corrosive agencies. But those ladies cannot\
be sure that this, which may be, is so. They must know that Imperial\
dignity is not superior to human nature, and that there is an idiosyn-\
crasy that simply ignores the tooth-brush. Those, Sir, who would risk\
the ruin of their teeth rather than not imitate a personal eccentricity on\
the part of their idol, would little hesitate, by the same rule, to dis-\
figure their noses.\
Allow me, Sir. to add to the foregoing remarks, the observation, that\
if your wives and daughters would be half as regardful of reason as they\
are obsequious to fashion, they would render you, as husbands and\
fathers, objects of a sentiment more approaching to envy than that with\
which you are at present contemplated by'\

THE DISEASE OF STEALING.\
At one of the late meetings of the Social Science Congress a Paper\
was read on penal discipline, with reference to which:\'97\
"Lord TKiaNMOrrra suggested oakum-picking, and supported his view by tho\
opinion of Bishop Berkeley, that tar-water was a cure for all diseases." ''\
In the opinion of Lord Teignmouth, then, theft is merely the mani-\
festation ot a disease. Very well; but if oakum-picking is a cure for\
that disease affecting pickpockets, members of the swell mob, and\
common thieves of both sexes in general known to the Police, would it\
not be likely to be equally efficacious in the case of a fashionable lady\
affected with the same disease under the name of kleptomania?\

or some Peter or other. However, 1 '11 no more be a re-peater of this name, but\
come to the point at once. Point! that word recalls the scene from first to last.\
"Did I want the points "\'97he, the hairdresser, called them pints\'97" off? or would\
I'ave a deal off P I chose the latter. No sooner was I vested in a garment\'97\
something between a gentleman's summer dressing-gown and a lady's bathing-\
dress\'97of that grotesque pattern with which, of late, the pictures of a facetious\
singer styling himself "The Cure," have made us sufficiently acqnainted,\'97no\
sooner, I say was I bound in this extraordinary wrapper\'97like a volume of Strype\'97\
and had taken my seat in front of a large looking-glass, than the operator began\
arranging certain apparatus that filled me with apprehension, and made my ban-\
stand right up on end, all ready for cutting, like quills upon the fretful what-you-\
may-call-him. He first pulled ropes from the ceiling, after the manner of one about\
to imitate M. Leotard on the trapeze. These ropes were fitted with a peculiar\
pair of scissors, made, as I take it, on the model of those used in the opening of a\
Pantomime, when His Majesty King Humguffin sends for the Court Barber to\
trim him; on wbioh occasion the usual result is that the Court Barber is trimmed\
by His Gracious Majesty. I assure you that to have seen my hairdresser's talented\
assistants dance into the room, footing it to some lively measure, with huge cans\
labelled "Hot Water," "Soap," "Bear's Grease," would not have been to me a\
matter for much surprise. However, they didn't. Such a proceeding would have\
savoured of a joke; and that this, my friend, was no joke, I do most solemnly\
declare! Two more ropes held a circular comb: a young man took his place\
behind my chair; then there were, to use another stage phrase, "Wheels heard\
without," and, with a whirr-whirr-whirr, like the deafening sound in a small manu-\
factory, or in the Polytechnic during the hours of exhibition, the ropes began to\
move rapidly up, up, up, down, down, down, backwards and forwards, and round\
and round, the scissors commenced snipping the air, and the comb, as it appeared\
to me, began circling round my head, like the fearful stuffed nondescript bird at\
Astley's, which is worked by a string over the prostrate body of the agonised dummy\
Mazeffa. Suddenly, the young man controlled the gambols of these wild creatures,\
and directed them at my head. At my head, literally, not my hair. Bah! they\
disdained that, tearing through it like buffaloes through a prairie, and seizing upon\
my scalp with the ferocity of a Red Indian warrior.\
"Here! Hi! Take 'em off!" I cried.\
"You find 'em a little 'ard at first, Sir p" inquired the young man blandly.\
"Hard! I should rather say I "whirr, whirr, whirr,\'97off again. Hold!\
Stop I"\
The young man takes this opportunity to explain:\'97\
"You see. Sir. our Pronwtnr n*]*i *vti*~**J '\'97 1\'97J\

the comic wigs in which the Brothers Webb appeared as\

"Should he take hany more off?" inquired the young\
man\'97the youngest man, I subsequently found, who had not\
long been out of his apprenticeship.\
"Trim it evenly," said 1; "and.Jfor Heaven's sake,\

He smiled.\
"1 should prefer doin' of it in that way myself, Sir," he\
whispered in my ear, " but Master says we must use this\

put it in a more forcible manner\'97"You should 'ave a\

bottle of The Regenerator, then, with you, Sir, to-day,"\
and this, mind you, settles the question. If you don't\
buy his master's wares, on which the young man doubtless\
gets a per-centage, and justly too, you cannot but feel that\
you have fallen in the opinion of the hairdresser; not that\
this is of importance when you are once out of his hands,\
but while in the power of a man who holds the scissors\
over you, it is politic to make him think as much of you\
as possible. Boldly, therefore, profess a thorough know-\
ledge of all the unguents in the shop. "The Medicated\
Balsam is your constant companion: without the Titti-\
vator," say you, "no person's toilette-table can be com-\
plete. The Capellarion is the delight of your mornings\'97\
the Medicated Balsam the solace of your declining day."\

fierce iron or brazen arms appear from somewhere, armed\
with the stiffest of rough towels. I try to avoid the blow\
from the one on my right, and am caught with wonderful\
precision on my left ear by the other. Both arms begin\
to pummel me; whirr, whirr, go the wheels; everything\
seems in motion, the looking-glass, I fancy, dances, the\
cries of other struggling victims rise from various corners\
of the room, the little comb laughed to see such sport, the\

SPORT AND SPORT.\
There is a sweet bird, much of which was eaten on the 29th of last\
month, a bird which is usually accompanied at table by apple-sauce, in\
addition to sage and onions. A maxim of ancient wisdom and pro-\
verbial philosophy declares that the condiment which is proper for the\
female bird of this description is also proper for the male. The moral\
rule which corresponds to this canon of cookery is not always so\
religiously observed as it might be by those administrators of the law\
who are for the most part deservedly called Justices, but who, in some\
I instances, can be so termed only with ironical justice.\
[ At the Marylebone Police Court, the other day, a boy named Henry\
Radford was cited by one Rutherford, an Officer of the Society for\
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before Mr. Mansfield, charged\
with cruelty to a cat.\
The boy, at play with a lot of other boys, had tossed the cat some\
fifteen feet into the air, whence it fell and broke its back.\
Rutherford said, that it was not usual for the Society to take up\
cases against children under fourteen years of age, but they considered\
this to be a case so peculiar that they felt bound to prosecute." The\
peculiarity of the case, according to the evidence adduced to prove it,\
appears to be comprised in the foregoing statement. Sentencing the\
puerile prisoner:\'97\
"Mr. Mansfield remarked that It was a pity boys could bo found who were so\
cruel. He would commit the prisoner to the House of Correction for one month,\
with hard labour."\
It may be presumed that the cat was not thrown into the air by\
Master Henry Radfobd simply to test the truth of the popular\
saying, that a cat will always .fall on her legs. The Magistrate was\
surely satisfied that the child meant to hurt the cat.\
Of course it is necessary that boys under fourteen should be taught\
that it is wrong to break a cat's back. But any respectable, if ragged,\
school is fitter to instruct them in humanity than that of the House of\
Correction and hard labour.\
No doubt there is a difference between shooting stags, or hares and\
rabbits, so as to break their bones, and wantonly killing cats. Bat\
there is also a similarity. The difference is that, whereas venison, hare,\
and rabbit are good for food, cat is not, whatever foreigners may say to\
the contrary. The similarity is that the stags, hares, and rabbits on\
the one hand, and the cats on the other, are killed for sport. The\
gentry of England have certainly an excuse for shooting game, which\
street-boys have not for killing cats. When a nobleman kills several\
hundred hares in a battue, to be sure he shatters the spine of many a\
poor puss which is just as sensitive as one of the feline species. But\
then poor puss, the rodent, is edible, whereas the carnivorous poor puss\
is carrion. We know that my Lord bears that steadily in mind while\
he is out shooting, and considers, with just complacency, that he is not\
practising wanton cruelty on animals. Still he kills them for amuse-\
ment; so to speak, for fun. Therein lies the resemblance between the\
noble sportsman and the street boy. If the resemblance is close, is the\
difference so wide as to make a grandee worthy of having his amateur-\
butcher-work recorded in the journals to his glory and renown: but an\
urchin, for amusing himsel&in the same but a very much smaller way,\
deserve the treadmill?\
At it Again!\
Says the Roman Correspondent of the Star, "The 'remains of the\
Baths of Diocletian, and the best ruins left in Rome, are to be cleared\
away." Now, really this is too bad. The Baths of Diocletian can\
not be in the way from London to Chatham or Dover, and the Company\
must be exceeding its powers. We shall ask for an injunction.\

In consequence of the popularity attained by the'Sensation Stories,\
many romantic young ladies nave gone off with their grooms. We are,\
however, happy to learn, that, in every case, the happy objects of their\
choice have heen highly respectable Bride-Grooms.\

MARRIAGE IN LAW LIFE.\
We have much pleasure in announcing; that the honourable Law\
Craft is about shortly to be united to Equity, sole surviving Daughter\
and Heiress of the late Honest Man, formerly of Paradise Place, and\
whose loss many years ago was so deeply felt, and so universally\
lamented.\
We extract from Debrett the following interesting particulars:\'97\
The Craft family is one of great antiquity. In 100, Norman Craft\
having come into possession per fas et nrfas of the estates of Crass\
Saxon, formed an alliance with Lady Verbosity, by whom he had\
issue, 1st, Common Law Craft, and 2ndly Statute Law Craft. From\
these stocks are descended the great Delays, which figure so conspicu-\
ously in forensic circles. Between the Crafts and the Equities, a feud\
existed for many generations, similar to that between the Guelphs and\
Ghibelines, but with far more disastrous consequences, if we may credit\
the Reports in legal circnlation. It must however be admitted that\
although no branch of the Equity family was ever perhaps passionately\
enamoured of the Crafts, an alliance would long since have been formed\
between some of their members, had not the banns been forbidden, by\
certain parties who had expectations from the Crafts.\
On what moral ground they opposed the union of Law Craft and\
Equity, it is difficult to understand, unless that, looking at the Table of\
Consanguinity, they thought them to be too nearly related. We may\
observe en passant, that some of these interested parties were in the\
cabinet line, and had actually worked at the Bench.\
At length, however, a reconciliation has been effected, owing in some\
measure, we believe, to the kind offices of Sir J. P. Wilde, of Divorce\
Court, Westminster, whose frequent interference between man and wife\
has not met with its customary acknowledgment, his judicial counte-\
nance having no scratch at present on either side of it. Sir J. P. W.,\
we understand, will give away the Bride; and Westbury, of Old Square,\
Lottery Office Keeper, and celebrated as a seller of chances, patronised\
by Her Majesty, will furnish the trousseau, which includes an elegant\
selection of cases surmounted by the Royal Arms. The nuptials, it is\
anticipated, will be honoured by the presence of the eminent Physician\
Dr. Brougham, to whom the Law Crafts are considerably indebted,\
the Doctor having frequently been called in to prescribe for his old\
friend's lameness, and by whose judicious regimen the Patient's system\
has been braced. We sincerely hope that conjugal harmony will give a\
new tone to his constitution.\
WHO WOULD NOT BE A' GOVERNESS P\
After the warm weather we have had it is quite refreshing to meet\
with something cool, and really we have seldom met with anything so\
cool as this:\'97\
GOVERNESS WANTED, in a Young Ladies' School near London.\
"She will be required to teach English. French, music, and to have \'a350 at her\
command, which will be returned by Instalments.\'97Address, Ac.\
Not a word is said about the salary this governess will have, and we\
incline therefore to think that she will not be paid a shilling for her\
services. On the contrary, indeed, it seems that she will have to pay\
the sum of fifty pounds for the privilege of teaching English, French,\
and music: for although the money, it is said. "will be returned by\
instalments," no guarantee is given her that such, will be the case.\
Maxima Debetur Keverentia.\
We had heard that America was languishing for an aristocracy. A.\
proof of the statement comes by the last mails. "Ladies are about to\
be employed, at Philadelphia, as Reporters." This will make it\
sary for all the speakers to be gentlemen.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October Iff, 1864.\
QUIET WATERING-PLACES.\
No. II.\'97OWRYSTHLOGWDD (Continued).\
I Fully expected that in the morning I should find my hair turned\
white, as did those celebrated prison locks in ra single 'night. My\
mental relief, when the three somnambulists safely returned, each one\
to his own couch, may be, if you will allow me the use of a novel\
phrase, "easier imagined than described." Unable to close my eyes\
or my ears, I endeavoured to amuse myself with my note-book. With\
the results, the Limited Company have been already made acquainted.\
8'30 a.m.\'97Day breaking: evidently too early, as this morning's\
light is getting confusedly mixed up with last night's moon, the effect\
being to make the paper of my note-book a pale blueish colour, and I\
am writing this very line in a large round-hand scrawl, not unlike what\
I have been informed are Spirit characters, which will be perhaps\
illegible by broad daylight. Spirita, indeed! Pooh! I can just see to\
write Pooh in capitals. And yet in this strange hazily-lighted hour,\
the no man's lana between Yesterday and To-morrow, my imagination\
can picture Unsettled Existences on the confines of space, Beings\
neither altogether unearthly nor entirely ethereal, Incomprehensible\
Agencies capable of visiting us mortals even in our own rooms! . . . .\
What's that? Ob, nothing. Isn't it, thoughF Can Nothing open\
that door which I could have sworn nad been locked by Scissors?\
Yet the door is being opened without any visible cause. Perhaps it's\
the wind; perhaps it isn't. I will get out, and boldly examine the\
fhenomenon. On second thoughts, I think I'll do nothing of the sort,\
can hear my own heart beating loudly under the blankets. I am now\
altogether under the blankets. The notion occurs to me of burglars.\
I have heard some bold persons say that they'd rather meet flesh and\
blood at night than Spirits. Supposing that Burglars are flesh and\
blood, I think I'd rather meet Spirits. Shall I rouse the Collegians?\
Let me see. It would take a minute at least to wake them; another\
minute for them to gain a clear idea of their frightful position; and in\
the meantime what would the burglar, or burglars, be doing P Is any\
man at any time, in any way, under any circumstances, justified in\
imperilling a life, called, merely by courtesy, his own P Under favour\
of the blankets, beneath whose folds this colloquy between caution and\
temerity was carried on, I decide in the negative. As a chivalrous\
hero, I picture myself leaping forth to the combat; as an unmuscular\
Christian citizen, I breathe as quietly as possible, and allow one eye to\
peep out, over the blanket, as a cautious reconnoitring party.\
Something is moving about somewhere\'97crawling, as far as I can\
make out; puffing occasionally, blowing slightly; proceeding for a very\
short distance at a greatpace, then stopping altogether for the space of\
a minute, then setting off again in another direction. Is it the savage\
dog P No; nor does it sound like a cat. I know I shall be very ill\
to-morrow morning. Will these fellows never wake P The creature,\
whatever it may be, is on the floor at the foot of my. bedstead. I feel a\
tug at my blankets. More blowing and sputtering, and uncouth sounds,\
like partially-formed words. Oh! if I do but live over this, farewell to\
Gwrystlilogwdd, the Haunted Watering-Place! A bump on the floor,\
and another pull, ever so much more violent than before, at my blan-\
kets. I am in a cold perspiration. Ha! Something terrible has hap-\
pened in the passage outside! There are footsteps, and female voices.\
The Landlady, quite dressed, followed by a maid, enters the room with\
a light. "Sorry to disturb me," she says. Sorry! Bless her! I am\
delighted to see her. "Oh, Mrs. Owen, there have been such\
terrible '\\\
"Here he is, mum!" cried the maid, jumping forward towards the\
end of my bed.\
"Oh. Sarah, how could you leave him?" said Mrs. Owen, re-\
proachfully.\
Sabah f Leave him! Him! Whom! Was I dreaming P Were\
they talking of me, in my presence P Had the events of the night\
turned my brain P or was I in a trance P Sarah was on her knees, as\
far as I could make out, strugglingwith some resisting power on the\
floor by the foot of my bed. "What a monkey it is!" said Mrs.\
Owen.\
A Monkey! What an escape I had had! perhaps from a juvenile\
Gorilla, presented to the place by some seafaring man, amenable only\
to the voice of its recognised keeper, Sarah! I remember Bdoar\
Allan Pob's horrible story, founded on fact, of anOurang-Outang, who\
committed atrocious acts with a razor, and I shuddered, gratefully.\
Where was the imitative caricature of Man P Still on the floor. I\
would not attract his attention, lest he might break from his Sarah,\
and fly upon me. Those animals are so uncertain.\
"Do get t he blanket out of his mouth, Sarah, and take him away,"\
said Mrs. Owen.\
Take him away, by all means! What! swallowing a blanket I Does\
the creature unite to the mischievous tastes of a Monkey the digestive\
capacity of a Boa Constrictor? Is it a monster only known in Wales\'97\
one-third Monkey, one-third Boa, and the remaining third Constrictor!\
Horrible!\
"A naughty icky sing that wants to feel its tootsy-pootsies and go a\
walking it does," said Sarah.\
"Hey, what? Fondling a brute like that! Why surely, Mrs.\
Owen"\
"It's just your time that you wanted to be called: the clocks is\
wrong, Sir, church one and all," said Mrs. Owen, throwing back the\
shutters and letting in broad daylight. "But I'm sorry as the little\
'un should have worried you, Sir."\
This was said to me: the others were gradually turning and waking.1\
"The little 'un P the monkey P the boa constrictor P"\
"Lor' no. Sir: you ain't, arf awake: it's babt here,"[she answered.\
Yes: in Sarah s arms, wriggling to regain the floor, was a large-\
headed no-haired infant.\
"He's just a beginning to walk, the young monkey, and when his\
nuss's back's turned (you musn't leave him again, Sarah) he '11 just\
crawl in and out anywhere."\
Did the Landlady and the nurse tell the story to the Collegians and\
the Tourists, who, within an hocr, were all bustling about the place\
preparatory to starting upon their several expeditions! I do not\
know; but as I drove away from the inn, in a springless vehicle much\
patronised by the natives, the crowd waved their hats (which con-\
siderably frightened the horse and myself), and a detestable excur-\
sionist brass band of amateurs struck up an air to which J. W. H.\
sung loudly an absurd song commencing "I would I were a Baby!"\
which caused such shouts of laughter among the giddy Tourists, as rang\
in my ears biliously for half an hour afterwards, and only ceased\
altogether when we were half way on our road to Bangor. At Bangor\
I found my portmanteau.\
Note.\'97I hear that Gwrysthlogwdd is always, during the summer, in\
this state of excursionist commotion, and therefor > cannot be recom-\
mended to the Limited Company as The Quiet Watering-Place of\
which I am in search.\
A PUZZLE IN THE PORK TRADE.\
Brevity is said to be the soul of wit, and in point of saving pen-\
manship perhaps it may be said to be likewise the soul of business. But\
to a non-commercial mind there is something vastly puzzling in the\
curtness of this notice:\'97\
TO CHEESEMONGERS.\'97WANTED, by a Young Man, as SECOND\
WINDOW, used to the Pork and Rabbits. Willing to make himself useful.\'97\
Apply to A. H., tus.\
We have read this over twice without guessing what it is that is\
wanted by the advertiser. At the first reading we fancied he desired a\
situation, but, on our next perusal, we perceived that what he wants is\
to be "as second window," and we cannot understand in what manner\
a man can make a window of himself, although we certainly know some\
men who are easy to be seen through. Then pray who or what on\
earth is it that is "used to the pork and rabbits P" and which and\
where are "the" pork and rabbits he or it is used to? Perhaps some\
of our readers who are idling out of Town, and have nothing else to think\
about, may answer these queer queries: but for ourselves we must\
confess that we have neither time nor wish to speculate about them.\
THE NEW VICEROY.\
The amiable Lord Carlisle is succeeded, in Ireland, by Loss\
Wodehouse. We have been carefully studying Dod, and also Wal-\
ford, to discover, if possible, that some injury or insult has been\
inflicted on Ireland by the appointment of the_ new Viceroy. We can\
find nothing to the purpose in the books, but inasmuch as Lord Wo de-\
house is far too able and useful a man to be wasted on a moribund\
Sham, we have no doubt that Irish pat riots will see in the selection a\
proof of some deep and subtle plot against Oireland.\
[Ha! what is the brutal Punch talking about P No insult! We\
read the damning records of British feudalism. We see that this Saxon\
aristocrat had the impudence to be born in the foul year 1826, the\
year for ever memorable in the annals of oppression, when the Irish\
currency was regulated to the English standard! Spirit of Liberty,\
must we bear these things? And how long '(\'97The Nation.]\
\
General Sherman has respectfully informed the inhabitants of\
Atlanta that out they must go. But he adds, that as soon as peace is\
declared, he will divide with them "his last cracker." Mr. Stanton,\
not to be behindhand in kindness, telegraphs that he has been manufac-\
turing crackers all through the war, and that any he may have on hand,\
when the rebellion shall De put down, shall be at anybody's service.\
This is noble, though it reminds one a little of the orders of the Scotch-\
man, in the Bride of Lammermoor, after the dinner: "If anything is\
totally uneatable, let it just be given to the poor."\

A SIBYLLINE LEAF.\
\
the Brothers Davenport are making "a sensation" out of their cup-\
board\'97by the way, why don't they get into "a Davenport" when\
they are about it ?\'97and have even found their way into a place that\
is likely to be still more profitable to them than their cupboard, namely,\
the columns of the Tuxes. Professor Anderson may outdo all\
the marvels of all the Mediums by what he is content to call by\
its right name of jugglery, legerdemain, or sleight-of-hand. So de-\
scribed, his ingenuity and dexterity are legitimately employed in tricking\
our senses, and no one has a right to call him rogue, or to begrudge\
the shillings he extracts from the pockets of the crowds who fill St.\
James's Hall. But when "media" are substituted for mechanism.\
"spirits" for sleight-of-hand, and the mystical jargon of uneducated\
impostors for the clever jugglery of the Wizard of the North, Mr.\
Punch's baton must be out and rapping rogues on the head, and gulls\
and dupes on the knuckles. There lies before us a circular\'97the last\
and about the biggest dose of "flapdoodle" that has been shovelled\
into British spoons by Transatlantic tricksters of the Spiritualist sort.\
It is headed\'97\
"THE IGREATESTi DISCO VERY EVER MADE,\
It the MEDIATION WRITISO dirtet to, and from, Vie 'Spirit World, in One Minute/\
uitkout any Meehanienx, except Pen, Ink, andPaper."\
Admire on [the" threshold the punctuation and phraseology of the\
Spiritually-inspired compiler. The Seers, in these respects, seem on a\
par with "the Sperrits." We have long been aware that the latter,\
as a rule, are hazy about their spelling and grammar. It is clear\
that jEacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus have not as yet esta-\
blished any Board like the Civil Service Commissioners, or not one in a\
hundred Sperrits" (as the Mediums reveal them to us) could ever\
have passed into their shadowy realm. Or it may be, perhaps, (and this\
seems most reconcileable with the observed facts) that the only Spirits\
allowed to communicate with the Mediums are those incapable ghosts\
who. being unable to pass their examinations for spiritual situations,\
on the ground of gross deficiency in " the three R.'s, are left in limbo,\
out of employment, and reduced to eke out a discreditable livelihood by\
rapping, hand-showing, accordion-playing out of tune, mis-spelling, and\
the other degrading performances with which they are now so humilia-\
tingly associated.\
This communication to the large world of geese'and gulls, which we\
reproduce, verbatim et literatim, in every point except the Sybil's name,\
goes on\'97\
"MRS. BOUNCE BUBBLER, SiDtl* Medium,\
Has tho extraordinary Rift of holding communions and conversation, for any length\
of time, and anywhere, with the departed in the Spirit World, who are not dead,\
but living, to give the moat delightful intelligence of the Spirit world they have\
passed into, sinco they have left the earth; who hail with joy, being able to write\
to their loved ones on the earth, to identify \'b0themsolvea,to their beroaved friends."\
Alas, poor ghosts! If this is to be the style of spiritual correspond-\
ence, surviving relatives, we would suppose, must blush, rather than\
"hail with joy," when the departed take " to identify themselves to their\
bereaved friends." The universal prayer for the dead ought to be\
"requiescat in pace" more than ever, and, above all, "may our friends'\
ghosts be strictly forbidden the use of pens, ink, and paper."\
Now for Mrs. Bubbler's theory of this " extraordinary gift: "\'97\
"Now if ViU be true, surely it is the greatest phenomenon ever heard of, and opens\
the widest field for inquiry and consolation ever known; For what can be more\
charming than to write to our beloved ones just gone from us, and in a few minutes\
to receive an answer, telling us they are actually more alive now than when on the\
earth, because they have left the dead material body, and as St. Paul declares, are a\
4 spiritual body,' and arc elevated to that sphere they have earned on the earth.\
What can be more reasonable to the scientific mind than to believe the higher\
spheres, or planets, are inhabited, as well as our planet the Earth f And as we know\
man has got the power of sending his message from one city to another, is it not\
reasonable to believe, that God has given his progressive Spirits, who are in His\
keeping, in tho Spirit world, the power to communicate from ono sphere to another\
sphere, as easy as man can from city to city T If this be denied, it gives more power\
to man than Ood 1 Man's power is mechanical electricity\'97God's power is Spiritual\
Electricity\'97which as far surpasses the electric telegraph, as heaven surpasses tho\
earth 1 and is a law of nature not yet understood, but is revealed to me, through\
this marvellous writing, which swallows up death in victory 1 through which many\
prophecies are written to me I"\
We commend the"caution of the qualification "If this be true"\'97\
"Great virtue in an if!" But what is far stranger than "the gift" itself,\
is that it should.be given to such hands as the Forsters and Homes\
and Bubblers.\
But the " Sibyle Medium" is not sordid, nor selfish. She does not\
desire to keep the gift to herself. She has the will and the power to\
dispose of it to others\'97for a consideration. At least she can teach all\
to " write to their loved ones:" though, it is to be noted, that she does\
not undertake they will receive answers\'97which one would have sup-\
posed the important point. She promises to teach us "to call spirits\
from the vasty deep; while she leaves us to ask, with Hotspur, But\
will they come'"'\
"I here declare I have no desire .to keep so great "a privilege to myself, because I\
have the power given me to teach others\'97either believers or sceptics t\'97to enable\
them to write to their loved ones, quite independent of mo, after I havo taught\
them ; who can investigate the truth of this statement for themselves\'97for what\
we can do ourselves, we know to bo true\'97teaching others will be the best means of\
making this great gift known."\
And now for the list of 'Mrs. Bubbler's spiritual acquaintance.\
It is large, and decidedly mixed. Death, like misery, evidently makes\
men "acquainted with strange bedfellows;" and not the most hetero-\
geneous crush" at a scientific London conversazione\'97not even a\
Saturday night at Cambridge House itself\'97ever exhibited a more\
queerly compounded "lot" than that which enjoys the privilege of\
exchanging raps or notes with Mrs. Bubbler. The only assemblage\
to compare with it is the.famous one in the Groves of Blarney\'97\
"The Haythin Gods and Goddesses so fair,\
Bould Plutarch, Niptune, and Nicodamus,\
All standin' stark naked in the open air."\
111 can commune with the Spirit nearly as soon as it has left the body! Time is\
no barrier: for no Spirit can resist my call! I have the communions of Adam,\
God's first man, who has given an account of tho universal law, which God gave\
him ; also Father Abraham, Noah, Hoses, Aaron, Solomon, Lorenzu, St. Paul, St.\
Peter, John the Baptist, John the Evangelist Joeephus the Jewish historian;\
Pilate, Herod, Arophion, King of Thebes; Daniel and the other Prophets, Stephen,\
Timothy: the Sibyls of tho Delphi Temple, and others: Queen Elisabeth, Mary\
Queen of Scots, Pope, Milton, Lord Bacon, Lord Hastings, the great Sir Isaac\
Newton, who gives a philosophical explanation of this mediation writing; Sweden-\
borg, who contradicts much he has written ; John Bunyan, Titian, the great painter,\
communicates a full account of his method of painting; and Van Eyck, the inventor\
of oil painting, gives me his secret of oil painting, so the secret of oil painting by\
the old masters need nover bo lost again. Shakspeare, Byron, Bums, and Thacke-\
ray, write poetry to me. Shakspeare has written his own life from the Spirit world,\
because 1 have written him aU that has taken place at Stratford relative to himself.\
Napoleon Bonaparte, Howard, Hall, Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Robert Peel, Sir Francis\
Burdett, Bloomfield, the Duke of Buckingham, tho Duke of Bedford, Sir Benjamin\
Brodie, Dr. Whately, Lord Lyndhurat, Lord Clyde, Robert Owen, Miss Catharine\
Sinclair, the Duke of Wellington, Sir John Franklin, Lord Auckland, Hon. Miss\
Eden, Lady Craven, George the Fourth, Ring of England, and many others ; three\
communications from the Duchess of Kent, to write to her daughter the Queen\
Victoria; a great number from our lamented Prince Consort, who has come spon-\
taneously ever since he left the earth, requesting me to write to his beloved Queen,\
which I did on tho 16th November, lMz, And it is by his request I now make it\
public for the consolation of the world."\
One fact here communicated is painful\'97to say the least of it. Shak-\
speare has had the whole history of his own Tercentenary humiliation\
inflicted upon him by Mrs. Bubbler. He knows of the squabbles\
that beset that luckless undertaking; is cognisant of the names of his\
principal Tercentenary worshippers; and must be aware (we fear) of\
the statues promised and the deficit actually realised. He has sent\
back his "Life" in return. Mrs. Bubbler is bound to publish it.\
The quintessence of all the wit and wisdom of this highly distin-\
guished list of Mrs. Bubbler's own correspondents can be had cheap;\

HONOUR TO SCOTLAND.\
Mr. P. B. Smollett, Member for Dunbarton, addressing a Meeting of his Constituents at\
Helensburgh on public alfairs, made an iucidcntal remark on Mr. Mackinnon, Member for\
Rye, whom he described as " a gentleman who always sits behind the Ministers with his knees\
on their backs." He said:\'97\
"Mr. MacKinnon, I dare say, ia a very good gentleman: he calls himself, I believe, the head of the\
clan Mackinnon, therefore I suppose he ia a Scotchman; but it would puzzle a conjuror to know the reason\
why he should be raised to the peerage, except that he had been instrumental in destroying Lord Russell's\
bill."\
This sentence is capable of bearing two constructions.\
Mr. Smollett may have meant to say that, inasmuch as he believes Mr. Mackinnon to be\
the head of the clan Mackinnon, and therefore supposes him to be a Scotchman, he dares say\
that Mr. Mackinnon is a very good gentleman, but thinks that the merit of being merely\
a good gentleman does not entitle him to be made a peer.\
Or he may have meant simply to say that, although for the reasons above stated he sup-\
poses Mr. Mackinnon to be a Scotchman, nevertheless, Scotchman as Mr. Mackinnon is,\
he still does not deem him worthy of being raised to the peerage.\
By the former construction of the words above quoted, Mr. Smollett would be understood\
to imply that a Scotchman, as such, may be presumed to be a very good gentleman.\
By the latter construction of those words, Mr. Smollett would be taken to intimate that\
although the advantage of being a Scotchman is certainly not of itself alone sufficiently\
meritorious to give a man any claim to a seat in the House of Lords, it is, nevertheless,\
of itself considerably meritorious.\
Whatever Mr. Mackinnon may be, there can be no doubt that Mr. Smollett is a\
thorough Scotchman.\

PROSPECTS OF ENGLISH MUSIC.\
At length we have an English Opera Company, and\
it opens in a becoming manner, with true English music.\
We rejoice to learn that the reproach that we are not a\
musical nation (observing what musical nations are,\
some folks may. however, think the reproach a compli-\
ment) will now be done away. The Season begins with\
a masterpiece of the celebrated English or rather Irish\
composer, Denis Aubeb. He Frenchified his name,\
in accordance with fashion, but he was an Irishman, and\
his real names were Dennis O'Babe. His opera of\
Masaniello, with which the Season begins, was originally\
called Robert Emmet, and was based on a story of the\
Irish rebellion, but the scene was transferred to Italy,\
in order to avoid political agitation. We almost regret\
that now that Ireland has no grievance (except the\
English names of the streets in Dublin) the opera has\
not been restored to its original form. The next Eng-\
lish revival is Martha the genuinely British work\
of Mb, Floater, who, like O'Bare, varied his name to\
Flotow. The fact that the only remarkable thing in\
this work is the "Last Rose m Summer," shows its\
Anglican origin. Of the third English work, a novelty\
called Hetvellyn, we know nothing, except that it is\
written by a first-rate British musician, Mb. Mac-\
fabren, and ought to be as successful as either of the\
operas that are to precede it. Let us add\'97and with\
loud plaudit\'97that the new management announces that\
"there is to be no charge for booking places, nor are\
the tmployes or boxkeepers to be permitted to take any\
fees on any pretence whatever." Did we say that\
Covent Garden is the place, and Alfred Mellon the\
Conductor P Come, those are English features, anyhow.\
Rooi-too-i-too-ey!\
It is\
How to Observe.\
pleasing to compare the habits of different\
nations. In Java an empty flower-pot at the window\
means that inside the house is a young lady who wants\
a husband. In England a full flower-pot at the window\
means that inside the house is a young lady who has got\
a husband,\'97and sells his old trousers.\
ayes and noes.\
Brighton will, Mr. Punch earnestly hopes, be soon\
represented by an able and accomplished gentleman who\
has no need of [eyes to instruct him in statesmanship.\
But if Brighton return a candidate with no eyes, its\
neighbour Hastings ought, by all accounts, to return\
one with no nose.\
CLOSE OF THE_EXHIBITION.\
Is Reviewing the Exhibition, which as we learn from our Vienna\
Correspondent, is by Court direction now drawing to a close, we are\
struck by the boldness of outline which distinguishes the great Works\
of our modern female Artists. While complaining with pretty petulance\
that they are excluded from many fields |of professional competition,\
these lovely and powerful Draughtswomen have confronted Man upon\
his own ground, and made him deeply sensible of his comparative insig-\
nificance. It is not speaking hyperbolically to say that their works in\
steel have swept ^everything before them\'97including dust in several\
volumes.\
Resolved to carry out her magnificent designs to their fullest extent,\
woman has triumphed over obstacles which some of our boldest engi-\
neers might have shuddered to approach. When Stephenson was\
required to throw a tubular bridge over an arm of the sea, he had no\
misgivings of his success; but had he attempted with feminine temerity\
to carry single-handed a hollow cylinder over Ludgate Hill, for example,\
he would have found himself in fearful straits indeed. Yet this under-\
taking is performed every day by Miss Smith with smiling impunity.\
The Roman invasion left us some mighty monuments, which the\
more recent conquest of Britain by woman has completely cast into the\
shade. He whose egotism dictated the celebrated note of exclamations,\
"Feni\'97vidi\'97vici" darkened this fair Isle by his overpowering pre-\
sence; but historians will agree that, looked upon simply as an extin-\
guisher, C.ksak must bow to Crinoline.\
No candid observer will deny that Man is a patient and much suffer-\
ing creature. Arrested in the pubuc streets, impeded in his daily\
walks, crushed, worried and prostrated at Opera, Ball. and.Conversazione,\
hitherto scarcely a murmur lias escaped from behind his long-enduring\
vest. But now that the hour of his deliverance draws near, it is pos-\
sible that a spirit of retaliation may spring up within him. After having\
been so long kept at a chilling distance from Beatrice and bliss, who\
could marvel if, with vindictive cunning, he should tear a leaf from the\
book of Beauty when it has been haughtily thrown aside P Suppose for\
a moment that, animated by a Mephistophelian impulse, he were to\
envelope his majestic form in a mantle curiously embroidered with\
fishing-hooks, long enough and strong enough to hold a barbel? Dare\
she, whose huge, example made him err, fling even a feather at her\
humble copyist P Nemesis answers, No. Vain then will be her tears,\
her penitence, her agony; for as surely as fashion leads to folly, so with\
painful certainty will Blanche be\'97caught at last.\
In conclusion, let it be remembered that he is deserving of honour\
who makes two blades of grass to flourish where but one grew before.\
What compliments then may Punch not anticipate, when by repealing\
a preposterous inclosure Act, a bevy of Beauties is enabled to rotate\
upon ground where before it was utterly impossible to plant together\
a Brunette and a Blonde P\
The Knot Untied.\
The Davinport Brothers, whose extraordinary "manifestations"\
have been so well shown up by the Rev. A. S. Dobbs, are attended by\
three of their countrymen, who act as their expositors. These gentle-\
men are taken for Yankees, but it seems more likely that they are\
Confederates.\

\
LICENCE FOE EXETER HALL.\
Last week the Public Houses were licensed by the Magistrates. In\
the report of the proceedings we find this statement:\'97\
"Mr. Poland applied for a renewal of a music licenco to Hrnry Pownall, Esq.'\
J. Corduroy, Esq , Sum i i. Haydon, Esq., Paul Augostinu Kjnodon, Esq., John\
Fish Pownall, Esq., aud Basil Woodd, Esq., for Exeter HalL\
11 The licence was granted.1*\
This is true, but the report is a very inadequate representation of\
what took place before the worthy Magistrates, and Mr. Punch feels it\
his duty to supply the omissions.\
On the licence being asked for,\
Mr. Punch, QC, rose, and begged leave to say a few words. He\
appeared on behalf of the British Public, for whom he held a general\
retainer. He was not about to oppose the application, unless unsatis-\
factory replies should be made to certain inquiries which he should\
make. He entirely approved, indeed, of Exeter Hall being used for\
musical purposes, being himself very fond of music of the higher class.\
The Chairman said that any information as to the learned gentle-\
man's private tastes could not be otherwise than interesting; but as\
there was a good deal of business before them\
Mr. Punch was the last person to interfere with the progress of\
public business.\
The Chairman. But you are interfering with it.\
Mr. Punch was in the habit of addressing much higher tribunals\
than that before which he had then the honour of appearing, and must\
say that unless counsel were allowed a certain discretion\
The Chairman. Counsel is now displaying indiscretion.\
Mr. Punch must respectfully observe that though the learned\
Chairman was no doubt all that was estimable in his private capacity, it\
would be difficult for him, Mr. Punch, to convey in forensic language\
the depressed estimate he had formed of that learned person's judicial\
intelligence.\
The Chairman said that they did not sit there to wrangle with\
counsel.\
Mr. Punch concurred in that remark, and was glad the learned\
Chairman comprehended that he sat there to be instructed by counsel,\
and to be preserved from absurdities into which persons fell who did not\
enjoy that advantage.\
After this little ordinary "scene, business was resumed, and Mr. Punch,\
remarked with his usual good humour, that if he had saia anything offen-\
sive to the worthy Magistrates, he heartily forgave them, and dismissed\
the matter from his recollection. He had always regarded the Middlesex\
Magistrates as the palladium of British liberty and the cynosure of\
neighbouring eyes. He would now proceed to say, or rather, in confor-\
mity with his friend Dean Trench's suggestion, would go ou to say,\
that no possible exception could be taken to the performance in Exeter\
Hall of the masterpieces of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Mendelssohn.\
and others. But he wished to ask Mr. Pownall a few questions. Arid,\
first he would ask that gentleman, against whose character he bad\
nothing whatever to say, whether Exeter Hall was not always crowded\
on oratorio nights?\
Mr. Pownall. I believe so.\
Mr. Punch. Inconveniently crowded, from the number of tickets\
issued being in excess of that of the seats provided?\
Mr. Pownall. We have nothing to do with that. It is between the\
managers of the performances and the public. Besides, English people\
like a crush, and I am told, though of course I never go near such\
places, that nothing fills worldly and wicked theatres like a statement\
that nobody can get in.\
Mr. Punch. Very well, Sir, very well. The answer savours slight ly\
of the worldhness you are so desirous to disclaim (especially as your\
rent is paid by the aid of the shillings of persons who are unable to\
obtain what they believed they purchased) but business is business.\
But now, Mr. Pownall, answer this. What facihties for |\
provided for these great crowds P\
are\
Mr. Pownall. That is between the architect and the public.\
Mr. Punch. I must have a better answer than that.\
Mr. Pownall. Well, Sir, if people walk down-stairs becomingly and\
quietly, as they ought to do alter hearing sacred music, they will get\
out as they came in; that is to say, in perfect safety.\
Mr. Punch. Do you believe that the performance of sacred music\
miraculously preserves a building from fire P\
Mr. Pownall. I am not prepared to say that I do.\
Mr. Punch. There have been, I believe, fires, or alarms of fire, in\
churches and chapels, where religious and decorous feelings must be\
stronger than even after a concert, and yet people have rushed out fran-\
tically, and have been trampled on or crushed.\
Mr. Pownall. I have read of such afflictions. I have heard of\
similar judgments on people in theatres.\
Mr. Punch. What reason have you for believing that no such event\
can occur in Exeter Hall P\
Mr. Pownall. I never said that it could not occur.\
Mr. Punch. Very well. Sir. If it should, is it not notorious that\
the vomitories of Exeter Hall are insufficient for the release of a terrified\
multitude?\
Mr. Pownall. A multitude should sit still until the nature of the\
casualty can be ascertained, and explained, and in all probability it will\
turn out to be a trifle. But if it be necessary to leave the Hall, it is\
the multitude's own fault if it rushes, and crushes, and tumbles.\
Mr. Punch. A very just observation, Sir. Are you aware that the\
architect of the theatre near the Hall, the Adelphi, has provided so\
many exits that, as was lately shown, an audience can be turned into\
the streets in five minutes?\
Mr. Pownall. I have read such a statement. Do you expect the\
Trustees of Exeter Hall to copy the devices of a theatre P\
Mr. Punch. You have no right to question counsel, Sir, but I\
reply that those holy and virtuous men copy those devices to\
the extent of taking money obtained by offering every attraction\
to the public. Your rent is made out of singers and players from\
the Opera, led by the great Opera Conductor of the day, and one of\
your greatest nights occurs when your lyric theatre gives the works of\
the author of Don Juan. Are you not theatrical managers?\
Mr. Pownall. Sir, 1 heartily thank you. I am not narrow-minded,\
and you have convinced me. That we, the Trustees, do not ourselves\
sell tickets is nothing. We share the gains, and qui facil per alium\
\\facit per se. I have to say, on the part of myself and colleagues, that\
we feel how frightful would be the responsibility in case of accident,\
and our architect shall be requested to visit the theatre\'97Mr. Web-\
ster's, I believe\'97and examine his improvements wit h a view to their\
adoption at the Hall. Philadelpheion shall learn from the Jde/phi.\
Mr. Punch. I said, Mr. Chairman, that I had no intention of op-\
posing this licence, I now beg to add, valeant quantum, my most earnest\
assurances that I hope it may be granted.\
The Chairman. Recommendation from Mr. Punch is\
Mr. Punch. 0,1 am sure you are\
Licence granted, and .the, case of the Pig and Scissors, Ratcliffe\
Highway, called on.\
"Wer't his Neck-verse at Hairibee."\
In the balance sheet just extorted from the notorious Colonel\
Waugh, is the item, "By Church account, \'a37,256 8*. 5d." What it\
means we know not, but sundry whom he lias ruined would probably\
not be sorry to see him in the position in which culprits used to demand\
Benefit of Clergy.\
PAPAL PERFORABILITT.\
Letters from Rome state that "the Pope was impenetrable with\
regard to the Franco-Italian convention." By other accounts we un-\
derstand that his Holiness is much bored with it.\

THE TICKET-OF-LEAVE QUEEN.\
(From the Gazette iet Tribunaux.)\
"Queen Christina, after an exile of many-\
years, has arrived at Madrid." She will, of\
course, be under police surveillance, and will, it\
is hoped, do nothing to forfeit her ticket-of-leave.\
It will be interesting to observe how far the\
theory of the regeneration of offenders is vindi-\
cated in the case of this personage, but we regret\
that the experiment should be tried at the ex-\
pense of the Spaniards, who have recently been\
making advances in morals, and who must feel\
like the Australians upon the subject of " exiles."\
It is stated, however, that she will soon be re-\
moved to tbe Asturias, though Annabon, on\
the west coast of Africa, is a Spanish possession\
that might seem a more desirable retormatory.\
The Queen is said to lend a willing ear to the\
counsels of her priests, but we are unable to\
attach a gratifying significance to this repre-\
sentation.\
WELL HIT.\
The bitterest bit of satire which we have\
lately read, concludes a notice, in the Home\
News, of a piece recently produced:\'97\
"The language and allusions are very coarse/the in-\
cidents are riotous, and the acting is extravagant.\
Nearly every character is allowed to appear in several\
disguises, and the plot is slight and absurdly,improbable.\
The piece wet* successful.'*\
Those last four words, taken in connection\
with what precedes them, make as good a dig\
into the intelligent and fastidious British public\
as we desire to see. It is comforting to find,\
now and then, a critic who has no reasons of\
his own for puffing a theatre. We should have\
a better drama if all who write theatrical notices\
were as plain spoken as our contemporary.\
SOMETHING LIKE ENGLISH.\
The possession of the power of speaking and writing the British\
language with accuracy is the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.\
This is certain. But it is by no means so certain that this power can\
be acquired at any of the recognised British schools of learning. We\
do not suppose that there is an Eton or Westminster boy who can write\
a grammatical note of three pages, and the Archbishop op York has\
lately told us that the University men are for the most part awful\
dunces. Being constantly applied to for advice as to the placing of\
youth, Mr. Punch has been somewhat bothered. But a card which has\
just been sent to him from Bonn, induces him to think that the true\
well of English undefiled is to be found in that citv. If mere shoe-\
makers can write in the beautiful manner exemplified in the following\
document, what wonders of composition must the professors of the\
University perform. Until further notice, therefore, Mr Punch thinks\
that anyone who wishes his son to write really good English (many\
persons get on very well without the accomplishment) had better send\
the youth to Bonn:\'97\

RUSSELL'S RULE OF TWO.\
"The Vienna journals publish advices fi om Athens, stating that Earl Russell\
had addressed a note to the Greek Cabinet, declaring that England recognised no\
factions in Greece, and condemned anarchical demonstrations. Earl Russell\
further stated that in case of necessity England would, in conjunction with France\
and RusBia, take measures for the maintenance of order and the strengthening of\
the reigning dynasty."\
The reasons are patent for non-intervention\

OUR EQUESTRIAN ORDER.\
You foreigners who talk so much nonsense about the haughty aris-\
tocracy of England, read the following extract from a daily record of\
their movements:\'97\
*' Tho Earl and Countess of Warwick and family, arrived on Saturday at their\
house in the Stable-yard, St. James's, from Bingham Villa, Richmond."\
There's humility for you! Which of your Saints ever showed a\
brighter example of the virtue so named than that of leaving a lordly\
Villa to go and live in a Stable-yard? Eli? Ab, but then, you will\
say that this change of residence was dictated not at all by lowliness,\
but proceeded from predilection for the horse; from the sympathy with\
that noble animal which characterises the British nobility; so that the\
preference of the Stable-yard to the Villa was merely an indication of\
the Stable Mind.\

flavour which exceeds that of the oycter."\
It is a pity that the Social Scientifics have separated, as we should\
have liked to present a paper on the subject of this paragraph. It is\
now understood that human beings acquire a certain portion of the\
nature of that on which they feed. Persons who eat many oysters hate\
to be shaved. Persons fond of pork always keep their rooms in a litter\
of slovenliness. Persons who delight in goose get to believe in Dr.\
Gumming. Suppose that the Parisian nature should assimilate itself to\
that of the Snail. Suppose\'97it is a very wild idea, doubtless\'97that\
Parisian women should learn to stay, like snails, in their own houses.\
And suppose their imitators on this side of La Manche should imitate\
them in that. How husbands would save in the articles of cabs and\
white cravats! The notion has so inspired us that we have ordered\
a new brooch, with an enamelled snail on it, as a present to the wife of\

your mine whose ores are\

of statesmen, divines, lawyers,\
soldiers, bards, philosophers,\
and men of science, popular\
writers, preachers, actors, and\
artists, expert fiddlers, wonder-\

Gallery of Physiognomy may be just such a one as the Chamber of that name at\
Tussaud's\'97formerly the Chamber of Horrors.\
Headed "Muller," advertisements have many times appeared in respectable\
papers offering to send portraits of that celebrity on the receipt of certain postage-\
stamps. In the window of a picture-shop in Cheapside, his likenesses are arranged\
round a central figure in the form of rays. They are only one shilling a-piece. Here\

may be a foundation for your Portrait Album of Physio-\
gnomy. But perhaps you will defer your purchase till\
Muller has been tried, for, should he be acquitted of the\
murder of Mk. Briggs, he will cease to be an object of\
thrilling interest, and subside at once into a small German\
tailor.\
Were you convinced of Muller's guilt, however, you\
would do well to get his photograph before any possible\
increase of its price. Mullers, hereafter, may, as the\
working-man says, be ri/.. You might buy the prisoner's\
portrait on speculation. In the mean time, to assist you iu\
the formation of your Gallery, enterprising photographers\
might supply you with accurate views of the existing casts\
of the heads of Palmer, Risii, the Mannings, Green-\
acre, Courvoisier, and other heroes and heroines whose\
relics repose in gaol, and whose claim to the renown which\
is as yet questionable in Mullek's case, has been con-\
firmed By proper arrangements between photographic\
artists and the police, authentic likenesses of all distin-\
guished murderers might be secured. Whether Mullek\
shall ultimately be placed in your Album or not, let not\
Muller's crowned countryman be omitted there; the pious\
Sovereign who solemnly thanked Heaven for having been\
suffered^to slaughter the Danes. Add Von FaLkehstein,\
the plunderer of Jutland. To the chief assassins of the\
age add also all the other eminent felons, and rogues, and\
thieves, that yon can obtain. Then, in your Portrait\
Album of Physiognomy you will have a mine of ruffianry\
and rascalry among Whose treasures your little boys and\
girls may dig to the great development of their higher\
feelings.\

on Monday last, of the statue to the apostle of Temperance,\

AN EAKLY DANCING MOVEMENT WANTED.\
Mr dear Mrs. Fitz-Brown.\
Op course, like every other loyal British subject, you have been\
reading with deep interest the accounts of H.It.H. the Prince ok\
Wales' recent trip to Sweden with his charming wife. How delightful\
it must be when one takes a little tour to have reporters at one's heels\
wherever one may go, and to know that all one does will be jotted down\
in note-books and published in big print!\
Iu our Prince's dancing, my dear Madam, you and all your charming\
sex must take the deepest interest, if only for the sake of feeling ever-\
lasting envy of those whom he has honoured for live minutes with his\
hand. You must be also vastly charmed by the descriptions of the\
dresses worn at these Royal dances, and must feel immense delight in\
being told that at the Ball which was given to the Prince by the Queen\
Dowager of Sweden\'97\
"The Princess of Wales was dressed in rose-coloured tulle,' interspersed with\
white Uoniton lace, and her htad-dross was formed of white and red flowers and\
berries, mingled with diamonds."\
But what charmed your humble servant even more than this was to\
learn that\'97\
"The way was soon led to the Ball-room : and it should be mentioned that, in\
accordance with Swedish custom, the entertainment liegan and ended early. There\
had previously been a dinner, to which, beside the Royal personages now in\
Stockholm, and their suites, the members of the Legation, Captain Sir Leopold\
M'Cuntock, Captain Bowes, and Captain Suttik, wero bidden ; and the hour\
appointed for this dinner had been half-past four. The Bali, therefore, was actually\
opened very shortly after eight o'clock, and it was completely over by midnight."\
Woman is, they say, an imitative creature, especially where Queens\
and Princesses are concerned; and I wish with all my heart that you\
and other English ladies would imitate this Swedish fashion of giving\
early parties, and of suffering your guests, as at the Ball of the Queen\
Dowager, to come and go away at reasonable hours. I regret to tell\
you my own dancing days are over; but, as the father of a family, I\
often have to dance attendance at a party, while my wife is waiting to\
take our daughters home; and it would be a great boon to me and\
other heavy lathers, whose toes, although in shape "fantastic," are not\
so "light" alas! and lively as they used to be, if the Swedish hours\
for dancing were thought fashionable in England, and we could leave a\
ball ere midnight, and by one be snug in bed. I hardly know a greater\
torture than for parents like myself to be deprived of their night's rest\
in the manner we have been, since people took it in their heads that it\
was not proper to go to "evening" parlies until twelve o'clock at\
night. The Waits at Christmas-time are a great nuisance, no doubt;\
but they are nothing to the nuisance of the waits that we poor parents\
have to undergo at parties, while dearest Jennie has her sixteen after-\
supper dances, and darling Juliana cannot think of going home without\
having that last waltz.\
Pray, then, my dear Madam, do follow the Swedish fashion when\
next you give a dance, and use your strongest influence to make the\
custom general. Think how many wretched parents will bless you for\
increasing their chance of a night's rest, and how many happy daughters\
will be all the healthier for keeping earlier hours. To quote the poet-\
somewhat altered:\'97\
"Early to dance, and early to bed.\
Makes a girl healthy, and keeps her cheeks red."\
Depend upon it. Madam, sleep deterred maketh the young sick, and\
there is nothing like late hours for sallowing the complexion. Turning\
night into day is a practice against nature, and it is no great wonder\
that nature makes us suffer for it. As a rule, I think that men prefer\
red cheeks to yellow ones. So let the early dancing movement be fol-\
lowed here in England as it is in Sweden, and your daughters will more\
readily obtain partners for life, while your poor old husbands, ladies,\
will not be tired to death when they are dragged out to a dance.\
Believe me, my dear Madam, yours with the assurance of my highest\
admiration, if you help in this good work, pATEBPAMJLUS Punch.\
P.S. Officers are vastly popular in ball-rooms, perhaps because they\
generally are the last to leave them. But were I to mention one whom,\
it' he acts up to his name, I should most welcome to my house, it would\
be General Early.\

ROYAL NOTIFICATION.\
We had not intended to allude to a certain matter, which is in a\
sense private, although in another sense public, by reason that an Act\
of Parliament is a motive agent, or rather a hindering one, in the\
business. But as the affair is now the theme of newspaper paragraphs,\
we reluctantly touch upon it, for a purpose :\'97\
"We are informed," says the Qufcn (newspaper) 11 that tho Royal Marriage Act\
has become moat oppressive to a certain member of the Royal Family\'97a lndy who\
has endoared herself to the hearts of the British nation aa much by the frankness of\
her nature and the kindliness of her heart as by her remarkable and peculiarly\
Saxon personal charms. This lady (so it is stated) is now sought in wedlock by a\
gallant young soldier of noble birth, and she is not reported to have frowned upon\
his suit. The consent of her Majesty is alone required to make the couple supremely\
happy; but that consent is for tho moment withheld."\
As our gracious Sovereign never does anything but for the kindest\
reason, we are compelled to conclude that the consent required to what\
seems to be a most proper marriage is withheld only until assurance\
lias been given that such a union will not disappoint any young' Prince\
of the House of Punch. We therefore hasten to state that while we\
are second to none in affectionate admiration of the Lady whose happi-\
ness is said to be in question, we have other views for the marriageable\
scions of the illustrious family of which we are the head, and that\
nothing would give us, and our people, more pleasure than to see the\
contemplated arrangement carried out with the sanction of the\
Sovereign. All happiness to the gallant Viscount Cucullus.\
The Cure of Souls at Homburg.\
Accounts from Homburg state that a cabal has been raised against\
the clergyman of the English Church thereat. The Landgrave of\
Homburg probably knew what he was about when he permitted the\
erection of that Church; but he has a pecuniary interest in another\
place there, which it i3 the business of the Church to prevent people\
from going to.\
PERFIDIOUS ALBION'S LAST PERFIDY.\
The satirical Paris papers publish the following telegram as received\
from Suez :\'97\
"Intelligence from New Zealand to the 6th August, announces that the Maories,\
had made their submission, and given up their land as a token of sincerity. Hea va-\
lines had been imposed upon them."\
Here will be another count in Jacques Bonhomme's Act of Accu-\
sation against John Bull. The Maories make their submissiou to\
John, and, as a token of sincerity, resign their land to him. What\
return would.French Jacques have made them in John Bull's place?\
Grace, welcome, and the value of the land. How does John requite\
their concession? By taking the land which they have submitted to\
sell, and not only not paying them for it, but imposing heavy iiues on\
them into the bargain\'97indeed, a hard one for the Maories. Jacques\
would certainly have reason to call Jons a rascal if he were really\
responsible for such conduct as this. Why, it is almost as bad as that\
of the King of Prussia's army in Jutland.\
A VEGETABLE HAIR-DYE.\
The Paris Correspondent of the Post informs us that numerous pretty\
voung ladies are at present driving themselves about that Capital in\
basket carriages, many of them having what "we must politely call\
'golden hair.'" If Macbeth should be performed there just now, with\
Locke's music, it might be deemed expedient to omit that passage of very\
plain English, delivered by one of the witches, in contributing to the\
cauldron a certain quantity of a young lady of that description. How-\
ever, the plurality of golden-haired young ladies in Paris is, according\
to tile authority above-quoted, factitious. The hair of most of them is\
golden only in the sense of gilt. It owes that peculiar colour to the\
coiffeur. Golden hair is fashionable in the French metropolis. May\
we venture to say that carrots are in season there? In London this\
autumn they have not yet come up.\

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVART.\
QUIET WATERING-PLACES.\
No. III.\'97FRESHCHURCH.\
How it ever occurred to me to choose the Isle of Wight, I don't\
know, except, perhaps, it was at the recommendation of an old gen-\
tleman who got into the train at Chester. To him I detailed my\
miseries.\
"Why," he asked, unhesitatingly, " Why don't you go to the Isle of\
Wight?"\
Well, I couldn't answer him. Why didn't I go to the Isle of Wight?\
Why hadn't I gone there long ago? He really appeared so person-\
ally hurt by my neglect, that I felt inclined to beg his pardon; bat\
didn't.\
From my Diary.\'97I recollect having been taken to Freshchurch, in\
the Isle of Wight, at the early age of ten. The subject of our present\
memoir\'97I mean myself\'97was accompanied by his respected parents,\
who, I know, loved quiet no less than does their unhappy child. Well\
do 1 remember Freshchurch! (I make this note in the railway car-\
riage, which is joggling about from sidtfto side, most unpleasantly.) We\
lived in a pretty little cottage facing the sea, and backed by the loveliest\
scenery in the island. There was a village\'97a quiet, miniature village\
\'97whose chief feature, in my recollection, was the shop of a General\
Dealer, who, in one emporium, united the trades of butcher, baker,\
candlestick-maker, haberdasher, tailor, grocer, and, on my word, I know\
not what beside. The goods, seemed to have sympathised and inter-\
mingled their separate flavours with one another. The shop had\
a brown holland smocky-frocky-printed-calico-treacley smell, and a\
peculiar closeness of its own, which, mellowed by the presence of ground\
coffee, tallow candles, and large cheeses, produced a compound scent,\
pleasant enough, perhaps, in the nostrils of its proprietor, but slightly\
overpowering to a chance customer. Here my nurse used to buy me\
a spade and sand-boots: the former lasted me for a fortnight, the latter\
for two days. As far as 1 remember, we were the only visitors there.\
Delightfully quiet. Yes! I would get out at Southampton, and steam\
over to Freshchurch, Isle of Wight, via Ryde.\
Eyrie.\'97I find that I could have gone on in the boat to Freshchurch.\
No matter\'97I can drive over. Pretty country, if I recollect aright.\
During a walk up and down the inclined planes of Ryde streets, I come\
to the conclusion that I am the only member of the male sex on shore.\
Within my recollection I have never seen so many ladies in a town.\
And so pretty! Had some cherry-brandy at a pastrycook's. Such a\
pastrycook's! The Qaeen of Hearts! 8he made some tarts, and I had\
the pleasure of eating them! Heigho! Here is my fly, with my port-\
manteau. Away! for Freshchurch, and tranquillity! Ho! During my\
drive I congratulate myself on my admirable forethought. In years\
gone by, the Dolphin was the Inn, the small, old-fashioned hostelrie\
of Freshchurch, wherein my father used to occupy a pleasant apartment,\
"number forty." So I had sent on a letter, only yesterday, to the land-\
lord of the Dolphin, ordering " number forty" to be reserved for me.\
Freshchurch\'97 Is it, indeed? Very much altered. "Werry much\
so," says the flyman. "'Ere's the Dolphin," Then the Dolphin has\
grown pretty considerably\'97that's all I can say. And here is the Land-\
lord, who has grown very considerably; has, in fact, been changed\
altogether. Yes, I am the gent for number forty. "Take Forty's\
luggage up." A great ringing of bells. Hate bells. I wish they\
wouldn't do that on my account. Neat chambermaids flash before\
me: a muscular Boots shoulders my portmanteau, and disappears.\
The Dolphin, impersonated, and myself are at the door. What\
is that I see from here? A pier? A pier! Dear me. And people\
landing, too, from a steamboat, and other people looking at the\
people landing. "Yes," says the Dolphin, with pride, "Freshchurch is\
quite a gay place now. Gay! You don't say so! He does say so,\
however, and, what's worse, evidently speaks the truth. There are\
three steamers at the pier-head now. A bell rings. Rush of people.\
Another bell. More people running to the boat. Horrid excitement.\
Bell again. And mayl ask does that\'97ahem!\'97bell often ring F "Oh,\
yes; pretty well." What does he mean by " pretty well P" "Well,"\
the Dolphin explains, " it gives notice ten minutes afore a boat's a\
going to start: then it rings again to let passengers know as there's\
only five minutes more afore they go: then it rings\'97a good long/un\'97\
to fetch up the stragglers at the last moment: that's all." Oh, that's\
all, is it ?" Well, the look-out-man's obliged to ring when any boat's\
a-comingin." 'And are there often boats a-coming in? "Oh, mostly\
every quarter hour or so." Oh, this is charming. Gracious ! ^there's\
another bell! What's that for P "That's for the navvies to leave off\
work: it rings to bring 'em to it in the morning, and then for their\
meals during the day. "Yes, Sir," says the Dolphin. "What with\
the churches in the town, and the boats, and the workpeople, we 're\
pretty well off for bells." Yes, I should t hink they were ! \'95\
And this is Freshchurch! The romance of my boyish years has\
vanished! Now I look about me, I see there's a Marine Parade, and\
a Cliff, and a Sea-view Terrace, and a Belvedere Mansion, and all is\
green, white, glazed, bilious, vulgar, and bustling. There are\
Coastguard-men on shore, and men belonging to the Customs on the\
pier, and there's a toll-keeper with a creaking wicket-gate. I suppose\
he has a bell too, somewhere, just to ring when he's nothing better to\
do. "Will I have a goat-ctiaiseP" Pooh! go along, little boy!\
The goat has bells on its abominable harness. I wonder my landlord\
hasn't bells in his cap. P'raps he has: on Sundays. There are don-\
keys and Bath chairs; "and, my Landlord informs me," we've got an\
excellent "I stop him\'97I know what you 're going to say\'97no\
watering-place is without it\'97a Band !" Yes, that's it," he says. I\
thought so: and they play at four o'clock, don't they P "Of course."\
Ha! ha! I knew it. On the pier? "Yes." _ Naturally. This is the\
style of thing. And perhaps there's an opposition band? Eh? Don't\
tell me there isn't. I am becoming ironical. He does not tell me\
there isn't; because in fact there is. It plays in front of the Dolphin?\
*' It does!" Charming!! Glorious!!! Oh, Freshchurch, how art thou\
fallen!\
I continue my pleasantry. Are there fireworks in the evening?\
Oh dear, yes, he should think there were, rather. Oh, the Dolphin\
would think there were, rather. Eh P Very good. Rockets, and\
squibs, and wheels ?" Oh yes," says the waiter, "and a couple of\
cannon, and a Storming of Sebastopol, with a hexplosion!" A hex-\
plosion, indeed. About what time P I ask, eahnly. "Oh,'atwecn\
eleven and 'ari'-past." All! just when I like to be getting off to sleep!\
| Delightful! And of course there's a ball now and then P "A ball!\
There's one every other night at the Assembly Rooms" (Oh dear!\
i there'are Assembly Rooms, too!), " and there's a dance in the Dolphin's\
Blue Room, when there ain't (any other ball a-going on." Charming!\
And public pio-nic parties, and yachting parties, and archery meetings,\
of course ?" Oh, of oourse, lots of them," I could have sworn it.\
'And Volunteer Reviews? Eh ?" Ay, and Naval Volunteer Reviews\
and Artillery practising, too? And then there's the Trvoli Gardens,\
with a theatre, and swings, and games, and such like. Lor*, Sir," says\
the Dolphin, " you can't be dull here." Oh, no, you can't be dull: you\
can't erven sleep, I should say!" Then, once a month, there's the\
Mammoth Circus "Eb? What? No, don't say Flicxster's?\
"Yes, Flickster's." What, with little Boolu, Blue Beard, and the\
Elephants ?" That 'a it. Do I know it P" Do I? Was I not driven\
away from Winklebeaeh by it? "Well, they'll be here to-morrow\
morning." Will they? Then my resolution is taken. "They come\
always.it appears, about race time." Race time? Yes, the Dolphin\
informs me that in his opinion I am rather in luck's way, as I've just\
arrived when the horse races and yachting matches are beginning.\
"The Jockeys and Sporting gents arrived this afternoon. They always\
patronises the Dolphin. Rather lucky as you ordered your room in\
time, Sir," observes the waiter, "as number forty was sure to be taken.\
Dinner, Sir? Yes, Sir; there's honly a hordinary at six." I abominate\
public dining. "Well, I could have it after the gents was done! But\
we always does a hordinary\'97a tarbul don't as they calls it\'97during race\
week." The waiter wouldn't recommend, he says, my dining after the\
gents was done, as there, perhaps, wouldn't be much left, and that not\
very hot. Cheery prospect! I '11 think over the matter. "It's\
quarter-past five now, Sir." Very well, I '11 dine at the "hordinary."\
Now to my room. 1 '11 sleep here to-night, if the bells and the fire-\
works '11 let me, and by the first boat to-morrow morning I'm off, or\
I '11 know the reason why.\
"Number forty, Sir? Yes, Sir. Chambermaid, show Forty to his\
room." "This way, Sir." Rather small this room, eh? "It's the\
oldpart of the house, Sir." And, dear me, a smell of stables, I fancy,\
"Well; it may be," she says. Why so ?" Because\'97in fact, the\
stables are just underneath." Oh, indeed!" Yes, Sir, the racers have\
got 'em, now and the jockeys." Well, I '11 have another room. "Can't\
change now, Sir, as we 're quite full. AU the rooms is taken during\
the race week." Hang the race week! Number forty ain't used as a\
bed-room generally, it seems; being appropriated to harness. "We\
only gives this usually to the Trainers, or such like gents, as likes to\
'ave an eye on the 'orses." Yes, but I'm not a trainer, nor a gent as\
likes to 'ave "No, Sir, but you sent word on as we was to\
keep number forty specially for yon." Ah! so I did. Pleasant.\
6 p.m.\'97Alarm bell rings. Goodness! Fire ?" No, Sir, it's the\
hordinary." I am ready.\
"DistingUO."\'97 Patcal.\
Lunching with7 Cardinal Wiseman, the other day, Mr. Punch\
observed,\
"We are restoring all the old Cathedrals, you see, Eminence."\
"Are you?" says his Eminence. "We haven't received any."\
We applauded his wit, and tben read him a hundred pages of the\
Boole of the Church, to prove to the brilliant Catholic that though he\
thought he had us, he hadn't.\
DANGEROUS.\
Caution.\'97The other day, a lady, while stooping over her Sewing-\
machine, suddenly got a most painful stitch in her side.\

THE "PUGS" ON PAT.\
RA TELLERS, with\
their impres-\
sions" and "recol-\

most abominable\
of social nui-\
sances. It is a\
miserable thing to\
sit at dinner near\
anybody who has\
anywhere,\
has not the\
good manners to\
suppose that you\
are as well-in-\
formed as himself.\
The secret revenge\
which you can\
always take, by\
inventing scenery,\
and asking him\
whether he does\
not recollect it,\
and of enjoying\
his lying assent, is\
something, but\
even this amuse-\
ment becomes a\
bore. But when\
a new type of tra-\
veller gets for the\
first time into new\
scenes, his notes\
thereof have a\
freshness and\
value. The Lon-\
don pugilists went to Ireland the other day to attend a fight, which was\
prevented, either by the police, or because a Mr. Coburn was afraid of\
being outrageously licked by a Mr. Mace. The gentlemen of the\
Ring took their literary gents with them, and one of them. has this\
to say about Dublin:\'97\
"Tho gentlcmon whom we met wcro quick, apprehonsive, and cultivated, and\
the ladies pretty, soft-eyed, and graced by a degree of refinement and modesty, aa a\
rule, not to be seen evon in England\'97that garden of girls. The car-drivers, tho\
\
tlieir appearance to tho streets of London or Paris, would be thrashed twice a-day\
for their filth and perfect indifference to modern civilities. The priests saunter\
abroad, fat, sly, and hypocritical; and, in fact, Dublin, viewed at an off-glanco from\
the streets, has the most unpleasant appearance."\
These impressions of a newly discovered metropolis are instructive,\
and we specially delight in the muscular Christian's declaration, that as\
matter of course his . friends would thrash car-drivers if they did not\
mend their manners. As regards the priests, we are not sure that the\
healthy eye of a literary fighting, gent may not have judged these\
gentry accurately, but there may be a spice, of ill-feeling in the sketch,\
as Paul Ccllen, one of the Irish priests, wrote a letter against the\
fight, and was ratlier severely reprimanded in our columns last week by\
the gladiator who meant fighting. However, we conserve the descrip-\
tion, as it is written in a better style than most of the twaddling, senti-\
mental, "graphic" sketches by modern travellers.\
THE THEEYES' CONGRESS.\
\{From our own Reporter.)\
Prigsborough, Tuesday Afternoon.\
INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 1\
The Inaugural Discourse of the Associated Thieves' first great\
Annual Meeting was delivered by the President, Ma. Patter. He\
dwelt at some length on the analogies subsisting between theft and\
industry as practised in business and the learned professions, and on\
the mutual relations between* the Barrister and the Prisoner at the bar.\
Having observed that the practice of holding annual conferences was\
becoming adopted by all great communities with interests of their own\
to defend, Mr. Patter showed the expediency of adopting the same\
custom on the part of the predatory profession. He pointed out the\
necessity of combination and organisation to meet the growing anta-\
gonism of Society, and concluded by recommending his hearers to hang\
together.\
THE TREADMILL.1\
Mr. Takeaway then read a paper on the Treadmill, which he de-\
nounced in strong language. Relating his own experience of unpro-\
ductive labour, be said he felt like a blessed! squirrel in a cage. The\
pillory had been done away with, and why not this here inwention,\
which was ekally a disgrace to the hage P They should try to get up a\
Eetition agin it to Parliament among the benevolists and philanthropic\
eggars.\
THE CRANK.\
The abovenamed engine afforded a handle to Mr. Twitch, who com-\
plained that it was stiff work. He objected to the definition given by\
the scientific gentlemen commissioned to report on prison discipline of\
hard labour, as an amount of exertion sufficient to quicken the respi-\
ration and open the pores." He didn't like sitch hirony. Why did\
they not write plain English, blow 'em!\
OAKUM-PICKTNO.\
A short but indignant protest against oakum-picking was delivered\
by Mr. Picksey. He saia that it ruined the fingers.\
THE REDUCED DIETARY.\
Mr. Robbtns gave a minute account of the alterations for the worse\
which had lately been made in the diet-scale of her Majesty's gaols,\
which he had deplored, representing the present prison-allowance of\
nutriment as "werry BANTiN-isin'."\
i\
MECHANICAL'APPARATUS.\
Mr. Looty exhibited a recently-invented jemmy and centre-bit, and\
some skeleton-keys; also a new and ingenious contrivance for picking\
pockets.\
THE PUNISHMENT OP WHIPPING.\
This sore subject was pathetically enlarged upon by Mr. Slink, in a\
discourse which created painful interest. He feelingly expressed the\
deep disgust with which he was compelled to acknowledge that the lash\
had nearly put a stop to garotting. The success which had thus\
attended whipping would, he sadly feared, lead to its extension to other\
offences, to larceny perhaps, or even swindling. Very likely indeed an\
Act of Parliament next Session would award that 'orrid punishment to\
a poor cove who honly tried to frishten a rich old Swell out of a little\
blunt by threatening to accuse him of so-and-so. The statement of this\
apprehension was received with sensation and cries of "Shame!"\
"Oh, oh!" and "No Punishment!"\

TOO CLEVER BY HALF!\

[NATIONAL THEATRE, DENMARK.\
UNDER, THE MANAGEMENT OP MESSRS. FATHERLAND AND FUDGE.\
The New German Flay of " THE ROBBERS."\
This barbarous Play, which surpasses Titus Andronicus in incidental\
horrors, has recently been brought out at the National Theatre, Den-\
mark, by Messrs. Fatherland and Fudge, in open violation of then-\
licence. It is not our present intention to scrutinise the performance,\
which was simply execrable. Let it suffice that it received what it\
merited, an indignant storm of hisses from an audience embracing the\
most distinguished\'97and we may add without flattery\'97the coolest\
critics in Europe.\
The policy of Fatherland and Fudge, in offering this insult to\
public feeling, is quite indefensible. Speaking not too figuratively,\
these unprincipled speculators have drawn a check to serve pressing\
exigencies, and which may eventually result in a run upon the banks of\
the Rhine. When this catastrophe does occur, Fatherland will find\
himself obliged to shut up, and be glad once more to draw small beer at\
the sign of the Spread Eagle.\
If evidence were required to prove the demoralising influence of the\
Continental Drama, the German Play of The Robbers might be called\
into court, and a conviction obtained without further trouble. The\
London apprentice, we are often solemnly assured, has been tempted\
to try his band at petty larceny from studiously surveying some stage\
culprit's success in that peculiar branch of economy. Sanguine youths\
emulating their pattern hero in a fringed cocked-hat and jack-boots,\
have, we learn, broken open their master's safe, eloped with his\
daughter, plundered the King's Mail, and evaporating from limbo, to\
which they have been transient ly consigned, have reduced demented\
turnkeys to despair and want. It this be so, are not heads notoriously\
weak about their crowns being turned the wrong way by such a triumph\
as that of which Fatherland and Fudge so insolently boast?\
Some time ago Fatheriand got up a heavy burlesque upon John\
Bull's celebrated "Constitution," which, during its short run,\
certainly provoked considerable laughter. Here Fatherland might have\
paused in serene contemplation ol his green bays; but, no! he panted\
for a tremendous "hit" upon a deeper stage, and with additional\
properties. In partnership with Fudge (an Austrian Dragoon, and\
one whose antecedents will not bear investigation), the German play\
of The Robbers has accordingly been produced on an extensive scale,\
and supported by a company who despise Hamlet's well-known\
injunction, and perpetrate every possible outrage upon humanity. One\
word as to these wretched strollers. When inspired by Bacchus they\
may be heard shouting in praise of that old rheumatic creature their\
Father, and shedding tears of filial devotion over their sauer-kraut. It\
is with actors of this stamp that Fatherland and Fudge have pro-\
duced a sanguinary sort of Coburg drama, which is justly pronounced a\
disgrace to the European stage, while aspiring to rank with that for\
which these men are such sensitive sticklers\'97the Legitimate Drama!\
It is consolatory to reflect that no applause has greeted The Robbers\
but that which professional claqueurs have been regularly paid for.\
Conscious of their high calling, their minions have from the gallery\
lavished their cheers with impartial fidelity on both their patrons; for\
it has been found, and is worthy of note, that the impassioned advo-\
cates of Fatherland are invariably the ardent admirers of Fudge.\
One Who Wrote before his Time.\
It is very curious that the two masterpieces of Aristophanes should\
have slyly alluded to two great reigning powers of the present day.\
We refer to the Clouds and the Frogs. The Clouds were intended, of\
course, for the Germans, whose habitual dwelling-places they are; whilst\
the Frogs could clearly have been meant for no other nation than our\
good neighbours, the French; for even with us, at this remote period\
of time, the name of a Frenchman and a Frog, curiously enough,\
always jump together. You rarely meet with a writer gifted with so\
much foresight.\

\
HOW TO TALK TO THE FARMERS.\
E thought that Mr. Disraeli\
had done about the boldest\
thing he ever attempted in the\
course of his life, when he pre-\
sumed to address a meeting of\
British Farmers in a cheerful\
strain, aud to assure them that\
they were not utterly ruined.\
In fact, we considered that the\
right honourable gentleman\
had pretty well done for him-\
self by launching such an in-\
sult at his friends, and that he\
must be intending to abdicate\
in favour of some Oppositionist\
who has a finer sense of what\
is due to the trampled and op-\
pressed B. F. A nice hornet s\
nest he has got himself into\
by his indiscretion. But in\
case the author of Coningsby\
should once more venture him-\
self in the presence of a bu-\
colic audience, we recommend\
him to study the following\
Model Speech, composed with\
a view to the tastes of the\
melancholy agriculturists:\'97\
Gentlemen,\
Yes, let me repeat, Gen-\
tlemen, for when we have lost\
everything else, gentility re-\
mains to console us. It is\
with great melancholy pleasure\
that I rise to propose the next\
toast, if indeed it be not a\
mockery to wreathe the flowing bowl when the cup of sorrow is so full. I will not\
add to your afflictions by describing them at any length. The British Farmer is\
indeed, in the poet's language,\'97\
"The child of misery, baptised in tears,"\
and Cobden and Bright are his scowling godfathers, while Free Trade is his cruel\
godmother. There is no comfort for him, for, much as 1 desire to show you some\
little bit of blue in the dark sky, I dare not predict that the Corn Laws will be\
re-imposed in the coming Session. Still, you must remember that you are English-\
men, I know, alas! too well, your sorrows and privations. I have heard of\
farmers who have felt it their duty to deny themselves port wine at more than\
eighty shillings, and I have within the last few days been told a harrowing story\'97\
no, I am in no mood for jest, and I do not allude to the harrow that tears your\
clods\'97a story of an agriculturist who has been compelled to buy an upright piano-\
forte instead of a grand, for the faithful and sorrowing wife of his bosom. Other\
grievous tales of distress have reached me, but 1 hesitate to narrate them. I know\
of my own knowledge that men ;who have been accustomed to hunt five days in\
the week now often hunt but three: and that others have been reduced to shoot\
but four times where they used to shoot six. In my own parish a farmer whose\
daughters have been accustomed to be instructed in singing by a fashionable\
Professor who came down from London, has intimated to the poor girls that in\
future they must be content with the ministrations of a circuinambulant musician of\
the Hebrew persuasion, and, though you will hardly believe it, the saddened father\
was obliged to deny himself the happiness of taking them up to town for the first\
night of Mosanielto. But I will not accumulate such instances. I know that\
they will arise to the individual recollections of each and all of you. But again 1\
say, remember that you are Englishmen, and bear your grief in manly silence. I\
do not say that better times will come, but worse cannot. It is something to be at\
the bottom of the abyss of our sufferings. If I hint to you that there is a shadowy\
possibility of happiness, do not think that I seek to moek affliction. But, in spite of\
the dastardly and spiritless conduct of our rulers, in spite of their resolution to hu-\
miliate the once great name and honour of England, in order that shopkeepers\
may revel in their usurious and wicked gains, events may be too strong for the\
cowards, and War may break out. I do not say that I see it looming in the\
distance, but we never know what good thing is coming to us from the hand of\
Providence. A. collision between t wo fiery sea officers may bring on a quarrel\
at any moment; a reckless and insolent dcspatcli from a petulant Foreign Minister\
may rupture the hypocritical ties that unite us with an ancient enemy. Then once\
more famine prices may gladden your hearths, and again the British Farmer, the\
true lord and ornament of the soil, may be rewarded for his now unrecognised\
labours. But we must not be sanguine, for unhappily the national mind has been\
debauched, and the people have been taught to connect the ideas of "peace and\
happiness"\'97the compilers of our otherwise meritorious Liturgy are partly re-\
sponsible for this error, aud I could wish that the Episcopal Bench would purge\
our Prayer-book of those incessant petitions for peace. Gentlemen, I will not\
longer dwell on the story of your wrongs, or on the faint chance of their being\
redressed, but it is with a voice which trembles with sup-\
pressed emotion that I call on you to drink the toast, and\
it is with eyes dimmed with unbidden tears that I looks\
to-wards you as you drink it\'97I give you " the Memory of\
Protection."\
EAYTHER TOO COOL.\
Oor Gladstone is an orator\
To talk a dog's hind leg off,\
Or from a mastiff's hungry jaw\
A pound of butter beg off\'97\
But not e'en Gladstone's skill can make,\
A credit of a scandal; \'95\
Or out of facts that raise a blush,\
For self-praise twist a handle.\
He's free to sing the spread of trade,\
Blazon commercial glories,\
And set down to Whig credit all\
Whereof he mulcts the Tories;\
To laud King Cotton, through each\
In future, past, and present\'97\
E'en if some facts he's fain to blink,\
Because they 're aught but pleasant.\
But when he tells us how John Bull\
Has won a proud position,\
Maintaining he has in the world\
A mere commercial mission;\
How out of Continental pies\
We've but to keep our digits,\
To win the foreigner's respect,\
And save our trade from fidgets,\
Wc feel an itching to demur\
At thoughts of Denmark, Pol\
Of John Boll viewed askance by\
With warm allies in no land.\
Profit and loss account may stand\
Better for such abstention;\
But, sure respect is scarce the gain\
We owe non-intervention.\
\'95\
Or if this be respect that's felt\
In Austria or Prussia,\
France, Denmark, Poland, Italy,\
The Duchies, Greece or Russia,\
Where England now all laugh to scorn,\
Who once at England trembled,\
Sure never yet was seen respect\
That so contempt resembled!\
"Take care of number one" may be\
Pole-star for course commercial,\
But there are lights beyond the ken\
Of trading Rosse orMERSCHEL.\
Henceforth if shopmen's rules must guide\
The Council of t he nation,\
The principle should be avowed\
Of c\'ab\'ab\'bbter-irritation.\
The fruits of such a principle\
We seem to see about us,\
In nations that vituperate,\
Distrust, despise, and flout us.\

portraits of Mr. Gladstone were taken the other day by\
Mr. M'Lachlan, at that city. The best place, however,\
for taking a negative portrait of the Chancellor or the\
Exchequer would be the right honourable gentleman's\
official residence in Downing Street, the time being tbat\
of his reply to a deputation inviting him to reduce\

and after an equally lengthy statement of the vacuities which he calls\
prospects, that have been shut out, as he complains, by bricks and\
mortar in the shape of manufacturing works and new hotels, this old\
Dodo makes the following brutal suggestion:\'97" To the end of preserving\
somewhat, on account of the lovers of Nature, and for the sustenance of\
the poetic faculty and the spiritual mind amongst us, I propose that a\
compromise should be struck with the utilitarian proclivity of the age.\
by transferring, to the most beautiful portions of British scenery still\
remaining, the various powder-mills and magazines. Thcv could be so\
planted as not to obstruct the eye of the beholder; and after recent\
experience it may be hoped that they would create a solitude all around\
them of a radius sufficiently long to coyer and protect a considerable\
extent of beautiful country. The objection that this arrangement would\
tend to discourage gipsying parties and pic-nics would not perhaps be\
entitled to much weight, even if it could be sustained, which it cannot,\
since people who have the courage to travel by excursion-trains would\
never be deterred from going where they might eat, and drink, and\
dance, by the remote chance of an explosion." ,\
Our Dodo is one of those slow old coaches who can't keep pace with\
these railroad times. He refuses to go with the stream, complaining,\
by_the Way, that the rivers are discoloured and the fish destroyed by\
the sewage of towns and the refuse of the chemical works which con-\
tribute so largely to our luxury. He won't accept the situation which\
the inexorable logic of material utilitarianism imposes on him, and he\
refuses to acknowledge that the old English fancies about the "merry\
greenwood" and that sort of thing are all bosh.\

THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES,\
(From Our Own Correspondent.)\
Like the bald eagle soaring in majesty above the clouds, when\
our free and enlightened Republic, once more united, has riz into\
a gigantic Empire, don't you suppose we 're a-goin to take up with the\
cast-off liveries of Europe. No; we mean to have a flunkeydom of our\
own; we do. We will have our cocked hats worn fore and hind, and\
our shoulder-knots between the shoulders. Our plush shall be all\
striped and spangled with stars. Our coats shall be braided with\
platinum and aluminium lace, our hair-powder shall be made of- maize;\
and our footmen's calves shall be as big again as any of yourn.\
Our Emperor shall'have a Lord High Valet instead of Chamberlain.\
He shall also have a Lord High Boots. In place of a Mistress of the\
Robes we will give our Empress a Mistress of the Crinoline. The\
Court of Washington shall be attended with Ostlers in Waiting, not\
Grooms. For your Master of the Horse we will have a Manager of\
the Circus, Gals of Giory for Maids of Honour, and Hossbreakers for\
Equerries. And if we don't altogether eclipse, extinguish, and utterly\
stump out your old outworn effete Royalty with our go-ahead rampant,\
roaring, Imperial splendor, it's a pity.\
PICKPOCKETS. \'97 Numerous robberies constantly taking place at\
Spirit Seances, when the lights are extinguished, the police advise persons\
attending such performances to pick their own pockets in their dressing-rooms\
before going. Scotland Yard.\
ARNING.\'97The lady who seized and detained the Hand which was\
placing a wreath on her head at Herr Von Caouostro's, on Wednesday night,\
is known, and if she does not restore it, without saying anything to anybody, and\
with the machinery uninjured, revelations which the Spirits have made about her\

THE GHOST OF MOZART will be called up at the Musical Phantom\

strong hysterics from the Apparition Hall, last Saturday, will say nothing of\
what she stated during her excitement. There was some mistake\'97her brother was\
not drowned, as alleged by the Spirits, but has returned with a wife and many\
nuggets. Clara.\
DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP.\'97The partnership heretofore\
existing between Endor Trick and Grimm Diddi.br, Spiritualists, has been'\
dissolved by consent of Mr. Josticr Stern*, who has sentenced the former to seven\
years and a flogging, and the latter to the Siberian Penal Settlement for life.\

Two Corrections.\
Mr. Punch proposes to kill two birds with one stone. A paragraph\
of dramatic criticism which he cited, with plaudit, last week, originally\
appeared in one of the able theatrical articles in the London Review, and\
were that excellent journal as fortunate in its selection of miscellaneous\
information as it is in its dramatic critic, it would not have given cur-\
rency to a ridiculous story of offence alleged to have been taken by Us\
at a diverting statement by our admired friend, Richard Burton, to\
whom we now drink in a nip of his namesake, in testimony that we were\
heartily amused with ours.\

PITY THE SOBEOWS OF A POOB OLD-BISHOP.\
I'm an elderly prelate, well up on the Bench-\
Not a mere novus homo like Thomson or Trench\'97\
I belong to the good easy-going old times,\
When Inquiry was heresy. Doubt worst of crimes.\
When to drift with the tide and take things as they came,\
And stand on old ways, was th' episcopal game.\
When a man of good blood, and sound views, in priest's orders,\
Found a liberal profession and liberal rewarders;\
When a Bishop was never seen out of his wig;\
When his lawn-sleeves were ample, his revenues big;\
When a seat on the Bench if one's way one could win to,\
There was no mean Commission one's rents to pry into\'97\
Heaven knows what might now be our abject position,\
If the Bench were not pretty strong on the Commission! \\\
Then the Bench was a place of Bight-Keverend repose,\
Whereon round, smooth, and stout, we church-pillars arose;\
We might not be strenuous, but we were solid\'97\
Nay, some of us, p'raps, may have verged upon stolid\'97\
But their function, I take it, the mitre that don,\
Is to stand, not to stir, to maintain, not move on.\
You may whip Peers through school, edit Greek plays at College,\
But you 're bound to scout Progress and snub useful knowledge.\
These Conservative duties we nobly discharged,\
And no one can say we the Church-pale enlarged:\
Hooker, Pearson, and Bull, summed our stock of Theology,\
We pooh-poohed the Germans, and smiled at Geology,\
None then heard that vile dogma, which holds all sins' seeds,\
"Honest doubt has more faith in't than half of the creeds!"\
But now-a-days storm-tossed is every see,\
Say, "Good bye, peace of mind!" you that Bishops would be:\
As for quiet and ease, they are dreams of the past,\
Now even Church-pillars are asked to move fast.\
What with all sorts of heretics, printing and gabbling,\
Theologists, nationalists, Socialists squabbling\'97\
And, as if such outsiders had not enough vexed us,\
Here's a Bishop (Colonial, 'tis true) loose on Exodus!\
Then one's friends who'd defend from the foes who've attacked oae,\
Display an activity fit to distract one\'97\
Show all sorts of new lights, raise all sorts of vexed questions \'97\
Convocations and Congresses, schemes and suggestions,\
Till, a real Church militant, all seem at strife,\
And a Bishop is doomed to "hard labour for Efe."\
We are poked up to cut out Neology's cancer:\
To condemn's not enough, they expect us to answer.'\
When heretics argue 'tis tee must oppose 'em,\
And, besides opening questions, we 're called on to close 'em.\
And all for a stipend that barely affords\
A subsistence for one who takes rank with the Lords.\
While one can't give a living to son or relation,\
But the Press bawls out "nepotism" all through the nation.\
Sidney Smith made a joke how Fejee soon would vary\
Its diet of bread-fruit with cold Missionary\'97 *\
And the practice that loose canon thus shrined his wit in\
Has spread, in an awfuller form, to Great Britain-\
Till for popular carving no meat you can dish up\
So sure to be relished all round, as roast Bishop '.,\
Quite Accounts for it.\
Among the names included in the Proclamation of Outlawry, made\
by that well-known officer, who bears the ominous name of" Hemp," on\
Wednesday last, we find that of "Easterly Rains." This fully accounts\
for the late dry weather.\

TESTS OF "MEDIUMSHIP."\
Mb. Punch,\
In all the letters which have been published, detailing the per-\
formances of the Brothers Davenport, the following statement has\
been unaccountably omitted:\'97\
"Caix-kai t was then introduced, and the Messrs. Datekport underwent the\
process of being pinioned, at the hands of that experienced operator."\
Of course the Davenports are prepared to stand the test of trying to\
undo bonds fastened for them by the eminent artist above-named. They\
will willingly submit to be put to that test, and, if they cannot undo\
those bonds, will confess themselves undone.\
There is a further knot which Mr. Calcraft could tie for the Daven-\
ports: and to convince you that they really do untie ropes by preter-\
natural agency, they will have not the least objection to let him tie it\
for them, and tie them up altogether in the Old Bailey, which would\
either enable them to prove their pretensions, or, they admit, would\
serve them right.\
In the meantime, I may confidently state, that if certain professed\
Mediums, having been committed to prison under the Vagrant Act.\
together with myself, were placed in the cellular van handcuffed, ana\
there shut up, our handcuffs would be found unfastened when we had\
reached the end of our journey at the House of Correction.\
I am, &c,\
Ferguson.\
P.S. As an experienced Spiritualist, I can vouch for the fact that it\
is quite possible for a Medium to make the treadmill go without\
stepping on it.\

TWA GOWKS AT GLASGLE.\
Mb. Richard Weaver, formerly a pugilist, having been converted\
to some species of Dissent, has turned preacher, now thumps the pulpit\
instead of punching antagonists' heads, and, having ceased to pound\
the human face divine, expounds divinity. According to a Scotch paper,\
a soirie was given the other evening to Mb. Weaves, at Glasgow,\
where he "has just completed a'revival engagement.'" No sparring,\
controversial or fistic, appears to have taken place on this occasion; but\
a certain Rev. Mb. Howie, of the Wynd Free Church, in the course of\
some remarks which may or may not have been altogether foolish and\
impertinent, referring to a speech which Lord Ardmillan had made\
on proposing the memory of Burns at the Ayrshire Society's banquet,\
declared that "he should like to know what good the productions of\
that poet could possibly effect amongst those living in the wynds and\
alleys of Glasgow." It would be difficult to match this observation\
exactly in respect of wisdom; but Mr. Weaver did it. He followed\
Mr. Howie in an address, wherein he said that "he did not wish to\
be told of a Shakspeabe or a 'Bobby Burns,' but he did like to be\
spoken to concerning a Knox or a Lutheb." As for Luther, it is\
not easy to imagine what peculiar interest Mr. Weaves can take in\
him. One can hardly suppose that the great German Reformer had\
much to do with Mb. Weaveb's reformation. But as an ex-bruiser,\
and an illiterate person, who does not wish to be told of Burns or\
Shakspeabe. and whose ideas of orthography are likely to be hazy, it\
is conceivable that Mb. Dice Weaver may venerate the name of\
Knox.\
Howie and Weaver being so closely alike as the nonsense above\
quoted from their respective mouths proves them to be, let some com-\
petent Scottish sculptor sacrifice them to the insulted manes of Scot-\
land's poet by representing one of them as Tarn o'Shanler and the other\
as Souier Johnnie. Mr. Howie could scarcely be represented as a\
Shakspearian fool; but his friend Dick might be portrayed as Bottom\
the Weaver.\
Ecclesiastical News.\
Three youths have been fined at Clerkenwell, for bringkig fireworks\
into a church. Brother Ignatius has nobly offered to pay the fine if the\
articles were Roman Candles.\
THE ROAD TO RUIN.\
America is always lamenting that she has no ruins. In an Empire\
so young, a building that has numbered its sixty or seventy years, is\
looked upon with quite an antiquarian interest. In fact, they have no\
Tintern Abbey, no Roslyn Castle, no Stonehenge, no Westminster\
Abbey, not an ancient cathedral, scarcely a venerable old mansion.\
Everything is new, as though the bricklayer had left it only yesterday.\
However, let not America despair! The want she deplores may soon\
be supplied. Let the North and South but persevere in fighting in the\
same fratricidal manner, and we will warrant that before many years\
have flown over the head of the Liberty that so Haunt insly stands on\
the top of the Capitol at Washington, America will be able to show\
the largest ruin in the world\'97we mean, no less a ruin than that of her\
model Constitution. There will be nothing to be seen like it since the\
days of Ancient Rome. Were Volney alive, he would write a series\
of philosophical chapters upon so stupendous a theme for the next\
edition of his celebrated "Burnet, ou Meditations sur let Revolutions des\
Empires"\
Happy Land!\
In Japan, political functionaries have a penetrating sense of respon-\
sibility. A Member convicted of corruption, loses no time in ousting\
himself to avoid cutting sarcasms from the law officers of the Tycoon.\
Ministers escape a deadly blow from the Opposition, by directing one\
at their body corporate, and a Foreign Secretary atones for his diplo-\
matic miscarriages by a "Happy Despatch."\

hare Parliament\
summoned at once.\
Don't talk to us.\
The Act for shut-\
ting the Haymarket\
dens and other\
houses of rascality\
at one in the morn-\
ing was all right\
enough, but who\
dreamed that it\
would affect Paddy\
Green's P The idea\
is monstrous. Why,\
not only is nothing\
wrong ever said or\
done there, not only\
might Marchionesses\
sit in the gallery\
(we believe they do)\
and hear all that goes\
on, but that Hall is\
a school, a place of\
instruction. With\
his own royal ears\
has Mr. Punch heard\
Horace's "Integer\
vita" delightfully\
sung there as a quar-\
tette, and heartily\
applauded. Is that\
the sort of work to\
be stopped by a law\
intended to put down\
profligacy P Bother, bosh! People may say that theoretically one in\
the morning is time for one to be going home, and so it is, theoretically;\
but.while composers make Operas that play till 12'45, how are you to\
get to supper m Covent Garden, and get it over and have your weed,\
by one P Again we say bother and bosh. It is a duty to go very often\
to Mr. Green's: first, because it is a pleasant haunt; and secondly,\
because he is like Abdiel, faithful alone among the faithless found j that\
is to say, he alone excludes objectionable songs and objectionable\
society. But the duty cannot be completely discharged while the one\
o'clock rule is enforced. An exception must be made in favour of\
Evans' late joys. We dare say that when the Home Secretary sees\
this, he will write to Paddy Green, and desire him to violate the law\
whenever convenient, and that he, the Home Secretary, will send\
him a cheque for any penalties that may be inflicted. But that is an\
irregular way of doing business, and the first task for the next Session\
must be the Evans' Emancipation Act.\

QUIET WATEBENG-PLACES.\
No. III.\'97FRESHCHURCH (Contisokd).\
After the Ordinary\'97With an extraordinary attack of dyspepsia.\
Have I ever dined with Bears? I never had that pleasure; probably\
if the chance were afforded me, the Bears would dine, and I shouldn't.\
I here merely record the fact that such a set of Bears, as sat down to\
the "hordinary" at the Dolphin, Freshchurch, I never met. "Nevar,\
Nev-ar, iVsy-var!" as Mr. J. B. Buckstone would emphatically de-\
clare, with a distension of cheek and a shaking of head, irresistible.\
: How they did eat! and in what a fashion! I really felt inclined to warn\
'one closely-cropped gentleman against so rash a mode of using the knife,\
! as that in which he was indulging. Judging, from one or two of his\
remarks, which were somewhat of the unnecessarily-strongest, that\
he was not the sort of person to take a stranger's interference in\
good part, 1 restrained myself, and trembled for his safety. An\
accidental twist of the knife, one shoe either to the right or the left,\
and there is no knowing what amount of food, this already capacious\
mouth might have, at one and the same time, accommodated. I could\
not choose but watch him; and, watching, saw the knife sliding about\
the very edge of this elastic crater, and in the midst of beans and bacon\
paused in horror. These gentlemen generally seemed to be rather\
partial to an approach to the raw material in their victuals. The cook\
j knew their palates, evidently. He, or she, had left undone everything\
that ought to have been done; and he, or she, was a sinner above all\
others, in consequence: hence my dyspepsia; hence this note, writ\
immediately after the bear-fight. There were only two waiters to\
twenty-five or thirty guests, and this pair attended, specially, to three\
or four very horsey-looking gents, tight in the trousers, stiff is the neck,\
red in the hands, with a ring, a pin, or af,watch-chain of such an unobtrusive\
character, as to attract your attention some seconds before you had\
connected these phenomena with their exhibitor. They scrambled for\
greens, they dashed with knives, spoons and forks, at potatoes;\
they shoved the salt about anyhow, and pulled the mustard-pot away\
from one another, without a word of apology. While yet then- mouths\
were full, they would have asked for more, Dut utterance being impos-\
sible, they ingeniously knocked the backs of their knives against the\
tumblers, to imitate a bell, and thereby summon the attendant. The\
waiter, having evidently his master's interest at heart, oune when he\
chose, and didn't come when he didn't choose, which latter case\
happened once in every three calls.\
8 o'clock.\'97More bells than ever on the pier. I am told it is the last\
boat coining in. I think I shall walk on to the pier, and rejoice over\
the last boat. Crowds on the promenade. I will avoid the promenade\
and affect the pier, which I see is less frequented, just now, than 'twas\
a few minutes since. It is twopence to go on to the pier. Well, two-\
pence is not dear for peace and quietude. The toll-taker stares at\
me. Why not P perhaps he can't help it. Yes, here I can walk alone,\
and view the broad expanse of waters. Nothing save the Blue, the\
Fresh, the Ever Free beyond the pier-head, except\'97" Teo heo! Teo\
heo!" Hullo! what's that? Nautical sounds. Sailors landing at\
the pier-head. Smugglers, p'raps. No! Yachtsmen. They are lugging\
something up. Can't tbey do it without all that noise r What are\
these people doing? Will I "bear a hand" with a pole t No.\
Then I'd better "get out." I get out accordingly, and ask the toll-\
taker what is going to happen. The Mayor and the pier-authorities,\
it appears, have granted permission for an alfresco dance on the pier, to\
be given by the yachtsmen. "It '11 be a pretty sight." Will itf But\
it way rain? Yes: that's one comfort, it may rain, and that'll stop\

it has begun everywhere else. In the hotel, out of the hotel, on the\
promenade, on the pier. I am getting accustomed to the sound, and\
shall go to bed. The bells are at it again. Talking of bells, I will ring\
and ask at what time the first boat starts in the morning. Dear me,\
where it the bell P There is not such a thing. I should say that this is\
the only room in Freshchurch without one. No matter, I '11 call.\

here's some one. "Did I want anything?" Did IP yes I do. The\
boat starts it seems at seven in the morning. "There's sure to be\
some one up at that time." Very good. To bed.\
11. \'97Not asleep. The noise won't let me. Music everywhere. When\
I say music, I judge that it it music when you are close to it, and take\
each band separately. But, from my position, a conglomeration of\
sounds reaches me, peculiarly unmelocuous.\

at everything else.\

my candle, and give it up as a bad job.\

and scuffling. Why can't they go to bed, without scuffling P How-\
ever, that they do go to bed at all, is a thing for which one must be\
thankful.\
2. \'97Now I shall sleep. Hullo! Somebody comes into my room. A\
gentleman, in evening dress, carrying a candle, I start up and say,\
"Hullo!" He will apologise and retire. Nothing of the sort. He\
walks up to me, holds the candle unsteadily before me, smiles and\
shakes his head. He is drunk; and, with a candle, dangerous. He\
wants to show me how the fireworks are done. I object, and request\
him to leave the room. Where's my bell P Oh, I forgot, there isn't\
one. He tells me, in an idiotic fashion, that I am a jolly good fellow,\
and then makes a miserable attempt to give the same sentiment\
musically. I ask him politely why he doesn't go to his room P He says,\
"this is his room." I point to the fact of my being here, as nega-\
tiving his assertion. He says, indistinctly, that he's very glad to see\
me; and "allssshallbeverglad to see me." He means that he shall\
always be very glad to see me. For my part, I don't care if I never set\
eyes on him again. He takes a seat, and shakes his head at his boots,\
in a reproachful manner. What on earth am I to do? Hi! Somebody\
else at the door. Another gentleman in evening dress. Also intoxi-\
cated? No. He apologises for the intoxicated person, who, he says,\
is his friend, and then, with some difficulty\'97owing to the inebriated\
person's still existing desire to show me, practically, how the fireworks\
are done\'97removes him.\
3. \'97I will now sleep; and at seven good bye to Freshchurch.\

A DOUBTFUL RECOMMENDATION.\
When they preach a sermon, parsons very often say too much: but\
here even in an advertisement is a specimen of clerical redundancy of\
language:\'97\
TO the RESIDENTS OF MAYFAIR A young clergyman, -who\
mixes in society, is desirous of being received into a house, where two or three\
rooms could be placed at his disposal He seeks an introduction to some lady or\
gentleman, in this neighbourhood, whose house may bo larger than required.\
Address, ate.\
We do not quite see the advantage for a man who wants some\
lodgings to recommend himself by saying that he "mixes in Society,"\
for the phrase provokes a question as to what sort of society it is in\
which he mixes, and what sort of drink it is that he is accustomed there\
to mix. A man who mixed, say, gin-and-water in the society of Shore-\
ditch, would hardly be allowed to mix a sherry-cobler in that about\
Mayfair. So if this young parson fails to fiad his advertisement assist\
him to the lodgings he requires, we think he may assign bis failure\
somewhat to the doubtful language he employs.\

request, the Board gave their engineer instructions to fit two ladders to\
each of those weirs. No reasonable doubt is entertained that the fish\
will scale the ladders\'97except the eels.\

AFTER-DINNER REPORTING.\
In their accounts of the late racing meeting at Newmarket, the\
sporting reporters have been careful to relate the fluctuations in the\
betting with much care and minuteness, stating, for our benefit, how\
the odds stood at the Comer all throughout the day before, and up to\
I he moment of the start of each great race. The betting in the morning,\
directly after breakfast, has been chronicled, as well as that done later\
in the day. "Latest Betting before Dinner" on the eye of the\
Cambridgeshire was announced in capital letters to the readers of the\
Times; and one over-zealous gentlenian, whom we privately commis-\
sioned to keep us "posted up" as to the odds against the animals\
expected at the post, was so good as to continue writing bis despatches\
even after he had dined. As far as his handwriting has been hitherto\
deciphered, the following is his account of the doings at the Corner on\
the evening before the Cambridgeshire was run:\'97\

CONTEMPORARIES.\
A.PTAIN Blank is an officer\
in the British Army who,\
although he would advance\
intrepid under any can-\
nonade, has had his liver\
out of order, become bilious\
and nervous, and alarmed\
about his health. He takes\
up a newspaper, and, at\
the bottom of one of its\
advertising columns, sees\
an advertisement of a po-\
pular medical work by Dr.\
Asterisks and Co., of\
Hookey Street, Walker\
Square, relative to the\
symptoms which he has\
felt or fancied. He sends\
postage stamps to Aster-\
isks and obtains the book,\
which is mainly a record of\
fictitions cases wherein\
symptoms similar to his\
own are attributed to un-\
physiological mistakes, which he is conscious of having made at some\
time of his life; mistakes that, when discovered, are mercilessly derided\
by the majority of persons, who have never committed thein. He finds\
his perhaps imaginary disease described as tending to the most frightful\
results, inevitable except by consultation of the infallible Dr. Asterisks,\
who guarantees a speedy and effectual cure. A correspondence ensues,\
consisting of reports of no progress on the part of the victim, and\
packages of nostrum on that of the quack, ending on the part of the\
latter, after having done the former out of between \'a380 and \'a390, with\
a demand of some \'a3150 more, accompanied by a threat of publishing\
the patient's medical history if he dares refuse to pay the money.\
Such, except names, is the summary of a case which came before one\
of the police-magistrates last week, and remains to be decided elsewhere.\
The quacks, let us hope, are in a fair way to penal servitude\'97would it\
were possible to add the pillory and the whipping post! The names of\
the parlies concerned in this transaction are of no consequence; those\
which the quacks go by are aliases, and besides would soil this page.\
Moreover, Asterisks and Co. serve to stand for the whole tribe of\
scoundrels whose names figure down there in the rogues' corner of some\
newspapers that claim respectability. Many of the country papers,\
indeed, have whole sides sullied with the abominable puffs of these\
rascals, whose very names, if they appeared in Punch's pages, would\
blast the character of Punch.\
Yet all these papers lie about on drawing-room tables, where they\
are open to the inspection of not only young gentlemen, but also young\
ladies.\
Now, then, contemporaries, metropolitan and provincial, but espe-\
cially provincial, that publish the advertisements of obscene quacks, did\
it never occur to you that, in so doing, you constitute yourselves the\
accomplices of the foulest of swindling extortioners? Are you so very\
hard up that you cannot do without the money of these dirty fellows?\
Is your circulation in such an alarming state that you really cannot\
afford to exclude their disgusting and fraudulent announcements?\
These noisome quacks are abolished, their occupation is gone, if you\
will only refuse their advertisements insertion.\
Recollect that no author of any medical work, except a quack, ever\
advertises his address. To find out anybody that you suspect of\
being a quack, look his name out in the official Register of legally-\
qualified practitioners, where you will not find it., ChurchilVs Medical\
Directory will do. But the quacks' advertisements speak, or rather\
smell, for themselves. Reject those advertisements. If you do not, it\
wilj be for your readers to determine, for the future, whether the papers\
which they take in, and put in the way of their children, shall or shall\
not be clean.\
The Lyceum.\
The King's Butterfly is, in a double sense, beautifully mounted; i.e. as\
regards the 6cenery and the horse. Fanfan (Mr. Fechter) "gets him-\
self up" admirably, on horseback: and we should say that the noble\
animal alone would be strong enough to draw, even though 'tis but a fly\
to which she is at tached. The mare Minerva is none of your cream-\
coloured, pink-eyed circus steeds, and, though perfectly trained, appears\
as little broken, as is, by this time, Mr. Fechter's English.\
Wiiy Sew-called ?\'97 The inventors of the several different sorts of\
Sewing Machines arc thinking of calling them Reaping Machines, on\
accouut of the excellent Pecuniary Harvest gathered in by them.\
A BISHOP'S TRIBUTE TO TENNYSON.\
It is with the greatest pleasure that we record a graceful tribute on\
the part of the Lord Bishop of Oxford to the genius of Alfred\
Tennyson. At a meeting, in Ipswich, of friends of the principal\
Church Missionary Society, the Bishop, in seconding a resolution to\
acknowledge the Society's labours, observed, with reference to the\
prelates who preside over the Church in the Colonies:\'97]J\
"There was an objection often taken to the Colonial Bishops that they wen no\
frequently at home. People In this matter were like the man who saw half-a-doseti\
flies, on a hot summer's day whirling round and round, and\
fuU of flies.' The tact was that when the Colonial Bishops came\
hide themselves out of the way at some w*terinif-placc, but the\
after a continuous residence in their dioceses of from two to f<\
to England, at the same time workod hard when they were here'\
said, 'Oh, the room Is\
line home they did not\
the two or three who.\
So hard, in preaching and advancing Missionary claims, that they\
make noise enough for many times their number, so much noise that\
people who hear it cry, as it were, "Oh, the room is full of flies."\
Evidently the Bishop op Oxford spoke fresh from reading the Lau-\
reate's Northern Parmer, and bearing in mind the following reference in\
that poem by the departing agriculturist to "Parson:"\'97\
*' An' I hallu* corned to's ehoorch afoor moy 8allt wur dead,\
An' 'eerd un a bummin' awaay loike a buzzard clock ower my ye&d."\
Mr. Tennyson makes the Lincolnshire Farmer compare the effect\
produced upon his ears by the sermon of a single clergyman to the hum\
of a cockchafer blundering about aloft against surrounding objects.\
The Bishop does the Bard the honour of accepting his comparison, aid,\
by a slight variation, adapting it to the discourses of a few bishops, of\
whose eloquence he conveys a neat idea by suggesting its resemblance\
to the buzzing of numerous flies. Everybody had before beard of\
"Bishop's Blue," but the Bishop op Oxford will have taught us to\
associate that colour with the big buzzing fly commonly called a " blue-\
bottle."\
There is a celebrated Chorus in Handel's great Oratorio, Israel in\
Egypt, in which the buzz of a swarm of flies is imitated in the accom-\
paniment so naturally that those who hear it are always prompted to\
exclaim, "Oh, the room is full of flies," and in so saying they will in\
future tnink of the Bishop op Oxford and his brother bluebottle*.\
MOTHER MEDIUM.\
Is there any sperrits present F If so be there's any, p'r'aps,\
They will stnnify their presence in the usal way bv raps.\
Yes, there is, well now then, Mister, take the halfabet, you '11 find\
They will rap at the right letter, name a party in your mind.\
If you axes of a question, two raps means in answer no,\
Three is yes, which on inquiry likewise you will find it so.\
Ary gent or lady wish a word from ary sperrit dear?\
Ary sperrit ary message got for ary party here?\
Now I looks from one to t'other round the circle, if you please,\
Sperrit, vou will be so kind as rap the party when I sees,\
Did yer feel the sperrit-touch. Mum? No, not yet, you will in turn,\
They're a fumblin' at my ancles, and they soon will be at youra.\

No, look ondemeath the table, there ain't nothink to be seen.\

DICKEY-SAM LATIN.\
See how men\'97and Maggies\'97may grow wiser every day! Here is\
the Liverpool Daily Mercury's answer to a fair inquirer:\'97\
"Maooik.\'97The letters S.P.Q B. on the doors of St George's Hall stand for tattu\
populi qui Roman v.m\'97the welfare of the people of Borne."\
We once heard of a stage-manager, who, having a love of order, was\
scandalised at the non-natural arrangement of the above letters on a\
banner, and so the star Coriolanus was a good deal more astonished than\
delighted to see himself confronted by P. Q. R. S. But we doubt\
whether even this official would have solved the Latin mystery as our\
friend of the Liverpool Daily Mercury has done. We hear that Dr.\
William Smith has written to him to engage his services as sub-\
editor of the next edition of the Classical Dictionary, wisely considering\
that so profound a scholar should not be lost among the Dickey-Sams.\

But times may turn, and taste retrieve\

SIMPLICITY IS CHARMING.\
The Saint Public of Lyons, in a notice relative to the Empeeoe and\
Empeess of Russia on their way through that city, makes a statement\
which may be commended to the attention of the mothers and daughters\
of England:\'97\
"As to the Empress, without giving any special details as to her attire we may\
affirm that she was dressed with a simplicity that a bouryioUe would have dis-\
dained."\
Who would not like to see his betrothed, or his wife and daughters,\
but especially his wife and daughters, dress with the simplicity which\
an Empress would choose but a bourgcoise would disdain? What man\
is there who would not rather see the woman whom he loves, and still\
rather the women whom he has to maintain, attired in the simple dress\
which' the taste of an Empress approves of, but the ostentatiousness of\
a Snobbess despises F To be sure an Empress may have the taste of a\
Snobbess, and set all manner of flaunting, ridiculous, and expensive\
fashions; but that is not the case of the Empeess of Russia, whose\
simplicity of apparel cannot be too strongly recommended as an example\
to all ladies, but particularly those who are married or who wish to get\
married. For the present expense of female dress is one of the greatest\
of the many troubles that Paterfamilias, whose means are not unli-\
mited, has to contend with; and this also it is which keeps every young\
man, unless he either has a large fortune, or is a great fool, single.\
There's the respect that makes celibacy of such long life: and then we\
hear a cry of " employment for women," and have girls emigrating to\
the rough settlements, or trying to be compositors, or entering the\
medical profession, or jumping off bridges, or even going for governesses!\
On the simplicity of the Empress of Russia's dress, the Salut Public\
remarks that:\'97\
Spirits Below Proof.\
Da. Newman somewhere says that the devil has often been put to\
ridiculous flight by the sign of the Cross. No doubt he has, as often\
as he has appeared. It is a remarkable fact that the "sperrita " which\
actuate Mediums, can never stand any conclusive test, and ever also\
avoid the experimentum crucis.\
COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.\
A Work at which Mr. Bass, M.P., does not wish any student to\
"grind" is the Novum Organon.\
Wheee would be the place to plant a Cannon?\
In the Forest of Dean.\
'When a lady is Empress of All the\
articles with impunity."\
she may wear the most simple\
Let our fair readers be assured that the ability to wear the most\
simple articles with impunity is not a privilege confined to the Empeess\
of All the Russias. Any English lady may dress with the most\
simple elegance possible, except here and there one, bound in matrimony\
to an extraordinary man, who likes to see his wife rigged out in the\
extreme of finery, and who, unless she bedizens herself showily enough\
to please him, will neglect her and absent himself from home, and live\
at Lis Club. The disdain with which a "bourgeoise" may please to\
regard the simplicity of a lady's dress, is, in so far as it signifies any-\
thing at all, a compliment, and not a punishment to any lady.\
MONASTICISM AT NORWICH.\
(Evidence of a Churchwarden, omitted in the Newspaper'Reports of the\
recent proceedings of the Norwich Poor Law Board.)\
"All the chimneys of Bbothee Ignattus's Anglican Monastery have\
been fitted with cowls. Knew that monks wore cowls. Wouldn't let\
his chimney wear a cowl if he know'd it. Yes, I did once hear some one\
or other, a friend of Ignatius's, say " well! I'm blessed!" Considered\
the expression decidedly Popish. Had seen Ma. Hillyard cross a\
road. (Sensation.) Knew that crossing was Papistical. Had never\
seen any of the monks cross a horse. Had heard as the Pope used to\
bless animals. Didn't know what a Rude Brick was. (Laughter.) Oh,\
a Ru-bri<k? It was what the Church was made of; at least bricks. He\
was a Brick himself, convivially speaking. (Applause.) Knew the\

assistance, or he might have asked some of his political\
friends and acquaintances to aid him in tbe work. Pope,\
as we all know, had much help in translating Homer,\
It would have been interesting to read an advertiser]\
after the ancient fashion, setting forth the "Etni\
Hands," and the " Parts undertook by them." We shi\
like to see Sir John Pakrigtos's version of the Cata-\
logue of the Ships: we should much like to see Lord\
Palmerston's rendering of tbe description of the Useless\
Fortifications; and we should particularly like to see Lord\
Russell's treatment of the Unsuccessful Embassy. The\
splendid Non-intervention passage (in Book VIH.) might\
employ the fiery pen of Lord Ellenborough; and though\
Mr. Walpole is, happily, not likely to set the Thames on\
tire, we should willingly entrust him with that feat in the\
case of the Scamander. The Bishop of Oxford, with\
| the friendly aid of Lord Westbury, could surely do ample\
justice to the anger of the enraged priest, Chryses. But\
Lord Derby has chosen to say "Alone I did it," and we\
need hardly add that a favourite Contributor to Punch would\
be, single-handed, equal to Homer, even were he multiplied\
by the number of cities in which he applied for out-door relief.\

TnE Mothers of England have been much afflicted at\
reading a statement that little Prince Victor, on his home\
voyage, suffered from the mal de mer. Punch has authority\
to contradict the assertion, and to say that the Royal Baby\
was never sick at all until, on arriving at Hull, a display of\
abject flunkeyism was made by the authorities. No intelli-\
gent baby could stand that. But he is now quite well again,\
and crows with pleasure at this nursery rhyme, which was\

THE NAGGLETONS ON SPIRITUALISM.\
We still find our friends in their fashionable residence. Time, eleven at night. Mas. Naggleton, sola, in the drawing-room, reading "The Gen?\
life."\'97Enter Mr. Naggleton. He glances at the elegant clock.\
Mr. Nagoleton (talcing a seat). Do you see anything remarkable\
about me, Maria?\
Mrs. Naggleton (scarcely looking at him). You look very slovenly, and\
you have come up stairs with muddy boots, but there is nothing re-\
markable in either.\
Mr. If. In either of my boots?\
Mrs. If. In either proof of your disregard of the decencies of life. I\
witness it too often.\
Mr. N. (exalted). Ah, don't scold now, but listen to something in-\
teresting.\
Mrs. If. I prefer to go to bed. It is very late.\
Mr. N. Yes, it was not much later last night when yon informed me\
that you were ready to go out.\
Mrs. If. 0, if you wish to quarrel, I submit.\
I have no spirits to\
Spirits is the word, however. I have\
resist.\
Mr. If. Resist,\
been with the spirits,\
Mrs. N. What nonsense are you talking?\
Mr. N. None. I tell you I have been at a Manifestation, and I have\
seen some very extraordinary things.\
Mrs. If. You cannot mean that you have been at a seance.\
Mr. If. Why can't I?\
Mrs. If. But you don't?\
Mr. N. But I do.\
Mrs. If. That you have been to one of those meetings, where they sit\
in the dark, and supernatural things are pretended to be done.\
Mr. If. Are done.\
Mrs. N. Henry, I did hope that I should never have to despise my\
husband.\
Mr. If. Well, I rather hoped so too, at least not this husband.\
Mrs. N. I trust that you are joking with me.'\
Mr. N. You don't encourage me in that practice, my dear. I am telling\
you a simple truth. I have been to a spirit-manifestation, and I thought\
that though you are not usually much interested in anything I say, you\
might like to hear about this.\
Mrs. If. I have heard enough.\
Mr. If. 0, very well, just as you please. I am sorry now that I did\
not go over and have a cigar with Browner and Poldoodie, instead of\
making the best of my way home.\
Mrs. N. Mr. Browner I know enough of to wish to know no more.\
The other person with the ridiculous name I never heard of, but you have\
a talent for picking up low acquaintance. That is a trifle, however.\
Mr. N. It is not a trifle that you should tell a spiteful untruth. And\
Poldoodte is not a low acquaintance, at least you did not think so\
when he took you down to dinner at the Pankeys'.\
Mrs. If. What a falsehood. That was Mr. Hoister.\
Mr. N. All the same. In our facetious way we call him Poldoodle,\
which is some kind of Scotch for oyster.\
Mrs. N. I thought him too much of a gentleman* to allow vulgar\
liberties to be taken with his name.\
Mr. N. Then you thought wrong, you see, as you often do. A true\
gentleman is not a starched stiffback Snotchleyfied prig, but a man who\
can distinguish between good fellowship and impertinence.\
Mrs. N. If he associates with your set, he has plenty of opportunities\
of appreciating the latter. (Rises.) I suppose you will go to bed\
when you are ready.\
Mr. N. I suppose I shall. Good night, if you are going.\
Mrs. N. Put out the gas, unless you are afraid.\
Mr. If. What should I be afraid of? j\
Mrs. If. Your conscience.\

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
Mr. JV. What's my conscience got to do with the gas? What has\
the Gas Company's own conscience to do with it either, if you come to\
that, for it's very bad and precious dear f\
Mrs. N. I see that you wish not to be left alone, and I do not wonder.\
\{Returns to her seat.) If you play these tricks with your nerves, you\
will soon be a pitiable creature.\
Mr. JV. I am that, but not account of nerves. My nerves were never\
better in my life. What do you mean?\
Mrs. If. Try to carry it off so, but I know you better." You have been\
dreadfully frightened, and it serves you quite right.\
Mr. JV. Frightened at what, in the name of all that is ridiculous f\
Mrs. N. How should I know what wicked folly you have been wit-\
nessing F I only see that it has had, its effect on you, being a weak\
man, and that you are all in a flurry. You had better go to bed. I\
will light you to your door, and you can keep the gas burning all night\
\'97that extravagance is better than your being terrified into illness.\
Will you take anything sedative?\
Mr. JV. Yes, some brandy-and-water, and a cigar, which I '11 have\
in the study. Don't be nonsensical. I am about as much frightened\
as you are. Will you hear what I have seen?\
Mrs. N. I had rather not, but if talking relieves you, go on.\
Mr. JV. \{aside). I knew she wanted to hear all about it. Well,\
Poldoodds called\
Mrs. JV. Oblige me by keeping that vulgarity for your friends, and\
by iriving persons their right names.\
Mr. JV. IIoister, then, but I think the other name is more aristo-\
cratic\'97hoister reminds one of a crane at a warehouse.\
Mrs. JV. As I do not frequent warehouses, I am not reminded "of any-\
thing of the kind.\
Mr. JV. \{swallowing its repartee). He called and asked me to go to\
the stance, which was at a private house in Pall Mall, so I had a chop\
with him at the Reform Club.\
Mrs. N. In those boots? But I believe that the radical and republi-\
can faction tramples upon all external decencies\'97the floor is san ded, I\
suppose.\
Mr. JV. How can you talk such idiotcy? I wish you could see the\
Reform kitchen.\
Mrs. JV. You don't mean that you condescended to dine in a kitchen?\
Mr. N. No, I don't, though I've dined in worse places. We had\
one bottle of champagne, and one of claret, between three, Browner\
being the other, and some liqueur.\
Mrs. JV. Your wife had one glass of pale ale.\
Mr. JV. More goose my wife, who has the cellar-key.\
Mrs. JV. Which she will never use again after the insult and abuse\
which followed her last use of it.\
Mr. JV. There was neither, Maria. I only said that you might have\
given a pack of schoolboys something cheaper than my best port. But\
confound your memory for old grievances\'97you never remember\
pleasant things.\
Mrs. JV. I have so few to remember.\
Mr. JV. You are as lucky a woman as I know. Well, we went over\
at eight, and found about twenty people assembled. The Medium was\
brought in, and the operator made a little speech, and then the lights\
were put out, and we sat in a circle, with our hands joined.\
Mrs. JV. Fancy a pack of men being such fools.\
Mr. JV. There were some women, too, for I held hands with two.\
Ifrj. JV. Nice sort of persons to come to such a place.\
Mr. N. You'd go to-morrow, if I would take you.\
Mrs. N. (knows that quite well). I hope, Henry, that even if you\
commanded me to go, I should know my duty too well to obey.\
Mr. N. I won't try you, my dear, especially as I disapprove of\
women's sanctioning such things. After a time we heard some scratch-\
ing and knockings, and then music began to play in different parts of\
the room, the instruments moving about.\
Ifrj. JV. Confederates, of course.\
Mr. If. I don't know whether they were Federals or Confederates.\
Then some luminous hands appeared, and waved about.\
Mrs. N. Old gloves stuffed with bran and rubbed with phosphorus,\
and stuck on the end of wires, or lazytongs.\
Mr. N. I cannot say. Then a strong and mysterious wind passed by,\
and they said it was the spirits' wings.\
Mrs. N. Pair of bellows, most likely, blown by some of the party.\
Mr. N. And then there was a very faint light, and some said that\
they saw a human figure moving through the air.\
Mrs. N. Your own child could do that trick better, in the daylight,\
with che kite he blows out into the shape of a boy. Upon my word, I\
can hardly listen with patience to such trash.\
Mr. JV. And then something hit me on the head.\
Mrs. K. I am very glad of it.\
Mr. JV. And then some said that hands were touching them.\
Mrs. If. No doubt they were. Pickpockets. The business seems\
invented for genteel pickpockets.\
Mr, JV. And at last a hand came to me and touched mine.\
Mrs. JV If you had had any spirit you would have caught it.\
Mr. JV. I did, and held it tight.\
Mrs. JV. And of course let go, just as you do everything.\
Mr. JV. Not exactly, for there it is.\
[Flings the Spirit-hand on the table. Mas. Naggleton snatches it up.\
Mrs. JV. As I said. No, where are my scissors. \{Cuts it.) No, wool,\
not bran, and springs, and see where it was broken off from whatever\
was holding it. Why, you can smell the phosphorus quite plainly.\
Mr. JV. Well, but don't rub it on my nose.\
Mrs. JV. But didn't anybody know you bad caught the hand!1 Of\
course you couldn't keep the secret to yourself.\
Mr. If. I held my tongue. The busmess came to a sudden end, and\
we were told that the spirits were unhappy, and that a compact of\
honour had been, broken. But as nobody confessed, there was an end.\
Mrs. JV. Henby, I was displeased with you for going, for you are\
not strong, and you are easily imposed upon. But I am glad; that you\
had sense enough not to' be deceived by the jugglers. You ought to\
have denounced, out loud, the whole imposition, and shown that hand.\
Mb. Snotchley would have done so, I am sure. But you have behaved\
better than I expected, and so there \{only on his cheek, though), and\
now I will mix you some brandy-and-water, if you '11 come down-stairs.\
Wicked humbugs, they ought to be flogged.\
Mr. JV. Strong language, my dear.\
Mrs. JV. I mean it to be strong.\
Mr. If. Mean the same about my grog, my dear.\

A PROMISING PERFORMANCE.\
ight chamber music\
is by some folks held\
in high esteem: but\
there are some kinds\
of chamber music\
not much to our\
liking, as, for in-\
stance, the music of\
the mice behind the\
wainscot in the\
chamber where we\
sleep, and the music\
of tom-cats upon the\
tiles above our bed-\
chamber. It is fre-\
quently our fate to\
hear an Opera di\
Camera of this dis-\
tracting sort, and we\
own that we would\
gladly give our ears\
to get away from it.\
But we Like such\
chamber operas a*\
Mb. German Reed\
has introduced to\
public notice at the\
Gallery of Illustra-\
tion; and, as we hate being thought singular, we are very glad to see that\
very many other people appear to share our liking. The Gallery was so\
full the night when we attended hearing" (we use a legal phrase to\
show we are a judge of music) that it was all that we could do to get our\
ears and eyes inside it; and, as all the floor is occupied with seats, we\
hope, when next we go, to find a row or two of chairs suspended in mid-\
air for the comfort of late comers. Perhaps the spirits will be kind\
enough to act upon our hint, and help a few people to float, like Mr.\
Home, close to the ceiling; only, in asking this small favour, we fear we\
ask too much, for the spirits hitherto have done nothing half so useful.\
Nice music, nicely sung, is nightly heard within the gallery; and if\
they want to give their ears a treat that won't cost much, both soldiers\
and civilians should hear The Soldier's Legacy. Fresh, pretty, and\
harmonious, this little work, mayhap, will give them greater pleasure\
than many a grand opera; and if they don't admire the sweet-throated\
Miss Henderson and the pleasant-tongued Miss Poole, we can only\
pity their miss-appreciation. They must like Mr. Whiftin, too, if they\
have any ear for music; and even if they\'84hnve not, they must at least\
admire a tenor who gives himself no airs while he is occupied in singing\
them. As for poor dear funny snubbed and snub-nosed Mr. Shaw, he\
gets laughed at every night so much that he is now quite used to it;\
and so they need not be afraid that he will think them rude for grinning\
at him. If because he acts so well you fancy he can't sing well, we can\
only say, O pshaw! you unbeliever, go and hear him. As the black-\
smith in Too Many Cooks, he is as harmonious as the Blacksmith of old\
Handel; and we have a strong sovpcon that the relish of his soup\
song will tempt many of his hearers to come of'en back to Offenbach.\
Indeed, in songs as well as singers, the Opera di Camera is throughout\
so bright and sparkling that no one can mistake it for a camera-obscura.\

The subjoined case, lately reported in the Birmingham Post, is\
recommended to the attention of Lord Palmebston :\'97\
"Imprisoned for not Attending Church.\'97At the Candover monthly Petty\
Sessions, on Wednesday, before the Rev. H. Burton and H. De Warter, Esq., two\
agricultural labourers, in the employ of Ma. George Mason, Farmer,Ryton, named\
John Pinches and Richard Davies, were brought up at the instance of their\
master, charged with having, on the 4th of September, refused to obey his lawful\
commands. From the evidence it appeared that the * lawful commands' deposed\
to in the summons were resolved into the fact that on the day named, it being\
Sunday, Mr Mason ordered the men to go to church, which they point blank\
refused to do. The case having been fully proved, the defendants were sentenced\
to Beven days' imprisonment in the House of Correction."\
We do not wish to underrate the services rendered the Church by\
the many profound divines, erudite scholars, and conclusive reasoners\
who have utterly confuted Bishop Colenbo and the authors of Essays\
and Reviews. But logical argument, although it may in some degree\
tend to abate the scepticism of the educated classes, is not the method\
by which the warfare against irreligion is best to be conducted amongst\
the poor. Seven days' imprisonment in the House of Correction for\
refusing to attend church, will do more to convince a couple of agricul-\
tural labourers of the great truths which are proclaimed from the pulpit,\
than all the verbal demonstration and exhortation in the world. What\
II. De Warter, Esq., may deserve for his share in the just and wise\
sentence passed on John Pinches and Richard Davies, for not going\
to church, the Home Secretary will perhaps best judge; but the\
noble Premier, who has made so many bishops, should, on the very\
next vacancy that occurs on the Episcopal Bench, add one more to their\
number by putting a mitre on the head of the Rev. H. Burton.\
A Misapprehension.\
A Lady, not very young and excessively nervous about travelling in\

toast of " The Bishops and the Clergy," he observed that .\'97\
"It was no mere empty formality which gathered the Clergy around his Lordship\
at these banquets."\
No, indeed. The Clergy who enjoyed the Lord Mayor's hospitality\
at the Mansion House may have included some formalists, but we may\
be sure enough that not one of them was empty. It may be safely\
concluded, that the most formal of all the Anglo-Catholic ritualists,\
who may have sat down to turtle soup at the t)auquet of the Cine\
Monarch, did not fast on that occasion.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
UMBRELLA;\
\
USE AND ABUSE.\
tjr use of an umbrella, in Lon-\
don, is not merely as a pro-\
tection against rain. No; for\
who that cares one sixpence,\
out of twenty-one ana six-\
pence, for his umbrella, would\
ever expose it to the shower-\
bath of the Pluvian Jupiter f\
Not I. In fact, the umbrella\
is useless; as when;it rains,\
one takes a cab.\
In what situation is a man\
more utterly helpless than\
when, on a pouring wet day,\
he is coming from a railway\
station, in a Hansom, with\
the window down, and a port-\
manteau, which the cabman\
has placed over the trap in\
the roof?\
He can holloa and shout\
it is true; but will the sound\
penetrate? will it rise above\
the din of the streets?\
How am I to communicate with the driver? How am I to inform him that he\
has taken a wrong turning? I don't know, no more do you. Who can tell me?\
If I break his window, ne has a remedy, against me for damage. If I manage\
with great physical exertion to push the trap up, the portmanteau is violently\
knocked over, and dislodges the driver from his perch; away goes the horse, and\
where am I then? I just draw your attention to these facts.\
Of what use, then, is the umbrella?\
It is used to prevent people from treading on your heels. Swung quickly\
round and round, it will clear your path of tumbling boys, "a penny a wheel,"\
and professional beggars.\
It is specially useful as a cab-signal. Without shouting out "Hi!" "Here,\
Hansom!" "Hi, here cabbee!"\'97a proceeding that only strains the voice and\
tries the temper, if attention is not promptly given to your call\'97the umbrella\
should be gently and gracefully lifted with one motion of the wrist, at the same\
time that you make a slight inclination of the head, and the intelligent driver, thus\
decorously and politely summoned, will at once cheerfully pull up at the kerb\
where you are standing.\
The umbrella will, then, in a Hansom, be used for directing the cabman's course,\
much in the fashion of a penny-steamboat captaiu's hand-steering, only without the\
shrill-voiced boy's assistance. Time the movements of your umbrella so as to\
render the cabman's obedience easy: point out, with it, the exact door whereat you\
wish to stop. If the horse is slow, and you are sure the driver can't see you (and\
he can't if you only know the right plan) you can touch up the animal judiciously, not\
cruelly, with the ferule. Don't accompany the action with " tclik!" or " come up!"\
or the cabman may hear, and suspect. Of four-wheelers, and of the further use and\
abuse of umbrellas, more another time.\
By the way, let me ask, are the hatters of London in league with the Hansom-cab\
manufacturers? Who can get into one of these vehicles without knocking his hat\
against the window, that never will allow itself to be pulled up to the top? Ride\
regularly in Hansoms, and your gossamer won't last a week.\
By what natural law is it, that, in a Hansom, one invariably shuts the wrong\
door first?\
Can two gentlemen sit comfortably in a Hansom? If so,,how?\

LETTER FROM A GHOST.\
The Ghost of the late John Wilson Croker, Esquire, presents his\
compliments to the Editor of the Quarterly Review, and bees leave to\
call his attention to the following passage in the New (232nd) Number\
of that periodical\'97(Art. IV. p. 413, lines 21, 22, right hand page.) The\
article purports to be a review of a Dictionary of the Bible, by Da.\
William Smith :\'97\
"We believe that it will be an invaluable gift to the e!\'abvy, whether Churchmen\
or Dissenters."\
Can the Ghost trust his eyes? Is this the Quarterly Review, once\
(in Mr. Choker's time) I he bulwark and organ of the Church of Eng-\
land? Is the present Editor aware of the frightful, howling wicked-\
ness of what he has inserted? Since when has it been permitted to\
give the title of Clergy to Schismatics? The Ghost is not a laudator\
temporis acli, but he fearlessly states that in his days the pages of the\
Quarterly should have been defaced by no such base concession to the\
insolence of Dissent. The book reviewed seems to be valuable, though\
it is' marked by a lamentable absence of denunciation of those who\
refuse to see theological matters in the one and only light, but if it be\
a good book, those who know the Dissenters\'97affectedly called Non-\
conformists^must be aware that it is casting pearls before swine to\
offer it to those bigoted schismatics and revolutionary infidels. Yet\
to compliment such folks, the great Church and Conservative Review\
ranks their preachers with real Clergymen! The Ghost of John\
Wilson Choker, Esquire, is too disgusted to add more.\
A Considerable Sum of Sorrow.\
The national debt incurred by the Federal States up to the present\
time is calculated to amount to about \'a3600,000,000. Almost all that\
money has been spent in making widows and orphans. How many\
wives and children would half of it have made happy P\

STARVATION SCHOOLING.\
Somehow or another our poor injured friends the farmers have not\
talked about their ruin lately quite so much as they once used to do.\
Yet that there are agriculturists still in a distressed state seems pretty\
clear, we think, from the following advertisement:\'97\
AGOVERNESS WANTED, in a farmhouse. Would be treated >a\
ono of the family. To teach four children, the eldest a boy, eight yeara of age-\
Must be capable of imparting a sound English education, good music and singing\
drawing, and the rudiments of French, if desired; also to assist in the sewing.\
Salary \'a312 a year, with laundress. Address, Ac.\
Twelve pounds a-year for the schooling of four children! A farmer\
must be surely much distressed for money who. thus sues in forma\
pauperis, as we may phrase it, for a governess. And a governess, more-\
over, who is " also to assist in the sewing," and to fill up her spare time\
by slaving as a sempstress. A man must have a poor income if he can\
afford no belter pay than this; and, as for being "treated as one of the\
family," that can hardly be regarded in the light of an advantage. The\
very poorest living must be looked for in a family, where so poor a\
salary is offered for a governess, and it would be only fair if the schooling\
and the sewing which possibly may be procured through this advertise-\
ment, should prove to be as bad as the wages which are offered for\
them.\

HE simplest words are best where all words are vain. Ten days ago, a great artist, in the\
noon of life, and with his glorious mental faculties in full power, but with the shade of\
physical infirmity darkening upon him, took his accustomed place among friends who have this\
day held his pall. Some of them had been fellow-workers with him for a quarter of a century,\
others for fewer years; but to know him well was to love him dearly, and all in whose name\
these lines are written mourn as for a brother. His monument is in the volumes of which\
this is one sad leaf, and in a hundred works which, at this hour, few will not remember more easily\
than those who have just left his grave. While Society, whose every phase he has illustrated\
with a truth, a grace, and a tenderness heretofore unknown to satiric art, gladly and proudly\
takes charge of his fame, they, whose pride in the genius of a great associate was equalled\
by their affection for an attached friend, would leave on record that they have known no\
kindlier, more refined, or more generous nature than that of him who has been thus early\
called to his rest.\

Mr. Lawson, and the United Kingdom Alliance, agjtit-\
ing for a Permissive Prohibitory Liquor Law, wish to\
restrain sots from drunkenness by Maine force. This, of\
itself, would be all very well; but the worst of it is, the?\
want to apply that force to the sober.\
ADVICE TO AN APPARITION.\
Ignatius,\
Your appearance in the Church Congress at Bristol created\
such a sensation that it has earned for you the name of "The Appa-\
rition." Perhaps the Apparition of Brother Ignatius will be remem-\
bered when that of Giles Scroggins is forgotten.\
Stick to it. Appear whenever and wherever you can, with effect.\
The place of all others for you to appear in is that where Protestants\
most do congregate. So just you go one night on the occasion of some\
great Evangelical or Anti-Maynooth meeting, and appear at Exeter\
Hall.\
How are you to manageit? Envelop Ignatius in an upper Benjamin.\
Wear a black cloak with a cape and a velvet collar over your frock.\
Thrust your toes into a pair of old shoes, and put on gaiters to hide\
your sandals. Sport a white choker, and conceal your tonsure with a\
curly wig. Get upon the platform, go to the front, watch your oppor-\
tunity, and ask to be allowed to speak. Then throw aside your\
disguise, kick off your crabshells, and stand confessed, as a monk\
should.\
There will, of course, be a jolly row. But slap your breast, proclaim\
yourself an Englishman, and invoke Englishmen to give you fair play.\
Very likely they will then hear what you have to say - perhaps with\
cheers. At the worst you can only be removed by the Police, for you\
are allowed to go about, and as yet nobody is authorised to take care\
of you, and lodge you in an institution where your tonsure would\
perhaps be extended to the whole of your scalp.\
Of course you will not stick at putting on appearances meant to be\
mistaken for those of a British clergyman, because, although false, they\
will be assumed for a pious purpose; for you are as much a Jesuit as\
you are a Benedictine, and therefore know that the end justifies the\
means.\
I hope you got on well last Saturday. I believe your effigy was\
chaired a good deal on that day. Did you venture abroad yourself? If\
you did, I admire your courage, because there was every reason to fear\
that the profane vulgar would have got hold of you on that Fifth of\
November, and have made you do duty for the hero of the anniversary\
by carrying you about bodily as a Guy.\
With many thanks for the very much amusement which you have so\
often afforded me, and hoping for further favours of the same nature\
from your diverting eccentricities, believe me, ever your fnendlf\
from your\
monitor,\
your\
Tony Lumpket.\
ENGLISH AND IRISH.\
The Corporation of Dublin are to address Lord Wodehousb on his\
arrival at the Vice-regal Lodge, and with a Milesian disregard to the\
unities, the Address has already been made public.\
Among the paragraphs in which this Address shows up in glowisi\
colour the wrongs of Ireland, occurs the following:\'97\
. "In the course of your visit to the provinces your Excellency will see at Gal"-:\
a port which Nature has created, and placed at the nearest and safest point h\
communication between these islands and the Continent of America. But althou/li\
a Packet Company in connection with the port was for a short time subsidised, 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 \
narrow spirit and the jealovty with which it had to contend neceuarilf eventuaUi in *\

The Corporation will be told, no doubt, by a malignant British Press1\
that the packet company in question in no one instance kept the time\
that entitled it to receipt of the Government subsidy\'97that its ships\
were weak and ill found, its engines constantly breaking down, its\
capital insufficient, and all its arrangements so unbusinesslike, that it\
was rapidly wound up, in a state of hopeless insolvency.\
That is the base, bloody, and brutal Saxon way of putting the matter.\
The warm-hearted Milesian penetrates through such unimportant\
accidents, and sees at the root of the Galway Packet Compan) s\
failure the narrow spirit of English opposition and the jealousy of\
Ireland, which governs all our relations with that ill-used country.\

PUNCH'S SPIRIT MEETINGS.\
INTRODUCTION.\
fHr. Punch has btcomc a Conbrrt tD Spiritualism.\
otjbt not that when,\
and where his Con-\
version was finally\
effected will be re-\
vealed hereafter, when\
the public mind shall\
be sufficiently attuned\
to celestial harmonies\
to receive that revela-\
tion with solemnity\
and sweetness. For\
the present, suffice it\
to say, that having\
entirely and dispas-\
sionately considered\
the subject, having\
examined the evi-\
dences, having wit-\
nessed thousands of\
experiments, having\
read all the spiritual\
books, having medi-\
tated upon the vast\
advantages which\
mankind have gained\
from the ministering\
of the Spirits, having\
duly regarded the\
scholarly, pure, and disinterested character of the well-born and refined\
persons who practise Spiritualism, and the superior intellectuality of\
the gentlemen and ladies who believe in it, Mr. Punch has convinced\
himself that the Spirits are genuine.\
He is not a Spirit to do anything by halves.1\
The very moment that he felt himself a Spiritualist, he sent for the\
most accomplished professors of the system, and under their advice,\
aided by his own genius, Mr. Punch's architect and upholsterer pro-\
ceeded to fit up the most handsome of the saloons, at 85, Fleet Street,\
as a Temple of Spiritualism. The machinist of one of the leading\
theatres has rendered his invaluable assistance, and Mr. Punch's\
Spiritual Saloon and Demonical Drawing-Room is now daily and nightly\
devoted to Seance) of the most remarkable character.\
As it is the duty of those who believe that they have discovered a\
truth to impart it to others in all its fulness, or even a little more,\
Mr. Punch proposes to publish, at such times and seasons as the Spirits\
may ordain, records of the proceedings at his Seances. He at once\
proceeds to state what took place at the very first of these extraordinary\
meetings.\
Tuesday, November 8,1864.\
Mr. Punch and about ten of his young men assembled at nine o'clock.\
The Sibyle Medium, Mother Saunders, arrived shortly afterwards.\
She took her seat, and the Seance commenced. The gaslights were put\
out, but the Medium stated that the Spirits did not object to cigars,\
tobacco being an invention of the Objectionable Power.\
After some knocking and scratching, the Medium announced that\
there were Spirits in the room.\
Mr. Punch was invited to interrogate them on the part of the meeting,\
and he immediately, and with his usual politeness, asked them whether\
they would take anything to drink.\
Gurgling sounds were heard, and it was evident that drinking was\
going on, but no person chose to say who had been at it.\
Mr. Punch then required the name of some Spirit present.\
The first answer was "Junius's Letters."\
"Do I understand that the respected party is Junius himself, or\
only Dead Letters P" asked Mr. Punch.\
The first question was answered in the affirmative.\
"What other name did you bear on earth P" asked Mr. Punch, and\
the assembly listened, breathlessly, for the solution of the great mystery.\
The answer was "Dean Swift."\
"Dear me," said Mr. Punch, "There must be\'97I mean\'97do I quite\
understand\'97of course I am the last person to doubt a Spirit's word,\
but what made you die in 1745, when you did not write your first letter\
till 1769?"\
Here there was much scratching, and the Medium explained that the\
Spirits were very irritable, and did not like being cross-questioned.\
Something fiery was then seen to fly across the room, and plunge into\
the grate. Later, when the lights were restored, a splash of white\
ashes was seen on the blackened hearth, and a visible shudder went\
round the company at this palpable proof of supernatural agency.\
A second Spirit was then invited to name itself.\
"Magna Charta."\
"I\'97and Montesquieu\'97have heard of the Spirit of Laws," said\
Mr. Punch, "but 1 never expected to meet any of his family. What\
has our friend from Rnnnymede to say f"\
"I air the proudest birthright of the British," said the Spirit, with a\
slight nasality, "and I calculate that yew 'a better cos-serve me like\
the apple of your eye, bein' as I air, the brightest gem wrung from the\
haughty crown of your tyrannical Henry the Eighth, and sealed with\
the patriotic gore of Granmer, Sidney, and Lady Jane Grey."\
"This is indeed worth knowing," said Mr. Punch, mindful of the hint\
not to offend the Spirits.\
A third Spirit, according to the Medium, evinced restlessness to\
speak.\
It was announced as "Copernicus."\
"We are indeed honoured," said Mr. Punch. "May I humbly ask\
the illustrious astronomical Spirit to inform us what the Moon is\
made ofP"\
"Ivory," said the Spirit.\
"Bless me, to think that we never thought of|that. But ivory is\'97at\
least we have supposed it\'97an animal substance\'97should I be trespassing\
on spiritual patience if I asked whence so large a quantity was\
obtained?"\
"From the tusks of mammoths, mastodons, and megatheria, existing\
for fourteen.billions of years before the world was created, and it was\
fused together by the action of volcanoes, and polished by attrition with\
the Equator or Equinoxious line. The dark parts, which you fancy\
holes, are stains, and were caused by the bursting of the Milky Way in\
a severe frost."\
"Is the Moon inhabited?"\
"What's that to you P " answered the Spirit. The Medium announced\
that there would be no more revelations from that quarter. There was\
a pause, during which something was felt to be rubbing against the legs\
of several of the party. One, bolder than the rest, put his hand to\
seize the object, when a fierce kind tof noise was heard, and the\
Spirit departed'from the group. The venturous person complained of\
severe pain, and when the lights were turned on, the back of his hand\
was seen distinctly scored with three long, angry scratches. The\
Medium begged that such tricks might ,not be played, as the vengeance\
of the Spirits was very terrible.\
"I am anxious," said Mr. Punch, "to consult a Spirit who will\
answer me a question of personal interest to myself. I have mislaid a\
new pair of t>lack trousers. Could I obtain information of their\
whereabouts P"\
The Medium called on the Spirits generally, and there was a pause.\
Presently a Spirit said,\'97\
"There is a better crop of frogs in the South of France this year than\
last, but soy will be dear, owing to the mortality among blackbeetles."\
""Valuable as general information," said Mr. Punch, "but where are\
my trousers?"\
"Earthly garments wear out," said a Spirit after a pause, "but\
spiritual garments are not liable to do so."\
"But mine are earthly trousers, and I want them," persisted Mr.\
Punch. "Could you induce your Spirits to be in the slightest degree\
practical, M'm P\
"I am only their slave," said the Medium, "but I will ask again.\
Can any one tell anything about this gentleman's trousers P"\
Three loud knocks followed.\
"That is the answer," said the Medium. "I dare not ask again."\
"Three knocks! Hm," mused Mr. Punch. "Is it a reproach to\
me for having three pair, while many persons have none P Three, three\
\'97they can't mean\'97Mrs. Saunders, M'm, ask whether they've got\
among them the ghost of my Uncle."\
Noise as of applause was heard, and the Medium stated that she\
heard the word Balls.\
"Three Balls! Of course. Somebody's been and pawned my new\
black trousers," cried Mr. Punch. "But who, who? I ask any Spirit\
who may know."\
"From information which I received," said a Spirit\
"Yes, yes, you are a very choice Spirit," said Mr. Punch, eagerly.\
"Well, who is it?"\
"I have reason to believe," said the Spirit, "that great numbers of\
cats were eaten as hares in the restaurants of Nice this year, and that\
during the winter forty-nine per cent, of babies will cry very much while\
they are being christened."\
Mr. Punch is full of virtues, and anger is one of them. He exploded\
so fearfully at this last answer that the Medium, snatching up her\
money, bolted, and was seen no more. And so ended the first of Mr.\
Punch's Seances.\

MR. PUNCH TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK.\
Dear Archbishop,\
You hare been warning the Church Institute at Huddersfield\
against "sensation " literature, with its theory of a skeleton in every\
cupboard, its overmastering passions, its strong situations, hideous\
mysteries, appalling catastrophes, break-neck escapes\'97in short, the\
whole stock-in-trade of the to be continued in our next" school.\
There is much truth in what you say: and no one can be more con-\
vinced than I am that this high-spiced literary food is unwholesome,\
and would be fatal, in the long run, to the mental digestion if excess in\
it did not, in most cases, breed a disgust\'97like that of the pastrycook's\
boy for raspberry tarts\'97and in time induce a demand for more sustain-\
ing and less stimulating viands. I should like to see " sensation" less\
rampant in our periodicals; but will you forgive me for suggesting its\
introduction, in moderation, to our pulpits?\
People will draw disagreeable comparisons, and impute narrow\
"shoppy" motives, and I have heard your denunciations of the penny-\
paper and the penny-periodical ascribed to a jealousy of the large and\
ready hearing these find among the classes upon whom the pulpits\'97of\
the Established Church at least\'97exercise no attraction. Yet what\
splendid materials of effect your pulpit-orators command, compared\
with the poor sensation-monger of the penny serial! Depend upon it,\
if your preachers were a little more stirring and moving, more in the\
habit of appealing to the minds, as well as feelings, of their congrega-\
tions, less somnolent and self-satisfied, less in the habit of complacent\
assumption, readier to sympathise with real difficulties and honest\
doubts, keener to note the tendencies of modern thought, to look objec-\
tions in the face, and examine questions all round, you would find in a\
more lively pulpit the best counterbalance to a too sensational press.\
But seeing how the Bench have treated Colenso, and how the Oxford\
Board is now treating Jowett\'97-reading the letters of Pusey and the\
denunciations of Denison\'97knowing from sad and sleepy experience\
what the Anglican pulpit is, and feeling how infinitesimal is the hold\
of the English clergyman\'97the most orthodox and self-satisfied speci-\
mens of aim, at least\'97upon the masses of our cities\'97I cannot, I\
confess, with the best wishes for your success in this crusade against\
sensation, anticipate much from any aid a highly-paid establishment is\
likely to give you in fighting a cheap press at this moment.\
I remain, my dear Archbishop,\
Your faithful servant and fellow-worker,\
TIME OUT OF JOINT.\
There are some people who are said to know what is o'clock, but\
the writer of this notice (printed in the Daily Telegraph), does not\
seem to be one of them:\'97\
A STLEY'S.\'97Mr. E. T. SMITH, anxious to comply with the\
1 of country friends, will give a MORNING PERFORMANCE of MAZEPPA,\
THIS EVENING (Wednesday), November 2. Commence at Two.\
Morning calls are often made a little after it is noon; but this is the\
first time we have heard of a morning performance in the evening.\
Perhaps we next shall hear of midnight meetings being held at six\
o'clock, a.m., or of an evening party beginning about daybreak.\
Some Compliment to Punch.\
An Article in the Spiritual Magazine, gravely maintaining that the\
tricks of the Davenport jugglers are played by Spirits, does Punch the\
honour to remark that he has long ceased to have anything comic in\
his columns." It is reassuring to find that anything comic in these\
columns is invisible to the intelligence that sees anything serious in the\
Davenports' impostures.\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI\
THE COADJUTORS.\
Dedicated to all those who are interetted in the" Curate Question."\
Tee Rev. Willie Wynkym, his years were twenty-four,\
And he had been to Oxford to gather Pagan lore\'97\
To gather Pagan lore, because since he must be a Priest,\
'Twas fitting he should study most the thing he'd need the least.\
Now to the Bishop he repairs and being that day in luck,\
Passes straightway the Chaplain dread\'97a man without a pluck;"\
So is ordained a Deacon"\'97a Deacon frank and free,\
Balderclash-cum-Swinkumswash\'97that was his Curacy.\
The Rev. Willie's Rector was a delightful man,\'97\
Of all his black-coat neighbours by far the blackest swan\'97\
A man of humble thoughts was he, yet not without his pride\'97\
Pride for himself, and humble thoughts of all the world beside.\
"How do?" "how do?" the Rector spake, as Willle hove in sight,\
"You '11 find this place of mine embued, yea, steeped in holy light;\
For from myself for twenty years they've weekly preachings had,\
And all my flock are pure, save those who've taken to the bad.\
"<Your cottage is but poor I own, the furniture not rich,\
But all the blinds are new, and new the lobby door-mat, which\
Will tend towards your comfort much; the Study smokes, but still\
'lis only when the door is shut and when the air is chill."\
The Rev. Willie Wynkyn here put on a cheerful face,\
And, smiling, said he was prepared to like the peaceful place;\
He'd heard of Balderdash Defore, and what d'ye call it r too,\
And hoped to dig the vineyard well with ministrations true.)\
*' I'd offer you a glass of wine, but have mislaid the key;\
But Curates do not care for wine; nor need it as do we;\
A biscuit? No? A crust of bread? Still, No? Well! au revoir\
I'd ring the bell, but scarce worth while\'97you'll easy find the door."\
And so he bow'd the Curate out with much of nonchalance,\
And drew his hand back as he saw the Curate's hand advance j\
But that was right, for he was worth two thousand pounds a-year,\
And that's a sum can not abide a humble sixty near.\
To his new home young Wynkdt walked, revolving in his mind,\
How well 'twould be could he obtain some little boy to grind\'97\
His stipend was but sixty pounds! well, that he might endure;\
But twenty pounds must be deduct " for use of furniture."\
The Rev. Willie Wynkin sat down upon a chair,\
Then rose to open wide the door to give the chimney air;'\
Then sate him down once more, then rose again to watch it snow,\'97\
A Bishop might have been down-cast, a Curate mayn't you know.\
A knock! a note is handed in. "The Rectory!" how kind!\
The Rector, doubtless, is concerned lest I not yet have dined;\
How very thoughtful! let me see. Ah, yes !" His compliments,\
A case of cholera presses sore\'97a son of Thomas Kent's!"\
i\
j 'Twas sudden! he had scarce arrived, was hungry and at hirst;\
Besides, the Shepherd (so it seemed) should seek his lamb the first;\
The Shepherd "couldn't see it," so the Shepherd's dog was sent!\
j To keep a dog and bark himself that Shepherd never meant.\
But stay! Another paragraph! Perchance it may be found\

It is a Common Error for ladies\'97\

BODY AND SPIRIT.)\
We seem to think that we have had almost enough of Mb. Banting,\
and of the Davenpobts, and we may now remit all four (Mb. Banting\
may surely count as two) to the inevitable pantomimes. Perhaps they\
might continue to be interesting if they would combine their attractions.\
If Mb. Banting would go into the cupboard and come out two\
Bantings, of Davenpobt size, while the two Davenpobts should\
also enter and come out one Davenpobt, of Banting size, we should\
say that the Spirits were clever. The feat ought not to be impossible,\
for the showman of the Brothers deliberately told us that he had seen\
the Brothers "duplicated." We do not think that he meant that he\
had seen them coming awav from their Uncle, bearing the document\
which that relative is accustomed to grant, or that our informant in-\
tended to imply that a "brick in his hat" had caused him to see\
double, in which case there must have been Four Brothers present to\
his vision. We throw out the suggestion, for we are weary of hearing\
the names of the parties\'97and so is our friend the Public.\

"Oh! you're going to Mudcliffe, eh P" says a friend. "Hum! Let\
me see! I don't know Mudcliffe."\
"It's in Suffolk," I answer j and I'm glad to know that he is not\
acquainted with the place.\
How do you get there P" asks my friend.\
I tell him how I intend to reach Mudcliffe. I will tell you how\
I did reach Mudcliffe.\
The way by rail to Mudcliffe is a very maze of lines. During the first\
part of the journey, i. e. from London, the train progresses, I mean\
goes forward, in the usual manner. After this you go backwards, then\
forwards again, then on awkward inclines and unpleasant curves; in\
fact, you go as the nursery rhyme has it, "backwards and forwards\
and round and round," until you come to Mudcliffe. My companions\
were two gentlemen: one who put a cap on, and went comfortably to\
sleep directly he got in; the other a fidgety undecided person, who\
was evidently troubled with the fear of having left something behind.\
The first stoppage is at Barnidge Station, porters, guards and news-\
paper boys do their best to confuse a nervous traveller like myself.\
1st Guard \{with gruff voice standing by a pillar). Ba-a-arnge! Ba-a-\
arnge! (Thinks that he has done his duty, ana turns his back to the train,\
looking at nothing in particular on the other side.)\
'2nd Guard, or Inspector, or some official person with a metal chain, a\
whistle, and a key, (hurrying quickly from one end qf the train to the other).\
Budge! Budge! Budge!\
1st Guard (from pillar, sonorously, slicking to his own view qf the\
proper pronunciation). Ba-a-arnge!\
Ind Guard (evidently annoyed). Budge! Budge! Budge! (Voice is\
lost in the distance.)\
Porter (shrill tenor). Barge! Barge! (This is his idea qf the name.)\
Newspaper Man (intoning). Morning pepperrr-rr! (Last r dies away\
somewhere in his necktie.) Morning pepperrrrrrr!\
Newspaper Boy (sharply). Day's Times, Telegraph, Stannard. This\
Sweeks\'ab\'ab\'abj Trayted Lunnonnem, Bellsslife, &c. &c.\
Elderly Passenger. Here, boy, have you got a Times?\
Boy (unable to stop himself). Day's Times, Telegraph, Stannard. This\
Sweek.W/xj Trayted Lunnun News (gives paper) Beluslife.\
Elderly Passenger. Give me change! (Gives sixpence to boy.)\
Boy, slightly incommoded with papers under his arms, dives with\
one hand for coppers; the sixpence being firmly held between his\
teeth, he still goes on mechanically through his nose, Dayzzimet, Em-\
graph, Annard, Issweeks-irri-irri-irre (gives change, gets sixpence out cf\
his mouth and finishes freely,) illus Trayted Lunnunnews, Bellsslife, &c.\
&c.\
Chorus of Guards!Porters and Inspectors. Ba-a-arnge! Budge! Barge!\
Bnige! Bnnnidge!\
In comes a train on the other side; all the old confusion over again,\
with an additional cry of " Change here for Hevenham, Halsted, Cray,\
brough, Leighton, Skiton, Shepperton, Swoffley, Tharpe."\
I did not know then what they said, but I do now. It sounded to\
me like "Change here for Heaven 'stedborrow late button Everton\
Toffev Harp," and then byway of making it clearer, another intelligent\
guard sang out, "All Passengers for Heavensbro' Sledlaytonsbuttons\
Hepton Sofiley Tharpe."\
Now whether Mudcliffe was among these names or not I defy the\
most acute ear to distinguish. I, the Nervous Traveller, put my head\
out of window to make inquiries.\
Nervous Traveller (half out qf window). Do I change for\
Brisk Porter (makinga dash at the door). Change here for 'Evensbro*,\
&C. (Anything he likes to say: opens door suddenly, and Nervous\
Traveller is only saved from coming on his head by clutching at the\
window!)\
Nervous Traveller (on step remonstrating). Now, my good man, this\
is really very dangerous.\
Guard (with metal chain, whistle, key, and a watch, coming up). Now-\
then, Sir, get in, please.\
Nervous Traveller. Oh! Then we don't change for\
Guard (sternly coming to the point). Where are you for, SirP\
Nervous Traveller. For\'97(forgets)\'97for\'97oh yes\'97for Mudcliffe.\

203\
Guard (pooh-poohing the idea of changing for Mudcliffe as utterly\
absurd, and by the tone of his voice, rather looting down upon any person\
going to Mudcliffe). Oh no, Sir. Don't change till you come to Spraw-\
ton. Now, Sir, get in, we 're late.\
I get in, and then he shuts the door with such a bang as gives me a\
headache for the next quarter of an hour.\
Guard (speaking to some one a long way off). All right!\
On some one a long way off intimating that he is all right, Guard\
holds up his hand, and blows his whistle; the engine gives a powerful\
steam imitation of this, and then the train begins to jerk itself into its\
course again.\
Undecided Passenger (waking up at the last moment). Oh! ah! (Yes,\
I '11 have a Times. Hi! Boy! Newspaper!\
Porter. Here! Hi! Paper 1 (Train moves on.)\
Boy (running up as quickly as he can). Day's Times, Telegraph, Stan-\
nar\'97(put of breath. Train increasing its speed).\
Undecided Passenger. Here, I '11 have a\'97no\'97I '11\'97have you got a\
Sunday Times!'\
Boy (pertinaciously). Day's Times, Telegraph, Stannar\'97(Traingetting\
to the end of the platform.)\
Undecided One (catching last name). Yes, a Standard. (Gives a shil-\
ling/. Boy gives Standard.) Here, change! (Boy struggles with his\
papers and pockets.)\
Guard \{pushing Boy from carriage). Get away!\
Undecided One (frantically). Here hi! Change! (Engine screams.\
Train moves rapidly out of the Station.)\
Undecided One, still with a lingering hope that the Boy will be able\
to catch them up, or that he may see him again at the next Station, sits\
down, and tries to read his paper by the dim oil-lamp.\
Sleepy Passenger (suddenly waking up, slowly). Where are we?\
Nervous Traveller (myself, cautiously). We've just left Barnidge.\
Sleepy Passenger. Hey! Barnidge! Why I ought to have got out\
at Barnidge!\
Nobody pities him: in railway travelling nobody ever pities anybody\
under these circumstances.\
The next Station is Sadness. Here they examine tickets and make\
little holes in them with a sharp instrument not unlike a Champagne\
wire-cutter.\
Guard. Tickets, please!\
Sleepy One (now wide awake). Oh! here's my ticket; you see it's for\
Barnidge. I ought to have got out at Barnidge. but I never heard\
them call. (Forgets to state that he was fast asleep.) You Bee I was\
going to get ont at Barnidge, and\'97(commences an elaborate statement,\
under the impression that, if he doesn't make some plausible defence of his\
conduct, he 11 be brought up before an Inspector, or a Board of Directors,\
or fined forty shillings by a bye-law, or something unpleasant).\
Guard (cutting the statement short). You.'d better get out, Sir,'and\
go to Barnidge by the next train.\
Sleepy One (much relieved by the simplicity of the remedy). Oh, yes!\
When's that?\
Guard. In two hours' time. (The Sleeper Awakened, says to himself,\
"Two hours, eh?" and begins taking off hit cap). Ticket, Sir, please.\
(Insinuatingly to Undecided Passenger.)\
Undecided One (who has been feeling in all his pockets during the above\
dialogue, recommences his search). Dear me! I had it\'97only just now:\
somewhere. Now what the deuce did I do with it f (Jumps up and\
inspects the cushion and the crevices ineffectually.) I had it. (Kepeats\
the consoling fact to himself.) I had it: 1 know I had it. (Stands up\
and looks in the umbrella netting over, his head. Sleepy Passenper, who\
was about to leave the carriage, becomes interested in the proceeding?)\
Guard (impatiently). Now, Sir!\
With that true charity peculiar to railway travellers, we, for I am\
sure the sleepy companion shares my feelings, are inclined to chuckle\
over our fellow-traveller's misfortune: nor oy the way do we in truth\
give him credit for too much honesty. If he finds Lis ticket, he has\
merely got that with which he ought to be provided; if he fails, it's\
nothing more than we have expected. The sleepy gentleman suggests\
several possible places where it might be, but isn't; so finally comes to\
the conclusion that "he must have dropped it out of window." It\
finally comes out of his pocket-handkerchief like a conjuring trick. "All\
right!" Whistle, and we are off again. The Undecided One's face\
beams with.satisfaction; I,do not think that we are particularly delighted,\
perhaps, on the whole, somewhat disappointed; but anyhow I had\
Suite forgotten to ask whether I changed here for Mudcliffe. I sud-\
enly thought of this one minute and a half after we had quitted the\
Station.\
"Sir," said I, nervously, to the undecided gentleman, "Do you\
know where we change for Mudcliffe?"\
"Mudcliffe," says he, as if puzzling over the name, "Mudcliffe, I\
don't think this train goes to Mudcliffe at all."\
"Oh, yes, it does! interrupts, dreamily, my sleepy friend, who has\
readjusted his cap and is again about to give himself up to slumber.\
I could have embraced him. "But you change somewhere."\
Yes, I changed somewhere, I knew this.\
"And," continues Sleepy, " 1 fancy you ought to have got out at the\
1\
last Station." After the delivery of this cheerful opinion, he went to\
sleep.\
"Look here," says Undecided, "Here's Bradshaw. You leave\
Lon'on at 2.45, and\'97no, that only goes to Barnidge\'97ah! here it is\'97\
Mudcliffe, it's on a loop line\'97yes\'97you leave London at 3."\'97\
"Yes, I left London at 3 5." 1\
"Yes, and\'97you go straight on to\'97yes\'97Barnidge\'97and [then to\
Sudness\'97and then It doesn't seem as if any train stopped at\
Mudcliffe! Oh, I beg pard\'97I've got the Sunday Trains."\
Undecided One kindly begins now examining the Week-day Trains.\
Undecided Passenger (reading). Sudness\'97yes\'97let me see. Sudness.\
Sleepy One (who has been snoozing, suddenly starts up). Good gracious!\
Ourselves (much startled). What!\
Sleepy One (in horror). Why, I ought to have got out at Sudness!\
And so he ought, seeing that his ticket was only for Barnidge.\
Another Station.\
Bruffela! Bruffela; that can't be the name. No, I read it. Brom-\
field. "Change here for Halstn, Sisill, and Mliffe;" i.e., for Halaton,\
Siswell, and Mudcliffe.\
And I get out, with my sleepy companion, accordingly.]\
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER STILL SUCCEEDS."\
S somebody is somewhere\
said to have told somebody\
that nothing in the world\
succeeds like success, per-\
haps in the dramatic world\
this axiom holds good, at any\
rate dramatic Managers ap-\
pear to have some faith in\
it. Of course nobody would\
dream of being impolite\
enough to say they ever have\
been known to stoop to\
downright plagiary; still it\
is curious to note the fre-\
quent cases of coincidence,\
wherein it happens that no\
sooner does a piece become\
successful than a piece pre-\
cisely like it is brought out\
somewhere else. Directly a\
trump card is played at any\
theatre, there are a score of\
other players quite prepared\
to follow suit. No sooner\
did the Colleen Bawn attract\
at the Adelphi than sensa-\
tion scenes became the order\
of the day\'97that is, the day\
dramatic, which begins at\
seven at night. Splendid " headers" might be seen in all parts of\
the Town, and splendid tailors went to see them, as well as other\
people. So again, as any student of the playbills may discover,\
now that Swells at the West End are rushing every evening to\
see The Streets of London, the Snobs of Shorediteh are invited to\
walk up and behold The Thoroughfares of the Metropolis, or some such\
named a piece. Probably ere long the success of The King's Butterfly\
will tempt some one or other to bring out The Czar's Lady Long-\
legs, or The Emperor's Dragon-fly, or else The Sultan's Moth. If the\
game of Foliow-my-Leader continue to-be popular, we shall very likely\
find that the success of Milky White is succeeded somewhere else by\
the triumph of Sky Blue; while perhaps somewhere or other we shall\
shortly see announced a mystifying melodrama, which will be entitled\
The Concealed Conjunction, and will be produced in consequence of the\
success of what our Cockney friends persist in calling The]ldden 'And.\

FLOWERS FROM LE FOLLET.\
Op a truth Le Follet is a periodical which may, with peculiar justice, be said to be admirably\
conducted. The precision with which its contents are adapted to the fashionable female intellect\
is wonderful. It is a marvel to see how carefully they are limited for the most part to the weakest\
feminine capacity; how exclusively addressed to those intellectual faculties which lie just above\
the external senses, and to the sole sentiment of love-of-approbation. To be capable of weeding\
many pages of descriptive letter-press, any rational creature's writing, of nearly every expression\
of anything like thought or feeling, argues no fool. The ability to indite such matter without\
effort is a sort of genius. But the crowning grace of this sort of composition is the exceptional\
touch, occasionally introduced, of a remark that approaches to the nature of a reflection, and indi-\
cates a trace, as it were, of rei.son and moral sense. Because completeness is hereby given to a\
style the reflex of the mind which, amongst women, is occupied with dress, as that of the common\
with I\
of the Foiled 1\
run of men is\
joined is a rich\
manner:\'97\
"Why do young, rich, _\
wearing dresses decidedly mourning in their\
anoc, auch as a black or black and grey' robe,\
trimmed with jet, and earrings and buckle to match *.\
It must be allowed that sombre colours are better\
for the complexion; and black, especially, is Tcry\
becoming to almost every one. This, then, may be\
the true cause for its preference, and so good * one\
that we noed seek no other."\
There is a gentle effort of thought in tha\
problem above proposed, and a contentment\
as to causality in the hypothesis of its explsv\
nation, which any man. whose experience of\
female society has included its fashionable\
part, will recognise as characteristic.\
The next paragraph approaches to poetry:\
"Now the steel-coloured and grey moire antique,\
silk grey gros grains, and grey terry velvet, are in\
demand; and who is not possessed of a black inoivs\
antique or a violet taffetas?"\
Who, indeed P What a horrid person thai\
must be who is not possessed of garments \'bb\
indispensable to any one who can even hope\
to pass for a lady as a violet taffetas or a black\
moire antique?\
- We now come to a passage which excites\
curiosity:\'97 ,\
"Evening dresses are made with pass and bssjqwas\
formed of lace and silk."\
The good old days of Adam and Eve, says\
a comic song of the last\
times\
"When ladles' sides were hooped like barrels."\
Those times have partly returned in these-\
days of Crinoline. Does the Follet mean to\
say that ladies are now to figure of an e venuag\
in a sort of hooped pans?\
The following observation on bonnets may\
be quoted for the benefit of youth happening\
to meet highly dressed beauty on what is\
genteelly termed the promenade, and at a loss\
for something to say to her:\'97\
"A branch of flowers placed on the side, sod partly\
tiled by lace orbouillonnes, comprise (?) the arraoge-\
ment of these coquettish coiffures."\
"That is a coquettish coiffure of yours," is-\
a remark with which you may accost any fair\
acquaintance whose bonnet is adorned with\
the thing in question. If she asks you what\
you mean, you can reply that you mean to\
pay her an elejrant compliment on the autho-\
rity of Le Follet\'97without regard to Dr.\
Johnson, whose definition of a coquette is of\
no consequence.\

THE BLACK ART AT NEWCASTLE.\
A Newcastle Solon has dismissed an application from a gentleman\
who had paid his guinea to see the Brothers Davenport in that\
enlightened centre of the coal trade. The application was made, we\
presume, under the statute 9th Geo. 1L, c. 5, which, while abolish-\
ing prosecutions for witchcraft, enacts penalties of imprisonment and\
pillory (the latter now defunct) against any person pretending to\
exercise or use any kind of witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or con-\
juration; or undertaking to tell fortunes, or pretending from skill or\
knowledge in any occult or crafty science to discover stolen goods.\
We are loth to question the wisdom of the Bench\'97even of the\
Newcastle Bench: and perhaps pretending that the "Spirits" tie\
and untie the Brothers, and carry their guitars, trumpets, and trom-\
bones whizzing round the room in the dark, may be neither pretending\
to witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration in such a sense as\
to satisfy that form of the legal mind which dispenses justice on Tyne\
side. But if these offences are properly punishable\'97and we take Mrs.\
Dohany, the Irish witch, to witness that there is nothing so likely to\
keep the Spirits down as a diet of skilly and a protracted "exhibition"\
of oakum picking, with an occasional course of crank\'97we would\
respectfully submit to the legislative wisdom that the statute might be\
improved by including the operations of "the Spirits" within its four\
corners.\
If it be worth while to protect the few silly women and sillier\
men who believe in such things, from pretended witches, wise women,\
and readers of the stars, it is surely not unreasonable to bring the\
strong grasp of the law down on those spiritual "hands" that are\
just now so busy in their vocation among the pockets of the weaker\
sort.\
Deminimis non curat lex is a. good legal maxim: and many may think\
Be ninnibus non curat lex as wholesome a rule of legislation. But if only\
wise men were legislated for, law-makers and lawyers would perish for\
want of work. Indeed, as no wise man, it is well said, ever goes to law,\
it must be taken for granted that fools are already abundantly recognised\
as having a claim to be taken in and done for by the law. We, there-\
fore, humbly submit to the Legislature, that our gulls and geese may\
not unreasonably be protected from the decoys of such skilful fowlers\
as Messrs. Home, Davenport Brothers, and Company, and should\
strongly recommend an infusion of "Sperrits" into the statute\
9 Geo. IT., c. 5.\
It may he hard on such time-honoured impostors as witches, star-\
gazers, and wise women, to be bracket .ted with anything so new and so\
shallow as the Spirit-mongers, and we are willing to make considerable\
allowance for their feelings. We would even agree to waive the\
offensive link of in pari materia, and to give the older rogues a section\
to themselves; thus acknowledging the trade in illicit "Sperrits" to be\
the lowest form which the knave has as yet assumed in his world-wide\
and age-long warfare on the fool.\
THE MILDEST OF HINTS TO A VERY GREAT\
PERSONAGE.\
Mr dear George,\
Everything that you say deserves to be listened to with\
abject attention, and to be printed in letters of gold. For this reason,\
and because the actors on the stage make so much noise with their\
absurd dialogue, while you are discoursing wisdom in your private box,\
that the other night I could hear only about two-thirds of what you\
were saying (and yet you spoke with a noble loudness), I wish you\
would hang your handkerchief over the front of the box when you want\
to talk. Then the stupid players would see it, and take it as a signal to\
stop their bosh until you should have spoken all your pearls and dia-\
monds. I am sure that you will take this hint in the spirit in which it\
is given, for you are the best of good fellows, and a very zealous Com-\
mander-in-Chief, and I have always been very kind to you\'97you know\
tnat- Ever your affectionate Cousin,\
St. Merman's Day. Punch.\

KNOTTY POINTS IN SPIRITUALISM.\
My dear Mr. Punch,\
I am an old woman living far away from your great Metropolis,\
and am, therefore, in point of personal knowledge of what is going on\
there, just on a par with my little Welsh maid. The rural postman\
very otten crosses the ferry solely for my convenience, and on him we\
depend for our earliest and latest intelligence. I have my Punch sup-\
plied regularly, and am grateful to be able to read it, at seventy-five,\
without spectacles. This keeps me well posted in politics, and enables\
me to watch the movements of all the Crowned Heads of Europe. On\
dits and fashionable tittle tattle I get from my nephew, who is a punc-\
tual correspondent and a Special Pleader in Fox Court (am I right?\
my memory sometimes trips over names), Temple. I had almost for-\
gotten my Herald, but of course without that I could not enjoy my\
afternoon's nap at all.\
From these sources I learn that your London Lions just now are\
two spirited young men called the Devonport or Plymouth Brothers\'97\
I really can't remember which. As far as I can unravel their history,\
these wild young men repudiate all human ties, excepting, of course,\
those of a purely moral nature, such as honestry, integrity, and so on.\
This is singular, considering they come from the United States, where\
a majority make a whimsical virtue of holding tight, and are very angry\
witb people who wish to let go.\
If there is any truth in what I read, there is really no security for our\
packages at home or abroad. The Parcels' Companies are, I under-\
stand, at their wits' ends. This morning I received a hamper from my\
niece, who lives only six miles from here, and which should have been\
full of Ribston Pippins, but was not. When I complained to Stumps,\
the carrier, about it, he answered me rather impertinently in these very\
words: "You see, Marm, since them there Sperets took to undoing of\
knots, we can't be answerable for any losses. They has a finger now in\
everything: and if they don't eat Pippins theirselves, they tips a wink\
to our dog, and encourages him to!"\
I remember, when a girl, reading in History that Gordius, King of\
Phrygia, tied a knot of cords, on which the Empire of Asia depended,\
in so very intricate a manner that Alexander the Great, unable to\
unravel it, cut it in pieces. Now, it does appear very odd to me, that\
so powerful a potentate as Alexander\'97not. remarkable for temperance\
either\'97should not call for Spirits to undo that Gordian Knot, instead\
of letting himself down to a pair of scissors. But perhaps it may be\
said that such a holy alliance at that early period was impracticable.\
I suppose it is only volatile Spirits that, m imitation of mushrooms,\
spring up in a night; and that less ardent Spirits are like spinach,\
and take time to grow.\
The Corporation will, of course, as is usual in reference to distin-\
guished foreigners, present these Plymouth Brothers with their free-\
dom, though it seems superfluous when they can obtain as much freedom\
as they desire without it. Two Companies, I understand, claim the\
honour of enrolling them\'97the Spectacle-Makers, and, unless my\
memory fails me, the Cordwinders. I should be glad, however, if some-\
thing could be done to relieve the poor distressed Spirits who perform\
all the knotty work, for so much exertion in a rope-walk must be very\
fatiguing, and I wonder that among their liberal patrons no one has\
thought of finding some more creditable employment for them in a\
different line.\
As you have great influence, my dear Mr. Punch with the beau-monde,\
pray urge this humane mission upon them, and oblige\
Your constant reader,\
Sarah Oldcastlb.\
P.S. Don't you think we have very singular weather? My nephew\
writes me that on riding through the City early on Lord Mayor's Day,\
he was overtaken by hail-storms!\'97a remarkable phenomenon at this\
time of year. * * * Dear me! what mistakes I make! On look-\
ing again at my nephew's letter, I find it was not hail storms but\
Stormps Hale by whom he was overtaken. I'm sure I humbly beg\
his pardon.\

\
SUPPLEMENTAL SPEECH AT THE BANGOB DINNER.\
HEM M. ToUTlIONtEIL had\
proposed the health of\
Mr. Serjt. Buzfuz,\
Ma. Cheeks, Q.C.,\
said he rose in the\
absence of Sebjeant\
Buzfuz to return\
thanks. The learned\
Serjeant was not there,\
la fact he could not\
be there. Sebjeant\
Buzfcz had been in-\
vented by the same\
distinguished genius\
as that which had in-\
vented Mks. Habbis.\
There was, in short,\
no such person as\
Sebjeant Buzfuz.\
At least, there was no\
such member of the\
Bar. There existed\
no barrister who could\
accept a brief, with\
fraud on the face of it,\
at the hands of a no-\
toriously disreputable\
attorney. Counsel, it\
was true, accepted briefs asking no questions, but that was be-\
cause they reposed unbounded confidence in a respectable attorney.\
Otherwise an advocate would be no better than a fence. They\
were satisfied that the attorney from whom they took the brief\
was incapable of constituting himself the agent of an obvious rogue\
in an attempt to extort money by perjury through the means of\
law. The barrister was an English gentleman, and would never\
constitute himself a skeleton-key in the hand of a legal house-breaker.\
A barrister would think twice, and much oftener than twice, before\
he would sell himself to conduct a prosecution that might entail\
ruin on an innocent man. To secure himself from thus being possibly\
unawares made, the tool of malice or dishonesty, he would, as counsel\
for the plaintiff, always confine himself strictly to fair argument, based\
logically on the facts of his brief, and would ever carefully avoid the\
untruthfulness of affecting indignation, or any other sentiment which\
he did not actually feel, on behalf of his client. If ever, therefore, a\
defendant happened to be unjustly cast for damages, it was by one of\
those inscrutable dispensations by which occasional failure is incidental\
to even the most perfect of human institutions. Counsel, whether\
engaged for the prosecution or the defence, would never try to confuse\
a witness so as to get a lie told by the witness's mouth to the jury.\
"Consider," said the learned gentleman, "what a fearful state of\
society we should be living in were the morality of the Bar so lax that\
a cynic might with truth assert that there was nobody wishing to rob\
another either of property or of good name by a lawsuit who could\
not find an attorney to take his instructions, knowing them to be false,\
and a barrister hired by the attorney, who would carry them out to the\
best of his ability, and enforce them with all the arts of eloquence at\
his command, regardless of their truth or falsehood, and even sus-\
pecting their falsehood. No; the Bar is as pure as the Bench; but\
were fraudulent actions for breach of promise of marriage, and other\
false pretences, common things, it could with truth be said that the\
lpng robe passes for being as stainless as the ermine only because the\
stains do not show upon its colour."\
pretends or professes, and not that he claims, to be or do it. What is\
our objection to the word " claim" in the sense of "pretend?" Why\
should we not welcome a word enriching our language with a syno-\
nym, even when it comes from America? Because "claim" in the\
sense in which it is, as above, employed by Americans, is a euphemism\
for words which plainly impute deception, and its customary use\
implies the habitual extenuation of fraudulence prevalent amongst the\
people who are accustomed to use it. If ever we get generally to say\
claim instead of pretend, there will be good reason to doubt that we\
are as honest and truthful a nation as we claim to be considered.\
AVOID AMERICANISMS.\
Solicitude for the English language compels us to quote the follow-\
ing telegraphic message from New York:\'97\
"Fourteen of the Vermont raiders have been captured and imprisoned at St.\
John's, Canada East. Two of them claim to hold officers' commissions in the\
Confederate service."\
"To claim," according to Db. Johnson, is "to demand of right, to\
require authoritatively." In the statement above cited, it is alleged\
that two "raiders," who had fallen into the hands of the Federals, claim\
to hold commissions in the service of the Federals' enemies. As if we\
were meant to understand that it was in the power of their captors not\
only to prevent them from serving as officers on the other side, but also\
to grant or refuse them commissions to serve on that side, and tight\
those who had captured them.\
We beg that, whenever any of our readers, and especially our\
brethren of the minor Press, have occasion to say that a person pretends\
or professes to be or to do this, that, or the other, they will say that he\
THE OEACLE OF DELPHI COMPANY (LIMITED).\
PROSPECTUS.\
This Society has been formed for the purpose of extracting coin of\
the realm from the pockets of a confiding public, and performing the\
wondrous operation of raising the wind by spiritual agency.\
The facts of modern and ancient Spiritualism exhibit a closeness of\
resemblance which demonstrates the unity of their causation, and the\
identity of the classic Pythoness with the modern Medium. The differ-\
ence between them is as that between a table and a three-legged stool;\
which is not essential.\
Abundant experience of spiritualistic phenomena has convinced the\
promoters of the undertaking which, under the above title, is proposed\
to capitalists, that the tripod, ex quoth ligno, might, for every practical\
purpose, be successfully substituted for the mahogany.\
They have secured the services of a powerful female Medium capable\
of going at will into convulsions so strong that it requires six men to\
hold her. They have also got a three-legged stool, and a structure\
which has been fabricated to contain the stool and the Medium who\
will sit upon it; the whole arrangement thus combined constituting the\
Orach? from which responses will be delivered, on stated terms.\
The number of patients whom Spiritualism has contributed to lunatic\
asylums, and the yet greater number who are still at large, afford safe\
grounds of expectation that the success of the Oracle of Delphi Com-\
pany will furnish its shareholders with a triumphant answer to the\
question, "What is the use of Spiritualism?"\
As the afflatus supposed to actuate the Medium will not be ascribed\
to any heathen deity, but declared to emanate from Spirits, no fear need\
be entertained that the Oracle will offend the religious convictions of a\
serious public.\
The impunity which the Brothers Davenpobt have experienced must\
suffice to dispel all fear that the operations of this Company will subject\
those employed in carrying them out to the unpleasantness of imprison-\
ment and hard labour. The known respectability of its projectors will\
preclude any idea, on the part of the most suspicious individuals, that,\
if remittances were sent to them for subscriptions, they would bolt with\
the money.\

PROSPECTUS.\
(Private and Confidential.)\
It being considered in accordance with the spirit of the age, the\
march of intellect, and the principles of progress, that those persons\
who are unfortunate enough to come under the unfavourable notice of\
tribunals established in unenlightened times, should be enabled to\
avail themselves of systematic arrangements for defeating the coarse\
and selfish tyranny of the Many, an Association is in course of formation\
with the following objects :\'97\
To defend, in the best and most costly manner, all persons who,\
being Assured in the projected Society, shall be afflicted by prosecu-\
tions.\
To supply, with the aid of practised writers, sensation articles to\
such newspapers as can be induced to accept them, such articles being\
framed in favour of convicted persons, and designed to produce a popu-\
lar impression in their favour, by attacking the witnesses against them,\
vilifying hostile counsel, and ridiculing jurymen.\
To procure other articles, |in a graver tone, in which every mistake\
previously made by what is called Justice shall be held up as an awful\
warning, and in which intimidation shall be freely directed against\
Judges, Home Secretaries, and all who are charged with carrying the\
laws into etfect.\
To collect, after verdicts have been given, every kind of gossip,\
rumour, or invention that can discredit the case for the prosecution,\
and to circulate such things as largely as possible by means of the\
Press.\
To get up petitions in favour of the convicted persons, some of such\
petitions to be framed so as to command the approbation of those who\
object to the special form of punishment that may have been awarded,\
and without reference to the innocence or guilt of the convicted\
parties.\
It is believed, and experience warrants the belief, that by the\
irregular use of these and similar means, a criminal trial will speedily he\
deprived of its antiquated solemnity and terror, and that the odds in\
favour of the ultimate escape of the Assured will be very heavy indeed.\
To the objection of the prejudiced, that such a system is unconstitu-\
tional, and tends to the subversion of the rules by which Society is now\
protected, the promoters would reply, that the march of intellect, the\
spirit of the age, and the principles of progress, render such a canl\
futile in the extremest degree.\
A more detailed prospectus will speedily be issued, with Assurance\
Tables prepared for the information of those who, with a wise fore-\
thought, look forward to their probably coming into collision with con-\
ventional arrangements, but who, owing to the uncertainties of life,\
may not be aware whether such collision will be occasioned by murder,\
manslaughter, burglary, highway robbery, garottinsr, embezzlement,\
theft, or any other departure from ordinary rules. The Rates will be\
carefully calculated, and brought within the means of all.\
Further information may be obtained either of Jonathan Wild, Esq.,\
Solicitor, Field Lane; or of Messrs. Alibi, Dodge, & Cuammek,\

There has lately been an oyster-show in Paris, at the Garden of\

ones from Ostend," some "large ordinaries from Havre," and some\
"foreigners from London." For ordinaries of any sort we have little\
taste, nor have we much liking for the foreigners we sometimes come\
across in London. But for little fat oysters\'97infant Bantings we may\
call them\'97we always have a relish j and if the Acclimatising Gardeners,\
just by way of an experiment, would plant some in our larder, we should\
be most happy to give a good account of them.\

IMAGINARY BIOGRAPHY.\
BELL'S LIFE.\
The exact time and place of Mr. Bell's birth we have not been able\
to ferret out, but he is reported to have been born in Cambridgeshire, in\
the Second October (whenever that may be), and in Leap Year.\
Connected as he was with Lords, there is good ground for asserting\
that his relations were decidedly aristocratic, and from the interest Mr.\
Bell, always took in the Cbsarewitch and the Grand Duke Michael,\
it is not unlikely that there had been some intercourse between his\
family and the Court of Russia. That there were close ties between\
the Wagers and himself is indisputable, for with them he was mixed\
up all his life. His mother, a skilful horsewoman, and remarkable for\
her elegant carriage, was a great belle and reigning toast of the day,\
beating all her rivals by a neck. Growing into a woman of ample pro-\
portions, and bearing the name of Elizabeth, her distinguished son,\
when in a sportive,mood, would speak of her as a heavy Bet; and\
after her portrait was taken, and its merits were canvassed in the\
family circle, he invariablv referred to the picture as a drawn Bet.\
The child is father to the man; and it is instructive to, trace in the\
dawn of young Bell's life indications of his future tastes and pursuits.\
"Coming events," &c. One of his contemporaries remembers that he\
would neglect all his other toys for a little mill, and that his favourite\
amusement was playing at horses. Another recalls his partiality for\
chestnuts (to the last Mr. Bell's favourite colour); nis fondness\
(unlike most children) for sweeps; his aversion to paying forfeit in\
their Christmas games; and his eagerness to be pony when old enough\
to play at cards. Like many other celebrated Englishmen, the subject\
of this biography does (not appear to have been in good form in his\
school career, for there is no record of his ever taking part in the half-\
yearly contests for elegantly-bound books at the Academy where he\
was a pupil. His interest in prize-fights arose at a later date.\
On leaving school he got into harness at once, and buckling-to with a\
determination to win, soon distanced all his competitors in the race. Of\
Mr. Bell's successful exertions as a great paper-maker, it is needless\
to speak. His name is known everywhere: from Cowes to the Calf of\
Man. from Hudson's Bay to the Black Sea. In front parlours and back-\
woods; in the bush and on the branch railway; at the diggings and\
amongst minors; at the clubs and in the hands of Majors; in steam-\
packets and newspaper parcels; in business circles and fashionable\
squares; at steeple-chaces and beneath the Abbey towers; in woods\
and forests, and Government offices generally; by the cover-side and\
over the^dinner-table; at the meet and after the pudding; on lochs and\
quays; on piers and commons; in livery-stables and Opera-stalls; in\
shooting-boxes in the Highlands and before elephants' trunks in\
the jungle ; \'95 at spas and fights'; in grand stands and fine seats; on the\
Moors and at the " Spaniards;" amongst Turks and ottomans, smooth\
bores and rough customers; in the midst of savage tribes and abo-\
riginal races; at the "Alhambra" and in the Vatican\'97we hear, read,\
see, and'quote Mr. Bell, and never cease to discuss and subscribe to\
his opinions.\
He was fortunate enough to marry early in life, and to make a good\
match, and every year, as the Race week came round, he would refer to\
Ascot as " the course of true love," because it was there he first met\
Mrs. Bell; and on each anniversary of the wedding;day it was as good\
as gold to listen to his recommendation of the Ring, as containing\
within its circle all imaginable happiness. Reference has been made to\
his jocular sayings. One or two more hits are placed to his score. A\
spectator of the greatest yacht-race but one of the whole year, he termed\
it the Leger-de-main; and on the same occasion excused himself for\
putting a question to the man at the wheel by saying that he understood\
him to be the spokesman. His epitaph on a noted pedestrian de-\
serves a niche in this biography\'97"Requiescat in pace;" and the\
humorous turn of his mind displayed itself forcibly in the song he\
always made choice of to sing after the dinner which closed the season\
of the boating club of which he was a member\'97" The Latt Rows of\
Summer."\
Thoroughly appreciating all our best authors, he gave the preference\
to those who were remarkable for a racy style, and m whose works the\
fancy predominated: of our poets he was biassed in favour of Bowles.\
Orderly and methodical in his habits, he could not bear things to be at\
sixes and sevens, but he delighted in fives. Jackson's portrait of him\
(taken at Kennington) shows a man with a face of the oval shape, and\
a form " of the manliest beauty." \'95\
Mr. Bell lived to an advanced age, although he was in the habit of\
taking his own life every week. To the finish he would issue forth with\
a good staff, and there was nothing he liked so well as a brisk circula-\
tion. Loved by his equals and respected by his betters, when at length\
his race was run, obituarists spoke of him as a stable friend, but not one\
to be jockeyed, as invariably preserving an even temper, though the\
odds might be heavily against him, and as a man who, if he trolled a\
catch never fished for a compliment\'97if he hedged a bet, never fenced a\
question.\

pleasure as I rise to respond to the toast of the 'Onourable Corpora-\

around me and sees the many eminent pussonages of our nobility,\

werry kind on him to come all this distance, as the passage from\
Bullown to Folkestone ain't that pleasant to some people, as I well\

I says, as I said afore, that when I see so many distinguished phases,\
I feel proud of bein' a member of the ancient Corporation. (Ear,\

TTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER BORROWING.\
We cannot help quoting the subjoined passage from the eloquent\
address delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the\
closing of the North London Industrial Exhibition:\'97\
"If it be closed, it is closed like the com which you drop into the earth, and\
which is placed there in order that its death may be the precursor of renovated life\
and new fertility."\
Mr. Gladstone's hearers cheered this comparison, and well they\
might. It was not exactly original; but never mind. Although you\
must not rob Peter to pay Paul, you are at liberty, however, to borrow\
from Paul; and even in robbing Paul of an illustration, the learned\
Member for Oxford might justly say, Furto Utlamur in ipso. We trust\
that he will some day devise a system of equitable taxation, which, if it\
now existed, would enable us to say that nobody but Paul is robbed by\
the Chancellor op the Exchequer.\

is merely wanted for the purpose of joining in the chorus\

CONSCIENCE MONEY.\
(highly probable.)\
The Chancellor op the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of\
the following sums, which have been sent him as Conscience Money, to\
be applied to the reduction of the Income-Tax:\'97\
A Virtuous Cabman.\'97Sixpence: a half-crown having been given\
him by mistake instead of his just fare, a florin.\
A Done Old Clothes-Man.\'97A farthing, which he found in the\
pocket of a pair of trousers, for which he gave very little under their\
value, because be felt the corn during negotiations, and thought it might\
be a sovereign.\
A Boxkeeper.\'97Nine-and-sixpence; being the balance of a half-\
sovereign paid to him as a sixpence by an inebriated patron of the\
Sensation Drama.\
A Student.\'97An old five-pound note, found in a copy of the Whole\
Duty of Man which he procured at a book-stall, and would have paid\
for, but that the old lady-proprietor was not looking his way.\
A Bathing-Woman.\'97Five shillings- being the proceeds, less deduc-\
tion for necessary expenses, of the produce of a gold watch found in a\
bathing-machine, and which watch the lady who asserted that she had\
lost it failed to describe with the perfect accuracy necessary to satisfy\
the finder's conscience that it would be right to give up the article.\
A Margate Lodging-Keeper.\'97Five tons, discovered (with English\
money) in a dressing-glass drawer.\
A Turnpike Man.\'97Fourpence, which he charged a second time,\
owing to his having accidentally forgotten the number of the day, and\
having compelled a person who remembered it to pay twice.\
A Penitent Pew-Opener.\'97One shilling, thoughtlessly taken from\
a couple of little children who had been told to put it into the plate,\
and who supposed that she was the collector.\
A Touting Photographer.\'97Half-a-crown, paid by a poor maid-\
servant for a portrait so abominably bad that she cried, and would not\
take it away.\
A Summoneb op Juries.\'97A sovereign, given by an author whom\
the S. J. had already summoned nine times in ten months, knowing\
that he was good pay for exemption.\
An Old Party in Charge op a House.\'97A penny, paid to her\
(instead of for a jam tart) by a little boy whose cap had been thrown\
into the area by a big lad, and which cap the Old Party said\'97and is\
sorry she said\'97that she wasn't going to be bothered to pitch up for\
nothing.\
THE LEADER OF THE LIBERALS.\
Said the Times, the other day, anent the Emperor of the French\
and his Italian policy:\'97\
"He pays the penalty sure to be incurred by such Princes as have the misfortune\
to be more liberal and enlightened than their subjects. He is obliged to adopt a\
Une of policy which does not satisfy himself, and yet which there is the greatest\
reason to believe will not satisfy them. He is obliged to defer to prejudices to\
which he is superior, and to feelings with which he has no sympathy. Anxious to\
place France in the position which she ought to occupy as a leader of the libera]\
opinion of Europe, be is constantly encountered by the fact that the nation, the\
destiny of which be directs, is devotedly attached to that very Papal Government\
from the support of whose temporal power he is gradually seeking to withdraw\
Has the Emperor, we wonder, any relish for a joke? Because, if so,\
he must i have had a hearty laugh at this. After having gagged the\
Press, the mouthpiece of enlightenment, thus to find himself described\
as "more enlightened than his subjects;" ha! ha! que e'ett drole ca.\
And then to learn that he is "anxious to assist" the liberal party,\
whose newspapers he prohibits! Ha! ha! ha.' A funny way of helping,\
truly. What a wag the writer must be who can pen so droll a\
pleasantry.\

\
PRINCE BABY'S COURT CIRCULAR.\
he great satisfaction which\
was given to the mothers of\
England by the faithful nar-\
rations about Prince Baby\
which were supplied during\
the recent tour of Prince\
Baby's Royal parents, and\
the delight which was felt in\
reading, in, a subsequent\
Court Circular, that he had\
been out for an airing, has\
induced his friend and god-\
father, Mr. Punch, to make\
arrangements for the regu-\
lar preparation of a Court\
Circular that shall be de-\
voted only to Prince\
Baby. The following is\
the chronicle of the past\
week:\'97\
Sunday. H.RH. very\
good indeed. Slightly in-\
censed after church at being\
interrupted in sucking the\
velvet on Mamma's Prayer-\
book ; but instantly pacified.\
Grabbed at a wine-glass and\
threw it down, but only laughed at the pieces, and wanted another.\
Monday. H.RH. did not cry during the whole day. Observing,\
from the window, his Royal parents going out for a ride, distinctly\
remarked "Ta-tar," innocently unconscious that they were out of\
hearing.\
Tuesday. H.R.H.'s usual amiability was disturbed by a special\
petition, on the part of his head-nurse, that he would put the coral\
into his mouth instead of Sitem, Ham, and Japhet, whom he\
endeavoured to introduce there all at onoe. He was graciously pleased,\
however, to substitute the elephants for the family of Noah.\
Wednesday. H.R.H. evinced a great desire to eat his toes. During\
a ride in the afternoon, he distinctly pointed at a horse, and made a\
remark, which the head-nurse is inclined to believe was "see," but\
which the second nurse considers to have been "gee."\
Thursday. H.RH. very sleepy; but the medical attendants did not\
think that the symptoms were m the least alarming, though his remon-\
strances on being moved certainly were. He was pleased to break a\
Sevres cup in the afternoon, and to laugh very much at the crash.\
Friday. H.R.H. much displeased at a bib being inserted under\
his double chin, and he spat out his nutriment with much vigour.\
Afterwards, a sudden clutch at his Royal mother's Dagmar brooch\
slightly hurt his hand, but he was delighted when the naughty brooch\
was well whipped.\
Saturday. H.RH. in the highest spirits, and kicking vehemently.\
An attempt to swallow his red sock was happily frustrated, and his\
Royal father's watch went into his mouth instead. He enjoyed his\
evening bath exceedingly, and utterly refused to allow himself to be\
removed from the water. At length an Angola kitten effected a diver-\
sion, and H.RH. concluded the week by going to sleep with the\
affectionate kitten's tail in his hand.\
THE GOSHAWK AND THE HEN HARRIER.\
\{To'the Honourable Grantley Berkeley.)\
Grantley,\
You 're a Spoortsman and I'm a Poacher, What's the dif-\
ference 'tween a patridge and a sparrer? That's what I says. I did\
once say I took a patridge for a sparrerhawk. 'Twas when a Geam\
keeper found me wi' the patridge. u If you'll believe me, I thought it\
was a sparrerhawk.\
You '11 say you knows better. Better about hawks P Come, now,\
Grantley. How about the Goshawk P Hears you wrote a letter\
about nn in the Times. Understand you says you shot five on 'em\
tother day in this here county. Five Goshawks. Goshawks, common\
birds in Hampshur. Hen Harriers! Them's your Hampshur Gos-\
hawks, Grantley. "By the word 'goshawk,' I suppose is meant\
the * hen harrier,' or 'ring-tailed falcon,' the male of which bird is blue."\
That's what you says. Which is wuss, Grantley Berkeley, my\
mistake or yourn?\
We ought to know summut about hawks, both on us. Birds of a\
feather, hawks, you, and me. Consarned in the pursuit o' geam. But\
I hunts wi' the owl too, when thej moon's up, for a shiny night is\
my delight in the sason o' the year. The Owl is the bird o wisdom,\
Grantley. He knows a hawk from a hen harrier. I wonder you\
don't, of all English gentleman. Thought you know'd all 'bout wood-\
craft. Falconry! Fancied you was up to all whatsomedever about\
that there, anyhow. What would are a one o' any of them there old.\
ancesters o' youm, as spent their time in nawkuti, and used to goo\
about wi' falcons on their fistes, a thought o' you if he could a foreseed\
you takun a hen harrier for a goshawk! Dost n't know that the Gos-\
| hawk was reckoned one of the first-rate hawks by them there ancient\
Barons as wore coats of arms, and went to war on hossback cased in\
iron, wi' shields and battle-axes? Dost n't know that there was long-\
wingsd hawks, that is true falcons, and short-winged hawks, my friend\
the Sparrerhawk, and the Goshawk, yourn, Grantley? And dost n't\
know that kites, and buzzards, and harriers, was counted 'mungst what\
they called the ignoble falcons P I got an old book at whoam, mun,\
tells all about it, bless 'ee.\
Goshawk, Astur Palumharius. Got a new book, too, tells all 'bout\
that likewise. Hen Harrier, Cirrus Cyaneus. Them's the lamed\
neams o' nateral history. Book 'em, Grantlby. Goo to British\
Museum up in Lunnun. There thee 'st zee Goshawk and Hen Harrier,\
both on 'em, stuffed, and by'n by lam to tell one from t'other.\
I got another book at whoam. A old book, wi' leather covers.\
Bigger than books be now-a-days. Printed in different fashioned\
letters, most wi' e's at the ends on 'em. Shakespeare! There, in\
a play, Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, says he know'd a hawk from a\
handsaw. Grantley, I doubt if thee ever didst; but arter the infa-\
ich I've a gin thee, I hopes in futur, at laste, thee know a\
DEVOTION TO MARS.\
The subjoined outburst of devotional enthusiasm, according to the\
Moniteur de I'Armee, proceeded from the lips of Lieutenant Panondu\
Hazier, commander of the French transport Licorne, at the head of a\
pilgrimage made by his crew to the temporary tomb of Napoleon the\
First at St. Helena, on the anniversary of the birth of that benefactor\
of Europe and mankind:\'97\
"This God of Battles had his agony and his Calvary! A terrible agony\'97a mys-\
terious grief which none of \\ls can comprehend. But let us reject theso melancholy\
reflections while recollecting that this God of Battles has had his resurrection."\
The resurrection of Lieutenant Hazier's God of Battles was one\
such as, before the Anatomy Act, used to be accomplished by resur-\
rectionists. It consisted in the removal of his remains to France\'97a\
sufficient paradise for such a divinity. The pious Lieutenant's Christi-\
anity is evidently that of the War Christians. He seems to confound\
the God of Battles with the Prince of Peace. Apparently, he considers\
the God of Battles to have been embodied in the form of Napoleon the\
First, and he makes the mistake of worshipping that God of Battles.\
Let us hope that he will find out his mistake in time.\

SHAKSPEARE'S LIBRARY.\
Shakspeare's Books, it seems, are being discovered in various\
directions. His Prayer Book is reported to have turned up somewhere\
in Wales, and it is probable that he took it with him there in case he\
might have to go to church while on the journey he took to get up facts\
about the Welsh lady in Henry IF. He was very particular about\
going to church, as must be clear to all students of his history and\
writings. The Dramatic Authors' Society have good hopes of dis-\
covering his Boyer's French Dictionary one of these days. We trust\
also to hear of the recovery of his Book of Cab-fares, which, as is well\
known, suggested to him the line in Macbeth, fare is foul and foul is\
fare." We fear that his last Bradshaw is destroyed, at least we have\
no evidence that the Poet imitated the one careful man of our own\
time, who binds his old Bradihaws, but his Euclid, from which he drew\
the beautiful image in the Winter's Tale, about "the Angle that plucks\
our son thither." may yet be heard of, and we shall rejoice with un-\
feigned joy to learn that his Book of Etiquette has re-appeared, from\
which no doubt he got the idea for the rule He prescribes (in Henry Fill.)\
to gentlemen who go for a walk with ladies:\'97\

Teacher icertijicated). "'Eneet, 'Enery I Where's tkr 'ands?"\
. A LETTER TO LORD WESTBURY.\
Mi Lord,\
The man who fails to recognise your Lordship's eminent\
sagacity in everything you do is a fool whom it were flattery to call a\
^rainless ass. For my part, so impressed am I with wonder at your\
ivisdom, that 1 cannot for an instant entertain the rude belief that any\
ict of yours has ever fallen short of expectation, or failed in its wise\
lim. Other persons may. however, be less awestruck than myself, and\
nay with weak credulity believe there is some truth in the following\

\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 einarks upon your Lordship's Law of Bankruptcy. You may read\
hem in the Standard of the 2nd ult.:\'97\
"The failure of tho Act of 1861 was prophesied from the first hy every one com-\
>etent to form an opinion, and is now admitted even by its author. The evils it\
ta\'ab wrought are known to every lawyer, and have been experienced by every trader\
n the country."\
It is just possible, perhaps, that your pet Act, my Lord, has failed to\
)rove so perfect as we, your admirers, thought it would; but it is not\
iredible that you yourself have been betrayed into admission of its\
ailure. Hear, however, what the Standard further has to say respect-\
ng it :\'97\
'' Every Qattttt tells how tho late Act has multiplied the number of bankruptcies;\
ivery creditor feels, every knavish debtor knows, how easy it has made the process\
f 'whitewashing.' Accounts which should havo been rendered in 1862 were not\
orthcoming rill last February. The expenses of the Court rose from \'a381,000 in\
860 to \'a3125,000 in 1868\'97an advance of more than 50 per cent. ; while tho sums\
lolleoted fell in the same period from \'a31,-250,000 to less than \'a3700,000, an absolute\
ailing off of more than half a million, though the business of the Court had\
inormously increased."\
My Lord, these statements are all false, as everybody ought to know\
! at least, for one, shall stick to it they are so; and shall continue to\
egard your Lordship's law of Bankruptcy as the brightest emanation\
rom your Lordship's brilliant brain. But, as I have hinted, other\
>eople are alive whose faith in your unerring wisdom is not so fine as\
nine; and as these persons all have tongues and pens to publish their\
\'95pinions and to damage your fair fame, it were well to take the edge off\
heir weapons of attack. Of course your Lordship will not deign to\
quabble with a scribbler, whom a word of yours would crush. But for\
the benefit of poor benighted readers of the Standard, who maybe weak\
enough to think there is some particle of truth in the remarks which. I\
have quoted, yon might command some one in Basinghall Street, who\
is well acquainted with the working of your Act, to put forth an official\
report of its success, and to furnish such good proofs of it as will refute\
the foolish slanders wherewith it is attacked.\
If to this report your Lordship will but add a few expressions "of\
your sublime contempt for the miserable drivellers who have wakened\
your just wrath, I have no doubt that the pamphlet will be greedily\
inquired for, and perused with great delight.\
Repeating my belief in your never failing wisdom, which I may almost\
say it were sheer blasphemy to doubt, I have the honour to remain,\

to deserve such patronage. Her nationality is vaunted, or he should\
not allude to it, the less that modesty is, both from religion and from\

AN INQUEST ON AN INQUEST.\
An inquest was held on Tuesday last week by Mr. Punch, upon an\
inquest which had been held the day before by Mb. W. Payne on a\
body. The circumstances of the case were these:\'97\
A Clergyman, the Rev. John Hunt, Curate of St. Botolph's, Aldgate,\
had systematically studied anatomy, for the very best of reasons, among\
them because "he held it to be his sacred duty as a theologian to\
inquire into every quarter of Nature's kingdom, to search out her\
mysteries, and see her glorious and miraculous works." He obtained,\
from a physician, the necessary means for acquiring anatomical know-\
ledge, and in so doing neither infringed the Anatomy Act nor violated\
the decencies of life or death. That which he had procured for his\
purpose was the most unobjectionable thing for it that could possibly\
be conceived. However, a churchwarden, a Mb. David Kino, found\
the thing in his possession, had suspicions about it, thought it formed a\
matter for investigation, refused to allow the case to drop, and would\
not have hushed it up for \'a31000." Accordingly, he sent to the Coro-\
ner; an inquest followed; everything was quite satisfactorily explained.\
The Coroner, in charging the jury, was pleased to remark that it was\
clear the rev. gentleman had pursued medical studies; but whether\
wisely, or not, it was not for him to say." He added, however, the\
following considerably more pertinent observation:\'97\
"Cortainly in a country district a Clergyman might be called in to a woman to\
give ber religious consolation, and it migbt so bappen tbat she might become\
suddenly ill, and bis medical assistance would be of great use."\
The jury then laid their heads together to consider their verdict, and\
the conclusion which they arrived at was as follows:\'97\
"That the deceased was stillborn, and the jury, while admitting the right of the\
Rev. Mr. Hunt to study medicine, are of opinion that it would be better if be coo-\
fined bis studies to matters of a clerical character to the exclusion of the study of\
anatomy."\
Mr. Punch, after having pointed out the logical difficulty of accepting\
the statement that the deceased" was "stillborn," said he would\
only remark that ignorance of natural knowledge, and especially of\
anatomy, was particularly objected in the present day against the clergy,\
and greatly impaired their influence and usefulness. His jury would\
now consider the verdict of that other jury, and give their own thereon.\
Without a moment's deliberation the jury empanelled by Mr. Punch\
returned a verdict of "Snobbish Impertinence." They added that,\
whilst admitting the lamentable fact that vulgar blockheads are eligible\
to serve on Coroners' juries, they are of opinion that it would be better\
that such persons should cease to be so, and should be obliged to mind\
their own business, and confine their attention to their awls, or their\
geese, or to dispensing candles, red herrings, penn'orths of cheese, balls\
of twine, small parcels of sugar, tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, vinegar, and\
pepper, and other groceries, or the like commodities, over the counter,\
to the exclusion of any office whose performance affords them an oppor-\
tunity of making uncalled-for, offensive, and ridiculous remarks on the\
meritorious conduct of gentlemen.\

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.\
hebe have been Han-\
dy-books published on\
all imaginable sub-\
jects, including some\
of those best as well\
as worst-fitted, appa-\
rently, for packing\
into the dimensions of\
a duodecimo.\
Thus, there are\
Handy-books on Law,\
teaching you every-\
thing from the myste-\
ries of an action of\
ejectment to the art\
of making your own\
will\'97a practice much\
to be recommended\
to any person with a\
proper respect for the\
legal institutions of\
the country, and a\
benevolent wish to\
distribute his pro-\
perty, after death,\
among the members of\
the legal profession.\
So we hare a Handy-\
book on the duties of Executors\'97well calculated to open the eyes of\
any one who is about to act in that capacity, to a sense of his situation;\
to show him the traps and pit-falls kindly laid by the Law to warn\
him off the very dangerous ground he is about to venture on; and, in a\
word, to make him generally uncomfortable.\
Then there are Handy-books for Unprotected Females, impressing\
such useful lessons as that all 'busses do not go to the Bank; that\
crossing a cheque is not quite as difficult an operation as crossing\
Regent Street during the height of the Season; and points of practice\
in business and money matters equally useful and comforting to the\
feminine mind.\

Or\'97if Hand-books and Handy-books may claim cousinship, and we\
only see one reason (y) they should not\'97of that greatest achievement\
in the way of handiness and condensation\'97\
Murray's Hand-books, the staff and stay of the British Tourist!\
But there is one Handy-book which remains to be written. This is\
the Handy-book of the Theatre. Mr. Punch, as the author, leading\
actor, proprietor, and manager of about the oldest theatre and most\
popular play in existence, is clearly the person to write it.\
There are reasons which make the subject particularly opportune at\
this moment. In the first place, everybody assures us that "the.\
Theatre is looking up."\
Looking at the facts, this can hardly mean that the Drama is aiming\
too high\'97firing over people's heads, trying to be sublime, or poetical,\
or imaginative, .or full of purpose, making any' absurd pretension to\
high art, or any such transcendental nonsense. No; the harshest critic\
of the Stage cannot say that our Theatre is locking up in this sense.\
But the Theatre is prosperous, popular\'97even fashionable\'97especially\
since it has had the advantage of an infusion of Parisian blood among\
the actors as well as the pieces.\
It is evident that something like a new life is stirring both before and\
behind the curtain.\
Sensation has galvanised the Stage into vitality, as it has all other\
branches of art and literature to which its enlivening stimulus has been\
applied. The Theatre never before employed such enormous capitals\'97\
at least the Posters and their print, were never so large. Pieces cau run\
their hundreds of nights now, which in less advanced times would have\
been unable to totter through a sickly month of existence; nay, would\
hardly have succeeded in keeping their legs for a first night.\
We have a highly intelligent and eagerly appreciative public, which can\
see force, meaning, and point, where our obtuse ancestors would have\
only discerned extravagance, nonsense, and vulgarity. Hardly any piece\
is brought out now-a-days but we learn, on the authority of the bills and\
the newspapers, that it is "an enormous success." And even if bills\
and articles were silent, we should be led to the same conclusion by the\
appearance of the theatre before the curtain\'97crowded stalls, private\
out\
boxes all filled, well-tenanted dress-circles and pits\'97as much as is left\
of them. As for galleries, except at Drury Lane, we won't answer.\
They appear to be considered low. Probably the people who used to\
go to the galleries on this side the water, now go to the boxes over the\
Bridges.\
The malignity of rivals, or the incredulity of cynicism, may suggest\
"paper," as the explanation of at least some of these well-Blled\
houses. One hears such sneering remarks as that "Order is Manager's\
first law;" and we know that pasteboard has been used for making\
houses elsewhere than in Japan. But if we doubted the evidence of\
audiences, we have only to read the criticisms. Criticism is emphati-\
cally a growth of our own generation. Everybody now-a-days is a\
critic. Look at the Saturday Reoiev, if you want to see the critical\
lash well laid on. And there is a whole legion of weeklies following\
suit of the Saturday, though they don't use the knout with so\
much vigour, or apply the cayenne and chili-vinegar, after flogging,\
with such evident relish. Then look at the Quarterlies. The fathers\
of the race\'97who used to have a monopoly of critical rod and gauge,\
and quite su Diced our simple fathers in the way of literary butchery\'97\
have to struggle for life with a host of young and vigorous competitors,\
and can hardly hold their own. So, if no play is ever damned now-a-\
days, and newspaper notices of new pieces are, in\
of every score, one string of praises and pieans\
and manager, it must be because the pieces are\
critics unwilling or unable to find fault.\
Perhaps Mb. Boucicadxt may have gone a little too far whan he\
fixed the profits of a well-conducted West-End theatre, of fair dimen-\
sions, at twenty thousand pounds per annum. His own successes have\
been colossal and, besides, he has the sanguine temperament of a great\
imaginative creator, and may be excused for seeing things theatrical in\
a high light. He fives in a blaze of triumph, and naturally surveys the\
profits as well as catastrophes of the Drama through a magnifying\
binocular glass, and under effects of blue and red fire. But there\
can be no doubt, to any ingenuous mind looking patent facts in the face,\
that the London theatres are flourishing\'97in every sense of the word.\
But not only is the Theatre prosperous and popular\'97it is in a\
transitional state\'97just the condition for a useful application of sound\
precepts and directions to all parties concerned in its prosperity\'97\
whether actors, managers, authors, critics, or spectators.\
For example, the weighty conclusions of old experience are, we tear,\
falling into a dangerous desuetude among actors. There are aigns,\
here and there, of 11 fatal disposition to forget that acting is an art, and,\
as an art, must be carefully kept apart from Nature. Not that this\
mischief has gone very far; but we have a few actors and actresses,\
otherwise of promise, who seem to be dropping into natural tones\
and movements, ana stooping to an imitation of everyday life, which\
is quite out of keeping with the conditions of the Stage. Thus, we\
have even seen actors of late forgetting themselves so far as to remove\
their hats when they enter a drawing-room, or pausing to salute a lady\
before beginning the words set down for them: and actresses have\
been heard to object to walking in the streets at all times of the day in\
evening dress, and without bonnets.\
These are, evidently, vicious concessions to that realism which is\
fatal, we fear, to all art, and which has already invaded the scenic\
department of the Theatre. Happily it has not yet got farther, or only\
in very few cases. Managers have not yet, we are thankful to say,\
insisted on natural action and unexaggerated delivery\'97much less on\
probable incident or possible story\'97in these rooms which the scene-\
painters build so solidly, and furnish with such completeness; or\
before the landscapes, in which the skill of a Bbveblby, a Gbieye,\
a Telbin, or a Caixcot struggles not unsuccessfully with Nature. The\
piece and the acting still bring us back to that domain of the imagina-\
tion, in which Nature is felt to be out of keeping, and imitation of\
realities impertinent.\
Even managers are by no means Ibeyond the need of some useful\
hints. Fortunately the good old rules, which prescribed the dis-\
comfort of audiences, the dirt and dinginess of private boxes, and\
the extortions of boxkeepers, as the best conditions for enhancing the\
enjoyment of the play, by operation of the well-known law of contrast,\
are still adhered to by the majority of this class. But a few mis-\
guided persons have not scrupled to substitute for these chastening\
influences, comfort, cleanliness, and civility. The effect, we need hardly\
say, has been to encourage a captious and fault-finding spirit in the\
visitors to other, and more intelligently administered, Theatres.\
Again, among actor-managers,\'97a class that now almost monopolises\
the direction ol our theatres\'97there are a few who show no sense of the\
responsibilities of their double character. They are content to figure as\
merely stock-members of their own companies; their names are not\
printed in larger letters than those of the men and women whom\
they hire and pay. Pieces are not selected with a view to the dis-\
play of their individual talent. They seem content ignobly to stand on\
common ground with the rank and file of their profession, instead of\
taking up a becoming position of pre-eminence upon the pedestal of\
their managerial dignity.\
Actor-managers must not be allowed thus to forget themselves, with-\

out an appeal to the noble example set. them in these respects by men\
who have a truer sense of the duties of their position.\
For other reasons, authors, critics, and spectators of stage-plays need\
warning, instruction, and guidance, just as much as managers and actors.\
To all these classes Mr. Punch hopes to offer practical advice of a\
highly valuable kind in his " Handy-book of.the Stage," of which this\
may be regarded as the preface.\

LETTER FROM A MAN.\
My dear Punch,\
Woman is onr Master, there is no doubt about that. But we\
have not ceded the last shred of our liberty. One privilege is reserved\
to us, as ff to remind us that we had once been the stronger. By the\
law of England we may beat, rob, insult, and in fact, inflict any outrage\
upon a woman, and (in the absence of other testimony than hers) do\
exercise these manly rights with impunity, if it happen that, by reason\
of defective theological education, she is unable to declare in a court of\
justice, that she believes in the dogma recently condemned by the Privy\
Council.\
I earnestly hope that a bold and strong stand will be made against\
the meditated attempt to deprive us of this right. I regret to sec that\
the Rev. F. Maueice joins in the cry that a woman ought not to be\
deprived of the protection of the laws merely because she does not\
believe in the Devil. Who is she, to set herself up against Him?\
An article in the Morning Star also advocates a change in the law,\
and considering that the original Morning Star was Lcciper, I consider\
the conduct of the journal as exceedingly ungrateful and unfilial. In\
other respects the article has ability and merit, and I extract a passage: \'97\
"A prisoner may call as a witness bis mother or bis daughter, bis sweetheart or\
bis mistress, and the jury will pay all proper attention, and attach all befitting\
weight to the testimony; but no British jury must be allowed to bear one word\
which a wife can say to establish the innocence other husband."\
Here I think the law may advantageously be altered, because men\
are often sufferers by the existing system. And I have the less objec-\
tion to the change, as, from what! have heard of wives, 1 believe there\
is no great danger of their abusing, by carrying to excess, the right of\
saying anything in favour of their husbands.\

THE GUILDHALL ECLOGUE.\
'Twas midnight in Guildhall. Two voices broke\
Into the darkness: Gog and Magog spoke.\
Who heard their conversation? Ask you who?\
Let Echo answer, What is that to you?\
Perchance perdu some penny-a-liner lay\
Recovering from his drunk on Lord-Mayor*s-Day;\
And crouching low where Pitt and Beckiord stand,\
Noted the talk in tremulous short-hand.\
Take thou this truth, enough for man to know,\
Punch hears of all things in this world below.\
Gog. My brother!\
Magog. You 're another.\
Gog. Repartee,\
Pleasant at times, just now delights not me.\
Restrain your wit, my Magog, and with ears\
Hear me; then, if you can, restrain your tears.\
Magog. Down Pluto's iron cheek distil the brine,\
But blow me if it wets this wood of mine.\
Gog. 'Tis sternly said, yet sternness oft can turn\
To softness. Who has blubbered more than Sterne?\
Magog. Beshrew thy quips and cranks and puns grotesque,\
Or send them for the Royalty burlesque.\
State in a jiffy what thou hast to state.\
Or let me sleep, because it 'a precious late.\
Gog. My brother!\
Magog. Bother! You said that before.\
Gog, you become a sentimental bore.\
Gog. Hear, then, and listen to a mournful tale.\
You saw the new Lord Mayor. His name is Hale.\
Magog. Do I not know it? How the changes rung\
Upon it, on the ninth, from Cockney tongue.\
"He brews good hale." "Hail in November's due."\
"'Ope he won't ail his turn of hoffice through."\
"Nay, he looks hale." "Hail, fellow, and well met,"\
With other epigrams which I forget.\
Gog. Why then rejoice the more. Bat now, I guess, J\
I rather think that you'll rejoice the less.\
That Hale, whose name should hint a flowing can,\
Has turned\'97\
Magog. What, sour?\
Gog. No, worse. A Temperauce Mail!\
Magog. You scoffed at me for jesting. At the best\
This is a very dull and pointless jest.\
Gog. O, Magog, that it were! My tale is true.\
He hath allied him with the Temperance crew;\
And at the Mansion House, yes, Magog, there,\
Hath bid them muster\'97nay, has filled the chair.\
Magog. I'm loth to doubt my brother, yet I try.\
Gog, are you telling me a\
Gog. Brother, fie!\
No, Magog, it's the truth. Our hearts may burst,\
But this is so. Tea-cups have done their worst.\
The Mayor\'97the idea, the marrow, and the pith\
Of hospitality\'97is now a Myth.\
Yes, 'twas in Egypt's Hall for him to frame |\
Unto himself a pyramid of shame:\
Yes, in that Hall whose every echo brings\
Thoughts of the shout the voice of Bacchus flings.\
Amid those columns at whose base would sink\
The Alderman disguised in robes and drink,\
Upon that dais, found, on festive eve,\
A step to elimb, a precipice to leave,\
Stood London's Mayor, and, Magog, woe is me!\
Preached moderation and a cup of tea.\
Magog. OCumming! Cumming! Cummikg!.,\
Gog. _ Come along.\
Magog. Joking is coming it a deal too strong.\

He's right\'97the world's done up, or very near.\

Gog. Nay, wilt thou not have done?\
A'pun, and Paul's Cathedral striking one._\
Magog. It strikes not one but all who view the pile,\
'Twas reared by Wren, and is in classic style;\
In Charles tee Second's time 'twas partly built,\
And on the top's a ball and cross, both gilt.\
Gog. He has gone mad. This news has been too much.\
I wish I had that weapon in his clutch.\
Magog, my brother!\
Magog. _ 0,1 know your tricks\
And manners. But in sixteen sixty-six\
This Hall was burned, rebuilt in sixty-nine,\
Since when it's witnessed many a glorious shine.\
William or Orange came here to a feast,\
And never got excited in the least.\
So did the Sovereigns, when we'd put down Nap,\
So did his Nephew, that long-headed chap,\
So did Prince Albert, and it's very plain\
We shall not look upon their like again.\
Gog. There, go to sleep\'97you're maundering, which is sad.\
I own that things are looking precious bad,\
But Hale's an annual, and our friends may choose\
Next time a magistrate of sounder views.\
Magog. No: mark my words, and bid thy heart despair,\
Next year will bring us a Tea-total Mayor.\
Gog. Why then, indeed, it will be time to weep\
Water for water. Now let's go to sleep.\
AN IN-S0LBNT REMARK.\
A New York journal states that Captain (Alabama) Semmes\'97\
"Has obtained another ship, and under the name of Smith baa reached Havannah\
in the Solent."\
Havannah in the Solent! We suppose we next shall hear of Manilla\
in the Thames I But the fright that the New Yorkers must have been\
thrown in by the mention of the name of Captain Semmes, may have\
possibly prevented their discovering the little geographical mistake.\
We can relieve their minds by stating, on " reliable" authority (we use\
their own pet word), that Captain Semmes is snug and safe in the\
Solent, near Southampton, and that the new vessel which he has just\
"obtained," is one of the new Ryde and Portsmouth ferry steamboats.\
Captain Semmes, as we all know, has, for some months past, been in\
command of the Victoria and Albert, in the Ryde and Portsmouth\
service, and has lately been promoted to be captain of the Emmet, which\
is a bigger boat.\
As for the ridiculous report about his "having reached Havannah in\
the Solent," we presume it has arisen from the fact that one fine evening,\
a little while ago, as his vessel crossed the Solent, the gallant captain\
felt inclined for a cigar. So he went into his cabin to fetch one of the\
fine Havannahs he imports; and, as for safety's sake he keeps the box\
on a high shelf, he of course had to assume such an attitude as justifies\
the statement that he "reached" it.\
Admirable Imitation.\
We may venture to give publicity to a report that the generous\
example set by Earl Spencer in taking measures for the perpetual\
reservation of Wimbledon Common for the benefit of the public, has\
produced such an effect upon an honourable baronet that similar steps\
are about to be taken with respect to Hampstead Heath, so as to secure\
it as a pleasure-ground for the people for ever, according to the dying\
wish of the father of Sib Thomas Maryon W ilson.\
Dog Latin.\'97Cave Canem.\
THE DAVENPORTS DONE UP.\
Oh, have you heard the tale of sport\
About the Brothers Davenport.\
How their career has been cut snort?\
The way it was effected\
By Dr. Scoffern you shall learn;\
He has their goose cooked to a turn,\
He has exposed the whole concern,\
The humbug has detected.\
i The Doctor, like a knowing one,\
Determined he would not be done,\
Went to the HaH at Islington,\
To watch their exhibition;\
He called on them with truth to state\
If thev knew how they operate,\
But, finding them prevaricate,\
Suspected imposition.\
He asked that he their hands might tie,\
Their showmen would not let him try,\
And said as much as "Ax my eye,"\
When he made application\
That he might be allowed to get\
Within the wooden Cabinet;\
For no impostor, ever yet,\
Would stand investigation.\
But Scoffern, bent the trick to trace,\
Upon the platform took his place,\
The "structure" treating as a case\
Of phthisical affection.\
With ear as to a patient's breast,\
What's going on therein to test,\
He stood and listened at the chest,\
To their extreme objection.\
A bar of metal, from inside.\
The Doctor at his head haa shied,\
By hands that were of course untied,\
And then, when he presented\
Himself the meeting to address,\
The Yankees did around him press,\
And, hustling him with downright stress,\
Awhile his speech prevented.\
But, in the body of the Hall,\
The people heard him at his call,\
Criea "Off!" as loud as they could bawl;\
In Quacks made unbelievers,\
They hissed and hooted them away,\
The Davenports, and Mr. Fat;\
So there's an end to public pay\
Of impudent deceivers.\
THE FUSIBILITY OF THE PEOPLES.\
In the debate on the Convention in the Italian Parliament, General\
Lamarmora said that the fusion of the Italians is a fact throughout\
the army. It may be asked if the fusion of the Italians is a fact\
throughout the marines. It may also be asked whether, if the fusion of\
the Italians throughout the army is a fact, the inexorable logic of facts\
does not compel us to believe the possibility of the liquefaction of the\
blood of St. Januarius at Naples. The fusion of the Italians, if a\
fact, is an extraordinary fact to nave been accomplished at this time of\
year; might have been expected to take place, if at all, in the summer.\
Now, however, suppose the Italians are fused, a question which may be\
asked is, " Will Italy run into Greece?"\
Economical Munificence.\

MEPHISTOPHELES TO THE REICHSRATH.\
The existence of Merhistoriieles is denied or doubted in the present\
day by many of your Honours and Worships, and by some, even, of\
your Reverences. Mephistopheles does, nevertheless, exist, and if\
his queer foot and cock's-tail feather are invisible, his working can be\
discerned by the clear eye. Mefhistophelbs first eggs on his fools to\
kill and take possession, and then inspires them to satirise their own\
deeds. Thus, for instance, does the Emperor of Austria, with the\
mouth of Mephistopheles at his ear, address his Jtcicbsrath:\'97\
"A subject of dispute for many yeans in the north of Germany has just been\
settled in the most honourable manner. The representatives of my empire will\
participate with truly patriotic feeling in my satisfaction that a close has been put\
to the war between the German Powers and Denmark by the Treaty of Peace, signed\
at Vienna on the 30th of October, and the ratification of which is expected in a few\
days."\
Schleswig and Holstein have been stolen "in the most honourable\
manner." Marry, howf Francis-Joseph tells the Austrian Parlia-\
ment, thus:\'97\
"The courage of the allied troops and the navies of Austria and Prussia has con-\
quered that splendid prize; ana the wise and just reticence of the Allied Powers\
has facilitated the final understanding."\
The mouth which emitted this terrible irony was indeed the mouth of\
Fran cis-Joseph, but the tongue within that mouth was twisted to talk\
mockery by Mephistopheles. Francis-Joseph speaks of having\
"conquered that splendid prize," Schleswig-Holstein, exactly as\
Francis Muller might have spoken of conquering that splendid\
frize, the watch and chain of Mr. Briggs. However, the cases of\
'rancm-Joseph and Francis Muller differ in this, that Muller\
robbed and murdered Mr. Briggs single-handed, whilst the Danes\
were dealt with by "the allied troops and the navies of Austria and\
Prussia." Moreover, Muller was hanged last Monday week.\
Neologians may say what they like, but with Sonderborg and\
Dybbol unavenged in this world, there must be a Mephistopheles.\
The snarl of the mocking fiend is audible in the gibes which the infatu-\
ated Kaiser is impelled to utter under the idea that they are eulogy\
and glorification of himself and his Royal accomplice. Meanwhile,\
Mephistopheles bides his time.\
FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC ALBUMS.\
Mr. Punch has seen, with a sensation which he can hardly describe,\
a most contemptible card of verses intended as a preface to Photograph\
Albums. The composition is fearfully snobbish. It contains the word\
"Phiz," which is never used in decent society except when reference is\
made to the distinguished artist who, in mockery of Snobs, selected the\
name. And it has also the word "Quiz." which is never used except at\
Islington and in the back streets of the City Road, That no person\
may have an excuse for using, for a moment, the vulgar affair in\
question, he subjoins some verses in the same metre, but of a different\
kind, and he presents the copyright to the Collectors of Photographs:\'97\

A FRAGMENT.\
A Fragment of the long lost\
Eleventh Chapter of the Com-\
pleat Angler has been dis-\
covered at the Rye House.\
We subjoin it in extenso:\'97\
Venator and Piscator at the\
Waterside.\
P. And now, friend Vena-\
tor, I will tell you somewhat\
concerning the Chubb. This\
fish is most found in safe\
places and in locks, where it\
often attains to large size. It\
can then only be taken in the\
night time, and is much prized;\
but very difficult to pick. You\
may, however, sometimes get\
one with a ledger line. Some\
anglers maintain that this fish\
is a variety of the Bramah or\
Bream. Next of the " Parr,"\
of which I myself know little\
noteworthy, but Gbssner re-\
lates, that one has been known\
to live upwards of a hundred\
years. Of the Bleak I can only\
say that it loves an east wind\
\'97-but soft \'97 I have a rise.\
No. I have missed him. I\
fear these flies are too large\
for the water, but I have a cast\
in my eye.\
V. Ay, marry indeed thou\
hast.\
P. Peace, friend, and be\
not personal in thy remarks;\
and now let me tell you what\
I know of the Pike or Parr, which is solitary, morose, and very\
voracious; you may see it lurking behind a weed, and taking toll\
of all that pass. It is so savage that it will rise to you, even if you\
have not stopped to bait. A fly is almost sure to fetch him out, but he\
will not take twice in the same day. Never strike this fish, or you will\
come to grief. The male Pike is often called Jack, and takes kmdly to\
bis gill: a drag will always draw him. Now concerning the Bod-pole\
or Perch. I must tell you that this fish runs much of a size, and is\
frequently caught by small boys, so that at schools the tables are well\
supplied with it.\
V. But. Master Piscator, methinks it begins to rain somewhat\
heavily, shall we not take shelter?\
P. Ay, truly, and in yonder water-shed that seems to have been\
erected for the use of our brotherhood. [."\
\
"I HAVE HEARD OF YOUR PAINTINGS, TOO!"\
Oh, that Hamlet had lived in these days! How he would have\
flogged the ladies! He had only face-painting, and ogling and ambling,\
and mincing and lisping, co abuse in hit time. What a field he would\
have had in crinoline and porterVknots of false hair, and enamelled\
faces, and painted eyelids, and Brummagem golden locks, and all the\
thousand and one exaggerations and falsifications and sophistications\
that now go to the "making up" of a woman! Still, clever as our\
female face and figure forgers may be, they manage these things better\
in Prance. In the way of hair-dye, for instance, the maxim of your\
British belle as a rule is, "never say dye" till she begins to get\
grizzled. The British brunette is generally content with the glorious\
crown of brown or black hair with which nature invested her\'97though\
we do know exceptions. But your Parisian petite maitresse defies fact\
and deifies fashion. Nature puts her out\'97as Fdseli said. French\
figures and faces are-absolutely regulated by the fashion-book. You\
must he fat or lean, full-bosomed or flat, long-faced or squab, as\
La Folie may rule, and the milliners pronounce their fiat. Here is a\
case in point. When Mrs. Punch was m Paris\'97now some years ago\'97\
slie wrung from Mr. P. his "slow leave" to employ a dress-maker in\
the Rue de la Paix. When the drees came home, Mrs. P., who bears a\
bosom worthy to suckle young Punches, could not breathe in the dimen-\
sions Madame la Mode had allowed her. and timidly told her so!" Mais,\
Madame\} on ne porte plus de gorge" (bosoms are not worn), was the\
stern rejoinder. "But, what do the ladies do?" asked poor Mrs. P.\
"Dame, on ote la ovate" (they take out the wadding). On the same\
principle, if Blondes are la mode, everybody insists on being blonde.\
Nature is expelled, not with a fork, but with the friseur's irons, and\
black or brown hair is made to strike its colours and come out as\
blonde cendre, blonde dore'e, blonde rousse, or any particular nuance of\
blonde that the lady may fancy, or her coiffeur has the secret of.\
"We have no Wigbs (Whigs)," writes from Paris an enthusiastic\
Anglo-maniacal French correspondent of Mr. Punch, who amongst other\
British fashions affects puns; "but we have enormement of dories"\
(Tories.)\
From dyeing ladies to dyeing lap-dogs is only a step. And that step\
has been taken, if we may believe the Parisian correspondent of the\
Globe^\'97punningest and pleasantest of foreign letter-writers. The\
Parisian poodle is no more allowed to go about in his native colours\
now-a-days than his fair owner. While the soubrette converts her\
mistress from brunette to blonde^ the mistress glorifies her unhappy\
pet\'97poodle or Skye, or King Charles, or Italian greyhound\'97with a\
coat of sky blue, pea green, or rose du Barri!\
Puppy is thus at least put on a level with petite maitresse. Like the\
poor Indian (with a difference),\'97\
'1 She thinks, admitted to that equal dye,\
Her faithful dog may keop her company."\
The quotation is so far pertinent, that if Pofe was talking of Heaven,\
the Parisian lady is thinking of the Elysian Fields.\
If Paris be the Heaven of Yankees (" Good Americans," it has been\
said, "when they die, go to Paris! ), the Champs Elysees is the\
Seventh Heaven of that Heaven, and is eminently worthy of its celestial\
hierarchy of demi-monde angels with dyed hair and rose-coloured\
poodles.\
THE GREAT SEWAGE QUESTION.\
Mr favourite notions are rudely upset\
By the movements at work in the City -.\
Here I read of a Temperance gathering met\
In the Mansion House, more is the pity.\
And fact number two as much wonder affords\
As a Lord Mayor the loving-cup shirking;\
The new Board of Works has, of lite, giv*a up words,\
And really taken to working!\
Then our friends Gog and Magog, who've sat there so long,\
Serene within sniff of Thames brewage,\
Are laying about them, so hot and so strong,\
About Metropolitan sewage:\
Getting all by the ears with Thwattes and his peers\
For not making due calculation\
What price is expedient for this rich ingredient\
In the wide pale of civilisation.\
Time was, in most places, Town Boards set their faces\
'Gainst sewers, and said "rather not,"\
When asked to lay mains down to take poor folks drains down,\
Or when begged to have rubbish clean shot.\
But if London's beginning to think gold of winning\
From her drains, she won't long be left solus:\
We shall cherish each sewer\'97the more rich the less pure\'97\
As a rather strong branch of Pactolus.\
With our iron and coal fields, we '11 boast of our gold-fields,\
Irrigated by streams (od) auriferous;\
On our own banks of guano draw drafts, pieno mono,\
Productive, if somewhat pestiferous.\
As to spreading the wet\'97by ditch, pipe, hose and jet ?\'97\
On these points Time will make the world wiser;\
But ere scents go scot free, let us hope we may see\
Every man his own deodoriser.\
Many battles we've seen, that of late times have been,\
Wnich though bloodless awakened their rages, <\
And called out both reasons and rhymes too, I ween,\
As the battles of styles, schools, and gauges,\
For a new battle now see two hosts face to face,\
On a quarrel that well fits this new age\
Which defines Dirt as "matter left in the wrong place "\'97\
The battle of schemes for the sewage.\
In the open already the skirmishers show\
Though they shoot rather wide and still want a cue;\
'Tis a fair stand-up Dght of Thwaites, Napier & Co.,\
Against Ellis and Brady and Montague;\
May the best win\'97the winners' shares go up like rockets,\
While capital's purse-strings are undone,\
And the end not be draining their shareholders' pockets\
As well as the levels of London.\

\f0 ' WAR WITH GERMANY.\
What is the use of Lord Russell's taking so much pains to keep\
us out of a war with All Germany, when Sin George Grey's cynicism\
impels us in the opposite direction. Does the Home Secretary read\
the papers, or the despatches of his colleagues P Is he not aware that\
within the last year a great band of Germans broke burglariously into\
Denmark, and committed murder by wholesale on the persons of helpless\
Danes. If so, and aware of the sympathy which the fate of a German\
murderer would excite in Father-Land, how dared Sir George to out-\
rage the Great and Good nation by refusing to interfere with the course\
of English justice in the case of Muller. Now we shall be plunged\
into war. Here is the Declaration, which we extract from the Berlin\
Reform, a liberal paper of large circulation. Speaking of the last scene\
in the life of Herb Von MOllbb, Germany says :\'97\
'1 But it was worse than murder\'97it was a murder on the ground of national\
prejudice and hatred. The Scbleswig-Holstein war, and the impotent rage of the\
English aristocratic mob, tied the noose by which was bung the man MDller. The\
dtop was made to fall by the noble seal (of the German Legal Protection Society,\
which by the journalistic hounds was denounced as an attempt against the ancient\
dignity of English judicial proceedings. And that venerable assembly which usob\
to attend on hanging days in front of Newgate prison, that most respectable con-\
glomeration of thieves and robbers, would have stormed the scaffold and destroyod\
the victim had the Queen dared entertain the prayers of her crowned cousins of\
Germany, who a few days previous bad been dragged in effigy through the mire of\
the capital to invest the celebration ol Guy Fawlces Day with fresh charms.,f\
Now we are in for it. The Rubicon is passed. The German fleet\
has been ordered to be ready for an invasion, and where shall we all be\
this day six months? It is true that the Fenny steamers in the Thames\
have undertaken to demolish that fleet, and will probably do so, but\
what are we to do with the armies which will be led on by the Crowned\
Cousins, Herr.Von Muller's patrons f We are glad that the Govern-\
ment has the sense to take some precautions, and has ordered Messrs.\
Meux, Messrs. Trukan and Hanbury, and other gigantic brewers to\
send thousands of Beer barrels to the coasts nearest Germany, and it is\
to be hoped that the effect of the liquor, which will be furiously seized\
by the troops of Father-Land, will make them easy victims to our police.\
But who knows what may happen in war-time? The immediate dis-\
missal of Sir George Grey is matter of course, and the German Legal\
Protection Society have been offered the free run of all the beer-shops\
and tobacconists' in London, and these concessions may avert the blow.\
But we are in an awful state of alarm, and beg our readers to prepare\
for the worst.\

APOLOGY FOR THE GERMAN SOCIETY.\
BY HERS VON SCHWEPENBIER.\
The spectacle of Germans loving one another out-and-out, and stick-\
ing fast to one another through thick and thin, notwithstanding aught\
that one another may have done to anybody else, dumfounds English-\
men with angry bewilderment. A clear explanation of this mystery\
shall therefore be offered to the beef-headed ones.\
The common sonship of Fatherland unites all Germans in the para-\
mount bond of a brotherhood of transcendental holiness. Every German\
individual unit is as one of the molecules of a mass of matter united\
with the cohesiveness of wax. Hence the homogeneity of the German\
people.\
Every German has an inner subjective self, of divine essence, and an\
outer objectivity into which the subjective occasionally passes, and\
having there awhile submitted itself to the appetites and the impulses,\
returns into its pure Ipseity, none the worse for having perhaps been\
engaged in picking pockets or cutting throats in the meantime.\
It is in the state of objective consciousness that the great German\
nation, as one man, actuated by an acquisitive enthusiasm, rushes in\
overwhelming force on a neighbouring State, and dismembers it of two\
provinces necessary to complete the idea of German unity, and realise a\
German fleet. What if, in the execution of that exploit, they kill and\
mutilate any number of the antagonists who offer them resistance?\
For when Germany has returned from the objective into serene subjec-\
tiveness, what has been has ceased to be in the thought of Germans,\
and is not any more, so they innocently wonder to hear themselves\
accused of robbery and murder.\
So when, in a momentary excursion from the Inner of Moral Con-\
sciousness, the German mind; rendered for the time objective by the\
attraction of a watch and chain, or a portemonnaie, impels the German\
hand to grab those articles, and to knock their owner on the head for\
brevity and precaution, the German, having satisfied his objective\
craving, retires into his subjective tranquillity, and resumes his habitu-\
ally mud and gentle demeanour. The assassmation and robbery which\
his objective personality has committed, are a mere episode of his essen-\
tial lite. They are dismissed from his subjective mind, and he goes\
about as light-hearted as though nothing had happened. He ana his\
countrymen regard those acts as the work of a past entity, and not his\
present own. They, therefore, think it monstrously cruel to hang him\
on the ground that he is guilty of them. The inner I of the German\
ever retains its essential purity unsullied, under all circumstances, and,\
consequently, his brothers use their utmost endeavours to prevent\
brutal foreigners from putting out his I, as if he were a common objec-\
tive ruffian, by the capital punishment of stretching his neck, for the\
trilling offence of cracking an old gentleman's skull, by the way.\
It is hoped that this elucidation of a sentiment which has been\
blindly mistaken for the mutual sympathy of rascals, may prove satis-\
factory.\
Note on Dress.\
In an article that appeared lately in the Times on "Left-off Clothes,"\
there was an omission of some moment. No mention was made of the\
fancy Watchmakers have for second-hand things. They were also the\
last to leave off wearing clocks on their stockings.\

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.\
CHAPTER I.\'97DIRECTIONS TO ACTORS.\
\
H"E Handy - book will\
deal first with the\
Actors, not only be-\
cause they are the\
objects of most public\
interest in a theatre,\
but because they are\
the real foundation-\
stones of the theatrical\
edifice.\
"THE ACTORS MAKE\
THE THEATRE."\
Let this fundamental\
principle be deeply im-\
pressed on the mind of\
every one who follows\
that noble profession,\
which can boast, the\
names of a Shak-\
speark, a Ben Jonson,\
and a Garrick. It\
will encourage self-re-\
spect, which the linger-\
ing influence of a\
wretched social preju-\
dice might otherwise\
impair in the Actor,\
and teach him a lesson\
he needs above all men\'97to set a proper value on himself. Besides, a con-\
viction of this truth is, in a great measure, the secret of the Actor's public\
importance\'97the key stone of his position. We may be told that the\
Manager and Author are just as essential to the fortunes of a theatre as\
the Actors. But where would the Manager or Author be without the\
performers P The one has merely to settle the plans of his theatrical\
campaign, to find pieces and capital, to pay his company, to hear their\
complaints, arrange their little difficulties, protect their interests, and\
find them proper opportunities for the display of their abilities. Any-\
body can make a Manager. Don't we see, every day, men who have\
failed in every other calling, taking up this, and doing just as well in it,;\
apparently, as those who have been at it all their lives? In comparison\
with the Actor's the Manager's work is child's play. And besides\
being easy, it is mole-like, dull, obscure, and mechanical. You can no\
more put the two on the same parallel than you can level distinctions\
between the crawling grub or torpid chrysalis and the brilliant butterfly.\
As for putting the Author before the Actor, you might as well say the\
tailor was greater than the man who wears clothes. The Author is the\
poor drudge who laboriously fashions the pale outer husk and dead case\
of the part, which it is the Actor's business to endow with life, colour,\
and motion. He is the true creator, who breathes over the dry bones\
of the play-wright, and bids them put oa flesh, and rise and walk. That\
this is the right estimate of the two callings, is shown by their relative\
position and remuneration. Compare the social position of the Actor\'97\
courted, feted, caressed, the darling of the public\'97with that of the\
Author, an obscure drudge, too often shy, shabby, altogether the sort\
of person to fight shy of rather than fete or ask to dinner. Put the\
rewards of the successful Play-actor by those of the successful Play-\
writer. The one shall be receiving his \'a350 a night, perhaps,\
for his performance in a play the Author of which thinks himself\
well paid by a fiftieth part of that sum. Look at the Author\'97even\
the successful Author\'97before the Manager. What do we see? A\
poor creature, submissive, if not abject, thankful for an audience,\
grateful for a payment on account, submitting to snubs and sneers,\
glad to clip, and carve, and remodel his work at his customers'\
dictation\'97too thankful to have it tried upon any terms, and the bill\
paid. Then see the Actor in the Manager's room, dictating the terms\
of an engagement\'97throwing up apart, or exacting satisfaction for a\
grievance or failure of proper respect. You find in him a man animated\
by a becoming sense of his importance to the theatre, dealing with his\
Manager rather as a superior than an equal, imposing his own terms,\
buoyant, and self-confident with that noble assurance which springs\
from the proud sense of power, and the invigorating consciousness of\
universal recognition.\
As, then, the Actor is the hack-bone of the theatre\'97the working\
pivot of the whole stage machinery\'97it is with the Actor that our\
Handy-book first deals.\
But the reading and rehearsal of a Play must precede the acting of it,\
and in both the Actor has some concern.\
A few rules, therefore, for his guidance on these occasions, may pro-\
perly precede our hints for his conduct on the Stage :\'97\
AT THE READrNC. OF A PLAT\
Di not trouble yourself to be punctual to a few minutes\'97if yourposi-\
tion in the theatre renders you safe from a fine. Nothing is so foreign\
to the spirit of an essentially artistic calling as a mechanical, business,\
like exactitude. Time wag made for slaves\'97such as clerks, meo-of-\
business, lawyers, tradesmen, and railway guards\'97not for the volun-\
teers enlisted in the delightful service of the Arts\
Besides, a little waiting will give the Author time to collect himself\
If he know Ids place, he will feel timid and nervous, as inferiors must\
be expected to feel in tbe presence of their betters: if he do not kno*\
bis place, it will be wholesome to teach him; and for this purpose\
nothing is better than to let him kick his heels for a little time on ,\
cold stage, or in an empty green-room.\
Be careful in your demeanour, and in any remarks you may address\
to the Author\'97I do not object to your speaking to him, though I must\
caution you against any undue familiarity, which i* prettp tm h bt\
presumed upon\'97 to show that you thoroughly understand his position\
and your own. Do not let him for a'moment forget that he is conven-\
iug with a superior.\
When summoned to the reading, do not take your seat hurriedly,\
and never submit to any discomfort, such as a place near the door or\
the fire, or a possible exposure to draught. To do so, shows a dispo-\
sition to put up with slight and disrespect, which is fatal in a theatre.\
Always take the beet place, and then find fault with it. This will shoi\
you are not, a person to be put upon, and will prepare the Author for\
that, critical severity in your judgment of.hia piece which is the kindest\
service you can render him.\
If a lady, you will, of course, take the opportunity of the Author's\
opening his manuscript, to recognise your particular friends in the com-\
pany, exchange the civilities of the morning\'97which should never be\
omitted in a theatre, where good-breeding ought ever to find ahome-\
and any remarks which may be naturally suggested by last night's per-\
formance, the play-bills of tbe day, or the morning papers. These little\
neighbourly attentions cannot be'so well paid later in the reading, and\
they will help to put the Author at his ease, and show him he is anion;\
friends who make no ceremony with him.\
Be careful how you choose your place. Always command a mirror,\
and avoid a strong light. You "will thus be able to observe the play of\
emotion on your own features during tbe reading\'97the most improrin?\
study lor the Actor\'97and you will avoid exposing your complexion to\
that disagreeable observation, from which even the cordial good-feefc\
and mutual forbearance generally to be found among members of the\
same company will not always preserve you.\
I need hardly caution you against feeling\'97much more showin|r-an\
interest in the scenes as the reading proceeds. Interest is the most\
uncritical of all possible moods of mind, and as completely unfits you\
for clear judgment, as a keen appetite for the appreciation of refined\
cookery. If you feel an interest growing up, in spite of your better\
judgment, struggle against it. Think of something else. Blow your\
nose noisily. Shift your position. Whisper to a neighbour. Rise.t0\
shut or open the window ... or pretend to fall into a dose, and wake\
suddenly, with an exclamation. You will thus break the chain\
not only of your own ideas, but. of your companions', and, pro-\
bably, the Author's, and recall him to the region of hard fact, fro\'99\
which he may be beginning to stray under the united operation of his\
self conceit and the mischievous excitement of reading.\
One useful rule for destroying any interest the piece may be awaken-\
ing is not to listen to any part but your own. The unerring ms'ln,ctf\
the artist will, of course, soon guide you to the character intended tor\
yourself. Follow that closely and critically, and see that, in justice M\
himself, as well as to you, the Author does not trifle mfc\
Remember that golden rule of your art\'97to think that the success^\
the piece rests entirely on your shoulders. In this way, oniy>
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 \
thorough devotion to your part be secured. Any attention to thei\
parts will naturally weaken your interest in your own, and so aim\
your contribution to the effect of the piece. , , \'abI!\
If every Actor follow this rule, the result will, of course, be, ins' .\
the parts will be strengthened, and the effect of the ensemble raise*\
ilL of I\
proportion.\
But even if your part should leave nothing to be desired, you\
course, be careful not to let the Author see that you think so. *> \'bb\
the general impolicy of encouraging a class at all times too re\
presume, it is clearly against your interest ever to be swstien, ^\
may thus bar the way against future requirements.\
The" best part is\
likely to have its weak points. Carried away by the ffener. .J ?; '..our\
may at first overlook these. But be cautious how you yie1(1'l j;0D\
first impression. Never commit yourself to strong ap'5.'ru |,ave\
Shrug your shoulders; grumble inaudibly; tell the Author yo --^\
failed to discover the part meant for you; and when he tells yo \'95\
aud appear surprised, and say that somehow you do not see y\'b0.urs may\
You will thus prepare the Author's mind for any demands y g!\
afterwards find it your duty to make upon him for the enncan\'99 ^\

PUNCH OR THE LONDON" CHARTVART\
If you find that the Author has wronged you by giving any of his\
good things to the other characters, do not submit to the injustice, but\
insist at once, and firmly, on having them transferred to your own part.\
Even if it were not your duty to consider your own interests first, and\
supposing that anything which gives prominence to the other per-\
| sonages were not, so far, an injury to you, you will thus be advancing\
i the interests of your theatre. For if the Author takes the plums from\
l other parts to stick them into yours, he will have to provide other\
plums in lieu of those thus transferred, and the piece will thus be\
benefited.\
However good your part may be, always speak diffidently, or even\
despairingly, of your power of doing anything with it. Let no false\
delicacy induce you to keep back the weak points of his work from the\
Author. Candour is a duty in your relative positions, and the more you\
decry the part, the more the Author will feel what he owes to your\
acting of it should it be successful.\
Should the Author so far forget himself as to ask your opinion of his\
piece after the reading, do not encourage rash hopes by premature\
approbation. It is safe to suggest that it seemed rather long, as the\
pmning-knife is sure to be called in during rehearsal.\
Generally, remember that true kindness to the Aut hor requires on your\
part everything in word, act, look, and demeanour, which is likely to send\
him away hopeless and depressed under a deep conviction of impending\
failure. If lie fail, you will know that yon have done nothing to foster\
unfounded hopes. If he succeed, you will enjoy the pleasure of\
thinking that you have enhanced his triumph, by contrast with the\
discouragement you have done your best to engender. I need hardly\
point oat how much gratification this reflection is calculated to afford\
to the benevolent mind.\
The Actor's proper conduct at rehearsal must be the subject of\
another chapter.\

THE FEDERAL PHCENIX.\
When Herodotus, surnamed " The Father of History"\
CWe are not informed who was History's mother),\
Went a travelling to Egypt, that region of mystery,\
Where each step presented some marvel or other,\
In a great city there, called (in Greek) Heliopolis,\
The priests put him up to a strange story\'97 rather\'97\
Of a bird, who came up to that priestly metropolis,\
Once in five hundred years, to inter its own father.\
When to filial feeling apparently callous,\
Not a plume ruffled (as we should say, not a hair rent),\
In a pot-pourri made of sweet-spice, myrrh, and aloes,\
He flagrantly, burnt, after burying, Lis parent.\
But Pompontus Mela has managed to gather\
Of this curious story a modified version,\
In which the bird burns up itself, not its father,\
And soars to new life from its fiery immersion.\
This bird has oft figured in emblems and prophecies\'97\
And though Snyders ne'er painted its picture, nor Weenix,\
Itsportraits on plates of a well-known fire-office is.\
Which, after this bird's name, is christened the Phcenix.\
Henceforth a new Phoenix, from o'er the Atlantic,\
Our old fire-office friend from his brass-plate displaces;\
With a plumage of greenbacks, all ruffled, and antic\
In Old Abe's rueful phiz and Old Abe's shambling graces.\
As the bird of Arabia wrought resurrection\
By a flame all whose virtues grew out of what fed it,\
So the Federal Phoenix has earned re-election\
By a holocaust huge of rights, commerce, and credit.\
TWO QUACKS IN QUOD.\
Two of the Advertising Quacks have caught it. Well done, Bams\
Bramwell, and we wish that many more of them may come under\
your "unforgiving eye." Doctor Henery and his accomplice\
Anderson, the extortionists, who traded on the siUyfears of a young\
officer, are sentenced to hard labour for two years. We hope that tbe\
governor of the gaol will see that it is very hard, and wilf remember\
that felons with a smattering of medical science may easily feign illness,\
for which a mild whipping will be the best cure. But have we only\
two rascals caged? There are scores at liberty, who are advertising\
themselves freely, to the disgrace of certain newspapers. Silly young\
officers and all other silly persons, recollect that extortion is more or\
less the game of the whole gang. Mr. Punch's file impales heaps \'bb\
information which has been sent to him touching the doings of many\
who have not yet been brought before Baron Bramwell. Woe to\
the first on whom Mr. Punch shall lav the Iron Flail! Bat it is the\
fools who make the knaves. We dislike the subject so much that it u\
only from a sense of duty that we mention it. Dearly beloTed young\
donkeys, do take warning and eschew these cold-blooded extorttoner-\
and quacks. "Country papers, please copy," and London papers, too.\

UNACCOUNTABLE BUNKUM.\
Abraham Lincoln, the other day, recom-\
mended his people to thank Heaven for having\
averted from them foreign intervention. Accord-\
ing to Mr. Sewabd, ''foreign wars loom over"\
the Yankees, and he declares that he, for his\
part, will never surrender to the rebels,\
'though they come backed in their unholy\
quarrel by one or more foreign states."\
What foreign intervention did Abraham\
refer to, what foreign wars are those- which\
Mr. Seward apprehends, and which are the\
foreign States which he deems disposed to\
back those whom he calls rebels? This country,\
surely, cannot be one of them. Is it not a fact,\
of which Mr. Lincoln's and Mr. Seward's\
magnanimous countrymen are sufficiently satis-\
fied, that the mean, spiritless, contemptible\
John Bull is not. even to be "kicked, into\
war." Cannot they, at all events, rest assured\
that he will never go to war with them until\
they kick him P\

AN ECCENTRICITY OF ZERO.\
The following, extracted from the Timet, is a\
somewhat extraordinary announcement :\'97\
"Tho Chancellor of the Rzcheqdkr acknowledges\
the receipt of the second halrea of baalc-notea. to the\
amount of \'a3360 from 1 0.'"\
The axiom Fit nihil ex nihilo, if bank-notes to\
the amount of \'a3350 have really been received\
from O by the Chancellor or the Exchequer,\
would seem to be anile which admits of a remark-\
able exception. But the wonder is, not so much\
that O sends anything, as that aught but O\
is ever sent to the Chancellor oi\'bb the\
Exchequer, since O is the outside of all which\
that Minister of his own accord ever refunds.\
MR. COBDEN AND HIS CLIENTS.\
Well, Cobden, what you say is true, the North is in the right,\
The men of Yankeedoodledom are fighting the good fight.\
The Southern States are fewer, and the Northern States are more,\
And that's as plain a case as 'tis that two and two make four.\
A Heaven-ordained republic is a great and holy thing,\
Endowed with that divinity which doth not hedge a King.\
Secession, just, from George the Third did independence win;\
Rebellion against Lincoln is as witchcraft's deadly sin.\
All wars of conquest ever waged were wicked save this one,\
The first exception to the rule that heretofore had none,\
Its aim the stiff-necked South beneath the North's mild yoke to bend.\
And sanctified are all the means to work that righteous end.\
Then let your friends, that they may the revolted States regain,\
Hound on them all the rascalry of Ireland and A Imam;\
Soldiers who, though they triumph not, do service in defeat,\
And when they fail of victory will plunder in retreat.\
Let Turchin's valiant myrmidons, and Butler's gallant bands,\
The rebels' homes set blazing, and lay waste the rebels' lands.\
What if they meet repulse from men on many a battle plain,\
The women they can war upon, and manhood lightly stain.\
The Yankees' arms if Fortune with success refuse to crown.\
Let them undam a river and at once a whole State drown.\
This is a war of giants, this the way such war to wage,\
Warfare that shames the chivalry of this degenerate age.\
To bayonet and rifle, not deciding this great strife,\
Why don't they join the tomahawk, and add the scalping-knife P\
Tie to a stake six prisoners, and in cold blood shoot them dead!\
What's that P First torture captives; go the whole hog, go ahead!\
Good, if wrongheaded, Cobden, of your clients give you joy,\
How long, think you, are they to sink, burn, slaughter, aim destroy P\
None, let us hope, the longer for aught you and friend Bright say j\
Then you '11 have cause to blame yourselves not much another day.\
A Stringed Duett.\'97The Brothers Davenport.\
AN INFANT PHENOMENON.\
Constant readers of the newspapers see strange things now and\
then. Only look at this announcement, which the other morning\
appeared among the "Births:"\'97\
"On the 11th Inst at Plymouth, the wifo of ' Parallax,' founder of the 'Zotetlc\
Philosophy,' of a daughter."\
Who, ye Stars! is Parallax? What in wonder's name is the Zetetic\
Philosophy? Such questions is the notice intended to provoke; for of\
course its object simply is to advertise the works of the Zetetic\
Philosopher, it any works of his there be. At any rate we trust that\
the infant above advertised will be fitly named. What does her fond\
father say to letting her be christened Parallaxia Zetetica?\
MULLER AND HIS MEN.\
The Germans who clapped when the Diet dared draw\
Execution to deal on the Duchies,\
Howl against execution, awarded by law,\
To Mulled, in Calcruft's stem clutches.\
Can the reason that Vaterland thus makes black white,\
From applause to abuse shifts its song;\
Be that our execution was proveably right.\
And their own as demonstrably wrong?\
EMANCIPATE YOUR GA.S.\
Britons! This is the cry of our time. Let us. ha! ha! let ua\'97\
hee, hee, throw a little light upon the subject, ha! ha! ha! The point\
is this. G is is four shillings and sixpence per thousand cubic feet. Never\
mind what cubic feet are\'97but understand this. You ought to get the\
same quantity (and much better) for two shillings and ninepence. The\
difference goes into the pockets of the monopolist companies, who\
despise and defy you. Now, are you going on bearing this? If not,\
join the cheap gas movement, headed by the gallant George Flintoef.\
Paddington is up in arms, and has flung down the gage of battle. Up,\
up, and put the tyrannic Companies' pipes out. Punch will lead you on.\
You have recoiled from their charge too long, now is your time. Charge\

THE "WEATHER AND THE PARKS.\
We have it now in our power to lay before the public\
from time to time exclusive information on the topics\
mentioned in the heading of this notice. Our corre-\
spondents, whose names, for very obvious reasons, we\
are not permitted to make known, have already furnished\
us with the following most interesting and important\
intelligence, coming from reliable sources, totally inac-\
cessible to the daily or weekly journals.\
The Weather.\'97 London, Nov. 24. We have but just\
heard from a friend whose official position gives an incal-\
culable weight to any statement he may make, that it\
was, at the time of his communication, a very cold day.\
The statement made, in an off-hand manner, by Mr.\
Cobden, at Rochdale, to the effect that "it was season-\
able weather," was not, as we have since ascertained,\
strictly in accordance with fact.\
It is whispered that a certain noble Lord observed at\
the commencement of last month that the days would\
now begin to draw in. Be this as it may, it is unde-\
niable that the days have been drawing in considerably\
ever since.\
The Baronieler.\'97The Astronomer Royal has, we hear,\
lately ordered in two dozen barometers, ' to try."\
Yesterday morning, before leaving his house, he tapped\
one of the samples. A wet night is expected.\
There were great rejoicings at Mr. Bishop's Observ-\
atory some little time ago, on account of the barometer\
being 21 in the shade last birthday.\
The Parks.\'97The Gardens of Kensington are still\
used, even during the winter months, as the Metropo-\
litan Nursery Grounds.\
The late gales have been severely felt on the Serpen-\
tine, and several fine vessels would have been utterlj lost\
in sight of their owners, who were standing anxiously\
on the shore, but for the laudable exertions of t he Dogs\
belonging to the Newfoundland Breed. Smaller craft\
foundered in crossing, but it being their admirable cus-\
tom never to carry any one on Doard, no lives have\
been lost; of course, those members of Lloyd's who do\
the Serpentine Ship Insurance business will be heavy\
sufferers. On Thursday last a trim rakish-looking cutter\
was suddenly capsized by an irritated swan. This will,\
as usual, lead to complicated legal proceedings.\

PUNCH'S SCIENTIFIC REGISTER.\
At the re-iterated desire of the Scientific World, a desire signified,\
we must say, in letters of extreme illegibility (yet Newton wrote, ana\
Faraday writes, beautifully) Mr. Punch has consented to devote a\
portion of his invaluable space to a record of the proceedings of the\
various societies which meet to bewilder themselves with wisdom.\
The expense of preparing this register is awful, but when did a gentleman\
trouble his head about such a trumpery detail as the price of anything\
he wanted. He edits the resume himself, so that the slightest in-\
accuracy would be impossible if anything were impossible to Mr. Punch.\
Henceforth, scientific society will look to Mr. Punch's pages alone for\
the latest and best information on science, as all the rest of creation\
does for everything else.\
Geological Society, Dec. 1.\'97The President in the Chair. An\
interesting paper was read by Mr. Fondleso.uaw upon Corals. He\
stated that in passing down Cockspur Street, in London, he came upon\
a large number of interesting miocene corals, in various beautiful forms,\
and that they were deposited behind a transparent medium resembling\
plate glass. Having fractured this with several blows of his heavy\
stick, he proceeded to collect some specimens of coral. He was\
somewhat impeded by the aborigines of the place, who remonstrated\
energetically, and invoked the aid of one of their deities, whom they\
appealed to as "Bobby," but after some negotiation, and making a\
present of some coins, he was permitted to remove some types of the\
productions, which were embedded in several strata of a soft sub-\
stance, not unlike velvet. He described them, but had been unable\
to bring them to the meeting in consequence of the magnetic attraction\
which they possess, and which rendered it impossible to detach them\
from the persons of some feminine members of his I household to whom\
he had unguardedly entrusted them. A vote of thanks was given to\
Mr, Fondlesquaw, and he was requested to bring the ladies them-\
selves to the next meeting, if the corals could not otherwise be\
obtained. Mr. Lobscouse then produced some other specimens of\
coral which he had discovered in a species of fish, known in commerce\
as the lobster, and an interesting discussion ensued. Their lithological\
character was disputed, and they were eaten by the President, who\
stated that though he did not agree with the discoverer, he hoped that\
the coral would agree with himself.\
Archaeological Institute.\'97The Vice-President in the Chair.\
Mr. Buggleton exhibited an autograph letter from Tubal Cain, written\
in cuneiform Semitic, and desiring a person to come and tune his organ.\
Mr. Numfs exhibited the original MSS. of Homer's Iliad, with marginal\
notes by Alexander the Great, as also the casket in which the latter\
is recorded to have kept the work. Mr. Grundy exhibited an ancient\
heir-loom, which had evidently been used for weaving hair. Mr.\
M'Ossian exhibited the harp that once through Tara's halls the soul of\
music shed. Mr. Jones exhibited a valuable picture by Van Eyck in\
his eleventh manner, and on the Meeting insisting on scratching the\
painting off to see what was under it, Mr. Jones also exhibited a great\
deal of temper. The Vice-President remarked that the picture was\
probably in tempera. Mr. Brown exhibited the dagger with which\
Julius C^jsar was assassinated by Cassius. It was of British\
manufacture, and had probably been given by Cesar to his friend as "a\
Trifle from Britain." The inscription was partly illegible, but the letters\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
M.TTH.ws.sH.FF.LDCould betraced. Thesteel was very fine, showing\
the advance of the English in manufactures, even at that early date.\
Mr. Robinson exhibited the Key of the Iron Gate on the Danube. It\
was brought over by Kossuth after the Hungarian revolution. Mr.\
Wobbles had nothing to exhibit, but told a very long and interesting\
story of a dream which he had had, and in which it was revealed to him\
that if the Tower of London were removed, and the foundations dug up,\
some odd things would be found. The meeting, having exhibited con-\
tempt for Mb, .Robinson, adjourned.\
Zoological Society \'97Professor Porfus in the Chair. Mr. Strate-\
lacb read a Paper on the exceedingly vulgar language used by some of\
the cockatoos in the Society's Gardens, and upon the probable origin of\
it. Mr. Bruce, who had just returned from Abyssinia, gave an\
interesting account of its fauna, and stated that the natives when\
travelling use elephants' trunks for portmanteaux. He also informed\
the meeting that he had frequently been knocked down by the wild\
animals he had met, on which the Chairman observed that the fauna\
was a floorer. Mr. Epicurus Rotundus exhibited three plover's eggs\
which he had obtained at Tucker's, and ate t hem, in order to test the\
wholesomeness of the article. He remained perfectly well up to the\
adjournment of the meeting. Professor Phlunket exhibited an ex-\
ceedingly fine large toad, which he had captured in a pond at Hampstead,\
and which he stated to be edible. The meeting resolved unanimously\
that the Professor himself was entitled to the honour of trying, and he\
was instructed to attend at the next meeting and report results. Mr.\
Cranky exhibited the scull of a boat, and was proceeding to describe\
the difference between it and the scull of a man, when he was shoved\
out of the room. The proceedings concluded with the reading of an\
interesting Paper by Mr. Stansfeld, on the question of the affinity\
between Mr. Cox, M P. for Finsbury, and the ordinary donkey with\
his foot in a plug-hole.\
Geographical Society\'97The President in the Chair. A deeply\
interesting and valuable letter was read from Mr. Wool Gatherer,\
a corresponding member in foreign parts, who stated that he did not\
exactly know where he was at present, but that when he found out, he\
would let the Society know. Thanks and the G >ld Medal were voted\
to him, and the letter was ordered to be entered in the Minutes. Mr.\
Baffin exhibited a beautiful map, by himself, of the interior of\
Pomerania and its watersheds, and a lively discussion ensued on his\
stating, first, that Pomerania was in Africa, and secondly, that, he had\
never been there. Mr. Murkator produced a chart of the world on\
his little boy's projection, the infant having thrown it, out of window.\
Mr. Hornsey Wood read a paper giving an account of a river which had\
just been discovered at Islington, partly subterraneous.'and abounding in\
catfish, or in fish very like dead cats, and it was resolved that this should\
be named the New River. The President stated that most gratifying\
news had been received from Professor Brick, who had been sent out\
by the Society to discover the true source of the Nile. He was in perfect\
health, and had got as far as Gravesend, where he had been sojourning\
for some weeks, and had been received with much hospitality at the\
Falcon. A letter was read from Professor Meander, who stated\
that he had discovered a new and stupendous range of mountains in the\
Isle of Wight, but he declined to say where unless he received some\
more money. They were volcanic, and were all smoking, and he had\
therefore named them the Kitchen Range.\
Photographic Society.\'97The Lord Chief Baron in the Chair. A\
Paper was read on the Best Mode of Keeping Babies Still for the\
Photographic Sitting, and a debate ensued. Some unmarried members\
thought the best way was to frighten them by an awful shout at the\
moment of exposure, but the married members objected that maternal\
resistance to this course would probably be offered. Moreover, an\
ugly face was produced by terror. Chloroform was also suggested,\
and it was resolved that experiments should be tried with it. A\
member said that if the mothers would only stay away, there would be\
no difficulty, as all babies were exactly alike, and a single type could be\
reproduced from an old picture. Thousands of photographs of the last\
Royal baby were sold which had never been taken from that princely\
infant. Mr. Snubber read a Paper on the Negative, as employed in\
answer to touts. Mr. Poser explained his process for photographing\
ladies who had large ugly hands. He tied their arms behind them, and\
placed beautifully modelled wax arms under the shawl or mantilla, with\
the hands exposed. This he considered legitimate idealisation. It was\
stated that Mr. Gladstone, in his next Budget, intends to impose a\
penny stamp upon every photograph sold, which will bring many\

memorial was presented by the officials at the Admiralty, praying that\
the constellation called the Great Bear should have its name changed to\

Solar Eclipse," which he had been unable to see, owing to its being\
invisible in England. He conjectured that if he had been in some other\
portion of the world, he might have seen it. Mr. Peter Wilkins read\
a bold and interesting Paper, in which he contended that the Moon was\
square\'97a truth which had been known to Shakspeare, one of whose\
witches spoke of " the corner of the moon." Considerable debate fol-\
lowed, in the course of which a Member stated that the original disco-\
verer of the moon was a tinman named Richard, whence the classic\
authors called that planet Dictynna. Mr. Peeper read a Paper on the\
question, "Are the Tails of Comets Inhabited f" and Mr. Muff read\
one on the question, whether a chronometer will go if taken in the\
Eocket through a crowd 'i He was authorised to try the experiment at\
is own expense. Forty-seven Members then announced that they had\
all discovered comets, which it was resolved should be named after the\
members of the Court of Aldermen, as far as they would go, and the\
rest after the members of the Metropolitan Board of Works.\

THE FELLOW-FEELING OF PRUSSIA.\
The generous Kino of Prus-\
sia is paying his people\
handsomely lor the loyal\
support which they wisely\
afforded him in the invasion\
and spoliation of Denmark.\
See, in the subjoined ex-\
tract from the Post, what\
the Prussians are getting\
by their devoted fidelity to\
their Sovereign:\'97\
M The Press in Prussia.\'97The\
prosecutions against the Pros* in\
Prussia are still conducted with\
great rigour, and amongst the\
announcements daily made on\
the uuhjoct is one that the editor\
of tho KladderadaUch (the Berlin\
Punch) on Thursday last com-\
menced to undergo the senteuce\
of imprisonment, for a month\
and a week, yaned on him for\
an article which he had pub-\
llsbed. which was considered to be calumniatory of the Prikch of Rbuss-Orlmz, a\
Sovereign with whom Prussia is on terms of amity." m\
When our Brother of Berlin comes out of the dungeon into which he\
has been cast for exceeding the ample liberties which the gracious\
William, by the advice of the liberal Bismarck, has conceded to the\
Prussian Press, he will take care how he again offends his Royal\
Master by writing anything that can possibly be considered calumnia-\
tory of any Sovereign with whom Prussia is on terms of amity. For\
instance, should he venture to review Captain Burton's lately pub-\
lished work, A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome, he will doubtless\
studiously refrain from any disparaging remarks on the Grand Customs\
of the dark potentate to whom it relates, or on the exploits of his dusky\
Majesty's army of Amazons; the rather that any unfavourable com-\
ment on those achievements might fairly be considered as implying\
still severer censure of the gallant deeds of the heroes who triumphed\
at Dybbol and Sonderborg, and were quartered upon Jutland. Know-\
ing, indeed, what it is to censure a Prince with whom Prussia is on\
friendly terms, surely the Editor of the Kladderadatsch will be careful\
not to say anyt hing uncivil of the very Prince of Darkness.\
A MAN OF PEACE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.\
In sending to the Mediterranean, as flag-ship of the Admiral in com-\
mand, the Victoria, three-decker, carrying 121 guns, 1,100 men, and\
engines of 1,000 horse-power, but being a wooden vessel, which a little\
ironclad could destroy in a brace of shakes, the Admiralty has sorely\
puzzled all those persons who imagine that she is sent there to fight, if\
necessary. She is sent there as a hostage, or security, that the Medi-\
terranean flset will observe a policy of strict non-intervention; and the\
Admiral's flag which she carries is of the nature of a flag of truce. The\
Admiral on board of that flag-ship will, in'/act, be Admiral of the White.\

they are so in the fact that the establishment was once upon a time the\

NO RELIEF ON SUNDAY!\
The North British Railway Company has. terribly frightened Sir James Gar-\

Rev. Mr. Graham, of Newhaven, Rev. Dr. Macfarlane, of Dalkeith, and a\
multitude of Scotch Sabbatarians to whom those pastors minister thistles. They\
resolved that they, "considering the Divine law of the Sabbath to be one of\
the essential supports to vital and practical Christianity, feel it incumbent on them\
to make every exertion for the maintenance of that law as it has hitherto been\
understood by the Scottish people." Accordingly, if an ox, or if one of themselves,\
were to fall into a pit on a Sunday, they would doubtless forbid anybody to pull\
him out,\

I directed the people to fetch from the relieving officer. The reply was, he was not at home, and it\
he had been, nothing would be given on Stinday."\
A poor creature is sinking for want of a drop of wine, but could not have it in\
any case, because even if the relieving officer were at home, "nothing would be\
given on Sunday." Is there any difference between sinking from malignant fever\
and tumbling into a pit f Some, perhaps, in the opinion of the people who thought\
it wicked to heal on the Sabbath Day. None, of course, in that of those who\
understand the Divine law of the Sabbath "as it has hitherto been understood,"\
if they are to be credited, "by the Scottish people." It seems that the guardians\
of " a large London Union" understand it in the same sense. Pious souls! May\

Dear! I thought the Thames business was over,\

Why lor! says an M.P., what stuff!\
You've forgotten those fast special trains,\
And the lunch both for blue and for buff\
That they gave us down there in the drains.\
May be so, says an unlucky liver\
Down at Erith,\'97yet still he complains\
You have poisoned us all on the river,\
By the mess you have made with the drains.\
Then the waste! Oh, the scandal and shame!\
Cries a farmer intent on his gains,\
Why I'd make both my fortune and fame\
With the stuff that you waste in the drains.\
So Lord Robert he took up the case,\
Though quite at the end of his brains,\
And he tried to put on a good face\
About all they had done with the drains.\
And his Lordship at once called a meeting\
With many long-winded refrains,\
And after much drinking and eating,\
Asked, what's to be done with Hie drains?\
Then a noise and confusion arose.\
He scarcely a hearing obtains,\
For mudlarking contractors and those\
Who all of them wanted the drains.\
And the people of Edinburgh city\
Cried, see all our trouble and pains:\
'Tis a shame and a terrible pity\
You don't do as we do with the drains.\
The contractors of Rugby cry, look; _\
Why we 're quite independent of rains.\
Let them dry up the river and brook,\
We just water our land with the drains.\
There's Napier and Hope are so leary,\
That, as sure as Her Majesty reigns, i\
They '11 make of those quicksands so dreary\
A Paradise all from the drains.\
Then there's Highgate and Hampstead as well,\
Where the owners of lands and terrains\
Say, we don't care a fig for the smell,\
But we want the contents of the drains.\
Then they write to the Times every day,\
Squabbling over their filthy old mains!\
Oh, good gracious! do settle't some way,\
For we 're all of us sick of the drains.\
And by Neptune we swear that whoever\
Cleans the water from Sheerness to Staines,\
And sweetens our jolly old river,\
We '11 make him the King of the Drains.\

and to suppose that there is a motive that offers some\
falliating excuse for this bit of aristocratic impertinence,\
t may be that the Emperor purposely wore his hat, to\
avoid showing his extreme baldness as a reigning Sove-\

[December 10,\
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
INDIGNATION MEETING OF QUACKS.\
\
here took place yester-\
day, at the Hall in the\
Haymarket, a meeting\
attended by all the ad-\
vertising quacks in the\
kingdom. The occasion\
of this concourse was the\
sentence of two years' imprisonment and hard labour on two of their\
number, Messrs. Henery and Anderson, for the crime of extortion.\
Amongst the blackguards present were noticed Mr. Stoat, Mr. Skunk,\
Mr. Foumart, Dr. Cutts, Mr. Larogue, Dr. de la Ruse and Co.,\
and others whose names are notorious.\
The chair was taken by Mr. Stoat, who said he was sure that all\
present would sympathise with their brethren in bonds, their brother\
Henery and their brother Anderson, whose case might be their own\
if not to-morrow, anyhow at the next sitting of the Central Criminal\
Court, or the approaching Assizes. The worthy speaker'concluded by\
using strong language with relation to the Judge and the Jury by whom\
the prisoners in question had been tried, applying to them each and all\
a term and an epithet too habitually employed in controversy by the\
lower orders.\
Mr. Foumart said the exposure which had attended the trial of\
Henery and Anderson was a very bad job. It had aroused the\
attention of the most powerful part of the Press, which was now\
exerting its power iu a manner calculated to crush them, if any power\
on earth could. But he had great confidence in certain newspaper\
proprietors' love of gain, which, he trusted, would, in spite of anything\
then- Editors might say, secure their persistence in allowing to be\
inserted in their columns those advertisements which writers inspired\
with virtuous indignation called obscene (a laugh), and infamous\
(renewed laughter), but which were the necessities of their position, of\
their very existence as practitioners. (Hear, hear.') If they could no\
longer advertise, it would be all up with them. But so long as their\
advertisements were permitted to appear in papers of respectability\
(laughter) there would be plenty of readers, whom no disclosures, and\
no cautions or warnings, would deter or restrain from consulting the\
advertisers. He was happy to say that in spite of all that had been said,\
the papers that had hitherto published, still continued to publish those\
announcements that served them for the same purpose as limed twigs\
did the bird catchers. (Cheers.)\
Mr. Larogue, matriculated member of the University of Perth! was\
afraid that the so-called respectable part of the Press would proceed\
from bad to worse. The Lancet had mentioned names. The same\
course might be taken by a leading newspaper. One or two of the\
principal papers might unite not only in denouncing advertisers by name,\
but also in calling public attention to the papers which continued to\
insert their advertisements, pointing the advertisements out, and stig-\
matising the papers in which they appeared as unlit to lie on breakfast\
or drawing-room tables. That would be enough to smash them all.\
Dr. de la Ruse said that must be looked to. However, if the\
papers were closed to their advertisements they might still fall hack on\
posters and handbills. As yet. happily, there was no law which ren-\
dered the authors and distributors of the puffs which so vexed the\
righteous (laughter) liable to hard labour in the House of Correction.\
(Hear!)\
Mr. Skunk agreed with all that had fallen from the Chairman rela-\
tive to the Judge and Jury that had sent poor Henery and Andeb-\
sow to oakum and the treadmill. But there were other Judges and\
other Juries, and, thank Parliament, there was the Law of Libel stil\
strong enough, he hoped, to enable them to set the Press at defiance.\
His (Mr. Skunk's) name might be a by-word of infamy, but he didn't\
care for that one dump, and he exulted at the thought that, notorious\
as he was, and noisome as his reputation might be, if anybody dared in\
print to apply to him individually the language that public writers\
applied to advertisers of his stamp in general, he should, if he chose\
to bring an 'action against that party, have no difficulty in finding1 a\
barrister to undertake his cause, and very likely persuade a British jary\
to give him heavy damages. (Loud cheers.) He would move that the\
Meeting resolve itself into a Mutual Protection Society, whose object-\
should be to provide means to enable any one of its Members who migh*\
happen to be exposed in any of the papers, or other publications, to bring\
an action against the proprietors of the print in which his practices were\
reprehended, or any attempt was made to prevent the sale of his medi-\
cines. (Hear, hear.')\
The resolution having been carried unanimously, the Meeting dis-\
persed, and, the room having been cleared,\
An Officer of the Board of Health (attending by order) entered, and\
sprinkled the place with chloride of lime.\

PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S INAUGURAL SPEECH.\
(By Ultramarine Telegraph.)\
Well, we've done it, gentlemen. Bully for us. Cowhided the\
Copperheads considerable. Non nobis, of course, but still 1 reckon wc\
have had a hand in the glory, some. That reminds me of the Old world\
story about the Hand of Glory, which I take to have been the limb of\
a gentleman who had been justified on the gallows, and which the\
witches turned into a patent moderator lamp, as would lead a burglar\
afe into any domicile which he might wish to plunder. We ain't,\
burglars, quite t'other, but I fancy that if Uly Grant could get hold of\
that kind and description of thing to help him into Richmond, he'd not\
be so un-Christian proud as to refuse the hand of a malefactor. (Right,\
right.') Well, right or left hand, that's no odds, gentlemen. (Laughter, j\
Now I am sovereign of the sovereign people of this great and united\
republic for four years next ensuing the date hereof, as I used to say\
when I was a lawyer. (You are.' Bully for you !) Yes, gentlemen, but\
you must do something more than bully for me, you must fight for me,\
if you please, and whether you please or not. As the old joke says,\
I here's no compulsion, onlyyou must. Must is for the King, they say\
in the rotten Old world. Well, I'm King, and you shall be Viceroys\
over me. But I tell you again, and in fact I repeat it, that there't\
man's work to do to beat these rebels. They may run away, no doubt.\
As the Irishman says, pigs may fly, but they 're darned unlikely birds to\
do it. They must be well whipped, gentlemen, and I must trouble yot.\
for the whipcord. (You shall have it!) Rebellion is a wicked thing,\
gentlemen, an awful wicked thing, and the mere nomenclature thereof\
would make my hair stand on end, if it could be more standonender\
than it is. (Laughter.) Truly awful, that is when it is performed\
against mild, free, constitutional sway like that of the White House,\
but of course right and glorious when perpetrated against ferocious, cruel,\
bloodthirsty old tyrants like George the Third. We must punish\
these rebels for their own good, and to teach them the blessings of this\
mighty and transcendental Union. (We will, ice will.') All very tall\
talking, gentlemen, but talking won't take Richmond. If it would, and\
there had been six Richmonds in the field, we should long since have\
took them all. If Richmond would fall like Jericho, by every man\
blowing of his own trumpet, we've brass enough in our band for that\
little feat in acoustics. But when a cow sticks, as Grant does, in the\
mud, how then? (Great laughter.) Incontestable, gentlemen, this\
great and mighty nation must give her a shove on. Shove for Richmond,\
gentlemen. (That's the talk.') Now about these eternal blacks, you\
expect me to say something touching them, though I suppose we 're\
none of us too fond of touching them, for reasons in that case made\
and provided, as I used to say. Well, listen. We've got them on our\
hands, that's a fact, and it reminds me of a nigger story. Two of\
these blacks met, ana one had a fine new hat. Where you got dat\
hat,' Sambo P" says t'other. "Out ob a shop, nigger," says Sambo.\
"'Spex so," says t'other, "and what might be the price on dat hat?"\
"Can't say, zactly, nigger, the shopkeeper didn't happen to be on the\
premises." (Laughter.) Well, wei've got the niggers, and I can't exactly\
say\'97or at least 1 don't think you'd like to hear\'97what might be the\
price of those articles. But we must utilise our hats, gentlemen. We\
must make them dig and fight, that's a fact. There's no shame in\
digging, I suppose. Adam digged, and he is a gentleman of older\
line than any of the bloated and slavish aristocracies of Europe. And\
as for fighting, they must feel honoured at doing that for the glorious\
old flag that has braved for eighty-nine years and a-half, be the same\
little more or less, the battle and the breeze. (Cheers.) Yes, and when\
the rebellion's put down, we'll see what's to be done with them. Perhaps\
if the naughty boys down South get uncommon contrite hearts, we\
may make them a little present of the blacks, not as slaves, of course,\
but as legal apprentices with undefined salaries determinable on miscon-\
duct. (Cheers.) Meantime, gentlemen, I won't deny that the niggers\
are useful in the way of moral support. They give this here war a holy\
character, and we can call it a crusade for freedom. A man may call\
his house an island if he likes, as has been said by one of those fiendish\
British writeis who abuse our hospitality by not cracking us up (War\
with England!) Well, all in good time, gentlemen. Let our generals\
learn their business first. I don't blame them, mind you, that they\
haven't learned it yet, for when a man has kept a whiskey-store, or a bar,\
or an oyster-cellar, or an old-clothes' shop for years, he can't be ex-\
pected, merely because he puts on a uniform, to become a Hannibal or\
a Napoleon, or even a Marlborough or a Wellington. Likewise, they\
must learn to keep reasonable sober. Friends at a distance will please\
accept this intimation. (Boars of Laughter.) When that's done, and\
the rebels are whipped, and we are in want of more fighting, we '11 see\
whether Richmond in England, where the Quern's palace of Windsor\
Castle is situate lying and being, is a harder nut to crack than Rich\
mond nearer us. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, one thing more. Did you ever\
hear the story of the farmer who had been insulted by an exciseman P\
"He wur so rude," said the farmer, "that I wur obliged to remonstrate\
with him." "And to what effect did you remonstrate?" asked a friend.\
"Well, ll don't know about effect, but I bent the poker 80 that j I\
was obliged to get a hammer to straighten it." Gentlemen, we must\
straighten this glorious Union, and the hammer is taxes. (Laughter.)\
You may laugh, but you must pay. I don't mean to be hard upon this\

A FAIR CHALLENGE.\
We admit that the Davenport gang have at last offered a fair trial\
of their preternatural powers. They have printed a book, in which they\
state that having been arrested at Oswego as unlicensed jugglers, they\
were sent to gaol for a month. Here, episodically, but respectfully, we\
drink the health of the magistrates of Oswego. Committed for a month,\
the jugglers remained in gaol for twenty-nine days, when, in the evening\
of the twenty-ninth, angels came to them, and one spoke thus to the\
showman:\'97\
"' Ran J, you are to go out of this place this night. Put on your coat and hat\'97he\
ready.' Immediately the door was thrown open and the voice again spake and said,\
'Nov walk quickly out and on to the attic window yonder, and let thyself down by a rope,\
and Jlee from this place. We will take care of Ute boys. There arc many angels present,\
though Out one speaks.' The angelic command was strictly obeyed."\
This has been sworn, and a Justice of Peace attests the oath. They\
publish the statement as a challenge to unbelievers. Now, as there\
can be no doubt that whatever the angels attendant, upon these jugglers\
may think of them, the law of England regards them as persons who\
obtain money under false pretences, the crucial test may be applied\
with perfect fairness. Let somebody summon them before the police-\
magistrate in whose district they perform, and let that gentleman\
commit them to prison. If an angel delivers them five minutes before\
the time at which their sentence expires, the miracle will be so splendid\
that their fortunes will be made for ever. If no angel come, why\
"Despair their charm,\
And let the angel whom they still have served\
Tell them they 're lucky to escape the doom\'97\
* Soverely whipped.'"\

AN ANTI-GAS LEAGUE.\
Englishmen, and Englishwomen,\
Can it be that you like to pay Four Shillings and Sixpence\
for a bad article when you can have a good one for Two Shillings and\
Ninepence P\
Do you need to be reminded\'97(ladies, I am sure that you do not,\
for it is you who are the thoughtful and thrifty guardians of our homes)\
\'97that One and Ninepence saved is One and Ninepence got P\
Then, Out with the Gas until the Companies cease to cheat you.\
Remember how the grocers tried to do us, and wo gave up sugar,\
until the grocers fell on their knees, and sugar fell also.\
Remember how the butter-men cheated us, and we gave up butter,\
and down came the butter-men and their demands.\
Let it be unto gas as it was unto sugar and butter, and again we shall\
triumph.\
Are there not the beautiful oil, the sparkling camphine, the sana-\
tory Photogenic Generator, the rosy paraffin, the elegant wax, the\
charming composite, the useful loDg six P For the time, let any and\
all help us to defeat the extortionate vendors of bad gas, which poisons\
the air, spoils the books and pictures, makes our little ones pale, and\
kills our eyes.\
Ere long we shall have Magnesium, the loveliest light in the world,\
but as yet this is too dear.\
But meantime we will have gas cheap and good, or none at all.\
Let us have an Anti-Gas League. Ladies, the saving will give you\
the most delightful tours next summer. Men\'97you ought to need no\
stimulant but a burning sense of wrong, which should kindle every\
evening when the taper touches the burner.\
Punch leads the way to light you to light pay; Punch leads you on\
with waxen brand far flashing in his dread right hand; Punch will\
relieve you from the yoke, he said, then seized a torch and broke the\
fas-man's head. To show how terribly in earnest he is, he yesterday\
lew up a gas-collector.\

under us, go it Icenian, Catieuchlanian, Coritanian, Trinobant!\
Yours to the last,\

GLOVER v. PERSIGNY.\
Dear Sekjeant, that trial abundantly proves\
What your own muddle-pate couldn't let you discover,\
That Frenchmen, so fond of their neat nice new gloves,\
Are not to be caught by a clumsy.old Glover.\
But a much deeper moral, in letters of gold\
Is writ, in the Chronicle's tale of disasters:\
The public won't buy what is privately sold;\
And the worst pay of all is the pay of Two Masters.\
\
\
A Fitting Comparison.\
\
Another Lady burnt to death last week! Considering the number\
of fatal accidents that have occurred to ladies' dresses, it is painfully\
true to say that a lady is never so literally "dressed to death " as when\
she is wearing Crinoline. ,\

Evening (Wednesday) and Friday next at eight, at the Hanover Square Rooms.\'97\
Sofa Stalls, 7a Sit; Stalls, St.; Body of Hall, 3s.\
Another column of the same paper begins with a letter headed "The\
Davenports and the Press," signed "William Howitt," and con-\
taining the subjoined passage :\'97\
"For the rest I am delighted to see the rampant attitude which the Pross has\
assumed. It is the most convincing sign of their inward and inescapeable belief.\
They are no longer indifferent\'97no longer in a mere mocking key, they are frantic\
with rage. They see and feel that all their oracular wisdom on the subject of the\
folly and fanaticism of spiritualism has gone for nothing. The great inextinguish-\
able fact rises before them, higher, broader, firmer in its adamantine solidity. From\
end to end of Europe it is, every day, spreading like a forest on fire, striking its\
roots deeper into the soil of the human heart. Give the opponents rope enough,\
hurra them on, for the more thoy commit themselves the hotter."\
Well but, Mr. Howitt, your friends the Davenports, and their\
showmen\'97your friends, too, apparently\'97refuse to do what you say\
they should do. They will not give the opponents of Spiritualism rope\
enough\'97to bind the Davenports in a satisfactory manner. They\
refuse to allow anybody to pinion them secundum artem, in the style of\
Calcrapt. A man of science challenges them to let him subject the\
Davenports to decisive tests. Their showman, Palmer, replies by\
abusing the man of science with the characteristic scurrility of the\
insolent charlatan, and declining the challenge. Rope enough, Mr.\
Howitt? Yes, certainly, give your opponents rope enough; they\
have not had it yet. The Spiritualists have; and some of them appear\
to have made the customary use of that privilege. Among these there\
is too much reason to fear that your best friends will number the writer\
of the following words which occur in the same letter as that above\
quoted:\'97\
"Byron has said, "A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.' What is the\
fellow feeling between the Press and the conjurors, which makes it on all possible\
occasions exult in the very clumsiest imitations by the conjurors of the genuine\
manifestations of the Mediums! Makes them extol the 'Brummagem' counterfeits\
at the expense of the true originals? The cause is the same which made the\
Egyptian savants applaud Jannes and Jahbrss, who withstood Moses\'97Janses and\
Jambrbs, the Ani>ersons and Tolkhaques of the time."\
If Professor Anderson and M. Tollemaque are Jannes and\
Jambr.es, who is Moses? Is it Ira Davenport or William Daven-\
port f or, suppose Ira to be Moses, do you call his brother William\
Aaron f Or is the whole concern\'97Davenport Brothers and Co,\
or Davenports, Ferguson, Fay, and Palmer\'97a Joint-Stock Moses?\
A rare Moses, with the " structure" for an Ark!\
You are a man of knowledge, Mr. Howitt, and you know, amongst\
other things, that there is an infirmity named "colour blindness." Tire\
person affected with this weakness can see all objects distinctly in every\
particular, except certain colours. You have been endowed with many\
bright faculties, but your mind in one respect appears to be as dark as\
the deepest hole in the moon. Nature seems to have denied you the\
discernment of quacks\'97the sense that detects humbug in its demeanour\
and style. Here is the remainder of the Davenports' advertisement,\
which appeared, together with your letter, in the Post:\'97\
"N.B. After each Public Stance there will be given a Dark Stance, for which only\
a very limited number of tickets will be sold at a half-guinea each. Dark Seance\
will commence at a quarter past nine o'clock. Tickets for the Dark Stance only, or\
the Stalls for the Public Stance, can be obtained during the day at the office of the\
Rooms, or In the evening at the doors. On Saturday afternoon at Three.\
Really, Mr Howitt, this evidence of the " success " of Spiritualism\
is not the sort of thing to exasperate the Press by forcing thereon any\
belief in that ism. Public writers are only vexed to see an eminent\
brother-chip incapable of seeing through the transparent gammon of a\
regular and common puff, worded in the generic phraseology of mounte-\
banks, whom he calls Moses; thereby doing, unconsciously, no doubt,\
very gross injustice to E. Moses and Son.\
Appropriate Analogy.\
The Mabquis de Mirabeat; said, "J'ai Spouse" la Discorde^ et (in\
allusion to his son, the great orator) nous avons enfanti le Pillage."\
Couldn't America, at the present moment, piteously say the same thing\
in precisely the same words. "Our Union has been Discord, and our\
only offspring Plunder."\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.\
MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.\
CHAP. II.\'97RULES FOR THE ACTOR AT REHEARSAL.\
aving mastered the rules for behaviour\
at the reading of a play, they will go a\
long way to prepare you for the proper\
conduct to follow at rehearsal. Re-\
hearsals are inevitable evils, which the\
tyranny of Managers and the absurd\
exigence of Authors have combined to\
impose on the Actor. It should be your\
business to show, by your conduct under\
the infliction, that you feel this, and\
resent it, as a person with proper self-\
respect should. Let yourmannerthrough-\
out rehearsal be a silent protest against\
a practice which deadens the fire of in-\
spiration, and tends to level the distinc-\
tion between laborious mediocrity and\
genius.\
It would hardly be too much to call\
rehearsal an un-English usage. Like so\
many other regulations of an arbitrary\
kind, in and out of the theatre, we may\
almost be said to owe this cruel inroad\
on the Actor's leisure to France. It is\
on the odious strictness of rehearsals in\
that despotically governed country, that\
a few Managers, and most Authors,\
found their pretensions to impose the\
same tyranny here. In Paris, a period\
of two or three months is often spent in\
the rehearsals of a new piece. Such is\
a Frenchman's notion of the value of\
time, and his indifference to the treatment of those who minister to his\
amusement! But this is not the most odious feature in French theatri-\
cal tyranny. The earlier rehearsals of a French piece are, in fact,\
readings by the Company, who are actually compelled to sit round a\
table, and to read their parts while the Author is allowed to suggest,\
find fault, check, impose his own notion of emphasis, and not only to\
explain his meaning but to impose it on the Actor! Our astonishment\
at this inversion of the natural relations of Performer and Author,\
may be diminished when we remember that it is not so long since\
Actors in France were denied Christian burial!\
I will not insult your profession even by supposing it possible that\
humiliation should be inflicted on an English company. The\
\
this humiliation should be inflicted on an .English company.\
English Actor respects himself too much, the English Manager knows\
too well the tenure by which he holds his authority, for the importation\
of this indignity ever to be attempted.\
But though these table-readings are, happily, unknown in our theatres,\
we may often hear praises\'97not loud, but deep\'97of the laborious care-\
fulness of the French rehearsals. They are invariably attended by the\
Author, who, in this, as in so many other respects, is allowed a mon-\
strous amount of weight in the French theatre, and a ridiculously large\
share in its profits. He gives himself airs of authority, orders and\
alters business, regulates the action, and, in short, usurps most of the\
proper functions of a Stage-Manager. With that petty attention to\
details, which belongs to the centralised and regulation-ridden French-\
man, the position of the Actors, their crossings, retirings up and comings\
forward, the bye-play, every getting up or sitting down, the way of\
coming into a room, of lifting or putting down a hat, are all elaborately\
planned and repeated, over and over again, till they are gone through\
as mechanically as a soldier's drill. The programme thus tediously\
t raced must be slavishly followed by the unfortunate Actor. Woe to\
him if he yield to a flash of inspiration\'97triple woe if he be a creature of\
genius, scorning the beaten track, and getting at his effects\'97as we so\
often see him on our stage, and as Hazlitt used to say the Elder\
Khan got at the soul of Shaksfeark\'97 by flashes of lightning! Of\
course, if there be such Actors on the French stage, their genius is\
quickly smothered\'97Pegasus may soon be seen jogging contentedly\
along in the stone-cart, alongside of the tamest horses in the theatrical\
team.\
The result of all this deadening mechanical discipline is, of course, a\
smooth, and, to our eyes, tame performance, whioh is hardly to be dis-\
tinguished from life itself. The Actors speak and move, in all respects,\
like ordinary men and women. There is little or no effect\'97none of that\
broadly-marked distinction between Art and Nature, which is still, we\
are happy to say, the rule in the English theatre. You hardly detect\
the rouge on the French Actor's face, or the elocution in his voice. The\
Art, as well as the Inspiration, has been washed out and killed, in the\
wearisome routine of the rehearsals.\
We have had English Managers\'97we may still have a few\'97who have\
forgotten their nationality so far as to go to France for their practice\
at rehearsals as for their pieces, and\'97in recent times at least\'97their\
Actors and Actresses. Let us hope that the first practice will be no\
more encouraging in its results than the last. Happily, the free\
English nature instinctively revolts against restraint; and the English\
Actor is eminently a creature of impulse. He knows that Licence is\
the life-breath of Genius, and in the occasional absence of genius, will\
go far to supply its place.\
You will, therefore, never forget .that rehearsal is an unwarrantable\
inroad on the domain of inspiration, and you will do your best to\
restrain and resist it. Be even more careful to mark this by unpunc-\
tuality at rehearsal than at reading. The latter can hardly be avoided:\
the former should be, whenever possible.\
Besides, your absence will give you importance. Many a man whose\
presence would be passed over with heartless indifference by Author\
and Manager, may make both sensible of his value by keeping out of\
the way.\
A medical certificate, however, should always be procured. There is\
no occasion you should be punished by a'fine because you revolt against\
a rehearsal. And a medical certificate will shield yon from any imputa-\
tion of idleness or irregularity\'97the reasons for absence which are\
sure to be seized upon by a sordid and cynical Manager.\
Besides, occasional absence is a duty you owe to your comrades as\
well as yourself. Such gaps at a rehearsal teach an Author his depend-\
ence on the Actor, and lead, thus, to those little attentions and marks\
of respect on his part, which must be gratifying to yon, even more as\
tributes to your profession than to yourself.\
I need hardly caution you against acting at rehearsal.\
Acting is an inspiration. It cannot be cold-drawn, like castor-oil, or\
turned on at will, Tike the gas in a public-house bar, or the beer in the\
machine at the counter.\
Besides, even if you could command your inspiration, why should you\
do so with an empty theatre before you? Applause is the breath of\
the Actor's nostrils. But for its invigorating and ennobling stimulus,\
he sinks into a mere drudge. Where there is no applause to win,\
acting is a waste of energy.\
Again, it is your duty to spare yourself fatigue, and to keep your\
effects in the dark. The stars and the moon only shine at night; and\
the Actor belongs to the stellar and planetary system.\
If you show iu the morning what you mean to do at night, you\
deprive the Author of the excitement of suspense, and the gratification\
of surprise. He takes your measure coldly and critically; sparingly\
praises, or respectfully (it is to be hoped) censures. But in either case\
you are submitting yourself to his judgment, and so far stooping to the\
position of an inferior.\
Think, on the other hand, of the calm superiority implied in a cold,\
monotonous, and careless delivery, an avoidance of all action and ex-\
citement, a studied languor, and a listless apathy at rehearsal\
Nobody, Manager, Brother-actor, or Author, knows what you are\
going to do. All are kept in a flutter. The chances of the night are a\
subject of animated speculation, of stimulating excitement. You give\
no undue advantage to your companions by letting them know your\
points, and calculating their own from them. You husband your\
strength, and leave the channel open for the countless springs of inspi-\
ration, which well up in your artistic nature, and make a volcano of\

Wb are credibly informed that the Prussian ambassador at this\
Court has formally, and in the very strongest terms, protested against\
Madame Tussaud being indecently allowed to exhibit poor MOxler\
in her Chambes of Horrors. He is so incensed at this gross indignity,\
that he has plainly told Lord Joror, in the event of the libellous\
representation of tnat injured German innocent not being removed\
within four-and-twenty hours, or the features so altered as to figure for\
an English criminal, that he must ask for his papers, and leave a country\
that takes every possible opportunity of vilifying his Fatherland. The\
affair is certainly assuming a very ugly aspect, and our only hope is, that\
Lord John Russell's well-known diplomatic skill may prevent its\
leading to a casus belli.\

id 1 cannot refrain from expressing my opinion, humble though it be,\

I really beg your pardon, Mr. Punch, Sir. The force of habit has\
duced' me to construct this last sentence without thinking. It so\
ippens that this is not a letter begging for money, for I have had some\
>od hauls this week, especially three. As one who lost his all by the\
nth explosion, as a young girl thrust from a happy home by a cruel\
epmother, and as a paralytic clergyman silenced by nis tyrannic Bishop\

id a shilling a dozen is not really dear, to a man of taste.\
But what I want is to ask you to let me protest against a new and\
\'95utally mean system which is now too common among parties who\
reive applications from strangers for assistance, and which are coarsely\
died begging-letters. Sir, Mr. Punch, do you know that men are found\
ho are cunning and base enough to keep these letters, even for years,\
id to refer to them when they receive new petitions. Anything more\
istardly I cannot conceive. How can I recollect what names I have\
gned during half-a-dozen years of begging P Do you think I have a\
tter-book, duly indexed, like a low person of business P I may at one\
me have called myself Brown, another year Jones, and now I may\
loose to be Robinson; but what encouragement is there for ingenuity\
if a sordid churl keeps my letters, and, putting them together, finds that\
the handwriting, bad spelling, and turns of phrase are all alike P I\
received a brutal repulse the other day, when I had written a beautifully\
touching and complimentary letter to an author (of whom I know\
nothing, and could not even spell his name right, so he ought to have\
borne me no malice), offering him the opportunity of doing good. The\
beast answered me with a list of my aliases! He knew them a deal\
better than I did, for I rejoice to say I have a soul above such pettiness.\

SEVERE SCHOLARSHIP.\
In the " Table Talk" of the Guardian there are some\
remarks on " Bad Latin," exemplified by instances quoted\
from certain contemporaries as blunders, some of which\
are evidently misprints, others slips of the pen that occurred\
in hasty composition, and one is not exactly a case of Latin\
that can be properly called bad. It is this:\'97\
"The editor of the Saturday Review seems either to ignore, or at\
least to forget bis Horace, to judge from the following remark: 'We\
may just notico in passing, that if Mr. Clay's shelf had contained\
a Latin dictionary, he might have known better than to use curri-\
culum for a chariot. The courteous Cicero would have been dread-\
fully puzzled at such an expression as driving a eurrtettfttm.' Cicero\
may or may not have used 1 curricvlum' in this sense, but at all\
events Horace does, in the very first Ode of his very first Book\'97\
1 Bunt quos currieulopulverem Olympicum colleguit Juvat.'m\
Take an Ainswobth's Latin Dictionary down from your\
shelf, turn out the word curriculum, and you will find it\
defined as "a place to run in the lists." and also "as a cart\
or chariot." Next, take down a Dolphin Horace, if you\
have one, and read the note to the first Ode, which is as\
follows:\'97\
"CurricKfo] Pro curru, vel ipso cursu, vel etiam loco in quo decur.\
ritur, accipitur ista vox."\
The Saturday Review, by the foregoing authority, is\
justified in assigning another meaning to curriculum than\
that given thereto by Mb. Clay. The same authority,\
which is not esteemed worthless, may be held to justify\
Mb. Clay in using that word in a sense different from\
that in which the Saturday Review understands it. But we\
will not hear the Saturday Review accused of bad Latin.\
Have we not had rather too much, lately, of criticism\
on errors of quotation which are plainly clerical, errors\
which an average schoolboy would not commit plodding\
over his exercise, but which the profoundest scholar might\
find on coming to revise an article which he had written\
in haste? Somewhat too much, perhaps, of criticisms\
conceived by accurate, attentive, little minds, that can\
imagine no cause of error but ignorance; criticisms con-\
ceived in the spirit of a stupid but sarcastic school-usher.\

The brilliant success which our friend, the Morning Advertiser, has\
achieved in classical fields, and the memories of Nebuchadnezzab, the\
King of the Jews, of marvellous inscriptions, and of tributes to our\
friend's interpretations of prophecy, justly entitle it to be heard touch-\
ing Lord Derby's Homer. Without losing time, as more timid critics\
have done, our friend promptly taps the new cask of Greek wine, and\
pronounces it flat. Whether "earth and time" will "confirm the\
stern decree," remains to be seen. In the meantime, might we, in all\
humility, ask what is meant by the following mysterious passage in the\
Advertiser's criticism ?\'97\

SABBATARIAN STRONG LANGUAGE AT KIRKCALDY.\
There are, in the Free Kirk of Scotland, officers called moderators-\
There was even one presiding at an assembly of the Free Kirk of Kirkcaldy\
the other day, when the following examples of Sabbatarian strong\
language were uttered by a Mb. Douglass, of that ilk. Mr. Douglass,\
one of the Douglasses of the a double s family, it may.be stated,\
denounced for the sin of running Sunday trains\'97\
"Railway Companies converting their lines into machines for catering to the\
wants of the profane- and dissolute, and irrigating the country with the scum of the\
community."\
By irrigating the country with the scum of the community, Mr.\
Douglass did not mean performing an operation subservient to Scotch\
farming, but simply conveying passengers not of the Sabbatarian\
persuasion. He went on, indeed, to explain his meaning, thus ;\'97\
'' He said there was a section of the community opposed to the proper observance\
of the Lords-day, and they knew of whom that section wits coinposod; if they\
could gather them together, the mass would bo found to consist of infidels, of latitu-\
dinarians, and the blackguardism of the country; that class of men who take for\
their rule of life tbe opinions of Paris and other Continental cities, instead of the\
doctrines of the Bible."\
If those to whom Mr. Douglass imputes blackguardism were dis-\
posed to return railing for railing, what would they call Mr. Douglass f\
The doctrines of the Bible, if by that he means the Old Testament, pre-\
scribes the observance of the Jewish Sabbath. The doctrines of the\
New prescribe nothing about the Sabbath. Mr. Douglass, when he\
asserts that the doctrines of the Bible forbid Sunday travelling by\
railway, says the thing that is not. The travellers and excursionists\
whom he calls blackguards, might reply by calling him an ill name of\
two syllables. They will b3 content to say that he is mistaken.\
The doughty Douglass further declaimed as follows:\'97\
*' Railway Companies are not exempted from tho binding obligations of the Fourth\
Commandment more than others, and these puny mortals who hold their existence\
from that God who says, * Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,' aro not at\
liberty to turn round and say, 1 We will do in this matter just as we like, we will\
take our own way in this Sabbath question."\
Here the Douglass is mistaken again. People are at liberty to\
regard the day which he calls the Sabbath, or not regard it, according\
to their consciences. If Christianity and the law of the land were not\
what they are, but what the Douglasses and their kind would make\
them, that liberty would be destroyed. But instead of that, it is\
enjoyed, at least in some measure.\
As a rule, Mr. Douglass does not approve of mutiny, but unruly\
Sabbatarians would form an exception to his rule:\'97\
"He was against strikes generally, but ho would hail with joy the intelligence\
that all tho officials of the North British Railway had combined not to do a stroke of\
work during the twenty-four hours of the Sunday."\
Perhaps Mr. Douglass would also hail with joy the intelligence that\
all the officers and men of the British Army and Navy had also struck\
on a Sunday. Perhaps, too, if Mr. Douglass, far from home, were\
suddenly seized on Sunday with cholera, for example, and were at the\
point of death, he would hail with joy the intelligence that, as the\
officials of the railway and electric telegraph office had all combined not\
to do a stroke of work on the twenty-four hours of that day, the doctor\
could not be sent for. He would rejoice in the martyrdom which\
would await him, in consequence of their combination to strike, and not\
do a stroke of work on Sunday.\
The Moderator of the Free Kirk of Kirkcaldy, the next time he\
presides over a Sabbatarian meeting at which Mr. Douglass is to\
speak, will perhaps endeavour to moderate the rancour of that gentle-\
man's tongue.\
Too Good to be True.\
The New York Correspondent of a contemporary states that:\'97\
"Botlkr had a crushing reception at the Fifth Avenue Hotel on Monda7\
evening."\
If he had, he deserved it. But we are afraid that General Butler\
is not smashed as yet, and is nothing like so flat as he ought to be.\

scribes in a despatch ?\'97\
"I commenced moving back from .Port Republic, Mount Crawford, Bridgewater\

points had previously been destroyed. In moving back to this point the whole\
country from the Blue Ridge to the North Mountain has been made tntirely untenable\
for a rebel army. I have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with wheat and hay and\
farming implements; over seventy mills filled with flour and wheat; have driven\

Troops not less than 3,000 sheep."\

Thalaba the Destroyer might have suggested such an act of\

"Since I came into tho Valley from Harper's Ferry, every train, every small\

honour of reading before Her Majesty at Windsor Castlo. It is nattering in the\
extreme to these artists that they hare been selected as the first who hare been\
permitted to ap(>ear before Her Majesty.1*\
In the first place, the Queen does not Hatter her subjects, though\
subjects may be so ignoble as to offer flattery to Sovereigns. In the\
next place, if the selection of certain artists as the first to appear before\
Her Majesty is gratifying to those artists, it cannot be flattering in\
their estimation; for to feel flattered is to feel more than duly appre-\
ciated. Thirdly, there is, so far from anything flattering, not even any-\
thing necessarily complimentary in being the first artists who have\
been permitted to appear before Her Majesty. The Queen might\
choose to see those whom she deems the best, first, or she might prefer\
to see them last. Of these two equally possible cases the case in ques-\
tion is very likely the former; but we deprecate slipslop.\

old Sir Robert Walpole used to say.t\
Mr. Milner Gibson. But I deny your guieta. There are a great lot of\
meetings, more or less influential, and we must do something.\
Lord Russell. I cannot think why the matter is to be taken out of my\
hands. I shall do nothing prematurely; but at the proper time, and in\
the proper place, I shall be prepared with the proper BilL\
Mr. Gladstone. I cannot withhold my admiration from the triple con-\
dition in which your Lordship has crystallised the proposition, but if I\
understand't to imply that the rest of the Cabinet is to be only a bed\
of justice\
Lord Palmerslon. I'm blessed if it's a bed of roses. Do you\
remember Lord Melbourne's first inquiry, when people told him of a\
difficulty P "Can't you let it alone f"\
Mr. Milner Gibson. We can't let this alone.\
Lord Palmerston. My dear Gjbson, no man knows his power of\
abstinence until he has tried it. Ask Mr. Banting.\
Sir George Greg. The matter is not in my department, but\
Lord Palmerston. Then, Grey,, rest and be thankful. Haven't you\
enough to do P\
Sir G. G. Yes, and I don't want more, which the Home Secretary\
will have, if you allow agitation to excite people to demand what you\
intend to deny.\
Lord Palm. Very neat, but not to the purpose. Who'sa-deniginer\
anything, Mrs. Gamp? But it's one thing to say that you will\
listen to a person's claim, when properly urged, and another to run\
out into the street without your hat to meet him, and give him what\
he asks.\
Mr. Gladstone. The ancient Sibyl, repulsed, increased her demand.\
Lord Palm. Old women are deuced impudent.\
Duke of Somerset. I say to-day, as I said last week, and mean to say\
again next week, that I protest against any new subject being taken\
up until we have decided whether there is to be any reduction of the\
Naval Estimates, and what? I will not be hurried, or compelled to\
arrange changes at short notice.\
Sari de Greg and Bipon. I have no right or desire to imitate the\
peremptory tone of the Duke, but I could wish to have an early idea-\
of what is to be done with the Army Estimates.\
Lord Palm. Both of you ask Gladstone to tell you, as the com-\
mercial traveller said in one of Punch's pictures, what is the least sum\
he can give the waiters without being considered mean?\
Mr. Gladstone. I need hardly say, that such questions are not to be\
treated with levity or answered in haste'; but if it will be any guide to\
the noble Duke and the noble Lord, I may say that any budget which\
does not include a certain reduction in the Estimates connected with\
the department of the former, and a still larger decrease in the calcula-\
tion of expenditure in the department of the latter, will not be a\
budget which I should have any envy to introduce to the Legislature,\
or any great hope of advocating with success.\
Lord Palm. There, now youknow all about it.\
Duke of Somerset. I say that I know nothing.\
Lord de Grey and Bipon. And I must represent that I am entirely\
without practical information.\
Lord Granville. Really this is a complete departure from our arrange-\
ment, which was that we should discuss the question whether any notice\
of the Reform agitation should be taken.\
Lord Russell. I thought that I had settled that. Leave it to me.\
Lord Palm. I see no objections.\
Mr. Milner Gibson. But I see a great many. Nobody in the world\
has more admiration for Lord Russell's character, public and private,\
than I have, and if I had him on board my yacht, he should steer it if\
he liked. (Laughter.) Well, I would forgive him, even if he ran us\
ashore. But he will allow me to say that he has not been so successful\
in the manufacture of Reform Bills as to justify the Liberal party in\
handing over the whole business to his charge.\
Duke of Somerset. Whom do you call Liberal; or, rather, am not I a\
Liberal?\
Lord Russell. And IP\
Lord Stanley of Alderley. I hate rudeness, as everybody knows; but\
I don't know what the what in the world the right honourable\
gentleman means by his inuendo.\
Lord Palm. There, there, what nonsense. We are all Liberals,\
pur sang. Liberals to the marrow, as the Spanish say. Who doubts\
that P Didn't we turn out the Conservatives, and how could we have\
done that if we had not been Liberals P (Great laughter.)\
Lord Granville. If I could only induce you to settle one thing at a\
time. The Premier is for doing nothing, the Foreign Secretary is for\
doing the thing all by himself! the Army and Navy are for being\
attended to first, and the Board of Trade is for an immediate promise\
of a larger Reform Bill. Now, do let us discuss these points seriatim.\
Who is for doing nothing P\
Lord Palm. My dear Granville, you, of course unintentionally,\
rather misrepresent me, or at least fait quite to convey my meaning. I\
strongly advise that before we take up this question, we should be quite\
sure that it is necessary to do so, and that we don't mistake a few\
meetings of nobodies, which can always be got up at the shortest notice,\
for the voice of the country.\
Lord Russell. I shall not be misunderstood, I trust, when I say that\
my noble friend may not contemplate remaining in office so long as\
some other persons may feel it their duty to do, and that this circum-\
stance may induce him, unconsciously, to disregard the necessity for\'97\
for placing ourselves in an advantageous position in the eyes of the\
nation.\
Mr. Gladstone. Entirely, but respectfully, repudiating any participa-\
tion: in the imputation that a certain interested motive exists in the\
bosom of the Noble Lord at the head of the Government, I would also\
say that I think the caution of the noble lord the Minister for Foreign\
Affairs is somewhat in excess of necessity, as in my very humble judg-\
ment the people of this country may, in an hour of crisis, look elsewhere\
for leadership than in the direction anticipated by himself.\
Lord Clarendon. Perhaps so.\
The Lord Chancellor. If I have hitherto refrained from mingling in\
this discussion, it has not been because I did not feel its importance,\
but from my conviction that it was being conducted in a way which\
rendered seriousness superfluous. Now that it appears to take a\
rational form, I have no objection to say that if we are to stand as a\
Liberal Government (it is needless for me to add, that I do not in the\
least care whether we do or do not) we must issue a Reform scheme,\
but it must be a sound and complete one. I will draw one up, and you\
can give your formal assent to it at our next meeting. Excuse my\
going, as I have engagements of importance. [Exit.\
Lord Palm. I like Westbury, do you know?\
Mr. Milner Gibson. Of course we know. it. (Laughing.) But he is\
right about the necessity of a bill.\
Lord Palm. I don't see the necessity, but anyhow, let us see his bill.\
Suppose we meet again in a fortnight.\
Several Voices. Sooner, sooner.\
Lord Palm. Very welL Settle it with Granville. But we under-\
stand\'97mind\'97nobody is pledged to anything.\
Lord Granville. II we were, how could we exist as a Cabinet?\
Lord Palm. That's true. We are charmingly independent, yet\
affectionately united. Human perfectibility, as we used to say about\
sixty years ago. But, I repeat, guieta non movere. [Exit, tehistling.\
Mr. Milner Gibson. The wind will rise without a whistle. M _. [Exit.\
(The Council broke up.) j\
CLERGYMEN MADE SCARCE.\
It used to be a saying, "Make the greatest fool in the family a\
parson." That saying still holds good, with a condition. Make the\
greatest fool in the family a parson, if he will let you. For he will not\
let you unless he is such a fool as the greatest fool in a very foolish\
family. That is, if you have not got a good fat living for him to step\
into as soon as he is ordained.\
It is a bore to be obliged to wear a white "choker," when you prefer\
a black tie or bird's-eye fogle." So it is to be obliged to refrain from\
going about smoking a short pipe if you wish to do so. It is a mon-\
strous bore to have your personal habits controlled and your natural\
freedom limited in any degree by the opinion of old women, or the\
power of old womanly bishops. No consideration but a very high\
pecuniary one would induce a man who has the least respect for himself\
to submit to any such dictation.\
Fancy yourself being in such a position as to be liable to the censure\
of a set of snobs constituting a coroner's jury, because you, a curate,\
choose to study anatomy!\
Then fancy your Rector, who ought to stand by you, and back you\
against those vulgar and impertinent blockheads, truckling to them\
and to their kind, and giving you the sack, to starve, or get your living\
how you can\'97that is, by begging or stealing, unless you possess a patri-\
mony; for once a parson always a parson; and having once entered\
the clerical profession, no other is open to you; neither can you keep a\
shop or a public-house.\
But no. This last case is not to be fancied. No clergyman can be\
capable of the conduct supposed in it. The rumour that the Rector of\
St. Botolph's, Aldgate, has, under circumstances such as those above\
stated, discharged his Curate, the Rev. Mr. Hunt, is evidently an\
invention of the Jesuits, designed to damage the Church of England.\

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.\
CHAPTER III.\'97RULES FOR THE ACTOR AT\
REHEARSAL (Continued).\
But though you should avoid acting at rehearsal, be as particular as\
you like about minute points of action, and business. Minutiae are the\
dots over the Ts and the crosses over the fs of Art. They give it dis-\
tinctness and legibility. Never fail to point out any difficulty that may\
occur to you about the management of the scene in which the action\
takes place. See that the Author is strictly consistent with topogra-\
phical probabilities in the position of his doors, windows and passages.\
And do not, for a moment be put off with a suggestion, that it is pos-\
sible for a person to go off at one entrance and come on at another, by\
help of an outer staircase, or by passing through other rooms.\
These little discussions will animate the rehearsal; and keep the\
Author alive to the importance of strictly keeping up the realistic\
illusion, on which so much depends now-a-days.\
Never let the piece proceed till you are satisfied on any point that\
may seem to you to want clearing up, or any little matter of action that\
may give a good opening] for an argument or a difference of opinion.\
You should never miss an opportunity for the discussion of your art.\
No matter what annoyance supers or ballet-girls may be put to by\
the delay this occasions. Their convenience must succumb to your im-\
provement. 1 am thankful to say that the usage of most English\
theatres is not likely to stand much in the way of your observance of\
this, or indeed any other of these rules for your guidance at rehearsal.\
1 have known a group of girls, at rehearsal, hung up for the purpose\
of a tableau in the flies, in a steel-frame work, with a blaze of gas close\
to their heads. The rehearsal was very properly stopped to allow of\
the discussion of one of those interesting arguments on some point in\
the action of the principals. Did the Manager allow any consideration 1\
for the insignificant girls hanging in their steel-girths, in a temperature\
of 100\'b0, to interfere with this "necessary question of the play?" He\
knew too well what was due to the great principle of subordination,\
which must be omnipotent in a theatre as in a man-of-war. The dis-\
cussion was long; the action difficult to arrange. After being kept\
nearly an hour in the slings, one of the girls was childish enough to\
faint: her companions knew the laws of theatrical discipline too well\
to complain, perhaps they didn't know what had happened. But when\
the little accident was discovered, the mischief was done - the tableau\
was ruined, the stupid child had to be got down, and a substitute pro-\
vided, at much inconvenience to the management, and to the serious\
injury of the picture. But the important point in the action had, in\
the mean time, been satisfactorily settled.\
Always bring your part to rehearsal, keep it in your hand, and use it\
to the last. If you trust to your memory you will run the risk of being\
continually at fault; and, if the Manager will have rehearsals, there can\
be no occasion why you should give him your time at home as well as\
in the theatre.\
Besides, with your part in your hand, you can always answer any\
complaint of the Author, if you talk bad. grammar, or neglect punctua-\
tion, by throwing the blame on the copyist. If the copyist have written\
nonsense, as is highly probable, be scrupulous in speaking it. It is not\
your business to correct his blunders, and you have a right to say that\
all you have to do is to deliver what is put into your hands, not to make\
sense of it. It will be your duty to impress this pointedly on the\
Author, and so revenge yourself, pleasantly, for any indignity he may\
have put upon you, by calling you back, or finding fault, as is the way\
with such people.\
Should the Author, notwithstanding these hints, and the unspoken\
warning of your manner, persist in such interference, do not let him be\
left in any doubt as to your proper resentment for such unwarrantable\
liberties. Shrug your shoulders, be silent altogether, caricature his\
directions or delivery, suggest that perhaps if he is dissatisfied with\
your manner of playing the part, he will find some other Actor to play it.\
The very least you can do, 3 your position render you timid of adopting\

253\
this dignified mode of remonstrance, is to shut him up with an emphatic\
assurance that "it will be all right at night."\
Whenever you are not speaking, or actively engaged in the business\
of the scene, there can be no reason why you should overstrain your\
mind by attention to what is passing among the other characters.\
These little breaks will give you an opportunity for relieving the\
tedium of rehearsal by a cheering gossip with your brother and sister\
performers, or a little gentlemanly flirtation. When you are off the\
stage, take care that it shall be a matter of some difficulty to find you,\
when again wanted. Nothing enhances an Actor's consequence more\
than to nave his name shouted aloud all about the theatre. It is besides\
some little compensation for your wearisome detention to be able in\
this way to inflict on Manager, Stage-Manager and Author some portion\
of the annoyance which they are so unfeelingly inflicting upon you.\
If there is a house of entertainment contiguous to the stage-door, as\
there always ought to be, you may seize these intervals of repose to\
get the refreshment your harassed mind and weary body will certainly\
require. You will also find the nearest bar a good place for artistic\
gossip, and for cultivating agreeable social relations, for which the Actor\
has but too few opportunities outside the theatre.\

Scene\'97At the end of some Act or other, the bottom of the Sea, anywhere.\
The entire width of the Stage will be occupied by a large Aquarium,\
reaching up to within eight feet of the Flies." This will contain\
real Sharks, young Whales, Porpoises, and other smaller fish, all\
alive, alive oh! There will also be real Rocks, and real Submarine\
Vegetation. The Submarine Telegraph wires will be seen passing\
across the Stage. Music: tremolo and mysterious, just like what\
would be heard in the depths of the Ocean.\
On the opening of the Scene, real sand-burrowing Bivalves discovered\
amusing themselves: real Grey Mullets, real Madrepores, and genuine\
Actiniadat flitting about in the distance. Wild Periwinkles, Chitons,\
and Scallops seen clinging to the rocks; and, in the foreground, a\
Goby is discovered feeding on a Codium tomentosum; while other\
really happy Zoophytes disport themselves in their native element.\
Music: 'lThe_Sea! the Sea!"\
Enter above, that is, on the surface of the water, a small boat, containing\
Richard Gradgrass, the villain of the piece, ana young Whest-\
ley, the rightful heir to the property, whatever it is. Marian, the\
heroine, in love with Whestlet\'97with a song\'97is steering the boat\
while Richard is rowing.\

Marian. Never!\
[Struggle, during which Marian works the air-pump, and Whestlet\
*\'bb below, attempting to rescue the will from a fierce Shark, who\
will be trained for the purpose. Marian is becoming exhausted,\
when a shot, from somewhere or other, is fired, and Richard\
falls, capsising, however, the boat. Richard sinks to the\
bottom, the Shark leaves the will, and attacks him; Whestley\
clutches the document, Marian clings with one hand to the boat,\
now topsy-turcey, and an air-pump, which she works. Her arm\
gets weaker and weaker.\
Marian. I faint! I die! Help!\
[Whestley having received no air for a few seconds, rushes madly\
to and fro. The Shark, diving off with Richard in his mouth, ts\
caught by Submarine Telegraph wires. Whestley in pantomime,\
expresses that a good idea has just struck him. He seizes the\
wires, and swings himself up, so as to grip the boat with hit legs;\
then, with another effort, he gains the surface, putting his arm\
round Marian just as she is sinking, sits on the boat, keel upper-\
most, supporting Marian's senseless form with his right arm,\
and with the hand waving aloft, in triumph, the important will.\

When in all her full-blown beauty she makes summer in the street,\
I'm quite nervous when I meet her, and I turn as red as beet.\
My carnations set me thinking of the damask on her cheek,\
The blush rose wears her colours and the tulips all but speak;\
If the flower in white, the lily, will be fair he must allow\
That the snow and he are flattered by being likened to her brow.\
She's the standard of perfection, she's a nonpareil, I swear,\
With her violet eyes bewitching and her stream of chestnut hair,\
She's the pink of\'97no, that's hackneyed\'97and she lives at Dais ton now,\
Where on Sundays, spruce and smiling, I transplant myself from Slough.\

Early was the passion planted, deeply rooted it became,\
And I made a new auricula perennial with her name;\
But she raked up some old grievance, and a meddler came between,\
So I wore the (weeping) willow, and said cutting things of Green.\
He was bulbous in his figure and but seedy in his clothes,\
His hair was rather carrotty, and it matched his turn-up nose,\
He was older than the lady, and did something at a club.\
And I've heard, but this sub rosd, that he liked a little shrub.\
Peace be to him, and his ashes, though he never cared for trees,\
And tied his stockfs) up tightly in the hands of two trustees:\
He was happy, with one drawback, no young branches to the vine,\
Which I bear with resignation, as they would have soon been mine.\
She has doffed her weeds to please me and resumed geranium bows,\
Through the vista of the future all appears conleur de rose;\
For she calls me (christened Petbr) her sweet J?., and bliss divine,\
Has named the day when I shall say that she is Jessie mine.\

HOW TO QUASH THE QUACKS.\
My dear Dr. Punch, '' '' ''\
There is a cry against Quack Doctors. How can they be\
crushed P For the protection of our fools, they ought to be stamped\
out: just as we stamp upon the stoats for the protection of our phea-\
sants. I think. I see three ways in which the heel might be brought\
down upon them:\'97\
1. The Medical Council has the power to proceed against all persons\
giving medical advice, who are not qualified to do so.\
2. The Law Courts have the power to nonsuit any claimant of a fee\
for such advice, if such claimant (as most Quacks are) be unqualified to\
practise.\
3. And the Press has the power to reject all quack advertisements,\
and to expose as much as possible the foul proceedings of the Quacks,\
by stinging leading articles, and by copious reports of cases where they\
come to grief, as a brace of them did lately, much to my delight.\
As regards the Press, decency is surely the best policy. I never buy\
a paper that inserts vile quack advertisements, and I have very little\
doubt that there are hundreds like myself, who make this a strict rule.\
Any one who buys a newspaper that publishes quack puffs, I regard as\
an aider and abettor of the Quacks. Cease to buy such newspapers,\
and their proprietors will cease to publish such advertisements; and\
thereby the Quacks will cease to prey upon the fools, who, by the lure\
of puffery, are drawn into their dens.\
Wishing for success in your philanthropic efforts to annihilate these\
vermin, believe me, my dear Dr. Punch, yours admiringly,\
A. Crusher.\
P.S. I hear that nearly every Quack now keeps his private carriage,\
with the money he obtains under false medical pretences. If such ras-\
cals had their rights, there should rather be one public carriage only\
for them all. To a man of your sagacity I hardly need to add, that I\
allude to the police van.\

world a fact already sufficiently patent. We suppose (or as vulgarians\
say, we expect) that his meaning is, that he wishes to sell his property\
in some paper. By way of compliment to the Literary Men whom he\
addresses, he says that literary ability is not necessary, and that the\
affair is "easily managed." This must be one of Mr. Cobden's\
favourite journals, something made up of cuttings from other papers,\
and without leading articles. Or, perhaps, the usual leading article\
may be a congratulation to the inhabitants of the town enlightened by\
the newspaper in question, that the Great Travelling Circus is to be\
with them on Tuesday, "when," the accomplished Editor is sure,\
"it will receive that patronage which Stickinthemud never refuses to\
legitimate and honourable enterprise." These Italics are a well-merited\
Itick at a conjuror who departed without paving for the editorial puffs\
Or, for we have not, of course, the faintest idea as to what part of the\
South Coast i3 blessed with a journal requiring no literary ability, the\
Editor will have to apply his fine faculties to scathing satire against\
the sanitary authorities, whose vulgar and un-English intermeddling\
attempt to prevent our respected townsman, Mr. Pigg Jobber, from\
keeping swine where his venerated father kept them before him, next\
door to the hospital, excites the just indignation of those who know\
the facts." This (is the usual style of country newspapers which\

LETTER FROM MR. WHALLEY.\
Dear Mr. Punch,\
You laugh at me, but I think lhat\
of justice, and will own that upon the p\
am right m sounding a warning to England.\
A new invention has been introduced into Society. It\
is called a Rafraichistevr. I have seen the advertisement\
in your own columns, hut I am sure that you will never,\
for the sake of a miserable fifty guineas, allow the announce-\
ment to appear again. The article consists of two glass\
tubes nearly joined at a right angle, and held together by a\
cross piece, and its avowed object is to enable a lady (at\
present ladies only use it) to blow perfume, from a bottle,\
over the face of any friend whom she may wish to honour\
by that attention.\
Sir, can the most stupid person fail to see that this is a\
Popish device, intended tofamiliarise people with sprinkling?\
From the Jockey Club Perfume, or the Ess Bouquet to what\
is called Holt Water, is hut one step downwards. The\
Jesuits have introduced the thing; a foreigner, and pro-\
bably a Catholic, sells it; and it is called by a name from\
the language of France, the Eldest Daughter of the Church\
of Rome.\
Pray, Sir, be serious, and smash this Papistical abomina-\
tion.\
Yours (in Protestantism)\
Plas Modoc, Ruabon. G. H. Whalley.\
[We shan't. We rather like the operation, when the\
operatrix is as lovely as any lady should be who presumes\
to approach The Presence.\'97Punch.]\
The Greatest Wonder of Spiritualism.\
In a book published on behalf of the Davenports, those\
jugglers are declared to have been, in America, transported\
through the air. Considering their spiritual pretensions,\
we may wonder that, since their arrival in this country, so\
far from having been transported, they have never yet even\
been taken up.\

FINE FEATHERS FOR FINE BIRDS.\
Vkry wondrous are the\

or jockey cap being consi-\
dered much newer. It is\
not nearly so becoming,\
and has no grace of form\
about it; but it is the\
fashion, so why waste\
words on its demerits.\
These melon caps are\
mostly made of grey felt,\
trimmed round simply\
with a <jrot grain ribbon,\
striped with white and\
blaok, red and black, Ac.\
To add to their coquettish\
ftppeuranoe, either a bird'b\
wing or a falcon's plume\
is added. \'95 *

The face: no I am often\

use it is. Bird* of prey\
are in much request for\
ornamenting hata; tbo\
heads only being used,\
surrounded with a small J\
aureole ot feathers. The\
heads of parroquets and I\
pigeons, which axe not so\
ugly as those of screech owls, hawks, and falcons, are also sometimes used as hat decorations."\
A hawk's head on a lady's hat must lo^k a little hawkward: and a cap with an owl's\
beak on it cannot be very captivating. It may be thought, too that a bird s wm?, when\
\'abwn upon aTwoinan's hid, must look a little flighty. \}lats n'import^ La Mode le veui:\
Udwho will dare dispute the dictates of Queen Fashion P "No matter how ugly, so long\
\
as it be something new." Such is usually\
her royal mandate to the milliuers. And the\
milliners are prompt in obeying her behests,\
for, the oftener the fashions change, the better\
for their fortunes. Some new device in dress\
is started well nigh every week, quite as frightful\
as the owls' heads on the ugly melon caps, and\
as useless as the veils which are only worn for or-\
nament. But when we ever notice our wife\
wearing any novel decoration, we never dream\
of being rude enough to ask her what's the use\
of it. We know quite well its use is just to\
tempt ladies to purchase it, and so put money in\
the purses of the ilesdames Mantalini.\
The human race is quite as avida notitatis in\
this present year of grace, as it was said to be\
when people used to talk in Latin of the latest\
fashions out: and the greed that women natu-\
rally feel for a new dress, of course becomes a\
source of profit to their milliners. Husbands\
and fathers may deplore this taste for novelty,\
because they have to pay for it: and as fine\
ladies very often make sad havoc with the money\
of the men who have to dress them, their\
wearing of hawks' feathers is remarkably appro-\
priate. Many a little duck, directly she gets\
married, becomes a bird of prey, merely through\
her wish to make herself, in her gay new\
plumage, look like a bird of paradise.\
Jowett Confuted.\
Dr. Pusey has, in a letter to the Tones, main-\
taining a severe theological doctrine, declared\
questionable by the Privy Council, demonstrated\
that doctrine in a single word. His letter con-\
tains the word "reliable." It is manifest that\
the use of such a word as reliable" by any one\
who, like Dr. Pusey, ought to know better, is an\
offence which, if not repented of, must entail un-\
limited liability.\
A Good Man\
Cork Cutter.\
tor a Long Voyage\'97A\
FORENSIC MEDICINE AND POLITICAL PATHOLOGY.\
Titles and Truth separated many years ago by mutual consent. A\
Bank which, from its firmness, was originally symbolical of earth, might\
now with more felicity be called a Butterboat, seeing how suddenly it\
may be broken. Mottoes make no pretensions to veracity. In vino\
Veritas is branded with fraud, unless, indeed, Veritas and cognac are\
synonymous terms.\
We make these remarks simply to introduce two popular manuals,\
from which we propose to extract a few pungent paragraphs. One\
requires no comment; and if its neighbour, Political Pathology, fails to\
convey any clear idea, it is satisfactory to reflect that many sciences,\
including Medicine and Music, have long enjoyed a similar privilege\'97\
that of concealing in curious phraseology their cherished mysteries :\'97\
Rickets in Bankruptcy.\'97To a humane mind there is no more affecting\
spectacle than that which is presented by rickets in Bankruptcy; ana\
philanthropists may well pause and weep over the stunted objects of\
legislative negligence which crowd the so-called "Superior" Courts of\
our vast Metropolis. In passing along Basinghall Street, we are daily\
in danger of tumbling over one of those cachectic infants, whose natural\
flaccidity has been aggravated by its being injudiciously puffed. Some\
hydropathic doctors, we observe, have recently been throwiug cold\
water upon it; but this mode of treatment, while it seriously alarms its\
anxious parent, has hitherto failed to inspire it with any additional\
vigour. Solicitous for its welfare, he alone listens with patience to all\
its little appeals.\
Tongue-tied.\'97Real Property.\'97A lustts naturee is now being exhibited\
in Liucolu's Inn Fields, near the Boyal College of Surgeons, which has\
perplexed many distinguished physiologists. The offspring of parents\
largely interested in land, with beautiful features of exquisite symmetry,\
and wearing a most inviting smile, strange to say, it has no power over\
the organs essential to articulation. The little thing seems pleased\
when any one notices it, which is very seldom, and is delighted when\
being transferred from hand to hand, to facilitate which, machinery is\
provided of the most ingenious description. With all this, one remark-\
ablefact remains': little Bethell (as it is fondly called), though addressed\
in the most endearing terms by him who takes a parental interest in it,\
has never yet answered! Would not an operation of some sort be\
desirable under these painful circumstances P We should he glad to\
hear it make its existence known, even if it did so by something very\
like that token of emptiness\'97a wail.\
Cacoithes loguendi \'97 Maxillary Convulsions. \'97 St. Vitus's dance,\
startling as it is, must yield in vehemence to St. Stephens's. It com-\
monly attacks the youngest members of the legislative family\'97the\
sufferer being seized with an irrepressible desire to gel on his legs. No\
sooner is this effected, than his utterance becomes oracular, and after\
throwing off a large amount of declamation, the patient is sensibly\
relieved; while his friends, overcome tby sympathy, feel themselves\
completely exhausted. If long confined to the House, the unhappy\
man will probably Bink into a state of chronic boredom. He should,\
therefore, as soon as convenient, be removed to a purer atmosphere.\
Spontaneous Eruptions\'97Autumnal Rash.\'97To this disorder Englishmen\
are said to be more subject than Foreigners.\'97It sometimes shows itself\
at Mechanics' Institutions, but more frequently at Agricultural Meet-\
ings, when South-downs are brought on the tapis simultaneously with\
China and Japan, and President Lincoln is impaled on the Short-\
horns of a dilemma. The patient, if a Minister, becomes garrulous,\
and betrays a sweet simplicity in telling all his little affairs to those that\
sit under him. For example, he will speak at great length about the\
House of which his seven years' lease will shortly expire, and show how\
he has performed his covenants by exhibiting his Policy. If he com-\
plains ot a chill from the House being too cold for him, it is an almost\
unerring sign of approaching dissolution.\
Tories' Nostalgia\'97Home-Qfficc Sickness.\'97Mountaineers campaigning\
in distant climes are often overtaken by an intense longing for their\
native hills. The malady is called home-sickness. Tories' Nostalgia is,\
in like manner, a morbid condition caused by long involuntary absence\
from place. The melancholy Member, separated from patronage and\
all that he holds most dear, will sit for hours on a bench, gazing at\
vacancy. As the memorv of lapsed bishoprics dawns upon him, some\
natural tears he sheds, akin to those which fell when he and bis lost\
companions, long ago, with faltering steps and slow, from office took\
their solitary way. Sometimes he fancies he can improve his condition\
by going down to the country, and getting up an exhibition of dissolv-\
ing views, and, emboldened by a little genial applause, will often terrify\
his rustic audience by conjuring with an empty sack which once held\
wheat at eighty shillings a quarter.\

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.\
;CHAP. IV.\'97SOME GENERAL RULE3 FOR ACTING.\
Before attempting to lay down rules for the guidance of Actors in\
particular lines of business, there are some general principles, appli-\
cable to all acting, which must be carefully borne in mind.\
It is very commonly said, that the object of the stage is "to hold the\
mirror up to Nature, and show the age and body of the time its form\
and purpose." This is a maxim of Shakspeabe's, and like the rest of\
his directions to the players in Hamlet, may have been all very well in\
the infancy of the theatre, but you might just as well say that we\
should bring back the naked boards with plain curtains at the back,\
the indication of changes of scene by printed placards, and the few\
ragged serving-men, who did duty for our crowds of supers, because\
such were the appointments of Shakspeabe's stage, as that we should\
accept his immature conceptions of the Actor's art.\
Like all other branches of the fine arts, the representation of the\
stage begins without Art, and ends without Nature. It passes from\
child-like imitation to imaginative invention. Shakspeabe's Actors\
were in the first stage; you are, or should be, in the last. You may\
therefore safely conclude that if holding the mirror up to Nature be\
compatible with other and higher objects, there is no objection to it;\
but that if Nature puts you out, as she is pretty sure to put out all who\
are not slavishly subservient to her, she may be thrust on one side,\
without hesitation.\
Never forget that while on the stage, you ought to consider\
yourself the most important figure in the picture. In the same\
way that you should, as a general rule, avoid distracting your mind\
by any consideration of the other parts in the piece, and concentrate\
yourself on your own, it is important, as regards appearance, that\
you should think, above all things, of yourself. Never mind the\
part. That is the Author's business. It is yours to produce a favour-\
able impression on the public, and to enhance your value in the eyes\
of the Manager. For this purpose, you must never allow yourself]\
to be disfigured. This rule applies especially to the ladies. Ifi\
the Author forget himself so far as to give you the part of an old, ugly,\
or disagreeable female, do your best to defeat his malignant intention,\
by making up as youthfully, prettily, and cpquettishly as possible.\
For the same reason, decline wuenever possible, characters which the\
Aut hor means to be odious, or if you must act them, take out as much\
as,you can of their offensive elements. You will thus be a pleasant,\
instead of a repulsive figure, in the picture; the public eye and mind\
will be pleased; and should the Author, as he very probably will,\
grumble\'97for these people are never satisfied\'97you can have the\
satisfaction of feeling that you have done him a kindness against his\
will.\
The stage is, even now, not without examples of artists so deplor-\
ably mistaken as habitually to forget themselves in their parts. They\
are so deficient in self-respect, that they allow themselves to become\
mere puppets in the Author's hands, and to be made odious, ugly, old, i\
or disagreeable at his pleasure. What is the consequence? The j\
public talks a great deal about the part, but it overlooks the personality\
of the Actor, whose mistake thus properly punishes itself by reducing\
him to insignificance.\
Always reserve yourself till you have to sneak. In real life people\
habitually betray emotion or passion by their looks and gestures, while\
others are speaking, or while watching an action; hut the Author has\
given you words to express what you feel, ana it is never wise to\
anticipate them. One may now and then see Actors whose looks and\
byeplay are a perpetual comment on the action of the scene, just as\
they are in real life. This is at once an impertinence to their comrades,\
and an intrusion on the attention of the audience, which ought to be\
concentrated on the speaker. Guard yourself, therefore, against let-\
ting out what you feel, till your cue comes, theu suddenly throw, off\
your immobility of face and figure, and "up and. at them." This will\
give relief and vivacity to your impersonation.\
The intervals during which the other Actors are speaking should be\
to you so many opportunities of repose\'97breathing times for fresh\
effort. Make up the most agreeable face, and take the most graceful\
gesture ypu can, and keep it, whenever you are not delivering what\
is set down for, you."\
Never allow yourself to be thrust into the back-ground by those\
who are with you on the stage. Get well back, whenever possible, so\
as to bring your own face well in the public eye, and to keep your\
interlocutor out of it.\
Applause is the real test of the Actor's success. Go in for it with\
determination. There are many little arts which may be successfully\
employed to awaken the apathy of a dull house.\
Among the surest is to be lond and emphatic towards the conclusion\
of a rapidly-delivered speech, being careful to "take the stage" at the\
same moment, and to strike an attitude as near the proscenium as\
possible. This, with an appealing look at the house, seldom fails to\
bring down a good round.\
Always insist on having a good speech for your exit. It is cruel to\
send an Actor off the stage in dead silence, as Authors will often do, if\
not properly looked after, on the seltish plea that a striking speech at\
this particular point, would he inconsistent with the character, or incom-\
patible with the general effect.\
See that your walk on the stage is carefully distinguished from that\
of people in actual life. This applies both to serious and comic acting.\
The stage walk is, however, so generally practised in the profession,\
that it is hardly necessary to insist on this rule.\
Your stage voice should be equally distinguishable from that used by\
you when off the stage. I do not refer merely to the greater dis-\
tinctness of enunciation required to make yourself audible in a large\
space, but to the management of the larynx, and organs of speech\
altogether. Ladies will find it useful to practise a special stage\
gamut, both for pathos and fun, which, as a general rnle, should bring\
into play a set of notes hardly ever resorted to in real life.\
If your part is a bad one, do not be led away by the Author's invi-\
dious assurance that something may still be done with it. You have\
only two courses before you\'97to let it down by the run, or to force it\
up into exaggerated importance. Which course is to be followed in\
any case, must be determined by circumstances. Either will be a\
caution to the Author to treat you with more consideration in future.\
"Cauls" used to be much trusted in as preservatives from drowning.\
They are still often useful in keeping afloat theatrical reputations.\
Always work for a call at the fall of the curtain. If one comes, how-\
ever faint and doubtful, take it boldly. It will be sure to swell to\
enthusiasm on your appearance behind the float. The public loves\
to recognise everything which shows a genial confidence in its judg-\
ment and generositv. If the call do not come of itself, it is as well\
to have some friends in the house to remind the public of what it\
owes you. It is rare, indeed, that a generous example is not followed\
by a British public. In the case of the ladies, it is hardly necessary\
to say, that a little timely precaution may always secure not only\
a call, but a shower of bouquets. They may be purchased at a\
moderate rate, but of imposing size and brilliant appearance, for this\
purpose, in Covent Garden Market, which is so conveniently situated\
for our principal theatres.\

THE AWFUL APPARITION\
That appeared to Mb. Skeary,on getting Home after the Spiritual Seance\
(and little Supper), and which had such am Effect ok his Nebve\
he could mot qo to business the next dat.\
THE BIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT\
SOUTHAMPTON.\
The Place is the 1\\ si mastership. The Man is Mr.\
William Cooper. The qualification of the latter for the\
former consists in a service of thirty years as Chief Clerk\
in the Southampton Post Office, and a special knowledge\
of its business acquired during that time. Ma. Cooper is\
a. sound Liberal, but the claims of the man to occupy the\
place are so much greater than those of anybody else, that\
they would be recognised by any Conservative Government\
which dispensed patronage with the least regard to merit.\
A Government professing Liberal principles would, if it\
acted on any principle at all but that of favouritism,\
appoint Mr. Cooper to the Southampton l'ost mastership,\
although, instead of being on the right side, he were an\
out-and-out Derbyite, and it were nis fault that South-\
ampton, as far as she is represented at all, is represented\
by a Tory. These things being considered, we should not\
wonder if the right man, Mr. Cooper, were actually put by\
the Postmaster-General under Loss Palmerston into the\
right place\'97the Postmastership of Southampton.\
i MORE GERMAN-ENGLISH. 1\
The satisfaction which Mr. Punch expressed, some time\
ago, at the progress of the English language in Bonn, has\
excited emulation in other parts of the Continent. He\
has received several interesting letters from worthy Ger-\
mans, eager to show that they too have mastered our tongue,\
and he selects a notice which is hung up in the bed-rooms\
of an hotel in the City of Evil Smells, on the Rhine. He\
has not tried the place, and therefore abstains from\
crowding it with the myriads of travellers who would rush\
thither, did he name it. But if the physical entertainment\
offered there be as rood as the literary entertainment\
afforded by the notification, the Hotel must be a very\
excellent one:\'97\
"TO MY GUEST.\
"In the interest of the Visitors who will honour my hotel with\
their presence, i dont fail to inform that they have not to give any\
Drinkings Money the people employed in my house, and that also\
the charge to bring their Luggages to the Diligences and Steamers\
is incluaed in the Account they have to Pay and therefore nobody car*\
request somewhat to a Traveller by what Pretext it would be."\
Epitaph on as Angler.\'97" Hooked it."\
THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT.\
Success in Parliamentary practice is not to be obtained in a day,\
and we in England, who after hundreds of troublesome years, are now\
bringing our Legislative Assemblies into something like working order,\
should not withhold from our Continental friends any assistance that may\
encourage them in the excellent constitutional course they have lately\
adopted.\
We regret to observe that a want of harmony characterises the pro-\
ceedings of the Italian Parliament. 0 Italy! Land of song! can such\
things be! Melancholy, but true. Is there not a remedy? Ay,\
there is. Where are those musical swallows flying, flying South after\
the London Season is over? We wish no possible harm to Victor-\
Emmanuel, but iwouldn't he, just to oblige a lady, abdicate in favour\
of Madame Grisi, to be henceforth known only as Queen of Italy.\
Could His Holiness object to this? Wherever the capital of Italy,\
wouldn't every one, ay even note, flock to hear Queen Julia the\
First open the Session with "Casta Diva?" Cialdini might be\
entrusted with a double bass, a big drum, or a trumpet, on any one of\
which he might learn a few notes, unobjectionable to an audience and\
pleasant to himself.\
The cast of the new Administration should be as follows :\'97\
Minister of War Signor Mario (as the Count A Imaviva).\
(Mlle. Alboni (as the Page in the\
leader of the Opposition . - A Huguenots, with the Sotuj of " No, No,\
( No, Nor1)\
Minister of Finance .... Signor Bonconi.\
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . Sionor Taguatico.\
Hone Secretary Sionor Giuguni.\
Minister of Religion, d-c. . . . Signor Ciampi.\
Usher (the Gentleman known in books) N. N. (Nobody Nows ) To be filled\
of the Libretto as . . . . ( up as occasion may require.\
Tlie whole under the personal'Direction of Sionor Costa.\
The report of the first Sitting might be something of this sort:\'97\
The proceedings were commenced by Signor Costa taking his seat in\
the orchestra, which is so situated as to divide the Members of the\
Opposition from those siding with the Government. The entrance of\
this distinguished leader was the signal for a burst of irrepressible\
applause, in which the wives, daughters, cousins, and other female\
relations of the Senators, thronging the galleries, most enthusiastically\
joined. Order being restored, Signor Costa spoke a few words good\
humouredly to the First "Violin, who replied in a semi-tone, which\
was inaudible in the reporters' gallery, and, after tapping his desk\
sharply with his baton, he flourished it once in the air, and then, as\
one man, the orchestra gave the first note of the overture to\
Italian* in Algeria. The performance of this great work was most\
admirable.\
The motion that "This House do form itself into a Committee of\
Druids" having been acceded to, Signor Ciampi, the Minister of\
Religion, having in the kindest manner undertaken the music of Oroveto,\
led the Ah, del tedio al giogo indegno," in which the entire Senate\
solemnly joined. We would suggest that another time the Members\
of the Opposition should have their white beards and wigs ready to\
slip on directly the chorus commences, as some delay was occasioned\
by their want of foresight.\
At "Norma tiene, le cinge la chioma" the House rose in a body, and\
Queen Julia majestically entered the building, and having ascended\
the steps leading to the Throne, at once commenced the immortal\
"Casta Diva."\
It will not be out of place to remind those Members of the Legis-\
lature, who are unacquainted with, or unable to sing the music, that\
they ought not to attempt to join in here and there, nor to venture\
upon any other melody than that set down for them. We would\
respectfully point out to the ladies in the gallery, that they should avoid\
turning over the leaves of their books during the solos. All these\
defects will, doubtless, be remedied before our next Sitting.\
After the song and chorus the Queen retired, and Signor Mario\

House) declared, in recitative, the Parliament opened. Strange to say,\
we never heard him in finer voice.\
Siqnor Roncom, who was greeted with long and loud applause, then\
rose and sang. The first part of his speech, on the Budget, was chiefly\
addressed to the country members; he began\'97" Udife, udite, ORustici,\
attend, nonfiatate." (Bravo, Figaro. Bravo /) The honourable Member\
begged to remind the gentlemen, whose applause was no doubt ironical,\
that he appeared 1 here as Doctor Dulcamara. \{Bravo! Bravissimo /) He\
continued \'97" CK to sono quel gran medico, dottore Enriclopcdico\
chiamato Dulcamara." Here the Minister of Finance went oft from\
andante into prestissimo, and we were totally unable to follow him.\
The honourable gentleman concluded the movement with (as near as\
we could catch the words) "piii d' un' afflitta vedova dipiangere cetib."\
Chorus. (Oh!)\
He then made some further explanations. But what with the\
volubility of the singer, the unsteadiness of the chorus, who however\
managed to chime in effectively at the finale, and the fact of the band\
being just a trifle too loud, we were unable to hear distinctly more\
than the first words, which sounded to us remarkably like "Cost\
chiaro." At the conclusion there was a great deal of applause, which\
was immediately repressed by N. N. and the other ushers.\
The remainder of the debate, we, for the benefit of the English who\
are so greatly interested in our progress, transfer to our columns from\
the note-book of an eminent Translator of Libretti, who was present\
in an official capacity.\

MR. MANTALINI IN HYSTERICS.\
nd has it come to this P We\
have lived to be attacked by\
Mr. Mantalini. Even the\
man-milliner's gentle soul\
has been aroused against\
us. "Thelittle dogs, Tray,\
Blanche, and Sweetheart,"\
barked at King Lear, he said,\
but what a very little dog\
whines against Mr. Punch.\
If it were not rather a\
vulgar little dog, we should\
say it was the tiny one\
which the Prince in the\
fairy tale had to find for his\
Papa.\
Mr. Mantalini (as the\
other milliners know), when\
wearied of turning the\
mangle, looked out for\
other occupation, and ulti-\
mately became editor of Le\
Follet. We knew this, but\
never told, and we have\
been very kind to him, for\
the sake of many merry\
memories. But we regret\
to say, that "Alfred" has turned naughty, and scolds us\
demnably. He is a very naughty Alfred, for ne sets out with a\
declaration that he wishes to imitate another Alfred, now extinct,\
who presided over "a thousand worlds, peopled with millions of\
little opera-dancers." What would Madame Mantalini say to that?\
Alfred is very spiteful, and much as we like him; we must ask\
Madame Mantalini to give him ever so little a rap with a stay-bone\
on his little knuckles, for spoiling so pretty a paper as Le Follet with\
this wilful, wayward writing:\'97\
"Punch used to be demnably funny, and his pippetty-poppetty pokes\
made one laugh like\'97like demnition. But what a demd falling off. None\
but a very low and ungenteel mind could have found anything rude in\
what proceeded from our angel of a little gold pen, and perfumed ink\
(oh, so nice, dem it), when we were writing a little tickley-wickley\
article about our patronesses, the adored and enchanting ladies of\
fashion. The rude beast\'97he shall be horsewhipped till he cries out\
demnably. Our first will not prove to be our last word with Punch.\
though such low company gives us a headache, as if fifty thousand\
bonnet boxes had tumbled down upon our head at once."\
Now, Alfred, this is very unkind. When have we been so\
\
cruel and wicked, dear fellow, as to accuse you of meaning any-\
thing at all? Ana why will you, abandoning your own sweet manner,\
break out in the manner of the other ana extinct Alfred, whose\
effort in the satirical line, as you say, caused Mr. Punch to leave him\
thenceforth and for ever in his own cesspool. You are very smart,\
we allow. Your little onslaught is exactly in the usual gentlemanly\
style in which Mr. Punch is abused. But then, most other people\
Alfred, who launch these epigrams, have reasons for it. Mr.\
Punch has either refused their rubbish, or castigated their folly, or\
done them a kindness, or in some way justified their spite. But for\
you, Mantalini, dear, he has never had anything but the prettiest\
compliments\'97sugar-plum critiques\'97rosewater crackers. There is a\
compliment in the veryarticle you are pettish about, pet, if you could\
only understand it. What has gone wrong with the poppet of Le\
Follet.? Has it been eating too many mince-pies for luck before\
Christmas f That is sad, but Madame must give it some grueL We\
cannot be angry with our Alfred, but he is a demnition goosey-\
gander.\
METEOROLOGICAL APPOINTMENT.\
Everybody has heard of the Clerk of the Weather Office, but nobody\
ever supposed that the Office so called was one of the Government\
Offices, notwithstanding the existence of Admiral Pitzroi's depart-\
ment. Still the gallant Admiral who presides over that department is\
not generally imagined to have any control over the weather. It is,\
however, easy to foresee the questions which will occur to many single-\
minded persons on reading this announcement, extracted from the\
Edinburgh Courant:\'97\
"Sdpekihtendesck of Northern Liohts.\'97Mr. Youkc, Engineer of the Light-\
house Steamer Pharos, has received the appointment of Superintendent of Northern\
Lights, vacant by the resignation of Mr. Scott."\
Is it possible t hat the Northern Lights, of which Mr. Scott has\
resigned the superintendence, are the same as those referred to by a\
namesake of Mr. Scott's in the Lay of the 1/txt Minstrel?\'97\
"And ho knew by the streamers that shot so bright.\
That the Spirits wore riding the Northern Light. '*\
And has the Admiralty actually appointed Mr. Young to superintend\
the Aurora Borealis?\

The Cambridge anthorities have given out this as the subject for the\
Latin epigram this year:\'97\
"MUIe addo catenas,\

They request Mr. Punch to inform competitors that there is to be no\
allusion to the Davenport humbug, suggestive though the adjective\
may be.\

In a recent police case, a matron of the washerwomanish persuasion\
was charged with passing a bad half-crown in payment to a small trades-\
man of the nation absurdly called the Jewish persuasion. She did not\
seem to disclaim knowledge that the coin was not from the Queen's\
Mint, but defended herself by alleging that the complainant had a bit of\
lead under the scale in which he put the article sold. It was Sheridan\
over again\'97the coachman said, A bad shilling, your Honour!"\'97" All\
right; yours is a bad coach." The tradesman gave false weight, the\
customer gave false money. Was this a case for legal interference, or\
was it not an instance of the healthy way in which commerce adjusts\
itself, if only let alone? The plaint was dismissed on low grounds, as\
usual, but the Magistrate might have appealed to the laws of nigh politi-\
cal economy. We rather admire that washerwoman, but should not\
care to entrust her with our best shirt.\

then immediately take the precaution of turning\
the stopcocks of their waterpipes, so as to set\
the water dripping, if ever so slowly, that will\
suffice effectually to prevent the water in the\
pipes from freezing, and the pipes from con-\
sequently bursting.\

SOMETHING LIKE A SCULLING MATCH!\
Rowing readers of the Brittol Mercury, on Saturday, the seven-\

Great Boat Race.\'97Tbo race between Frank Eilsbt and David Coomb(son of\
the late ex-champion), for \'a3200, from Putney In Margatt, came off on Tuesday. The\
betting finally aettled at 6 and 7 to 4 on Coombes. They got off to an excellent start.\
Coombes won by 45 seconds.\
The writer well may call this a "great" race, if it be true that the\
two men did really row from Putney all the way to Margate. And\
how surprising that the winner in such a match as this should have\
headed his opponent by but five and forty seconds! It must have\
been a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull well together. Matches\
usually take place from Putney merely up to Mortlake: but instead of\
fancying there has been a misprint, we prefer to put on record, for the\
benefit of some Mac aula y of the future, this proof of the gigantic\
powers of our oarsmen which this British print describes.\
CANNIBALISM IN THE LAND OF CAKES.\
At the last meeting of the Anthropological Society, according to a\
report of that learned body's proceedings, the question of cannibalism\
was taken up rather warmly by Mr. M. Clat, a native of Caithness,\
who was anxious to exculpate his ancestors from such a charge." Mr.\
Clat argued that "the fact of the finding of a single jaw-bone of a\
child among shells and bones, the refuse of food, was no proof of\
cannibalism." Certainly. An isolated fact is no proof. It is ques-\
tionable evidence. But what if that particular fact did prove can-\
nibalism F Of itself it would establish nothing more than the existence\
of a pre-historic Sawney Bean, no ancestor, necessarily, of Mr.\
Clat. At present cannibalism is unknown in the Land of Cakes.\
Horse has been eaten by some Frenchmen; but no Scotch Sabbatarian\

several laundry maids and washers, if tbey are, as the advertise-\

the humble Petitioner for the Lord Mayor's Day, which honourable\
Banquet sheweth, &c, &c, &e. Here, if you please, is the\'97\
! ORDER OF THE BANQUET.\
The Third Course.\'97Pumphandles rampant, with a Bar-sinister stewed.\
Gules in the corner crying.\
The First Course,\'97Mutton, by mistake. Dicing this the band, from\
the nearest footman's hat, will play a morsel.\
Second Dish\'97 Nothing, with a cover over it.\
Side Dishes to be eaten in silence undei the table. Lights out, and\
all hands tied. Speeches not admitted after seven. Ghosts in bonnets\
not allowed on the hearthrug. The Sauce piquante for this dish must\
be, boat and all, forced down the throat of the hireling Greengrocer.\
Fifth Dish.\'97Jack Puddings. JV.ections for eating: open your\
mouth, shut your eyes, and see what you'll get. Hands across, and\
return to your places.\
Entremets. \'97 Black beetles in chains. Hot spectacles fresh from\
Vesuvius. Custards [heard outside).\
To follow.\'97The Original Bones.\
Piece of Resistance.\'97Struggle with the butler who brings in the\
beef. Upset the gravy. Give no quarter! Down with him even to\
the dust (if any)! Coalscuttle him, and when firmly seated, recite to\
him in an undertone the homily on the repairing and keeping clean of\
churches. Let him move if he dare.\
The Vegetables will of course be under the able direction of Mb,\
Axtbjsd Mellon.\
Dessert.\'97Great attention has been paid to this department; so there\
will not be any.\
No expense has been spared to render this repast the most perfect\
of its kiud ever yet witnessed, out of metropolitan and the surround-\
ing districts \{hear, hear.'), and if the Statues of the Metropolis \{ironical\
cheers) will but smile upon our endeavours \{tumultuous applause, which\
was quelled by a gentleman insisting upon giving his name and\
address), then I may safely say (hisses and groans) that (what?) Box\
and Cox are satisfied. (Question! Uproar, during which the Rhino-\
ceros, having finished shaving, left the room.)\

The Rev. Nathaniel Pamby, a young Curate from the Country,\
has just dropped in to partake of " the cup that cheers."\
Mrs. Coddle (using a hand-screen). As you say, Ma. Pamby, this\
Bishop Colenso aifair is a very serious matter.\
The Rev. Pamby (staring at the fire vacantly). Yes. It's a\'97er\'97(sud-\
denly)\'97I haven't seen the papers for a day or two. I should like to\
hear the arguments on either side. (Ruminating on toast.) Most\
im-port-ant.\
Mrs. Coddle. Ah! it's so interesting. You ought to read it. And\'97\
(inspired)\'97oh! Me. Pamby, now you're here, I must ask you, what is\
the whole state of the case P\
Rev. Mr. Pamby (rather taken aback). The Coles so case?\
Mrs. Coddle. Yes. Of course I know he wrote books about the\'97\
the\'97(means "the Pentateuch," but isn't quite decided as to the pro-\
nunciation).\
Rev. Mr. Pamby (coming to the rescue, and asserting hi* superiority).\
The Pentateuch P\
Mrs. Coddle (much relieved\'97gratefully). Yes, that's it. (Doesn't\
trust herself with the word.)\
Rev. Mr. Pamby. Well\'97er\'97you see it's a long and somewhat intri-\
cate matter; one, perhaps, that would hardly\'97er\'97bear\'97(wanders, but\
refreshes his intellect with a sip of tea)\'97well, the point is this\
[Servant enters, and announces "Mrs. Muddle." After the usual\
greetings, and the necessary introduction, the conversation is thus\
continued\'97\
Mrs. Muddle. I am so tired! I've been in Court all day.\
Mrs. Coddle. In Court?\
Mrs. Muddle. Yes, hearing the case which of course interests you,\
Mr. (is going to say " Danby," but checks herself, and confesses her\
ignorance). I beg your pardon (turning to Mas. Coddle), I didn't quite\
catch the\
Rev. Mr. Pamby (humbly and meekly). Pamby.\
Seasonable Sentiment.\
Let Charity reign supreme from the twenty-fifth of December,\
and let all party-feeling be dropped, except a Christmas-party feeling,\
very jolly, good-natured, and happy.\
Mrs. Muddle. Mr. Pamby\'97(the Reverend gentleman bows smilingly) \'97\
of course it interests you P\
Mrs. Coddle. Mr. Pamby was just telling me, my dear, as you came\
in, the whole point of the case.\
Rev. Mr. Pamby (waiving his right to be heard). But you, Madam,\
have just come from it, and so of course are better able to\'97to\
Mrs. Muddle. I've followed it closely in what they call an official\
capacity.\
Mrs. Coddle. Official, my"dear\
Mrs. Muddle. Yes; I'm sure Mr.\'97Mr.\'97(gives it up, and substi-\
tutes a form)\'97this gentleman will keep my confidence. (The Reverend\
gentleman intimates by something between a smile and a snort, that he's\
ready for anything in the way of feminine confidences.) Well, 1 'm report-\
ing the case for the Ecclesiastical Englishwoman's Anglican Weekly\
Journal, and here \{producing pocket-book) are my notes.\
Mrs. Coddle. Oh, do let's hear them.\
Rev. Mr. Pamby. I should so like, if it would not be too much\
trouble\
Mrs. Muddle (making a show of reluctance). Ah, it will be boring you.\
Mrs. Coddle. Boring, my dear! I was only just saying, as you came\
in, that, &c, &c.\
Mrs, Pamby. Yes, we were only just saying, &o. (Joins in the duet,\
and corroborates Mrs. Coddle's statement).\
Mrs. Muddle. Well, then, the case is this. (Refers to her notes.)\
First, the Bishop oh no, I won't begin with that. No\'97you must\
know that the Archbishop of\'97or, rather, I should say, to make it\
clearer, for it is a little difficult to make you understand the whole case\
at once (her friends nod approvingly, and smile encouragingly)\'97yes\'97\
well, you see, the Bishop op Cape Town held a Synod with two others\
and one who hadn't anything to do with the place, and they deposed\
Dr. Gray\'97no, I mean Dr. Colenso, who's the Bishop of Natal; and\
then when a Suffering Bishop (Rev. Mr. Pamby thinks that she means\
"Suffragan"perhaps) is sent away, he has a right to appeal to the\
Crown in Council, at least the question is, whether there was a Patent\'97\
yes, a patent, you know, or president\'97(refers to her notes)\'97no (spelling\
the notes) a p-r-e\'97it's half rubbed out\'97no, precedent. And Sir\

ABE LINCOLN'S ENIGMA.\
The following passage from Mr. Lincoln's Message to Congress,\
may be puzzling, but is intelligible :\'97\
"While corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed, and fought*\
and dwindled, and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who com\
posed them are still living."\
How is it that certain corps and divisions and brigades and regi-\
ments, have, whilst a great majority of the men who composed them\
are still living, gone out of existence P That we can easily understand\
by considering them to have been Irish. The non-existence of the\
troops, and the existence of most of the men of whom they consisted,\
are not, of course, to be reconciled by the supposition that the Utter\
skedaddled.\

The new leaf which the heroes, who, as the\
agents of his Prussian Majesty, have wrested\
Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark, and\
plundered Jutland, will be generally considered\
to have added to the history of Prussia, is a\
leaf which we may take leave to call a cabbage-\
leaf. The history of Prussia is what a King\
who glories in robbery calls glorious, in as far\
as it consists of similar leaves. The medal\
which the King of Pbussia intends to be-\
stow on his merry men should be stamped\
with the device of a cabbage-leaf, and the\
special medal whereby he designs to reward\
those of them that were concerned in the blood-\
shed of Alsen and Diippel, should be emblazoned\
with a very crimson leaf of the red cabbage.\
