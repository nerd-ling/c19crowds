July 1, 1865.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. iii
R. E. F. A.
ºssº
THE GENERAL ELECTION.
HE Election of the MEMBER FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE has taken place, in anticipation of all other
returns. There was no opposition. The moment MR. PUNCH had signified his readiness to be again
elected, the proceedings became matter of form.
MR. PUNCH, attended by ToBY, ascended the hustings, and MRs. PUNCH and her lovely daughters
occupied places at an opposite window. The density of the crowd baffled all description. MR. PUNCII
smilingly addressed a few words to his intended proposer and seconder, inculcating upon them the desirability
of brevity, considering the state of the atmosphere.
MR. John BULL, on the part of the Men of the Empire, proposed MR. PUNCH as a fit and proper
person for Imperial Member. “I have known him,” said MR. BULL, “for twenty-four years, and it is saying
little to declare, that during that time I have never known him guilty of an unworthy word or deed. I
say that during that time he has been frantically zealous in his efforts for the general good, and
that it is to him we owe all the Reforms, Treaties, Triumphs, Exhibitions, Fine Weather, and Extra-
ordinary Gooseberries which have tended to raise England in the scale of nations, and promote those
principles which placed the House of Brunswick on the throne.” (Tremendous Cheers.)
MRs. BRITANNIA said that woman's rights having been recognised by MR. MILL, she had great pleasure
in coming forward on the part of the Women of the Empire (children included) and seconding the nomination.

A Woman's Man must be a good man, and MR. PUNCH was known par excellence—well, she would say cat
eacokeen—as the Friend of Woman. He had certainly told her of her slight faults, but it was only to set
in a brighter light her splendid merits, and it was to MR. PUNCH that the Women of the Empire resorted
for counsel, comfort, amusement, and instruction. MR. BULL had referred to MR. PUNCH's long services, but
she could only say that he looked younger than ever, and grew handsomer every day. She hoped that
MRs. PUNCH would not be jealous of her for admiring him, but she must say that she considered him as
an unlimited and unmitigated Duck.” (Terrific and renewed Cheers.)
No other Candidate being proposed, (“I should like to see one,” said the last speaker, grasping her
trident in a demonstrative fashion,) MR. PUNCH was declared duly Elected for the Empire.
When the shouting had subsided, not because the world wished to desist, but had shouted itself
into exhaustion,
THE IMPERIAL MEMBER advanced, and spoke as follows:—
“You have this day done a right and a wise thing. Do you suppose that I shall thank you, or
compliment you for what you have done 2 By Jove, I should say not. As my friend Roebuck said to
the mob at Sheffield, I know what I am about, and you mind your own business. You have elected the
only person in the world who is capable of doing the work he undertakes to do, and he means to do it.
What I have done for twenty-four years, in defiance of all menace, advice, bribe, suggestion, criticism, and
abuse, I intend to do for twenty-four years more; that is to say, I mean to keep England in the Right
Place. You can go. I have no intention of staying. But here is something to take home with you,
and in utter defiance of the Treating Act, I give you all this Treat.”
And as from the magic hat of FRIKELL or STODARE, there flew out innumerable copies of the
forty-fiftſ tºlumt.

POLITICAL
THE year 1865 opened with every assurance of “peace and
plenty.” The cotton famine, which had been attended
with so much misery during the two preceding years, had
now almost vanished, and the Lancashire districts showed in-
dications of returning prosperity. The unhappy contest in
America, and which had now lasted four years, appeared to
be drawing to a close, as the Southern States gave signs of
exhaustion.
LoRD PALMERSTON still held his place in the confidence of
the people, find he was destined to outlive but a short time
the Parliament about to expire of natural decay.
The QUEEN, to the regret of all her subjects, still conceived
it to be her duty to pay homage to the dead, and to decline to
open Parliament in person. That ceremony, therefore, was
performed by Commission.
HER MAJESTY's Message was delivered from the throne by
the LORD CHANCELLOR, and the following extracts will at
once explain the position of Great Britain at home and
abroad :—
“We are commanded to assure you that HER MAJEsty has great satisfac-
tion in recurring again to the advice and assistance of her Parliament.
“The negotiations in which the EMPERoR of Austria and the KING OF
PRussia were engaged with the KING of DENMARK were brought to a conclu-
sion by a Treaty of Peace; and the communications which HER MAJESTY
receives from foreign Powers lead her to entertain a well-founded hope that
no renewed disturbance of the peace of Europe is to be apprehended.
“The civil war in North America still unhappily continues. HER
MAJESTY remains steadfastly neutral between the contending parties, and
would rejoice at a friendly reconciliation between them.
“A Japanese Daimio in rebellion against his sovereign, infringed the
rights accorded by treaty to Great Britain and to certain other powers; and
the Japanese Government having failed to compel him to desist from his
lawless proceedings, the diplomatic agents and the naval commanders of
Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States of North
SUMMARY.
America, undertook a combined operation for the purpose of asserting
the rights which their respective Governments have obtained by treaty.
That operation has been attended with complete success; and the result has
afforded security for foreign commerce and additional strength to the
Government of Japan, with which the relations of HER MAJESTY are friendly.
“Papers on this subject will be laid before you.
“HER MAJEsty regrets that the conflict with some of the native tribes in
New Zealand has not yet been brought to a close, but the successful
efforts of HER MAJEsty's regular forces, supported by those raised in the
colony, have led to the submission of the insurgents; and those who are
still in arms have been informed of the equitable conditions on which their
submission would be accepted.
“HER MAJEsty has had great satisfaction in giving her sanction to the
meeting of a conference of delegates from her several North American pro-
vinces, who, on invitation from HER MAJESTY's Governor-General, assembled
at Quebec. Those delegates adopted resolutions having for their object a
closer union of those provinces under a central Government. If those
resolutions shall be approved by the provincial legislatures, a Bill will be
laid before you for carrying this important measure into effect.
“HER MAJESTY rejoices at the general tranquillity of her Indian domi-
nions, but HER MAJESTY regrets that long-continued outrages on the persons
and property of subjects of HER MAJESTY, and for which no redress could be
had, have rendered it necessary to employ a force to obtain satisfaction for
the past and security for the future.
“HER MAJEsty deeply laments the calamity which has recently occa-
sioned great loss of life and property at Calcutta and at other places in India.
Prompt assistance was rendered by the officers of the Government, and
generous contributions have been made in various 'parts of India to relieve
the sufferings which have thus been occasioned.”
HER MAJESTY then referred to the satisfactory condition of
the revenue, the bountiful harvest which had been gathered
throughout the country, and to other subjects which will be
brought under notice in the Essence of Parliament. As that
series of papers is so completely exhaustive of all that is
worth preserving in the debates of the collective wisdom of
the country, we shall direct our attention to those other
matters which have been thought worthy of the attention
of Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch had occasion to notice the Pope's Encyclical
page

Wol. XLVIII.]
[JANUARY to JUNE, 1865.
INTRODUCTION.
PAGE
Letter, and more especially its effect in France, and the large
cut, page 17, indicates how the matter was treated by
the French Emperor. Mr. Punch has also referred to a
contretemps of PRINCE NAPOLEoN during the EMPEROR's
visit to Algeria, in consequence of slight insurrection in that
colony. The matter occasioned much talk at the time. The
tone and sentiments of PLON-PLON's speech gave great offence
to the French Government, and the EMPERoR was determined
not to be compromised by the indiscretion of his relative. He
therefore addressed to him the following letter:—
“Sir and very dear Cousin, I cannot refrain from expressing to you the
painful impression which the perusal of your speech at Ajaccio has made
upon me.
“In leaving you during my absence near the EMPREss and my son, as
Vice-President of the Privy Council, I meant to give you a proof of my
friendship and my confidence, and I hoped that your presence, your conduct,
and your speeches would prove that union reigns in our family.
“The political programme which you place under the aegis of the Em-
peror can only serve the enemies of my Government. To judgments which
I cannot accept, you add sentiments of hate and rancour which are no longer
of our time.
“To know how to apply to present times the ideas of the Emperor, it is ne-
cessary to have passed through the hard ordeal of responsibility and authority;
and, moreover, can we really, pigmies as we are, estimate at its proper value
the great historical figure of NAPoleoN ? As in presence of a colossal statue,
we are powerless to take in the whole at once. We never see but that part
which is turned to us; hence the incompleteness of the reproduction and
the divergences of opinions.
“But what is clear to the eyes of every one is, that, in order to prevent
the anarchy of minds, the formidable enemy of true liberty, the Emperor
had established, first in his family, and then in his Government, a severe
discipline, which admitted but of one will and one action. I cannot depart
henceforth from the same line of conduct.
“On this, Sir, and dear Cousin, I pray God to have you in His holy
keeping.
- ** NAPOLEoN.”
The Prince in consequence resigned his office of Vice-
President of the Privy Council, and the affair was soon for-
gotten.
In the course of the autumn the English Channel fleet
visited Brest, and their arrival was greeted by the French
authorities with the most marked cordiality and kindness.
Soon afterwards a portion of the French fleet returned the
compliment by a visit to Portsmouth, where the inhabitants
endeavoured to rival the reception given to our officers and
men in France, by the warmth of their hospitality and the
splendour of their festivities. In acknowledgment of this
friendly feeling there appeared, on the 6th of September, in
the Moniteur, the following bulletin:—“It affords us great
satisfaction to call to mind with what courtesy the Govern-
ment, the people, and the Press of England have greeted the
French fleet in England. The entente cordiale which pre-
vailed during the preceding reign has been rendered fruitful
through the policy of the Empire. The friendly relations
existing between France and England are founded upon their
mutual interests and upon the uniformity of their principles
in matters of public law. They rivalled one another in dis-
interestedness to ensure the independence of the Ottoman
Empire, and when France had fought for Italy, England on
her part determined no longer to retain the Ionian Islands,
and consented that they should be restored to the origin of
their nationality.” -
The General Election of the new Parliament was, perhaps,
as unexciting as any within the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant, and within a week most of the borough contests in
England and Wales had been decided. In the City of
London the four Liberal candidates outnumbered by majori-
ties of two thousand their two Conservative opponents, and
in Westminster, after a struggle of some interest, J. STUART
MILL, the eminent philosophical writer, defeated LoBD GROS-
VENOR by a large majority. -
At Oxford the contest was severe. The candidates were
MR. GLADSTone and MR. GATIIoRNE HARDY. According to
an Act framed in the last session electors could vote by papers
transmitted through the post, and a period of five days was
allowed for polling. A most active canvas throughout the
country took place, and it was generally expected that the
paper-voting system would be adverse to the interests of the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExcBEQUER, and so it proved, as MR.
HARDY beat MR. GLADSTONE by 1904 votes to 1724.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER addressed the fol-
lowing farewell address to the Members of Convocation:—
“Gentlemen, After an arduous connection of eighteen years, I bid you
respectfully farewell. My earnest purpose to serve you, my many faults
and shortcomings, the incidents of the political relation between the
University and myself, established in 1847, so often questioned in vain, and
now at length finally dissolved, I leave to the judgment of the future. It is one
imperative duty, and one alone, which induces me to trouble you with these
few parting words: the duty of expressing my profound and lasting grati-
tude for indulgence as generous, and for support as warm and enthusiastic
in itself, and as honourable from the character and distinctions of those who
have given it, as has, in my belief, ever been accorded by any constituency
to any representative.
“I have the honour to be, gentlemen,
“Your obliged and obedient Servant,
“W. E. GLADSTONE.”
“Hawarden, Chester, July 18, 1865.”
Thus rejected, as SIR RoBERT PEEL had been before him,
by the University of Oxford, MR. GLADSTONE at once resolved
to appeal to another and very different constituency to return
him to Parliament. The representation of South Lancashire
was still open, and preparations for a keen struggle between
the Liberal and Conservative parties had been for some time
made. The nomination for that division had taken place on
the 17th, and the name of the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchE-
QUER had been then proposed, the actual result at Oxford not
being then known.
After a sharp contest, MR. GLADSTONE having made some
eloquent and telling speeches, the CHANCELLOR stood third
upon the poll, to the great delight of the Liberals who rejoiced
at his emancipation from the trammels of the University.
The general result of the election was favourable to the Liberal
cause ; but LoBD PALMERStoN, whose health had been evi-
dently failing for some months, ended his long public career
in the month of October. This sad event was regarded as a
heavy blow to the Cabinet, over which he had presided with
such consummate skill for the last six years.

[JANUARY TO JUNE, 1865.
INTRODUCTION.
NOTES.
PAGE
1 Punch's Encyclical Letter.—The Pope had just issued
an address to the priesthood. The WENERABLE P. GREEN is
the respected proprietor of Evans's Supper Rooms, which, much
to MR. GREEN’s credit, may be visited by old and young
gentlemen.
3 Praise for a Manager.—A certain Actress had appeared
at Astley's Theatre in Mazeppa, and played a portion of the
part in a most indelicate dress.
The Imperial Bullfighter.—The Pope's Encyclical Letter
of last year having asserted the antiquated claims of the Holy
See to decide on everything er cathedrá, the Minister of
Justice in France therefore declared that certain expressions
contained in the letter were contrary to the laws of the Empire
as well as to the liberties of the Gallican Church. The priest-
hood, of course, resisted the mandate, but ineffectually.
The Schoolmaster at Home.—See Essence of Parlia-
ment.
Mr. Punch's Handy-Book of the Stage.—The initial
letter is a portrait of the one-legged dancer named DoNATO.
He proved sufficiently attractive to save the English Opera
Company (Limited) from dissolution in 1865. DoNATO died at
the close of the year.
The Great Mistletoe Question.—Several letters ap-
peared in the Times on localities favourable to the growth of
mistletoe.
New Book.-The author of the Apologia was Doctor
(now CARDINAL) MANNING.
The Brompton Area-Sneak refers to the proselytism
of a young man by one of the fathers of the Oratory.
A Limb of the Law.—An action was brought for breach
of engagement against DoNATO, the one-legged dancer. See
Note to page 3.
Literary Paradox. —The last chapters of Quite Alone
were written by another hand during MR. SALA’s unavoidable
absence from England, and without his consent.
Beef at 3d. per lb.-An attempt was made to introduce
an article of consumption called Jerked (or charqued) Beef from
South America. Public prejudice, however, rejected a whole-
some and cheap addition to the poor man's larder.
Back to School.— MR. GLADSTONE was solicited to give
a portion of his anticipated surplus to the reduction of the
Malt-Tax, Fire Assurance, &c., by the representatives of
various interests.
“As the old Cock crows, the young Cock learns.”—
LoRD AMBERLEY, the son of EARL RUSSELL, had come out at
Leeds as a candidate for a seat in Parliament. He made a
crude, democratic speech, and was well snubbed for his indis-
cretion.
A Clerical Error.—DR. TAIT, Bishop of London.
The Political Career of the Right Honourable B.
Disraeli.-See Note to p. 25, Wol. XLVII.
The Davenports Undone.--For an account of these im-
postors see Note to p. 189, Wol. XLVII.
The Agricultural Jeremy Diddler.—See Essence of
Parliament.
Delightful Ignorance.—Lumps of Delight-an eastern
condiment, made of prepared gum and sugar.

A Trifle from Sutherlandshire.—The DUKE of SUTHER-
LAND is well known as an amateur firemen.
Elegy on the Porpoise.—A porpoise at the Zoological
Gardens had been a great attraction.
Porculus Marinus Loquitur.—See Note to p. 84.
The Faith as it is in Westbury.—See the Chancellor's
Judgment in the case of Essays and Reviews, 1864.
Nullus aut Caesar.—Refers to the Life of Caesar, by
Louis NAPOLEoN, and wherein the Imperial author strives to
blow his great Uncle into undue proportions.
The Duke's Motto.—See preceding Note, p. 83.
The Tormented Minister refers to the opening of the
Indian Telegraph.
Amended Maxim for the Iron Districts.—The men
were “out on strike.”
Vulcan in the Sulks.-See preceding note.
Big and Little Bethells.—The Big and Little Bethell
scandals subsequently led to LoRD WESTBURY's resignation of
the Great Seal.
Arbitration better than Emigration.—The strike in the
north.
“Strengthening the Bill.”—Belphegor the Mounte-
bank, had been produced at the Lyceum, MR. FECHTER, the
manager, announcing that to strengthen the cast, his own
son would appear. The analogy between that circumstance
and LoRD AMBERLEY's appearance at Leeds is shown in the
cut. -
Song to be Sung on entering a Cheap Dining-
room.—Cheap dining-rooms have been long named “Slap
Bangs,” from the manner in which the carvers at those places
dash the viands on the plates. A vulgar fellow was singing a
song with the burden quoted, and the trash became popular.
Bismarck on the Prussian Navy.—Prussia had taken
possession of Kiel—a port.
“Out of the Parish.”—See Essence of Parliament.
Dizzy's K’rect Card for the “Derby” (?)—MR. Dis-
RAELI had been taking the Church of England under his
patronage. See Essence of Parliament.
Whist in St. James's.—See opposite page, “Charity at
Clubs.”
“Strict Discipline.”—The EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH,
during a visit to Algeria, had appointed the EMPRESS Regent,
and the PRINCE NAPOLEON Vice-President of the Privy Council.
PLON-PLON made a most injudicious speech at Ajaccio, on the
occasion of the inauguration of a monument erected to NAPO-
LEoN I., and received a sharp letter of remonstrance from his
cousin Louis in consequence. See Introduction.
“Le Chant de Triomphe.”—The winner of the Derby
of 1865, was Gladiateur, a French horse.
“Feeling their Feet.”—MR. GLADSTONE had recently

You can hire a cab by the mile or the hour: it is
generally done, however, by holding up the hand, the
stick, the umbrella, and by shouting out “Hi!" If hired
by the stick, it is 6d. a mile; and if by the expression of
your “Hi,” the fare is equally low.
If you are unable to defray the expense of your drive, tell
the Driver to take you up to the Piccadilly end of the Bur-
lington Arcade. Then §. out, tell him to wait, enter the
Arcade, and having walked quickly through, exit at the
other end. He cant be in two places at once, and thus all

Babies and children under five, are charged by weight:
and when the wait is over a quarter of an hour, it is more
than sixpence. The precise value of three children is
therefore easily calculated.
Two children under ten are equal to an adult person.
Parents travelling in cabs are required by law to carry with
them the baptismal certificates of their children, which
they are bound to produce every five minutes, if requested
so to do by the Cabman.
The Cabman has no right to turn round on his seat and
make faces at his fare through the window. This is spe-
cially provided against, by a bye-law.
Every Driver is bound to give the hirer a ticket of some

Query.—Does it follow that
Woman is superior to Man, con-
sidered as a purely reflective
being?
Note.-In the race of life, a
gallant Sportsman has observed
Woman the favourite carries oft
all the cups and plates.
Query.—is there anything re-
markable in this fact, looking at
the subject from all points of
view, and taking into considera-
tion her naturally winning ways?
Note.—Philosophers, perplexed
to give a satisfactory definition
of Woman, have petulantly pro-
nounced her a puzzle.
Query. — Will this ingenious
suggestion account for her feel-
ing so much pleasure in taking a
rival to pieces?

PUNCH*S ENCYCLICAL LETTER.
DEAR Boys, Dear Boys, if you will allow us to quote the words of the
Wenerable P. GREEN (No. 1865 in the Books), we shall have great
leasure in reiterating the sounds of Hospitality, Dear Boys, Dear Boys,
ow are all round the fireside? as often as it is agreeable to your noble
selves. Not, however, to weary you with jº repetitions, after
the cheery fashion of the revered Paul pe BEDFORD, whose work
addressed to so many “Corinthians,” we have recently perused, we wil
content ourselves with admonishing you that “we are here again!”
(vide Clown's Address, Sc.1, of Pantom.Com. Bus.), and we, hereby, do
heartily wish you all a right Merry Christmas, and the Happiest of
Happy New Years,
It is our duty, Dear Boys, Dear Boys, to guard you against error:
to warn you that there are, alas! certain men, of unsound and per-
nicious opinions, going about, who do not shrink from asserting that
“the Current Number of this Periodical can be obtained, without
payment, by removing it from the counter of the Publishing office,
when the person in attendance is not looking.”. This proposition we
justly condemn. “ Munquam Dormio,” (Bell's Life, Page 1, any
Number) which, being interpreted by the illustration accompanying the
motto, (vide “Life of Bell” as above) means that such a proposition
is, in the vulgar, all our eye.
There are some among you who do not blush to promulgate the
doctrine of Bantingism, namely, “that at this time of the year we
should partake of no plum pudding, nor of mince pies, nor of nice fresh
butter from the country, nor of, in short, any fattening Christmas fare
whatever;” all such propositions we do, with mince-pious horror, most
thoroughly condemn.
. The modern heresy of asking a guest to dine at the hour of half-past
six, when the moment intended is seven, is ultimately, directly and in-
directly, productive of unpunctuality, spoilt appetites, overdone dinners,
and dyspepsia. This proposition is, by us, also condemned.
But what shall we say of those who, forgetful of the many benefits
they have received at our hands, perversely threaten to, as they coarsely
put it, “ tickle our Tobyl" To these misguided men we say no more
than, Cave Canem. -
All propositions made by extortionate cabmen to “leave the fare to
us,” or “to make it another sixpence,” we unhesitatingly condemn.
(Wide Decisions, Bow Street.)
All propositions to go out shopping with a wife, or any pretty female
relatives, we condemn. From these we turn with delight to
The propositions of Punch's Forty-Seventh Book, which, singly and
collectively, meet with our sincere approval.
The proposition that we should continue this letter to any length,
instead of spending the pleasantest evening possible, at the pleasantest
party possible, is decisively condemned, Dear Boys, Dear Boys, by your
ever attached well-wisher, 49&HNC#.
Given at our Office at the commencement of our Forty-Eighth Volume,
and the Twenty-Fourth year of our existence.
THE POPE'S BULL IN THE PANTOMIME.
(Clown sings.)
PLEASE, Sir—I mean your Holiness—peccari / I had rather
Be rude to a Policeman than offend the Holy Father.
Upon my word of honour—if you’ll credit my assertion— .
Through reading Doctor NEwMAN I was very near conversion.
I was prepared to swallow, with unquestioning docility,
The biggest things delivered by supreme Infallibility; . .
To stretch my mouth from ear to ear I shouldn't have objected,
Would willingly have opened it to any width directed.
But really that Encyclical, so contrary to reason,
Your Holiness has published just at this especial season,
Insisting on the #. divine of priestly domination
O'er civil power, the family, and public education;
Against despotic government denouncing insurrection,
Denying people's right to choose their rulers by election, ..
Proclaiming the State bound to back the Church in persecution,
Condemning free press, conscience free, and liberal constitution,
It is—excuse, your Holiness, my freedom of expression;
Pardon a homely metaphor derived from my profession:.
It is—with all due deference I speak, with deep submission-
It is a string of sausages too large for deglutition.

ODE ON THE BURIAL OF THE SPOON-BONNET.
“Bonnets are no longer worn bigh in the front.”—Fashions for December.
* URy the Spoonbonnet,
Mid the Graces' exultation:
Let us bury the Spoon-bonnet,
To the sound of rejoicing from the Taste of the Nation.
Mourning your own Creation's fall
Modistes and Milliners bear up the pall,
But bread-winners with short purses look joyous one and all!
Where shall we bury the Spoon that is no more?
Here, in the midst of the ugliest modes of yore;
*Mongst the old shapes that were queerest,
And to Coal-skuttles came nearest,
Place the palm upon the tomb of the Spoon whose reign is o'er.
Mourn, for to us it seems the Last,
Remembering its dimensions in the past;
No more our fair ones' faces shall we greet
'Neath high-pleached bowers of foliage, in the street.
Mourn for the Spoon—to growling husbands dear,
That dipped e'en into . eep and wide,
Dearer to Milliners, who nought abide
That’s neat and nice, and costs not much to wear!
Mourn for the Spoon, that belles and frights brought down
Unto the common ievel of The GUY,
| Ye whose plain looks on pretty fashions frown,
Lest on your ugliness they shame should cry.
Mourn, short-faced dumps, to be drawn out that sighed,
And of high-fronted bonnets craved the boon:
Mourn, long-faced frumps, that, well nigh desperate, tried
To drown the long face in a longer Spoon.
Mourn for that porch of amplest preadth of sweep
Ye that had acres wide of cheek to show;
Great in compass, and great in cost,
And leaving room upon your heads to heap
Piles of rich fruit, and flowers in fullest blow
| In wild confusion tost.
Spoons are over and done,
Can't say, Thanks to the giver
Of this fashion, for one!
let its knell be tolled,
With a shake and a shiver;
Lay the Spoon in the mould,
Orlet its shape be rolled
Deep in the mud of the river,
So 'tis but put down for ever
With bygone horrors of old,
Among the graves that hold
Fashion’s monstrosities manifold !
The lofty tete, laid low by Time's sharp scythe, behold!
Its powder dust, its curling irons cold;
There sleep short-waists, wasted to shorter still,
And pokes, wherein Regency belles could kill:
There the scantJ. like wax that clung
About our grandmothers, when they were young,
Lies, waiting for the time when Crinoline,
The opposing dynasty's now †. queen,
C,
Laid in a triple grave hard by s
If she, indeed, can keep
... Her everlasting sleep
Within the space appropriate to three,
And shrouds are not forbid becoming breadth of seams.
Thus rival queens of Mode, discrowned,
Sleep, side by side, in Folly's common ground,
urning to scorn the madness of extremes.
Lay the Spoon-bonnet low! -
And be its silk watered with tearful brine,
And bid it happy-speed
To that Elysian mead
Where the departed Fashions shine
With a faint after-glow.
And let the grave be deep,
That not a pompon peep
Even of that high-reaching front, to say
Where it is put away—
Whate'er the Bonnet of the Future be,
If Spoon at all, a tea-spoon may we see,
And not a table-spoon or gravy large,
Like this, whose ample marge
Is cut by Fate's stern shears, and Fashion's doom to-day!

CONDEMNED TO GO TO CHURCH.
THERE are not a few persons who disbelieve in Christianity, and vote
Divine Service a bore...To such the late judgment of the Privy Council
has been considered likely to be gratifying. It cannot, however, have
given them half the pleasure which they will experience on perusing the
subjoined extract from the decision of the Admiralty on the case of the
Rev. MR. GUTTEREs, Chaplain of the Resistance, who had refused to
obey an order from CAPTAIN CHAMBERLAIN to report on the attendance
of a midshipman at afternoon as well as morning service on board that
vessel, which that gallant officer had, imposed on the lad as a punish-
ment for going to sleep at service in the morning. The Chaplain, in a
remonstrance which he had submitted to the Admiralty, had pleaded
that “it was impossible for him, as a clergyman, to act as a spy on his
congregation, or to report who were or, who were not present, for
ºnent." My Lords, however, order the reverend gentleman
to
“Publicly and severely reprimanded for declining to undertake the direction
and supervision of the punitive attendance of a midshipman for three months at
Divine Service.”
Atheists and heathen will note with satisfaction that my Lords do
not content themselves with censuring the clergyman for refusing to
ish a report demanded by his superior officer. They, carefully
specify his disobedience, and are particular in remarking that the matter
to which it related was the “punitive attendance” of a midshipman “at
Divine Service.” Thus they expressly confirm, as far as their authority
goes, the idea of the8. nature of religious worship evidently enter-
tained by CAPTAIN CHAMBERLAIN. After this declaration of opinion,
we may expect to see attendance at Divine Service occasionally substi-
tuted for ascent to the mast-head, and ultimately, perhaps, prayers
ordered instead of a round dozen in the Navy. An Act, too, will per-
haps be passed, pursuant whereto the civil magistrate will sometimes
give offenders three months' church, like CAPTAIN CHAMBERLAIN.
However, their Lordships, to save appearances, which are against their
faith, intimate, in a private and .#. memorandum, that hence-
forth :—
“No duty of an executive character must be expected from chaplains; and that
misbehaviour at church must not be punished by compulsory additional attendance
at Divine Service."
My Lords do not go so far as to say that they think it otherwise
than unadvisable that youngsters in the Navy should be disgusted with
devotion, by having it enforced upon them as a “punitive” imposition.
But they distinctly endorse CAPTAIN CHAMBERLAIN's view of attendance
at Divine Service, which seems to be that it is in itself a sort of suffer-
ing like that of hard labour, and that misconduct in its endurance
resembles a breach of prison discipline.
The intimate, connexion subsisting between the Admiralty and the
Ecclesiastical Court has something perhaps to do with those notions of
my, Lords on the subject of religion, whereof the disclosure will so
highly delight freethinkers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 7, 1865.
MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.
CHAP. V.—OF “LINES OF BUSINESS,” AND THE RULES
BELONGING TO THEM.
INEs of business are ex-
tremely useful things.
They enable the
actor to limit his
study of life and his
observation of man-
ners to one class,
age, and style of cha-
racter. Without them
he would be com-
pelled to be noting
all sorts of humours,
all phases of life, all
the various workings
of human nature and
society as they came
before him. need
hardly point out
what a , , lifelong
drudgery this would
involve, and how it
would reduce the art
of acting to a con-
stant and servile
waiting at the heels
of Nature, and a
wearisome , gazing
into the glass of
fashion.
“Lines of character,” again, enable an actor to make his engage-
ments with a knowledge of what will be expected of him, and, what is
still more valuable, afford the necessary openings for retreat
unreasonableness of managers, and the pretensions of authors. If the
actor is dissatisfied with his part, he has only to say, “I engaged for
such a line of business; this part is not in that line,” to raise a cloud of
questions under which it is very hard if he cannot defy both managerial
exactions and get over any legal difficulties which may be raised
ainst his just demands, should loss of situation ensue from his refusal
of the part, on the specious pretext of what is due to the manager, and
in entire disregard of what is due to himself.
“Lines of business” are the strongholds of those venerable tra-
ditions of the theatre which are to the art of the stage what the
Roman Catholic traditions are to the dogma of the Church. They are
the barriers against the sº waves of naturalism
and realism. º their help the theatre is enabled to keep up those
peculiar modes of dress, walk, voice, and manners, which assert so
strongly the marked line of demarcation between stage art and nature.
If we surrender these “lines”—the Torres Vedras of the stage—we
shall soon lose the generous uncle who, in the last act, brings, his
unfailing ready money to the rescue of his generous but improvident
nephew. The touching “Bless you, my children,” will cease to mark
the irresistible gush of parental forgiveness. The country-boy will no
longer ring his simple changes on his affection, for “feyther,”, and his
manly resistance to the Pººl. designs of “t’squoire.”... We shall
lose the rapid rattle of the light comedian, so exhilarating in the
theatre, so utterly wanting in real life. The harmonious “y” will be
struck out of “ch-y-ild” and “k-y-ind.” The three strides and a halt of
the heavy man and the tragedian will be turned into the commonplace
walk of every-day existence. Old men will cease to wear their broad-
brimmed hats and impossible gaiters, so dear to the successive genera-
tions of Flº. just as they have already, alas, abandoned the
dress of the historic days of the second and third GEORGEs. The
rimace of MUNDEN, the unctuous breadth of LISTQN, the vivacities of
THEws, or—to come nearer home-the broad grin and rolling
chuckle of BUckstone, the blending of tragic fire and grotesque fun
in Robson, will disappear in their imitators, who now keep alight the
vestal fire of comic business by dint of following the men who have
trod the same “lines” before them. -
The loss will be just as great in serious acting. To “lines of busi-
ness” we owe it, that the schools of KEMBLE and KEAN, of YoUNG
and MACREADY, still survive among us in the reverent reproductions
of their followers: and all this while, by rigid adhesion to these “lines,”
the special ground of “art” is defended against those who insist that
the actor, as such, should be able to play every part from which
physical peculiarities have not absolutely debarred him, and that just
in proportion as he can pass from grave to gay, from lively to severe,
he is a good actor, and in proportion as he limits himself to one or
the other, an º: one. Those who argue thus forget or ignore
how absolutely this breadth of range would place the player at the
from the li
command of manager and author, and leave him weaponless against
their unreasonable demands and heartless indifference to artistic sus-
ceptibilities.
here is a class—most authors may be included in it—who are
always attempting to merge all “lines of business” in what they call
“character.”
Do not listen to them. Remember that there is already a “line of
business” called “character parts.” This clearly proves that all parts
not included under this head are not “character-parts," but must be
acted with strict reference to the rules and records of the “line of
business” to which they belong.
Carefully maintaining, therefore, the established “lines of business,”
let us see what are the º rules to be attended to.
First comes “the lead,” as it is called in the theatre, which may be
generally said to include, the best of everything, and to carry with it
what is even more valuable—an almost indefinite power of rejecting
any part you do not like, or choose not “to see your way in.”
THE LEADING MAN.
Your fº guiding principle in this line of business must be to bear
constantly in mind that you are the º of the theatrical §: the
“principal light,” as painters, say, of the picture; the “dominant,” or
*; note—to use the º of music—of the composition.
ou will therefore insist beforehand that º else in the way
of character or effect, in any piece you act in, shall be kept carefully
down to the degree necessary to throw yourself and your part into the
highest relief possible. -
n acting keep yourself well before the public, taking the stage on
every opportunity, and thrusting your subordinates into the background.
Always play slow and emphatically. In your parts nothing can be
subordinate.
Let your gestures be well marked, and as a rule let your arms play as
much as your voice, and more than your face.
A fixed expression is a fine thing. The play of physiognomy is often
missed in the theatre, and the wear and tear of the features thus, caused
is very serious. Besides, the public is slow of appreciation, and if you
ºur expression with your emotion they will not be able to
olioW lt.
One sometimes sees actors trusting to infinitely delicate shades of
expression, and minute and carefully economised action, as if the move-
ment of a finger could ever tell like that of an arm, or that of an arm
like a convulsion of the whole body!
. This is one of the defects of French art. RACHEL was a notable
instance of this poverty and meanness of resources. In one famous
scene of “Les Horaces” she used to evade the difficulties of filling
up with appropriate emotion and action the time occupied in a confi-
dant's long description of the battle in which her lover was killed, by
falling into a faint. Even in the passionate part of Phèdre she hardl
raised her arm throughout. How different from the energetic self-
abandonment, the hysterical and vehement outward emotion which an
#. actress would find prescribed for her by the wholesome
tradition of our stage. -
As a rule, be loud. Whispering is all very well, if you have a hoarse
voice as EDMUND KEAN had, and can make your whisper tell. But even
then you should use your loud and sotto poce effects only as a foil to
each other, and a means of giving light and shade. But whether loud
or low, anything is better than level speaking.
Nothing can be finer (if your voice, be good through its whole
register) than the judicious employment of your whole vocal gamut
throughout your part, distributing your bass, tenor, and alto according
to musical considerations. If the sense interfere with these, sacrifice
it boldly in the cause of †. art.
Carefully note the applause of your public...When you find you have
made a point stick to it, and if possible strengthen it from night to night.
Practise yourself in forcing the applause. An accomplished actor
ought to be as able to raise a round from the house as a juggler to
extract the card he wants from the pack. I have already given some
rules for securing this cheering tribute.
If you have a decided bent or a particular secret of effect, insist on
the author's invariably consulting it. If he does not give you an oppor-
tunity to indulge the one and introduce the other, make one.
Cultivate critics; look after your own advertising, and stipulate,
whenever possible, for separate posters. This is a mark of respect as
much due to you as a separate bed to the usher in a school dormitory.
Take care that your demeanour on the stage shall indicate your
position in the theatre; so that the public shall be under no possibility
of mistake about your being the leading man, if by any accident your
acting should not bring the fact home to them.
The principle of nature is “breadth.” The principle of theatrical
art should therefore be “contrast.”
Remember HAzlıTT's fine metaphor applied to KEAN's acting, that
it was like reading SHAKSPERE by flashes of lightning. Go in, there-
fore, for “points.” These should be the luminous flashes of your
performance. Level impersonation is like reading SHAKsrºRE, by a
farthing candle. The same amount of illuminating power, distributed

in flashes, will go ten times as far, for people will forget the dark parts,
to dwell only on those you let them see under a high and sudden light.
As a general rule an actor who plays “the lead” ought to aim at
becoming a manager. Only in this way can he hope to be able to do
full justice to himself, and to mark, in every way—in the bills as well
as on the boards—the infinite distance between himself and the rest of
his company.... -
In this position I need hardly say that an ell for yourself and an inch
for everybody else should be your motto... You will thus be able to
introduce great economies in the payment of your actors, and have
more left for the scenery, costume, and accessories necessary to frame
and set off your own performance. . - - -
Remember that a number one, with a sufficient tail of ciphers, makes
a million.
DO YOU BURN YOUR LETTERS YET P
MR. EPICURUs Rotundus IMPROVES NEW YEAR’s EVE.
Do I burn my letters yet? Not half as often as I ought to do. But
here is New Year's Eve, and MRs. EPICURUs and the family have
departed to behold Cinderella, and I am not to fetch, them home, and
here is a good cigar, and there is a good fire. Let me, in all tranquillity,
overhaul the contents of my letter drawer. I paid my fire-assurance on
Wednesday, so if any accident happens, I shall get a new carpet and
table. Who comes first? BILLY Bów KER—has an urgent need for £15.
Never knew. BILLY without the need—I know I didn't send it—in he
flºes. Mrs. MACJERICHo–could I get her a private box for FECHTER }
That woman has £3000 a year, and doesn’t give champagne-forget
how I evaded, but am sure she didn't see. FECHTER gratis, rid hers
truly, E. R. The next. HENRY WUBBER. Who in the name of Acheron
is he?—wants my honoured autograph, as that of one whom he has
studied and loved from his youth up; and spells my name wrong. Don't
think I sent it, yet his name was a tempting rhyme to blubber. What
a pretty hand—have I been discreet in leaving this note in an open
drawer'?—yes, quite. A young lady wishes for my photograph and
some original verses, and doesn't even trust me with her initials...I am
to write to BLUE-BELLE, Post-office, Shrewsbury. Kentrebleu / MADE-
Moiselle BLUE-BELLE, were we not worthy of a lady's confidence?
FRANK CLotton—sends me a brace of pheasants. I remember, they
were bad, and MRs. EPICURUs had to pay three-and-ninepence car-
riage, and nobody had any change, and it was ten at night and rainy,
altogether disagreeable, FRANK should frank his game, and send it
sweet, besides—well reminded—he has got my Macaulay, and dare say
thinks I mean to let him keep it. I abuse and disabuse CLOTEN (as we
call him) per first post. MR.PoppireR YAwNEy—has the pleasureto send
pamphlet on the True Equivalent of Fictitious Currency, and hopes
that in any or all of the numerous publications with which I have
influence—wants to be puffed against the next election-saw his
pamphlet—in the waste basket first. There's a blaze, wo—ho! MRs.
Montgomery TADD-eh, by Jove! MRs. TARDI’ve acted, bad and
likewise rude the which is sad. Never opened that woman’s packet
of manuscript novels, which she asked me to read, reyise, and get
published, and what makes it all the wºrse, I never heard of her before
in all my life. Wonder where it is, Whose fault shall I say it was
Eight months. Think I'll º about it—perhaps she's dead.
Another lady. Wife, of the Reverend TIMOTHY TODE, asks for sub-
scription towards building her adored husband, a new house amid a
flock where his labours are so blessed—writes without his knowledge—
highly improper in a wife—am I sure I felt so at the time and did
not help TIMOTHY?, MR. CRAMPER, bootmaker, thinks. I must have
forgotten that his bill for the Alpine boots has been sent in, and havin
a large account to make up on Tuesday—why is it always Tuesday
But I paid him, and hope I have not lost the receipt, for the boots were
not worth paying for once, let alone twice. See to this. . P.
Who's that ? Nine sides. Ah, I ought to have burned this. HARRY
PEPPERPOT, with a statement why he cannot, in justice to himself and
his comforts, live with his wife any longer, and why I ought to go and
explain that little circumstance to her. Since that he has made it up
with MRs. PEPPERPot and quarrelled with me. Good mind to
re-inclose him the letter—but into the fire with it. MRs. CLARRUP
JIGGLEs—asks me to recommend a good school for her boy, where his
beautiful genius will not be snubbed—she is sure he is a genius, for he

last report of the Earlswood *..." to have. Here's a scrawl.
Will I second Young BLATANT McBoFUM at the Hº: Club P
How did I get out of that? How the deuce did I get out of that ?
What a rich mind I must have, to have been able to imagine circum-
stances that prevented me, and to have forgotten what they were !
Perhaps I said it was against the rules for a man with red whiskers to
second a man with black. I must have told some awful parable. I
know I helped to black-ball him. The Secretary of the Aborigines
Institute, Bally whobble, west of Ireland–Institute in debt, would my
well-known philanthropy induce me to come over in the winter, and
give them a gratis lecture, as full of humour as possible * Čould not
offer me a bed, but there was a tolerable commercial inn. Didn't go,
which explains why my brother's poems were so hideously abused in
the Connemara Howler. Miss MATILDA WERNoNBY (dessay her name's
VIGGINs)—would like a set of my works, with autograph presentation
inscription by their gifted author (that's me), and sends º, photograph.
Thirty-six, if an hour. Think I told her they were out of print. Another
lady!. MRs. DE Melville-BELVILLE-has a fine and valuable collec-
tion of likenesses of eminent men (which is an interesting fact), and
begs I will obtain for her the photographs and autographs of all the
Contributors to Punch,--I must remember meeting her at Margate in
1847. Must is for the QUEEN–and—ha! This was a plant! The
Government wanted to know the names of the real Administration of

A note from the Editor of the above-mentioned popular periodical,

letter, in a small, gentlemanly hand. No right to intrude, but feels
certain that a narrative of his troubles will induce me to extend assist-
ance. I felt quite certain that it wouldn’t, the less that I had two
previous letters from the same troubled º with different signatures
and greatly varied narratives. I relieved him as a paralysed doctor, an
again as an artist who had lost his sight, but I could not feel for him a
third time, when he appeared as a clergyman who had been ruined by a
fugitive banker. Keep this letter, against his fourth Avatar. This is
a bold hand—the writer is no beggar. , Yes, he is, an impudent beggar.
Signs himself ARISTARCHUs, and says that he has read my writings with
a disgust he cannot describe (who asked him?), and that he has no doubt
that in my black heart I find echoes of all the sentiments of my objec-
tionable characters. Very well, that’s no business of his'n. A pink
note. Ah! that was a sell, a cruel sell. The hand-writing so prett
and all so dainty, and I thought-of course if it had been so I .#
have answered her in a fat erly manner, and sent her Dr. Gregory's
Legacy to his Daughters—but it was an invitation to examine the
inclosed list of Pīces of coals at the Slaterubble Colliery. “Hang
her, foul collierſ’’. Such tricks, however, defeat themselves, for I
would sooner burn blue books and missionary reports all the evening
than coals advertised so treacherously. Hm! wheels. IIe's a long

A WIDOWED HERO, AND A LEANDER WANTED.
MR. PUNCH, who reads every line in every paper published, in
England and her Scotch and Irish dependencies, finds the following
advertisement in the columns of his excellent friend the Scotsman. He
takes, or makes this opportunity of congratulating the Scottish capital
upon the falsity of the rumour that the admirable editor of the great
dinburgh paper is not to be taken away to supervise the Government
Stationery, and see that our clerks do not write love-letters on national
foolscap. Had he, however, come to Town, it was Mr. Punch's intention,
in the interest of the country, to insist that the duties of the Stationery
Office should be united to those of the Inspector of Salmon, as MR.
Russel—conscientiously carrying out the golden rule, “nulſa dies sine
lined,”—is equally § in gaſling fishes and Tories. This tribute
paid, Mr. Punch proceeds to fry his own fish. Lege /
ATRIMONY.—A WIDOW LADY of 40, no Family, with £2000
yielding five per cent, and £300 ready cash, wishes to re-enter the holy estate.
The gentleman must be 40, not beyond 45, tail, of good carriage, have good teeth
and hair, and be most particular in his personal habits, accustomed to daily immer-
sion. Letters and cartes strictly private ; returned if required. Address, No. 000,
Scotsman Office.
Mr. Punch himself so exactly meets all the lady's wishes, and her
money is so exactly what would keep him in cigars for a year, that but
for a circumstance over which he has no control (his wife) he would
have immediately taken the limited mail, and sought out the fair female.
| Having, however, thrown himself away before he knew his own value,
after the fashion of too many great men, according to their own account,
he can only express his hoſe that the lady's wish to re-enter the Holy
Estate may be agreeably fulfilled. The sound sense evinced by her
demand that her Next shall wash himself every day makes us believe
that she is a very estimable relict.

PUNCH, OR THE
And Saints that faithful worshippers
Have stooped to tip the wink to—
Non possumus /
In short, there’s but one article
Of all the awful fourscore
Which with your “acerbissimum”
You've been compelled to o'erscore,
Which I accept with faith devout,
And that’s your last citation–
That the Pope needs must progress fight
And hate civilisation . . . .
That creed you well may preach, in proof
Of your infallibility—
Since the reverse you once upheld
With all your small ability. -
While heretics all blessed the name
At whose sound now they groan “Oh!”
And Roman men cried “Pio’” then,
Who since can but cry “No-no !”
If I must choose—truth on this side,
On that your cyclic stemma—
*Twixt the horns of a Papal bull
And horns of a dilemma,
I’d face the bull's : their º: are blunt,
As Europe's voice should warn you,
Answ’ring your bellow with the cry
“Foenum habet in cornu.”
When that cry rose in Roman times,
Of danger 'twas a warning
From bull with hay upon his horn,
Now ’tis a voice of scorning,
Proclaiming you a man of straw,
And simple straws the terrors
Of horns which gore what we think truths,
And you condemn as errors!
Pig before the cherished faiths
f thinking men you went at,
But you’d remembered “Deus quos
Pult perdere dementat.”
Horns, if they will not bend, may break,
God's truth earth won’t be curst off:
And when weak bulls charge strong stone walls,
'Tis not wall comes the worst off.

Explosion at Rome.
It is our painful duty to record a terrific explosion
which has just occurred at the Vatican. This accident
arose from want of caution, on the part of the Pope
and the College of Cardinals in .*.*. a fulmi-
nating composition which, they had been some time
engaged in preparing for the demolition of all modern
ideas. Almost before the destructive, mixture had left
their hands, it blew up with a noise which was heard all
over Europe, and morally brought the venerable edifice
in which they were assembled about their ears.
SEASONABLE.
A SERVANT, to whom money is an object, during the
present winter offers (unbeknown) to ſet out his
master's study fire by the hour. For terms apply to the
Pantry, Belgravia.
HOW THEY DO IT.
It is always interesting to theatre-goers, but especially at this time
of year, to know through what processes, behind the scenes, the Operas,
Pantomimes, Burlesques, and Extravaganzas, are obliged to pass, before
they are ready for production.
It is the popular notion that plays generally are “dashed off” by the
Author in his spare moments, or in his comfortable after-dinner leisure,
over a cigar and a cup of coffee.
The public is right, as usual.
The proceedings in the case of an opera are on this wise;
The Manager writes to the Composer thus:—
“Dear O'QUAVER,-Write me, an opera. , I will give you seven
thousand seven hundred and eighteen pounds six shillings and five-
pence halfpenny for it. Yours truly. BoBUs.”
The Composer answers:—
“Dear BoBUs.--Make it up to the sixpence, and I’m yºurs ever.
“O’QUAVER.”
The Manager agrees to this advance upon the original terms, and
O'QUAVER sets to work.
In a few days’ time it is done.
In the first place, the Composer has to whistle over the entire opera
to the Manager, if he has got any ear for music; if not, the whistling
is merely a matter of form, and often consists of several repetitions of
“Rule Britannia,” with which the Manager is as much delighted as
with the most varied novelties.
The Composer's next business is to hum the songs, concerted pieces,
and such like, to the singers, º the same with imitations of the
accompaniments, to the orchestra. The #: or violin is never used in
conveying these first impressions, as it is highly desirable that all instruc-
tion should actually come from the Composer's own mouth. It is well
known in musical circles how difficult it was for even SIGNOR MARIoto
acquire, in this manner, the music of “Les Huguenots.” SIGNOR
Costa's oratorio, “Eli,” was, got up in this fashion. It is almost a
painful sight to see the gifted Composer, whoever, he may be, sitting
for hours on a high stool patiently whistling over his choice melodies
to the attentive, but occasionally dull, musicians. The parts for the
drum and cymbals are left to the inspiration of the moment; the sheets
of ºper in the orchestra being merely dummies to deceive the
public.
The method of getting up a Burlesque, Extravaganza, or Pantomime
differs according to the theatre where it is produced. The piece itself
is scribbled, off-hand, on bits of waste paper, backs of old envelopes, and
the like. Sometimes the greater part of the MS. is written on shaving
paper during the Author's toilette.
The Prompter *:::: these slips, and the parts for the different
actors are improved, added to, and touched up with songs during a
rehearsal.
In some theatres the Manager or actor {j a line in here and there
or the Manager's friends drop, in and kindly give a few hints an
suggestions with which the Author has nothing whatever to do. Low
comedians fling in their songs wherever they like; ballet dancers intro-
duce their steps at pleasure; and thus, with each individual Y.;
for the general good, the piece produced must meet with decide
Success.
In other theatres, the Author, becoming suddenly inspired, summons
all the company into the green room, and there delivers orally the
entire Extravaganza, which they take down, as best they can, in short or
long hand in their notebooks. This is the flash of genius. ‘Now, when
{. see any piece of the kind above mentioned, remember these
Ings.

WHO IS WHERE AND WHATP
KIND people are continually sending Mr. Punch nice, little presents,
in their gratitude for the delightful amusement he affords them; and in
this way, he has received, in the course of his long service, many valu-
able additions to his library and larder. Thankfulness for his exertions
is expressed in various forms—from a volume of new poems to a sack of
new potatoes; and both the bodily and mental food which is thus given
him is appreciated duly by the members of his household as well as by
himself. One of the prettiest little gifts which reaches him at Christmas
is the Post Office London Directory for the ensuing year; a work which
is so useful as a book of daily reference, that every business man should
always keep it handy in his waistcoat pocket, providing that receptacle
be big enough to hold it.
The volume called Who’s Hºho is a serviceable book to Snobs who do
not visit, much with the nobility, and whose social education has so
shockingly been neglected that, in speaking of an earl, they can mistake
him for a marquis, or can imagine a mere baronet the first son of a duke.
Of course, to Mr. Punch, whose splendid powers of memory have been
ex º cultivated, such heinous misdemeanours are º impos-
sible: indeed he has the Peerage word for word by heart, and knows
the* and title and the motto and the age of all the nobles in the
land. But though he knows lº well Who's Who that, he meets
daily in high life, Mr. Punch finds it most difficult to remember, in the
lower orders Who is Where and What. This useful information the
Directory affords him, and it saves him from mistaking SMITH the
surgeon, for MR. SMITH the shoemaker, and helps him to find the shop
of MR. BRowN the butcher, or of Mr. Brown the baker, whenever
their attendants omit calling at his house.
A book that weighs about a stone can º be regarded as belong.
ing to light literature; and the Directory on this account is just one of
those works which you are glad to lay down again when you are forced
to take them up. But the Directory is really a most useful publication;
though, if London keeps increasing as of late years it has done, one
trembles to consider what a size the book will be a century or so hence.
Probably a crane will be required then to hoist it from one's bookshelf,
or one may have to build an extra story to one's house to hold it. This,
however, is a matter for posterity to deal with. For the present it
suffices that the Post §: Directory is really vastly handy notwith-
standing its stone weight; and the matter it contains is not at all more
heavy reading then one fairly may expect in such a BANTING of a book.
The Pope's Prize Bull.
By a telegram from the Eternal City we are informed that:-
“The Pope has issued a Bull condemning all moral, religious, and political
errors having a tendency hostile to the Catholic Church.”
. This Bull is not tied by the tail. ..It has a long tether and an exten-
sive range, if, indeed, it is tied at all. If all the conclusions of philo-
sophy, science, and statesmanship are figured as crockeries, the last
great Bull, let loose among them by his Holiness, may be pictured as
the Pope's Bull in a China-Shop.
“THE RANK WEED.”
THE only apology. Mr. Punch can find for the ex-tailor who acts as
patron of the Anti-Tobacco Gang, is that probably being an honest, if a
silly, ex-tailor, he has an aversion to Cabbage. British cigar-venders
will accept this intimation.
DISTINGUISHED CONVERT TO ROMANISM.
False Report.—Mr. Punch begs distinctly and emphatically to deny
that he has been received into the Roman Communion, and re-baptised
as Punch a la Romaine.

Twenty! and two fifteens ! and twelveſ and

a number of tons of mistletoe And what a

the average are caught beneath a ton of mistletoe.
How many thousand kisses, do you think, go to
the hundredweight? and supposing, that each
berry represents a kiss, how many million kisses
can there be in a ton? I do wish that MR. BAB-
BAGE, or some other great calculator, would
solve this interesting problem. ... I should so like

“THE TRADE IN Misri Eroe.—During the month of December last year the county of Hereford produced an
immense supply of mistletoe, which was forwarded to Liverpool, Manchester, and many of the adjoining
towns. It has ascertained that about 20 tons were sent from Hereford, 15 from Ledbury, 12 from Leo-
minster, 6 from Ludlow, 15 from Ross, and altogether above 80 tons from other localities. Many tons were

A TREAT FOR SWELLS.
..We are accustomed to hear a great deal of the example which, the
higher orders might set the lower; but let the former know that there
is abundant room for them to imitate examples afforded by the latter.
Let a bloated and proud aristocracy peruse and profit by the interest-
ing paragraph which follows, extracted from the Hampshire Inde-
pendent.
“SHANKLTN.—TREAT To The Navvies.—An entertainment to the men employed
on the Isle of Wight Railway was given in the National School-rooms, which were
decorated for the occasion. Among various devices the most striking was that of
“Welcome, Brothers,' which met the eye immediately on entering the rooms. It
was a novel sight to see upwards of two hundred stalwart fellows regaled with tea
and plum-cake, and to hear them sing the well-known hymn, “Just as I am,’ &c.
As soon as the tables were cleared, the Rev. G. W. Southouse, after a brief and
appropriate speech, introduced MR. WALSH, the indefatigable missionary, who made
some interesting and practical remarks, and was followed by the REv. J. G.
GREgory, Rector of Bonchurch. At the close of his address, the Chairman gave out
the hymn . . . . After many hearty cheers for the ladies and friends who had so
kindly contributed to the treat, the company dispersed, highly delighted with their
entertainment."
It certainly must have been a novel sight to see a gang of navvies,
two hundred strong, “regaled with tea and plum cake,” because
we are so accustomed to see navvies regale themselves with
bread-and-cheese and beer. Equally novel was the sight, of those
British Anakim engaged in singing the hymn, “Just as I am,” because,
when they have nothing better to do, we fº see them smokin
short pipes; and they seldom sing anything of a more devotiona
nature than “Cheer, Boys, Cheer.”
But how much more novel a sight it would be to see a set of officers
in the Guards, for instance, regaled with tea and plum-cake, instead of
champagne and claret and º of French culinary science 1
What a still greater novelty would it be to hear such a chorus of
allant gentlemen-obliging an assembly of smiling and sympathetic
holders with “Just as we are!”
Why should not the Rev. MR. BELLEw, or some equally competent
clergyman, attend on the occasion of a “Treat to the Swells,” and
deliver a brief, or rather a long, and appropriate speech, introducing
the indefatigable missionary, Mr. Punch, who might, make some
remarks which would be most h. interesting and particularly
practical? Many and hearty, no doubt, would be the cheers that
would be given both to the ladies and gentlemen who had contributed
to, and to those who had partaken of so real a treat as that, and the
company would surely disperse highly delighted with their entertain-
Inent.
Why should there not be an exhibition of officers of a crack regi.
ment, as well as navvies, humbling themselves like little children under
the tutelage of clergymen? If it is not derogatory to the manhood of
navvies to be rj. lum-cake and tea, and to sing hymns, can it
be degrading to that of officers and gentlemen?
ALLEGED HIGH TREASON AT STOCKBRIDGE.
WINDICATING the destruction of wood-pigeons, as, birds really mis-
chievous to the farmer, a Scotch gentleman from East Lothian thus
writes to the Times:–
“I see in the Field, with horror and disgust, that there is a club of fishers at
Stockbridge who have declared war against, kingfishers, and have, during last
summer, murdered 34 of those rare and beautiful birds."
If a true bill shall be returned against º parties at Stockbridge who
may be charged with the murder of kingfishers, they will deserve to be
tried for that crime at the next Winchester Assizes, and, if convicted,
to be hanged, and more than hanged. For fishers to kill kingfishers, is
worse than murder, it is obviously high treason, and the caitiſfs, who
offences, to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.

VERY SHABBY.
Rival. “THERE, IF You Don't Grve ME one, I'll TELL Your BRother,
'cause I saw You Kiss CHARLEY TURNER, Just Now, IN THE REFRESHMENT
Room.”
THE SOLONS OF SHREWSBURY.
JUSTICEs’iustice has come to be º notorious; and the Solons of
the Bench, if they have not realised their great Athenian prototype's
rule, “Know thyself,” are continually acting up to another rule,
“Commit thyself.”
But we do not remember to have heard any case of more exemplary
asinine action of the Great Unpaid than at Shrewsbury, last month,
when a sharper, who must have known the calibre of the Shrewsbury
Bench—probably they had acquitted him—by means of a mock warrant
took into custody MR. CHARLEs Ashworth, a respectable young gen-
tleman of Manchester, on a charge of stealing a watch and chain, and,
on the strength of his assumed character took possession of his watch,
purse, containing £9, and other articles.
How the Magistrates behaved, must be stated in MR. Ashworth's
own words:–
“I was taken before the Magistrates, who, after hearing the evidence against me,
and without asking me a single question, came to the conclusion that I was guilty,
and one of their number informed me, in a pompous and most offensive manner,
that I was remanded till eleven on the following day. I instantly demanded either
that I should be allowed to telegraph to my friends, or that the police should do so,
or that the Magistrates themselves should take some steps to ascertain the truth of
the statements I had previously made to the constable. These Solomons, however,
imagined that mischief might be done by allowing such a privilege, and, without
being permitted to say another word, I was marched out for the purpose of being
locked up in a felon's cell. This would undoubtedly have been my fate but for the
luckiest chance in the world. A reverend gentleman of my acquaintance happening
to be in the town, and hearing of my misfortune, at once hastened to my assistance,
and so exerted himself among the gentlemen who had just committed me to gaol,
that in a few minutes they were with me at the police-office, offering their best
wishes, condolences, and apologies for having placed me in such a position. They
did not, however (in the absence of their Clerk), feel themselves justified in settin
me at liberty, though my reverend friend offered bail to any amount, nor even di
they think fit to take any steps to ascertain from the Carmarthen police whether
the alleged robbery was fact or fiction. I was kept in custody till the expiration of
the remand, and then regained my liberty, as no prosecutor appeared."
Mr. Punch can add no force to this by any comment of his. It would
be indeed painting the lily to write down these gentlemen A.S.S.E.S.
A TOO COMMON CASE OF DISTRESS.
MR. PUNCH, -
ALLow me to call your attention to a case of dis-
tress which at this festive season stands in strong contrast
with the comfort which it is in the power of opulence to
command.
I was summoned yesterday to attend a patient residing
not a hundred miles from a house in a highly fashionable
district... I found him lying on the floor in a state of ex-
treme depression, with the veins of his temples much
swollen, and a face, nearly purple, especially about the
extremity of its most prominent feature—the nasal protu-
berance. His eyes, as visible through their half closed lids,
were much suffused, and he .# not completely open
them. I cannot say that he was sensible when aroused,
but he was so far from absolute unconsciousness as to
able toſº an inarticulate answer to the questions. I put to
him. e intimated that his head ached very badly, and I
understood him to say that he felt "deuced queer.” He
groaned heavily. There was considerable distension of
the abdomen. The respiration was difficult, almost ster-
torous; the pulse labouring. He was evidently much
distressed.
This, Sir, was a case of distress among the rich. This
º wife told me that he had eaten four meals a
ay for a week, partaking to excess of all the delicacies of
the season, and a great many other things besides. He
had consumed roast beef, turkey, sausages, and º:
enough to have sustained twelve labouring men; and he
had taken no exercise. Withai he had drunk his three
bottles of wine daily, besides beer.

example which is worth all precept, that moderation in

position has forced us habitually to practise?
Not wishing, to puff myself as a professional man, I
refrain from detailing the medical treatment I adopted in
this case of real distress, which it completely relieved; and

“A LEG UP.”
The success of SIGNOR Donato causes us to make the following
suggestion to the º Company Limited. There is many a poor
disabled soldier who, having been in his younger days considered as one
armed, can, now, alas! only be looked upon as one-legged, and who,
being unable either to enter the body of Čommissionnaires or Chelsea
Hospital, is, for the space of three years, kept alive by the º:
a-day generosity of a grateful country. Now, could not these honest
fellows be utilised in a ballet to support Donato, and, what is more to
the purpose, support themselves? Come, Limited Company, just turn
the matter over in your Limited º mind. We would suggest
a marine, subject for the ballet. Call it “The Limpets; or, Go it, ge
Cripples.” The management might make a large fortune out of this
notion, and would only have to go to a little legstra expense.

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE,
CHAP. VI.--THE LIGHT COMEDIAN.
THE Actor who embarks in this line of business will, of course, bear
in mind, that though his usual characters will be the Fops and Swells
of the past and present, he is not to consider himself bound to study
the actual manners of that class of persons in real life. .
To require this would be to restrict this line of business to persons
who by birth and education themselves belong to that class, or have by
circumstances been .#. in contact with it.
This would be impossible: and, if possible, intolerable. We should
gain nothing by it but the insupportable monotony of good-breeding,
the dulness of which is so often complained of in real life. Instead of
this, the tradition of the stage has preserved for us a volatile, brisk,
easy rattle, as unlike the actual Swell of this or any period, as cham-
pagne is unlike small beer. Both the light comedian and the champagne
are artificial, but how exhilarating! -
Always speak at a gallop; and acquire the art of running your words
of the tongue distinctly, without punctuation, emphasis, or pause for
breath. The lightness of your comedy depends mainly on the quantity
of “lengths” you can cover in a given time. “Pace” must, therefore,
be the first point in F. estimation: emphasis, character, emotion
and so forth, are out of your range, and should be avoided. indeed
you will do well never to allow any feeling whatever to be introduced
into your part if you can keep it out. If it is there, make as little of it
as possible, or even “guy it” (i.e. make it ridiculous), to use an
expressive technicality of the green-room. , Light comedy parts ought
not to be weighted with anything approaching to “the heavy;” and
if the Author forget himself so far as to mix up things so discordant, it
is the Actor's duty to correct his mistake.
In this, as in so many points, the example of SHAKSPEARE has been
mischievous to the Dramatist and injurious to the Actor, by its apparent
sanction of the blending of incongruities. -
Never enter a room by a door, if there is a French window. If the
author have neglected to provide an appropriate opportunity for such
an entry, see that the stage arrangement is altered so as to admit of it.
Always come into a room with your hat on, and keep it on, till you
can find an opportunity of putting it down somewhere... You may often
et an effect out of this, by choosing a bust, or some other comical rest
or your “tile.” There is nothing more embarrassing than a hat held
in the hand. -
Never pause to salute ladies, or the gentlemen who may be in the
room you are entering. It takes time and looks ceremonious. ...
Bejaunty and familiar in your manner with soubrettes and waiting-
maids: chuck them under the chin, call them “my dear,” kiss them,
and offer them money. These things are not done now, but they probably
were done in those livelier times, when our standard of stage manners
was settled. No doubt these manners were originally taken from real
life, and being found suitable for the stage, have survived there, after
dying out in Society. This is the very best reason for your sticking to them.
Never sit straight in a chair; turn its back to the audience, and cross
your arms atop of it. Sitting on the table, also, will be found effective,
and will enable you to swing your legs in a dégagé and stage-gentleman-
like manner.
Slap your friends on the shoulder, in speaking to them, and poke
elderly persons in the ribs. These are more of those valuable relics of
a former state of manners, which have been happily preserved for us in
the matrix of stage-tradition, as the ichthyosauri and pterodactyls in
the lias and Qolite of the geologist., The stage is, indeed, little but an
accretion of fossilised manners; and it is your duty to deal with these
records of extinct, usage as reverently as PROFEssoR Owen would
handle a fossil of the Stonesfield slate, or an Elephant's tusk from the
Norwich mud. -
Let your dress be as light and as loud as possible. Wear white hats
in preference to black. Enamelled boots are indispensable on all occa-
sions, Never mind, whether you are supposed to be in evening,
walking, or shooting dress. You know you have only come from your
dressing-room; and “appearance” should be the light comedian's
first law. For the same reason, lavender or straw-coloured gloves
should always be worn.
Wrist-bands turned back over the coat-cuffs have a good effect, and
may be worn independently' of the shirt. Trousers tightly *.
over the boot, too, º: a smart and jaunty appearance, and both have
the great recommendation of having now disappeared from real life.
An easy run should be cultivated. It will get you over the stage
faster than walking, is not “realistic,” and looks light. -
You cannot be expected always to preserve “buoyancy” of feeling
in your performance. For this reason it is, important to have at your
command every little art of voice, limb and manner which looks light,
jº'ſ and free and easy. -
A distinguished light comedian of the present day, who carries these
happy resources of his art to their highest perfection—not MR. CHARLEs
MATHEws, who, I grieve to say, is always degenerating into the man-
ners of real life—once said to Mr. Punch, in complaining of a brother
light comedian who had dressed a part in clothes that might have been
worn by any young Swell of the day, “Had I played the part, Sir, I
should have worn a waistcoat like a volcano, and a crayat like a
: So well did he understand the true laws of light comedy

PUBLIC Don't want YER—Nos I Don't, Noa Nobody Don't ; so JIST DRop THEM BoABDs, AND THEN 'ook IT I’”
THE BULL-FIGHTER OF FRANCE.
Spoke CHARLEs Louis THIRD NApoleon to his lady standing by,
“Arch not that swan-neck in anger, dash the tear-drop from thine eye,
I am armed, and bent on mischief; of that Priest I’veº the pull,
And I'll teach him to considerere he sends another Bull.
"Thou and I have sat together gazing down upon the strife,
Gazing where the bull an . bleed away their forfeit life.
Now 'tis mine to fight the maddest Bull a Pope has dared produce,
And with simultaneous action I shall cook the Papal goose.
“Wauntful of his Scarlet Lady, that old humbug dares to say
France in choosing Kings has wandered from the Roman faith away:
Kings are things of right divinest, not for mortal votes to choose—
This to me, the Millions' Chosen—he shall shiver in his shoes.
... He has launched his Bull against me—in the dust it shall be laid—
In its backbone's inmost marrow I will sheathe a griding blade:
He has bid the Bishops thunder—and I answer with the law—
I will clap the sternest stopper on each Prelate's saintly jaw.
"This he dares to call an Error—this he gives the Church's ban,
‘..That the #. to smite ill rulers is the sacred Right of Man.’
He’d be smitten, if I had not, scorning to do things by halves,
Backed the old ungrateful beggar with my baggy-trousered Zouaves.
"Look not sad, my lovely lady, rather help to deck my lance,
For the battle I am giving is for thee, our child, and France-
He’d deprive thee of a title dearer far to thee than life~
If The Elected's an Impostor—graceful Consort, what's his wife?
"Therefore give thy kiss and blessing, in the dust his Bull shall roll,
On the crimson sword of justice sputtering out its bigot soul:
While I keep the Holy Vicar safely in St. Peter's be
He shall keep a civil tongue, love, in his old but foolish head.”
So replied C. L. NAPOLEON unto Europe's fairest Queen;
How she answered needs not mention—say she whispered, “All serene;”
Then he rushed to the arena, Europe cheered him to the fray,
Toby wished he were a bull-dog, and his Master cried Hooray!
A GOOD WORD FOR A GOOD WORK.
A HARDworker himself, Mr. Punch admires hard work in others;
and he specially admires the hard work which is done as a matter of
amusement, and in the hours of leisure. This Mr. Punch most likes to
see, because it shows him that the worker is not overworked in his
business avocations, but has both brain and muscle ready for whatever
extra labour he may happen to delight in. Thus Mr. Punch admires
the Homer of his noble friend LORD, DERBY, a work perfected in the
leisure of a statesman out of office, which leisure might have been less
profitably used. Other samples of such leisure-labour have been
shown with great success in the industrial exhibitions which have
recently been held in both the South and North of London, and Mr.
Punch is glad to see that further specimens are promised for public
exhibition in both the East and West. When it is known that these
displays have Mr. Punch's thorough sanction and his fullest appro-
bation, of course there will not be a shade of fear lest they should fail.
Everyone will take a pride in helping that which Mr. Punch considers
a good work, and worthy,to be helped. Industrial, exhibitions will
become so vastly fashionable that the idlest of the idlers at the West
End will contribute to them with as much zeal as the hardest of the
workers at the East.

WHEN the celebrated Donato arrived in Town he found himself the
subject of legal proceedings, . Somebody, who ought to have known
but didn't, informed us that his dancing was against the law. “What
law?” we asked. “What law?” says our friend, “why the Legs
Tagliosi's, of course.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VICTIM OF FICTION.
Being passages from the Diary of a young Gentleman in the Law, who is a
confirmed reader of Novels, and nothing else.
Monday Night.—“I shall not return.” Such were º words as I
closed the street door behind me this morning. “Are they ominous?
I meant only that I should not return until night, but what if some
fatal event should fulfil them, and they should be evidence on the
coroner's inquest.' " So I pondered, as I went to the omnibus. But I
am home again. Next me sat a well-dressed man, with white hair.
He murmured at the slowness of the vehicle. His smile was kindly,
but that was probably hypocritical. He was doubtless eager to take
up some bill he had forged, and thus prevent the crime from being
detected. To the office of MR. Asphopel, the Governor. How weari-
some and pettifogging were the daily details of a lawyer's clerk's life
until I learned to look at them in the lurid light shed by knowledge of
the world! Now the Governor’s Attendance-Book is one long romance.
He gave me instructions to draw a certain marriage settlement. I will
note no name save in cipher. I believe that Miss KLGBBSNG hates
CAPTAIN GRRPLLGMB, and has a concealed passion for her guardian.
LoRD ARRwggBNX, who brought her to our place. I saw a look which
spoke volumes. When I witness her signature, I will try to test this.
MR. JollipſeLD brought his father's will for us to get it proved. The
water-mark betrays nothing, and the whole looks fair, but there was a
furtive expression about his eye as he told the Governor to lock it up.
Note. The latter asked for the key of our strong room, and did not
return it. Will he be there to-night—is he there now, when all of us
are gone—and why? I was last to leave. I wish I had tied a thread
across the door. Reading in bed till 2 A.M.
Tuesday Night.—MRs. SMILER, who with her husband are fellow-
boarders here, was most attentive to her husband this morning,insisted on
arranging his neck-scarf before he went out, and took out a pin which
she declared was ugly, putting in another. But she did not kiss him—
only laughed a merry Good-bye. Was that pin to be a signal to some
one whom he would meet & Such things are common. Office. AsPHODEL
returned the key, and said he forgot to do so overnight. He is not one
who commonly forgets, especially any trumpery blunder in detail which
you may make when your mind is excited with sensations of which his
cold heart knows nothing. My friend and companion in my room, BoB
ChowPRR, very grave to-day, Would not talk, declaring that he had a
heavy case to master. This idle excuse did not serve with me; but Isaid
nothing. Has he committed some crime * . He has refused more than
once to go to the theatre with me. I must look at the playbills, and see
whether the pieces I proposed to see were of a kind to act upon his con:
science. Watched him writing a letter, which he locked up. Why did
he not put it into our box, to be called for, like other letters? But I
will never betray him. Reading as usual till nearly 3.
Wednesday Night—Called to-day, in Half Moon Street, to read the
proposed marriage settlement to the parties. Miss KLGBBSNG was
very amusing, chatted gaily with her fiancé, and even made fun of some
of our law terms. This must be assumed—is it natural to a young girl
within a fortnight of so awful a step as matrimony ? His Lordship was
not there. Probably he has not her power of self-command, and could
not bear to see his rival's apparent happiness. The REVEREND MR.
CLIPPER came, and got the Governor to give him a cheque for £200.
Yet MR. C. is rich, and his bankers are in the next street but two. I
have heard that before his marriage he was much admired by ladies—
is there some dark ºysteº and MRs. CLIPPER not to see the entry in
the banker's book? MR. SPRIGGINGs called, and the Governor
man to go out without seeing him. Why was this P , There are
three boxes of deeds in the strong room, marked with S.’s name. I
will offer to inder the contents. MRs. BKKLJVXBJTT called, and the
porter said that she went away in tears. AsphodEL can be very brutal
when he likes—he has said coarse things to me when I have forgotten
to write what he called important letters. Read till 2:35, when I fell
asleep, and the candle burnt out in socket. No harm done, except
tallow all over the bolster. Gave ANNE a shilling to manage that her
mistress should not know. She promised to put my bolster on some
one else's bed, and give me his. This girl makes me shudder. In what
region of crime could she have been taught such subtle craft P Has she
ever had part in a murder? I will watch her.
Thursday Night.—A letter for MRs. SMILER, at breakfast." He asked
whom it was from. She laughed, and told him to mind his own busi-
ness. And that could throw him off the scent—that assumption of
innocent fun! I will never wed—I know women too well. She told
him that she was going to her dressmaker's. The fool pretended to
fasten up his purse, determinately, as if warning her against extrava-
gance. And then she laughed again. Well she might. My eye was
on her, and she looked foolish. But it is no business of mine. The
office. DR. SPIDERwort called, and I, having to go in to speak to the
Governor, heard them talking about life-assurance. They stöpped when
I entered, and the doctor put something into his pocket. We have
heard of medical men hastening the payment of sums assured—and how it
has been done. What was in that packet, or whatever DR.S. pocketed?
I had a suspicion across me to-night that this diary is seen by
other eyes than my own. ANNE gave a strange glance when she handed
me my candlestick; a grin, I should have understood, but this was
more mysterious...I have taken means to ascertain whether my lock is
tampered with. Whoever, you are, who are clandestinely reading this,
#. are betrayed Could not read to-night for thinking of my
Stratagem.
Friday, Night-A most unpleasant, circumstance. SMILER came
down early, and finding me alone, said he had wanted to speak to me.
I prepared myself to be his confidant, when he intimated that if I stared
º more, in an offensive manner, at his wife, he would pull my nose
off. I smiled sarcastically, knowing what I knew; but no more passed.
Walked into town. A Frenchman accosted me, and in his own lan-
guage asked me the way to the French Embassy. I had forgotten
where it was, and expressed . regret. He smiled in a melanchol
way, and said that he had suddenly arrived, and was without |...}.
money, but it did not matter—and he was sure, as I spoke French so
beautifully, I should understand his feelings. I begged him, with
apologies, to accept half-a-crown for a cab. . He took it. But I felt it
my duty to write a full and exact account of what I had done (de-
scribing the person), and send it to the French Embassy, as this man
may be dangerous. Office. Asked the Governor whether I should
index SPRIGGINGs's papers. He, abruptly told me to get on with the
work I had already in hand. This confirms, my suspicions. ...I forgot
my precautiqns about this diary, and cannot tell to-night whether it has
been touched. But I will take it away, and keep it at the office. Casually
asked ANNE what she .# of BLOGGs, who is now being tried, and
she said she hoped he would be hung. A female heart hardened against
. and a female hypocrite, affecting indignation against crime! I
#"fºre that she took my new and unused ivory toothbrush. Read
Saturday Night.—Write at the office, all the clerks gone. Our house
disgusting this day. MRS. SMILER has a baby, and SMILER rampaging
about the premises in ecstasy—would shake hands with me, and make me
take wine—was sure I had meant nothing rude, but ladies require extra
humouring at times—invited me to the christening—a joyous beast.
The old gentleman with white hair, whom I saw in the omnibus, and
suspected of forgery, came, and turns out to be MRs. SMILER's uncle,
as rich as º, of course. Got away from their senti-
mentalities, and to the office. Large letter from the French Embassy,
stating that the man I had relieved was a notorious street beggar, who
lundered foolish persons by complimenting them on their French,

me that he was a father, that he had been uneasy about MRs. C. all the
week, but that now all was glorious, and I should come to the christen-
ing. I answered rather coldly, on which he roared, and told me to
marry, and see how I liked it. I marry ! I have read too much for
that. But a further astonishment awaited me. DR.SPIDERworT came
in, and not finding the Governor, looked into my room, and told me
I should be happy to hear that MRs. AsPHodEL had got a fine boy, and
was going on capitally. And as I looked, he said, a judge of pretty
things, he showed me a Dagmar brooch which he was going to present
to her, because AsphodEL, like a pertinacious fellow, had insisted on
paying him a fee. It was the very packet I had seen him hide / Pre.
sently in came the Governor, as pleased as Punch, and sends me off to
MRs. , bother, no use in ciphers now, MRs. WEEPING WILL, to
say, with his love, that he had º her boys into the War Öffice;
and when ſtold her she cried, and said he was the best man in the
world, and that she should never forget his kindness last Wednesday.
Seems I took a wrong view. Have to hurry up my entries, as that
brute the porter wants to shut up. Ask him why he is in such a
hurry. Says his missis has been confined to-day, and he naturally
wants to be at home. I should have thought the reverse, but these
creatures have no sensitiveness. So close in a hurry.
The remaining entry is in the handwriting of MR. AsphodEL.
“The donkey who wrote the above has left me some months, and I
find this stuck in an unfinished document that was discovered in his
drawer, amid a detestable litter. For his further information, if he
receives this by post, I may state that the marriage he mentions
was a love-match, and most happy, and Miss KLGBBSNG, now MRs.
GRRPLLGMB, has just had a beautiful baby, who is called after Lord
Annwººns. "That Mr. Joiºid was the most dutiful of sons to
the kindest of fathers, and that the will, though perfectly regular, has
not yet consoled him for the loss of his parent, §. I, who was so
unfortunate as to incur my clerk’s suspicions, by wanting the key of
my own safe, merely wished to stow away, £200 in notes, which my
client, the Rev. MR. CLIPPER, had received from his wife, who had
saved the money for a purpose which does not concern my clerk, but
there was no wickedness in it. That I did see MR. SPRIGGINGs on the

NOTES ON THE PAPAL BULL.
The Bull of the Pope does not seem º likely to prevail upon Europa.
º a red-hot roaring Bull, the Bull of PHALARIs was nothing to the Pope's
ull,
Is not the Pope's Bull speculation rather likely to bear the market for Popery
The Bull just turned loose by the Pope is not unlikely to toss reasonable people
over the pale of the Church. -
If the Pope lives, he will perhaps send his next Bull to a Cattle Show, which,
of course, will be that of the Smithfield Club. --- - -
Can the Successor of PETER expect that his Bull will bring into his treasury an
increase of Peter's Pence convertible into any large amount of bullion ?
To be sure it may be argued by some captious people that the Encyclical Letter
which has just been put forth by the Hºly Father is not properly called a Bull;
but, everybody possessed of common sense must see that it is about the greatest
Bull that was ever made.
A SAFE MAN.
mºnks' on the archiepiscopate of Canterbury, a writer in the Post says
at:—
“In the W. day the position has lost nothing of its social importance, ecclesiastical
power, moral greatness, and peril.”
On, consideration, the author of the above sentence will withdraw the word
“peril.” . In these days the ARchbishop of CANTERBURY would be in no danger
of being burned, if he were to turn Quaker. Indeed, should his Grace the Primate
of All England think ſit tº join the Society of Friends, or even the Mormons, there
would be very considerable diſliculty in getting anything done to him.

With joy the proof I hail, John,

How her powder's devil’s-dust, John,
Her shot, that in the Bank:
How by the self-same skill, John,

Not by broadside, but by bill, John,
Young England makes her way.
How Arms are in the hole, John,

How for Warfare's bloody bowl, John,

How a blessed band of brothers, John,

But I couldn't shut my eyes, John,
To your idol's feet of .
I saw its front of brass, John,

Still stretching to amass, John,

I saw that of the jº', John,
Chained to Trade's chariot-wheel,
There’s little that she would, John,
Of the ill, less she can heal.
And as for cutting throats, John,

Just ask the Federal votes, John,
If Trade's hands don’t come pat.

ADWERTISING ATROCITIES.
WHERE, we wonder, will the mania for advertising stop?, What
new dodge will next be tried in puffery and posters! Here in England
we hang out our advertising banners on qur outer walls, and plaster
flaring placards on the outsides of our omnibuses. Our railway stations
are disfigured with big advertising placards, and the names of puffing
tradesmen are chalked on our dead walls and painted on our pave-
ments. Even in our pantomimes advertisements intrude; our harle-
quins do tricks whose sole aim is to puff, and here and there one sees a
whole, scene fitted with purely advertising notices. All this is bad
enough, but there is far worse done in Canada, if we may trust what
follows:—
“OUTRAGE on NATURE.-The practice of 'defacing, with great advertisements,
rocks, trees, and bridges, in spots visited for their remarkable beauty, is extending
in Canada. A correspondent of the Montreal Gazette writes: ‘This morning I find a
circular among my letters, in which an advertising agent coolly proposes to deface
the country in the most systematic manner, carrying with him “a corps of bill-
posters, painters, &c., to put advertisements on the prominent rocks, bridges, and
fences,” which he designates as “the most novel as well as the cheapest way of
advertising.”.” Some of the loveliest glens and vales in the White Mountains and
other parts of the States are barbarously disfigured with ineffaceable advertisements
of quack medicines. A bill is to be introduced into the New York. Legislature
making this disgraceful practice penal.”
Penal. We should hopeso. Such offences should be punished by
the hardest of hard labour. To spoil the scenery of GRIEVE, BEVERLEY
and TELBIN is mischievous enough, but what are to say of men who
thus contract to spoil the scenery of Nature? The wretch who would
deface a lovely view with a vile poster is a miscreant who would not
shrink from any act of nature-slaughter. One, might expect him to
turn Mont Blanc into an ice-factory, or to utilise Niagara by making
it a mill-stream. --- - -
Tourists tell us that the Catacombs are covered with inscriptions,
and that the names of pill-mongers are painted on the Pyramids.
Perhaps we soon may hear that the dome of St. Peter's has been
placarded º ". or that cheap tailors have been painting their
puffs upon the Tuileries. Even this, however, would not be so vile as
the system of defacing a fine º: with big placards, and we wish
the Hammerdryads (if there be any of them extant) would just hammer
at the heads of the contractors for such puffery until their brains be
impressed with all the reverence for Nature which appears now to be
wanting to them.
“WANTED, A WHITE SLAWE—CHEAP.”
. MR PUNCH has seen a good many cool things in the way of adver.
tisements for Governesses. But the following strikes him as about the
coolest:—
GoyPRNE is WANTED, near town, age about 25, a lady by birth,
of refined habits, strict principles, Church of England, to instruct four
children in good English, correct French, and music, and to teach them order and
discipline. Salary, £30. It is desired that the lady should be active and cheerful,
cºntented to live entirely in herown rooms, and if possible be absent from Saturday
till Monday, unless left in charge. Apply, in person, at – Street, St. James's, this
day (Monday), between 11 and 2.
What a happy country this should be, if ladies by birth, of refined
habits, strict principles, able to teach four children good Énglish, correct
"rench, music—to say nothing of “order and discipline”—are so plen-
tiful that they can be had for £30 a year! When this modest advertiser
was about it, why did he not throw in, among his conditions, German,
painting in oil and water-colour, singing, the rudiments of Latin, arith.
metic, and algebra, the first six books of Euclid, and the use of the Globes?
But he is quite right in requiring the qualifications of cheerfulness and
contentment, even without the suggested additions to his very moderate
requirements. The lady who takes such, a situation ought to be not
only cheerful under circumstances to which the worst of Mark Tapley’s
were child's play, but contented with treatment which might rouse the
patience of a saint.
There is ºnly one set-off-she would have the prospect of “living
entirely in her own rooms.” This must be a decided comfort in the
case of the insolent snobs who could put out such an advertisement.
The "absence—iſ possible—from Saturday to Monday,” is an ingenious
º of escaping the charges of the lady's maintenance on the Sunday,

A BIRD IN THE HAT.
S To the Editor of Punch.
IR,
. . AGREAT deal is said about the mission of Woman. In the
opinion of the First NApoleoN, Woman's mission, consists in dressing
and decorating herself, and trying to make herself look as pretty as she
can. This view has much in it, that is undeniable, but it is not quite
true. If it were, Woman would have no mission after a certain age,
when the attempt to look anything better than venerable is unsuccessful.
hile, however, beauty lasts, it certainly is the mission of Woman
to make the most of it. Fashionable novelties, therefore, which enhance
the personal appearance of young ladies, can reasonably be objected to
by none but those who have to pay for them without profiting by
them; fathers who do not care about the looks of their daughters, or
do not expect investment in their daughters' wardrobe to pay by pro-
curing sons-in-law to take those young ladies off their hands.
Sir, I have no sympathy with such curmudgeons. I am glad of any-
thing, that vexes them. Therefore, I much approve of a sweet thing
that has just turned Fº hats. I mean girls' hats, of course. The
sweet thing is a stuffed bird—the kingfisher generally; but I have also
seen tropical birds of brilliant plumage in hats. Of course this sweet
.."; is expensive, but how very pretty it is, how becoming! Let surly
old fellows abuse it and grumble at it—we youth laugh at them.
..What I have to suggest is, that other zoological º: besides
kingfishers, and tropical birds, should be used for the adornment of
young ladies' hats. There are various British birds—goldfinches,
chaffinches, greenfinches, bullfinches, yellowhammers, water-wagtails,
and golden-crested wrens—that would do equally well for that purpose,
and some of them better, for the kingfisher does not perhaps suit every
complexion. It might become what I believe is called a brunette, but
not perhaps what [ think you term a blonde. But I say why should
your daug ters and your damsels limit themselves for ornaments of this
description to the domain of ornithology? Why not travel farther
afield into the animal kingdom P. Rats . mice, small hedgehogs, bats,
toads and frogs, lizards and snakes, might be mounted in the hat with
great effect., Such, creatures, if not pretty in themselves, if indeed,
simply considered, horrid things, are, eligible for that very, reason in
some cases. A toad would not exactly sit gracefully on the head-dress
of an elderly female, but squatting over the brow of youth and loveliness
it would set off the beauty of the wearer by contrast. Let me, there-
fore, suggest the employment of reptiles and yermin for decorative pur-
posés by all young ladies who feel, as probably most young ladies do,
that they can afford, whether their parents can or no for them, to sport
queer embellishments. And then we shall not have the most beautiful
of all British birds extirpated, which would be a pity, even if the
kingfishers were all sacrificed to a consideration so momentous as the
trimming of a hat.

BUONAPARTE'S GULL.
An Ornithologist writes to the Times announcing that a specimen of
Buonaparte's gull has been shot at Falmouth. He says this is the first
known case of the bird being found in England. Two have been shot,
it seems, in Ireland, and one in Scotland. -- -
We are delighted to hear Buonaparte's gulls are such a rarity in
these islands. The two Irish ſº were, no doubt, Fenian or
Ultra-montane. Their rarity is the more remarkable here, considerin
that in France Buonaparte's gulls may be counted by millions, an
have occasionally been shot there in great numbers, particularly on
the 2nd of December, 1851.
A Derivation.
“Why is this new dye called Aniline, dear Mr. Punch **, asked a
charming young lady philosopher at a recent conversazione. “It is, a
word derived from anile, my love,”, was PROFEssoR PUNgh's reply;
“ and the meaning is, that when people grow anile, they ought to dye.”
“Dear old thing,” said the young lady, “the older you grow, the wiser
and wittier you get.” “The child speaks truth,” said the eminent
Professor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DOCK LEAVES.
NE may say that the
beneficent and genial
influences of ist-
mas have not en-
tirely passed away
with our indiges-
tions. Even in the
halls of the stern
Themis, there, are
still the sparklin
epigram, the toucho

castic poke and the
merry laugh. The
law and police re-
ports of the past
week contain a pro-
fusion of good fun
and Pune would
not willingly let it
10.
He has, selected
a few of the comic
gems from the Courts
of Justice, and has
re-set them for the
delectation of man-
kind:—
“WESTMINSTER.
“ANN CheeseMAN, a woman about 50 years of age, was charged with being tipsy
and assaulting the police. She was sitting on the step of a door, and when the
policeman raised her up to remove her, she gave him a smack ºn the face.
“Defendant. Oh, it's a peculiarity I have, your Worship—it was only a joke.
“MR, SELFE. Did you see the joke, Constable?
“PolicEMAN. No, Sir, I did not; she gave me a smartish smack.
“MR. SELFE. MRs. CHEEsemAN, how came you in this state?
“DEFENDANT. Why, it was under peculiar circumstances. I was having some
beer—very little, your Worship—when some larkish young men who were there
put some spirits into the beer—some gin, your Worship.
“MR. SELFE. You were not obliged to drink the gin.
“DEFENDANT. Yes, I was, your Worship.
“MR. SELRE. How?
“DEFENDANT. If I hadn't drunk the gin I must have lost my beer.
“MR. SELFE. Yes, I see—a case of necessity.
“DEFENDANT. I hope you will forgive me, I am going to the workhouse. I will
never come here again. #. was a peculiar circumstance that overcame me this time.
Pray let me go.
“TMR. SELFE. Do you think I can take your word?
“DEFENDANT. Yes, you can. I'll not come out of the workhouse.
“MB. SELFE. Underſthese circumstances you may keep your word. Don't come
here again.”
MR. SELFE is an admirable Magistrate, and the way he tackled the
shifty Qratorian, in the case of the kidnapped, girl the other day, en-
titles him to all plaudit. The above report shows that he can make
allowance for Peculiar Circumstances, and as the circumstances will be
very peculiar indeed under which Mr. Punch will stand in MR. SELFE's
or any other dock, Mr. Punch, registers a vow, that should he feel
inclined to break the law, he will break it in the Westminster police-
district. He trusts that MR, SELFE will then discharge him with a
compliment, in order that he may be able, tº º with his wonted
brilliancy, that another proverb is smashed, for that SELFE praise is a
great recommendation. He now proceeds to the—
“THAMES.
“Thomas HENRY JAckson, a tall, well-dressed young man of aristocratic bearing
was brought before MR. PAGET, charged with knocking at the doors of sundry and
divers inhabitants of the Parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, otherwise Stebonheath,
without lawful excuse.
“The Prisoner said me had been out with a few friends last night, and was not
quite sober or quite tipsy. His friends knocked at his door at Christmas time, and
he returned the compliment by knocking at theirs.
“The mother of the Prisoner here made an appeal to the Magistrate in favour of
her son, and said he was a young man born in Stepney.
“MR._PAGET. That is no reason he should hammer at people's doors i the night
time. You should teach him better.
“MoTHER. He has been brought up very genteelly. We are very respectable.”
From “aristocratic bearing” down to “very respectable” is a great
drop, but we will not inquire too closely as to what may be the Thames
district notions of aristocratic manners. We have, in other days, heard
true aristocracy defined as wearing your hat on one side. MR. PAGET's
retort that the young nobleman's having been born at Stepney was no
reason for his hammering at doors at night, was capital, but he missed
another epigram about people who are born half-seas over being erro-
neously supposed to be parishioners of Stepney. The Prisoner was in
that condition, being as he declared entre pins, or rather probably,
despite his aristocracy, between two beers. We hope that he has been
brought up too º as his, Mamma said, to state that the beak
fined him ten bob, as a short, ill-dressed young man of democratic
bearing might have said, and again we move on to—
“GREENWICH.
“WM. JAMEs MURPHY, a decently-dressed young man, of Church Street, Deptford
appeared to a summons to pay on a promissory note given on a loan from a Frien
of Labour Society.

which the balance due was now sued for had been made to one william ANNAREY,

( “DEFENDANT. Your worship I'm no scholar, and for the life of me I can't see
why, because a man marries a widow that therefore he ought to pay debts owing by
a woman's former husband. ( ###,
“MAGISTRATE. It all comes of marrying a rich widow. (Roars of laughter.) You
have the shop and fixtures which belonged to your wife's late husband.
“DEFENDANT (shaking his head). I'm not so sure of them. (Renewed laughter.)
It is true that I and the widow are married, but I'll tell you what she tells me.
She says the É. rty was not left for her benefit, but for the benefit of the two dear
children her husband left her with. (Roars of laughter.)
MR, SECRETARY MICHAEL NAGLE's name would seem to import that
he comes from the country against which MR. FAwcETT very properly
says we have no right to make contemptuous charges. Still, that
º “but” invites attention. There is a jolly Irish song which
Salull-
- “My father was a Quaker,
But an honest man
My mother was a Catholic,
And I'm a Protestan.”
The fortunate MR, MURPHY, too, may also be of the Irish persuasion,
and its keenness is shown in his conviction that it requires scholarship
to understand why you should pay your wife's debts. We may inform
him, however, that many persons with scholarship, have failed to descry
the reason, especially, in high life, when the creditor was a swindling
and extortionate milliner, and, in low life, when the creditor was a
swindling and extortionate º In this case, however, the
decently-dressed young MURPHY had to redeem his defunct predeces-
sor's credit with the Friend or Quaker of Labour. Well, we were so
much pleased at MR. PAGET's Court that we cannot do better than
again look into the
“THAMES.
“A well-DRESSED young woman was charged with being tipsy, and incapable of
taking care of herself.
“The Prisoner, who was attired in hat and feathers, a lace veil of fine texture,
a Paisley shawl worth at least four guineas, and a superb flounced black silk dress,

ailway.
“MR. PAGET. What do you mean?
“The Prisoner said she paid a visit to her brother and his wife yesterday at Pad-
dington, and proceeded there and back by the Underground Railway, which had
such an effect upon her that she became insensible.
“MB. PAGET. You were intoxicated.
“PRison ER. Yes. I had one glass of gin—no more—after leaving the Under-
ground Railway, I will never take any more.
“MR. PAGET. What are you?
“PaisonER. A policeman's wife. He has been twenty years in the force. Oh,
Sir, it is all owing to the Underground Railway. (Laughter.)"
This is the second vision of splendour that delighted the Thames-
street reporter....“Well-dressed”, is surely a tame phrase for such
magnificence. We should think that her evidence would, as Hamlet
ought to have said, astonish the ears of the tjndergroundlings. Mr.
Punch has travelled on the line (taking, of course, a third-class ticket
and riding in a first-class carriage, as becomes an habitué), but he does
not recollect ever having had to be carried away on a stretcher, like
this lady, though, having listened to the swagger of the City men who
use the line, he has carried away a great many stretchers with him,

so proud of his new helmet that she got, as the Americans say, a brick

her move on. -

writing abusive letters, after the fashion of these nuisances, filled with
grievances. SIR ALEXANDER remonstrated, but for a long time with
small success. At last the Judge had a chance.

THE SLANG OF THE STAGE.
WHAT queer people there are in the world, and especially in the
world dramatic. For instance, look at this odd catalogue of persons
who are wanted for a theatre :-
WANTEP (to º on the 24th of January), a Leading Gentleman,
Juvenile First Low Comedian, Three or Four Utility Gentlemen, a Leading
Lady, Heavy Juveniles, a Lady to Sing and Dance, and Two Utility Ladies. Parties
engaged will please to meet on the stage at the Theatre.
Now that idleness is thought rather a lady-like accomplishment,
“utility ladies” are not so vastly plentiful, and really it would be
almost as hard to find a brace of them as to fiush a pair of Dodos upon
Salisbury Plain. To be ornamental is what ladies mostly aim at
now-a-days, and few of them have any thought of trying to be useful.
As for the “heavy juveniles,” who are likewise in demand, the notice
should be more precise in stating of what age and weight these juveniles
must be. . If the fat boy in Pickwick be taken as the standard weight
required for heavy juveniles, it might, perhaps, be difficult to meet
with a young bantling, or rather, we should say, a young Banting—to
come up to it.
Then, what in wonder's name are all these people wanted “to open
on the 24th P” Is an oyster i. to be #. on that evening, and
are these actors all required to lend a hand in the prefatory arrangements?

our own venerable, W. EBOR, or C. T. CANTUAR exposed to such
frightful sufferings! To picture to, oneself a bishop on bread and
snow-water for forty-eight hours, and afterwards trudging two miles
through the sludge in open shorts and gaiters, with his shoe-
soles worn off, makes the heart bleed. Fancy. SAM Oxon in this

could almost make up our minds to such a sight, thinking of the

would be even better than SYDNEY SMITH's suggestion of burning one,
as a short way to railway reformation. It would be more, startling.
One has heard of bishops being burnt—in bloody MARY's time. But
of a bishop being starved, history contains no record. Then, what a
highly scriptural as well as salutary spectacle we should have in one of
the modern successors of the Apostles, literally without scrip or shoes,
instead of as we usually see him, with an extremely well-lined con-
yexity under his apron, and an elegant pair of pumps with silver

POLICE INTELLIGENCE.
In consequence of the new powers conferred upon themselves by the
Police, the following may be considered as a probable Police Report
for any day at the close of 1865, or in 1866, when such powers will, by
frequent use, have acquired the force of law.
DOGBERRY STREET. — SERIOUS CHARGE AGAINST A Solici-
toR.— A person of gentlemanly exterior, who gave his name as
MR. Charles Codesill, of 3, fº. Walk, Barnard's Temple, was
brought before the sitting Magistrate, charged with, creating a dis;
hº in the streels, and obstructing the l’olice in the execution of
their duty.
Wigg 263 Q deposed, that on Thursday night, he was on duty in
Oxford Street, and having nothing particular to do, was enjoying a
chat, and a few nuts, with a young female of his acquaintance who was
out to fetch the supper beer. While thus engaged, the prisoner came
up and accosted him familiarly.
The MAGISTRATE. What do you mean by accosted you familiarly
W1GG 263 Q expressed his surprise at his Worship's question. He
had been in the force ten years, and had never had the slightest doubt
thrown on his testimony. He didn't feel he was bound to answer his
Worship at all, if he didn't like.
The MAGISTRATE. Well, we will not discuss the point.
Wigg 263 Q. said he was glad to hear that, as he should have been
obliged to appeal to the head of the Police, who had recently given
orders that the Police were in no way to be annoyed by the Magistrates.
The Prisoner interrupted his, Wigg’s, conversation for the purpose of
inquiring his way to the New Road. This he considered a mere pre-
tence for getting a word with the young female and cutting him, Wigg,
out. He did not make any answer to prisoner's question. Finding
that he repeated his impertinence, he took him to the station-house and
locked him up. The Prisoner made some resistance, and witness
cautioned him that ºlins he might do, or say, would be used dead
against him at his trial.
The MAGISTRATE. It appears to me, that unless you have received
some new rules and regulations from the head of the Police, with which
I am at present unacquainted, you have somewhat exceeded the limits
of your duty.
WIGG 263 Q. observed that he was of a jealous temperament, and
couldn't bear to stand by and see any young female, as he took an
interest in, spoken to by a mere civilian under his very nose. . It was
tº: The orders issued from head-quarters were, that the
Police were not to be aggravated, or obstructed, and if so treated they
were at perfect liberty to lock up the offender. (The Policeman here
handed in for his Worship's inspection the New Revised Private Police
Code, for the use of the executive, and the assistance of the judicial
authorities.)
The MAGISTRATE having perused the document, observed that witness
could not have acted in a more humane manner than he had done. He
was sorry to see a gentleman of his, the Prisoner's, status in such a
humiliating position.
PRisoner. But your Worship will perhaps allow me to state—
The MAGISTRATE, after a reference to the Revised Police Code, said
that he really couldn't allow him to state anything of the sort. He was
sitting there to protect the public, and implicitly believe the word of the
Police. Once throw any imputation on the credit of the Civil Executive
power, and all security was at an end. He should fine him 40s. for the
assault, or one month's imprisonment.
The amount was immediately paid.
WERGES STREET.—ExtRAORDINARY CASE. FRACAS IN THE
Police CELLs.-FRANK Gosling, aged 22, clerk in a large mercantile
establishment, was placed at the bar before MR. Custos, charged with
creating a disturbance in the police cells of that Court.
The PRIsonER (addressing the Magistrate). I have been locked up
all night, Sir; they have used me very badly.
MR. Custos. Let me hear the charge.
INspector BLINK said, I was in the station-house when the Prisoner
was brought in. I entered his name on the sheet. I asked what he
was charged with. The Policeman said he’d leave that to me.
MR. Custos. What charge is entered on the sheet 2
INspector BLINK. . None at first. I ordered him to be locked up. I
thought we soon should have a ºf: against him, and I was right. He
became very violent, and wouldn't be locked ". It took three police-
men besides myself to put him into the cells. It was after, this that I
felt myself justified in entering a charge of assault against the Prisoner.
MR. Custos. But it seems to me a most extraordinary proceeding on
the part of the Police, that they— -
InspeçToR.BLINK apologised for interrupting the Magistrate, but
Fº his Worship had not seen the new rules and regulations for the
olice
MR. Custos owned that he had not.
INSPECTOR BLINK begged the Magistrate's attention to a copy, which
he now handed in. His Worship would see that he, the Inspector,
had acted according to information received.
Wol. XLVIII.-1865.
MR. Custos, aſter reading the document, said this quite altered the
case. The Inspector had acted throughout in a most cautious and
praiseworthy manner. He should like to question the officer who took
the Prisoner into custody.
Inspector regretted that the officer in question was not present. He
believed that that officer, who was a most efficient member of the force,
had taken the Prisoner into custody, more for the sake of keeping a
young and foolish man out of danger in the London streets, and to
keep his hand in professionally, than from any cause or offence given by
the Prisoner. If his Worship would again refer to the Code he would
see that it was all right.
MR. Custos said nothing could be more straightforward than the
Inspector's account of the whole affair. Young men would be young
men, but this was no excuse for thc violence of the Prisoner towards
those who were endeavouring to prove themselves his best friends and
kindest moral protectors. He should mark his sense of the Prisoner's
conduct by inflicting a fine of 10s.
The Prisoner, who appeared deeply aſfected by the worthy Magis-
º address, was then removed to the lock-up until the fine was
palu.
MR. Custos then placed in our reporter's hands the New Police
º: for the better regulation and moral improvement of the Metro-
polls :-
1. No person, or persons, under any pretence whatever, shall be out of
their domiciles after One o'clock, A.M. And any person so offending
and being unable to produce a written permission from the Chief Com-
missioner of Police, shall be at once locked up in the nearest station-
Ouse.
2. No person, or persons, shall allow a dancing, dining, musical,
supper, or any other sort of party, to continue beyond the hour of One,
A M. without first obtaining special permission from the Chief Commis-
sioner of Police. This regulation equally affects Private Residences,
Public Houses, Clubs, &c.
3. The Police have full liberty to enter any domicile whatever, at any
time that shall appear most convenient to themselves and the interests
of Public Morality. The owner, or owners, of any such domicile
refusing to give, or failing to offer, sherry and biscuits, or beer and
read and cheese, according to his, or their, position in Society’s scale,
shall be liable to fine or imprisonment at the option of the Police.
4. No charges need be entered at the moment of a Prisoner being
received into the Station-house. To avoid hasty and confused writing,
the charges of the previous night can be left until the following
morning, when they will be duly weighed and considered before entry.
For the sake of variety, no two Prisoners shall have precisely the same
charge entered against them. -
5. Any Inspector may lock up or dismiss a Prisoner at his own
option. -
6. Any officer of any division may take into custody any one he likes
or doesn’t like, without assigning a reason.
7. The truncheon shall be used after one warning.
8. The Police shall visit all private houses where no entertainment is
£ºf on, as above stated, in order to see that the candles have been
carefully extinguished, and the gas turned off, before the hour of 11 P.M.
If this is not done, the Chief Commissioner will know the reason why.
9. The Policemen stationed in the pits, galleries, or dress circles of
theatres, are hereby strictly ordered to remove any person, or persons,
j way to immoderate laughter, or tears. An officer will be sta-
tioned in every private box, to preserve decorum among its inmates.
10. Every performance at every theatre shall be finished at a quarter
to eleven punctually. The curtain will be in the charge of two officers,
who will drop it at that hour, no matter what act or what scene the
piece may have reached. - - - - -
ll. A Magistrate must place implicit faith in the statements of any
Constable, who in return will assist the Magistrate on every possible
Occasion.

PUBLICATION RECEIVED FOR REVIEW.
A Treatise on Artificial Teeth. By —, Surgeon Dentist.
This work has been sent to Mr. Punch and to most of his young
men, with commendable attention, at various dates during some years
past. We are sure that we are much obliged to the sender, for the
ittle book is very neatly bound, and we, immediately on receiving it,
take a sharp knife, cut away all the valuable letter-press (which
makes exceedingly good spills for cigars, though as to its other merits
we have not the ſaintest idea) leaving a slight margin, and then we
gum notes, or other papers which, we wish to preserve, between his
pretty covers. As we are “nothing if not critical,” we must just
observe that the writer would much oblige us by making the work a
little larger in form, that is, more like an octavo, as though his cover
holds small notes very well, the ordinary size extends beyond the edges;
With this slight hint to the author, we discharge our pleasant duty of
noticing his work.

and burlesques. He says “the sight of little ones toddling about
(some of them barely able to do so) plastered and painted, ex-
posed to the glare of foot-lights and side-lights, at an hour when
they ought all to be soundly sleeping, gave” him “anything but
pleasure.” He remarks that “the occupation was, in every respect, as
unhealthy as it could be,” and that “it is past hope that anything ſike
the bloom of childhood could survive it.” The conduct of the parents
of the children in letting them out, of the Manager in exhibiting them,
and of the spectators who, witnessed their exposure with delight, he
calls “disgusting.” I don’t know any epithet, more applicable. But
were the children's parents to blame ad they any parents? Did
they not come from workhouses—some of the most cruelly conducted
of those institutions? Nay, surely, they had no parents, nor any
guardians, except a Board of Guardians.
However, there must, no doubt, be little goblins in pantomimes and
burlesques; but, Sir, would not monkeys do for these? Could not an
arrangement be made with the Zoological Society on the one hand, and
the Italians who educate PROFEssoR Huxley's distant relatives, on the
other? Perhaps, the Act for, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
would not be held to forbid this substitution of monkeys for children.
If so, the difficulty might be met with respect to imps; but, then how
would the Manager manage for little angels? Sir, I would suggest
that monkeys might be made to serve for angels too. As it is, the
children are, as “A Childless Bachelor” says, plastered and painted.
Now, Mr. Punch, *} should not monkeys be plastered and painted to
the same purpose f Is there not an “artiste,” calling herself MADAME
Esther, or some such name, who professes to make ladies, of any age,
features, or complexion, “beautiful for ever” by enamelling their faces
If she can do that, she can give a facing of beauty to a gorilla or a
baboon, Why not, as well as to a wrinkled JEZEBELP . If she can by
cosmetic stucco, convert an . into a full-grown angel, of course she
can, by the same means, transform a smaller monkey into a cherub or a
tombstone angel... Her figures for improving faces are said to be rather
high, but surely this consideration would not prevent an enterprising
and humane Manager from, having the place of children on the stage at
midnight supplied by monkeys made “beautiful for ever.”, Whatever
you may think of “Man’s place in Nature,” you will no doubt allow
that the place of a child in a pantomime had much better be filled by
one of the Simiae, if not by so big a brute as SIMIA SATYRUs.

MR. PUNCH's HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.
CHAP. VII.--THE LOW COMEDIAN.
IR,-Yours is indeed an en-
viable function in the
theatre. You are the per-
sonification of mirth, the
incarnation of laughter—
a broad-grin in flesh and
blood. There is nothing
John BULL–who still, as
in the days of FROIssart,

is left s'amuser—loves so
much as º laughs
hº out of him; and
he more irresistible the
pressure applied for the
purpose, the better he loves
the process, and the force-
pump-that is, the low
comedian.
Remember, therefore, that
it is, first and foremost, your
business to get laughs; and
get them.
Do not listen, to those
who tell you that it is your
part to represent the hu-
morous side of character,
with all its effects of light
and shade. That may be
the business of the Actor
a funny mannerism of your own, borrow that
of the low comedian in vogue. In time people
may come to think you as funny as he is.
The same exclusive eye to comicality which
should govern your manner in all your parts,
should preside over your dress id make-up.
Let both be such as to provoke the involun-
tary exclamation, “What a Guy " the mo-
ment you *i;
I need hardly say that probability, or , the
usages of real life should not be considered for
a moment in such matters as dress, manners, or
make-up. Do not countenance the profoundly
mistaken notion, that the fun may be in the part
and not the Actor, and that all you have to do
is to develop the Author's conception.
his would go far to render useless all your
cherished mannerisms, tricks of make-up and
dress, gags, and indeed the whole of your ready-
made arsenal of fun; and, throw you, instead
on the dull resources of first finding out, and
then embodying, the humour of another man.
Always insist on ºn', “funny things” or
“jokes” in your part. Do not be put off—as I
have often seen Authors attempt to fob off low
comedians-by the assurance that the part is
humorous in itself, and does not require “jokes”
to make it so. You have a right to see your
“laughs” clear before you risk your reputation.
If the Author persist in refusing you straw to
make your bricks with, in the º of palpable
“laughs,” let his part play itself, and let him
see what comes of his “humorous conception.”
The chances are he will never again attempt
Always
matter what the situation, emotion, or action, it is the Author's business to find you in laughs;
and if he fails, you must make them.
You need not be too particular about your means. John BULL, if he is kept laughing, is
not disposed to ask questions as to the taste, propriety, sense, or meaning of what tickles him.
See how safe he makes his

laughs; and yet how simple and naive the means he uses!
Cultivate a manner of your own—the more unlike real life the better. A peculiar voice,
gait, grin, or chuckle, will make you known the moment you appear, and often secure
you a round of laughter before you open your mouth. Such a jocose mannerism, marking,
and familiar relations with the public, may be compared to the
as it does, your friendly
Clown’s “Here we are!” in the Pantomime, which never misses fire.
always play parts, meant, at least, to be funny, the audience will in time come to associate
our mannerism with ſun, and to laugh at it, as if it really were fun. In the absence of real
umour or comicality in or on your part, this is a great advantage. If you cannot invent
DELATED JURYMEN.
(To the RIGHT Hon. LoRD WESTBURY.)
MAY it please |. Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury are persons on
whose behalf I beg to claim your Lordship's attention. wish to
direct it, my Lord, to the following passage from the report of the late
murder trial at the Old Bailey:—
“This closed the case for the Prosecution, and Mr. BEST, the Prisoner's Counsel,
having applied to postpone his defence until this (Thursday) morning, the Court
adjourned, and the jury, according to custom in such cases, were taken to the
London Coffee House to stay overnight.”
Now, my Lord, as a man, does not your Lordship feel that, this prac:
tice of locking ". gentlemen of the jury all night together is brutal and
disgusting, as a law-reformer do3. not think it ought to be abolished,
jº. Load CHANCELLOR, could you not get the Legislature to abolish
it? Is there the shadow of a reason for persisting in it, except the
apprehension that, jurymen, if they were allowed to go home, would be
liable to be intimidated, and to have their minds influenced by their
wives and other persons? -
My Lord, are British jurymen, of all people in the world, particularl
susceptible of intimidation or undue influence? I believe the Frenc
are not such brutes and fools as to lock up jurymen as ours are locked
up in England. Yet surely the decisions of French juries are not in
general more contrary to law and evidence than those of our own.
Suppose LoRD SHAFTESBURY, were to fight a duel and have the
misfortune to shoot somebody, he would, of course, be tried by his
peers. He would be put on his trial before your Lordships. Then, if
the noble Earl's case should happen to last over a day,...would your

thus to impose on your good-nature.
The low comedian, like every other con-
scientious artist following a line of business, will
have to resist the plausible reasoning of those
who hold up life as the mirror in which he is
constantly to look, to find the true features of his
Art. He will be told that as tears and smiles
lie close together, and often on the same faces
in life, so they should on the stage. Let him
turn a deaf ear to such sophisms, and cultivate
the more profitable art of forcing broad-grins
and guffaws. His study must not be life, but
laughter; his object not to depict character from
the ludicrous side, but to make the public laugh.
If he follow any other guiding ſº he

I leave your Lordship to follow out the conclusion to which every
sane person must arrive by parity of reasoning, and remain,

P.S. In strict law, I believe, jurors retiring for the night are subject
to be kept without fire or candié, but custom and gas, between them,
have repealed this senseless barbarity. Yet justice does not miscarry
from the enlightenment and warming of jurymen. No more, perhaps,
would it if gentlemen of the jury were treated as gentlemen, and, when
|. duties are interrupted by night, suffered to go home to their
aules.
Doctor Abraham Lincoln.
AMONG the American news we notice a statement that:-
“PREsident LINcolN has been made an LL.D. by the College of New Jersey."
LL.D. P. PRESIDENT LIN colN, after dealing as he has dealt with the
laws and constitution of the United States, made Doctor of Laws by
the College of New Jersey ! Who ever could have thought that learned
body capable of such a stroke of irony ? The military government
exercised by MR. LINcoLN will perhaps procure from some other equally
º º complimentary body the honorary degree of Doctor of
Civil Law.
The Great Mistletoe Question.
I can’t say on the oak if the mistletoe shoot,
As on apple, pear, ash, its green clusters we see ;
But I know it thrives longest and bears sweetest fruit,
(Witness Punch's own lips), on the Home Christmas tree.

HOMOEOPATHY IN THE WORKEIOUSE.
. The proverb says that Union is strength, but the Poor Law Union
is synonymous with weakness. Weak broth, and weak tea, and weak
stimulants of all sorts are given in the workhouse, and the º who
reside there are generally weak people. There are weak minds too
among them, and among those who have the charge of them, who in
very many instances are weak enough to fancy that they can get work
done without #."; proper º for it. For example, at the Holborn
Union the medical man is paid a hundred pounds a-year for attending
on an average one hundred and twenty patients, forty of whom he is
required to visit every day; while the medicine he dispenses costs him
twenty pounds a year, or a halfpenny per diem for each one of his
patients. With such homoeopathic pay for it, one wonders that the
treatment is not also homoeopathic: for globules are of course far
cheaper than black doses, and if through want of proper physic a patient
happens to die, there will be one the less to visit, and so the less work
for the Doctor.
As a rule, our workhouse Surgeons are shamefully ill-paid, and when
a death occurs through insufficient—that is, homoeopathic-treatment,
one can hardly be surprised at it. The charge of manslaughter in such
case should be brought against the Guardians rather than the Doctor
for they stint him, in the salary out of which he buys his drugs, an
they stint him in the diet he prescribes for his poor patients. But the
workhouse, it is said, must perforce be made repulsive, and even in the
sick room its inmates must be roughly treated. Paupers, we are told
soon learn the trick of shamming ill, that they may escape work an
get a little extra diet. Yet Doctors usually are sharp enough to see
through such imposture, and, for the sake of their own interests, they
allow none on the sick list but those who are really ailing. For these
humanity demands that good treatment be procured, and good treat-
ment can hardly be obtained without good pay for it. At present

INFALLIBILITY AND LEGITIMACY.
The Bishop of BEAuvais has addressed to the clergy of his diocese
a circular on the Pope's Encyclical; which seems like buttering bacon.
He expresses the hope that, with time and patience, the present clampur
against the Papal edict will cease, and that the people will end by under-
standing that “the Holy Church, the great civiliser of the world, has
never been, and can never be, the enemy of true civilisation and of legi-
timate progress.”
If the people end as Popery would have them end, they will no doubt
end in understanding very clearly that the Church meant by the Bishop
of BEAUVAIs is by no means the enemy, but the very, intimate friend,
of legitimate progress. They will end in being a people no longer free
to choose †. own rulers, which legitimate progress will render them
once more unable to do. According to the º just propounded
by the Sovereign Pontiff, legitimate progress is the progress of legiti-
mate monarchy, and means, in France, political retrogression, and the
restoration of the Bourbons. But, alas for Infallibility and PIUs the
INTH ! how came Pius The Seventh to crown the First NAPOLEON ?
Before launching his Encyclical to smash Victor-EMMANUEL, the
NINTH PIUs might, however, have taken the precaution to crown
NAPOLEON THE Third.

It is no uncommon thing for free, ardent spirits, in the hey-day of

Where, Sir? Why, in the habits, manners, and customs observed in

After this, the conversation can flow pleasantly and freely; for after
such an entrance there can be no doubt about your being able to make
yourself perfectly at home, and it offers in itself a subject for dis-
cussion.
Having exhausted the themes of health, weather, parties, interesting
family statistics, and the seasonable amusements, you will all come to
an awkward standstill, and the visitor will say—giving a hasty glance

A PLEASANT SITUATION.
PITY the poor farmers, kind and charitable reader. Their pockets
: be i. empty, else we surely should not see such an advertise-
ment, as this :-
A GOVERNESS WANTED, in a farmhouse, to instruct eight pupils
(mostly boys) in the usual branches of education, with French, good music
and arithmetic. None need apply but those who have been engaged in schools, and
have good references. Salary 20 guineas. Address, &c.
The terms offered in this farmhouse really are in-farmous. Twenty
guineas a year for the instruction of eight pupils! This is precisely at the
rate of two pounds twelve and sixpence each. How many branches of
education may be deemed to be the “usual” ones, the governess who
is wanted is at liberty to guess. We dare say they comprise English
German, Greek, and Latin; #". and history; astronomy and
botany; drawing, .. and deportment, with Hebrew, Sanscrit,
and the uses of the dumb-bells, and the globes. For twenty guineas
too, the governess in this farmhouse must teach figures, French an
fugues, and will doubtless be required to give a lesson now and then in
conchology or chemistry to fill up her spare time. How many hours a
day will be required to teach eight pupils some slight smattering of all
this we will not stop to think. But we may just make the reflection
that the governess who occupies this farmhouse, situation would
certainly have. §: more wages and less work if she had luckily gone out
as a lady's maid or cook.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
|MAGINARY BIOGRAPHY.
COCKER.
It would be a suitable problem for the Statistical Society to solve
the question, how many of the adult population of Great Britain and
her colonial dependencies pass their lives without using the formula,
“According to Cock ER.”
And yet so little is known of the man whose name is on every one’s
lips, º figures in books innumerable, that his life, which deserves
to be written in numbers, may be summed up in a paragraph.
Conscious of the importance of the subject, Mr. Punch directed one
of his private secretaries to apply to a series of distinguished per-
sonages who, by their tastes sº pursuits, were thought qualified to be
MR. Cockek's Biographer; but without success.
We epitomise a few of their answers:—
The CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer. (N.B. Figures of speech
omitted.) Busy concocting his annual Easter offering to the nation. Not
a fraction of his time unemployed. Still will do his best, but it would be
a great tax upon him. #. “tale of Troy” has nothing to do with
weights and measures. (The notion of taxing GLADSTONE was almost
irresistible; but we mastered the temptation, and set his mind at rest
by telegraphing to excuse him.) -
MR. BABBAGE. Not sufficiently recovered from the organic disease
by which he has long been ground down. Time, he hopes, will put a
stop to it. The Calculating Machine at our service. (The latter part
of the note irrelevant, suggesting, as it does, Bass's Straits as a proper
settlement for street musicians.)
Bishop Colexso. Total refusal. Deaf as an adder to all our
entreaties. Tired of division. Writes to us on his Natal day.
MR. BANTING Wººl with on account of what he had done for
figures), Pants to be of use, but not arithmetician enough to undertake
the task. Only cares for reduction and proportion. Signs himself
“Yours through thick and thin.” - -
Davenport BROTHERs. Too busy raising the wind to raise T.
Cocker, to be his own accountant.
And so on, not to multiply examples, ad infinitum.
Nothing remained, therefore, but to collect materials for a life of
Cocken from the books of the bank of England (they would not allow
a single note to be taken), the Accountant-General, the Institute of
Actuaries, &c., that the national debt of gratitude to its great arithme-
tician might be at length discharged.
But the product of these researches was not commensurate with the
labour., The sum total was but little. A letter (in cipher) was dis:
covered in a cupboard in the Bank parlour, giving a few particulars of
CockeR’s early years. It will not surprise his admirers to hear that
he “lisped in numbers;” and that as soon as he could walk, with the
help of the chairs, he showed a remarkable fondness for “tables.”
The schoolboy is brought distinctly before us. The studious lad
squaring his roots, while his ºf companions are squaring their
fists; deep in trigonometry, and deaf to the pop-guns going off on all
sides of him; preferring alligation to the charms of alley taws; and
giving up hare and hounds for tare and tret. Some lines of his are
mentioned which we are glad to have in their original dress, as they
had become hopelessly corrupted :-
“Multiplication
Bringa elation :
Division makes me glad ;
The rule of three,
It comforts me ;
And Practice suits this lad.”
The letter is from a correspondent at Cockermouth, but the date is
wanting; and as there was no census at the period when Cocker is
sup osed to have been born, and no one is able to insense us as to the
probable year of his birth, it is impossible to say when so important a
unit was added to the ſº or whether he was vaccinated, and to
what political party his parents belonged. The same uncertainty
exists as to his calling or profession. Some assert that he was
a factor, others describe him as being a schoolmaster: all agree that he
was a man of singular modesty, too prone to hide his light under a
bushel, and too indifferent to his own interest, though of a calculating
turn, to take care of number one. Give him an inch and he will take
an ell, was the last proverb that could be applied to unobtrusive
THoMAs Cocker. Why he led a secluded life for several years is not
apparent, unless we have a key to the mystery in the arithmetic he is
supposed to have been then compiling. There is less obscurity about
his domestic life. It was not a happy one. The truth must be told:
in his own house Cocker was a mere cipher. His first wife was a lady
of good extraction, being the daughter of a dentist, of an old but
decayed family. Somewhat stumpy in figure, she had acerbities of
temper so trying, that her husband did not hesitate to speak of her
(when out of hearing) as a cockatrice. Indeed, he confessed that she
would have driven him to drink, but that his scruples would not let
him take a dram. She was succeeded by the widow of a watchmaker,
who had died of tic-douloureux; one of those methodical persons in
whose house everything goes on like clockwork. A plain-featured
woman, she brought CockeR rather a handsome fortune. So much so,
that in his joking way, he would sºy of her, that if she was ill-favoured,
she had “a compensating balance” at the bank. , Poor fellow it was
a balance of power which she used so mercilessly, that he often deplored
bartering his happiness for it.
“I used to sigh for her,” he would cast up his eyes, and say, “but
now I sigh for myself”, The exchange to freedom came at last, and
Cocker never risked his liberty again, convinced that the rule of
three would be more than he could bear. Ahead of the times in which
he lived, he held that a decimal coinage would be a sovereign remedy
for many of our. monetary perplexities, but that it was ten to one
against its adoption. After carefully weighing and balancing the argu:
ments advanced, by the wiseacres who were in league, against all
change, and could see neither rhyme nor reason in the metrical system
he laughed to scorn, their prediction that if applied to weights and
measures, it must lead to an insurrection, or at least involve a strike.
Fond as he was of book-keeping, he does not seem to have amassed
a library, and the only indication of any sporting tastes to be traced in
his life is the interest he took in Le(d)ger entries. A lover of SHAK-
SPEARE, he preferred Measure for Measure to all the other plays.

JOHN BULL'S SISTERS.
No Popery can be objected to the ladies undermentioned in an
extract from the Times:–
“ENGLIsh Sisters of Chanity.—The Sisters of St. Peter's Home and Sisterhood
27, Brompton Square, have for some years been actively engaged, with the entire
sanction of the Bishop or LoNDon, in visiting the sick and relieving the poor in all
parts of the metropolis. On Wednesday, the 23rd ult, º opened a Mission House,
at 10, Frederick Road, Walworth, to carry out their charitable purposes in the
district of St. Paul's, Lorrimore Square."
The entire sanction, not only of the Bishop of London, but even of
Exeter Hall, would naturally be given to the occupation of visiting the
sick, and affording relief to the poor. Such employment cannot be
supposed to have any special relation to the Seven Hills, and does not
at all connect the ladies who are engaged in it with any lady in Babylon
and scarlet. ...The fact that the charity which they practise is a cardinal
virtue, is quite consistent with their entire independence of CARDINAL
WISEMAN; for, otherwise, it would have only the partial, and not the
entire, sanction of the Bishop of LoNDoN, who, of course, would limit
his sanction of charity administered under the auspices of his Eminence, to
the distribution of coals, blankets, clothes, victuals, and drink, and other
corporeal matters. Exeter Hall, therefore, need not fear that whilst
the English Sisters of Charity distribute bodily necessaries, they also
distribute any spiritual superfluities, their spiritual ministrations ex-
tending to nothing worse than good brandy, rum, and gin, too needful
in many cases.
This sort, of practical Christianity cannot be carried on without
money; without which there is very little good to be done, how much
soever there may be wished, in this world, and benevolence is nearly
all talk and sentiment. But the Sisters depend entirely on voluntary
contributions, and, as the Times says:–
"They therefore make an appeal for assistance to those charitable persons who
desire to relieve the miseries of London, but who are unable themselves to search
out the º needy and deserving. Contributions of money, food, or clothing will
be thankfully, received at the Mission House, or by the Rev. John Gond, the
incumbent of the district.”
There are plenty of people who enjoy the unspeakable blessing of an
ample and certain income, derived from capital invested in Government
securities, or freehold land, or other safe property. These people must,
all but those who have a * dreadful skeleton in their cupboards, be so
happy, that any increase of , their happiness can be hardly possible.
They can amuse and enjoy themselves every day of their lives without
any necessity to take thought for the morrow, or any day thereaſter,
but the final one. . Perhaps anything which would tend to reassure
them about that, might add to even their extreme felicity. If there is
any such thing which they can do, it is to be done, for example, by
sending as much aid as they can afford in money or kind to the Sisters
of Charity, or MR. GoING,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE. L.
CHAP. VIII.--THE FIRST OLD MAN.
HE Actor who º this line
sº of business should be cau-
# tioned against putting up
f with an inferior part, be.
cause it happens to be the
best Old Man in the piece.
There is, or ought to be, a
“second old man” in every
properly constituted com-
pany, whose business it is
to play all the old men's
parts you do not think good
enough for you.
The French rule is, that
the first old man is bound
to take the best old man's
Pºrt in every piece acted.
The melancholy conse-
quence of this tyrannical
rule is, that in France we
often see excellent actors of
old men going on for parts
of a few lengths, figuring
perhaps only in a single
scene, and yet-such is the
effect of that submission to
central authority which per-
meates everything in that
country, from the Tuileries
to the smallest suburban theatre-dressed and made up as carefully for
such a part, and taking just as much
really worth playing. ...F. to say
protest against this abuse of talent, b
course. - - - -
Authors, I need hardly say, having once been conceded to in this way
will expect, and even insist upon the sacrifice, unless firmly met at the
outset. It will be a sad day for the English stage, when we come to see
pieces cast, not, with reference to the Actor's position, but with an
exclusive regard to effective representation. -
I introduce these remarks, apropos of the “first old man,” because
there is no other line of business in which there is such a disposition
among Authors and Managers to thrust second-best business on leading
shoulders, the “old man” being rarely the chief figure in the picture,
and it being, of course, the object of these persons to strengthen the
cast, without any regard to the Actor's feelings. - - -
In fitting yourself to play old §". not lose your time in studyin
the bewildering varieties of age which you will see about you. To suc
a study there would be no end, and the result of it wºul; merely be a
reflection of what everybody can see without paying for it. . Instead of
thus distracting and distressing yourself, determine, early, what eminent
Actor of old men, you will imitate, and study his manner, make up,
looks, gestures and peculiarities.
You will find helps to such study among the conscientious preservers
of stage tradition in theatrical clubs, Bow Street taverns, and Covent
Garden cigar-divans, as well as among the old actors or hangers-on of
country theatres, among whom a wealth of such traditionary lore is
still hoarded. Books of biography and theatrical prints will also do
much for you; and few places of theatrical resort but boast of an
imitator, who will be still able to give you a picture of Dowton, or
flºº, FARREN or STRICKLAND, as well as of the favourites of the
out.
Having thus chosen your model, according to your taste, or physique,
stick to it. If you have a tall slender figure, with a turn for the quiet
and gentlemanlike, can make up clean, and afford a good modern
wardrobe, the late MR. W. FARREN will, of course, be your model.
You will carefully cultivate the trick of his thin, high voice, his gentle-
manlike walk, his little chuckle, the delicate action of his hand. One
difficulty in imitating this Actor arises from the subtlety of his imperso;
nations and his great economy of resources, in which he apprºached
dangerously near the French ideal. It is sadly to be feared that he
wasted much time in the observation of life, and was refined to a
dangerous degree. But we need not dwell on these blemishes, in speak-
ing of one, who, in spite of such faults, was still an artist, Besides, as
i. have only, to copy his § you will escape all the labour he
e audience do not indignantly
ut take it quite as a matter of
stowed in selecting his ori from life; and any over-refinement,
or under colouring with which he may have been chargeable,
of course, remove in your copy.
If you are of a more burly person, with a fuller voice, and, a more
blunt and jovial turn of humour, approaching to the true John Bull
ºf; you will avoid FARREN, and imitate BARTLEY.

t
the traditions of him, it is to be feared, are waxing rather, faint,
Luckily, STRICKLAND is still completely within living memory, and good
imitations of him may still be easily met with, and may replace those of
Dowton. W. BENNETT may also be referred to, as, in some points
the continuer down to our times of the hard and jerky school of
Fawcett,
You will, of course, study the peculiarities of dress most affected by
your model.
It is to be feared that in no line of business is the modern itch for
realism and dangerous imitation of actual life, making more rapid and
visible strides than in the “old men.”. The low-crowned, broad-
brimmed hat, so long invariably worn by the elderly merchant, banker,
or country gentleman, is disappearing... Neck-cloths are diminishing in
volume, length of ends, and eccentricity of tie. The long-established
.# are seriously threatened. The loyal adhesion to the
costume of the º ſº. of GEORE THE Third's reign, which was
formerly expected of all old men, is now broken without apology on the
actor's part, or, protest on that of the public. Top-boots are becoming
as rare in the theatre as in real life; and even the traditional bailiff, if
ever introduced, is represented in a common, paletot, trousers, and
high-lows, instead of the square-cut, broad-lapelled coat, red waistcoat,
breeches, and mahogany tops, which J. belong to the character.
The old man of the stage is, indeed, outwardly in danger of sinking
down into a copy of the old man of real life; but, happily, the tradition
of the theatre preserves those venerable traits of stage manners, voice,
walk, action, which abundantly distinguish the old man of the playhouse
from the old man of society, even though their husks approximate.
Thanks to it, the stage did man, whatever he looks } e, has only to
º and move (in nine cases out of ten), for us to feel that in this line
of business “realism,” if it have won the outworks, has not yet pene-
trated to the heart of the citadel.
The traditional “make-up” of the old man helps to give him this
symbolical character.
One has heard absurd stories of the length of time and elaborate study
employed by French actors of old men in colouring and making up their
ces, as though the Actor's countenance was a canvas, on which a
particular face had to be painted,
Our theatre dispenses with this minute, and slavish labour. Every
Actor of old men can acquire in a few nights' observation and practice
the art of putting on the recognised wrinkles and crows'-feet which
belong to this line of business. .
Having mastered these, he will take as much care to avoid comparison
of his own face with those of living old men as Don Quirote did to avoid
putting his second vizor to test of sword-stroke, aſter having ruined the
first by a rash trial-blow.
Such comparison would be sure to confuse, and might eyen º you
out of conceit with yourself—a thing carefully to be avoided by every
Actor, and especially º the Actor of old men, as he is obliged, unfor.
tunately, to renounce the hope of looking lovely, and cannot go in for

TheRE are two points on which the generality of Scotchmen are as
daft as they are canny in all other respects. They labour under a delu.
sion with regard to Sunday, which they call the Sabbath, and entertain
an insane objection, to instrumental church music, whence they name an
organ “akist ful o' whistles.” Aweel, but Sunday trains, in modera-
tion, run through the Laud, o' Cakes; and the subjoined extract, from
the Scotsman, is evidence of a Scottish organ movement, which is also
extending therein, and must be acknowledged to be a movement in the
right direction:-
“With regard to the fitting up of an organ in the new church at Ayr, a meeting
was held on Thursday evening, when it appeared that 261 members of the church
were in favour of the introduction of an organ, 73 were against, and about 100 were
neutral. After some discussion, the Committee, with the view of obtaining complete
harmony, resolved to delay further action in the matter until after the next meeting
of the General Assembly."
This is good, as far as it goes, but what follows is better:—
“Anderston, new church, Glasgow, was opened on Sunday for public worship.
. . . . . An excellent organ has been fitted up in the building, and was used during
service on Sunday, MR. LAMBETH acting as organist. A choir, under the superin-
tendence of MR. Stextbridge RAY, has also been formed in connection with the
congregation."
ln Anderston new church, Glasgow, the establishment of an organ
has not only been proposed, but actually effected. Now, so it should
be in the new church at Ayr, and so it must be if the Committee of that
church are to accomplish the end which they proposed in delaying
further action in that matter. Scotchmen understand the force of
words, and will understand us when we tell them, that the immediate
#. up of an organ is the best method of obtaining complete
armony.

CHRONOLOGY AND CHARITY.
The very best of Almanacks of course is Punch's Almanack, which,
as everybody knows, is indispensable to everybody, and which nobody
who is anybody, can fail, therefore, to possess. Next to this may be
commended the Dramatic Almanack, which, with other highly inter-
esting intelligence, contains a fair amount of theatrical astrology, an
tells the rising and the setting of several stage-stars. It gives a date also
to numerous theatrical events which are worthy to be borne in mind
such as the original invention of the butter-slide in pantomimes, and
the first introduction of the hot poker by the Clown. All lovers of the
theatre should buy this little Almanack, not merely because it is worth
the sixpence that it costs, but because the profits of its sale are added
to the funds of the Royal Dramatic College, a charity which well
deserves whatever is subscribed to it. Any dweller in Stoke-Pogis or
Stickton-in-the-Mud, who may find the local bookseller without a copy
of the work, had better write to MR. Anson, of the Adelphi Theatre,
and enclose a five-pound note for the benefit of the College, with a
request that MR. Anson, who is the author of the Almanack, should
just enclose a copy of it when, as treasurer of the College, he forwards
a receipt.

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.
CHAP. IX. —THE LADIES.
LAs I approach this
delicate part of my
subject with fear and
trembling. The idea
of any man, even
Mr. Punch, putting
the ladies up to any-
thing in the way of
acting ! All the
world is a stage.
SHAKSPEARE was
quite right if he had
stopped there, or
gone on to say “and
all the women merely
players.” But he
was wrong when he
included all the men
in the same pro-
fession. The Lords
of the Creation are
often utterly inca-
able of even the
owest “general
utility”—cannot be
trusted to “go on
with a message,” or
to º creditably
- in the chorus, or
* amon
-
the supers.
But there never yet
- was woman but she
was an actress. Unluckily, there are so many stages open to them, and such splendid rewards tempting
them away from “the boards,” technically so called, that the theatre gets by no means its fair share of
the enormous sum total of histrionic genius distributed among the softer and sweeter sex, whose mission
it is to wind the stubborner and stupider sex round their fingers.
Perhaps it is this very excess of acting-power that makes many of our actresses-charming, fascinating
irresistible as we know they are off the stage—disposed to be careless about their strictly profession
performances.
How can a Syren, who is acting every moment of her waking life out, of the theatre, be expected to
show unflagging spirit and sustained energy “before, the float” as well? ... She is often, in fact, taking
her rest in the presence of the public. They are not her true audience. It is not till she puts off her
stage-clothes that she will really assume her part, and it is then we should see her, to judge what a
great creature she really is.
That is at once the best and the worst of female acting. It is, as a rule, so terribly real. A true
woman wants to play her part in actual life, and is apt to undervalue the mimic world of the stage.
But my business just now is only with her as a creature of that element. -
I only introduce this tribute to her as an actress on a different scene, and in the more serious, if often
more artificial, drama of real life, to show that I perfectly understand how small a part of the actress
we should ever expect to see upon the boards of the theatre. -
Two lines are open to the actress—I mean, in acting before the public. The one leads to bril-
liant establishments, splendid presents, fine clothes, jewels, carriages, the popular incense of the crowd,
and the more delicious worship of private adoration; the other to the comparatively meagre and barren
triumphs of the artist, the esteem of that self-satisfied class of people known, to themselves, at least
as “the judicious few,” the admiration of the units who set up for judges in matters of taste and
fine art. Such fame as they can award by no means implies an accompaniment of solid pudding.
That is oftener to be found by following the other road. - -
If you take one of these lines, your exclusive object of consideration in acting—whatever your line of
business—will be yourself, and your audience in its relation to yourself.
If you take the other, you will have to think almost exclusively of your part.
I need hardly say which of these two courses at once commends itself to the intelligent actress, who
has charms of face or figure, or arts of attraction and secrets of coquetry, which are often so much
more potent than mere beauty. She will, of course, think of herself and her audience first and most, and
of her part last and least.
Remember that it is impossible to follow the two lines at once, and that having committed yourself
to the one, you must frankly renounce the other.
You will see, at once, the impolicy of distressing yourself by painful efforts to master the meaning of
the words you, have to deliver, or by an exhausting identification of yourself with the passion or
emotion of your part. . . -
Stage-art so conceived, is not only long, but infinitely laborious and fatiguing. It implies an employ;
ment of your beauty, grace, and intelligence in the interest of egotistic authors, grasping managers, and
an ungrateful public. -
You will constantly have to sacrifice considerations of costume, complexion, attitude; and cannot hope
to maintain that calmness and self-command which are essential to the proper display of personal charms,
and the advantageous direction of the arts of feminine fascination. All this, I need hardly point out,
is, against your, obvious interests as woman and actress, in the higher sense of the word, which
takes in more than the theatre... I know few sadder sights—happily, they are not common--than a
oung actress carried away by the illusions of what she thinks High Art, studying hard at home;
in the theatre, attentive at readings, docile and regular at rehearsals, allowing herself to be schooled
by authors, and ordered about by stage-managers, at night, throwing herself passionately into her
part, even to the forgetting of herself
in her character, never thinking how
her face or figure looks, or her voice
sounds, but striving only to be the
person, under whose name she figures
in the cast.
I can conceive no life of more
continued self-sacrifice, no more wil-
ful abnegation of ninety and nine gra-
tifications of woman's nature to the
hundredth, a duty done, and at the
best a mere artistic triumph, to
rewarded by a little barren praise,
which, perhaps, she hardly hears—for
even the critics, as a rule, are too
merciful to encourage such deplorable
infatuations;–and a paltry salary,
hardly enough to keep a decent roof
over her head, and certainly insuf-
ficient to find her in clothes which
any self-respecting woman can find
pleasure in wearing. -
It is perhaps hardly, necessary to
caution you, against taking the line
which involves these fatal conse-
quences. You will, of course, think
of yourself and the audience, and leave
the part to take care of itself.
Following this general direction,
you will always ask yourself, first,
when a part is cast you, what is the
prettiest dress you can wear in it?
There is no . | *...* being
appropriate, provided it display your
face and figure to advantage, but this
it must do, and if appropriateness is
to be sacrificed to appearance, you will,
of course, sacrifice it, supposing the
choice of costume to be left to your-
self. If the management find your
dresses, take care to show them that
the one condition of your making the
public in love with you—which, after
all, is bringing grist to their mill as
well as yours, is that you shall be in
love with yourself, which, of course,
you cannot be expected to be in a
dress you don't like.
Of course you will master the indis.
pensable arts of the bones and banjo;
laying, and nigger singing and
ancing. These make up so much of
the humour of modern burlesque-
the best field for the diº of femi-
nine arts and graces — that without
them you will find yourself sadly ham-
pered at every stage of your career.
Cultivate the seductive resources of
affectation. It is all nonsense to say
men dislike them. They don't. . .
Acquire the most provocative tricks
of attitude, those I mean which are
calculated to bring out your best
points of face and figure. -
Lay in a battery of provocative
looks, saucy or languid as may suit
your style. - - -
Train your voice to be luscious, or
plaintive, or smart and brazen, accord;
ing to the line of business nature and
reflection dictate to you. Even the
most “mannish” vocabulary of slang
and fastness may be made irresistible
in a rosy young mouth.
If you are §."; these matters will
come easy, but it is when you are
plain, that you may best show your
powers.
The P. woman may acquire the
trick of fascination. If she can once
persuade herself she is pretty, there
are always ways and means of making
the public believe it too.

management, if possible, though “a swell” out of the theatre may also
be found highly useful. It will be his duty to espouse your quarrels,
keep down your rivals, and generally look after your interests.
The best thing you can do, for this purpose, is to ſº the Manager's
head under your slipper. By this means you will become, in fact,
Manager; and the poor creature, who bears the title, will be only your
“minister with a portfolio.” - -
When you have got your Manager in this position, have no mercy
upon him. The more tyrannical you are, the more pliant you will find
Im.
This is far better than *...* Manager yourself in name as well as
in fact. You will have no risk, no responsibility, and all the real
power.
Having attained this point, your career ought to be easy, by atten-
tion to a few simple rules.
Be careful not to give a chance to any woman who can possibly
become your rival.
Indeed it may be as well to say, do not give a chance to any of your
se; as it is impossible to say in what woman a rival may not crop up.
To this end take care that no other actress in the theatre has a good
part, on any pretext.
Acquire the control of the ladies' wardrobe, and see that all the
other women are dressed as unbecomingly as possible.
If you properly use your female arts, you may retain an empire once
tºº, whether over your Manager or your public, for an indefinite
lme.
Remember, that no actress who respects herself and understands her
business, ever grows old. NINoN DE L'ENclos charmed at eighty,
and MADEMOISELLE MARs left the stage at sixty, in the part she made
her début in a girl of sixteen.
You will, therefore, go on playing the parts you began with to the end
of your career.
As supplementary secrets of success, you will early study the arts of
advertising and puffery.
ou have a male relative available for this purpose, he may find
usefu º in superintending the “poster” department.
You will of course cultivate amicable and confidential relations with
the critics. However inaccessible to venal influences of the vulgar and
obvious kind, few men can resist the flatteries and attentions of a clever
woman, and nobody can object to your keeping open house for those
who are kind enough to sit in judgment on your performances.
You will take care at all times to have intelligent friends in front, a

LUCKY DREAMS.
To dream of nothing is lucky. -
To dream that you have written all MR. TUPPER's works (and on waking to find
you haven't) is very lucky. - - -
To dream, only to dream, that you’ve committed a capital crime, is lucky—for
gow.
UNLUCKY DREAMS.
To dream that, in a fearful shipwreck, you have been hurled upon a sharp rock,
and to awake to a sense of i. position on the floor, is unlucky.
To dream of goblins, villains of the deepest dye, assassins, daggers, and such
things as utterly destroy your rest, is decidedly unlucky. .
To keep on dreaming and awaking five times in a night is unlucky.
To dream that you are fighting for your life with wild bears, and to find yourself

hitting your wife on the head with a bolster, is unlucky,
very unlucky.
To dream that you are making a long and powerful
address to a jury and to deliver the same oratorically, is
unlucky for any one who happens to be in the same room
trying to go to sleep.
SIGNS.
To dream that you are in a land of golden apples and
silver roses, with jewels and diamonds sparkling on the
trees, and that you are dancing with a fairy-like being,
whose face you think is not quite unfamiliar to you, is a
sign that you’ve probably seen the Transformation Scene
of a Pantomime.
To dream that some one has given you two hundred
million billion thousand pounds, seven shillings, and six-
pence halfpenny, is a very good sign that you are dreaming.
To dream that you are being tried for something or
other, what it is nobody in Court, including the Judge,
seems to know, and that, you are about to be, hung for
it, whatever it is, (at which point you awake with a start),
is, a pretty good sign that you’ve lately been reading the
ailey and Police Reports.
To dream that you were sitting in a room which is very
like your own drawing-room, only not exactly it, and there
met your cousin Tom, only it wasn’t quite your cousin ToM,
but rather taller, or paler, or younger, and that he suddenly
seemed to jº . in the air, and point all at the same
moment to a black monkey, at least something like a
monkey, only with a lion's tail, climbing up the bell-rope,
which appeared to be hanging from the centre of the ceiling,
and that, all at once, you found yourself in a large open
square with a box of sardines and a trombone, which you
wanted to clean, but couldn't on account of the cobbler's
wax in the mouth-piece, and that somehow the trombone
became your cousin ToM again, who insisted upon your
swallowing a box of gelatine, lozenges, because they were
iced on purpose for you, and that then, some one, coming
from somewhere, asked you to º inside, and you don’t
know how it was, but you found yourself in a cab, when
just as the driver banged the door, you awoke—to have
dreamt all this, is a sign that you’ve muddled up a jolly lot
of things in your head, and it is to be hoped you are rather
clearer when awake. - ---
To dream that you are condemned by the Inquisition,
and that heavy weights are being placed, by way of tor-
ture, on your chest, is a sign that you’ve probably gone to
bed directly after supping on cold boiled pork.
To dream that you are Fº º from the top to the
bottom of a lofty flight of stairs, without any legs under
you, is a sign that you require a little medicine.
To dream anything is a sure sign that you are asleep.

that LEMAITRE played the part of Robert Macaire in a

would mention another thing, showing the folly of the upper orders.
Qn a freezing night, a delicate woman would change her warm dress
for a very light one, put on shoes no thicker than ribbons instead of her
comfortable boots, and with nothing on her head, shoulders, or arms,
would go out and sit in all the draughts of a playhouse, or stand on the
landing of a staircase, with the wind constantly ". . from the
street-door. What could one do with creatures so hopelessly plunged
in folly? (Sensation.)
MR. GeoRGE FUNNEL said that he had been steersman to a steam-
boat, and that ladies, when they saw him at the wheel, had often said
that they could not understand how his twisting that wheel made the
paddles go round and round. (Great laughter.) Still, he had heard
that class talk intelligently about objects on the voyage, and he did
think that they were not naturally idiotic. He was for º

said that he was not greatly
in the line of speech, but he
should be kindly turned on if he flickered. (Cheers.) He had
been, in the way of business, a good deal into the houses of the

got a chance. He could say that it was a great mistake to suppose
that they were ill-conditioned or reserved, quite the reverse. hey

They had always been ready to talk to him, and it was interest-
ing, though melancholy, to hear some of their simple questions.
(Hear, hear.) For instance, a lady, with pearls on her well nigh as
big as one of those gas globes, had asked him whether gas did not
come out of the ground if you stuck a pipe, in., (Sensation.), She
was not at all angry at his laughing, but insisted that she had read that
such a thing was the case in some countries, and why not in England?
That showed that a little knowledge was a dangerous thing, (Cheers.)
He explained the real truth to her, but he was afraid that she was not
listening, because she suddenly answered a military party who was
talking to a girl on a sofa, but it was something to awake a spirit of
intº (Cheers.)
MR. John DovetAIL, a carpenter, said that he always found the
Swells humble and civil, when he was called in to do any odd job. But
until there was some general system of teaching, he feared that we

ridiculing those who had fewer advantages than himself, but he would
just mention that a young gentleman, the son of rich but honest
arents, had shown him a little kennel which he had made for a
favourite puppy. How did the Meeting think he had fastened the
pieces? With large pins and gum. (Shouts ºf laughter.), When he, the
speaker, showed him a bradawl and some nails, the dear lad looked as if
a new world was open to him. (Cheers.) -
MR. WILLIAM CLINK, a bricklayer, said there was much good in the
richer classes, but their fault was, that they were so heedless and
improvident. Look at the very building in which they were. The
great hall was crowded to excess on music mights, and if an alarm
of fire were i. there was but one way out, and hundreds would be
trampled to death as sure as bricks were not mortar. Yet º kept

MR. WAPPING CALves said that he had been a footman (hisses), but
he was happy to say that he had raised himself to the position of a
small coal man, and hoped that he should have the respect of the
Meeting. º In his former capacity he had, of course, seen a
reat deal of the rich. He thought well of them, but they had many
aults. º had no regard for truth, and, would order a servant to
deny that they were in the house, when they did not wish, to see, a

twelve in the day. (Sensation.) It was true, he assured the Meeting,
and a lady at one end of a room would ring a bell and bring a man up
several flights of stairs to fetch her a book that lay on a table out of
her reach. Still, they were very kind when they knew how to do any
kindness, but so few of them took the trouble to know. As a practical

creatures. If they were foolish, let us be thankful that we know better,

docile and thankful for instruction. (Cheers.)
| MR. MARRow, a butcher, said that the old story of the Irishman who
fed his pig one day and starved him the next, that the bacon might be
in alternate slices of fat and lean, was nothing to the things, which
ladies and gentlemen had said in his master's shop. He was afraid that
little could be done for the class in question. No earthly power could
teach some of them not to ask for a haunch when they meant a leg, and
as for bone, their impatience was only equalled by their ignorance on
that head. He thought, however, that something might be effected by
lecturers, if we could only induce the rich to attend.
MR. Thomas RIMER was a composer of street-ballads. It had been
said there was nothing like leather, but he was not open to that fling,
as he would show. He thought that if, instead of the wretched Italian
and English songs now sung by the rich, which he could assure, the
|Meeting were the most namby-pamby trash in creation, they could be
taught to sing ballads of a better kind, in which truth should be incul-
cated, good might insensibly and inoffensively be done. Instead, for
| instance, of such a song as “Coo, says, the gentle Dope” (shouts of
derisive laughter), a female were to sing “The Satisfied Tradesman and
his Economical Wife” (applause), in which, as he perceived they remem-
bered, it was shown how a frugal woman should lay out one pound one
on her family, the lesson of thrift and care would be taught. He would
only say that if it were liked, he would gladly give a thousand copies of
that song, gratis, for distribution among the upper class. (Cheers.)
After some other speeches of a humane and philanthropic kind, it was
agreed that a Committee should be formed, for ºft out MR.
| lúmen's proposal. Ayotº of thanks to the chair was followed by a
unanimous call for a vote of compliment to Mr. Punch, for his indefati.
gable exertions to bring all classes into harmony. Amid the loudest
| cheering, the Meeting adjourned, after singing the hymn, “Pity the
Follies ºf a poor rich Man.”
INTERNAL UTILITY.
The following advertisement appeared the other morning in a lublin
newspaper:—
Gº! AND COACHMAN, a smart, active young Man, who under-
stands his business; has a first-rate knowledge of the care and treatment of
horses, carriages, and harness; is a careful, steady driver; will make himself useful
inside, if required.
“Will make himself useful inside, if required l’. In what way is this
usefulness, we wonder, to be exercised ?. A doctor's groom might
make himself useful inside by swallowing his master's medicines for
experiment. We own we should not like, were we a body servant, to
have our body thus employed: but to these base uses we might come,
Horatio, to keep ourselves from the necessity of going to the work-
house. Still we cannot understand how a coachman is to show his
utility inside, unless he means to hint that if his master likes to drive,
he will sit inside the carriage and entertain the ladies.
Literary Paradox.
It is true that MR. SALA is the author of the Novel, Quite Alone.
It is, we are sorry to say, equally true that he did not write the novel
quite alone.

Then there would also be the Clown

ing. Yet, in good sooth, a Clown
boxed up in a cage would be a sorry
sight, except in a Pantomime.
., Surely, herein is contained a new
idea for Managers. Why should
- there not be an “Actor Show?”—
A Show of Theatrical Hands, from among whom the enterprising
Lessees of our Metropolitan and Provincial Theatres could choose
members for their Companies. There should be a list duly numbered
and arranged:—
LOT 22.--Four Singing Chambermaids. -
These should be in a large cage, like birds. They should be decked
out in the costumes of the various pieces in which they have already
performed, or in which they desire to appear. Their qualifications
should be specified, and their former engagements set forth.
LOT 25.-Sir Heavy Fathers.
These gentry, three of whom would certainly be in the tie-wig and
square cut coat of our ancestors, will require plenty of room, inasmuch
as they are addicted to strutting about, stamping, and the violent use
of the clouded cane, or stout walking-stick of |. venerable farmer. Not
that, these same sticks are needed for their support, being chiefly
required for the sake of emphatic action in all such sentences as com-
mence with “Ah! JACK, you dog, you thought to trick your old father,”
&c., or, “Zounds, Sir,” (to his Son) “do you mean to tell me,” &c.
“One of the Heavy Fathers would be in a corner, engaged throughout
the day in delivering “his cur-r-r-se, his bit-ter cur-r-r-se” on some
invisible disobedient offspring. Another should be, from morning till
night, with intervals of refreshment, in another corner of the den, givin
paternal benedictions to imaginary happy couples—employing the we
known formula, “Bless ye, my children | *

rally alluded to on the stage as "Čreatures of the Duke,” “Hirelings,”
and so forth. ...These should be placed in a remote part of the building,
as their growlings and swearings might alarm the neighbourhood.
Lot 40.—Harlequins and Sprites.
A place similar to that wherein the brown bears dwell at the Zoolo-
logical Gardens, should be provided for these gentry, as they'd turn a
summersault over railings of any ordinary height, and be away in a
iffy.
Jilly LOT 41.-Clowns and Pantaloons.
Four Clowns and two pairs of old Pantaloons. They would pass
their time in repeating the announcement, “Here we are 1* knocking
one another down, kicking one another up again, “giving and takin

lot should maintain order among them with a real red hot poker
Lot 45.-One Low Comedian.
He should be ready at any moment, on being roused, to give specimens
of his mode of doing business in various farces. He would have to be
kept up with stimulants throughout the day, and would show better if
caged with a tragedian.
We recommend the notion to the energetic proprietor of Cremorne
Gardens, where, in the winter time, this show might very well be held.

A CASE IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH.
CockBURN v. PRIDEAUx. Chaff.
In the Court of Queen's Bench, before LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE Cock-
BURN, and Justices CROMPTON and BLACKBURN, the other day, MR.
PRIDEAux showed cause against the rule which had been obtained in a
case relative to marriage fees. He said:—
“It was an action brought by the plaintiff, who was described to be no other than
a pauper, against the incumbent of a parish in Buckinghamshire for refusing to
marry one of his parishioners.”
Dulce est desipere in loco: and as the locus in quo is of all others a
Court of Justice, of course the LoRD CHIEF Justice did so. The sub-
joined joke was instantly elicited by MR, PRIDEAux's statement about
the incumbent sued for “refusing to marry one of his parishioners:” –
“The LoftD Chirr Justic E.-Two of them, I should think."
t #. Lordship thought he had MR. PRIDEAUx there. He was mis-
aken :-
“MR. PRIDEAux.-Not necessarily two of his parishioners."
The joke was with MR. PRIDEAux. Then one of the other Judges,
whose name indicates Scottish origin, made a remark that was simply
explanatory:—
MR. Justick Blackburn.—There were originally two actions, one by the husband
and the other by the wife."
This grave observation gave Cockburn leisure to try if he could not
down on PRIDEAUx. ving taken time to consider, said
“THE Lord CHIEF JUstice.—Your statement, Mr. PRIDEAux, sounded as
though the reverend, gentleman had been called upon to marry her himself
(laughter)—that is hardly what we should grant a mandamus for.”
Very, good; but MR. PRIDEAUx had the best of it. The Lord
Chief Justice, in his rejoinder, was driven to shift his joke, and amend
his misunderstanding of the word “marry.” . So, having obliged his
Lordship to vindicate his jocosity by changing his quibble, our learned
friend discreetly resumed his plea.
There was another joke which might have been got out of the case
by a third party, a joke which either of the other two Judges was in a
position to make, if #. both joke. At MR. PRIDEAUx's words
marry one of his parishioners,” when the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE said
“Two of them, I should think,” one of his learned brothers might have
observed, “That would be bigamy.” . This most pertinent, apposite,
and brilliant joke was, however, missed. - -
So much for wit in this case. In its conclusion there was wisdom:—
“The Court made the rule absolute. It was better all the facts should come
before the Court when the case came on for argument.”
Much better, certainly, than when the case came on for fun.

WE DO TO SAVE HIM FROM MARRYING OUT OF THE PARISH !”
EXERCISE FOR IGNATIUS.
GREAT children playing at Roman Catholics are capable of quarrelling
as well as small children at play likewise or otherwise. It is said that
BROTHER or FATHER IGNATIUs and the REv. G. A. HILLYARD have
fallen out, and that the breach which has occurred between them is
widening. According to a report of these gentlemen's ecclesiastical
amusements, the companions of MR. HILLYARD are associated in the
congregation of St. Lawrence, Norwich. Bagth RR IGNATIus's -
mates are combined in the English order of St. Benedict. The #.
i. and the English Benedictines constitute two hostile camps, as
ys do at prison-base. Whilst the Hillyard fellows last week were
dancing, at the Free Library, the Benedictine chaps, headed by their
priest, the Rev. G. J. OUSELEY, were doing penance barefoot to avert
the º consequences of the dishonour which they considered
that MR, HILLYARD's dancing flock were inflicting on the name of the
Martyr, their patron Saint, by capers which may, to be sure, be looked
upon as characteristic of goats rather than sheep., The chapel and altar
of the mock-monastery were hung in black, and the make-believe, or
rather make-disbelieve, shrine was veiled in ditto. Bºother. IGNATrus
preached a sermon, wherein he “protested against the dancing party
as mixing up the religion of CHRIST with the service of the Devil.”
He represented the Devil as “trying to uproot a great and good work
by mixing up tares with the wheat.” By tares IGNATIUs must be sup-
posed to have meant the dancers, whom, by so calling them, he affiliates
on the Evil One. St. Lawrence, however, can ji, be offended with
dancing votaries, or feel himself insulted by a polka, when there is a
St. Vitus's dance, worse than any other.
In further deprecation, however, of the ire of St. Lawrence, the
monks sang, the 51st Psalm to a wailing chant, prostrated themselves
before the altar, recited the seven º psalms, and then had their
heads powdered with ashes by their priest, after which “compline”
was said behind the screen, without music. We can only wish success
to the steps which the ; Benedictines took to atone for the other
taken by the Hillyardites.
ste
#. narrative whence the foregoing particulars are derived, concludes
with the remark that “when the present rigour of the weather is con-
sidered, the º of BRother IGNATIUs must be regarded
as no joke.” Certainly, playing at monks is no child's play when the
players of that game are grown-up persons; but if they were actually
children of tender years, the mildest consequences of playing it just now
would be chilblains. IGNATIUs and his monks, however, are proof
against at least those puerile affections. So they renounce stockings,
as though stockings were works of the demon, and sport sandals, which
of course they deem sanctified things if made of wood and leather
straps, though they anathematise those which consist of white satin.
Stilſ, since they affect sandals after a fashion, they should not, one
would think º: to dancing, but rather practise it, in order to make
all i; ay of their ankles. For that purpose, as they condemn
dancing, they might resort to an exercise which for them would have
the advantage of being of a penitential nature. º the monks of
the British order of St. Benedict all go skating, and air their sandalled
and stockingless feet on the ice.

really nothing about

information touching that interesting nation. Therefore, when a Scots-
man writes about his countrymen, we are only too happy to sit at the
feet of McGAMALIEL.
We have extracted a few of this Scotch, gentleman's statements
touching—and touching very nearly—the inhabitants of the English
province called Scotland, and we re-publish them, because, while we
are discovering the sources of the Nile, and (three cheers for SHBBARD
Osborn ) going to conquer the Seas of the North, it does not become
Englishmen to be unacquainted with their neighbours.

and may she not, perhaps unconsciously, resemble the potato, of which
the best part is underground?” - - -

others who have not enjoyed such advantages.” -
4. “The scholastic inferiority of our Scottish clergy cannot be dis-

10. “A large number of our countrymen exhibit a sullen, distant,
dour uncourteousness of manner, which is far from being creditable to
themselves or pleasant to those who are favoured with its display.”. .

Scotland are strongly characterised by a certain kind of cunning and
dissimulation, and are constantly trying to over-reach one another.’”

injure public buildings; in the country, trees and shrubs. Liberality
on the phºt of owners of property is rewarded by wanton mischief.”

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON
BALLADS OF THE BILLOWS.
NLY last week, your Honour, I called
our attention to the revival of the
autical Drama. But where and
oh, where ! are all the nautical dit-
ties, and the singers of them gone?
ºn in ſº, algar's, Bay,” the
* Battle of the Nile,” “My Lovely
Nancy,” and all the rest of them:
where are they? Gone ! Ay, ay,
Sir, gone ! Belay, there! not for
eyer. No, Sir, not if I, BENNY THE
Bo's EN, know it. Inspiration has
seized me; I clutch my fiddle, on
which I was, and am, no mean per-
former, and with a view to rousing
the poetic fire of my countrymen
on behalf of the poetic water, I
strike up a prelude, and then com-
mence. Each ballad is intended to
be sung, with great spirit and
pathos; each will have a tune of its own, which may be obtained by
application to Yours, my hearty,
BENNY THE Bo's EN.
THE ADMIRAL’S TRUE LOWE ;
OR, THE BREEZES OF BONNY KIRK BAY.
(This Ballad is ſounded upon a legend still believed and repeated by
the Mariners ºf Bonnykirk. The incident itself probably occurred
during the sharp and decisive engagement between the British fleet
and the united fleets ºf France and Austria, in which the flag qf
England was signally victorious. As to the justice and causes of a
war that raised the little fishing village of Bonnykirk to such an
eminence in the annals of our country's glory, I offer no opinion.—
B.T. B.)
In Bonnykirk Bay, oh, the fleet it was moored,
Sing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
As our gallant young Admiral, waving his sword
To the Second Lieutenant, who’d just come a board
With the Commodore, rigged like an Admiralty Lord,
Cried, ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !'
“A sail, ho! a saill” shouts the look-out aloft,
Sing hoi blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
And our Admiral waved the cocked hat he had doffed,
But the Commodore wept, for his heart it was soft,
While the Second Lieutenant respectfully coughed,”
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
“Avast!” shouts the skipper. His call we obeyed,
Sing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
Qf Parleyvoo Frogs Hearts of Oak aren't afraid,
Each thought of his country and fond-loving maid,
And wished that at home with his Poll, he had stayed,
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
sº the Captain, “My eyes!” if it ain't a French sloop!”
ing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay ! :
“We’ll feedere we fight!”“growls the Mate on the poop,
But a shot struck the spoon just afore he could stoop
To take from the cook his allowance of soup
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnyºk Bay!
Boom! bang! went the guns from the binnacle's deck,"
Sing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
Our brave boarding tars, at the Admiral's beck,
Rushed on with a himpetus nothing could check,"
And when three bells was sounded' the sloop was a wreck,
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
When we'd keelhaul’d amidships and spliced the ropes' ends,”
§§ blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
Says the Admiral sweetly, “This locket I sends
To my true love.” The Commodore over him bends
With a handkerchief bordered with Wa-len-ci-ennes,
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
“That handkerchief! oh!” cries the Admiral, “See!”
Sing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk, Bay!.
“”Tis my Lucy l’” cries he, and cries she “Yes, it’s me!”
I’m here, though you left me, my WILLIAM! ” Says he,
“Then I can die happy,” and did: so did she.
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
Once each year, in the Bay, when night's curtain descends,
Sing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay ! ”
The Commodore over the Admiral bends
With the ghost of a handkerchief trimmed at all ends
With the lace that is known as real Wa-len-ci-ennes.
Singing ho! blow the breezes in Bonnykirk Bay !
Chorus (all together).

FEMININE LONGEVITY,
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
- Do, pray, now use your influence, which I well know is
gigantic, to put a stop to these º letters about longevity. I
eclare I feel quite terrified when I think of what alarming disclosures
may be made by them. There is no harm in discussing the longevity of
{j} but it is really most indelicate in people to make public the
ongevity of ladies. ...As a woman, I protest against one's º: being
made known, and still more against its being made a subject of discus;
sion. Yet, I am shocked to see that letters have been written about old
ladies, and the most annoying_PROOFs have been given of the ages they
are said to have arrived at. It really makes one shudder when one
thinks of the sad peril to which one is exposed, of hearing such expo-
sures made about oneself and one's, feminine relations. I am a single
lady, and have, happily, no daughters to remind me of my age, and
prevent my º: as young as I can make myself. But suppose m
elder sister, should become an octo— something (it isn't octoroon,
know, and it rhymes with vegetarian), suppose that she gets old and
unfortunately looks so, horrid people may write letters and expose her
real º and pray then how can I make people think that I am
Juvenile :
So, Mr. Punch, I must entreat §. to stop this dreadful theme from
being publicly discussed; and I think you ought to mention the matter
to Lond PALMERSTON, and get him just to pass a proper Act of Par-
liament to suppress such correspondence. The statement of a lady's
age without her special sanction should be viewed as an outrageous libel
and ºffence, and should be punished by at least six months' hard labour
and imprisonment. Indeed I think a good sound flogging would just
serve the wretches right who are guilty of these shamefully ind cent
exposures, and I wish that every lady had, as SHAkspeaRE says, a whip
“to lash the rascal aching through the world.”
No, Sir. . Let male donkeys boast of their long years, if it please
them so to do; but a lady's age is sacred, and it should be penal to
violate its sanctity. For sacrilegious monsters who are infamous
enough to perpetrate such outrages, a proper punishment should forth-
with be invented by the law, and these miscreants be dealt with º the
officers of justice. Now that Parliament has met, not a moment should
be lost in applying for some wholesome legislation in the matter, and
surely Parliament must feel it is of personal importance to take the
matter up, for º Members Parliament has plenty of old women.
Hoping, my dear Mr. Punch, that as the champion of the ladies, you
will come to their protection, and prevent any further exposure of their
ageS, Believe me, yours admiringly,
PATIENCE PRIM.
P.S.. I enclose my carte de visite, by which you may see that when I
wear my visiting costume I am barely five-and-twenty.”
* Looks fifty, if a day.-Note by Mrs. Punch.
Punishment for Paupers.
Is it true that oakum-picking, is work to which paupers are put in
workhouses? If so, we would suggest that, as a punishment for
F. the treadmill or the crank be substituted for a kind of hard
abour which has the ..". of incapacitating some of the poor
; needlework and other lighthanded employment, by spoiling their
ngers.

GENUINE ENTHUSIASTS.
AT THE WINDOW YOU PERCEIVE PATER AND MATER ExPOSTULATING WAINLY.
TO CLERICAL MEN.
PUNCH has had of late ºf. deal to say to and for Medical men;
now for a word with Clerical men. - - -
Reverend brethren, read this advertisement, cut from the Ecclesiastical
Gazette, one of your own Church organs:—
Price by post, 1s. 6d.
O CANDIDATES FOR HOLY ORDERS.–Copies of Bishops'
Examination Papers given of late: with PRivate INFortMAtion as to the pecu-
liarities of each Bishop and his Chaplain in the vivá voce Examination of Candidates.
London: Publishers' names.
If the Examination !. are not handed to the candidates as private
affairs, there can be no objection to letting other candidates know what
sort of questions they are likely to be asked. Mr. Punch has written to
a friend of his, who is a Bishop, to ascertain how this is; but perhaps the
examining chaplain who ran to the pillar-post with his Lordship's answer,
let the letter get wet, and it stuck in the mouth, and was picked out by
somebody else, or perhaps some ass who could not read or would not
heed the orders on the § had rammed in a fat newspaper, which
choked the way, and left all subsequently deposited letters at the mercy
of the public. In one of these ways millions of letters are lost every
day. Anyhow, the Bishop's answer had not come, up to our going to
press. We, therefore, give the advertiser the benefit of a doubt which
we do not entertain.
But this proposal to show up the Peculiarities of each Bishop and of
his Chaplain, is clearly Scandalun Ecclesiasticum. We should like to
know, nevertheless, what is told, but we scorn to spend, on any printed
book, the price of two cigars, which bring us priceless thoughts. Are
the hints in this style:—l. This Bishop is testy and a little deaf.
2. This Bishop is garrulous, and will answer two-thirds of the questions
for you, if you take things easy, and give him his head, 3...This Bishop
hates any talk of the Evangelical kind; beware of the slightest unc.
tuosity; 4. Take a snuff-box, full of the best rappee, and leave it,
without offering it, near this Bishop; he will pretend to take a pinch
unconsciously. 5. Be so tremendously struck with the picture over
this Bishop's fireplace as to disregard a question; he will be awfully
pleased. 6. Seem nervous before this Bishop, as MRs. B. domineers,
and he likes to be a great man somewhere. 7. This Bishop lays harm-
less traps for you, but he is very kind; fall into one, and he will help
you out. 8. Throw in a few Latin or even Greek words, but mind your
uantities; this Bishop is a scholar, and likes scholars. 9. Look out;
this Bishop knows everything, and gives no quarter. 10. This Bishop
is a 'man of the world, and very good-natured, but don't you quote.
ll. This Bishop is rather a crab, but will be just, if you don't show the
least morsel of Pusey. 12. A very good Bishop, but not very learned,
so he takes you on doctrine; mind you are sound. And so on, through
the whole right reverend roll call, and their Chaplains."
Well, brethren, this Handy-book to the Hierarchy may be useful,
and.so may be listening at a door, or º into a friend's letters or
cheque-book. But, on the whole, one has a prejudice in favour of folks
who play the game of life fairly, and—and so we don't give you the
publishers’ names.
WHERE THE SENIOR WRANGLERS GO TO.
APROPOs of the last Cambridge Honour-list—in which, 'W'. way,
a nobleman's son struts for the first time at the head of the Wranglers,
and may consider himself and family complimented by Mr. Punch on
the proud distinction—some noodles have been asking “where the
Senior Wranglers go to.”. These inquirers must be of the same
sagacious order of mind which, in childhood, is apt to inquire “where
the old moons go to.” -
The same answer, may be given to both questions. As the old
moons are cut up into little stars, these larger luminaries of the
University are cut up into lesser lights as College Dons and Heads,
University Professors, rectors of fat College livings, Bishops, Judges,
Queen's Counsel, M.P.'s, &c., &c.

MR. PUNCH's DELIGHT AT FINDING His DEAR OLD PUPPETs where HE LEFT
THEM In July.
PERFIDIOUS ENGLISH.
The French journal, Le Monde Artiste, is good enough to take the following
notice of us:—
“QUEEN Victoria has resolved to confer the title of barronet on the Poet Lanwent, ALFRED
TEMYsson.”
We were so grateful and pleased at reading this in a contemporary, that we
instantly sent over for Le Monde Artiste, and we have had much pleasure in trans-
lating, and have still more in publishing the rest of the paragraph:—
“These distinctions are scarcely worthy a nation that boasts a SHAKSPIRE,
a BENJonsong, a SHEELEY, and a MARTING TwoPAIR, and we infer, not without a
certain lively regret, that the democratic lessons of M. Brigti and M. Whit of
Brigton, have not taught our fat neighbours better things. Is, it an honour to
carry as the supporters of your heraldic arms the two gory hands of Ulstar, the
Irish robber Would they hold FERADAY's telescope firmer, or make steadier
the crucible of M. AIRy? Would they guide better the pencil of STANsfeld,
.P., or of HANDEI, the celebrated animal painter, of the royal FIRTH, of the
chivalrous WARD, of the powerful MEELAY Would they lend what the #nglish call
trigour to the eloquent GLALDSTONES, or new subtlety to the epigrams of M.
DisRALITE P. Would they make the admirable SIM REEf a more admirable tenor,
or baritonalize more eminently the bold St. LAY, now in Spain? Would they
really adorn the shield of Dickons, or the lozenge of MADAme ADAM, the Wenerable
BEDE. Ah, no! Let us rather say with the wild exciseman of the Highlands,
“Haman's Haman, for all that, and twirth as much as the stomp on the ginney.’”
THE ZOOLOGICAL SHAKSPEARE.
DEAR PUNCH,
. , SHAKSPEARE has been proved to have been almost everything. Do you
not think that at some period of his life, he was a keeper at the Zoological Gardens
of the time? Else, where did he get his splendid knowledge of natural history?
He must have known that in India the native princes tame the hunting-leopard and
use him for sport. For in Henry IV. Part II, Act ii., Scene 4, he makes Falstaff say,
“He (Pistol) is no swaggerer, hostess. A tame Cheetah—you may stroke him as gently as a
puppy greyhound."
How beautifully this describes our two animals whom the little boys love to
irritate by running up and down before the cages, and I wish they wouldn't.
Yours, respectfully,

Bother his active mind and body! We dare say he is a

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE stage.
CHAP. X.—THE ACTOR-MANAGER.
F course the Manager's tactics will
vary according to circumstances, such
as his main object in º the
situation and character of his theatre,
the time of year, and the set of public
taste.
It is a vulgar error to suppose that
every Manager's first object is money.
the Manager is an actor, all sordid
aims are very often nobly subordi-
nated to purely artistic considera-
tions, and we not unfrequently see
a *: consenting to lose money
provided he may but gratify his artistic
instincts by appearing in a great part.
Such a sacrifice of course claims its
reward. The Manager-Actor, as the
head of his company, is entitled to the
best business. To throw his own part
into strong relief, he will, at whatever
cost to his own feelings, find it neces-
sary to keep down all the rest. His
company cannot fairly grumble at
this. Every picture must have one
principal light; and as artists, they
must be aware that nothing gives so
- - much effect to a bit of positive colour
as a judicious setting of neutral tints.
If you are, an actor, therefore, your object as Manager will be to
throw .. up in the eyes of the public. You are identified with
}. theatre, and, in the long run, your success must be its success.
esides, you are bound to consider your own professional future. The
position you secure as Actor-Manager may be turned to account in
subsequent engagements as Actor. You cannot be blamed for making
hay while the sun shines; and as you have to fix and pay salaries, it
is surely excusable to set yourself down at a high figure.
The public is not apt to analyse successes, nor particularly keen in
assigning the proportions in which individual actors contribute to its
pleasure, nor how much of this is due to the performers, and how much
to the piece. It should be your aim to impress upon them, that, on the
stage, all success is due to the Actor, and among actors to the leading
one-yourself. You must not neglect any opportunity of guiding the
criticism of the Press in a proper direction to strengthen this impression,
If you can once succeed in raising yourself to the sphere of a theatrical
star, your future ought to be made. Even though you lose money as
Manager in, the pursuit of this noble ambition, you may soon recoup
yourself in “starring” engagements.
To become a star it will of course be necessary that you should play
all the best parts. ..If you revive old plays, you will natu choose
those only which will enable you to distinguish, yourself in the most
opposite styles. Thus, it is well to alternate high tragedy and low
comedy, and occasionally to “double” a part, so as to display your
versatility in the same piece.
Of new plays, you will only accept those which give you a proper
opportunity for displaying your ability, and will take care that all the
#. but your own are judiciously subordinated. If in any of them you
etect a dangerous amount of colour, on first perusal of the piece, see
that the author takes it out. Good situations and speeches may often,
you will find, be transferred with advantage to the general effect from
other parts to your own.
With all your precautions, however, you will sometimes find a part
coming out into mischievous prominence in rehearsal, . In these cases
you should first warn and advise the offender of his mistake, in a friendly
way.
If the actor prove incorrigible, and persist in bringing his
character into too high a light, take him out of it, and entrust it to
some more conscientious member of your company.
You find this course economical, as well as conducive to the
artistic subordination of effects.
It will enable you to dispense with an expensive company, and to
concentrate your outlay on yourself, and your scenery, dresses, and
lºſions, which, between them, make up the attraction of your
eatre,
You will, of course, second your efforts in the theatre by taking
proper measures to enlighten public opinion out of it. I have already
alluded to your duty in relation to the recognised organs of opinion.
You will soon find out those of the critics who have the faculty of
artistic appreciation, and it will at once be your duty, and your plea:
sure, to show your sense of their merits by all, the little attentions and
hospitalities which constitute so agreeable a bond between the artist
and the critic.
Where, as is every day more common,
To the grosser public, which cannot be expected to appreciate criti-
cism, you must appeal by means of the hoarding, and the poster. Much
is to be done even by these means to guide and elevate the taste of the
masses. They like large letters and flaring colours. The limits of size
and splendour seem to have been reached for the moment. But
mechanics and chemistry, together, will probably soon enable us to
enlarge even our present Brobdingnagian sheet-posters, and to intensify
the gorgeousness of their colouring, Think of this.
You should not be above bending your mind even to considerations
º: at a first glance, may seem rather within the domain of the bill-
sticker.
Do not forget that appealing to the public is an art as well as acting,
and one which no Manager now-a-days can disdain.
Reiteration and emphasis are as important elements of stage popu-
larity as action of oratory.
If every hoarding and dead wall in London can once be made to
proclaim, in gigantic capitals, your greatness as an actor, and the
success of your theatre, the public will not be long in taking both for
granted, and in flocking, not to ascertain if the announcement is true
and well founded, but to satisfy itself that it is so.
What it comes prepared to believe it will believe.
It is a noble public—the British—large of faith, liberal of admira-
tion, facile in enthusiasm, faithful to its favourites, with a nose that
is more used for leading its wearer by than for sniffing out faults, and
a voice at all times more disposed to cry “Bravo!” than to goose.
It is a public that pays, and is proud of paying, and when it has
done so, is too generous to ask whether it has value received for its
money, a public that will confidingly allow its admiration, to be put
into its, mouth, and takes its judgments at, second-hand with a large
and child-like trust that, to me, is inexpressibly touching.
The Actor-Manager is, indeed, privileged in his special opportunities
of testing to the utmost the naïve simplicity and gushing enthusiasm of
the dear old B. P.' . .
Of the Manager who is not an Actor, in our next.
TOUCHING EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE.
. The Imperial and Royal Provincial Tribunal of Vienna, Penal Sec-
tion, has been sitting, in judgment, on Mr. Punch, in respect of an
... article' of his called "Mephistopheles to the Reichsrath,” and another
“article” called “A Covered Insult.” Stay, here is the Tribunal's
own language, about the first case:—
“SENTENZA.
“L’I. R. Tribunale provinciale di Vienna, Sezione penale, in forza del potere
conferitogli da S. M. I. R. A., ha giudicato che il tenore dell' articolo: “Mephis-
tophele to the Reichsrath’ contenuto nel N. 1220 del giornale settimanale illustrato
Punch, che si pubblica a Londra, costituisce il fatto in genere del crimine di offesa
alla Maesth sovrana a tenore del S 63 del Cod. pen, ed annette a tale decisione, a
senso del $ 36 della legge sulla stampa il divieto dell’ ulteriore sua diffusione.”
The second is like unto it, only instead of calling Mr. Punch's article
an offence to the Sovereign Majesty, it is called an “insult” to ditto,
and there is added a sentence of confiscation.
Mr. Punch begs to return his most humble and hearty thanks to the
Sovereign Majesty, to L’I. R. Tribunale, to the respected W. P., one
Schwarz, who signs the sentences, and to the elegant THALLINGER, his
secretary, as also to the Official Gazette of Venice, in which these sen-
tences are published. A more admirable and efficient means of informing
Austrians and Italians that there are two remarkably good things in
Punch, which the Government does not want them to see, could hardly
have been devised, and, only adding that any letters from Venice or
Vienna, or elsewhere, shall receive all attention at his publishing office,
he subscribes himself, with intense devotion to the Supreme Majesty
with best respects to L’I. R. T., with kind regards to Schwarz, an
with Toby's love to THALLINGER,

FEBRUARY 18, 1865.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 63
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UESDAY, º 7th, 1865, be the
last Session of the Parliament evoked by the
Conservatives for their own extrusion from
office. The weather showed itself equal to
the melancholy occasion. “A trouble, both of
clouds and weeping rain, Engendered, hung
o'er BARRY's triple height, Spirits of power
assembled there, did plain. Of bodies splashed,
and all in muddy plight.” Ask you why
senatorial faces gloomed? Dissolving views
of Dissolution loomed.
This Parliament has lived to an unnatural
old age, and has assumed somewhat of an
awful character. It remembers events that
have long passed out of the memory of the
oldest inhabitant. It has weird whisperings, and mutter-
ings, and hints about some great thing which is going to
happen. It has a painful, cºnsciousness of its ºwn time
having been mis-spent, and therefore it abuses all around
it for not being in a frenzy of energy. Also, it is a f.
bore. But it must be borne, with until released, and this
day was the Beginning of the End. The Poet, PUNCH
shows his sense of the solemn character of the day, and
chronicles it in an
§ngll of the Queen.
A storm was coming, but the times were still,
When WESTBURY, from Welsh AP ITHELL sprung,
Who keeps the conscience of the blameless QUEEN,
Spoke to Her Peers and Commons in Her name,
And duly mindful of his oes and aes.
“With satisfaction doth the QUEEN recur
Once more to your assistance and advice.
The Austrian and the Prussian with the Dane
Have made a treaty. What is done is done.
Nought bodes the stirring of war's embers now.
Still in death grapple writhe Columbia's sons,
Still sternly ºdoth BRITANNIA stand,
Still for their reconcilement prays the QUEEN.
In far Japan a rebel Daimio's rage
Infringed a treaty, and his powerless liege
Failing to right the wrong, our cannon spoke,
Echoed by French and Dutch and Yankee guns,
His forts are ashes, and all seems serene,
Whereof shall documents inform you more.
Not quite submissive yet on earth is laid
The tattooed brow of the New Zealander,
But he hath learned a lesson, learned as well
The º terms might bring him to our grace.
On Abraham's heights grave delegates have met
Scheming to link in one grand Federal bond
Our North American dependencies.
The project likes us much, and if it fadge
Your solemn sanction shall be surely sought.
India is tranquil, but the Bhootanese
Have had to feel the British boot can kick.
Dread was the hurricane that lately swept
O'er our Palatial city in the East,
And direful was the slaughter. All that gold
And British energy could do was theirs
Who mourn their thousands, and with whom we mourn!’
Projecting on a level next his glance
Where the tall DENISON stood full in view
Heading a band of Commons, WESTBURY said:
“The Estimates for the ensuing year
Are ordered to your table by your QUEEN:
They have been framed with economic care,
But due attention to the public weal.”
Again enfolding in one general gaze
That whole august Assembly, he resumed:
“The country's case is satisfactory,
Up to the estimate the income springs.
Distress in manufacturing homes abates,
And the late labour law you gave works well.
The last Hibernian harvest-time was good,
And Erin's commerce soars on emerald wings:
Statements her sons of course will contradict.
To useful legislation we shall ask
Your willing help. A Temple must be reared
Where the twin gods of Equity and Law,
Those Dioscuri of the British state,
May smile their costly smiles beneath one roof.
The Statutes must be cleared of all their trash,
And so condensed, that (as your Sovereign hopes)
A Code Victoria may one day be born. -
The patient, thoughtful sage, whose painful toil
Strikes out some grand invention, now is left
At the no-mercy of a Patent law -
#. which the shallow greedy quack's enriched;
This must be mended. To those sordid Courts
ſº from the County) where, proverbially,
The retail tradesman bears tyrannic sway,
Some Equity must now be taught. The Poor
Should be relieved from the ºf churl,
Nor treated worse than felons, and the Schools,
Endowed by the great dead, must be reformed
Till fit to train the living to be great.”
Thus, ending gravely with the accustomed prayer,
Spoke WESTBURY, from Welsh AP ITHELL sprung,
ho keeps the conscience of the blameless QUEEN.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
- * else who may prove not to have imitated him.
Tuesday Evening. LoRD CHARLEMONT, in moving the Address, very
justly, if not very profoundly, remarked that the Speech presented few
matters of importance. RD Hough TQN seconded, and gave, an
artistic sketch of the state of foreign affairs, and specially urged law
reform at home. The noble DERBIDEs, translator of Homer, then
addressed the Chiefs:–
On GRANVILLE, first,
Sarcastic glance he cast, and thus he spake:-
“”Tis well, and thus an aged Minister
May fitly soothe a dying Parliament,
Whose fleetly passing hours should not be stirred
By aught of discord or exciting jar. .
T j. I taunt thee not that in Brazil
England is hateful, mainly through the fault
Of him, thy Foreign colleague, nor demand
Why in Japan we wage a little war, -
Or where’s the row in Ind? a point on which
Thy ligneous colleague seemeth uninformed.
But this for future counsel we remit. -
Yet hear my words, I pray. Across the brine
Our cousins clutch each at the other's throat,
Though three years since, O chiefs we all were told
A. month would clutch their hands in peace.
I blame not Russell that this nation stands
Neutral, though all ungrateful are the men
Whom most he favours, but I bid him heed
That LINcoLN burns to cast the fatal spear,
Signal for war, or, like the Athenians,old,
To loose a Lamb into the field of Bull.
*Apra rpoBáAAew, as our Cox would say...
Upon the lakes he thirsts to launch his ships,
And why P. That he hath fear of Canada |
Canadame no Canadas, the wolf
Was in more deadly peril from the lamb
Than UNCLE SAMUEL from our provinces.
He means aggression, therefore be prepared,
Or we shall summon you to dire account.
No more of that. Sonorous as the Speech
Is your Address, and truly meaning nought,
And therefore let it have our full assent.’
Thus spoke DERBIDEs, and from off the board
He took his staff, with golden head adorned,
And, careful not to sit upon his hat,
Resumed his seat amid a general cheer,
Bestowed in part upon the statesman keen,
Bestowed in part upon the scholar true,
And ratified by plaudit from great Punch.
Having no intention of injuring the success of LoRD DERBY's volumes
by inditing an Opposition Homer, Mr. Punch will now descend to prose,
# there be no . name for his exquisitely pellucid diction. He
roceeds to note that LoRD GRANVILLE replied to Lord DERBY, paid
#. a graceful compliment upon his literary achievement, and inti-
mated that the good humour shown in his speech might arise from his
belief that the next election would carry him into office. ... His Lordship
explained that somebody had forgotten to put into the Speech any dis-
tinct explanation about the Indian difficulty, which might have been
anywhere for aught that CHARLEy. Wood had caused the CHANCELLOR
to say. The poet Punch has rectified the error in the Idyll; he never
snaps at flies. LoRD LEITRIM was very sorry that Ireland was yery
miserable, and was very happy that LoBD, Wodehouse had been
made i.f. The EARL Russºi, then replied to Lord DeRºy, with
sundry vindications, and specially declared that the latter had not done
justice to the irritation in the United States, which had adopted a
course that did not seem unnatural. He added, that the Yankees
should have no compensation for anything the Alabama and her sisters
had done, and he finished with some words which Mr. Punch quotes:—
“When I see there is a proposition before the American Congress to put an end to
an abominable crime—the keeping men in slavery—and to abolish for ever involun-
tary servitude in the constitution of the United States, I rejoice that so great a
blot is about to be removed from the character of a civilised nation. (Cheers.)"
And very proper cheers; but the abolition of slavery is quite com-
tible º, the invasion of Canada, and therefore Mr. Punch presents
is respectful compliments to all whom it may concern, and begs to
state that he is on the look-out, and that it will be very awkward for
the Commons the debate was so exceeding dummy—double
dummy, in fact—that Mr. Punch chronicles it only to show his con-
tempt for the Dignity of History, SIR. H. WILLIAMSON and MR, HAN-
BURY TRACY moved and seconded the Address; M.R. Scully scullified;
DR. BRADY said that the paragraph on Ireland was more worthy of
Punch than of the Speech, but we see nothing in that paragraph to
deserve so outrageous a compliment; M.R. H. SEYMoUR wanted all
sorts of reforms, and grumbled at Mr. MAssey's being sent to India;
MR. R. Long had been to Ireland, and had come away horrified, but
wished the PRINCE OF WALEs were Wiceroy, and for the enactment
of a penalty on absentee-ism; MR. ScourFIELD (we promise ourselves
many pleasing jocularities out of his name, and we hope he will like
them) objected to any false economy in military matters; , M.R.
MAGUIRE declared that the Irish were deeply discontented and also
º disaffected—we are sorry to read the first allegation, and glad to
r the second, for we hate affectation—SIR ROBERT fº. argued
ably in support of the Irish paragraph; LoRD FERMoy, thought that
the last Session of a Parliament was not a time to introduce a Reform
Bill, and he also stated that the last Irish harvest was not an average
one; SIR F. CRossLEY did not see what injustice was done to Ireland;
MR. KINGLAKE wished to know why we had recognised EMPEROR
MAXIMILIAN of Mexico, whom, he being a protégé of another Emperor,
MR. KINGLAKE was of course prepared to consider as a kind of second-
rate fiend; CoLONEI, SYKEs complained of Qur, conduct in China;
and SIR CHARLEs WooD was almost inaudible in the gallery.
The only diverting incident, on the opening night, was the rise of
that bright accidental star, MR. DARBY GRIFFITH, who “was received
with ironical cheers and laughter,” and who “thanked the House for
the kind encouragement given him.” Nevertheless, he had a sensible
suggestion to make, namely, that the threepenny colonial postage stamp
should be used in England.
.# The Commons agreed to the Address, SCULLY and
some other Irish taking a division, and showing the weakness both of
their numbers and of their brains.
Thursday. The CHANCELLOR exposed the abominable working of
the Bankruptcy Law. It cost, last year £283,872 to divide
£533,664 among creditors. That sentence ought to be the sen-
tence of the system. -
We originate a beautiful aphorism. Truth is stranger, than fiction,
We were led to invent this saying by a notice given to-night. In one of
the most extraordinary and admirable lectures that we have ever
heard, one called A Night with the Speaker (we regret that we forget
the lecturer's name) we remember that among the illustrations of
Parliamentary Petitions for Impossibilities, was given “a petition
against the payment of rent in Ireland.” The audience went into a
roar. To-night, MR. MAGUIRE gave notice that he should move for
leave to bring in a Bill to abolish the law of distress for rent in Ireland,
which, of course, is exactly the same thing, for who in his senses would
pay rent if he were not obliged P. We conceive that the lecturer we
allude to has a claim against MR. MAGUIRE for compensation.
Government will not legislate about Railway Accidents, MR. GIBSON
stating that very few accidents occur, and also that last year the Rail-
ways had paid £174,000 for damages by accidents. The public may
either reconcile the two statements, or derive comfort from whichever
seems to offer most of the article.
The Bankruptcy System is sent to a Select Committee, so that ample
time will be allowed for gentlemen with fraudulent intentions to carry
out their little games, before Parliament can interfere. Mr. Punch
has ordered some carriages, has taken a house at £600 a year, and has
requested Mrs. Punch to dress in a manner becoming her station and
the income he derives from creditors.
Friday. SIR GEORGE GREY said, that in reference to explosions like
that at Erith, he had nothing to say at present, but the most
careful inquiries were being made as to the probability of gunpowder
exploding when fire was applied to it. He should also do nothing to
prevent crushes at existing theatres, when alarms of fire were given,
but the LORD CHAMBERLAIN would license no new buildings in which
a fair chance of escape should not be afforded. . If the public is
scrunched after this notice, it is the public's own fault, of course.
SIR John WALSH made a speech on the American Lakes question,
but LoRD PALMERSTON urged that an irritating topic should not be
Fº that he had no reason to believe that the Americans desired hosti.
ities, and that at all events we should not assume the fact. Very proper
and meaningless, of course, and just what a Minister is bound to say.
MR. Dodson was elevated into the place of MR. MASSEY, as Chair-
man of Committees. He is an excellent man of business, and though
he speaks a little thickly, this DoDsoN has no connection with Fogg.
MR. GLADSTONE had a good deal to say about country Banks of
Issue, to which he proposes to concede certain boons.
ing into details, which are revolting, Mr. Punch informs the amiable
wives and pretty daughters of all country bankers that Papa has had a
reat slice of luck, and ought to give at i. one dinner party and two
ances. A suggestion of mischief naturally brings Mr. Punch to the
Courts of Law, and to the mention that the Government now proposes
the concentration of the Courts, and the placing them between
Chancery Lane and Clement's Lane. The expenses will be a million
and a half, which is about the yearly expense of the cabs in which clerks
rush about after their learned masters, who at present scatter over
Town. The legal members grumbled over the M. for effecting the
purpose, but sanctioned them. Like their divinity, Dulness,
“The lawyers, with a discontented air,
Seem to reject him though they grant the prayer.”
And so endeth the chronicle of the first week of the last Session of
LoRD DERBY's patricidal Parliament.

DRESSMAKING MADE EASY.
LADIEs, give your orders to the London Dressmaking Company
imited), shortly about to commence business at 18, Clifford Street,
ond Street, , Give your orders in time, Ladies, in order to enable this
humane Society to out its benevolent intentions. The benevolent
intentions contemplated by this Association are the production of the
prettiest of all possible dresses, and the preservation of the health, and
the sufficient remuneration of the dressmakers who construct them.
A moderate fixed maximum of profit on capital invested, say eight per
cent, all gains above that amount to go to the good of the workwomen;
hours of work from eight to eight, two hours out of those twelve to be
allowed for meals, making the work-hours ten, whether in or out of the
Season: these are the principal points which the London Dressmaking
Company (Limited) proposes to go upon.
Consider, Ladies, with what unalloyed pleasure you will contemplate
your clothes in the mirror, knowing that they have been made with
no ruinous expense of vital energy on the part of their makers, who, to
make them, will not have been obliged to sit, up all night in close
rooms, breathing carbonic acid. For well ventilated work-rooms con-

The London Dressmaking Company, Ladies, is patronised by the
Lord Bishop of LONDON and the Lord Bishop of OxFord, and also
by the Right Reverend the EARL OF SHAFTESBURY. It has engaged
hands that will get you up anything as sweet as was ever conſectionné
by a Parisian modiste.

THE GREAT UNPAID FOR EVER
ConsideBABLE excitement has been caused at Leeds by a sentence
of one month's imprisonment lately pronounced upon ELIZA STRAFFORD,
a respectable woman, aged 55, servant of H. Chorley, º: J.P., for
stealing a pound of º which she had given away under the im-
pression that it was her lawful perquisite. . . .
The Leeds Justices, the other day, also distinguished themselves by
the administration of justice thus recorded:–
“MARTHA DRURY, a middle-aged woman, appeared in answer to a summons
charging her with †.” language to MATILDA DAVIDson, a neighbour. She
was also charged with having assaulted her. The case having been proved, the
defendant was fined 20s. and costs, with the alternative of serving 14 days in prison.
The defendant expressed her willingness to serve the time ...i. and as she was
leaving the dock, she turned to the complainant, and making use of threatening
language, said, ‘I'll give it thee, lass, when I come out." The Bench, hearing the
threat, immediately called her back, and told the woman that she was guilty of
contempt of court, and that her sentence would be altered to two months' imprisonment
without the option of a fine."
They do not manage these things better in Russia or, in Turkey, or
in a British school governed by a clergyman. The laughter occasioned
º a Bench of Country Magistrates enabling a sham detective to
plunder young MR. Ashworth, has *:::::::: subsided. Under these
circumstances the nation may be congratulated on the omission, from
the QUEEN's, Speech, of the following paragraph, which might have
been expected to appear in it:-
“Your attention will be directed to the consideration of a measure,
substituting for unpaid Justices of the Peace, ignorant of law, and sense:
less of justice, Stipendiary Magistrates who understand their business.”
This innovation, which would only, have the effect of protecti
individuals, at some expense to the public, is for the present º:

An IDYLL OF THE HEARTH.
Y HEN bubbling urn proclaims

Disclose their amber yolks,

And unctuous sausage from

By means subaqueous and
terrestrial brought
The rustling sheet f Open,

- To her who sits before the

The part that cries our myriad wants and wares,
Wherein diurnally the column stands
The bassinette begins, the grave concludes.
And when ſwemused on battles and burlesques
Qn earthquakes, storms, steam-rams, and papal bulls,
A pauper famished, and a porpoise fed,
The last new Canon, and the latest gun
The length of churches and of humani e;
And warned her curtains are no longer worn,
And bonnets, like republics, banish crowns;
She reads that LEILA DRANFIELD's trouble’s past,
And GERALD owns a roaring boy, then smiles
When lower down she finds that marriage rites
Have welded CHARLEs and FANNY into one,
And tells me of the time, the place, the priest,
And quotes the terminating words—“No cards”
With meaning voice and looks that signal scorn.
The middle stone on life's rough road in sight,
When custom yeers and shifting fashions change,
We croak a mild duet, and praise the times,
The good old times when we were twenty-five,
And spent a happy moon by lake and tarn,
Before the session of our lives began.
So taking these two chilling words for text,
With shrug and sigh contrasting now and then,
We picture, thus and thus, their sure results,
And with a telescopic glance foresee
The hymeneal changes they forebode.
“No cards”—to show where CHARLEs and FANNY live:
Whether in some suburban nest they coo,
Qr watch the river sparkling by the lawn,
Qr hear the thrushes singing in the Park,
Qr in Woburnia's placid squares consort.
“No cards”—to fix the date of their return
From misty mountains crowned with snowy helms,
(And tinfoil on their crowns); from beach and bay,
The haunt of sea-fowl and the home of shrimps;
From passes, passports, vales, and veiled nuns,
To cake, and calls, and gratulating friends,
To butcherº bills plain cooks, and ten to four.
“No cards #:#: here LAVINIA interposed
To prophesy, as time goes thieving on,
Successive cheapenings of the nuptial dues.
“No cake”—to rear its snowy splendours º
Above the marriage board, and sweet and thic
To comfort distant kin, and thick and sweet,
With almond zest, to lure devouring youth;
No mystic morsel and no merry rite,
No ring, no pillow, and no dulcet dream.
“No bells”–(a moment, ARCHIE, to recall
The merry peal St. Mary's ringers rang,
And how they brought their great brown jug for ale,
And drank our health with cerevisial shouts)—
No joyful bells to greet the mated bride
Who'll walk from church-no carriages, of course—
Through jeering crowds, through staring street and gate,
In silence reaching the pate door.
*No breakfast”—with its choice of various cheer:
The lordly lobster in his scarlet mail,
Plumed pheasant, partridge, and the humbler fowl,
The Strasbourg påté, and the Yorkshire pie,
Dusk grapes and peaches from the Chauntry wall,
The lucid jelly and voluptuous creams,
|
|
Westphalia's ham and char from Cumbrian lakes,
With speech-inspiring effervescent wines.
“No bridesmaids!”—blossoms round the perfect flower—
A lovely octave, blondes and bright brunettes,
filmy fabrics, mauve and azure trimmed,
With wreath, and rose, and long-depending veils,
Their fair ringleader following down the nave.
No swan-white robe, no flounce of Brussels lace
º know what HELLEN FoRSTER lately wore—
black tulle bonnet and a blue silk dress).
“No licence,” but by banns, as WILLIAM WAKE,
Who works for Edward at the plaster pits,
And Edward's cook were married last July.
No chariot with its pair of favoured greys—
An omnibus will take them to the train,
A carriage of the second class to Town—
No wedding tour to Paris, or—but here
The clock, that scythèd Time surmounts, toll'd Ten;
My hour had come; I could no longer stay;
So kiss'd a cheek—the fairest cheek to me—
And Westward went.
ORGIES OF INNOCENTS.
A BICH treat to a body of navvies in the service of MEssRs. Bolt
AND GIRDEB, the extensive Railway Contractors, was given yesterday by
their employers, in conjunction with the Society for the Mollification of
Adults. At mid-day the men were taken in vans to MADAME Tus-
SAUD's Waxworks, and spent several happy hours in that interestin
exhibition. They were then conyeyed to the Temperance Music Hall,
and regaled with an abundance of tea and plum-cake. This simple but
appetising fare was enjoyed by them with evident relish, and they appa-
rently made a most delicious meal. The repast being concluded, the
huge fellows were invited to join in recreation, combining mutual
|amusement with instruction, on the plan instituted by the Society.
Accordingly, a mayvy of about seven feet high gave a comic recitation
of "The Chameleon,” with a mildness the "effect of which Was
heightened by his deep and º voice. Another, of equally
gigantic proportions, in a simi *}. sonorous key, sang DR. WATTs's
pretty little poem, “How doth the little busy Bee.” Other hymns,
songs, and recitations, moral. and mirthful, amongst which were
“Twinkle, twinkle,” and, “Little Boy Blue,” were given by various
individuals among the stalwart labourers, who, finally joining in chorus
with much expression, and in j ; tune, sang “ Baa, baa, Šiac:
Sheep.” They were then addressed by the Rev. MR. SLACKJAw, who
pointed out to them, in a most affecting manner, how very nice it was
to be good, and how wrong it was to be naughty. Several gentlemen,
reverends and other, followed in the same feeling strain. A distribu:
tion of lollipops was then made, and a benediction having been invoked
by the REv. M.H. GHRIMEs, the company separated at a seasonable
hour, highly gratified with their entertainment; and the burly wielders
of the pick and shovel, who had evidently been only just weaned from
short pipes, went away sucking their thumbs.
BIRDS OF FASHION.
QUR exquisite contemporary, Le Follet, among the “Fashions for
February,” gives a list of model dresses, and the following description
of some very peculiar decorations of one of them:—
“In the hair, between the bandeaux, is placed a beautiful bird with wings
spread, and another on the centre of the body.”
A bird in the place of the clasp or buckle which unites the cincture
of the waist, is the only idea that we can exactly form of an ornamental
ornithological specimen, situated as the latter of these two birds is said
to be. Perhaps, however, we are to understand that the bird is worn
upon the bosom, like the dove which maidens are sometimes represented
in pictures as cherishing. But a stuffed dove in that situation would
be not a hollow mockery only because of being, in fact, stuffed.
Ornamental and Useful.
WE have much.. in announcing a sweet thing in coiffures.
It consists in a bandeau formed of gold and silver, and set with diamonds
and other precious stones of various colours, arranged in two numerical
figures indicating the wearer's age.
Feather v. The Queen.
MR. FEATHER brought an action against the Government to recover
compensation for the infringement of his patent. Of course, he lost his
cause. In the scales of justice what could a Feather expect to weigh
against the Crown?

Snug Street, Pimlico, at the House of MR. SNOOzEN, between the hours of
One and Two in broad daylight. There are ordinarily two servants in
the house; but one it appears had gone out on an errand, leaving the
other upstairs dressing. The thieves broke open a valuable desk, ran-
sacked the cupboards, regaled themselves with some of the contents
of the cellar and the larder, laid hands upon a large quantity of plate,
and finally decamped with their plunder. They must have stayed at
least half-an-hour in the house, and the damage done could not have
been effected without considerable noise. §... Potter has
examined the premises, and declares himself unable at present to
come to any conclusion. Vigorous measures have been promptly taken,
and a telegram has been sent to every Police Station, stating the nature
of the Theft. Police-Constable SMIRKE, A 102, in whose ‘beat ' this

several thousand pounds abstracted. The iron safe had been wrenched
open, and the strong iron chests literally smashed to pieces. This
could not have been effected without considerable noise. Mr.

VALENTINE’s DAY.
A GentleMan, who Dors Not wish to give His NAME, FRoºt FAMILY
REasons, STATEs that Just For THE FUN of THE THING, H.E. LookED
out of His Window To see IF HE should have a Valentine, AND
2 That was what MET HIs EYE.
MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.
CHAP. XI.-THE MANAGER WHO DOES NOT ACT.
THE Manager who does not act himself, and is not blessed with an
acting wife, may be called comparatively a happy, man, and the first
question such a Manager must ask himself is, what he will go in for,
or, in other words, what will pay. - -
To answer this question, requires a rapid review of the field of the
Dramatic Art, and an intelligent application of the conclusions resulting
from that survey to the facts of the day.
There is, first, “The Legitimate Drama”—whatever that may
mean–both tragic and comic, the claims of which are sure to be dinned
into the ears of everybody who has anything to do with management.
The people who talk most about the Legitimate Drama are generally
supposed to be those who don't go to the theatre; or, if they go, don't
pay for their places. The cry proceeds principally, it is often said, from
the writers of unactable plays. At all events, if it doesn’t, you may
plausibly maintain that it does, should you conclude—as I take for
granted you will—against trusting to “the Legitimate.”
But what is the Legitimate Drama? Nobody that I ever heard of
has ever answered that question.
Practically, however, the name seems to include all the Stock Trage-
dies, Comedies, and Farces, which have grown threadbare with repe-
tition, and, from the change of times and manners, have lost nine-tenths
of any colour or effect they might once have had.
Still, something may be done even with this generally hopeless mate-
rial, and there is credit to be got by it, without sacrificing profit. . .
If, for instance, you have a good scene-painter, and a star who insists
on being put up in five acts, you may do something by throwing all
your strength into scenery, dresses, and decorations, for which some
eminently legitimate plays afford almost as much opportunity as a Pan-
tomime or a sensation spectacle. W. BEVERLEY, for instance, can make
even ShakspeaRE go down. A rattling siege, or an effective battle, is a
pretty safe draw, though it be in a real old-fashioned tragedy. I am
not at all sure that a good adaptation of PEPPER's ghost-business to
Hamlet or Macbeth might not carry either of those plays through a
highly profitable season. Perhaps it is even safer to take a legitimate
play-say one of SHAKspeARE's histories—as a substratum for scenery,
dresses, and decorations, than to put the same money into a melodrama
from the French, or a burlesque. "People like to flatter themselves the
are doing the correct thing to a great author with a reputation past
question, while they gratify their love of show and fine scenery.
. As for Legitimate Comedy, there is not here the same field for
display. . Except to fill up an off-night now and then—for there are
always old fogies enough tº be attracted to your stalls and boxes for a
night or two by the bait of SHERIDAN or Goldsmith—you must be on
your guard against anything which requires so much art in your actors
and so much cultivated appreciation in your public.
Remember everybody has eyes, but those with brains are a small
minority. -
You may, however, sometimes “cannon” with good effect, from
the “Legitimate,”, by putting up a heavy, play—whether tragic or
comicit matters little—when you have a good Pantomime or Bulesque
at the back of it.
The former will º your theatre a tone, and enable you to assume
the airs of a guide of the public taste, while the attraction of the latter
bears you harmless.
A foreign star may sometimes justify you in resorting to the
“Legitimate,” almost as much as a great scene-painter. SHAkspeaRE's
lines come with such a novel effect from alien lips, that the public
forgets to be bored by them, and if once the foreigner can be made the
fashion, there is hardly anything you may not venture. Who are the
attractive Juliets and Hamlets of the day? You do not require to be
told how much of their success is due to their broken English, and
foreign chique. The Managers are only beginning to open their eyes to
this source of profit. Next to a real foreigner, a native who can ape a
foreign accent is a good card.
I assume that if you go in for the Legitimate, either heavy or light,
you will confine yourself to old plays which cost nothing.
To play pieces of this class, by living Authors, is out of the question.
They would cost far too much money. How can you be expected to
afford the extravagant price nowadays set on “literature,” and at the
same time to meet the demands of your actors, your scene-painter,
mechanist and carpenter, and, above d your printer and advertising
agents? Let literary people go for payment to the publishers. Managers
have other uses for their money. And besides requiring expensive
authors, the Legitimate business, in any case, requires good actors.
Their demands are sure to be far too exorbitant to leave you what
you require for the inevitable claims on your purse of your scenic and
advertising departments,
You ; therefore, if you are determined to encourage contemporary
Dramatists, and to paint contemporary manners, eschew the Legiti-
mate, and choose between the Sensational, or Spectacular, and the
Burlesque.
The great advantage of the former is, that it requires the gymnastic
element in its Actors, much more than the intellectual. Muscles are,
as a rule, cheaper than brains.
I except the case of a man who makes one leg or arm go farther than
is rival's two. He is worth any money. - -
So is a woman who has the courage to lay aside all the attributes
of her sex with her sex's garments, and in defiance of narrow, preju-
dices, strips, rides, fights, i. and goesin for slang or spicy singing,
e a man.
But these are jewels which you cannot expect to light upon every
day, and it is unsafe to lay out your programme with a view to them.
A wide range of sº successes is º: open to you, with
Actors possessing the normal allowance of limbs, and women who
recognise the restraints of sex. -
You have only to insist on the proper spicing of every dish you serve
up to your audience with the appetising condiments of crime, horror,
and break-neck situation. That these may the more harrow up your
public, they must be introduced into a setting as exactly copied as pos-
sible from the most familiar scenery and localities. The more impro-
bable they are in themselves, the more they require a setting of unmis-
takeable outward fact to make your public realise them. A murder
that would be tame if thrown back to the days of good QUEEN Bess
and the streets of mediaeval London, becomes a genuine sensation if
introduced in the reign of Victoria, and transacted before a well-painted
picture of the Charing Cross or Radcliffe Highway of 1864.
The reports of the police and assize-courts ought to supply your
Author with subjects in abundance...If they have not the art to use
these, they may find plenty of suggestion in the penny romances, or the
répertoire of the boulevard theatres.
You will find it more profitable to work the latter source, on the
principle of the intelligent householder who always went for his brooms
to the man who stole them ready-made. - - -
A good scene-painter and mechanist, working in collaboration with an
author who understands the sensation-business, , and, is not, above
writing up to an effect—whether of the pound-brush or the winch, sloat
and counter-weight—ought to make you well nigh independent of the
caprice, insolence, and costliness of actors. - - -

At a tea-party last week, at the residence of Miss — º gallantry forbids us to divulge the

hundred and fifty years. The evidence on which this estimate is, based, has been obtained by
uestioning each member of the party, separately and in private, and tempting her to make con-
ession (in, of course, the strictest secresy) of the ages of her friends. It is a somewhat curious
fact, that,the number of years to which each lady herself owned in the aggregate amount but
to three hundred and thirteen. This slight discrepancy possibly may occasion some astonish-
ment to unreflecting people, who forget to
make allowance for the weakness of memory
with which ladies are afflicted with regard to
their own ages, and its vigorous tenacity
when they are asked in confidence the ages of
their friends.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
oNDAY, February 13.
Hooray for ThwAItes
and the Drains. They
are nearly done, and
MR. TITE says that
they will come into
general operation at
the end of next
month. Thenceforth
the breezes of London
will be balmy breezes,
the Thames will once
more be a silver flood,
nec, sine salmonibus,
and the swans,
“As if they would the
charmed air repay,
Shake thousand odours
from their dewy wings.”
The Moral Sewage
is not so easily got rid
of, but SIR. GeoRGE
GREY introduced a
* Prisons' Bill, which
# is to improve the pre-
F sent state of things.
It is to go to a Select
Committee, whom Mr.
Punch will assist with
his invaluable sugges-
tions, when he shall
have had time to read
the measure.
The Bill for Relieving Dissenting Municipals from the necessity of declaring
that they do not intend to ". the Church of England was read a Second Time,
and will be duly thrown out hereafter.
Tuesday. The Doctor in Roderick Random, who resolved to distil a certain liquid
from tinder, by means of animal heat, was a practical philosopher compared to Mr.
Punch, that is to say supposing Mr. Punch should seek to obtain any Essence out
of such tinder-like Parliament as that of the past week. But, to pursue the illus-
tration, he will endeavour to make the sparks that emanate from his wit, when
struck against his wisdom, fall on the tinder, which he will next blow up, and then
he will show himself a match for Parliament. - -
To-night the CHANCELLOR expounded the working of his Act for Selling Little
Livings, and improving others with the proceeds, and stated that upwards of £100,000
had been thus obtained and applied in two years. An ingenious London Parson has
lit on a plan for augmenting his own living without troubling the Legislature, and
offers, if a generous public will give him £100, to charge nothing for marrying
people during the rest of his incumbency. The scheme does not seem to please
some of his brother Parsons, who inform the generous public that the proposed
compact is invalid. LoRD LEITRIM abused the Irish police, and was himself rebuked
by LoRD GRANvills for violent language, which could not add to the dignity of
the House. This LoRD LEITRIM was a Magistrate, but was very properly super-
seded for indecorum, and if he does not mind his manners, it may be the painful
duty of His Majesty the EMPERoR PUNCH to invite him to reside on his Lordship's
cstate at Killadoon until further notice.
Government issues a Commission for inquiry into the costs of Railway Conveyance,
and the charges made by the companies. This was MR. GLApstone's announce.
ment, and it betokens an early onslaught upon the Tyrants of the Rail. Our pike
shall be ready, whenever it may please MR. GLADstone to cry havoc, for sixpence
is a great deal too much to charge for a ride from Portland Road to Farringdon
Street, especially as nobody can possibly want to visit either station. MR. GLAD-
ston E, however, in answer to NUMscully, said that Government did not intend to
buy up the Railways this Session.
NuMscully then delivered a long howl against the Irish Church in general, and
certain appointments in it, in particular. The Morning Star says that the House
hates this orator, and that he knows it, and talks less out of silliness than for the
sake of tormenting the Saxon. This, if true, elevates his conduct, and entitles him
to a certain amount of respect. DR. Johnson, hearing that somebody had been
kicked, said that he was very glad to hear it, and being asked whether this were
not an un-Christian feeling, replied that it was not. “I am glad, Sir, to hear that
his character has sufficiently improved for any one to think him worth kicking.”
Mr. Punch, of course, is not to be restrained from introducing an anecdote,
appropriate or not, by any consideration for anybody's feelings, but may as well add,
that he has nothing to say against the character of MR. Scully, except as a Parlia-
mentarian, in which capacity he is an unmitigated and intolerable bore.
MR. Cox=" here we are again, and how do you do to-morrow?”—brought in a
Bill for modifying the Early Closing of Public Houses Act. It appears that drovers
and market gardeners are inconvenienced by not .# able to procure refreshments
between one and four in the morning. #. Cox also contended that gentlemen
connected with the Newspaper Press are similarly annoyed. He mentioned that the
Times had instituted a refreshment room for its employés, but that many other
journals could not conveniently do so. Mr. Punch considers that in common
Wol. XLVIII.-1865,
justice, not to speak of gratitude, to those who are toiling
and moiling all night to prepare the newspaper which
gladdens the breakfast table, some arrangement ought to be
made for their comfort. He asserts this the more reso-
lutely, because his young men have no interest in the
question, he having fitted up, at reckless cost, an exqui-
sitely luxurious restaurant för them, under a French cook,
where, at any hour of the day or night that they choose
to rush in with a witticism, they find the choicest repast
and, the most delicious wines ready at the first sound of
a silver table bell. SIR GEORGE GREY said that the Act
was working very, well, that somebody must be incon-
venienced by any change, and that in this case it must be
the market folk. As for the drovers, they are travellers,
and therefore may get refreshments along their roads.
He recommended the gentlemen of the Press to unite, and
hire a room for their own accommodation. If they do,
Parliament ought to vote them a subsidy to keep it up,
seeing that but for them nobody would know anything
about Parliament and its orators.
SIR FITzRoy Kelly, Knight of Malt-a, proposes to
improve the law of evidence, which at present works ver
unjustly, as the Divorce Judge, writes to testify. He
desires that in all SIR JAMEs WILDE's cases all parties
may be at liberty to give testimony, and that the same rule
shall hold in criminal cases. Mr. Punch heartily approves
of this reform, he having always ridiculed, in the most
caustic manner, the old stupid devices by which the Law
stops its old ears against hearing the truth.
This Tuesday being Valentine's Day, Mr. Punch was occu-
pied from ten until five in opening, kissing, and making cigar-
spills of the myriads of affectionate epistles forwarded to
the Old Dear by the young ladies of the nation. He has
been unable to get the odour of the perfumed notes off his
aristocratic hands up to the present writing, and this fact
gives him an opportunity of ºpiº MR, Eugene
RIMMEL upon the publication of a very elegant and in-
structive Perfume-Book, which Mr. Punch has carefully
put away in an airy attic, and will read with pleasure when
the scent shall have subsided. He hates all perfumes
except onions.
Wednesday. The Commons gave a Second Reading to
about two hundred private Bills, as they are called, many
of them being Bills about new Railways, and Committees
are to examine them. . Good days for us, my learned
friends, quoth Mr. Punch, Q.C.
Thursday. Hammersmith complains to the Lords about
its heavy poor-rates, and about the system of metropolitan
improvements, which drives the poor from the heart of
London to the outsides, there to become burdens. We
trust that, the prayer of the impetuous and intelligent
suburb will be heeded. LoRD GRANVILLE intimated that
something was to be done. -
LoRD PALMERston paid a kindly tribute to the memory
of MR. GREGson, late {º for Lancaster. .
MR. CLIPPoRD brings in a Bill to do away with the law
that punishes people for not going to church. This is
right. People ought to go to church, but ought not to be
sent to prison for staying away, especially as in a vast
number of parishes the fault is with the Parsons, who make
the Services much too long and the Sermons much, too
stupid. But we suspect that before the Bill passes, there
will be a row between the mover and Mother Church.
“She'll call him Cliffond, and he'll call her MADAM."
which line reminds us that the new Julia (Mr. Punch
hereby expresses his profound contempt for about four
hundred correspondents who have sent him a miserable
joke about Ju-LIA and JEw-LEAH, and Jewess LEAH, and
similar trash) is ill—not that Mr. Punch needed any re-
minding of his affliction, and the loss to the public. He
hopes that Miss BATEMAN will bring an action against
ADMIRAL FITzRoy for damages caused by his detestable
weather. - - -
Then came up the Law Courts question. This will be
battled a good deal, as many interests are concerned. As
Mr. Punch perfectly comprehends the whole business, and
what everybody means, he will feel, personally, obliged by
the omission of any attempt to humbug him or his protégé,
the Nation. Everybody is fighting, like HARRY Wynd,
for his own hand. Lincoln's Inn does not like the idea of
its valuable property º; less valuable, and Mºssks.

so that those gentlemen may pop out of Court into the House, and back again,
with convenience, satisfaction, and delight. The Templars would like the Courts
to be erected close to Little Bethell. The public wants a Temple of Justice in a
central and convenient place, and has a savage recollection of the cellars and attics
of Westminster, and how some of the Courts could never be found, and a man's
estate went away while he was ºf the porters to tell him where the place of
trial was, and how he finally detected the Judge sitting on a sink in a back kitchen,
the Counsel | ". on inverted washing tubs, and the eight public, being all the
lace would hold, balancing themselves on the window-gill, or heaving themselves up
y aid of the jack-towei roller...The City has behaved excellently, and surrenders
the cucumber-frame, called, a Court, at Guildhall. , We must have the Temple of
Justice in a satisfactory place, and that proposed by the Government will do
very well. The Inner Temple admits this. -
There seems some want of general comprehension as to the history of the
Suitors' Fee Fund, and its rightful owners, and whether it ought to be used to pay
for the New Courts. The Fund has been formed out of the results of the extortion
of the Court of Chancery in other days, and out of the results of the ignorance or
negligence of suitors. It really belongs to nobody, and the best thing would be to
give it to Mr. Punch, but the next best to *}. it to the useful purpose of
erecting a Temple of Justice, or at least of Law. Mr. Punch has spoken, and there
is an end of the matter. The Government Bill was read a Second Time.
Friday. A fierce Irish debate on the Belfast Riots last year. Everybody accused
and abused everybody. Can any reader of Punch desire another word on the
subject? We think better of the world.

WALL FLOWERS OF RHETORIC.
MR. Punch, SIR,
I AM what is generally known as a Dead Wall; but
as the present proves, my surname is a base attempt at
defamation on the part of party walls or others, pierced
with doors and windows, who are jealous of my position and
health, which is enhanced by the fact that I have never had
a pane in my side, and have more of the brick in my com-
osition than others. But this is neither here northere,
É. I have a complaint, and a sad one, much like ophthalmia
in its symptoms, for I can’t see an inch before me now, I
am so covered and filled up with º: Even my bricks
cry out against it. It is these bills, continually brought
against me that I wish you, my dear Punch, to take up for
me. One evil-disposed character, who they say has been
Fetched here on purpose, says I’m a “Roadside Inn”: he
must mean the wrongside out. Another pastes me all over
with his Hidden Hand. A third, no doubt for the fun of
misleading people, calls me the “Streets of London.”
I leave you to imagine the smell of the paste, not to
speak of the ignominy of holding up to the 5. gaze
portraits of Clowns, Singing Fish, Performing Dwarfs, and
colossal selections from all the floating capitals of all the
rinters in London. . So have me pulled down, or get a
Railway to go through me. I am sick of posters.
Yours,
A DEAD WALL.

HOW WE DINE AT THE ART-SCHOOLS AT KENSINGTON. (OH!
MR. COLE!)
HIGH TREASON AT HEMEL-HEMPSTEAD.
DURING the late Christmas holidays, many of Mr. Punch's young
friends, and some of his old ones, walking about in the country on the
skirts of a cover, may frequently have had their attention attracted by
a series of explosions, pop! pop! pop pop ! * pop ! pop! pop
pop ! |. pop . They were º aware that these noises were
made by country gentlemen and their friends rabbit-shooting.
The Hemel-Hempstead Gazette, in a report of the Petty Sessions at
Great Berkhamsted, before F. J. MooRE, Esq., Chairman, and R.
RRIGHT, Esq, records “an unusual number of prosecutions under the
Game Laws,” which sound to the mind's ear, singularly like the pop,
pings of rabbit shooting squires. Only in these cases, the game did
not consist of rabbits, but chiefly of rabbit-killers. “SIDNEY HUM-
PHREY and FREDERICK AustiN were charged with trespassing on the
first of January in search of conies, on land belonging to EARL BRowN-
10w.” Pop! pop!, They were knocked over, right and left, con-
yicted and sentenced, HUMPHREY to a fine of £1, and 13s.3d. expenses,
in default committed for three weeks; AustiN to 5s. fine, and ex-
nses 14s.2d., in default committed for fourteen days. The same
efendants “were then charged with committing a similar offence on
the 28th of January on land in the occupation of FRANcis CUTLER and
others.”. Pop!, again in the case of HUMPHREY, knocked over a
second time with a fine of 15s. and 13s. 3d. expenses, in default com-
mitted for twenty-one days more. AustiN § not appear. DAVID
Holland, of Caddington, Joseph FARR, JAMEs DEAN, ALBERT
CLARK, and THOMAS GREGORY, were then charged with trespassing
in search of game, FARR singly, the others in conjunction. Pop!
floored also. Pop! pop ! pop! pop! likewise floored with fine or im-
prisonment. THOMAs Phillips, Wi. CREEsy, HENRY PREston,
and John ARNOT, were next charged with the like offence. Pop! for
CREEsy rolled over; the rest got off.
Then, came the case of REUBEN Dwight, charged with trespassing
in search of game on a common, on land in the occupation of J. Robin-
son, Esq. Dwight proved an alibi, which, being contradicted by the
evidence of a gamekeeper, the Justices chose not to believe. !
Bagged, too, apparently; fined £2, and 14s. 0d., expenses, and
default committed for two months, and sent to the police st -
Later in the day, MR. ROBINson's farm-bailiff sent the Bench a mote to
say that Dwight was not the trespasser, that the case was one of
mistaken identity. , Dwight was therefore provisionally let go.
Really country Magistrates seem to be doing all they can to con-
vince the Legislature that the Great Unpaid ought to be the Great
Unofficial. If that is their object, it is perhaps to be hoped that they
will succeed in it; for, although there is some economy in getting
gentlemen to administer justice for ºf, there is not much in their
gratuitous administration of injustice. If they cram the gaols with
rustics, convicted, on insufficient evidence, of destroying such crea-
tures as conies, scarcely esculent vermin, their administration of in-
justice is expensive, and Parliament may come to think that what
would be spent in the salaries of competent stipendiary Magistrates
might be saved in county rates.
PRETERNATURAL WORACITY.
If the subjoined story had º: in any one of those journals
which represent the interests of the United Service, it would perhaps
have been set down by vulgar incredulity as a narrative intended for
the information of the Marines:—
“The Patria of Naples states that there is at present in the Hospital of Incurables
in that city an old woman who is suffering from a strange disease. She every day
eats at least five portions of roast meat, 70 eggs, several loaves, and other food, of
course including a good quantity of unacaroni. When attempts are made to reduce
her diet, she raves like a mad woman. Professor ZAMoglia has recently attempted
to cure the poor woman, but up to the present time her appetite remains un-
impaired.”
Not, however, to the Marines, but to the Spiritualists, should the
extraordinary relation above-quoted be told...The Times, to be sure,
heads it with “Something Like an Appetite,” which seems equivalent
to appending to it the name of WALKER., The Post, apparently in a
similar spirit of scepticism, entitles it “A Good Digestion.” But we
expect that the Spiritual Magazine will ascribe this prodigious case of
what doctors call bulimia to the same agency as that to which is ascribed
the manifestations that attended the Brothers DAVENPORT; whose
last and greatest marvel it has been reserved for Punch to announce.
At Liverpool, the other day, they positively disappeared

MR. PUNCH'S HANDY-BOOK OF THE STAGE.
CHAP. XII.--THE MANAGER WHO DOES NOT ACT.-CoxTINUED.
HE Burlesque will, naturally, be
your strong card, after Sem-
sation, or in default of it.
The word is said to be de-
rived from the Italian “bur-
lare,” to joke or jest. But
the thing, now-a-days, has
ceased generally to have any-
thing to do with “joking or
jesting,"happily for Managers.
There was a time—in living
memory, too — when joking
and jesting were thought in-
dispensable to this kind of
entertainment. A pretty story,
neatly and dramatically told
opportunities for arch an
graceful or humorous acting,
smart satire, and ingenious
allusions to , topics of the
time, pointed writing, and
well-timed parodies, were ex-
pected in a burlesque.
Old fogies still talk of bur-
lesques of this kind with a
simple, old-fashioned enthu-
siasm that is almost touching,
and wonder why Managers
mow-a-days don’t produce
something like them.
The simpletons forget that
burlesques of this kind imply
wit in Authors, and art in
Actors; both things difficult
to find, and which, when
found, come expensive.
Of course pretty faces and
good legs are required to give
these their proper effect, and
happily, gifts of this kind are
‘...". and ‘. cheap. |
you play your cards properly
- - pretty #. with the required
stock-in-trade of brass, slanginess, freedom from feminine squeamishness, and a
readiness to sacrifice womanly daintiness, in matters of costume, to §: artistic
considerations, together with a thorough command of the nigger business, may
be had for nothing, or next to *f;
The old-fashioned burlesque, as I have said, depended on wit and word-play.
What you want now in your Authors is command of the nigger répertoire,
and industrious word-torture—the very reverse of word-play.
. The worse the puns in a burlesque now-a-days, the better. The very consumma-
tion of success in this kind is a pun so bad that all the house says “Oh!” to it.
Allusions are dangerous. They require wit in the audience to appreciate them,
And they are sure to become stale in the course of the long runs which, of
course, you will aim at.
I need hardly say that good story, neat writing, felicitous parody, though not
absolutely fatal, are perfectly superfluous.
There is nothing you must guard against so carefully as shooting over the
heads of your audience. -
Why should you pay for qualities which nine out of ten of your public don't
care for, and won't miss.
As an artist of course you can appreciate such things just as well as the pre-
tentious Authors and jaundiced Critics who make such a fuss about them. But
as a Manager you must look first to what tells, and these things don't get laughs
or bring down the house like a show of legs and pretty faces, a rattling Wirginny
break-down, or a sparkling transformation scene.
Never mind what you pay for scenery and mechanism, and it is your duty as a
Manager to encourage art and ingenuity.
I conclude with some general hints useful for all Managers.
Never let down your house. . If money doesn’t come in, “paper” it.
Nothing makes Actors or Audiences so flat as the sight of empty benches.
Full houses look, like success, and with , the dear .# B. P. that is half the
battle. They delight to swim with the tide, and they don't know how much
paper has to do with the crowds who flow into your doors.
ever baulk a run.
Let bilious Critics grumble that your Actors get flat, and mannered, are forced
into exaggeration of their points, become careless, or take to ging and ing
under the ennui of a part repeated for two or three hundred nights. What º: f
The public pays, and applauds; and you put money in your pocket, Let those who
want novelt fº out of town for it. They will see change of bills enough in the
country, and I wish them joy of it.

NYZºº

-
Lastly, look upon Authors and Actors as your natural
enemies. Proceed on the axiom that these people have a
constant design on your purse, and a settled determination
to encroach on your profits.
I do not mean that you are to º this feeling openly.
On the contrary, if you wish to have your Actors tho-
roughly under command, to work 'em round your finger as
it were, always show the greatest consideration for their
amour propre—ask everything as a favour, be hail-fellow-
well-met with them, laugh with them,jº with them, lay
bare your difficulties before them, and invite their sym-
pathy, while you put your hand in their pockets.
I have, known Managers who by, this masterly policy
have laughed at bad business and defied bankruptcy for a
life time. It is impossible to refuse to go on with such
charming fellows, though the “ghost walked” out Satur-
day after Saturday. alf salaries are sweetened by the
exquisite grace with which this sort of Manager turns his
empty pockets, out in the face of his company. If they
never neglect to take their own salaries with exemplary
sºlarity, they are so sorry that others have to go with-
out !
Such a gifted man's impecuniosity may be no secret.
His every managerial venture may end in catastrophe;
And yet he has only, to hoist his banner and he will
always find an attached troop to march with him into the
jaws of bankruptcy.
I remember an Author once, whose pieces one of those
Machiavelian Managers was playing, and not paying for,
and who had long dunned him in vain, so vanquished by
his charming manner, that he burst out, “By Jove, I’d
rather have you play my piece for nothing, than get my
money for it from another Manager.” “My dear fellow,”
was the answer, with a genial shake of the hand-my
friend was immense in hand-shaking—“That is just the
spirit in which 1 like to be met!”
And that is the spirit in which such geniuses are met
all through their adventurous careers. And why? Because
however they chouse people, they always rub them the way
of the hair.
Like clever burglars, they, take impressions of every
body's keys in soft soap; and there is no resisting the
picklock of their “charming manner.”
On the other hand I have known Managers who were
strict men of business, active, attentive, models of punctu-
ality in payment, whose treasuries were never empty from
year's end to year's end. And yet because they rubbed
their Actors “against the hair,” snubbed them, trod on
the soft-corns of their self love, they were always in hot
water, and could never keep a company together.
Is it that the first consider their Actors less their
natural enemies than the second P -
No, but that they betray their true feelings. The wiser
man masks it under his charming manner, and so manage
his company, in the best sense of the word. ---
You never hear them denounced without the addition,
“but he is such a nice fellow.” -
The same rule, in essentials, should be followed with
Authors.
Always seem to be too busy to see anybody, an Author
more particularly.
Don’t trouble yourself to read MSS. or to return them.
You will be sure to have more pieces than you can
attend to from the people who live by writing for the
theatre.
Why should you waste your time on outsiders?, Really
actable pieces will be sure to find their way to the stage
somehow or other. -
If you feel it a duty to pay some attention to works of
this kind, you may always, for a few shillings extra salary
find a messenger who can read manuscript. You can call
him your secretary.
Or you may keep a taster, as the booksellers do.
There are many reduced Authors who would be thankful
for such employment. They will be certain not to pass too
lenient judgments on the works that come under their eye.

GEESE IN THE PARKS.
DURING the late frost the water-fowl in the Parks have been visited,
it seems, by a good, many geese; and several of these geese got a
ducking, it appears, through their venturing on the ice, which was not
strong enough to bear them:—
“The Long Water in Kensington Gardens is now completely frozen over, but the
ice is very dangerous. In spite of the printed cautions posted by order of MR.
Young, the Secretary, and MR. WILLIAMs, the Superintendent, some 50 or 60
persons went upon it: it suddenly gave way, and some of them fell into dee
water. ..." " " At the Round Pond, Kensington Gardens, a large crowd assemb
to see the skaters. The Royal Humane Society's men cautioned them against
venturing on the ice in large numbers, but they did so in vain. No fewer than 600
persons went on the ice. In all 40 persons fell in, and were saved by the Society's
icemen. " " " At St. James's Park the ice, owing to the snow, was very spongy.
About 150 persons, in spite of all the cautions of the Society's men, went upon it.
While they were amusing themselves, the ice gave way, and five persons fell in.
They, as well as the icemen, were much exhausted. About 12 o'clock seven other
rsons fell in, and they were also rescued by the icemen. One of them was so
ong under the ice that it was at first thought he was dying. About twenty other
persons fell in during the day.”
A step on unsafe ice must certainly, we think, be regarded as a goose:
step; and assuredly, these silly geese may thank their lucky stars if
they escaped with nothing worse than a bad cold from their ducking, or
perhaps a touch of rheumatism. One would say their heads were
cracked as well as the ice through which they floundered. But fools
rush in where icemen fear to tread, and it would serve them only right
if they were taken into custody, and carried off to Bow Street for
attempting suicide. - -
Skating is, however, not the only active pleasure which the Parks
afford in winter time, as the following will show :-
“Yesterday a large number of persons repaired to the Serpentine, in the expecta.
tion of seeing it covered with skaters, and were surprised that not a patch of ice a
foot long could be secn. The reason of this is entirely the high wind, and not the
temperature, for during Sunday night the thermometer at the Royal Humane
Society's Receiving-house in Hyde Park was as low as 234 deg. At 9 o'clock yester-
day morning the mercury rose no higher than 24 deg. In spite of the coldness of
the weather 20 persons yesterday took advantage of the absence of ico, and bathed
in the Surpentine.” -
A goose takes to the water in winter-time as well as summer, and in
this respect these bathers—or waders, in bird language—may be looked
upon as geese. But these geese were not such geese in point of silli.
ness as the others, for they did not tumble in and take a bath without
intending it, as the others did so foolishly, and risked their lives thereby.
Some people may think that out-door bathing in mid-winter is not a
wise proceeding; but the geese who went to bathe were wise compared
with those who went to slide and skate where they were safe—to
tumble in, and get a precious ducking. Indeed, if the bathers be
looked upon as geese, their wisdom, in comparison with the silliness of
the skaters, fully entitles them, we fancy, to be looked upon as geese of
the species called Solons.”
* Yes, we know it should be “Solan.” But people might not see the joke, if we
put the proper spelling. [Note intended to be read by naturalists only)
FRA DIAWOLO IN TAMBURINI.
HERE is the picture of a pretty ruffian for you:-
“TAMBURINI is the ideal of a brave brigand chief of Calabria, one of the most
handsome men imaginable. He is dressed in a rich velvet uniform, with silver
buttons and a silken waistband. He wears a picturesque hat, graced with flowing
plumes—he looks every inch a prince."
What a very fine robber, what a splendid thief, what a magnificent
cut-throat!, How smart a rogue, how gorgeous a rascal, how sumptu-
ously attired and gaily ornamented a villain The foregoing description
of “TAMBURINI” might be supposed to relate to the celebrated tenor
of that name, as he may have appeared in Fra Diavolo; it relates, how-
ever, to a Fra Diavolo of actual life, whose real name is TAMBURINI.

WHAT MRS. GRUNDY SAYS ABOUT THE
HELMET.
*A Rs. GRUNDy's kind regards
to Mr. Punch, and she can
no longer remain silent.
No wonder she is short-
tempered. Everybody talks
about her, but no woman is
less understood. It is all
very well for newspaper
writers to ask “What will
MRs. GRUNDY say?” but
it is high time she answered
that question herself. Now,
about these blessed Hel-
mets that have been stuck
on to the policemen's heads.
Did ever any silly body see
such stupid dish-covers?
She hopes and trusts the
oor fellows use them as
itchen utensils when they
; them home. They might
oil potatoes, or serve as
washhand basins, mouse-traps, or flower-pots, notwithstanding they are
the very worst of hats. They seem on a fat policeman's head like the
top stone of the Great Pyramid; while they cover up the lean ones as
completely as if they were modelled on the dome of St. Paul's.
Is_there no feeling for Art at Scotland Yard, or is it necessary that
the Human (X 32) Form Divine be rendered hideous as well as inso-
lent? Who would like to be “moved on ” by such an absurdity? A
noble classic Helmet, with vizor, ear flaps, and a highly ornamental cat
on top, would have been better; or if CoMMIssionER MAYNE is really
and truly wedded to ugliness, he need not have gone further than the
“pot-board” in his own back kitchen, the old iron saucepan is always
ready to his hand.
There, it serves him right, why did he not seek her aid, instead of
taking his own . obstinate way. She thinks if he had but asked
her opinion, she could have helped him a little. She has been turning
image of her glass mustard-pot, has only been replaced by new Police-
man X in his helmet, the picture of her pewter pepper-castor, she
looked up a few more domestic models.
The Beer-Jug, symbolic of the servant with whom the gallant officer
chats at the street corner;
The Flower-Pot, because it suggests nothing in particular;
The Dinner-Bell, to mark the emptiness of his head; and
he China Tea Saucer, as a hint of the shallowness of his brain.
But, after the Helmet, she washes her hands of the whole affair; and
while this frightful snail-shell is growing more and more common, she
sends you her designs, intentions, and indignation, to record what
might have been, and so dismiss the subject from her thoughts for ever.
Answered as Easy as saying Jack Robinson.
AN admirable Lawyer, well known in the Central Criminal Court, has,
on his elevation, “given rings” with the motto Er sese. Why has he
omitted the third CP

SHOPKEEPERS AND SERVANTS.
An Indignation Meeting was held the other evening at the Wheel of
Fortune Inn (the celebrated West End house of call for servants), to
consider the system of -per-centages from tradespeople, which has
lately been attacked. MR X, FLUNKY, the landlord of the hostelry,
having been unanimously voted to the chair, the business of the meeting
was begun by his proposing to stand shilling glasses round. The
offer having been accepted, and the toast, “Success to Plush,” having
duly been responded to, -
The Chairman rose to explain the purport of the meeting, which, he
said, was to consider a “suckler” (query, circular?) that had lately
been sent round by His Grace the Duke of SUTHERLAND, prohibiting
his tradesmen from giving bribes. (A voice, “No / no / per-centages /*
He begged pardon, yes, per-centages to the gentlemen in his, the
Duke of SUTHERLAND's employ, and, no doubt, the ladies also

hairman, must stigmatise as “low,” not to call it “wile and wulgar,”
and if he even said “disgustink” (hear /) he should not be employing
much too strong a word. (“Not a bit/’’) He had, as his friends
knew, been a servant once himself, and had stood behind a chair, as
had also a distinguished friend of hisn, MR. JEAMEs PLUsh, which
had likewise been a nob and privileged to sit in one. _ (Immense Cheers.)

MR. PHUNKY said that he had known MR. JEAMEs Plush at the
period, alluded to, in fact he (MR, PHUNKy) had had the honour to
stand behind him at the table of their mutual friend the EARL of BARE-
AcREs, when MR. PLUSH came a courting the LADY HANGELINA, the
daughter of the Earl. He could certify the truth of what, the Chair-
man had observed, for, though a “leetle 'igh and 'aughty,” MR.
PLUsh in his prosperity was never mean and screwy, and never
interfered with per-centages, and perquisites and other lawful servants'
rights. (Cheers.) -
MR. Corks remarked that he had lived as butler to the noble Earl
aforesaid, who was as poor a nobleman as you’d wish not to see. But
if the Earl had dared to stop his (MR. CoRK's) P.": he (MR. C.)
would not have stopped to take care of his Lordship's cellar, he was

MR. Chawles said his custom was, on entering a new place, to go
round to all the shops where the family had been dealing, and state
plainly what his terms were for continuing the patronage, which it was,
of course, within his power to prevent. He believed this was the
usual course pursued by servants (yes / yes /), and it had usually the
effect of frightening the tradesmen into yielding to their terms. This
wholesome fear might fail to operate, however, if gentlemen sent

THE HUMBLE PIETY OF THE POPE.
His Holiness the Pope does not smoke cigars: a lot of cigars were sent him the
other day from Havannah, and he gave them all to GENERAL Montebello;
at least so the Temps says. Pio NoNo might as well have sent a box of them, with
his benediction, to, SIR GEORGE Bowyer, and another to Punch. well, but
although the Hºly Father smokes not cigars, perhaps he smokes a pipe, and we may
with the eye of º: the pretended Head of the Church behind
a “churchwarden.”. The Pope may smoke a meerschaum, though the occasional
phenomenon of a winking image appears to show that he does not smoke a mere
sham. But if his Holiness does smoke any kind of pipe, let him put the subjoined
telegram, received the other day by MR. Reuten from Paris, in his pipe and
smoke it :-
“Monsignore Chigi, the Papal Nuncio, has had an andience of the EMPERoR. His Eminence
expressed his regret at the publicity given to the private letters addressed by him to the
Bishops of Orleans and Poictiers. He assured his Majesty that he was fully sensible of the
duties imposed upon him by the diplomatic character of his mission, and had never any
intention of failing in respect to the rules of international law."
Pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink!...So, to com-
parative and fanciful ears, sounds the cry of the little cur under chastisement. So
also, CHIGI, found out in writing mischievous letters, may be considered as crying
“Pen-and-ink.” . Unwhipped, and only cowering in the fright of detection, he
cries Pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink, pen-and-ink—peccavi 2 Notwith-
standing, however, that his pen-and-ink and peccavi must
have been believed by the Imperial foréador to the Pope s
Bull to mean, not any repentance of treachery perpetrated
with ink and pen, but only grief at being found out in it,
CHIGI did not receive anything unpleasant from the foot
which he attempted to lick, and according to the authority
quoted above:-
C “The EMPERoR graciously received the explanation of Mossignore
III.G.I.”
.The explanation, consisting of pen-and-ink and peccari,
i. by Monsignore CuIGI of his detected correspon-
ence, was of course dictated from head-quarters, those
which a French army of occupation will perhaps shortly
evacuate. The Pope, we learn from the Tablet, continues
to enjoy good health...We are glad to hear it. ...We hope
the papal digestion will remain unimpaired by the humble
pie which it has had to deal with.
ODE TO BUSINESS.
O BUSINEss, thou art Business!
Whene'er I breathe thy name
Awe strikes my brain with dizziness,
And chills my shivering frame.
Thy glory is too glorious
or language to define;
O'er victors most victorious
The victory is thine.
See Tyre and Sidon now no more,
And Venice no more free;
Yet still *{ Britons thee adore:
Thy Yankees worship thee.
Before § form º
The dollar, they did bow,
But, for thine images, content
Themselves with greenbacks now.
Perish Savoy and perish Nice,
Poland and Denmark too,
If less of thee, for broken peace,
'Tis likely we shall do!
And how, except for thee, to take
Up arms, can England need?
Who, ever, but for thy dear sake,
Would have his country bleed P
The painter's and the sculptor's art
The Wirtues have displayed;
Thou, chosen for the better Jº,
Hast never been portrayed.
But, high on England's altar placed,
Thy statue should appear,
With apron tied around its waist,
Pen stuck behind its ear.
Make Him a Peer.
HAVING finished his Iliad,
And ceased to be busy,
Loko DERby should try
And translate his Odd-Dizzy.
ExPRESS FROM THE KITCHEN.
MARY thanks the Milkman for his Walentine. She knew
it was from him, because it was written on the best cream-
laid. Her feelings tally with his.

SPORTING - INTELLIGENCE.
(Erclusively reported for the Drawing Room.)
February.—In this month, house-hunting commences. Heir 'unting
will begin as early as possible in the ensuing Season. Cards of invita-
tion .# be issued as usual for all the best evening meets.
THE RING.
(Secretary’s Office at the Clerk's house, St. George's, Hanover Square.)
MRs. A. D.VENCHER has got a novice, to be brought out this Season,
whom she will be glad to match against an eligible young man from
the country for £60,000 a side (i.e., on his side). -
Miss PRIscILLA DE SQUINcy, (the Cheltenham No-Chicken) has
been waiting for some considerable time in expectation of hearing from
CAPTAIN GRIGG (the Knowing Nobbler). Is it to be a match, or not ?
Address as above, Curl Lodge, False Row, Cheltenham.
GALLANT FIGHT BETWEEN THE PRETTY PET AND THE DEEP 'UN.
It is needless for us to record the previous exploits of this well-
matched pair. Miss FANNY FLYRTE, alias the Pretty Pet, has already
won several battles, and CAPTAIN DEUXTEMPs is no novice in all affairs
connected with the Ring. It was expected, indeed, that he would be
the victor. The affair came off in a well-known fashionable drawing-
room, and was witnessed by a large and distinguished circle of patrons.
Round 1. The Pet came up smiling. The Deep.'un confident.
There was some pretty sparring for about two minutes, previous to
going in for the real work of the round. (Guards' Waltz) The Pet
threw out a feeler to ask him why he had been looking so cross all the
evening. The Deep-'un countered this º º remarking that it was
impossible for him to appear happy, while s d nothing but talk to
what's-his-name—STUDLYNx. Some nasty hitting. -
Round 2. (Guards' Waltz continued.). Both more serious. The Pet
managed to lead the fighting, towards her own corner, where, she
cleverly got down on a vacant chair, and was immediately attended by
her experienced second and her judicious trainer.
Round 3... (Quadrille.) Both cautiously, eyeing one another from
their respective corners. Nothing done. A sit out.
Round 4. (Schottische.) The Deep'un going round and round, keeping
Notice.—A great Tea Fight will shortly come off. There will only be
a certain number of Rounds, and those, as usual, of Toast. For further
particulars apply at the office of the Redord.
MR. PIVER, of Regent Street, begs, to announce that he has a fine
assortment of Gloves on hand for Pugilistic Drawing-Room parties.
INTERFERENCE OF THE LAW.—MiLL STOPPED.
. SAMUEL SQUABBLE (the Grumbler) and, MRs. SQUABBLE (the Wexa-
tious Wixen) met for the fortieth time last week. After some ugly
exchanges, and much awkward encountering, they were separated #
JUDGE WILDE.
BREACH OF PROMISE FOR THE MILLION.
Two actions for breach of promise of marriage within a week;
damages, £2,000 in each; in one case against a paralysed cripple.
Comment is superfluous, and would be hazardous, made without con-
sideration of the possibility of an action for libel, tried by a British
Jury and LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE Cockburn.
. But all heavy damages, awarded by British Juries instructed by the
simply legal mind of Judges, why should the superior and middle class
of females alone, engross? Is the jilted working woman to have no
remedy against the capricious working man? As it is, a disappointed
milliner-girl is practically denied compensation for her º hopes
at the hand of a fickle and unprincipled small tradesman
Surely Load WESTBURY will see the necessity of immediately pro-
posing a Bill to enable actions for breach of promise of marriage to be
tried in County Courts, so that a forsaken young laundress may get her
twenty pounds out of a faithless and decrepit old costermonger.
But even this will not suffice for the demand of even handed justice.
Magistrates ought, in all reason, to be empowered to adjudicate sum-
marily on the non-fulfilment of matrimonial engagements by persons of
the poorer classes, whose victims cannot afford to go to law at all.
Then a deserted village maiden would be enabled to extract the com-
pensation due to her crushed affections, out of the pocket of a faithless
old, shepherd of seventy in the employment of a farmer at nine
shillings a week, and MR. Looney º TwoLTER, of Seven Dials
that grey-headed old blackguard, might be taught, by bein compelled
to fork out five shillings, what it was to trifle with the tender feelings
his eyes fixed on the Pet, who showed no signs of moving. The of sweet seventeen, embodied in the interesting person of Miss Judy
Deep'un slipped, and went down *...; by the fire-place.
laughed merrily. Deep'un discomfited, retired to his corner.
Rounds 5, 6, 7, Nothing done; merely, tiring out each other's
patience. The Pet, doubtless acting upon the advice of her trainer,
appeared to be reserving herself for some great effort.
Round 8. (Burlesque Galop) Qn again coming up to the scratch, the
Pet certainly seemed to be the fresher of the two. This time they set
to work in earnest. The Pet, in the course of a sharp, rattling round,
planting two, blows in the region, of the Deep'un's heart, which
evidently told severely. The Deep'un threw out his left, which was
dexterously º: by the Pet's right. This was followed by a strong
grapple, and a sharp telling return in each other's eyes. This was a
*...}}}. round.
und 9, (Burlesque Galop continued.) Both sparring for wind. After
a quick round of merry exchanges, the Deep'un and Pet both went
down together—to supper.
Round 10. (Supper Room.) Enough work to keep the hands well at it.
A cry of fowl was raised for the Pet, but not allowed. The flirtation
now became very yiolent; the Pet and Deep'un doing all they knew.
The Pet, with a view to bring matters to a crisis, but, as we imagine,
contrary to the wishes of her trainer, led the fighting up towards a
quiet corner.
Round 11. (In a dimly-lighted Conservatory.) Short and decisive. The
Deep'un, after some pretty exchanges, went down on one knee.
this position he made an offer, but just as the Pet was about to close
with him, the authorities, who had been dodged for some time, suddenly
appeared on the spot, and put an end to the engagement for the present.
A meeting, however, has since been arranged, whereof the particulars
must, for obvious reasons, be kept dark.
KITTY SPRIGHTLY (THE LADY'S MAID KITTEN) AND FRED. Row ER
(THE AMATEUR).
During a private theatrical performance, a merry little mill came off
between these two ſº on the Landing Place the other evening.
The Amateur closed for a second with the Kitten, who briskly shook
him off. The Amateur then made another and more successful attempt,
but was countered ...} by the Kitten on the auricular. . In a subse-
quent round he succeeded in getting one on the Kitten's kissing trap,
who, however, got away cleverly. - -
We saw the Ämateur afterwards. He was suſtering from a pair of
black eyes, but in other respects did not appear one whit the worse.
The Kitten, on leaving the landing, also had a pair of black eyes, and
took away with her, over her upper lip, a nasty black mark left there by
the Amateur, who, it is conjectured, is in the habit of using black cos-
metique for his moustache.

It is not generally known that the country in India, about which
there was some obscurity in the QUEEN’s Speech, is remarkable for its
Bhootanical Gardens.
W. M. THACKERAY.
The readers of Punch will scarcely regard as unacceptable anything
connected with the memory of one who was so long their friend.
An imputation of an unworthy kind has appeared in the columns of
the Athenaeum, and it has been answered. That the amplest publicity
may be given to the falsehood and to its refutation, we transfer to Qur
|.." pages the following extract from the Athenaeum of Saturday
ast :–
“In reply to the Correspondent who inquired “How it has happened that BARon
MARochetti, although a Member of the Committee appointed to carry out the
arrangements for a memorial to THACKERAY, has received the commission to execute
that memorial,' Mr. Shirley BRooks, the honorary secretary to the undertaking,
requests leave to state ‘that the allegation of the correspondent in question is
simply and absolutely untruthful. That BARoS MARochetti is not and never was
a Member of that Committee; is personally unknown to all its members, and was
merely, in common with MEssBs. DURHAM, Foley, and Munho, among the seventy-
four gentlemen whose names were attached to the memorial to the DEAN of West-
MINstER for permission to erect the monument. That BARoN MARochetti's conduct
in reference to the work has been of the most liberal and honourable character, and
finally, that it would not have been thought worth while to offer this explanation,
but for the Correspondent's letter having been thought worth an editorial intro-
duction.'"

“Recently, at a Ball in Paris, a Russian lady adopted
the emblems of the peacock, and every ornament and
article of dress brought to mind the glittering colours
and shining plumes of Juno's bird...The dress was of
white tulle, embroidered all over with Argus' eyes. A
tunic, reaching from the waist to a little below the knee,
was composed of striped velvet, recalling the colours of
the peacock; bunches of peacocks' feathers everywhere,
held together by bouquets of emcralds and diamonds.
A peacock, perfect in form, shapo, and colour, adorned
her forehead. The ornament was composed entirely of
the finest brilliants and emeralds, the neck of the bird,
with its crest, being formed of the most splendid sap-
phires. The whole was most curious and striking."

aw
English heart. Mr. Punch, while delighted at the Abolition of
ery, begs to
remark to LoBD RUSSELL, that it would have been as much to the purpose to say

the state of the Marriage Laws in the
The §. issues a Commission to inquire into
nited Kingdom. Some of these days we
shall have legislation on the subject, and then people will have a chance of knowing
whether they are really married or not.
Also, a Bill has been introduced for enabling criminals to
be hanged in prison by special licence. A coroner's jury
is proposed, and a certificate of the performance of the
ceremony is to be granted.
In the Bride of Lammermoor, if any remains of a certain
feast were totally uneatable, they were to be given to the
poor. The remains of to-night, were similarly bestowed,
and persons interested in the subject will understand what
Government proposes when Mr. Punch mentions that the
area of charge is to be extended from the Parish to the
Union. The change is chiefly to be approved because it
tends to the future abolition of the system of settlement,
which cheats the ratepayer, and is cruel to the pauper.
Tuesday. The CHANCELLOR proposed to get rid of some
Chancery business. He brings in a Bill placing small
estates under the care of the County Courts. He also
means to advise the Judges of those remarkable tribunals
of rough justice to make orders for payment of debts by
weekly instead of monthly instalments. He means to intro-
duce a new Statute of Limitations, and to abolish all power
of recovering debts for intoxicating liquors supplied on
the premises. The British institution known as “chalking
it up” will be done away, and a new light will be thrown
on the saying, “walk your chalks.”
Well done, the Commons. Some people in Cheltenham
and thereabouts have got up a Water Company, and come
to Parliament for power to take the fluid from the springs
that supply the Thames. They would “rob the river,”
as Mºś-º. we hereby raise to the Peerage,

threw out the Bill by 118 to 88. Let the old frumps of
Cheltenham drink the Cheltenham waters, which they
are always puffing so furiously.
That Wimbledon business occasioned a smart debate. It
seems that LoRD SPENGER's proposal to limit, civilise, and
rail in the Common, does not meet with the universal
adulation that was expected, and for which the cue was
so confidently given when the scheme was first broached.
A Committee of Inquiry on that matter, and similar ones,
was agreed to. t was allowed, however, that LoRD

he said was §§ ill, and he advised alterations in the system. LoRD
HARTINGTON said that it was going on very well, indeed. NUMscully
advised Irishmen to keep out of the QUEEN's Army—we are by no
means sure that the advice was not high treason, and we request SIR
RoundELL PALMER to consider whether he cannot hang NUMSCULLY.
MR, WHALLEY, talked as idiotically, on the other side, declaring that
the Catholic soldiers were not to be trusted, as they owed allegiance to
the Pope. We amend our last suggestion by requesting SIR. Roun-
DELL to consider whether he cannot tie Scully and WHALLEY
together and hang them over a line, as the German soldiers used to do
with the poor cats. Papist soldiers not fight for the QUEEN' Read
NAPIER, MR, WHALLEY, if you are capable of reading anything but
Railway reports and Protestant tracts.
Then we had some exceeding good sense from LoRD STANLEY. M.R.
ADDERLEY brought up the question of the local African Establishments,
which he condemned as utterly useless, and as hotbeds of disease.
After some debate, Lord STANLEY, who is the son of the statesman
who carried the extinction of our own colonial slavery, declared that
the African squadron ought to be a thing of the past, that we owed
nothing to Africa, that the cost of our sea-police for the benefit of the
blacks (whom we did not benefit) was very great, and that if we wanted
to spend a million a }.} in civilising savages, there was a population
within five miles of the House of Commons that stood as much in need
of civilisation as the Africans, and had been quite as much neglected.
Mr. Punch's cheer was loud. MR. CARDwell had a weak little
official answer, but we may look out for a grand flourish from Lord
PALMERSTON one of these nights, in support of the squadron; Never-
theless the truth hath been spoken, and will eventually prevail.
Nearly everybody having left the House—there being no Govern- If
ment except MR. BRAND, and no Opposition at all, MR. BAINEs came
in with his Reform Bill, for lowering the borough, franchise from £10
to £6. There will be a fuller House before the Bill passes.
Hednesday. A Bill, aimed at folks who vexatiously obstruct private
Bills, in the hope of being paid to go º: like the organ scoundrels,
was committed. The object was to saddle such persons with costs.
But there is also legitimate opposition to many schemes, and the House
is not inclined to let everything be carried with a high hand, merely
because a company is got together, and a flaming prospectus declares
that its object is to do the ºnly thing wanting to restore the Golden
Age, and to .# on the Millennium. The advice which was bestowed
by the aged gentleman who possessed an sº cow, for whom he found
it difficult, to provide food, is advice which we should always tender,
respectfully, to the Commons, when asked to be arbitrary :—
“He pulled out his fiddle, and played her a tune,
‘Consider, old cow, consider.’”
MR. DENMAN has a Bill for assimilating the criminal and civil practice
of summing up, by counsel. Also, for enabling parties, when a witness
swears differently on two occasions, to show that on one or the other
he must have been perjured. We are gradually breaking down one
after another of the mischievous old fences which Old Father Antic
has set up to prevent our getting at truth. Some day or other we
shall attain the extraordinary length of asking a man, who is all
but convicted of having been engaged in a murder at a certain
twelve o'clock, to be good enough to say where he really was at that
time. At present, of course, there would be an indignant shout.
“Oh, you must not ask him that. He might have been engaged at
that time on a burglary, or beating his wife, and no Englishman is
bound to criminate himself.”
Thursday. Hamilton Place is to be cut through. MR. CowPER said
that the Metropolitan Board was too timid about providing useful and
efficient thoroughfares. ...Now, if even, the gentle Cowper charges
the Board with cowardice, their pusillanimity must be something
extraordinary.
The Temple of Justice—(no, not Janus, Mr. Compositor, none of
your irony against a single-minded profession) is to be raised on the
Carey Street site, and the lawyers, who have hitherto resembled
ÇAREY’s CHICKENs only because they come in storm-time, will have a
double right to the name. LoRD MACAULAY says of somebody, that he had
a double right to be a liar, because he was both a traveller and a Jesuit.
And well said, MR. Roi.T. He hoped that some access to the New
Courts from the Temple would be provided, without compellin
persons to cross the crowded street of the Fleet. We should thin
so. We forget what tragedian used to make such long pauses in
Hamlet, that when he came on for the celebrated Toby or not Toby
speech, and halted at “question,” you had time to run over from old
Drury to the Albion, get a Welsh rarebit and a glass of beer, and come
back in time for “Whether;” but we believe that even a Chancery
suit might be heard, at the º accelerated rate, while an elderly
jerson, standing on the south side of the Strand, could decide whether
e would risk being run over by a railway yan, a hansom, an Embank-
ment slush cart, a costermonger, a banker's carriage, a brewer's dray,
or. Her Majesty's mail-cart. The ATToRNEY-GENERAL said that the

tº inade.
The Bank Notes Issue Bill, whereof we spoke to Materfamilias
the country banker's wife, and to the young ladies, was read a Second
Time, and will pass, so Papa has no excuse whatever, for not giving
those parties. It will be an awful good thing for him, this will, so
don't let him talk any nonsense and mystification to you, my dears.
To-day the great Cardinal was buried, and with him are buried all
the long dead, bitternesses touching the great quarrel, which, how-
ever, England is prepared to renew with any of his successors who may
believe that because, irritation over, we are good-natured and indulgent
about ecclesiastical arrangements, England has any toleration for
Priestly rule, Catholic or Protestant. But nothing save respect was
manifested as the long funeral of CARDINAL Wise MAN blackened all
the way. Requiescat.
Friday. LoRD WESTBURY introduced his new plan for rewarding
attorneys, instead of leaving them to pay themselves by awful verbiage,
He legalises a bargain between solicitor and client. As soon as the
Bill passes, Mr. Punch intends to call on a most eminent firm, and offer
them some handsome price—say a set of his volumes—iſ, by the 1st of
April, 1866, they put him in possession of some nobleman's estate—any
One they can get, but the Southern counties preferred. If they do not
succeed, there is an end.
. The Commons, after a sharpish debate, pitched out a Liverpool Bill
intended to regulate the fivºmääian'ſſiblic houses. There may be
local reasons for the measure, but “good reasons must, perforce, give
way to better.” The Liverpool Magistrates appear to be Arbitrary
Coves, and to have no definite principles of action.
We then had another Irish debate. Ireland has, up to the present
date, monopolised exactly four-fifths of the debates since the Houses met.
ours is the Irish Parliament, why don’t we hold it in Dublin? The
debate to-night, however, was not a vulgar howl, but a discussion,
originated by MR. HENNessy, into the causes of the decline of the
population of Ireland. He wished—the Irish always do—for Govern-
ment aid. . The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER answered him, on
general principles, and declined to depart from the course prescribed by
true political economy: “Help yourself,” is the great rule of life, to
which, however, Mr. Punch invariably adds, “and pass the bottle.”
CARRIAGES FOR NON-SMOKERS WANTED.
DEAR PUNch, - -
I AM fond of a cigar, and I like to smoke when travelling, if
only for the fact that one has nothing else to do. ...Besides, I find
tobacco soothing to the nerves; and, as accidents will happen on the
best-regulated railways, it is a comfort to have something to kee
oneself from thinking of them, and from shaking in one's shoes. Still,
I know I am a nuisance every time I smoke, at least if I do so in a
first-class carriage, where the stuffy fluffy cushions are certain to retain
the smell of my cigar, and thereby to offend the noses of the sensible,
who, as I do, hate stale stinks. Sitting, in smoked carriages is nasty
enough for men who are not over nice, but it is ever so much nastier
for ladies who are nice, as every lady ought to be. Their skirts are
more voluminous than the clothing of a man, and more retentive of the
smoke with which, by contact with the cushions, they are rapidly
º: - -
hen, imagine what a nuisance it must be to a lady who is ſº a
concert, or to pay a morning call, to have to ride in a smoked carriage,
and feel conscious when she quits it that her dress, bears in its folds
the flavour of a tap-room. I declare I often shudder, while enjoying
my cigar, to think what pretty noses may be turned up in disgust at it,
and what pretty cheeks may redden from the consciousness of clothing
perfumed with tobacco-smoke, which is sure to be detected by one's
dear friends in a drawing-room. But what am I to do? The directors
will not charter smoking carriages enough to accommodate all smokers,
and if I refrain from smoking, some one else is sure to smoke, for the
rule is now to do so, and non-smokers are exceptions.
Instead then of supplying a few carriages for smokers, I think that
the directors should keep some for non-smokers. A man who does not
smoke is generally now in a minority of one, when the point “to smoke
or not to smoke” is publicly debated. Let special carriages be fur;
nished where no smoking is allowed, and smokers would take special
care never to go into them. But while smokers are penned up in one
hot, close, stuffy carriage, like a lot of unclean beasts, they will of course
invade any carriage that is open to them, and, regardless of the fine,
infringe the law against tobacco. -
lf you will only help to settle the smoke question by the plan which
I suggest, of having special carriages provided for non-smokers, I
will gratefully offer a burnt-sacrifice in honour of you every time I
travel, and I doubt not there are millions in these piping times of ours
who will gladly do the same.
remain, Sir, yours admiringly,
PETER PUFF.
P.S. Was ARIstoph ANEs a smoker, do you think? You know he
wrote about the Clouds. t

UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE.
MEMORABLE in the annals of music is the celebrated contest about
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, which ended in the utter discomfiture of
r little Tweedledee, who, for aught we know, entered a Convent of
}. Twiddleumtwees, as Sister Tweedledumb, and has been
heard no more. Piece of Music be to her, without variations. Re-
wiescat, even through all the bars of a Convent Cell ? And now, what
as this to do with a University? This, namely, that the other day
at Oxford (Wide Times, Feb. 24th), the Dons, assembled in a solemn
Congregation holden to consider the Local Examination Statute, spent
the greater portion of their valuable time in a debate concerning the
words “tum, tum.” The condensed reports of our serious contem-
poraries did not at the time give sufficient prominence to the laudable
attempts made by several eminent Professors to introduce a sing-song
tone into the lively discussions of their learned body.
The great question, imported into this debate, was whether, on the
entrance of the Vice CHANCELLOR, the Heads of Houses should all
stand up, and, led by the Junior Proctor, his ºf the melody,
should sing, to the tune of “See the Conquering Hero,” the following
paean :-
(Con spirito) “ Tum tum ti tum ti
Tiddle liddle lum tum tw-um
Affetuoso) Tiddle liddle lum tum tun ti
Bene marcato) Tum tum tum titum !”
The Junior Proctor objected to the introduction of MR. LIDDELL’s
name into the yerse. He did not approve of personal allusions.
The Senior Proctor wished to inquire what was meant in this instance
by a personal allusion ?
The Junior Proctor thought that
“Tiddle liddle tum tum tum.”
contained an animadversion on that respectable and worthy member of
the University. He begged to move that after “tiddle” the word
“liddle” be removed from the text.
The motion was put, and carried by a majority of ten. -
The word “iddle” was then substituted amidst much cheering.
PROFESSOR RAWLIN’son wished to make another amendment. He
roposed the omission of the initial and final tum. He thought the whole
# rce of the verse would be lost if “ Tum-tum” should be retained.
DR. Pusey saw no hardship in keeping the form as it stood. He
considered the words to imply that religious education was compulsory.
He didn’t, like these changes. When he was a young man, the refrain
of more than one song that he knew was “Ri tooral looral looral.”
Why should they not retarn to “Ri tooral looral?” . The Venerable
Doctor concluded a lengthy speech by saying that in this form he would
be most i. to support the amendment with his (DR. PUSEY's)
“Ri tooral loolral looral looral liddy fol looral ritol looral li do.”
The members immediately resolved themselves into a chorus of the
whole house, and owing to a general ignorance of the tune and time to
which the Doctor's words were to be set, speedily arrived at a conclusion.
The Master of Balliol was of opinion that i. words tum tum only
gave a pre-eminence to the subject of controversy. The once popular
melody “Lubly Rosa”, was founded upon an old Puritan hymn tune.
He objected to Puritanism, and was afraid that the adoption of tum tum
would needlessly rekindle the dying embers of old world party spirits.
The Regius Professor of Bye Laws and Regulations wanted to know if
the last speaker could lº. to which reference hadjust been made?
The Master of Balliol said he couldn't sing without music. But, on
being provided with a banjo, he at once º: up in his clear mellifluous
Wolce
Olce, “Lubly Rosa, SAMBo come,
Don't you hear the banjo
With a tum tum tum."
The Master then went on to express a wish as to his being jiggered
if he didn't entertain sentiments of the most profound affection for the
lovely Rosa. The speaker resumed his seat amid some applause.
PROFEssoR BURRows thought tum tum ambiguous.
The Master of Merton rose to ask whether his College, out of
respect to a juvenile literary institution, was ever #."; to be called
Sandford and Merton College & . On , being reminded that this had
nothing to do with the question, he said he thought that “tum tum.”
ought to be abandoned.
The Dean of Christchurch rose to express his horror at hearing that
anything should be “abandoned” in that assembly. What did the
Master of Merton mean by it? - -
The Master of Merton rose to explain. He didn't mean what he
(the Dean) meant. He meant something else. He wasn’tFº to
support the amendment. But he meant, or rather he should say he had
meant, or perhaps it might be better expressed by saying that that was
his meaning. On reconsideration, he didn't think he meant anything:
The Juniorest Proctor present then put the question. Would the
original mover of the resolution (DR. Portly) press “tum tum” in its
present form, or not?
DR. Portly, University Professor of Medicine, said he felt some
pain in doing so. He was not astonished at their scruples. It was his
department to deal with them.
he Vice-Chancellor begged pardon, for the interruption. On refer-
"|ring to the minutes, he found that it was five o'clock-just time for
Hall. Dinner was a necessity. Every one in that assembly was like
the Great Poet—“not for an age, but for Hall time.” He proposed that
the various bills of fare should be laid upon the table. The Proctors
would collect votes.
Out of a Congregation of forty members, the numbers were for the
Vice-Chancellor’s motion— - -
Placets 39; Non-placet 1 (who was going to dine out at 7).
The House was then dissolved.

A VERY (IM)PERTINENT DOCKYARD QUERY.
THERE is a “standing-head” in the º papers called “Admi-
ralty Intelligence.” Mr. Punch would be glad to know whether the
following paragraph, which appeared under this head a short time ago
records a piece of “Admiralty intelligence.” He would call it a recor
of “Admiralty stupidity:”—
“The enormous sheer-legs, made of masses of angle and plate iron, and intended
to form the 40-ton hoist at the head of the inner fitting basin in Woolwich Dock-
yard, will probably be erected to-day. Its transport by Bray's traction-engine was
witnessed by the various officers of the yard, and many other persons. ...The ques-
tion was frequently raised, “Why has the Admiralty sanctioned the outlay, stated
to be £2,000 for new sheers, while a crane of equal capacity, and similar manufac-
ture, received a short time ago, is lying unemployed in its shed?’”

“Ed,” of course; but out-of-doors Echo, not having. º Views on

He also added several others College text-books were written in that Asylum, and
that one of the leading newspapers in New York is principally edited in that insti-
tution, the leading editorial being written three or four times a week by a person
of unsound mind under confinement."
Punch knows now why,"Uncle SAM” has º persisted in sayin
that we didn't understand his institutions; so will all who have rea
the above; but, “Uncle SAM" has only been partly right, for though
Mr. P. did not know that * of the New York editors were under

ought to be.

REFORMATORY RIGOUR.
oRTHY MR PUNCH,-With a
view to the rather desirable
object of preyenting young
pickpockets from growing
into confirmed thieves, what
think you of the discipline
maintained at Reformatories,
supposing a specimen of it to
have been disclosed in the
subjoined extract from a letter
written home by an inmate of
one of those establishments?—
“I hope you enjoyed yourself
at Christmas, as I did and all our
school-fellows. We had roast beef
and plum pudding for dinner, as
much as we could eat, and we all
sat round the fireside, and sung
and danced, and dressed our room
with holly. We did enjoy our-
selves. I should like one of you
to come if it lay in your power,
which it does not. You would not
know what the place was without
being told ; it looks like a private
house. We took our band out at
Christmas and played; a lady gave
us a supper. e had plenty of
roast mutton, and got home at ll
o'clock.”
Not bad for an inmate of a
Reformatory, eh? Not a bad
sample of letter-writing; not
bad Christmas fare and en-
tertainment narrated therein.
By no means bad, the beef,
and º: and mutton,
and the merrymaking even;
not at all bad, any of it, in
any sense of the word—per-
haps you will say. For you,
ºn Mr. Punch, with your fine
- - - - - perception of differences, will
distinguish between reformatory schooling and penal servitude.
This distinction, however, seems to have been rather overlooked by “A Country
WIgAR,” who sends, the foregoing quotation, to the Times, wherein it appears
under the heading of “A Pleasant Discipline.” The Vicar considers the discipline of
Él. Christmas far too pleasant for a Reformatory, and deprecates it as
Ollows:-
“May we not imagine how some poor half-starved, hopeless child of sin, hearing of such
delights, might think it no bad speculation to qualify for so much roast beef and plum pudding?
One small theft would seem to him an easier and shorter path to that to which even a long
continuance in well-doing might scarcely lead.”
Very likely. What then? A “half-starved hopeless child of sin” must needs
be incapable of º “continuance” in well-doing:, but he is capable of discon-
tinuance in doing ill, and which will he do least ill by doing; to commit one theſt
more for the purpose of getting admitted into a Reformatory, or to go on thieving
in order that he may manage to subsist half-starved until at last, perhaps, he comes
to be hanged?
The “Country Wicak” concludes with the following serious and sarcastic
reflection: –
"Surely a sense of sin and shame, and a certain amount of suffering, should not be forgotten
amid so much fun in the work of reformation.”
Well; all Reformatories are supposed to be provided with a parson, who
preaches to their inmates on Sundays and festivals. He would of course preach
them a special sermon on Christmas Day, and a “sense of sin” would hardly be
“forgotten,” iſ, in his discourse, the reverend gentleman explained the reason why |b
that anniversary is celebrated, any more than it would be forgotten by a Bishop
preaching to a fashionable, congregation of “miserable sinners.” But % you con-
sider, Mr. Punch, that reclaimed street-urchins in a Reformatory, who have never
been taught to know sin from sanctity till they came there, require to be impre:
with a deeper sense of sin than the educated occupants of a luxurious pew And
is it your opinion that juvenile offenders reared in poverty and ignorance, ought to
be visited with a sense of “shame” for their misdeeds more grievous than that
which affects adult transgressors of the superior classes P
As to “suffering,” Sir, if I mistake not, children at Reformatories are in no
want of experience. A not uncommon incident of their purgation is a severe
whipping. For misbehaviour of no ſº enormity they are often *: savagely
y a strong man with a birch rod. Ought “a certain amount of suffering,”
beyond that which necessarily attends all education, to be the rule of their existence
even on Christmas Day? Why, yes, Sir, if they are to be educated in bitter hatred
of their teachers and tormentors and Society at large.
- - - If the contrary, object is
intended, then the way, which you will perhaps consider best calculated to effect
appear to you, Mr. Punch, that “A Country WICAR”
commits the somewhat clerical error of confounding the
notion of a Reformatory with that of a House of Cor-
rection. Psychology has doubtless taught you that a
necessary condition to the development, of good, feeling
is kind treatment, and you will probably allow that the
distinction, between reformation and P. is one
that is made by strict common sense and not by mere
MAWKISH SENTIMENT.
ENORMOUS REDUCTION IN THE NAWAL
ESTIMATES.
THERE has been a good deal said, out of doors, as to the
prospect of important reductions in our naval and military
expenditure this year. , Some say we are to have it, some
say we are not. We don't know what the War Office is
doing, but the Admiralty is evidently straining every nerve
to save the public money; Let, those who dare to doubt
the fact, read this, and blush for their cynical scepticism:-
“A few days ago some of the dockyard men were ordered to
assist one of the contractors in a work which it was necessary to
complete a early as possible, and as a requital for their extra labours
the sum of 5s. each was allotted to them, and deducted from the
contract payment. After a lapse of some days the men complained
of not having received their money. As an explanation of the cause
of the delay, it was alleged that the Paymaster had not been able to
calculate the amount of Income-Tax which it would be necessary to
deduct. The men were finally paid 4s. 113 d. each a farthing having
been withheld from each amount.”
...There! what do you say to that? That’s something
like saving ! sº let us calculate it carefully. Say
twelve men, at a farthing a man; why it’s actually three-
pence saved to the country out of a three pound job-
exactly a penny in the pound. To small minds this may
seem a small result of several days' intense arithmetical
labour in the Paymaster's office, and several days' angry
waiting for their money by the dockyard “maties;” but let
sneerers and scoffers remember the proverb, “Take care
of the pence.” Hitherto, the Admiralty has allowed both
the pence and the pounds to take care of themselves, and
the result has not been satisfactory in the case of currency
of either denomination. The pounds got lost, evidently
because they wanted somebody to take care of the pence.
But now that the DUKE or SoMERSET has begun to take
care of the Admiralty pence, let us hope the Admiralty
pounds will begin to take care of themselves. -
MR. GLADston E, when he read the above startling item
of naval intelligence, is reported to have had an attack of
hysterics, and to have wept so loud that MR. ANDERSON
and MR. G. HAMILTON rushed into his room, and dashed in
his face the contents of the official hand-basin in which
MR. GLADstone had just been washing his hands of all
connection with DISRAELI and ARchdeacon DENISON in
the matter of ecclesiastical appeal. MR. GLADSTONE was
almost choked—owing to the Tº of odium theolo-
gicum which had been deposited in the water—and was
some minutes before he could explain, which he did with
considerable asperity, that the tears which had so alarmed
his attached . subordinates were tears of joy. -
MR. ANDERson respectfully begged for some of this
precious fluid, and has had it bottled in an eight-ounce
phial, with the label,
“Iron tears down Plutus' cheek.”
A small quantity of this elegant extract has been sent
MR. GLADstone in a lachrymatory of rare old dragon
china, to SIR Richard BROMLEY, who finds great support
from sniffing it, in those frequent moments when he is on
the point of sinking under the combined weight of his
official duties as Commissioner of Greenwich †. his
sense of the national ingratitude to himself, and his horror
at the extravagance of the House of Commons.
The Unmanageable Island.
In order to settle the Irish difficulty, it has been pro-
osed to abolish the Church of Ireland as by law esta-
É. and to establish the Roman Catholic Church in its
lace. The consequence of this proceeding would most
ikely be, that the Irish Papists would all immediately turn
Protestants, and that the Irish Church would be as great
it is the substitution of a happy childhood for a wretched one. It may possibly a grievance to the Irish people as ever.

MODEL CONCERTS.
BRAyo, MR. MANNs' Your Saturday Winter Concerts, in their way, are model
concerts. Thanks to your good judgment, the º: are arranged to please
all ears excepting long ones, such as are not moved by any concord of sweet sounds,
and whose owners, though not *ś. for treason, stratagems, and spoils,
are certainly not suited to the Crystal Palace concert-room.
Another admirable point in your programmes is the notice that an interval of
five minutes will occur after the symphony which begins each of your concerts, and
another interval before the final overture or other instrumental work. The lighter
music in the programme is performed between these, pauses; and people who
like songs, but cannot understand a symphony, thus have their exits and their
entrances without disturbing other persons of more educated taste.
In music, as in other matters, this is a free country, and every Briton has a right
to quit a concert in the middle if it pleases him to do so. But he has no right to
annoy other people by his egress, which he is sure to do by leaving in the middle
of a piece. There are various tastes_for music as there are for every other sort of
mental food. Some like the turtle of BEETHovEN, some the venison of MozART;
while others only relish the lollipops of VERDI, or the trifles light as air which
are whipped up for the dance. A man-nay, a MANNs—who wishes to be popular
must cater for all tastes; but he must take care in so doing that the dishes do
not clash. The lovers of BEETHOVEN have a right to growl and grumble if their
hearing of a symphony be disturbed by the incoming of the lovers of a dance-tune
or a sentimental song; nor is there * reason why people should not hear the last
Fº in a programme in silence if they like. But, in general, no sooner, is the
ast piece commenced, than silks begin to rustle and boots begin to creak; and
the music is performed
its beauty, and robs its would-be hearers of the treat for which they wait.
So, bravo MR. MANNs' , Mr. Punch applauds your effort to obtain a quiet
hearing for BEETHoveN, and MENDELssoHN; and Mr. Punch would simply hint
that the person who in future interrupts their hearers should be regarded as a mis-
creant whom it were gross flattery to call a brainless ass.
It is mainly MR. MANNs who has raised these model concerts to their present
eminence, and in consequence a fund is being, raised for MR. MANNs, to which
ipºle are invited to subscribe to testify the pleasure he has given to the
public.

THE WARNING OF WANDSWORTH
COMMON.
MIDNIGHT lay still on fair West Hill,
Wandsworth snored silent nigh; ...
But for yell and scream of the whistling steam,
As the darkling trains roared by.
That sound alway, both night and day,
Must Clapham Junction hear, -
Now Battersea plains are a place of trains
That’sparagus erst did rear.
*Twixt whistle's yell, that rose and fell,
I heard a voice of woe, -
Though the Black-sea birches it scarcely stirred,
So faint it was and low:
An eldritch sound that thrilled the ground,
And through the air did runi
'Twas the Spirit of Wandsworth Common that called
To the Spirit of Wimbledon!
Spirit of Wandsworth Common.
Sleep'st thou, Brother ?
Spirit of Wimbledon Common.
Brother, may !
Sleep from me is scared away. .
Round my skirts surveyors stride, ..
Through my furze-brakes builders glide :
Bold invaders, F. sly,
Meting me with pace and eye.
Chain and tape—ah, woe is me!
Draw around my dingles free-
'Tis for this I watch and weep,
Now when happier Commons sleep!
Spirit of Wandsworth Common.
Watching, Brother, thou dost well:
'Twas for want of watch I fell.
As secure Isleeping lay
In the shade of SPENCER's name,
Foemen cut my skirts away,
Left me scarred and bared to shame.
Well thou knowest once how brave,
Robed in green, I met the spring;
How my birch-plumes used to wave
O'er golden gorse and purple ling;
How the April-lovers knew me,
Summer loiterers flocked unto me;
What rich feasts of light and air
'Neath the blue sky’s breezy tent,
I would spread-life-giving fare-
To the pale Poor, city-pent
Happier Common, then, than I
Basked not under Surrey sky:
Freer, fairer Common none
Took frown of cloud, or smile of sun.
So I slept—till evil men
Stript and scarred me, back and brow ;
Think, oh think, what I was then,
See, oh see, what I am now!
My green robe's a tattered shred,
and purple’s rent away:
Torn the birch-plumes from my head;
E’en my very skin they flay !
Take my bones to mend the roads,
Dot me o'er with vile abodes—
Hideous Cockney-villa spawn,
Each squat in its cube of lawn'
And a prison glares and glooms
From its iron-windowed tombs;–
Burial-place o' the living, here,
And a cemetery, there !
Schools, asylums—well I ween,
Little children are my joy;
In old times my gladdest green
Was put on for i. and boy;
And my lap was full of flowers
To make sweet their playing hours.
But the more I love their play,
From their schools I turn away.

POLICE INTELLIGENCE, 1875.
(If the Ladies go on at their present rate.)
WESTMINSTER.-LADY EMILY SLAshgrass and Miss GAILoreR
were brought before MR. SELFE, charged, the former with throwing
stones in Hyde Park, and the latter with assaulting the police.
PoligE-Constablf. A 256 said that he saw the prisoners in the Park,
by the jº. at about five in the afternoon, just when the ring was
full; and t ...ini, from their manner, that they were bent on mischief,
watched them. He heard the prisoner GALLOPER say to the prisoner
SLASHGRAss, “EM, old girl, I’ll give you six to one, you don't knock
that groom's hat off once in seven shies.” The other prisoner said
“Done!” and threw a large stone, which passed close to the groom's
head. At the third shot she knocked his hat off; whereupon the
witness took both the ladies into custody. The prisoner GALLOPER was
very violent and abusive, threw her cigar in his face, and struck him a
severe blow in the eye, from which he had suffered great pain ever since.
The Prisoner GALLoPER. How was I abusive?
WITNEss. You called me a low, area-sneaking Bobby. (Laughter.)
John Hicks said:—I am a groom, and yesterday was sitting on
horseback, leading another horse, when my hat came off. ... -
MR. SELFE. Came off, Sir? find what you are about, Sir? Was it
not knocked off?
WITNESS. It may have been. - -
The worthy MAGISTRATE failed to get any further information from
this witness, in spite of threatening him with an action for #!";
and the Prisoner SLASHGRAss loudly expressed her opinion that the
witness Hicks was a “brick.”
MR. SELFE said that these assaults, on the police by ladies of the
Upper Classes were becoming shamefully . He must make an
example. He should fine them each three dozen of white kid gloves,
or, in default, have them locked up for two hours in the Pantechnicon.
MADAME Čmºnies, who was present, immediately paid the fine.
MARYLEBONE-LADY Roy PINGTON and Miss SARAH DE SPIN-
STER were charged with dog-fighting for a yº in Kensington Gardens,
st, the Act; and Miss WAxeND, with four other ladies, were
charged with aiding and abetting, and obstructing the police in the
execution of their duty.
PARK-KEEPER HIGGINs said, that, early yesterday morning he was
looking for a blue-nosed baboon which had strayed away from a lady
the night before, and got lost in the new Mandrake plantation of the
Acclimatisation Society by the Serpentine, when SIR CowPER Coles
came up to him, and informed him that a large number of fashionably.
dressed ladies were assembled by the Round Pond. He i.;
dispatched a messenger for a large force of constabulary, and :
#. to the spot. A large crowd of excited ladies were assembled.
he prisoners Rox PINGTON and WAXEND were encouraging the prisoner
SPINstER in a loud tone of voice. They were all very abusive.
Miss WAxEND. How was I encouraging?
WITNESS. I heard you call out three or four times to Miss SPINstER,
“Go it, SAR-AH ! I’ll hold your bonnet.” É'.

The MAGISTRATE. I don't see much in that.
The CHIEF QLERK explained to his Worship that LoRD DILKE had
recently been forced to put a stop to Croquet in the Gardens in conse-
quence of the riotous proceedings of the ladies ºf. At the last
great match between Belgravia and Tyburnia, there had been a regular
set:to with croquet hammers, and one case had terminated fatally,
The MAGISTRATE said that he was determined to put an end to this
sort of thing. It was a most extraordinary and most unfortunate thing,
that the young women of the present day should be led away by the delu-
sion, that acts of “fastness” like this could be attractive to any one
whose opinion was in the least degree worth having. By the style and
tone which they had lately chosen to adopt, the women of England were
throwing to the winds all that vast influence which their mothers had
possessed, and had used for so much good. The ambition of the girls
of the day was, it seemed to him, to make themselves rivals, in the
follies of the more unthinking of the other sex, who despised them,
while they encouraged them. The Prisoners were each fined eight boxes
of chocolate drops, or in default to be locked up in the Hanover Square
Rooms for half an hour.
The Prisoners, who were evidently taken aback by the severity of the
sentence, asked, through LADY RoMPINGTON, whether the chocolate
was to be “Masson’’ or “Menier.”
The MAGISTRATE. Half of each.
After a short delay, MR. GUNTER, of Berkeley Square, and M.
MENIER, of Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, appeare and paid the
fine. The Prisoners left the Čourt in their CarriageS.

THE LICENCE OF THE LONG ROBE.
MR. PUNCH,
THE honourable Member for County Clare has
introduced into the House of Commons a bill to amend the
law of libel, of which I cannot approve, because it is
designed to diminish litigation, and therefore calculated to
injure the learned and scrupulous profession, to which I
have the honour to belong. In this measure, SIR Col.MAN
O'LoGHLEN proposes to º the proprietors of news-
apers from their existing liability to action or prosecution
or libellous or defamatory matter contained, in their
reports of speeches made at public meetings, and to trans;
fer that liability to the speakers thereof. I should not
object to this alteration if I thought that, whereas actions
are now brought against newspaper º: they
would, if it were to become law, be brought just as often
against the makers of speeches; but I am afraid that
practically such would not be the case, because a man's
speech is one thing, and its report by another, man is
another thing, responsibility for the former is not respon-
; for the latter, and there would be more or less
difficulty in proving coincidence of one with the other.
This consideration would somewhat discourage rogues from
going to law with the object of getting vindictive damages;
and that would be detrimental to business.

“Devil's Own” Club, Feb., 1865. CAUSIDICUs.
A CHANCELLOR DIVIDED AGAINST HIMSELF.
IF HoweR sometimes nods, even LORD WESTBURY may now and
then be allowed to snooze. Still, a Chancellor's snoozing is a serious
thing, except on the Woolsack during a debate in the House of Lords.
In that “Sleepy, Hollow” a Chancellor snoring with his eyes shut
seems rather in keeping than not with the “solemn drowsi-head”
that reigns around.
But when a Chancellor takes forty winks on the Bench—above all,
when he delivers, judgment in this winking state, it may be a very
serious matter both for clients and counsel.
It must have been in one of these non-lucid intervals of obliviousness,
that WESTBURY, Chancellor, the other day, decided in his own Court
the recently reported case, “Er parte Potter, Re BARRON.”
The case, turned on the question, whether, the execution of an
unstamped deed of assignment by a debtor could be relied on as an act
of bankruptcy. Counsel brought forward two cases in which such a
deed had been judicially decided to have this character. The second
case (Er parte WENSLEY) was cited as a decision of LoRD CHANCELLOR
CAMPBELL’s.
Who was WESTRURy, that he should be guided by CAMPBELL * He
deliberately overruled the decision cited to him as plain John's, adding,
with that #. courtesy which distinguishes him, that “he did not
wish to be held as #. with the decision cited to him in Er parte
WENSLEY: it would take a good deal of argument to convince him of
the soundness of that decision.”
It subsequently turned out that this decision was one of LoRD
WESTBURY's own |
Really, counsel should be more careful. Not only “circumstances”
but Chancellors “alter cases.” If decrees are quoted with wrong
names, who can tell what they ought to weigh §. as CAMPBELL’s
opinion, WESTBURY was in honour bound to pick a hole in Er parte
WFNsLEY. . Cited as WESTBURY's, though not the more sure to be
right, the judgment would of course have been respected by our
courteous and candid Chancellor.
LoRD WESTRURy, is always understood to consider one person at
least as infallible. That person is LoRD WESTBURY.
If that infallibility is to be divided against itself, what are the Courts
of Equity to believe in P
. It is as bad as the Pope ‘...ºf
ciples he was “Viva-Pio-Nono-ed”
to in 1848.
If this sort of thing goes on, the proverbial uncertainty of the Law
will be nothing to the uncertainty of Equity.
Unless, indeed, WESTBURY is weary of his infallibility, as TITHONUs
was weary of his youth, and, having nobody else left to snub, is deter:
mined to snubhimself-Richard against BETHELL, and BETHELL against
RICHARD-like that famous John LILBURNE of CROMWELL’s time, of
whom his friend SIR HENRY MARTIN said, that “if there were none

[MARCH 11, 1865.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The debate on the condition of Ireland was resumed. MR. Roebuck
was severe on the “mendicant whine of the Irish,”, and was very con:
temptuous about their plebeian priests, whose vulgar ignorance and
bigoted prejudice he considered as the roots of Irish evil. There is no
doubt that a low and uneducated clergy is a curse to any country. But
LORD PALMERSTON, who closed the debate (there were two or three
fº speeches between) thought that the natural features of Ireland
ad much to do with her want of prosperity. , Her climate made her
o § a pasture country, while her peasantry clung to patches of
ºwhich they insisted on cultivating. The inference is, that until
we can make her a manufacturing nation—the priests will hinder this,
if they can—the Irish must emigrate. The PREMIER offered a Com:
mittee, but MR HENNEssy likes the flourish of a division, and had
31 to 107 against him. The º of this Irish debate is, that certain
of the leading Tories meant, with the expected aid of the Hibernians
to give the Government a fall, but the Sunday cooled divers heads, an
some of the most respected Conservatives refused to come up to the
scratch. So there was sulk in the camp, and the end was that MR.
DISRAELI took no part in a large debate which called up the crack Minis-
terialists. Do the Parliament men think that the great Punch does not
see all their little games f In proof that he does, he hereby º up
this business with his Magnesium Wire, even as Piozzi SMYTH has just
done unto the interior of the Pyramid.
Tuesday. A Sewage, debate in the Commons. The world is aware
that there is fierce strife as to the proposed method of treating our
sewage. The fact is, that we have only recently discovered that what
We º t rubbish, to be got rid of, is fertilising treasure, to be thank-
fully used. But we know as yet no more how to turn it to account
than a baby knows how to use a bundle of bank-notes. A hybrid Com-
mittee has been appointed to consider the subject, half the members
chosen by the House, and half by the Committee of Selection.
Then we had an Education debate, led by SIR John PARINGTON,
who desired a Select Committee. The opponents of the present system
declare that it helps only those who can help themselves, and does
nothing for the helpless. Its authors defend it strenuously. But why
should Punch take any notice of such a trumpery matter as the Educa-
tion of the Poor f...The Commons were not inclined to condescend to
such trifles—the House was nearly counted out in the middle of the
discussion, and when a division was called for, there were 18, on one
side and 68 on the other, nothing like a House in fact, and so we
adjourned.
Wednesday. Pope GREGoRY THE GREAT having introduced the
; of Ashes on the first day of Lent, and that day, being called
ſes Cinerum, or Ash-Wednesday, the name is retained, although at the
Reformation we abolished the sprinkling as a “vain show,” and also as
very uncomfortable when the ashes were sprinkled on the head, and got
down between the mediaeval shirts and the respected backs of our
ancestors; and therefore the House of Commons did not meet until
two o'clock, instead of twelve to-day. SIR FITzRoy KELLY moved the
Second Reading of his Bill for Improving the Law of Evidence. The
intense wisdom of our present system was admirably illustrated on the
very next day, when an Italian, who was civilly dead, being under
sentence of death for murder, was examined as a witness, and allowed
to prove the guilt of another person, though he, the witness, had been
forbidden to speak on his own trial, and therefore had been º of
the º of showing his innocence. He would assuredly have
been hanged if the spirit of MR. NEGRETTI, the eminent thermometer-
and-every-other-ometer maker, had not ascended to "spirits boil,” and
sent him flying to Birmingham to catch the real stabber, and compel
him to repent and confess—a fact which we register for all time, to the
honour of MR. NEGRETTI. The ATToRNEY-GENERAL clings to the old
system, and means to oppose SIR FITzRoy. For once we have the
honour of agreeing with MR.SCULLY, who remarked that Ministers
might be better law-reformers if they had the advantage of the leisure
º by the Opposition.
. CLIFFORD-what puts the words Stat nominis Umbra into our
head? unless it be that we have just lost a beautiful umbrella with our
name pn it, from our stand-pushed on his Bill, for doing away with
fines for not going to church. We trust it will pass, but would ask
MR. CLIFFORD to introduce a clause for also doing away with the fines
for going there. They are called fees to pew-openers. Because one has
not always got a bad shilling, handy for pew-opener or box-keeper.
Moreover, something should be done to restrain those pertinacious
Beggars, the parsons, from ºf more than ten Collections in one
month. Here is an account of what we have paid in that way since
the first ultimo:—
1. For Converting Jews . .
2. For ditto Hottentots . -
8. For ditto Irish . . .
. For ditto Spitalfielders - - -
. For an Evening Preacher - - - - - -
. For the British and Foreign Anti-Colenso Society .
For the ... the Propagation of Missionaries . .
. For a Church in some Scotch island—Muck, we think . .
or some Clerical charity—we could not catch what, the
preacher mumbled so - - - - - - -
;
10. For Schools in †. - - - - - - . . 420 1 0
11. For a new Hymn ºo: nearly so good as the Atton NEY-
GENERAL's). - - - - - - - - . 0 2 6
12. The regular Collection . 0 4 0
This is our own experience, and scores of correspondents who beg us
to intercede with the Clergy to let them alone will probably now let us
alone, as we have brought the case under the notice of the Legislature.
But now, here is another financial grievance. ALDERMAN SALOMONs
wants to open all the Bridges free, and levy a general rate upon the
Metropolis to pay the cost of such enfranchisement. This, while the
City levies a vast tax, and pockets most of the money, viá the Corpo-
ration. Let the City buy up the bridges.

Thursday. Notice in both Houses that we are to have a grand
useum debate. The place is so crammed that the Curators are
perfectly qutrageous. We fully expect to see a general onslaught upon
the stuffed collection, and to behold it flying out of the window into
the quadrangle-in fact, when we go to the Library we always run up
the steps as fast as possible, lest we should get an elephant or a croco-
dile on our heads. "We should not blame these gentlemen—we mean
the Curators, of course—if they made short work with the dusty old
Zoological lumber. Why is it not got rid of? Who wants to see the
dirtiest and worst stuffed giraffe in the whole world, when he can see
a dozen beautiful live ones walking about with their necks twisted
round like comforters, as depicted in Mr. Punch's pages last week?
MR, BAINEs postponed his New Reform Bill until the last of
Chimney-Sweepers' Days.
... We had a Gun debate, and MR, BAILLIE demanded a Committee to
inquire whether the QUEEN’s ships are properly armed. He went into
the question, and fired, very heavy charges at the Admiralty. LoRD
HARTINGTON resisted the motion, said that some of our big guns were
not so bad as had been alleged, and that he did not believe we were
worse off than other nations. LoRD CLARENCE Paget said that a
Committee was sitting on the best means of rifling guns, and this
reminded Mr. Punch of the trunk-maker in Douglas JERRoLD's comedy,
who compliments Lord Skindeep on having, spoken beautifully, espe-
cially when he described BRITANNIA as seated upon her polished trident.
MR. BAILLIE was defeated by 57 to 22, but he deserves the thanks of
MRs. BRITANNIA aforesaid. There was then, a discussion on the awful
expense of repairing ships—for instance, the 4. cost, for repairs,
£26,642, while she could have been built for one hundred and fourteen
pounds under that sum. The Government answer was brilliantly
unsatisfactory. -
Punch is not a sentimentalist, but he must be allowed to say that he
thinks there ought to be some difference made in the prison treatment of
persons who are only charged with offences and those who are con-
victed. , SIR GEORGE GREY does not, and was good enough to “hope
that he had made it clear the other night that persons under remand,
#. only charged with an offence, were not subjected to #.
ardships, and privations than those actually convicted " ally!
Well, that is something to know. This part of our prison system
must be overhauled. Any innocent person may, by the machinations
of a scoundrel and the obtusity of a Magistrate (especially one who has
a fatal facility of belief in police narratives), be sent to prison, but until
tried, he ought not to be treated as a felon is rightfully treated. It is
scandalous that one has to enunciate such a platitu e in these days
when a Judge is so careful of the interests of a self-condemne
stabber as to force Counsel on him to rebut the man's own confession.
The Colonial Secretary brought in a Bill for enabling the Colonies
to defend themselves at sea, entirely at their own expense. Punch is
economical to a fault, but can see no objection to this.
Friday. Ex-Chancellor Loºp St. LEONARDs did not think that the
County Court Judges were fit to administer Equity, and he believed
that they would sell the poor man a bad article. Ex-dittoes LoRDs
QRANWORTH and CHELMSFORD partly approved, of the new scheme.
Actual Chancellor LoRD WESTBURY said that there was no choice in
the matter, we must have those Judges or none. He believed them
erfectly qualified, and added that if ºf had any superfluous Modesty
e should advise them to get rid of it. The Bill was read a Second Time.
The Commons had a Popish debate. MR. NewDEGATE made an
awfully long speech on the wickedness of convents and of those who
dwell therein, and demanded a Committee. MR. HENNEssy contended
that the existing law sufficed to deal with proved wrongs. MR.NEATE
thought that the Catholics themselves required protection from their
priests. The House, having then had enough of the serious business,
shouted and roared for Mr. WHALLEY, and also shouted and roared at
his Protestant oration, especially, when, alluding to the case of one
ELIZA. RYAN, said to have been abducted, he declared that if the QUEEN
herself wanted to know where that person was, HER MAJESTY could
get no answer. Imagine the QUEEN asking, “ Where's ºf " Sir
GEORGE GREY thought that no case had been made out, and that law
was of no use when people were led away by religious impressions.
MR. Scully went into a rage, and then the House went to division,
when MR._NEwpEGATE was defeated by 106 to 79. Nevertheless,
gentlemen Oratorians, if -

THE KING OF PRUSSIA CRYING.
SoME people have been too hard upon the KING of PRussia. They
have represented his Prussian Majesty as being, in reward for the
§: of his army in Denmark, decorated with the Order of the
ows. , Schleswig and Holstein have been likened by them to the
watch and chain of MR. BRIGGs, and they have pointed out an incom-
lete analogy between King Winia, and Mººn. Were there
owever, a European Central Criminal Court, before which princes and
statesmen, the authors of unjust wars, could be arraigned for their
crimes, and, were the Sovereign who slew the Danes and took pos-
session of the Duchies, tried by that tribunal for robbery and worse,
there is good reason to hope that he would be acquitted of those
charges. According to the Prussian correspondent of the Times:—
“A most affecting scene occurred the other day in a Berlin military hospital.
In going the round of the wards, the KING noticed a man who had lost both his
arms and legs. The KING inquired if there was anything he could do for him.
The human torso, a victim of the late campaign, replied, "Your Majesty, have mo
shot.” Deeply affected, the KING replied that he could not possibly fulfil this
unchristian wish. Upon this, the unfortunate man, flying into a passion, cursed
the doctors that had kept him alive. The KING turned away crying.”
Poor old man!. After all, the KING OF PRussia has a soft heart;
there is no denying that; but it is evidently accompanied by as soft a
brain. He could º at the sad spectagle exhibited § a “human
torso, a victim of the late campaign,” which he himself had ordered,

single example of the consequences of what he had done by waging a
war of aggression, he was moved to tears. The sight of one poor
wretch, his instrument in the work of slaughter and spoliation, who, in
doing that work, had been deprived of all his limbs, and now begged to
be shot out of his misery, made his Majesty cry. He was unprepared
to behold such results of warfare as those presented by that truncated
object. He had never forethought the effects of rifle and cannon shot
on human shins and thigh and arm bones. Being at last confronted

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
with a solitary instance of them, he turned away crying. Gould it pos:
sibly have occurred to him that the unhappy soldier, who implored
death, and “cursed the doctors that had kept him alive,” was a mere
molecule in the mass of torment and woe created by the King who
willed the Danish war, surely his tears would have drowned the wind.
The fact that the King of Faussia cried on beholding an individual
example of mutilation incurred in battle, conclusively shows that when
he went to war he did not know what he was about. It bespeaks
simple want of imagination and reflective intellect. Then, too, his
refusal to have a man shot, who wanted to be shot, evinces a scrupu-
lousness which, combined with any capability of thinking, would have
restrained him from needlessly causing to be shot men who did not
want to be shot. The conscience which rejected the petition to be
shot and put out of pain as “unchristian,” would, in conjunction with
the least degree of reason, have felt that the employment of needle-
guns and rifled cannon in aggressive war, to the infliction of the direst
suffering and injury on multitudes, would be contrary to Christianity.
No such sense gave the KING OF PRUssLA pause in dooming thousands
to a death of agony or a life of howling. Could he be brought to trial
for the atrocities which at his bidding were tºº." on Denmark,
the verdict of an unprejudiced jury might well enough be Not Guilty,
on the ground of inbecility.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
(Specially reported for the Drawing-Room.)
THE RING.
The Match between the Pet and the Deep'un (whereof a detailed
account was given by us a short time ago), which was injerrupted b
the authorities from the Home Office, was resumed the other day, and,
after a gallant struggle, terminated so far satisfactorily as it is possible
for such encounters to terminate. -
It was very difficult to arrange such a safe place of meeting as should
at once baffle the myrmidons of a maternal government and be mode-
rately easy of approach for the parties engaged. This was admirably
§ one of the Pet's backers, welſ known in these circles as
the Cousin, to whose cautious arrangement it was agreed on all
that everything should be left. - -
Before the meeting it had been whispered that the Pet wished, to be
“off” with the Deep'un, and wanted to make a Match with ENSIGN
GoRDon (the Wacant Wallflower), but there was no truth whatever in
the report.
*imbra Court in the Cº. Palace was the place fixed on by
the Cousin, acting for the Pet. The Deep'un was attended by CAPTAIN
SLIGo, of the Enniskillens. The Deep'un was first to arrive. The Pet
was somewhat behind time.
On coming up to the scratch, both combatants advanced to meet
one another, the Deep'un being the first to put out his hand, which
was immediately taken by the Pet, and good-humouredly shaken. -
The Cousin and Bob Sligo, after whispering some ºf advice in
º . of their protégés, then retired, and left the pair to the business
of the day.
The $: evinced a slight hesitation of manner, for which we can now
easily account, but the Deep'un's . lips and steady gaze
showed that he did not undervalue the difficulty of the task before him.
Round 1. The pair walked round, eyeing one another anxiously,
Deep'un threw out a cautious feeler as to that fellow GQRDon., Pet
Hºf to stop it laughingly, but, in doing this, she made a slip, and was
knocked almost out of time by a direct blowin the region of the heart.
Round 2. The Pet, on recovering, tried to look as if she did not care
very much for her antagonist. But before she knew where she was,
Pet was catching it heavily. Pet put in her right—to be heard, but
was gently stopped. First tearfor the Deep'un. -

moment. He suddenly delivered one powerful one, which she caught
directly in her ear. Pet returned softly, but truly, then, fainted, was
caught, but was stopped, and then went down on a seat. (This was the
... point in inefit.)
Round 7. (Leaving the Crystal Palace; evening.).When they again
came up Deep'un appeared with a ſº of triumph on his jº.
phiz, while the Pet, although still smiling, was ii.; somewhat
shaken, by the last encounter. It was probably by her backer, The
Cousin's, advice that Pet made several attempts to get well home. At
last Deep'un allowed her to do so, and when Pet wanted to get away
drove her with his left, right up to her corner (Hyde Park Corner),
where the Pet warily got down. -
Round 8. It was now considered by all spectators a settled thing,
and it was felt that it would be better for all parties, and more chart.
able to the plucky pair, if the fight was brought sharply to a conclusion.
Deep'un's friends, four or five sporting gentlemen known as The Bache.
lors, were strongly opposed to this course.
hen time was called (11 o'clock at St. George's, Hanover Square,
no cards) the Deep'un appeared calm, and collected, though by the
nervous twitching about the corners of his mouth we could see that he
wasn't as yet exactly at his ease. The Pet's eyes were much swollen,
and it was apparent to all that it was as much as she could do to last
out this #: call upon her strength. After some hesitation both went
down by the rails, where there were some heavy exchanges between
them, the effects of which they will probably feel for life.
|Pet had to be, carried to her corner, and shortly afterwards her
friends threw up the sponge-cake in token of defeat.
The umpire, the Rev. C.UPLER, Rector of St. Bride's, of course
gave his decision in favour of the Deep'un, who thereupon received the
congratulations of his numerous friends.
he admirers of the Pet presented her with more than one valuable
testimonial to her gallant conduct and undaunted pluck, throughout the
late encounter.
The Pet's colours were orange and white; the Deep'un's variegated.
The courageous couple are now making a tour of the provinces for
their mutual benefit.
THE COUSIN AND THE MATCHER.
Out of the above meeting arose a merry little mill between The
Cousin and Pet's first trainer (maternal), known as The Matcher.
. The Cousin came right at her antagonist, sending in one with her
right by way of a salutation. The Matcher countered her heavily on
ds the stairs. Both down by the library
In the new rounds, the Matcher went in at the Cousin heavily for
claudestinely assisting the Pet. This severely taxed the Cousin's
powers. The Cousin, after some dodging, fibbed away merrily,
evincing an amount of tact and discretion hardly to be expected of
her, and the Matcher having apparently had a dose of it, refused
to answer when called upon. This . 20 min. 15 sec.

HOW NICE IN HIM.
We seldom notice criticism, but as, like BAcon, we hold Everything
to be in our department (including breakfast bacon), we are never
debarred, by precedents of our own making, from saying just what we
like. And just now we like to say how much we are pleased with
recent demonstrations on the part of the Musical Critic, of the
Athenaeum. That he is utterly devoid of the crotchets and the spite-
fulness so frequently observable in critics whose range of subject is
limited, and whose reverence for it is fanatical, everybody knows, but
for the warm-hearted and generous tributes which he has paid in
circumstances which would have dictated smaller conduct to a smaller
man, the majority of readers of the Athenaeum may not have been
prepared. The greatest pianist of the day, Miss ARABELLA GoDDARD,
whom we must also call by her rightful name, MRs. Davison, for the
fuller elucidation of matters, has lately added to her renown by Some
magnificent performances of a composition by Dussex, called
L'Invocation, and she has so marvellously well expounded, a difficult
masterpiece, that it has been demanded º and again at the Popular
Concerts. The Athenæum writer not only felt a true artist's admira-
tion of a true artist's performance, but a brotherly regard for a
fellow-labourer, and as the lady's husband, who is the leading musical
critic of London, was debarred by good taste from giving
much more than a simple record of his wife's success, the
hebdomadal, reviewer has , demonstrated at once his sense of
justice and his feeling of chivalry, and has published the frankest
and the warmest homage to MRs. DAvison's genius. He has
attended all her performances of L'Invocation, listened with profound
attention, and remained until the last applause ceased, so that when he
came to write on the subject he spoke glowingly of what he had heard
“SEIZER.”
º Again, in the case of the Manager of Her Majesty's Theatre,
who has not been so successful as his varied efforts to amuse the public
deserved, the Athenaeum critic has been as kind, if not as warm. He
has pointed out defects and errors, but in a candid spirit, and at the
close of the season, instead of exulting in the fulfilment of unfavourable
F. and bestowing a parting sneer upon agentleman who has not
n fortunate, he has credited him with his energy and spirit, and with
his abstaining from availing himself of his position in order to come
before the public, and has bid him cheer up and hope for better luck
next time." He has also proclaimed, and we are only too happy to
follow his lead, that the popular favourite, MR. W. HARRIsos, will
take his benefit at Her Majesty's on Thursday, the 16th of March,
when he ought to be exceedingly well befriended by the lovers of
English music and English honesty.
Fair Play for the Davenports. -
The DAVENPoRT Brothers “die hard,” and PALMER and FAY, their
touters, are not to be silenced by failure and exposure. PAIMER now de;
mands a “jury of twelve” to decide upon the merits of the Brothers; and
considering the blasphemous assertions of the mountebanks—amongst
others, that of being “released from their bonds” by a spirit—we think
PALMER's request ought to be granted, and a “jury of twelve” sum-
moned to try the gang for receiving money under false pretences.

THE gentleman who dropped his voice may hear of it again by

THE KING OF THE LUMBAGEES.
BY BENNY THE BO'SEN.
* - L º º
I'LL sing you a song o' my father,
Who was bo'sen aboard the King Arthur,
Which wessel went sailing out rather
Beyond all Her Majesty's seas;
I think I now see him as he's
º to my boy JACK on his knees-
“We sailed all about the horizon, .
Seeing sights as was awful surprisin';”
This yarn spun my father to my son
Of the King of the Lumbagees.
“When I was a young’un at Spithead
I met Kitty Kicksy as fitted ...
My taste: I was much to be pitied,
As she turned out a regular tease.
She was always a raising a breeze;.
When my tail she would angrily seize.
I got a berth on the King Arthur,
All along of my knowin' a tar there,
And sailed, leaving your grandmammathere;
And now for the Lumbagees'
“The wessel was bound for Lumbago,
Which is somewhere not far from Podargo,
We took out a curious cargo
To land on the furriner's keys.
Now this here Lumbago be's
An isle in the Southern Seas;
The native’s a sort o' confusion , .
Twixt African, Chinese, and Rooshian,
The chief city's name is Mashushan,
And the people are Lumbagees.
“On board there was a Missionairy,
Who spoke the brogue of Tipperary, - -
And he’d preached to the blacks in the prairie
What he’d learnt in his Collegees.
For promoting of life's decencies
He took out some little coatees.
In flannel he’d some of the best kits
Of thingummyfigs and warm westkits. - -
Which he took with some grog and ship's biscuits
For the good of the Lumbagees.
“We sailed for a year and a quarter,
We hadn't a drop of cold water,
And only one bottle of porter—
Such accidents happen as these—
We'd killed all the ducks and the geese,
Our bread was as dry as our cheese,
We couldn’t ha' held out much longer
If we hadn't cot a fine conger.
Or we should ha’ done something wronger
Than a cussin' the Lumbagees.
“We were talking of eating the skipper
ith winegar, mustard, and pipper, ...
When a cheer from the mizen cries “Hip-hur-
ray! for the tops o' trees
The woice was the Missionairee's,
As was working his compassees.
‘We’ve got,' says he, “near the Equator,
My glassjist makes out a young cratur
Almost in a state o' natur’—
'Twas the state of the Lumbagees,
“We landed: the King with an escort
Came down, and a white flannel westcoat
We gave him.; and this as his best coat
he wore till his royal decease.
He wasn't unlike a Chineese,
With a liking for green and black teas;
And while he was being converted
With all the Princesses I flirted,
And by pretty manners diverted
The beautiful Lumbagees.
“The bold Missionairy did in go
For talking the Lumbagee lingo,
And the King gave up worshipping Jingo
And the heathenish goddessees;
And the people who fricassees
Had made of all Missionarees
Refused this good person to dish up,
Canonicals they made him fish up
From his box, and they called him Archbishop
Of the various Lumbagees.
“And I, for my wisdom, soon arter
Was spliced to the King's eldest darter,
And was made by position a martyr
To all the Court ceremonies.
With forms I always disagrees,
For I likes to sit down at my ease.
They bow'd and they scraped in a bevy,
Which they did §§ º at a levy;
The work done by Royalty’s heavy
At the Court of the Lumbagees.
“I reigned for two years in this fashion,
Till the parleyment fº in a passion
And the populace all day kept smashin'
The windows of plate glassees;
º pulled down my shiver de freeze";
As I couldn't the beggars appease,
I went to the bishop, the clerk too,
We all smuggled out in the dark, to
Find a ship in which we could embark, to
Get away from the Lumbagees'
“They took us aboard the Red Rover,
º gave us a passage to Dover,
And here I am living in clover .
On the bounty wot's her Majesty's.
I wouldn't be monarch of Greese,
Nor bishop of all the high Sees–
I’d sooner rub on as a lackey,

REPRESENTATION AND REASON.
S To the Editor of Punch.
IR,
J. It is not true that I was buried at the Holy City in a steel
coffin suspended between two loadstones. I was taken up in a trance
into the seventh heaven, and remained there until I was let down again
the other day, when the FERGUsons got me into their power, and, for
urposes of their own, immured me in this place, from which the angel
§: will shortly liberate me, and then I shall be revenged upon
em :
In the newspapers which are allowed here, I see that MR. BAINEs
and others have prepared a Bill for extending the elective franchise to
six-pound householders. Sir, I ask, why draw the line at six pounds?
Why not go the whole animal? I do not say “hog,” because I hold
that beast unclean.
Sir, I am for universal suffrage. If the mass of six-pound house-
holders have intelligence enough to vote, I want to know who has not?
I am for real universal suffrage, mind you. . Some advocates of a
suffrage which they call universal would limit their liberality by allowing
a vote only to every unconvicted person of sound mind. Setting the
case of criminals, who have forfeited their political rights, aside, I pro-
test against the implied exception.
There is a man in this place who labours under the delusion that, he
has discovered perpetual motion. Though insane upon that one point,
on all others he is perfectly rational. He is a person of vast, informa:
tion, and most logical reasoning faculties; and he is particularly well
up in constitutional history. Is the single slate loose in this man's
well-furnished upper storey a disqualification for the exercise of the
elective franchise so great as the ignorance and general mental deficiency
of the uneducated masses? He, I am sure, would, standing at the
Fºllº to vote for the man of his choice, know perfectly well
what he was about. Are we as certain, that even every ten-pound
hºlder would, supposing him, for the sake of argument, to be
soner
But do not mistake me, Sir. My voice is for the representation of
all classes and all orders of intellect, not excepting the lowest, and
inclusive even of the disordered. Derangement, Sir, is very inadequately
represented in the House of Commons—only by a few Irish Members
with lucid intervals, and perhaps one Englishman. No wonder that
the law on the subject of lunacy is in so unsatisfactory a condition.
One of the inmates of this establishment believes himself to be
ALEXANDER THE GREAT. I say, Sir, that, consistently maintaining
the principle of inherent representative right irrespectively of intellect,
you ought to allow a vote even to that fool, who says that he is older
than I am, and flourished more than nine hundred years before my
flight from Mecca. Of course, Sir, you are aware that I am

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
on DAY, March 6.
Discussion in the
Lords about new
military hospitals,
said to be con-
structed on the
“glass, and glare”
principle. Some
tolerable jokes were
exchanged on the
subject, which
showed that the
Lords had not de-
generated from that
witty nobleman,
“my LoRD BIRoN,”
who undertook
“To jestatwelvemonth
in an hospital.”
In the Commons
to-night, and in the
Lords on the next
evening, came ques-
tions and explana-
tions on what will
be known as “the
LEoNARD EDMonds
Scandal.” If it were
not that one great name, which has ever been honoured in these pages, though its
owner has also contributed in no small degree to their fun, has been mixed up with
this business, Mr. Punch would make very short work of it. There is clearly a
whole...chapter of omissions and commissions to be read.
But Mr. Punch is certain that he shall please all honest
readers (and he never desires to please any others) by for-
bearing from detail or comment until HENRY BRough AM
shall have been heard, and then all good men will be both
grieved and astonished, should not his speech be instantly
followed by a unanimous verdict of acquittal. Call the next
case.
The next case was that of John Bull v. Railway Mis-
management. MR BENTINck, for the plaintiff, demanded
that Government should have power to inquire into acci-
dents, and frame º:
As for the latter desire, the fact is that regulations are
framed already, and the frames are mailed up, at the
Stations, but officials do not observe them. Mr. MILNER
GIFson, utterly declined, on the part of Government, to
undertake the proposed responsibility. On the whole, we
incline to think that the best preventive of accidents which
has yet been discovered is the old, but invaluable ma-
chine called the British º It frightens Directors into
something like vigilance. The machine is kept in a box,
and when properly Charged, it explodes with splendid effect,
and is in fact a tremendous fog-signal, for intimating to
mis-managers that something is wrong.
And now for “Rule Britannia.”
The martial, naval, and majestic hymn having been
executed, and our minds having been rought into what
good Tony Lumpkin calls a “concatenation” accordingly,
LoRD CLARENCE PAGET introduced the Navy Estimates.
Never mind about the money—we must pay what LoBD
CLARENCE asks—but let us see what we have got for the
money.
We have got (in addition to our Wooden Walls, in which
we are not to trust) Thirty Armour-Clad Ships, most of
them ready, and the rest (save one—now then, Millwall,
wake up!) so forward that they can be ready to do slaughter
at Christmas.
We are to have, for this year, 69,750 men, 2,200 fewer
than last year; but fewer men mean more officers, and
therefore better-served ships, in these days of science.
We are to have 7,000 boys—the same number as last
year.
We reduce the number of our Marines on shore, and
we knock off 500 men from the expensive Coast Guard.
Among the Thirty Tyrants of the Azure Main, we have
19 iron-plated Line-of-Battle Ships, 7 smaller ones, and 4 of
great value for defensive purposes. -
We are to have Four Ships of tremendous speed, which
his Lordship described as “Four Alabamas.” Absit omen.
..We are to have a “really” sea-going vessel (there is a
history in that word “really”) on CAPTAIN CowPER Coles's
principle.
We are to have new Docks for the new set of large
armour-clad º
All that reads pleasantly, and if we add that we are
asked for £10,392,224 to pay for these things (some
£300,000 less than last year), Mr. Punch does not set the
fact down to damp satisfaction, for
“Estimates never were designed
Tomake our pleasures less,"
but because business is business as well as pleasure.
A good deal was said in reply to Lord CLARENCE
and SiR John PARINGton declined to wear rose coloured
spectacles, and had a many things to say against, various
ships, and against MR. REED, the Government designer,
who, SIR John considered, had bewitched his employers-
they, like Sylvia, rejoicing in
“Telling how, with eager speed,
They flew to hear the vocal REED.”
SIR. J. ELPHINstone accused the Government of wasting
money over bad ships. We resumed the subject on Thurs-
day, and SIRMoRron PETo was very severe on the Govern-
ment, and as to MR. REED, the Baronet, said that the
appointment of that gentleman made him disbelieve in the
Duke of SomeRset, but what profanity may not be ex-
pected from a Dissenter, MRs. GRUNDY! SIR Morton
appealed to CAPTAIN SHERARD Osborn's report in favour

Coles plan, and is stated to be the best ship in the navy.
So said SIR. J. Hay, who declared that the country was not

well of many of them, denied that the Admiralty had, opposed
CAPTAIN, CoLEs (we dare say), defended, MR. REED, and did his
duty gallantly as an official. But we had not half done with him.
Colonel, Sykes urged that the French navy was scarcely more than
half as costly as ours, SIR. H. WILLOUGHBY went at figures, and
declared that the real reduction from last year was only £25,000; MR.
BENTINck objected to all reductions. MR. STANSFELD made a most
clear and able speech—so good that it must have delighted the
Opposition and MR. Cox to think that they had driven so good a man
out of office. He showed a thorough sea-going knowledge on the
subject, and the sooner he is in place again the better. MR. CHILDERs,
who is in office, defended the figures cleverly. SIR John PAKINGTON
remained, like the Brothers Cheeryble's butler, “unconvinced,” and
then the men and boys and the money to pay them were voted,
MRs. GRUNDY.
“Rule BRITANNIA, BRITANN1A rules the waves,
Those who insult her tread upon their graves.”
With a sweet smile Mr. Punch resumes his habitual bland, pacifica-
tory and pacificawhig manner, and takes a flying backward leap into
Tuesday. To-day a gentleman took his seat for Tralee. This gentle-
man calls himself THE O'DonAGHUE, but THE PUNCH has a little story
to tell him. Last year but one, Mr. Punch was sailing on a certain
Lake, or Loch, in what MR. GLADstoNE calls a conquered country, an
which the map calls Scotland. In the boat, a magnificent Highlander
fraternised with Mr. Punch, and as they smoked the pipe of peace,
the former
* “In the garb of old Gaul, with the fire of old rum,"
said to the latter, pointing at a third, “That person calls himself
“THE MAC ******.” He is wrong to do so. There are but
three personages in this world (besides yourself) who are entitled
to prefix the definite article to their names. These are THE
MAG “****, The Mac ******, and The Devil.” Now, as the Irish
gentleman in question is not Mr. Punch, nor any one of the other
three gentlemen, named,” he must excuse. Mr. Punch for not
§: him the Article. But, wise compromise is the essence, as
cAULAY says, of all political action, and Mr. Punch has no objection
to borrowing a Christian name from a very delightful story in that
admirable publication Once a Week (BRADBURY & Evans, Whitefriars),
by Miss ANNIE THOMAs, and calling the gentleman THEO DoNAGHUE.
His admirers, and we dare say he has many, for he has pluck and
manners, though he makes wild mistakes, may at their liking suppose
him to have been christened THEodore, THEodosius, THEoPHILUs, or
THEoPompUs. But not for all Ireland will Mr. Punch break the
Promise of Odin, which he made to that great Highlander, never to
mis-bestow a title.
The entire night was taken up by a debate on the Malt Tax, at the
end of which discussion the Agricultural JEREMY DIDDLER was in-
formed, by 251 to 171, that MR. GLADstone had such a thing as Seven
Millions about him, and meant to keep it about him. lf JEREMY
would only study the cartoons of the Prophet Punch, so much time
would not be wasted.
A Bill was brought, in for enabling the Government to acquire
the block of houses between Parliament Street and King Street.

Wednesday. LoRD Robert MonTAGU tried to carry a measure for
protecting all the Rivers of England from the abominations which are
cast into them, and which convert our sparkling streams into foul and
foetid sewers. The proposal is a noble one, but—business is business,
and as MR. BRIGHT said (and he is a devoted fisherman, and no
debilitated scoffer at out-door sports), better the fish die than the
manufacturers, to whom the drainage is necessary. SIR GEORGE
GREY, of course, resisted the measure, but many Members called on
him to take up the subject, and try to do something with it. Nothing
of the kind, and ultimately the Bill was withdrawn. Nevertheless the
British Naiades owe their smiles to Lord Robert, and next time he
goes into Poet's Corner, very likely dear old Michael DRAYTON, who
sang of all our rivers in his Polyolbion, will say that he is much
obliged. Meantime we say it for him.
Thursday. Good gracious, MRs. GRUNDY, can’t you mind what’s
said to you?, We have told you what was done on Thursday, you
inattentive old woman. “In the Lords?” Oh, ah, well, yes, in the
Lords the Chancellor brought in a Bill for Abolishing Imprisonment
for Debt, except by the County Courts. A Committee was appointed
to inquire into The Scandal, and LoRD RUssell, said that we were not
going to interfere in a war which is being waged on the Plate, between

Yes, and MR. GLADston E refused to tell MR. White whether the
Surplus Cake was to be cut before or after Easter, but has told since.

Friday. Question in the Lords about the sale of nineteen Irish
barracks. LoRD MALMESBURY said that they ought not to be sold for
a song. Slardy pend, as the French say. Some songs are worth
ninety and nine Irish barracks, for instance, the composition of DEAN
Swift's (which isn't a song, but the moral’s the same) about an Irish
barrack, and which contains an officer's views on classical education—
“Your Novids and BLUTARchs and OMERs and stuff,
By Jove, they don't signify this pinch of snuff.”
So we are not to make bargains with our lawyers. The Lords are
afraid that innocent clients will be done, and rejected the Chancellor's
Bill by 23 to 21.
A New Zealand debate Below, - chiefly notable because MR.
RoßBUçK vomited flames against the Maoris, and declared that
civilised man did a service to humanity by killing all wild beasts, of
whom the worst was the wild man. The House, to its credit, was
indignant at this display of Christian philanthropy, and the Colonial
Secretary bore testimony both to the valour and chivalry of the Maoris,
many of whom behaved, he said, in the spirit of true gentlemen.
MR. Locke brought in a Bill touching theatres, whereof Mr. Punch
will have more to say when he shall have seen its provisions. If it is
a Free Trade, measure, and if provision is made against Music Hall
abuses, it shall have the º: consideration of Mr. Punch, and he
is the oldest theatrical manager in the world.
THE RUIN OF THE RIVERS.
0 YE Gods and little fishes |
Deities, our streams that pour,
Finny tribe, that furnished dishes
Which we now can taste no more,
What a doleful revolution
Hath befallen your domains,
Bearing all the foul pollution
Of our cities through our plains !
Rus in urbe is right pleasant;
Urbs in rure pains the nose
When its refuse, as at }.
In the turbid streamlet flows,
Mixed with floods of poison, welling
From the factory and the mine,
How insufferably smelling!
Cast away the rod and line.
Trout can be no longer taken
In the stream whence eels have fled,
Which the halcyon has forsaken,
But the wagtail's feet can tread.
All the birds, as from Avernus,
Soon from putrid streams will flee.
Into what §: PLUTUs turn us?
What will poor old England be 2
River-gods, to swains imploring
Streams pellucid, from your urns
What is it that you are pouring
Into rivers, brooks and burns?
Fluid that, with reek ill-scented,
Loads so heavily the gales
That you should be represented
Not as bearing urns, but pails.
In its progress to the billows
Of your mixture people drink.
Rank and flush, the fattened willows
House the Naiads of the sink:
And their mistress, CLOACINA,
Holds with you divided reign
O'er what something is between a
River and an open drain.
With the instinct of the beaver
Whilst our money-makers toil,
Do they never dream of fever
Sweeping Britain's crowded soil?
To those spoilers if we give in,
This land will be, by-and-by,
Surely made unfit to live in;
Then it will be time to die.

JONES'S STUDIO. DOOR THREE WEEKS BEFORE SENDING IN PICTURES, TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
AN EXCUSE FOR EXETER HALL.
LIBERAL AND ToleRANT MR. PUNCH, - -
You and I, and all men of decent scholarship, refined minds,
enlarged views, and genteel connections, entertaining a due º:
for the greasy and half-educated middle classes, must rejoice at the
defeat of MR. NewDEGATE's motion for a Select Committee to inquire
into the extensive character and increase of monastic or conventual
societies in Great Britain. Must, we not, Sir? ...At the same time,
however, we cannot but be naturally disgusted with the largeness of
the minority in favour of that proposal, 79 to 106. But, Mr. Punch,
there is some excuse to be made for a few if not many of the members
of that minority. -
Of course, Sir, everybody who constitutes himself a party to any
measure in any way opposed to Roman Catholicism, exposes himself to
be looked upon as an Exeter Hall bigot, and an ignorant and vulgar
brute. The sanctity of all Roman Catholic nunneries is indisputable;
tyranny and cruelty are unknown within the walls of any of those
establishments. hosoever believes that there have ever occurred, or
can occur any exceptions to these rules, anathema esto, and besides that,
he is a fool and a Snob. No such a thing as abuse of the confessional,
on the part of a Roman Catholic priest, has ever transpired; notwith-
standing that an enormous instance of it was pleaded on behalf of the
defendant himself in the case of ACHILLI v. NEWMAN. All this is as
true as the miraculous translation of the House at Loretto. Nothing
goes on in any Roman Catholic convent that would not bear the light,
and edify the beholders. Nunneries might be built of glass for that
matter, and then they would be crystal conservatories, through which
only the flowers of sanctity would be visible, in full bloom. The thought
that any nunnery can require inspection or regulation can only exist in
the mind of a fanatical and prurient ass. There is no necessity whatever
for the supervision exercised over monastic establishments by the State
in Catholic countries.
But, Mr. Punch, though all Roman Catholic nunneries can be safely
presumed to be abodes of goodness and purity, there are some other
establishments of a cenobitical nature which cannot, Sir. There is an
A.; or Abode of Love, which, for aught we know, may be the
Abode of Humbug, and worse. The same may be said of all Protestant
convents and monasteries. What is sauce for the Roman Catholic
goose, unfortunately, must also be sauce for the anythingarian gander.
The unconditional allowance of Roman Catholic convents you see, Sir,
necessitates the like toleration of others not so immaculate. Any
religious impostor might keep a seraglio and call it a convent. That
consideration may have induced some of the members of MR. NEwde-
GATE's minority to vote for inquiry, which, we well know, could only
result in the glorification of the convents of the Roman Catholics, but
would be necessary for the merited exposure of the others, at present
without any. INSPECTOR.

SENTIMENT AND THE STREAMS OF ENGLAND.
In opposing Lord Robert Montagu's motion for a Bill to prevent
the rivers of England from continuing to be poisoned and polluted with
the sewage of towns and the washings of mines, and chemical works,
MR. BRIGHT is reported by the Morning Post to have said:—
“The noble Lord, he was sure, was not well acquainted with the state of things
throughout the country, and had a sentimental feeling that it would be much
better if all our streams ran pure water.”
Sentiment is fast declining in this country, thanks to the influence of
such men as the honourable Member from Birmingham, and others
who, in or out of Parliament, represent the breeches-pocket. These
estimable gentlemen are trying to make us all ashamed of sentiment by
sneering, under that name, at every impulse that does not tend to the
creation of material wealth. “Perish Nice, and perish Savoy l’” was
an exclamation which signally evinced this sensible contempt for senti-
ment. ... But the application of the derisive epithet, “sentimental,” to
“a feeling that it would be much better if all our streams ran pure
water,” surpasses that utterance of a highly unsentimental intellect.
MR. BRIGHT is made of sterner stuff than the queasy aristocrat, who
entertains a weak predilection for the purity of water which we drink.
What does bluff John BRIGHT care about drinking the Thames, to
which the sewers of towns are tributaries P “Your liquid manure to
its right use,” says LoRD Robert MonTAGU ; “’tis for the land.”
“Pooh!” we may suppose his opponent to rejoin; “it will do as well
for the cup.” If the Thames run drab as a member of the Society of
Friends, MR. BRIGHT would perhaps say, “What matter P’” he
matter is more easily swallowed by a man with MR. BRIGHT's unfas-
tidious views about the purity of rivers, than named by one of ordinary
squeamishness. The idea of the Roman Emperor about the inodorous.
ness of money falls far short of the philosophical insensibility of the
representative of Birmingham to the unpleasantness of diluted sewage.
To be sure, no Member of Parliament, who has sat out even one Session,
and has any nose at all, can say Thamesis non olet. MR. BRIGHT does
not say so, but he says, in effect, that if the Thames is offensive to
sentimental people, it is good enough for the beverage of people who
are not more nice than they need be. Some, whom others call senti:
mental, are apt to call those others sordid. , Such dainty creatures will
doubtless consider sordidness as having culminated in a strong-minded
derision of a preference of streams which run pure, water to streams
that run turbid with the dirt of money-making, and the abominations of
towns. But when MR. BRIGHT twitted LoRD R. Montagu with
sentiment, it was perhaps only scent he meant.

A NEW BALLAD OF SIR JOHN BARLEYCORN.
Showing how certain sely Knights of the Shire would have had SIR JOHN
lead their raid on the Treasurie, and how SIR John said them nay.
'Tis of SIR John THE BARLEycoRN,
That stalwart English knight,
And against the gamesome PALMERSTONE

To him there drew brave BARTELOTT,
And that stout squire, DUCANE,
That on a managed Essex calf
Came pricking o'er the plain.
- And SIR FITzRoy KELLY, good at speech,
And eke stout hand in stour;
And HENLEY out of Oxfordshire,
And MoRRITT of Rokeby Tower.
“Now, up and ride, JoHN BARLEYCORN,
Öur leader thou note be;
We are boune for an onslaught on PALMERSTONE,
And a raid on the Treasurie.
“And a doughty Captain there lacketh us,
A flag, and a battle-cry,
For Protection’s dead, and the Church nigh sped,
Andfjection time draws nigh.
“So º: thy casque upon thy head,
And mount thy dray-destrere,
And take thy malt-shovel for lance
And shout thy shout of “Beer!
“When England's yeomen the snow-white crest
That crowns thy }. shall see,
And hearthy shout, brave hearts and stout
They’ll flock apace to thee.
“And we that ride behind thy back
Will loud our trumpets blaw,
We have fighting will, and can wield the bill,
And eke the long-bow draw.
“And if that PALMERSTONE's to beat,
And the Treasurie to win,
'Tis under the banner of BARLEYCORN
That we shall come therein'
“For though the Treasurie walls be strong,
And mock a siege's fear,
Like Jericho's they’ll tumble down
To a shout—if the shout be “Beer!’”
Then up, and spake John BARLEY.coRN,
From the buttery where he lay:
“I redeye false knaves and forsworn,
And for answer give you ‘Nay!”
“I were an ass 'gainst BUxton and BAss
To ride a tilt with you,
d HARDCASTLE, out of Colchester,
That is my liegeman true.
“What if my father, Malt, they tax,
And my mother, Hops, they toll P
I’ve never a merry-man the less
Upon my muster-roll.
“And though I be an English knight,
No fighting man am I,
Albeit my blood is poured in flood
To a hot election-cry.
“Against LoRD DERby I bear no grudge,
Nor yet against PALMERSTONE,
All parties are one to John BARLEY.coRN,
That foe, save Lawson, has none.
“Here is my eldest son, Brown Stout,
And my youngest son, Small Beer,
And eke my grandson, Bitter Ale,
That is so j of cheer.
“In this your quarrel they shall not ride,
But keep their strength and skill,
To fight the LAwson of Carlisle,
And meet him, Butt to Bill.”
Then back they rode, those sely Knights,
Crest-fallen and forlorn,
For wool they went to John BARLEY.coBN,
And from him they came shorn.
BREACH OF PROMISE AWOLDED.
Young EUSTAce De Vokes fell precipitately in love with ANGELIQA
PENDRAGON. Between the pair ensued an intimacy which, under the
auspices of ANGELICA’s Mamma, soon ripened into an ... for
EUSTAGE had means. One day, however, the young man discovered a
bottle of ScRoggs' Capillary Thaumatopoion in the possession of his
betrothed, and ſound out that her dark brown hair had originally been
of another hue. He also ascertained that one of the maiden's front
teeth was terro-metallic. Incompatibilities of temper between himself
and the young lady also turned up. She dressed to please other eyes
than his own; she cared about the opinion of contemptible people, she
Fº dance-music to HANDEL's, and shopping to walking in the
elds. She would not take enough exercise.
In short, EustAce soon bitterly repented of the contract to which he
had committed himself. Hints, which he dropped to that effect, were,
however, so received both by Miss PENDRAGON and her Mamma as to
convince him that there was no hope that they would let him off. He
saw clearly that retirement from the situation would expose him to an
action for breach of promise of marriage.
EUsTACE tried to temporise in vain. The PENDRAGONs pressed him.
He had to choose between wretchedness and ruin. On the one hand
there was ANGELICA, with MRs. PENDRAGON for mother-in-law; on the
other the verdict, inflicting awful damages, of a British jury. What
was he to do? He took counsel one night with BRADshaw and
RUGGLEs over a cigar; and the result of their deliberations was that,
next morning, they all repaired to the residence, or, as BRADSHAw said,
den, of the PENDRAGONs; EUSTAce with something to say to those
parties: RUGGLEs and BRADSHAw as witnesses of his words. EUSTAce
spoke as follows:–
Miss PENDRAGON,+under the influence of feelings which have now
subsided, I made you a promise, the fulfilment of which will render me,
and I should think yourself too, miserable for life. I have entirely
ceased to retain any the slightest affection for you, and, this being the
case, if you insist on my marrying you, I shall lose all respect for you
as well. ... Our minds are so differently constituted as to render your
society insufferable to me, as mine, no doubt, would be to you if we
were obliged to live together. Wii you, then, relieve me from the
obligation which I have so rashly incurred P ff you will not, I will
rform it, as I am legally bound to do. But, in so, doing, I will not
incur the guilt of making a solemn vow which it will be impossible for
me to keep. I will not abuse a religious ordinance, and commit profa-
nation and sacrilege. I will not promise, on my faith, to love and
cherish you, when I know that I shall hate you and keep as much as I
can out of your way. I will not, I cannot, Miss PENDRAGON, lead you
to the altar. But if you will hold me to my bargain and exact—not
your pound but—your eleven stone ten, or whatever I weigh, of flesh;
if you insist on my forming with you a union which will be one of
mutual aversion and disgust, be it so. We will be married, if you say
we must, but not by a clergyman. No; our marriage shall take place
before the Registrar. We will not go to Church. Certainly not ; but
I will conduct you to the Registrar’s Office. La ci darem la mano.
Now, then ; if after what I have said, you are still determined to have
me, name the day, the woful day, and I will buy the ring, if that is
necessary, but not otherwise; and man, and man only, shall Joln us
together in unhallowed matrimony. Will you claim your bondman or
let me go? Speak!
ANGELICA could not, for some time. Her mouth had gradually
opened to its utmost width; so had her eyes, and she stood without
power to close either. MRs. PENDRAGON presented the same image of
blank astonishment. At last the younger lady gasped, |
“Wretch | *
“Monster 1" screamed the elder one. “Leave the house!”
“Good morning, ladies,” said BRADsh Aw and Ruggles.
“Farewell!” cried EUsTACE. And they hooked it.

CHEMICAL CANONISATION.

Half shame, half in-grain of fraternal slaughterings;
Duke FREDERick's coat erased, and in its stead , .
The Prussian arms displayed in Holstein's quarterings.
In chief, the double eagle, sable, spread,
With outstretched talons, beaked and gorged improper,
Below, BoCKUM DOLFF's hat, without a §
And a pen, saltire, with a 'bacco stopper.
A Pesth-tilent Example.
THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA, we are informed, has made a contribution
of 50,000 florins, and a yearly subscription of 12,000 florins, for the
º: of restoring the Hungarian Museum and Library at Pesth.
t seems that the 200,000 books in the library relating to Hun
are unbound. It is very natural that FRANCIs-Joseph should wish to
have the books bound as well as the people. Anything unbound,
particularly books, might spread the dangerous contagion of inde-
pendence
ELL me, you whose eye this meets,
The mastiest nuisance in the streets:-
Is’t the wintry slush and slime?
Or the smells in summer time?
Is’t the blinding sleet and rain,
From which no shelter you obtain?
Is’t the filth, when falleth snow:
Or the dust, when March winds blowº
While, snuggling where no eye can peep,
The scavengers serenely sleep.
Is’t the hansom, dashing by, -
That *::: the mud-flake in your eye?
Is 't the bustling, hustling throng,
Thro' ..º. fight your way along f
Isºt the chaff, that greets your ear,
When in a white hat you appear?
The yells of “sparrergrass” or “taters?”
The hussies with perambulators?
The struggles into which you get
With your umbrella, when 'tis wet?
The crinoline that chaſes your leg f
The tops that on your toe boys peg|P
The rumbling drays, the rattling cabs :
The hideous, painted, foreign drabs?
The bakers, who with slackened bit
Round every corner drive full split *
The ponderous vans that block the street,
Or crush the wheels of all they meet?
The filthy language that one hears,
When costermongers fall by th’ ears?
Is’t the thundering, blundering busses?
The babies, bigger than their “nusses,”
Who crowd the courts, and hindrance make,
Whene'er a short cut you would take?
The four-wheelers that creep and crawl?
The brats who whistle, shriek, and squall,
Or pelt you with a snowy ball?
Is’t the beggars at your heel?
The slippery bits of orange peel?
The ; mud that sticks like glue?
The butchers, who are greasy too f
The organs, that distract your mind
With their “demd low perpetual grind?”
The jabbering Jews who cry “Old Clo!”
The brutes who bawl out “Milk below!”
The squealing cats, the yelping dogs,
The smoky, choky, yellow fogs?
The blatant bands, the bellowing Blacks,
The foul museums of the quacks?
Such are the nuisances one meets,
Whene'er one walks the London Streets.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
RESTORATION OF POETRY IN THE EAST.
(By our own MACAULAY.)
The well-informed need
not be told—and we
do not care about
telling, anything to
the ill-informed —
that Poetry had its
origin in the East.
It is a curious fact,
that even to this day
- the cardinal points
have an influence on
the matter, and that
many more ballads
are sung in Rat.
cliffe Highway and
Houndsditch thanin
Belgrave Square and
Hyde Park Gardens.
Solomon was an
Oriental, so was
HomeR. M.R. Tex-
NYson lives in the
Isle of Wight, which
is more to the East
than most part of
this island; and the
town residence of
. Punch, the
- reatest bard of
ancient, or modern time, is situated at the foot of the noble tower of
St. Bride, and in the district to which the Government has assigned
the distinction of being regarded as East Central.
It cannot be surprising, except to the foolish persons who are sur-
prised at everything, that Poetry should always be inclined to flow back
to its ancient fountain. It is true that water does not do this, and in
so far the illustration may offend the shallow-minded, but to those who
recollect that poetry is not water, even when wishy-washiest, the image
will suffice for its purpose. We have to notice a case in which #.
Great Watershed, or shall we say Poetryshed, of the East has again
sent down a lavish stream of song.
Some persons are fools enough to believe everything; other persons
are fools enough to doubt everything. We despise both classes. But
if an ingenuous mind, affected and afflicted with hesitation, should pause
in uncertainty as to whether the verses which we are about to cite are
genuine and original, or what we believe is called, in the language of
the Great Vulgar and the small, “a sell,” we have pleasure in assuring
that mind that the poem is authentic, that it is the composition of a
student at the College of Delhi (in the East Indies), and that it has
reached us in company with such certificates as can leave no doubt of
its genuineness. In fact, the person who cannot perceive this, from
internal evidence, must, to use the mildest language, be a born idiot
and a blazing owl.
The poem was composed upon Christmas Day, and it is interesting
to note the treatment of that festival by a poet whose religion does not
recognise the celebration. His eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, transports
him from the gorgeous towers and golden groves of royal Delhi to the
isle of her conquerors, and he begins boldly:-
“Hail, Source of joy, ye Christmas day,
When all Britania seem delightful and gay.
From Meadows, the perfuming air how gently flow,
And all the flowery fields smile their happiness to show.
In the groves the feathered Choir fluently sing
And Church has begun its bell to ring.” -
The touching, simple recognition of “Church”, by one of another
faith, is very pleasant, and so is his idea that at Christmas our fields are
in flower, and our birds in song. But he soon returns to his own
glowing land:—
“To welcome thee, the morning in her crimson west,
With ornaments of golden clouds is drest.
At thy coming, the corn of India fields begin to ripe,
And Cold Countries come in sight full of Ice.
Every one enjoy thy pleasures fresh and new,
And partake with thee a pleasant View.
How the glorious flowers, the pink and purple rose,
Pay thee respect, and their fragrant leaves disclose.
All the riches are spent for thy name
And fill the English with joy and fame.
Even the poor, glorious of his race,
fºcks his table with different grace.
Thou art alike to be seen on the sea and land,
With a precious garland in thy hand.”
This is a noble
ð. Aſh
º º |
N
from the aged urns of the East, whence HomeR also drew. Where did
the Grecian bard obtain his idea of Juno P-we borrow the admirable
translation of EARL DERBY-
“with one hand resting on the fruitful earth,
The other laid upon the sparkling sea.”
It is profoundly interesting to find the young poet of Delhi and the
ancient of the Seven Cities bowing their heads at the same fountain.
But we proceed to the grandest passage in the composition—that in
which the eye of the poet is cast with an eagle swoop over the
nations:-
*On Thames bank, the immortal London, behold?
Filled with pomps, riches, and gold.
Let from heaven itself the holy Ganges flow,
And harvest on a hundred realms bestow,
Let Volgas stream run through countries and fine,
and Magnificent buildings glitter on the Rhine—
Let Chinese boast of their ancestory from the Moon—
And with white flattened nose the Laplander near Frozid Zone—
The Cashmirians be proud of their precious Wool,
And with the light of Stars the inhabitant on Southern pole.
Let Australians be glad of their golden sand,
And savage brown Indian of his productive land-
The Romans for being once the seat of pomp and fame—
And the Russians possessing great lands in vain-
The Egytians for having their pyramids sublime-
Each Country blessed with some particulars, at time.
Every Nation seem proud of whatever blessings they bore.-
From the Chinese Wall to the Atlantic Shore.-
Let the Persians possess their grandeous Train-
Be thou the blessings of English peaceful reign.”
Mankind, from China to Peru, has seldom been so daringly surveyed,
or so graphically depicted. The poet is brave, as MRs. BRowNING has
well said that all poets should be, and even while honouring our festi:
val, he claims holiness for his own Ganges, and records its alleged
descent from above. The scathing scorn at the Russian for his waste
of snows, bespeaks a loyal subject of Her whose army destroyed Sebas-
topol; but we would chiefly note the touch of human nature, in the
penultimate line. When all the recital is over, and the fatigued eye of
the muse is gently settling, it glances at the nearest neighbour of India,
and suddenly flings out another flash in honour of Persia. This is an
exquisite touch, . we fear that the large majority of mankind, who
are asses, will not appreciate it. We now approach the more fanciful,
yet not less graceful conclusion:-
“Come and the lofty towers of London behold,
Where the riches of the World are bestowed—
Where the fairies in crowds abound
Descend from Heaven to bliss that town."
Notice the artistic antepenultimate word. A dull pedant would
“correct” this with “bless,” as a thousand miserable pedants have
spoiled a thousand happy fancies, and lie, we trust, in the least pleasant
of DANTE's circles for their crime:–
“See that City, and with thy precious jeuil.
Bliss the inhabitants where they dwell—
At thy coming, the blue transparent Thame,
Swells with joy, for the Anglo-Saxon name-
For thy fame the learned poets even wish to rise—
Homer, Milton, and Dryden from the earth where they lies.”
Again we warn off exact and cold-blooded correctors. “Lies,” in
the last line, offends their prejudices. Not so with us. The poet
sought to show the one-ness and amalgamation of the glorious Three,
inseparably intertwisted and interwoven with one indissoluble cable for
the transit of electric poetry. And he used the singular verb. It is a
noble boldness. Our readers will grieve that we have but a few lines
more :-
“It is hard to say for the skill and polite,
Where real happiness has its original light.
Though even a swain would be apt to praise.
His Country pleasures good to him always-
The Noble say then to surpass in fine
From all mankind better is the mine.—
But Thou art the origin of that truth,
Giving old the same pleasure as to youth.-
All nature seem glad to survey
Of thy being followed by New year's day.
Welcome to thee, and thy everlasting name,
Ever be, and bliss the Britania Sons with thy fame.”
the affectionate apostrophe to it, the philosophical idea that some of
the pleasure of the season arises from its prompt departure, and the
truly Oriental “Live for ever” at the end, are features, which most
readers, whom we believe to be utterly ignorant and miserable, may
not understand, but which must enchant and enchain the enlightened.
For them and them only we have preserved and re-set this diamond
from the casket of India.
MUSICAL, NOTE.
IN what key would a lover write a proposal of marriage *
º e, but the line we have marked suggests a
solemn question. This Oriental poet must have drawn his inspiration

A BALLAD BY A BEEF-EATER.
HAVE you seen this jerked beef? 'tis a new sort of food,
From La Plata they ship it by tons, prime and good,
And tender, when pounded and soaked well, and stewed:
: , " Oh, the jerked beef of La Plata!
A platter give me of jerked beef.

Your butcher may say that as leather ’tis tough,
And your cook, at his bidding, declare in a huff
She can't even make soup of such horrible stuff:
Qh, the jerked beef of La Plata!
A platter give me of jerked beef. -
Pay no heed to their grumblings, but give it fair chance
Good dressing of course will its virtues enhance;
At the worst, 'tis as good as the bouillon of France.
Qh, the jerked beef of La Plata!
A platter give me of jerked beef.
'Tis more fattening than ass-flesh, which there, as one hears,
At the table of gourmands now often appears
And assists them no doubt to attain length of (y)ears:
Qh, the jerked beef of La Plata."
A platter give me of jerked beef.
Indeed, there are dozens of dishes, I’m sure,
That are neither sonourishing, wholesome and pure,
Or so certain a sharp touch of hunger to cure
As—oh the jerked beef of La Plata!
A platter give me of jerked beef.

Beef and mutton are fº tremendously dear,
And we soon must all turn vegetarians, I fear,

I treak their heads for you every now and them, but the Flunkeys and
the Toadies take a deal of punishment. You must bear it as well as you
can. I mean of course the being watched, and followed, and stared at,
and the having the smallest incidents in your daily life served up in
clumsy paragraphs to indulge the vulgar curiosity of some, and to be made
useful as a puff for others. I know how you must detest all this, for you
have been educated as beseems a highborn gentleman, and your own
character and habits are at once frank and modest. But...I assure you
once more that you must bear it. A cat may look at a king, and a toad
may look at a prince.
You cannot even take a bath without a paragraph being published recording that event, and telling us at what temperature you bathed,
and how you were º !. to be soaped and towelled like any other gentleman. Bless you, my dear Prince, the scribblers won't
stop at this. , The system will become more and more offensive as you grow, older, so you had better become 'pachydermatous at once. I
would say, don’t read the º but you must do that. It is very hard that you cannot be allowed to peruse an account of the fall of
Charleston, or of the death of the Porpoise, or of the flogging a garotter, without coming upon a statement that His Royal Highness the PRINCE
of WALEs was graciously pleased, yesterday, to have his hair cut; but you must take one thing if you want the other.
Yes, my dear Prince, things will grow worse and worse, and so I tell you. Be prepared to read, from time to time, that His Royal Highness
the PRINCE OF WALEs always peels his oranges instead of cutting through º and all, whereas Her Royal Highness the PRINCEss of
WALEs prefers the peel removed. That His Royal Highness, standing out of the rain at a keeper's cottage, expressed great admiration of a
large cat on the rug, and that Her Royal Highness desired to have one of the next kittens. That your Royal Highness left your umbrella at
the Zoological Gardens, and was, graciously pleased to accept the loan of one from MR. SAwNEy. BUTTER (a tradesman whose address
will be given), and that it was §.". the same evening by a footman from Marlborough House. That Her Royal Highness often
amuses herself in an evening by looking through the beautiful photograph-book which was manufactured for Her Royal Highness by MEssRs.
GUMM & StickLEBAck. That your Royal Highness has been most unjustifiably represented as having a bad cold, the fact being that you
happened to sneeze once or twice on Monday evening, from having taken a pinch of snuff out of a box which you accidentally found among
some old china. That Her Royal Highness takes cream with her coffee, and that cream is always placed near Her Royal Highness at breakfast,
in an exquisite little silver churn, purchased of Messrs. IchABoD & MEPhIBosh ETH, the celebrated silversmiths... That your Royal High-
ness is not particularly partial te perfumes, and that the only one you really care about is the Ethereal Essence of Tiger Lilies, manufactured,
&c. That H. Royal Highness has been pleased to declare that the first instruction of His Royal Highness, PRINCE Victor shall, come
from herself, and has already procured an ivory º: to be ready for the interesting purpose. That your Royal Highness amused, your
baby, one day during the frost, by tossing up snowballs at the nursery window, to the great delight of the royal child. That Her Royal Highness
nearly dropped her playbill over the edge of the box at the theatre the other night, but smilingly secured it against future peril by the agency
of a pin. #. your Royal Highness is pleased to take occasional notice of the groom who brings your horse on a hunting-day, and on a recent
morning you made the remark, as you mounted, “that the rain seemed .# to hold over.” That Her Royal Highness let her embroidery
needle #. a few afternoons since, and that it may be mentioned, as a proof of Her Royal Highness's consideration for her attendants, that
she picked it up herself, and calml E. with her work. That your Royal Highness gave a shilling to a child who was crying on the
Duke of York's steps because it ; ost a penny, and that Her Royal Highness, who was with your Royal Highness, would not go on until
she had ascertained that the juvenile martyr was acquainted with the route to the residence of its parents.
Yes, I repeat it, my dear Prince, there will not be anything that an unaffected and kindhearted couple can door say for many, years to
come, but will be snapped up and made into a paragraph, especially if that paragraph can serve the purpose of a puff for somebody. I promise
ou and the Princess that I will, as a celebrated Doctor from your Principality remarks, “ smite the noddles” of as many Snobs, sinnin
in this º: as I can, and where I can spoil their Puff-market, I will certainly do so. But the tribe is very large, perfectly shameless, all
exceedingly persevering, and moreover, there is a great lot.o K. who like to read such things, and who actually call them news. So you
must make up your mind to the worst, and must explain to the Princess that such scribbling is a trade, and that it is as much despised by
English ladies and gentlemen as it can be by yourselves.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
%) ſº
on DAY, March 13.
Wise in their gene-
ration, the Conserva-
tives have considered
that if they should
come into office it
may be convenient
to stand better with
the Federal Govern-
ment and its ad-
mirers than certain
utterances by LORD
DERBY and others
- may have seemed to
§ j render probable. So
is' it was arranged
that we should have
an American debate,
which should give
* the leader of Oppo-
sition in the Com-
mons an opportunity
of redressing the
.* MR, SEY-
- MOUR FitzGERALD
22 who was charged
with the initiative,
discharged his dut
- with his accustom
ability and adroitness, and made the Defences of Canada his peg. He was
quite generous, and thought that we ought to have allowed, the Federals to
increase their force on the Lakes, in order to suppress the Raiders. He saw
more conciliation than before in the American despatches to this country,
and he paid a gracious compliment to MR. ADAMs, who was in the House, and was,
no doubt, pleased. MR. FITZGERALD did not believe that the Yankees wished to go
to war with us, but accidents might produce collision, and we should be prepared to
defend Canada. MR. ForsTER attacked LoRD DERby, and made a strong Federal
speech, declaring that the North was fighting only to save the country.
Government—that is, MR. CARDwell—assured the House that our relations with
the States were most friendly, echoed the praise of MR. ADAMs, and stated that we
were to defend Quebec, an the Canadians Montreal, and that England was to pay
two-fifths and Canada three-fifths of the expense.
Then spake MR. DISRAELI. Of course he defended his Chief, whose opinions
and confidence he alike shared. The behaviour of the North to us had been marked
by amity and discretion. He would not prophesy as to the result of the war, but if
the South should be put down, he did not believe that the North would be eager to
begin war with an enemy at least as powerful and determined as the Confederacy.
Rising from a mere political level into philosophy, MR, DISRAELI observed that º º
American people were a Territorial . and that ARISTOTLE, who h
taught us nearly all our wisdom, had declared that persons addicted to tilling were
not given to killing. Still, at the end of the war the country would be in a disturbed
state, and as there was no saying what might ; we ought to be prepared for
anything. He did not care for American Rowdy Rhetoric, which he ää not believe
represented the feelings of the people. All this was so calm, statesmanlike, and
opportune, that we need hardly add that MR. DISRAELI could not be
“Content to dwell in decencies for ever,”,
but relieved his mind by finishing off with a slashing onslaught on the Government,
for the contradictory opinions which its members had expressed on the war.
The Opposition having said its say, divers other gentlemen had theirs. Suffice it
to Mr. Punch to record that MR. Lowe believed that we could not defend Canada,
and had better tell her so, and that Lord Robert Cecil, thought that we ought
not to humbug Canada as we had humbugged Denmark. MR. BRIGHT then .
vered one of his most aggressive and effective orations, praising the Yankees,
abusing England for having distrusted and been harsh with them, declaring that
most of our papers had been lying about America ever since the war began, and now
were trying to back out of their blunders, that the City alarms were the alarms of
share jobbers, who were always in the wrong, that we all felt rather ashamed of
ourselves, and had º of conscience about the way we had treated America,
that the Federals had no idea of warring with us, that in the centuries to come we
should be proud that from the loins of England had sprung the millions of prosperous
Americans, and that if we now acted with discretion, the two great Commonwealths
would be seen marching abreast, the Parents and Guardians of freedom and justice.
Right or wrong as to the past or the future MR. BRIGHT may be; but Mr. Punch,
who, like Robin Hood, in Ivanhoe, always adds his holloa when he sees a good blow
or a good shot, declares that to-night the Quaker stood up to his work like a man.
The PREMIER, nevertheless, like an old hand in the ring, made his mark on the
Birmingham Boy, and put in the neat one that MR. BRIGHT's speech, which seemed
so fiery, was eminently conciliatory to America, for nothing pleased men so much as
to be told that they were ill-used. He easily, disposed of the charges against
Government, and then declared that he believed that both the Government and the
people of the North were well disposed to us, but as the best security for peace was
the ability to resist war, we should take all precautions for the defence of Canada.
And thus ended the most important debate of the Ses-
ision, and inasmuch as it may be referred to, because of
subsequent events, Mr. Punch has, in the exercise of a
discretion which it would not be wise in any one to attempt
to control, recorded it with some fulness, and has abstained
from adorning his record with those exquisite and spark-
ling gems of wit which might distract the attention of the
à. from the sentiments of the Representatives of Public
plnion. -
MR. HENNessy then attacked MR. NewDEGATE in regard
to a correspondence between himself and DR. ULLATHoRNE
Catholic Bishop, about the imprisonment of nuns, and
called on the ultra-Protestant to apologise. MR. NEWDE:
GATE had not the slightest intention of doing so, and
referred DR. ULLATHoRNE’s statements to some supposed
oath to keep priestly secrets inviolable. THEO Donoghue
did not believe MR. NewDEGATE in earnest, and thought
that he went away into secret places to laugh privately at
the stories he told publicly. Here the matter may drop
Mr. Punch thinks, for the present, or the above trio, an
the Bishop, had better go in four, cabs to the Nunhead
Cemetery, # the subject out, and bury it decently.' .
Tuesday. The Irrepressible Nun up again; this time in
the House of Peers. EARL Russell, had to explain the
story of MARY RYAN, a lunatic nun, who had been illegally
removed from this country, but who, he thought, had now
better be left where she was. Lord MALMESBURY sug-
gested that SIR GEORGE GREY should be told to read a
general and severe lecture to the heads of convents.
The hardy Northmen and the softer Orientals then
rushed into fierce conflict,, and soon the spears of the
Wikings were red with the blood of their prostrate foes.
“Hurrah for the Hypokeimenoi!
For the men who dwelt"below
In the crystal mines
Where the golden vines
And the silver fig-trees grow !”
The fact, less poetically stated, was that the Great Nor-
thern and the Great Eastern Railways had a fight over a
new Bill desired by the latter, and that Parliament, con-
sidering that a decision last year had induced the G.N.
to undertake an enormous new outlay, refused to sanc-
tion the rival project—162 to 121 were the numbers,
and they e together such a house as rarely assembles
on questions of mere public interest, and—an intelligent
| public may add any remark which occurs to that respectable
ody.
§out sixty-four years ago something was done in India
of which SIR FITzRoy KELLY, in the name of PRINcs
Azeem JAH, to-night º in a speech of appropriate
length. There was a debate, SIR CHARLEs, Wood, said
that the Prince's demand was monstrous, and the House
affirmed its monstrosity by 53 to 38, and put the cover on
the jar, as MR. Cox might have said. “A zeem to have
heerd of this here afore,” as MR. WHALLEY might have
added, affecting a rustic dialect. ...We are unprepared to
assert that either said anything half so ridiculous.
Wednesday. A Bill containing various apparently excel-
lent suggestions for improving the Jury System was opposed,
successfully, by her Majesty's Government. Among other
comforts, jurors' bodies are to be still starved for the im-
provement of their minds. And we send Missionaries to
the savages.
Thursday. LoRD CHELMsFord pushed on his Bill for
allowing Counsel in Criminal Cases, to speak twice, even
when the criminal called no evidence. Lord CRAN wortii
made the very profound remark that such a permission
would lengthen trials, but the CHANCELLOR did not see
that this, which is certainly probable, was an objection,
inasmuch as the justice and not the brevity of an English
trial is vulgarly held to be one of its chief merits.
Lord STRATFoRD DE REDCLIFFE (which reminds us that
St. Mary Redcliffe, at Bristol, is likely to come down
if not repaired, in which case we shall labour to get Bristol
disfranchised, and all her inhabitants sent to Bath) wants
the new map of the frontier between Turkey and Persia.
It has cost £57,000 already, and it is well that John BULL
is an Atlas that can bear such taxation for maps. What
awful capitalists MR. STANFoRD and MR. WYLDE must be,
if their magnificent, cartography is prepared at such prices.
There is a practicable joke here about MAPPIN, but we are
not going to make it, because we consider cab and omnibus
advertisements a nuisance.
LoRD HARRowby objects to the Education order which
submits children under six to “examination for results.”

We should prefer examining them for goodies and toffee, and if none

for supplying the deficiency. LORD GRANVILLE, thought that the
small creatures ought to be present at the examinations. “He has
no children.” LoRD LYTTLEToN, who is a father, and LORD REDEs-
DALE, who deserves to be one, protested against, formenting the
little ones. However, they are to be tormented until further notice.
The case of the unfortunate Coventry ribbon weavers which has
been so often, and so ably pressed by SIR. Joseph PAxton (as
Government said) was to-night urged by his colleague, MR. TREHERNE.
Nothing, said MR. GIBsoN, can be done. All the mischief, said MR.
BENTINGK, has been wrought by, free-trade. MR., WHITE made
the bold suggestion, that “the Illustrious Lady who ruled despotically
over the fashions of Europe” should be asked, in the interest of
her husband's subjects at St. Etienne, as well as of QUEEN VICTORIA's
at Coventry, to set, the fashion of wearing ribbons instead of gimp
or passementerie. The Countess of PUNCH will be perfectly happy to
go over, at the request and charge of the nation, as a deputation to
make this request of the beautiful Empress, but not until the March
winds are put down.
The Army Estimates, MRs. GRUNDY. We want £14,348,000 for the
soldiering purposes, a saying of about £800,000 on last year. There
are some reductions, which LoRD HARTINGTON said were improve:
ments in the Service. Government thinks, that the Armstrong Coil
Guns are the best we have yet obtained. The price of our new forts
will not exceed £3,000,000—three millions, M'm. GENERAL PEEL, said
that the Tories had been more economical than the fiberals. if you
wish to read what the various millingtary hoxifers said, MRs. G.,
you are at liberty to go into any penny reading-room at your own
expense, and see.
Friday. The Covent Garden Opera Programme came out, and Mr.
Punch was far too much interested in examining MR. Gye's plan
of *}. to pay much attention to the debates. ... We are certainly
to have L'Africaine, if it comes, out in Paris, and Paris or not, we
are to have Il Flauto Magico, which we regard as better news still,
especially if anything like a reasonable libretto has been substituted
for the insane rubbish which has hitherto been so mischievous to the
noble opera. There is a deal of jº promise in the programme. As
for Parliament, we did not attend,+who would go out in a venomous
wind,-but there was a Polish debate, of no utility, and on a dis-
cussion on treaties, MR, FoRSTER affirmed the ignorance of the Foreign
Office, and was told by MR, LAYARD that commercial gentlemen
wished all higher considerations set aside for the sake of trade.
Police rates were complained of, and MR. WHALLEy, said that the
police had established a reign of terrorism over the Magistrates. It
is not exactly that, indeed it would be unreasonable to expect exacti-
tude in any description by MR, WHALLEY, but the Magistrates, with
certain admirable exceptions, are too much in the habit of believing
the police, who, as was said by the late MR. O'Connell of somebody,
are too much in the habit of “postponing the interests of the truth
to the purposes of the moment.”
BRAvo, PIO NONo 1
UR readers are hereby, con-
gratulated on the greatly im:
proved health, and spirits of
the Pops. . Pius is himself
again-physically, that is to
say; for, to be sure, he is not
now what he was in 1847, an
apostle of progress in occupa-
tion of the Apostolic See.
A calamity to, the jocular
universe greater than it would
be to the serious Monde,
would result from the demise
of the Triple Crown. How
do we know that the next
wearer of that symbolical sub:
stitute for a chimney-pot will
§ so many fantastic tricks
efore high Heaven, as to
supply the place in the gal-
lery of European comicalities
which will have been vacated
by his predecessor?
A recent letter from Rome
informs us that:—
“Soon after twelve o'clock the
Pope received in the Throne-room
at the Vatican a deputation of
- about 200 foreign Catholics—non-
Pontifical Italians being comprised
in the category. An address of
sympathy, devotion, and attach-
– ment was read to his Holiness,
- who replied in a few touching
words, concluding with blessing
the assemblage, and presenting
- them with his foot to kiss.”
Have we any reason to be
satisfied that the next Pontiff
—may his accession be pro-
tracted a thousand years l—
will be capable of rewarding a
deputation, come to pay him
their compliments, by pre-
senting them with his foot to
himself by such tremendous burlesque as that, deserve
having his foot to kiss, and more; for the Holy Father
º with great ºr. favour each of them, in addition,
with a good kick in the mouth.
In the late Invito Sacro the Pope has reaffirmed the
comic degrees of his Encyclical condemning civil and
religious liberty. He disdains to allow, his denunciations
to be understood in the non-natural sense officiously
prºposed for them by his apologists. The Pope is
‘ thorough.” If he is confronted with the inexorable logic
of facts, he meets it with the º inexorable logic of
Popery. He is what Britons call a regular out-and-outer,
a character for which they entertain a great respect, just
such as they had for the late Colonel, SIBThorp, irre-
spectively of his politics, and have for the }. MARQUIs
DE Boissy, notwithstanding his rabid Anglophobia.
What fun it will be if the Pope, who, with a courage truly
admirable, shrinks from no consequences of his theology,
shall shortly publish another Bull, condemning all the phy-
sical sciences, especially astronomy, chemistry, and geology
as diabolical illusions, corresponding to the witchcraft o
the Ages of Faith ! The promulgation of such an edict by
his Holiness is to be expected daily. Our Roman Catholic
Fº boast of the great increase of their numbers.
n the mean time, the Holy Father has virtually excom-
municated all of them who are not fools enough to swallow
the dogmas of his Encyclical, and must thus have cut the
one infallible Church down to small proportions. Eh, SIR
GEORGE Bow YERP How many of you are any better than
heretics?
Be that as it may, we are glad to know that the Holy
Father is “alive and kicking,” to speak in the vernacular
although he forbore to kick those whom he might and
should have kicked in the chaps. Instead of ugly stories
about erysipelas and other ailments, we rejoice to hear that
the Servus Servorum is once more his own man, although
we cannot accept his Invito Sacro, whereby we also should
be invited, to kiss his foot. You are going on admirably,
PIUs, old boy. Go it!
SPORTING NEWS.
THE Hunting Season being nearly over, there was a
rand meeting of The Sly Fox Club, in Leicestershire, the
§. old Fox in the Chair. The Foxes congratulated one
kiss? Are there not some grounds for fearing that he may shrink from the
performance of an act so charmingly grotesque *
º: funny, in its way, with the absurdity of giving people his foot to kiss,
ollowing extravagance, also ascribed to his Holiness by the writer above
was the
quoted:—
another on, the capital sport they had had during the past
season, and hoped that no unsportsmanlike vulpecide would
thin their ranks before next November. There was a fine
show of brushes. The Chairman said that the rising, gene-
ration couldn’t do better, when, Cub-hunting should com-
mence, than follow the admirable example set them by
“On Thursday the Pops published a decree for the canonisation of a Spanish Inquisitor-FRA their parents. Coverts were laid for twenty. The proceed.
PETER D'ARBUEs—who was killed by the Jews at Saragossa.”
If it is true that the sublime borders on the ridiculous, the converse is also true,
and certainly the canonisation of a Spanish Inquisitor is an instance of the ridiculous
that borders on the sublime. The devotees who venerate a Pontiff that signalises
ings were fully reported in Reynard's Weekly Paper.
PITY without relief is like mustard without beef.

NOTES ON THE NAME OF CAESAR.
THE EMPEROR has raised a discussion on the etymology of JULIUs
CAEsAR's name. Some will have it to have been derived from caesar,
Punic for an elephant, because an ancestor of his slew one, peradventure
with a long bow, which would have been required to send an arrow
through the hide of that Jºº.º. uadruped. Others contend
for a reason which would have rendered the
same name applicable to MACDUFF; but perhaps, with respect to the
cassarian operation, they put the cart before the horse. The more
plausible opinion is, that the name in question was derived from caesaries,
a thick head of hair, which one of JULIUS CAESAR’s progenitors was not,
as superficial scholars suggest, born with, but grew up without. The
ancient Romans were very much given to heavy chaff and calling Pººl.
names, some of which, like Rufus, were literally expressive of their
personal peculiarities, whilst others were perhaps ironically so. As a
matter of fact, JULIUS CAESAR is known to have been bald, and, Row-
LAND’s Incomparable Macassar Oil not having been as yet invented,
to have worn a laurel chaplet in *; of a wig, or of a black velvet
scull-cap, which, when he got made Pontifex Maximus, would have
become his Holiness. He probably took after his ancestor, called
CAESAR for want of a caesaries, in a playful figure, quasi lucus a mon
lucendo, as his countrymen used to say, and as ours might give ToM
THUMB and CoMMODoRE NUTT the names of Gog and MAGOG.
If the original Cæsar derived his nickname from an artificial head of
hair, the name of CAESAR would seem to correspond nearly to that of
W1GGINs.
In quitting this subject, we may remind our readers that, in the time
of our own immediate forefathers, the thick head of hair, from which
the name of CAESAR is said to have originated, was termed a BRUTUs.

who knows how to hit the happy Medium.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A STATUE AT LARGE.
It was past twelve o’clock in London generally. Past twelve o’clock
in Leicester Square particularly. After life’s fitful fever Leicester
Square, that is the dwellers in Leicester º slept well.
rom their slumbers they were aroused by a voice, wild, unearthly.
Was it a Banshee? or cats? It might have been a Banshee, as no one
could speak on that subject from experience, but everyone said it wasn’t
cats. Again that wailing chauntl It was dismal enough to be a comic
song; but then the Alhambra had been shut up since midnight, so it
couldn’t be that.
Again: louder, louder, more unearthly, more unmusical than before.
-- #, !” said Puttick AND SIMPson, auctioneers in the Square.
PuTTIck was asleep on the second-floor front, and SIMPson was reposing
in an adjoining room. “Who’s that?”
“I should like to knock him down, whoever it is,” growled SIMPson,
under the clothes, professionally.
The sound once more. - -
- § going, gone!” cried PUTTIck AND SIMPson, and jumped
out of bed.
“It’s strange,” said SIMPson, putting his head out of window.
-“No, it isn't,” said MR. STRANGE, looking out from a turret in the
Alhambra.
BICKERS AND SON, booksellers, peered forth from their first-floor
windows, with faces that spoke volumes. -
The distinguished Foreigners at the Europe, Provence, and Sabloniere
Hotels shivered in their night-caps, but couldn't be distinguished at all,
it was so dark.
“Pºaps, it's that HoRACE WIGAN," muttered, MR STRANGE, to
himself, “he’s always disturbing me. Never mind, I’ll have a Settling
Day with him.” So saying he grasped the water-jug.
The voice was singing, harshly, gratingly.
“I can’t see anything,” said M.R. STRANGE. -
Inventive genius came to his aid: in a minute a yard of magnesium
wire illumined the Square.
The cats shrieked and fled. -
A Policeman, in a º sprang his rattle.
In another minute the Duke of SUTHERLAND and Lond Richard
GRosvenoR were on the spot on his Grace's fire-engine.
Diable / Der Teufel / exclaimed the distinguished foreigners.
“It’s the Statue singing,” said MR. STRANGE.
“It’s the Statue !” cried PUTTick AND SIMPson.
“It is the Statue !” chorussed Bickers AND SoN.
“I’ll pump on him,” said the Duke. -
“No, don’t throw cold water on him,” observed his Lordship, “ or
you’ll put him out.”
“I wish I could hear what he's saying,” said MR. STRANGE. “Turn
your head this way, will you?”
“Can't,” said the Statue, who was looking straight at PUTTIck AND
SIMPson’s.
“Encore!” shouted the auctioneers.
“Encore, by all means!” cried the illustrious party, seated on the
re-engine.
MR. GREEN, who, with a large party of friends, had been summoned
from Evans's, here stept forward, and offered to hum the statue music
from Don Giovanni to the Dear Boy, dear Boy on the horse.
"I can't come down, MR. GREEN,” returned the Statue, politely but
sadly, “and if I could, my misfortune, in the matter of ſegs, would
prevent my walking into your sup er.”
: Sing away, old Boy!” cried the occupants of the fire-engine.
“Sing...sharp-I mean look sharp,” said MR. STRANGE, who was
now holding out the magnesium wire with the tongs.
“It’s a little thing of my own,” explained the Statue, bashfully
“founded upon a poem written by a gentleman to whose namesake f
dedicate º; present production.”
* Name? Name?” from the fire-engine.
“CowPER,” answered the Statue. “I will now oblige the company
with my
VERSES.”
(Written by the Statue during his solitary abode in the centre of the
Leicester Square Desert.)
“I’m monarch of all I survey,”
Myright leg is minus a foot,
My ſeſt has been taken away,
And another they haven’t yet put.
“Oh, Solitude, where are thy charms?”
I've cried tilliºn black in the face;
Which black won't come off with the storms
Ofrain in this horrible place.
“I’m out of Humanity's reach,”
Except when 'tis armed with a stone;
* It is needless to observe that our reporter was the first at the square railings.
Is there no stern policeman who'll teach
The small boys to let me alone?
The cats that roam over the square
“My form with indifference see,”
The sparrows will perch on my hair,
Their conduct is shocking to me.
My horse has a stick to support
is leg, which (observe the right fore)
Is extended, as if he’d been taught
The trick known as shaking a paw.
Thºugh summer's sun Nelsos may bake
On his friends grouped around him 'twill shine;
There’s a coil 'bout his legs; oh, do make,
MR. CowPER, a coil about mine!
Why can't I be placed in the Strand?
Charles thinks he adorns Charing Cross!
And yet I would much rather stand-
I shºuld like to get off my horse.
With legs, I might take CANNING's place,
I’m sure he must want change of air,
M; dress quite a classical grace
Would shed over Hanover Square.
But the Sparrow is gone to his nest,
The Cat is laid down in her lair,
Even here is a season of rest,
Let each to his mattress repair.
Dear me! why, what colds you have caught :
The weather, 'tis true, isn’t hot.
You'll all be laid up! Cheerful thought,
That reconciles me to my lot.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS ABOUT JULIUS CAESAR.
Julicum Cesarem.—Yes, R.S.V.P. were the letters inscribed on
the ancient Roman banners. It was a proud boast, and nobody knew
what it meant. - -
Billy S.—Why did the populace want to tear the poetin SHAKspeARE's
Julius Cæsar?—Why, because he was a miserable CINNA.
Antony fººt was the Rubicon?–It was a º red
wine, a favourite with the Romans. Cºsa R used to be a regular
bottle-stopper; so, as there were perpetual requests to him to “pass
the rubicon,” his doing it of his own accord, was marked as a red letter
day in the Roman Calendar. The dinner-table cry was afterwards
shortened into “Pass the ruby;” and, in this abbreviated form, it has
been handed down to our own time. -
Rum ti iddity rum Ti-berius-CesAR was certainly what Cockneys
call an 'eroin Roman History, but it does not therefore follow that his
wife was an era in Roman History. - -
Hard Cashius.-The name of CesAR's wife?. She was Pompey’s
sister, and, everybody knows it well, was celebrated in history as
MADAME DE Pompeybour.

THE STAGE FROM THE FRONT.
WHEN CHAuceR spoke about the Clerke's power of “entuning” through his
nose, he never claimed for it any particular humour; and when low comedians, or
those who are thrust into that position, adopt a decided nasal tone of delivery, the
audience may be pardoned if they are unable to see the fun of it. Two glaring
instances of this elocutionary vice have been lately brought before the public–
one at the St. James's Theatre, and the other at the Princess's. MR. FELIX
Rogens at the first house, and MR. Dominick MuRRAY at the second, are far from
being oily comedians, but their extremely dry style of acting might be rendered
more endurable if they delivered their words direct from the natural organs of
speech. , Dr. Cantwell, Mawu'orm, the conventional Quaker, and the equally con-
ventional.Yankee of the Stage may be all very amusing in their way, but their
peculiarities of pronunciation are apt to become tiresome when given to all
characters. MEssRs. Rogers and MURRAY are not the founders of this nasal
school, nor are they its only pupils.
. The revival of The School for Scandal at Drury Lane, has had an air of novelty
º to it, from the circumstance of the two Surfaces being played by
military gentlemen. MAJOR-GENERAL ANDERson and LIEUTENANT-Colonel
WALTER LAcy, who represented the Joseph, and Charles of the comedy, were
recognised as old favourites, notwithstanding their heavy cavalry moustachios. Sir
Peter Teazle Qught, to have had a Crimean beard to make the performance har-
monious, but Ms. PHELPs preferred to be correct and singular.
What is an “apex actor?” or an “apex play ?” . A gentleman writing in
the Era has used these terms, and every dramatic critic ought to be grateful for
any new discovery in critical language, but no copyist will be safe in using such
phrases until they are clearly explained. An “apex actor,” we imagine, is an
acrobat. at the top of a pole; and an “apex play” must be some posthumous
production of PEAKE's which is popular in the provinces.
Don’t be Rude.
A PLAINTIFF the other day claimed remuneration from a Defendant for “Paving

introducing a critic to a Manager.
DE MORNY AND DE MORTUIS.
TWO PICTURES.
FROM LIFE.
A YouTH of wild excess, where every vice-
The glutton’s, gambler's, letcher's, had its turn,
Yet ruled by a cool blood and brain precise,
Which nor shame checked nor sin could rouse to burn.
A manhood from sheer foulness scarce redeemed
By one short interval of soldier-life,
Where scorn of all things stoic courage seemed,
And won such honour as finds root in strife.
That warfare o'er, and those cheap palms still green,
A glad return to the Parisian sty,
With appetites for briefºrestraint more keen,
Large lusts to feed, and lessened means to buy.
Then arts of industry, in stock and share,
The gambler's practice to the Bourse º:
With that cool blood, that brain, alert and ware,
Still keeping roguery on law's windward side.
Till, when the House of Orleans met its doom,
And the Republic had out-played its hour,
His ºf purpose veiled in studied gloom,
The Nephew of my Uncle crept to power.
Then this great boursier laid his sceptre down,
To one more great than he yielding the pas, -
The master-gambler who all coups dared crown
With that colossal coup, the coup d'état.
As a half-brother—half in brains and blood-
Should serve half-brother, he this master served,
With a cool daring, by no bar withstood,
That brooked no check, and at no terror swerved.
And he had his reward: so near the Throne
What secret men would buy but he would sell?
The “turn of the market” now was all his own,
And practice taught him how to use it well.
So he .#. and calm and cool. -
Courteous of speech, of manners villed fair,
Ruling French legislators with a rule
That English lacqueys had not brooked to bear;
With everything that the world's wealth could buy,
With nothing that the world's respect should bring;
And when he died he could find tongues to lie, ..
Hands flowers of falsehood o'er his grave to fling!
AFTER DEATH.
First SCHNEIDER took the brush, couleur de rose
Laid in for ground, and with bold hand began
To model up, in lineaments and pose,
The portrait of great statesman and good man.
“Firm in his principles, in judgment wise
Prompt to conceive as he to act was skilled:
Order and progress graced alike to prize
Noblest support of Throne as nobly filled.
“Such in high office he ne'er ceased to be :
Such in the public love we saw him grow,
And in his colleagues' hearts, that bleed with me,
Dearer and dearer, as our loss we know ;
“Impartial President, just and unblamed,
He with firm hand discussion's licence checked
Admitting all to argument, he claimed
For men and institutions due respect.
“In private life beloved, his generous heart
Drew all affections with resistless power:
In W. life, his the wise counsellor's part,
Who reads aright the lesson of the hour.”
As large of line, of colouring as brave
As this from SchNEIDER's pencil bright and bland,
The second portrait, at that open grave
Dashed in by ready Rouſſº's facile hand.

THE PAPAL STATES.
(From our Own.)
March 17th.-The Pope is in good health. He had an audience the
other day: pit quite full—no half-price. French in arms not admitted.
later in the evening there was a game of hunt the Papal slipper, which
the Pope enjoyed amazingly. - --
The other day the Pope drove to Pimlico."
His Holiness is, as you are of course aware, very fond of billiards.
Some few favoured ones are allowed to go into St.Peter's, and see the
canons the Pope makes. When I told his Infallibility this sally, the
ood-natured. Pontiff laughed until the tears, ran down his cheeks;
the wily Cardinal who was *::: with him took advantage of P1 using

he calls me BILLY), “it’s all very well to say, ‘The Pope he leads a
happy life,’ but I ‘īl teii you in confidence—” What he said I cannot
of course repeat. But mark my words. The French will not leave
Rome to-morrow. If they do, I give up all chance of a Cardinalate, for

APRIL 1, 1865.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI 125
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
on DAY, March 20.
LORD STANHQPE,
who is entitled to
be heard with re-
spect on any sub-
Jéct, and especially
on any subject in
which posterity will
be interested, made
an earnest protest
against burying the
new Temple of Jus-
tice, instead o
placing it where it
would ornament
London. But the
site seems to be
settled, and the
stronghold of Law
will be Castle-Carey.
MR. H. BERKE-
LEY, of the Ballot,
does not believe in
the machinery by
which black balls
are to be deposited
in the ships of our
enemies; and he
brought on another
American debate. The MARQUIs of HARTINGTON stood to his guns. The Larger
BENTinck, abused the plans for defending Canada. This gentleman has taken &
dislike to his chief, MR. DISRAELI, and often walks out of the House, in a marked
manner, in order to illustrate his disloyalty, CAPTAIN JERVIs said that the cry of
invasion was a Bogie. There were some other speeches, and the rest of the night
was devoted to the service of Mars, God of War, and good progress, was made
with the Estimates for the support of the priests and ministers of the Bellipotent.
Tuesday. MR. A. SMITH made an onslaught upon the Office of Works and the
Woods and Forests, charging the authorities with all kinds of waste, mismanage-
ment, corruption, and other bad vices, and he demanded a great reform, which MR.
FREDERICK PEEL assured him was unnecessary. -
MR. MossELL, who is a moderate Catholic, obtained leave to bring in a Bill for
doing away with the oaths which his fellow-believers have to take on being admitted
to office. They have to renounce the Catholic doctrine that Sovereigns excommuni-
cated by the Pope may be deposed by their subjects, and they have also to abjure
all intention of upsetting the Church of England. Mr. Punch has the grimmest
disfavour for all useless oaths, because they savour of profanity, and inasmuch as
the excommunication of a Sovereign by the Pope is usually an excellent means of
strengthening that Sovereign's K.'"; (as may be observed, your Holiness, in the
case of VictoR-EMMANUEL, King of Italy, your Holiness), we are not much
afraid of the process. The QUEEN of ENGLAND is believed to be in a chronic state
of excommunication, but we are not aware that the HowARDs, or SIR GEORGE
Bowy ER, or the majority of the Irish Members, entertain any intention of effecting
the deposition of the SoverEIGN. We had rather trust to the loyalty of the
Catholics and to the fears of the Papists, than to any oaths. As for the Church
oath, MR, Monsºli, said, with justice, that it was absurd to exact it from men who
would maintain the Protestant establishment, as a bulwark against infidelity, and
not to require it of MR. BRIGHT and MR.H.ADFIELD, whose first, words on
awakening, when their servants knock with the shaving water, are Delenda est
Ecclesia, or a free and easy translation thereof. Moreover, we flatter ourselves that
we are quite able to maintain the Church against all comers, and do not wish to be
beholden to anybody's forbearance. Government did not resist the introduction of
the Bill, but we need º, say that MR. NEwBEGATE had an instant vision of the
window at Whitehall, and MR.WHALLEY beheld St. Paul's in the fire, which he is
not likely to kindle in the Thames. In the course of his speech MR. NEW DEGATE
grew vehement, and bonneted, MR. HoRsFALL, but as the great, Protestant
apologised like a ſº and has sent Mr. Hoºsrail, a new hat, we really
mention it only in honour of the orator's energy.
MR. SHERIDAN then beat the Government soundly. Despite the protests of the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, that he ought not to be bound to anything, and
that votes ought not to be taken on money matters until he should have cut the
Surplus Cake, after Easter, the House condemned the tax on Fire Assurance. . Mr.
'Punch regrets any annoyance, to his friend...MR. GLADSTONE, and feels, that he,
Mr. P., ought to apologise to him, MR. G.; for publishing an epigram which pro-
duced this effect. Mr. Punch having said that he would hear of no assurance duty
except the duty of assurance, the tax was stabbed by that glittering poniard. But
in the interest of Society he will stick at ; or rather, at everything that
deserves sticking, and this tax on prudence merited the fate which it met to-night.
Wednesday. SIR Colm AN O'LoGHLEN endeavoured to carry a Bill for giving
Irishmen an opportunity of travelling on Railways upon, Sundays. . As he was
defeated, we have little to say on the subject, except that two points in the debate
may be worth notice. One is, that an Irish Member declared that Limerick was a
dreary place, and he could understand the desire of people to get away from it on
Sunday. Then what does the poet mean by stating in
song that “Limerick is beautiful.” Of course we agree
with another poet, the late MR. PRIOR, that one need not
“swear to the truth of a song,” but this flagrant contradic-
tion demands explanation, Secondly, it was declared on
high authority, that a Railway is a public road, and any
person may put carriages on it. On the faith of this state-
ment, Mr. Punch has ordered a private engine and smoking
carriage of his own, and having occasion to go to Edin:
burgh, to see the new statue to PROFEssoR WILSON, and
take a few drams with the editor of the Scotsman, with
ALEXANDER SMITH, the R". and with PROFESSOR BLACKIE
the Englishman, he will require the road on Wednesday
next, and he hereby gives notice that the line is to be kept
clear, as he never stops, except to smile at the pretty gir
at the Peterborough station, and to punch the head of a
surly porter or so at Carlisle.
Thursday. EARL RussFLL made a Speech intended to
promote friendly feelings between us and the Federals. He
intimated that there was a probability that the Reciprocity
Treaty might, not be put an end to, that the American
Government had abolished, the passport system on the
frontier, and intended to withdraw the notice for abrogatin
the treaty as to armaments on the Lakes. He also sai
that we had been exquisitely civil in all our despatches, and
that the late PRINCE ConsóRT himself had suggested some
alterations in the Trent despatch, whereby it was rendered
still more polite than in the first draft. And though he
named nobody, he levelled a pretty straight hit at MR.
BRIGHT, for trying to make the Yankees believe that we
had treated them harshly. There was no question, he said,
between the Governments. SIR FREDERICK BRUCE, whose
wisdom hath approved itself in the East, has departed as
our representative in the West, vice LoRD Lyons.
If it be true—MR. Scully alleges it—that a child under
six and a man of sixty-five have been flogged in gaol, the
cases are not for words, but for such punishment of the
perpetrators as shall be remembered by all Justices and
Faolers for many a long day. But in spite of our abject
aith in the plenary and verbal inspiration of MR. Scully,
we are obliged to say that we must await further infor-
mation.
Those Saffron Hill Italian rioters give a great deal of
trouble. PELIzzIONI, the man who was convicted of
murder, and has been pardoned, because the act was not
murder, and also seems to have been committed by some-
body else, is now to be tried for wounding a potman called
REBBEck. The police are charged with having resolved to
convict PELIzzioni, and with having suppressed all evi-
dence that did not tend to that result. It is certain that
when a policeman has made up his very luminous mind as
to a person's guilt, the official mode of getting up the case
is uncommonly satisfactory—so far as it goes; only, as
CHIEF BARON Pollock remarked at Lewes, the other
day, “the object of a criminal prosecution is not to º a
verdict, but to get at the facts.” This dictum, which no
doubt seemed most offensive and uncalled-for to the gentle-
men whose creed begins with “From information which I
received,” was elicited in a case in which the police caused
an amiable and most respectable lady, the widow of a
British officer, to be tried because a fire occurred in her
house, and they could not find out how it had arisen. With
such a prosecutor as MR. DENMAN, such a defender as
SERJEANT BALLANTINE, and such, a Judge as the CHIEF
§º Foº, an innocent iady in the dock was, of
course, as safe from any serious consequences of police stu
Fº as she could have been in her own drawing-room;
ut the pain, the anxiety, the public scene, and the heavy
expense occasioned to her, are by no means to be forgotten.
“More brain, more brain l’” as MR. GEORGE MEREDITH,
the poet, exlaimeth.
Debate on the fortification of Quebec, and repetition of
most things that had previously been said. MR. DISRAELI
did not believe that the normal state of America would be
the maintenance of armies like those of XERxes. Perhaps
not, yet we should not be surprised to hear a Yankee
declare that the Republic, like that monarch, would “whip
the ocean.” MR. BRIGHT complimented MR. DISRAELI on
unexpected diffidence. The House felt, like Englishmen,
that whether we could defend Canada or not, it was due to
the gallant and loyal Canadians to assure them that, we
meant to try, and the Quebec fortifications were voted by
275 to 40. The Larger BENTINck, who had moved an
ºn, walked out of the House “amid ironical
cheers.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then, we are sorry to say, there was a Parliamentary scene, and
Punch fears that he cannot compliment his friend the SPEAKER,
on having been as autocratic as a Speaker, should be. The question
was unimportant, but MR. DENIson should have been very important.
MANNERs SUTTON or SHAw LEFEVRE would have made short work
with HENNEssys and Ilygons. However, perhaps the right honourable
gentleman was not well (the weather was an excuse for anything), and
it was very late, and he may have been tired. But in future, please, he
must be a Despot. - - --- -
The Bill for abolishing the oaths which Dissenters do not like to take
on assuming municipal office was read a Third Time and passed, and will
be rejected by the House of Lords at an early date. Their Lordships
like to set the schismatics swearing. "
Friday, Quite right, LoRDs MALMESBURY and, SHAFTESBURY, if a
Magistrate sends a man to a lunatic asylum, on the certificate of one
doctor, when the law demands that of two, that Magistrate must give a
good reason why he should be retained in the Commission of the Peace,
and of illegal practices. The Docknall case must be fully understood.
A laughable Irish debate. . CHIEF JUSTICE MQNAGHAN, one of the
best and ablest of the Hibernian Judges, is accused of having got out of
temper with the Magistrates of the County Down, and in reply to
one of them,is said to have uttered an impatient execration. Now, as no:
body ever swears in Ireland, the pious nation is hideously shocked. Of
course, the alleged words (though, if they were used at all, were used
in a way which made them utter nonsense) were excessively indecorous
but MR. CoGAN stood up like a gentleman for an absent and honoure
ersonage, and demanded full information. There was a wrangle, but
IR Robert PEEL's love of fun for once was opportune, and somehow,
between jest and earnest, he squenched a demonstration dictated by
something like spite.
The Blue Book Grievance was ventilated. Any Member can get
almost *i; printed, at the expense of the country, and an awful
expense the House printing is, and some cheaper article than the Blue
Books might be used for wrapping up, butter. MR. EwART deserves
plaudit for raising the question, and also for introducing a quotation
which was yery, apt, and which was new to the House. We cite.it,
remising for the information of all our readers but one, that MR.
WART Was lººf the uses to which Parliamentary documents
are turned, and, for the information of MR. Cox, that piper means
pepper, and not, as he may imagine, a performer on the bag-pipes.

“The EMPERoR, during the day, received in private audience the Count de Moltke HourFELDI,
- to his Majesty, M. Dr. Bluh ME, charged to
remit the collar of the Order of the Elephant which the KING of DENMARK has conferred on the
Danish Minister, who had the honour of presentin

But perhaps the “collar of the Order of the Elephant,” which the PRINce
IMPERIAL of FRANCE has been presented with by the King of DENMARK, is not
ded as a badge or decoration such as an Asiatic potentate would bestow
- that the Royal donor
of that bauble intended it as a toy for the amusement of the little NAPOLEoN,
to be re

“A Substitute For GUNPowder.—A new gunpowder is said to

Brown Bess first came out;
o doubt
She made in the papers a rout,
But her bullet so lax is,
It won't keep the axis,
And terribly wabbles about.
The Minnié came, too—
Something new—
And made a tremendous ado.
Its grooving was spiral—
Some said it would fire all
Its bullets a mile—some said two.
We the Enfields' attention engage—
The rage
We became, and just suited the age:
The Commons, the Peers,
The troops, volunteers,
LoRD ELcho, and CAPTAIN Hood PAGE.
But, alas ! the times change—
Our range
Is too short now the foe to derange;
And so WHITwoFTH's grooving
(With Richards' improving
The breach) has come in as a change.
Never mind! out of date,
We wait
To be shelved, not too early or late.
When they’re bringing a mess in
Of potash and resin
As powder, who'd mourn such a fate?
And then there's a change in the lead–
'Tis said
They’re making some hard stuff instead—
So good-bye. This will last
Till the fashion is past,
And something else comes in the head.

FROM EVALINA's LETTER TO HER COUSIN.
“I quite agree with you, DEAR, that The Wignette is far
parrettable to the CARTE Dr. Visite, FoR ANY Gial, who has PRE-
tensions to Good Looks. I Enclose MINE.” *
INTERESTING PICTURE SALE.
icture auctions of the season few have excited
more interest than has been occasioned by the dispersion, under the
accomplished hammer of MessRs. CHAFFER AND DUFFER, of the in-
teresting collection of works of art lately belonging to MR.PLUffy
Plummer, Poulterer and Grocer, at Wapping, and of which he has
generously divested himself, through the agency of the Court of Bank-
ruptcy, for the benefit of various residents in that district, to whom he
considers himself largely indebted in the way of gratitude and otherwise.
The sale took place on the premises, on Tuesday last, and was largely
attended by the eminent connoisseurs and dealers of Wººf We have
space to note only a few of the lots, and the prices they fetched.
Lot 27. Piew of the Great Exhibition ºf 1851, on wood, from the lid of a
workbox. 3d. Lot29. A Palentine, richly coloured, and opening to
disclose Hymeneal rites, mounted on spelling-book cover. 8d. A gem.
Lot 30. Interior Piew ºf the Thames Tunnel, }º to be lighted by
a candle. Slightly damaged. 2d., Lot 31. The Lord Mayor's Show, a
very long and elaborate work, faithfully representing the superb civic
festival; with portraits. After severe competition, this valuable his-
torical work was knocked down at 4d. Lot 35. Cremorne Gardens, with
balloon ascent, elegantly mounted on varnished card, but slightly fly-
blown, it is presumed from exposure in the window of a hostelrie. A
superb and conscientious work. 6d. Lot 39. Wapping Old Stairs, with
copy of Dibdin's beautiful poem, º printed by CATNACH. The
local interest of this picture produced a struggle for it, and it ultimately
went at 8d., amid loud cheers for the spirited purchaser. Lot 40
The Licensed Pictuallers' Fête, a grand composition, including at least
one hundred figures, likenesses of the most eminent publicans and pub-
licanesses. This important master-piece had been cleaned, somewhat
hastily, and the º; had unfortunately removed the back.
ground, the legs, and several of the faces, but enough remained to win-
dicate the genius of the artist, and the work, with black frame, formerly
gilt, went for 1s. 6d. The sun suddenly shone into the room at the
moment the auctioneer held up the picture, and caused a sensation-
some persons being affected to sneezing. Lot 43. Portrait ºf the late
Mrs. Liston, as Paul Pry, in the celebrated comedy of that name; a
fine lithograph. There was competition for this, and it was whispered
that emissaries from the Garrick Club and the National Portrait Gallery
were contending, but it was finally secured by a resident for 7d.
Among the numerous
a chef-d'oeuvre, and also deeply interesting as a * of Teutonic Art. 10d.
Lot 46. Piete & King's Cross, before the demolition of the Statue of
His Majesty George Tue. Fourth. This work, of the CANALETTI
order, had been damaged (like LEONARD0 DAVINci's master-piece) by
having been made a target, but the anctioneer ingeniously suggested
that the arrowholes could be stopped with a little black putty, which
he offered to supply at the expense of the estate. The bidding was,
however, languid, and the work was bought in, Lot 50. The Erecution
ºf Thurtell. This fine historical picture, with book of the trial, was felt
to be rather a gallery work than one calculated for a private domestic
collection, but its conscientiousness and º: power asserted them-
selves, and it was secured for 8d. by a local member of the Society for
the Abolition of Capital Punishment. Lot 57. “Who is King?” . A
gorgeously-coloured work, representing a Twelfth Night festival, with
elegantly-attired, ladies and gentlemen ſº intensely at a gigantic
cake, but gaily holding up glasses of Port wine negus, elicited much
applause, and was knocked down at 6d. The fortunate purchaser
found, inside, several charming little character-pictures, with quaint
iegends, and a dispute arose as to whether they had become his pro-
perty. The carelessness of auctioneers, in not thoroughly examining
every article they catalogue, deserves the severest reprehension. In
this case the purchaser expressed such unqualified defiance of the
vendor's suggestions for a re-sale, and intimated so, distinctly that if
they were persevered in, the knocking down would not be all performed
by the auctioneer, that it was considered best, to let the sale proceed,
with notice that the Lond CHANCELLOR would be * to. Lot 60.
The Pavilion at Brighton...This marvellous proof of the utility of Art
as a handmaid to civilisation, was a triptych, which opened, and dis-
closed a nutmeg grater, a paper for "kindling lucifer matches, and an
almanac for 1839. It was eagerly contested for, and went for 1s. 2d.
Lot 64. Replica, signed, of black paper cut portrait of a Beadle, name
unknown, but the work executed, as the date showed, in the latter part
of the mayoralty of Lond WAITH MAN. 4d. Lot 70. “Something Slap.”
A most animated picture of a dandy of 1820 driving a female with a
vast bonnet, in a lofty gig, horse about twenty-seven hands high, and
violent action. This was the sensation sale of the day, and the work
was at last knocked down, to a sporting publican, at 2s. 8d., but the
regularity of the transaction being objected to by a broker who had
also bid highly, the opinion of the assembly was taken, and at their
unanimous suggestion a ring was formed, and a desperate battle ensued,
which ended in the broker's victory, and the clearing of the room by
the intelligent and obliging Policeman Z 218. The proceeds of the
day's sale amounted to £3 lls. 6d. ; and as this has to be distributed by
the Court of Bankruptcy, it is calculated that about 7s.6d. will be
divided among the creditors,

also made a mere matter of a rope, we should soon have the requisite

Elizabeth ! to-morrow I am going out hunting (on horseback!)
with the “Harriers” (whatever they may be '). What fiends, cham-
agne-begotten, tempted me to-night to say that I could ride! ...A
#. of our friend's here, after inner, seriously and in good faith
offered to “mount” me. A stout man, six foot four, and weighing
nearly 20 stone! and I cannot but think that the horse he is going to
lend me, and whose name is Goliath, must be in proportion. Oh,
BETTY think of me on the top of such a monster! me, whom you can
carry up-stairs in your arms! Would they were round me now! And
I hear there are precipitous hills, and dales, and possible jumps; and
the “meet” (that is, the ºf: the hounds and hunters) is to be
at a place called “The Devil's DYKE!”
When you receive this (or, haply, if you receive it, for it shall only
be sent in case of fatal necessity), remember that my last thought in
falling off Goliath was for you and the unconscious twins, now father-
less! I can write no more, for I must sew some buttons on my trou-
sers for straps.
Farewell, dearest Tell my mother-in-law I forgave the past. (Oh,
! | were with her —she’s safer than Goliath.") Farewell! Fare-
Well .
(We are happy to say the above was not sent.)
From the Same to the Same.
MY DEAREst BETTY, Brighton, Saturday Night.
I HAVE had the most glorious day I can remember. I’ve
been out hunting-on horseback, of course.
Yesterday, at dinner here, I met a MR. Jones, and a very jolly fellow
he is! We got talking of sporting matters, and on my happening to
say I was fond of riding, he offered to mount, me. Let me alone for
accepting his offer' And we’ve been out all day, and had some splen-
did sport. I don't suppose you are } much versed in these matters,
Betty dear, and it will interest you to hear all about it.
We started, at ten, from MR. Jones's door, the groom havin
brought round the horses. MR. Jones is a much larger man than 1,
and Goliath, the horse I was to ride was immense—I heard something
about sixteen feet and a half high, if I am not mistaken. It seems a
fº deal, but I suppose he’s about that when he stands ºn his hind
egs (which he didn't do with me, thank goodness!). The stirrup-
leathers were shortened to their utmost, and when I found myself
across his back, I could just touch the stirrups with the tips of my
toes. MR. Jones seemed to think them short enough, and I didn't
contradict him, although I had my own private feelings on the matter.
I found, moreover, that I could make a very presentable appearance on
the side next to MR. Jones, by sacrificing the other stirrup altogether,
which is easy enqugh, when walking; when galloping, or especially
trºtting, I’ve no doubt he was too much occupied in keeping on him.
self to notice me (if I can judge of him by my own experience).
Well, we arrived at the “meet,” at a very pretty place called “The
in a line, and we followed. I chose a beautiful young green field for
my first gallop, and found it easy enough; and altogether the beautiful
Iresh air, the manly excitement, the musical notes of the hounds, and
the men all crying out “wareweet! wareweet!” at the tops of their
voices, have left an impression never to be effaced.
I had hitherto felt rather nervous, but now all fear was banished.
All of a sudden I saw the hare scamper up hill, and in a little while the
hounds went after him. I galloped-Jones galloped—we all of us †
loped; and anything easier or more inspiriting than galloping up hill
I can’t conceive. But, by Jove, going down the other side, BETTY,
even at a walk!—and I ºlor ! fortunately behind the rest; for
though I managed to stic
on, I am afraid I did not do
soin quite the usual manner.
After a series of these gal-
lops up and down, there was
a pause. I observed the
huntsman get off his horse
among the hounds, who were
all in a heap at his feet, and
ick up the poor hare, who
}. done something called
“doubling,” which had
proved fatal to her, for she
thereby met her doom. * * *
I felt very faint, and would
gladly have given my day's
sport for the poor thing to
have effected its escape. ..
In the middle of my dis-
tress a very gentlemanly-
looking man, rode, up, an
asked me to “cap” him, and
not knowing how to do it. I
was very much put out. For-
tunately, an elderly gentle-
man saw my embarrassment;
and told me that “capping’
was giving half-a-crown
which I did, although I ha
great difficulty in getting at
it, for my fingers were be-
numbed, and already taken
ºil. two bridles and a -
whip. I wouldn't have dropped that whip, with nobody, but myself
to get off my horse and pick it up; no, not for all the hares in
England!
Here MR. Jones gave me a pull at his sherry flask and a biscuit, and
then we set out after another ſhare: more up and down hi de-
all
lightful galloping along occasionally level plains; on one of these was

a sheep-fold, with a wooden railing near it, a very desperate leap, in
fact; the huntsman who rode in front of me jumped over, and a sudden
inspiration prompted me to
follow. I held my breath
and went at it; in going
over all my past existence
revealed itself to me as in a
single flash, and when we
got on the other side, I
found I was still following
the huntsman, and still on
Goliath. I will own to you,
BETTY, that I was as much
surprised as if your Mother
had sent me a fifty-pound
note for my birthday. 'I
patted the faithful Goliath's
neck, and vowed that hunt-
ing and leaping should
henceforward be my only
relaxation. Why did my
Mother, in her too careful
solicitude, bring me up in
ignorance of this exciting,
aring amusement.
Well this hare was caught
(without doubling) and 1
was in at the death; had I
chosen I could have ridden
before any one else, or in-
deed in advance of the
hounds themselves, but MR. Jones prevented me. I asked him if I
might not have the brush to send to you, Betty; but he explained to
me that hares have not got one, and I now recollect he was right. .
He now proposed that we should return to Brighton, and as I fancied
I was feeling rather sore, I acceded, though with regret., The ride
home was not by any means so pleasant as everything else had been;
Goliati adopted for the return a kind of jog-trot which was very dis-

tressing. I seemed to grow less and less, and he to become quite
camel-like; indeed I was conscious of very ungrateful feelings towards
Goliath, which increased in intensity until we reached the stables and
dismounted; that is Mr. Jones dismounted first, and then dismounted
me; for, dear Betty, I was utterly incapable of lifting my leg across
the saddle, and when I alighted, upheld by MR. Jones's hand on my
collar, (he is a very strongman), I felt as if I was only resting on the
und by means of a pair of empty trousers, which would have yielded
ad they not been coated with dried mud.
This wore off, of course, and I was able to follow him into the house;
Didn't I eat a lunch, and didn't I eat a dinner after! I swore eternal
friendship to MR. Jones, and so far from feeling any fatigue I offered
to run a race with anybody, and here I am in my bed-room writing
to thee; and recollect, Betty, I hereby solemnly declare that in future
all my energies shall be devoted to keeping a hunter, and hunting him
(in boots); you shall hunt, your Mother shall hunt, the twins shall
learn to hunt before they learn to read. -
Good night, good night, beloved. I’m so sleepy, but not at all tired;
I must have a natural gift for field sports.
From the Same to the Same.
DEAREST WIFE, Brighton, Sunday.
- You must leave everything, and come immediately to the bed-
side of * possibly dying husband. My constitution is irrevocably
shattered. I am surrounded by people º laugh at my woes. The
very Doctor, whose mission is to heal the sick and assuage bodily
anguish, does not even preserve a decorous gravity when I detail my
*...'. Oh! none but you, Betty; no hand but yours can soothe
these fearful sufferings. I cannot move a limb without tortures. I am
doubled in two, Betty; my poor legs are worn away to the bone, Oh
never, never more shall leg of mine bestraddle the back of a brutal
horse. May they both fall off 'ere I again participate in such barbarous
sport as yesterday's. I am expiating the fate of the hare who doubled.
She is out of her misery at least. -
Oh, BETTY, wife, helpmate! leave twins, Mother, everything, and
come ; your Mother even would compassionate me now. Come, oh
come, to your -
Wretched, penitent, and utterly excoriated,
HUSBAND.
THE BAKERS’ CLUB.
CLUBs for working men are becoming the fashion, and nobody wishes
them “God speed” more heartily than Punch. The Cabmen have
theirs; and even the Costermongers have theirs. We are not informed
whether they have insisted on the protection of the black-ball and the
ballot, which is found necessary to keep West-end clubs what they ought
to be. And now the journeymen Bakers have theirs. And why not ?
Surely those who make the staff of life have the best right to make a club.
There is no more over-worked, ill-cared for, and industrious body of
workmen in London than the * bakers, whose club, with
a daring defiance of the small wits, has just been opened in Rolls
Buildings, Fetter Lane. Perhaps the site was chosen with a double
reference to “breakfast bread” and the slavish toil and confinement
to which the journeymen bakers were condemned that London might
have its hot rolls regularly. Indeed, if the new Club wants arms we
cannot think of more appropriate ones than a Roll and a Fetter, im-
proper, charged saltire-wise. But the Bakers' Club, wants a liſt;
£250 would set it fairly on its legs. Let everybody who has been in the
habit of eating hot rolls for breakfast, and has thereby impaired his own
health, as well as that of the journeymen bakers, give a shilling, or
even a penny, to this good cause, and the trick is done. Such contri-
butions might more fairly be called “ conscience money,” than the
arrears of Income-Tax which one now sees so often paid under that
name to the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER.
GREAT FALL IN CRINOLINE.
MADeMoiselle HAUSMANN, the daughter of the potent Préfet de la
Seine, was married the other day “without a vestige of Crinoline.’
Does the daughter mean to assert her empire over steel and stiffening,
as the father asserts his over moellons and mortar; Mademoiselle defying
the dress-makers as Monsieur defies the dwellers in Paris? If so,
we must regard this daring act as simply a symbolic expression of the
pride of the HAUSMANNs, which sets its heel even on fashion, as the
German Emperor trampled PRiscIAN underfoot with “Ego sum Imperator
Romanus, et sum super grammaticam.” Or does MADEMOISELLE
HAUSMANN mean to imply that her Crinoline is out of place now she has
been transformed from a Hausmann into a “Hausfrau,” or “House-
wife” in plain English P

following:—
“Except in the poorer numbers of Punch, and similar periodicals, it would not

Now, we wish to remind our young friend that there is no “similar
periodical” to Punch, and that though one number of the Pall Mall
Gazette, may very properly be described as poorer than another, the
proper form even for depreciative comparison for Punch, is not “poor,
poorer, poorest,” but “rich, less rich, least rich.” -
While we have our young friend in hand, as he is evidently proud of
his Latin, his University training, his typography and getting up, and
all that concerns himself generally, we may as well remind him that

own style, we should say:—
“It is rather cool of the Pall Mall Gazette to call this halting hobble an amended
version of even M. Pons ARD's lame epigram, “Mortuus est vivus, narratur CASARE
CAESAR.”
Of course, the Pall Mall Gazette is suffering under a printer's error,
and the line should run—
“Wivus defuncto narrat de CAEsARE CAEsAR.
Having corrected the press for our young friend, how would he like
it if we were to ask, in his own style, “How is this? Cannot the
Pall Mall Gazette afford a “Reader?' Or is it possible that the Reader
of a periodical apparently intended for tolerably educated people can

THE MUSIC HALL QUESTION.
(Before a very Select Committee.)
It being certain that the important lº of Dramatic. Licences
will at no very distant time occupy the attention of Parliament, a
Select, Committee was , the other evening deputed to visit, the
Alhambra, in order to make themselves personally acquainted with the
merits of the representative case with which they would have to deal.
Having previously dined with LoRD Sydney at a restaurant in the
neighbourhood, MR. Locke in the Vice-Chair, the Committee were
conducted º Mr. W. Bopham. DoNNE, wearing his Orders for the
Play, to the Moorish palace of amusement. -
On the following day, the members, in a body, waited upon the LORD
CHANCELLOR, who, according to previous ...; spent, a con-
siderable time in examining them, and in taking down such evidence as
their careful individual observation had enabled them to give. ..
. The LoRD CHANCELLoR explained to them, that the question was,
whether the Ballet, that the Committee had witnessed, was a Dramatic
fntertainment within the Act. Either it was, or it was not. It would
be highly advantageous, to the interests of the community generally, to
note i. their particular impressions of this class of amusement, while
yet fresh, in what were . courtesy termed, their minds. . He
would call upon the FIRST Lord of THE TREASURY, and would ask
him what meaning, if any, did the Ballet at the Alhambra convey to
his mind P
LoRD PALMeRSTON, rising amid dense cheering from MR. BRAND,
which was immediately suppressed by the LoRD CHANCELLOR, said, that
the notion conveyed to his mind was that of a race-course.
The LORD CHANCELLOR inquired what his Lordship meant.
LoRD PALMERston explained, that the idea of a race-course had been
forcibly brought before him by the Ballet, because he did not recollect
ever having seen, in one place, such an assemblage of “Legs.”
Here MR. BRAND, having borrowed the Hon. Evelyn AshLEY’s
pocket-handkerchief, wherewith to stifle his emotion, was led out of the
room by the latter gentleman.
MR. Cox tried to explain, the joke to MR. VINCENT SCULLY, who
had just begun to grasp it, when
EARL Russell said that he didn't recollect any particular notion
being conveyed to his mind by the dancing. If pressed, he must own
that he wasn't attending § closely to it, as he was engaged in writing
letters to the Maitre de Ballet.
The LORD CHANCELLOR wished to know if his Lordship's impressions
were conveyed in these notes ?
EARL Russell, wished to say that he had only written these letters
i.. capacity of Foreign Secretary. He was rather fond of writing
etters.
MR. GLADSTONE said he would divide it into three heads— .
... The Loºp CHANCELLOR observed that it would be more convenient
if he would confine it to one—his own. What impression did the
Ballet convey to the º Honourable Gentleman's mind?
..MR., GLADSTONE, said that Ballet º Budget. Both began
with, B. He couldn't help thinking of his own Novelty for Easter,
While at the Alhambra, he was engaged in considering what he could
The LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER had invented a new tax upon his (LORD WESTBURY's)
time and patience. He might stand down.
. SIR GEORGE GREY said, that while witnessing the spectacle in ques-
tion, the idea had occurred to him, that, if the Police were dressed in a
similar costume, it would be very cold for them in winter.
MR. VINGENT Scully said that the Ballet-girls held up 6. leaves.
It reminded him or the Wrongs of Ireland. The LoRD ChancELLOR
would, he hoped, excuse these tears.
The LORD CHANCELLOR observed, that there was a certain class of
people for whom one must º make allowances.
R. Lawson, on being asked his opinion, said that he thought the
Ballet, generally speaking, “Permissive.” He didn't know what he
meant, but he certainly thought it was “permissive.” . He would go
into a few statistics. If there were 100 Ballet-girls, it is probable that
each dancer consumed two or more glasses of wine, spirit, or malt
liquor during the evening...This gave an average consumption of at
least 200 glasses of some º or another. Now, supposing an in-
creased ratio—(the witness here pulled out a bundle ºf papers, and a
ready-reckoner)—
The Lord, CHANCELLOR said, that, without any wish to extol or dis-
parage the dancing ladies, this was not a question of #. As the
present inquiry was, moreover, not a mere matter of form, he must
remind the Honourable Member for Carlisle of the nature of their
business. He could account for MR, LAwson's anxiety to give them
his calculations in matters of wine, spirits, and malt liquor.
MR. I.AWSON, apologising for the interruption, said he believed the
Dancers represented Water Nymphs,
The LORP CHANCELLOR said that if it was anything to do with
water, the Honourable Gentleman would be quite out of his element.
MR. BERKELEY said that the Ballet reminded him of the Ballot.
(The Witness was immediately removed, and placed, by order {
the Fº CHANCELLOR, under the care of a §cºld Schoo
master.
SIR }. B. LYTTON read out from a paper something about the Real
smiling on the Ideal, while the Agile blended with the Voluptuous.
MR. WHALLEY said, that he only saw in the Ballet of the Alhambra,
one of the many deliberate attempts, on the part of the Romish
Hierarchy, for introducing Papistical practices into this country. Did
the LoRD CHANCELLOR know that at this moment there were two
hundred Nuns, in the disguise of Ballet-girls, employed by the Jesuits
to exercise their proselytising arts among the guileless young men of
this Protestant community? Did the Lord ChanceLlor know—
The LORD CHANCELLOR observed that he didn't know, and didn't
care.
MR. NewDEGATE said that he hadn't visited the place himself, per-
#. he could speak with greater certainty about it for that very reason.
It had certainly struck him in the same light as it had MR. WHALLEY-
perhaps more so. He must be pardoned if he didn't express himself
very clearly, in consequence of his .# last week had a “go in " at
some Bishop that was rather too strong for him. He hadn't been well
ever Since.
MR. CowPER here entered, and proposed an adjournment to Leicester
Square, where they would see the celebrated One-Legged Statue that
had been engaged by MR. Gye to appear at Covent Garden in Don
Giovanni during the ensuing season.
The meeting adjourned accordingly.
REMANDED TO NEWGATE.
“ALDERMAN Stone moved, and ALDERMAN SALoxtons seconded, an inquiry into
the system of treating prisoners under remand in Newgate."
My Aldermen, my Aldermen, you’re constantly in grief—
One day you É. crusading against La Plata beef,
Declare that for the food of man it is too hard and lean,
And when fat—proh pudor /–sentence it, because the fat is green
And now you run your addle-pates right against Newgate wall,
Though e'en the very Stones arise, and 'gainst the system call,
And though SALOMONs' (mild) wisdom cries “ditto” unto Stone,
Bumbledom's sins your noodledom's contented to condone.
You give your turnkeys power to deal with prisoners on remand,
As they'd treat, after conviction, your “regular old hand,”
Making them clean their prison-cells, and eat the prison fare,
And insisting upon cutting their meat, if not their hair.
Just think, my stupid Aldermen, were one of you remanded–
The human mind can picture such a thing, yet not be stranded,
..ºf the awful heights temptation runs its rig to,
And what lengths Respectability will sometimes drive its gig to—
Should one of you, in evil day, so far in life miscarry
As to come inside your own stone-jug, as now the Messrs. BARRY,
How would you like, before trial and sentence, in such plight to be,
As I’ve no doubt after sentence you would own you’d every right to be.
Do condescend to common sense and justice now and then,
And remember that, though Aldermen, you’re at the same time men;
And that what is sauce for Geese |. EssRs. BARRY, in disgrace),
Would be also sauce for Ganders, like yourselves, if in like case.
A NOT MUTE IF INGLORIOUS MILTON.
A, SACRED Epic was published in the year 1667. We used to read
the literary papers of the day, and we do not remember perusing any-
thing of this kind :—
NEW SACRED EPIC.
A R A D IS E L O ST. A POEM, in Ten Books. Highly
spoken of in one hundred Reviews and Literary Notices. For forty extremely
laudatory opinions of the press, see pages 283 and 284 of the Athenaeum, Feb. 25.
Cheap Edition, 3s.6d. ; gilt edges, 5s.
Large Edition, gilt edges, &c. 7s.6d. ; extra morocco, 15s.
London: SAMUEL SIMMons, Bookseller.
Still, the Poem made a certain success, and may even now, nearly
two hundred years later, be found in a few English houses. , But how
much better it would have been had MR. J. Milton caused his pub-
lisher, MR. S. SIMMONs, to have issued such a notice as the above,
which we do see in the literary journals of the day, as an announcement
of a “New Sacred Epic.”. That is the way for poets to address the
public. “O brave poets,” if you would only be brave enough for this
sort of thing, you would soon be “made.” What a pity Milton and
SIMMONs lived in times when advertising was not understood.

TIIE STAGE FROM THE FRONT.
We have seen comedies in three acts, tragedies in three acts, and
dramas and operas in three acts, but we never saw a joke in three acts
until we went to the Haymarket Theatre the other night to witness the
Woman in Mauve. MR. WATTs Phillips, the author of this ponderous
piece of pleasantry—this well-meaning, but wer unsatisfactory and
somewhat vulgar attempt to ridicule sensational literature—has either
not completely grasped his subject, or has played fast and loose with his
mission as a reformer in order to Fº the groundlings. The Woman
in Mauve is a broad and improbable farce of the old Surrey type,
tacked on to a burlesque in plain clothes, which is little more than a
feeble copy of MR. ToMTAYLOR's Sense and Sensation. All the science
and mechanical tricks of the so-called “sensation drama” are carefully
used to increase the effect of the piece, though “sensation” writers,
like MR. Wilkie Collins, Miss BRADDON, and others, are attacked
in the dialogue. The limeſlight is laid on with the utmost liberality.
At the close of the drama on the first night, MR. Buckstone made a
speech, in which he said that the few hisses which had greeted the piece
were the work of an organised clique, who were acting from private
motives. MR. Buckston E was correct. No one hisses any actor or
any piece in these º: for purely critical reasons. MR. Buckstone
might have gone further, and have denied the right of the public to
hiss under any circumstances. There is hardly a Pºliſ which may
not be lost if not used for a certain period, and a public which has
not hissed for twenty years, deserves to have its right of hissing
questioned.
The real Irish drama has again “taken the floor” against all comers,
and “Arrah na Pogue,” or “Arrah na Brogue,”—we hardly know
which to call it—is now the º: entertainment at the Princess's.
Justice has been done to Ireland by importing native actors and super-
numeraries to work the play, and play the work, and the author
has done justice to himself by writing an original, humorous, pathetic,
and well-constructed drama. }. scenery, the stage management, and the
acting—the latter with one or two exceptions—are admirable. There is a

Spirits for the Army.
In the Committee of Supply on the Army Estimates,
a vote of a considerable sum was taken for the Disem-
bodied Militia. Recruits for this branch of the Service
may perhaps be obtained by application at the Office,
iº Basinghall Street, E.C., of the “Spirit-Power
nstitute.”
Much
brogue upon the stage which is like the whiskey got upon an emergency
from the public-house round the corner, you can never tell whether it
is Scotch or Irish. Such a brogue is not heard at the Princess's. The
marimum of good dialogue, good situations, and good characters is
given with the minimum of “sensation,” but still there is a “sensation.”
The author climbs a loſty prison wall in a way which is either sugges-
tive of the tread-mill or the ascent of Mount Parnassus. The last
scene—a lovely expanse of rock, and bay, which is most artistically
painted by M.R. Lloyds, is called “The Keep ! The Ivy Wall ! The
Watch Tower!” As this hardly explains the locality, we beg, out of
respect to the scene-shifters and machinists, to call it The Gulf of Car-

MR. John STUART MILL, in reply to an invitation to stand for
Westminster, addressed to him, on the part of a committee of electors
of that borough, by MR. JAMEs Beal, has written a letter, which, if
Mr. Punch had not done something of the same sort before, might be
regarded as a perfectly unique model of the proper answer to such a
request. , MR, MILL acknowledges the honour done him by his fellow-
subjects in asking him to represent them, consents to undertake, as a
duty, the onerous task which they desire him to perform, if they
persist in desiring him, points out the circumstances, which perhaps
might be considered to disqualify him for the office, tells them that he
can spend no money to get returned, and will not even canvass the
constituents. Finally, MR. MILL indicates the persons whom he
conceives to be fitter to represent Westminster than himself. The
manly seriousness of his conditional acceptance of the proposal to
allow himself to be Fº in nomination, stands in fine contrast with the
cringing cajolery of those abject supplications which the majority of
men who aspire to become Members of Parliament usually address to
the “free and independent electors.” MR. MILL has answered the
solicitation to represent Westminster just as Mr. Punch would have
answered an entreaty to represent London. Only Mr. Punch could
not have named anybody so fit to do that as himself.

A PROFESSIONAL OPINION.
Mamma. “I AM QUITE AFRAID of youn going out on THAT MARE, CLARA, DEAR."
Uncle Charles (goes about as straight as the Crow flies). “ONLY FRESH ! JUST LET THEM GET on To A Good SchNT, AND we'll soon
TAKE IT OUT of HER."
A CATALOGUE OF SINGERS.
(Being an Operatic echo of the Catalogue of Ships.)
SING, O Muse!, and rehearse the names of the Opera Singers,
Singers engaged by GYE many-counselled, wary, and prudent,
Gye, of Costa the friend, the tamer of wild primadonnas:
Sing, in hexameter verse, the verse adopted by Hoxſert.
First in the list stands PATTI, the hright-faced, clear-throated PATTI,
Patti the charmer of men and pet of the Gods (in the Gall'ry);
She as Amina will sing, as Adina, Norina, Zerlina ;
She in the Magic Flute will assume the part of Pamina,
All these names bearing rhyme to her own º name Adelina.
Next shall we have the good luck of hearing the delicate LuccA:
Sudden she ſlitted last year, being ill-many doubted the reason,
Hinting she left in a huff: but who’d doubt the word of a lady ?
She Valentina will play, and the principal part in L'Africaine,
Latest of MEYERBEER’s works, which critics long have expected.
Who cometh third on the list P 'Tis the homey-tongued Miolan-
CARWALHo:
She as the Star of the North will shine, the fair Caterina,
And will make love and go mad, the victim of Faust and Mephisto.
All these three have we heard: but a name that is new is GALLETTI;
Covered with laurels she comes, and as Norma will make her début
here,
Norma by Pollio loved, and deserted for Adelgisa.
Six fair maids are engaged, whose names are new to us also:
From Munich D'EDELSBERG, to play Fides in Le Prophète,
From Berlin D'AHNA, to sing the contralto song Il Segreto,
From Milan BERINI will come, from Moscow the maiden HoNoFE,
From Lisbon BIANCHI the fair, from Italy fair SoNIERI;
These are new singers all, and doubtless are pleasant to look at :
These great Punch will adore, if their looks be as sweet as their
Voices.
Sing we now of the men: 'mong whom stands MARIO foremost,
Sweetest of tenors is he, and, whenever he singelh, the great Punch
Sucks in his honeyed tones, as the bluebottle flies do the treacle !
WACHTEL too will appear, the far-famed shouter of high notes,
Splitter of ears in the stails, but charmer of Gods (in the Gall'ry):
They, being farther away, can enjoy a robustious bawler.
TAscA from Naples will come, and from Milan famed SAccom ANNo:
Known for a tenor the one, and the other a baritone singer,
SchMID the ... will appear, and CLAMPI the humorous buffo,
RoNCONI more humorous still, for far less forced is his humour,
TAGLIAFIco the tall, and the tenor-tongued NERI-BARALDI;
Polon[NI, FALLA, GRAZIANI, GAssir R, ATTRI-
Names with no epithet joined, that all in a line we may lump them.
These will Costa command, the tamer of wild primadonnas:
Costa, whose well-trained band obeyeth each beat of his ºfton
Like as the general world obeyeth the voice of the great Punch.
Musical Notes and Queries
THE Monday Popular Concerts have become so vastly ºl. that
extra Monday Concerts are now given on a Saturday. Perhaps on the
same principle there will be, next year, an extra Shrove Tuesday or two,
which, to please the pancake lovers, will be holden on a Fry-day.
A new singer, Sigson FALLA, is announced at Covent Garden. What
a chance for all the Swells to try and make a little joke about his being
a charming “falla!” Who knows but SIGNOR FAI-LA may be fol-
lowed by SIGNOR ToI.DEROL or SIGNOR RUMTI IDDITY..?
INTERNATIONAL POUNDING.
It is calculated that a shot which will do any good against—that is
to say, * harm to—an iron-clad, must cost about twenty pounds.
This fact should occasion a change in the nomenclature of gunnery, sº
that when a shot is called a twenty-pounder, that denomination shali
be taken to mean twenty pounds sterling.

O MR. NewDEGATE has drawn
down upon himself the ven-
geance of all the Saints that
are patronised by some of the
first among the Nobility and
Gentry—S. ALPHONsus Li-
GUORI and the rest. He has
received fresh punishment for
the iº. of asking
for a Parliamentary inquiry
on the subject of Convents.

2:22. convent. . So Bishop ULLA-
A3:23: \; Tºº tried to beat him
1333 into submitting it to the test
\º
º A of private investigation. MR.

making him produce, before
a competent tribunal, that
same evidence, which he had
offered to lay before a Com:
mittee of the House of

º,
sº
- Commons.
How unfair of MR. NewDegate to decline the invitation of Bishop ULLA-
ThoRNE and MR. LANGDALE to inspect nunneries, and allow, his charges respecting
monastic establishments to be tried on those gentlemen’s own terms
How
unreasonable this conduct is, how justly it merits the scoffs of all those exquisite
gentlemen, who, because they know Roman Catholics that are good fellows, are
therefore judiciously ready to deride, with the view of cushioning, any proposal for
COLENSO THE BRAWE.
BY OUR OWN MONK LEWIS.
A Bishop so wise and a Native so tame
Conversed in an African mead
CoLENso the Brave was the Suffragan's name,
But the pensive Zulu's is not given to fame,
And they talked upon questions of Creed.
“O hush those suspicions,” the Suffragan said,
“Offensive to Church and to me,”
But something the Native put into his head
He mused on at board, and he mused on in bed,
And he talked of the same in his See.
Then over to England the ..f. flew,
And published some tomes full of lore,
Which brought on his Lordship each savage Review,
legislation, and, even for inquiry, based on the supposition
that their creed, like any other, can possibly co-exist with
official misconduct -
Not to consent, to inspect convents and submit the
evidence º: them to scrutiny on the conditions pro-
posed by Bishop ULLAThorne and MR. LANGDALE, is to
treat that prelate and that gentleman as sceptical philo-
sophers treat the DAVENPort Brothers. It is not only
ungentlemanly, but it is also old-womanly. -
as MR. NewDEGATE any reason to apprehend being
met with anything but the most ingenuous openness on the
#. of Roman Catholic and conventual authorities? Does
any the least ground for suspecting that anything ever can
go on within, the walls of convents which, like, the
operations inside of the DAVENPORTs’ structure, would not
bear the light?
Qf course MR. NewpegATE grossly insults the sisters
of Roman Catholic gentlemen by imagining that religious
enthusiasm could possibly subjugate their minds. But the
sting of the insult which he offers to gentlemen, his fellow-
subjects, by proposing that Parliament shall entertain, a
question which presumes monastic institutions to be
capable of abuse, does not lie mainly in the imputation cast
on their sisters. It lies rather in i. assumption that the
faith which they revere does not exempt from requiring to
be looked after, like other people, its ecclesiastics, who rule
their consciences, and by whom some of them can as
tenderly be led by the nose as asses are.
A Barrister and a Brother.
It will be recollected that, a short time ago, a gentleman
of colour was admitted to the American Bar. His pro-
fessional brethren, however, will not tolerate his presence
in their company at the White House. For the rece
tion of the darker class of American citizens, there should
also be t, Black House at Washington.
A BCNNET without a face is like the grand-stand without
a race,
He owes no allegiance to LoNGLEY or you :
Behold me, and know what I tell you is true!”
Then a Chancellor's face was disclosed.
The sentence was final, and left not a doubt,
His smile of derision they saw :
The lawyers ran in and the lawyers ran out,
They hooted and mooted the Temple about,
But no one could challenge the law.
And while all the Bishops look awfully grave,
Dancing round them Dissenters are seen,
Their liquor's Cape-port, and as horrid a stave
They chant, “To the health of ColeNso the Brave,
And his Convert, the Native so clean l’”
A BULL ON THE LINE |
Some called him a sceptic, some called him untrue,
Some said he’d been answered before.
A dreadful sensation, too dreadful to tell,
To the bench of the Bishops he gave, .
As when MR. WHITwo RTH explodes a big shell,
But they rallied, and all in a body they fºll
To demolish Colºnso the Brave.
From the Cape, demon-haunted, a spectre arose,
It was clad in a mantle of Gray,
And it stalked to ColeNso, and said, “I depose
A priest who can propagate volumes like those !”
ut a stern Apparition cried, “Nay!”
In a voice full of sweetness, but cold as a stone,

“You are phantoms alike—if you want flesh and bone
Go pray Three Estates; for a Monarch, alone,
Is nought to the Church but a Head.

leges, they ought not to object to exceptional obligations.”

IL YA CESAR ET CÉSAR.
WHEN Rome's first CAESAR, conquest flushed, from Gaul,
Deep-pondering marched o'er the Cisalpine plain,
He whom no stream of slaughter could appal,
Upon the banks of Rubicon drew rein.
Passing that streamlet which athwart his road
Twixt Gaul and Italy as frontier ran
He felt that o'er the barrier-line he strode
Where servant ended, and where chief began.
Our new French CAESAR, bound on like emprise
By other arts, came, where there flowed along,
The Rubicon which severs truth from lies,
Sworn faith from perjury, and right from wrong.
JULIUs had stopt: but Louis, calm and cold,
Nor paused, nor pondered, nor e'er bridle drew,
But reckless how those bitter waters rolled,
Dashed boldly in, and, dirt-stained, waded through.
Quiddities.
For the Old Ladies.—A Tea-party without scandal is like a knife
without a handle.
Words without deeds are like the husks without the seeds.
Features without grace are like a clock without a face.
A Land without the laws is like a cat without her claws.
Life without cheer is like a cellar without beer.
A Master without a cane is like a rider without the rein.
Marriage without means is like a horse without his beans.
A Man without a wife is like a fork, without a knife.
A Quarrel without fighting is like thunder without lightning.
THE EMPIRE OF LETTERS.
HENRY THE EIGHTH, it was remarked, wrote with his sceptre;
NAPQLEoN THE THIRD, it may be said, writes with a bayonet. When
his Julius Caesar was given to the world, it was graciously announced
that writers were “at liberty” to criticise the work; indeed, official
organs stated that critics were “invited” to say frankly what they
thought of it. Among others, M. Rogeard incautiously accepted the
imperial invitation. #. freely spoke his mind about the startling feat
of authorship the EMPEROR had performed, and he has been sentenced
to five years' imprisonment for doing so. This is the French notion of
the freedom of the Press. A writer is “invited” to criticise a book,
and upon accepting, he gets shown into a prison, and, is officially pre-
sented with a pair of handcuffs. To represent ht the Liberty of the
Press, costumed a la mode Française, she should be habited in prison
garb, with shackles on her limbs, and at her side should stand a huge
gens-d'arme, with a drawn sword or bayonet pointed at, her breast,
while a picture of Cayenne should be prominent in front of her.
Election Intelligence.
THE Hon. CAPTAIN GRosvenoR has been addressing the Westminster
Electors in the Temperance Hall, and it is said that, thirsting for a little
applause, he is going to invite their wives and daughters to the same
place, to partake of the cup that cheers, but not ineburyates.” . With
a Robleman-saya Marquis-in, the chair, and a brother peer to face
him (Westminster is partial to the Adelphi), success would be certain,
especially if the Leeds º le were to spare, just for one evening, LoRD
AMBERLEY to act as the 8. Lieutenant. How the silk dresses
would rustle with excitement! It cannot be contested that against
such a combination of talent neither MILL, nor CHADwick, nor
Romully could stand for a moment.

As may be supposed, the decision in the Colenso case is occupying the attention
of Government. At present, SIB Roundell, PALMER can more easily say what are

Potent, as LoRD PALMERSTON would say.
MR. WILLIERs, for Government, moved the Second Reading of the Union Charge-

dislike the poor, or at least dislike supporting the poor, from turning them out of
parishes. A rate is to be thrown over a group of those districts, so that the neat
tidy parish in which the cottages have been pulled down, and out of which the
labourers have been expelled, may no longer profit by its Paradisaical exclusiveness.

“Looking proudly to Heaven from a death-bed of fame."
After a row, or what in Speakerish language is called much irregularity, the
House got on the Mutiny Bill, and MR. Cox spoke against the flogging clause.
Mr. Punch has ever opposed the use of the lash upon the British soldier, inasmuch
as its true use is for the castigation of the British scoundrel. MR. Cox was talking,
however, for the Finsbury hustings, and for the information of the constituency
Mr. Punch begs to state that Mr. Cox did very great mischief to the cause he
affected to support. When a man talks insufferable nonsense on the side of reform,
he creates a number of new anti-reformers, and when MR. Cox said that if soldiers
were †. for absence from duty, Members of Parliament ought to be flogged for
not attending in their places, he excited contempt for himself, and for constituents
who could elect such a Wind-bag.. The flogging clause was carried by 85 to 42,
and Cox may have increased the majority by his vulgar folly.
Tuesday. MR. BAILLIE CochRANE and MR. DARBY GRIFFITH inserted themselves
between the House and a great debate on the Irish Church, much as a rubbishing
farce, is now played at the theatres before the drama of the night, in order to give
people time to eat their dinners and have a cigar. MR. CochRANE had a personal
wrangle with MR. GLADstone, who was contemptuous, and MR. GRIFFITH made a
long speech to prove that the Post-Master General ought not to be a Peer. As he
certainly ought to be in Parliament, and as it is against the law for him to be a
Member of the Commons, the House thought, with MR. PEEL, that there was no
need for MR. GRIFFlth's motion.
Then we had our debate on the Irish Church, MR. DiLlwyn, in a sensible speech,
urging that its position was unsatisfactory, and called for the early attention of
Government. If any person thinks that Mr. Punch is going to discuss the subject,
that person is less wise than Mr., Punch desires all, and believes, most of his readers
to be. THEO Donoghue seconded the motion in a neat speech. SIR GEORGE
GREY declared that there, was “no practical grievance.” MR. HARDY made a
sturdy fight for the Irish Church, and MR. GLADstone delivered a kind of two-part
oration. He admitted that the condition of the Irish establishment was unsatis-
lactory. He was not disposed to take up the subject, or even to promise to do so.
It was a question for the future...That is—if MR. Gladstone should be Premier,
he will see how the land lies. MR. WHITEside, of course, went in for a fight,
The .
upheld the Church, and made the curious statement that
among the present Members for Ulster were “men who
had sat in that house for nearly two centuries.” Dear us,
they must be very old. Surely they don't serve on Com-
mittees. Some Members wished to conclude the debate.
but it was adjourned % 221 to 106 until the 2nd of May,
when M.R. Gösch EN will resume it.
Wednesday. Ireland again—and we are reminded of the
fable of the Two Mice—the doors are flung open, and in rush
“Butler, chaplain, dogs, and all."
We had the butler last week, on the Spirit-Duty question,
esterday we had the chaplain, and to-day we had the dogs.
}: appears that in Ireland great numbers of dogs, run wild
and eat sheep, (though, MR. Scully says it is the otters
that do it,) and the Irishmen, instead of shooting the beasts
come to ask Parliament to kill them. An Anti-Dog Bill
was read a Second Time.
Then we had an A.Ş. Bill, or rather, two. SIR
FitzRoy KEELY and SIR John Shri.Lºy, to their, credit,
open a crusade against the low class of Chemists and Drug-
gists, who do incalculable mischief among the poor, espe-
cially in the way of poisoning children, Both Bills have
merit, and the respectable Chemists send in large numbers
of petitions in their favour. The case stands thus:–
Says KELLY to SHELLEY, “It’s not minio telle,
To wish every Chemist aware of what kills,
That when you go in with a pain in your–stomach,
He may not administer strychnine for squills.”
Says Shelley to KELLY, “I’m happy to tell ye
You've not got a call to look red in the gills,
We’re near, or in Lancashire dialect, “Welly’
Agreed, but I’m dealing with recognised ills.”
Says GREY, “When they send out JANE, Susan, or NELLY,
To fetch in a powder, wise men make their wills,
But I humbly suggest unto SHELLEY and KELLY
To let one Committee consider both Bills.”
Thursday, Lord KINNAIRD introduced a good Bill for
placing Metalliferous Mines under inspection, for the benefit
of the health of the miners... As these mines never blow
up, no pains is taken to ventilate them. It is well to take
thought for the poor Troglodytes.
Posterity may like to be informed that this evening we
finally and for ever settled the site of the Temple of Law.
Protest was made against placing it where no one will see
it, but it was answered that the Courts ought to be near
the lawyer's chambers. So we lose in architecture and
save in cab-hire.
The Attorney-GENERAL explained
Bill for reforming the Irish Courts of Chancery (Ireland
again), and MR. WHITESIDE abused it very much. The
debate was protracted, and at the end MR. Whalley
tried to speak. The House made an awful noise at this,
and MR. WHALLEY said that it was very hard that they
would not let him speak when they did not know what his
opinion of the Bill was. May we tell him, a little thing
which we heard from MR. John PARRY, in one of the
REED entertainments. “My child, why did you not ask
whether your poor aunt's headache was better?”
“Because, Mamuna, I didn't want to know.”
Friday. LoRD SHAFTESBURY, in a speech, of length,
dwelt on the hardships occasioned to the working classes
by the destruction of their residences for metropolitan and
other improvements. He proposed that ample notice should
be given of any intention of demolition. Lord REDEs-
DALE said that the noble Earl's statement, though inte-
resting, was much exaggerated, and that the land of London
was far too valuable for the lower classes to be allowed
to live upon it. The subject is to be “considered.”.
RAPHAEL's Cartoons (for which, never be it forgotten
England is indebted to the good KING OLIVER Cºorweij
are to come from Hampton Court Palace, to be shown at
Brompton, to the discontent of the Hampton folks. If
they could be seen at the Palace, we should advocate their
remaining there, but the room was not built for pictures,
and on most English days the Cartoons might as well
shut up. LoRD ST. LEoNARDs introduced the subject, and
also demanded why statues were not put on the pedestals
in the Hampton Palace Gardens. The fact is, there were
statues, but (whisper) they have been taken away to adorn
Windsor. The pedestals are very convenient for putting
your hat on while you sit on the grass, also for fat babies
whose mothers require rest, and we think, therefore, that
new statues are not wanted.

Protestant, MR. NkwoegATE is in, a fright lest the Pope, when ex-
pelled from Rome by his devoted children, should come here. Lord
PALMERstoN said that every one must feel great personal respect for
His Holiness, but that his coming to England, would be a political
solecism, in fact an anachronism. But England had, on a previous
occasion, offered the Vicar an asylum in. Malta. We cannot see, why
| he might not come here, and our Coliseum in the Regent's Park,
| instead of being converted into a Cockney terrace, with a sham stone
front, might be put into repair for His Holiness. The lake is nearly as
yellow as the Tiber, and the chained eagle would be a Fº
| inemento of his enemy the Emperor, the owls would remind him d
the Cardinals he might leave behind, the statuary, is decidedly Vati-
| canese, and in the ascending room he might rehearse his own apotheosis.
| We think the idea most felicitous. -
Ireland again. But if all her patriots behaved as wisely and temperately
as MR. MAGUIRE, we should never grudge her the four days out of
ſive which she now gets. He spoke on Tenant-Right, and was ſollowed
by many other Members who |. upon the impossibility of regene-
rating Ireland while a tenant had no fixed tenure, and could claim
nothing for improvements. The Irish landlords are a good deal like
dogs in the manger. They cannot, or will not improve the land, and
they refuse such conditions as would justify a tenant in doing so. No
doubt, such conditions would soon cause a good deal of property to
change hands, but so much the better. LoRD PALMERSTON waited to
see what the House thought, and at last, perceiving that the current
set, strongly for inquiry, he made a clever speech against tenant right
as he chose to describe it (the Conservatives cheering) but conceded a
Committee to look into the working, or rather the failure, of the
Improvement Acts of 1860. But even this would have let in the
whole question, and MR. WHITESIDE got the inquiry again limited to
one Act, only. Let the wedge in, Gentlemen, and Punch will help you
with such a knock. At the same time we are convinced that any sort
of agricultural arrangement would be but a tinkering business. The
real thing to do is to º all the priests, convert all the Irish to
Protestantism, and make the Brogue felony. When these little reforms
shall be carried, Ireland will indeed be the first gem of the earth and
first flower of the See of Canterbury.

Some faults we may have got : we’ve shortcomings, who has not ?
Are your Yankee clients all from failing free, John BRight?
But John BULL upon the whole is a very worthy soul
And I wish the world were all as good as he, John BRight.
Let others vent their spite, and vow we ne'er act right:
There are many our prosperity offends, John BRIGHT:
We may safely, trust our foes our errors to expose,
And we need no ill-judged censure from our friends, John BRIGHT.
I hate as much as you the silly boastful crew,
Who vaunt our very vices to the skies, John BRIGHT:
But they who snarl and sneer when from error we are clear,
Such critics I most heartily despise, John BRIGHT.
I hate the bunkum trick of rowdy rhetoric,
That blackens with a breath the whitest acts, John BRIGHT:
And I hate the carping tongue, that twists right into wrong,
And from wisest deeds maliciously detracts, John BRIGHT.
So prithee mend your ways, nor old England so dispraise,
funpatriotic rancour clear your breast, JoHN BRIGHT:
While in comfort here you live, to John Bull, some credit give,
'Tis an evil bird that fouleth its own nest, John BRIGHT.
If Yankeeland you love all other lands above,
Why not hasten to that Eden o'er the sea, John BRIGHT *
Prithee go and fraternise with the people you so prize,
Who may value you more highly than do we, John BRIGHT.
Much to BE DESIRED.—When Constituencies send such men to

SWAINS AND SPARROWS AT SHIPLEY.
The ignorance of natural history disgracing the rustics who till the
soil of certain º: of England is just equal to the greatness of their
opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of it. Many of them believe
that the cuckoo changes into a sparrow-hawk, that the slowworm and
even the stone-loach are venomous, and that a horsehair Fº into a pond
gets animated and becomes a worm. Subjoined, from the East Susser
Gazette, is an illustration of this boorish ignorance which the clowns of
a Boeotia in the South of England rejoice in :-
“Shipſ,FY.
“SrARRow Club.-On the 2nd inst the members of the Sparrow Club held their
annual meeting at the Selsey Arms †h. 23 sat down to an excellent dinner,
served up by MR. and Mrs. SLATER in their usual style. After the removal of the
cloth the accounts were examined, and the Chairman announced that 10,807 spar-
row and other heads had been sent in during the year, that being about 900 more
than last year, and about 3,000 more than the year previous, showing clearly there
is no scarcity of birds yet, and it was unanimously agreed to carry the club on
another year, in spite of Punch, “ or any other man.'”
Hush, ye pretty warbling quire! would be the song for the song-bird
slaughtering Swains of Shipley, if their ears were short enough to appre-
ciate it. Å. there no local gentry about Shipley who take enough
interest in their tenants to be desirous of restraining them from doing
themselves, damage, for want of knowing better than to attempt the
extermination of the little birds? If there are, they should organise
some method of imparting the requisite instruction to such louts as
those who dined the other day at the Selsey Arms, to celebrate the
destruction of 10,807 sparrows and other small birds which they had
caused during the past year. It would be a charity to beat, if possible,
into the heads of these boobics a calculation of the number of caterpillars
and grubs whose increase they must have occasioned by that stupid
i.f. A Clodhopper's Institution, whereat lectures on ornithology
could be delivered, might be established at Shipley with some advantage,
if the Shipley bumpkins were capable of understanding any lectures.
What, however, would probably answer the ..". in view better,
would be an opposition, to the Sparrow Club, under the name of a
Caterpillar Club, established to promote the extirpation of mischievous
insects by preserving the sparrows, and finches, and feathered, song-
sters, of which the massacre is .." by a society of blockheads.
The chawbacons of Shipley understand eating and drinking, if not
much else, and if they were annually to meet and dine, their swinish
obstinacy might be so far overcome by the influence, of a good dinner
!. to allow them to be persuaded to let the little birds live and eat up
e Wermlin.
GOOD NEWS.
The Police are at last beginning to put down street mendicants and
impostors. The excitement this invasion of the vested rights of tattered
vagrancy has caused, in Crutched Friars particularly, beggars descrip-
tion. The movement, as it affects that crying evil, professional babies,
is yet in its infancy; but the blind, with or without their leading
articles, find their steps dogged, and the spurious sailors, decked in
nautical attire, are all at sea. - --
We have reason for believing that the sphere of operations is likely
to be extended. ºf the question, especially in the neighbourhood
of Westminster, is no longer to be tolerated. Lame excuses will not
be listened to, and all those persons who are wilfully blind, and shut
their eyes to the consequences, will be transported, say, to the Cataracts.
Any one, after this notice, halting between two opinions (or two
lamp-posts) is liable to be brought before the Alderman of Cripplegate,
in whose worshipful presence The will find himself in a hobble, and
without a leg to stand on. As ragged clothes (too often en suite
with rents in arrear) are viewed with suspicion, persons out of elbows
are cautioned to keep the Police at arm’s length.

THE UTILISATION OF FLOGGING.
MR. PUNCH, -
A PARLIAMENTARY return just issued affords us the gratifying
information that the Garotters' Act of 1863, punishing attempts at
robbery, accompanied by violence, with flogging, has not been allowed
to remain a dead letter. In the first year § the operation of this
salutary measure, under its beneficent provisions, according to the
document above referred to, 19 prisoners were flogged in $º.
Three of those ruffians, underwent the unpleasant application of the
cat-o'-nine-tails in Coldbath-fields Prison, one at Horsemonger-lane
Gaol, three at Kirkdale (Liverpool), one at Salford New Bailey, four in
Birmingham Borough Prison, four in Leeds Gaol, one in the County
Gaol at Reading, and two at Durham. Out of the three rascals who
experienced the ecstasies of deserved flagellation at Kirkdale, there was
one, a young villain of 19, who, in addition to four years' penal servi-
tude, had been sentenced to fifty lashes. These appeals to the onl
tender feeling which a Garotter has, were addressed thereto with suc
vigour, that the subject of them was completely subdued, and became
so deeply affected that the surgeon in attendance was obliged to order
him to be taken down from the whipping-post by the time that he had
writhed under thirty-six.
The infliction of useless pain,however, is to be deprecated, and the
pain inflicted on the nineteen villain. flogged in 1863 under the Garot-
ters' Act was not so useful as it might have been rendered. It has had
little publicity beyond that given to it by respectable papers, and its
exemplary, effect, which constitutes its use, has been proportionally
limited. Yells and shrieks have, indeed, not been wasted on the prison
air, wherein they have doubtless made a desirable impression on many
ears; but their vibrations, arrested by walls, have not extended to the
atmosphere of thieves' houses of call, and other haunts of the felonry
in the slums; There are objections to public flogging similar to those
which would apply to surgical operations. But one thing might be
done to give the roughs, who are inclined to be Garotters, some idea of
what the º inflicted on a Garotter is. An elaborate *...*.
of the face of every such criminal condemned to be flogged could be
taken whilst he is experiencing the sensations, excited º the scourge,
at the moment when his features are contorted with their strongest
expression. What a :8...". ery might thus have been
derived from (the nineteen Garotters who were flogged in 1863.' The
police might distribute copies of these sun-pictures amongst those whom
they would be calculated to edify; and engravings from them might, be
published in the low illustrated papers which are principally devoted to
reports and narratives of crime;
he utilisation of flogging, thus effected, would soen reduce the sta-
tistics, so painful to many an amiable mind, of the infliction of that
cruel punishment on the poor, offender who, for the sake of a little
money, or a watch and chain, has only crushed somebody's windpipe,
or knocked his front teeth down his throat, or cracked his skull, without
MERCY.
The Birthday of Uranus.
THE Members of the Astronomical Society dined together on the
20th ult, to celebrate the completion, by Uranus, of his first revolution
round the Sun, made since HERschel discovered him, on the 13th of
March, 1781, and thus occupying a period of eighty-four years and seven
days, corresponding to the 365 days and 6 hours which this planet takes
to perform its annual circuit. The jovial astronomers drank the health
of Uranus on his accomplishment of another year, and wished him many
happy returns of the day.

ONE night as I silently wandered
By Cam's slow meandering stream,
And many things mentally pondered,
I saw, as it were in a dream,
A black head emerge from the billows,
A broad body swim through the flood,
Till, beneath the o'ershadowing willows,
It sank gently down in the mud.
All alone—as a Scholar of Tyrwhitt
When examined in Hebrew he sits—
On a log that mysterious spirit -
Smokes in silence, and silently spits.
And yet not alone sat the vision;
There came, as he sat on his log,
A wag of delight and submission
From the tail of each demi-drowned dog.
Black eels from his temples were hanging,
His teeth were like teeth of a jack;
His lips were inaudibly “slanging;"
His eyes were all muddy and black; .
And water-snakes, round his neck twining,
Were hissing; and water-rats swam
At his feet; so without much divining
I recognised Old Father Cam.
“All hail to thee, Camus the weedy 1"
I cried, in alarm and surprise;
“Say why are thy garments so reedy?
And .# are these tears in thine eyes?”
Then the River-god answered me sadly,
“My glory aquatic is gone !
My prospects, i. ! look but badly;
Not a race for four years have I won.
“I have as oarsmen as strong—even stronger—
Than when my first honours I bore;
Their arms are as long—perhaps longer;
Their shoulders as broad as of yore.
Yet the prospects of light-blue look bluer;
I am losing my swing, form, and time;
For who can row well in a sewer,
Or pull through miasma and slime *
Thus murmured the River-god moaning,
But I bade him to dry his old eye–
“In vain is this weeping and groaning
Let your motto be, ‘Never say die |
Though your waves be more foul than Cocytus,
Though your º: no doubt, are most blue;
Since Oxford is ready to fight us,
We will try to select a good crew.
“My friend Lady Margaret tells me
She can lend me a Bow and a Two:
The Lady, I own, sometimes sells/me,
But this time I am sure she’ll be true.
For WATNEY is wiry and Fº
And that BEEBEE’s A1 all allow;
And our boat cannot fail to be lucky
With a double lst Class in the bow.
“Then Corpus its Pigott shall lend us,
Young, healthy, and active, and strong;
And Etona her KINGLAKE shall send us,
To row our good vessel along;
And five, from the head of the River,
Like Pallas from Jove's head appearing,
Shall add to the weight of the quivet
Of the feather-weight Argonaut steering,
- – ~ Tº---------
“Then BoBTHwick, the mighty and massive,
Shall row like a Briton at Six;
And GRIFFITHs, not prone to be passive,
Shall pull us to glory like bricks.
Our ‘Stroke,” people say, on the feather
Is a trifle too fond of a pause;
But while some say “there's º: like leather,’
I maintain there is nothing like LAWEs.
“Washerwomen, not over º
Says he rows ‘like a mangle'—what trash
That his swing and his time are erratic;
That he puts in his oar with a splash.
But these wonderful judges of rowing,
If we win, will be loud in applause;
And declare ‘the result was alſ owing
To that excellent stroke, MR. LAwes.”
“Qur. Coach, on the bank briskly riding
Will keep this strong team well together,
His Bucephalus gamely bestriding,
In spite of the wind and the weather.
For the laws of the land you may send me
To Counsel from chambers in Town;
For the laws of true rowing commend me
To the CHAMBERs of Cambridge renown.
“Then cheer up, beloved Father Camus ! -
Blow your nose! dry those tears that are falling;
You will live once again to be famous,
In spite of the prospect appalling.
Though dead dogs down your fair stream are floating,
Father Cam will their odours defy;
Though, Oxford may beat us in boating,
Yet Cambridge will “never say die l’”
WETERINARY POOR-LAW.
At the Bakewell Petty Sessions, the other day, before the local
Magistrates and LORD GEORGE CAVENDISH, Chairman, MR. John
BIRLEY, a farmer at Wardlaw, was charged by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals with having ill-treated, abused, and
tortured four cows and a calf.
Having been convicted of this º MR. BIRLEY was sentenced to
two months' imprisonment with har labour in the Derby House of
Correction.
The ill-treatment, abuse, and torture of four cows and a calf, for
which FARMER B1RLEY has been sent to F. and perspire on the
treadmill, or work his fingers' ends raw with picking oakum for two
months, did not, ...hº...! to wrenching those animals' tails off,
breaking their heads or limbs, cutting, lacerating, prodding, or otherwise
violently hurting them, but it consisted in keeping them without food
and neglecting them, insomuch that they became exceedingly emaciated
and filthy, an lowed aloud with hunger and pain.
The only excuse which Mr. Birº could offer to palliate his want
of care for his own stock, was, that he “ was very sorry for it, but he
could not help it, hay was so scarce.” The scarcity of dead stock was
all that he could urge in extenuation of letting his live stock want.
What if they had actually starved?, Would BIRLey have got off with
two months' imprisonment and hard labour? A wretch may merit, but
cannot earn penal servitude by cruelty to animals. MR. BIRLEY, how-
ever, had his cows and calf positively died of famine, would no doubt
have received the fullest allowance of correction, in the House thereof,
that the Bakewell Magistrates could have legally awarded him.
It is something to be said for British benevolence to the brute
creation that the offence of withholding the necessaries of life from four
cows and a calf, subjects their owner, a man in the respectable position
of a farmer, to the punishment of a Thief Suppose those animals had
been only so many paupers, and MR. BIRLEY a relieving officer who
refused them the means of sustenance on the plea that he could not
help it, but really the rates were so high. That would have been quite
another affair. There is no County crop or treadmill, or oakum-picking,
or crank, for “Cruelty to Paupers;” nor do Boards of Guardians and
Workhouse officials incur penal consequences from that economy to
which is owing the very frequent announcement of a human creature's
“Death from Destitution.”

MR. PUNCH's FIRST OF APRIL LEVéE.
STRANGE CAB PHENOMENON.
DEAR MR. Punch, ...
The Natural History of the Cabman must always have been
interesting to the human zoologist. Permit me to describe a pheno-
menon.
I am an Author. I had, however, chambers. in the Quter Temple.
For reasons of my own, one being that I like to be able to ring people
up in the night, like Pope, when I have an inspiration, I now reside at
one of the Great Railway Hotels, which we will call the East-Southern
| Hotel.
When I lived in the ..". I never had a row with a Cabman. He
always drove me straight home thither, and he was always satisfied
with his fare, or at least he never remonstrated, far less abused me.
Now, that I live in the Hotel, I 'almost º: have a row with m
Cabman. He tries, to take me a long and roundabout ... I home, and,
the other night, insisted on going over two bridges, when he needed to
go over none; and he always remonstrates about the fare, and often
abuses me.
Yet one place is as well known to the Cabmen, as the other, and the
fares are printed and hung up at my present abode.
How do you account for this strange difference? A cynical friend
of mine says that while I was in the Temple, the drivers took me for a
lawyer, and one who would take vengeance for any attempt at cheating,
while they now, suppose me to be a provincial, ignorant of London
º and of the just ; of the cab.
But, think better of Cabman nature. Surely, men who have a
Club, and talk pretty, and sing hymns to Lord SHAFTESBURY, cannot
be such sordid and greedy wretches. There must be some other ex-
planation. Can your readers offer one, or will the Cabmen themselves
discuss the topic at their next meeting, before the hymn P
Believe me, ever yours,
John GAY.
P.S.. I discovered a singular mode of quickening a Cabman's appre-
hension the other #, told him to go to Argyll Place, and, as usual,
hºpretended not to know where it was, in order to see whether I knew.
When I said, “Close to the Marlborough Street Police Office,” you
should have seen how he dashed off, and he was so civil when I got out.
EARCH small and great, search Church and State,
Search home and foreign annals!
To Punch's studio, April-fools
Of all professions, crafts, and schools!
sitters he'll find for all his stools,
Faces for all his panels.
First, room for Church!—Left in the lurch,
Our Reverends might be bling.
But ere we seek §:... at home,
With the bold Bowy ER shoot to Rome,
Where—fool's-cap o'er a close-cut comb-
The old tiara's ºf
Believe in Pope and Papal rule,
You April-fool, you April-fool!
But Rome-wards why with NEwMAN fly,
Or Monsignore MANNINGP
While GRAY ColeNso votes Old Harry's,
Nor, ere he hurls perdition, tarries
To find out if his patent carries
The privilege of banning.
So much Church-cry, so little wool!–
Lo! GRAY done brown as April-fool!
For ex-Zulu Col.ENso too
Punch has a cap becoming,
Who thinks the written record's floor
#. out, since two and two make four,
While Moses' total comes to more
Than doth Colenso's summing.
Ground your faith on a ciphering-rule !—
You April-fool, you April-fool!
Nor Broad Church drops behind in crops
Of rich, ripe, April folly:
Here’s KINGsiley writes, talks, lectures, bustles,
To prove faith, somehow, hangs on muscles;
That with Old Nick the more one tussles
The more one should be #:
Trade-competition's fire would cool l—
The April-fool, the April-fool!

And “ Church, Church, Church 1” his creed is;

THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING BAD-L00KING,
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
WHAT a ..ºf it is that one is not a beauty! I declare, the
longer live the more thankful I am that I was born with carroty
hair, and a nose, that is turn-uppy. The trouble I am saved by my
º is incalculable. See, for instance, what a martyrdom, I must
ave undergone if my hair had been worth frizzing up and fashionably
dressing. This is how the pretty hairesses of Paris are now tortured:–
“LADIRs' HAIR.—The Paris correspondent of the Post, in reply to an a
from a , writes:-" I have consulted a great hairdresser of the sublime school,
who says that this winter he has often commenced work at 1 P.M., so that the lad
must remain some ten hours in full toilette, with her hair pinned, bound, stretched,
flowered, jewelled-painfully uncomfortable. It is only as a great favour that these
tº.” can be had at all ; ladies during the season are obliged to implore
em to attend.'"
First catch your hair; this of course, must be the rule with the
“Sublime school” of coiffeurs. Their Sublimities would never conde-
scend to waste, their talents on a woolly head like mine, which the
highest art would fail in rendering attractive...So I am safe from hº
to sit for ten hours at a stretch, without the liberty of stretching. An
see, here are other nuisances that I escape by being, happily, anything
but beautiful:—
“He declares that you may wear your hair in any fantastic fashion; some ladies
at Court have adopted the classical Grecian style—the haird off the face, and
a bunch of clustering ringlets at the back of the head. Others have gone in for a
series of small curls all over the forehead, and little impertinent twisting locks
round about the ears—baby curls, just life; while the mass of hair is
gathered up on the top of the head, and there studded with flowers, or butterflies,
or even gaudy insects.”
... Fidgety little ringlets must be troublesome enough; but how nasty
it must be to have one's back hair full of insects! Fancy having
dragon-flies, and spiders, on one's head! ... Ugh ! I shudder at the
notion! I think I’d rather, be quite bald than let my hair be full of
butterflies; and who knows but the fashion º be sºon to wear big
blue-bottles, or, more horrid still, black beetles?. A i. who is insane
enough to put a butterfly in her hair, might be fairly thought to have a
be in her bonnet O the sorrows of the Handsome at the hands of the
hairdresser, “O the pleasures of the Plain” in escaping such inflic;
tions ! ...When I peep into my glass, and think what torments I might
suffer if it were not for my ugliness, I shall heartily thank goodness
that I am not good-looking.
So believe me yours contentedly,
MARIA MILDEW.

If Mr. Punch had found the note and had acted strictly on the terms
of this advertisement, the loser would not have been much the gainer
by the finding. Mr. Punch values his time at a sovereign a second;
and as picking º a five-pound note would take at least five seconds,
Mr. Punch would feel quite justified in pocketing the note, which he
would think a “reasonable” repayment for his trouble.
Another gem of Irish composition is the following:—
TIDY, active, and willing little Woman, of great experience, desires
to wait upon an elderly Lady or Invalid; could on an emergency nurso a baby,
make an excellent plum pudding, dress a good dinner, make a delicious cup of
coffee, or act as housekeeper; would be found a most trustworthy person, and a
great acquisition in a respectablo family; is a Protestant; without followers; a
native of Belfast. Address, &c
If this little woman wants to “wait upon an invalid, or an elderly
lady,” what she says about herself º not tend very much to carry
out her wishes. Invalids cannot eat “good dinners,” and the sight of a
lum pudding would tantalise them terribly; while old ladies, as a rule,
we not a baby to be nursed, and even if they had, they would ;
choose a cook, to help, them at the cradle. Perhaps in Paddyland,
however, a scullery-maid is hired to look after the nursery, while the
office of a nurse is to make the pies and puddings and keep the kitchen
tidy.

AN AWFUL QUESTION.
ToUCHING what is called “PoWPEy's Pillar,” and which is as much
PoMPEr's as that at Charing Cross is CAESAR's, a contemporary says:-
“The engineer employed by the WicrºRoy of Egypt to repair this column, has
found that the pillar rests on a cube of very hard pudding-stone within the base-
ment. This cube bears an inscription in hieroglyphics_turned upside down, and is,
in fact, the capital of a column § to one of the temples of Upper
conveyed hither for the express purpose of serving for the base of the column. M.
MARIETTE has deciphered the inscription, and found the name of SEsosrRIs THE
SECOND, the father of the great SEsost Ris, mentioned in it; so that Pompey's pillar,
now 1500 years old, rests on the fragment of a monument erected at least seventeen
centuries before the Christian era.”
All this chronology is nothing to the purpose, and the column itself,
as everybody who can read, and remember what he reads, knows, is
merely the last remaining pillar of a temple. But the question is this—
Has, the French engineer obliterated, a name which is not in hiero:
lyphics, upside down or not, but in the biggest and plainest English?
as he defaced the world-famous legend,
W. BUTTON ?
If he has, we can only . that we are glad the Agincourt and the
Minotaur are so nearly ready.
The Gifts of Morpheus.
WHEN Sleep has brought pleasures that seem
As real as those of broad day,
How jolly to wake from your dream
And find that you’ve nothing to pay!
AN ARCTIC MARCH.
THE month just departed in cold and snow has not exactly verified
the popular saying, that if March comes in like a Lion he goes out like
a, Lamb....This year, indeed, March came in like a Lion, but went out
like a White Bear.

A SENSATION SITUATION.
WHO would not be a Lady Teacher in a Ladies' School Only see
what a *. of knowledge she must have, and what a quantity of
money she can make by it:-
WANºp, a TEACHER, over 21, in a very Large, Old-Established
Ladies' School. She must be a thorough arithmetician, well versed in geo-
graphy, general history, grammar, with the rudiments of French and music. None
need apply without a good method of teaching, combined with health and activity.
Unexce ble references required. Salary to commence at £12 per annum.
If MR. BABBAGE were the President of the Royal Geographical
Society, and knew as much of general history as HALLAM and MACAULAY
did, he might perhaps, were he a lady, be deemed tolerably competent
to fill this situation, provided he were thoroughly well grounded in
good grammar, and knew enough of French and music to teach them
with success. Stay, though—he must have a “good method, of
teaching” (whatever that may signify), and he must “combine”. it
with " i health and, activity,” or he would not be eligible for
this attractive place. Then, if he were a lady, and were over twenty-
one, and had the good luck to obtain this lucrative appointment, his
salary would “commence” at £12 per annum, and goodness only knows
in what a vast increase of income it might ultimately end. Even
£20 a year might eventually be paid to him, ...; he were she who
is so fortunate as to secure this most remunerative place. Dramatists
on the look-out for a “sensation situation,” should turn their eyes to
this one, which no lady could fill without having the sensation of being
greatly overtasked and grossly underpaid for it.
Politics and Music.
THERE is no truth in the rumour that MR. BRAND, the famous H.Q.
Whip, is about to be deposed. The report, it is believed, arose simply
from the fact that, a few evenings ago, a number of ºf Members
lounged into the lobby, ºf fresh from the Fourth Act of the Opera

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT,
on DAY, April 3.
LoRD CLARENDON
moved the Second
Reading , of the
Public Schools Bill.
It has merits, and
nobody is pleased
with it, which may
be another of those
merits. Everybody
has an interest in
some one school,
which he conceives
to be perfect, be:
cause it educated
him, or is educating
his boys, but he
allows that other
schools require im-
provement. ..., Mr.
Punch decidedly
objects to any
authority being set
up to dominate
over the Head
Master,upon whose
personal character
depends the wel-
- fare of a school.
But then all Head Masters Qught to be ARNOLDs, or as near that pattern as possible.
There will be a great deal of discussion before this Bill becomes º and a measure
which is to affect the training of the entire upper and upper middle classes of
England deserves all consideration.
SIR MoRTON PETo delivered himself of a *. inst the Board of Admiralty.
His attack was greatly disapproved of by LoRD CLARENCE. PAGET. SIR John
PAKINGTON had his own objections, to the present system. It is all very well to
talk over the business, but the plain English is that no Minister dares reform the
Admiralty system, for there are too many votes dependent upon the maintenance of
things in their present condition. Everybody, except the innocent believers in
speeches, knows this. Some day we shall be in a war, and the war will be in a
muddle, and then the Admiralty will be blown—where MR. BoyTHORN, in Bleak
House, wanted to blow the Court of Chancery.
The Barnet ... ordered two boys to be whipped, and also ordered the
police to perform that operation. ... Now, criminal boys have not that sº courage
which is inculcated (under penalty of an extra wopping in the play-fields) at Eton,
Harrow, and Rugby, and of receiving a whipping in silence, they bellow.
Perhaps the absence of elevated teaching, and also of ; and bread-and-butter and
other strengthening influences, may in some measure account for the difference.
Anyhow, they do bellow, and the noise is not pleasant to hear. The police object to
whip, and say also that crowds are attracted by the sound. SIR RICHARP MAYNE
sustains them. MR, ADDERLEY protests t police assumption. The HoME
SECRETARY thinks the police right. MR HENLEY made much fun of the punish:
ment, ridiculed birching being described by the sensation term “lashes,” and
intimated that the floggings which he, and probably SIR GEORGE GREY, had received
in earlier life had done them no harm. But, he added, we were fast becoming the
most police-ridden country in Europe. agis-
- e. We do not know how the Barnet
trates have settled the affair, but it says in Boyle's Chronology that in a country
place a culprit was, some years ago, ordered to be flogged, and that there was no
one who would lay on the cat except the Mayor, and therefore his Worship himself
tucked up his robes, and let into the rogue like a man.
We then voted all sorts of Estimates, and finally another row broke out, and the
Head Master was º to say that the boys might go away, for that they were
“not in a temper” for their work. The sudden change in #: weather makes us
all quarrelsome–
“Our bloods no less obey the Heavens
Than do a courtier's looks the king’s.”
A much-disputed passage in the Divine W., which Mr. Punch has, with his usual
acumen, rectified into the sense which distinguishes most of the writings of Divine
w. With a thermometer one day at 43" in a gas-lit bed-room, and the next at 60°
in the open air, no fellah ought to be expected to be reasonable.
Tuesday, The Lords sat down and got up again, and the Commons did not even
o #"; that formality. For this was a great day for the Metropolis of the
World. e feel that we ought to get up a little classic learning to flash off about
the Grand Sewers, but DR. WILLIAM SMITH's Dictionary is on a shelf on the other
side of our library, and our getting up for it is out of the question, and Mrs. Punch
is gone to hear Mºnio in Faust. So we cannot draw upon our memory. There
were Sewers in Rome, woppers, made by TARQUINIus PRiMus, who married TANA-
§. a lady who had the feminine art of making the best of things, and we like her.
When an eagle flew away with her husband's hat, MRs. TANAquil, instead of saying
that it was just like him, and that he could no more take care of his things than a
child, and that he had need have a fortune to be going every day to LINCONIUs &
BENNETTUs's for new hats, said, with a proud smile, "A good omen, love! and it
means that your head will be very high.” He was made
King, and he made drains. LIvy says that you could drive
aloid of hay through them, and we wish that our drains
had been made large enough for the railway vans, and the
Van Demons were compelled to go through the sewers.
We do not remember any other classical remarks at present,
and therefore proceed to state that this day the PRINCE of
WALEs went to Crossness, and set the engines at work,
and that it was a great day for THWAITEs and BAJAzET-
what's his name, BAZALGETTE–and we suppose that they
will be knighted or barrow.knighted, as they deserve,
or be decorated with the Order of the Sewer. We have
not seen any Thames salmon yet, but MR. QUARTERMAINE
has taken up his place in his b º: with a long rod and
line, to be * to catch the very first, and has promised
to telegraph. Pensive public, what? The Essence is a
good deal pleasanter when there is no Parliament? But
you mustn't say such things. ..
Wednesday. THEO Donoghue wishes to do away with
an Irish law of QUEEN ANNE's, by which “Tories, Robbers,
and Rh rees” can be sent to penal servitude for beg.
ging. If it include Tories who beg for yotes at elections,
we imagine that the Act may be inconvenient, but we see no
º for the repeal, and for once MR. Scully agrees
Wilun us.
But if Beggars are not to be sent to penal servitude...MR.
WILLIERs has introduced into his Houseless Poor Bill an
excellent clause for dealing with Mendicants. If the mea-
sure becomes law, Begging in London is at an end. The
police are to take into custody every person who begs, or
professes to be in distress. If he be a deserving object, he
is to be taken into the Casual Ward, at the Workhouse
and the Pººl there is to be compelled to receive and
relieve him. If he be an impostor, he is to be dealt with
under the Wagrant Act. This is good news for the really
distressed, and also for the ladies in the suburbs, who
cannot take a walk without being importuned or bullied.
Could not the Act be made to include Crossing Sweepers,
who are a horrible nuisance, as Mr. Punch has often set
forth, he having to repulse at least seventeen, every time
he walks from his villa to his office. What right has the
Crossing Sweeper to “squat” on the QUEEN’s highway,
and play highwayman?
Thursday. Holborn and Whitechapel are to be improved
—a Bill for the purpose passed the Lords. We are very
fond of taking pensive walks in Whitechapel, and should ;
there oftener, but for the incessant importunities of the
inhabitants that we should buy and devour the staple pro-
duct of the district, namely, whelks, of which we are not
extravagantly fond. As regards Holborn it is at present
the most detestable thoroughfare in Íondon. Everybody
who walks is run over in High Holborn, and everybody
who rides is thrown out of his cab on Holborn Hill. We
shall rejoice to see *{...º. -
The Wimbledon Common Inclosure Bill was read a
Second Time, after considerable opposition. A Committee
has reported against LoRD SPENCER's three proposals—the
fencing, the selling part of the land, and the extinction of
everybody's º except his own. Nevertheless, it was
thought, that the Bill ought to go before the Private Bill
Committee. It was rather plainly hinted that the public
might get much worse but we decline to believe
that LoRD SPENGER would do §: of an ungene-
; kind, even if his plan should be defeated. Noblesse
00I '96.
Another Canada debate, and it appears that the Colonists
are by no means satisfied with the amount of defence which
England *: to º One thing is certain, namely,
that either the colony and the mother-country must act in
perfect accord and harmony, or Canada will vote at the
next Presidential Election, yes, Sir. -
SIR GEORGE GREY will devise some relief for the com-
positors and other persons really aggrieved by the working
of the Act which was intended chiefly for the º: down
the scoundrel-dens in the Haymarket and elsewhere, and
which has worked very well indeed, though,there is much
to be done, as at certain . Music-Halls, before cognate
nuisances can be exterminated. If, as foup MACAULAY
and SYDNEY SMITH contend, Government is simply a Stout
Constable, let it do constable's duty.

the world. Can he be aware that at some civic banquets the Companies
are reduced to give Mock instead of Real Turtle, and that at others
common water is handed round after dinner instead of rose water? in

Apart from our usual summary, and in another tone, must be, noted
the Parliamentary references to the death of a great and good man.
Qn Sunday, April 2nd, the valuable life of Richało Cobbºn ended.
Elsewhere, our own tribute to the departed is paid. Here be, it said
only that on the Monday night the House of Commons listened to the
earnest and honesty.ords of the PREMIER, and to the eloquent language
of the Leader of Opposition, both uniting in honourable testimony
to the character of him who is gone. A portion of the speech of MR.
Disraeli may be the most fitting termination to this brief record:—
“Although it was the fortune of MR. Connes to enter public life at a time when
passions ran high, still when the strife was over there was soon observed in him the
moderation and tempered course that intimated a º intellectual horizon, and the
possession of statesmanlike qualities. There was in his character a peculiar vein of
reverence for tradition, which often, unconsciously to himself, subdued and softened
the acerbity of the conclusions at which he may have arrived. . . . As a debater
he had few equals, as a logician he was close and complete, and I would say adroit,
acute, and, perhaps, even subtle; yet, at the same time, he was gifted with that
degree of imagination that he never lost sight of the sympathies of those whom he
addressed, and so, generally avoiding to drivehisargument to extremity, he became
as a speaker both practical and persuasive. . . Sir, there is something mournful
in the history of this Parliament, when we remember how many of our most emi-
ment and valued men have passed from amongst us; but, Sir, there is this conso-
lation to us, when we remember these unequalled and irreparable losses, that those
great men are not altogether lost to us—that their words will be often quoted in
this House—that their example will often be referred to and appealed to-and that
even their expressions will form part of our discussions and debates. There are
now, I may say, some Members of Parliament who, although they may not be
present, are still Members of the House, who are independent of dissolutions, of the
caprice of constituencies, and even of the course of time. I think, Sir, MR. Cobden
was one of those men, and I believe that when the verdict of posterity will be re-
corded º his life and conduct, it will be said of him that, looking to his expres-
sions and his deeds, he was without doubt the greatest political character that the
pure middle-class of the º
has ever produced—that he was an ornament to
the House of Commons and an
onour to England.”
SONG FOR THE THAMESSALMON PRESERWINGSOCIETY.
HERE's to the trout weighing pounds, say, fifteen,
Here’s to the salmon of twenty;
Keep an eye on their spawning, and make the Thames clean,
And you soon will have fish there in plenty.
Chorus. Let the fry pass,
They’ll be bigger next grass,
The man who would fish out of season’s an ass.
Here’s to the ladders by which the fish scale,
When they swim to the weirs that impede them;
Look, there º a Salmon! just see, what a tail!
And it costs but clean water to feed them.
Chorus. Let the fry pass, &c.
So º poachers and keep away pike,
And keep away poisonous matter,
And you’ll catchin the Thames all the salmon you like,
And you’ll nowhere see finer or fatter.
Chorus. Let the fish pass, &c.

attention is also invited to the subjoined paragraph, taken from the
Montreal Gazette:-
“THE • PERMIssive Act.”—MR, Dunkin's Act does not appear to satisfy its
advocates. Many of the townships in Upper Canada which adopted it, after a few
weeks' trial, are sick of it. In some places the unlicensed sale of liquor takes place
openly, and the law is so unpopular that no one dares prosecute."
The failure of the Canadian DuNKIN's attempt at dictating the drink
of his neighbours may serve to show our English donkeys, who pester
the Legislature with the demand of a Permissive Prohibitory Liquor
Law, how much they would accomplish even if they obtained an Act of
Parliament for the purpose of ruining the publicans, robbing the poor
man of his beer, º creating a vast deficit in the revenue. Let us hear
no more of their officious nonsense, and let it be understood that the
regulation of other people's habits is henceforth to be confined to tailors
and dressmakers.

RICHARD COBDEN.
DIED APRIL 2, 1865.
Solº MN and sad his task who, from the shore,
Watches Time's slow but surely rising wave,
As landmark after landmark it sweeps o'er, .
And whelms great things and men in one wide grave.
So the pale sentinel on Neva's pier
ords the wasting waters’ sullen swell,
Till all the pile-based city shakes for fear
Of some huge fall—church, palace, citadel.
I am not old who watch, but from my post. .
What kingly strengths have I seen wail their crown,
What statelinesses bowed, what pride and boast
By those dark waters toppled, sudden, down |
One more high tower has fallen, that stood four-square,
Simple, and scant of ornament, but strong,
As fits a fortalice, whose walls must bear
Sheltering Right, the rude assaults of Wrong.
He had done work to fill a longer life,
And lived to see his life's work rounded elean:
Seldom has sun that lit a morn of strife,
Set in the hush of evening so serene.
The man whose young strength struck the shackles off
From England's toiling arm and trading hand,
Lived to knit close—in spite of sneer and scoff—
England and France in Traffic's triple strand.
Poor in world's wealth, but rich in stainless fame,
Untitled, yet a magnate in the land,
That honour blazons RICHARD CoBDEN's name,
Which life well-lived and work well done command.
Circumstance shaped his lot, as it shapes all:
The path it oped seemed narrow, hard, and bare;
No grace of letters made a flowery wall
To mask its bounds, nor arts, nor arms passed there
The path of trade, that leads—who shall say where?—
To humble competence, and low content,
To wealth and wisdom, or to wealth and care,
To means hard-saved, to be as loosely spent;
But rarely to a higher goal than pelf;
And few on that road ope a wider eye
Than grasps the vision of the trader's self,
Or second self-kith, kin, and progeny.
But on that path this man advancing, felt
he impulse of a great good far away:
Looked up, saw angels, and where others knelt
To grope for gold, he knelt to dream and pray.
Yes-knelt to dream: though bred to trade and toil,
His was the dreamer's rapt and prescient eye:
Thence came the wings that liſted him from soil
Of sordid paths, and raised low aims to high.
He saw Heaven's will by man's contrivance.barred:
Nature's kind pathways betwixt need and need
Gated and fenced; the Almighty purpose marred,
That gave us diverse brains, thews, soils, and seed.
Others, ere him, had seen and º: the wrong,
Hut he the wrong determined to set right:
Weak in all else, in single purpose strong,
With Power, Wealth, Prejudice, he braved the fight.
And won it, and was famous, powerful, great:
But with the triumph laid the truncheon by,
And in the ranks was § to serve the State,
• Poor save in that which riches cannot buy.

rejection" of an admirable Irish drama, extracts from which ſnow send

I will not deny that before writing this play, I had seen the Colleen
Day, The Peep yBawn, and the Gathering of the Clans, (which last was
Scotch, by the bye; but that doesn't matter, as some people thought
it was Irish); nor can I lay claim to a personal knowledge of dialect;

beau idéal of what a cast should be. Imagine, Sir, the dignity of MR. Rogers as the
Lord Lieutenant, a true type of the Englishman. What more touching than the
broken accents of STELLA Colas in the pathetic parts; while MR. Fechtka's mode
of delivery has always sounded to my ears peculiarly Irish.
* These Rapparees don't speak, not because they have nothing to say, but because
the parts would naturally be filled by “Supers,” and a Manager informed me, that
they were so “uncertain in dialogue, that I'd better come at once to my chief
characters,” and so I have. What the *†. would have said, what, in fact,
they did say in my original MS., is now in the mouth of Sweeny-ma-Cowl.
* This is a genuine Irish expression.
* Caubeen. Genuine Irish word. Often heard it.
7 Every one's sure to laugh at the rich humour of these two lines of verse, if the
performer will only wink.
* When does an Irishman most resemble a Scotchman? Why of course when he's
kilt entirely. This might be introduced into the Comic underplot.

A NATURAL OBJECTION.
Mamma. “OH ! Won't You Kiss Your UNCLE, JULEY "
Juley (unused to the Bengal Cavalry Beard). “I Don't Know where, MAMMA 1"
GUIDE TO THE QUACKS OF LONDON.
A SERIEs of papers relative to Quacks, which appeared in the Medical Circular, with the
signature of “DETECTOR,” has been republished in the form of a short pamphlet. The
reader of Punch should read this pamphlet also. He has often read, in the pages of Punch,
of certain Quacks, fraudulent and noisome, who obtain money by false pretences, and more
.# by menaces and extortion, from green young men. For their names, which Punch
would not advertise, he has referred his readers to the lower corner of the advertising columns
of low newspapers, amongst which too many of Mr. Punch's contemporaries, especially
in the country, may still be enumerated. But now he begs to publish the information that
a nominal list of these miscreants, with copies of their puffs and other particulars concernin
them, needful to be known, will be found in the pamphlet above referred to, which is entitle
Revelations of Quacks and Quackery, and is to be had at the Medical Circular Office, 20, King
William Street, Strand, W.C. -
The vile practices, the monstrous impudence, the cruel rapacity, and the enormous gains
of the obscene tribe of Quacks, the mischief they do, the ruin they work, even to the
causation of suicide, are fully set forth in Revelations of Quacks and Quackery. And mark
especially that, as aforesaid, the names of the Quacks are published. The pamphlet in ques-
tion thus constitutes a regular Quack .# º consulting which every young man may
know where he may go if he wishes to get plundered and destroyed.
The Medical Circular has a great advantage over a non-medical Journal in respect to
the exposure of Quacks... An ordinary periodical could not call a Quack a Quack by name, to
say nothing of denouncing him as an extortioner and a scoundrel, without incurring the
danger of an action for #. No difficulty would be experienced by the most notorious
Quack, or gang of Quacks, in finding among the members of an honourable profession, an
attorney º would take their instructions, and a barrister who would plead their cause. A
É. construction of the law of libel on the part of British Judges, and stupidity on that of
ritish jurymen, are not so rare, but that such a fellow as the convict “DR. HENERY” would,
as plaintiff in a libel case, obtain, in compensation of his assailed honour and impugned in-
j: vindictive damages. But no prospect of damages will tempt any Quack to give a
periodical almost restricted to the medical profession the much more damaging effect to himself
of the general publicity which it would gain by a prosecution.
Buy, therefore, reader, by all means buy Revelations of Quacks and Quackery. Its contents
will astonish and amuse you, while they invoke your indignation and disgust. Of course
you do not want it on account of its warnings for your own sake, but you doubtless do for
that of the many simpletons with whom you must be acquainted, if your acquaintance is
large. “Who are the Quacks, that Punch means?” Consider what it is to be able to answer
this question of the º: and inexperienced, and, for charity's sake, if for no other, go and
provide yourself with Revelations of Quacks and Quackery, by Detector.

OZONE.
(By AN UNscIENTIFIc contRIBUTOR.)
TIME was, when to this tune I
Sang of the Turcophone,
Which, as you know, some months ago,
By Ali BEN was blown.
That’s past, and into notice
Another name has grown,
For I’ve read and read,
What the Press has said
Of the quantities of Ozone.
Now tell me what is Ozone?
I cannot make out, Iown,
Is it bitter or sweet?
Is it something to eat?
Oh! do tell me what is Ozone?
There's Coxwell, and there's GLAIsher,
Aéronauts so bold,
Who all for love go up above,
To shiver and shake with cold.
Their letter to the papers
By GLAISHER signed alone,
Says where they’ve been,
And that they’ve seen
A quantity of Ozone.
But he doesn't say what's Ozone?
I cannot make out; I own
That from what I have heard,
1 should say ’twas a bird,
But then why is it called Ozone?
There's MR. HINDE, Astronomer,
Who's nothing else to do,
But sit up at night to take a sight,
And discover a star or two.
But when some Heavenly body
Is not so plainly shown
As it ought to be, “’Tis through,” says he,
“The quantities of Ozone.”
As he doesn't say what’s Ozone,
I rather suspect his tone,
Which leads me to think
It is something to drink, , .
(Thoughtfully), Bº ’ve not heard it called
zone.
I ask the modern doctors,
And on this pipe they drone,
That I should . buried and cemetery'd,
If 'twasn’t for Ozone.
Of course I’m very grateful,
As it saves m #. a groan
That so long I’ve been kept alive
By a course of this same Ozone.
Even Science says, what's Ozone,
As yet, isn't clearly known.
So now I know no more
Than 1 did long before,
I asked you what is Ozone?
Chit-Chat.
“It would not be a difficult matter for Louis
NApoleon to write his Uncle's life,” observed
some one.
“Why not?” we asked.
“Because,” returned our friend, who was
cutting the leaves of Julius Cæsar, “he would
write it as Caesarly as possible.”
When we had recovered, our friend (?) was
gone.

THERE is a Mountebank coming out at the
Lyceum. Several untheatrical people want to
know if this is an institution like a County

able to answer that it is something like a County
Bank, inasmuch as several people * their
money into it; and it is also kept up by a Com-
pany, decidedly limited.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PEG FOR SOME PLEASANT PEGGING.
Touching the squabbles of most persons, and especially the squabbles
of Actors, Musicians, Authors, and Members of Parliament, Mr. Punch
usually preserves the usual lofty and dignified silence. #e writes for
the world, and what does the world care about such dust on its great
wheels? But when his own illustrious name is used in a way which
may induce sº to suppose that he has done an injustice, then he
flames like a fiery furnace. Not, of course, on his own account, for
he heeds such things, as MR. PRAED beautifully says–
“As the Sun regards the clouds that play
Round his radiant path on a summers day.”
But for the sake of the §§ person, whose happiness may be dimmed
by the slightest hint of Mr. Punch's disfavour.
Therefore, only, does Mr. Punch take notice of a paragraph in a
musical journal. Not the Musical World, whose Rabelaisian inscruta-
bilities, though heinously defiant of mundane intellect, are usually of a
genial and kindly sort; but the Orchestra, which is by no means a
journal to be contemned, for if it occasionally carries the mordant habit
to extremes, it appears to avoid the more offensive habit of sickening puff,
which exhausts the wealth of the English language in eulogy on singers
and fiddlers. The Orchestra has, of course unintentionally, utterly
misrepresented Mr. Punch in the following paragraph, in which a con.
tributor is told that he—
“May remember some time ago how Punch proved that the poet ALExANDER
SMITH had taken every single word of his poetry from other authors—even from
MURRAY's Grammar and Johnson's Dictionary.”
Now, Mr. Punch did nothing of the kind; at least in the sense here
attributed to him. He had read a so-called criticism on ALEXANDER
SMITH, who had proved himself a true poet, and who had been spitefully
charged with plagiarisms, of which he was perfectly innocent. The
ridiculous array of proofs, in support of that charge, Mr. Punch certainly
demolished, in his own inimitable way, by showing that the so-called
critic might have adduced evidence that every word in MR. ALEXANDER
SMITH's poems had occurred in somebody else's poems. For, which
vindication of one of the best of her poets, grateful Scotland shouted
her thanks to Mr. Punch, and his larder and cellar have ever since been
filled with haggis, grouse, salmon, cakes, Glasgow magistrates, and
whiskey, remitted carriage free, and with anonymous letters of the most
gratifying description, and with no more quotations from BURNs than
might be expected.
That there never may be any more mistake about what he did for
ALEXANDER SMITH, and that there may be no cessation in the above-
mentioned remittances, he will briefly illustrate, for the benefit of the
st nati, the way in which ºr pinch treated a carping critic. There
is a song of the day called “God Bless the Prince of Wales.” The
words of that song, Mr. Punch must have heard, so far as vocalists
§§ but he has no kind of idea as to what they are. They are by
R. LINLEY, and doubtless are good enough for the purpose. To them,
MR. BRINLEY RICHARDs wedded an exceedingly effective and pleasant
melody, which, with MR. SIMs Reeves's singing, made the song a great
success. It is a sort of national anthem of a provisional kind. Some-
body in the Orchestra, who is envious of MR. BRINLEY RICHARDs's
success, and who should remember that the musical world is wide
. for us all, and that the way to get on is to do something good
oneself, and not to sneer at the good things done by others, has adopted
the same kind of so-called criticism as that demolished by Mr. Punch
and has picked out, from various songs, fragments which it is pretende
make up the loyal air. The allegation is too ludicrous for contradiction.
But as Mr. Punch's awful name has been used, and used unfairly, he
begs to submit, the following specimen of this style of criticism. He
repeats that he has not the slightest idea as to what the words of “God
Bless the Prince of Wales” may be, and he is, therefore, obliged to evolve
them out of his own self consciousness. Suppose this were MR.
LINLEY’s song:—
“From shore to shore the cannons roar,
The kittens wag their tails,
The welkin rings out, less or more,
“O bless the PRINCE OF WALEs l’
All Nature shines both bright and gay,
And fish with glittering scales,
And merry England seems to say,
“O bless the PRINCE OF WALes'
“His mother is our gracious QUEEN,
He lives at Marlborough House,
His eye is bright, his aim is keen,
And fatal to the grouse.
Then send aloft a joyous cry,
While milkmen c their pails,
And let the hills and rocks reply,
Well, there is a supposed song, and, by the way, much in the style of
but a precious deal . than most of the things which are called
"gems of freshness and beauty” and sparkling “fountains of loveliness,”
in the home-manufactured puffs of the music-shops. , Now to criticise
it, as ALEXANDER SMITH and BRINLEY RICHARDs have been criticised:—
Verse 1. From snore to shore.—From the Ettrick Shepherd's “'Tis echoing loud
from shore to shore."
The cannons roar.—From Byron, Childe Harold. “Arm, arm, it is, it is,
the cannon's ope roar."
The kittens.—From the well-known nursery song—
“We're all in the dumps, for diamonds is trumps,
And the kittens are gone to St. Paul's;
The babies are bit, and the moon's in a fit,
And the houses are built without walls."
Wag their tails.-From Shakspeare's Two Gentlemen of Verona, Act ii.
Sc. 5. “My dog " " " will shake his tail.”
The welkin rings out.—From SHAkspeaRE again. Pistol's “Why, let
wetkin roar."
Less or more.—From THAcker. Ay's
“I dare do all that may become a man,
He who dares more is neither more nor less."
From the Common Prayer Book of the Church of England, as by Law
established.
All Nature shines.—From YouNo. “See Nature shine f"
Both bright and gay.—Paraphrase from BILLY TAyloft. “Both cruel
sevel c."
From the Spelling-Book description of the Zodiac.
And merry England.—From the Dunciad (note):-
“In merry Old England it once was the rule
That a king was allowed both his poet and fool.”
Seems.-From Hamlet. “I know not seems.”
To say.—From the Battle of the Books :-
“WAlker, our hat, nor more he deigned to say,
But stern as Ajax's spectre, strode away.”
Stolen from the same sacred source as verse 4.
His mother.—From BYRON :-
“The drowsy camels' bells are tinkling
His mother looked from her lattice high.”
Our gracious Queen.—From the National Anthem.
Stolen, whole, from DE FoE's Journey through England. “He (MARL-
Borough) lives in Marlborough House, which is in every way answer-
able to the grandeur of its master."
Verses 11 and 12. Plagiarised and spoiled from WALTER Scott's description of
Malcolm Graeme :-
“Wain was the bound of dark brown doe
When MALcolm bent his English bow."
Verse 13. Then send.—From WHITE HEAD's play, The Cavalier.
me, and I will spit upon him.”
Aloft.—From DIBDIN. “Toxt is gone aloft.”
wn A joyous cry.—From MooRE. “They hail him with a joyous cry."
Verse 14. While milkmen, &c.—We are disposed to credit this line with a certain
originality, though GAY mentions milkmen, and the “clank of the
sword,” so often alluded to in poetry, may easily have suggested that
of the pail, especially as the sight of a sword often makes, persons
pale, as, notably, JAMEs the First of England and Sixth of Scotland.
Verse 15. Let the Hills.-From the Hebrew bard, DAVID.
And rocks reply.—From FALconeR's Shipwreck :-
“All hands, unmoor " proclaims a boisterous cry,
“All hands, unmoorl" the caverned rocks reply.
Verse 16. See remarks on verses 4 and 8. to which we may add a complaint of
what SHAkspxARE, the poet, calls “damnable iteration."
There ! That is true criticism, and that is what critics have done
unto Alexander SMITH and BāINLEY Richards, and that is what
Mr. Punch hath done unto the critics. Bless them!

HOW LITTLE PUGSBY ENJOYED A PULL AFTER THE BOAT RACE.
PUNCH TO THE ELECTORS OF WESTMINSTER.
GENTLEMEN, AND OTHERs,
giving him no trouble, and putting him to no expense. . . -
Many of you are very respectable persons, and sufficiently well in-
formed on the ordinary º of the day, but I *::::::
not know much about MR. MILL, or why I am justified in issuing a
peremptory order which you cannot disobey, I will condescend to
inform you, for it is the duty of all to instruct the ignorant.
MR. MILL is, like myself, in the full vigour of life, and in the perfect
possession of splendid faculties. He was born in 1806, the year of
another great Mill, that of Maida, in Sicily, when we licked double our
number of French, and made a name for SIR WALTER Scott's dog, and
for Maida Hill, W.
He is the son of JAMEs MILL, the author of the great History
India, and a philosophic writer whose works you would not understand.
I will not trouble you with much about º: sensations con-
Creted by constant conjunction. Enough for you to know that your
candidate's father, one of the finest intellects of any age, himself
educated the gentleman who does you the honour to say that he will
represent you.
. John STUART MILL was placed in the service of the East India
Company, and he rose from rank to rank by the only honourable means,
desert. He wrote admirably for various publications, always in the
interest of the People. He was an Advanced Liberal in days when
that name meant something, and he is an advanced Liberal now, and
knows what he means by fiberalism, namely, the improvement and
elevation of the many.
He is a sound thinker, and an eminently practical man. All his writin
tend to clear your minds from confusion and cant, to show you exactly
what you want, and how you are to get it.
fie was the friend and editor of the Great BENTHAM, and a fellow-
labourer with SIR WILLIAM MoLEsworth. His Political Economy is
of the largest and wisest kind. You might as well try to put your
Abbey into your St. Paul's, Covent Garden, as try to humbug him on
any subject whatever. I should like to see the most adroit Minister or
Parliament man attempt it.
You will be good enough to elect MR. John STUART MILL, #
that you do | 6
In º relation of life Mr. MILL is the example which might be
expected.
herefore, intelligent men, you perceive that when MR. MILL consents
to represent Westminster, he confers an honour and a favour upon you.
e will make Westminster a great Power in the House of Commons.
You will at once signify, unmistakeably, that no other candidate need
trouble, himself to come forward. As for young MR. GRosvenoR's
eing allowed to stand, under the circumstances, it is as if a benefit were
to be given at one of your theatres, and MR. MAGREApy should offer to
come forth and play Macbeth, but the Managers should insist in putting
MR. Toole into that character.
Elect John STUART Mill, and believe me,
Gentlemen and Others, -
The People's Old and Faithful Friend,
And Fearless Adviser,
49&NGIT!.
85, Fleet Street, April 12, 1865.

And each local rate, that waxes

Most of all that did betide us,
Comfort and repose denied us,
And unsettled our affairs,
Were the constantly accruing,
Each on other fast ensuing,
Endless jobs that wanted doing;
Alterations and repairs.
Smelling drain, or chimney smoking, .
Damp, through this or that wall soaking,
How ...}} provoking!
Water-pipe or boiler burst;
Ironmonger, painter, plumber,
Carpenter, with noise and lumber
Pained our eyes and broke our slumber:
But the bricklayers were the worst.
Knocking, hammering, bricks and mortar,
Through long days that we wished shorter,
Rubbish, dust, in every quarter
Were the torment of our souls;
Scaffolding our home surrounded,
Hodmen's, plasterers' shouts resounded,
Like strange demons, in confounded
Babel, while they clomb the poles.
O that we could build, like turtles,
In the cedars, or the myrtles,
With the foliage to avertills
From our snug and quiet nest,
Which would never want repairing:

We, domestic pleasures sharing,
Might enjoy our home in rest.

TIHE PERIS OF PARIS.
SURELY Paris is a Paradise for the daughters of Eve, if not for the
sons of ADAM. The correspondent of the Post at that capital thus
writes:–
“A gentleman took us into a milliner's shop in the Rue de la Paix this week to
see a ball-dress which cost 25,000 francs (£1,000).

when worn in society.”
A married lady's evening dress in our da
rally costs from £80 to £100, and is so contrived that it must of necessity
It appears the voluminous lace
gene-
torn
There, girls, you whom limited circumstances oblige to content your-
selves with an occasional purchase of a linsey or a winsey, an alpaca, a
§ a mohair, or a tarlatan for evening wear, what think you of the
elicity of wearing ball-dresses costing a thousand pounds a-piece
Might one not imagine that such dresses are trimmed with bank-notes?
Hear what the interesting, writer above quoted further says about the
blest existence of the lovely Parisian ladies:–
“Are we coming to some golden age when a blind Plutus enables every one to
live in splendid apartments crowded with costly Louis the Fourteenth furniture,
occupied by lovely women who spend, if moderate, £1000 per annum on dress;
horses and carriages awaiting below—the very best horseflesh England can produce.
How is all this done?"
Great, indeed, must be the moderation shown by these beauties if
when a single ball-dress can cost as much as £1,000, they are satisfie
with spending no more than that sum on the wardrobe of a whole year.
But you, sweet girls, would perhaps deem it the height of happiness to
be enabled to rejoice in apparel to the amount of even that compara-
tively moderate § There is happiness for you—to envy . No, to
regard with that delight which the amiable ever take in the enjoyment
which others experience and they themselves don't... You can contem-
plate, with sympathetic pleasure, the blessedness which those fair beings
realise. . .You derive agentle. gratification from imagining the employ-
ment which they give to milliners, whilst you are occupied, like indus-
trious ducks, in making up your own dresses, whose materials º:
cost little more than two pounds altogether. On the other hand, these
Peris of the Parisian Paradise, if they have any imagination at all, may
sometimes, for amusement, imagine themselves at work with the needle,
and the sewing-machine, in the manufacture of their own clothes.
When you are told that the sumptuous French Peris have the very
best horseflesh that England can produce, waiting below, you may have
reason to suppose that some of it waits on the table. The lords of
some of those ladies may belong to the Société Hippophagique, and be
accustomed to feast them occasionally on such meat as Blair Athol, at
£100 a steak. For they, you know, must needs be dear creatures,
but you, my dears, are much dearer. They may suit the means of a
French billionnaire, but you are the lasses for an Englishman's
money.

THE NEGRO'S PLACE IN NATURE.
(To the Ethnological Society)
SAGEs of that zetetic band
Who, with discussion free,
Which few Societies will stand,
Pursue Ethnology;
You have been looking up of late.
Last week you had a grand debate
About the Negro's place
In Nature, if he is, indeed,
A man and brother, or of breed
Below our nobler race.
The Negro's wool, the Negro's skin,
The Negro's nose and jaw,
The Negro's heel, the Negro's shin,
Are data whence you draw
Your inferences pro and con,
That QUASHEE is, or not, as John.
His facial angle, too,
You measure, nor those odours fail
To note, which Negroes all exhale,
But not all black men do.

As Punch doth worlds amuse,
Of Ape or Angel, is your own.
Qh, tell us which you choose!

To cherubs or the chimpanzee?

Have we rich relatives, who soar
Bright seraphim, or have we poor
In the orang-outangs?

Comparatively scan.
What kin is that anthropoid ape
To that pithecoid man?

Our cousin some degrees removed;
If none, with fellow men

With Michael, GABRIEL, RAPHAEL, and
Accordingly with BEN.
A COMPULSORY FAST-DAY.
WHAT a pity it is that earnest Clergymen, who wish the British
Public to spend the whole of Sunday and the other festivals of the
Church in religious exercises, do not endeavour to persuade them to do
so by the cultivation of pulpit eloquence, instead of by attempting to
take measures to deprive them of the means of following their own
inclinations towards diversion!. A paragraph in a contemporary, headed
“Observance of Good Friday,” states that, at a Meeting of the Qlergy
of the rural deanery of Canterbury, held a few days since, a resolution
was adopted for the presentation of an address to the directors of the
South-Eastern, and London, Chatham, and Dover Railway companies
requesting them “to take into consideration the service the would
confer on religion by ceasing to run Excursion Trains on Good Fridays.”
There is too much reason to fear that the gentlemen thus requested to
deprive not only themselves, but also their constituents, of the most
profitable day's business in the whole year did not receive the invitation
to º that sacrifice of dividends with all the respect which the
calling, and perhaps the motives, of their reverend memorialists de-
served. Among Railway Directors there are not only gentlemen of the
Hebrew persuasion, but also Members of the Society of Friends, and
other dissenting Christians, who, on the ground of objecting to what
they deem a superstitious observance of days, refuse to observe Good
Friday. All these gentlemen might be likely to make the great mistake
of resenting the solicitation to stop their excursion trains on that holi-
day, as a piece of impertinence. -
If, however, the Directors appealed to by a section of Church of
England Clergymen with a request to forego their own gains, and
§. the means of º from the community at º
were to return those divines a suitably respectful answer, they woul
perhaps reply, that they had taken into consideration the service they
woul ...; on religion by ceasing to run Excursion Trains on Good
Tridays, and on consideration, were convinced that they should not
confer any. They might proceed to point out to their Reverences that
#. are not driven into Church by being shut out of the Crystal
alace, or debarred of Excursion Trains; and, they might add, the
certain result of exclusion from sober enjoyment would be that of
driving them into the public-house. . . .
There is something peculiarly clerical in the argument whereon the
clergy of the rural deanery of Canterbury, to the number of twenty-one
out of twenty-three, rested their vocation to ask the Directors to stop
Good Friday excursion trains. They stated “that they were aware the
working classes require recreation, but Good Friday is the one day in
the year which presents distinctive and peculiar features for religious
observance.” Why, so does Christmas Day. So does every Sunday,
according to the Sabbatarians, whether Churchmen or Dissenters. If
the pious desires of all the sanctified persons who want to impose their
own way of observing Sundays and holidays upon other people, were
fºliº , the working classes would pretty soon have no recreation
at all. -
The Clergy of the rural deanery of Canterbury will perhaps be recom-
mended by the Railway Directors, with whose business they have
attempted to interfere, to confine themselves in future to their own
F. the province of Canterbury, and not to travel out of it into
he province of cant.
ho are the two º out of twenty-three who signalised their
ood sense by refusing their signatures to the memorial against
§: excursion trains?, Their names should be known to discerning
#. with large Church º at their disposal, and admiring
reedom from assumption, folly, and hypocrisy. We may suppose that
those two parsons are wise men.
Is the University Boat Race a Myth?
The Bishop or NUMBERs presents his compliments to Mr. Punch,
and wishes to know if the University Boat Race ever took place. He
has heard much about the “Oxford Eight,” but as all the latest ac-
counts show conclusively that there must have been nine men in it, he
is obliged to conclude, that there never was such a thing as the “ Oxford
#. ’ and consequently, that the Boat Race could never have taken
place.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BALLAD MINSTRELSY.
ow nonsensically
absurd are the
greater number
of drawing-room
ballads ! Take
the following
specimens, for
instance, ex-
tracted at ran-
dom from Ro-
BERT Cocks &
Co.'s Green Ca-
talogue :—
“A Lovely Lass: on
Volubility of
Performance.
-N º - * II"hen the Heart
~º --- A- - º : of a Man: on
- -- - - Passing the
Thumb."
** Tom Boncline : on
Turns and
Shakes.”
That a lovely
lass is likely to
be an excellent
authority on vo-
lubility of per-
formance, we
- are prepared to
admit; but is the fact that she is so a reason for writing a ballad about it? As to the second
song, it is simply an anatomical º When does the heart of a man pass his thumb?
This ballad is useful, however, as an illustration of the shifts to which a fifth-rate poet is
sometimes driven for a rhyme. Probably the author (whoever he was) wanted a rhyme to
“come,” and accordingly dragged in “thumb” neck-and-crop, without paying º regard
to the question whether there was room for it. Again, what could ToM Bowline have had
to do with “turns and shakes P” All the brave fellow could have known about “turns”
must have been derived from seeing his enemies accomplish them; and as to “shakes,” beyond
a shake or two of the foretopsail now and then, he probably knew no more about them than
of volubility of tongue; and “bells,” whether
with one e or with two, are usually proficients in
that accomplishment. Probably, ºff, of

doesn't, we give it up. Then comes—
“We'll gang nae mair to yon Town : on the Use of
the Pedals."
No doubt a clumsy, Scotch way of saying that
next time they go, they won't walk. A little
lower down is—
“Oh, whistle and 1'll come to you, my lad: on Delicacy.”
This we think can be explained. “On deli-
cacy” is an Irishism for “indelicacy,” and it
is probably a private note by a right-thinking
Irish editor, which has been printed by mistake.
But what was Messrs. Cocks & Co.'s reader
about?
The following is probably a pugilistic ode:–
“The Mill, the Mill, 0.1 on various useful passages."
Aghastly motif is suggested by the subjoined:—
* Early one Morning : on rapid and brilliant
Execution.”
The taste which suggests the publication of
such ribaldry cannot be too severely reprehended.
Here is a song which curiously illustrates the
carelessness of the Irish character:—
“Nora's Purse : on a natural and graceful style.”
Nobody but an Irish man or woman would have
been so careless as to leave a purse in such an
exposed situation. Catch a Scotchman doing
so | Then we have—
“Peggy Bawn: on Skips."
We give this up. . - -
A stern moral lesson is read in the next line:–
“A Rejected Lover: on Velocity."
He has been unable to give up his old habits
the Nelson Column itself.
A little further on is the following idiotic drivel:-
“When I followed a Lass: on Octaves and Skips.”
Another rhyming emergency: “skips” introduced, no doubt, to rhyme with “lips.” Then
we come to such nonsense as this:–
“The Blue Bells of Scotland: for the Acquirement of Volubility of Finger.”
We have, of course, heard
We are not quite clear as to what “volubility of finger” is.
of dissipation (notwithstanding that, he has
Pºlº his love), and he has been found out !
ne, more quotation, which we will not attempt
to criticise:–
“The pretty Maid milking a Cow : in the style of a
Romance.”
Really, music-publishers of position should be
careful how they peril their professional standing
by publishing such abject monsense ?
THE CARTOONS.
The Cartoons are likely to be removed to London. Hampton is in
a most unhappy frame of mind, and as much cut up as RAFFAELLE's
great works once were. Kingston is the picture of despair. Kew
means to consult a Q.C., and at Teddington things have come to a
deadlock. The “Twitnam.” folks complain that people are already
twitting 'em. The Palace is in a maze. A Court mourning is expected.
Not content, like “great ANNA,” to “counsel take,” Hampton
retained an ex-Chancellor to plead her cause before his Peers. He
seems to have been assisted by other noble personages, for there was
more than one Count in the indictment he preferred. |First, the gates
had been carried off, the gates “that it must have been a great satis-
faction to the thousands of the working classes who visited Hampton
Court to see.” The recital of this sad story almost “drew iron tears
down SUGDEN's cheek.” But were these gates such a comfort to the
London mechanic out for his Sunday holiday ? Did all his enjoyment
hinge upon them? Did he do nothing but draw them, study them
admire them, until they wrought in him a determination to forge a-he
and rival their producer, HUNTINGTON SHAw, the clever Nottingham
blacksmith ? Was there not metal more attractive in the other glories
of the Palace P This must have been said ironically.
“The naked empty pedestals” were the next thing on which Lond
St. LEONARDs based a grievance. As the statues appear to have been
removed some forty or fifty years ago, Hampton must now, after half
a century of stony grief, be pretty well hardened. LoRD GRANVILLE,
however, allayed the anxiety of the House by an assurance that it
should be CowPER's Task to see that things no longer remained in
statu quo.
But the worst woe of all was the threatened departure of those
Cartoons which “hundreds and thousands of people went down to see.”
I}o they There is a secret belief, that . go down to bewilder
themselves in the maze and play at kiss-in-the-ring, to gad after the
“gadding vine,” to enjoy (like sensible people) the turf and the trees
the chesnuts and the flowers, to feed the gold and silver fish, an
refresh themselves with sandwiches and beer. It is whispered that
of all the thousand and odd pictures that will still be left in the Palace,
the “hundreds and thousands” care far more for The Grecian Daughter
and the great gun of the collection, A Child Discharging a small Cannon,
than for RAFFAELLE treasures and ANDREA MANTEGNA “triumphs.”
But, says the voice from Boyle Farm, “No foreigner ever came to
London without visiting Hampton Court, and when he got in sight of
the Palace, his first question always was, Where are the Cartoons?’”
A fact. No sooner does the “foreigner” arrive at the South-Eastern
terminus than, fresh from the ocean, and without even changing his
collar, he jumps into a Hansom, and drives straight away to Hampton
Court, and when he gets in sight of the Palace gesticulates to Cabby
to reveal to him where the Cartoons are.
Perhaps the “foreigner” will not object to a shorter and less ex-
K. ride, and be quite as well satisfied to see the Cartoons at South
ensington as at Hampton Court. At all events the Englishman may
be expected to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement. Can there be a
doubt that in London the Cartoons will be better hung, better lighted,
and, therefore, better seen? Hampton will not have one visitor the less
through their absence, South Kensington will have many more from
their presence.
After being lodged in Palaces and thrust into cellars, after finding a
friend in Charles and a “Protector” in CROMwell, the Cartoons
will not experience their worst vicissitude in being displayed in one of
the Galleries of the South Kensington Museum. Hampton need not
harass herself about the loss of these marvellous tapestry designs. She
has still her many “Beauties,” and so long as summers gladden and
chesnuts blossom, must ever keep open house for thousands of happy
guests. Her courtiers are such as never tire of their homage, her train
will always be in waiting. May her laurels be evergreen, may her yews
never be used up !

NATURE'S REVENGE AGAINST BIRD-MURDER.
(To Members of the Susser Sparrow Clubs.)
Boobies, Read, as many of you as can, this extract from the
Gateshead Observer:—
“BIRD MURDER —The President of the Naturalists' Field Club (the Rev. G. C.
Abbs) stated on Thursday, at the Anniversary Meeting of the Club, that he had
been calculating the number of caterpillars which the 6,000 sparrows killed by a
member of the “Sparrow-Club’ in Essex, and for which he had actually received a
prize of 10s., would have eaten. The amount was 6,307,000,000. While the clod-
hoppers of Sussex are killing sparrows by the thousand, the Australian colonists
are importing them at a considerable expense from England, to act the part of
protectors of the crops, and thereby of promoters of the comforts of the people.”
Bird-murderers of Sussex, behold the folly of your Essex brethren.
Essex is a county of which the inhabitants, not without reason
afforded by some of them, are derisively called calves. The member of
the Sparrow.club in Essex who killed 6,000 sparrows, that would have
destroyed 6,307,000,000 caterpillars, might well be called an Essex calf
of the first magnitude, if it were not better to call him a great ass.
You, and such as you, have procured for the people of your county the
denomination of Sussex boars; and the obstimacy with which you
persist in trying to exterminate the useful little birds, is peculiarly
swinish. In thus running counter to the teaching of naturalists, see
how enormously you injure your own interests. So the pig swims

THE FETICHE COMPANY (LIMITED).
HERE was a Meeting of
Capitalists and others in-
terested in the promotion of
the Society in course of
formation under , the above
title, held ºsterday at their
rooms in Ali ate. The Chair
was taken by MR. MAM-
MONS.
The CHAIRMAN said it was
in contemplation to form a
Joint-stock Association on
the principle of limited liabi-
lity, with the view of creating
what there was every reason
to believe would prove a
highly profitable concern.
The branch of Commerce
which it would be the aim of
this Company to develop
would be the traffic in objects
of worship with the various
tribes of savages who prac-
tised the religion called
fetichism. Something, he
believed, had been done in
the same way by some houses
at Birmingham, but the
- - Society contemplated alarger
scale of operations... Our Indian Empire offered an unbounded field for
the cultivation of this line º: of the natives who adored deities
coming under the description of hardware. The same goods—or gods
—might be manufactured for the Fiji market with a certainty of remu-
neration. A splendid, prospect for enterprise in the idol trade was
opened up , by the late discoveries of DR. LIVINGstone, CAPTAIN
BURTON and others in the interior of Africa, where an abundant harvest
might be reaped notwithstanding the exertions of the Missionaries.
MR. PELFER said that most attempts to convert savages were
failures. The natives would worship logs and stones, and other material
objects, the supply of which, in the shape of manufactures, was as
legitimate a branch of business as any other, that of dealing, for
instance, in gunpowder and instruments of destruction.
MR. TINKEY, with reference to the amount of capital which might
be required for the undertaking, inquired if the manufacture of the
objects destined for indigenous worship would be expensive. Would
they consist of dolls P
The GhaſhMAN said that fetiches were adopted by the lowest savages
from all sorts of objects, animate and inanimate. With this fact in
view, figures of toads, º lizards, snakes, cats and dogs, and other
forms of animals would be fashioned, as well as human, vegetable or
mineral forms, to suit the fancy of expected customers.
MR. DIBBINs suggested that mechanisms capable of being set in
motion, introduced among the native races as objects of adoration,
would be soon inquired for.
The CHAIRMAN said they would probably go down—that is, look up—
among natives of superior intelligence.
MR. DIBBINs thought that, for example, a good stroke of business
might be done with small mechanicaſſetºnes worked by steam.
The CHAIRMAN, in reply, observed that such scientific fetiches as
those would be expensive, and too good for barbarians, on whom the
wonders of mechanism would be thrown away. It was like, as some-
body or other had said, “casting pearls before swine.” A very high
state of civilisation—a degree of civilisation and enlightenment as ad-
#. as our own—was requisite to enable people to worship the Steam-
gine.
The terms of a Prospectus of the proposed. Fetiche Com * Were
the pro-
then settled, and a vote of thanks to the Chairman close
ceedings.
MR. JOHN THOMAS AT THE BOAT RACE.
THIs comes hopping, my dear Punch, as it may find U in good ealth,
Which without it there’s no benefit in wittles or in wealth.
R! I'd reether be a Popper, and be 'earty, ale and strong,
Than a CREESEs with the toothache or the eadache all day long;
For º gets no wenson in the workouse, nor no wine,
You couldnt with the toothache enjoy them when you dine:
And tho there aint no baccy allowed for workis foke,
A.C.REESEs with the eadache E can't enjy his smoke
Which the chicest of Have Annas aint §no good when you're ill,
Cos when you'd like to take a pipe, you ave to take a pill.
But talkink of good ealth, my Iſ U should have gone with me
The Boat Race of the Cantabs and Hoxoniums ºf
The mussels them º fellers ad, you wouldn't scarce believe,
it sweiled out on their shoulders like a fashimabble sleeve.
Their harms were like a Blacksmith's, only praps a trifle whiter,
And their bax as broad as BENDIGo's, the celebrated fiter.
They wore their trowsers turned up short, to ease M as they rode,
And made us footmen henvious to see what Calves they shodeſ
But tho they wayed 12 stun apiece, there werent a hounce of Phat,
For their Calves was sollid muscle, which ours aven’t much of that.
I’m told for months before the match they lived upon roar beef,
Which their meals must get monottinous, leastways in my belief:
And to live in independence of a kitchen or a kook
Is a kannibal existence as wouldn't suit my book.
So you wont catch me a trainink and a givink hup my dinner,
Besides, my calves is delicate, and work wood make them thinner.
Homy! to see the River, it were reelly like a Phair,
Only neither booths nor beastshows nor gilt fººd was there.
But eaps of boats was on it, of every size and sawt,
From them as roes for prizes to them as roes for spawt:
Which not being Hamphibious, and wishing to keep dry,
Let others try to sit in them there wagerboats, says I.
They’re as thin as any wafer, and but 18 hinches wide,
So a man of º. he could ardly sit inside:
And men like MR. BANTING, as are bulky in their figger,
Could never ave the luxury to row in a houtrigger!
Then there was eaps of steamers a follerink †s,
And the gents all had blue ribbings a dawning of their coats:
The Cambridge they were light blue, for their crew were lighter men,
Tho their earts was doubtless eavy at their being beat agen.
Hour ladies being Hoxford they wore dark blue in their air,
Which ladies of the ighest rank and phashion they were there:
And they all ad on the ribbings of the boat they oped would beat,
And some they wore blue parrysoles to shade M from the eat:
Hand some ad a blue bonnet, or a blue shorl, or blue dress,
But there was few Blue Stockings, so leastways I shood guess. -
Miss KATE she showed both colours, for to please em both she tries,
The dark blue in her ribbings, and the light blue in her eyes:
And ho! to see em sparkle when she eard that Hoxford won,
Twas like the skies a shining with the radiance of the sun
Says I unto our Coachman, which upon the bocks I sat,
And we'd each a dark blue favour as Miss KATE made for our at,
Says I, some Hoxford feller have been saying somethink sweet.
Says £, hit's that young º as she met in Grosvenor Street: .
But, says I, them kolledge Fellers they can’t marry, I’ve heard said,
Says E, i'd leave any fellership and take Miss KATE instaid,
For I’m sure there aint no kolledge as can offer such a prize,
And what’s looking into blue . to a look in her blue eyes |
Says I, men dont read blue books, exceptin they're MP's,
§§ their wives they reads the Red book with their breakfastes and T’s.
Has thus we were conwersing, such a crowd on orseback shode 1
For some rode on the river hand some rowed on the road.
Twere hallmost like the Derby Day, there was such eaps of mags,
And Snobs they druw their donkey-carts and Nobs they druw their drags.
My complexion suffered horſil from the sunshine and the dust,
And Rº, we hadnt nothink to relieve us from our thust.
But as they come a galloping, a trotting and a prancing,
The shouting and the ollering it set our orses dancing,
And fearink of a haccident we would have druw away,
But Miss KATE she wouldent ear of it and bade us for to stay:
Get down, she says, and old their eads; which if I mite persoom
I answers sotty vochy, a Phootman aint a groom.
But thinking it might save er life to do as I were told,
I went at wunce and did it, like a Ero brave and bold.
Which to stand afore 2 orses a F. and a prancing,
I, found it reether diphicult to keep em from advancing:
Heach momink I expected they’d be trampling on my toes,
And the haggerny I suffered at that prawspick goodness nose!
R! every time they give a prance, it set my Art a beating,
And it set my cheeks a flaming, for such exercise is eating.
But bold as any Buffalo I ſumſ, stood my ground,
Hattracting hadmiration from all the ladies round:
Which if there is a man on earth who's their devoted slavey,
It is your umble servink John ToMMUs Hof BELGRAvey.

BURKING IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.
In the French Chamber of Deputies, the other day, M., GušRogIt had the
audacity to make a speech, occupying several columns of the Moniteur, on and
against the progress of Ultramontanism, or, as the vulgar say Popery, in France.
M. GuéRouit vexed the faithful portion of his audience, devoted to the Holy See,
by reading a catalogue of the principal religious orders, that occupy themselves in
inculcating loyalty to Pope Pius, on the subjects of the EMPERQR NAPQI.E.ON,
He was very properly interrupted by frequent cries of “Asse: / Assee " and
during the remainder of his address the representatives of the good Jesuits
made strenuous endeavours to put him down by clamour...To these logical confu.
tations M. GuéRoult could give no better answer than the following—which, in
fact, he gave :-
“Permettez, messieurs, laissez-moi continuer ma discussion, car il me serait impossible de
suivre mes idées si jetais toujours interrompu.”
Why, of course. Wherein lies the main force of the argument resorted to
by M. Guéroult's opponents, but in that very damaging effect, on a speaker's
self-possession ? This unanswerable method, of controversy, has the further
advantage of stopping the man in the middle of his sentence, and thus preventing
him from giving, in its conclusion, the explanation required to elucidate its com
mencement. And, finally, it is so civil

The Morning Post, informs us that the Duchess of SoMERSET gave the last

Admirally, in Whitehall. Our fashionable Contemporary adds, that Coote AND
TINNey's band attended, and during the evening played, for the first time, the
Lara False,” arranged by MR. Coote, but does not mention anything abºut a
dance which would have been more particularly suitable to the residence of the
First Lord of the Admiralty, namely, the Sailor's Hornpipe.
THE TRANSIT OF TATTERSALL’S,
Good bye, old Corner, where so long
Turf swells have loved to band,
Since first old TATT his broad-brimmed hat
Showed in the well-known stand.
Where, ninety years of hopes and fears,
And nine to back of that,
The †. swell with mags to sell
Still found a Tit for TAtt.
How High-flyer raised TATTERSALI's
The House's annals show;
Since then how many a High-flyer
Has TATTERSALL’s brought low !
We boast the lengthened run that now
Awaits a favourite play;
But from those steps a century
Had looked at “ Settling Day!”
If walls have ears, what startling tales
Those old rooms must have heard:
What sermons they might preach, the stones
That paved that old court-yard'
Where o'er the pump (an emblem meet
Of some that graced the ground,)
he Fourth GeoRGE from ambrosial curls
Beamed forth “Deportment” round.
By those oak-pales the first Oaks' stakes
Were put down long ago:
Germ of that Epsom growth that now
All ring-fence doth outgrow.
There the first Derby favourite
Was measured by the yard :
And there a century's Sellengers
Fortunes have made or marred.
Till the world grew so fond of “books,
So giv'n to make the same
That the old ground too small was found,
For the Turf’s “little game; ”
As from his Grosvenor Place old TAtt"
Started to win life's race,
Young TATT, on fortune bent, again
Takes flight from Grosvenor Place.
At jº. lo, a fair glass roof
stands for the dark old sheds:
We’ve tiles as shiny 'neath our feet,
As those upon our heads:
But still we love the haunts where first
The Turf's keen breath we drew;
And what recalls those ancient halls
We best love in the new-
The old brown fox, that from his box
Still peers with artful face,
A hint that to the sharp as well
As swift, is given the race.
We miss the verdant lawn, where paced
Crowds of green men and still:
The gravelled walk, which losers oft
More gravelled, used to fill:
And sadder loss than all—no more
The old cow crops the lawn:
Meek monitor of draughts to come
From milch-cows yet undrawn |
Goodbye, old yard, and may the new
As long its honours wear; -
And though they leave the Corner still,
May TAtts be on the Square'
• Old Tatt's fortunes began with his leaving EARL Grosv ENor, to

THE AMERICAN NEWS.
ALL our regular political writers have gone out of Town for the
Easter Holidays. But on receiving the important news which arrived on
Saturday from America, and considering that a political leader was re-
quired from us, we sent to a smart young penny-a-liner, informing him
that Richmond and Petersburg had fallen, and desiring him to supply
an article. We obtained in reply the following performance, which we
print, partly because we have got nothing else, and partly to shame the
writer, who doubtless considers himself a person of average, or even
higher intelligence.
3p'HNUIH.
LEADING ARTICLE.
“Extraordinary news has just arrived. “Richmond and Petersburg
have fallen.”. Such tidings do not come every day. All surprises are
unexpected, but this is the most unexpected surprise we ever had.
That two important cities in different parts of the world should fall
down at once, is truly strange, but that the news should come to us
across the Atlantic ocean is one of those coincidences which make us
say, with HQMER, that there is indeed nothing new under the Sun. As
regards the fall of Richmond, we are too grieved to be able to give vent
tº our emotions. That town, pleasingly situate on the banks of the
Thames, is connected with too many holiday associations for us to hear
of its fall without regret. We recal luxurious dinners at the Gar and
§. charming walks in the Park, of which Pope might have
Written–
“Thy forests, Windsor, and thy green retrea
Are full of monarchs and of gentlemen's seats.”
And we cannot forbear a tribute to the excellent driving of the flymen
who rattled in such ºf fashion from the hotels to the commodious
station. All is gone, and Richmond has fallen. Ilet us only add, in
the beautiful º: of funereal heraldry, Resurgam. But if the fall
of a third-rate town be a misfortune, what shall we say of the fall of the
capital of Russia? The proud metropolis built by the haughty but
profligate CATHERINE for her son PETER THE GREAT, and reflected in
the blue waters of the Vistula, has also gone down, and consternation
is spread over the dominions of the Autograph. Lisbon was once
destroyed by an earthquake, and with the addition of a slight pelisse,
Madrid's and Petersburg's climes are of a piece, remarkable words by
LoRD BYRON, which have now received an extraordinary illustration.
Such poetical reminiscences crowd upon our mind at an exciting
moment like this, and readers will feel with us, while we are º;
that St. Petersburg has fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen from its high
estate, and welters in the tide. Necessarily hurried as are our
remarks, they are written in the excitement of the moment, and we
shall return to the subject when we are favoured with further par-
ticulars. In the absence of these, it would be premature to speculate
upon the causes which have produced these afflicting catastrophes; but
as regards Richmond it may not be impossible that the enormous
excavations which have been made for the cellars of the new and grand
hotel near the Park Gates may have brought down the entire town
into the abyss. The fall of Petersburg is more inexplicable, but it is
built upon piles, and it is possible that the extreme dryness of the late
weather may have produced dry-rot in those supports, which it must
now be matter of regret were not fortified by some chemical process of
a vulcanising character. But it were ungenerous to reproach a nation
at a moment of disaster, and we would rather say that as Augustus
found Rome of marble and left it of brick, so ALEXANDER may find
Petersburg in ruins, and leave it in the course of architectural re-con-
struction.
We will only add, esto perpetual, and without pointing a moral, or
adorning a tale, will leave the remarkable news to the consideration of
our readers until further notice.

A CANDIDATEPS CATECHISM.
Much difficulty and embarrassment being occasioned to Candidates
at elections by the extremely inconvenient, not to say, impertinent
habit of asking them questions, Mr. Punch has P. the following
Catechism, which he recommends to the study of gentlemen aspiring to
represent, their fellow subjects. The speeches are supposed to have
been made, the usual non-electoral contributions of cats, eggs, and
brickbats to have been duly forwarded, and the Candidate advances
º, yet smilingly, to answer any question which may be proposed
to him.
CATECHISM.
Elector. Leave off grinning, and answer this. What will you do
about Church Rates ?
Candidate. I answer frankly, that while I should regret to see the
beautiful and venerable edifices erected by the piety of our forefathers
falling into decay, I should desire that the means of supporting them
might be provided in the way least calculated to produce dissension.
%lector. What about the Game Laws?
Candidate. I should be ashamed of myself did I hesitate to say that
though field sports have great, advantage in, promoting manliness of
character and residence on estates, I would not willingly purchase
those ºutage. by the aid of enactments which I should not consider
equitable.
Elector. Will you go in for the Ballot?
Candidate. I solemnly pledge myself to support any arrangement,
which in the opinion of those who are best qualified to decide, may
most effectually conduce to the protection of the voter, and to the
eliciting the real opinion of the nation.
Elector. Will you turn the º out of the House of Lords?
Candidate. I thank you sincerely for giving me an opportunity of
saying, that while profoundly attached to the Church of England, I will
never be party to any system which appears to me to confer too much
political power upon our hierarchy. -
Elector. Will you support direct taxation?
Candidate. Having studied fiscal subjects during my whole life, I am
able instantly and unhesitatingly to reply that the adjustment of the
burdens which may be necessary for the maintenance of national honour
requires the utmost attention from any man deserving the name of a
British Statesman.
Elector. What are your views on Parliamentary Reform P
Candidate. Most determined and definite. I hold that the British
Constitution, like that of the human being, requires from time to time
all the ameliorating influences which can be brought to bear upon it,
in accordance with the lights of experience and the dictates of wisdom.
Elector. Will you knock off pensions?
Candidate. Most assuredly, wherever I am convinced that the pension
is undeserved, and that its withdrawal will not cause a larger amount of
private distress than would be compensated for by the increase of
public happiness. -
Elector. What about flogging in the Army and Navy P
Candidate. Can you ask me, or suppose that I would give my support
to any system which is º: to the instincts of humanity ? That
the exigences of the military and naval service may demand special
punishments I may not be prepared to deny, but I am still more ready
to declare my intense repugnance to all unnecessary severity.
Elector. Would you abolish primogeniture?
Candidate. While in the most good-natured spirit I respectfully
suggest that the topic can have little practical bearing on the interests
of the gentleman who addresses me, I respond that I must see ver
strong, reasons before I can support any artificial arrangement º;
is not based upon apparent and natural justice.
Elector. Are you for Manhood Suffrage?
Candidate. My intense and almost awful respect for my fellow man
makes me hesitate to say that I will consent to make him the subject
of any legislation whatever, but be assured that I will give my
ºlia support to any policy tending to preserve all the rights of
a tyrlton.
Elector. Would you repeal the Malt Tax P
Candidate. It is the dearest wish of my heart that every man in
England should be able to procure the beverage which will do him most
ood, and I will vote through thick and thin for the sake of providing
É. with an ample supply of that beverage. I think that my reply
goes even further than my questioner intended.
Elector. What will you do for this borough
Candidate. Everything that is consistent with patriotic regard for the
general interests of the nation, and I am sure that as a man and an
Englishman you would desire no more.
Elector. Will you vote for war with Austria P (or as the case
may be.)
Candidate, I am sure that the question, though an insult, is an
unintentional one, and I therefore, rather in sorrow than in anger, ask
the electors. of this intelligent borough what they have seen in me to
justify a belief that when the British lion intends a spring, I should
attempt to paralyse its energy, or affix the chain of cowardice around
its majestic mane. - - -
feel that your sympathies are on my side, and I rejoice to believe that
my replies have ensured your approbation.
Gentlemen, the demand almost unmans me, but l
All the Electors and Non-Electors. Pelt the beggar.
A LOVE LAMENT,
IN TWO SPASMS.
FOUNDED UPON FICTION
SPASM I.
A BUTCHER, in the prime of life,
I wanted nothing but a wife,
And in Miss Bullock fondly thought
I'd found the helpmate that I sought:
Qx-eyed, but gentle as a lamb,
With jointure snug from UNCLE SAM,
A buxom º with shapely waist
A spare-rib would not suit my taste),
f ready tongue and brains to match,
Admirers wooed her by the batch.
The Baker headed once the roll,
But lost his chance, the crusty soul;
The Brewer broached the subject next,
“Too stout,” she thought—old HALE was vext;
The Grocer figg’d out in his best,
With citron gloves and spicy vest,
Too candi(e)d man, allowed that he
With sugaréd words had sought Miss B.
The Chandler praised her taper form,
And owned his looks were waxing warm;
The Miller—why prolong the list—
Soon got the sack, and was dismissed;
His bran new suit assumed in vain,
He ground his teeth and groaned again.
Indeed, with no desire to boast,
It seemed that I might rule the roast:
Her father gave me many a hint—
He kept “The lamb,” and served the Mint—
That I was i. the sort of man
He fancied for his MARY ANN;
Her mother saw good traits in me,
Appeased, I own, by bribery—
A sweetbread now, and now a fry,
And sometimes giblets for a pie—
While MARY ANN herself confessed
Of all her beaux she liked me best,
And cut out cages for the flies,
And coloured when I made sheeps' eyes.
SPASM II.
Farewell to all my killing looks,
My dreams that she would keep my books :
Farewell “the silver side” of life,
And MARY ANN–the Brewer's wife
Yes, little “hops” and Maltese lace
Have robbed me of her ruddy face;
Full-bodied HALE and treble X
Have won the loveliest of her sex:
The storm that was so long a-brewing,
Has burst and laid my hopes in ruin,
And, oh! the unkindest cut of all—
They buy their meat of MADox BALL!
The times are out of joint, and I
Look sheepish when she passes by :
In vain. I try to steel my heart,
And act the injured lover's part;
For one sweet smile, for one soft lock,
I’d lay my head upon the block;
To win but one kind word or so,
Down on º marrowbones I’d go;
Nay, if she bade me, for her sake
I would not murmur at the stake.
Unhappy man, of her bereft,
I’ve neither pluck nor spirit left
Life's chops and changes I must bear
Alone, without a soul to share
The fat and lean, the weal and woe,
That Fate weighs out to all below.
A TIDY DROP.-A Glass of Spirits, Neat.

MECHANISM For THE MILLion.

Do you want to get rid-temporarily, at all, events-of a Mother-in-
law? "We will show you how to lead her gently, in the midst of a long
and animated harangue, into a small room, which, once set-a-going,
will keep on ascending and descending for the space of three hours at
least. Isn't this worth six-and-eightpence any day of the week? Of
course.
Machinery clothes us, or puts us to bed,
Machinery brushes, or night-caps, our head,
Machinery nurses and dandles our chicks,
(One nurse-maid by these means suffices for six,)
Machinery, after spasmodical warning,
Ejects us from bed any time in the morning.
One spring (we’re not going to * anything about the spring which
doesn’t make a summer, in spite of the present beautiful but deceitful
weather) will set all the household machinery in motion. Those neces-
sary nuisances, known as servants, will then succumb to the Powers
of a simple but ºftº: mechanism, and masters and mistresses, the real
servi servorum, will again be free. One, two, or three servants, pro-
H. instructed, will, according to the size and requirements of the
ouse, do the entire work. The original cost of the machinery will
be the only outlay, and then, no more Impudence! no more broken
§: no more dirty plates! no more hairs in the clear soup! no more
othing intº of any sort |
You will begin the day with the Duties of the Dressing-room
by machinery. Whirr-whirr-whirr, out ...of bed. Pop! Whirr
-whirr-whirr-into, your bath. This will be reall worthy of
being called “a bathing machine.” ... More whirr-whirr-whirr,
accompanied by a good rough, towelling. Here, being in first-rate
animal spirits, you may (if you like) make a joke in allusion to the noise
of the machinery, and say that “instead of things going on better they
are getting whirrs and whirrs, by which you §f be taken to mean
“worse and worse;”—this is only your fun, and not by any means
true, Well, you are dressed for the morning: then, stepping on to a
small trapdoor in the landing, you pull a string after the fashion of
a nervous creature in a shower bath, and down you are taken to
the Breakfast-room. It won't be a very expensive affair to keep up
this sort of Trap.
Upon your sudden appearance below-stairs, you can say, some-
thing funny; it had better be funnier than before, if it occurs to you,
and you possess breath sufficient for the effort. If not, never mind;
IGANTIC are the strides of the Genius of
Modern Mechanism. Do we want to go up to
the cock-loft of the highest hotel in or out of
the metropolis, we betake ourselves to a Lift,
and we ascend like the fairies in the transfor-
mation scene of a pantomime, by machinery.
Will you have your hair brushed P You shall,
by machinery. shayed? Shave you, directly,
Sir, by machinery. After much thought, and a
lengthened course of daily self-sacrifice, we are
now able to place before the public, the result
of those experiments, by which, through the
application of mechanism to domestic affairs,
our life is shorn of more than half its trouble.
take your seat, which will advance towards you, apparently, of its
own accord, without any Davenport humbug, and await some happier
moment for the utterance of your light-hearted witticisms.
In course of time will be invented, also, the Finding Fault Machine,
for “blowing up” any offender: this will be the new infernal machine.
The first, object of interest on your breakfast-table, will be the
Hydraulic Teapot. To explain the mechanism of this admirable con-
trivance is not our business, except on private application, and the

Mrs. N. That gentleman was a stranger to you, but instead of re.

His affectation of vulgar talk showed me that, because it was overdone-

coarse. It was clever, but the aristocracy are never taken aback: , .

what I mean.
TEMPERANCE BY TEMPERATE MEANS.
F a truth, some de-
gree of gratification
was given to Mr.
Punch by an adver-
tisement setting
forth that a “Great
Permissive Bill Ban-
quet” would take
lace in the Free
'rade Hall, Man-
chester, on Easter
Wednesday, SIR
WALTER C. TRE-
vely AN in the Chair.
The ratification
which Mr. Punch
derived from this an-
nouncement would
have been unmixed
if the proposed ban-
quet had been repre-
sented as going to
be simply a Tem-
erance or Teetotal
inner. ºf and
drinking usually .
together, and the
- - - - - - rational method of
converting people to mild drinks is that of inducing them to try such
beverages with their food. But although it might be possible for a
sensible man to drink “Success to Temperance” by way of a toast
in toast-and-water, no such person desiring to maintain personal
freedom of action could further drink “Success to the Permissive
Bill,” that Bill being not a bill º: to follow their own
inclinations, but a Bill for empowering other people to restrain them
from doing so.
To convince folks that ginger-pop is preferable to Champagne, that
lemonade excels beer, and that eak sucrée altogether beats Port, Sherry,
Claret, or Burgundy, there is nothing like a dinner whereat the weaker
beverages, above-named are substituted for the stronger. This is as
much in the way, of physical, added to moral suasion, as SIR. W. C.
fºlvºs and his friends should go, if they wish to please Punch.
Mr. N. I do, MARIA, and also what I mean.
Mrs. W. And you will put off the party?
Mr. M. Except on the condition I have made.
Mrs. M. But I accept, the condition. I am not ashamed of your
friends, though in your ill-nature you accuse me of being. I shall be

Mrs. N. Certainly, or any other friend you wish. Do I give dinners

them, and prefer a chop at one with the children. Of course we will
ask MR. BoBBINs.
Mr. M. BLOBRINGs. (Embarrassed.). Well, we shall see about it.
... Mrs. N. I will send the note to a pillar-box to-night, and he will have
it at nine in the morning. I shall see his address in the Directory; you
need not think about it again. -
Mr. W. (weakly). Well, I don't know that he is just the man to
meet the SILVERDALEs and BALTIMOREs.
Mrs. N. He shall come.
Mr. M. No ; on second thoughts, he shall not.
Mrs. N. He shall come. After what you have said, I will put the
party off iſjº, do not invite him.
Mr. M. I will invite him, then. -
# M. I understand, and when he will get the note. I'll ask him
myself.
Mr. M. I tell you, it won't do; he’s a vulgar beast, and I wouldn't
have him for a hundred pounds.
Mrs. M.,(calmly). He comes, nevertheless. A wife is not to be
played with like a child or a toy. (The Lion Roars).

advised him to abjure sack and addict himself to thin potations.
CHATTER ABOUT CHARTERHOUSE.
Old Carthusians declare that the old school of Charteruouse
Has, in their time, at least, been a regular martyr-house:
That from being shut up in the slums of the City,
Their cheeks grew so pale as to move people's pity -
That their playground was scanty, and when they played cricket,
It scarcely allowed them to pitch a good wicket;
That they lived in the style which is termed “hugger-mugger,”
And parish brats really lived cleaner and snugger:
That they had not much water to wash top to toe in,
And none where they either could swim in or row in :
That a city like London’s beset with temptations,
Which enticed them to mischief on num’rous occasions:
That breathing the “Smiffel” air, smutty and smoky,
And living in quarters close, pent-up, and poky, , ,
Such things made them puny, and gave them the shivers,
And were bad for their brains, and their lungs, and their livers.
But stay, crieth Punch, ſº circumpolant jogi,
You seem quite to lose sight of the “genius loci.”
Pshal they sneer, the old place is all crumbling and rotten,
And its ancient traditions are now clean forgotten;
And as to the “genius,” there's really no knowing
What genius the Charterhouse lads might be showing,
But, what with scant air and inferior numbers,
'Tis no wonder at present their genius slumbers.
Let the school leave the town, and get settled in rure,
ſº at moving, the Master might fly in a fury,)
Then 'twill flourish again, spite of flogging and fagging,
Which two points to discussion’t were needless to drag in :
And old Domus, which used to be viewed as a martyr-house,
So great will become 'twill be called Magna Charterhouse !
A Silly gism.

The well-poised net falls true, Millions # throats the victor cheer,
Hamp'ring, alike, the trenchant blade,
And the strong hand that drew.
The world-wide Circus holds its breath
Between the lots of life and death;
Recalls the thrilling conflict's course—
Dear life to life opposed,
Courage that took no count of force,
But cheered, and charged, and closed:
Patience that from defeat arose,
And learnt to deal, by bearing, blows.
Till Circus-haunters, whollad watched
Famed sword-plays, long ago
And scorned these giants, ru ely matched,
Felt admiration grow, -
As stubborn strife to strength gave skill,
The art to guard, the craft to kill.
While the fight raged, men had but eyes
To watch its .# cheer;
In lusty cheers and stifled cries,
Speaking their hope and fear;
While foot to foot, and hand to hand,
Those bleeding brothers stained the sand.
Oft our short-sighted eyes misread
The chances of the fight,
Amazed to see him turn, who fled,
Him, who pursued, in flight.
But chance and change can shift no more,
Might is made clear, resistance o’er.

But let the vanquished claim a tear.
Man's strife God's guidance doth o'erule,
His means and ends are veiled:
But all can see, when blood runs cool,
How well he fought that failed.
In him that, spent and snared, lies low,
Hate's self must own a noble foe.
Not always to the swift the race,
Nor to the brave the fight;
But conquest’s blest that adds the grace
Of mercy unto might.
Then let the sign that says “We spare,”
Be his that lieth, bleeding, there.
Let his blood purge the bitter sin
For which he fought so well,—
The right claimed for the whiter skin
Black life to buy and sell:
Its champion fall'n, that sin is slain,
Never, like him, to rise again.
Then staunch those gashes' crimson flood,
Brother take brother's hand,
And o'er the stain of kindred blood
Sweep smooth the trampled sand:
The life, unto your mercy given,
Spare, with acclaim of Earth and Heaven.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REWARD ACCORDING TO WORKS.
ERTAINLY there is one
objection to the re-
ward announced in
the subjoined para-
graph by the Observer,
as about to be...con-
ferred, on... distin-
guished merit:-
- “We understand that
| MR. THwantes, Chair-
man of the Metropolitan
Board of Works, will
receive the honour of
knighthood on the occa-
sion of the opening of the
* system of intercep-
ing sewers on both
banks of the Thames."
The reward is in-
adequate to the merit.
MR. Thwaites has
won his spurs, and
therefore he deserves
to be knighted; but
the completion of the
great engineering
work over which he
has presided surely
entitles him to some-
thing more than the
title of a simple
knight. He has done
the State more service than that which has been rendered it by an
Alderman who earns that title by making his own fortune, and happen-
ing, as Lord Mayor, to have to stand the expense of feasting some illus:
trious characters. The drainage of London is, indeed, what a wag called
one of the Cemetery Companies, º: undertaking. The Government
had much better advise HER MAJEsty to create MR. Thwaites a
Baronet outright. By so doing they will do no more than what is just,
and, at the same time, exercising a wise discretion, will preclude a vile
phonetic pun which may be suggested to the popular mind by the
association of Knighthood with the achievement of conducting the Main
Drainage to a successful issue.
BEER ON TRIAL.
An instructive incident occurred the other day during an inquiry
about some beer before the Sheriff of Gloucester. An action was
brought by Messrs. Flower, the Brewers of Stratford-on-Avon (who
brew a sort of ale which is not unworthily called ShakspeaRE), against
another brewer named Pole, for putting some of his own beer into
some of their casks, and thereby damaging those vessels. According to
the Cheltenham Eraminer: —
“During the progress of the trial, MR. Taynton produced a sample of the beer,
in a tumbler, which being, as he alleged acid, tended, according to #. argument, to
injure the casks. The foreman of the jury, to whom it was handed, in order to test
its quality, tasted it, smacked his lips, and drank it off at a draught—much to the
astonishment and indignation of the worthy Under Sheriff-who spoke in terms of
complaint to the offender. The foreman excused himself by saying, that he “was
rather thirsty." As may be imagined, this way of sifting evidence created much
amusement in Court.”
The jury gave the plaintiffs a farthing damages. The only wonder is
that they gave them any at all. When beer is produced in Court in
proof that it is bad enough to injure barrels, and turns out to be so
good that the foreman of the jury, on tasting a glass of it, cannot hel
tossing the whole of it down, one would think there should be an en
of the question. Beer which a British juryman so eagerly committed
to his interior would surely be unlikely to corrode that of a cask.
Evidently, this was no small beer.
The Craven Meeting.
Those who are unable to attend this sporting event, will find them-
selves amply recompensed by a visit to One Tree Hill, which has,
* magical paint-brush of MR. FENTON, migrated to the Strand.
h part is admirably filled, but, specially is MR. Stoyle's Black
Greenwich Pensioner a sketch worth seeing... An Irish, friend amon
the audience informed us that “he admired this style” (he pronounce
it “this stoyle”). “of acting.” This artist must
trouble in “making up” for the part; but what’s toil to him gives
pleasure to us.

Owing to THE SOLEMNITY or THE Event, LITTLE SMITHING Lost

DOWN WITH YOUR GOLD-DUST.
RED hair is all the rage just now in Paris, and ladies whose hair is
black or brown by nature, are actually, endeavouring (so at least we
hear it whispered) to make it red | art. It is not very long since a
contrary result was fashionably aimed at, and blackening or embrowning
fluids were invented for the use of those whose tresses were unfashion-
ably red. But Fashion is capricious, and what is º one day is called
beautiful the next. As the colour upon which to sta
dye, rouge gagne now-a-days, and still more now-a-nights, in the swell
salons of Paris. . .
As applied to hair, however, the word “red” has not yet come into
fashion, although the colour may have done so. Ladies with red hair
used to vow that it was “auburn,” and now to say that it is “golden”
is the fashionable phrase. Moreover, not content with wearing golden
hair (whether natural or not it were impertinent to ask), the rich hair-
esses of Paris sprinkle gold-dust on their heads, to give their hair still
more the fashionable hue. This practice must be costly, if indulged in
by young ladies when going to a ball, for a rattling waltz or galop
would soon dance down all their gold-dust. As a provident papa, if
our daughters take to wearing such expensive hair:powder, we shall
either ...” their dancing, or insist upon their wearing a wide . by
way of collar, which may catch the precious particles when shaken from
their heads. -
We are aware that it is idle for a man to raise his voice against the
freaks of fashion, and as for uttering a protest against the wearing of
dyed hair, it were, in Oriental language, to “beat the air” to do so. If
hunchbacks or cross-eyes were to come into fashion, ladies would begin
to vie with one another as to which of them could cultivate the biggest
hump or squint. So it is useless to exhort them never to say Dye. If
fashion bade them wear grey hair, or even green, they would not hesi-
tate to do so. Pirates as they are, in all matters of costume, they will
sail under false colours at the very shortest notice. To impart an arti-
ficial redness to the hair is as easy, .# likely, as to give. it to...the
cheek; and we dare say there are few of those who dye their heads who

M. THIERS ON FRANCE AND HER NEIGHBOUR.
THAT conscientious statesman, M. Thighs, in the Corps Législatiſ
has lately, of course with the patriotic object of giving the imperial
Government the assistance of his sincere and disinterested advice, been
criticising the Italian Convention in a spirit hostile to united Italy, and
i. to the temporal Popedom. Following M. Rouh ER, who had
announced the Government's determination to carry the Convention
yout, according to REUTER’s telegram:—
“M. Thirits rose, and said that the position in which the Pope was placed was
untenable. He had been dispossessed of four-fifths of his States, and it was desired
to take from him the rest. What would France do, he asked, in the event of the
Romans annexing themselves to Piedmont?"
The new-born devotion of M. ThDERs to the Holy See is, highly
respectable. Of course so devout a Catholic must be at least a
Christian, if not, as heretics would say, something more. As a
Christian, then, is it not strange that M. Thiers should ask such a
question as “what would France do in the event of the Romans annex-
ing themselves to Piedmont?” Because Christianity furnishes the
religious THIERs with so, obvious an answer..., Surely, what. France
would do in the event of the Romans annexing themselves to Piedmont
is that which France would like to have done to herself if she were in

GENEALOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE.
SIR,--I have lately been in considerable difficulties getting up, as the
slang phrase goes, pretty tall trees–genealogical trees in fact-in order to
prove the descent of our family the THOMPKINSEs (with an “h” and a
‘p,” you observe) in a direct line from the celebrated JULIUS CAESAR.
You, who have simply to take down from your book-shelves a History
of Rome, have but small idea of the trouble there is in getting at the
noble Roman by means of branches.
That most distinguished member of the Herald's Office, MR.PLANCHE,
has unofficially and kindly offered to trace the THOMPKINSEs up to the
Invisible Prince, or the Yellow Dwarf, or any other of his old friends of
Fairy tale, but as he could not promise to go anywhere near JULIUS
r——
Geo. Thompkins
(His father.)
Q4:SAR, I was obliged respectfully to decline his good services. Seeing
that it would have taken a small fortune to ascend by this means to the
Great Progenitor of our Family, Idetermined to set to work at it myself.
. I will first show you how far I have got, and what a puzzling affair it
is. Puzzling! Goºd gracious, Sir! According to my calculations there
must have been millions and billions more people in the year one, than
in this present eighteen-hundred-and-sixty-five. Thus, take THOMP-
KINS, myself, and trace him, as SHAKSPEARE says, “till we find him
stopping a bung-hole with dust...or something of that sort; but I am
so confused that I have great difficulty in stating anything very clearly,
Just try your hand at it.
Thompkins

Mrs. Geo. Thompkins
(His mother.)
Now, Sir, it is evident that as Thompkins possessed a father and a mother, so also did GEORGE THOMPKINs, and so also did MRs. George
THOMPKINs. So we proceed thus:-

At this first station we stop, and set down eight' great-great-grand:

fifteenth generation, THOMPKiNs had seventeen thousand six hundred
and sixty-four ancestors, and where was JULIUS CESAR P. Why, we
have only got a quarter of the way; now, on we go again for another
quarter. fº. ’ve not got room for the calculations you can easily
publish a supplement, or leave out your pictures and put in my figures.”

space we omit.]
. Now, Sir, even now, we’re not half way to JULIUs CESAR. , What
immense combinations to produce a Thompkins ! I shall ask DR.
CoLENso and LQRD DUNDREARY to dinner, and will give you the result
of our united arithmetic.
I remain, Sir, yours, Theodore Thom PKINs.
Postscript. P'raps over our after-dinner grog, we may arrive at some
important winny-alogical conclusion.
FOREIGNERS IN IRELAND.
ALL the world and his wife are expected in Dublin this summer, and
the Dublinites are actively ºf to receive them., Indeed their
bustle now is such that they have hardly time to think or write cor-
rectly, as this announcement serves to show:—
DURIN: — To ENGLISH VINTNERS and HEAD HOTEL
WAITERS.–In three instances of peculiar domestic trials, we have THREE
HOTEL and TAVERN ESTABLISHMENTS to DISPOSE OF on reasonable terms,
which during the Great Exhibition would ise an independence to the pur-
chasers, from the thousands of foreigners from all parts of Europe and the three
kingdoms that will overcrowd this City: besides the Palace, with all its varied and
varying attractions, being permanent, will at all times afterwards attract a constant
succession of strangers and sojourners, and secure to Hotels and Taverns equally
constant demands for accommodation. Address, with stamp for reply, &c.
If Mr. Punch had occasion to answer this advertisement, his “stamp
for reply” would be a stamp of indignation at the notion of his being
mistaken for a foreigner. Great Britain he presumes is a part of the
“three kingdoms;” and, as the greatest of Great Britons; Mr. Punch
feels a just wrath at finding himself classed among the “ thousands of
foreigners” who are about to flock to Dublin, and who, doubtless,
when they get there will be finely fleeced. This latter fact seems pretty
evident, if the keepers of hotels are to “realise, an independence” in
the course of a few weeks from the pockets of their guests: which we
presume is what the advertisers wish to be inferred, although they tell
us that it is their “reasonable terms” which will “realise an independ-
ence” at these advertised hotels.
THE LATEST OMEN AT ROME.
MR. NAPIER SPIERs, an English sporting gentleman sojourning at
Rome, and aleading member of the Roman Hunt, rode, in a steeplechace,
the other day, at Roma Vecchia, a horse called Kettledrum, belonging to
PRINCE DoRIA, whose family colours are crimson and green. Accord-
ingly, MR. SPIE s wore a crimson jacket with green sleeves, over which
vestments he happened also to sport a white scarf. Thus variegated,
our gallant countryman had the good fortune to win the race. But the
combination of colours wherein he achieved that success, chanced to
constitute the Italian tricolor. On that account MR. SPIERs had the ill-
luck to be ordered by MonsignoRE MATTEucci, the Director of Police
to quit Rome in six days; and CARDINAL ANTONELLI, on being appealed
to, confirmed the sentence of his subordinate. Infaiibility surely
extends to Infallibility's ministers. How unerring is the judgment of
r
the authorities who thought fit to º a steeple-chace rider from the
Papal dominions for the unintentional affront of inadvertently wearing
forbidden colours! What incapability of blundering was manifest in
calling the attention of the world to the symbolical fact that the wearer
of the Italian tricolor won'. There is an English racing song entitled
“The Boy in Yellow wins the Day.” The expulsion contemplated by
the Papal Government of MR. SPIERs, was the safest possible way they
could have taken toº and cause to pass from mouth to mouth,
as a popular by-word, the parallel saying, “The boy in crimson, green,
and white wins the day.” In the policy of this meditated proceeding,
with especial regard to the proclivity of the Roman people to be
influenced by omens, there was decidedly “no mistake.” º although
the Government of His fioliness were u timately induced, by the repre-
sentations of British residents, to accept MR. SPIERs's explanations,
and let him stay, their suggestion of the ominous nature of his winning
tº: is an accomplished fact, and the good they did by it cannot be
unſione.

THE STAGE FROM THE FRONT.
THE Strand Managers having fed half a generation upon burlesques
and such dramatic pastry, are now striving to change their diet. The
chief dish of the evening is now a serio-comic drama called One Tree
Hill, which has supplied the place of Milky White. This little drama
is rather rickety in its story, is too full of weak characters, and depends
too much upon wills and documents. The author, MR. Čºven, is an
actor, with all an actor's, belief in well-tried stage expedients, particu-
larly in malapropisms. His acting is intelligent, but hard, spasmodic,
and narrow. It wants passion, and yet is too often a painful imitation
of the late FREDERick Robson. Miss M. PALMER is a promising
young actress with a faulty pronunciation, who knows how to be
natural; and MR. StoyLE, another importation from Liverpool, is a
most conscientious character actor. Small theatres, like the Strand,
are terribly destructive to real art: the actors are mixed too much with
the audience, to maintain the proper illusion of the scene; and the
audience are brought too close to the stage to respect the actors. MR.
Stoyle ignores the audience like a true artist, but we can hardly say
the same of many of his companions.
MR. FechTER’s Easter offering is the well-tried play of Belphegor,
in which he plays the mountebank, his wife being represented b
MDLLE, BEATRICE, a South-American-Italian lady, with a #ºn.
training, who performs in English. MR. FrchTER's son is played by
MASTER FEchTER... The chief members of the company are thus
adapted from the French as well as the drama, and are º more
skilfully. The scenery is very elaborate and effective, but the delays in
setting it are too heavy a price to pay for its merits. Equal allowances
of waiting and acting are too much for the patience of a busy and
punctual nation.
Young FREDERIck Robson—a son who resembles and copies his
lamented father—has appeared at the St. James's, and his reception
was honourable to the hearts if not to the heads of the audience. The
average British playgoer may not have much judgment, but he never
forgets an old favourite or an old favourite's children; and, young
Robson, if he likes, may become a popular, and with care, a good actor.
THE WHOLE HOG OR NONE.
The following extract from a letter written by, MR. John Stuart
MILL to MR. T. B. Potter, now Member for Rochdale, is a truly
admirable specimen of MILL's logic: –
“I have long since determined that, for myself, I will never join in any move-
ment for what is called manhood suffrage. Adult suffrage is what I contend for;
and when one goes in, not for an object immediately attainable, but for a principle,
we ought to go the whole length of it. No reason, either of right or expediency, can
be found to justify giving the suffrage to men, exclusively of women; and the word
manhood suffrage, having been substituted ſor the good old phrase, universal
suffrage, for the express purpose of showing that women are not included, to adopt
it is to give a direct assent to their exclusion."
If a principle is good, by all means let us, as MR. Mill, says, the
whole |. of it. Let us go the whole hog in the abstract, male and
female, like MR. MILL, who, with respect to the suffrage, goes not only
the whole boar, but, so to speak, the whole sow.
A Test.

rite, and Do a sum in the Rule of Three. "How many Members of
young MR. GROsvenoR's dandy Committee can comply with the requi-

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Sº
= zºº ENATORIAL holiday over, the Commons re-assembled on
Ypſ
Monday, April 24th. Nothing of note occurred, except a
discussion on the question whether the War-Office has not
been very unkind to a number of temporary clerks, who have
been dismissed, after serving so long that they had sup-
osed themselves to be Permanencies instead of Temporaries.
The authorities settled the matter in the peremptory style of
Miss SUSAN NIPPER. It may also be said that vast heaps of Scotch petitions were presented, a project for opening the Botanic Gardens, in
Edinburgh, on. Sunday afternoon, having, frightened all the Scotch ministers and elders out of their senses. Clergymen, who declare that
they enjoy a Monday's newspaper, and then send for the printer who produced it by working on Sunday, and excommunicate him, are of
course entitled to all the reverence due to charity and consistency. As
ILTON Says,
“New Presbyter is but Old Priest writ large.”
Divers of Her Majesty's subjects are detained as prisoners by the
KING OF AByssini.A. That monarch was said to have favoured QUEEN
Victoria with an offer of marriage, and to have imprisoned her lieges
in revenge for her non-appreciation of his dusky love. It is more
probable that he hopes to induce us to aid him, either with money or
arms, against his neighbours, and also against France, who is thought
to regard him with an unfavourable eye. e may have our own
reasons for not wishing to scrunch him, but they should be good ones,
if they are strong enough to justify us in leaving friends in his power.
Some of them are missionaries, who may be expected to take their
chance of the results of their pertinacious interferences, but CAPTAIN
CAMERON, our Consul, has a right to our best help...MR. LAYARD
deprecated any conversation on the subject, as the King is touchy.
. SIR.F. SMITH pointed out that in page 9 of the War Estimates there
is a mistake, in the addition, of £443,000. The other day we were told
that the War clerks are too clever by half, and certainly this looks like
it., The Houseless Poor and Abolition of Beggars Bill passed, so it
will be of no use for the Beggars to be coming to Town, as they are
A. so amusingly in MR. MARKs's capital new picture at the
cademy.
Tuesday. SIR GEORGE GREY very properly said that he disapproved
of the making, a show of the poor children at the Reformatories.
Islington, which is growing notorious for exhibitions, and seems eager
to get away from Puritanism and back to its normal condition of
“merry, 1slington” (Cowper), is now to be enlivened with a parade of
such children at the Agricultural Hall. The arrangements will probably
be modified, after the Minister's intimation.
Government at last brought in a Bill for the reform of Greenwich
Hospital; ...We felt quite unequal to enter into the subject until we had
examined the localities, and this investigation, with our usual zeal for
the interests of the public, we endeavoured to make later in the week.
Not wishing to excite the apprehensions of the Hospitallers by any
ostentatious parade, we occupied a balcony of the house of a lady of the
name of HART, whence we should have been able to examine the place
at leisure, but for a sun-blind, which limited our view to the river.
This, however, was of less consequence, as we had not been in our post
for more than a few minutes, when it became necessary, to adjourn to a
neighbouring room for refreshment, and this occupied us until a late
hour. We are able to speak in the highest terms of the refection,
especially of the salmon and hot pickles, the whiting omelette, the
ducklings and hº and the ices; nor must we omit a word of
praise touching the only liquids which our simple and temperate habits
Fº us to take, namely, the Sherry, Hock, Moselle Cup, Champagne,
ognac, Port, Claret, and Madeira. As regards the Hospital, we did not
like to disturbiñe waiters by asking them questions, but we believe that
the sailors are to have out-pensions, so that they can live with their friends,
and that the Hospital is to be #. for the infirm, and that the º,
ments are all to be made through the estimates; but as we shall shortly
have occasion to visit an inhabitant of Greenwich, called QUARTER-
MAINE, we shall make a point of ºf more fully into that matter.
A curious little Bill was ºf it in to-day—we do not mean at
Greenwich, as we had nothing to do with that detail—but in the House.
ARchpeacon HALE objects to the sale by auction of St. Bennet's
Church, E.C., so a Bill is to be passed enabling the Auctioneer to knock
down the sacred lot without the Archdeacon's leave.
Wednesday. After some debate, SIR GEORGE Bowyer's Bill for
regulating the jurisdiction of the Inns of Cºurt, was read a Second
Time, but there be signs and tokens that it will be wrecked before long.
º: Arvºn Gamal invited the Inns to say what they thought
about it.
In the middle of this day arrived the news that ARRAHAM LINCOIN
the honest, kind-hearted, resolute President of the United States, ha
been foully murdered in a theatre at Washington on Good Friday last.

Thursday. The Lords re-assembled, and EARL RUSSELL instantly
gave notice that on the following Monday he should move an Address
expressive of sorrow and indignation at the murder of MR. I./INCOIN.
EARL DERby said that such an expression would not only meet the
unanimous assent of the Peers of England, but would represent the
feelings of every man, woman, and child in Her, Majesty's dominions.
In the Commons, SIR GEORGE GREY gave a similar notice.
To-day, MR. GLApstone brought forward the Budget.*[We are
inclined to believe that it will not at all injure the chances of Minis-
terial Candidates at the .# fº Election, though of course such
a consideration never entered the head of the CHANCELLOR OF THE
Exchequer. º the way, his son—bless us all! MR. GLADSTONE
himself was but the other day being schooled by LORD. MAGAULAY, as a
oung man of promise, but too much addicted to High Church—has
§. asked to stand for a borough. His answer is not exactly like that
of LoRD AMBERLEY. He is willing to stand, but would avoid dog-
*. believing that being young, he ought to learn. Well sai
The Budget contains three points of importance:—
MR. Glapstone takes Sirpence off the Tea-Duty. All such reductions
have hitherto been an excuse for raising the prices by the grocers, who
invent the most extraordinary fictions for the mystification of Mater-
familias, about there, having been a deal of tea in bond, which it was
now necessary to sell at a higher price on account of the warehousin
system, and similar bosh, which sends her home with a wild cock-and-
bull story, but a clear assurance that the housekeeping will not be less
expensive. Let us hope that this time we may not be charged more
because the duty is lower.
Twopence in the Pound comes off the Income-Tar. We should not have
mentioned—we love to do good by stealth—that this is Mr. Punch's
j, but MR. GLADSTONE has written to us, begging that we will
j. y his accidental omission. This important diminution, which
reduces the tax to a GROAT, or shall we playfully say a Joe, was made
by, MR., GLADSTONE in consequence of Mr. Punch's intimation that
unless it were made, he should oppose the Ministry at the General
Election, and bring in LoRD, DERRY.
The Fire Insurance Duty is to be a uniform Eighteenpence. It must
all come off sooner or later, but some people have that tenacious and
slightly obstinate nature which will never do exactly and frankly the right
thing...They will give ń. a cheque for £100, and snarl at you for taking
one of their clean envelopes to put it in. -
The rest of the Budget speech was made up of a historical survey, for
which see the previous volumes of Punch, of a glorification of our pros-
perity, for which see our Cartoons, fº. and of a demolition of the
views of the Conservatives about the Malt. Tax, for which see various
of our brilliant articles and songs. Where should statesmen go for their
diamonds, but to our Golconda!
Friday. The Temple of Justice Bill was read a Second Time in the
Lords, the CHANgEILoR drawing so frightful a picture of the present
inconveniences of the profession and the suitors that even Lord St.
LEONARDs was moved. But he disapproved of the Bill, and also
deplored the prospect, in which LoRD WESTBURY exulted, that there
would soon be no difference between Law and Equity.
The thunder of the Commons is about to descend on one G. M.
MITCHELL, for breach of privilege. There have been forged signatures
to the petitions about AzāEMJAH ! ...Something dreadful is to happen
but we have not yet heard whether MITCHELL is to be executed in Óld
or in New Palace Yard. - -
We suppose that, the Members had been tired out at the Private
View of the Royal Academy—(when MR. Dish AEII comes into office,
we trust that he will remember the polite and considerate way in which
we abstained from showing ourselves before him while he was inspecting
MR. MILLAIs's "Enemy Sowing Tares”—we object to foreign parts,
unless a diplomatic mission)—for they were Counted Out at dinner-time.

beasts, as well as posted on a hill-side, or stuck upon a tree. Elephants
will have their broad sides, plastered with the puffs of enterprising
tradesmen, and placards will be fastened upon §º. and bisons,
porcupines and pigs., Camelopards will be trained to carry boards

man mightily, after bagging, say, a wild duck, to find a quack's adver-

about the circumstance, and would announce it in a letter to some
sporting print. This would be precisely what would suit, a puffing
shopkeeper. Publicity is what an advertiser aims at, and he little cares
in what way he attains it., When once men take to advertise by

they will not shrink from any act of Nature-slaughter. All the beauties
of Nature they will spoil as they are able, and deface them and deform
them, whether animate or inanimate. ... They would hunt a chamois
merely to !'. it with puffs; and if they caught a bird of paradise,
they would never hesitate to strip it of its plumage, if they could turn
the plucking to account as an advertisement.
THE OBJECTS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.
On Wednesday last week a Confirmation was held by the Bishop of
LoNDon at Christ Church, Newgate Street, when, as a reporter puts
it, “a large, number of young members of Christ's Hospital were
admitted to the ancient rite of the Church by the imposition of hands.”
In recording this event, we take, the opportunity which it affords of
reminding the Governors of the abovenamed establishment that, how-
ever satisfactory the progress and conduct of the Bluecoat boys may
be in many †. there is one particular wherein their habits are
notoriously of the worst description. That is to say, their clothes are
uncomfortable, ugly, and ridiculous in the extreme. To those who were
confirmed the other day, the Bishop delivered an address on the nature
of the ceremony which they had been engaged in, and of course he
told them how, they ought to walk; but anybody, who observes the
clumsy shoes which those boys are studiously provided with, will see
that they must experience the greatest difficulty in walking anyhow.

APTENODYTES PENNANTIS, ESQ.
(A Sketch taken in the Zoological Gardens).
PHILOSOPHY AND FASHION.
To the lº. mind it is ever an amusement to contemplate the
fanciful and ſickle freaks of fashion. -
When hoops went out of vogue nigh a century ago, the ladies vowed
that scanty petticoats were infinitely prettier; and they vied with one
another in reducing, their dimensions, until their skirts, became so
shrunken they could hardly move their feet within the limited circum-
ference. So, doubtless, will it be again now Crinoline is doomed. The
milliners of Paris have determined on reviving the “costume of the
Empire” of some ſiſty seasons since, and who will dare, dispute, the
mandates of the milliners. Already we see signs of the change which
is approaching. Ladies fresh from Paris startle our eyes now-a-days by
appearing in what at first sight we might fancy are their night-dresses.
§º. when once the tide sets in, all the female world will swim
with it., Casting overboard their Crinoline, the Ladies will all look as
though they had been put under a rigid course of BANTing. Our wives
will so altered that we shall hardly know them; and, when they
walk out in their limp and scanty dresses, we shall at first be scarcely
º: to realise our happiness in missing the accustomed chaſing of our
suins.
To the philosophic mind it will be curious to note what excuses will
be made for the wearing of scant petticoats, to which the ladies have
all vowed that they never could revert. The comfort that there was,
said they, in wearing iron cages nobody could tell; and they protested
that they wore them solely for that reason and not for fashion's sake.
The philosopher might shrug his shoulders, at their vows, and rightly
estimate their worth; but philosophy availed naught in its efforts to
reduce the circumference of petticoats, which fashion had expanded
and fashion only could contract. In its influence on Lovely Woman,
philosophy will bear no comparison with fashion; and the philosopher
who fancies that his words will be listened to, when fashion claims a
hearing, is no better than a fool.
A FISHY TALE.
MRs. CANDouk (loq.). There’s no one that has a greater horror of
scandal than I have, Mrs. SPEAKER; but one can't help making
remarks promiscuous, you know. Now, there’s MRs. PEERs, what
lives in that great House overyonder, a fady that prides herself on her
family connections and what not, and whose daughters all wear tippets
trimmed with ermine. You’ve heard o'course about that little affair!
No? well, it's afishy tale, MRs, SPEAKER; a very fishy tale. So far as
I can get at the rights of it, and setting aside all inflammatory reports,
MRs. PEERs, who was always considered a perſe; #. in every|.
respect, is in a very delicate state. You see we’re all fallible creturs,
and likely to be thrown off our guards. Mrs. Peers was looking out
for what might be passing, when she saw a Man with what seemed a
very nice º she went to the door, and she says, “What do you
want for that plaice, my good man?”, for it struck Mrs. PEERs that he
hadn't come honestly by it. Well, it’s not in my nature to be unchari.
table: it's hard to judge your fellow-mortals, but we are called upon to
believe that the man, smitten by conscience, instantaneously, so to speak
drºpped the plaice and took to his heels. Sichthings have happened
before; sich things might happen agin. Well, MRs. PEERs, materally
enough, took up the plaice, and said to herself this will do very nicely
for Digky; he's pertickler fond of any kind of plaice; so she laid it on
a shelf, and when Dicky came home she told him what had occurred,
and he thanked MRs. PEERs kindly.
But now comes the most marvellist part of this fishy tale. The
plaice which seemed so nice, and fresh as soon as it was put on the
table,0,...dear! every ºne in the house cried “poo!” and where’s my
salts? It was regularly, it was indeed, gamey; would you believe it?
Mºs. PEERs was cut up dreadful. She couldn't help admitting, even
while she held her vinaigrette up, that it was overpowering; and the
worst of it is, they can't get the disagreeable smell out of the House.
Brown paper has been burnt, RIMMEL has been summoned, windows
have been thrown up, and º means of wentilation tried agin and
agin, but as MR, BARD says, “You may pint to the cause of sich fumes,
if you will, but them wot's got noses will shun the plaice still.”
A WOICE FOR THE WOICELESS.
THERE is an old saying that “Speechis silver, and silence is golden; ”
but there are people in the world whose silence is, unhappily, anything
but golden to them, deprived, as they are, utterly of all º of speech.
In London alone are some two thousand deaf and dumb, who, by their
sad affliction, are prevented from pursuing many courses of º:
which would otherwise be open to them. For these poor folk, who
cannot speak a word for themselves, Mr. Punch would say a word to
those who are disposed to do a kindly act. Anybody, who is gifted
with a bump of benevolence, can only need the very slightest hint from
Mr. Punch that money is required to assist the deaf and dumb, who in
part through their calamity are straitened in their means, and whose
tongues are helpless in pleading for our help.
Thanks to Mr. WILLIERs and his excellent Houseless Poor Act,
our streets will soon be cleared of beggars by profession; and the
money which has yearly been wasted on impostors will be available to
aid such poor afflicted creatures as the deaf and dumb. Let the benevo-
lent then put their hands into their pockets, and not take them out until
they get to Regent Street, where, if they ask politely at Number 309,
they may see agentleman of the novel name of Smith. He will be
most happy to relieve them of the money they may chance to have about
them, º to make a better use of it than would the street beggars, to
whom, but for this notice, it might possibly have gone.
many deaf and dumb who are among the houseless poor, a building
fund has properly been started for their housing; and MR. SMITH, is
the good Secretary to whom subscriptions may be paid for aiding this
good work.
As there are
BROTHER IGNATIUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS.
According to a contemporary, BROTHER IGNATIUs at Easter per-
formed some extraordinary services. To be sure, the services which
this cecentric devotee ordinarily performs are extraordinary enough,
but those which he performed at Easter appear to have been more than
ordinarily extraordinary. Among the scenery of these performances
was included a mimic sepulchre, with a figure in it, of which the
description need not be copied. Suffice it to quote the statement
that:-
“This sepulchre was thrown open to the public. At the entrance was a bowl,
with the inscription, “Offerings for the Sepulchre.”
The establishment of BRother Ignatius includes a little boy called
the “INFANT SAMUEL,” the contriver, probably, of the arrangement
above described, and author of its inscription, which looks very like
“Remember the Grotto!” But whenever IGNATIUs walks abroad, no
doubt he is followed by a multitude of street boys; and perhaps in
adapting to the purposes of his imitative, ceremonial analogies which he
may have derived from the opening of the oyster-season, he has been
pleased to take a lesson from a portion—likely to be the largest portion-
of his own followers.
For the Drawing-Room.
(When there's a dead silence.)
My first is a bird; my second's a letter of the alphabet: my whole
is some game.

FOULLY ASSASSINATED, APRIL 14, 1865.
Fou lay a wreath on murdered LINCOLN's bier,
Fou, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,
Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,
His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,
His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair,
His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease,
His lack of all we F. as debonair,
Of power or will to shine, of art to please.
You, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,
Judging each step, as though the way were plain:
Reckless, so it could point its paragraph,
Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain.
Beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet
The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew,
Between the mourners at his head and feet,
Say, scurril-jester, is there room for you ?
Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,
To lame my pencil, and confute my pen—
To make me own this hind of princes peer,
This rail-splitter a true-born king of men.
My shallow judgment I had learnt to rue,
Noting how to occasion's height he rose,
How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,
How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows.
How humble yet how hopeful he could be:
ow in good fortune and in ill the same:
Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,
Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.
He went about his work—such work as few
Ever had laid on head and heart and hand—
As one who knows, where there’s a task to do,
Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command;
Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,
That God makes instruments to work his will,
If but that will we can arrive to know,
Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.
So he went forth to battle, on the side
That he felt clear was liberty's and Right's,
As in his peasant boyhood he had plied
His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights—
The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,
The iron-bark, that turns the lumberer's axe,
The rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil,
The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,
The ambushed Indian, and the prowling bear—
Such were the needs that helped his youth to train:
Rough culture—but such trees large fruit may bear,
If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.
So he grew up, a destined work to do,
And lived to do it: four long-suffering years'
Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,
And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,
The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,
And took both with the same unwavering mood:
Till, as he came on light, from darkling days,
And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,

A felon hand, between the goal and him,
Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest,-
And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,
Those gaunt, long-labouring limbs were laid to rest
The words of mercy were upon his lips,
Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen
When this vile murderer brought swift eclipse
To thoughts of peace on earth, good-will to men.
The Old World and the New, from sea to sea,
Utter one voice of sympathy and shame!
Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high, .
Sad life, cut short just as its triumph came.
A deed accurst Strokes have been struck before
By the assassin's hand, whereof men doubt
If more of horror or disgrace they bore;
But thy foul crime, like CAIN's, stands darkly out,
Wile hand, that brandest murder on a strife,
Whate'er its grounds, stoutly and nobly striven;
And with the martyr's crown crownest a life
With much to praise, little to be forgiven

A New LIGHT.--When the Heroine of a Novel is represented as
"becoming agitated on hearing the sound ºf her lover’s step,” it may
be taken to mean that she was startled by the hollow ºf jº.
A REAL, BLESSING TO GRAZIERS.
THE British Farmer of these days is a gentleman of fashion, so much
of one, at least, as to have, fashionable daughters, who play or sing all
the new music, and read the Morning Post. In that excellent journal,
therefore, the hters of the British, Farmer will have met, with a
leader relative to this spring season, and concerning, not indeed spring
bonnets, and spring toilettes, but º: crops, and the kindred subject
of bucolic matters. Not, as merely fashionable young ladies, skippin
this solid article, but, like sensible girls, *::: it their attentive perusal,
they will have no doubt been so forcibly struck with the ensuing remarks
as to have been impelled to read them out to their papas:-
“Notwithstanding the deficiency of provender which must have been expe-
rienced in all parts of the kingdom, the animals look healthy, and the officers of the
Society for the Prevention of §º to Animals will, we hope, have little occasion
to interfere for their protection. Self-interest alone, generally speaking, induces
people to take care of the inferior animals; and if railway companies would only
construct troughs around their cattle trucks, for the purpose ºf holding water for
the use of horned cattle and sheep during their transit from place to place—which
could easily be filled at stations where detention is necessary, and where the engine
has to be “watered"—there would be little if anything to complain of in the present
mode of sending live stock to market.”
Just the verything for the purpose specified by the Post has been
devised by MR. REID, of Granton. A model of it was exhibited, last
January, at a special general meeting of the West Lothian Agricul-
tural Association. On the occasion of its exhibition, MR. Reid, at the
call of the Chairman, SIR WILLIAM BAILLIE, of Polkemmet, Bart,
made a speech to explain the necessity for his invention; which is
threefold. In the first place, by conveyance for long distances without
water, animals suffer extremely, MR. Reid asks:—
“Is it to be wondered at to see the animals leave the trucks at the end of the
º utterly exhausted, and the saliva often oozing from their noses and mouths,
or to all appearance in a state of uisease?”
Secondly, if anybody thinks the suffering of the cattle of no conse-
quence, let him be undeceived by the information that their misery
makes bad meat. In continuation, MR. Reid observes, for the
enlightenment of benighted indifference:–
“Indeed, anyone acquainted with cattle slaughtered in that state knows that the
beef has lost considerably in quality, and consequently the value of the animals is
very much reduced, from the simple cause of the want of a timely supply of fresh
water on the journey, which acts in a manner upon cattle easily observable to the
most unpractised eye.”
So the thirst of stock tells upon the breeder's pocket. Thirdly, the
rice of good meat, in competition with bad, is of course raised to
'aterfamilias, and the public, now, “when,” as MR. REID reminded
his hearers, “each pound of wholesome butcher's meat costs more than
double the price it did a very few years ago.” Think of that!
Good sound 3. beef and mutton, according to MR. REID, are
rendered dry and coarse by the want of water on a long journey by
rail. A late outcry about diseased meat was caused principally by this
want of water. If stock, during transit, were properly supplied with
water, the Railway carrying traffic would soon be §. }. to one
cn MR. Reid's invention.
By its use the scab on sheep would in a great measure be prevented,
and that, of course, would promote the consumption of mutton. From
the hose supplying the engine of a railway-train, “the stoppage of
one minute would suffice to supply water to each truck ſº up with
the patent watering trough,” invented by MR. REID. The trucks
would require to be watered only “at intervals of, say, from five to six
hours.”. Is it necessary to say more?
No; but the farmers' daughters who read the article in the Post
about the watering of stock, now that they have also read the foregoing
statements respecting a clever contrivance for that purpose, will all
exclaim, “Do, Papa, try and make those Railway Companies have
their trucks all fitted up with MR. REID's patent watering-trough to
prevent thirst from tormenting poor cattle.”
HAMLET AT WIENNA.
SHAksPEARE, by the subjoined, account from a contemporary, does
not seem to be so carefully studied as he ought to be by Austrian
actors:-
“Consequences of Mimicking A Minister. - An actor at Vienna named
Aschek has just been condemned to a week's imprisonment for having mimicked
on the stage M. de Schwerling, by gestures and by wearing the costume of an
Austrian functionary; and also for introducing political allusions into a piece.”
The Viennese comedian who ventured to offend M. SchMERLING,
and incur
“The deep damnation of his taking-off,”
to the extent of a whole week's durance, evidently had not read, or not
considered, Hamlet’s caution to the players respecting Polonius:-
“Follow that lord; and, look you, mock him not.”
At Vienna the theatre is some way from Liberty Hall.

and I won't stand it. If his was a careful and accurate work, so too was mine';

lengths did they carry this strict rule, that, to repeat to a third, brother, on the
authority of a first, any remark upon the fineness or wetness of the weather, Was
taken to be a breach of confidence punishable by the dagger.
Why does he omit all mention of “The Secret Fraternity of the Mystic
Muffin,” who used to meet every afternoon, about four o'clock, when summoned by
the ringing of a small bell? This Brotherhood has come down to our own day,
and the signal may even now be often heard in the more retired, streets of our
vast Metropolis. During the growth of this Society, womenkind have gradually
been admitted, and, now-a-days, its most distinguished members are spinsters of
forty, and others who evidently belong to the “Middle Ages.” This Society has
few secrets of its own, chiefly * itself in discussing those of other people.
Their meetings are generally, held by scandal-light... Like the Egyptians, who
honoured the sign of Tau, so they exhibit a reverent joy at the first sign of Tea.
The meeting is sometimes called a Drum, and the secret notice sent round to
every member contains these mysterious words: “Halfpast four: Drums and
Crumpets.” A refusal to attend, is couched in this form: "Blow the Crumpets!”
There are a great many ceremonies to be observed on entering any one of these
lodges, which vary according to the rank, of the Lodge itself, and the dignity of
the member. Thus, there is, a Duchess's Lodge, a Countess's Lodge, and a
Washerwoman's Lodge. In the last, boiling tea is solemnly poured into a saucer,
blown upon by the member who holds it, and then taken down without winking.
So severely is secresy imposed upon all female members of the body, that they

HELPS TO YOUNG DRAMATISTS.
THE Young Dramatist will always find it an easier matter to write the
middle, than either the .."; or ending, of his piece. Often and
often, is the , juvenile aspirant bursting with racy dialogue, telling
speeches, and startling situations, which can be of no possible value,
even, to their owner, unless the drama, of which they are to form part,
has been fairly started. How many dramatic works have never seen
light because their authors have despaired of ever fixing upon a first
i. we shall probably never—at least let us hope we shall never—
now.
We propose giving a few forms for commencing and ending a drama,
which will prove as serviceable to Young Dramatists, as are precedents
of various contracts to a conveyancer.
THE MELODRAMA.
Say that you wish to write a Melodrama of the middle ages. You've
got your situations, your plot, and your set speeches. You want
names, a first scene, directions for entrances and exits, and a good
finish. Here is your model:—
Scene 1.-Erterior of the Donjon Keep of D'Arcourcy Castle.
The objection that you do not know what a Donjon Keep is, should
have no weight with you : it hasn't with us. Stage directions:–
[The Servants discovered laying breakfast. Old HUBERT the
Seneschal superintending.
N.B. Always have a Seneschal on the stage whenever you can. It
looks well in print, and must be more or less a good part. Of course
.."; *" that L.H. means left hand, R.H. right hand, C. for centre, and
so forth.
Let Old HUBERT be standing R.H., and servants L.H. Table c.
The student is advised to note down in a book the names that occur
here from time to time, as they will be invaluable to him hereafter.
Whatever the nature of your piece, you can't do wrong in using this
orm of opening speech:-
Old Hubert. Bestir yourselves, my men. (Sees one of the servants
drinking out of a pitcher: stops him, and seizes it.) What! ye lazy,
drunken, idle varlet, is it thus ye make away with SIR REGINALD's best
Malmsey P (Drinks it himself. All laugh.) -
1st Servant. (N.B. This is an economy, in names, which it appears,
from theatrical usage, is always considered necessary in large establish-
ments. . Thus leaving John, RICHARD, WILLIAM, and such like names
for their betters, the Baron's followers are ſº known as “lst
Retainer,” “2nd Retainer,” “3rd ditto,” and so forth; a plan that
might, with some advantage, be adopted in hotels, or even private houses,
where the Butler would be 1st Retainer, Footman 2nd Retainer, down
to the boy in buttons, who might be fractional, say 3A Retainer. Well,
the 1st Servant says to HUBERT-
1st Servant. But, MASTER HUBERT-
[Which isn't much for a 1st Servant to say. But he wouldn't have
to make even that observation, were it not for our desire to get something
out of old HUBERT for the information of the audience, who have not, as
yet, had much opportunity of forming any very clear idea of the plot.
So interrupts MASTER HUBERT, somewhat testily, as is the fashion with
Semeschals:—]
Old Hubert. But, forsooth ! Give me none o' your buts. SIR
REGINALD would want many a butt in his cellar an thou hadst 'em all
for thy mouth. (Servants laugh.)
[This is a Shakspearian jest, and will set the audience in a good
humour.]

won't, according to your own arrangement of plot, and conception of
character).
Old Hubert (after finishing this sentence). But gramercy, I recollect—

Old Hubert. Nay, 'tis no story; but I recollect—(tells them what he
recollects; and here we are in the midst of your plot.)
The story being over,

course, strikes twelve) a dark figure was seen to cross, (a dark figure is

the dark figure uplifts the arm and—) When, &c. &c.
... [This will take you well into your Melodrama or Romantic º:
it might even suit a farce, though perhaps hardly light enough for the
modern productions of the last class.]
THE NAUTICAL DRAMA
Offers uncommon opportunities for jumping into the middle of your
plot; thus:—
SOENE...], Erterior of the Three Jolly Anchors, Chertsey. Sailors and
Watermen discovered drinking. Fiddler playing. Pedlars selling
their wares to Lasses.
1st Sailor. And where’s BEN BILBows? (Your chief character).

TAXES.
A HINT or two on this subject will not, we feel sure, be thrown away
upon the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer. Supposing the present
duties were taken off several things, an enormous revenue might be
obtained by levying taxes as follows:–
On every “good story” told more than three times by the same
person.
A Tax upon any one talking about the weather.
Upon all amateurs on the flute, violin, and cornet, without exception.
Upon all after-dinner speeches over three minutes in length.
Upon all young ladies singing Italian songs without understanding
the language.
b º on all young ladies or gentlemen singin
#.
- any song whatever, and,
eir affecte
º long wandering stories without any point ought to be heavily
x
pronunciation, rendering the words totally unintelli-
A Tax on all dramas “taken from the French.”
On extensive Crinolines.
Enormous Tax, on all pianoforte variations, and specially upon those
on the Garnival de Vénise.”
Qn all bad dinners, and the heaviest Tax possible on bad wine.
Upon all burlesques and all bad puns, specially any play on the words
22 -- * as for instance, to say of the preitiest young lady at
“belle beau:
the dinner-table, that she is “the dinner bell;” or that a “beau ought to
be brought #. 'arrow; ” and all such jokes as involve the twisting of
the words “Eton,” “Harrow,” “Father and farther,” “Rain and
reign,” “Heir, air, hare, that ere, they air (for ‘they are’),” “Gait and
gate,” “Nose, knows, and noes,” “Knight and night,” and all such
jokes whose fun depends upon the omission, or addition, of the letter H.
There should be a duty placed upon all jokes on the names of popular
artistes and authors; thus there should twopence levied on every
trifling with MELLon, Pyne, STIRLING Coyne, KEAN, Fechter,
Toole, and so forth.
“comparisons ARE,” ETC.
Hansom Cabby (to Driver of Cheap Omnibus). “Now, THEN, SAM 1 ME AND My Swell, wants To catch A TRAIN ?
That Nora's HARK or Youan.”
Bºsſ
Do GET on with
The most fearful Tax upon irreverent jesting on the word PUNCH.
A Tax upon Mothers-in-law. Heavy.
A Tax on BANTING.
A Tax on BANTING's followers.
A Tax on every speech of MR. Whalley's.
A Tax upon anyone who objects to smoking in a railway carriage.
A Tax of 100 per cent. on everyone who won't lend you five shillings.
A Tax upon every sermon that shall exceed fifteen minutes.
A Tax upon everyone who doesn't take in Punch. This, of course,
will not yield many halfpence annually.
And if the above list does not suffice, then let there be a Tax on
everybody and everything indiscriminately. God save the QUEEN
DIVIDING THE WOOLSACK.
“This EDMUNDs case,” said Westbury,
Sarcastic, smooth and cool,
“Will prove a case of ample cry,
But very little wool.”

“Though we perhaps don’t get the wool,
You ought to get the sack.”

At some forthcoming aristocratic Private Theatricals, EARL Russell
and his Son will, it is hoped, appear in a new version of the popular
Opera La Sonnambula, to be on this occasion entitled, My Son-Amberley.

nation of MR. LIN-
coln, and praying

communicate those
sentiments to the

each case the motion
was unanimously
agreed to; in the
Iords Wiscount
STRAT Fok D DE
Redcliffe, who
had sojourned in other days in America, adding a few words of testimony to the E
worth of the murdered President. Later in the week, H H R MAJESTY's replies
were delivered by the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN and by lord PRoby. The QUEEN
(be it mentioned here that the Royal Widow has addressed an autograph letter of
kindly sympathy to the Republican Widow) entirely participates in the sentiments
of the liouses, and has given directions to SIR FREDERick BRUce, our Minister at
Washington, to make known the feelings of the QUEEN and people of England to
the American Government.
May Day. As was predicted by Mr. Punch, the Bill for doing away with certain
Declarations by Dissenters, on taking office, came to grief. LoRp Houghton
moved it in a clever speech, and I ord DERby opposed it, stating, however, that
the Declaration was not worth the paper it was written on, if regarded as a protec.
tion to the Church. But he thought that the enemies of the Church were
excessively Cocky, and that as giving up one thing only led to their demand of
another, he ...: take the liberty of shutting them up on the present occasion.
The Bill was thrown out by 72 to 49. Speaking impartially, yet with allowance for
human nature, Mr. Punch is not inclined to be too severe about this, for there was
a Liberation Society holding conferences in London, and day by day proclaiming
in the most exultant manner, that either by sap or by storm it was doing all sorts
of damage to the Church. And this Bill was part of its programme. . A statesman
should do right in spite of friends whom, he despises, and enemies whom he hates,
but LoRn DERby is not perhaps so entirely angelic as one of his Fº friends.
MR. FRITH paints a picture of the Derby lay. MR. JAcoB BELL buys it, and
hands it to Mit. GAMBART to exhibit for five }. MR. BELL bequeaths the
picture to the National Gallery, and goes where the good Quakers go. The trustees
ask the executors for the picture. The executors ask MR. GAMBART for the
picture. MR. GAMBART says that he has sent the picture to the uttermost parts of
the earth, but he thinks it may be home in August. This is MR. THOMAS BARING's
answer to MR. GREGoRY. The Horses of Venice, previously esteemed the most
travelled of artistic works, have been stay-at-homes compared with the Horses of
England-which the picture does not represent, by the way, as it represents the
period “between races;” but we were not going to lose an allusion and a chance
of showing our elegant knowledge, for the sake of accuracy, though we explain
the truth, for the sake of conscientiousness.
An admirable measure, worth a hundred clap-trap Bills, was read a Second Time.
It is a Government Bill, and is for the Amendment of the Law of Partnership.
The attempt to reform the law in this particular has been made before, but in vain;
and the usual cackle about innovation, speculation, and fraud has been uttered.
But the House of Commons read the Bill a Second Time to-day by 126 to 39, so
that its ultimate success is a mere question of time. When it is passed, we incline
to think that we shall put a little jº into Mr. Thomas Bºning's house, not.
withstanding his having opposed the Bill.
..Tuesday. My Lords send the Public Schools Bill, to a Select Committee, who
will hear counsel. We hope the Blue Coat School will appear, and beg to be
deprived of its breeches.
A final attempt was made by the obstructives to delay the passing of the Courts
of Justice Bill, but LoRD WesTBURY declared emphatically that nothing would
eyer be done if nothing was ever begun, and that for forty years we had been con-
sidering, and hesitating, and postponing, and he fairly shoved the House over the
ſence. Resistance was put down by 55 to 32, and the Bill, and also the Concentra:
tion Bill wenta-head. LoRD ELLENBoRough said that the proposed, edifice woul
require a MICHAEL ANGELo, whom he did not see. Let him call at 85, Fleet
Street, and see the required Michael.
Many Indian officers have a grievance, arising out of the transfer of the Com-
WOL. XLVIII. u
pany's Army to the Queen. CAPTAIN JERyis moved an
address for redress. Government opposed, SIR CHARLEs
WooD arguing elaborately and incomprehensibly against
the plea. But Government were beaten by 49 to 39.
This reminds us that the Hon. GeoRGE DENMAN ought
to be at once put to death. We have the utmost per-
sonal respect for him as a gentleman, a lawyer, and an
athlete, but he must really die, the death and be slain
as a traitor. He actually argued, in an Indian case the
other day, that the QUEEN, in regard to India, was no
Queen at all, but only a Trustee for joun Company.
Will he oblige us by sending a note to SIR John Fox Bur-
GQYNE, who, we rejoice to see, has had his long and admi-
rable services recognised by his being made Constable of the
Tower, and say when it will be convenient for him, MR.
DeNMAN, to attend on Tower Hill. Why MR. Justice
BLACKBURN did not commit him on the spot is a question
which like. How Does the Water come Down at lodore ?
is more easily asked than answered.
Bank Notes of England are to be made a legal tender in
Ireland. To do our Irish fellow-creatures justice (though
it is just the thing they don't like) we never knew them
reſuse any little document of the kind. But they may re:
quire new lights on banking subjects. It was in Ireland
that the people of a town, hating a certain banker, collected
all his notes and burned them publicly, in order to ruin him.
Wednesday. Began the BAINEs Bother—every incident
requires a name, for easy reference. Of course, we could
say that this debate was upon MR. BAINes's measure
for reducing the franchise in boroughs from £10 to
6 per annum. MR. BAINEs moved the Second Reading,
MR. Bazley seconded it, and LoRD Elcho moved the
º question, MR. BLAck *: him, and
[R. LEAthAM speaking for the Bill. Then did rise
MR. Robert Lowe in all his force, and, speaking as a
Liberal, and one, who, had suffered for being one |.
Tories who had driven him from office here blushed, like
cabbage-roses) he warned the Liberals against an alliance
with Democracy. He cited the celebrated petition of three
millions of the people against paying the interest of the
National Debt as proof of the mode in which sacred matteis
would be dealt with, if we took power from education and
property and give it to those who live on weekly wages. He
said that any man could have the suffrage, if he chose to
give up 120 quarts of beer in the year, that the man who
would not make that sacrifice did not deserve the trust,
and that it ought not to be degraded. He made a vigorous
and emphatic appeal against swamping the representation.
The House was astonished, but cheered, and when he sat
down, and a Scotch lawyer rose, they would not have him,
but called on MR. BERNAL Osborn E, as they wanted to be
treated pleasantly after excitement. The proceedings ended
in a row over the adjournment, and after a scene which was
laughable enough, the debate “dropped through” at a
quarter to six. How MR. Lowe has since been abused by
certain organs it is needless to say, but he is as well as can
be expected.
Thursday. LoRD DERBY, in seconding the motion for the
address to the American Government, had said that if the
South had countenanced the assassination, they would have
been guilty of what was worse than a crime—a blunder.
His friend and fellow-translator, LoRD It Avensworth
asked him for a translation of this phrase, which has been
severely commented upon. This gave Loan Derby a
double opportunity—he explained that he had used the
words only in the sense of their reputed author, the es-
teemed .# respected TALLEYRAND, who meant to say that
NApoleon The FIRST, when he murdered the Duc
D'ENGHIEN, did that which was more seriously mischievous,
his own position considered, than a private crime could be.
LoRD DERby also could not have supposed, until informed
by LoRD RAyrnsworth, that anyone could have misunder-
stood him. This was a polite way of informing the Times
that he does not read its leading articles. -
LoRD ST. LeoNARDs opposed an Irish Law Reform Bill
because it struck at the existence of dealings between
attorneys, and landowners, and transferred conveyancing
business to a Court of Record. If any reader hastily
imagines that because we are writing of a great, ve,
learned Law Lord, we must have written “opposed” in
mistake for “warmly supported,” that reader should look
d|to the Reports, and, though the statement is almost
incredible, he will find that we are correct. We shall
hear of his Lordship's opposing Vaccination next, because
it strikes at the existence of Small-Pox.
No. 1244.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
We thought that Irishmen never ran away from their wives. Our
own acquaintance with Irishwomen compels us to say that a man who
would abandon one of them is an ass whom it were base flattery to call
a rascal. But LoRD BELMoRE is passing a Bill to give relief to Irish
wives in such circumstances.
The chronicle of the week would be incomplete without a note that
the House of Commons had had a laugh at MR. DARBY GRIFFITH.. He
questioned MR. GLADSTONE on the fact that the Times announced, in
advance, the three main features of the Budget. MR. GLADSTONE said
that he had not desired such an anticipation of his statement, and that
he was quite sure that none of the clerks had split, especially as he had
not told them what he was going to do. To save unpleasantness, we
may as well mention that We read his Budget, ...; by means of
Spirits, and sent the points to the Times, because, publishing after the
speech, we could have made no use of them.
The Tea-Men have really a grievance. MR. GLADSTONE, last time he
reduced the duty, said that the arrangement was final. Therefore, they
bought largely, and ask for a drawback. . He frankly admitted that he
had talked Finality (it came of sitting so long near EARL Russell), and
therefore he agreed to postpone the Reduction until the lst of June.
After that, Materfamilias, mind your grocer. The Budget went mer-
rily through the Committee, and the Chancellor slashed cleverly at
the Anti Malt-Tax speakers. Does he remember that famous night, or
rather morning, in 1852, when he smashed at once a Budget and a
Ministry, and was specially vigorous against MR. DisBAELI for pro-
posing to º a House Duty, and take off half the Malt-Tax P It was
one of the t speeches we ever heard him deliver, for, having been
purposely prevented from speaking until very late, he was obliged to con-
dense his arguments with sledge-hammer hits? We never forget anything.
The Irish were funny to-night, MR. HENNEssy complained that the
LORD LIEUTENANT had struck all Irish music out of the Dublin
Exhibition programme, whereas there had never been any in it, unless
HANDEL is considered, in Ireland, to have been an Irishman because he
produced the Messiah in Dublin.
“‘To wake, to stir, to fire the soul he cornes,
And Jove's own thunders follow Mars's drums,
Expel him, Dulness, or you sleep no more :"
She heard, and drove him to the Hibernian shore.”
... Also some Irish Members, with MR, WHALLEy to aid, had a pleasant
little historical, discussion on King QLIVER CROM well's policy in
Ireland. We like these things—they show education.
Friday. The Committee of Lords have reported in the Brougham-
Edmunds-Westbury matter. Dear old HENRY BROUGHAM is spotless,
as England and Punch knew and said from the first. His brother has
to explain away a good deal, and we hope he will be able to do so.
EDMUNDs's conduct is condemned, and the CHANCELLOR is censured,
but is freed from all imputation of unworthy motives. LoRD DERby,
to-day, corrected an error in the report, and declared that the Committee
were unanimous in the qualified acquittal of Lord WesTBURy,
There was an interesting British Museum debate in the Commons,
MR. GREGory leading off. M.R. GLADSTONE did his best to remove the
idea that Government had sulked and shied the subject ever since the
House had peremptorily refused to assent to certain Kensington de-
signs. It is intended to increase the National Gallery, and a Museum
scheme is under consideration. Considering the vast quantity of cant
which is talked about Art, the condition of our priceless treasures is a
pleasing illustration of British consistency.
HELPS TO YOUNG DRAMATISTS.
HAVING already treated at some length of the commencements of h
various Dramatic pieces, we will now attempt to aid the efforts of the
young Dramatist, who may be at a loss as to the sharpest and most
telling Finish to his piece. We hasten to give certain forms
which, as before stated, will serve as most useful precedents. As in
some of the previous instances, the aspiring juvenile must fill in the
dashes, stars, &c., with names of his own choosing.
First let us take the finish of a Melodrama:—
ScENE—The Precipice of the Black Rock.
Three Stars (the villain, waving papers). I trium; yet! these papers—
[Murmurs heard without.
Enter Jo BLANK, hitherto the villain's accomplice.
Jo Blank. —are forgeries! Seize him " [Peasants seize THREE STARs.
Mary Dash. And the child—
Sir Richard Doubleblank. —was not drowned. She is—
The Child (who was not drowned). Here!
[Rushes into her Mother's arms.
All. Ah!
Three Stars (addressing Jo Blank particularly). Dog! (to every one
generally). Ha! Ha! (breaks from Peasants). Three Stars has lived a
bold and fearless life, and thus he’ll die.
[Shoots the Officer R. H., shoots the Officer L. H., throws Jo BLANK
into a corner. Waves his hand aloft, and jumps with a despairing
well over the precipice.
Lionel Two-dashes & his benefactor). What do we not owe you?
Mary. Ah! (embraces some one).
Lionel (advancing to the footlights). And if our friends in front will
only show that we have earned their smiles, then indeed shall all here
have good cause to remember the M-blank Da
Mary. —and the Maid of the Etceteraetcetera. [Curtain.
As all Plays must have a final appeal to the audience, it becomes
merely a question as to which is the best form of address. We strongly
advise the general use of “Our kind friends in front.”
cº-
THE TRAGEDY.
Let us suppose that some rising genius has written a Tragedy in
. Aes. Mind this is only a supposition, never, let us hope, to be
realISC01.
How shall he finish this Tragedy? Thus:–
Lady Doubleblank (supporting the dying form of Rollo in her arms).
He yet breathes! Water! Water! [Ereunt Domestics to fetch water.
Rollo (faintly, calling for another element). Airl Air!
[Domestics appear puzzled, and look at one another anariously.
Lady Doubleblank (to Dash, a villain of the deepest dye). This is thy
work, Dash!
Dash (who has recently taken poison). Ha! Ha! I tri-umph! I—
(ſeels qualms), I-what is this? (alluding to the qualms) my brain is
reeling ! I-(ſeels more qualms, and staggers), l faint—1—I die—and
(looking as maliciously as he can towards Rollo) my victim—is—Ah!
Rollo (raising himself on his right arm). Recovering !!
Dash. Ah! [Dies.
º (to Lady Doubleblank, faintly). Your hand, Mother-your
Sinks.
the Audience). My hand what good can that do thee? But if our kind
friends in front will only smile upon our efforts to amuse them (Rollo
dies) then—(perceives what has happened) Ah!
[Screams and falls on the body. Soto music. All take off their hats,
and stand reverently as the Curtain descends on the tableau,
[The above example, we venture to think, is a very happy illustration
of the neatest mode of appealing to the audience in the usual “Tag”
form, without interfering with, or in any way departing from, the
business of the play.]
THE COMEDY.
A Comedy finishes of course with a rhyming Tag.
Mrs. Dashstars. Well, me must speak a Tag.
Miss Stardash. Of course, my dear: .
Lord #. Blanks (alluding to Audience). And they’ll employ their
hands.
Miss Lucy Asterisk (pointedly). Yes, strike, but hear."
Etsetterer (taking his Wife's hand). W.eil, iſor one shall never “call
again.” (alluding to some joke in the piece). - -
Mrs. Etsetterer. No, you at least, my dear, cannot complain. (alluding
to something º
A Hunting Squire. Yoicks, tallyho!
His Grandmother. Be quiet, SAMPson, do.
Don't use your hands like that.
Mrs. Dash. His hands P. But you (to Audience)
Who’ve heard us plead, will kindly judge our cause,
And let your verdict be applause, applause.
For our success we’ve mainly you to thank,
Come every night to see Dash Three Stars Blank.
THE BURLESQUE.
The finale for a Burlesque is the simplest thing possible. Choose a
; tune. Preſix to the musical Tag a couplet, running in this
aShlon :-
If (to Audience) you are pleased, boys, girls, and Pas and Mas,
Then smile on Blankum, or the Magic Stars.
Finale.
AIR-Some popular one: a fast galop.
Oh, smile as thou wert wont to smile,
For all that we can say—

Chorus. Tiddleyum ti toodleyum ti toodleyum ti º: -
Toodleyum ti tiddleyum ti toodleyum ti day. [Curtain.
With this spirit-stirring, soul-inspiring Finale we leave the young

Of course it means nothing, but that doesn't matter.

his command, has made a sudden raid upon the cradle. This move-
ment has been frustrated by the rapid advance of the Government arms
under Nurse.
The rebel-leader has retired to some distance, but it is expected only
for the purpose of recruiting his army.
The Siege of Toy. 10:45 a.m.—The inhabitants of Noah's Ark were
violently aroused from their repose by a fierce cannonade from the
united forces of wooden and tin soldiers.
Little HARRY, in command, at once threw out such useless live stock
as the elephant with a broken trunk, the guinea-pig, the antelope with
three legs, the duck with one, and a couple of common flies.
The cannonade is still kept up by CHARLEY, the Major.
1050 a.m.—Capture of two distinguished foreigners in long coats

LETTER FROM A LADY-SPIRIT.
MY DEAR MR. PUxch, -
JN vain do we boast of the enlightened Eighteenth Century,
and conceitedly talk as if human reason had not a manacle, left about
her, but that philosophy had broken down all the strongholds of preju-
dice, ignorance, and superstition, and yet at this very time MESMER has
got £100,000 by animaſ magnetism in Paris, and MAINANDUC is getting
as much in London. There is a fortune-teller in Westminster who is
making little less. LAVATER’s physiognomy, books sell at fifteen
guineas a set. The divining-rod is still considered oracular in many
places. Devils are cast out by seven ministers; and to complete the
disgraceful catalogue, Slavery is vindicated in print, and defended in
the House of Peers.
I addressed the above remarks in September, 1788, to the Hon.
HoRAce WALPole. Information which I have received from various
hosts that have lately arrived in the Fields, induces me to take the
fl. of asking you how much, (besides names, and dates). I should
have to alter, were I to address the letter to his descendant, the Right
Hon. SPENCER HORATIO.WALPOLE, M.P., seventy-seven years later
than the date of the epistle I have quoted. I hear of Spirit Rapping,
Mesmerism, Homoeopathy, Puseyism, Phrenology, Fortune-telling, the
Divining-rod, the Defence of Slavery, and other characteristics of the
enlightened Nineteenth Century.
I will write to you again in 1942, and repeat my inquiry, mutatis
mutandis, if a lady may be pardoned for quoting in a classic language.
Believe me, dear Sir,
Your faithful Servant,
Elysian Fields, May, 1865. HANNAH MoRE.
P.S.. I learn that the theatre still survives. Do you not think that
the performance of my Sacred Dramas would effect much good?

A FINE IDEA OF PUNISEIMENT.
We abridge this account from an Edinburgh newspaper:—
“CoNviction of A STUDENT For TheFr.—On Saturday, in the Edinburgh Police
Court, CRoNE O'DELL BAYLEE, a young Irishman, who is well connected, and had
been studying medicine at the University here, was tried and convicted for theft, by
BAILIE MILLER. On the 6th inst he went with a cab to the Edinburgh Hotcl, and,
after remaining there a short time, he drove off, taking with him a top-coat and a
meerschaum pipe which had been ieſt in the smoking-room. On the articles being
missed, the ‘boots" of the hotel went in search of the student, and found him wear-
ing the missing coat, and the pipe was afterwards found by the police in a loan-office
where it had been pledged. The student on the following morning enlisted in the
Scots Greys. Shortly afterwards he stole the sergeant's riding-switch, and tried to
raise money on it at a pawnbroker's establishment, where it was detained. After
hearing the evidence, BAILIE MILLER found the accused guilty, and sentenced him
to find caution for £20, or suffer sixty days' imprisonment.”
Touchstone speaks of the “great virtue” which there is in an “if:”
and there is likewise, it would seem, great virtue in an “or” from the
mouth of a Scotch magistrate. But for the “or” in the sentence that
was passed on him, this young “well-connected” Irishman would now
be eating prison fare, and have come into close contact with the gaol-
house hair-cropper. To turn the virtue in the "or" to good account,
however, one must needs have a round sum of money in one's pocket,
or else possess connections that will kindly pay a fine for one. We
who live in * are used in certain cases to see fines imposed as
punishments, ut it is somewhat a new thing to us to see a fine
imposed for the committal of a theft; and lest, tempted by the “or,” a
lot of “well-connected” thieves might possibly spring up with us, we
have little wish to see the Scotch precedent adopted here.
Edmunds and Westbury.
THE Report of the Select Committee appointed to investigate the
Edmunds § amounts to this, that the conduct of MR. EDMUNDs,
in using the public money, has been too bad, and that of the Lond
CHANCELLOR in not exposing him, has been too good.

INTERESTING POLICE PROC EED INGS
AGAINST FREQUENTERs of THE WESTMINSTER COCK-PIT.
T the Bouverie
Street Police Court
lately a number
of persons were
brought before MR.
BULL, the sittin
Magistrate, charge
by the Secretary of
for the Prevention
of Cruelty to
Animals with Cock-
fighting.
The charges were
entered thus : —
John Evelyn De-
NISON, taking the
chair at the Barry
Arms, Westminster
(better known as
the Old Westmin-
ster Cock-Pit), was
charged with per-
mitting the place to
be used Fº #. pur-
pose o hting

LIAM TEMPLE, alias PAM, aliás the Tiverton, Pet, aliás, the Bottle-holder, Cam.
bridge House, Piccadilly, describing himself as “in the public line;” JoHN Russell,
32, Chesham Place, man of letters; WILLIAM EwART GLApstone, 12, Downing
Street, tallyman; Robert PEEL, alias WILLIAM ROBINson, of 4, Whitehall Gardens,
stableman, and known to the police in connection with “tips ' and betting offices;
H. BRAND, Treasury Buildings, Whitehall, whipper-in; for assisting in the
management of , the house and resisting the police : BENJAMIN DisRAELI,
1, Grosvenor Gate, literary man and yarn-spinner; JoHN BRIGHT, 40, Gloucester
errace, fighting man ; RoBERT Cecil, ll, Duchess Street, vinegar merchant;
ARTHUR Roebuck, 19, Ashley Place, dog fancier; BERNAL Osborne, no address
and no occupation, but getting his livelihood by reciting and tumbling at public-
houses; and a crowd of other defendants, for whose names, occupations, and
addresses we cannot spare space, for aiding, encouraging, and assisting in the
fighting of certain cocks.
MR. Inspector PUNCH appeared in support of the prosecution: the Prisoners
were undefended.
MR. Punch said he had been aware for some time that the House in which the
prisoner, DENISON was advertised as taking the chair nightly, was used for pur-
poses which the sº for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had been
instituted to prevent; such as rat-matches, jºić. Occasionally,
he had reason to believe, even bull-baiting had gone on there; at least he had on
several occasions seen a Buil in a state of the utmost exasperation, from treatment
in that House. The persons who were particularly active in promoting this fight
while he was present, were the prisoners, Cecil (who used very bad language all
the time) and RQEBuck, who seemed to be anxious to make matches with every-
body and everything. He had a famous dog, which he offered to back against any-
thing, from a rat to a rhinoceros.
.The prisoner Roebuck here offered to lay the worthy Magistrate 10 to 1 that
his dog TEAR'EM would pin and draw him (the Magi j as soon as look at him.
The worthy Magistrate declared that he never had to deal with such a trouble-
º customer, and that if he did not hold his tongue it would be the worse for
lin.
The prisoner Roebuck saucily rejoined that he never had held his tongue yet,
even at the bidding of the worthy Magistrate's betters, and never meant to. He
was at last, however, with some difficulty induced to be quiet, by the united per-
suasion of his fellow-prisoners.
The Prisoners, on being called upon for their defence, gave various explanations
of their presence at the Barry Arms, but all declared it had nothing to do
with cock-fighting. The prisoner BRIGHT sulkily said the whole thing was a
“plant,” as far as he was concerned. He had been insulted by some Swells,
and had gone into the house to punch their heads, when he had been nailed by
the crushers. He didn't understand why. Didn't see, any cock-fighting. Didn't
believe there, was a game bird in the lot he saw about the place—they were
regular dunghills most of them. The prisoner BRAND said the pits might have
been used for the pastime of cocking in former times, but lately the matches
had not been fighting ones at all, but mere innocent sparring with the “hots” (or
leather mufflers) on the cocks' spurs.
INSPECTOR, PUNCH, wished the prisoner. Russell to be asked whether he had
not expressed a wish, to back his old ginger-pile, cock “Reform” against the
risoner DERby's red-hackle “Aristocrat P* and whether the prisoner BENAMIN
#. * been active in promoting the match and getting money on DERBY’s
The prisoner RussRLL admitted he might have spoken of such a match, and
might have mentioned a young cock of his own breeding, called “Amberley,”
which he was anxious to enter for the Westminster Pit - but it was all chaff about
the Royal Society |d
the match. He knew well enough, and so did everybody
present, that his old cock “Reform" wouldn't fight. He
could only rest and be thankful. He had brought the
old cock in a bag, and would be glad to show him to
the worthy Magistrate. He had been a game bird in his
day, he would not deny, and had won him (Russell) a
deal of credit and some money; but he begged to assure
the Magistrate that his cock-fighting days were over. He
was respectably employed in an office now : his depart-
ment was the correspondence. He had a deal of it to do,
and liked the work, and believed he gave satisfaction to
his employers. The letters he had to write were principally
enouncing or blowing-up letters, and natural #.
the people who got them. That wasn't his fault. He should
be glad to read specimens of his letters to the worthy
Magistrate. This offer was precipitately but peremptorily
declined.
The prisoner PAM, (whose numerous aliases bespoke a
rather suspicious relation with the Office), and who seemed a
great favourite among his companions in misfortune, with
whom he kept exchanging a good deal of free and easy
“chaff” in an undertone during the proceedings, declared
the affair was all moonshine. The cocks weren't fight-
ing; they were only sparring to keep themselves in wind.
#: knew the difference and so would the worthy Magis-
trate, if he’d frequented the Westminster Pit as long as
he (Prisoner) had. He had seen games there, Praps the
best game was when they had the famous Bull bait, in the
second year of the Crimean War. That was something
like a lark. But the beaks had made no fuss then, though
a good many coves he knew lost their places, along of that
very bull-bait. Knew INSPECTOR PUNch very well, and
hoped he might be allowed to say he was very good friends
with him: a friend in the “force”, often came handy.
Would not deny he had fought a main or two in his time:
there was nothing he called real fighting now-a-days.
The prisoner CECIL, who showed much irritability under
the questioning of the worthy Magistrate, impudently said
he would not deny he liked cock-fighting, and didn't see
any harm either in that or a dog-fight—or a bull or badger-
bait either, for the matter of that. Roebuck was so cheeky
about his cocks, it aggravated him, and he put down, his
bird. Did not deny he had steel spurs on ; they might
draw blood, and inflict, a painful wound. He hoped so,
Didn't see what was the use of matching cocks without
spurs on. -
The prisoner Osborne said he only went to the Pit to see
if he could get employment, as, he had long been Qut of
place, and was anxious for an odd job: he had heard such
things were to be had in and about the Westminster Pit.
He appealed to MR. Punch if he had heard him say
ºf - - - -- - - - - - -
R. PUNCH said he certainly did not notice him takin
part in the match, but he was “chaffing” a good deal, an
seemed well known in the place. -
The worthy Magistrate said he was reluctantly obliged
to discharge the prisoners, as there wasn't sufficient evidence
of the actual fighting. in fact, it seemed as if they were
there rather to arrange the terms of a main, expected to
come off in the course of the autumn, than to fight their
cocks then and there. The police would keep an eye on
the pit, and he would take care that, so far as he was con:
cerned, no violation of the law should take place. He
then cautioned the prisoners, and discharged them. An
attempt at applause was suppressed. -
On their way out of the Court, the prisoners Cecil and
Roebuck got fighting violently in the passage, and were
separated with difficulty; on which the worthy Magistrate
directed they should both be locked up for the assault
on each other, it having been proved that neither began
it. PAM begged he might be protected against_BRIGHT,
who, he said, had threatened him with violence. He wasn't
afraid of BRIGHT, or any man, but he hated fighting, if he
wasn’t fairly forced into it. The Magistrate cautioned
BRIGHT that any breach of the peace would be severely
visited on him; and all the parties left the Court, appa-
rently thinking themselves lucky in having got off so easily.

PRIVATE VIEW OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY.

§ nºt ºst-wa-urt nºw
// --
º
N the 28th of April, dear Mr. Punch, you favoured me with
your card for the Private View at the Royal Academy (thereby
blotting out a private view of my own, with a holiday at the
end of it; but no matter, no matter, sufferance is the badge
of all our tribe), and instructed me, in something of a peremp-
tory way, to send you a report in time for your last publication.
I have always thought you London journalists in much too
great a hurry for articles. Some years ago, before I had the
distinguished honour of placing my abilities at the disposal of
Mr. Punch, I attended, in the capacity of an incapable reporter
|. I know no more of music than most of the critics of the
day) at a continental Musical Festival. It was interesting to
all inusical Europe. After the inauguration performance, some
oſ . accomplices, Frenchmen and Germans, proposed that we
should take carriages, and explore the lovely country around
us. “I will go, as soon as I have sent off my letter to
London,” says I, then full of a zeal which I have since domi.
nated. They all opened their eyes in wonder, and then opened
their mouths to declare that } was an eccentricity. About
four days afterwards, some of them began, at their extremest
leisure, and by way of relaxation from dominoes, to write reports
to their own papers, but when I left at the end of the week,
nobody had got beyond descriptions of the scenery and con-
pliments to the ladies of the place. The lesson dwelt in m
mind, and I, resolved not to be hurried in future, unless }
could not help myself. To have written about the Private
View in time for the last Punch, would have hurried me very
much, as I wanted to go out of town, and as I could help
myself, I did.
But I went to the Private View, Mr. Punch, Sir, as you
may ascertain if you doubt me, by demanding at the Academy
a view of the sheet on which I and many other Swells signed
our names in order to procure re-admission after going out to
lunch among the ladies at FARRANce's. I saw, with my own

eyes, the colossal Primate of England, and the venerable author of the
History of the Jews (who was writing, rationally, on certain matters
when DR. C*L*Nso was a small boy) and MR. DISRAELI, who I perceive
was seen by, the flippant person who writes your Essence ºf Par-
liament (which I offered to write, and you coarsely refused to allow
me to do), and the distinguished Lady of Secrets and Sensations,
and a t Poet, and many Academicians, who were affable to
me, and the ubiquitous Bishop AGATHoN, and the prettiest and
cleverest of our young English actresses, and some critics, whom I

tricks and their manners, as the Person of the House observes.
It did not occur to me when you thrust your ticket and commands
upon me in your overwhelming and steam-engine manner, bustling me
out of the sanctum before I had time to light a cigar, to ask you what
I was to go for, or what you wanted me to say. Do you desire criti-
cisms on 1077 works of art? I can send them, of course, in batches of
fifty, which, arrangement will bring my letters to an end in twenty-one
weeks, finishing as pheasant-shooting begins. Or will you be satisfied
with a meat and novel statement that there are many works of genius,
some of average merit, and many which deserve neither praise nor dis-
paragement, while we would rather be excused from speaking of the
remainder P I am the most docile of scribes, and whether epigram or
epic be demanded, I instantly sit down and write it. “Payme well, and
order what you please,” is the motto that hangs over the mantelpiece of
the tasteful apartment in which I receive my customers. . But when I
an left totally without instructions, I am sure to send you just what you
didn't want, and to tread upon the corns of some of your friends and
pets, that is to say, to write truthfully. I wish you would give me
only such subjects, as Logarithms, or the Conservation of Forces, or
the Differential Calculus. Though some people are so awfully sharp-
sighted that they would discern allusions even in a treatise on these.
The Spectator used to complain that if he mentioned a church and a
pudding in the same page, he was said to be insulting the clergy. I
suppose that if I say that this is the Ninety-Seventh Exhibition, I shall
be told that I am accusing the Academicians of being in their senility

You will naturally demand the meaning of that conventional typo-

lence it is a fitting Ideal Symbol of the Inconceivable. The explana-
tion is yours. It has flashed on my mind that May is the Poet's Month,

of Rime. Poetry and Painting are sisters—hence poets and painters
hate, one another like cousins. Will you kindly allow me to do the

EXCITING CONTEST AT CAMBRIDGE,
By the time these words are published, an interesting competition
will have been decided in the Senate House of the University of
Cambridge. A valuable prize will have been contested y no less than
nine Clergymen, and the contest of the “sacred nine,” if it verify the
anticipation º in “University Intelligence,” will have been “a
sharp, one.” The bone, so to speak, of contention, which will have
been borne off by one of those reverend divines, is, as a native of the
Emerald Isle might say, a bit of fat... It is a bone that has a consider-
able quantity of meat on it, being, the Rectory of Ovington, a living
whereof the gross value is £436, with a house, whilst its population is
only 400; so that the winner of it will find himself in the comfortable
circumstances of liberal remuneration with little to do.
Not for a moment, however, must it be supposed that the love of
ease and idleness has had any influence whatever in pitting nine holy
men against each other in a sharp contest for the valuable and unex-
acting Rectory of Ovington, The sphere of usefulness constituted by
a living that comprises only 400 souls, is physically limited; but its
very limitation in a physical sense allows of so intense a devotedness to
the cure of those souls as to render it capable of indefinite moral and
spiritual expansion. Put the nett value of Ovington Rectory at £400
a year, equal to the figure of the population; the souls would be curable
at £1 per animan per annum; and, if the souls were so cured as they
ought to be, that would hardly be too high a rate for the cure of them.
Suppose, however, that the souls of the Ovington rº. do not want
much curing, the appointment to cure them would be a comparative
sinecure. But then its zealous and industrious holder might devote the
leisure it would afford him to the cultivation of learning, to the confu.
tation of †. and Dissent, the dissipation of doubt, and the recon-
cilement of theo º with the natural sciences. Therefore, if we cannot
exactly ascribe the hard struggle of those nine candidates for the
Rectorship of Ovington to the ardent desire that spiritual physicians
might feel to concentrate their energies on a small and select practice,
let us refer it to earnest wishes for scope to advance the science of their
profession. - -
The living, of Ovington appears to imply, long life, for the late
incumbent, the Rev. Edward SIMons, held it fifty-four years. MR.
SIMons, without any Simony, won it in 1810 against DR. Blomfield,
late Bishop of London, who, if he had become the incumbent of such
a snug benefice, might perhaps have been seriously inclined to say
Nolo episcopari. The certainty of an income above £400 a year, and
therewith the necessity of labour restricted to the obligation of minis-
tering to a population so moderate as one not exceeding that number
of pounds, are conditions which may be conceived to be eminently
favourable to longevity. That is to say, in the case of a reverend
bachelor; though many a curate, having married on £100 a year, would
doubtless regard Ovington as a faradise that would need to be by no
means exclusive of an Eve.
To the foregoing remarks we may venture to add a positive contra-
diction of the statement that the nine reverend competitors for the
Rectory of Qvington, contended for presentation to that uncommonly
good living by the exertion of jumping in surplices. That is a way in
which the race for Church preferment could be run, or even thought of
being run, only by the most extreme professors of muscular Christianity.
The candidates vie with one another in good works, and the best man
and best scholar invariably wins. So especially considering the age
which MR. SIMons attained to, we may say “Long life to the winner of
Ovington!”

structive, but a
constructive also.

LORD EDES-
DALE objected to
a bridge over the Strand, LORD REDESDALE may go to Bath, insert his head into
the hot water, and keep it there till we send for him. How are the lawyers to get
across without a bridge? Are the precious lives of the learned to be put at the
mercy of those accomplished ruffians who drive Vans over people? Are we to lose
half-an-hour waiting until the street shall be clear? Or are the Inners and the
Middles to charge the enemy, as in the glorious fray,
“When down came the Templars, like Cedron in flood,
And dyed their long lances in infidel blood.”
We have sworn by St. NEPOMUK (he was thrown over a bridge and martyred,
and hence was made patron saint of bridges) that we will have a Lawyerduct. The
Athenaeum proposed that Temple Bar should be used for this #. but as its
chamber is notoriously haunted by the ghosts of people whose heads have mouldered
on the top, we fear that ladies who go to consult their legal advisers in the Temple
might be terrified. We ought to record, by the way, that we have never seen a
†. ghost looking out at the window on the City side of the Bar since the
railway obstruction blotted out St. Paul's.
LoRD HARTINGTON admitted that LQRD CHELSEA had made one leap from
the junior captaincy of the 3rd Middlesex militia into the Major's place,
taking nine captains, some of many years' *; in his jump. Further, he
justified the wonderful feat in the frankest way, by saying that it had been
permitted because LORD CHELSEA is a nobleman of influence and position in his
º: A fiend has just whispered us that his Lordship, having been born at Durham,
may be useful when militia are mustered. . But as militia are not mustard, but
soldiers, we confess ourselves utterly unable to comprehend what the fiend means.
MR. CAIRD very properly demanded of SIR CHARLEs WooD what he had done in
reference to the astonishin º of SIR CHARLEs TREVELYAN in India.
SIR. C. the first said that he had not h
º various members of the Indian Council, and signified to them that he
would not allow export duties to be laid on the staples of India. The staples, we
should explain, do not mean parts of locks, which, indeed, are little used in the
East, except for purposes of navigation, but Principal Commodities. Somebody
has chalked all along the Marylebone Road, Educate the Poor. It is our business
to educate the rich.
MR. MASON Jones, a sort of orator, and clever, we are told, in his way, in-
geniously managed to get a carpital advertisement out of LoRD Elcho, by asking
that good-natured Volunteer to correct his account of something, Joses was
reported to have said about MR.W. E. ForsTER. So Jones got a whole paragraph
in the debate, and it was headed with his name. Well done, Jones; Punch gives
you another fift for your smartness.
SIR GEORGE GREY said, without laughing, that the L.-L. of Ireland had not
stricken any Irish music. Qut of the Dublin Exhibition programme, Talking of
that, we heard a story which will be understood in Ireland, and also here by those
who know the difference, between lawful and unlawful whiskey. “Your brother's
been made an L.L.D.,” said somebody to his friend. “Has, he, by jabers” (all
Irish persons swear by jabers), said the other: “An ‘I.L.D.' I'd rather be apotheen
D.” We were going to send this to the Dublin Exhibition, but it was so heavy
that our cab broke down.
The BAINEs Debate was resumed—there was a crowded House, and a sensation,
People said that MR. GLAPSTONE was going to answer MR. Lowe, but people said
the thing that was not. The Debate had two points of interest. First SiR GEORGE
GREY, for Government, would not vote #. the Bill, but he declared that the
Administration would not be bound to a £6 franchise, nor would he undertake that
time to understand, the subject, but had ||
any large Reform Bill should be brought in next Sessiºn.
The Ministry would be guided by Public Qpinion. Secondly,
MR. DISRAELI avowed his belief that his as well as the
Liberal attempt to carry Reform Bills, when the country
did not want them, had been a mistake, but he was in favour
of a large extension of the suffrage, not downwards, but in
a Lateral direction. Punch likes to conserve a fortunate
#: Lateral Reform is a fortunate phrase. The Par-
iament that effects it will be known as the Lateral Council.
There were good speeches from MR. ForsTER, MR. HoRS-
MAN, and MR. STANsfeld. The Working-Man cannot
complain that he is not, talked about. Every statesman
undertakes to photograph him. The only thing is that no
two portraits are alike. Finally, the Previous Question was
carried by 288 to 214; majority # for dropping MR, BAINES's
duced a Bill for Bill
Tuesday. So much of the Edmunds Scandal as has been
caused by the grant, by the Lords, of a pension to MR.
EDMUNDs was atoned for by the solemn revocation of that
rant. There was a long debate, over which the LoRD
HANCELLOR presided, in silence.
R. WHALLEY, amid laughter of course, asked SIR
GeoRGE GREY, whether he would bring in a Bill for pre-
venting English clergymen from declaring in a witness-box
as MR. WAGNER of Brighton has done in the Road
urder case, now revived by the statement of Miss CoN-
STANCE º that they will not divulge what is told them
under the seal of confession. Srr GEORGE's answer may
be imagined. MR. WHALLEY sniffs Rome in every breeze
and we wonder that he has not given notice, that he will
call attention to the new Eleanor Cross, at Charing Cross,
and ask whether Protestants who are going, to eat white:
bait at Greenwich ought to be exposed to the humiliation of
beholding that Popish symbol as they go in for their railway
tickets. But for the Seal of Confession—as MR. SKETCH-
LEY's admirable Mrs. Brown observes, “No, WHALLEY, says
we, we don't hold with that, says we. if he’s a Roman,
says we, to Rome let him go, but he shall make no seals
out of Protestant wax, says we, if we know it. The egg-
cup, for it’s dry work talking theology, WHALLEY.”
"Giansrong was pleased to be humorous in answer
to a question about the General Election. The questioner
called him a Prominent Member of the Government, for
which he ºr. his thanks, but said that the ...;
of an Oxford Committee (his own) that the election would
take place in the second week in July, was not made on the
authority of the Prominent Member. This condescension
pleased the House, and it laughed with the great Financier.
SIR WILLIAM PAYNE-GALLwey, Baronet, we name him
in full in sign of approbation, made a strong attempt to
force the railway people to give a means of communication
between º and guards. In reply it was said that
the companies had been discussing 196 inventions, and
none would do. Which Bishop is to be the victim whose
fate will cause the right thing to be affixed on every line in
England in, forty-eight hours, or, will the Company-Deities
accept an Archdeacon? We admit that taking away the
advertisements from newspapers that dare to record acci-
dents on the lines is a step in advance, but even that bril-
iant invention fails to satisfy the public entirely... We
intend to travel with a large Revolver, which, at need, we
shall fire at the first Signal-man we pass after we are
alarmed. His executors will have a good action against
the Company, and then we shall get upon the jury, and
give £10,000. -
Great fun those Azeem JAH pétitions. They have been
signed by hosts of folks who have no more idea who Azeemſ
JAH is than they have of the Man in the Moon. Signatures
have been obtained at a penny apiece. Something is due
to decorum, even in a farce.
Wednesday. A cheerful Church Rate debate. MR. New-
DEGATE had a plan, whereof not much need be said, as
it was '. % 126 to 42. Government opposed
it, MR. KINGLAKE objected to it, as perpetuating the rate.
MR. HEYGATE delivered a neat hit at the ºf party,
whom he charged with systematically hindering all efforts
to settle the question, because they Fº its existence
as a grievance. MR. HADFIELD said that Dissenters were
very loyal to the House of Brunswick, and therefore ought
not to pay a tax of which they disapproved. The argument
is a good one, and we shall adapt it to circumstances next
time the Income-Tax collector appears at our residence.
MR. Locke's Theatrical Bill then came on, but as he
felt it his duty to begin with a history of the drama for the

last three hundred years, with sketches of the plots of all the plays,
and biographical notices of the principal actors, the clock cut him
short at a quarter to six.
Thursday. LoRD WestBURY carried his Bill for turning the County
Court Judges into little Lord Chancellors.
A Gas Company proposes to extend its works at Chelsea, and the
Bishop of LoNDoN made a strong protest against the poisoning the
children, and the flowers, and against the pollution of the Thames. We
hereby, applaud the good Bishop, who, unlike divers ecclesiastics,
recognises his duties to the bodies as well as to the souls of his flock.
We usually abstain from noticing things that are only going to be
done, but we do just as we please, and all that we do is for the best.
In the exercise of our unlimited discretion we mention, as part of the
history of the American war, now supposed to be concluded, by
Johnston's surrender, that Government was asked whether it had
determined to withdraw its recognition of the Confederates as belli-
gerents, and that SIR GEORGE GREY desired a postponement of the
question. ---
The rest of the night was given to the Union Chargeability Bill,
which the “country †. ” oppose with much, doggedness, and the
debate was adjourned amid vociferations, and the exchange of witti-
cisms, as became grave senators. We suspect that in justice to the
Speaker, who in vain struggles with a disorderly house, we shall have
to re-enact the law of the Duello, for Parliament only., Small swords
and pistols to be kept in a Committee Room, and seconds to be chosen
by ballot. Any member bellowing at another, to prevent his being
heard, to be liable to be called out. We shall regret having recourse
to a barbarous device, but anything is better than the transformation
of the House into the likeness of a vulgar Westry.
Friday. LQRD SHAFTESBURY...called attention to a frightful social
evil of which few have any idea. There is, in the prºvince; an organised
system for obtaining the agricultural labour of children. They are hired
in Gangs, by persons usually of low and brutal character, †. let out
the unfortunate boys and girls to the farmer. The result is cruelty and
yice. The Bishop of LincoLN corroborated the Earl's statements.
The Crown is prayed for inquiry.
The CHANCELLOR, in answer to LoRD WesTMEATH, of whom he
made much grave fun, intimated that an English Clergyman has no
confessional #. and Lord CHELMsford, lawyer and Conservative,
regretted that MR. WAGNER had not been sent to prison.
The BISHOP OF LONDON desires to put down mock-Catholic per-
formances in his churches, but finds it difficult to obtain evidence.
Sermon-hunting Snobs write him anonymous letters as to what they
say that they have seen, but skulk away from giving available testi-
mony.
MR. CAVE showed that Postmasters are underpaid, considering the
work now thrown upon them. The system induces some of them to
discourage, or at all events not to, aid the Government in regard to
deposits and annuities. Any official so acting should be dismissed, but
the rate of remuneration .# to be made liberal. The Post Office has
a large surplus, which should be expended in improving it—we ought
not to pay taxes to the postman.
The Clock Tower is to be finished, no new buildings are to be erected
in the square; there is to be a tunnel for members, that they may not
be run over in crossing to Parliament Street; Mr. Herºeſſ is to
pºint for the House, and £10,000 has been voted for a Fire-

A SQUALL IN SUFFOLK.
Our Eye is everywhere, and we have an I for
Ipswich. That interesting metropolis is in a
rage. The Royal Agricultural Society was ex-
pected to fix its 1866 meeting there, and behold
the meeting is to be held at Bury St.Edmunds,
perhaps in compliment to the Chancellor—LoRD
CHELMSFQRI will understand us. The Ipswichers
and Ipswitches think that they (especially their
hotel and lodging-house keepers) are wronged.
But speaking in the interest of visitors, we
don’t see it. The strongest argument urged in
an able and vigorous protest, in the Ipswich
Journal is, that people can easily get out of the
town, whereas they cannot get out of Bury. We
admit that few persons who †. been at Ipswich
are unduly desirous to remain there, but then Bury
is a particularly clean place, rich in antiquarian
interest, and altogether tolerable as a temporary
residence. There are the remains of the Abbey,
also of the late MR. CoRDER, and the Norman
Tower, and Ickworth, with its eleven mile park
and all sorts of things to see, when one is tired
of the men whose taſk is of bullocks. As for
Ipswich,-for, further particulars apply to Mr.
Pickwick. We recommend it, to resign itself
to fate, calmly, and to resign the beast fºe, civilly.

PICTURES OF THE WORKING-MAN
AT THE ROYAL WESTMINSTER ExhibiTION.
IN one point at least the Royal Westminster Exhibition, now open
in the sumptuous quarters provided for it by the late MR. BARRy, may
be said to be quite in the spirit of the times. It is º; “a
working-man's exhibition.” Not that the exhibition of Liberal and
Conservative R.A.’s is like the Show now open in the Floral Hall, or
those lately established in the Agricultural Hall at Islington, or the
Lambeth Baths, one exclusively or chiefly of working-men contributing
the products of their industry or the amusements of their leisure.
Indeed, we should like to see more working-men in the º more
evidences of industry, and better employment of leisure. But this may
be called “a working-man's exhibition” in the sense that it includes a
vast number of pictures of the working-man. Indeed, The Working-MAN
seems to be quite the fashionable subject with the Westminster painters.
They are as devoted to him as REYNoLDs to his old Beggar-Man,
Romney to LADY HAMILton, or MR. ABRAHAM Coopea to his White
Horse. We counted above a score of pictures of him, and then we
stopped in dismay. It may be thought th. such repetition of the same
subject would be wearisome. We know, however, that if two painters
sit down to paint the same subject, two very different pictures are sure
to come out on their canvasses. So, in this case, where more than
twenty limners have set themselves to delineate “The Working-MAN,”
we find the most extraordinary variety in their pictures of him. We
cannot pretend to pass all these works of art in review, or to pronounce,
with any decision, on their comparative merits, whether of daring
invention, curious one-sidedness of perception, or painstaking truth to
nature. "Let us hope that a true portrait of that mysterious being,
“THE W.-M,” might be arrived at, if by some critical process we
could extract from all these very dissimilar representations such essence
of truth as they respectively embody. But at present, after careful
study of all these pictures, we must honestly confess, that we have not
- -
arrived at the faintest notion of what this W.-M. is really like. One
thing is clear, that if all these features really belong to him, he must be
the most remarkable individual living. Indeed, we cannot understand
by what accident he is not at this moment being exhibited in St. James's
Hall, or under articles to BARNUM. He ought to be an immense draw,
as an exhibition in himself, for he may be described, in the showman s
terms, when he spoke of the lions and tigers in the same dºn, as “the
greatest combination of discordant nature now travelling.”. But we
despair of ever seeing the W.-M. for a shilling. He is the Great
§§. of the present day, and may rank with another mysterious
entity—also represented in the most diverse styles and with the most
contradictory attributes—the Coming Man. The more we think about
it, the more puzzled we feel as to this mysterious W.-M.
How, if the Working-MAN be the working-man, does he find
time to sit to all these artists? Unless, indeed, sitting to artists be
the W.-M.'s only work. In that case he comes under the category
of a professional model, and of course transforms himself at the will of
the artist. If so I can't trust the pictures of him a bit, more than I can
those of the yellow-haired, long-jawed !"; lady who sits to all the
Pre-Raphaelites, and comes out now as Belinda, now as Nenoe, now
as the }. f Endor, now as Mary Magdalen, and now as Mariana
in the Moated Grange. And how do all these artists manage to get
sittings of the W.-M. P. Do they work in batches, firing away at him
with porte-crayon and drawing-board from all points of the compass,
as the students do with the Langham Chambers model. Or do they
track him on the sly, as the artists of the illustrated papers hunt a
British Prince, distinguished foreigner, or a great criminal; , sketch
#" flying, and get him on the canvass, unawares, and when he is off
is guard. -
#so, this may help to account for the vast lº of these pictures.
But in that case the fact ought to be acknowledged in the Catalogue.
Instead of the bare repetition of the same title, Portrait of the Working
Man, why not give us explicit #." as “the W.M. building up
the social edifice;” “The W.-M. pulling down the fabric of society;

“The W.-M. at his beer; ” “The W.-M. over his books;” “The
W. M. improving the shining hour;” “The W.-M. worshipping Saint
Monday;”. “The W.-M, wallopping, his missus; ” “The W.M.
informing his mind; ” “The W.-M. drunk and disorderly;” “The
W.-M. regenerating the world.”
We conclude by a notice of some of the most striking of these
numerous pictures of this puzzling original." -
1002. The Working-Man. (R. Lowe.) Boldly and highly-coloured, but
with an almost Caravagiesque darkness in the shadows. MR. Low E's
ſº power of hand occasionally carries him away, and like RUHENs,
e is often careless of drawing, in his violent foreshortenings, and deter-
mination to get effect.
The scene of MR. Lowe's picture is a public-house. The working-
man is seen pondering over his pipe and pewter, while BRITANNIA hi.
before his eyes a balance containing the franchise in one scale, and 240
ots of beer in the other. The W.M.'s eyes are fixed intently on the
eer, and the scale with the franchise kicks the beam.
450. The Working-Man, (John BRIGHT.) A work of a highly ideal
order, couleur de rose predominating in the tone, and the whole figure
painted as QUEEN ELIZABETH insisted on being, without shadows, and
with a forcing of all the high lights which destroys any natural effect
the design might otherwise have possessed. Indeed, ſº the picture
had been described by this title in the Catalogue, we should have called
it Portrait of an Angel gazing at the Setting Sun. The character of
the work can only be accounted for by supposing it to represent the
W.-M. in his future state of glorification or apotheosis, and we presume
the setting Sun is that of England, which MR. BRIGHT is fond of
painting “going down.” MR. BRIGIit, in this picture, has fallen into
a fault very rare with him, excessive use of the sweetner, and has mixed
such an enormous quantity of oil and varmish with his colour, that we
fear the work can never stand exposure to the light.
1001. The Working. Man. (Edward HoRSMAN.) MR. HoRsMAN is
one of those erratic and eccentric geniuses, whose work it is extremely
difficult to criticise; its cleverness is unquestionable, but this is accom-
panied by an oddity and habitual defiance of rule, which will always
prevent the painter from taking that rank in his profession to which he
evidently aspires. He seems to prefer the most unexpected lines, and
the most startling combinations of colour. In this picture he has
borrowed a notion from HogaRTH, and paints the W.M. in the act of
sawing down the beam which supports the Crown, regardless of the
fact, that he himself will certainly come down with it. The idea is
extravagant, and the design has no prototype, we are convinced, in
nature. But as a purely artistic performance, the effect is very
striking.
451. The Working-Man, (W. E. FoustER.) A piece of bold imagina.
tive invention, which, till we looked at our Catalogue, we took for a
portrait of GALILEoin his cell, or a philosopher in his study. The W-M:
is represented as absorbed in the task of mental improvement, and all
the light of the picture is concentrated on the head of the figure, which
must be admitted to be a very noble, benevolent, and intellectual con-
ception. How far it is like its original we would rather not pronounce
an opinion. A very close scrutiny reveals a pewter pot and a pipe
thrust into the shadow under the table. Beneath the feet is an emble-
matical design, meant, as far as we can make it out, for the seven
deadly sins. -
These may be said to be the leading varieties of treatment to which
this most Protean sitter has been subjected.
: It would be a comfort to know which the W.-M, considers the best
likeness of himself, and we should be glad to learn this from his friends
and acquaintance. Our own impression is, that the painter of the
W.-M. has yet to be sought for, and that we shall not find the great artist
who is competent to do justice to this subject till the long expected and
often deferred arrival of the C. M., or CoMING MAN!

MY LORD LOFTY ON, THE EDMUNDS SCANDAL.
A JoB is a job; indignation won't mend it,
And every man wants his job done in his turn;
So throw Epm UND's overboard, and let that end it,
After all, he’s been found out, and that’s his concern.
Everybody's done something that won’t quite bear probing,
But, probes are not tools to be used upon Peers;
And Truth seldom is pleasant, if after unrobing,
We expose the coy goddess to newspaper sneers.
No doubt it was wrong in the Pension Committee,
If they knew the paw-paw things poor EDMUNDs had done,
Not to button their pockets and bottle their pity,
And let down the unfortunate man by the run.
And no doubt it was wrong in LoRD WestBURY, rather,
Not to tell the Committee of EDMUNDs’s tricks;
But only consider his feelings as father,
Reluctant his son's name in scandals to mix.
He had settled that EDMUNDs’s place at the table,
Should be filled by his SLINGsby, in regular course,
And tried, as was natural, all he was able,
A humane and decorous reserve to enforce.
And as for poor EDMUNDs—one had heard a rumour,
There was something not right in his patent-accounts;
But one knew he was lazy, and just of the humour,
To make little slips in his cheques and amounts.
After all, office business is managed so loosely;
Book-keeping's a thing that no gentleman knows;
And poor EDMUNDs, no doubt, did his duties obtusely—
He never could see past the end of his nose.
But then we all knew, and upon the whole liked him,
Though perhaps at two thousand we might think him dear;
And supposed from his º if we quietly kicked him,
None would miss such a sum as eight hundred a year.
The affair would have blown very quietly over,
Had it not been the rumpus kicked up by the Star;
But those penny-a-liners, of course, were in clover,
With our House to bully and bring to their bar.
Committees are party arrangements, but not less
The Committee report's, no doubt, perfectly true;
One’s glad the old BROUGHAM from the mess comes out spotless,
Though it certainly does leave some dirt on the new.
Lord WestBURY has been a little incautious,
And in feathering his nest, p'raps, a leetle too keen ;
But this virtuous horror is really too nauseous,
As if other folks' hands were so mightily clean,—
As if other noblemen hadn't relations,
As if places had ne'er been vacated before,
To satisfy loving parental impatience,
And feed the young Twists who come “asking for more.”
Such prudish hypocrisy’s very disgusting:
For my part I like a thing called by its name;
And when penny papers their noses are thrusting
Among Peers and their Pensions,—I call it a shame!
It’s o'erstepping their functions, which stop at the Commons,
It’s insulting our order, sans peur, sans reproche :
It’s degrading the woolsack, and my name and no man's
Is safe, where such levelling doctrines you broach.
There—the Pension's rescinded—let that end the matter:
Those who’ve nothing to do with 't, the better for them :
least said's soonest mended—so hush all this chatter—
The more that we stir it the more it will—hem
Well Done, Dunne.
Amongst the Parliamentary Notices of Motions the other day was
the following:—
“Colonel. DuNNE,--To ask why the third instalment of the Delhi prize-money
has not been paid."
However objectionable a practice dunning in general may be, in, this
particular instance everybody except the bad paymasters who keep back
the Delhi prize-money, will admit Colonel. DuNNE, in acting as a dun,
to have done good service.
No 1215.”

Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory, on the 24th of April, th
President of the Royal Society in the chair, it was resolved to
entreat, the Admiralty to maintain their former decision, and ex-
clude all railways from the Park.”
The reason that prompted this deplorable decision to
try and º railways out of Greenwich Park, was the con-
sideration, from ascertained facts, that the oscillations
caused by the trains would be sure to disturb the scientific
operations going on at the Observatory there. What a pity
there is an Observatory in Greenwich Park | No doubt
there are romantic, unbusinesslike people who wish that
there were one in every park, and every other pleasant place
whose beauty and repose are, as they fancy, in danger of
being disturbed and spoiled by hissing, puffing, screech-
ing, reeking, and odoriferous railway trains. The Iron
Horse is a good thing, but, in the opinion of these weak
persons, there may be too much of a good thing, and they
think that the from Horse has #. down so many
lovely scenes, that they have had something too much of
the Iron Horse. Ordinary horse-worship, they allow, may
be tolerated, as harmless absurdity, but they consider that
the worship of the Iron Horse, which sacrifices everything
to its idol, is becoming an insufferable nuisance. Iron
– Horse worship, moreover, associated, as it mostly is, with
- the worship Of the Golden Calf, seems to these sentimen-
talists a sordid and contemptible idolatry, the abomination
of whose desolation ought to be limited. Owing to their
º º: it may be long before we shall have railways

THE Seal, at the Zoological Gardens, in justice to the
governors of that delightful place of instruction and re-
creation, presents his compliments to Mr. Punch, and begs
to state that he, the writer, is a thorough Protestant, and
with the now notorious Seal of Confession.
A ROW AT HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE.
UNDER the signature of “A YouNG MAN FROM THE Country” a
Correspondent of the Morning Post complains of annoyance inflicted
upon him on the evening of Saturday last week, in a stall at Her
Majesty's theatre, by the noise made by a party in a pit-box on the
right side of the house not far from the stage, talking and gabbling
incessantly and loudly during Act 1 and half of Act 2 of the perform-
ance, when they left, of their own accord; not turned out or removed
by the police.
Talking at the Opera, let young men from the cºuntry, and other
rustics and inferior persons know, is “the thing.” It is “stylish,” it
is “nobby,” a practice usual with the right sort of people who mean to
show that they understand what is what, and are up to the usages of
the nobility and gentry. . It bespeaks the cream of the cream, the
supreme of the superior classes, whose superiority is such that they
are above listening to music, however good, and how well soever
executed, or indeed listening to anything whatsoever but one another's
small-talk.
The Opera in course of performance whilst these superior people were
chattering was Norma, with TITIENs for the heroine, and SIN1co for
Adalgisa ; and the “Young Man from the Country” says that he
expected “a great treat” from their singing, of which the conversation
of the stylish party in the pit-box interfered with his enjoyment. Norma
is a work of some genius, and TITIENs and SINIco are singers of the
first excellence; and the disregard of BELLINI's music, of their execution
of it, and of the desire of the mass of the audience to hear it, argued
the good breeding of those who interrupted it with their genteel dis-
course. Had not people moving in their sphere of society heard Norma
often enough before, and what were they to care about it or about the
creatures who wanted to hear it? If the Opera had been Il Flauto
Magico, or Don Giovanni, they would have talked all the same, only
louder, to show their superiority even to MozART, that is supposing
them to be aware that MozART is considered by judges of music to be
anybody in particular. What were they at the Opera for P To talk,
and look about the house through their loronettes and flirt. There is
only one Opera that persons of this quality could ever be expected to
attend to, but to that they might pay some attention from sympathy
with the principal character in it: La Traviata. The “Young Man
from the Country” innocently enough remarks:–
“It mattered not what was sung—to them chorus, duet, or solo were all one, and
their discordant harsh voices were heard to the annoyance of more than myself.
Let us hope that this letter may come under the eye of this party who might as
well have stayed at home for any interest they had in the performance.”
If his complaint about ºf at the Qpera should come under the
eye of the talkers, they will only laugh at finding that they have given
annoyance to a serious listener. “Ha, ha!...That was you and me,”
they will say in their colloquial manner. , Wishing to give additional
vexation to the vulgar who gravely object, to their “distingué” habit
of talking at the Opera, they might, in lively º: with the pecu-
liarity of the place, improve upon it another time by substituting, for
ordinary dialogue, recitative. Their “discordant and harsh voices”
would then produce an effect amounting to the creation of an absolute
disturbance; for which, with all due regard for their quality, the
Manager might possibly give them in charge, and they might be walked
off like other disorderly persons in the neighbouring Haymarket.

Roºs WANTED, by two gentlemen, living a few miles out of town

three or four months. The bed-rooms may be anywhere, but the sitting-room must
be on the ground-floor. The attendance must be perfect, and the rooms and servants

Mr. P. will much oblidge his umble servant, MRs. F., if he will please

and a blot on her carackter, as ought at least to be apologised if not a

rºylar, her furniture she will say is fit for any gentleman, and it is a
wicked calomel to talk about her servant being “overworked, and

blacking and cleaning of the knives and forks, and washing up the

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
oNDAY, May 14, The
Indian Officers'Griev-
ance was brought be-
fore the Lords, and
strongly urged by
LoRDs DoNOUGH-
MoRE and Hough-
Ton. It may have
been impossible, in
transforming the
§ Company's army into
the QUEEN's, to avoid
some awkwardnesses,
but the brave In-
dians, who saved the
Indian Empire, de-
serve to be treated
with all considera-
tion, and not, as
Lord Lyveden said,
in a shabby and un-
fº spirit. LORD
UFFERIN made the
best sort of official
buffling defence he
could, and stated
that the difficulty had
been that of the man
who had to put thir-
teen men into twelve beds, giving each man a bed to himself. This illustration was
a flagrant instance of aristocratic officialism, devoid of precise information. The
affair is a game, and it is a case of eleven beds—but the superior classes can never
understand anything; here, give us a pencil. There, up in the corner, we have
sketched the thing as it is, and—stop a minute—there, Lord DUFFERIN, there you
are, with a slate. Now, perhaps, you can understand. The Subject Dropped, as the
gaoler said to the surgeon when bringing the latter something for dissection.
LoRD Houghton, in the Lords, asked a question which was also asked by MR.
White in the Commons. LoRD Russell answered in the Senate, and the
PREMIER in the House of Representatives. The question was, whether Govern-
ment would withdraw our recognition of the Confederates as belligerents. The
answer is a double |.. ave they ceased to be belligerents? and do the
Re-United States declare such to be the case ? Our course must depend upon that
of our friends, the American Government. Let us hear what they say.
LoRD PALMERSto.N has been ill, and to-night made his re-appearance. He was
tremendously cheered by both sides, MR. DISRAELI cheering as heartily as the rest.
The PREMIER's, arm was in a sling, but that did not prevent his, putting a

at the first moment to renew his nag about the Times getting the heads of the
Budget before the speech, PAM made him a jocund kind of answer, saying that the
journals made guesses, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and that he was quite sure
nobody in the Government had betrayed secrets, and so on—all a laugh at MR.
DARBY GRIFFITH, and accepted by the House “in like gamesome mood.”
The Excluders of the Poor from the Parishes rallied for a new fight, but under
the eye of the Schoolmaster were much more decorous than when the excellent
usher, GREY, had charge of the School. , Still, a struggle was made to get the Bill
referred to a Committee, so that it should not pass this Session, but Mr. Punch's
rebukes, and the expressed opinion of the country, produced their effect. The
Obstructive Exclusives were defeated by the enormous majority of 266 to 93. We
may as well continue the odd story. The Committee was taken on Thursday, when
MR. HENLEY, who had headed the }.} made an Ugly Rush on his own
account. He proposed a clause for prohibiting the Removal of Paupers at all, under
any circumstances. As soon as MR. WILLIERs could take breath he expressed his
joy over the repentant sinner, bu', translating the Sibthorpian formula, said that
he feared such a Greek when he brought a present. The Henleyan suggestion was
understood, and rejected by 184 to 110. We hope to see it law, but the change
must be made with care and forethought, not as a political dodge. The Greek got
rather personal, but MR. GILPIN acted as peace-maker, and the Bill went through
Committee. The spirit of the Excluders may be learned from the Greek's last
words. He said that the measure ought to be entitled one “for relieving the towns
from their fair burdens.” Joseph ' Don't. You know better. Look at
Mr. Punch's Cartoon, Joseph.
Tuesday?A Bill for permitting Local Authorities to dispose of * instead of
sending it into our rivers, was brought in by Lord RAVENsworth. We fear that
it is too mild to be of much use. One of these days, London, whose hands are now

by defiling the water that is to come down to her." it will be the incident of the
Wolf and the Lamb, only that Lamb London will show fangs like a Wolf, and be

made to do it. ... We have not paid Three Millions to Sir Thwaites to have our river

about the Bass Rock, Stanfield. As he did not, we say for

GLADSTONE that he would not stand any more of it, for,
later in the week, the CHANCELLOR, whom few dare badger,
stated that the House should know all in Government's
good time.
The Examinations for the Indian Civil Service were the
theme of a debate on their utility. There is no doubt of
their utility. MR. CochRANK thinks that they are too severe.
They are not too severe. How many more times are we
to say this? The Dunces, certainly, have most zealous
friends, and we really want another Alexander Pope.
The LoRD ChanceLLOR has been wrong in the Edmunds
matter, has been brought to account, and has been declared
wrong, and censured. That is well. But it is not well
that such persons as MR. FERRAND should be encouraged
to go on nagging and nibbling at LoRD WestBURY on two-
penny matters connected with a relative who has caused him
annoyance enough and to spare. A full explanation was
given by the ATToRNEY-GENERAL of the circumstances in
|. and then MR. FERRAND, who cares as much for
elicacy as a rhinoceros cares for Eau de Cologne, began
again, and demanded to see SIR. RoundELL’s private letters
on the subject. The lofty author of the Book of Praise
then gave MR. FERRAND something which the aforesaid
rhinoceros would have felt, but we dare say the Member
for Devonport did not feel.
Wednesday. On the previous night MR. MorfATT began
a speech on Bankruptcy, and was Counted Out. To-day,
| incensed, he gave notice that he should move to insert in
the Minutes the name of any Member who should Count.
This he means as a sort of punishment. Bosh!. The
| Counter is felt to be a noble Institution, and his still small
voice fills the Reporter's Gallery with rapture. Those
gentlemen will never name him, we hope and trust, and if
they do not, all is serene—who reads Minutes? But the
House will not alter a wholesome rule to please an ang
man. It is a remarkable fact that people who are wort
hearing can keep a House.
MR. Monseli's Bill for getting rid of the offensive part
of the Roman Catholic Oath, was heartily abused by the
Irish Tories, and by MR. Whalley (amid laughter), and
strongly supported by SIR George GREY for the Govern-
ment. It was read a Second Time by 190 to 134, but the
Newdegateers announced that it was to be attacked again,
in force. The fewer oaths the better. They are notoriously
useful in Courts of Justice, for there are thousands of
people who will lie in the most hideous manner, but will not
swear to a lie. But, we imagine that in, a few years a
simple declaration will be all that is required from those
whom their QUEEN or their countrymen have thought
wº of trust. - -
Irish Dogs are to be registered, for which privilege
they are to pay Sixpence, and then they are to pay an
Income-Tax of Two Shillings a-year. But there is to be
no oppressive, compulsion, only the police are to shoot all
defaulters. We wonder that the same simple course is not
adopted in regard to our own Income-Tax.
Thursday. Above hath been described the principal sport
of the night. The valuable Partnership Bill went through
Committee. It does not apply to partners in a round game,
who are still at liberty, especially if engaged couples, to
cheat in the awful manner which gives so much annoyance
to screws and old maids.

This new Bill's a bore,
Rating land's gentility,
To make us maintain our own poor
In spite of our hostility.
The burden we used to evade
With comfortable facility;
But the money will have to be paid,
Through Union Chargeability.
Well we worked the clown,
In his days of juvenility,
When his hair was black or brown,
We taxed his strength and agility.
To his parish we sent him away,
In indigence and senility,
For his keep not forced to pay
By Union Chargeability.
We used the labouring man
While he had any utility,
Any other plan
Accounting puerility.

But a due very hard to shun

Which way now to turn.

Though we’d gladly learn,
With studious docility.
But we shall be forced to bear,
In meekness and humility,

Regardless of abuse,

Unmindful of contempt

brewers, ironmasters, and engineers, overflowing with ready cash, and boasting
gigantic balances at their bankers' "
Yes; and see what a vast improvement has taken place of late years
in the character of the landed interest. How much more generous and
liberal the new English country, gentlemen are than the old English
country gentlemen were ! Consider in how great a degree, for instance,
the modern landlords, the successful speculators and manufacturers by
whom the ancient gentry have been º bought out, have practically
as well as legally, relaxed the Game Laws, which no doubt they will
shortly simplify by declaring all game property; in fact, doing away
with the distinction between wild and tame creatures altogether.
The law of trespass also; how leniently that is enforced by them!
Even where the commons, open from time immemorial till lately, have
been enclosed, you can go anywhere and do anything so long as you
keep in the public highways, and don’t go aside into the fields to gather
mushrooms or pick flowers. Hurrah for the New Landed Interest

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
,-
HANDBOOK TO THE ACADEMY DINNER.
MR. PUNCH observed with extreme sympathy (shared by his friend
the Spectator, to whose very smart article on the subject Mr. P. paid
the tribute of an affable smile the awful, difficulty felt by the big and
little wigs at the Academy Dinner. The Academy gives its feasts to
uests who usually know and care nothing, about pictures, but who,
eing more or less great persons, are intensely dear to Flunkeyism. To
et i. large and small Swells on their legs in answer to toasts is the
appiness of the Academy. But the happiness is all on one side. The
poor Swells have to connect their own trades and callings with Pictorial
Art, and lamentably clumsy is, generally, the junction. This year the
affair presented so many miserable spectacles that Mr. Punch resolved
to say nothing on the *ºf theme, especially as the Spectator had
said much, and said, it well. But his never slumbering instinct of
humanity has caused him to consider whether he can do nothing, to
alleviate the woe occasioned by Academic flunkeyism, and he finds that
he can do something. He has º a set of Starts for º
Orators—a set of beginnings, which he commends to the study of
persons who get asked to the dinner.
A Beadle. MR, PRESIDENT, I do think that there is peculiar fitness in
the toast of the Beadles of England being offered, at your Academy.
For as the Beadle precedes and clears the way for the minister of reli-
gion, so does a love of Art, which emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros,
prepare and clear the mind for the reception of the highest lessons.
A Great Railway Contractor. Sir, the toast with which you have
honoured me is happily an easy one, for the connection, between a
railway and painting is too, obvious to be overlooked., What, Sir, is
the object of a railway. To do away with distance, and bring far-apart
scenes within the easy reach of all. And what, but that is the work of
the painter, especially the landscape painter, like MR. (here name any-
body you choose, only mind that he is a landscape painter).
An Eminent Surgeon. SIR CHARLEs,...my profession is one which
especially links itself with your own. When performing an operation,
I deal with life; when dissecting, with death. And SHAKSPEARE has
said, that the living and the dead are but as Pictures. .
A Rich. Butcher. MR. PRESIDENT, I could not fail to expect the
honour of being called on, for the fortunes of your vocation, and mine
alike depend upon a single circumstance, , What, Sir, would be thought
of your pictures, what would be thought of my legs of mutton, if both
were not well hung P
An Electioneering Agent. I rise, Sir, with gratitude, but without sur-
prise, for unworthy as I may be to reply to a toast so eloquently
proposed, I feel deeply that my occupation and that of the painter have
a common bond. When I am at my work, and when he is at his, both
are engaged upon our canyass. -
A Deputy Lieutenant. Sir, at first sight it may not be obvious what
is the connection between Deputy Lieutenants and Painting, but I
think that if any one will cast his eye on yonder brilliant wall he will
understand the fitness of this toast. It is a Deputy lieutenant’s
business faithfully to represent the Lord Lieutenant, and the great
artist who has executed yonder picture of LoRD Wodehouse, has
represented the Lord Lieutenant with equal fidelity.
º who goes up in Balloons. Really, SIR CHARLEs, I am not
much in the habit of speaking, but on this occasion can feel no difficulty,
for my favourite pursuit is indissolubly linked with an important feature
in your art. I allude, Sir, to aerial perspective.
A Member §ſ Parliament. MR.PRESIDENT, I must approach my
theme with a “Joseph Miller.” We used to be asked in childhood
why Titian's fat daughter, MARY, was like MR. Pitt, and we were
told that it was because she was called the Great Foº Tiriºn. Sir,
I am a humble Politician, but I can admire, the painter I have named,
and also the gentlemen I see around me, who emulate his &c. &c.
4 Knight ºf the Garter. Sir, the connection between Painting and
Knights of the Garter is too obvious, for comment. It must give any
man happiness to receive a noble Order, and I dare say that my pleasure
in my installation does not exceed that of any artist here, when a dealer
calls upon him and commissions him to execute a work.
A King. Sir, it gives us much pleasure to unbend for a moment of
* and to take our place at your festal board. It pleases us also
to think that there is one pºint in which the position of ourselves, and
of artists is exactly alike. We owe everything to oil. Without oil,
we could be no King, you could be no painters.
A Master of Hounds. Tallyho, hoicks, harkaway! We are all on the
same scent here, SIR CHARLEs, hay? The one thing which I think of,
and the one thing which you think of, is the Brush. Tallyho, hoicks,
harkaway !
A Rich Pork-butcher. Sir, the connection, between pork-butchery
and painting may not at once occur to you. But, Sir, when I mention
that I acquired my art late in life, that at fiſty I did not know what a
pig meant, your pigment—(roars of laughter, and you need not finish).
There are a dozen Starts for the guests of the Academy, and Mr.
Punch has taken care not to run the risk of want of success by raising
any of them above the standard of Academic wit. But any invited
uest of next year, who may want himself fitted, has but to address a
irected envelope and a twenty-pound note to Mr. Punch, and he shall
receive a special opening for his oration, and thus be spared aiding in
the "...# lamentable spectacle caused by the Academy's resolve to i.
great 10lks.
MR. HENLEY ON HIS BACK.
(In reply to the statements in MR, SIMON's Blue Report on the Dwellings of
the Labouring Poor, MR. HENLEY said, “Old as I am, and half
worn out, if I could do wothing else, when such charges are made, I
would lie on my back and halloo “Fudge / as loud as I could.”
Wide Report of Debate on the Union Chargeability Bill.)
SAys Orator HENLEY, although I am old,
And all constrained postures must grudge:
Could I do nothing else, I would lie on my back,
And to SIMON's Report would cry “Fudge.”
Well along way I’d trudge to hear HENLEY cry “Fudge,”
Till he couldn’t cry “Fudge’ any longer;
But a fact is a fact, and a fact will not budge,
But the more “Fudge” is cried, sticks the stronger.
When Bumbledom’s “Fudge” can wipe Pauperism out,
Feed hunger, and nakedness cover:
When Rascaldom’s “Fudge” can on honour throw doubt,
And from right to wrong build a bridge over:
When the courtiers’ “Fudge” from KING CANUTE can stay
The tide rising furious and frantic;
When DAME PARTINGTON's “Fudge” helps her broom's vain essay,
And restrains the advancing Atlantic:
When the traveller's “Fudge” keeps the avalanche back,
That the sound of the word has set falling :
When the vine-dresser's “Fudge” can divert from its track
The Lava stream o'er his vines crawling:
When Egotism’s “Fudge” out of filth and foul air
Can eradicate fierce fever-leven;
When Unbelief’s “Fudge” can prove Hell isn't there,
Or Atheism’s “Fudge” wipe out “Heaven:”
We will take HENLEY’s “Fudge” as a crushing reply
To the statements that fill Simon's blue-book—
Proof, the labourer's cot is not too oft a stye :
And the Registrar's file not a true-book.
BEER AT THE OPERA.
MR. PUNCH !
CAN I believe my eyes? What do I see in a notice of an
Qpera in the Morning Post with reference to the new tenor, SIGNOR
BRIGNOLI, and another eminent Italian singer at Covent Garden?—
“His M'appari tutt' amor' was encored; so too was the famous 'Beer Song
given with the utmost jollity by Signor GraziAni.”
This at the Italian Opera!. A Beer Song ! Beer, actually Beer,
gross, common, vulgar Beer. What next The Beer Song, I suppose,
that horrid song called Beer, occasionally heard resounding . a
Public-house, with that coarse burden invoking a dreadful imprecation
on the Government in the event of their ever attempting—
“To rob a poor man of his beer?”
Beer! In the good old days of the Opera, when the Opera was the
Opera, and there was no other Qpera; the Opera in the Haymarket,
had the word Beer been mentioned-breathed—whispered in the atmo.
sphere of otto-of-roses and eau-de-Cologne, everybody would have
fainted. I assure you the announcement of a Beer Song as not only
sung, but “given with the utmost jollity” by SIGNOR GRAziANI, has
almost been the death of
Brummel's Place, May 1865. An OLD DANDY.
P.S. Beer! An Italian song of Beer! With accompaniments on the
Barrel Organ? Oh!
OPOPONAX EXPLAINED.
Of late much advertised, a word
Folk’s curiosity now racks,

The word Opoponax.

SIMPLE SIMON laid a crime on

Said SIMPLE SIMON, “Tell me why men

Says HENIEy, “Fie, man!” to SIMPLE SIMON,
‘Your facts ain't worth a penny.”

He got extremely well abused,
And not so well defended.
He called the Squires to do their part,
And thought he could not fail
Because he showed a state of things
That turns one sick and pale.
Then SIMPLE SIMON went a-hunting,

THE MODERN ART OF ILLUMINATION.
MR. PUNCH,
--- THE other day I was pleased to observe the following admo-
nition on a card fixed up inside an omnibus:—
“Buy your cigars only of the manufacturer, where 1 lb. can be had at the whole-
sale prices.”
This is the sort of interesting precept which you read everywhere in
all frequented places—in the streets, at the stations, in the public con:
veyances. Somewhat varying the remark which Hanguo, on his arrival
with, Duncan at Macbeth's castle, makes about the “temple-haunting
martlet,” a misanthrope might be inclined to say, with respect to
London and most other large towns in England:—
“That bubble-monger,
The advertising tradesman, doth approve
By his bold puffery that humbug's dodge
Tells doingly here; no scaffold, shed, or hoarding,
Dead wall, or scope of frontage, but this quack
Hath spread his giant prints and staring posters.
Where they most flaunt and flare, I have observed
The vulgar congregate.
On, every place ayailable for a notice, whereon your forefathers
would have inscribed “Tempus fugit,” or “ Memento mori,” or somethin
equally doleful, we now encounter such pleasant intimations as “Tea
Tea!! Tea!!!”, or an agreeable exhortation, for example, to “Furnish

WERY LIKE A-SPIDER,

is thus thrillingly described:–

to descend from an ancient web that is said to have existed for many-years. The

terror and excitement followed. When Arachne was captured she was found to be,
with legs extended, nearly five feet long. She weighed six pounds.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. –----- 21:
THE AIR AND EXERCISE BILL.
Give me your attention for a few moments. I wish to see the above-
titled Bill introduced to the notice of the House. I will tell you why.
This we will call the Pre-amble of the Bill. -
The other day, Sir, your dyspeptic contributor whoº: these lines,
was ordered by his medical adviser (the Chemist and Druggist in the
neighbourhood) to recruit his health by taking air and exercise. “You
had better, Sir,” said the Chemist, and Druggist, “take a good ride
every day.” “A good ride, eh?” said I, hesitating from various
reasons, which need not be mentioned here...“Yes,” said he, “deci-
dedly.” He added that there was nothing like it; and I have since
come to the conclusion that he was perfectly right. .
The difficulties of procuring an animal exactly suited to a gentleman
of far from strong nerves, and equestrian powers (limited), are many an
reat. That they are not absolutely insuperable, I am aware from the
act that a Livery-Stable Keeper, to whom, under seal of confession, I
had committed my necessities and my self mistrust, called on me the
other morning with the information that he had got the verything for
me—“A little 'igh in the action, p'raps,” said my professional stable
adviser, “but she’s been recommended to me as a clever’ack.”
“That sounds well,” I observed, and I really thought it did. The
precise idea conveyed to my mind by the word "clever,” I cannot
exactly describe. #...ºf did not wish to exhibit more ignorance
of the subject than was absolutely necessary, and so as long as, I was
pretty certain that “clever” did not mean waltzing on his hind legs to
the circus tune from the Bronze Horse, lying down at a given signal, or
taking supper with the Clown, I determined to hold my tongue,
“I’ll come round to your place, and see the animal,” I said, for I
could not recollect whether my professional gentleman had called it a
he or a she, and in uncertain cases I prefer the use of the above gene-
ralising term. - -
“The 'ack,” says my professional, “is standin' at your door.”
This was a startler.
“Oh!” said I, dubiously. , I had not the moral courage to say that
I was too busy to try her (or him) that morning, lest my adviser should
despise me as a coward. So we went to the front door, where a groom
ºkeeper. or a somebody “horsey,” with gaiters on, was holding
a horse.
“She’s a showy, fanciful sort of animal,” was my adviser's remark.
“Yes,” was my reply, given dubiously, as if I didn't altogether agree
with him on that point, though I hadn't the slightest notion of what he
meant by “fanciful.” I think now that he didn't know himself, and
was laughing at me... -
“Yes,” said I, feeling myself called upon to say something. “She’s
a pretty colour.” -
She was a pretty colour, that’s certain; but what, that colour was, is
uncertain: it was neither black, nor white, nor black-and-white, nor
grey, nor Fºl. nor roan, nor cream, nor brown. It might have been
bay; but I’m not quite clear as to what “bay” is.
* I ji just throw my leg over her, and then you can see her paces,”
* º friend, obligingly.
e threw his leg over her in a second, and was master of her before
she knew where she was. She was as quiet as a lamb, finding that the
Centaur on her back wouldn't stand any nonsense.
“What do you think of her ?” I asked the groom. This was cun-
ning on my part, as I thought he’d be inclined to speak the truth when
his master was out of the way.
“She’s a gentleman's 'oss, every inch of her,” says the groom,
emphatically. -
“Yes, I think —” I began, but stopped, not having settled what
I did think.
“Yes, Sir, she is that,” said the groom, as though I had uttered
some profound opinion. I felt that I was in the hands of the groom
and his master. They were, for the time being, my superiors; for know-
ledge is power, specially knowledge of horses as opposed to ignorance
ºf those animals.
“You’ll like to throw your leg over her, won't you, Sir?” inquires
my adviser, dismounting.
I did not like, and he knew it. But I wouldn’t refuse.
She certainly was a clever 'ack; I became more and more convinced
of it every moment. First of all she was clever enough to discover that
she was no longer ridden by a Centaur, and taking advantage of this,
wouldn't stand still to let the stirrups be properly adjusted. The con-
sequence was that they never were properly adjusted. Nor the reins
either; for a more perplexing complication { never encountered. On
one sideſ was tugging at the curb, on the other at the snaffle. On
being remonstrated with by the groom, I pretended that I knew all
about it, and that that was my peculiar way of riding. I told, the
groom as haughtily as I could, and in a much louder tone than I wished,
In consequence of my gallant steed bearing me away, “To call again in
an hour.” Oh! that hour ! . Shall I ever forget it? Never! And that
clever 'ack | Shall I ever forget her! Never, never, never, never!
On my return, for the clever 'ack kindly consented to bring me home
again, being sufficiently clever to recollect the road and turn all the
corners sharply—I say, on my return, I drew up the following list of
what I want, suppressed in the Metropolis, for the convenience of
equestrians who require air and exercise.
So ends my Amble and my Pre-amble. Now for the Bill.
Give me, Sir, your powerful assistance to bring the matter, in a Bill
before our Parliament now sitting.
That for the benefit, safet ºfwelfare of all Her Majesty's Eques-
trian subjects, Her Majesty's Government shall at once suppress—
All street brass bands, specially the one with drums.

TWO CONSTABLES.
THE elegant London Correspondent of our excellent but Tory friend
of the Bristol Times and Mirror remarks as followeth :—
“Gallant old Sir John Fox Burgoyne has at last received some reward for his
long services. He has been made Constable of the Tower, and was inducted, or
invested, the other day, with much military ceremony. This noble old soldier has
been serving us since 1798, and never better than when he went out to the Crimea,
as Lieutenant-General: , I may add, that a more kindly and courteous gentleman
does not exist, and all his personal friends rejoice in his having attained a reward
which, or rather its equivalent, should have been his years ago. Long may he
wield the baton of the Tower of London, a staff long grasped by his intimate friend,
the Great Duke.”
In the spirit of this paragraph, Mr. Punch needs not to say that he
heartily concurs. But the writer appears to have been under the im-
pression that the gratitude of BRITANNIA to the brave veteran who has
served her so long and so well had descended to the common-place level
of pecuniary reward. Mr. Punch noticed that some of the London
journals stated that a splendid addition was made to the gallant soldier's
income. BRITANNIA has done nothing of the kind. SIR John BUR-
GoyNE merely receives what is, doubtless, a gratifying compliment,
and BRITANNIA is just as much obliged to him as she was before, or
rather a little more, because he has something to do as Constable of
the Tower. But one who served in Egypt and at Corunna, through
the Peninsular War, and in North America, was wounded at Burgos and
St. Sebastian, *i. the Public Works in Ireland, inspects all the
Fortifications, was Lieutenant-General of the Forces wherewith we
reduced Sebastopol, and is a D.C.L. of Oxford, is not the man to take
account of a trifling increase of duty. He and PAM, Constable of Dover,
are the two oldest and most vigorous members of the Force, and we
hereby drink to the health and long life of the Two Constables in what
our American friends call an ice tod.
OPERATIC.
WHAT has become of ALBONI?, Many to whom this, question has
been put have answered, “I don't know,” thereby exhibiting most
culpable ignorance. It is with feelings of the deepest regret that we
came across the following piece of information, in the course of a notice
of Lucrezia Borgia, wherein it was said, the Brindisi was encored, “an
encore,”, it added, “first extorted by the memorable execution of
A1Boni.”
Oh no, Sir, don't say so. Did the sweet Contralto turn a rebel spy,

RATIONALISM.
“Now, you OLD DEAR, Is THAT THE way you would LIKE Us To wear our SAshes?”
AN ARABLAN NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT.
My DEAR EPICURUs, - - - - -
Did you see that exciting bill of fare, particularising the
supper given to NAPOLEON at the Mustapha Palace in Algiers? No?—
then read, mark, learn, and ideally ruminate and digest it:-
“Soup of the tortoise of the Bondouaou, relieved by a lººp. garnished with
antelope kidneys, quarters of the Ouargian gazelle, and loins of young wild boars
from the Oued Hullouf. Entrées—salmis of Carthaginian hens, antelope cutlets,
and bustards from the Chotts. Roasts—an ostrich from the Oglat Nadja, and hams
of the wild boar. Side dishes—sciouiams of the Hammah, ostrich eggs in the shell,
jelly of pomegranates from the Staoueli, Arabian pastry, ouidas, macroudes, scerak-
boracs, and oribias.”
EPICURUs, I don't know how to spell the words that would best
express the feelings which I experienced in perusing the foregoing
catalogue of delicacies. Try and suck up an imaginary spoonful of the
most exquisite turtle soup: the noise of inarticulate rapture which
you will make in so doing is what I would write, but cannot compass
its orthography. Phthrrrup! No, the attempt is a failure. Think,
EPICURUs, what I would pen.
There was a good old woman who derived unspeakable comfort from
the mere names of Phrygia and Pamphylia. So do I from Bondouaou,
and Ouargian, and Oued Hullouf. The soup of the tortoise of the
Bondouaou must be something superb; the Ouargian gazelle is surely
a love, or so to speak, not minding the solecism, a duck; a creature far
dearer than any animal of its kind that any poet ever nursed to glad him
with its dark fond eye. How soft and tender the loins of young wild
boars from the Oued Hullouſ may be inferred to be from the euphonious
name of their native place | Salmis of Carthaginian hens is doubtless a
repast that might have regaled HANNIRAL, if he lived like a ºf
cock as he was; notwithstanding the objection that the fighting coc
HANNIBAL, had he dined upon hens, would have fed like a cannibal.
Antelope cutlets!—why they .# prevent an elopement º the
counter attraction which they would exercise—in my case at least.
Bustards from the Chotts!—one fancies that one could eat them till
one burst, if one had not learned to govern one's animal nature, and
hold it in subjection. I wonder how much you and I should leave of
an ostrich from the Oglat Nadja. Ver
hams of the wild boar to follow-pièces
sistible indeed. -
But the dish that tickles the palate of my fancy above every other is
that of the Sciquiams of the Hammah. , Sciquiams!, The sound of the
word has a strange affinity with that of requiem, but with a difference
of consonants, suggesting succulence. In eating sciquiams I imagine
I should enjoy a profound tranquillity together with a fine flavour; I
conceive that sciquiams would exert a soothing effect on the system,
induce a sense of repose of mind and body, and marvellously comfort
the digestive organs.
Is it possible that ostrich eggs in the shell beat plovers'? If they do,
how great and good they must be Jelly of pomegranates from the
Staoueli–sweets from the sweet, no doubt. Arabian * of course
included some of that cream-tart so delicious to read of in the Arabian
Nights. From the delicacies that concluded the repast at the Mustapha
Palace, I surmise the EMPEROR must have “snatched a fearful joy.”
Ouidas, macroudes, scerakboracs, and oribias, I take to be insects
robably of the locust tribe, unless scerakboracs are a sort of spiders;
or, as you know, spiders are esculent, as proved in the case of the
young lady who used to eat them spread upon bread, like raspberry
jam. But enough—would it were as good as a feast.

that a very large amount of duty was paid in 1863, and 1864 on

Works. anufacturers
are too ready to put the
pot on without regard to
the noses of their neigh-
urs.
MR. DARBY GRIFFITH
made avery properspeech
upon a subject which at
once enlisted public at-
tention. This was the case
of CoIONEL, DAWKINS, It seemed to have been resolved by the Military Authorities
that this officer should retire. The reason, so far as we can make out, was that his
temper, or manner, was not *F to certain other officers, and that they did not
desire to be commanded by him. Two courts of inquiry (upon the composition of
which Courts, and, the official º that they would decide in accordance
with the views of the Horse Guards, several things are said) had been held, and the
result is that Colonel, DAWKINs has been crushed. One member of the last Court
CoLoREL DE BATHE, protested, in a gallant and manly way, against what appeared
to him to be injustice. The Parliamentary Colonels, as usual, were displeased that
the House should be appealed to on a military subject, and the Government, of course,
took the same view. Mr. Punch has the pleasure of tºº agreeing with
MR. BRIGHT that the House of Commons is the final court of appeal for an
aggrieved subject of the QUEEN. MR. GRIFFITH did his work very well, and too
a division, but it had not been expected, and many Members had left, but 112
supported him on the motion for papers, against 172. Later in the week the subject
came up again, when I.QRD HARTINGTON, having had time to get up the subject,
gave an explanation which showed that Colongſ, DAWKINs's unpopularity was not
unnatural or undeserved, but which otherwise left the grievance just where it was.
The last onslaught—or rather the last but one—was made on the Bill for
£ºf Exclusion of Labourers from Parishes. MR. KNIGHT, who, according
to the infallible Dod, is descended from a considerable ironmaster in the time of
CROMWELL, made a proposal for taking about a million and three-quarters out of the
present taxation of the country, and applying it in aid of the Unions. The suggestion
savoured less of the iron than of the brassmaster. M.R. WILLIERs denounced it as
wild, and it was tamed by a severe speech from MR. GLADstoNE and a decided
negative by the House. On Thursday, after a long speech from MR. HENLEY, and
two protests, which, when we name the makers, will at once convince the country
that the Bill is a wise one–MR. Brºntinck and MR. KNIGHT protested against it-
this righteous and valuable measure was read a Third Time and passed. Now for
the final and deciding heat, three times round the woolsack.
Tuesday. LORD CHELMSFORD has the old instincts of the profession which he
followed before he took to the law—no, we are not going to write before he began
to spell navy with a k, because the joke is old, and also slanderous, and most
lawyers are honester men than most men. But he gallantly resolved to º and
rescue our captives in Abyssinia. LoRD Russell deprecated interference, as likely
to be resented by the Dusky Tyrant who sits on the throne of RAsseias. We
should like to tie him into a chair, and let a mumbling curate read his ancestor's
history to him for six weeks. His remains should then be presented to Surgeon's
Hall. Loºp Russell, however, has sent him a letter }. the QUEEN, and
presents. But LoRD CHELMsFoſºp divided, and there was an odd muddle over the
vote, but at last it was settled, and the Sea-Chancellor won by a neck—one neck.
MR. MAGUIRE stated the case of the paper-makers, which is disastrous. The
abolition of the Paper Duties has not been followed by similar liberality abroad, and
it is contended that in these circumstances we ought to impose an export duty on
English rags. MR. MILNER GIBson made the usual Free Trade answer, and the
more consolatory one, that some nations were abolishing, and some reducing their
duties. MR. MAGUIRE's motion was defeated by 140 to 95.
What a Bear Garden may be, we, who do not live in the days of the Virgin
Queen, are unable to say. But the word sticks in the memory of unimaginative
people, and they use it when they wish to say that there is a disgraceful disturbance.
A Music Hall, when a favourite buffoon is too tipsy, or too sulky to oblige the cads
with an encore, would be an illustration more in accordance with the manners, and
bad manners, of the day. The old word was applied to-day to the House of
Commons, because MR, WHALLEY, talking nonsense, and
worse, was received with odd noises, and the usual invi.
tation, to sing. He talked about Hopish ractices, and
wished Parliament to put them down, as if the good sense
of the people of England did not teach them to laugh at
such follies. Had MR. WHALLEY, confined himself to
absurdity, it had been well. But he made a statement
against MR. WAGNER, of Brighton, which the Star justly
calls “a most serious and shocking charge,” and MR.
WAGNER has, in print, described MR, WHALLEY's conduct
as “cowardly wickedness.” The accuser has since said
that he spoke only of rumour, and that if he has done
injustice he will make reparation. But when it is known that
the “rumour” on which a Member of the English House
of Commons spoke, was that a clergyman of the Establish-
ment, in order that an institution might obtain the benefit
of a lady's legacy, deliberately placed that lady within the
reach of infection from ſever, we º there will not be
two opinions as to the conduct of MR. WHALLEY, or the
resentment of the clergyman who is accused of treacherous
murder. It was matter of course that MR. WHALLEY’s
absurd proposals should be º condemned by SIR
GEORGE GREY, but the shameful feature. in the case
removes it, out of our jurisdiction. We distinctly state,
however, that a person who has so little self-restraint is
wnfit, until further educated, for a seat in the House of
Commons, and upon public grounds we invite. his con-
stituents to consider the propriety of re-electing MR.
WHALLEy.
With the assent of Government, a Committee was ap-
pointed to inquire into the circumstances attending the
resignation of the Registrar of Bankruptcy at Leeds, and
the appointment of his successor. This motion is aimed at
LORD WesTBURy, but MR. MALINs, a Conservative,
avowed his belief that many charges against that noble-
man will prove unfounded.
Wednesday. The Houses did not sit. QUEEN VICTORIA
was born on the 24th of May, 1819. An improved style of
Illumination, is getting popular. Coloured cut glass, with
strong light behind, is the most effective thing out in the
way of expression of gaseous joy.
Thursday. The Lords did not sit, because it was Holy
Thursday, and there are Bishops in their House.
The Commons, who are not so blest, did sit-passed the
valuable Bill already mentioned, and the Partnership Bill,
and then the County Bank Notes Bill went through Com:
mittee. There was a smart debate, in which no person will
take any interest, seeing that it is agreed, by common con-
sent, that the Čurrency Question and its issues, which
concern every one of us more than any other conceivable
subject, shall never be mentioned in rational society. , Who
cares about the Currency? There was ten thousand times
more excitement at the news that at 414, this day The
Duke was scratched. Beside the effect on betting men, this
event has taken the sentimental feature out of the Derby. It
no longer includes an equestrian struggle, which had a great
interest for the ladies, though the horse which their amiable
liking for a little harmless revenge induced them fººl,
to put gloves on, is not taken out. He may beat the field,
but that will be a tame victory, for he cannot win the battle
of Hastings.
It is not weather to talk of Fire (except the pleasant one
with faces in it, Miss HERBERT's face included) but it must
be said that we are to have a new Brigade, under the con-
trol of SIR. Thwaites, and not of the Police. It is to be
hoped that the parties will act harmoniously, as policemen
are necessary at a fire, and that in case of a row, SIR
Thwaites's vassals will not begin pumping on the Bobbies,
who will in that case certainly deserve their sartorial name
of Slops. Many new stations are to be added. In America
the Firemen are an institution, they are proud of their
engines, adorning them with silver, and they have an esprit
de corps, vote as *} as they pump, and join in
processions, engines and all. The ladies smile on them, and
ts (American poets at least) make songs in their honour
ull of poetical Fire.
MR. CRAwford, late in the might, began to say some-
thing about a lot of places in the Highlands. Those savage
regions are dear to us, and when he named Oban, and we
thought upon a boat (with no Cockney excursionists) and
ourselves setting forth upon the blue sea, blue eyes before
us, for a sail to Iona, our sensations became overpowering,
and we rushed out for refreshment. We believe that his
Bill had something to do with elections. O that we were

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARLIE OBJECTS TO THE MAJOR AS HIS NEW PAPA, AND CONWINCES HIM OF THE FACT.
A GOOD WORD FOR A GOOD WORK.
IN common with other of the first people in the land, Mr. Punch the
other day was invited to a Meeting of a Society which §§ to be
familiar in men's mouths, and which is called THE LADIEs’ SANITARY
Association.
Mr. Punch, of course, knows ºil; but for the moment he
forgot what the aim of this Society actually was; and he thought per-
haps it might be to improve the health of ladies by giving them employ-
ment to prevent their brains from addling, or by teaching them to shun
tight lacing and thin shoes, hot ball-rooms and late hours, and the
hundred other follies that impair their vital energy. A moment after-
wards, however, Mr. Punch recalled to mind that the aim of the Society
was, by ladies’ work and influence, to promote the health and comfort
and well-being of the poor, by making them acquainted with the common
laws of health, and helping them to make their homes more happy than
they could be if these laws were not observed. This excellent intention
the Society effects, among other ways, by these:–
“By collecting money for Sanitary improvements, such as opening windows,
curing smoky chimneys, removing nuisances; giving soap ; and lime for white-
washing ; lending books, patterns of clothes, scrubbing-brushes, saucepans, and
cooking recipes.
“By requesting the Medical Officers of Health, and other professional and well-
educated gentlemen, to deliver popular free lectures.
“By instituting Mothers' meetings, and classes of adult girls, and giving them
Sanitary and domestic instruction.
“By forming, or aiding, Penny Clothing Clubs, Coal Clubs, Baths and Wash-
epôts, and Working-Men's Clubs.
houses, Temperance Associations, Cooking
“By establishing Nurseries for motherless babes, which may serve as Schools,
for Mothers of all c s, Schoolmistresses and Nurses."
Plain, practical and sensible are all these helps to health, and the
happiness that goes with it. In addition, useful knowledge is pleasantly
imparted by short Fºllº with expressive titles, as, for instance:–
The Worth of Fresh Air, The Power of Soap and Water, The Health of
Mothers, and How to Manage a Baby; all which are surely far more
profitable reading than. The Maniac Marquis, Agnes and her Agonies,
Benjamin the Bloodstained, or the Bloated Burglar / and the like in-
structive stories supplied by the cheap press.
Besides this, the Society looks after little children whose cheeks are
paled through living dungeoned in damp cellars, scant of air and light.
Of these, thousands upon thousands it takes yearly to the Parks, to
stretch their little legs and lungs, and kindly feeds, if º be hungry,
before it sends them home. Sometimes, even, it is able to take a
favoured few of them to see—Q joy! O rapture l—the lions and the
leopards, the eagles and, the elephants, and—greater rapture, still!-
the monkeys at their tricks. How such days of bliss are sighed for,
revelled in, and recollected And what, pleasure must one, feel in
knowing one has helped to give such pleasure to these little ones,
whose pleasures are so few -
Such pleasure may be yours, my boy, or any other man's, indeed, by
iº sending, º a º: yearly to these Ladies, who on the day of
their late meeting had but twelve pounds in hand. Their office may be
found at number 14A within the Street of Prince, hard by the Square of
Cavendish, within the district West; and, the more money they get from
you, the more good they will do. . Mr. Punch need not remark how
enormous an admirer he is of Lovely Woman; and to his eyes, Lovely
Woman is never half, so lovely, as when she is employed in doing a
good work. To help the poor to health and the happiness attending it,
the most cynical must surely grant is doing a good work; and Mr.
Punch is therefore proud to !" these ladies on the back, and is glad to
say a good word for the good work that they do.
Lesson for Confederate Clergymen.
By order of GENERAL HATCH, the Officer in command of the
Northern forces at Charleston, the REv. DR. MARSHALL, Missionary
of St. John's Chapel, has been sent beyond the lines of the army, for-
bidden to enter the City of Charleston during its º by the
United States’ troops, and subjected to confiscation of his personal
property to the use of the United States' Government, for refusing to
pray for PRESIDENT ANDREw Johnson. Aha! This is the way to
teach Southern Clergymen to perform the Christian duty of praying for
their enemies.

A CIWIL NOTE,
DEAR PUNCH,
WILL you do us a service P Will you ask IORD PALMERston
(in your next number, if convenient, as the days will soon have done
growing), when we are to have the Saturday half-holiday? It is
said, with his usual kindness, he is quite ready to minister to our wants,
and extend Early Closing to the Government Offices, but the authorities
are mute. A word from you will open their lips, and abbreviate the
inevitable minuting, and docketing, and registering, and filing. Please
therefore to board the Treasury. Lilacs and laburnums are in bloom,
d it is not unreasonable to expect that we shall soon leave off fires.
The M. C. C. are in the field, and some of us, like the dentists, want to
be at the stumps. Others think it wherry trying to be chained to the
oar on a bright afternoon, when they are longing for the river., Loper
is impatient to make one at a Saturday Review, and take his Minié to
the butts, whilst LovER is pledged, under the heaviest penalties, to
escort his MINNIE to the Crystal Palace Concerts. Indeed, there is a
general desire that the National Shutters should be put up on Satur-
days as early as is consistent with the requirements of the Public
Service. (A neat phrase that last, is it not? On loan from DE TAFE-
Ley, who, when he wishes to vary it, substitutes “exigencies” for
“requirements.”) -
The Service have always been your admirers, but if you do not think
it an office foreign to your purpose to call in Downing Street, and get
this matter settled, I am sure we shall more than ever desire that your
exports of weekly numbers and half-yearly volumes to our Colonies
may go on increasing, and your imports of jokes exceed those of any
previous year. We shall be unanimous in ...; you an overflowing
exchequer, with prosperous, revenue returns and a most satisfactory
audit; and remembering that you always carry off a first-class certificate
in the Art Department, it is only necessary to express a hope that
it may always be one of your good customs to . your readers in
transports, and that you may never be superannuated.
I have the honour to be, Mr. Punch,
Your obedient Servant,
A. SENIOR CLARK.

Young Lady (timidly feeling that something or other depends upon her
reply). Yes. (Fearing she may be called upon for a quotation, adds.) But
'twas a long time ago. -

was, as you may remember, Minne-haha, the laughing water.
Young Lady (not liking to commit herself). Well—
Bold Somebody (observing that his conversation is attracting general
attention). I dare say she was called by her savage intimates, Minnie.
A few People (tittering). Ha! Ha! Ha!

listening) why would he be like a small portrait f

dinner will be ready). I don’t know.

trait, because he'd be a Minnie-chewer.

PSALMODY 1N PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
S (To the Editor of Punch.)
IR,
... I HAPPEN to live near a foundation-school, which is, however,
a charity school for poor children only. The pupils of this institution
are accustomed to sing the Morning and Evening Hymn; and I often
hear them practise other psalmody. I think this devotional exercise is
not practised at Eton, and the majority of our public schools for the
young nobility and gentry. Surely, this difference is not caused by any
notion that the singing of psalms is a menial part of divine service, unfit
to be performed by the children of the superior classes P I only put this
as a QUERY,
“SAVE ME FROM MY FRIENDS.”
I’d give no rope unto the Pope
Or doctrines Ultra-montane;
Rome, if you choose, you may abuse,
As Babylonian wanton.
To WILLIAM THE DUTCHMAN I
Hold fast with LoRD MACAULAy—
But save me, sense, from the defence
Of watch dogs such as WHALLEY
I hate a priest, his craft resist,
Hold half his ritual mummery:
Think Church's claim to bind and loose
Is but audacious flummery:
Abhor the Jesuit arts that make
Black white, and welle nolle,
But grace preserve me from a friend
Who pleads my cause like WHALLEY
That monks and nuns are useless drones,
Who wax fat on their neighbours,
Regardless of the wholesome rule
hat he best prays who labours,
I do believe, and sore should grieve
If here such locusts crawly
Should settle down, to raise the frown
And prompt the wail of WHALLEy.
That Puseyism a half-way house
pon the road to Rome is,
That for straightforward Puseyites
St. Peter's bark the home is,
I’ve not a doubt, and would lug out
Of our Church, pulley-hawley,
All so arrayed in masquerade,
To make a case for WHALLEy.
But if there's aught can make me doubt
My feelings. Anti-Papal,
It is the lot who of their rot
Such feelings make the staple.
One asks, when hit by NEwMAN's wit,
And his ºp. folly,
“Which road prefer P.; with NewMAN err,
Or be i'the right with WHALLEY P”
As life unites all opposites,
As good its force to bad owes,
As pain, and darkness seem to be
But light's and pleasure's shadows:
This House of Commons’ butt and bore
May not be causeless wholly;
And JoHN BULL's Protestant good sense
May need the foil of Whalley.
Political Vagrants.
The Division on the Union Chargeability Bill shows that Toryism is
going begging. Guardians of the public interests be on the alert.
There is a party in the “House” who mean to apply to the country
for out-door relief. Refuse it, especially about Henley.

BEING A NEW CHAPTER OF AL KORAN, ENTITLED
THE WINNER. REWEALED AT EPSOM.
Because that the Great Horsc, on whose back sundry and divers had loved to
set their gold and their silver, is a horse of the people which is called French, and
because, that the people which is called French have in these after times, and
through the lips of their Sultan, AL NAP, taken and adopted Al KoRAN as their
law, saying unto the nations, Behold my guns, therefore it is fated that ye do
homage to France. It has been revealed unto me, even the Prophet Pusch, that
in compliment and honour to those Frenchmen, and in gracious recognition of
their ways, and because they study to imitate the islanders, and read Le Sport, and
to the end of drawing closer the bonds of love and amity between us, I should add
another chapter to the revelations of my brother the PRopart Mohaw MED, even
as he added unto them an extra chapter in favour of a young lady called Mary, not
previously acceptable unto his wife Ayesha, nor subsequently. Therefore,
hearken, you whom in the other time I called blokes and bloaters, but now I
name believers, because you should believe in your Punch. This is the last chapter
or Sura, of Al Korān, which is so called from the Arabian word Karaa, to read.
How long will ye be the dupes of knaves and tricksters calling themselves
prophets that they may cozen you of your gold and silver, yea and of your nether
garments, which ye leave at the house of your mother's brother, saying unto him,
Give me money that I may pay for a tip. Behold, have I not in nine years
heretofore revealod unto you the names of the winners of the great race, even
the Derby, taking but threepence for the same? Then bo wise and not fools, for
a fool is a miry pond wherein a man may neither drink nor wash. Where will ye,
be, O idiots, when ye return to the harcem, and the Lights thereof ask of ye saying,
What have you won, and your faces are darkened like blacking-pots, and ye have
nought to give unto the harcem save chaff, which nevertheless shall avail ye not
in the day when Fatima desireth the white fishes of Greenwich, or Miriam
thirsteth for the iced wine of the Star. Were it not well to have a purse in those
days? Hearken, then, unto Punch-Mohammed, for there is none like him.
Now the horses and the asses, yea, an exceeding great host, shall gather
together for the strife, and there shall be eating and drinking and smiling and
swearing, and there shall be wagering of wagers, and shying of sticks, and the
incense of Havannah and of Bristol shall go up like a cloud, sickening the birds
of the air, even the pigeons thereof. And there shall come unto the place of battle
horses of vast price and costliness, and their names shall be in the mouths of the
fools and of the wise. There shall be the horse whose name is the name of him
who burned the ships with a burning-glass, and he whose name is that of a cruel
tyrant, and he who is called after a book where with a mighty scribe did delight
your winter festival, and he who is called after the hopping beast of the far-off
lands. Likewise think ye of the flyer on the back of the bat, and of the deadly
weapon that slayeth afar off, and of him who in the Latin tongue is called bold,
and of the chief god of the hcathen which dwelleth in the East, and of the city
which has fallen, yea, into the hands of the men which say unto you, Liquor.
And there shall also be named unto ye the quay which is by the river Clyde,
even the Scotch river of ships, and the ignis fatuus which danceth over the
swamp, and the brown child of him which is wild, and the wild child of
the same, and the sweet wind that played with Aurora, and the name of him
who also is called a roarer, and who is not, and hath been called from out of the
language of the swift Indian of the West. And ye shall hear of the magistrate of
the Land of Flowers, and of him who is the child of Tobias, the scribe, and of
him who was the child of Planché, the scribe, yea the pleasant scribe in the days
when there was wit amid the mirth of men. Shall they not speak unto you of
the day when the foolish among you held it evil luck to wed, or to do the
thing which is new, and of him which poured fire upon your horsemen and upon
your footmen until ye rose and smote down his stronghold, and of him whose
name is as it were a church wherein men might sleep : are there not many such
in these days of dulness? And ye shall be told of the jester that cometh
from the Jordan, and of the river where bath bathed the brave man whose name is
as a living stone among you, and of the half brother of that river, and of him which
hath been long down but may now rise up to the discomfiture of many. Moreover,
speech shall be made unto you of the son of the musician who was skinned alive by
the critical god of the day, and of a lord among the people—a lord whose sire died
gloriously for us all after the battle in the stream. And ye shall hear even more,
for ye shall listen to the name of him whose dam was the first among those who
strove for the great race, and who now runneth in the happy hunting-grounds, and
of him whose name belongeth unto the sports of the Pagan arena, when a man was
slaughtered for sport, and the voice of the people said Habet, and their turned up
thumbs dismissed his soul to the empty and wandering air. And they shall say
unto you Farewell, and they shall say unto you Nothing more.
Then shall ye speak unto me, even Mohammed Punch, saying who of all those
shall win? And in that day I shall make answer, saying that the victory goeth
unto the swift and strong if he be well guided, and there be no treason found in his
rider. Then yo will say, Behold, we know that, but tell us now. And I will answer
again, saying, What should I get by that? And then ye will reply, Art not thou
our guide and friend? In that day, O believers, the tears shall spring to mine eyes,
even as the water welleth up through the sand from the fountains which are called
the diamonds of the desert, and through the dust of Epsom in mine eyes the water
shall come forth, and I will say unto you, Verily, his eye shineth before you like a
star, and his skin gleameth like the gleaming of a mirror, and the number of his
legs is as the number of the bed-posts of a bed, and in the twinkling of a bed-post
will I reveal him unto you, for his tail hangeth down behind, and behold, in the
Turkish language I reply unto you, BakAllum.
THE DER BY HORSESHOE MAGNET.
“THERE is a pow'r whose sway” as you’ve
In words well set by BALFE read,
While you’ve seen MELLON's baton move,
Whose Christian name is ALFRED.
There is a pow'r whose sway is famed
Above that in the sonnet,
Which “Power of Love,” I think 'twas named,
At least ’twas written on it.
“What power is this?” say you to me:
“Rhymester, you must be crack'd if
You think than Love that there can be
A metal more attractive
It draws the clown or high-born dame
In cart or pair-horse wagg'nette
To Epsom Downs.” You ask its name?
The Derby Horseshoe Magnet.
Drawn by this pow'r, all sorts of chaps
Will horses, ass, or mules 'ack,
And the LoRD Chancellor perhaps
Will ride down on his Woolsack.
Why, I'd go on the Mammoth Horse
If he were mild and gracious,
But that Great Beast seems on the course
A little Horse-tentatious.
The careful Trainer's horseshoe too
Attracts perhaps a blockhead—
A boy who knows not what to do,
A jockey who is jockey'd.
The unsuccessful Trainer looks
Quite the reverse of sunny,
A money-bag his horse-shoe hooks,
But in it is no money.
See in another corner one,
A smile upon his face is,
The Race is done, the Derby's won,
The Winner he embraces.
See where the Fay'rite, who has lost,
On trembling hind legs rising,
Begins the owner to accost,
ſeekly apologising.
The P. Magnet will attract
All kinds of food in hampers,
On which we’ll feed as bivouacked
In prairies of the Pampas.
We see the well-known “phiz” again
With neck just like a stork there,
Here comes the Bottle of Champagne,
And Magnates draw the cork there.
Fill up! and ply the knife and fork :
We're drawn here to be jolly;
Let’s tryif we cannonsense talk
As well as MR. Whalley.
Unchecked by Moderation's frowns,
Folks take a lot of false drink,
To-morrow blaming Epsom Downs,
They will some Epsom Salts drink.
That day let Trade make fast its door,
Nor profits JAMEs nor STAGG net,
Let Fishermen upon the shore
Leave hooks and lines and drag-net.
Give Soldiers leave of absence, they
Will lay down gun and bag'net,
A Power summons them away—
The Derby Horseshoe Magnet !
Improvement in Fire-arms.
It is said that all rifles for military use will very soon be loaded with
explosive shells instead of common bullets. The Inns of Court Volun
teers will then no longer alone deserve the title that will be applicable
to every regiment in the world, “The I)evil's Own.”

THE STAGE FROM THE FRONT.
The production of Brother Sam at the Haymarket Theatre is a slight
but gratifying improvement º our past farces, like Lord Dundreary,
§ paralyse the energies of a good working comedy company for the
benefit of one or two individuals. Brother Sam is a humorous three-act
German farce, built upon an old theatrical, and not very moral basis—
a deliberate deception practised upon a rich old uncle by a reckless
nephew for the sake of obtaining property. If the characters were not
thorough stage conventionalities, moving in a sphere of life in which
there is nothing real but the chairs and tables, and creating impossible
incidents at every turn, such pieces would be simply unbearable. As
it is, they are tolerated with all their enormities, like the crimes of
Clown in the pantomine and Punch in the show, because no one
believes in their resemblance to humanity. Such pieces require to be
acted without apparent reflection by the actors, and without causing
reflection in others. Admirably as MR. SoTHERN, MR. BUCKSTONE,
MR. CoMPtoN, and Miss Nelly MooRE do their main work in Brother
Sam at the Haymarket, the performance might be improved in this
ticular. M.R. SOTHERN º: into a slowness of manner,
in which he thinks, or appears to think, and consequently becomes, for
the time, nothing more nor less than a well-dressed swindler. Önly
well-sustained, thoughtless, dashing levity can carry through such a
character without making it disagreeable. The moral balance, however,
is º restored by the wº in which Brother Sam is teased and check-
mated | the young lady who consents to appear as his wife, and who
makes the deception as pleasant as possible for the old uncle.
MR. SoTherN has a great fancy for introducing extravagant panto-
mime business in all his pieces. Brother Sam, as represented at the
Haymarket, requires no such clap-trap tricks. They only stand in the
way of MR. OxenfoRD's amusing dialogue, and the humour and spirit
of the other actors.
The audience appeared to be delighted with the performance.
IRISH GAME,
We are indebted to the Field for the following good joke, which
appears among our sportsmanlike contemporary's answers to “Corre-
spondents:— -
“SHOOTING.
“Parsons.—In Ireland, but not in England. They cannot however, be shot here
without a licence.”
From this statement it would seem that parsons in Ireland are in the
same predicament with landlords, game that may be shot unprotected
by any game-laws. In England, to be sure, they cannot be shot without
a licence, which luckily for the Church, cannot be obtained.
WONDERFUL–AND TRUE ||
THE following two Advertisements appeared in a recent impression
of the Times. ... We think they must have been intended only for our
columns, for they never can be meant in sober seriousness.
The first one runs thus:–
O GOVERNESSES.—WANTED, for a private gentleman's family, in
the country, a GOVERNESS. She must be a member of the Church of England,
clever, and conscientious in her management of º and girls of different ages.
She must be firm, even tempered, and methodical, and teach thoroughly well
French, music, English, and drawing, and be a good needlewoman, active in her
habits, and perfectly healthy. Age not under 25 or over 35. A good personal refe-
rence will be required to a family of the same sort, where she has had the charge
and education of several children of both sexes under and audve 12 years of age.
Salary £30 and all found. Address, &c.
We should rather think she ought to be very “active in her habits”
and “ ; healthy ’’ to be able to get through all the duties which
would evidently be imposed upon her by the compiler of this advertise-
ment, and also very methodical to have all the French and music, and
English and drawing lessons over in time to have a quiet evening's
needlework.
The same Advertiser wants— -
A. UPPER NURSE and LADY'S MAID (combined), who has lived
for some years in one family, where she has acted in a similar capacity. She
must be a thorough nurse, fold of children, and clever and conscientious in her
management of them; clean, active, and industrious. She must be a thorough
good dressmaker, milliner, and able to get up fine things, also a very good and
quick plain needlewoman, and a good hairdresser. There are six children in all
but three are at school. A governess and under-nurse are kept. No inflicient
person need apply, but one who is of an obliging disposition. She would have to
make the children's and her own bed, and wash up the tea-things. A member of
the Church of England indispensable. No perquisites allowed. Wages 4:20 a-year
and all found. Address, &c.
. A very clever woman indeed must be requisite for so varied a situa-
tion, and without a little “conscientiousness in her management” she
would be rather in a fog as to which of her various duties she should first
perform. Of course her mistress would not object, after “the tea-things
were washed up,” to evince an “obliging disposition” and wait until
the “beds were made,” and a few “fine things got up" before her
hair was dressed; for in so generous a family it could not be expected
that a servant would be worked to death for the sake of allowing her
mistress to appear comme il faut at any certain hour. Oh no! she
would much rather wait her turn. “No perquisites allowed.” Well,
we should almost think if they were allowed, they would seldom be
discovered or obtainable in a household which apparently is not at all
extravagant.
BRIGANDS AND BRIGANDESSES.
The Italian Government has now in custody a band of brigands, with
their chief, NicoLA MASINI, who are said to have been for four years
the terror of the Basilicata. This gang consists of seventeen men and
three women, described as more bloodthirsty and pitiless than the men.
They stand accused of about three hundred and fourteen crimes between
them, and among those they are charged with, we are told, “besides
mere robbery, the crimes of mutilation, murder, and burning alive are
said to figure conspicuously.” And yet the liberal Press of Italy would
have us believe that these wretches have been committing these
outrages in the interests of the Pope and the KING OF NAPLEs, and
that the Roman Government has, therefore, encouraged them. How
utterly incredible! Mutilation, murder, and burning alive! When
did the Papacy ever countenance such atrocities as these—especially
burning alive?
“FLYING WORDS.”
A LITERARY Gentleman in search of old furniture came across this
advertisement:—
WINºp BOOKCASE, made by Gillows 7 feet wide, 8 feet high.-
To be SOLD, a very superior mahogany WINGED BOOKCASE, enclosed by
glazed doors, secretary, &c. Recently cost £50; to be sold for 20 guineas. Apply, &c.
He immediately jumped at the offer, and now proposes filling the
Winged Bookcase with volumes of fly-leaves, º Being in no
present want of a Secretary, he will let him out by the four on condi-
tion that his hirer shall, on returning him, carefully lock him up behind
the glazed doors. The whole arrangement is admirable.

THE attention of MR. GLADstone's temperate coal-whipper, who

to the subjoined copy of an advertisement:-

rounded with factories. Death the cause of leaving. Apply, &c.
The temperate coal-whipper may be admonished, by the foregoing
announcement, not to exceed his eight quarts of beer daily, and its
perusal may induce his intemperate associates, who, according to the
ChancELLOR of THE Exchequer, are in the habit of drinking from
twelve to sixteen, to reduce their consumption to something near his
moderate allowance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 3, 1865.
MR. LOCKE”S BILL
FOR LEGALISING THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES IN MUSIC-HALLS IS
SUPPORTED BY A “DRAMATIC AUTHORS' PETITION.”
fº
UR dramatists begin with the
complaint:–
“That your Petitioners have
found that the existing legisla-
tion concerning theatres operates
as a restriction upon their in-
dustry, while it has not in any
manner supported or elevated
dramatic literature."
Both these allegations, we
have no doubt, are sus-
ceptible of proof. That the
existing legislation concern-
ing theatres has not in any
manner, “supported or ele:
wated dramatic literature”
is at once apparent from
the character of the pieces
produced by nine-tenths of
our Dramatic Authors.
That such legislation has
operated as , a restriction
upon their industry we may
be justified in inferring
from the fact, that there are not half-a-dozen original pieces now pro-
duced in London in the course of a year. The petition continues:-
“The Lower Middle Class and Working Class have, of late years, developed a
large appetite for intellectual amusement, which the number of theatres, and the
present construction of theatres (which give no comfortable or proper accommoda-
tion for these classes) have failed to sa .”
We are delighted to learn that the Lower Middle Class and Workin
Class have of late years lº a large appetite for “intellectua
amusement.” We presume this development o Fº for the intel.
lectual, has been accompanied with a º; craving for the sub-
stantial, in the form of chops, steaks, an
kidneys, unlimited “goes”
of something short, and a large consumption of tobacco. Otherwise,
we cannot connect the allegation with the object of the petition. How
does the development of a large appetite for intellectual amusement
require the conversion of theatres, into free-and-easies, or of free-and-
easies into theatres?, One would suppose. “intellectual appetite”
would drive people where intellectual appetite is catered for, as it is
presumed to be in a well-conducted theatre; not to a place where
nigger minstrelsy, trapèze tumbling, ;...". and the comic
duet business are alternated with poses plastiques and ballet dancing, and
where even such intellectual food as these entertainments supply seems
to require washing down with gin-and-water, and digesting by aid of
tobacco smoke. -
The Dramatic Authors who sign this petition must excuse us if we
find it difficult to reconcile the alleged prosperity of music-halls—as they
are called on the “lucus à non lucendo’ principle—and the alleged
decline of theatres, with the recent development of “intellectual
appetite” asserted by the petitioners.
hey go on to say, in English, which shows, we fear, traces of the
effect of a long course of translation from the french, that “the num-
ber of theatres, and the present construction of theatres (which give
no 'comfortable or proper accommodation for these classes) have “failed
to satisfy” the intellectual appetite in question.
Here we must ask a question. Is it only the “number and construc-
tion” of theatres that are to blame for such a failure? First, as to
numbers: considering that the theatres are, one and all complaining—
above or under their breath—that they can't draw audiences, that the
attractions of the music-halls are emptying their pits and galleries, it is
difficult to believe that the “number” of theatres has anything to
do with the disappointment of the intellectual appetites of our Lower-
Middle and Working Classes. When the theatres are full to overflow-
inº will be time to maintain that there are too few of them.
hen, as to “construction.” Theatres may not be perfect in
means of entrance and exit, sitting accommodation, and ventilation;
but, if they are bad in these points, what are such places as the Alhambra,
and most of the music-halls, particularly on a full night, with the
gas in full blaze, and the steam of suppers, goes, and weeds, enriching
the odours of hot humanity. No-faulty construction will hardly
account for any falling off in theatrical audiences.
Perhaps, however, we may admit that the theatre, as generally con-
ducted now-a-days, is not exactly the place in which to satisfy an
“intellectual appetite.” With our “intellectual appetite” still suffer:
ing under the mockery of a Barmecide entertainment, in the shape of
a recent course of burlesques, we feel that the intellectual º:
like the sheep in MILTON's Sonnet, “Looks up and is not fed” in our
London theatres. But is there not something besides “numbers” and
“construction” of theatre to blame here? May not the quality of the
theatrical fare provided have a leetle to do with it? And who are the
* of that fare but many of the gentlemen who sign this
petition.
If º: fail so miserably in satisfying the “intellectual appetite,” of
even “the Lower Middle and Working Class” in our theatres, how are
they to satisfy it better in the music-halls £ which they wish to open
for the unlimited consumption of their viands?
If they have, anything better to offer, why not try it in the theatres,
where they will, at least, find the cooks—such as they are—in the shape
of actors, and the best procurable garnish of scenery, dresses, and
decorations, without the distractions of chops and steaks, *.
coblers, cold, withouts, and, sodas-and-brandies P Surely the inteſ.
lectual appetites will have a better chance if they are catered for by
themselves. The worship of the Muses does not need burnt-offerings
in the shape of sausages for two, or kidneys on toast, or the incense of
short pipes and mild Cabanas. No: let the petitioners speak out, and
say honestly:—
“Art is bosh; intellectual appetite is gammon. The more intelligent
and educated public has ceased to patronise the sort of entertainment
we have provided for them at the theatres. But though we cannot
cater for them, we think we could help to amuse less scrupulous or
critical audiences, if we had the aid of tumblers, trapézists, nigger-
melodists, hot lº. strong drink, and cigars, which the music-halls
would §: us and the theatres do not. Therefore, we beg you will open
to us the market of the music-halls.”
Such a plea would be intelligible. But the less the demand for the
opening of the music-halls to theatrical representations is based on the
demands of the “intellectual appetite” of the Lower Middle and Working
Classes, the better. Still, let us not forget that what is sauce for the
goose, is sauce for the gander. If the music-hall managers, and their
supporters among the dramatic authors, are chargeable with humbug
when they come forward as caterers for “intellectual º the
managers are just as bad when they protest, on grounds of the same
retentious kind, against throwing open the music-halls to the drama.
he real reasons against this step are distinct alike from the interests of
the music-halls, or the interests of managers. They are to be found in
the interests of the dramatic art, which managers in too many cases
systematically ignore.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT."
AY 29. Monday. In a merito-
rious Education Bill for
workmen's children is a
clause enacting that they
shall learn the Church Ca-
techism. LORD GRANVILLE
tried to get it out, but
the ARchbishop of York
carried it, by 53 to 38. If
ou are going to teach any
techism at all, we, as a
child, particular request
that it may be that of the
Church, as that is short and
easy, whereas, we suppose,
that more tears and whipping
have been caused by the
Assembly's, and that fright-
ful thing taught in Scotland,
than by any device ever yet
conceived for the torment
of infants.
Then came the Clerical
Subscription, Bill. . This is
not, as had been hoped, a
hiſ for preventing clerical
ersons from incessantly
othering you for subscrip-
tions. It refers to the oaths
of the Clergy. The Irish
Church desires that her Convocation may be revived and consulted on the subject. A Convo-
cation of Irish Parsons ! ...And we put down .." ARchbishop TRENch is one of
the best and kindest men in the Church or in the world, and he cannot have considered what
he was asking for. The English Bishops would not hear of it. Could DEAN Swift be Presi.

The Commons sat late, but there was not much to note, except an angry spar between SIRs
Prº and Čiºns over the irish Police Bill, Sir Roger hinting that KING WILLIAM's day
would make additional police necessary, and SIR Hugh firing up and reminding the House
that it was not the Orangemen who were guilty of the Belfast civil war. We thought that
they had their part in that Irish Convºcation. -
#. Greenwich Hospital Reform Bill was read a Second Time. But what is to be done with
the poor Merchant Seamen? They have been for years made to contribute their sixpence
towards the Hospital, but are excluded from any benefit thereof. There is an answer to
everything, and we suppose that it will be urged, that the merchant shipping is protected by
the war-sailors, and therefore ought to pay, but this plea, though not a bad one as regards the
Merchants, seems to us, apart from, the question concerning the Men. Would you amerce
your cook and housemaid of part of their wages to pay yourſº.
MR. DisrAELI had, unhappily, been laid up with gout, and MR. Mossell was asked, there.
fore, to postpone the Catholic Oath debate. He refused, unless an undertaking were given
that when the Fº should have yielded to colchicum and morphia, the sufferer would bring in
a new oath, of a uniform character. It is possible that MR. Monseil may have thought
that when a gentleman is agonised, with podagra, it is not unlikely that he may be in the
mood for framing oaths, but the undertaking was not given, and, on
Tuesday, the debate was resumed by MR. Newdegate, who moved a Six Months amend-
ment. He clung to the oath as a bulwark, as the record of a compact showing Protestant
good feeling towards Catholics. MR. GREGORY asserted the loyalty of the Catholics, and
asked who had beheaded MARY and CHARLes STUART, and expelled JAMEs. The first illus-
tration was slightly—eh? Was there not something about a Catholic conspiracy to murder
the Protestant Queen of England?. No matter. SIR. John PARINGTON, would modify the
oath, cutting out the repudiation of right to murder, and of mental reservation, but he insisted
on the Papist's swearing that he would not pull down the Church. Mr. Horswºmade a
good speech against the oath, adding that it was of no use, because as soon as the Catholics
§." powerful enough to change our religion, they will at once repeal the supposed safeguard.
IR Hugh CAIRNs owned that it had been no safeguard, but he thought that there were a few
honest men who might be bound by it. But it is the honest men who need no binding against
breach of faith—if breach of faith there be in such affairs. Are we to ask a Catholic to swear
not to do what all the Dissenters do, boastfully, whenever they can P. No, said the House, by
193 voices to 126.
Government is anxious to assure us that though the American Government is persistent in
claiming Alabama Compensation, it is desirous of amity as well as peace, and that nothing can
be more friendly than its language. Arbitration is hinted at.

said about the Kensington Museum, a place, by
the way, which Mr. Punch recommends every-
body with an eye to visit. The collection is now
most rich and most instructive in the best sense
of the word. MR. BRUCE explained, very satis-
factorily, the value of the educational advantages
to be obtained there. MR. WYLD thought the

A PIOUS FRAUD.
The Standard, in reference to the Speech made
by MR. GLADstone, in recommending his son to
the Electors of Chester, says:-
“MR. W. H. GLADstone, the son of the Chancellor
of the ExchequER, has become a Candidate for the
City of Chester; and as it appears the young gentleman
is not gifted like his father, nor able to say a word on his
own behalf, the Chancellor has good-naturedly taken the
task on himself.”
Young MR. GLADsrose, on the occasion re-
ferred to, preceded his father, and delivered a
very smart speech, which occupies upwards of a
column in a newspaper called the Times. It may
be obtained from most newsmen, and, as most
º: read it, we do not ; see the object
of this paragraph in the Standard. . But we sup-

SPINSTER SUFFRAGE.
INEDITED CORRESPONDENCE.
MR. PUNCH does not hold himself responsible for any absurdity that
may be found in this department of his Journal. The lists are now
open to *...*. combatant on one condition, that he presents his
card (with real name) to our Pursuivant-at-Arms, and winces not when
it is announced with a flourish of trumpets. Mr. Punch begs further to
state that however desirous he might be personally to oblige “Constant
Reader” and “Fiat Justitia,” this rule, adopted after mature delibera-
tion, admits of no exception.
DEAR, DELIGHTFUL PUNCH,
AUNT, who studies Rica RD0 and MILL, says we are all going
to have votes—every girl of us from five-and-twenty upwards. Oh!
isn't it charming ! CHARLEs declares that he will put up for Goose-
borough, and if he should, he must come in, for what candidate would
stand a chance against such a perfect Apollo?, I know nothing about
his principles, but he has given, MATILDA such a sweet pair of ponies,
and she has promised to act as Chairwoman (or whatever it is) of his
District Committee. Oh, do tell us, my dear Punch, when there’s to
be a General Election. CHARLEs has blue eyes, so we are all preparing
our colours to match.
Ever, ever yours,
AURORA Floyd.
DEAR MR. PUNch,
THERE is no occasion to confer the franchise on us married
ladies. At present all husbands deserving of that honourable name
vote agreeably to our instructions. Any alteration would only cause
excitement, without having a material influence on parties one way or
the other. As to single men, not one, I suppose, in ten is qualified to
vote. They have no weight in the political scale, and are only objects
of interest to the letters of furnished apartments.
Yours sincerely,
MARGARET MAITLAND.
My DEAR MR. PUNCH, - -
Dº, pray, put a stop to this heterodox doctrine of Spinster
Suffrage. Fancy, Sir, the awful open and unblushing bribery and cor-
ruption under such a system l—how could you by any Act of Parlia-
ment prevent a candidate from paying his young female supporters in
notes of elegance, and from treating old maids who offered plumpers
with any amount of flattery current in Great Britain. The lower House
of Parliament, instead of representing the collective wisdom of the
nation, will degenerate into a show-room of dandies. An ugly candi-
date, with a family, will never obtain a vote even if he be a second
Socrates. I am a plain man, and I say emphatically, it won’t do, Sir.
Yours most respectfully,
JAcoB FAITHFUL.
SIR, -
I AM quite in favour of Spinster Suffrage, but object to any
further extension. Those ladies who are under, marital control are
unfit, I consider, to be entrusted with political responsibility, and
Qught not to desire it. I anticipate great good from Spinster Suffrage,
for I feel assured that we shall never have that grand desideratum, a
tax on Bachelors, while Bachelors continue to misrepresent us in Par-
liament. I shall vote for no candidate that declines to give pledges,
§." a pledge of conjugal allegiance at St. George's, Hanover
Square, before he takes his seat in a refined as well as reformed House
of Commons.
Yours truly, PENELOPE PopLAR.

A QUEER KIND OF CHURCH.
The saying that there is nothing new under the sun, may appear to
be contradicted, but is, in fact, confirmed, by the advertisement for
lowing, copied from the fin...”.
WOODEN CHURCH, Second-Hand, wanted to Purchase, capable
of containing 350 persons, or more. Apply to E. Thornton, Esq., Huron.
For a church, whether wooden, or stone, or brick-and-mortar, or
corrugated iron, that is second-hand, how strange soever a building it
may seem, cannot be new. . But what sort of a structure may the
Wooden Church, advertised for as above, be conceived to be Evi-
dently being not a fixture, but portable, is this Wooden Church loco-
motive P And then does it go on wheels, like a travelling menagerie
or, being wanted out at Canada, can it be a floating sort of sacre
edifice, something in the style of Noah's Ark? In that case, is the
Wooden Church a sailing or a steam ark? If the Wooden Church is a
fabric of naval architecture, it may be regarded as a species of eccle-
siastical ship. ... Fancy a fleet of Wooden Churches afloat, with Rectors
for Captains, Vicars and Curates for Lieutenants, Deacons for Mid-
shipmen, and Petty Officers for Readers, or dispensers of a ministry
like that of the late. BoATswain SMITH. In place of an Admiral, the
Wooden Churches Fleet would of course be commanded by a Bishop.
The See of this Prelate could coincide only with that part of the ocean
for the time being occupied by his fleet of Wooden Churches. So long
as they remained at anchor, it would be stationary, but when they were
on a cruise it would necessarily be a rolling See. There may be no
i. §: as that, and yet some people may think that there are bishops
at 86a LOO.
Is there any moveable Wooden Church that is really and truly, a
sacred edifice—having been duly, consecrated If so, would not the
sale of that church be Simony P And how can any church be a second-
hand church? Are, we to conclude that a second-hand church is a
church that having been used by a fashionable .. till it has
got shabby and dirty, and ramshackle, is relinquished to serve as a place
of worship for the inferior classes P Perhaps the second-hand Wooden
hurch wanted to purchase at Huron is a kind of church that Respecta-
bility would deem suitable to serve as a Ragged Church here.

With a tiger-steak tender and juicy:

Then contented I’ll wait until noon, when for lunch

And a bone of broiled porcupine crisply I’ll crunch,

French Free Trade.
. In an article hailing an advance of the Austrian Legislature in the
direction of Free Trade, the Post observes:-
“France had her time-honoured prejudices, and dreaded the gift which perfidious
Albion tended. But she conquered her scruples—she swept away the barriers with
which her commerce was environed—and instead of finding her producers and
manufacturers ruined by English competition, saw them enriched by English gold.”
Only France retained her export duty on rags, and thus she sees her
manufacturers enriched by English gold, at the expense of the manu-
facturers of English paper.

iberally treated with,” and how funny to invite them to “send terms

word for age—is! ...And who would ever dream of begging Jupiter or
Sirius to “name the day, the happy day,”, when we might come to

ONE of the racing reporters, in , his remarks upon the Derby,

“The French horse was literally in everybody's mouth.”
Was he? What a shame! and what an expense too! Hippophagy
has lately been the fashion with French gourmands, but racehorse flesh,
we fancy, must be a costly luxury, and the wealthiest hº
would pause a little before ordering a filet of Fille de l'Air, or a
Gladiateur cutlet. But we have probably mistaken the purport of the
phrase. In saying that “the French horse was literally in everybody's
month,” the writer very likely meant, that, in honour of his triumph,
his admirers were not dining off him, but devouring him with kisses.

©ur prophecy of the Jerby.
A NOTE TO THE NEW CHAPTER OF THE KORAN, ENTI-
TLED THE WINNER, AND REVEALED LAST WEEK.
Now, believers, need ye that I should write unto you, saying, Behold, I am
right again. Am I not always right, and the only true prophet, and is not my
name MoHAMMED-Punch 7 But that is a small thing. Did I not speak unto you
plainly from the first unto the last, saying who should be the winner, even the
winner of the great race : Was it for nothing, believers, deem ye, that I turned my
heretofore so free, not to say easy speech and language into the form dear unto the
people which is called French, and I heaped compliment and honour upon them?
was it for nothing that I said that the victory should go unto the swift and the
strong if he were well guided and there were no treason? And how chanced it
with the horse whose name is as the name of him who was slaughtered in the
Pagan arena? Was it not in the guiding of him, after that he had been imperilled
by the accidents that come unto the sons of men, yea, and of mares, that his safety
was found? But hearken, for when I spake unto you of possible treason, I spake of
that which hath in other times occurred unto the minds of men touching certain
races, whereof no more, for idle words are vain words, and unfounded suspicions
are apprehensions without a cause. But at the last I spake unto you plainly,
saying BARALLUM. And unto those which hearkened unto my voice, and which did
back Allum, which is in the Turkish tongue “the Swordsman,” or gladiator, have I
been as the ever-springing fountain of riches and cataract of diamonds, yea, as the
key that unlocks the treasures of the Indian seas and the gold mines of California.
Keep your wealth, beloved believers, but be good unto the poor, and when the
Lights of your Hareems say unto you, My lord, and shall not we also have a holi-
day? answer the moon-faced ones kindly, and do that which they pray of you: are
they not the partners of your bosoms and expenses? Is it not fitting that they
share in the profits So saith the Great Prophet of all.
A LOVER'S CONFIDENCES.
If there is one proceeding in which a man is supposed to have a right
to please himself, or to fancy that he does so, it is the giving himsel
away in marriage. ... It is usual, we believe, to ask the assent of the lady,
but as this is usually matter of course—we, at least, have never been
rejected—the formality is not oppressive. Nobody thinks it necessary
to consult his parents, or his grandmother, or his uncles, or his cousins,
or his ºilº, or the inspector of police for his district. And cer-
tainly we never heard of a gentleman's demanding the opinion of his
neighbours in regard to his intended marriage.
But a gentleman of leicestershire, whose name he will probably
desire that we should mention—MR. BENJAMIN RILEy, of Desborough,
takes a larger view of a man's duty to Society. He has fixed his mature
affections upon a young person, named MARY ANN PAINE. She was
lately engaged in his factory. From the lover's description of her,
Miss PAINE appears to be deserving of all respect. But MR. RILEY is
not satisfied with having satisfied himself in the matter, but publishes
in the Midland Free Press a long letter, begging the inhabitants of
Desborough to listen to all that he has to say on the subject. He
supposes that they will be surprised at the match, and he is desirous
that they should not think it so foolish as it appears. He then explains
in about two dozen paragraphs that he has made a sort of Treaty with
the future MRs. Riley. Here are some of the articles:–
“The terms of our engagement are numerous, and are placed before her in an
extensive correspondence on my part.
“For the present it must be obvious she can do no more than follow my directions
implicitly, for it is not the uncultured factory girl, but the moderately cultivated
young º of the future I design uniting myself to.
“I shall feel a pleasure, according to the terms of our engagement, in her visiting
her family as often as she pleases, but it is understood they are not to visit her
unless asked.”
So that the Desborough magnates and gentilities need not be afraid,
when paying their visits to the newly married couple, of meeting
persons of inferior rank and culture. A clever starting-point.
MR. RILEY then ºniº the means by which he proposes to expand
the young lady’s mind:—
“Wishing her at once to see Desborough was only a small portion of the world,
and in order to fill her mind with new ideas, she passed through London, and also
through a large railway station in the south to Worthing, on the sea-coast, under
the charge of our kind friends, Rev. S. DRAKEFokI and MRs. DRAKEFoRD: this
rapidity of movement I thought advisable.”
In order to rouse her soul with a sudden burst. This was truly
artistic, and reminds one of the way in which Amina is awakened by a
chorus in the Sonnambula. Now mark the noble self-mastery of the
lover. He is not eager to rush into the society of his MARY ANN.—
“I had previously engaged a home there for them. By this arrangement she will
get a little initiated into the habits and manners of middle class life. I do not
suppose I shall see her for a few months to come, not till she gets a little grounded
in general information and becomes moderately refined."
We are not informed as to MR. RILEy's ideas of moderation in re-
finement. Some men, in the circumstances, might be satisfied if the
young lady acquired a habit of not putting a knife into her mouth, of
occasionally using the serviette instead of the pocket handkerchief, and
of remaining at the table until the other ladies should rise, instead of
pushing back her chair, and remarking “There!” Others might be
more exacting, and desire to see the gloves drawn on, and the eye care-
lessly yet carefully awaiting the chief matron's signal, and might wish
that in leaving the room there might be an abstinence from facetious
adieur to her adored, and from anything like endearment, or a request
that he will not take too much wine. But this is MR. RILEY's own
business. He next proceeds to give a copy of an advertisement which
he has issued for a sort of governess, who is to aid in the formation of
the lady's mind, and he has had nine answers to this. He has not,
however, engaged all the nine applicants.
“Some months must elapse, of course, before she arrives at these attainments.
-- ºwu also, if nothing prevents, have a very voluminous correspondence from
myself.
We hope that nothing will prevent the transmission of the voluminous
love letters which are menaced, and that nothing will prevent the young
lady from reading them. We venture, however, having some little
experience of young ladies, to hint to MR. RILey not to be a bore with
his letters, and by no means to cram them with improving matter. We
assure him that if he does, and unless Miss PAINE is entirely different
from all other young ladies, the improving matter will not be read. As
he has thus frankly taken us into his confidence, we feel bound to repay
it with similar frankness.
“Before the actual union takes place a great many months must necessarily elapse,
as, after she is pretty well informed in ordinary matters, she will have to learn to
play fairly on the harmonium, also to read the French language with ease, to write
it fairly, and to speak it with tolerable fluency.”
There is the first touch of real sentiment, of lover-like expression.
A great many months. It is prettier and tenderer to say that than to
use the word “a year.” There is a green spot in MR. RILEy's heart.
“Many moons must wane” would have been, on the other hand, too
poetical. “No end of a wait” is what we should say, were we engaged
to a fast young lady of the aristocracy. But MR. RILEY chooses the
prudent medium. But Miss PAINE must work, for she has to learn in
a year what many people never can learn in a life, and—
“To all curious ones I say, suppose nothing occurs to prevent it, expect the
wedding in May, 1866, for I do not think it is likely to be before, with so much
preparation on my intended's part.”
In fact, the date of his marriage depends on her power of learning
French grammar. If we were the tºº. wouldn't we try the Hamil-
tonian system, or DR. Pick's Art of Memory P But what pleasure in
repeating the verbs, and saying with MR. BAYLE BERNARD's French
class in the Boarding School, (why is this capital farce never played f)
“J’ames I love,” when every repetition of the present tense brings one
nearer one's Future.
MR. RILEY sums up in the following manner:-
“I have thought it just to myself to place this explanation before you, so that
you may see how the matter really stands. A copy of the Free Press, which contains
this address to you, will be forwarded to each of my relations and friends, as what I
do I do openly, and leave the world to say what they like."
The world will say what “they’” like, and we hope will say they like
MR. RILey's affectionate confidences. We think that he ought to have
gone a little further, called a public meeting, and after giving all these
explanations, ought to have announced himself as ready to answer any
uestions, but perhaps, being a man of business, his time is precious.
§. therefore, in answer to his appeal, assure him that his marriage
meets our approbation, that we are reasonably satisfied with the curri.
culum appointed for his bride, that we wish the plighted pair health and
happiness, and a union at the date fixed. If there be any other details
of household life on which MR. RILEY would like to consult us, as to
the choice of furniture, the aspect of the bed-rooms, the character of
º : or the best apartment for the nursery, he has only to publish
18 Wlshes.
Epsom Cup.
AMONG the Stakes run for on the “off” day of Epsom Races was
the “Epsom Cup.” This seems hardly the sort of “cup” that one
would be disposed to partake of for the purpose of luxurious refresh-
ment, although the "...if which may be denominated “Epsom
Ču.” associated with a small round body of a mercurial, nature, forms
a combination which is sometimes styled a “black and blue reviver;”

TURPITUDE.
THE ABOVE REPRESENTs A SLIGHT MISTAKE MADE By SCUMBLE's New CHAB woman,
who, BEING"PARTIAL TO HER DROPs,” Thought she HAD A CHANCE.
THE FRIENDS OF THE WORKING CLASSES.
A FINE occasion for sneering at an attempt to promote the comfort
and elevate the taste of the poor is afforded to any journal representing
the pride and, malevolence of the community, by an announcement
stating that the Royal Horticultural Society has consented that an
Exhibition of Window and House ºf: by the Working Classes,
shall be held at the Society's Gardens, on July 10th, and that it has
further agreed to give £50, to be distributed in prizes on that occasion.
Especial scorn may beº: upon the further statement, that a Com-
mittee has been formed to carry out the above-named object, and has
found, on calculation, that its º: if the number of parishes
expected to compete by reason, of the interest taken in the proposed
#. by the Parochial º and others, do so, will require a
sum of £400, to which those who have the social and moral good of the
Working Classes at heart are invited to contribute. Contemptuousderision
of that absurd scheme for indulging a maudlin tºº. the gro-
tesque Working Classes, may, perhaps prevent more than one strong-
minded lady or gentleman, who understands just satire, from giving
any money or countenance to an undertaking, which, together with its

INTERNATIONAL IDIOTS.
M. RENAN, the orthodox, in a recent article in the Revue des Dewar
Mondes, says:-
“The worst enemies of Egyptian antiquities have been the English or American
travellers, systematically tected in all their misdeeds by their Consuls. The
names of these idiots will go down to posterity, because they have taken pains to
write them themselves on"the most celebrated monuments and over the most
delicate des ... * * The wise principle that the antiquities are the property of
Government been proclaimed, a watch is established over them, but what if a
brutal stranger, despising all law, defies the guardian, burns the door of the monu-
ment, if there be one, breaks everything at his leisure, and if the guardian so much
i.:* him, complains to his Consul, who causes the unhappy native to be
ten?”
What? Why that both the stranger and his Consul are scoundrels.
Mr. Punch has declaimed, too often and too magnificently, against
British Wandals, to be suspected of tolerating them. He well remembers
the satisfaction he felt, and expressed, one day in Canterbury Cathedral,
where a Cockney Snob, ; } a column, was inscribing his vulgar
name, and a stranger coming behind him did, with a reasonably thick
ash plant inscribe his protest in a way likely to be remembered when
that'Snot should have occasion to take his seat in private life..., Habi:
tually averse to violence, Mr. Punch has, nevertheless, always authorised
anybody to castigate desecration, whenever a chance be offered. . But
M. RENAN º atones to himself for disbelieving some wonderful
statements by credulity as to others. If he thinks that the offence of
scribbling on monuments is not perpetrated by Frenchmen, Punch re-
commends him to make a brief tour of Parisian show-places. ERNEST,
JULEs, and PAUL are quite as fond of scratching their names as JAck,
ToM, and HARRY, and if MARY ANN, JEMIMA, and MATILDA may be
read on marble and glass, so may FIFINE, LISETTE, and JULIE. There
are Snobs of all nations, M. RENAN. French travellers are just as irre-
yerent as English and American travellers. This is no excuse for any-
body, but what is sauce for l'oie is sauce for le jars. With which reser-
vation, Mr. Punch has melancholy satisfaction in F. far and
wide M. RENAN's appeal, adding that more persons than vulgar tourists
seek by flippant monographs to destroy what ought to be held sacred.

PARSONS IN PETTICOATS.
RUE to the interests of an
important but somewhat de-
clining branch of steel manu-
facture, we have much plea-
sure in extending the publicity
of the subjoined statement
derived from the Edinburgh
Courant:-
“WARNING to CLERGYMEN.—A
Clergyman of the City of Durham,
and a gentleman of extreme High
Church proclivities, has lately ex-
cited the wonder of the citizens
by the peculiarity of his clerical
costume. A few days ago, the
reverend gentleman had the mis-
fortune to tread on the skirts of
his coat and fall, receiving such
injuries as have since confined him
to his apartments.”
In this, interesting little
narrative there is probably
an error of the press. For
“coat,” most likely, we ought
to read petticoat. Reverend
gentlemen “of extreme High
Church proclivities” are very
fond of dressing like ladies.
They are much addicted to
wearing vestments diversified
with smart and gay colours
and variously trimmed an
embroidered. There is the
chasuble, and cope, and stole,
and dalmatic, besides the alb,
which they are accustomed to
deck themselves out in a la

“BEST PUBLIC INSTRUCTORS.”
WE, have rarely seen a more charmingly useful and valuable paragraph
than the following, which we extract from a provincial contemporary:-
“On the 14th of April. Orsini, Charlotte Gorday, Ravillac, and Booth committed
crimes; and William III., Anne, George I. George II., George III, George
IV., William IV., Washington, President Lincoln, and others, have all died on a
Saturday.”
We have no doubt that the writer of this resumé of history intended
to teach some important lesson, and that we might be the more fully
prepared to receive it, we requested our little boy, home for Whitsun-
tide, to take MR. HAYDN's unimpeachable Dictionary of Dates, and
“verify” the rustic's statement. Qur intelligent, lad reports, that
ORs1NI committed his crime on the 14th January, 1858; that CHAR-
Lotte CoRDAY (called GoRDAY in the provinces) removed the miscreant
MARAT on the 13th July, 1793, and that RAvAiLLAc (called RAVILLAc
in the provinces) stabbed KING HENRY THE Fourth on the 14th May, j
1610. As Booth's crime was perpetrated on Good Friday, the pro-
vincial historian, with a penny almanack before him, could scarcely go
wrong. Our assistant wished at this crisis to go to the Zoological
Gardens, and we could not, humanely, detain him longer at references,
and therefore we did not send him to the Perpetual Calendar to examine
the second series of facts., But we are rejoiced to be able to compliment
the country gentleman on his accuracy in regard to PRESIDENT LINCQLN,
and we completely agree with him that “others” have all died on
Saturday, as his own advertising columns and those of the Times abun-
dantly testify. But, º: the whole paragraph accurate, we are
compelled to ask what does it prove, except that its writer is a Booby ?
JOHNSON AND JURISDICTION.
THE Congress of Yankeedoodledom acknowledges the authority of
one Johnson. The British House of Commons is supposed to own
that of another....Yet MR. HoRsMAN, in the debate on the Roman
Catholic Oath Bill, took occasion to object to the Protestant Oath, as
declaring that the Pope has no spiritual jurisdiction in these realms,
when in fact he has some. If MR. HoRsMAN had consulted DR. John.
son’s Dictionary, he would have found that “jurisdiction ” means
“legal authority.” Had he known that, he would not have gone on to
suggest any difficulty on the part of Protestant Members in denying
the Pope's jurisdiction; for what authority of any sort has the Pope in
these dominions that his Holiness can enforce by law Neither could
MR. HoRSMAN have used language so very different from a Houyhnhm's
as that which he employed in raising a question about, the PQPE's
“legal jurisdiction,” as if the Pope, or ...' else, could have illegal
jurisdiction. Legal authority the Pope might have here, if Parliament,
in its wisdom, would re the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and give the
acts of his titular bishops the force of law. If | In the meantime,
MR. HoRsMAN may swallow the Protestant Oath with perfect safety;
it need not stick in his gizzard at all; but that, of course, is no reason
why Roman Catholics, in order to sit in Parliament, should be com-
jºi to make any affidavit that offends and chokes them.

SIR CHARLES LOCOCK'S ADDRESS.
TO THE ELECTORS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
GENTLEMEN, ---
I RESPECTFULLY solicit the honour of being your political
attendant.
Did Babbicombe Bay or Natal return a Member, I feel that I should
more appropriately request the suffrages of the electors of those places,
wherever they are. But as the Isle of Wight, contains the marine
residence of our dear Sovereign, whose first physician-accoucheur I
. in 1840, I am sure that you will see my claims upon your
regard.
No person can set so high a value as myself upon a good Constitution,
or would be more ready to repel empirical treatment, thereof... I am a
decided advocate for an antiphlogistic policy, for, avoidance of irritants,
and for a very cautious use of stimulants. At the same time, I am not
bigoted, but am ready to meet any conjuncture, in short, to prescribe
{. re #: for in times like these there is no saying what a day may
ring torth.
The mation appears to me to be as well as could be expected.
As regards foreign policy, I would conduct it upon the most generous
and friendly principles, and my motto should always be, “Welcome,
little Stranger l’”
When England imprisoned NAPOLEON, the type of brute force, or, in
other words, tied up the great Knocker, she pledged herself to repress
revolution, but to encourage progress. That prescription saved Europe,
and I shall not be willing to P. from the treatment then suggested.
But though I am in favour of emulcents, I am far from saying that
there is no occasion on which a vigorous exhibition of steel and Bicon's
Powder may not be desirable.
I shall tender my Parliamentary º: to the EARL of DERby :
first, because he is an Earl, whereas his opponent is a less elevate
member of the respected Aristocracy, and, secondly, because I think
that he understands the case of the nation better than the rival prac-
titioner. Having had frequent º: of conversing with both,
when they have arrived at the Palace to offer congratulations on happy
events, I may consider myself qualified to form a diagnosis.
WOL. XLVIII.
I will never consent to alienate the Colonies. Happy is the nation
that hath its quiver full of them. -
On the question of Reform there is so depressed an action of the
national º: that I feel bound to wait for further symptoms. I am
opposed to a lowering system, and the idea of infusing fresh blood
savours too strongly of empiricism for toleration. I am opposed to the
Ballot and all other boluses. - - -
I will always uphold the National Religious Establishment, holding it
a nation's sacred duty to be º churched. -
The new Parliament will be primiparous, and the utmost attention
will therefore be required. I trust that the country will not be reminded
of the mountain in labour.
Should you do me the honour to elect me, I shall be ready at any
hour of the day or night to attend any consultations; and should a
brother practitioner propose anything that seems to me desirable, I
shall not be deterred from supporting it by any professional feeling of
jealousy, nor shall the miscarriage of any valuable measure be due to
my treatment. -
Having thus explained my principles, I will only add, that no more
bulletins will be issued, and that I am, Gentlemen,
Your faithful Servant,

[June 17, 1865.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UNE 8th. Thursday. The
idea of work, in this weather,
must be repugnant to the
feelings of any real gentle-
man, and the Lords declined
to discontinue their Whit-
suntide holidays. The Com-
mons, who are not so deli-
cate, and who, moreover,
are interested in getting the
Parliament decently É.
and buried, met again to-
day, and stuck to their seats
until half-past one in the
morning.
First, the Roach Fishery
Bill was readašecond Time.
As usual, the title of a mea-
sure is misleading, for the
fishes to be legislated for
are not roach but oysters,
and the river Roach is in
Essex. . The Bill is pro-
tective, but we do not un-
derstand what it protects,
and are certainly not going
to take the trouble of look-
ing to see. Perhaps the
oysters have been crossed
in love—how should we know? Yetit is pleasant to write of anything
that raises the idea of cool waters. -
Then an Industrial Schools Bill. The very name of industry with
the mercury where it was would have been enough to deter one from
listening to the discussion; but when we add that it was originated by
MR. HENNEssy, we feel that we have said enough, and a deal too much.
However, there was something in the case, and if the heat would
ermit us, we should energetically protest against the bigotry of the
§. Magistrates, who deliberately, set themselves against the
will, of Parliament, which has decreed that the Catholics in prisons
shall be attended by Catholic priests, and who oppose the carrying out
of that liberal ... Pº. icy in regard to Catholic children in the
Industrial Schools. The Magistrates were rebuked by SIR GEORGE
GREY, and he was thanked by LoRD EDWARD HowARD for his senti-
ments. But imagine the pleasure of fighting over a theological question
in existing circumstances ! ---
Two of the forgers of º to the petition about Azeem JAH
were brought up in custody, and they having stated that they were
very ignorant, and very sorry, and very poor, and had been the tools of
another person, and had been in custody for a week, the House good-
naturely discharged them without payment of fees. Members were too
indolent to be harsh. But we doubt whether the evil-doers were well
advised in coming out of the cool prison cells kept by LoRD CHARLEs
Russell.
SIR. GeoRGE GREY moved an address of congratulation to the
§. on the birth of the new little Prince, son of the PRINCEss of
ALEs, on the previous Saturday. MR. DISRAELI, who we are glad to
perceive had so completely recovered from his gout as to be able to
attend at the splendid marriage of Miss Evelin A DE ROTHSCHILD, and
make the most tender and graceful of speeches in honour of the
occasion, seconded the motion, which Mr. Punch, rousing himself for a
moment into loyal enthusiasm, has the distinguished pleasure of
thirding—and relapses.
THE SPEAKER, delighted, then escaped to throw off his wig and
gown, and take iced drinks. The House went into Committee on the
Civil Service Estimates. -
On a vote for the National Gallery, MR. CowPER said that the
National Collection was to remain where it was, and that the work-
house, the parochial school, and good ARChBISHOP TENIson's in the
rear, are to be bought, that new galleries may be erected upon the land
so to be acquired. Government has informed the Royal Academicians
that they must get out, but if they ask for a site at Burlington House,
it will be granted. We approve of this, for the strawberries and iced
cream at GRANGE's are very nice.
Much was said (for nobody has the energy, just now, to condense,
except into a dew), upon the propriety of opening the National Gallery
in the evening. The difficulty is a real one, the danger of fire. For it
may be in the knowledge of most persons, not art-critics, that
REMBRANDT and RUBENs and TITIAN and MURILLO are not now
alive, and therefore most persons, not art-critics, may have mental
power enough to understand that should the works of those artists be
destroyed by conflagration—we mean burned, but it is less trouble to
write long sentences than it is to compose short ones—the pictures in
question could not be replaced. Gas, it seems, would be decidedly
* * *
* * = º ſº
unsafe in the present edifice, which we presume is the reason why the
Royal Academy is allowed to light . In the new galleries it may
be possible to devise a system of lighting which ºft not endanger
the *. But we cannot talk about gas and crowded rooms this
Week.
It was allowed on all sides that the National Portrait Gallery ought
to be in a better place. But nothing pleases some people, and the
moment poor MR. CowPER signified his assent to this proposition, some-
body flew at him with a sort of accusing question whether he wanted to
take the portraits to South Kensington. He retorted that the very name
of that place seemed to frighten some Members, and declared that he
had no idea of the kind.
MR. MILNER GIBSON bore tribute to the talents and valuable
services of the late ADMIRAL FITzRoy, and stated that it was intended
to continue the system of observations, and telegrams, and signals.
Somebody made foolish remarks about the Weather Office not knowing
everything. Such nonsense would made us savage, except that this is
not a time to give way to irritability. Do Members want notices left at
their doors, saying that the wind will very likely blow their hats off at
certain given corners of streets?
Then we talked of Music, apropos of the miserable little grant of
£500 to the Royal Academy of Music, a most useful institution, which,
as MR. GLADSTONE explained, teaches the teachers. It did not occur
to anybody, in connection with the subject, to ask MR. WHALLEY to
sing. The CHANCELLOR said that the Academy was a very good
Normal school. We wish it could give us a very good Norma.
We hope that we are as humane as most people, but really the
talking of a place like Abyssinia, even º English prisoners are
detained there, was scarcely to be tolerated. MR, LAYARD begged
that the subject might be dropped—he was doing all that could be done.
So was the Italian Government, in order to rescue an Englishman who
went poking about in a dangerous place, and got into the hands of some of
the Pope's brigands. We hope that he will be delivered, but such
people give us a great deal of trouble. If, before leaving England, they
would assure their lives in some office that grants policies to travellers
it would be much better, as their relatives would provided for and
consoled, and Government would not see any particular reason for being
bothered by the consequences of imprudence.
On a debate whether a certain sum should be granted to DR. Cooke,
a most eloquent Irish Presbyterian clergyman, whom MR. WHITEs De
considers equal to CHALMERs, there was a curious little brotherly bit.
MR. HADFIELD's absence, strange to say, was noticed.
SIR ROBERT PEEL. He stays away in proof that he no longer objects
to the proposed vote.
MR. FREDERICK PEEL. I have a letter from him, asking that the
vote may be postponed until he can come to oppose it.
incordia fratrum rara est. . The eloquent Presbyterian, however,
obtained his money, by 51 to 14, and the Committee deserves a compli-
ment for possessing energy enough to divide.
FREDERICK PEEL's superfluous steam was then let off in the intro-
duction to the House of Commons of the longest single word which has
ever been spoken there, even in the Long É.i. He said that
the expense of -
Photozincographing
Domesday Book would be repaid by the ready sale of the fac-simile. By
the way, stop ! It is almost too hot to count letters, but in the days of
the Puritans there was much cant about a superstition called
Supralapsarianism.
This was a staggerer, but FRED PEEL beats the fanatics by a head.
Greenwich Hospital Bill—confound the title ! reminding us of MR.
QUARTERMAIN's delightful champagne cups—went partially through
Committee, and about a dozen other laws were rattled over without
note or comment. Then we walked out into the night, eyed the blue
vault, and blessed the useful light—which we obtained from a patent
fixed Star, warranted not to fall and burn holes in your trousers, also
the “fire tasteless,” like that of the verses of most modern poets.
Friday. Parliamentary virtue or valour—virtus—held out till nearly
nine, but was then Counted. The proceedings were eminently con-
versational, as all proceedings that really mean business are—it is your
Bumbles, and Westrymen, and Freemasons, and Patriots that make the
speeches. On the Prisons Bill a discussion arose on the propriety of
giving Magistrates power to cut off the hair of refractory women. This
punishment is so frightful a terror to them, that it is not surprising
that gaolers desire it, but the House of Commons has manlier, that is,
kinder instincts, and refuses leave to unwomanise even the depraved.
SIR BALDw1N LEIGHTON, a Shropshire magnate, told with evident
pleasure a story, how a prison matron, about to leave, was defied by a
woman prisoner, and thereupon went into her celland gave her “a sound
whipping,” which SIR BALDw1N considered, though an illegal, a sensible
act. The matron was leaving in order to be married. A sweet and
gentle bride! now blessed, let us hope, with children to partake her
kindnesses.

A STUDY FROM SHAKSPEARE.
By AN ENThusiastic AMATEUR PERFORMER.
E, the Amateur Talent
Company Limited, have
}.} produced the Sweet
Bard's favourite play in-
titled Romeo and Juliet, a
Love Tale of Werona,
with the greatest possible
success. The house was
literally crammed, cram-
med, Sir, to quote the
bard, “to suffocation.”
I generally play the lead.
ing characters, but “by
particular desire” on this
occasion I undertook the
small, though to a con-
scientious artist, onerous
part of that eminent eccle-
siastic, Friar John. The
apparently less important
personages in SHAKS-
PEARE's dramas require
as much, nay, more study
than is demanded by the
impersonation of his lead-
- - ., ing characters. They told
me that I could do what I liked with the part. I did so, and the result was—a
Creation. I soared above rehearsals, and worked up the part from my own interior
consciousness, and several consultations, with various learned authorities. By this
judicious method my representation of the amiable, but ambitious Friar, produced
equal admiration and astonishment among my envious fellow actors, and the
appreciative audience. -
The first question was, how should the Friar, be dressed.* I remembered how
MR. CHARLEs KEAN used to appeal to Authorities, and under the circumstances,
it struck me that BROTHER IGNATIUS might be consulted with some advantage.
But then the idea occurred to me, that this might be a Friar of liberal tendencies,
for he seems to be a roving sort of gentleman, running about on Friar Laurence's
errands, and therefore not inclined towards the ecclesiastical garb.
I had seen the monks out walking abroad, and, never without a snuff-box, a large
old red pocket-handkerchief, and generally a family umbrella.
Herein said I to myself, the audience will recognise a study, a pre-Raphaelite
picture from nature.
Pre-Raphaelite . There you are again; why not a mediaeval monk, a middle-aged
Friar John: delivering his speeches while in angular positions, and holding his
umbrella, snuff-box j handkerchief in open palms, with stiff fingers widely apart
I rejected this idea as one not allowing for action, and as too greatly circum-
scribing my freedom.
I came to the conclusion that Friar John was no common Brother, but (by
reason of his liberty to go wherever he liked to oblige old Laurence) a superior
of a Monastery out for a holiday tour. A jovial fellow, like one of those Monks of
old, of whom “many have told” what a something or other race, or crew, they were.
Since writing the above, some days ago, I decided, yesterday morning, on making
him a jovial brother of a mixed character. He is out for a holiday is Friar John;
but the ecclesiastics of the neighbourhood, hearing of the approach of so holy a
man, all came forth to meet him. This, you see, allows of a ceremonial,"and an exhi-
bition of archaeological pageantry, for which Romeo and Juliet offers, in other
respects, but few opportunities. -
I at once procured supernumeraries, at one shilling a head for the night, and
their dresses, wigs and refreshments found, and when Scene 2nd, Act 5th came, I
flatter myself my brother actors were not a little astonished to see the use I had
made of the permission “to do what I liked with the part.”
The simple Scene as originally written stands thus:-
ACT W. Scene 2.-Friar Laurence's Cell.
Enter FRIAR JoHN.
John. Holy Franciscan Friarſ! Brother! Ho!
t
rendered:—
ACT W. SCENE II.-Friar Lawrence's Cell.
Trumpets heard without.
Then Drums alone.
(I paid them myself.)
(I only had one for an hour.)
ENTER A PROCESSION.
Two Archbishops in partibus (one tall the other short: capital contrast).
An Acolyte. An Acolyte.
(With a Candle.) (Without a Candle.)
BAN N.E.R.
(He didn't carry this well, or it would have been splendid.)
Choristers Chanting. Choristers Silent.
Incense Bearers, with red caps.
Maidens strewing flowers.

(He ought to have come first, only he quarrelled with the Prompter as to
whether he should go on at all.)
Then

In which is Friar John's Snuff-box, Umbrella, and Handkerchief.
More Acolytes and Candle-lights.

A SE DAN CHAIR.
In which is seated Friar John.
Wasn't this an 'effect?!" The Amateurs were actually
annoyed at it. Bah! Well, out I got, and having pro-
cured my “properties,” my umbrella, snuff-box, &c., I com-
menced my speech.
I need not say with what applause I was received, nor
need I dwell upon the sulkiness of Friar Laurence at finding
all these people in his cell. It was a long time before he
could be prevailed upon to come on, and I had to shout
“Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother | Ho!” six times, in
measured tones, before he condescended to appear; and
when he did come, he behaved in a most irreligious manner,
anathematising me between his lines, and frowning upon
me like a demon. , I tried to deliver my one good speech,
“Going to find a barefoot brother out,” &c., in recitative,
but failed, for want of a preconcerted arrangement with
the orchestra. My attendants would talk on the stage,
which was not kind; but on the whole, the Scene went
admirably, and I only hope that all Amateurs who determine
upon representing the works of the Divine WILLIAM, will
bring to his smallest characters the same amount of careful
§ as I on this occasion gave to the minor part of Friar

Minor? A sudden thought: he was a Friar Minor. I
wish I’d thought of this before. Another time, however,
must do for this. Till then, farewell !

MINISTERIAL BABY SEIOW.
We are not, as a rule, partial to the exhibitions called Baby Shows'
as we believe them beneficial neither to parents nor infants. . A recent
display of the kind may, however, be regarded as exceptional. It had
been known for some time that a not unnatural difference of opinion
existed between the parents of two infants, of good birth, touching the
comparative merits of their offspring, and it was finally agreed that both
children should be exhibited in public. In accordance with a not
uncommon custom in the sporting world, the competitors registered
feigned names, but there was little secret as to the real position of
MRs. THANKFUL and MRs...THREEcourses. At the appointed date
they duly appeared with their interesting progeny, and the show took
place at Leeds and at Chester. Both parents have reason to be proud
of their children. MRs. ThankFUL's infant, “John,” though small for
his age, evinces great liveliness and some precocity. At first there was
a difficulty in inducing him to submit to examination, but at a hint
from his parent he assumed confidence, took notice in a very decided
way, and indeed surprised many persons by the loudness of his voice,
and the peremptory way in which he signified his wishes. MRs.
THREEcourses introduced her child, “WILLIAM very gracefully,
disclaimed any merit in being the parent, and begged to submit him to
ublic judgment. He immediately created a strong impression in his
avour, was not in the least shy, and indeed has caught up some funny
little words, such as “put that in your pipe,” which caused great
amusement among the spectators. He is evidently, a child who has
been most carefully reared, and he promises, exceedingly well. His
parent, with much tact, paid a beautiful compliment to her rival, which
told well upon the public. It was finally decided, and we think wisely,
that a verdict should be postponed until the interesting young folks
should have had an opportunity of being seen in the Metropolis, which,
after all, is the great court of final º At present they may be
considered as Feeling their Feet. They were therefore withdrawn,
MASTER John THANKFUL, exclaiming, “Me tum again,” MASTER
WILLIAM THREEcoURSEs ejaculating something which was interpreted
by his delighted parent to mean that he loved all the people. With-
out prejudging the case, we may record that we consider them both
#: * boys, and we shall watch their future career with the greatest
Interest.
“PARDON'S THE WORD FOR ALL.”—Cymbeline.
THIS Paragraph, from the Star, it need not be said that Mr. Punch is
only too happy to conserve for posterity:—
“In the number of the Augusta Sentinel, of May 2nd, was the last printed relic of
slavery likely to be seen in the South. It was the advertisement of “T. SAvAGE
HAyward, auctioneer,” who proposed to sell at the ‘Lower Market, on May 2nd,
the coloured man PETER, a finished waiter, and the negro woman LAURA, a good
field hand." GENERAL UPTON reached the city next day, and T. SAvAGE HAYward
was glad to escape.”
PETER and LAURA are free... But surely the Americans will not spoil
the satisfaction with which Mr. Punch reflects that this man and
woman, and thousands of other men and women, are no longer in
danger of being ordered to the auction-block. There is a “finished
waiter” called DAVIs, who, having finished, waits for the end, and a
very good “field hand”, called LEE, whose hand was in many a
memorable field. Surely there is such a word in Johnson's Dictionary
as “pardon”—we are certain that it would have been in WEBSTER’s,
had DANIEL lived till now; and we are equally sure that if SHERIDAN
be consulted, the word will be found. Our cousins will see that we
are not interfering, but are referring them to American authorities only.
In the old days slaves were sacrificed on the tomb of heroes, but let
not heroes be sacrificed on the tomb of slavery.
A Drop of Consolation.
MR. WHALLEY was very unhappy all day on the 8th, because DR.
MANNING was being consecrated Archbishop of Westminster. But the
honourable Member cheered up on reading in the Glow worm (new
evening º that the consecration was performed by DR. ULLA-
THORNE, of Birmingham. “MANNING is only a Brummagem Arch-
bishop, after all,” said. MR. WHALLEY, and went, comforted, to his
POLITICS AND ARt.
It is remarkable that in view of the approaching General Election,
no eminent Photographer has put himself forward with a proposal to
represent the people.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION.
(By A CRITIc who couldN'T GET IN.)
R. Pusch,--The present, Ninety-seventh . Exhi-
bition of the Royal Academy is said to be the
best that we have had for many years. This may
be so, but as I have made three attempts to get
into the West Room, and failed on each occasion,
I am not in a position to offer an opinion on that
oint.
p But although I have not seen the pictures, I
have seen much that has interested me. Gifted
as I am with a powerful imagination, I had little
difficulty in persuading myself that the groups
and incidents I witnessed at the entrance and in
the lobby were, in point of fact, so many objects
i. and I have attempted, generally with
success, to identify them with, the recognised
Catalogue. I assure you, Sir, that this method
of visiting the Academy is infinitely more agree-
able than that which involves wading through a
surging mass of voluminous petticoats, the pro-
prietresses of which claim the privileges of
their own sex, while they push and ...; In
the manner of the most uncouth members of
ours. Moreover, I have found myself on each
occasion to be completely free from that, hideous
epidemic, or rather epacademic, the Academy
eadache. - -
I was much struck, on reaching the building, with
the work of art I have sketched in the margin;
Curious to learn the meaning of that quiet stolid
determination which characterises, the features and
attitude of this stalwart soldier, I hunted about him
for a number by which he might be identified in the
Catalogue, and after much labour I contrived to
decipher the figures 542 on the heel-plate of his rifle.
On referring to the catalogue Idiscovered that this
work of art was the design of MR. Poynter, and was
christened Faithful unto Death. It represents, Mr.
Aunch, a stalwart soldier of Herculaneum, who,
having received no orders to quit his post, remains
faithful to his duty, while the city is being †: y
destroyed. Qbserve the dogged determined expres-
sion with which he watches, the approach of a
hideous doom. I noticed a star on collar and
accoutrements, and on j to the catalogue I
found that, in accordance with a recent regulation,
it was intended to indicate that the work of art was
sold... I shed a tear for the soldier of Herculaneum
(much to his surprise, for he asked me if I was
unwell), and passed on.
My attention was next arrested by a remarkably
striking group on the steps leading to the entrance.
By some mistake, no number was attached to it, but
this was quite unimportant, for the group told its tale so completely
that I doubt whether I should have taken the trouble to refer to the
Catalogue, even if it had been ticketed. The subject of the picture
was evidently, Sleeping Satyr Startled by Nymph, and I have no hesi-
tation in expressing my pleasure at this recurrence to the classic subjects
FAITH FUL UNTo
DEATH.
SLEEPing satyr startled by NYMPH.
sº popular in the days when Art was in its most legitimate stage,
The grotesque clumsiness of the Sleeping Satyr is artistically contrasted
with the stately grace of the Nymph.
I passed on to the entrance of the building, and here I was struck by
the immense artistic power displayed in No. 559, which, on referring to
my Catalogue, I discovered to be, White-
field Preaching in Moorfields, A.D. 1742.
The picture ... | i. º ..
peculiar pigeon-hole pulpit of the period:
the .# throng around him, ...
gle and strive to get at him. The good
man takes no heed of the *:::: tumult,
but with a placid smile mantling his ex-
pressive features ly continues his
occupation of collecting coins for a local
tabernacle, from the enthusiastic little
band of devotees which constitutes his
congregation.
In a retired nook on the left side of the
entrance, I remarked avery curious study.
It ..i. as you Yi. ſº for a
ged grotesque power, which is quite
j after the namby-pamby MAUDs
and MARIANAs with which our exhibitions
are ordinarily flooded. I allude to No. 98,
which I found, on reference to my Cata-
logue, to be the Visit ºf Cardinal Pozzo-
bºil to the Zºey of Giarawalls, ion.
bardy, in 1750. The stately dignity of the
haughty old Cardinal, in the curious ecclesiastical costume of the
day, is effectively set off by
the . of mingled
awe and admiration depicted
in the countenances of the
|Father Superior of the
| Abbey, and his subordinate.
|The Abbey of Chiaravaile is,
as we all know, in Lombardy,
|but as the daring Artist has
|re resented the rugged old
| Abbot with a life-like goitre,
it is not improbable that he
was an importation, from
some monastic establishment
in southern Switzerland or
modern Savoy.
I was much pleased with
an amusing sketch by MR. . . . - -
A. LEwis, in the immediate vicinity of the work I have just noticed.
|The picture is described in the Catalogue as The last Number, but this
is palpably a misprint for
- The Lost Number. A
young Lady is about to
take her departure from
(say) the Academy Exhi-
bition, and on applying
for her parasol, finds that
she has mislaid the num-

be identified to the satis-

is in charge of the umbrella

Girl. “ANY USE OF ME WAITING !”
Boy. “No ; I only cAME YESTERDAY. MoRNING, AND AIN'T HALF FULL YET.”
NO EXPOSURE FOR USURERS.
PUNCH,
YoUR friend, MR. PATERFAMILIAs, who has sons at Oxford or Cambridge,
was doubtless pleased to see the letter from “Five Freshmen” of the latter seat
of learning, and the article relative thereto, on the subject of “University Usurers,”
in the Times of the Derby Day last week. The j that we money-lenders
* to * put down by the Press, was probably highly gratifying to that respectable
Old gent.
I dare say you virtuous public writers thinks your’re a going to come it over us
like you did over the Quacks; though I’m glad to see that lots of country papers
still publishes their advertisements in spite of your teeth. But we defy you.
Expose our operations, or practices as you call them, as much as you like., Tell
how we discount a bill, and renew it from time to time with interest received in a
few years quadrupling the original sum, still to be paid. Explain all about our
sending circulars to undergraduates, and canvassing them like wine-merchants or
tailors. That won't hurt us a bit. The boys, we does is a sort of spooneys that
can't put this and that together. They ain’t the gumption to apply anything
whatever that's told 'em only in general terms, even if they reads it, and they
reads nothing but the larky and spicy bits in the papers. . General observations
has no more effect upon 'em than they has on the mind of a female. Talking about
usurers and their doings, don’t put 'em up not in the least to such as me. But
tell them that AMINADAB is a rascally usurer, an extortioner, and a scoundrel, that
charges 60 i. cent, and advise them to have º to do with him or else
they’ll be cheated, and give 'em both my name and address, and they’ll under-
stand that. There you has me, like Detector had the Quacks. , But that’s just
what you daren't do, thank the law of libel, and the judge that lays, it down, and
the jury as takes it from the judge's mouth, and the barrister whom the most noto-
rious rascal of us all can always hire.

Libel Bill. Bless him " I trust his constituents won't forget to return him again.
PROGRESS AT HIGH PRICES.
We’re rejoicing in old-fashioned weather,
But we live in a new-fashioned day;
Is it better or worse, altogether,
Than the Past that has vanished away?
Less than we our progenitors traded
In construction, and texture, and store,
And we make much more money than they did,
But we have to pay very much more.
We’ve repealed a vast load of taxation
from aſ trammels to set Commerce free s
But price rises on that operation,
As when duty is taken off tea.
Bread is cheap; gutta percha, and supple
India-rubber at small cost abound;
But now fowls are nine shillings a couple,
And beef’s more than a shilling a pound.
There is cheap stuff for claret that passes,
But good port’s inaccessibly dear,
With regard to the drink of the masses,
You can hardly get any good beer.
The cigar that at threepence was sold,
Can't be had under double that figure;
While it costs twice as much as of old,
Neither better the weed is, nor bigger.
Ways and means of investing your cash
At much profit, once few, now are many,
If you'll just run the risk of a crash,
With the chance of not getting back any.
Rate of interest higher you’ll find,
If you take no account of futurity,
Nor bear WELLINGTON's maxim in mind,
That good interest means bad security.
There are railways, increasing old towns,
Forming new ones round every station;
But they’ve cut º the fields and the downs,
And disfigured the face of the nation.
And there now is a project on foot
To make Oxford materially greater
By a Factory, smirching with soot
The grey piles of that fair Alma Mater |
Manufactures and arts, bearing fruit,
Have extended, but refuse deliver,
With the sewage of towns, to pollute
Every once crystal streamlet and river;
Bleach the herbage and blacken the air
With the foul acrid smoke that they vomit,
Which you, but for its hue, might compare
To the tail of a pestilent comet.
Thiſ have poisoned the grayling and trout;
They have nearly destroyed all the salmon.
Thus it is, with high wages, no doubt,
We are paid for the service of Mammon.
To our new ways, advanced on our old,
_Some advantages, doubtless, are owing,
We are getting a great deal of gold; .
Very well, but oh! where are we going?
FASHIONABLE MOVEMENTS.

THE Elephants residing in the Regent's Park packed up
their trunks last Saturday, and started for their favourite
watering-place, namely, the big pond, at the back of their

Now, Sir, what the º of a kilomètre may be, I have no idea
whatever. Of course, I know that it is a measure consisting of a
thousand measures, but how long is each of them? Nobody can tell
without a table of French weights and measures, with their English

which contain, the words “gramme,” and “kilogramme,” and “litre,”
and hectare,” and so on. "What do they mean? I wish you would

LETTER FROM A SCHOLAR.
St. Simon's College, Pierhead, Baeotiashire,
DEAR MR. PUNCH, June 14th, 1865.
We are having our Examination now, and all of us are in an
awful funk except PETMAN and SweateR Major. Some of our fellows
say that old GINGER (that’s our Second Master) has told PETMAN what
a lot of the questions are to be, which is beastly unfair, and Jones
junched his head for it yesterday. We are quite sure it’s true, because
|. has favoured him ever since he sneaked about the 5th Form fellows,
lathering his (I mean old GINGER's) boots one Sunday, and none of the
fellows #. him, because he is no end stingy, and won't subscribe to
anything unless he is obliged to by the rules. So, if he gets a prize, we
are going to make him “run the muck,” and ToMKINs and l have
knotted our handkerchiefs jolly hard, ready for it. SweATER Major
ain't a bad sort of fellow, on } he never comes out to football or cricket,
and goes and works in the octor's garden instead, and the fellows
i. im in a wax by saying the Doctor gives him sixpence a week
to do it.
We had our Latin paper on Monday, and it was a beastly hard one.
The fellows say Gower set it, and he only came this half, and is awfully
strict, and won’t let us do our work together, hecause he says it’s just
as bad as copying, which is a beastly cram. Weil, first of all we had to
translate Ode 15, Book i. of Horace. Sweater Major says I construed
two bits awful, and has been chaffing me no end about getting a licking
from the Doctor, so I want you to tell me whether it’s really as bad
as Sweater says.
This is the first bit: “Mala ducis avi domum, quam multo repetet
Graecia milite,” and this is how I did it: “You are drawing apples to
the house of your grandfather, which Greece will seek for again with a
large force of militia.” SweATER says it’s all wrong, but I don't
believe it, because ToMKINs and I looked all the words out together.
Then I said that “Pectes Caesariem” was “Thou shalt comb Caesar:”
and I know that's all right, although that conceited ass, Sweated, did
laugh at it. Then there are two questions I want to ask you about.
No. 7 was, “How were the horses of Apollo harnessed ? Give your
authority for your answer.” I said they were driven tandem, an
quoted “TANDEM venias precamur . . . . augur Apollo.” No. 12 was
“Have you any reason for believing that Charon was an ill-tempered -
man?” I said, “He had to cross the Styr so often that he became as
‘cross as two sticks.’”
I hope you’ll let us know next Wednesday, because ToMKINs and I |
have ordered a Punch, and there'll be three tarts gone if you don't.
Believe me, dear Mr. Punch, yours truly,
GULLY.
P.S. Don't you think Tom KINs ought to go halves in the stamp for

THE HANDEL PARLIAMENT.
IC sumus iterum—or, less classically speaking,
“here we are again: ” four thousand performers
and more than forty thousand listeners, all pre-
pared to take another turn with HANDEL. To
those of us past thirty, it hardly seems three
years have passed since our last festival. But
the years are as fugacious now as in the time of
Postumus, and they fly away the faster the older
that we grow.
The Handel Parliaments are triennial, as
everybody knows; this was one of the five points
in the charter which established them. . Another
point was that the Parliaments should always
meet at Sydenham, seeing that its Palace is the
only place in England big enough to hold them.
Equality of districts—in the orchestra, that is—
was allotted to the singers, and no property
qualification was required in the electors, that
is, in the hearers who elected to be present—
further than the money which they paid for their
admission. #. one who has a half-guinea about
him, may readily obtain a seat in the Parliament
at Sydenham : and what he hears in the three
days there will be far better worth listening to
than what is heard in any three months in the
Parliament at Westminster. There will never
be such harmony at St. Stephen's as old HAN-
DEL's, even were MR, WHALLEY to sing there
every evening.
Unlike the gentleman in Shakspeare, Mr. Punch
is ever merry when he hears sweet music: but
there is far too much of wisdom in his merri-
ment, for him simply to crack jokes about the
Handel festival. Such music as our HANDEL
wrote, inspires a kind of “awful mirth,” which
is more enjoyable than simple mundane merri-
- - ment; , The pleasure that one feels in hearing his
ØØ13.3% ãº 2 ſº harmonies, not merely entertains the mind
- ui raises and refines it. Hºnori said he wished
to make men better by his music; and surely
any one who listens to such sermons in tones
must feel the nearer heaven for them. Sneer
as sceptics may, a religion must be heavenly to
inspire such heaven-born strains as those of the
Messiah.
After sentiments like these, Mr. Punch need
.# say that, among his other, gifts, he is
ifted with an ear—with two, in fact—for music.
t is not everybody who is similarly fortunate.
There are people in the world whose relish for
sweet sounds is limited to those which are
extractable from codfish. Yet even they, if they
be wise, will go and take a turn with NDEL.
At the festival forthcoming there will be much
to J. the eye, and not the hearing merely.
A deafman and a blind one alike may find some
pleasure in it. The sight of that vast orchestra,
when filled with its four thousand, is quite
worth a trip to Sydenham, for it is not every day
One sees º an acre of white waistcoats.
When the Parliament assembles, the honour-
able Member for the kettledrums will take his
seat in front of them, and will be recognised no
doubt as a ChIPP of the old block. The Members
- for the ophicleide, the trombone, and the trumpet
will all be seated near him, and kept somewhat in the background, as people with much brass about them always ought to be. The front
seats will be occupied by Members who intend to play first fiddle in the }. iament, just as the front benches are occupied by those who
play first fiddle in the House. For the maintenance of order, MR. Costa will preside, and, like the Speaker, lead the voices, while himself
remaining mute. Any one who fails to catch his eye at the right time will be pretty sure to “catch it. in quite another sense. Above
him some half mile or so—for one cannot speak with certainty in such a monstrous orchestra—a seat will be retained for the harmonious
BRownsmith, who perhaps, by way of interlude, will have his organ-bellows blown by the Harmonious Blacksmith. . . .
How HANDEL would have loved to hear his music played as we who live now hear it! Two hundred were, in his time, a large body of
performers, and who would then have dreamed of hearing twenty times that number? Yet this is how we, now serve up the “roast beef of
music,” as HANDEL's has been christened; and when the four thousand all burst forth into sound, and “the many rend the skies with loud
applause,” surely no one more than HANDEL would have enjoyed a sitting in the Handel Parliament.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
on DAY, June 12th. The
Lords re-assembled,
and the EARL OF
DERBy demanded what
PRESIDENT , Johnson
meant by declaring that
A merchants trading with
the still blockaded
American ports were
pirates, when at the
very worst they could
be only smugglers ?
LORD RUssell allowed
that it was a curious
business, but said he
believed that the PRE-
sIDENT only intended
to frighten people.
By the way, great
complaints are made of
the way in which LoRD
Russell, mumbles an-
swers and statements.
Why does he not go
- and take a lesson or so
º, in elocution from MR.
D'ORsey or MR.FRED.
WEBSTER P He fills a
position which makes
it very important that he should be faithfully reported, but it is said to be impossible
to report him. Punch will be obliged to give him instruction if he does not mend
his utterances. - - ---- --
The Lords then took the Second Reading of the Union Chargeability Bill. It was
moved by LoRD GRANVILLE, and seconded by Lord BRough AM, whom we and the
LoRD ChanceLLOR were ºf: happy to see in his 8. again. The DUKE
of RUTLAND opposed the Bill, and tried to refer it to a Committee, which meant
the throwing it over. But the Peers of England declined to withhold justice, and
the Second Reading was carried by 86 to 24, . It went through Committee inter in
the week, after a condemnatory protest from LoRD KINGspown, whose opinion, it
being one entitled to respect, we are sorry, to see º; to a good measure.
Punch adds that the calm and decorous way in which the Bill has been treated by
such of the “territorial aristocracy” as dislike it, contrasts with the noisy bitter-
ness of the “country party” below. -
The Commons treated themselves to a battle on the Catholic Oaths Bill, and SIR
HUGH CAIRNs proposed to restore the vow never to injure the Church.
DISHAELI was compelled, by the necessities of party, to support the amendment
and to, make a speech...Being obliged to say something, it occurred to him to
prove that attempts on the part of the Catholics to get rid of injustice might do
them harm, because such efforts would set the Protestant mind in arms against
Fopery. This, and a fº deal more, the best part of which was MR., DISRAELI's
evident disbelief in the utility of oaths in reference to political and theological
matters, made up an address which may not have been very acceptable to the
extremely Protestant... SIR GEORGE GREY asserted the right of the Catholic to
perfect º MR. Whiteside declared that we were going to break up a solemn
compact, and MR. HoRSMAN answering that the oath of 1829 was never intended
to be permanent, but was devised to quiet the alarms of foolish people who were
afraid of Catholic Emancipation. Both sides put forth their might on the division,
when SIR Hugh was defeated #. 166 to 147, majority 19 for relieving the Catholics
from an offensive oath. The Bill went through Committee later.
Tuesday. Moved by certain º railway accidents which have occurred, Loºp
St. LEONARDs introduced a Bill for preventing railway people from locking both
doors of a carriage. - -
On the Committee on the Bill for amending the Public House Closing Act, so as
to let compositors and others obtain refreshment, LoRD REDEsdale was good
enough to prescribe for the class which complained of existing restriction. He said
that it was not good for persons to take refreshments just before going to bed at
three or four in the morning, and that it would be better to go to bed without
them. Perhaps, on the whole, Englishmen may safely be trusted to settle for them.
selves the º proposed to be settled by LoRD Rºjº. LoRD Donough-
MoRE asked whether their Lordships, after a late debate, would like to go to bed
without a sandwich and a glass of sherry P Altering glass to bottle, we share his
inº and subscribe his protest.
The CHANCELLOR made an excellent speech in support of the Partnership Amend-
ment Bill, showing that Lord MANSFIELD, in 1775, was the author of all partner-
ship evils. He gave an erroneous decision, and the lawyers have woven a network
of chicanery, around it. Now it is proposed to brush all away, for as LoRD WEST-
BURY_said, the common-sense rule, in matters of commerce, is Freedom. Just our
own feeling—we consider ourselves free to order whatever we like, and free to pa
for it whenever we like, and we are glad to find our *. sustained by suc
high authority. We are also glad that the Bill was read a Second Time in spite of a
groan from LoRD ST. LEONARDs, and a moan from LoRD WENSLEYDALE, and that
it has passed through Committee.
Decidedly, the speech, which of all the †. of the
Session, has been most interesting to a Londoner, was
delivered to-day in the Commons by SIR WILLIAM FRASER.
He brought before the House a graphic statement of the
hideous state of the streets of London. Badly paved, badly
lighted, badly, cleansed, the Metropolis is a disgrace to the
world. London is split up into parishes, and the meanest
jealousies arise. A .#. opposes the improvement of
a street because it would give an advantage to his rival in
trade. The paving of one side of St. James's Street is
different from the other, and this is because each side is in a
different parish. As for the slush after snow, it is simply
horrible, and we always hunger and thirst to roll our vestry.
men in the mess, for their souls', good and for their
reformation. The fact is, that all the two-penny local autho.
rities must be cleared off, and the Metropolis must be con-
signed to the Metropolitan Board. Let us do for the
London parishes what we are doing for those in the *:
—spread the area all over the Province of Brick. e
should not wonder if this were done next Session. SIR
GEORGE GREY intimated that it was the right course.
Meantime
A debt which we're happy to pay, Sir,
We owe to SIR. W. FRASER,
And we hope that M.P.
Will be present to see -
The parishes all swept away, Sir.
Does anybody wish to know the points of a so-called de-
bate got up on the subject of the Belfast riots? MAJOR
O'Reilly attacked the Magistrates. SIR Robert PEEL
admitted that they had lost, their heads—metaphorically.
SIR. H. CAIRNs held their brief, and described them as
angels, and the Mayor who bolted to Harrogate as a kind
of archangel. MR. WHALLEY contended that the Orange-
men had a right to sing “Boyne Water,” and was invited
to execute that ditty himself, but did not. After much
wrangle, the House refused further *. by 132 to 39, and
then refused Harbours of Refuge § 1 to 99. -
MR. BERKELEY had proclaimed his intention of bringing
on his Ballot motion, but thinking that he could not do jus-
tice to the novel subject at 1220 P.M., declined to go on.
He might just as well have proceeded—some farces are only
useful to fill a bill and play the people out.
MR. Locke, less scrupulous, moved the Second Reading
of the Theatres Bill. SiR GeoRGE GREY advised him to
MR. withdraw it, and move for a Committee of Inquiry next
year. he gets one we shall attend, and favour the Com-
mittee with our opinion of all our theatrical friends, dra-
matic authors, managers who don't send us boxes enough,
actors and actresses, and the profession generally. MR.
BERKELEY, who had been taught a silly antithesis about
theatres and pothouses, was savagely º: to scorn by
MR. Locks, who said he knew who had crammed MR.
BERKELEY with that flippancy. DR. BRADY also opposed
the Bill, which inclines us to think that there must be some
sense in it. However, it will not pass, and the whole ques-
tion, which is a large and interesting one, must be looked
into. The debate was adjourned.
Wednesday. The Bill, moved by MR. Goschen, for
abolishing the Qxford test, was debated. MR. GLADstone
opposed it. After a discussion of some interest, the Bill,
which is intended to let the Dissenters take the degree
which gives a voice in the government of the University,
was carried by 206 to 190. There is a House of Lords
above us.
[Omnia sub ictu mors habet. A singular, and melancholy
incident marked this debate. A young nobleman, of great
talent, rose to speak at half-past two. One hour, earlier,
he had, without knowing it, succeeded to the title of an
elder brother, who had expired suddenly. The speaker
(LORD ROBERT Cecil) had become Lord CRANBourne,
heir apparent to the MARQUISATE of SALISBURY.]
Thursday. A new writ was moved for Coventry, a seat
having been vacated by the death of a great and good man,
SIR. Joseph PAxton. What kind of a successor, the
Liberals of Coventry have selected for him shall be judged

your kind attention, wish you good evening and pleasant dreams."
Is it not lovely? How the Commons will hang, breathlessly, on such
divine talk. We long to hear the maiden speech.
MR. CAIRD made a good speech about barley, but MR. WHALLEY
was not asked to sing,
“When the free and happy barley
Is smiling on the scythe.”
After a Malt-Tax debate (the particulars of which we will publish in a
supplement, if requested by three subscribers of twenty years’ standing)
and the getting through a good deal of business, MR. GLADSTONE an-
nounced the important fact that LORD MONTEAGLE, (olim SPRING RICE,)
was going to retire from the office of Comptroller of the Exchequer, on
a pension, whereupon some personalities were exchanged.
SIR FitzRoy KELLY's Law of Evidence Bill went into Committee,
and various Members gave some interesting accounts of their views of
the character of Woman, how she in her innocence might be deceived by
artful Man, but how artful Man always got the worst of it when pretty
Woman was placed in a witness-box, with private instructions to cry at
the right time. One Member told a piquant story about a fair Circassian
who gained the day by being attired in very diaphanous raiment. MR.
Roebuck, who had returned from a signal victory over the Philistines
at Sheffield, declared his conviction of the angelic nature of Woman,
and notice was taken of his having for once expressed sympathy with
º: beings. The Bill was so mutilated that SIR F. KELLY with-
rew it.
Friday. LoRD WESTMEATH, for once, did good service by a long
and elaborate exposure of the ridiculous mock-popery soup prepared for
foolish, congregations by foolish Clergymen. He adduced his proofs,
and called on the Episcopal Bench to interfere. The Bishop of Lon.
DoN said that, unless there were an amendment of the rubric, the Bishops
could do little. But why does not the Bench initiate the desirable
reform * Do they wish laymen to re-edit the Prayer Book?
Four persons were bit on the previous day by mad dogs. SIR
GeoRGE GREY, interrogated by MR. DAMER, said that the police, had
power to destroy dogs known to be dangerous, a regular circumlocu-
tion answer. Do dogs who intend to go mad give the police notice in
writing, dated from Barking?
. On a Dockyard debate, MR. SEELY moved a resolution that it was
inexpedient to appoint, ignorant naval officers, however brave, to the
control of the dockyards. Valour does not imply a knowledge of ship.
building:, LQRD PALMeRSTON, of course, declared that all officers were
profoundly skilful, as well as preternaturally valiant. On the first
division Government was beaten, but on the second MR. SEELY's
motion was rejected.
Rosa Bon HEUR receives the order of the Legion of Honour from the
EMPERQR of FRANCE, who calls to deliver it personally to the painter.
IORP PALMERSTON does not think that the civil and military Orders of
the Bath should be united, lest soldiers and sailors should undervalue a
distinction which they would share with mere civilians.
The week concluded with the farce called the Ballot Motion. It was
humorously played by the only two actors who have parts in it
MR. BERKELEY giving due liveliness to the part of Mr. Panacea, an
LORD PALMERston being good-naturedly cynical as Mr. Trustee. By
118 to 74 the spectators decided that the farce should be shelved.
A PRETTY PUZZLE.
“Now, DEAR, I BET You ANYTHING You CAN'T TELL which Is The Faont or
My NEW Bonn ET "
THE WENGEANCE OF THE STOMACH.
(A Song of the Whitebait Season.)
Oh! give me not more work than I can do,
Or, by the laws that rule this kingdom, Man,
As sure as you’re alive I'll punish you,
Embitter, and abridge your mortal span.
First, I’ll protest, rebel: in spite of that
If you load me with more than I can bear,
The superflux I’ll have put down in fat,
And spoil your figure for you; so beware
Neglect this warning, and, with gross abuse,
Continue still my powers to overstrain;
Well, then disorder 1 shall next produce,
And put you to uneasiness and pain.
I’ll send redundant blood throughout your frame,
And stuff you, pursy, panting with distress;
Repletion shall suffuse your eyes, inflame
Your cheeks, your labouring heart and lungs oppress.
Too much, too rich, yet go on taking in,
And I will brand you, so that men may see:
I'll throw out, in eruptions on your skin,
The messes you’ve ingested into me.
With me your liver, too, you make your foe,
And we will pay you out in pretty style,
What indigestion is we’ll let you know, -
And make you understand what’s meant by bile.
Headache, vertigo, noises in the ears,
Congestion causing pressure on the brain,
And palpitations, qualms, and spasms, fears
Of worse, for which all physic will be vain.
For these inflictions, and for more than these,
If you keep overworking me, look out;
Expect particularly that disease
Known as the stomach's great revenge, the gout.
At length, unless you put on me no more,
But to my last remonstrances attend,
There’s dropsy or paralysis in store,
There’s apoplexy for you—and the end.
A Strange Millennial Machine.
IN. the course of a late debate in the French Corps Législatif. M. KERVEGUEN
mentioned the recent invention of an “infernal machine” at Toulon, which, he said,
rendered useless the construction of iron-cased vessels, and opened the prospect
of perpetual and universal peace. If the prospect of universal and perpetual peace,
opened by an infernal machine, is destined to be realised, that infernal machine is
a devilish good thing.
Now go, with measure share the civic feast,
Or wisely dine at Greenwich or Blackwall,
But if you choose to make yourself a beast,
And me a slave, you see your way, that’s all !

DIED JUNE 8th, 1865.
BEAR him hºpefully and humbly, through the genial summer weather,
To quiet E'nsor grayeyard, where the dead have flowers around them;
While titled and untitled, Lords and lowly, weep together,
Hearts with scarce a common tie but the love of him that bound them.
Needs but a simple tomb-stone, with birth and death carved neatly,
And no hollow-sounding praises of him whose work is past.
His monument is elsewhere—in those Chatsworth gardens stately,
In the far-off Crystal Palace, where the world looked on him last.
The yeoman's son, the gardener's boy—still true to his vocation—
He won a worthy, master, who prized him at his worth :
For grand designs that came to him he found, or made, occasion;
And lived to sit at great men's feasts, but ne'er blushed for his birth.
Let him sleep almost in hearing of the many-voiced fountains
He loved to turn and tame, and make his fancy's bidding do:
Now dancing crowned with rainbow, now adown the mimic mountains
Dashing in crests of foam, now wreathed in figures quaint and new.
Let him sleep almost in breathing of the many-coloured flowers
He loved to tend and trim and train—a gladness to the sight;
On his grave still warm and wooingly drop down the summer showers;
Bloom, field-flowers, bright around him, in the pleasant summer light.
No gentler life, no truer heart, no quicker, keener brain,
£er closed, or ceased from labour, than his that fieli'here:
Long they’ll talk of the “Grand Gardener” round Chatsworth's fair
demesne
And many a hard hand, at his name, will wipe a well-earned tear.
BULL DOGMATISM FOR THE DOG DAYS.
SOMEBODY has specified, as a possible example of the expressive
power of sound, music descriptive of a man's going abroad, and chang-
ing lis religion. DR. MANNING's Pastoral, just published, may be
calculated to suggest to some eccentric composer a combination of
quavers and crotchets representing a man's going over to Rome; but
there are passages in that address rather likely to check any Romeward
movement, and to invite the exercise of the musician's skill on the
theme of a man's remaining in #. and abiding in the Established
Church. The Pastoral for which the British Public is indebted to
DR. MANNING contains the following passages:—
“It is surely by a dispensation of the Divine Head of the Church that in the.heart of
the nineteenth century, when both the intellects and the wills of men have reached
an excess of unbridled licence in matters of revelation, of morals, and of politics,
that the Vicar of our Lord, the teacher of all Christians—as the Council of Florence
entitles him—should twice in these last years have spoken with the voice of infal-
lible truth. . . . . . The Dogmatic Bull of the Immaculate Conception, and the
Encyclical of last year, will, we believe, mark an era in the reconstruction of the
Christian order of the world.”
According to DR. MANNING, therefore, belief in the Pope's political
principles, particularly as they regard religious liberty and freedom of
discussion, is equally obligatory with belief in the “Immaculate Con-
ception,” or any other dogma of faith. The errors condemned by his
Holiness, in the Syllabus annexed to his Encyclical, are, in fact, so
many heresies, which everybody who persists in will be dished to all
eternity. Now, any º who º think of changing his religion
for DR. MANNING.'s, knows what he will commit himself, to by taking
that step. It is to be feared that this knowledge will not tend to
remove the Protestant prejudice which has refused, throughout England,
with the exception of one constituency, to return a single Roman
Catholic Member to Parliament.

ANECDOTAGE."
MR. PUNCH has been asked by a .."; Correspondents, who, on
the strength of a fortnight's sojourn in an English hotel in Paris assume
a taste for French literature, “why he never gives any Charming Little
Anecdotes, like those which make Le Grand Journal, Figaro, Le Journal
pour Éire, and other delightful Parisian Fº so spiritual and so in-
teresting.” He has been looking at the intellectual productions in
uestion. They appear to his English mind to be the merest twaddle,
avoured by impertinence. In some cases they are simply puffs, no
doubt paid for in some coin or other. But as he scorns to be churlish,
he has made an arrangement with his Foolish Young Man to supply the
article required—omitting, only, (with apologies) another little flavour,
very dear to the fashionable patrons and patronesses of MADeMoſselle
The REs A, but not admired in the British household. . The Foolish
Young Man has, with commendable P. sent in the follow-
ing specimens of his art—the scenes, of course, being laid in England.
I.
Jones-we all know Jones—is a papa.
The infant is a boy. -
Papa Jones turned into Farrance's the other day, in hopes to see
some one who would congratulate him on, his new honours. Nor was
he disappointed. The wit Robinson was there, taking some Punch a la
Roraine.
Now Jones calls himself an original writer—and steals.
“You will want godfathers,” said Robinson.
“I am puzzled about that.”
“Well, ask Paul Bedford to be one.”
“Why Paul Bedford **
“Because your son will then be worthy of his sire.”

At the Zoological Gardens last Sunday afternoon there was even
more than the usual crowd of pious persons eager to admire the works
of creation, especially when manufactured into costume. -
Jenkins and his friend Tompkins, dressed their best (according to
their City lights) sauntered elegantly up to the witty Lady Blinking-
bury, who was seated near the porcupines.
“Most delightful gardens in London,” said Jenkins.
“They would be, but for the beasts,” said her ladyship.
III.
Which, by the way, reminds us of a still better ºf
Widgery Shattock has lately been elected into the United Grunters.
It was thought that he would be black-balled. He thought so himself.
Those who did not keep him out have a crime and a blunder to atone
for. That is their affair. -
He attends morning, noon, and night. The men think he is dead
when they have seen him only nine times in one day.
“What a pleasant club this is,” he said, in an accession of simple
happiness, to Domitian Spiker, the critic.
'It would be, but for the members,” said Domitian.
But Widgery is too proud and happy to understand this.
iW.
Jingles has produced a new piece at the Frippery. Between our-
selves, all the world does not go to see it., Perhaps all, the world has
bad taste. Jingles would say so, and he should know what bad taste is.
But Jingles goes every night, and laughs at what he supposes to be
his own jokes.
He is very fat, be it remembered.
The other evening, pretty Laura Taggleton, who makes much of a
bad part, was doing her best for J ingles, and showing her talent, and
we may add, her ancles.
Jingles saw Prodder a few stalls off, and leant over to him.
“When I see my own creation vivified so charmingly, I seem like
Pygmalion,” said Jingles.
* More like Pig than Malion,” said Prodder.
What did he mean? V

Joppus was playing croquet with the Hazelporter girls on the lawn
at Wombat. Lodge.
He put his glass into his eye, and inasmuch as he can see much better
without his glass, he struck an atrocious stroke. The ball rolled into
what, as the excellent Mr. Hazelporter calls it the lake, we have no
right to call the pond.

“Why date?” asked saucy Maria Hazelporter.

Qur friend Bleaf, the poet, cannot write good things, at least the
deduction is legal from the fact that he never does.
But sometimes he says a thing which gods and men may tolerate.
Dr. Weazel, his uncle, took him to see a dissection. The poet pre-
tends to take an interest in such sights.
The subject was being duly anatomised, and lectured on, when it
grew dusk.
... Light the gas,” said Dr. Weazel.
“Yes,” said Bleat. “Throw a little light upon the subject.”
Do you think that man can ever be a true poet?
Wiii.
Miss * goes to see her dressmaker very often indeed. I
suppose that all the letters Madame Grenadine hands her are bills for
dress-making. It is odd that a person should make out a bill so often,
but every trade has its own traditions.
Miss Flirtington does not pay so regularly as Madame could desire.
The last time but one that the young lady called in — Street,
Madame said,
: Is your papa a handsome man, Mademoiselle?”
* Yes indeed, Madame. That is, for sixty-one. Why?”
“I am susceptible. Do not let me run the risk of breaking my heart
by seeing him, as I am inclined to do.”
The last time that the young lady called in — Street, she brought
a cheque for Madame Grenadine's bill.
IX.
Flaps, the publisher, is nevertheless a man of wit.
Dronesby, who writes what nobody reads, met him. Dronesby, who
is not young, wears very well, thanks to certain tradesmen.
... How in the world do |. keep your beard so black, said Flaps.
“Well, I don't mind telling you,” said Dronesby. “I dye it. But
don't you tell anybody.”.
“My dear fellow,” said Flaps, “...do you think I would publish any.
thing confided to me by you. You ought to know better.”
X.
Lord C– wants his son to go into Parliament.
Young L-, who is a born ſlåneur, shudders at the idea of bein
º: to do anything at any given date or hour of the day, an
Parliament has its fixtures.
“You have no ambition,” urged his father.
..I have the ambition to be economical,” replied L-
His father laughed outright, and thought of the ravages paternal love
had made in his cheque-book.
“You may laugh, my dear father. But I am serious. The great
object of going into paritament is to escape paying one's debts. I do
that already, as you are good enough to pay mine.”
Lord C– is considering the argument.
A “ROUND MAN.”
The saying about Round men in square holes, and square men in
round holes, is frequently, used. A square man would probably be a
"brick.” What a round man is, the following advertisement informs
us :
to M. & Co.
The advertisers do not state who wants the “Circular Sawyer,” but
they intimate that, as far as they are concerned, “none but efficient
men” of whatever trade “need apply” to them, whatever they may
do to others. Nevertheless, we trust that should the efficient circular

MR.I.AYARD, the other night, in answer to an interrogation about
the British captives in Abyssinia, said it was “a most difficult question
to deal with, and one requiring prudence and circumspection.” That
is just the mischief of it....What the question requires, is circumspec-
tion: what the Foreign Office has employed on it is circumlocution.

RAILWAY SECURITY.
. The British Public, is indebted for a §. of valuable
information to MR; PEELE, solicitor, of Shrewsbury, who
represented the Great Western Railway Company...at
inquest No. 2, on the victims of the last crash resulting
from mismanagement on that line. The Coroner having
summed up:-
“After an absence of about three-quarters of an hour, the jury
returned with a verdict similar to that which had already been found
in the previous inquiry. They considered that the engine No. 5 was
not such as should have been attached to a train of that description;
that the break power was not adequate; that the permanent way was
not in a fit state; that the signal exhibited was not sufficient, nor
shown in a proper manner, and that gross negligence had been dis-
played; but they were unable to attach criminality to any individual.”
Whereupon:-
“Mr. Peele said, on behalf of the Company, there had been only
one anxiety, and that was to ascertain if there was any fault which in
anyway might be remedied in the future. With regard to the per-
manent way, he believed that this line generally was as perfect as
any in the Kingdom.”
The word of MR. PEELE may be taken for the truth of
that statement. Instructed by the Directors of the Great
Western Railway Company, he spoke with authority. The
line to which he referred may be confidently believed to be
“as perfect as any in the kingdom; ” but it may be very
imperfect for all that. The truth of MR. PEELE's assertion
about its perfectness is not at all inconsistent with the fact
that, as the Coroner's jury decided on clear evidence, it
“was not in a fit state.” If then, the Great Western
Railway Directors, speaking through MR.PEELE, are to be
credited, there is every reason to fear that no line what.
ever in the kingdom is in a fit state, and therefore that not
any line is safe. Let Railway Directors mend their ways
tº the Public in the meanwhile look to their lives an
lands.
Sing, Whalley, Sing.
We have been requested by numberless Correspondents
to indicate the song which the Hon. Member for Peter-
borough has been lately so constantly called upon to sing.
We beg to state in reply, that it is his favourite strain:-
“WHALLEY, WHALLEY, up the bank
And Whalley, WHALLEY, down the brae.”
DANGERous-There is talk in Paris of the French army

GREENWICH OBSERVATIONS.
THE custom of proceeding four miles down the river from the foot of
London Bridge, for the purpose of devouring little fishes fried in grease-
froth, is one that every year becomes more and more attractive to the
gullets of Great Britons. As the poet might have sung, if he had
only thought of it:-
'Tis pleasant while at dinner there to watch the stately ships,
And with cooling effervescent drinks to wet the thirsty lips:
'Tis pleasant the eleven plats preceding it to munch,
Then with undiminished appetite the crisp whitebait to crunch.
While sitting in the cosy chairs of QUARTERMAINE or HART, one
envies not one's honourable friends their sittings in St. Stephen's. A
seat in Parliament is more expensive than one at the “Trafalgar,” and
the dry talk that one hears within the House of Commons is far, less
º: music than the popping of champagne corks or the gurgle of
ti º cups, with which, while at the “Ship,” one's ears are sweetly
10kled.
A dinner down at Greenwich is so popular an amusement, that many
people will be interested to learn that HART's and QUARTERMAINE’s
are soon, to be united, and become, in trading phrase, “the same
concern.”. It is said the same concern will be shown at both these
hostelries to the comfort of their guests as has been previously mani-
fested; and, for an assurance of this, it is hoped that the chief manage-
ment will be confided to the careful hands of Mr. Lºwrence." This
ſº has long held the command of the “Ship,” and all who there
ave known him have the knowledge of his having been a most efficient
captain. Except an omelette soufflée, Mr. Punch most heartily detests
all sorts of puffs: but to say that a person is efficient in his business,
can be hardly deemed a puff. M.R. LAwrence, be it noted, is a manager,
not a chef; and although he attends daily to see his whitebait served,
he has no hand in the frying of it. Else, haply Mr. Punch, viewing the
coming union of the QuARTERMAINEs and HARTs—the Greenwich Mon-
tagues and Capulets—might be tempted into making an apposite quota-
tion about good Fryer LAWRENCE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DARING ACT.
HERE is nothing strange that our English singers ap-
nd themselves a little horse, and gracefully retire. Nor
is it a matter for wonder that ADAH. Isaacs MENKEN,
the muscular daughter of the Hebrew Caucasian Race,
should again mount her hobby and perform the barefaced act upon
the bare-backed steed.
But what we are speculating upon, with much pleasurable curiosity,
is how MR. SMITH intends carrying out the latter Fº of his attrac-
tive programme:-" Mazeppa will be performed each evening ºf the week.
º HARRison will appear in Opera after Mazeppa. To us it is
clear that Mazeppa goes first in Mazeppa and is followed by MR HAR-
Rison in some operatic character. This arrangement will certainly
relieve harrowing situations of the drama. In that scene, for instance,
where the wild horse is crossing the stream, and the property vulture is
pecking at the “daring and graceful” spasmodically, the arrangement
will probably be as follows:-
Mazeppa (tied on to the horse's back, and looking as much towards the
audience as is possible under the circumstances). Again that fearful bird
(Alluding to the vulture.) He hovers over me like my evil (bird hesi-
tates, and pecks at him) destiny. (Makes some more remarks about the
fearful bird, and then, with the hand remote from the audience, encourages
the wild steed to ſº Oh, OLINSKA for thee—for thee I would—
(bird pecks at him undecidedly)—for thee I would—(erit horse uner-
pectedly, having had quite enough ºf it).
Then, while the audience, ...; and wondering whether the bird
will ever make up its mind to swoop down upon the apparently defence-
less MENKEN, shudder at the probabilities of their own morbid imagina-
tions, enters, up to his middle in water, MR. HARRIson, in the well-
known Bohemian Girl costume,
Mr. Harrison (looking after Mazeppa). Ha! again he urges on his
wild career | His heart quails, his lips are blanched with hunger |
Sings (still in the water).
N.B. We’ve almost forgotten the libretto, but to the best of our recol.
lection it runs thus:–
When other lips and 0-0-0-other hearts
Their tales of love shall tell,
In language which which which whi-i-ich imparts
(*,” We always sang it like this.)
The power it fills so well.
We never knew what we meant. MR. HARRIson thinks he has, after
long study, ascertained what the words are intended to convey.
Mr. Harrison (still singing in the water):—
There may per-per-haps
Some re-re-co-le-lection be,
Some rec-co-le-herherher-lection be
(This is how we sing it.)
}º. upon the flºº stage should after a while

And you’ll re-me-e-e-ember Me!
And you’ll re-mem-ber,
You'll re-me-e-e-e-e-Em-be-e-er ME!
[Erit MR. HARRIson, despairingly.
Then in the Scene in the Tent when they’re going to murder the
Qld Khan, but can't, the English_Tenor, as Lord Rochester in the
Puritan's Daughter, might follow Mazeppa, or, better, might accom-
pany Mazeppa, during the combat.
Mazeppa (defending the feeble Khan against conspirators). Willains !
Cowards! have at you! [They fight. Slash, crash, dash, &c.

At last we may congratulate the enterprising Master of Cremorne
on a genuine novelty.
THE TRIUMPH OF KINGSTON-ON-THAMES.
Rejoice, O Mayor of Kingston, shout, ye Aldermen, and sing,

Into his bosom freely now shall Kingston's sewage flow,

RAILWAY REFORM IN PARLIAMENT.
S (To Mr. Punch.)
IR,
WHENEven the º of a vessel belonging to the P. and 0.,
or any other great Steam Navigation Company, has the misfortune to
run his ship aground, although by the merest accident, that unlucky
officer, I believe, is invariably suspended.
Why is not the rule thus vigorously applied to poor individuals ex-
tended to rich joint-stock associations? Why is not the liability to
which officers in the Merchant Service are subject not imposed on Railway
Companies? Whenever a train º: off the rails, or a collision occurs,
no matter whether a lot of people are smashed, or even if anybody is
hurt or no, let the company be subject to a heavy penalty. Why
mot ?
Because there are too . Railway Members in the House of Com-
mons. Therefore nothing whatever can be done in the present Parlia-
ment to bring Railway Directors to their senses. Let electors take care
that the Railway interest shall not be too strong for them in the next.
Why cannot the Great Western be forbidden to ruin Oxford with a
hideous factory? Why is it able to set public opinion at insolent defi-
ance in the resolution to persist in that brutal project? Why cannot
Railway Companies' rights of §. be sacrificed to the general welfare
as ...; as those of individuals are to the interests of Railway
Companies? By reason of the multitude of Railway-mongers that
write themselves M.P. - -
But a General Election is at hand. Then will be the time to set all
these things to rights. Different cries will be raised among different
constituencies all over the country; but if self-preservation is the first
law of our common nature, and we have any sense above a pig’s, the
most general of them will be “No Railway Collisions!” “No Whole-
sale sº !” and “No Wandalism!” -
Trusting, for the sake of my dear life and limbs, to hear these cries
wherever I go, believe me, Mr. Punch, Yours truly,
WIATOR.
Rosa Bonheur,
Made Knight of the Legion of Honour, by the EMPREss Eugènie.

Being informed by several parties that you are the great apeal

the Advertizer as the Prince of Wales have lately atended to open a
new Tavern in langam place I wrote to Marborough Palace respectſ,
inviting his Royal lº. to perform simmilar ceremony on the occa-
sion of me opening of a new Music Hall atached to my Premises, wine

º informs me that most like the Prince never saw my Letter, which
think ought to come before Parlament.
“Aar You An ‘Incurable,' SIR, or A
LAGRANGE'S HORSES v. SCHNEIDER'S
LOCOMOTIVES.
Count DE LAGRANGE's Gladiateur and Fille de l'Air have won the
Derby at Epsom, and the Alexandra Plate at Ascot.
“A French firm, at the head of which is M. SchNEIDER, has ob-
tained a contract for Steam Locomotives from the Great Eastern
Railway, in the face of seven English competitors. Other French
houses have obtained contracts for rails and sleepers, for use on
English lines, at cheaper rates and of better quality than the same
articles could be supplied by English houses."
See the Journals, passim.
THAT a French horse of blood and bone,
A British stake should win,
May raise the British sportsman's moan,
And tax that sportsman's tin.
But Gladiators, be their field
The arena or the course,
Will make inferior prowess yield,
Alike in man or horse.
What if a British cup or two
French buffets should adorn,
If e'en our Turfites' riband blue
Should by LAGRANGE be worn ?
BRITANNIA still would hold her own,
And still her balance show,
Were her turf cut beneath her feet,
Her star of sport brought low.
But when the British iron-horse
Before the French turns tail,
When England yields to France, perforce,
The Empire of the rail,
When British trading to French truck
Inglorious comes down,
French metals on French sleepers stuck,
English embankments crown,
Then may BRITANNIA doff the crown
That still her brow environs,
Her trident waive, and sit a slave
Imprisoned in French irons !
His Last Effort.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ONDAY, June 19th.
The Loºp chºs.
CELLOR introduced
a Bill for Editing
the Statute Law.
At present the
written law, which
every English man
woman and child
§: seven) is
ound, or at least
is supposed to

in about Fifty enor-
mous and thick
volumes. The hy-

compress the work
into Twelve vols.,
so that one may be
read to the English-
man's family every
month, and the en-
tire system may be
gone through every
year.
The Lords would
not pass LoRD St.
LeoNARDs’ Bill forbidding the locking, both doors of a railway carriage. They
thought—and wisely—that it is impolitic, to take away any responsibility from the
directors. It is certain that had the Bill passed, and a stationary, engine had ex;
ploded, or a viaduct had fallen down, the railway managers would have attributed
the disaster to Parliamentary interference, -
The Lords' Private-Business Carriage stops the way, so that General Election's
carriage cannot get º -
Gentlemen depute º Canada have been here in conference with the Colonial
Office upon the proposed Confederation, the Defences, and other matters, and the
most satisfactory, results are stated to have been arrived at. The Ambassadors
#. §. in the best spirits, MR. CARDwell dismissing them with the Canadian
Oa ng:
“Go, brothers, go, the Tape's tied fast,
The Office is pleased, and the Minute's passed.”
LORD STANLEY, Chairman of the Patent Laws Commission, has been thinking
for three years on the subject, and has very serious doubts whether it is expedient
to maintain the principle of those laws. Mr. Punch's clear intellect cuts at once to
a conclusion. The word Patent means Open. The system of Patents is to shut
up inventions and inventors. Ergo, the system is a self-contradictory absurdity.
When you have reason for punching a man's head, punch. But, that done
don't keep getting behind him and running minikin pins into him. We have had
our say about Lord AMBERLEY, and should be ashamed to go on nagging, night
after night, about his having had a little sail in Greek waters at the . of the
country. MR HENNessy is a smart Irishman, but does not quite understand the
tone of English gentlemen.
LORD PALMerston declines to give MR. DARBY GRIFFITH the control of the
War Department. -
Colonels DUNNE and FRENCH preferred the oddest grievance which two Colonels
ever submitted to the House. They are unhappy because the ancient Irish Records
are not carefully translated and published. º FREDERIck PEEL explained that
a good deal had been done and was doing in the required direction. We believe
that the collection is soon to be issued, with the following motto from Ireland's
favourite bard:
“While History's Muse the memorial was keeping,
Of all that the dark hand of Destiny weaves,
Beside her the Genius of Erin stood weeping,
For hers was the story that blotted the leaves.”
There will also be an illustration—we wish that DANIEL MacLise would draw it—
9ſ the above scene, with England kindly using a piece of blotting-paper, inscribed
“Civilisation,” and a patent Eraser, marked “Equality,” and thus doing away the
said blots on the Irish page.
MR.HUBBARD thinks that we have been done in the matter of the Treaty with
the Zollverein, because Germany taxes her exported coal, and we have engaged not
to tax ours. 'But Mr. Minº Gibson says that we have gained such valuable
concessions that we have no cause for complaint. But—we ask, simply for the sake
of causing annoyance, and not in the least because we want to know-how will the
account stand when the German Fleet shall be created, and the Germans want no
end of coal for their hundred terrible iron-plated monster steamers?
There was a Forest debate, and in spite of FREd Peel and circumlocution, it is
quite clear that the Crown neglects its W. rights, and that Lords of Manors
and others encroach in all directions. We advise some resolute Member to take
up the subject in the next Parliament, but to do so like a man of sense, not bab-
bling o' green fields, and drawing pensive pictures of wearied folks seeking to bathe
their eyes in leaves, but getting plans of the old forests,
showing what they were, and ought to be, and marking
what pieces have been stolen by SIR TUNBeLLY CLUMsy,
country gentleman, by MR. SMIRKER STEELYARD, manu-
facturer, and by JAMEs Poacher, squatter.
The House gave MR. CowPER £20,000 to buy the site
behind the National Gallery.
Tuesday.—Nothing remarkable in the House of Lords,
except that in accordance with a new rule, a Two-Minute
Sand-Glass was used before divisions. “The glass,” says
the Star, “became an object of hilarious curiosity to noble
lords.” Gracious—did they never boil their own eggs
at College? -
And, we rejoice to add, the Union Chargeability Bill
was read a Third Time and passed. Mr. Punch bows affably
to his Peers.
The Fire-Brigade Bill went through the Commons Com-
mittee. We presume, the title of the officers will be Fire:
brigadiers. This will look well on visiting-cards, and sound
well when passed by Chawles to JEAMEs.
ARCHBishop MANNING's exertions for the Catholic
Church have begun. One of their fruits was exhibited in a
motion which was made by THEo Donoghue to-day, to the
effect that the Irish Catholics are aggrieved by the present
system of University Education in Ireland. They decline
to attend Colleges in, which the Catholic religion is not
exclusively taught, but they want degrees and University
distinction, generally. ... The ºr. which they pay to
Protestantism by exhibiting such terror lest young Catho-
lics should hear two sides of the question, is so high that
it is impossible to refuse reasonable concession. We shall
not found a Catholic College for them, but we shall affiliate
their own College to the Queen's Üniversity in Ireland.
Every form of high education is virtually anti-Papal.
MR. FREDERick PEEL declines to give MR. DARBy
GRIFFITH information as to the disposal of the Secret
Service money.
Wednesday. A short sitting, but several Bills were put to
death, and the Indemnity Bill was introduced. This is one
of the fatal signs—the Session is given over.
We deeply regret to state that Coventry would not elect
MR. MasóN Jones, and threw stones at him instead.
Thursday. The Lords rushed through worlds of business
between 5 P.M. and 6. Dozens of laws were shoved ahead.
Our young and middle-aged and bald-headed and senile
friends in the Government Offices are very desirous to have
their half-holiday on Saturday afternoons. They certainly
ought to have it, if they wish it. For our own part, we
should have thought that it was aristocratic, and dignified,
and all that, to ignore the plebeian holiday; and while shop-
men and the like were shutting up early, and perspiring
and cutting away, it would be rather the thing to work
serenely to the end of the day, unmoved by the excitement
among one's inferiors. But if our superb friends desire a
half-holiday—pooh! termination of public business—we
agree with LoRD PALMeRSTON that the subject is very de-
serving of consideration, and we are glad to see that he
thinks they may be relieved in batches—we beg pardon,
y arrangement for alternate exchange of duties.
The Clerical Subscription Bill was read a Second Time.
The Clergy, as we have explained, have scruples about the
plenary inspiration of the Prayer Book, though they gene-
rally approve it... So four Archbishops, several Bishops,
and other authorities have concocted a declaration, which
is to make all persons easy. The Clergy are to signify
their “Assent” to the XXIX. Articles and to the Prayer
Book. , And it is distinctly understood that Assent is a
i. phrase, as you might assent to the Fº that
oNEs’s dinner was “a good one,” though you privately
held that the pickled salmon was coarse, that the so-called
claret was win ordinaire, and that the way he said Grace
Was º: The House received the Bill
favourably, MR.HADFIELD was divertingly rampant against
the Catechism, the Burial Service, and everything else that
was churchy, Šin Rounopil. PALMER, a devotional autho-
rity, explained that the Bill was meant to relieve scrupulous
consciences, not to encourage disloyal priests, and, for a
theological measure it was wonderful how smoothly the
Bill glided along. A dissolution must indeed be near when
Members cannot rouse into fury over religious themes.
The Second Warning, the Appropriation Bill, was given.
The huge two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to
smite once and smite no more. The proceedings on
Friday were a mixture of dullnesses and formalities.

“An application having been made in the Court of Bankruptcy, the other day, for
the release from prison of the Hon. Rieh ARD BETHELL, eldest son of Load WEST-
Bury, on the ground that he had been adjudicated bankrupt, CoMMIssionER Goulburn
said he had taken the case, though it belonged in due course to MR. WiNslow;
because the Official Assignee in MR. WiNslow's Court was a relative of the applicant's,
which would make it painful in the extreme to take the matter there." (See Pro-
ceedings in Bankruptcy, Thursday, June 22.)
All very well, MR. Goulburn, but if the Hon. Richand BETHELL's
case is to be excluded from all Bankruptcy Courts in which a BETHELL,
and friends of BETHELL, hold office, where on earth is it to be heard?

AN actress, graceful, winning, young, and fair,
Furnished alike to please men's eyes and hearts;
Yet thinking, if aright we read her air,
Not so much of herself as of her parts.
Who, under her stage-mask gives proof of brain,
Whether she aim at moving smiles or tears; .
Who shows no trick of mouthing, strut, and strain,
And yet has trod the boards from earliest years!
Who in her archness is not coarse or brazen,
And, in her sentiment not prone to snivel;
Own this a stage Miss-TERRY, most amazing,
To whom Punch may be proud to do the civil.
And when she takes her benefit next Friday,
Reader, let that be yours as 'twill be my day!
LIFE AND CHARACTER ON THE RAIL.
The official Report of the Government Inspector, of
Railways in reference to railway travelling, contains the
following monitory statement:-
“Gentlemen passengers, as well as railway officers of all classes,
constantly refuse to travel singly with a stranger of the weaker sex,
under the belief that it is only common prudence in this manner
to Nº. risk of being accused, for purposes of extortion, of insult
or assault."
Thus the moral and physical risk of railway travellin
are about upon a par. The chances of broken bones an
blasted character are even. For the former of those chances
we may thank the parsimony of Directors in sparing
proper precautions; ſ: the latter, the folly and injustice
of magistrates and jurymen, who allow evidence to be
established in the mouth of one only witness, and that
witness the accuser.

PAGE WOOD ON THE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
In delivering his wonderful decision on the right of Kingston to pour
its sewage into the River Thames, sage PAGE Wood is reported to have
said:—
“Of course if the evil was of such a magnitude as in the case before this Court of
the River Lea, where sewage equal in amount to the whole volume of water was
being daily poured into the river, and scarlet fever had actually broken out, then
he (the Vice-Chancellor) should have at once interfered."
In the judgment of Vice-CHANCELLOR PAGE Wood, when the steed
is stolen it is quite soon enough to shut the stable-door.
Some Sense of Propriety.
An unfortunate horse carries a so-called woman through an inde-
corous exhibition, to please the London cads and snobs. We are glad
to hear that when the horse receives his feed, the groom apologises to
him nightly, on the part of the Manager, adding, with a wink, “Busi-
ness is business.” The creature is too dejected to reply with a horse-
laugh. It is to be regretted that a noble beast should be put to such a
base use.

OED JAMBorough, who has TREATED Mas. J. To A FortNIGHT IN Town, TAKES HER For A DRIVE In RottkN Row—To THE HoRRoR
MELTING DAYS,
(By a Moist Member.)
HERE the Dog-days are upon us
Ere the Dog-days ought to be :
In our lightest garbs we don us,
Yet we go perspiring free.
Mad dogs are so large a topic,
... Rabies” seems all the rage:
“Philo-canis,” philanthropic,
Hints at troughs dogs' thirst to assuage.
With the glass set fair and firm, Sir,
At a hundred, night and day:
In all senses of the term, Sir,
Members well may run away.
Overhead the blazing sunshine,
Underfoot the scorching flags:
Work or pleasure is all moonshine
To poor creatures stewed to rags.
In Supply the last we’ve voted:
Here’s th’ Appropriation Bill:
Scilly SMITH, the iron-throated,
Spent and sweltering, is still.
DARBY GRIFFITHs' pumping-engine
Stops, by summer drought drained dry:
FERRAND's bluster grows less swingeing,
Hushed is WHALLEY's plaintive cry.
Nature in these hints and omens
Plainly tells us what to do:
It is she dissolves the Commons,
Thou, O PAM, dissolve them too!
OF THE ** UPPER TEN ' "
A FAIR WORD FOR A FARMER.
IF it be true that a man much benefits mankind by making two blades
of grass grow where one only grew before, then it is clear that MR.
MEchi is a human benefactor. He has not merely done this, but, by
admirable farming, he has made two ears of corn grow where one never
before sprouted. MR. MECHI has shown how to manure the land with
brains, and has not spared his own in accomplishing his purpose. B
numberless experiments, by industry undaunted, and patience well
applied, he has proved that the worst land may produce the best of
crops; and every one who either eats bread or drinks beer is the better
for the wheat and barley ;". by MR. Mechi. He has drained,
reclaimed, and cultivated what was unproductive ground; and, by the
food which it has yielded, men have sprung out of his clay, as from that
of old Prometheus. -
In recognition of his services, a movement is on foot to buy his farm
of Tiptree, and present him with its freehold. Farmers who have
profited by watching his experiments, of course will be the first to put
their names down as subscribers; and people who reflect upon the good
that he has done, will not be slow in seconding a motion so well merited.
Mr. Punch has great pleasure in commending this good work; and
whatever Mr. Punch approves, is sure to be successful. May the ears
of MR. Mechi's wheat soon grow on his own ground as long as those
of MR. WHALLEY! May the blades of his barley be as productive to
his pocket as his razor-blades and knife-blades 1 May he live in clover
for many a long year, and ever have the luck to turn to good account
his mangel !
Parliamentary Sensitive Leaf.
The Funny figure which this leaf presents is º: a great sensa:
tion. If you take it roughly in hand, or haul it over the coals, it will
instantly curl up and show you a decent pair of heels. - -
You may call it a delicate plant if you please, but if you mistake it
for a delegate, it will fly off at a tangent or throw a somersault out of
the house before you can say—BERNAL OSBORNE.
