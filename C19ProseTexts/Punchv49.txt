OBY rushed into the Presence, much disconcerted, and growling.
“Well, my faithful, what is it? Anybody want to eat you?”
The intelligent creature nodded, intimating that his master had just hit it.
“Giant waiting, Sir,” said the Groom of the Cigars, entering.
“I have seen such a lot of them,” said PUNCH, discontentedly. “There was GoLIATH of Gath, MAXIMIN
the Emperor, GABARA of Arabia, John MIDDLEToN of Hale, PATRICK CorTER the Irish giant, BIG SAM of Carlton
Palace, and a dozen more of overgrown humanities. I don't much care about him. Give him a handful of
sovereigns and send him off.”
“But he—— ”
“Answering me and providing yourself, ALPHONSo, is one and the same thing, as my friend MRs. WARDEN
observes. However, I see that you are under gigantic influence. Speak again.”
“He—which his name is CHANG—is humbly eager to see you, Sir.”
“That wish shows more brains than his kind usually own. Gratify his humble eagerness. Fear nothing,
Toby. Under our Eye, his Chinese appetite shall be curbed.”
CHANG stood in The Presence. Toby evinced continued ill-feeling.
“Now, Big ’un, what's up P” asked MR. PUNCH. Observe that with his usual independence he selected
the smallest words for the largest auditor. Had the latter been a dwarf, MR. PUNCH would probably have requested
an intimation of the circumstances which had induced the requisition of that interview.
“Cousin of the stars,” said CHANg; “your intolerably unworthy servant tenders you his worthless acknow-
ledgments of the priceless boon of admission to your unparalleled presence. He reverentially thanks you for the
extraordinary countenance you have been pleased to show him.”
“I don't know that my countenance is so extraordinary, GIGAs. Fascinating, intellectual, impressive, perhaps.”
“Your slave's abominable vocabulary is atrociously inadequate to the occasion,” said CHANG; “but he
intended to refer to the patronage which your Eminence has been pleased to extend to him and to his brother ANAk.”
“I always foster rising genius,” said M.R. PUNCH ; “even when it rises to the height of eight feet, or
whatever you call yourself. I have immortalised you in my pages. Well, what next P”

“The unpardonable ambition of your slave astounds himself—”
“Nothing astounds me—go it.”
“His abased and obnoxious soul lives in one hope only, if he might venture to utter it.”
“ Utter away, then, can't you, GIGAs P Don't waste time. December days are not as long as you.”
“Your graciousness transports your slave into a region of bliss and flowers. Might he, then, dare to beg
that, all unworthy as he is, he may be enrolled among the Sacred Band of Notables—the Band of your Contributors?”
Toby signified his decided objection to the proposed addition to the Staff.
“By Koong-Foo-TSE, whom the Jesuits called Confucius—you believe in Confucius, I trust, by the way ?”
said MR. Punch, “I hope, my dear CHANG, that you are not a proselyte of FAN-SHIN, the unbeliever, 449 A.D.”
“Never heard of him,” said CHANG.
“Nor did I,” said MR. PUNCH, aside, “until I looked into the “Dictionary of Dates.' I am glad to hear
it, CHANG. I could not have entertained overtures from an atheistic giant. It is only the dwarfs whom I
permit to be profane. I was going to say, CHANG, that you have asked a big thing.”
“Your slave is a big thing.”
“He is. But do you know what qualities are required in a Contributor to “PUNCH P’”
“All the virtues, all the graces, all the arts, and all the sciences.”
“Yes, that is all very well for a beginning,” said MR. PUNCH, smiling indulgently. “But there must be
much more. He must have an Ample Fortune, that he may be removed from all sordid influences, an Impressionable
Heart, that he may be enabled to touch the heart of woman, Inspiration of the highest order, that he may write
Poetry, and a Profound Conviction that he is the only person in the world who understands anything about
anything whatsoever. Do you possess all this, CHANG, my son P”
“Your unapproachable Eminence has taught me a golden lesson,” said the giant, bending humbly over
the Great Teacher. “You have taught me how great you are, and how small I am.”
“Then,” said M.R. PUNCH, gently, “I have placed you on the first step of the ladder which you would
ascend. Go-and study. It may be that when we next meet I may grant your prayer. In the meantime, make
this book your Ly-King—your manual of all the relations of life.
So saying, MB. PUNCH gratified the Giant with his
furth-Alimt, Jalumt.

POLITICAL
THE prosperity of the country was not to be without alloy.
The Rinderpest—necessarily, but briefly alluded to in the
pages of Punch—broke out in England and Wales, with what
terrible results we now know, whilst in Ireland a plague even
more destructive of prosperity and comfort developed itself in
the Fenian conspiracy.
The most stringent measures were, after a time, adopted to
stay the progress of the Rinderpest, but with small success.
By the middle of October over 14,000 head of cattle had been
either killed or had died, from the disease; in November the
number increased to over 21,000, and during the last three
weeks of the year the Commissioners reported that more than
55,000 head of cattle had perished.
Ireland had been exempt from the cattle plague, but
Fenianism was in the midst of that generous, excitable, and
easily misguided people. This important outbreak deserves
to be recorded at some length, and we therefore avail ourselves
of the following extracts from the Annual IRegister of 1865:—
“The conspiracy which was this year brought to light, but was happily
checked before it arrived at any outbreak, was larger in extent, more daring
in its objects, and, in some respects more formidable in its nature than any
similar movement of late years. Of the name by which it was distinguished,
various explanations have been given, but the most probable is, that it was
derived from Fion N, a celebrated chieftain, who lived before the conversion
of Ireland to Christianity, and who is the same as the hero of MACPHERSoN,
FINGAL. By the modern Irish this individual is styled FINN Mac Cool.
The Fenians were the men or people of Finn. They formed in the period
above-mentioned a sort of standing militia or warlike caste, whose office it
was to protect the country from aggression, and support the power of the
kings, in return for which service they received a certain allotment of land
and other privileges. The leaders of the present movement, no doubt, saw
an advantage in connecting their party with the historical and traditionary
glories of Ireland. But whatever may have been the origin of the name, the
thing itself was simply a scheme of rebellion against the English Govern-
ment, organised in the United States, having its centre of rule and adminis-
SUMMARY.
tration there, and intended to combine the numerous Irish settlers in that
country, men for the most part bitterly hostile to English rule, with the
disaffected in various parts in Ireland, in a great effort to throw off by force
the yoke of the British Crown, and to take the whole power and property of
the island into their own hands. The evidence given on the trials of some of
the conspirators by the Special Commission, will clearly show what the aims
and designs of the insurrection were, and what were the means intended to
be used to effect this purpose. It appeared that the Fenian Society had its
chie's, its officers, both civil and military, its common funds and financial
agencies, its secret oaths, passwords, and emblems, its laws and penalties,
its stores of concealed arms and weapons, its nightly drills and training of
men, its correspondents and agents in various quarters, its accredited jour-
nals, and even its popular songs and ballads, all designed to extend its
influence, and to gain adherents from various quarters, not excepting the
soldiers in the British army, and the warders in the gaols. It is true,
indeed, that by their vain parade, their boastful language, and the unseemly
squabbles among their rival factions, the Fenian leaders in America exposed
their association to no little ridicule and contempt; it is true, also, that a
more insane attempt than that of overthrowing the British authority by
such means as, according to their most sanguine calculations, the associated
forces on both sides of the Atlantic could command, was never engendered
in distempered brains. But it is no less true that the existence of such a
plot, so wide-spread, so fanatical, so desperate, indicated that the long-
standing disease which had for centuries sapped the vitals of Irish pros-
perity and advancement, was still as active as ever in that morbid branch of
the body politic, and that those sanguine dreams which English statesmen
had indulged, that conciliation and cquity, and an impartial policy were
gradually welding the sister kingdoms into a compact and harmonious
whole, were but flattering illusions. But the wounds of centuries cannot be
healed in a few years: and traditional repugnance and antipathy long survive
in the breasts of nations the causes which originally produced them. There
was, indeed, one feature in this last form of disaffection which distinguished
it in a marked manner from preceding combinations. Most of the plots and
fraternities which have for some time back menaced the peace of Ireland
have had more or less of a theological character. They have been animated
by a fierce hostility to the Protestant Church and its partisans, while they have
professed submission and respect to the Roman Catholic faith and priesthood.
But the Fenian movement made no such profession. It did not seek any
countenance from the spiritual authorities of the popular creed, nor any aid
from religious zeal or fanaticism. On the contray, its members openly
proclaimed their enmity to the Romish hierarchy and priesthood, including
them as well as all holders of political power, and all owners of prºperty, of
whatever creed, in their denunciations, as the enemies of the nation, who
were to be swept away and destroyed. In their turn the insurgents were

solemnly reprobated by the Catholic bishops, both in Ireland and America,
and denounced from the altar in the strongest language by the parochial
priests, as the worst foes alike to religion and society. The views and inten-
tions avowed by the chiefs of the movement fully justified such imputations.
These men had “drunk deeply,” as the Attorney-GENERAL For IRELAND said
on the trial of one of them, ‘of the spirit of the French Revolution ; and were
prepared to imbrue their bands in blood for the attainment of their ends.”
It appears clear from the documents put in evidence before the Special Com-
mission at Cork and Dublin, that the massacre of the upper classes, of the
owners of land and property, and of all who held power in Church and
State, together with a confiscation of estates, were the steps by which they
intended to carry out, in the event of a successful invasion and a defeat of
the British Government, their deliberate scheme for the establishment of an
Irish republic. In the words of MR. Justice Keogh, describing the cha-
racter of the insurrection, which were fully substantiated by the evidence
adduced before the Court, ‘the object of its leaders was to extend it through
all classes of the people, but especially the artisans in towns and the culti-
vators of the soil; its ramifications existed not only in this country, but in
the States of America; supplies of money and of arms for the purposes of a
general insurrection were being collected, not only here, but on the other
side of the Atlantic ; and, finally, the object of this confederation was the
overthrow of the QUEEN's authority, the separation of this country from Great
Britain, the destruction of our present Constitution, the establishment of
some democratic or military despotism, and the general division of every
description of property as the result of a successful civil war.”
Our space forbids us to follow this subject to its close,
indeed, it has occupied its place in the history of Ireland
during the two last years, and will have to receive further
notice in our succeeding volumes. -
As the outbreak in Jamaica will occupy a remarkable plac
in history, not only on its own account but also from the ex-
traordinary proceedings to which it led, we shall again avail
ourselves of the pages of the Annual Register :- -
“In the month of October this year, an outbreak of the negroes took
place in Jamaica, which was followed by deplorable consequences. For
some time previously there had been a good deal of discontent amongst the
black population, which had been fostered by the harangues of agitators
and the addresses of Baptist ministers, who attributed the distress from
which the island suffered to the misgovernment of its rulers. That there
were grievances which required redress, we are not disposed to deny; but
the poverty which had overtaken a great part of the community was chiefly
caused by the indolent and thoughtless character of the negro, who abhors
labour and thinks idleness the most precious boon of liberty.
“The disturbance began on the 7th of October, at Morant Bay, in the
district of St. Thomas-in-the-East, about twenty miles east from Kingston,
and we will give an account of its commencement in the words of BARON
voN KETELHodt, the Custos of the district, who himself fell a victim to the
murderous violence of the blacks. He says, in a dispatch addressed to the
ecretary of the Governor :—
“‘A number of over 150 men, armed with sticks, and preceded by a band
of music came on Saturday, the 7th October, with the openly expressed in-
ention to rescue a man who was that day to be tried for some offence, if
found guilty. Leaving the band of music outside the town, they proceeded
to the square in front of the Court-house. A man having been ordered into
custody on account of the noise he was making in the Court-house, a rush
was made by a body of the men referred to, and the man rescued from the
hands of the police, one of whom was left with his finger broken, and several
others beaten and ill-treated.
“‘In consequence of this outrage, warrants were issued yesterday against
twenty-eight individuals who had been identified, and the warrants placed
to-day in the hands of six policemen and three rural constables for execution.
“‘On, however, the attempt being made by this force to arrest one PAUL
Bogle, I am informed by the policemen, who have just returned, that on a
signal being given, a body of over 150 men, armed with cutlasses, bayonets,
and pikes, appeared, and made prisoners of three of the policemen, on two
of whom they placed handcuffs, and only suffered them to leave after having
obtained an oath from them that they (the police) would join them.
“‘The oath was administered by PAUL Bogle on a Bible he had at hand.”
“The next day, to quote the language of the Clerk of the Peace of St.
Thomas-in-the-East, “there was a meeting of the vestry at Morant Bay, at
which his Honour the Custos and several magistrates were present. About
three o'clock in the evening, and while the vestry was still sitting, a band
of music was heard, and shorty after from about 400 to 500 men appeared,
armed with sticks, cutlasses, spears, guns, and other deadly weapons. The
Custos then appeared on the steps of the Court-house, and entreated the
people not to come into the square of the Court-house, and requested to
know of what they complained. At this time the volunteers, eighteen in
number, were drawn up in front of the Court-house; the mob still persisted
in entering the square, and when about fifty yards from the volunteers the
Riot Act was read by the Custos, but which had no effect on the rioters.
On the rioters coming within ten yards of the volunteers they fired a volley
of stones at them ; the order was then given to fire, and several of the rioters
were killed. The fury of the rioters was such that every one had to take refuge
inside the Court-house ; several shots were fired into the Court-house, the
windows were all smashed to picces, and ultimately fired and burnt down:
his Honour the Custos was murdered in the most brutal and savage manner,
with other magistrates and gentlemen of the parish.’
“Almost the whole of the small band of volunteers was cut to pieces,
after making a gallant and determined resistance to the attack. After their
victory at the Coturt-house, the negroes dispersed in various directions and
committed acts of violence and murder elsewhere, entering plantations,
from which the proprietors had to fly for their lives, and causing the utmost
terror to the whole white population, which is outnumbered by the black in
an immense proportion. Amongst other documents, the following was
found, which shows that the outbreak was premeditated, and shows also its
character and objects :—
“‘MR. GRAHAM and other gentleman, it is time now for us to help our-
selves. Skin for skin, the iron bars is now broken in this parish, the white
people send a proclamation to the Governor to make war against us, which
we all must put our shoulder to the wheels and pull together. The Maroons
sent the proclamation to us to meet them at Hayfield at once without delay,
that they will put us in a way how to act. Every one of you must leave
your house, takes your guns, who don't have guns take your cutlasses down
at once. Come over to “Stony Gut” that we might march over to meet the
Maroons at once with rut delay. Blow your shells, roal your drums, house
to house take out every man march them down to Stoney Gut, any that
you find in the way takes them down with there arms; war is at us, my
black skin war is at hand from to-day to to-morrow. Every black man
must turn at rice for the oppression is too great, the white people are now
cleaning up they guns for us, which we must prepare to meet them too.
Chear men, chear, in heart we looking for you a part of the night or before
daybreak.
“‘We are, &c.,
(Signed) “‘Paul Bogle,
“‘J. G. McLARREN,
“‘B. CLARKE,
“‘P. CAMERON.”
“Nothing could exceed the brutality with which the infuriated negroes
perpetrated their atrocities. At the Court-house the eyes and hearts of some
of their victims were torn out, and the women showed themselves even more
cruel than the men."
The means employed by GovePNOR EYRE to put an imme-
diate and effectual stop to these atrocities gave rise to pro-
ceedings against him, which Mr. Punch, having regard to
the exigences of the occasion, has stigmatised as the persecu-
tion of a brave man, daring to do his duty to his countrymen
and countrywomen at a time when to have hesitated, would
have been to have invited butchery and something worse.
The state of the money-market at the close of the year was
productive of much mischief, especially in the fluctuating
prices of cotton, and the balance of trade was undoubtedly
against us. The principle of “Limited Liability” came
largely into favour—no less than 287 new companies came
into existence, and many old private firms of the highest
respectability also accepted the new form of partnership.
On the 9th of December died LEopold THE FIRST, King of
the Belgians, after a life of much usefulness. He was a lover
of peace, and industry, and a peace-maker.

A WORD WITH FINSBURY.
Qu. There is ALDERMAN
MR. PHILLIPs. There is
ELECTORs, -
You have several Candidates before
Lusk. There is MR. ToRRENs. There is
MR. Cox.
Mr. Punch recommends you to vote for Cox. -
MR. Cox has brought an action against Mr. Punch. MR, Cox, alleging
that some of Mr. Punch's remarks upon him are injurious, demands
£50 as the price of such injury. Mr. Punch means to fight him for it.
You need hardly be told that there is no foundation for MR. Cox's
action. Mr. Punch's words are ever and always those of legitimate
criticism, a function he exercises, in the interest of the nation. That
they might damage MR. Cox's election prospects was possible, but we
Prº to remove the possibility. -
r. Punch has no personal feeling against MR. Cox, and indeed
never saw him. MR. Cox is an Attorney, but Mr. Punch is not aware
that MR. Cox ever served a writ, at the suit of MR. FLIGHT, or any-
body else, upon any friend of Mr. Punch. The castigation which Mr.
Punch has inistered to MR. Cox has been on public grounds only.
Mr. Panch considers that, as a fº rule, an Attorney is not an
eligible Candidate. If he have had a large practice, its pursuit must
have disqualified him for the studies which befit a statesman, and if he
be a small Attorney—is it necessary to finish the sentence?
But, there are exceptional cases in , which able and large-minded
men. discard professional shackles, and become valuable Members of
Parliament.
Is MR. Cox one of the exceptions? Is not the House of Commons
usually in a laughing mood when he is oratorical? Has he ever shown
anything like a statesman's mind? Does he not deal in exaggeration
and absurdity? There is no personality here—a general election
demands that the claims of every Candidate shall be fairly weighed.
Did not MR. Cox mightily assist the Tories in their persecution of
MR. STANSFELD, whereby an able man was turned out of the Ministry?
MR. Cox may have believed that he was right in thus aiding the Tories,
but does Finsbury think so?
You have elected, in other days, the noble SIR Robert GRANT, MR.
THQMAS DUNCOMBE, who was an ornament to the Commons, and who
made Finsbury respected, and MR. WAKLEY, who, with divers short-
2. was a man of mark. Now, Finsbury is known by Cox, the
orney.
Mr. Punch respectfully requests you to elect, MR. Cox. The latter,
though he knew his action to be bosh, hoped to silence Mr. Punch
during the election, considering that Mr. Punch would be deterred from
speaking while an action pended. This fear of Mr. Punch showed good
sense. The idea of silencing Mr. Punch was a good Attorney’s-idea,
but Mr. Punch has a soul above Attorneys. He is not silenced. On the
contrary, he proclaims his ideas in regard to MR. Cox, and begs the
electors not to deprive him, Mr. Punch, of a favourite type of what a
º of Parliament, for a great and important constituency, ought
7:00 to De.
MR. Lusk is a rich, upright, sensible gentleman. MR. ToRRENs is a
statesman. MR. PHILLIPs is a very respectable candidate. But
Electors, please to consider how useful MR. Cox is to Mr. Punch, and
do me the favour to re-elect Cox the Attorney.
Yours respectfully,

ARISTOCRATIC INTIMIDATION.
(Communicated.)
WE had hoped that Manchester was tolerably free from aristocratic
dictation, but the curse of the cold shade is upon us, and the Upas-tree
is ineradicable. We had intended to elect a worthy citizen, one who is
respected by all, and who has done good service to, and suffered for the
cause of Liberalism. But MR. A. Heywood is suppressed ". lordly
dictation. LoRD BRIGHT has ordered Manchester to elect his brother,
the Hon. MR. Jacob, and the fiat having gone forth, the Liberal
organs apprise MR, Heywood that the sooner he gets out of the way
the better. It is haughtily added, that Manchester “owes somethin
to the name of Bright.”, This means that his Lordship, in '57, an
before his elevation to the Peerage, was rejected at Manchester, for
opposing a popular Premier. We know nothing of the H9N. M.R.
JAcOB, but he JAcoB's ladder to political eminence, and, of course,
will climb it. May the day come when the haughty tyranny of the
Aristocracy shall be at an end

WHO SHALL CRITICISE THE CRITICSP
With glorious old HANDel still ringing in his ears, Mr. Punch is
nothing just at present if not musical. Being in this humour, Mr. Punch
would crave an inch or two of his own valuable space, to bring before
the notice of the musical world a charge made against a journal which,
not to be too personal, he will call the British Ensign. This newspaper
is accused .P having suddenly turned round from praising Covent
Garden Opera to unmerited fault-finding in it; and the reason of the
censure is hinted by the Preston Herald to be this:--
“Immediately before the critic had discovered that Opera at Covent Garden was
“cut” and ‘curtailed," and that PATTI was “a dove trooping among the crows,' the
advertisements of the theatre had been withdrawn from the columns of the British Ensign.”
Qf course this accusation is utterly unfounded; and what is thought
to be a reason must be merely a coincidence. Of course no critic would
allow his judgment to be warped in the manner here suggested; and of
course the British Ensign has published an indignant contradiction of
the charge. But taking this for granted, and considering the ºf:
dismissed, Mr. Punch must make another short quotation from the
Preston Herald, if only for the sake of adding his approval of it:—
“If notices favourable to artists or managers or houses can be purchased directly
or indirectly, by a fee or an advertisement or a privilege, –there is an end to public
confidence, and an end to the critic's occupation also. We do hope, however, in the
face of much discouragement, that the day will come when art criticism, and lite-
rary criticism also may be believed in ;—that will be when professional men are not
hired to hold at their mercy the reputation of their professional brethren, that will
be when journalists separate the literary from the commercial departments of a
newspaper, and refuse to call black white because it may or may not be advertised."
Clearly what is now called criticism must cease to be so called, if it
be biassed by advertisements; among which, in that case, it would
most fittingly be printed. In that case, too, the critic clearly ought to
draw his from those of whom he writes; and this fact should be
The Brick-Bat.
made known in every notice which he pens, in order that the public be
not wrongfully allured by the praise which he puts forth. There would
at least be honesty in such a course as this, and doubtless in the long
run it would prove a better policy than the plan of using criticism
simply as a .# If the stuff which critics write is thought at all to
. the circulation of a newspaper, care surely should be taken to
make the critic's column attractive to the public; and this can surely
not be done by letting critics write advertisements, which, as a general
rule, the public never cares to read.
MILL AND PUBLIC MEASURES.
OUR cauponious contemporary, the Morning Advertiser, has been
objecting very much to MR. MILL as a Candidate for the representation
of Westminster. The alleged ground of its objection is the rationalism
which it fancies it smells in some of MR. MILL's .
The other evening, however, at a meeting of teetotallers favourable
to the “Permissive Bill,” held, under the presidency of MR. JoB
CAUDwell, at the Mission Hall, Soho, we find that:—
“There was a strong expression of approval of the course taken by MR. John
Stuart MILL in not having public-houses for committee rooms.”
“Gin and true religion” may be points on both of which the Morn-
ing Advertiser considers the views of MR. MILL equally unsound; but
probably the animosity of that public-spirited journal has been, excited
.# more particularly by the line which he has taken with regard
to gin.
QUERY.—Is there any such book as “Half-hours with the worst
Authors?” I should think such a work would be a fortune to any
enterprising publisher.

WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE SERVANT-GALS P
Charming Lady (showing her House to Benevolent Old Gentleman).
Benevolent Old Gentleman. “DEAR ME, You Don't sAY so |
Charming Lady. “Oh, It's Not Too DAMP FoR A SERVANT | "
ISN'T IT very DAMP
“THAT's where the HouseMAID sleeps.”
I see THE WATER GLISTENING on TBE WALLs.”
A DOUBT ABOUT BRIGANDAGE.
To Mr. Punch.
SIR,
THERE is a certain personage whom the proverb, declares to
be not so black as he is painted. This personage is called in a vulgar
euphemism, “The Old Gentleman; ” or, more particularly, “The Old
Gentleman Down Below.”
Is it not possible, Mr. Punch, that the saying about the blackness of
the old gentleman down below is equally applicable to another old gen-
tleman out yonder? I mean his Holiness the Pops, and I can't help
suspecting that we have lent too credulous an eye to the dark com-
lexion with which some | ". and those of the Italian school too,
ave represented the Holy Father; so called very ironically if their
portraits of him resemble him at all.
The Liberal Italian Press accuses the Papal Government of virtual
complicity with º: perpetrated in the interest of the Pope and
the Ex-KING OF NAPLEs. In the Italia of June 21st, there is an
account of the atrocities committed by brigands in the province of
Chieti, whence allow me to present you with a few extracts. For
example:–
“A poor peasant, captured by these ruffians in the plain of Piapano, had his
tongue wrenched out by pincers, and his eyes torn from their sockets, being finally
dispatched by stiletto thrusts.”
This deed, if the alleged relation between the brigands and the Holy
; really exists, may be styled an act of faith. So may that related as
OLIOWS :-
“The band commanded by a certain Luzio DE ATEs A, has spread terror through-
out our district. This chief has 24 or 25 men, or rather ferocious brutes. Last
Saturday they made a descent upon a farm owned by one GiovaNNI, whom they
bound tightly with cords, and after covering him with bayonet wounds (more than
eighty, were counted on the body), brutally shot the unhappy man, together with
his wife and mother."
The % difference between these alleged acts of º and a regular
auto-da-fé, or act of faith, is as that wherein the legal execution of
justice differs from Lynch law. I will trouble you with only one more
case in point:—
“The band of LUzio Di CAGNorto Di Casoli is now united with that of Sciapio,
and numbers 40 men, who ravage the country with impunity, without any energetic
measures being taken by the authorities to put a stop to their atrocities. On the
12th instant these united bands made au attack upon the country house of Zio
GAETANO, and captured LUIG1 ScARINGI. After binding their victim, they first cut
off his chin; a paper was then placed on his forehead, and nailed to his temples,
bearing the inscription, ‘CANNoNE DI CAsoli has done this.’ The sufferer was
finally besmeared with J. to which his inhuman tormentors set light, leaving
him half consumed by the flames.”
In the course of your studies, Sir, you may have at times alighted on
some of those comic songs of our ancestors, of which the subject was
the death or mutilation of a human being, the details whereof were
wont to be sung to a lively tune, usually with a chorus of folderol de
rido. Now, what I want to know is, whether the particulars above
quoted have, any other foundation in fact than such as may have sup-
ported the lyrical autobiography of the British sailor, whose ditt
relates how, in the service of his country, he had lost first one limb an
then another, until at last a chain-shot, or some such missile, came—
“And, bless me, knocked my nose off.”
-the dismembered songster concluding with the consolatory reflection
that it will take “them.” (the French) a blest long time—
“Bless me, to spoil my singing.”
For if the brigands are not in the habit of committing the rampant
atrocities of which they are accused, the word of their accusers, for any
connection between them and the old gentleman of the Vatican, or even
the young gentleman who lately occupied the throne of Naples, is all
the undersigned. On the other hand, if they are really guilty of any-
thing like the outrages imputed to them, and the Papal Government
abets them in any degree, how is it that all the civilised powers of
Europe do not combine to sweep the Papacy of the face of the earth?
If there are any serious grounds for asking this question, pass it on
to the EMPEROR OF THE §. but surely his Imperial Majesty
must believe the stories about the encouragement of brigandage by the
Court of Rome to be all WALKER.

MUSIC OF THE FUTURE.
Domestic subjects for English Opera are seldom, if ever, to be met
with. Of course, there will come a time when a generation yet unborn
and unthought of will be listening with rapt delight to some romantic
legend about a gallant young Railway Director, and will encore a chorus
f Policemen, Stokers, and, so forth, as we now-a-days applaud an
ensemble of Huguenots, Soldiers, Mediaeval Watchmen, or Puritan
Boatmen. The Music of the Future will take its inspiration from the
libretto of the Present, and, in order to forestall the librettists of three
centuries
hence, we select a scene and a striking, though not entirely
unfamiliar, situation from a great work which we are pleased to call
THE CABMAN'S OPERA, ,
ACT I.-SCENE LAST.
PLACE: A London Terminus. TIME : Not much before the Train starts,
[Argument briefly stated. ... The story is founded upon a gustom, that
obtains on some Railways, of shutting the outer doors of the
Station, and not allowing anyone to enter until after the train, then
starting, has quitted the interior.] -
Scene—The Stage (this direction is for MR. HARRIs, of Covent Garden)
is divided obliquely. One side, L.H., representing the interior of the
Railway Station, and the other side, R.H., representing the exterior of the
Railway Station. Guards, Collectors, Passengers, Porters discovered,
L. h., within. Cabmen on their cabs, Omnibusses, Porters, a Railway
Policeman, and an Elderly Gentleman earamining a Time-table, R.H.,
without. As the Scene opens, a four-wheeled Cab, with Luggage,
drives up; the Driver gets down from his bor; Porters eye the Pas-
senger listlessly.
Passenger (to Cabman—recitative). Just get down this (pointing to
bor)—and this—and that besides. (Chord).
An Inspector (a character like the Huguenot Soldier who sings the solos
in the Rataplan chorus—aside—recitative). I hear a chord and (laughi
to himself) I see a cord, upon the box. [Erit, pleased.
Passenger (looking at his watch). Dear me—it is—(seeing that the
Cabman, is not unlading quickly)—where are the Porters? (Calls.)

RMAGH.—To any local poet, wishing to celebrate
the contest for this borough in verse, we offer a
quotation, one but little known:-
“Armavirumque cano.”
ARUNDEL.—“The Arundel Society,” small and select, will return a
HowARD as usual.
AYR BURGHs.—It is not yet settled whether MR. Coxwell, or MR.
GLAishER will retire. It is left to the Astronomer Royal to decide
which of the two shall go up.
BANBURY.-The current belief is, that SIR. C. Douglas, whose name
suggests the land of cakes, will be re-elected.
BRISTOL.—SIR MoRTON seeks to be the pet o' the people.
CANTERBURY.--Hopes to send a Member who will have the Lyon's
share in the new Parliament.
CARMARTHENSHIRE.-MR. DAVID JONEs and MR. DAVID Pugh are
the sitting Members. The former may consider himself safe so ºff.
he has no acquaintance with the locker associated with his name. The
latter pooh-poohs the notion of an opposition.
CARNARvos, &c.—“It is very generally believed that MR. BULKELEY
Hughes's retºrn is beyond doubt.” We hope so, and that it will be
long before he is used up.
CQRK.—MR. GEORGE. B. BARRY has offered himself for the county.
His baritone voice will be of use to him on the hustings.
EYE.-MR. Hook, R.A., is said to have this borough in view.
HERTFORDshire.—The Liberals say, Success to CowPER's Task /
LEEDs:-The Conservative BEECROFT is taken as an antidote to the
Liberal BAINEs. -
LYME REGIS-We are requested to state that MR. HAwkshaw,
who is a Candidate for this borough, is not the MR. Hawkshaw, late of
the Royal Olympic Theatre.
. MALTON.--When it was rumoured that MR. FITzwu.LIAM was goin
into Yorkshire on a Riding expedition, both MR. John Scott an
MR. W. l’ANson were spoken of as likely to come to the post in the
Derby interest. The scot and lot voters declared themselves in favour
of the first-named gentleman, and were already known as Scott's lot.
NoRTHAMPTON.—CHARLEs GILPIN is a citizen
Of credit and renown,
And M.P. hopes to be again
For famed §. town.
NoTTINGHAM.—For an account of the riotous proceedings at this
place, see the Pell-Mell Gazette.
QxpoRD.—The Secretary for the Colonies, who plays a good card
well, is as safe as (the Heads of) Houses. His colleague will have the
pleasure of returning thanks on re-election in a NEATE speech. :
OxForp UNIVERSITY.-Define political Hardihood:—
The Member for Leominster opposing the CHANCELLOR of The
ExchEQUER.
PETERBOROUGH.—“Oh, HZhalley, we have missed you” is now the
popular song in this city. MR. Thomson HAN KEY is not a man to
resort to any hanky-panky tricks to secure his return.
PoNTEFRACT.-MR. CHILDERs can never desert this borough. If he
did, Yorkshiremen would immediately dub him “Flying Childers.”
RUTLANDSHIRE-There is no truth in the report that this County,
the smallest in England, and whose greatest man was the dwarf JEFFERY
HUDson, will be represented by GENERAL ToM THUMB.
SouTH DURHAM.—The PEASE at any price party is strong.
SQUTH WIITs –The Conservatives will support the noble scion of
the house of Bath through thick and thin.
St. Ives.—It is buzzed about that the coming man here is the Times'
Bee-master.
StockpoRT.-The Conservative Candidate being MR, TIPPING, the
Liberal cry is, “No bribery, no Tipping.”
TAUNTON.—“LORD W. M. HAY is the second Liberal Candidate.”
Our advice to him is, to make HAY while the sun shines. We expect
to hear that the HAY fever is very prevalent at Taunton.
WELLs.-This city resembles DR. Johnson. It likes a good HAYTER.
It has also no objection to a Jollification. -
WESTMINSTER.—The address of MR. W. H. SMITH, the well-known
Bookseller, speaks volumes, and all of the old Conservative type. The
Liberal party are doing their utmost to make it a dead letter.
Wick BURGHs.—One of the Directors of PRICE's Patent Candle
Company is expected here as a Candidate.
Woodstock.-MR. MitchELL HENRY is hand in glove with the
electors, but the Blenheim breed is not extinct.
TWELFTH NIGHT AT MIDSUMMER.
It is amusing to see how the critics have been puzzled, when a
manager of one of our smaller theatres for once takes the advice they
are always thrusting on him, and goes, for his plays, to a higher region
than that of the sensation-drama and the burlesque. MR. WIGAN has
been lectured for straying out of his line, and for venturing on a play of
SHAKspeARE's with a company not in the habit of performing the
Shakspearian drama. Mr. Punch, au contraire, says to ‘MR. WIGAN,
“Macle virtute.”-Go on, and prosper. There should be no company
in any respectable London theatre incapable of acting any of the come-
dies, at least, of SHAKSPEARE-even if his tragedies be impossible with-
out a great actor.
Orange Bitters.
MR. BEERs, “the Grand Master of the County of Down,” complains
that the prohibition, under which the Orange-men are forbidden to play
“Croppies, lie down” and “Boyne Water,” to wear orange scarves, and
to drink “To Hell with the Pope l’” are restrictions on Protestant
patriotism' -
Orange bitter-BEERs seems a still more pernicious and astringent
compound. -
“Orange bitters” are only too much used in Ireland. '

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 9
a night or two later, that the country wanted the elections, and was not
§ be kept waiting by the squabbles of railway people over
their Bills.
The EARL of DEvoN moved the Second Reading of the Catholic
Oaths Bill. The EARL of DERBy moved its rejection.
It subverted one of the leading principles of a Great Settlement.
He had many Catholic friends, and was a good landlord to many
Catholic tenants. He had voted for Catholic Relief. -
But this was not a personal, or a social, but a high political question.
Who wanted the Bill? Where were the real noble old Catholic fami-
lies? Where was ARUNDEL, and HowARD, and STOURTON; where was
TALBot, PETRE, and CLIFFORD? [It sounded like a bit of Marnion
to hear a STANLEY trumpeting out this roll call.] They were satisfied.
What sort of folks were the promoters of this Bill attempting to please,
and just before a general election? - - -
He would do away with the declaration against equivocation and
Mental reservation, for a man who had mental reservations would break
an oath. [No doubt, my Lord.]
Government ought to take the lead in so important a matter, and
offer an oath which all classes could take. -
For forty years he had defended the Church, and he was not likely to
abandon her when he was on the confines of the grave. [My Lord,
what nonsense! Confines of the grave? You were born in 1799–
argal, are about sixty-six. We look for twenty years work out of you.]
EARL Russell was very imperfectly heard. We give him notice that,
if he does not speak out in the next Parliament, he shall have a whole
Cartoon to himself, which he will probably not think to his advantage.
He thought the oath no security, and that Protestants and Catholics
were not on an equality in regard to votes on the Church.
The EARL or HARRowby saw no grievance in preventing people from
doing that which it was undesirable for them to do. [Aristocratic
logic. It is undesirable for LORD HARRowBy to get drunk (we do not
suppose that he ever did such a thing in his life), but would he not
think it insulting if, in the spirit of his logic, Mr. Punch proceeded to
39, Grosvenor Square, Sandon House, and Norton, and padlocked all
the wine-cellars }
EARL GREY thought that the Irish Church must soon undergo
Revision, and with the Church would go the Oath. [Outspoken, my
Lord.] Meantime, it might be wise to make concessions where
grievances existed.
Some other Lords spoke, but it was useless, as LoRD DERBy had the
majority in his pocket. The Oaths Bill was rejected by 84 to 63.
Nothing worth note in the Commons, save that for Liskeard, came
in BULLER, vice BERNAL QSBORNE, who bolted, to punish his late con-
stituents by giving them the trouble of a double election.
Tuesday. The Prisons'. Bill went through Committee. Somebody
had objected to Solitary Confinement in the case of short sentences, but
as it is only in such cases that this very severe punishment can properly
be applied, Mr. Punch approves the permission to give a culprit time
to think quietly. If he discovers that he has been a rogue, and that
roguery has brought him into trouble, it is possible that the reflection
may be beneficial. At all events,..": him the º Few men,
of the rogue class, have ever had a chance of a few hours of quiet
thought, without disturbance or excitement, until they were locked up,
We wonder whether Thinking Cells will ever be part of our educational
system.
Gracious! A new Hymn Book has been served out to the Army and
avy, and LORD WESTMEATH objects to it, as containing Popish senti-
ments. We leave such a matter in all confidence in the hands of a
Government that contains SIR. RoundELL PALMER. EARL DE GREY
said that the men did not like the old hymn book. Imagine the
British Grenadier, and his friend, JACK MARLINSPIKE, sitting down
to overhaul DR. WATTs. -
MR. LongFIELD-stop, who is LongFIELD Where is DoDP Irish
Member–Mallow—has published several legal works (we never read
any of them, happy to say), a Liberal Conservative. Not much said
about Longfield. He made a bitter attack upon LoRD WESTBURY,
in reference to the Leeds business, and was indignantly castigated by
LORD PAIMERston, who, however, stated that the subject was under
the consideration of the Crown lawyers.
The Bill for the Abolition of Tests at Oxford was carried through the
Commons, as has been mentioned. In reference to this measure, an
its having passed the Commons, Mr. Punch remarked, in one of those
simple but oracular phrases which contain a mine of wisdom for those
who have ears to hear, “There is a House of Lords above us.” To-day,
the Bill was withdrawn. The Church of England, as by Law Estab:
lished, cannot, therefore, be utterly destroyed by the Dissenters before
the first week in March next.
Wednesday. RABELAIs has mentioned cases in which it is difficult to
extort language, or yocalisation, but even he never figured the hardship
of exciting a laugh from a moribund House of Commons at a Wednes-
day sitting. Yet MR. DARBY GRIFFITH accomplished the feat. He
gave notice that next Session, he would do something or other, “if
everything went right,” and the House laughed. He meant that he
was everything and everybody, but we respectfully inform him, that
even if the electors of Devizes should be silly enough to return him
i. everything will not be right, though Panch, for reasons, will be
pleased not to lose DARBY.
Thursday. Royal Assent given to heaps of Bills, and much business
done in the Lords.
In the Commons, SIR CHARLEs Wood . on the Indian Budget.
He is usually sufficiently confused and inaudible, but to-day, we regret
to say, that he was unwell. The Indian Surplus is much less than was
expected, and the finance measures are in a muddle. So are the
accounts. But the latter are to be kept better, true principles of politi-
cal, economy are re-enacted, and a new Finance Minister is gone to
India. A transition state is clearly not one for criticism, but we were
told, not long ago, that the Indian sky was all serene, and that
Brahma had come down for his tenth Avatar in a shower of gold.
Friday. SIR FRANCIs HEAD, as all parties are now ready enough to
admit, saved Canada. But precedent and red tape were too strong
even to be conquered by such a service as that, and he never received
the reward to which he was entitled. He is now “old and poor;” the
words are LORD HARDwicke's, but he is too proud to accept any pen-
sion save one which shall descend regularly through the Ministers of
the Crown. He lives in retirement at Croydon, a memorial of British
ratitude to a man who saved an empire. A debate on a Pensions Bill
É. out the facts, which are not calculated to make any English-
man proud, except SIR FRANCIs HEAD.
The eternal GRIFFITH asked the ATTORNEy-GENERAL whether he
would not bring in a Bill for “simplifying.” the law of “simony.”
“Who should do that but Simple SIMon, M.P. for Devizes,” thºught
SIR RoundELL, but he only said that he didn't know.
MR. Hunt gave notice of a Wote of Censure on the LORD CHANCELLOR.
Evidently,
“The Hunt is up, the Hunt is up,
And Punch must really say,
That if the Buck don't mean to fight,
It's time he were away.”
Then we had a long and interesting debate on Abyssinia, and KING
THEODoRE. MR. LAYARD gave a full account of that monarch. Amon
other matters, he mentioned that an Englishman who had been usefu
to the King having been slain, he “avenged” him by deliberately
killing 1500 persons, as a special mark of respect for the QUEEN or
ENGLAND. It is clear that our Government think that CAPTAIN
CAMERON has got into trouble through his own love of meddling with
matters já his sphere—also that the Abyssinian Missionaries hate
one another, and, do much mischief by their mutual hostilities and
intrigues. No definite statement was made as to what is being done
in the way of rescue. The matter is not so easy as it seems to some of
us at home, ready to cry out with Dame Quickly, “Here, good
people, bring a rescue or two.”
Dissenters Done by Themselves.
The Nonconformists, with a will,
Would make the House divids
On LygoN's Education Bill:
Upon the losing side,
Against the Church there did a crew,
Of thirty-five combine :
Opposing them, good men and true,
United forty-nine.
NO RIDDLE.
Why was there no Ministerial Whitebait, Dinner this year? . .
Because circumstances, which we hope will be satisfactorily explained,
would have forbidden the floan CHANCELIQR, and his colleagues to
unite in abandoning themselves to unmingled jollity.
Denmark Avenged.
'Tis likely theft and murder will draw down ..
For Denmark's lºº some partial retribution.
The Prussians, if their King lose not his Crown,

WESTBURY WHITEWASHED.
WHY is LoRD WESTBURY's character as clear as daylight?–Because

THE ONLY SEAL OF CONFESSION
ALLOWED IN THIS COUNTRY.
THE BRIDGE.
I Stoop on the bridge at midnight,
As Big Ben was striking the hour,
And the moon rose o'er the Abbey,
Behind the Victoria Tower;
And like the waters rushing
Before the House of Peers,
A flood of thoughts came o'er me,
That filled my soul with fears.
How often, oh, how often,
In the Sessions now gone by,
I had shirked the debates at midnight,
And shunned MR. HUGEssen’s eyeſ!
How often, oh, how often
Íhad wished that the House would divide,
And let me escape from the lºy
To the Row for my usual ride!
For Committees made me restless,
And constituents brought me care;
And the speech expected from me
Was more than I could prepare;
But now it must shortly be spoken,
When the County town I see,
When the County hustings' awning
Throws its shadow over me.
And whenever I think of the mob
On the next nomination day,
Like the dream that succeedeth to pork,
Comes the thought of what they will say.
For for hours and for hours,
As long as the hustings stand,
As long as there's chaff in the people,
As long as there’s breath in the band;
The pledges I gave last election,
And broke—my opponents say—
Will rise like political spectres,
And trouble the polling day.

OUR WORKING CHILDREN.
A GREAT deal has been said of late about our working men, but little
notice has been taken of our working children. Yet working children,
if they live, grow into working men and women, and assuredly are
scarce less worthy to be talked about. At a meeting of the Working
Men's Club a few evenings ago, what is called the “half-time system”
was sensibly considered. “By this system,” said LoRD LYTTELTON,
“Which º every parent who chose to send his child to work also to send
him or her half the day to school, a very useful compromise had been effected
between the demands of labour and education. * * This system, as carried out
in the manufacturing towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, h resulted in the in.
creased education, and consequent improved life and conduct, of their inhabitants,
as had been manifested during the late cotton famine, and in many other ways.”
As a rule, it is not wise to do things by halves: but this division of
"the day's work between bodily and mental labour may certainly be
yiewed as an exception to the rule. When the mind has been exhausted,
it is a great relief to exercise the muscles; and when the limbs are
tired-but not, over-tired-with labour, there is positive refreshment in
the labour of the brain., Children's work in cotton factories, and similar
employments, is limited by Government to ten hours a day; and this
Surely is enough to weary their small limbs. If their time be wisely
halved between the workshop and the school, their handiwork and
headwork, are mutually improved by the alternate hours of rest. But
ten hours' work per diem may be said to be mere child's play compared
with the child's work which other children have to do. Gentlemen of
England who live at home at ease, perhaps have little notion of how hard
some ehildren work, and how needful it appears to make some effort to
relieve them. From a Blue-Book he produced at the meeting we have
mentioned, LORD LyTTELTON
“Gave an instance of a little girl engaged in a brick-yard near Birmingham from
6A.M. to 8 P.M., only having fifteen minutes for breakfast, and thirty minutes for
dinner, no time for tea, and during one day she would have to catch and throw to
her neighbour fifteen tons of bicº
What, a mercy it would be to such poor little working children if
their fathers were compelled to send themeveryday to schoolſ"But,”
says BRown or ToMKINs, “this is a free country. By, our blessed
Constitution men are left at liberty, if they like it, to be brutes. The
British Government has no right to compel a British subject to educate
his child.” And so we, º Britons keep on twiddling
our thumbs, and b #. ir, that slavery was never known in

FALSE ALARM.

Fred. “HA1 ha I HA! Not I I Don't BE THE LEast ALARMED, AMy AIN'T IT A Jolly Costume, This Hot WEATHER }"
THE AUTHORS’ WOLUNTEER HORSE ARTILLERY.
WAS, it not, Rowland HILL who said he did not see why the devil
should have all the best music? So it might be submitted there is no
reason that entitles the devil to have the best Volunteers, namely the
Inns of Court Regiment, called the, “Devil's Own.” The Lawyers,
however, being inevitably his due, the only way to deprive him of a
military pre-eminence which he does not deserve is that of creating a
corps that shall cut out the one enrolled under his name. There
is on foot an endeavour to effect, this object by the institution of
a corps that might be denominated the Muses' Own. We are informed,
by a Prospectus lately published, that:—
“In accordance with a general feeling on the subject, it is proposed to form a
Mounted BATTERY or VolunTEER ARTILLERY, composed chiefly of GENTLEMEN
CoNNECTED MORE or LEss DIRECTLY witH LITERATURE. It has been found useful,
as well as socially convenient, to call upon classes engaged in Cognate Pursuits and
of kindred Tastes to form themselves into WolunTEER Corps; and the results, as
evinced by such eminent Regiments as the ‘Aatists,' the ‘INNs of Court, and
others, have been strikingly successful.”
The announcement commencing as above is surmounted with a device
consisting of a horse's head shooting vapour from the nostrils, over a
pyramid of bombshells. One of these is charged (outside on a sort of
shield), with a º and a sword, saltier-wise; a second with a miniature
cannon, and a third with a smaller shell fizzing. To the right and left
of these implements of destruction there is another smaller shell topped
with a crown, and inscribed with two intersecting triangles. In the
centre of the prospectus, surrounded by letter-press, is the photograph
of some gentleman in the “Full Dress of the “A. W. H. A.’”
Authors are apprised that:—
"The exclusive character of the corps, and the promises of influential support
which have been already received, will cause the subscriptions of efficient members
tº be moderate in amount, and one of the first rules, proposed to the corps will be,
that “all extraneous expenditure is to be entirely discouraged.”
This is a very needful provision; for the intrinsic expenditure of a
{mounted Volunteer Corps would probably be quite high enough for any
but the most su writers. The country will of course provide
the horses required by its literary ornaments, few of whom, perhaps
i. the position of being able to stand the charge of a charger.
OWeWer:—

But,
“Many of the most eminent Authors of the day have expressed their desire to
become honorary members of the battery. Arrangements are in progress for the
use of an excellent drill-shed, and for the supply of arms and munitions. An advan-
tageous offer for horsing the guns on the “march out,' is also before the Secretary."
In whatever style the guns of the “A. W. H. A.” are horsed, the
officers and men, of course, will be mounted each on a Pegasus, if the
animal is to be obtained for love or money. -
Against the formation of a literary corps, may º be objected
the proverbial irritability of authors. Some people, may surmise that
any regiment composed of gentlemen of the pen will be more ºpt at
falling out than at falling in. These objections are to be regarded as
merely jocular. There is no serious fear that any member of the
mounted battery of literary artillerymen, whose works have been
unfavourably criticised by another, would ever be tempted to, draw his
sabre, and attempt to cut his critic up, or cut him down. Nobody need
apprehend that, at a review of literary troops, any retaliation would be
*:::: to be practised on Reviewers. Nor is it to be expected that any
little jealousies would cause a corps of penmen to quarrel about rank,
all wanting to be commanding officers.
We have not as yet seen Gazetted the name of Field-MARSHAL SIR
BULwer Lytton, nor that of MAJOR-GENERALDickens, LIEUTENANT-
GENERAL WILKIE CoLLINs, CoLoRELTRoLLOPE, or CAPTAIN READE.
We wait to see them. -
In conclusion, let Mr. Punch add, that the “A. W. H. A.” is no hoax,
but a fact, endeavouring to accomplish itself, insomuch that:-
“Pending the establishment of Head Quarters, urther information may be ob-
tained, by letter, from “The i.º. A. W. H. A.,’ 44, Dover Street, Piccadilly,
where members may be enrolled on Monday Evenings, from 5 to 7, when the Secre-
tary and one of the Drill Instructors will

It is but natural to express the hope that the Head Quarters of the
“A.W. H. A.” will prove the seat of more intelligence than that

HAPPY HOURS IN TOWN.
A HAPPY HOUR IN SOMERSET HOUSE.
It has often occurred to me that the Country Visitor now in the
Metropolis has been ill furnished with a guide not only to all places of
mere amusement, but also to those, picturesque spots in our smoky,
dingy city where instruction is combined with recreation, and where a
glance may be obtained of some portion of that jº. machinery daily
set in motion, and kept moving by the collected forces of an energetic
Government. Such a place is Somerset House.
The Northern Farmer, or Enoch Arden, or any other sojourner for
a few days in London, will, of course, insist upon being taken to Somer-
set House.
The shortest way from any point to Somerset House is to take a cab,
and ºries and cheapest is to take a friend with you, and let him
pay for it.
If you are alone, you can tell your Cabman to await your return at
the Strand Gate, while you, your inspection of the interior being
finished, can, without causing any unnecessary excitement, leave the
building by the other gate in Wellington Street. This is another cheap
method; but, like most conjuring tricks, to which it bears a close affinity,
too sudden a repetition will destroy the effect first created.
Remarks on Entering the Building.—You may make as many remarks
as you like, either on your entrance or your exit. They had better not
perhaps be of a personal character with regard to, any of the officials,
unless given in terms of unqualified admiration. Thus, you will be per-
mitted to stand in front of that Hall-beadle-porter (or Hall-porter-Hall.
beadle, or, omitting “Hall” in both cases, as allowing a *:::::::
use of the “H,” say correctly Halfbeadle-Half-porter), and exclaim,
using action expressive of unqualified admiration, “How lovely . How
beautiful!”. But you mustn't point, because, as was instilled intº you
3. the other pure moral maxims of your youth, “it’s rude to
point.”
... More Remarks on Entering.—You may say, “Here, we are again!”
if you’ve been there before, or simply “Here we are 1* if you haven't.
You will notice a dim religious light throughout the building, and small
lamps feebly burning before the shrines of St. Income-Tax, the Blessed
Legacy and Succession, the Beatified Comptrollers, and other Govern-
ment Divinities.
Perhaps it is through these media that you will be so greatly struck
by the close resemblance between Somerset House and St. Peter's at
Rome, especially if you’ve never seen the latter. The illusion would be
perfect, but for a strong smell of cooking, that issues, apparently, from
a tall and narrow watch-box close at hand. Through its glass window
you will see that this box is full of smoke. As this gradually clears away,
a Beadle appears before º: as the Genie did to the fisherman, and you
will then discover that the excessive fumigation was caused by the pre-
paration of this Jack-in-the-box-in-office's dinner, which, he has been
stewing or grilling on a small portable stove cunningly fitted into a corner
of his lantern-like round-house. Nobody, as a rule, likes to be looked at
or spoken to when eating; but you can at once put him at his ease by
* on no ceremony, and saying jocularly to him, “I say, give us
a bite.”
..You will now smile benignantly on a policeman, and walk along the
dimly-lighted corridors until you come to an ancient inscription on
the wall, which your knowledge of languages will enable you to
decipher as
“INQUIRY FOR INCOME-TAx OFFICE.”
Here you are expected to look in, and make an inquiry after the Income-
Tax. , You may ask to look at yours, or request to have it returned to
{. because you believed there was a bad shilling in it., When you
ave ascertained that the Income-Tax is quite well, proceed a few steps
further, and you will see another intimation to this effect—
"ALLowANCE office For spoiled stamps.”
In this room you may spend a very amusing quarter of an hour in
spoiling Stamps. This is the only office where, you are allowed by
Government to do it. On leaving it, seek the “SoLICITORs' OFFICE
For MARKING DEEDs.” This operation they will, if in a good
humour, extend to pocket-handkerchiefs, in indelible ink—initials or
name in full.
Keep your ears open, for the sounds of revelry and music. Directly
you hear some one trolling a song, make for the room. It is the CoMP-
TRolleR's QFFICE, or “Come! Troller's Office,” as it was originally
named. Qſfer to join him in any chorus. The Clerk, following the
manner of Custom-House officers, will ask for your keys, and, after a
short exercise, you may retire.
After several journeyings up-stairs and down-stairs, you will be in-
clined to ask, "Who's Wills?”
You'll find him proved “within ten years” and without ten years, at
the top of the House, at the bottom of the House, in the middle of the
House, and, in fact, in every part of the House. . This WILLs is
examined, indexed, and treated in all sorts of ways. In one place he’s
called “OLD WILLs,” in another—only we didn't see this ourselves-
“Young WILLs,” and, for aught we know, “MIDPLE-AGED WILLs.”
There is also in Somerset House a School for Politeness. Over one
door you will see, in large characters,
“DUTIES RECEIVED.”
Every visitor must enter here, and pay his duty to the venerable gen-
tleman seated in a private box, behind a sort of counter, as if he'd got
something to sell, but he hasn't, on the right-hand side of the door, as
you go in. The ceremony is confined to two bows, and the expression
of a hope that he, the old gentleman, is enjoying the best possible
health. "You may ask him a riddle, if you like, but this is not compul-
sory, nor is it in any way expected of you. You can see him fed at one
o'clock, when, if #. call, you will be expected to throw him a penny
bun. There is a baker's shop close at hand, in the Strand, where you
can get yesterday's buns for a halfpenny each. This is worth knowing.
Call in at the AUDITOFFICE. This is where the celebrated strong ale,
so popular at Cambridge, is brewed. Audit ale is given away gratis on
some feast days. The beverage is named after the office, not the
office after the beverage. The name signifies, “He hears;” and the
two gentlemen, who are seated in this room are bound to listen, to
everything that anyone may say to them. They are not compelled
to answer, or to make any observation whatever, but they must
hear you. No deaf person need apply, for the appointment. Here
you will always find a gentle sympathiser for your grievances—a
steady listener appointed thereto by a compassionate Government.
You will º: surprised at the number of policemen in the
passages of Somerset House: the fact is, that the presence of one
necessitated the employment of the rest. A 2 was stationed there to
look after. Al, and the duty devolving upon A3 was to see that A2
and Al didn't shirk; and so on, up to the last man in the division. At
first sight one might almost imagine that these gentry would be better
employed out-of-doors; but, at all events, there is no excuse for, not
giving a direct answer to the vulgar cry, “Where are the Police f" by
immediately replying, “In Somerset House.” - -
You may now quit Somerset House, and go home to dinner, thanking
our guidance for your first Happy Hour in Town. *

AURAL EDUCATION.
Ma. MAPLeson deserves the thanks of all lovers of good music for his produc-
tion of Medea and the Magic Flute. Such music liſts the nose from the grind;
stone of one's daily mundane drudgery, and elevates the mind while amusing and
refining it. Ordinary operas are in their way a pleasant pastime, and do not need
much stretching of the ears or straining of the mind to comprehend their purpºrt.
But such music as was written by MozART, and CHERUBINI demands a higher
faculty rightly to enjoy it, and a far more lasting *. is derived from its
enjoyment. Men who have the ears of MIDAs, and whose minds are made to
match, may think that operas are written simply to be yawned º and may
view them as a proper undercurrent for mere small talk. But a ttle careful
hearing of the music which MozART wrote must convince a man, with brains that
ideas may reach the mind by other channels than, mere words, and that the
mental faculties are bettered by receiving them. Happy, is the man, who can
derive the greatest pleasure from the various enjoyments this varying world
affords; and men who think that music is only meant to dance to, or be fashion-
ably chatted º may, by attentive hearing of MozART and CHERUBINI, soon
learn that a much higher enjoyment may be gleaned from it. By education of
the ear great pleasure maybe gained; and no one is so fit to complete this education
as one of the old masters. The more good music one hears, the more one learns to

Progress in Political Economy.
A Deputation from the township of Everton had an interview on Monday
last week with the Right Hon. C. P. VILLIERs at the Qffice of the Poor-law
Board, Whitehall. We understand that the object of the Everton deputation had
reference to a proposal contemplated by the Poor-law Commissioners, of supplying
pauper children in workhouses with Everton Toffee.
THE DYING PARLIAMENT TO PUNCH.
“Who’s there? Is’t Punch * You sat beside my cradle,
You sit beside the death-bed, where I sink,
Your weekly sauce-boat has supplied my ladle
With wholesome sweets or tonic diet-drink:
And now your hand mixes the cooling cup
The last from which these fevered lips shall sup.
“I’ve blessed your bâton e'en when o'er my knuckles,
It came with sharpest sting and heaviest weight;
I’ve loved your hunch, that cringes not nor truckles,
But with a bold, blank turn, marks scorn or hate.
I knew well how that honest rap I’d earned,
That tell-tale hump right in my face had turned.
“They might have waited till my breath was fºur ;
But to the country all my sons have hurried,
Leaving me here unpitied and alone, . .
Doglike to die, and dog-like to be buried;
‘He’s lived his life. He’s weak, poor, and outworn,'
So I pass hence in solitude and scorn!
“They say that by base fears I’ve been o'er-awed,
Lavish of promise, impotent of good,
At home dogothing, egotist abroad,
‘Letting Idare not wait upon I would’—
E’en from ‘de mortuis’ no hope I see,
I die, and none has a good word for me!
“But you will speak that word—you'll be my friend—
Ask who it was made me what I have been:
Who flattered me, till I drew near my end,
For a wise Earliament, discreet, serene:
Holding to solid good, distrusting dreams,
“Turning to scorn the falsehood of extremes.’
“Have Ibeen coward? What were they indeed
Who Counselled, shaped my voice, and hailed my law?
Have Ithought most of pelſ? Whence ºrang the greed,
Quenchless of thirst, insatiate of maw:
Have I stood by, when Might did Right o'erbear,
Who bade me fold my hands, and speak all fair?
“Both sides strove to possess my infant senses,
Into one ear the Tories buzzed. Reform,'
The Whigs int'other shouted ‘False pretences!”
Until they took the Treasury Bench by storm.
And then Reform was huddled out of sight,
But nobody complained, except John BRight.
“I’ve lightened taxes, I've freed trade from ſetters;
To Law Reform I’ve given my contribution:
I’ve kept aloof, in spite of Russell’s letters,
From foreign bothers; for the Constitution-
If I have not re-soled and heeled, I’ve vampedit,
And all must own, at least, I haven’t swamped it.
“Well, *ś. all this is no great things to boast:
Of bad bills, too, I may own to a bank full;
But I was born when caution ruled the roast,
And the time's counsel ran ‘Rest and be thankful;'
I may have been too easy, timid, quiet, .
fºur who'd have thanked me ifſ had run riot?
“Yet, here I lie; John Bull, with arms a-kimbo,
Before I’m dead my funeral sermon spouts;
And º sentences me to DANTE's limbo
Where lie the halters 'twixt desires and doubts.
No one, in death, with bitter hate besets me,
But it's too clear that nobody regrets me.
“The moral of my life?. I doubt indeed:
Is money all in all? Is Faith a fiction?
Is siding with the strongest the true creed?
Of all I doubt-except of this conviction-
That Parliaments are what the people make 'em,
And if they sleep, 'tis John Bull's place to wake 'em.
“Now close my eyes; tie up my falling clin:
Fold my arms, Christian fashion, on my bosom:
Mºy my unloying children drop their tin
For their elections, and to new men lose 'em;
May John Bull be more kind to my successor,
Or, oftwo evils, find the last the lesser!”

14 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [July 15, 1865.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ON DAY, July 3rd.
LoRD BRough AM
explained to the
Peers that he had
never been a parti-
san of American
Slavemongers, as
some misinter-
reted words of his
ad led some folks
to imagine. [No.
body imagined it—
but it suited some-
body to pretend to
do so.]. His whole
* political life had
7 showed his abhor-
% rence of the detest-
§ able institution.
But he did believe
that the North had
3 sought slave eman-
cipation, less on its
3 own account than
as a means of crush-
ing the South. This
is true %; portion
of the North, but
from the time of the
passing the Fugitive Slave Law, and the showing free citizens the spectacle of men,
women, and children, chased, on free soil, by bloodhounds and worse brutes, the
doom of the Institution was sealed. From that hour the Abolition party began to
number thousands for hundreds. That Fugitive Law was the worst blunder ever
committed by the South. .
The Peers, having been informed that the dissolution would take#. whether
º jºine. were done or not, did the business. Not a single Bill is left undis-
posed ot.
LoRD EBURY's unhappiness about the Burial Service continues, and he tried to
carry a resolution that it requires the early attention of the fegislature. He sym-
pathises deeply with the oppressed Clergy, who are obliged to express their belief in
the great mercifulness of the Supreme Being, and who repine at not being allowed
by the Church to label. each departed person according to their own notions of his
character, and his condition in the Future State. His motion was rejected by 43 to 20.
The House of Commons held debate upon the conduct of LoBD CHANCELLOR
WESTBURY. There had been a severe whip, and men who had hurried away to
the country, to make their elections sure, were summoned up to swell the ranks.
The discussion was more remarkable from the high position of the accused party
than from that of most of the speakers, or from their eloquence. MR. Hunt began
the debate, and went through the history of the Leeds case, concluding by demand-
ing a vote of censure. The LoRD Advocate answered him, and contended that
there was no case for censure, but was willing to assent to a resolution that some
further check should be placed on the granting pensions to the holders of legal offices.
MR. HENNEssy, of course, was all bitterness. MR. GeoRGE DENMAN, mentioning
that he had been snubbed by SIR RIchabd BETHELL in other days, and therefore
had no reason for supporting him, argued that the House was going to commit
a cruel wrong, and he protested against driving from office a great and f".
public servant because he had committed an error. MR. Bouver IE moved an
amendment which he explained to mean a vote of censure, though it acquitted the
ChancELLOR of corruption. He had great abilities, but they were not guided by
discretion. The Conservative party at once, and cleverly, adopted MR. Bouverie's
amendment, and thereby gained some votes. ...MR. Howes and MR. VIVIAN, mem.
bers of the Committee that had reported on the subject, expressed different views,
the former going with MR. Bouverle, the latter refusing to allow that the evidence
justified a vote of censure.
The ATToRNEy-GENERAL then delivered a most animated and earnest defence of
the CHANCELLOR, animadverted severely upon the eagerness of the Conservatives
to drive him from office, enumerated the many great services he had rendered
to the country, and asked whether a vote of Want of Confidence was to be passed
because he had on two occasions shown too much leniency to a public official.
MR. HENLEY would not vote for a resolution accusing the CHANCELLOR of
corruption; but felt that such transactions as those complained of were public
scandals, and therefore he supported MR. Bouverie.
MR. Hunt's motion was negatived. The Lord Advocate's became the sub-
stantive motion, and MR. Bouverie's amendment on it was moved.
LoRD PALMeRSTON observed that it was the unanimous opinion of the House,
that there was no charge of º: against the Chancellor. e then pro-
nounced a eulogium upon Lond WESTBURY's public services, and demanded that
leave should be given to the Government to consider the course they would adopt.
MR. DiskAELI (who knew to a man the numbers in the House, and also, what
would be the result, of allowing men to go away again) solemnly declared that
an adjournment would be a mockery.
LoRD PALMERSTON, however, divided, and the Government were beaten by
177 to 163, majority 14.
The PREMIER said that he would accept this division as
an indication of the feeling of the House, and MR. Bou-
vERIE’s amendment was carried. .
Such was the work which occupied the House of Com-
mons up to midnight.
Tuesday. LoRD CHELMsroRD explained a matter which
showed that this ex-Chancellor hath, like others, a soft
place in his heart. He had most properly refused to recom-
mend, for a pension, a person who had misconducted him-
self. Some time afterwards he wrote to express, a hope
that the pension, might be granted. Having thus, we
suppose, made his mind easy (though we do not in the least
understand the intermediate H. which turned him from
severity to lenity), his Lordship began about the Abyssinian
prisoners, and was civilly told by EARL Russell that he
was more anxious to damage the Government than to serve
the captives. . The Earl, described King THEQDohe as a
blood-thirsty tyrant, and, as THEODoRE has the English
apers read to him, this º please him. DR. BEKE (who
#: his own ideas, about the Nile) offers to go out and
negotiate for the release of the prisoners. We hope he will,
as getting them before a beak is equivalent to getting a
habeas corpus.
In reply to the ARchbishop of DUBLIN, LORD GRAN-
WILLE .# that the QUEEN had no intention of licensing an
Irish Convocation. When we are putting down the prize-
ring and cockfighting We should think not. , .
both Houses—LoRD, GRANVILLE speaking in the
Lords, and the PREMIER in the Commons—it was announced
that Lord ChancELLOR WESTBURY would resign on the
following Friday.
An attempt was made to get the Board of Trade to
attend to #. subjects of Railway accidents, but MR.
MILNER GIBSON declined to interfere. But he refuses a
request so much more pleasantly than most people can grant
one, that the House seemed rather obliged to him than
not, for refusing what was asked.
Wednesday. The Lords sat, and for one whole hour the
Royal Assent kept descending like the gentle dew from
Heaven upon a mountain of new law. - -
The Load CHANCELLOR, in a short and dignified speech,
stated that he had resigned office. He had£º to do
so months ago, when charges were first made against him,
but LoRD PALMERSTON had refused to let him set a pre-
cedent which would encou . to get up accusa-
tions in order to drive a Lord Chancellor from office. As
regarded the vote of the House of Commons, he bowed to
the opinion of that House, but hoped that at a future time
other thoughts would prevail, and a more favourable feel-
ing, be entertained towards himself. He adverted, becom-
ingly, to the measures he had proposed, and with which he
hoped that his name would be associated. He wished
that he could have inaugurated the great scheme of a
Digest of the law, but that was left to his successor. He
promised his aid, as a private Member, whenever he could
give it. All the Lords' appeal business had been done, nor
would there be, in the Court of Chancery, an appeal
unheard or a judgment unpronounced. He concluded
with a hope that any inadvertence of speech, or want of
courtesy on his part, that might have given pain, would be
erased from their Lordships' minds. Cheering followed,
and the Duke of CAMBRIDGE and other Peers shook his
Lordship's hand.
Thursday. The Suprema Dies of the Parliament. The
Royal Speech was read (very audibly, LQRD Russell) by
Lord GRANville. Its items, compressed by Mr. Punch's
extra patent hydraulic squeezer, were as follows:–
Thanks for the Session's work,
You are to be Dissolved.
Thanks for Six Years'-work.

So ended the last manifestation of consciousness on the part of the

A HINT FOR POLITICAL MENDICANTS.
A STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTCHERS.
MR. PUNCH,
WE laugh at the obtrusive impertinence exhibited by teetotallers, in parading about
with flags and banners flying over their rº and trumpets sounding before them to proclaim
their abjuration of spirituous and fermented liquors. But, Sir, if beer had risen to three
shillings a pot, I # we should very seriously approve of any demonstration that people
might make to signify their intention not to drink any until its price was reduced considerably.
Just so, although we should deride a simple procession of voluntary vegetarians, designed to
inform those who are not concerned to know, that its constituents have determined, to subsist
on greens and cereals only, we cannot but highly approve of one such as that described below,
meant, as it was, to advertise those whom it did concern that they who took part therein
were resolved to practise a temporary total abstinence from animal food. I quote the Times:-
“THE PRICE of MEAT-Worcester. Saturday.—This evening there was a demonstration on the part of the
working classes of this city—the second in a fortnight—against the high price of meat. . A body of some 300
or 400 men, chiefly of the hard-working class—engineers, ‘navyies,' skilled and unskilled labourers—marched
in procession through the city, with a band of music at the head of the procession, to the Worcester Race:
course, where a meeting was held and a protest was made against the high price of meat, which was attributed
to a monopoly amongst the farmers and butchers."
I know the interruption which, if I were talking instead on writing, I should meet with here.
I should be asked what there is to complain of in the monopoly of the sale of meat by farmers
and butchers, and if the complainants want the bakers and brewers also, the grocers and the
fruiterers too, and likewise the linen-drapers and tailors, to dealin that commodit #. My answer
would be, “Never mind;” and Ishould continue my quotation, stating the notable fact that:-
N | If I possib
“A resolution to abstain from the consumption of
meat for a certain time was adopted.”
Although these labourers attributed the high
price of meat to “monopoly,” they showed that
they perfectly well understood that in fact it was
owing to demand. We shall agree, I think, Sir,
in indorsing the comment which follows the fore:
going sentence:–
“This resolution is the wisest course that the work-
men can adopt, if they can adhere to it.”
They can, if . like, and let us hope they will.
º could, I would, as far as I could,
encourage the industrious classes to put that
sensible resolution into immediate practice by
my own example; but I am under the necessity
of dieting myself on the system of MR. BANTING.
Therefore I cannot personally renounce meat;
but I earnestly recommend all who can to do so;
and then you see, Sir, we shall get it cheaper.
Let me, therefore, beseech you to impress with all
your power upon the working classes the wisdom
of taking good heed to the suggestion which the
paragraph above quoted winds up with:-
“There can be no doubt that the present high price
- of meat is mainly to be traced to the fact that the con-
sumption on the part of the working classes has of late
years enormously increased, owing to their lº.
condition, good wages, and cheap bread. A general reso-
lution on their part to limit the consumption would soon
bring down the price.”
To be sure it would. This is the sort of strike
the working classes may safely combine to turn
out in. They will not injure themselves, nor
hurt their wives and families; on the contrary,
all the while the strike lasts, they will be put-
ting by money. The public will support instead
of discouraging them. Let them everywhere
in places where meat is too dear, raise the stan-
dard of self-control against the exorbitant
butchers, and march about as much as they like
under a variety of colours emblazoned with
suitable mottoes, such as, “No Beef till further
Notice,” “No more Mutton at Present,”
“Farewell to Dear Weal!” and with the war-
cries or watchwords of, “Arrow-root ' "
“Tapioca!” “Sagol". “Bread-and-Cheese!”
“Oatcake!” “Beans!” “Peas 1” “Turnips!”
“Potatoes 1’’ “Cabbage!” “Carrots 1” ac-
companied by symbolical representations of those
several vegetables. If they please, let them have
bands of music to play before them; but with a
view to give special effect and point to their
demonstrations, they had better be preceded *
marrow-bones and cleavers. . Whilst others,
trust, are endeavouring, by total abstinence from
butchers' meat, to reduce the butchers to reason,
I remain, medicinally, of course, always
A BEEFEATER.
P.S. The bands that precede the processions
demonstrating the renouncement of the flesh they
cannot afford...might play, “O the Roast Beaf ºf
Old England!"—ironically.

Lord Bethell. I am unaware, LoRD ST. ALBANs, that any demand has

Bacon. Nay, nay, my Lord, let your speech be grave, as be-

Lord Bethell. The saying is not entirely new to me, my Lord, but I

to a Censured man.
Lord Bacon. Werat censura columbas, as our gay friend FLAccus
observes; not that I would liken or compare your Lordship to a dove,
nor would you desire the same... But I would have you presently take

Lord Bethell. I am in no haste, my Lord. I have resigned the Great

Lord Bacon. Why, therein is comfort already. . For though I ever
hold idleness a crime, the bow of Ulysses must be at times unstrung,

retort the savage threat of the reptile linguá vibrante minar.

Lord Bethell. I may think so, LoRD ST. ALBANs, but our country-

the words with a solemn voice over his marmalade at breakfast, and
he and his friends twaddle uncluously over the phrase as they ride
to job in the stocks or rig, the market. Country parsons, taught by
their provincial paper, look at the words with mingled terror and
delight, and tell their female parishioners that Parliament has avenged
the Church on the atheistic Privy Council.
Lord Bacon, Methinks that he who has sat in my seat is over-timid,

own haughty scorn of the ignorant many, provided that you stood well
in the eyes of the liberal few, was justified in your own days, but we

Lord Bacon. Still, sententiae ponderantur non numerantur. And to that
end, and if it may be that I may show your Lordship that the tears are

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Lord Bacon. I was fined £40,000, sent to the Tower, declared inca-
pable of ever holding another office, of sitting in Parliament, or coming
to Court. Those items are inscribed for ever under the memorabile et
venerabile nomen, FRANcis BAcon. Yet that name is a household word
in this kingdom.
Lord Bethell. I see F. Lordship's drift. It is lucky for me that
party spirit, by which I have been persecuted, for good reasons, was not
sºul enough to damage my character, though I might lose my
place.
Lord Bacon. Melius est cavere semper quam pati semel, but he is to be
held fortunate who hath been careless, yet suffers slightly. For, bating
the loss of place, what else have you lost? One hundred and seventy-
seven enemies voted against one hundred and sixty-three friends. We
will deduct the lesser number from the greater. What is the difference?
Lord Bethell. Fourteen.
Lord Bacon. Fourteen men say that your Lordship should retire. . I
pray you give me the muster-roll. I see that the whole of the Tories
who could be whipped into the House were against you, with a few
extra votes, as Bouverie, who is of the priggish nature, SIR MoRTON
PETo, the Baptist builder, and Bowyer, the Papist. I see HENNessy,
the tool of the Papists, the sapient LENNoxes, Rose, the ex-Mayor, the
aged if not wise DUKE, the Parliamentary Colonels, ever blatant against
reforms, and some barristers. Truly, my Lord, it must be a tender skin
indeed that feels such bites. Surely you will say, Mens invicta manet.
Lord Bethell. All votes count alike in a division. PALMERSTON can-
not outweigh even Peto. -
Lord Bacon. Distinguo. Your country is the scrutineer. Your coun-
trymen know that the Vote of Censure was a Party Move. You are
hated by the Tories for the reforms you have wrought, and still more
for those you threaten. The vermin, of the Bankruptcy Court have
been rudely brushed by you, and would have been brushed out entirely,
had you remained in office. You have given the Divorce Court to the
people. You have simplified conveyancing... This and more will be
remembered, when your errors shall be forgotten.
Lord Bethell. I admit the errors.
Lord Bacon. They were two, and non licet in bello bis peccare. But
Englishmen do not hate a man much because he has been too lenient,
or because he has been wrongly tolerant of the evil deeds of his
children. You have been F. my Lord, and will live to serve the
State. Now ignarus mali, I give you this consolation. I add that much
of your trouble is from another fault.
ord Bethell. I wish to hear it.
Lord Bacon. Intolerant of fools and knaves, you have made yourself,
by virtue of a bitter tongue, the least popular man in England. My
gracious manners and flowing eloquence made friends out of enemies.
Multis terribilis, caveto multos, as AUSONIUs remarks,
Lord Bethell. It may be so. But it is very hard to hear a knave
talking what he knows to be folly, and yet not to give him a backhander.
Hºwe, I will mend. You would not have me retire from public
lie
Lord Bacon. Minimè. The nation can ill spare such a brain. Go to
the House of Lords and do your duty. A *... or so may be spiteful,
but the Peers are gentlemen, and will remember that memo bis verari
debet pro eaden causá. It is from your country that you have your
retaining fee, my Lord, And for the end, for I may tarry no longer,
take my advice, which I gave to JUDGE Hutton. “Mix well the
freedom of your own opinion with reverence of the opinion of your
fellows, affect not the opinion of pregnancy and expedition by an im-
patient and catching hearing of others, and fear no man's face, yet turn
not stoutness into defiance.” And so I bid your Lordship heartily
farewell. Erit.
Lord Bethell. As my friend Mr. Punch said, “the character of that
Bacon was streaky,” but he always spoke the words of wisdom. My
lark shall whistle yet.
ATTESTATION OF QUACKERY.
. The subjoined fudge comes out of a respectable Journal, in which it
is printed at the bottom of a column of news, in the same type with the
rest of the column, ostensibly as a simple statement, and not as an
advertisement:—
“DR PRITchard.—This trial is now going on in Edinburgh, and will form a
retty specimen of the pharmaceutical poisons used in medicine, against which the
ritish College of Health, on behalf of the Society of Hygeists, has protested for the
last forty years. Let the public look to it.—British College of Health, Euston Road,
London, July 4.”
In the same part of the next column but one, and under the same

ETHNOLOGISTS AND PHRENOLOGISTS.
At a meeting of the Ethnological Society, the other day, a report of a
Government Commission on certain Indian tribes inhabiting the region
between Vancouver's Island and the Rocky Mountains, having been
read, a discussion took place on the particulars comprised in it, and,
amongst them, on a practice peculiar to a tribe of savages bearing the
suggestive name of 8. of flattening the heads of their children
by artificial pressure in infancy. In regard to which:-
“DR. Donovan expressed the opinion that the effect of flattening the heads of
the Indians must have been to diminish their intellectual capacities; and the
rationale of the practice he conceived to be, that the Indians desired to make their
children as much like animals as possible, and therefore flattened their heads to
prevent the development of the intellectual organs.”
Without believing in the details of phrenology, and only supposing
that the human brains have something to do with the human mind,
most people would be inclined to share DR. DoNovaN's opinion, that
the effect of flattening the heads of the Indian children must have been
that of diminishing their intellectual faculties. But :-
“Colonel Hawkins, who was one of the Commissioners, when appealed to by
the Chairman on the subject, said they had observed no difference in the intellec-
tual capacities of the Indians with the compressed meads."
..This is the sort of answer which any physiologist, let alone phrenolo-
gist, may always expect to get to any question apparently asked with a
view to obtain a confirmation of an opinion, from any such referee as an
officer in the military or civil service who has never studied the subject
it relates to. Such a reply has all the effect of a snub, which, inflicted
on an individual, is always delightful to the majority of those present,
who do not think with him. DR. Donov AN had suggested that the
compression of Indian heads probably impaired Indian intelligence, and
Colonel Hawkins, when invited to say if it did, answered, as many
other gentlemen under similar circumstances would have answered, that
it had not been observed to do anything of the kind. . So far so good.
Not only, however, were the Indians with flattened heads no duller
than the rest of their race, but, added the gallant officer:—
“They were, if anything, rather sharper than others.”
..This proves rather too much for the commendable purpose of snub-
bing a physiological inquirer: , For that purpose it was enough to say
that compression of the skull had not been observed to injure the mind.
Credulity is taxed by the statement, that the compression of certain
men's brains rendered them sharper than other men—if anything. Such
anti-phrenology is harder to believe than phrenology.
FOLLOW MY LEADER,
(DIZZY ON DERBY.)
"If a man comes to me with a dog with a muzzle on, and says, “Take the muzzle
off the poor creature; he is quite harmless: and besides, the muzzle is half rotten,
and affords no great protection," I understand him; but if he says, “This is a most
vicious animal, and nothing prevents him pulling you and me to pieces except the
muzzle which is put round his nose, and therefore I want you to take it off,' I am
inclined to say, 'Very much obliged to you, but I had rather keep the muzzle on."
(LoRD DERby on Roman Catholic Oaths Bill.)
Follow my leader—ay, so you may bawl,
But, how; when my leader, his head in the air,
And the bit in his teeth, goes full-butt at the wall,
I’ve been trying my 'cutest to prove isn't there, -
When he kicks through the cobwebs, I’ve spun with such pains,
Flings his heels out at Ireland, however we need her,
Tells the priests they are dogs fit for muzzles and chains—
It's all very well to say, “Follow my leader l’”
“Follow my leader,” though wildly erratic
He i. away from the Treasury-Benca,
Trampling down the young fruits of my seeds diplomatic,
Which I’ve toiled so to drill, and to weed, and to trench,
Though he can’t see an inch in advance of his nose,
Though my prospects he cross, and my dodges he mull,
To our friends show his heels, and his tail to our foes,
“Follow my leader,” and land on my skull!

A MODERN GREGORIAN TONE.
(A Chaunt pointed according to the Use of Norwich.)
THERE were five persons of Norwich City; who took and went into a

There was BROTHER CLEMENT and STANſsLAUs: and BROTHER
IGNATIUs who had the Superioritee-e.
There was BROTHER BRANNock and BROTHER MAURUs: and the
youngest he was Little SAMMÉE-E.
And they called themselves of the Order of Saint Bénedict: which is

They blessed and they cursed and excommunicated one and ther: and
they all lived so delightfullee.e.
They'd no meat for breakfast and no meat for dinner: and not a bit o'

But SAM he was allowed a pat of

And BROTHER IGNATIUs as the Supérior: he could indulge in the

Which filled BROTHER CLEMENT, and STANſsLAUs: and BROTHER

As it would have filled too BRoth ER MAURUs: only he wasn’t as yet
a member of the Confratérnitee-e.
But BROTHER IGNATIUS was ordered by his doctor: to take a little
chicken and a glass of sher-reele.
So when the Brethren heard the prescription: they all wished the
doctor för to see-e.
And BANNock had spasms and CLEMENT atoothache; and Stanislaus

But the doctor, said there was nothing the matter: which was most

So they looked on at BROTHER IGNATIUs éating: and they all were so

The Safety Powder Company’s Works, Southdown,
Hamoaze, Plymouth, blew up the other day. A telegram

Powder, whereof the explosion is harmless to the neigh.
bourhood in which it occurs, is perhaps little likely to do
much harm under any circumstances. *. sort of powder
seems calculated for exportation to foreign countries for

It is not true that BROTHER IGNATIUs and the monks, his associates
have removed from their monastery at Norwich to the Zoologica
Gardens, Regent's Park, and there taken up their abode in the Monkey.
house. Subjoined is the latest authentic intelligence concerning that
pithecoid Benedictine:—
“BRoth ER lanatius–BROTHER IGNATIUs has returned to the monastery at
Norwich. In his absence he had been excommunicated by some of the monks—
viz., BRoth ER BRANNock, BRoth ER MAURUs, BROTHER STANISLAUs, and BRother
CLEMENT. Brothen MAURUs, who styles himself chaplain to the Chief Justice of
Tasmania, has left the monastery; but BROTHER Stanislaus has been induced to
make an ample apology for the part he took in the excommunication and “rebel-
lion" (as it is termed) by Brother ſonatius. It is a very pretty quarrel as it
BROTHER MAURUs charges BROTHER IGNATIUs with tyranny and insinua-
tions. ... BROTHER IGNATIus charges BRothen MAURUs with dishonourable insub-
ordination and disregard of solemnly contracted vows. At least ten of the monks
have left the monastery, the fortunes of which have sustained a very severe shock.”
The simious brotherhood, of which BROTHER or FATHER IGNATIUs
acts the i. Jackanapes, remain in their old monkeyry at Norwich,
all except the ten who have deserted it, and perhaps cast off their mon-
keyish habits... Were not the acts of these mimic monks like those of
monkeys, it might be said that the vagaries practised by them during
IGNATIUs's absence were illustrative of the proverb, “When the cat is
tº: mice will play.”. But though, as monks in the Church of
England, they . in relation to that Church, be regarded as vermin
of the rodent order, yet the tricks they played behind their sham
Superior's back, in pretending to excommunicate him, can only be
looked upon as monkeys' tricks. Playing at, excommunication would
betºº. only among a set of ecclesiastical monkeys.

themselves so ridiculous that it is, perhaps, fortunate that there is no

answer the same purpose as that which Helots were made drunk on
purpose to serve amongst the Spartans. Their extravagances are cal-
culated to disgust all beholders. They may call one another BROTHER
CLEMENT and BROTHER “MAURUs,” meaning probably MAURICE, but
names much more appropriate for them would be BROTHER Jocko and
BROTHER PUG, and their FATHER IGNATIUs, squabbling as he per-
petually is with his subordinate monkeys, should change name for
that of FATHER PUG-NACIOUs. -
If nobody would take any notice of IGNATIUS he would most likely
discontinue his public performances, which it is desirable that he should
continue for the sake of example such as that which, was afforded by
the drunken Helots, and this is the only reason why he is ever noticed
by Punch.
HOMOEOPATHY AND HUMBUG IN PARLIAMENT.
Even if Homoeopathy is humbug, why should not a Homoeopathist
sit in the House of Commons? Homoeopathists, sit in the French
Senate. For, the other day, in Paris, according to REUTER-
“In yesterday's sitting of the Senate a debate took place upon a petition in favour
of certain privileges to be accorded to homoeopathic doctors. M. DUMAs and M.
DuPIN condemned the principles of homoeopathy, which were defended by M.
Bonjean and M. Thayer."
The question whether the practice of homoeopathy shall be ".
or not, concerns nothing more than the public health, and therefore
what does it signify if homoeopathy is humbug?... Humbug is at least
not less Parliamentary in the British Legislature than it is in the French.
Homoeopathy and Humbug for Ever!

MESSAGES FROM THE GREAT EASTERN.
It is hardly necessary for Mr. Punch to say that although the
Directors of the Great Eastern declined to admit the 376 representa-
tives of the British press, who demanded permission to go out with the
wire, and rations during the voyage, His Representative was instantly
received with all honour, and that the intelligent person in question, has
a delightful cabin, and champagne ad libitum. W. have arranged to
receive Messages until the work shall be completed; and, to our delight,
our Correspondent has already begun to transmit them.
- - “Great Eastern, July 14.
“I)on't like beginning to send on a Friday, but who's afraid? The
ship is all that can be desired, the officers are most polite and affable,
the sailors are truly manly, the electricians are brilliant sparks, and the
correspondents are awfully jolly. From the admirable prog on board, I
prognosticate success.”
“Saturday.
“Wished to test, the steadiness of the ship under, exceptional cir;
cumstances. Drank twice as much sparkling Moselle as usual, and
more. Any other, ship would have gone round and round, with me.
This noble vessel did not, which is in part attributable to the build, part
to the brand.”
“Sunday.
“We are making excellent progress, but you must send me another
map. I knew we were going to Walentia, but thought it was in Spain,
where the raisins come from. ...Find we have changed our route for
Valentia in Ireland. I do not like this change of spots, which is a vac-
cinating policy, but must submit. Send me an Irish Handbook. Church
to-day. Sermon sent through the Wire. Electrifying discourse.”
“Monday.
“Goat got loose and ran full butt against the compass. A wit
remarked, "Goat and compasses.” Milking time being fixed, another
wit remarked, “Off Cowes.”. Pigs made a great, grunting; supposed
they saw a sow-wester. Took, great, pains to understand the nature of
the telegraph, and it was kindly explained to me by a literary gentle-
man with a slight Irish accent. He told me that sea-water being
electric, as was shown by the phosphorus at night, all that was needed
to generate messages was gutta-percha heated by galvanism, for which
reason the Batteries at Valentia and Newfoundland were selected as
points. This is beautifully simple. All goes well, except my watch,
which fell into a tar tub.”
“Tuesday.
“Nothing to describe. Going very steadily. Asked Irish gentleman
how many knots an hour, and he explained to me that knots were not
as I had supposed, lumps in a rope, but “negative terms,’ and shoul
be spelt 'nots.” He said that they were converted into positive terms
and calculated by an astronomical process which a non-profession
person could not understand, but it was done (I think) by a sexton
taking an observation at a quadroom.”
“Wednesday.
“The Moselle is better than the Champagne, though that is good.
No persons have been sick, except some youthful smokers. The wire
is in perfect order, and insulated, as is natural, coming from an island.
A pig was º near the galvanic machine, and the ring in his nose
was touched. In one second he was converted into the finest pork-
chops and sausages I ever ate... I find out. new ºf: every day.
CAPTAIN ANDERson is not the Wizard of the North, as I had suppºsed.
There is a great artist on board, and you may imagine the jokes about
casting loose the Painter, and Westward Ho!' I should add, that
my messages are taken from me by a young officer, of a very merry dis:
position, and he undertakes that they shall be telegraphed, as I do not
care to go among the machinery. I shall continue to send... I hope
that the Elections are going satisfactorily. Do you know that, elec-
tricity is derived from the Greek, electron, amber? which reminds me
to ask whether LoRD AMBERLEY has got in.”

GOVERNMENT BY STEAM.
QUR facetious contemporary, the Morning Herald, has surpassed itself
of late in its brilliant jocosities. Never were such funny articles as
those which it has written on the General Election, and the E.
of the Tories, whose triumph it predicts. On the morning of the metro-
olitan elections, the Herald humorously prophesied that London,
estminster, and Greenwich would each of them return a Tory Member
to the House; and in another exquisitely funny leading article, it thus
facetiously accounted for the wonderful prosperity which, under the
present Government, the country has enjoyed:–
“On what ground do the Whigs solicit now a renewal of the confidence of the
country? England is prosperous, and Englishmen are thriving, and large remis-
sions of taxation have taken place during the last six years. It happens that the
discovery of the steam-engine has given an immense impetus to manufactures and
commerce. As the revenue increases pari passu, with the wealth of the country,
nothing can be more natural than that taxation should be gradually remitted. It
augurs a lamentable confusion of cause and effect that this increase of wealth
should be ascribed to the remission of taxation. The fallacy reminds us of the old
story of the fly on the waterwheel. That Lord PALMERston should claim all the
credit which is due to JAMEs Watt, is a notable illustration of the old principle of
sic vos non vobis.
This connection of Lord PALMenston with the-ha! ha" haſ-the
discovery of the steam-engine, is really so delicious, that—ha! haſ ha!—
we fear we shall split our pen with laughing at it. How funny of the
Herald to pretend that it has just found out that steam-engines have—
ha! haſ hal—have actually been invented, and really have extended the
commerce of the country! And how LoRD PALMERSTON will laugh to
learn that he has “claimed all the credit which is due to JAMEs WATT,”
which is equivalent to sa # that his Lordship has claimed the inven-
tion of the j a! haſ hal. Such jokes as these are really
overpowering. Why, our facetious contemporary will doubtless soon
lling us that, as it has been caused by the invention of the steam-
engine, the success of the Whig Ministry is a mere succès de steam.
By a man who owns a doubt,
Though the Record's faithful fist

What must be his creed, who dooms

Woe! Oh woe to Westminster,
When with MILL she stoops to err,
And declines to care a rap
For the 'Tizer and the Tap !

THERE's this to say about the Scotch,

READING FOR ROGUES AND THIEVES.
THE following extract from a letter, addressed by a convict at
Portland Prison, a fellow named SAYERs, to his brother, will afford
admonitory information to any thief who may be enabled to read it by
having stolen a number of Punch :-
“I hope I shall be at liberty in ten months. I have to work like a slave. It is
worse than slavery under a mask, but I must get through it as well as I can. You have
not the slightest idea what I have to put up with, and I dread another winter.”
It appears, from the foregoing vague but suggestive revelation of the
secrets of the prison-house at Portland, that the life of a convict in
gaol no longer bears much resemblance to that of a gentleman at lar
staying at a luxurious hotel. There is a certain illustrated weekly
journal, the contents of which, consist chiefly of tales, and pictures of
crime, F. under the title, we think, of the Illustrated Police
News. This print probably has a considerable circulation among thieves,
and particularly young rascals who delight in stories about exploits
such as those of TURPIN and JAck Sheppard. It is true that many
thieves cannot read at all, and that the rest are mostly in case to be
classified in the gaol calendar in the category of “R. & W. Imp.; ” but
they can all at least understand pictures that are addressed to the
lower feelings. The generality of thieves, therefore, probably see and
know what is in the Illustrated Police News. That less useful than
entertaining journal would do a service to the respectable portion of the
community, and afford instruction as well as entertainment to rogues
and ruffians, by giving the advantage of its circulation to the lamen-
tations, above quoted from MR. SAYERs's letter, accompanied by a
portrait of MR. SAYERs, or a gentleman in MR. Sayers's position;
namely, that of a convict under sentence of penal servitude eng lil
the performance of hard labour. To which might be added, with bene-
ficial effect, a faithful account of the sensations experienced by a garotter
whilst subjected to the cat-o'-nine-tails; this narrative being also em-
bellished with a likeness of the sufferer.

-
THE ELECTIONS.
º
HE Elections for the Boroughs,
including those which are so
small and snug that they may
fairly be called Watch-pocket
Boroughs, being now con-
cluded, Mr. Punch volunteers
a review of the results which
he can with truth say, were
invariably cheering.
In some towns Whigs were
in their proper place—the top
of the poll; in others, not-
withstanding the Act passed
last Session for their sup-
pression, Tories were vic-
torious. Many Candidates,
like the bundles of impro-
vident persons on a Saturday
night, were pledged; many
Piecrustean promises were
given and swallowed with
hazardous alacrity.
“The grand old Constitu-
tion,” like some dear old
grandmamma, was petted and
made much of its “bul-
warks”. Toryfully defended,
its “ancientlandmarks” Con-
servatively cherished. Sea-
port towns saw “colours
nailed to the mast” in the
midst of excitement that
never flagged; watering-
places allowed respectable
gentlemen to be “thrown
- --- overboard” and “swamped;”
new candidates were placed “in a proud position” (whatever that may be), whilst
old members who bore away the palm at the show of hands had to knuckle down
on, the polling day, and console themselves by remarking in their “rejected
addresses,” that “if defeated they were not disgraced.”
Split votes abounded, but split, skulls were not so common as in the good old
times, owing to the spread of “election intelligence;” but as the Irish returns are
not yet complete, Mr. Punch may have something different to say on this head.
Hº! on to such an extent that one of the unsuccessful candidates at
Devonport aded at last to hear the words, “Tip us your PHINN.” In the
Metropolis the legal agents used conveyances freely, but the cabmen made no
decided stand for the one party in preference to the other, some being rank Liberals,
others, rank Tories. In Westminster, the Conservative candidate carried his
yºters in cabs, but was unable tº carry the day, “MILL's Logic” proving irresistible.
The old ladies in Marylebone, Tories to the stay-bone, are horrified at a “Common
Serjeant” being returned... -
In Finsbury, PHILLIts discreetly resigned, and, by so doing, gave a fillip to the
success of Toºns, whose victory was hailed with a torrent of º:
At Derby, MR. Bass, speaking of the Night Poaching Bill, declared he was
supporters that he had been out smaring. -
erhaps the most astounding fact in the history of the General Election of
1865 is, that at Chatham, one of the Candidates was an Admiral, and an Elliot,
but not a Whig
MUDDLE OF THE PERIOD.
We really think that the Racing World might have shut up during Election time.
Surely, there was bribing, and lying, and cheating enough elsewhere, without
the aid of the turf. Besides, the newspapers are so aggravating. They place in
alternate columns the news about the candidates and .. the horses, until one
does not know what one is reading. We arise from breakfast with this sort of thing
ore the eyes of our mind:—
"Capricorn, Bonassus, Snug, and Pop are all here and MR. PRIggins has just
finished his speech, and he is being pelted, but Musidora has kicked herself lame in
the railway carriage, and LoRD AMBERLEY has not a leg to standon. The Con-
servative has not shown, and it is said that MR. FERRAND is a roarer, but the early
trial appears to have deluded the unhappy touts, and Mr. Gladstone's friends
are getting very uneasy, though Bishop was never in better form, as will be con-
ſessed at the close of the poll. An effort has been made to introduce a leg into
the stable of the Liberals, and their minds have been poisoned, but the Jockey
Club have taken it up, and MR. SAMURLson is not disqualified, for he is no alien
but as good an jºnglishman as any of his opponents, though what Little Beggardi
for the Two Thousand does not exactly encourage his friends to put the pot on,
but, time will show, and the majority cannot be very great either way. The Chip.
am riots afford an instructive lesson to those who would confer the suffrage
previously to education, but the conduct of the jockeys, in refusing to obey the
“open to conviction,” thereby leaving an unpleasant conviction on the minds of his
orders of the starter, cannot be too severely reprimanded,
and we should recommend disfranchisement until the
borough became more alive to the sacredness of the blue
ribbon of the Turf. Jehoshaphat is scratched, and the Con-
servative Candidate has got a black eye | *

As merry as a lot o' grigs?

MR. DISRAELI'S SPEECH.
(Specially Reported.)
GENTLEMEN,
- WHETHER Conservative Reaction, now on trial, be proved
innocent or guilty, the facts remain the same. LoRD DERBy and his
Territorial party have effected whatever good has been done in this
country for many years past. Whatever of enlightened legislation has
been carried out, you owe it to LoRD DERBy j the party with which
I had the honour to act. The Emancipation of the Catholics was our
doing, and * one who will read my º novel of the Young Duke
will see that I had, even at that time, the clearest sense and the strongest
feeling of what was due to the followers of the Ancient Creed. That
the shackles of the Dissenters were struck away, and the annihilation
of the profanity, justly denounced by the poet CowPER, of the oath of
office being dipped in the chalice at the altar, was our doing. You
would never have had a Reform Bill at all but for LoRD DERBy’s
eloquence: but I may add that you would never have had so good a one
but for the persevering resistance of the Conservatives, who compelled
the Government to ...]". and improve their measure, until it arrived
at perfection. I need hardly say that you owe Savings Banks, the
Thames Embankment, the Penny Postage, Vaccination, and the Electric
Telegraph to qur party, or that all had long been prefigured in books
written years back by noblemen, and chiefly in the &. of Inventions.
That the Jews have been set free from all fetters is due to my own
exertions, and notably to my portrait of Sidonia, in whom I shadowed
forth all the intellectual §. and vigour which the Hebrew now
places at the service of the State. We have preserved the Church, while
popularising her institutions, we have defended the Constitution while
ventilating its incongruities, we have elevated the people while eradi.
cating its excentricities. True friends to the land, we have not been
unmindful of the sea; patrons of the plough, we have also been lovers
of the loom. We have compelled the Government to keep the peace, by
incessantly exposing to the country the weakness of our armaments,
and thereby enlisting fear in the service of patriotism. We have
diminished your Taxes and increased your Harvests, acclimatised the
salmon in your streams, and destroyed the bluebottles in the shops of
your butchers. LORD DERBY has ſº you the best translation of
Homer, and I have “stood upon the ruins of Troy and cursed my
destiny.” In fact, I should weary you with a repetition of the great
and grand things which we have been doing for you. But I must, in
conclusion, point out that you would do well to eject LoRD PALMER-
ston's Government at once, and replace it by a Conservative one, for a
dark cloud is looming over the Kºº. and it would be an act of the
highest wisdom to place in office a Cabinet which can over-awe the
Americans. We have ever been hostile to them, and it is no fault of
ours that the South was not recognised, and that at this moment our
troops are not winning honour and glory under the Palmetto flag. I
am able to offer you my sincerest assurance that if we come into office,
the insolence of the plebeian Dictator of the States shall be met as
becomes Britons, and that in three months we shall add to all our other
claims on your regard that of carrying you into a long and, I trust, a
glorious war with the United States. Gentlemen, three cheers for the
country party and the benefactors of Great Britain.

and has never been afloat (like his father, who sarved under DUNDAS

it strikes me (I speak from specilation) that when an enemy's shot
strikes these turrets, they spin round like a patent iron chimney pot.
Am I right? Please, say, if possible, in your next, which I reads regu-
larly on 1-Tree-Hill every Wednesday afternoon. for I likes my Punch

the waves, but how she is to rule 'em straight with a revolver puzzles
me altogether. So no more at present from
Your humble sarvant, Tom BRINEY.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
OUR COMPANY.
(How it was “got up:” what it was “got up for;” and what it did
when it was “got up.”)
In these days of Companies it struck us—me and ARCHIE BRIsTowe,
or rather vice persä, only I originated the idea—that it would be a good
notion to get up a Company. We decided that ARCHIE would make
an excellent Chairman of Directors; in fact, I rather think that it was
something in the sound of BRIstowe's name that gave rise to the
suggestion.
es, it did, too. I said to BRISTowe, “What a capital Chairman
ou'd make.” To which he replied,." Yes, Chairman of Directors.”
hereupon I cried, as if by inspiration, “Directors of a Company'
Let's get up a Company.” ARCHIE BRIsTowe said, “You’re
another;” which for the moment rather confused me.
We, having talked the matter over, called upon Joe BARCLAY.
Joe’s a good fellow, a sharp fellow, and knows a good deal about this
sort of thing. At least so we had always heard. Joe was practical
in a second. What was the Company’s object P, he asked., BRIstowe
at first suggested “the Company’s pecuniary benefit;" but, on con-
sideration, added, “and to offer peculiar advantages to the Public.”
What should it be got up for, was the †: difficulty. The solu-
tion was not quite so º: BARCLAY said that something might be
done with Soap. We thought so, too. Soap, decidedly. BRIstowe
wanted to know. “How P”. He meant, “In what way?”, BARCLAy
answered, “Well, Works—Soap Works.” “Or Drinking Fountains,”
some one suggested-I think it was myself. . . -
BRIsTowe observed that Drinking Fountains wasn't a bad notion.
BARQLay, however, stuck to Soap. Somebody, perfectly disinterested,
who had dropped in on a visit, proposed an amalgamation of the first
with the second—say, and Water.
We made him a Director on the spot. He said, No, he didn't care
about it, or he'd rather not; but we included him in our list, and told
him that it wouldn't be any trouble to him. His name was FELTON,
He had a great idea of offices and papers. He said everything ought
to be done in form; where was a bit of paper? and pens P and ink?
Now he would at once put down the names of the Directors.
The idea struck us all at once, FELTON should be the Secretary—the
very man for the post. FELTON said, “No, no, no! he’d rather not.”
We said, “Yes, and with a salary. By all means with a salary.”
Carried mem. con, Felton voting with us. . -
BRistowe proposed that this should be considered our first meeting.
BARCLAY said that of course the Company would be Limited. e
said, “Yes; Limited, decidedly.” (“Limited ”) in brackets.
PIDGE wanted to know what was meant by “Limited.” The Chair-
man said, we’d come to that by-and-by.
FELTON asked authoritatively where was a note-book?
BARCLAY said he'd send out for one; and, as some of the Directors
offered to pay for it, he made a merit of presenting it to the Company.
It was a large school copy-book...Felton said it would do for the
present, just to enter minutes in. We agreed that for that purpose it
was peculiarly well adapted. -
Well, what should be our first minute? asked the Secretary, looking
round, pen in hand.
We appealed to the Chairman, who was on the sofa. . It was agreed
unanimously that a Chairman mustn't sit on a sofa; that business was
business; and that if this thing was to come to anything, we really
must be business-like. The Chairman, after some little difficulty,
arising, from the question being put as to whether smoking should be
allowed during a business-meeting (this was settled in favour of
smoking), took the chair.
FELton then wrote down,
“First Meeting of Directors (with date),
Chairman . . . . . . MR. Bristowe.
Directors Present . . . . MEssrs. BARCLAY AND Pidge.
Secretary . . . . . . MR. FELTON.”
..The Chairman found fault with this arrangement, and said it looked
like a playbill.
The Secretary was noting down this remark, when
A Director asked, if it wouldn’t be as well to avoid tomfoolery, and
come to business?
Carried, mem. con.
Another Director (myself) wanted to know how this resolution should
be entered on the books.
The Chairman said there was only one book. (A laugh.)
The same Director said he knew that, but—
The Secretary expressed his sorrow at interrupting the honourable
ſº (º, but he had already entered the resolution in
is book, thus: “Resolved, that there be no tomfoolery.”
The Chairman asked what was the Company for?
BARCLAY said Soap.
The Secretary asked if the Company's motto would be, “How are
you off for Soap?”
It was unanimously decided that this was tomfoolery contemplated
by our bye-law.
One of the Directors wished to inquire whether the Minutes were
by laws, or, generally speaking, what was a bye-law
The Chairman explained that a bye-law was a law made when another
law existing-or rather, to put it clearer, a bye-law was rendered neces-
sary by an already existing law to a contrary effect—
Secretary (interrupting). No; to the same effect.
Chairman. Well, a bye-law is merely a law that—
4 Director. Yes, but has it the force of law For instance,—
“Smoking is strictly forbidden on the platform, vide Bye-Laws”—
was that a--(wandering)—was this bye-law one of the Regular Laws,
or—or, in fact—
Another Director (plaintively). But there are no platforms in our
Company. (Laugh from the Secretary.)
First Director said it was nonsense talking like this. He (PIDGE)
knew what he (BARCLAY) meant.
The Secretary inquired what he should write down as being the object
that, the Company had in view. Was it Soap, or not?' He had
scratched out Soap once, and it was absurd going on writing down and
scratching out every minute.
Everyone said that this was absurd, and that the books ought to be
kept in a business-like manner. *
BARCLAY asked whether we proposed the sale of Common Soap,
Windsor Soap, Scented Soap, or all kinds of Soap?
Pidge (as the best way of getting out of an unforeseen difficulty). Oh!
all kinds of Soap.
All shake their heads. Somehow, no one sees the feasibility of the
Soap project now. . A silence ensues, during which the Chairman looks
vacantly at his watch-chain, and the Secretary attempts a portrait of
nobody in particular, in fancy costume, among the minutes. The two
Directors watch, him feebly, with some vague feeling that the whole
proceeding is not exactly business-like.

write). Here! Just stop for me! Look here, what shall I write

MIND YOUR ACCENTS,
In a penny paper, the other day, there appeared a paragraph, headed
as follows:–
“WoRKING MEN's CLUB FETE.”
It went on to relate the particulars of a social gathering, described
as “a pic-nic of an unusual character.” This description of the pic-nic
seemed to suggest that it had been held for the benefit of the “Ortho-
aedic Hospital,” or some similar institution for the cure of club feet.
nstead of feet, however, the continuation of the narrative indicated the
right reading, for what looked like simply wrong spelling, to be fête.

THE LAW OF SELF DEFENCE.
The remarks of the venerable CHIEF BARON are mostly so replete with
common sense that the ensuing extract from his summing up, on the
trial of MR. DEBENHAM, as given in the Times, may surely be supposed
to have been strangely modified by the pen of a generally correct
reporter:—
“It was not of much consequence to consider whether or not the house had been
attempted to be entered before by burglars, though one would think that if such
attempts were made, the prisoner ought to have been the more cool and cautious.”
From being used to it? A man’s house has been several times broken
open, and therefore he ought to be able to take an apparent attempt to
break into it coolly! This is what the LORD CHIEF BARON is made to
say. Lord Dundreary would hardly have said it. His Lordship is
represented to have proceeded to lay down the law thus:—
“There were undoubtedly circumstances in which the firing of a pistol would be
justifiable—those, for instance, in which a burglar entered a house, or was about to
enter one, with all the implements of housebreaking upon him, and there were no
other means of preventing the loss of life, or property, or both.”
It is possible that the words above quoted may have really been those
of the learned Judge, who presided at MR. DEBENHAM's trial. The
CHIEF BARON was obliged to law down the law as it is. It is the law
then, and not the CHIEF BARON personally, that tells you that you are
justified in firing at a burglar only under circumstances which it is
impossible for you to know. You are at liberty to shoot a burglar only
in case you are quite certain that he has skeleton keys, and a “jemmy,”
and a life preserver, or some other deadly weapon in his pockets, and
that he will * attempt to rob you or murder you, or both, even if
you give him the chance of stealing off. Dogberry, in his charge to the
watch, said something very much of this sort, which the LoRD CHIEF
BARON had to say in his charge to the jury. But Dogberry was dic:
tating, not laying down, the law, and the law was Dogberry's own, and
therefore Dogberry, personifying the law, deserved to be written down
all as S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CONVERTED ENGLAND.
EALLY, Boulogne-sur-
mer must be an inte-
# place to She-
riffs' officersandothers
as being the resort of
expatriated English-
men,whose debts, alas,
ohibit their return-
ing to their nativeland.
So many Great (and
Little) Britons are, for
this reason residing
there, that the natives
of Boulo e-sur-mer
are naturally more in-
terested than º:
ers are generally for
the welfare of Great
Britons. As a proof
of this, a notice has
been sent to Mr. Punch,
º: º *
- z every Sunday, at the
SNS va church of St. Nicolas,
in Boulogne-sur-mer a
- mass is to be said:-
z *, S.
“Pour la conversion de l'Angleterre . .
helasſ separée de la Sainte Église." . autrefois l'île des Saints, maintenant,
s! separée de la Sainte e."
In the litany appointed for recital at this service, no fewer than eight
saintesses and two-and-forty saints are specially invoked by name, and
solicited to pray for poor perverted England; while other saints and
saintesses, whose names are not recorded, are in general terms entreated
to proffer their petitions to the like effect. #. common with other
º Mr. Punch of course feels grateful that such efforts are
made for the benefit of England; and when the prayers of all the saints
have succeeded in converting it, Mr. Punch and other Englishmen will
doubtless put their faith in the powers of the Saints.
RESISTANCE TO THE ARISTOCRACY.
(Communicated.)
We adverted to the attempt made by the Right Hon. the Loºp
BRIGHT at coercing the constituency of Manchester into returning his
brother, the Hon. MR. JACQR. It, was supposed that Manchester
would be compelled to submit to this dictation, for her trade is so
entirely dependent on the will of the above nobleman, whose domineer-
ing character is well known, that unless we had the protection of the
ballot, it would be vain to contend against his power. But we are
happy to be able to say, that resistance has been successfully offered to
this haughty aristocrat, and that he has been prevented from forcing
his honourable little brother upon the representation. A re-inforcement
of Conservatives, who, having nothing to º: for from LoRD BRIGHT,
had nothingtofear from him, came up, and MR. Heywoop avenged his
own wrongs and those of the party by leading away the ultra-contingent,
where it was of no use in the battle, MR. JAMEs, areasonable Liberal,
won the seat, and we have JAcoBus instead of Jacob. So my LoRD
BRight may stalk up and down his ancestral halls, wishing that the
5. old times had come back, and there were pit and gallows for the
emocratic recalcitrants.
FASHIONABLE FRIPPERY.
WF learn from the best writers upon that exciting theme, The
Fashions, that straw and steel are now considered the proper things
wherewith to decorate young ladies—and doubtless old ones too, if they
require decoration. The fashion is to wear the straw scattered upon
the skirt, and the steel made into bracelets, as well as into beads and
bangles and * for the headdress, fadies who would dress in
what is deemed the proper, style, must have their wrists adorned like
those of captured pickpockets, and must appear in the costume of
Ophelia in her mad scene, plus a pair of disjoined handcuffs. . A girl
who has the folly to be guided by Le Follet, but is obliged to study some
economy in dress, should pull her strawbonnets to bits, and sew the
pieces on her skirt, and should ornament her hair with scraps of the
steel hoops discarded from her petticoats. Were a philosopher to intro-
duce a magnet at a party, half the ladies in the room would be resist-
lessly attracted to it. Away would go their head-gear and stick tight to
the loadstone; and down would come their backhair, all the pins being
drawn out of it. What a scene this would be for afarce or a burlesque.
We advise, our comic playwrights directly to seize hold of it. By the
bye, if for burlesquing they want to find an opera in which they might
most fitly introduce this magnet scene, they had better try their wits
upon The Rose ºf Cast Steel.

INCOME-TAX SUFFRAGE.
It is strange that no candidate has as yet gone to the hustings with
the cry of, “The Income-Tax for Ever!” It would be a capital cry; in
the first place, because it is so true, expressing, as it does, the evident
truth that the Income-Tax is destined to have no end. In the next
place, if the candidate cried, “The Income-Tax for Ever!” the multi-
tude would be certain to respond, “Hooray!” because the multitude
does not pay the Income-Tax. The multitude, therefore, will cry not
merely, “Hooray !” but, “Hip, hip, hip, hooray!” ...The majority of
those electors even who do pay. Income-Tax, will shout simply,
“Hooray!” For the Income Tax is the fairest of taxes to persons of
safe incomes; and, although unsafe incomes are common, forethought
is scarce. Few are they who, being in the receipt of any income at all,
consider otherwise than that their incomes are going to last for ever,
and most º º their Income-Tax under Schedule D. if not with.
out grumbling, still without thinking any more than they think when
they set up a carriage, or take a wife in these days of excess in female
apparel. Hang the few -
Then the Income-Tax has now been reduced by so much that it is no
longer a glaring confiscation, but resembles gas that has been turned
down to a glimmer, ready to be turned up again into a blaze immediately,
as occasion may require. Even the rare thinkers who think what is to
become of them when the personal earnings constituting their sole
incomes cease, and who feel it as a confiscation especially hard to them-
selves, will be ready at least to groan, “The Income-Tax for Ever!”
Since, then, the Income-Tax is to be eternal, make the best of it.
Make it the basis of the Elective Franchise.
Give everybody, who pays Income-Tax a vote, and let nobody else
vote. But taxation without . is tyranny. Are the
working classes, whose gin and tobacco are taxed, but who are exempt
from Income-Tax, to have no vote at all? By no means. Give a vote
to every one who chooses to demand, to pay an Income-Tax on the
amount of his income, whatever it may be.

If taxation without representation is tyranny, representation without
taxation will come to the same thing. If the classes who pay no
Income-Tax are to vote the supplies, there is some fear that the Income-
Taxpayers will very soon have to find all the money that the Govern-
ment may require for the national expenses, and, for example, for the
pursuit of a spirited foreign policy. Income-Tax Suffrage obviates this
danger, and meets every difficulty of Parliamentary Reform.
It was reserved for Punch to point out the one only satisfactory and
sufficient foundation for a perfect Reform Bill. How beautiful, how

33
I,ONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GUIDE TO BRADSHAW.
PREFACE.
ELDoM, if ever, has the gigantic
intellect of man been employed
upon a work of greater utility,
or upon one of such special
application and general com-
prehensiveness, as in the pro-
jection, completion, publica-
tion, and sustention of the
now familiar Bradshaw. Few
literary efforts, however high
their aim either in the ethereal
regions of Art, or the sublime
paths of Philosophy, have ever
achieved so much for the
cause of Progress as has the
Book of BRADshAw.
And yet, such is the original
imperfection inherent in even
the most carefully elaborated
human scheme, the writings
of BRADSHAw, it is objected,
contain so many difficulties,
real or apparent, so many con-
tradictions, so much error,
mingled, it is allowed, with a
certain amount of truth, as to
º destroy its character
or credibility, and so far to
- injure its usefulness for guid-
ance, as to render, it unworthy of that implicit reliance which most
minds would he whiling to place in the dicta of an acknowledged supe:
rior and accredited teacher. In answer, we contend that the so-called
difficulties are far less real than apparent, and that the honest student,
who applies himself heart, and soul to the work, will encounter no
reater obstacles, than such as were surmounted by CHAMPoiſſion,
uring his laborious researches into the mysteries of the Egyptian
hieroglyphics.
The plain title of the Book carries with it the overwhelming grandeur
of simplicity. Who is there but can without effort pronounce it What
being so dull as not to respond interiorly to its utterance?.. BRADshaw!
Let us repeat it mildly, softly, soothingly—BRADsbAw Let us be
hard and fierce in our tone, as announcing an authority from whose
decision there lies no appeal—BRADSHAw! Let us pronounce his name
in the broken accents of despair—the despair of one who has no time to
lose, and to whom every minute is of the last importance—let us, half
weeping, say, BRAD:AD-shaw. . Let us lispingly allude to him amon
the false smiles, false teeth, false hair, and false hearts of the ...i
saloon, as Bw ADTHAw! Mentioned where you will, and how you will,
there is a strange charm in the name that rivets the attention, even
though it fail to reach the understandings, of all hearers.
Of the genuineness of BRADSHAw there may, and indeed must, always
exist most reasonable doubts. The question of its authenticity has been
plexing, arrangements an
raised by its supposed difficulties, and these it shall be alike our duty
and our pleasure to explain.
. Once let a doubt of BRADSHAw be confirmed and established, and
in whom, in what, shall we put our confidence?
Once let the discovery be made that in the statements contained in
BRADshaw no trust can be reposed, and what abiding happiness will
remain to us in life? To and fro shall we be drifting, from one Station
to another, from one informant to another, now clinging to this opinion
now holding on by that, at one time late for an early train, at another
early for a late, dependent upon ignorant officials, at the mercy of
grasping porters, equally uncertain as to the moment for entering or
leaving a compartment, we, with mental powers weakened, .
utterly overthrown, and physical capacities prematurely, decayed, shall
ultimately find ourselves harmlessly playing at Steam-Engines on the
green sward of Colney Hatch, or composing an Oratorio out of old
Great Western time-tables while wandering in the cloisters of the
secluded Hanwell.
Quo Tendumus * To this, an admission of the existence of difficulties,
a staunch denial of their insuperability, and an acknowledgment of the
great need of a competent expositor. In this character we come forward
as the champion of #. and Guide to the Guide.
CHAPTER I.
Qf the Genuineness of BRADSHAw—Objections answered—His wit, humour,
satire–Our Line.
CoNCERNING the *...* of BRADsh Aw, it seems to us no reasonable
doubt can be entertained. It is as evidently to our minds the compila-
tion of several hands, as afe the Iliad and Odyssey of HomeR.
We attribute no weight whatever to this objection, as ºld. the
trustworthy character of the information contained in the book. For,
to say, that a gertain, book was written by ºne BRApsHAW, is no more
than to say St. Paul's was built by SIR CHRISTopher WREN, who, it
may be fairly supposed, never touched so much as a stock or stone in a
practical way during the rearing of the ecclesiastical edifice :-
“Sir Christopher WREN
Directed his men,”
and no more nor less than this fell to the lot of BRADSHAw.
That the hand which had guided the work to its completion, should
have given the few finishing touches required, is far from improbable,
and some of the index jº. shunting lines, and amusing, though per-
notices, are, without doubt, from the facile
No. 1255,

-
pen of BRADshaw himself, when, in the quiet winter evenings, he could,
over the social glass, allow his freakish fancy to rove freely through the
mazy labyrinths of his favourite book, lightening, beautifying, and
embellishing its pages with a graceful humour all his own.
The adoption of this hypothesis will at once account, for the occa-
sional . digressions, and affected jerkiness of style, that, while
thoroughly original, both in conception and execution, strongly remind
us of ; łºś. of STERNE. Thus, for instance, when a train to
Brighton is announced as leaving London, at 9 A.M., you may trace it
carefully down to its sixth Station, and then it is lost in space, or
stopped by a pointing finger, or becomes inextricably mixed, up with
some train going in a totally opposite direction, or it capriciously breaks
off without any reason whatever, and never, reaches. Brighton at all,
or it takes us onwards towards a castle in the air, and suddenly
(Grand Thought % vanishes among the Stars! º -
Now, this was BRApsHAw's peculiar vein of humour. We can see
the mischievous twinkle of his eye, as his strong active imagination fully
anticipated the amusing perplexities into which the erasure, made by
his pen, would cast some thousands of his readers, and how heartily,
as one of themselves, he sympathised with merriment which the dis.
covery of his innocent jest would cause among them, when they entered
into and appreciated the true spirit of his sly, quiet fun.
Let this much, as stated above, be on
hands conceded to BRAD-
If, then, BRADSHAw created the difficulties of which we complain,
why did he not take upon himself their solution?
The question might just as well be asked why BRADSHAw ever wrote
any. º: at all? or why he adhered to any precise method in com-
posing 1
We believe his motives to have been of the highest and purest, not to
say most disinterested kind.
But he has provided a "Key" to every volume, and in it has drawn
largely upon his fund of quiet humour, and has | satirised the
affected weakness of those, whose pretended necessity laid so great a
tax upon his time and patience.
We propose, first of all, to deal with the Title-page and Key, wherein
will be found specimens of Bºoshaw's satiric mood.
.Then, we will take at hap-hazard a page, or, so to speak, a leaf out of
his book, in order to present the reader with BRADshaw in his simply
humorous phase.
From time to time we shall be open to any suggestions from esteemed
correspondents, and shall answer them or not as we feel inclined.
Having thus thoroughly imbued ourselves with our Author's spirit,
we will attempt, in all humility, and with a sense of our utter unworthi.
ness for the task, to extract from his teaching short practical maxims,
and brief instructions for the traveller's ordinary guidance. Besides
this, we shall, in the true mind of the Author, give funny things, jokes,
&c.; for every traveller, suitable to different lines.
We will then develope his hints, and having thus filled up what was
wanting in BRADSHAw, shall º our Complements to the reader.
From the general tenor of his writing, we shall in due course proceed
to deduce particular rules of conduct, applicable to the various situa-
tions or Stations wherein the traveller may find himself placed.
In fine, we will, endeavour to confute the superficial objectors by
bringing to light the hidden treasures of BRADshaw, and, by an easy
method, make patent to all, what had hitherto seemed to wear the veil
of mysterious obscurity.

A FREE AND INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE,
The following answer to a requisition on the part of certain electors
to become a candidate for the representation of Blankshire was returned
by a straightforward country squire;—
GENTLEMEN,
have received your solicitation to undertake the office of
*...* you in Parliament.
f I were simply to consider my own inclinations, I should refuse to
accept the onerous employment with which you desire to saddle me.
As the proprietor of a large tract of land in your county, I have more
than enough to do to mind my own business, without troubling myself
with yours, or that of the nation. -
I delight in the recreation of fishing; and the Parliamentary Session
exactly coincides with the trout season. I am addicted to literary and
scientific pursuits, which attendance in Parliament will oblige me to
intermit for nearly six months in the year.
The labour of serving on Committees would be so irksome to me as
to amount nearly to an infliction equal to penal servitude.
My health would be impaired, and my days might be shortened, by
the late hours which the House of Commons is in the habit of keeping.
It is true that a Parliamentary life is not incompatible with longevity,
as in the case of Lord PALMERSTON, but LoRD PALMERSTON likes that
sort of life, and I hate it. -
Ilowever, I do not feel justified in absolutely declining a public duty
such as men in my position are, as far as their circumstances go, of all
men the fittest to discharge. But if you can think of anybody else
whose political abilities are greater than mine; whose information,
eloquence, and argumentative powers, exceed my own; and who is as
well off as I am, I hope you will ask him to become your representative
in preference to me. - -
erewith I send you a statement of my political opinions, which you
can print and distribute if you like to do so at your own expense.
expect that, if you insist on returning me, R}. will defray all the costs
of my election yourselves; for if I am rich, I have not more money than
I know what to do with, and it seems to me monstrously absurd that a
man should pay his fellow-citizens for leave to do them the favour of
serving them in the capacity of a Member of Parliament. Besides, the
expenses of my election, if borne by myself, might amount to more than
even I could afford singly; whereas your respective contributions to
them would not at all inconvenience each of you. Moreover, if you
take them .# upon yourselves, they will be sure to be very small.
Hoping you will manage to find some one who is better qualified and
more anxious than the undersigned to fill the seat which you invite
him to occupy, I am, gentlemen,
Your obedient Servant to command,
Sturdy Hall, July, 1865. John BLUNT.
LADIES AND THEIR LONG TAILS.
CRINoLINE at length is going out, thank goodness! but long, trailing
dresses are coming in, thank badness In matters of costume, lovely
woman rarely ceases to make herself a nuisance; and the length of her
skirt now is almost as annoying as, a while ago, its width was. Robes
à queue they call these draggling dresses; but it is not at Kew merely
that people are tormented by them. Everywhere you walk, your foot-
steps are impeded by the ladies, who, in Pope's phrase, drag their
slow, length along” the pathway just in front of you, “Will anybody
tread upon the tail of my petticoat P” This seems to be the general
invitation they now give. "Sad enemies to progress they are, in their
long dresses: and a Reform, Bill should be passed to make them hold
their tails up. Ladies should be taught to mind their p’s and queues;
and every policeman should be armed with a big pair of garden shears
or tailors' scissors, wherewith to cut away the skirts which he sees
trailing on the pavement.
Young ladies, as a rule, we will allow, are little ducks; but by wearing
such long tails they make great geese of themselves. Clearly something
must be done to shorten their appendages, if it be only on account of
the safety of the public. . We often see a child tripped up by a long
dress, and falling on what Jaques calls its “innocent nose’’ thereby.
If the trains be worn much longer, there is no telling what miss-haps
and masterhaps may be occasioned by them. ... Wellnigh as many acci-
dents will be met with by these trains as by those upon our railways,
and we really hardly know which of the two may prove more dangerous.
For ourselves, having the welfare of our little ones at heart, we always
try to tread upon as many dresses as we can, and to do them all the
º that hobnailed boots can perpetrate. If every father of a family
would sternly do the same, the fashion of long dresses would have a
short existence.
WHAT is the difference between the punctual arrival of a train, and a
collision? The former is quite an accident; the latter isn’t

“We fell in with another ship near the Land's End. I wished that we had let her alone,
for we are quite low enough in the water, and don't want any more shaking, but the Captain
insisted, upon hooking her on to us, and so we are pulling her along., She is called the Garo-
line, and she has got a thin end of cable, to be stuck into Valentia, and tied to our rope. I have
endeavoured to ascertain the necessity for this clumsy contrivance, and why our own end could
not have been fastened. My Irish friend says that it would have been as much as the QUEEN's
crown is worth to sanction such a thing, that the awful weight of our cable would have
broken away a huge cantle of Ireland, and that the Prerogative would not stretch to alienation
of territory. This seems a Constitutional reason. I am still unwell.” “Saturd

“A little better. My friend, says that this is on account of the galyanig action, being

but I must correct a statement I made in a former despatch., That Fº never killed at all:
it was a practical joke of our (Imust still say) º cook, who slipped him down a hole,
and uncovered the chops and sausages I found
so good. We are all liable to be deceived
but they will not take me in again. We had
a thunderstorm last night, and I am informed
that the electricians hung one end of the cable
out, and put the other into the sea, and that
the lightning illuminated it to the bottom,
clearly showing the wreck of the Royal George,
and killing thousands of fish. We certainly
had a very abundant fish dinner to-day.”

The beautiful remark, ‘He who goes to sea
without a cork jacket, is like unto the butler

impressive. I hope, also, that many were
touched to the heart by the reminder, “If thou

HINT TO CROQUET PLAYERS.
WOULD NOT THE ALPINE MILKING-STOOL, IMPORTED FROM GRINDENWALD, BE A VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO THE CROQUET-GROUND
DURING THIS FATIGUING WEATHER 2
OXFORD UNIVERSITY ELECTION.
Oxford's loss is England's gain.
We congratulate the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchEQUER and the country;
He can now throw away the pole, and with unfaltering steps proceed
on the path staked out for him. There was a nonconformity between
MR. GLADSTONE and the old “Masters,” which no growth of intelli-
gence in the minds of the country clergy and county squires, no
softening of the bigotry of the cloister and the common room could
ever have abolished. He had outgrown the suit of Oxford Mixture,
which will exactly fit MR. GATHoRNE HARDy.
The future First Minister of England would never have been com-
fortable with Heads of Houses looking over his shoulder, guiding his
hand, and cramping it. They will have a more submissive pupil in MR.
GATHORNE HARDy, a good plodding boy, who will never “greatly
daring” shine.
The Oxford Majority (non-resident) have completed an exchange—
MR. GLADSTONE for an Under Secretary in Lord DERBY's Govern.
ment, an official who, when a Tory Cabinet is again, in the chambers of
Downing Street—the date is not yet fixed—will probably be promoted,
say, to the Duchy of Lancaster.
They are now represented by two Members of that * which is as
averse to change as ladies who keep stalls at a bazaar, and from whom
it is wrung as money is wrung from a miser. They wanted some one
who was sound and safe, and they have got MR. GAThorn E HARDy
safe and sound. There was a sickly whisper that the statesman who
honoured them by being one of their Burgesses, was disposed to join
the Manchester “Express,” so they looked out for a slow “Parlia-
mentary,” and found what they required in MR. GATHORNE HARDY.
What did they care for peace, plenty, and prosperity, as the signs of
a good Government, the honours of a first-class administration? They
lusted after a Member who would fight for Tests and haggle over
Rates, who would mount the barricades against Dissenters, and insist
on the retention of rotten oaths, and the desire of their eyes is gratified
in MR. GATHoRNE HARLY. Alma Mater longed for a babe who would
not want shortening, and MR. GATHORNE HARDY was willing to wear

long clothes, and never to pout at the political pap provided by his
coddles. The Oxford go-cart was large enough for him: all the amuse-
ment he sighed for was to dance the College hornpipe—in ſetters. , So
- º name is taken off the books, and HARDy's recorded in
its stead.
Words cannot express a tithe of the delight felt by the overpaid and
underworked country Rectors at the result of the struggle—the busy
F. who, in consideration of eight hundred a year, an excellent
ouse, and a walled garden, consent to supply the spiritual wants of
a few farmers and cottagers, a fair proportion of whom prefer the
stimulant of the ehapel to the sedative of the church. The port
that night had a fine old Tory smack about it. The girls went to the
Archery Ball prouder of Papa than ever; and AUGUSTUs began at once
to prepare the speech he is to make after the Vacation at the Union, in
support of a motion which declares that the whole policy of this country;
since the death of LoRD ELDON, has been dangerous, delusive, and
democratic.
Choice distinction' to be caressed by the Standard and hugged by
the Herald; to be thanked and congratulated by the President of
St. John's (“the WYNTER of our discontent”) and other obstructive
Heads—(the innocent should be told that the Head of a House is
not invariably its Brain); to have assisted at the sacrifice of such a
noble victim; to have given a turn to the wheel out of which there
has rolled such a splendid prize - - -
The wisdom of the votes of the Oxford Majority, (non-resident)
may be doubted. The assault on Jowett was suicidal; the dismissal
of GLADston E is felo-de-se. -
If the Oxford opposition have to pay heavy damages in the shape of a
thorough reform and a complete purification of the University, here-
after they may perhaps regret their torture of the Professor of Greek,
and their abandonment of the CHANCELLOR of The Excheques. If
they expect to stop the political circulation, they must, try a different
nostrum—pea-shooters are of no use against granite walls. Growth of
rational opinion, in their minds is typified in the natural world by the
moss and the lichen, or by the aloe that flowers once in a hundred
years.
But the Oxford Majerity deserve credit for one Christian virtue—

much chance of governing the country for long together as the Pope has
of saying mass in St. Paul's.
THERE AND BACK FOR THREE-AND-SIX.
A PRIVATE EXCURSION.
IT cost more than three-and-six did my Excursion to Fort Shingles.
Where is it? On the East Coast. You go and see. I’ll tell you how
I enjoyed myself. Fort Shingles is quite out of the way: No one goes
there except some country people in September: that’s why I went
the other day, from Saturday to Monday, to freshºn myself, up, as
.# one said f wanted it, and every one was right. I did, and I
Went.
The first observation I made was, that the Shingleites were a primitive
º: as regarded bed-time, or an economical people in the matter of
candles, as, though it was barely ten o'clock, the inn was closed, and
not a light was to be seen anywhere. -
“Capitall" thought I to myself. “Here I shall be undisturbed.”
Up from below came the pleasant roar of the waves tumbling over and
over one another, as if they had determined to make a night of it under
the yery nose of the placid oldest male inhabitant of the moon.
My driver had been ringing the bell for about five minutes.
“Sim stannin stunty,” said the native.
Not knowing what he meant, I smiled, nodded, and suggested that |d
he’d better ring again.
“Stanning stunty he is,” repeated the driver. -
I ºf. he meant that t # were asleep. Further acquaintance
with the language of the County leads me to suppose that the landlord
was “amazing obstinate,” because he wouldn't open the door.
An ostler came at last. After some conversation, in which, from
what I could gather from the tones and sounds, the ostler abused the
driver, and the driver the ostler, I interfered with an inquiry as to
whether I could have a bed.
On this the ostler rang a bell, and in another five minutes a chamber-
maid appeared, who came down-stairs Hºf This made the ostler
yawn, then the driver yawned, and finally I yawned, and as we all
apparently took our time from the maid as long as she stood there; and
yawned, we kept it up with all the faults of mere imitation. But I
never saw such mouths'
In revenge for waking them T. I was shown into the “only room
unoccupied, Sir.” . It wasn't, I know that now, Could I get any
:*:::: No, she didn't think I could; and we both yawned. A glass
of ale and a biscuit? No, she said, yawning worse than ever: she was
certain I couldn't get that...The bar was shut up; and wº both yawned
again. Couldn’t I get anything? No, nothing. “If I’d come,” she
explained, “in the afternoon, why——” What would have happened
then I don't know, as a yawn stopped her, and carried her out of the
room. An attempt on my part to call her back, and say what time. I
wished to be called, was rendered utterly abortive by such a fearful
º that it suddenly occurred to me that my mouth was becoming as
ig as theirs, and that I myself was (Darwinianly) developing into a
Shingleite. So I got into bed.
Hunger is not only a sharp thorn, but an early caller. At four o'clock
I was awake. Gray morning. I heard the sea, and somebody snoring.
Ah! My window should be opened, and luxury of luxuries to a worn,
smoked Londoner, I would lie in bed, and lazily looking at the glorious
ocean, would allow my mind to expand, and bathe myself in the sweet
breezes that float over the ever fresh, the ever free. (I never heard, by
the way, such extraordinary snoring. -
To accomplish my wishes, it became necessary to pull up my blind.
I jumped out of bed. (I stop for a second to wonder where that snoring
comes from.) Now, now, Thalatta! Thalatta / as the Greeks said (for
I was in high spirits, and hadn't quoted Greek for an age), now for it—-
where’s the cord?—oh, here's 1. cord—and now—up goes the blind
stiffly, and this is what I saw : the dead wall of a red brick coach-house
and a pig-stye, occupied by one Sow, fast asleep.
The snoring was instantly accounted for. Was it for this that I had
left * at four o'clock, A.M. f. I broke the string in pulling down
the blind. In my miserable disappointment, I said, “Awoke by cold
pig in the morning,” and, having sheered at my own joke, returned to
my bed. No one would be . till six, I supposed. It was now a

ounties Railway Guide. hile pondering over the outside e
(yellow cover), I fell asleep, and was awoke at 6:30 by somebody else's
boots being brought into my room.
From that moment I commenced getting up. At half-past seven I
ordered breakfast. The Chambermaid (outside, the door) asked, in a
faint voice, “What I would take P” I, not being prepared for this
poser, answered by asking, “What there was f* She would ask. While
*-
she was absent on her mission, I employed myself in considering what
I should have when she came back. Chicken? Yes. Chicken I
settled with myself, and an egg, or an omelette—yes, chicken grilled, or
mackerel broiled * That was the thing—mackerel broiled, and an
omelette | There we were. The Chambermaid doesn't answer my bell
when I ring for her, but somebody else, represented by another faint
voice outside, my door, does. “What do f want?” “Oh!” I say,
rather put out by having to go back to the commencement, “I rang for
breakfast.'...“Had I ordered, it "...was the next question., I con-
sidered., “No, I had not: at least, I had rung for the Chambermaid,
and she had—” Getting confused at this point, I wound up with,
as if by inspiration, “Qrder some eggs, please, and tea.” The voice
retired. I felt that this was not the breakfast I had intended, but I
was scarcely prepared, on going into the Parlour, that did duty for a
Coffee-room, to find no breakfast at all... I rang. “What did I want?
Had I ordered it?” Ordered Hadn't I ordered eggs and tea? The
tea was ready—there were no eggs. No eggs | And this is the

Somehow or another, probably through being bothered by such an
absurd question about breakfast, I can’t think of any answer except
“Coffee.” Suddenly rousing myself, I say, “Bread, of course,”—an
as an after-thought, “Butter.”
When she has gone out of the room, Ham flashes across my mind. I
ring boldly, and ask what she has to say to Ham. Broiled Ham,” Yes,
that 's it. And there’s a cold pie. Oh! pie, by all means; and, while
that’s preparing, I’ll go out and bathe.
I may go out, but I mayn't bathe. The Machine ain't down on
Sunday. "I can bathe without a Machine. The Landlady, who is
passing through the passage, hears this remark, and stops to say it’s
angerous.
“Why?” I ask. ... “I can swim.”
“It’s not swimming,” she returns: “it’s the boys.”
I fancied she meant buoys, and said they could be avoided.
“The boys that drives donkeys in the season, They ’ve got nothing
to do, the º: limbs' " she explains. “They think it’s a game running
off with clothes they see lying on the shore.”
“A game ! Do they P. Oh, thank you! Then I shall not bathe.”
Breakfast ! Excellent ham!, Beautiful pie Lovely day ! View of
the sea from parlour charming ! I will smoke a cigar outside. This is

(To be continued.)
LINES TO A YOUNG LADY OF FASHION.
I Love thee for thy chignon, for the boss of purchased hair,
Which thou hast on thine occiput the charming taste to wear.
Oh, what a grace that ornament unto thy poll doth lend,
Wound on what seems a curtain-rod with knobs at either end
I love thee for the roses, purchased too, thy cheeks that deck,
The lilies likewise that adorn thy pearly-powdered neck,
And all that sweet “illusion’’ that, o'er thy features spread,
Improves the poor reality of Nature's white and red.
I love thee for the muslin and the gauze about thee bound,
Like endive that in salad doth a lobster's tail surround,
And oh! I love thee for the boots thine ankles that protect,
So proper to the manly style young ladies now affect.
I love thee for thy figure not; there may, for aught I see
The clothes-frame of a draper's shop inside ºil that dress be.
I do not love thee for thy face, do but thy surface know,
The picture 'tis I value, not the canvas hid below.
I love thee for thine emptiness, thy vanity, and pride;
But, oh! too lovely, far too dear, art thou to be my bride.
Šo dear a wife as thou wouldst prove, to marry thce, alas !
How very rich I ought to be, and should be—what an ass!
Indignation.
“CoRPORAL punishment, in the aristocratic schools?” said. LoRD
BRIGHT. “Don’t tell me that the democratic schools are not just as
brutal. There’s the Manchester School. I myself had the severest
licking there I ever had in my life, and my young brother, Jacob, whom
I sent there this half, with orders that he was not to be touched, has
not only been soundly beaten, but expelled into the bargain. By
BARCLAY's Apology, I’ll—I’ll—well, we shall see.”. And his Lordship
went away, meditating a Public Schools Reform Bill.
SPORTING INFORMATION.
The Lyndhurst Races were run the other day. The sport was

AMENDS TO SCOTLAND.
THAT gallant and emergetic Volunteer, LoRD ELCHO, had
to rush from Wimbledon to defend a Scotch seat, to
which, in the circumstances, Scotsmen might have elected
him without taking him away from the scene of his services
to the national cause. But we can º regret the inci-
dent, as it enabled the Volunteer to display his exceeding
self-possession and good temper. To appreciate these,
people should know.what a low Scotch mob is... It is
perhaps the most ill-conditioned and spiteful gathering
in the world. It is too stupid to understand fun, but, on
the other hand, Calvinistic associations have made it familiar
with the most awful denunciations, and these are poured
out, in sulphureous gales. When not under the eye of
authority, it resorts to savage force. With such a mob
had Lord Elcho to contend. It yelled, howled, anathe-
matised, and refused to hear him returnithanks to the
respectable electors who had placed him at the head of
the poll. But he stood firm, as a rifleman should stand,
laughed when the assembly was most brutal, asked whether
he should smoke or speak, declaring that he was quite
ready to do either, according to the taste of the meeting,
and when he had done, he good-humouredly offered the
mob the pipe of peace in the shape of the contents of his
cigar-case, But there is none of the easily conciliated
character of an English crowd about a Scotch mob, and
while º up and pocketing the costly tobacco, they
cried that they were insulted, and one cigar (it must have
been a *: one), was actually hurled back at the
donor, with language hot enough to light it. But our
Volunteer only laughed, and came back to Wimbledon.
Mr. Punch notices the business, to make up to Scotland
for her losing, by a neck only—or rather by a nostril—the
International Shield.
Oxford's last Triumph.
PRoup Oxford claims another prize,
And cheers salute her hardy crew,

Her laurels look so much like rue.
How party zeal 'gainst judgment pulls
Leaving her adversary aft,
With strength of SAMson in her sculls,
And woman's weakness in her craft.
CONSERVATIVE WEAL CUTLETS.
MR. Du WALKING Stick—no no, MR. DU CANE, said some .#
amusing things the other day at Braintree, to the electors of Nort
Essex. In the first place, after having made some observations of no
consequence, he remarked, with reason enough that:—
“Any one who said he was ready to support LoRD PALMERSTON must be prepared
to support MR. GLADSTONE also.”
And then he proceeded to characterise the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER as:-
“MR. GLADstone, the future destroyer of the Irish Church, the future proposer
of universal suffrage, and the future introducer of Republicanism. (Cheers, Oh! Oh 1
and uproar.)”
... MR. Du CANE's audience took all this seriously. He should repeat
it at his Club, where of course it would create a good laugh.
The honourable and facetious gentleman continued :-
“When MR. GLADstone first came into office, six years since, he put on a most
enormous mass of taxation, which he had been for years giving back to the country
in little driblets.”
That is to say, MR. GLADSTONE had to pay the bills incurred by his
redecessors, the Conservatives, put on taxes to pay the bills, and,
laving paid them, proceeded as fast, as he could to reduce taxation.
This is a droll way of disparaging a political opponent's finance.
Having repeated in detail the charge a inst the CHANCELLOR OF
The ExchequeR, which he had stated as above in general terms, MR.
DU CANE went on to say:-
“A word about the manly, spirited foreign policy of the Government. When
LoRD DERby left office the policy of England was respected in every European
Cabinet, and the name of England was honoured on the Continent. But now that
we had betrayed Poland and ruined Denmark, the foreign policy of England was
laughed at, and treated with scorn in every European Cabinet, ay, and not merely
in every European Cabinet, but among those semi-barbarous nations which Lord
PALMERston delighted in worrying.”
According to MR. Du CANE, a man who, being on one side of a river,
which he cannot cross, and seeing a gang of ruffians robbing and
murdering a traveller, contents himself with crying, “Thieves!” and
“Murder!” as loud as he can bawl, betrays and ruins the traveller.
And two opposite lines of policy, pursued towards foreign nations, have
had the same result, that of being laughed at; as the .. quota-
tion will probably be, and that which follows actually was even by those
who heard it:—
“Thus, the Maories of New Zealand murdered our missionaries and settler, the
KING of AshANTEE laughed at our soldiers, and the KING OF ABYssINIA'imprisoned
our consul, and he (MR. DU CANE) believed that ho had long since eaten him at a
State banquet. (Laughter.)"
Now they who were the hearers of MR. DU CANE are themselves a
tribe of the natives of England vulgarly denominated Essex calves.
Punch does not call them so, oh no ! Punch never calls anybody oppro-
brious names. The free and independent electors of North Essex, and
South Essex too, take Punch in, and he would not say anything dis-
respectful about them for the world. But what does MR. DU CANE
take them for, if not for calves, and bull-calves of the most bovine
intellect? What should a North Essex elector say to blatant MR. DU
CANE 2 Should he not say to him, “You’re another?” Should he
not tell MR, Du CANE that if the KING of ABYss!NIA were to eat
him, the Majesty of Abyssinia would dine on undeniable veal?
ELECTION RIGHTS AND WHONGS.
It is right to leave no stone unturned to help your friends, but wrong
to pull up the pavement and pelt your opponents.
t is right to take pains, but wrong to *. windows.
It is right (if you like them) to be for sweeping measures, but wrong
to throw soot at those who condemn them. At all events, if you must
blacken a man's shirt-front, don't blacken his character, especially
behind his back.
Wolleys of applause are right, volleys of stones wrong. ..
It is right to lay down the law, but wrong to floor the police. .
It is not right to bring forward “a regular stick,” but decidedly
wrong to bring out a reg bludgeon.

THE NEW BRIDGE.
HANKs, my LoRD MAYOR,”
you are very good, said Mr.
Punch, “but the fact is that
I am so busy about this
General Election, that I
must decline all invitations.
I am sure you can lay your
first stone without me.”
“Mechanically, yes,” said
the Mayor; “but morally,
mo.”
“Indeed!” replied Mr.
Punch. “Well, I should be
sorry if the Mayor and Cor-
poration did, anything im-
moral. I will come to your
coſter-dam. But I am bo-
thered. Dizzy perplexes me.
Day after day the Liberal
majority ſº larger and
larger, and he keeps on de-
claring that this is exactly
what he wants, in order to
put DERBy and himself into
office. This Asian Mystery
is too much for me.”
“Politics are an abstruse
science,” said the Mayor,
prudently.
“Politics be—coffer-dam-
med,” said, Mr. Punch,
smiling. “I am speaking
of Divisions. What does he
mean by saying that a loss
of twenty votes increases the
Conservative strength P. I
have it. He means that
every Tory Member is a man beside himself, and counts two.” -
“I dare, say he does,” said LoRD MAYOR STORMEs HALE. He is
a very good arithmetician. “But the state coach is at the door.”
* I prefer walking,” said Mr. Punch. “Let my people see me.” .
The LoRD MAYor, and the LoRD PUNCH descended into Bride
Court, and were speedily at the foot of the temporary bridge, which
the latter nobleman considers a greater triumph of ingenuity than any
architectural affair could be. Let posterity know that, like MR. GLAD-
stone, Member for South Lancashire, a passenger saw three courses
open to him, one straight and level, and one on either hand, high up in
air. To-day all were kept rigorously clear, and the solitude in, the
midst of the myriads was sensational, and affecting. Mr. Punch yielded
to the sentimental influence of the scene.
“I’ll race your Lordship to the Dam—you take one side and I the
other. Run you for a pint and a screw.”
“I don’t smoke,” said the Lord MAYOR. -
“, Well, you are quite right,” said Mr. Punch. “It interferes with
the digestion, is unpleasant to the ladies, debilitates the faculties, spoils
your taste for wine, and costs an awful deal of money. I shall give it
up,” he added, producing an embroidered cigar-case, and lighting a huge
weed, slightly larger than a Swell's umbrella. - -
They mounted the ascent, and gazed upon the Railway Bridge on their
left, and the snaggy ruins of MYLNE's structure on their º
“Have you pens, ink, paper, a penny patent blotter, a folding-knife
and the other essentials for writing, anywhere about you, my Lord?”
said Mr. Punch, pausing in the middle of the bridge.
“I fear not,” said the Lord MAYOR.
“I regret it,” said Mr. Punch, as I wished to dictate to you a sonnet
which would have totally eclipsed Wordsworth's on Westminster
Bridge. But let it pass—let it pass. My LoRD MAYOR, this is an
occasion for profound thought and meditation.”
“Only,” suggested the fond MAYor, “that we are waited for in
the bed of the river.”
“Let us be waited for—let them wait—let them be waiters,” said
Mr. Punch, slowly and abstractedly.
“As a beam o'er the face of the waiters may glow,
While the landlord sits scowling and cheating below,
So the face may be tinged with a warm sunny smile,
While each dish is distasteful, along of your bile.”
“Such thoughts will rise,” pursued the poet, “though all the earth
conceal them from men's eyes. Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure
brow: Youth at the helm, and Pleasure at the prow. Behold St.
Paul’s, nor deem thy, time misspent: look further, and behold the
Monument. Far to the west, see the Victoria Tower: likewise the
giant Clock that tells the hour. Those cloud-capt towers and gorgeous

It is impossible to say how long the bard might have continued to
pour forth his tide of song, but at this moment a hideous shriek from
the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, and a rush of one of their
trains along the iron way, made him inaudible. Somewhat angrily, he
seized the LoRD MAYoR's arm, and hurried with him to the Southwark
end of the bridge, across the road, and into the entrance to the Great
Dam, . There they were most politely received by blue-gowned
Municipals.
“How do you do, MR. BENNETT, and what’s o'clock?” said Mr.
Punch, affably, to the celebrated horologer.
“Your own time, which is always the right time, Sir,” said M.R.
BENNETT, with equal politeness.
- º dived, Mr. Punch and his conductor, like DANTE and VIRGIL,
into the shades, and after descending about seven hundred feet, or
more, and beholding nothing but vast beams, crossing one another, and
covered with pink calico, they suddenly came upon a sort of pic-nic
party at the bottom of the river. Elegantly-attired ladies sat smiling,
and partaking of champagne and confectionery which were being handed
about by the Fathers of the City., In, the centre was a platform, with
two radiant chairs, much gilt, and with real glass knobs between the
brasswork. In front hung a huge stone, suspended by a chain over a
sort of abyss, made cheerful with more pink calico. There was great
owling and shouting up above in the air, and these sounds proceeded
rom persons in the upper galleries, who could neither see, nor hear, nor
get anything to drink, and who were unreasonably angry. However,
some Common Council-men handed them º some wine cards on the
end of wands (just as you feed the bears in the Zoological pit), and the
growling ceased.
“The LADY MAYOREss will take one of those chairs, and you, Mr.
Punch, the other,” said the LORD MAYoR.
Mr. Punch made one of his own exquisite bows to Miss HALE, who
#. took the right hand seat, and then he violently shoved the
YoF into the other chair.
“Do you think I have no respect for authorities,” demanded Mr.
Punch, indignantly.
Then everybody proceeded to lay the first stone of MR. Cubitt's
bridge. What was done in the abyss, Mr. Punch does not pretend to
know. Aldermen and others gathered in crowds round it, and nobod y
could see in except MR. CRAwfurd, M.P., who is eight feet high.
Mr. Punch fell back and conversed with a pleasing ex-sheriff, a Rhada-
manthine critic, a flâneur, a most genial reporter, a large editor, and an
epicurean contributor, and a few bottles containing fluid of an effer-
vescing character speedily ceased to contain the same. As ARTEMUs
WARD says, each man got outside a good deal of liquor. . At intervals,
speaking was heard, occasionally an “h” fell heavily in aid of the
foundations of the bridge, and the REVEREND DR. MoRTIMER read
out the Latin inscription bravely, and it was kind of him, when he came
to the date of the day of the month “XX” to say, frankly, “Twenty,”
instead of putting in more Latin, of which the Aldermen had had enough.
Finally, coins chinked, the chain was seen to move, and to descend,
and then a shout announced that the money had been lali away in a
savings bank whence it is not likely to be drawn for a few centuries,
without some slight notice in the shape of an earthquake. Music broke
out—and God save the Queen was played. The last time the air was
given in the foundation of Blackfriars Bridge it was in honour of young
GeoRGE THE THIRD, whose reign was not a week old.
“And now,” said the LoRD MAYor, emerging from the abyss, where
he had trowelled the stone like a true mason, “What are we to call
this bridge?”
“The old one was named Pitt Bridge, in honour of the terrible
cornet of horse,” said Mr. Punch; “but the people, though they adored
him, would never call the bridge anything but Blackfriars. Best leave it so.”
“He is, curiously, commemorated in our neighbour, the Railway
Bridge—the Chatham line,” said the Remembrancer.
“Well remembered,” said Mr. Punch.
“Somebody suggests the name of SHARspeARE,” said, MR, CUBITT.
“That would not add one cubit to his stature,” said Mr. Punch,
“beautiful as your design, Sir, undoubtedly is.”
“Then,” said the Lord MAYor, “the question is settled.”
All bent to listen, and several persons who had crawled to various
points on the beams above, fell down and lººd in the chasms,
whence they were recovered, cussing, at later dates. -
“This will be the bridge nearest to 85, Fleet Street. It will be the
Bridge over which Mr. Punch will go when, desiring relaxation, he seeks
the ocean. It will -
A universal shout went up from the deep bowels of the river, and
startled all London. One loud, decisive, Medo-Persic shout. It pro-
claimed that the new Bridge at Blackfriars should be called

that sort of thing, will be 'shocked and scandalised above measure by
% manifestation of the reverse of that feeling thus recorded in the
'imes : —
“MIDLAND CIRCUIT. DERBY, July 17th.
“Their Lordships attended Divine service yesterday at St. Mary's Church.
“The Spartan simplicity of the Sheriffs cortège was the subject of general remark.
The learned Judges were conveyed to church in a brougham .#pair that had
evidently seen some service. No javelin men were in attendance, nor were even the
customary trumpeters present. Such an utter absence of display has rarely, if ever,
been witnessed before on this circuit."
The learned Judges conveyed to church in an old brougham, and
pair | | Why, some Sheriff of ignoble ideas will next pro to have
them taken there in a Hansom cab, or to drive them thither in a dog-
cart, or—who knows iº to trundle them to church in a wheel-
barrow!, Their Lordships will possibly be seen in some places even
walking to church. Not a javelin man, not even a trumpeter How is
this? Because, in these days of an efficient county police, an armed
escort appears to be an absurdity, and, when it consists of beery old
men, in an antiquated garb, and bearing useless weapons, is a sham
Because a flourish of trumpets is an unnecessary announcement of a
Judge's advent * Perish the base utilitarian suggestion
The Sheriff that wishes to behave as such, and glorify the Judges in
the good old English spirit that appointed him to that end, should not
only organise a body of javelin-men to guard their Lordships, but should
have all those merry men attired in the uniform of Foresters, or some
other equally splendid. He should have, to carry the Judges to church,
a State Coach, gilt like ancient gingerbread, and emblazoned with coats
of arms and aimanner of colours. As for trumpeters, instead of stintin
his homage to two or three, let him have as many as may be require
for the performance of the most pompous music. The band (all dressed
_
like beef-eaters) might be accompanied by a troop of dancers. There
can be no doubt that the cheers of the populace would express the
sentiments with which they regarded the pageant thus constituted, and
a large following of little boys would assuredly attest its influence on
the youthful mind. In the meanwhile, the wise that sit in the clouds
and mock some people, would smile approvingly.
A NEW TRICK UPON TRAVELLERS.
AFTER the scorchingly-hot weather we have, had, it is really quite
refreshing to meet with anything so cool as the following advertise-
ment:—
O LADIES desirous of a THREE MONTHS' TOUR on the CON-
TINENT.-A lady and gentleman, middle-aged, intending to travel through
the Tyrol, the North of Italy, and the Pyrenees, wish to meet with another LADY,
as company, who would pay her own expenses and partially those of the gentleman,
who is experienced in economical travelling.
“Experienced in economical travelling!". Well Yes, rather so, we
fancy, if it has been his practice to travel about “partially” at the
cost of other people, as his offer seems to show. ...We wonder what per-
centage of expense he means by that word “partially;” for the term is
so elastic, that perhaps it may embrace eleven twelfths of what he
spends... We should recommend the lady, who elects to travelin.com-
pany with this experienced economist, to have this point distinctly
settled before starting; for even the society of a middle-aged couple
however economical they may be in their journeys, may be purchased
at a price which may turn out rather dear.

Not within four miles. Qh!, then I will go down, to the beach, and think. If the
Landlady has got a book she can lend me, I will be much obliged. After some
search, she produces, with an apology for not finding a more modern work, a volume
of miscellaneous poems called the Adieu, dated 1833.

“Oh, they’re Slawford folks,” says the Landlord, as if you could see them any
day of the week. -
There was a table-d'hôte at one, the Landlord told me. Would I join it?
What, with the Stanton people, and folks from Slawford? No, thank you,
Slawford and Stanton must have emptied themselves to-day, for if the number
of visitors to the Inn all came from those two places, “To them,” said I, “I’ll

.11 o'clock-Beautiful day-calm sea. No one here. Slawford and Stanton
didn't seem devotionally inclined, or they’d have been four miles away before
now. They won't come down to the beach, though. I am right. Now for, my
4dieu. I open it at haphazard—"Lines on a Daisy.” “Meek and modest little

to arrangºmy hat, so as to protect myself from the sun, without giving it up to the

but, I think I'd better keep perfectly still. They are

I am arqused by something falling on the tip of my

shake my fist at them. Shouts of laughter, and a defiant
waving of spades. Where are, their nurses? Qh4 these
are the Young Limbs my Landlady spoke of Villains!
I will go in, and get something to eat.
Slawford and Stanton are gorging, it being one o'clock,
and the table d'hôte. In consequence of this, no one attends
tº me. In despair. I order bread-and-cheese and a glass
of ale. At intervals the maid brings a cloth, a spoon,
salt, º mustard, a knife, a fork, another spoon (does
she think that I eat cheese with a * P), a wine-glass,
then a tumbler. Things remain at this stage until I ring,
when she recollects the bread. And on my again appealing
to her, she produces the cheese, Slawford having made a
| pretty º hole in it, and, finally, the beer. This takes
altogether one hour.
Why don't Slawford and Stanton go out and enjoy the
fresh air?
I am not so calm and quiet as I had hoped to be. Pooh!
I will É. out and take a good walk over the sands, far
away from Slawford, Stanton, wild dogs, and Young
Limbs. This reminds me that ive left the 'Mººn on the
beach... I search, but it has disappeared. Very annoy-
ing. Perhaps a keepsake of the fºndlady's.' Dear mºſ
I will go for my walk.
... Why don't Slawford and Stanton go out for a walk,
instead of sitting indoors all day?
A delicious breeze springs up. . This is bracing. It
blows across the sands. Ifancy it is blowing the sand up.
am sure it is, Gracious ! quite a simoom! I turn up
my coat collar and down the brim of my hat. If I turn
back, I shall have it in my face. Never mind, after all it
is not so bad as a storm of rain would be. (Perhaps this is
the reason } Slawford and Stanton didn't come out.)
In another half-hour, the wind has gone down. Pleasant
* now. I will walk out to that rocky point, and
link.
Good gracious! Thunder and lightning! Hail! Ice-stones!
I must keep on running. Dear me! what a long way I’ve
come from the beach by the Inn. Perhaps this is the
reason why Slawford and Stanton, knowing the signs of the
weather, stayed indoors,
I, see, some other person, on the beach. No-two
º: belonging to a lot that the “Young Limbs” drive
over the sands. Only donkeys could be out such a day as
this on the sands. -
On returning, I have to pass in front of three windows
of the hotel, whereat are congregated the Slawford folk
and the Stanton people, male and female. They Jeer me as
Ipass. I mentally despise them. I wish I hadn't gone, out.
I am wet literally to the skin, and having come down
for this day only, have, improvidently, brought no change.
The Landlord can't lend me anything, and I wouldn't have
anything of Slawfords or Stantons as a gift. So, I go to
bed for the rest of the day, and when the blind has been
mended, I have nothing to do but to watch the Pig. I
don’t like to ask for a book, having lost the Adieu, so I
devote myself to the Eastern Counties Railway Time-table
and the Pig. The Pig won't come out because of the rain,
so I must put up with watching the Stye. I dine in bed,
smoke, in bed, and meditate on the Pig. When it is so
dark that I can no longer see the Pig or the Railway
Guide, I ring, to ask if my things are dry. The Cham-
bermaid is of opinion that “they none of 'em won't be dry
till to-morrow morning; and as for the boots, she don't
think they’ll ever do again.” -
Slawford and Stanton filled the place with the fumes of
brandy and bad tobacco, and left late. -
I awoke, with a headache, on Monday morning. My
clothes were dry; so, having apologised for the loss of
the Adieu (the good lady almost cried—it was a keepsake),
Ireturned to Town, having for once and away had enough

THE GUIDE TO BRADSHAW.
CHAPTER II.
Of the Phenomena ºf BRADshaw-His integrity—An Irishman's testi-
mony—BRADshaw considered Politically—Ecclesiastically–Astro-
nomically—Mystically-Musically–The Key.
N dealing with BRADshaw according to the plan
pro j, we will commence with the exterior
of BRAbshaw.
The outside is Yellow, and the inside is Read.
The name of the Month of Publication at once
strikes the eye, and herein, in spite of all the
temptations to falsify facts, is invariably shown
BRAbshaw's characteristic regard for Truth.
If it is June, he writes June; if July, July;
if December he follows the same inflexible
course.
Does this not speak volumes for such a man's
integrity ? It does, twelve volumes annually;
not counting the Abridgments. -
Again, the Price is Sixpence. He makes this
pecuniary statement bluntly. . He says it's
Sixpence, not a penny more or less, and there's
an end of it." Nº haggling, no bargaining, the
lowest price mentione and nothing under that
will suit the Book of BRApshaw. , Isn't this
honest ? Who after this can entertain doubts
of BRADshawf
Twopence more, and down goes BRADSHAw
into all parts of the Country by Post.
Who, does not know the excitement occa-
sioned by the arrival of a Box of Books in a
Country House? Well, you’ve gone through
them all, from the Sensation Novel down to the
last Theological pamphlet, within a week. But
in that time is BRADsbAw exhausted? You
may have tired of your favourite poet in a fort-
night; but how many of BRApshaw's grandest
lines remain unscanned? and as to those that
you, have perused, are they not fresh again at
the beginning of the next month,” .
The urn is hissing on the table; in spite of
such senseless oppositon letus applaud; Ladies
and Gentlemen, allow me to propose a toast—I
see you are on the rack, it is : ... BRApshaw for Ever! -
An Irishman best described the Editor of this Book of Railways,
when he spoke of him as “a rale gentleman.”
Before getting at the Key, we will, while glancing at the front page
of the cover, stop for a second to gather some notion of what is meant
when we speak of BRApshaw's Raillery. Observe then a notice that
heads the page. “Look for Index, pages 1 to 15.”
... Lººk for it by all means; but that’s quite another affair from finding
it. Note, the sly but honest fellow doth not commit himself even in
ºst. In the first fifteen pages you may glean intelligence about a
łotary, knife-cleaner, a Turkey carpet, or a Crystal sewing machine,
but nothing about an Index.
Now that’s one specimen of BRADshaw's fun. What is the result?
You must be the most crusty person and ill-bred into the bargain, if you
ºlon't enjoy a hearty laugh at the neat way in which you’ve been
'...done,” and then set to work to discover the index in the place where
Mr. Sam Weller fixed his abode, that is, “Warever you can.” -
It has been left for the Astronomer Royal to make the profound ob-
servation, that BRadshaw, like the Moon, changes once a month. But
* Baapshaw may say that he never meant you to look in the Roman numerals
º commence the book, and reach xxxii. “Oh, didn't you?" say we, ironi.
cally.
the book is under the Patronage of the QUEEN, the PRINCE of WALEs,
the *}. Family, both Houses of Parliament, and all the Govern-
ment offices; “Wherein,” saith this Constant Reader of the Morning
and Evening Star, “the book hath no ſite advantage over the Moon.”
How often has the statement been read, and yet who has ever pon-
dered on its significance! -

A GREAT GOOSEBERRY AT GRENOBLE.
It is sad tº think of the spirit of incredulity in which the subjoined
paragraph is headed by the Times as:–
"A Dolºrful Stony—The Courrier de l'Isere relates the following extraordinary
instance of determination which occurred three days since at Miribel Lanchatre, in
that department. A boy, twelve years of age, named durand, having climbed a
tree, tº take a bird's nest built in a hole of the trunk, had just inserted his hand to
reach it, when the branch on which he stood broke, and, being unable to withdraw
his hand, he remained suspended by it. In this predicament, seeing no help near,
he drew a pruning-knife from his pocket, and cut off his hand at the wrist.
Having fallen at the foot of the tree without further injury, he walked home,
3. after a first dressing had been applied, he was conveyed to the hospital at
renoble.”
Given a very sharp boy, and an equally sharp knife, the feat which a
boy of twelve is above stated to have performed on his own hand is
possible enough. After having º cut off his own hand, sever-
ing the bones of the arm with a pruning knife, the little fellow may not
have had much difficulty in falling to the bottom of the tree, from any
height, without further injury. The story above related is not so
wonderful as that of the Apparition of La §º. which occurred not
far from Grenoble. No reasonable person will be surprised to hear
that, the boy's stump having been bathed in Salette water, he has got a
new hand on it.
The Vulgar Tongue.
A Fellow, charged with ill-treating his wife, wrote to the parish
officers that for some time the poor woman—
“Had been in an uncongenial state, and of a reprehensible character."
We rejoice to say that the Magistrate gave him three months and
hard labour, and we wish that it had been made six, as a reward for
such villanous language.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
L’AFRICAINE.
º SHORT time ago your
admirable Dramatic
Critic, or one of
łºgº;
ramatic Critics,
gave us a lucid de-
scription of the
H. of L'Africaine.
!he opera haying
been produced in
nearly all its glory
(it left some in
Paris) it becomes
my duty, in the
Fº of your regu-
r musical young
man, who is out of
town, at Felixstowe,
I believe, or yacht-
ing in the offing,
(where the sun
never sets, or some-
thing poetical of that
ºf to say a few
words on the music,
and a great deal can
be written on that
score.
The overture is
beautiful. Unfor-
tunately I got into
tº: occupied in
several altercations
with the official, and
- in making visits to
other seats, from which T was ejected by the lawful owners, I lost
the earlier part of this delicious composition, but it struck me that
the delicate movement on the whatshisname, where they run up
and down in the bass, is something to be heard over and over again
with increasing pleasure.
There are some fine bits of recitative here and there. When I say
here and there, I mean all through the Opera, which seems to me to
consist chiefly of recitative and the old Irish melody The Minstrel Boy.
The latter is disappointingly introduced, as no one ever sings the entire
tune, but goes off into quite another air. The name of WAsco pe
GaMA, it ought to have been WAsco DE GAMUT, goes capitally to the
first notes of the Minstrel Boy.
VAsco DE GAMUT to the Wars has gone,
Tiddy um, &c., into something else.
The chorus of the Council, who emphatically repeat the two last lines
of any speech that Don Pedro or the Grand Inquisitor may happen to
make, is magnificent. The part that I should like to play is that of the
Grand Inquisitor, if he might dance. HERR Sghyid should put just a
little more life into his performance. The adagio movement for the
violins, which serves as the accompaniment to something or other,
whose name I couldn't note down, as I hadn't a pencil, is ravishing.
HERR WAchtel gave out his chest treble X, in a manner that seemed
to surprise even SignoR Costa, who looked round at his band, and said
*::::::. but what it was I was unable to catch. The sweet touching
love song commencing
Al ribelli scagliani Panatema /
Was enchantingly rendered, and brought the curtain down with well-
merited applause. -
Between the Acts I went to look for my hat, which I had left under
the first stall that I sat in on my entrance. It was some time before
I could find the stall in consequence of people purposely concealing
the numbers of the seats by leaning against the backs. , Everybody
grumbled at my looking for my own property, and I do believe that
one or two cowardly fellows slily kicked my shins as I * my way
along. If I could have been certain of this, I would have soon let
them know who I was, and have told them that if they did it again
I should give them in custody. However, I couldn't, find my hat,
and the search made me very warm. This necessitated lemonade iced,
This necessitated a glass of brandy meat. This further necessitated
sixpence to the waiter. This necessitated my borrowing that amount
from a friend.
The Second Act had unfortunately commenced before I returned to
my stall. I made another mistake in my row, and sat myself down
by a lady, whose husband subsequently appeared, and wasn't pleased.
On the whole, the Second Act, from a musical point of view, scarcely
wrong stall, and
pleased me so much as the first. The finale, with its massive instru-
mentation and overpowering chorus is a monument of enduring art."
Thinking that the Opera was over, I was about to leave the house,
when somebody asked me if I was coming back, and informed me that
there were three more Acts. So I returned and stood in the stall
entrance, as, for the life of me, I could not make out where my seat had
gone to.
The Mariner's Chorus that opens Act III, is beautifully conceived. The
horns and brass instruments coming in with an effect that is astonishing.
SIGNOR GRAZIANI's wild song and wilder laugh, struck me as being set
to an accompaniment that was in itself a mastery over the greatest of
all difficulties to a musician, the arpeggio percolato,t to speak tech-
nically.
In the Fourth, Act the trombones and drums, with the occasional
triangle, are produced with immense effect. The celebrated duet was
charmingly rendered by Wasco and Selika, while I was having a
Neapolitan ice in the saloon. Of course the great point in L'Africaine
is that all the instruments play in unison from beginning to end of the
piece, a striking novelty introduced by the composer, which seemed to
me to make no sort of difference between this and any other Opera.
Perhaps I am wrong. -
I couldn't stay for Act W., as the ice I had taken brought on such an
intense thirst as could only he allayed by a visit to the Club. Taking
the thing as a whole, I think we may congratulate, whoever it is, on
his success.
* A musical man said this to me, to my mind it was about as much like a monu-
ment as you are.

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
Wonders will never cease. See this scrap of naval news from the
Times the other morning:-
“The following naval officers studying at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth,
have taken steam-certificates at the quarterly examinations of the present month."
[Here follow the officers.]
Steam-certificates! Well, we have heard of a steam-arm, and we
have seen steam-hammers and steam-rammers and steam-guns, but we
never before heard of there being steam-certificates. What sort of
things are they, we wonder, and in what way are they used ?...And we
wonder if the men who are successful in obtaining them will quarrel
with us much, if we speak of their success as a mere succès de steam /

WHO IS VERY FOND OF PLAYING PRACTICAL JOKES ON JEAMES, HAS MADE A MISTAKE ON THIS OCCASION 1
NEPTUNE TO THE MERMAIDS.
(Apropos of the Atlantic Telegraph.)
AVAST, there, nor swing on that cable,
You mischievous maidens, avast!
And I’ll tell you as well as I'm able,
Why that rope in the sea hath been cast.
'Tis a link of electric connection
Between the New World and the Old;
'Twill strengthen each tie of affection,
Give each nation on each firmer hold.
Small fear of their fuming or fighting,
While they join hands thus under the sea;
While an instant will serve for the righting
Of any wrong heads that may be.
All the close ties of commerce 'twill tighten,
To enterprise lend a sure aid:
Many burdens on industry lighten,
And help to make freer Free Trade.
Every spark that is flashed thro’ that cable
Of friendship will light a new flame,
Nor a day pass but each land be able
Of union fresh proof to proclaim.
Doubt, distrust, envy, hatred, and malice,
All will vanish; peace, goodwill, appear;
So avast, there, you Polly and Alice,
And mind that 'ere cable's kept clear !
OPERATIC.
A GEM.
We are not in the habit of quoting verse, as we keep our own poets.
But sometimes we see a gem that deserves re-setting. We submit,
without note or comment, something of the kind which we have just
noticed in a West of England journal. We reproduce the composition,
because we imagine that it must be the very worst poetry ever written
by anybody upon any subject, and the Extreme, either way, deserves
notice:—
“LINES,
“Written on reading the Account of the melancholy fate of the Four Tourists who
ascended the Matterhorn, otherwise named Mont Cervin, on the 14th instant.
“Eager they climb'd Mont Cervin's virgin height,
Gazed o'er the boundless prospect with delight,
And proudly thought they stood where ne'er before
Had pilgrim gaz'd that wondrous prospect o'er.
#. they dreamed not of impending woe l
Roll'd headlong, soon, four thousand feet below 1
Patrician youth, slain in their glory's morn 1
Fated to leave their memory forlorn,
Twin'd with thy far-seen crest, O fatal Matterhorn 1"

ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE.
ſº ERE is a Report of
two recent re-

CROWN COURT.
The first case
on the lists taken
to-day was that
of one MUGGINs,
charged with fe-
loniously setting
fire to a house.
In the course
of the trial, the
learned Judge
ointed out to #.
ury, that there
was scarcely any
evidence to con-
tº nect the prisoner
§ with the act.
MR. Dooty, for
the prosecution
said that he had
no more witnesses
to examine.
MR. STRONG,
for the prisoner,
showed in a tri-
- umphant manner
the great improbability of the crime having been committed by the man
upon whom it had been most unwarrantably and hastily charged.
The learned Judge summed up most favourably to the prisoner, and
concluded by hinting that there would be scarcely any necessity for the
Jury to quit the box in order to consider their verdict.
†. Jury, after a short consultation, Convicted him.
He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude.
John DoRY was charged with burglary and feloniously cutting and
wounding with intent, &c.
The learned Judge, from time to time, drew the attention of the Jury
to the glaring discrepancies in the Prosecutor's evidence.
The chief witness, MARY SMITH, was subjected to a rigid cross-
examination, in which she contradicted herself so grossly as to evoke
a sharp warning from the Court.
Joseph D.AwkINs was then examined. He knew the last witness
well, and she could not be believed on oath. This statement was sub-
sequently corroborated by several witnesses.
The Jury said their minds were made up.
The learned Judge said that of course they could but come to one
conclusion, and he was glad that they had saved the time of the Court
by their decision. Had they done so a little earlier, it would have been
as well, for a charge brought against a fellow-creature on more frivolous
unsubstantial grounds he had never heard. The foreman would formally
give the verdict of acquittal and—
The Foreman of the Jury here stated that his Lordship was under a
mistake. They were not agreed on an acquittal.
The Learned Judge then informed them that they must hear the
Counsel for the Defence.
MR. SLY in a most powerful speech, insisted upon the prisoner's abso-
lute innocence, and pointed to the utter failure of the prosecution to
bring home the deed in any manner to his unfortunate client.
The learned Judge summed up at great length, dwelling upon the
most minute portions of the evidence in detail, and explaining most
lucidly whatever legal point might be supposed to affect the case. If,
his Lordship said, in conclusion, it is the unquestionable duty of a Jury
to give a prisoner the benefit of even the slightest shadow of a doubt as
to the truth of the evidence brought against him, the obligation becomes
imperative, when instead of a shadow, we have to deal with a substantial
reality, with such a body of untrustworthy, suspicious testimony, as
would not be individually or collectively sufficient to convict even a
man whose reputation might be notoriously of the worst description,
much less, as appears to me to be the case here, where the prisoner,
until an accusation of this kind is brought against him, seems to have
borne a character singularly irreproachable.
The Jury, however, found the prisoner Gwilty.
The Learned Judge said he would take time to consider his sentence.
GENERAL WADE REDIWIWUS.
“Had you but seen these roads before they were made,
You would hold up your hands, and bless GENERAL WADr.”
As no sane person ever goes out now (and as MR. PLANT says that
the heat is going to increase, nobody is likely to go out), the condition
of our thoroughfares is not one of immediate interest. 'But we cannot
disguise from ourselves the fact, which indeed is set forth in the alma-
nacks, that after August, September, and October, will come November,
December, and January. During these latter months it is not impos.
sible that rain may fall, and in that case London will once more become
what Parochial wisdom leaves it—a sea of foul mud, which a handful of
scayengers helplessly attempt, sometimes, to remove. Wu this fact, we
hail with satisfaction the announcement that an Inverness gentleman,
of the engineering persuasion, has got something to say to our
Porochials.
..MR. MITCHELI has had large experience, having to a great extent
civilised the northern counties of Scotland by making roads therein.
He has had to discover the means of road-making economically and
rapidly. Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, takes pity upon
Londºn, the capital of Middlesex, and proposes to send MR. Mitchell
to deliver us from our slough of Parochial despond. We are truly and
sincerely grateful. . We read in the Interness Courier, an oracle that
never, speaks in vain (your health in a dram at the Hotel, Drumna-
drochit, respected Editor!) that the
“Wretched state to which the streets and thoroughfares of London are reduced
in a wet day by mud and slush, suggested the possibility of adopting a material
which, while it should be impervious to heat or wet, would retain sufficient resist-
ance for the traffic brought upon it. , MR. Mitchell, therefore, contemplates con-
structing a road of a composition of broken stones, Roman and Portland cement,
and sand, which will effect the required object, and form a complete road fit for
traffic in twenty-four hours.”
We can only say that if he effects his object, and gives London good
thoroughfares, we will throw down, as by the ... of old was
thrown, the old Colossus of Roads, MacADAM, and we will erect a
statue to MR. Mitchell, in Highland, or any other garb, or none, as
he and his friends may desire. e will fight for him, in the meantime,
against the Porochials, who, as SIR WILLIAM FRAser has shown, do
their best to hinder all improvement. As we hope to see Westries
swept away, and responsibility vested in gentlemen, who shall be elected
for their merits, and not for the sake of the jobbery they can do or
sanction, we do not despair of seeing London elevated from a filthy
marsh to the condition of a civilised town. We welcome the onset of
this beneficent Highlander, whose cry is not “Claymore,” but “No
more clay.”
GREEN AND GRAY.
He’s not what Fancy painted him, right reverend divine,
But of colour quite another, may that tint be never mine !
He threw, as prelate never threw, no end of cash away;
Oh, how green, how green a Bishop must be Cape Town's Bishop GRAY.
He strove to squelch Colºnso, and he fought a losing fight
which ºw Church did much dismay and Broad Church much
eignt.
Now Government he begs in vain his legal costs to pay;
Oh, how green, how green a Bishop is unlucky Bishop GRAY!
Ah, what a sum of money to the dogs of law he cast!
The lawyers' bills have been sent in, and must be paid at last.
And while the shovel-hat goes round, the worldly wise will say,
Oh, how green, how green a Bishop was too zealous Bishop GRAY!
The Prince of Wales in Cornwall.
WHEN the PRINCE OF WALEs visited the Museum at Penzance, his
Royal Highness had shown to him various specimens of the ore which
constitutes the principal mineral produce of Cornwall. Winking at the
Heir Apparent, a facetious bystander remarked that the Duchy of
Cornwall was the richest in the world because it yielded no end of tin.
“And here is some of it,” said the generous Prince, presenting, the
utterer of a remark whose truth atoned for its antiquity with a thou-
sand-pound note.

a grace of the Senate, the highest honour that can be paid to a man

THE NAGGLETONS ON THE AFRICAINE.
SCENE–The Breakfast Table.
Dark (important)—Monday, 24th July, 1865.
Mr. Nagoleton (who is reading the Times). I see that the Africaine
went very well on Saturday *:::: -
Mrs. Naogleton. I suppose that after thirty or forty performances the
singers ought to know the music. - -
r. N. I dare say they will. Only as the season will be over this
week, I don't see how they are to have all that practice.
Mrs. N. What are you talking about? It is more than two months
since the Opera was produced.
Mr. N. In Paris, yes.
Mrs. N. (looking up with a terrible glance, and repeating, slowly).
In Paris—yes. Be good enough to give me the paper for a moment.
(She takes it from his unresisting hand, and reads a few lines). I see.
I did not understand you, I could not for the moment believe it. I
see. I might have expected it.
Mr. N. Expected what? That the Qpera would come out? Well,
you might; M.R. GYE is in the habit of keeping his promises.
Mrs. N. (intensely). Yes, MR. GYE is.
Mr. N. What a tone ! Is that meant as a crusher for the other house?
º You understand me, I have no doubt. Let us drop the
subject.
Mr. W. The Irishman protested against being picked up before, he
had fallen down. I protest against dropping a subject before it has
been picked up. I don't know what you are driving at.
Mrs. W. Your evasion is too contemptible. But you are the master
of the house, and have a right to deny your family any amusement.
We can only submit in silence.
Mr. N. I must quote the Irishman again, and say that pigs may fly,
but they are very, unlikely birds to do it. Submission in silence is one
of your favourite habits, isn’t it?
rs. W. Do you wish it? I have read somewhere that the slave's
silence is the tyrant's danger. -
Mr. N. You great idiot, don't talk such trash. ... I am a frightful
tyrant (furious), I know, and you are a trampled slave. If you can’t
be rational, hold your tongue, and let me read the newspaper.
Mrs. N. It is a man's privilege to escape in a fit of violence, as I
have read that some fish get away by making a cloud of mud.
Mr. N. (recovering). I, compliment you, on your zoology. The
Gardens have set you studying. But now that the storm is over, will
you be good enough to tell me what it was all about?
... Mrs. N. (with a melancholy smile). If I could ever respect hypocrisy,
it would be from its association with such perseverance. I am making
no complaint, HENRY.
. Mr. N. You º: say that after giving me five-and-twenty minutes
jobation. Well, you have no complaint, but only a grievance. What is it?
Mrs. N. Nor have I a grievance. But I think, as a mother—
Mr. N. (aside). Now for something pleasant. “Mother’s” always
the cue for malice.
Mrs. W. As a mother, I may be allowed to say that you should keep
your word with the children, and not teach them to look upon your
most sacred promises as idle words.
Mr. N. (aside). Said so. (Aloud) Putting this and that together,
MARLA, I gather that you accuse me of having made some promise
about the new Opera. .
Mrs. N. And of having broken it. That is all. But as I said, you
are the master of the house, 3. have the purse, and our enjoyments
are dependent on your will and pleasure. e have no right to murmur
at your caprices. . . . .
Mr. N. (restraining himself). You are a sweet creature, and you have
#: ; of saying sweet things. But I begin to recal something of
e Sort.
Mrs. N. I am glad of that.
Mr. N. Why should you be glad ' If anybody has been disappointed
I am sorry, but the whole business went out of my head. You should
have reminded me.
Mrs. N. (with a laugh). O, thank you, no. I have had too much
experience of the sort of reception any little hint of that kind meets.
I am not always in a state to be scowled and stormed at.
Mr. M. (angrily). Tell me what I promised, and when.
Mrs. N. . (submissively). It is really of no consequence, HENRY.
What signifies the addition of one dull evening to so many ?
Mr. N. May I ask you to answer me?
Mrs. N. It does seem so strange that you should have forgotten, but
if you say that you have, of course I cannot disprove it.
Mr. M. (dangerously). I promised—what?
Mrs. N. You do not remember that wonderfully clever and sparkling
thing in Punch—the plot of the Africaine, with the most extraordinary
illustrations by that gifted artist MR. DU MAURIERP How odd | The
children were enchanted with it, learned it by heart, and played it before
MR. SNOTCHLEY and the BALTIMOREs. It was a perfect success.
Mr. N. I was not present.
Mrs. N. Well then, perfect with that drawback. But I mentioned
it to you, and†. immediately said that they should see the real Opera
when it should come out. I admit that I was rather surprised at such
a liberal promise, but once made, should it not have been kept P
Mr. N. It went out of my head, I tell you, and you ought to have
reminded me.
Mrs. N. (only smiles deprecatingly).
Mr. N. Certainly you should all have gone. At least I would have
tried to get a box, though on a first night of a new work by MEYER-
BEER, boxes were no doubt at a premium. But the truth is that I forgot
all about it.
Mrs. N. Quite natural that you should.
Mr. W. I understand you, MARIA. Perhaps, however, you, may
some day discover that on that very Saturday I remembered my
children to a better end than taking them to a theatre. But I have
long since ceased to make confidences where they are received without
º and gratitude.
rs. N. (humbly). I am very sorry, dear HENRY, that
think us ungrateful. , I am sure that we are much oblige
food and raiment, and all that you are so good as to give us.
Mr. N. (white). I believe that I am too severe in wishing the punish-
ment of flogging inflicted on husbands of the lower class who are nagged
into striking their wives. I myself, with all the advantages of educa-
tion, habit, and self-command, find it difficult to abstain from using a
very strong expression. However, that is over.
Mrs. N. I will take care to remember what I have escaped, HENRY
and avoid such risks. I would not have mentioned the Opera, if I ha
thought that reminding you of a promise to the little ones would have
put you into such a rage. But (smiling), if you are hot, your coffee is
cold. Send your cup across. I see that the season is nearly over. I
... keep the papers from the children, and they will perhaps forget all
about it.
Mr. N. They shall do nothing of the kind, for the Africaine is played
again to-morrow, and I will get a box. -
Mrs. N. A single stall would be cheaper, dear, and you will hear as
well, and see better.
Mr. N. A stall P -
Mrs. N. For yourself. We are all going to Ma. SNOTCHLEY's, who
has promised, after tea, to read Rasselas to us, and he reads so beauti-
ou should

fully (not theatrically, as you do), that I want the children to have the
treat.
Mr. N. S.NotchLEY and Rasselas, and they are to be kept from real
enjoyment for that " I shall take them myself.
!. N. Not, I trust, against their own consent as well as their
mother’s.
Mr. N. Do you want to make me believe that they would sooner, go
and sit in a stuck-up room, hearing an old frump drone over the dullest
book in the world, than go to the theatre and see a fine show?
Mrs. W. If my superintendence of their education has been efficient,
they would prefer foregoing an amusement, to committing a rudeness.
But I will ask them presently, and I will tell you their answer.
Mr. N. No, don't. I am aware of what it will be. Don't teach them
hypocrisy. It's early days for that. What night are they not liable to
be bored by SNOTCHLEY The Opera is played on Thursday, and again
on Saturday, which is the last night of the season.
Mrs. N. You refused to let me accept MRs. BALTIMORE’s invitation
for Thursday, because you said you were engaged at a business dinner.
Mr. N. I forget what I said in my desperation, when I was driven
into a corner to avoid a man who gives South African wine.
Mrs. N. That seems fastidious in a man who likes Hungarian and
Greek wines.
Mr. N. Just a woman's nonsensical talk. Because I don't like one
novelty I mustn't like another. I wish I may never drink worse liquid
than my Hymet, or my Erlauer. SNOTCHLEY himself praised them.
Mrs. N. He is a gentleman, and would not dispraise your wine at
your own table.
Mr. N. But he would behind my back, you mean. I believe that.
Mrs. N. HENRY, a gentleman puts the best construction on º:
until he is quite certain that a worse was intended. I mean that -
SNotchley could not help speaking well of what you were giving him,
and, I must say, were yourself praising, which was not in the best
taste.
Mr. W. I beg your pardon. I shouldn't praise my own house, or
my own furniture, or my own wife, or my own children. -
IMrs. N. You never did the last two things. I acquit you there.
Mr. N. If I don't talk, I’m a beggar to think, like the Welshman's
owl. But as I was going to say, wine is a sacred thing, and not subject
to conventionalities. If a man gives me bad, I’ll tell him it’s bad, and
vice versä, and if he is offended, he is not a man whom I desire to know
}. #. world or any other. And I will speak about my own wine as
rankly.
Mrs. N. As you scarcely ever give a party, it does not much matter.
Mr. N. We’ve had six or seven since Easter. And you always ask
the same people, who sit in the same places, and tell the same stories.
And after hearing S.Notchley relate for the seventh time how his
grandfather picked up GeoRGE THE THIRD's walking-stick on Windsor
Terrace, the fierce excitement of that narrative somewhat abates.
Mrs. W. I like old friends, and I do not expect you to like the tone
of good society. -
Mr. N. Your good society’s tone is rather a monotone—which
reminds me that we were talking of an opera. I will get the box for
Thursday.
Mrs. W. Believing you truthful in saying that you were engaged, I
arranged to take the children to the St. Winkle and St. Welk Schools,
to hear a lecture by a missionary from the South Sea Islands.
Mr. N. Have they been so very naughty?
Mrs. N. Who, the islanders?
Mr. N. No, the children.
Mrs. N. What do you mean?
Mr. N. Two severe punishments in one week, Rasselas, and a
mº I am sorry they are growing up so demoralised.
Mrs. N. I can joke on any subject but the moral characters of my
illiºn. I do not mind being sneered at for my attempts to improve
them.
Mr. N. Rasselas was dull enough, but the author was honest and the
English is highly superior, but a fat missionary with a pack of cant
about savages whom he perhaps never saw, or perhaps sold rum to, is
really not a party to come between the children and the Opera.
Mrs. N. They heard you say you were engaged.
Mr. N. Then l shall say that my engagement is off.
h; N. Two falsehoods—the first to your friend, the second to your
onlidren.
Mr. N. I like that from you, who told MRs. SILVERDALE that we
were going out of town on Monday.
Mrs. N. That is just what I expected. A wife struggles to save her
husband's credit, and her excuses are dashed in her face.
Mr. N. My credit! What next?
Mrs. N. ; erson will have left town next week, except those
who are detained by pecuniary difficulties, I dare not ask whether this
is your case, because any reference to such things draws on me a storm
of insult, but I did not desire that the SILVERDALEs should ºpee! it.
Mr. M. (conscious of a good balance). Ha! ha! haſ hal haſ You
should have lived in the days of the CHEvaLIER D'EoN, my dear. I
am sure you would have beaten him when he was a fencing-mistress.
Mrs. N. (mollified). There is what, my late uncle used to call, a
metallic ring in that laugh, HENRY, which does not speak badly for the
children's future.
Mr. N. (pretending not to be pleased). That is neither here nor there.
But that phrase was rather neat in the late lamented acc-—
Mrs. N. HENRY |
Mr. N. Accelerator of existence. By the way, did you notice that
the excellent iocock is not elected for the isle of Wight? That
eminent accoucheur yields to a believer in the Immaculate Conception.
h Mrs. º If you can introduce an insult to my family, I am sure of
earlng it.
Mr. N. Where's the insult I can't say I respect your uncle's
memory, because it was so bad that he forgot to leave you anything–
Mrs. M. Club jokes are very flat by daylight.
Mr. N.Yes, daylight has its disadvantages for old jokes and old—
(sees the chastening £oniº clothes. Talking whereof, we'll go and
hear the grand old Jew on Thursday.
Mrs. W. I have already mentioned our engagement.
Mr. N. Then, for the last time, what do you say to Saturday?
. Mrs. W. I object to ; out on Saturday nights. It is usually
impossible to reach this door before twelve o'clock, and then it is Sunday.
. Mr. N. Riding in a carriage is not wrong on Sunday, is it? ... You
did not say so when we were going to the Star and Garter yesterday.
Mrs. N. The Star, and Garter is not a theatre, so your sophistical
argument entirely falls to the ground.
. Mr. N. Then, we'll leave it there, and now that, the subject has been
discussed, we’ll drop it. You will make the children understand that
you and not I have prevented their seeing the Africaine, and that Ras-
selas, Fat Missionary, and Cant stop the way. I will tell you on Wed.

MEMORY AND MUSIC.
EveRyBody having any music in his soul is now talking, of the
beauties of MEYERBEER's L'Africaine, an opera which Mr. Punch so
faithfully described on the Twentieth of May, that his readers are quite
competent to chat about its charms.
What connection there can be between MR. JoHN PARRY and the
opera of L'Africaine, we leave people who like puzzles to endeavour to
find out. It may assist them in their effort to go and ; a visit to
the Gallery of Illustration, where MR. PARRY has been brushing up his
memory a bit, and, having found some funny things in it, is now ing
a note-indeed, a great many notes—of them. If only for the laughter
they, so pleasantly occasion, his “Recollections”, certainly are well
worth being treasured; and one envies him for having such a memory
for drolleries, and still more for the skill wherewith he heightens their
effect. The man who can help laughing when John PARRY is singing,
must have something amiss with his cachinnatory nerves., The bluest
of blue devils are exorcised at the sight of him, and the lowest spirits
raised to a comfortable pitch. To hear his wondrous overture, wherein
he blends a hundred airs, so that you scarce know which is what, is
enough to make a THALBERG split his gloves in clapping. And then
to hear his recollection of the nervous tenor singer, who sang º
enough until a tin-tack tripped him up: or that of the young lady who
flirted while she played; or of her who vainly practised singing with
expression; or, better still, the recollection of a very little lady, per-
forming her pet piece; or of the lachrymose young lady, without any
ear for music, gravely playing non più mesta on a knocked-about piano,
completely out of tune. To listen to such drolleries is enough to make
a man laugh, even with the toothache, in addition to a tight boot
pinching his pet corn.

BRILLIANT IDEA.
HOW WE HAD OURSELVES BLOWN UP THE RIVER, AS IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO HOT TO ROW.
HEROISM IN HIGH LIFE.
MY DEAR SNARLER, -
WHEN we met last Monday you were grumbling and growling
like a bear before his breakfast, because your wife had persuaded you
to let her give a little party—just a score or so of people to play croquet
for an hour or two, and finish with a dance. I endeavoured to console
you by remarking that I thought you had been let off very easily, and
that you should thank your lucky stars that you had not been asked to
ive a regular ball. And see here, my dear fellow, how much still
ñº, cause for consolation have you in the fact that !" belong to
Middle Class Society, and are not likely to be plagued with giving
“small and early” parties of such magnitude as this, which was the
other day reported in a fashionable paper:-
“Wiscount and ViscountEss PALMERston entertained a select party at dinner on
Saturday evening at Cambridge House, Piccadilly. LADY PALMERston had a small
and early party after dinner, which was of a private character. Only about a hun-
dred of the principal families remaining in town attended.”
“Only about a hundred families” attended ! Pretty well for a
“small” party, you and I perhaps may think. I wonder how many
of the members of each family were present; and, as the party was a
“small ” one, did any of the babies come Just fancy, what a nui-
sance it would be to “entertain” them And imagine what a labour
it must be to poor Lord PALMeRSTON to have to sit up entertaining
scores and scores of people, when, if his comfort were consulted, he
would snugly be in bed | Where, excepting in high life, can we find
an Ancient Briton—I mean an elderly Englishman, who, as the poet
does not say:—
“Who will sit up at night, unperturbed in his mind,
And to parties give up what for sleep is designed?"
Not many men of eighty would have the pluck to sacrifice in this
way their night's rest. . How would you like, once a month or so, to
have to ask a hundred families to come and spend an evening with you?
And yet you are barely fifty, SNARLER—a mere boy beside LoRD PAL-
MBRSTON; and you grumble at your wife for inviting once in six months
a score or so of friends. Go home, you peevish wretch, and smooth the
frowns out of your forehead, and be thankful that you have no handle
to your name. If you were Wiscount SNARLER, instead of twent
people only, you might this very evening have to entertain a hundred,
and perhaps another hundred before the week were out.
Hoping, then, to see you more resigned to fate than you might other-
wise have been, believe me yours in Spartan sympathy,
EPAMINoNDAs Jon Es.
P.S. The Tory papers tell us that our PREMIER is thoroughly worn
out, and has sadly little strength left in him. But one would, think, a
i.i." needs be pretty strong to keep on entertaining people by the
unſure01.
CONSERVATIVE REACTION.
Of a truth, the Tory party has small reason to rejoice at the result of
the elections. Ere Parliament was dissolved, they everywhere kept
bragging of the votes that they would gain by the Conservative reaction
which, they prophesied, would everywhere be notably apparent. But
somehow their predictions have by no means been fulfilled, for the pro-
hesied reaction has resulted in their losing above a score of votes.
R. DisBAELI, as it were, has been “hoist with his own petard,” or
floored by the recoil of the weapon he had aimed. Conservative reaction
has fairly knocked him over, while the Liberals are the stronger for
what should have been the death of them ion Paixenston gains
strength by going to the country, like as the Classic hero, whose name
is hºwn to schoolboys, acquired strength by falling on his mother
earth.
A Senile Sally.
“WE hear,” said old MR. Joke|LYN, “a great deal about paying
out the Atlantic, Telegraph Cable. ...Hey? Now, in paying out the
Atlantic Telegraph Cable, the Atlantic Telegraph Company will have
paid out a great deal of money; and when all that money has been paid
out, let us ; the speculation will begin to pay money in.”

MEAT.
My wife and children, we must eat;
We can’t reduce our diet.
But oh, the awful price of meat!
Who can afford to buy it?
Alas, the good old days gone by
I say, to their decrier,
Our venison then, indeed, was high,
But now our beef is higher.
You won't consent to try “charqui,”
Or any preparation,
Imported from beyond the sea,
Offlesh in preservation. -
Have butcher's meat alone you will,
Heavy as he may weigh it,
The Bill, and nothing but the Bill
For you—and I must pay it !
The Bill, and nothing but the Bill,
My children, and their mother?
Ah yes!—if that your wants will fill;
The butcher's, and no other,
Except the grocer's bill, of course,
The milkman's, and the baker's;
But spare me, with a moral force,
The draper's and dressmaker's.
Away, at least, indulgence cast
Of Vanity's poor passion,
And try to make your raiment last,
Without regard to Fashion.
Bestow less care on the outside,
Spend much less money on it,
And don't expect me to provide,
Each quarter that new bonnet.
See me! Five years, and more, have flown
Since last this form was measured;
Yet still these garments hold their own,
Through storm and sunshine treasured.

Stale clothes may still grow staler,
The butcher gains—the loss is thine,
My tailor, O my tailor!
Then be, my love and dears, content
With finery in reason,
Or we must keep a constant Lent,
And fast in every season:
In something we must pinch and pare
To make both ends just button.
The tarlatanes and glacés spare,
For love of beef and mutton.

THE GUIDE TO BRADSHAW.
CHAPTER II.—(CoNTINUED).
C SoME mystics, failing in every endeavour
Sº to apply BRADSHAw practically, would
have it to be an allegory, a modern
Pilgrim's Progress; a guide to a Wan-
dering CHRISTIAN, to be printed at the
Press of one FAITHFULL. To which
opinion we make the famous monosyllabic
reply, uttered by the Turkish Sultan
MAHOMMED HAFEZ, to ZULEMA , the
faithless favourite, “Bosh!” On which
an intelligent eunuch filled "g the cup
of her misery with genuine Sack, and
pitched her into the Bosh-phorus.
Talking of Sultans, reminds us of Blue
Beard, the mention of Blue Beard re-
calls Fatima, and the name of Fatima
brings us, by all that’s blue, including
Stockings and Horse Guards, to the
K
ey. - -
Of course we mean the º to BRApsHAw. This Key consists of a
number of separate notes, each having its own value, and in it you will
also find reference made to a Scale of charges. You will notice too
that all the observations therein are perfectly natural, none of the jokes
flat, and most of the remarks sharp.
1. “The first thirty-two
pages,” he informs us, “are
advertisements.” This is
2T) -
his gratuitous fun; the in- IZINº.
formation is scarcely need- º - M-lt tº
ed. We shall have a word Sºº-º-º-Tº-Hº-T
or two to say on this sub- Dº c o o
ject by-and-by.
2. “The Map shows all &
the Railways open.” He - -
robably means all the carriages open. By the way, if BRADSHAw's
Key would only unlock the doors of the compartments, no Traveller
ought to be without it. Note that.
THICK FIGURES REFERRING TO THE PAGE,
3. “The ThickFigures refer to the page on which the trains of the par.
ticular lines to which they are attached may be found.” Don't bother
yourself as to his precise meaning; you’ll soon get accustomed to his
quaint mode of expression.
Observe 'tis only the Thick figures who refer to the ; SO,
whoever lays claim to ordinary sharpness will not trouble himself about
this performance.
Note. further, BRADSHAw's caution: whatever is the subject of the
above direction “may be found” not will be found in such and such a
ce.
If the Oracle at Delphi was not an ancestor of BRADSHAw, we’re
Dutchmen, and you ladies, if English, are Duchesses.
Then follows a jest about the Index, which he pretends is contained in
BRADSHAW. But everyone knows that the Index is published in Rome,
and § the way, perhaps, BRADSHAw figures in the List of expur.
gated Books; in which case the Index contained in BRADshaw would
be a “skit” upon the Papal Compilation, and herein is an example offiis
satiric vein. -
4. Contents.-Under this head comes everyone who is pleased with
ºw, and all the shareholders who are receiving handsome
1Vldends.
, Woº-Cºntexts are not mentioned; but we’ve an idea that it would
include the QUEEN, the Royal Family, both Houses of Parliament, and
all travellers who are so perfectly satisfied with the tender care bestowed
upon their safety, and the admirable precautions taken against the
dangers of locomotion, by the Directors of the different Companies.
BRADSHAw BEING PLACED on THE INDEx By RAILway BELI, Book AND CANDLE.
The Male:Cºntents, are always quiet and respectful in the presence
of the Female-Contents of the Train, and to the latter every attention
will be paid by the Followers of BRADSHAw.
5, Time Tables-Herein BRADSHAw, revels. In treating, however,
of the starting of Trains, he has omitted to propose any line of conduct
to be adopted by passengers, whose Trains do not start for some time,
or whose Trains have started without them, which comes to much the
same thing. Of this, and divers other matters, we shall treat, by way
as we before said, of Complement to BRADSHAw. We shall have a wor
Eſſº to say for Dinner-time Tables, Luncheon-time Tables, and what is most
important Refreshment-time Tables. These will, it is most likely, have
some connection with Mahogany, except on the Dover line, where we
shall have to speak of Deal Time Table.
6. Fares.—“In the occasional, absence of these,” says the wag, “an
approximation may be obtained,” &c. Here is all the fun of the Fares
for you! But of course every one except the “Thick Figures” will
see through the double meaning...The "occasional absence of Fairs.
(read thus) can only occur in a Male Train. The “approximation”
spoken of, is probab º: you get out for a spoonful of hot soup, and
a few minutes' brilliant conversation with the attendant Fairies of
Swindon, Cambridge, Rugby, or Peterborough.
7. The sum of this note is that Thick Lines are not Thin Lines; that
the former mean one thing, the latter another thing, and both nothing
in particular. “That’s the humour of it.” The true meaning under-
lies this current of words, and what is the use of our Key to the Key
if it does not assist the otherwise superficial observer ?, This is it:-
Tourists who are going on fishing ercursions, will use “thick lines” or
“thin lines” according as their destination is the sea or the river.
8., Indentions.—“Those Stations which have an indention on the left
hand are branches showing that travellers in going from London to
Doyer, do not pass through any of those places having indentions except
at the point of function.” That is, you never pass through a place having
indentions erºt when you do.
“To indent,” signifies “To cut in the shape of teeth,” and therefore
“indentions” mean “cuttings in the shape of teeth.” “To indent.”
is also a law term, from which is derived “indentures.”. Commentators
are of opinion that here the d is a misprint for t, and that the note
should have followed No. 6 on Fares or Fairs, where the question as to
Intentions would have come in most appropriately. Such a literal
mistake is rendered all the more probable by the fact that D stands for
dinner, and therefore might without much difficulty have been mistaken
#. º thing to it—a T. There is confessedly some obscurity in
the text.
9. Dark Lines.—Those in embryo; those about whose arrangements
there is some confusion; projected lines; and lines, like the Metro.
politan Underground, or the Great Northern over ground, which, for
several miles, #. through tunnels.
.B. Travelling on an over-ground railway must be always very sharp
work. Again, under-ground officials must be excused for their blunt-
ness.
10. Bold Figures “opposite Stations refer to other lines,” &c. Of
course it does require some audacity to f. to a Station that is in oppo-
sition to another Station, and refer the passengers to other lines.
BRADSHAw would also include under the head of Bold Figures, that
large body of men whose business it is to creep under the wheels with
oil-cans, run about on the carriage tops, and so forth.
ll. Shunts.--To shunt, is a verb derived from some Latin one, or
rather from the Latin one, sum. When the Romans invaded judies,
the ancient people gradually came to use the language of the conquerors,
and, as is their custom, introduced the letter ś after the initial, medial.

or finals. Thus, sum, es, est, became shum, esh, esht, and the plural
shumus, eshtis, shunt. This last, signifying a change, came uall
into modern use. Now, in this note we fall upon a grim jest, for whic
we cannot praise our otherwise estimable writer. He says:—“The
Train, leaving London at 6.50 A.M., runs only to Watford; but, by the
train being shunted at this station into the next train, he (the traveller)
is enabled to pursue his journey onward to Stafford or Liverpool.” We
have quoted verbatim. Gracious! here is a direction, taken perhaps
from some manuscript work, some unpublished Qhapter of Accidents.
Here is “How to do it” with a vengeancel, “Shunt one train into
the next train,” says BRADSHAw, quietly, “and the traveller is enabled
to pursue his journey,” &c. Aye! but łowº On foot? And won't an
action, or several actions, for due º lie against the º f
Of course. Let us sincerely hope that in all future editions the blot
upon the well-known humanity of BRADSHAw may be erased.
12. Wave Lines ovv^^^^^^.—This is B.'s hieroglyphic, and here is
our explanation.
Under this head should also come -
No. 14, Wave Rules ====F. See BRApsHAw, p. 21, by which
hieroglyphic BRADSHAw signifies that he is a loyal Englishman, and
that Britons never, never, me-ver sha-a-all be slaves.
13, Ilotted Lines—The epithet alludes to their º from any
elevated situation, as, for instance, from the top of St. Paul's, from a
balloon, the Monument, Primrose Hill, or the Wellington Statue.
From any of these positions the Railways appear mere dots, or, we
may more correctly say, “mere specs”—and disastrous specs, too,
sometimes.
15. Branch Lines.--To proceed from a Branch Line to a Station on
the Main Line (this is the substance of BRADSHAw's note) lying in an
#. direction (italicised in Bradshaw), the following is all that is
required:-
Erample.—From Maidstone to Dover.
This is so simple that no explanation is needed.
HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINE AND SURGERY.
THE other day you, allowed an idiot to state in your columns
that reason and not faith ought to decide in questions of medical science.
That is as much as to say, that medical science is founded on reason;
whereas it is founded on experience.
Experience is the basis of homoeopathy; as is plain from the fact
that homoeopathy is rejected by all men of eminence in the medical
W. whilst it is supported by such men as the late ARCHBISHOP
WHATELY, an eminent logician.
To demonstrate the efficiency of infinitesimal doses, I need only say
that force is force whether in physic or physics. As an infinitesimal
dose of physic will arrest acute inflammation, so an infinitesimal quantity
of lº. force, properly applied, will reduce a dislocation. I am

necessary, and am, Sir,

MYSELF to the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequeB.
DEAR SIR,--Allow, me to congratulate you upon your election for
South Lancashire. It would have been a matter of much regret to me
had a gentleman of your ability been excluded from the Senate.
I write, however, chiefly for another purpose. I have noticed for
some years, and with f. pleasure, that you are kind enough to receive
Income-Tax, in the lump, at whatever time the º like to send it,
and that you, politely acknowledge the same in the columns of the
leading journal.
It is very disagreeable to me to be waited on, as at present, by a
coarse-minded and conceited Collector, who is vulgarly peremptory.
It is also inconvenient to me to pay the Income Tax at all. Hereafter,
when I shall have accumulated a fortune, I shall not object to con-
tributing to the burdens of the State.
I have therefore to request 3. official concurrence in my present
proposition. If you will kindly order the Collector for our district, (I
enclose his card—I have a pack of them) to discontinue all applications
to me, I will undertake, at my own time, to forward to yourself (or
should you be Premier, as we all expect) to your successor, the entire
sum which may then be due from me, under initials to be agreed upon
between us. I assure you that my Conscience will prevent my neglect-
inſ my duty, or my tax, and that the State will be no loser. ---
n the hope of hearing from you, assentingly, and with the addition
of congratulations on the election of your talented son at Chester,
I am, dear Sir, your obedient Servant,
MILDMAY DIDDLETON,
Right Hon. Mr. Gladstone. (Late ºf the Army).

The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER to MYSELF.
SIR,-Ido not know what business my election or my Son's is of yours;
and as I am not Premier, but CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, it is my
duty to say that I have more confidence in the immediate exertions of
the Collector for your district than in your compliance, at some unas-
signed date, with the dictates of Conscience. He is instructed accord-
ingly, and you have three courses before you—to pay, to abscond, or to
be sold up. I respectfully recommend the first, and am

SIR,--It is my duty as an Englishman, to inform Her Majesty's
Government that I have adopted the second alternative, and I consider
your letter as absolving me from all liability in respect of the Income
and all other Taxes, present or future. When will rulers be wise?

Bad Taste in a Blaze.
CRINoLINE has been said to be going out, but, it always was going
out ever since its invention. It has kept going out till it attained those
extreme dimensions which may be described as out-and-out. Doubtless
it has gone out of fashion amongst real ladies, but it is still as much in
vogue as ever with vulgar women. As far as they are concerned it has
not [. out, except in those cases wherein it caught fire, and could
not be put out. Then it has gone out leaving the wearer burnt more
or less nearly to a cinder. Her remains, what quantity of them there
was, have then been sat upon by a Coroner's Jury, that has commonly
returned a verdict of Accidental Death by Fire; which is physically
true, but morally incomplete. A better verdict in such a case would
be, Accidental Death by Folly.

MY DEAR MRs. SMITH,
WE conversed the other evening, when we met at LADY CLAP-
PERTONGUE’s |. is as well to let folks know what genteel company one
keeps), upon the sadly selfish lives which all unmarried men must lead,
and the cruel heartless callousness wherewith they mostly view attempts
to make them change their state. You told me of your efforts to unite
a wretched bachelor to some fair young friend of yours, and how their
only end had been to drive him frightened from your house: and I
endeavoured to console you by remarking that such cases were by no
means now infrequent, and afforded mournful proof of the depravity of
man. I then proceeded to point out that the reluctance which so man
young men feel to “getting spliced” (as they irreverently term it
arises mainly from a notion that a wife is a dear creature, in a sumptuary
sense. ...And just as I was showing how extravagance in dress may
foster this delusion, and how prone *:::::: are now-a-days to be
costly in costume, my argument was cut short by a carving-knife which
some fiend popped into my hand, with the request that I should sever
a leg and liver .."; Conversation of course ceases when one has to
cut up fowls, and, being silenced then by my study of anatomy, I must
ask {...} now to read the following brief paragraph, which affords a
proof of what I was proceeding to affirm :—
“A WARNING To LAD1Es.—The Publicité of Marseilles announces a new kind of
strike—that of bachelors. Not fewer than 6,000 young men, it states, of that place,
between the age of 20 and 30, held a meeting in the open air a little way out of the
town, and entered into an agreement not to ask any young woman in marriage until
a complete change shall have been operated in the manner of living, and particularly
in the dress, of the fairer sex. The young men insist on groater simplicity in every
respect, and a return to the more modest habits of a century or two ago."
There now, my dear Madam. What do you say to that?, Surely
you will grant that there are fair grounds for my argument that the
milliners are one cause of the rarity of marriages. A girl with an ex-
tensive wardrobe wants a house and furniture and company to match;
and as young, men mostly cannot afford these luxuries, they prefer
remaining single to getting into debt. As to the “more modest habits

-
of a century or two ago,” I doubt if reference be here intended to
customs or costumes. It would be shocking to suppose that, even in
Marseilles, young ladies are less modest in these enlightened days,
than they were in the dark ages, before Crinoline came in. . But if by
“modesty” in raiment simplicity be meant, clearly modesty is not now
the aim of the modistes.
Depend on it, dear Madam, if mothers would but make their daughters
dress more simply, and would encourage them to..be more, homely
in their habits, they would soon find young men willing to take them
off their hands. Many ladies now seem to live only to be looked at,
and to matters of the toilette give up more than half their time. Now,
a pretty face and figure are both pleasant to inspect; but a man who
wants a wife wants a helpmate * companion, and not merely an orna-
ment to decorate his house. If girls thought as much of cookery.as
they do of their coiffure, and were more instructed in the dressing of a
dinner, and devoted less attention to the dressing of themselyes, the
Registrar would soon record a marked increase of marriages, and hearts
would supersede the suit of diamonds or clubs.
Believe me, my dear Madam, with a chivalrous devotion to all your
charming sex, even those in Crinoline not being excepted,

Colonial Carefulness.
PUNCH's eyes are at once on both hemispheres, although he need
º remark that he does not squint. He reads a journal of the West
called the St. Christopher Gazette and Charribbean Courier. In the last
number he finds that St. Christopher had just received certain good
news, and that it was thus promulgated:–
“Her Royal Highness the PRINCEss of WALEs gave birth to an infant Prince
(a boy) on the 3rd of June.”
Quite º St. Kitts. The Prince tº a boy. Princes often are
boys, until they grow up, and then they are men. Nothing like
accuracy.

MESSAGES FROM THE GREAT EASTERN.
(From our Special Correspondent.)
“Thursday.
Y reason of an acci-
dent, my messages
have been stopped
for a week. The de-
tails were kept a
profound secret, but
it was given out that
a kink had occurred.
I have endeavoured
in vain to ascertain
what a kink is. My
Irish friend begs me
not to ask him, but
refers metotherish
melody called ‘Brien
the Brave.’ Happily
I have the book,
but can only see a
statement that the
* hero in question
‘Returns to Kinkora
no more.’ I wai
explanation. We
have quite got away,
and are paying out
merrily. The scene
at the laying the
Shore end was, I am
. º tº:
able, but there is
“…s. = such a disposition to
# =--- == turn everybody out
- - ~ of the ship, that I
thought it best to
stick on board, as I might not have got back again. A reporter for
the Seven Dials Delineator was found in a cask, with a bottle ºf:
and a Dutch cheese, and I am told, for I could not witness the appalling
sight, was keel-hauled, and the lines on the larboard side breaking,
he never came up, and is supposed to have been eaten by one of our
gigantic barnacles.” -
“Friday.
“It was not a kink, whatever that may be... A large piece of metal
pipe ran into the cable, and immediately º letting off the ..";
into the sea. The fizzing and turmoil could be distinctly witnessed,
am informed, from our masthead, and my friend the young officer says
that the explosion was thought to be a water-spout. The pipe has been
lugged, and we are º insulated. The most bitter reproaches are
º sent us from Valentia, in the name of the British public, and the
Captain says, that if it were not that he has a duty to do, he would put
back to Valentia, and punch the public's head. I have advised him to
be pacific, but he says that would be unseamanlike, as, he is on the
Atlantic. It is difficult to understand nautical etiquette.”
“Saturday.
“All goes well. My friend the young officer says that messages
constantly arrive from Ireland. We are instructed to take great care
not to let our line become entangled with the Equinoctial line, he says,
and there is now a meeting in an Irish gentleman's cabin to consider
this important subject. veral bottles have been sent for, I presume,
glass being a non-conductor, to try experiments...I have just seen the
servant come out with some scraps of tin-foil, which I know is used in
an electrical machine. As the door opened I caught the word bird's
eye,” which is the view, I presume, on some chart they are consulting.”
“Sunday.
“I am, told by the chief mate to put my watch back an hour, as the
day has decreased 63%.
but I do not remember that this correction was necessary on land.
Although Sunday, the process of paying out goes on. A Scotchman on
board grumbled that it was not right. Presently he remarked that he
saw sharks, and that they evidently mistook our line for one with a bait.
‘The stupid fish are sold,” he added. . . And it’s lawful to sell fish on
Sunday, you know,” said, my Irish friend. The Scotchman was so
shocked at the laugh that he retreated to his cabin and ordered whiskey.
We had no, sermon again to-day—the electricians say, and the Irish
agree, that the monotony of a single voice, for a º: period, has some
º effect on the electric current, which they cannot exactly
explain.”
~
_ſ.
onday.
“Accidentally saying to-day to my Irish friend that we seemed
nothing in the vast ocean, and that a single wave might send us to the
bottom, he told me to be comforted, for that there was no bottom.
Looking at the almanack, I see that it is so, lik
We are now on an unfathomable abyss. No doubt this is a gigantic
vessel, but what if that awful monster, the Kraken, should be enraged
at beholding the largest ship that has ever sailed the sea, and should
rise at her? I do not believe that he is a fabulous creature, Nor,
secretly, does my friend, and he has confessed to me that he is more
comfortable than he should have been, had our ship continued to be
called Leviathan. . Recommended me to read Hobbes's work of that
name, as containing, the very latest zoological information. I have
nothing to report,to-day, except that I am told that the pressure of so
much electrical matter on board renders our compasses utterly worth-
less, and that we steer by the stars. As there are none, I do not know
how this is managed. My friend, the officer says that he saw an azimuth,
but did not like to shoot it, remembering Co.L.ERIDGE's albatross.” -
“Tuesday.
“Hearing that there was another kink in the cable, I made a form
tºº. to see it, as I had a right to do., The Captain assured me
that as soon as it was taken out, it should be brought into my cabin for
me to see. , I retired thither accordingly, and late in the afternoon m
Irish friend came in, followed by some sailors, who, brought the ki
in a tub of salt water. It is a singular creature, and seemed to me to
resemble a fjº. as much as º its head representing the
handle, but I could not look closely, for the men kept it as much as pos-
sible under a blanket, stating that too much light would be fatal. I do
not wonder at its stopping the current of electricity. My friends said
that they had seen larger ones, one, I think, is preserved among the
t| curiosities at a London Club called the Steaks, and another was obtained,
years ago, by the landlord of a waterside inn somewhere in the East of
the Metropolis, and, called Dolly's, I asked what would be done
with it, and they said, that very likely the sailors would put it on the
fire for the benefit of their ºp er. This seemed cruel, but we have no
such scruples in the case of lobsters and crabs. I am glad to have
seen a kink, but I wish I could have sketched it. I am informed,
however, that a work called CoBBETT's Register has several drawings
of the creature.”
“Wednesday,
“A Deputation from the Company, the Electricians, and the Captain
and crew waited upon me, introduced § my Irish friend. It was
respectfully represented to me that the Telegraph was really a private
affair, and not the P. and that reporters had no more right on
board than they had in my apartments in Lyndhurst Square, Peckham.
My presence was stated to be most welcome, but I was requested, in
the event of my beholding something which might appear to me to be
very dreadful, not to describe it until my return to England. I remem-
bered the unfortunate case of the Sºvenilials Delineator, and gave the
promise, desiring to see no barnacles except those of my aged grand-
mother at Peckham. I afterwards endeavoured to ascertain from m
friends what might be in contemplation. One looked (as always
exºedingly grave. ...The other said, ‘You saw that kink?” ...Yes, par-
tially.” "Ah!”. “What do you mean?’ ‘The Company will not take
your word.” He left the cabin, groaning deeply, and repeating, ‘Q, for
a Lodge in some vast wilderness l'. I do not understand this, but if I
never telegraph again, remember that I was doing my duty, and look
after my respected grandmother.”
WICTORY TO THE CLASSICS.
(A Holiday Hint.)

“Eggs is eggs,” said ToM, with an effort, “but it ain't a hawk.”
''. Eggs are eggs, ToM,” said ETHEL.
“Ain’t, vulgar for is not, ToM,” said ALICE.
“Bother,” said ToM. “You great stupids, I don't mean hawk, as

“And that’s what Papa pays five-and-twenty pounds a quarter for,”
said ETHEL. -

ORGANISATION's loveliest flower,

The heart of this is in thy power,
Chordae tendineae, valves, and all.
The corneae of those globes of sight,
Diaphanous as morning dew
Give passage to the rays of light
É.i. each iris blue.
Above those orbits mind is there,
Anterior lobe, os frontis full,
Beneath that scalp of raven hair
Mine eyes discern a perfect skull.
With smiles those muscles wreath that face,
Matched with the lily where the rose,
Just planted in its proper place,
Right o'er the buccinator glows.

Which that fair female subject owns,
How lax each ligamentous band
That binds the metacarpal bones'

Lord Charles. Know, my HENRY, that the telescope is noticed by
LEoNARD DIGGEs about 1571. Roger BACON–
Henry. I have heard of him. He was LORD CHANCELLOR, and made
bad statues in St. Paul's. -
Lord Charles. Not so. But one thing at a time. Order is Heaven's
first law. Roger BACON described, yet never saw telescopes. They
were made by METIUs, of Alkmaer, and JANSEN of Middleburg, a quarter
of a century before GALILEO. . .
Henry. How charming is divine philosophy! I should like to go
further into the subject.
Lord Charles. You shall. But at present you must oblige me by
going further from this spot, for here comes the steamer bearing her
whom I love. [Erit HENRY.

Sir Stuckup. Delightful, place, Miss HEATHERBELL. The great

Dr. Dillwater. A very profound remark, indicating close observation

my attentions have been neither unobserved nor unwelcome P
Harriet. SIR STUCKUP, please do not subject me to this inquisitorial
persecution.
Lady Burniboozie. Who spoke of the Inquisition? When was it
founded, Doctor P
Dr. Dillwater. My dear lady, PIETRopa VERONA, the first Inquisitor
who burned heretics, was assassinated by an accused gonfalionere,
April 6, 1252.
Bodley. Serve him right.
Dr. Dillwater. Noble instinct! The holy office was re-instituted in
Spain in 1480. Next year 3000 persons were burned for heresy.
Lord Burniboozie. The Papists would do the same, I make no doubt
were they in power to-morrow, I will certainly vote, next session, for
a repeal of the Act for letting Catholic prisoners see their chaplains.
Sir Stuckup (aside). Chaplains ! I have a thought.
[They go in to lunch.
ACT IV.
Alum Bay.
Sunrise. The face of the lofty and many-coloured cliffs, sparkling, and
IPPOPOTAMOs PREPOSTERos in a variegated dressing gown, yawning.
Ipp. Prep. I hate getting | in the middle of the night. To be kept
awake by one's conscience till five, and to be called by one's yalet at
half-past, is a hideous mixture of psychology and punctuality. Minerva
knows why I am here. I am as stupid as one of É. owls.

Ipp. Prep, Can a duck swim?

ir Stuckup. That is the style I like—that is business.
Ipp. Prep. I don't care what you like. Do you understand Goethe's
affinities?
Sir Stuckup. I never heard of the article.
Ipp. Prep. Johann WoLFGANG Won GoßTHE was born in 1749, and
died in 1832. He produced various works. That to which I alluded is
among his later creations, and is a novel, called Die Wahlwerwandschaften,
Sir Stuckup. The word is long.
Ipp. Prep. And time is short. If you desire to know any more of
GoßTHE–
Sir Stuckup. I don't.

Ipp. Prep. If any of your acquaintances desire to know more of
GoftBE, let them read his life by MR. G. H. Lewes, the accomplished
editor of the Fortnightly Review. Now, what do you want with me?

off Ryde. The windows of the Club-house can be seen open, and
servants bringing wine, being sworn at, &c. Pier on L., only lighted
by a Jete wandering cigars. The sailors, in picturesque Albanian
costumes, are reclining in groups, smoking baleikas, and one is playing
on a tetrachordion, while the others sing,
“The Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece,
Where burning SAPPHo loved and sung,
Where honest folks might live in peace
If half the brigands were but hung.”
IppopotAMos PREPOSTEROs comes on board with LoRD CHARLEs.
Ipp. Prep. Poor fellows, they cannot forget their own country.
Lord Charles. Why should they?
Ipp. Prep. That is a new view of the question. I must consider it.
This yacht is Greece to them...Yet their beloved land is really bounded,
under the agreement of the Allied Powers, by a somewhat tortuous line
drawn across the Continent, chiefly along the summit of the range of
Mount Qthrys, from the mouth of the Surbiolico, to the village of
Menhidhi, in the Ambracian gulf.
Lord Charles. I will take a note of these interesting facts. I forgot to
ask who you are, or to thank you for the hospitality you so frankly
proffered when I knocked your cigar out. .
Ipp. Prep. Are we not all brothers, even if we have different parents?

Lady Burniboozie. Where is that dear, dear CHOBHAM? They said
he was here, and I should never forgive myself if I were not the first to
congratulate him on his having succeeded to the chivalric title and enor-

And geological stratification.

The picture of the Holy Inquisition.
Sir Stuc. Act Four to literature gave what its due is,
And told of GoßTHE and of MR. LEWEs.
Lady B. Act Five to your delighted ears confided
How modern Greece from Turkey is divided.
Harriet. To Educate, in every various way

Lords or Commoners, in or out of Parlia-
ment, anywhere assembled,
The Humble Petition of the Grouse and
other Game, now under sentence of death
for purposes of sporting, -
Showeth, That your petitioners are
about to be pursued by your honourable
selves, and hunted, caught, shot, wounded
and otherwise maltreated, to afford you
some amusement.
That your petitioners have, from their
birth, been fed and taken care of with a
view to this maltreatment; and, nurtured
as they are, unhappily it is not in their
power to escape it.
That your petitioners have heard from their grandfathers and grandmothers, who happen to have survived, or from their parents, aunts or
uncles, with whom they now reside, what tortures these their relatives have received in former seasons, through being hunted by bad sportsmen,
and fired at by bad shots.
That your petitioners have friends who have been mangled, maimed,
and mutilated, instead of ºf bagged, and who have suffered frightful
anguish and the loss of limb or eyesight, by the clumsy way in which they have aforetime been attacke
That such agonies have specially been suffered in º: in the fuss and fluster of what is called a “flush,” fº have been let off
without sufficient aim, and volleys have been fired at so many
irds together, that some of them are certain to be wounde
by stray shot.
Your petitioners would therefore humbly pray that battue-shooting be in future discontinued, as being barbarous and cruel beyond the
common run of sport.
And your petitioners would further pray that, as far as . be possible, all bad shots be excluded from all future shooting parties, and
that fºumen be instructed how to judge their distance rightly, and to hold their weapons straight, before they be permitted to come into
the field.
And your petitioners would further pray that loaders be appointed to load for all unskilful sportsmen, and, to prevent such mutilation and
mangling as aforesaid, that these loaders be directed to put no shot in the guns.

AN “ENGLISH BENEDICTINE” IN PARIS.
AccorDING to a contemporary, BROTHER IGNATIUs has written a letter
from Manchester, dated on the “Feast of St. Anne, Mother of the
Blessed Wirgin Mary.” wherein having stated some remarkable par-
ticulars relative to certain of his make-believe monks:—
“With regard to ex-Brother STANIsLAUs, Brother Ignatius adds, that that indi-
vidual went with his (IGNatius') money to Paris. There he was to have spent his
time in meditation and penance for his sins, while the hope was held out to him to
return to Norwich.”
Paris is just the very place of all others in the whole world to send a
sham friar to with money, and a commission to spend his time in
meditation and penance for his sins. Accordingly, none but
persons of the snowiest innocence will be surprised at the following
account of “STANIsLAUs;”
“He, however," says Brother IGNATIUs, “entirely falsified his word, and yet at
the same time writes to ask me for more money.”
Very likely. STANISLAUs most probably assured IGNATIUs that he

64 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [August 19, 1865.
-------------
EXCELSIORES 1
It was the remark of a dentist in comfortable
practice, that he would rather scale a tooth than
scale a mountain. There is something in that.
Nevertheless the members of the Alpine Club,
and others, who wish to qualify themselves for
the fellowship of that aspiring Society, will con-
tinue to scale mountains at this time of year,
risking their necks...The statute against the
employment of climbing boys is inoperative in
Switzerland, and besides, there is no statute
to prevent boys from employing themselves in
climbing wherever they please, and can do so
without trespassing.
Salisbury Spire would answer nearly every
purpose to gratify the adventurous mountain
climber, who climbs for mere adventure. Its
ascent is as dangerous as can be desired. There
is a man who climbs it every year to oil the
weather-vane. He doubtless would, for a suffi-
cient consideration, yield a turn of his office to
any gentleman ambitious of performing it, and
the gentleman could, when he had reached the
summit of his ambition and that of the spire, sig-
malise his intrepidity by standing on his head
there, to the admiration of all beholders.
The only objection to the Spire of Salisbury
Cathedral, as compared with a mountain, is that
the stones of the former are certainly not accus-
tomed to crack and bounce off and tumble about
the ears of those who ascend it. But a high
wind, during which the ascent might be made,
or a storm of thunder and lightning, would make
the chances tolerably even. -
In connection with the subject of ears, just
mentioned, there is room for a further suggestion.
Horses, in races, often win by a head, or part of
a head. Might there not be mountain races, in
which the competitors in climbing perpendicular
* could sometimes win by length of
ears
But the same anonymous hard who sings, for
the enlivenment of the tender mind,
“Here we go up, up, up,”
also announces, in tuneful numbers,
“There we go down, down, down."
Here, indeed, we sometimes do both, and there
too; but that is neither here nor there.
Here, let us say, are the Alps for the mem-
bers of the Alpine Club and their imitators to
mount in the spirit of the former of the two above
quoted lines of immortal but infantile verse.
There are Etna and Wesuvius to descend in a
frame of mind accordant with the latter. And,
for the sort of people who like running into ex
tremes, the chance of slipping into an abyss of
lava is as good fun as that of being buried in a
depth of snow.
. Enterprising speculators should get up a peti-
tion praying Parliament to pass an Act enabling
anybody who chooses to insure the lives of
members of the Alpine Club.
Obedience over the Left.
THE REv. MR. LYNE, who calls himself
BROTHER or FATHER IGNATIUs, gave a lecture
the other evening, at St. Martin's Hall, “on
the Monastic Life,” and, says the Post:-
“He described the life of a monk as that of a man
unmarried for the sake of God, and vowed to chastity,
poverty, and obedience.”
If MR. LYNE is himself “vowed to obedience”
*:: does he not obey his Bishop, and leave off
making a fool of himself?

–Isolated Jests—Irish Time—An A.B.C. Guide—B.'s Fun Allegorically Treated.
-: ,- ºr-. E will now turn our attention to the
specimens of our author's peculiar
vein of humour traceable through-
out his book.
In order to arrive at this vein we
must remove the superficial crust,
and dig deep down for the valuable
ore, for which we are searching.
If the reader will be good enough
to adopt our method, he will soon
be *...* of means for the due
working of the great BRADSHAw
Inl
ne.
After considerable labour, we di-
vide all trains into six classes; exclu-
sive of their own internal divisions
(alas !) of first, second, and third:—
The lst consists of those trains
which start and arrive. The 2nd of
such as do not start, but arrive. The 3rd of such as do start, but do not arrive. The 4th of
the trains whose departure from the starting point is subsequent to their arrival at their
destination. The 5th of those trains which, neither starting nor arriving, yet manage to call
at several stations on their road. The 6th, which neither start nor arrive, but “run.”
The four first belong to the Visibilia, the last two to the Invisibilia ; running probably on
the geometrical line, length without breadth, whereof the extreme points have no, parts
or magnitude, and the “pointsmen” immaterial Double Januses; that is, quadrilateral
or four-sided figures. Apart from these classes are the Meteoric trains, which neither start,
nor arrive, nor visit; but are absorbed.
Having got thus far, we will take a leaf out of BRADSHAw, and carefully examine it:—

THE Double Janus Guard, FoR clapham Juxotion.
We will now devote a few moments to a consideration of the special
wit and humour of BRADshaw, as exemplified in the preceding extract,
to which please refer:-
“Miles from lºº" (Wide Notice lengthways at the side ºf Fares).-
This mode of stating the distance, leaves the commencement of the
computation entirely at the option of the Passenger. Instead of begin-
ning with the unit, he starts with a unit and a half. , You will read on
until you get mixed up with the fares, when stop, go to sleep, and begin
again by-and-by.
“Fares from"—is a joke similar in kind to the above.
“A.”—The first column is a specimen of BRADshaw's peculiar vein
of humour. The trains here belong to Class 5.
“Gov.”—The second column is marked neither morning nor evening,
and may start, therefore, just when it likes. This is a Government
train, intended for members of the Government only. It partakes of
the Meteoric character.
Here you go on until, as in a children's game, you come to a “Stop.”
The Passenger for Pigwaldsen will be all right. The Passenger for
anywhere else must either make up his mind to walk, stop at Pigwald-
sem, or, having paid forfeit, to return to Town.
The third column represents a train that doesn't start from
London at all. You will see “Felton Station” written in the column.
Recent discoveries lead us to suppose that either a place of that name
once existed here, or is in the contemplation of the Directors. Some
learned men consider it as a hint thrown out to the authorities by
BRADshaw.
“Little Withem.”—Bere the traveller is referred to several º, in
which he’ll have great difficulty in finding anything about Withem. If
he does discover any particulars, they will be given in the following
simple fashion:-
- NORTHAMPTON AND PEDLINGTON.—(Sundays only.)
mrn. [1, 2, 3] 1, 2 aft. aft. Gov.
Pickershill Junct., 1-55 mrn. I Wyntanton, p. 100,89 1, 2, 3

Maltby............. 2-30 Pickershill Junct. 4-3
Wyntanton ........ 3-0 5-0 || p. 88,55, 100, #}
The point being that if you look at page 102, you will be informed that
there is no train for Withem from #. junction; and so you’ll
have to begin all your calculations over again.
Now, just take a simple case, and, having once mastered it, you’ll
never have any more trouble with BRADshaw again. Say you want to
go from London to Wagton, Take the first column: there's nothing
to suit you there, as you don't want a local train, even if you knew
what it means. Column 2, Government train. That sounds well, and
arrives at Wagton at three, Just the thing. But it starts from Hor-
bury!, How do you get to Horbury? Well, say in a cab. Ah! but
then this train runs on Saturdays only; and you must go on Wednesday.
Give up Column No. 2., Column 3 is a puzzle. Where is Felton
Station? Ah, no! Look back at Column 2. Observe the train that
leaves Horbury at 6'45, runs into (absit omen) the train that gets to
Mottleborg' at 2:55. No. don't you see that it has previously arrived
at Pigwaldsen, and stopped there? Of course.
So give up Columns
2 and 3. g p
Now for Column 4. This is sufficiently
goes regularly through all the Stations, an
two o'clock. Sºopſ here's somethin
these Stations remain all might at Stopfor What Stations? Ah, a
mysterious hand points back again to London. But we are not for these
Stations (though if we were, why remain at Stopford?...this is tyranny),
and this.regulation doesn't concern us. Howbeit, the train, “dep.”
(that is, leaves). Wagton at two. It never has arrived / Evidently it
belongs to the 3rd Class of our Visibilia.
. Such is the puzzle offered to the anxious voyager. He will simplify
his trouble thus:-Go early to the Station, and ask the Guard. Do not
leave his side; remunerate him with the price of two Bradshaws: it is
well worth your while. Get into the train, and trust implicitly to this
Guard. You may depend upon BRAnshaw for the names of the inter-
vening Stations: here neither Guard nor Porter will be of any use
to you.

HANG THE INVENTOR!
(To the Right Honourable LoRD STANLEY.)
My LoRD, -
I AM glad to see *. Lordship º: your adhesion to the
proposal for the abolition of patents for the public good. It is true
enough that if you appropriate a man's invention you, as MR. MILL
says, steal it. But stealing is no crime when it is ſegalised. Railway
companies are accustomed to take * a man's garden or house
ainst his will. It is true they give him, a certain compensation,
which he is forced to be content with. The law allows him that com-
pensation. That is the mistake. He ought to be entitled to no com:
pensation at all. Even if the seizure of a man's possessions by a great
mercantile company for public uses were a crime, the number of parties
engaged in it would subdivide its criminality so as to share it in pro-
º: which, for each person, would be infinitesimal. The Income.
axis a confiscation of the property of the few for the benefit...of the
many. But the fact is, we are beginning to discover that morality is a
mere term. -
The only sound principle of legislation is that of the greatest happi-
ness, which means the greatest profit, of the greatest number. Indi-
vidual interests must be sacrificed to those of the majority, Individuals
themselves must be sacrificed to majorities. It used to be thought a
man's duty in some cases to die for his country. Duty is all stuff; but
death for their country is a necessity which some men must submit to.
I don't advocate capital punishment as punishment, because, that
implies justice, and I don’t believe injustice. I simply maintain that it
is for the interest of the º that some persons should be hanged,
as it is that other persons should be shot. In a general sense of the
phrase, I say, “Hang individuals!” º them of their inventions,
their property, their skin, if required for the º: convenience. What
are the odds so long as the community, is, happy? Individuals must
rin and bear the privation and ruin which are demanded to gratiſy
ociety at large. t them make up their minds and submit to be
crushed quietly under the triumphant chariot-wheels of Prosperity,
Progress, and CAPITAL.

As DRAF As A Post.—(Pity him, for he is not a Comic Man.)
WANTED, A LADIES' TEMPERANCE-IN-DRESS
SOCIETY.
THE latitude of ladies has decreased of late a little, but a considerable
extent has been added to their longitude.. Their dresses have made up
in length for what they may have lost in width; and though their hoops
are cast away, their tails are nearly as protruding. Ofcourse, the larger a
dress is, the more material it requires, and the larger is the bill which,
in due course, is sent in for it. Besides, they who wear extensive
dresses must have extensive rooms wherein they may exhibit them,
just as a peacock must have space enough in which to spread his tail.
eathers. Moreover, costly habits beget other costly habits, which add
to their expensiveness: for ladies cannot, waste their finery on the
desert air of home, but needs must gad about for the purpose of dis-
playing it.
Heavenfº. us Lovely Woman, and the devil gave her fashion books!
This would many a man be tempted to exclaim, when pulling a long
face at the long bill which his wife wants him to pay for her adornment.
Perhaps in the new Parliament the question of Reform may take this
social shape, and a bill be introduced to limit the expenditure of women
on their wardrobe. It may seem to many minds that the extension of
the franchise is, not nearly of such consequence as the reduction of
wives' finery. “Reform your milliners' bills” would, many men may
think, be a far more needful cry than the cry for a Reform Bill.
In the French Senate the matter has been subject of debate, and a
speech of MQNSIEUR DUPIN has attracted such attention as to justify
its being Fº a pamphlet, H. On Ladies' Unbridled Luxury in
Dress.” Ladies bridalled or unbridalled would do well to read this
treatise, and they would do still better if they carried out the notion
MonsLEUR DUPIN thus propounds:—
“People have founded temperance societies. For my part, I should desire to see
founded a society of mothers of families who, without ceasing to dress and to pre-
sent themselves with the decency, and even the elegance, suitable to their fortune
and their station, should set the example of pitilessly retrenching superfluities. By
so doing they would relieve the lower classes, who, through a love of imitation, are
ever striving to climb to the height which it is not given them to attain.”
Dear creatures as they are, in a sumptuary sense, ladies would be
eyen dearer, in a right sense, to their husbands, if they would be a trifle
cheaper in matters, of costume. With beef at twenty pence a pound
(which seems probable ere Christmas) extravagance in dress must lead
in many houses to short commons in the larder; for the love of imita-
tion, that M. DuPIN, speaks of, tempts women with small means, to
dress like wives of millionnaires, regardless of the ravage thereby made
on the cuisine. To people with short purses, fine clot means cold
mutton; and now mutton is so dear, it may shortly mean soup maiore,
and well nigh prison fare. Husbands, whose finances are somewhat at
low water must all turn vegetarians, if the price of meat increases,
unless their wives submit to some diminishment in dress. ...
When a woman is possessed with the mania for millinery, it is hopeless
to attempt to reason with her on the point. She will turn a deafened
ear to any words of wisdom, even though they be conveyed to her by
Mr. Punch himself. Still, having the true interests of Womanity at
heart, Mr. Punch will simply echo the desire of M. DUPIN, that ladies
should establish a Temperance-in-Dress Society; and Mr. Punch will
be most happy to reward with his best smiles every lady who has pluck
enough to go and take the pledge.

of your acquaintance.
y house is to be called the Hôtel de Lullaby. It will be conducted
by a Company, Limited, so as to ensure quiet, to myself and MRs.
LULLABY, that is, my grandmother, aged eighty-three, who seldom
leaves her room.
There will be a table d'hôte, if all agree to dine at the same hour.
During dinner there will be no conversation, and the motto over the
looking-glass in the salle-3-manger will be, “Speech is silver but silence
is golden.” No pianos allowed, in case any one should arrive who was
iven to “practising,” or preferred performing with one finger only.
o instruments, musical or unmusical, of any description permitted.
The attendants will be dumb waiters. There are no Wolunteers
º". near. There must be no laughing among the visitors... They
will please to notice the inscription over the front door, “All jokes
abandon, ye who enter here.”
A policeman from the nearest market town, six miles off, calls at
Glumborough once a ºf to see if anything's happened. With
him comes a man to wind up the clocks. The latter, being a gossip,
has been warned. All daily, transactions with the butcher, the
baker, the man, with shrimps, the woman with fine fresh somethings
just caught, will be conducted in whispers, until such time as they are
able to converse fluently on their fingers, at which just now they are
* poor hands. .. -
here is a Reading-room in the Hotel, and we get the weekly papers
second-hand from the market town.
Ladies of Sunday School tendencies may teach the digital alphabet to
the scholars.
In the Classes at present we only number one, of whom we take
; care. He is a nice quiet steady-going boy, and says he pººr. his
ook to marbles, hoops, or any other #. of noisy childhood. .
There is a Smoking-room in the Hotel, but only quiet pipes and
cigars are tolerated. -
amilies will not be permitted in Glumborough. Glumborough is
not the name. There are no shops; residence at Glumborough is
economical.
You can wear what you like: all fashions are the same to Glum;
º: Quiet ties, quiet colours are mostly in vogue. Nothing loud
allowed.
There are four houses besides my own at Glumborough, all “to let.”
I have never seen their owners, and there is nobody in charge of any
one of them. My impression is, that a person coming down here with
furniture sufficient for a Bed-room º Parlour, might walk in and
occupy the ground floor, until undisturbed possession gave him a
tenant's right. -
My advertisement, which offers peculiar advantages, will shortly
appear. I think this will do:—
EASIDE.-GREAT ATTRACTION for the SUMMER MONTHS |
This is specially addressed to Gentlemen engaged in the City, in Literature, in
the pursuit of Art, and to all sufferers from Organs, Brass Bands, Men with Monkeys,
Street Singers, dwellers in the Quiet Streets of London, and soforth. MR. LULLABY's
Hotel de Lullaby, Glumborough. NO TELEGRAPHIC STATION WITHIN EIGHT
MILES, and with this, the means of communication can only be obtained on
certain days in the year, and even then their employment is attended with great
expense, risk, and considerable difficulty. POST ONCE IN EVERY FIVE DAYS,
and that uncertain. No Steamboats from anywhere to Glumborough and vice versd.
No Rail within eight miles, where train will stop if signalled two days before the
time required. There is a temporary Iron Church at Glumborough, full choral
service without organ by the visitors (if they like) on the first Sunday in every other
month. MR. LULLABy writes to ask the nearest Clergyman to attend when there
are more than two *::: (not Dissenters) *: at Glumborough. Anybody
wishing for rooms in the Hotel de Lullaby will at once communicate with the
proprietor. Silence gives consent.
There, Sir, that will do, I flatter myself. I shall be delighted to
see you, Mr. Punch, or any of your numerous friends, as soon as
you º Say when, and I’ll send you word where Glumborough is
situated.
The waves are not wild, and don't say anything down here. Glum-
borough looks out upon the silent deep. Come unto these yellow
sands, do. - -
I remain, yours noiselessly,
Hotel de Lullaby, Glumborough. SAMUEL LULLABY.

THE NAGGLETONS ON RETURN FROM THE
COUNTRY.
MR. and MRs. NAGGLEToN have been spending a few days at the House
of a Friend in a Southern County. They have returned to-day, and
converse after a late dinner.
lſr. Naggleton (holding up his wine-glass). I º: health, MRs.
NAGGLETON, and congratulate you upon your safe return to your
household gods.
Mrs. Naggleton. Don't talk nonsense, and above all, heathenish
nonsense.
. Mr. N. Well, we will say your household goods. There's no harm
in that, especially as furniture is one of your idols.
Mrs. N. I have no idols, and I do not see why a woman is to be
sneered at for wishing her house—her husband’s house—to be properl
furnished. You certainly lose no time in throwing off the mask whic
you have been wearing for three days.
Mr. N. I only wish I had worn one, for I am scorched worse than the
sole we have been trying to eat.
Mrs. N. It was not the cook's fault, . She had not known that we
were coming, and then she was ordered to get dinner in a hurry.
Mr. M. And why did she not know?
Mrs. M. Because she was not written to.
Mr. M. And why was she not written to?...
Mrs. N. Because you, with your usual ridiculous indecision, could
not say which day you would leave MR. APPLEDRAM's.
. Mr. W. I like that. I do like that. ... When you yourself were watch-
ing and dodging to find out whether the APPLEDRAMs were going to
give a dinner-party while we stayed. You only agreed to go when you
found that, it was a hopeless date—next week, or you would have
stopped till now.
rs. N. Of course I misconducted myself. I always do. Of course
I scorched the sole.
Mr. N. Never mind about misconduct. The sole, yes, because when
you had actually succeeded in making up your mind, you would not let
me telegraph.
Mrs W. Telegraph to a cook
Mr. N. Why not. Ha! haſ
own. Ha! hal
Mrs. N.We are at home, HENRY, and there is no further excuse for
the childish nonsense which you have been drivelling for three days.
Mr. N. Well, we must all laugh sometimes. I thought that we had
been tolerably § --- - - -- - -
Mrs. W. To be laughed with is one thing, but it is another for a wife
to sit and hear her husband laughed at.
Mr. N. (getting a and rude). He deserved to be laughed at for
taking such a wet blanket into the country with him. No, I retract.
I did not mean that—I take it back. But you are a refrigerator, you
know, or what it is now the fashion to call athermantidote.
Mrs. N. Don't resume the mask; be as insulting as you please.
Mr. M. What nonsense you talk about masks. What do you mean?
Mrs. N. Hypocrisy, HENRY, has been described as the tribute which
Vice pays to Wirtue. But the tribute is too often paid in bad money.
Mr. N. My wig, but that’s an epigram of the first water. I saw
that you were reading a good deal in the country.
Mrs. N. I can smile at such a taunt, HENRY. I don't affect smart-
ness. It would not do for both of us to be pretenders to wit.
Mr. N. d). Wery good, I’m sure, very good, and very affec-
tionate and wife-like. - -
Mrs. N. How you fly out at the slightest attempt at retort upon your
eternal attacks. But I am told that such is the way with joke-makers
of a certain order; they are the most thin-skinned creatures going.

O go Out.
rs. N. Pray do not let me detain you... I hope I can make allow-
ance for what you must have undergone in being obliged to be civil to
your wife from Saturday to Wednesday. -
Mr. N. I should always be civil to you, and a good deal more, if you
would let me, but your temper is so extraordinary that you construe a
kind speech into a wrong, and turn it off with a pleasant mixture of
sarcasm and ice—not delightful even in weather like this. . -
Mrs. W. Remember that you are drinking your own wine, which is
fiery, and not like MR. APPLEDRAM's.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. N. (self-conqueror). APPLEDRAM's wine is very good, but it is
neither better nor even dearer than mine. Shall I fill your glass?..
Mrs. N. No, I thank you. If your taste does not detect the differ-
ence, mine does; and #: taking his for some days, I would rather
keep to water for a time.
Mr. N. (smiling). No, no, MARIA, second MRs, NAGGLETON, Mºm-
you shall not stir me up again on the wine question., You are a first-
rate authority, of course; your esteemed aunt, from whose house I had
the honour of marrying you, keeping such a splendid cellar at the bottom
uf her wardrebe.
Mrs. N. The remark is manly. And you are perfectly well aware
that my aunt, has ample means, and that it was, upon conscientious
motives that she would not lay away money in a cellar.
Mr. N. I respect her motives, but cuss her Marsala.
Mrs. N. You are not asked to drink it.
Mr. W. No, I have that luck, certainly:
Mrs. N. Though a father might have been unselfish enough to put
up with the harmless whim of an old lady who could do much for his
#. and he might have paid her an occasional visit.
Mr. N. I have heard and read a good many odd things, but I know
no nation that makes it incumbent on a father to poison himself for the
sake of his offspring. But I have frequently told you that you could
visit the old creature whenever you pleased. - - -
Mrs. W. I trust that I need no permission to visit my relations?
Mr. N. But you don't go.
Mrs. N. That is my business, , .
Mr. W. What's the good of talking stuff You know, as well as I
do, that her idiotic will is made. -
Mrs. W. Wills may be done away, I believe.

you have me go down to your devotional. #. old aunt,
make her Marsala worse than it is by an infusion of laudanum worse
than her conversation, discover her will in a disused nightcap, and
destroy aunt, will, and cap at one fell swoop º No, it is tempting, but
tº: me not. - - - - - -
Mrs. N. If you have finished that ranting, which is not in the least
like MR. BucksTONE—
Mr. N. It is an excellent imitation, now.
Mrs. N. You think so, and are told so, I dare say, at the Club, when
you have provided drink for the members, but you really have no power
of imitation. - -
Mr. W. It is a great story, for I imitate one person to perfection.
Mrs. N. Who may that bef
Mr. N. JoB. -
Mrs. W. I º that you will not be wicked.
Mr. W. My dear, it was not Job who was that, but another member
of the household, according to SHAKSPEARE. -
Mrs. N. SHAKSPEARE had better have avoided such topics, and many
others; but you will fly out again if I venture to say that he was any:
thing short of perfection. MR. SNOTCHLEY says that is an article of
faith with people who get sentimental in taverns.
Mr. N. MR. SNOTCHLEY is an ass and a prig. SNOTCHLEY on SHAKs-
PEARE is a treat. Don't quote his folly to me.
Mrs. N. (smiling). I said so.
Mr. N. Said what P - -
Mrs. N. That you would grow violent if a word was said against
our superstition. Never mind, I will be more considerate of your
eelings than you are of mine, and not make fun of §. idols.
Mr. N.(seriously). The woman who speakslightlyof SHAKSPEARE is-
Mrs. N. Your wife, and not in the habit of being shouted at, nor will
she bear it.
Mr. N. I wasn’t shouting. -
Mrs. N. You don't know what you are doing, I think. Do put the
* into that bottle.
r. M., We have had three pleasant days, MARIA, and I think you
need not have finished the out with a row.
Mrs. N. The Out with a Row. I don't know whether it is true that
we always return to our first loves—
Mr. N. I wish some of us did
Mrs. N. Gentlemanly! But I am sure, that we return to our first
language. You must fancy yourself in the time of my predecessor in
the dignity of your wife,
Mr. N. No, my imagination is not so strong as that, in the presence
of evidence to the contrary.
Mrs. N., Yes, surely, you must, and that you have just returned by a
twopenny boat from Greenwich, after an elegant repast on tea and peri-
winkles. Don't weep at the sweet recollection. The Out with a Row.
Mr. N. (condensing his rage). My first wife had her faults, I dare
say—
Mrs. N. I really have no desire to enter into the biography of that
person.
Mr. N. But you shall hear, Madam, once for all. She was consi-
derate, affectionate, and playful—
Mrs. N. Playful darling.
Mr. M. And as unlike you in manner and talk as possible,
Mrs. N. I trust so. I hope so... I am delighted to hear it.
Mr. M. She was a very good wife, Madam, mind that. You are—
Mrs. N., I am—what, Sir P
Mr. M.,(with a vast effort). The wife of a very good husband, Madam,
who will be d-d if he will stand this sort of thing. I do not know
what time I shall be home to-night, but I have the key, and if anybody is
up when I return, I will discharge every servant before ten to-morrow.
[Leaves the house.
OUR YACHT.
IAM in Wales. This is an answer to your most unreasonable tele-
graphic message. Do not think, for one moment, that I am here form
own selfish gratification...Perish the thought. I am here for your good.
I am taking exercise in the fresh air for your benefit, and am about to
embark in a perilous enterprise in order that you, not I, may reap the
profit of a hazardous experiment. By this I give you to understand
that I am ; out Yachting. At the present moment I am thinking
what costume I shall adopt. Before I left. I saw MENKEN dressed, as
William, though, somehow or other, I quite forgot to send you that
admirable nautical drama Menkenised, an omission that shall be rectified
next week, when my more intimate acquaintance with a mariner's life
will enable me to enter into details upon which I could not otherwise
venture. , MENKEN, as William, shall be my model.
Never having had any Yachting experiences, I look forward to my trip
with much pleasure. Steamboats for short distances disagree with me,
I mean by sea, for I have never suffered much by the river, except from
a sort of nervous uncertainty as to what might happen on j
Gravesend, where the river begins to get mixed up with the sea, an
there’s a bit of a disturbance.
One of my friends has just asked me to come and see the Yacht.
If I don’t return from the inspection in time for post, you’ll have a
full, true, and particular account next week.
I re-open this to say, that I have returned in time for post.
We’ve been over the Yacht, and approve of her. That is, my two nauti-
cal friends approve of her, and I #: with them, having promised to go.
I will describe her to you, “Her” is the Yacht.
She is a large boat, at least I should say ship, only when I do say
ship, understand me that she’s not like the Trafalgar, or Kictory, or,
for instance, the Floating Police Barrackson the Thames. She's much
bigger than anything you’ve got on the Serpentine, or at a shilling an
hour at Brighton, but not so large as a vessel carrying coals, or
stones, or cattle.
She’s two storeys high, one being a deck and the other down-stairs,
where you eat and sleep. She weighs about twenty-five tons. I didn’t
see her weighed myself, but my authority was a sailor on board, whom
We are § to take as one of the crew. The crew will consist of this
man and another, the other being the Captain. I saw the Captain. He
was not in uniform, and except in name there didn't appear to be much
to distinguish him from the above-mentioned crew. - -
She draws a good deal of water, several feet, in fact, but is, notwith-
standing, quite safe. - -
The owner will warrant her a good sea-going boat. The owner is a
grocer, on shore, and anyone less nautical I never saw. He has offered
to have her painted, and something else'd, which I won't attempt to
describe, lest my sea-faring phrases should be misunderstood;
The Captain requested me to inspect the tackle...I did so. The
Captain asked me if that wasn't all right? I said, yes, that was all right.
e took me down-stairs and showed me the rooms. ...I asked where
we were to sleep. He showed me two recesses, in the ship's side,
opposite one another. They struck me as capital places for storing
coals, or odds and ends. He explained that this was where “us three
Gents was to sleep.” . He showed me a small room, I mean cabin, in
the front part, about two foot by three, with a stove, in it. This was
where the crew would cook. I asked where he, the Captain, was goin
to sleep. He pointed to a recess on one side of the stove, and said,
“here.” As he didn't appear discontented with his lot, Í made no
further observation. - -
y friends, one is a very nautical fellow, a regular sailor, said, “They
supposed they could #0 almost anywhere in this Yacht?”
The Captain said, “Ay, almost anywhere.” -
That was all right, then. We settled terms, and I am looking
forward to something like a voyage.
I have never seen America, nor New Zealand, nor Norway for the
matter of that, and I can imagine .# more Fº or independent
than landing in America from your own Yacht. I don't know, where you
get out in America, but of course the sailors are acquainted with the chart.
Farewell for the present. We christen the Yacht to-morrow, I pro-
pose calling her the Saucy Polly. Fancy the Saucy Polly gaily
anchoring off the American coast !
P.S.. I re-open this to say that I hear we can't go to America in the
Yacht. This is very disappointing. The Captain has not given any
opinion as to Norway.. What's the good of a yacht if you don't go
some distance P One might as well be at Ramsgate.

A DOUBLE KNOCK.
SIR,
To one versed, as I am, at once in the newspapers of the day
and in the history of my country, it certainly does appear that electoral
pugnacity, as displayed in front, of the hustings, has on recent occa-
sions attained a development until then unrivalled in the annals of British
valour. The Parliaments of old times are known to chroniclers by a
variety of nicknames. We have had the “Long Parliament,” the
“Short Parliament,” the “Unlearned Parliament,” the “Addle Par-
liament,” and other Parliaments whose appellations [decline to mention.
Why should not the Parliament, inaugurated under these pugilistic
auspices, have its own º: title also? In memory at once of
the distinguished philosopher who represents the spot where it will
meet, and of the striking scenes which attended the election of its
House of Commons, I propose that it be known and described as the
"MILL Parliament.”
Yours, HISTORICUs JUNIoR.
INNOCENCE OF A PAPAL DOWE.
THE . of the Tallet at Rome is a genius whose letters
will occasionally repay perusal with diversion. The style of these effu-
sions has a peculiar yolubility of utterance which affects the mental ear
of the reader with the impression of an audible brogue. Their author
appears to be a rollicking religious Irishman, with a reverence equally
#: and comical for the PQPE and the Sacred College, and the
erarchy, and all the rites and ceremonies and parade of Popery
and the Majesties, and High-and-Mightinesses, and Grandees thereof.
A phrenological artist would depict him, from imagination, with an
immense organ of language, prodigious organs of veneration and mar-
yellousness, and not any of conscientiousness and causality at all.
Subjoined is a specimen of this genial and ludicrous writer's naïveté:—
“The Italie states that M. DE SARTIGEs will not return to Rome to resume his
functions as ambassador. He will be no particular loss, but we have had worse,
merely to cite LAvALETTE. It is a singular fact that the principal qualification of
all ambassadors of France to the Holy See, seems to be that the Tambassadress
should be a Protestant; MADAME DE SARTIGEs being the third since 1865.”
Surely the penning of the last sentence of the foregoing extract must
have been accompanied with a most solemn wink of the writer's eye.
There is humour in his affectation of not seeing that the French Govern-
ment, in selecting an ambassador to deal with the Court of Rome,
would naturally prefer one who would have no trouble to keep his wife
out of the Confessional.
Slippery Cards.
THE subjoined item of information is derived by a contemporary from
the Report of the National Revenue:—
“THE CARD Duty.—The duty on Cards last year produced £8,927 8s.”
We wonder how much duty on every pack of cards was paid by the
knaves.

sank below the level of the horizon; how the Captain had to remon-

intended; how some one had played on the bow-drum until the parch;
ment had grown quite crinkled and limp; and how the bights would
not bite, and, it was thought that we should have to vary our course,
and borrow the Bight of Benin. The same kind friend brought me the
dynamometer to look at, and, though it seemed to me to resemble
only a sailor's huge watch, such as I have seen for sale in Houndsditch
for thirty shillings, it was gratifying to behold such a triumph of mecha-

circumstances, to obtain the best information for you. I have my own

again at Snailsborough,
where the train doesn’t
stop, is one of the deep
things of BRADshAw.s
ere is one key. Ob-
serve Column 5. Com-
pare “Gov.”...with the
stoppage of "Gov.” at
Column 2. Note that
the times are similar. The trains are identical. And yet, on second
thoughts, they’re not, as we have omitted the intermediate Stations,
extending over nearly a hundred miles, in, our calculations. These
trains are Meteoric, and become absorbed, as above mentioned. . .
After a time you’ll observe BRADsHAw becomes tired of marking fares
and distances, and so, beyond a certain point, these matters are left to
the imagination of the traveller.
The sum of it all is, When in doubt, ask a Guard, or ask a Porter,
and pay for your information.
In order to divert the mind from too protracted a study of the above
curious and remarkable Time-table. we will ask our reader to consider
one or two of BRApsHAw's isolated jokes, cast up by the volcanic power
of his exuberant humour, and scattered, far and wide, over the broad
fields of his book of Railways. -
Take the Newcastle Line. He avoids all mere punning about New-
castle, under line, and so forth: he despises that, and startles you,
chucklingly, with a thoroughpaced, practical, knock-at-the-door-and-
run-away kind of joke,
“On Saturdays this train stops at all stations, up to and including Walker.”
. You may be annoyed with him at firs; but you can't choose but be
: by these high animal spirits. There is a poetical feature in the
above ilne.
Place “On” as the termination of a line immediately preceding, and
“Walker” at the commencement of the line following, and we have a
neat Hexameter, viz. –
-- On
Sātūrdays this trane stops at all stāshünstip tan including
Walker." -
By a very natural transition from one line to another, we drop the
meter and come to Hexham, on the North Eastern.
What says BRADSHAw? Passengers, (the direction with regard to
some trains is to this effect) can book to any Station on the line, but the
train, only goes to Hexham. A new form of an old joke, of course
which we would advise our author to omit in a later edition, if indeed
he has not already done so. To recur to the Time Tables.
The following is what BRADshaw calls Irish time:-

“A.”—This train contains a first and second class, and comes under
the head of No. 9. in our “Visible” division. It arrives, but never

BRADSHAw is at all events open and above board in the announce-
ment, and first and second class passengers will, with their eyes open,
book themselves at their own peril. -
How many such have started years ago, and are wandering about
England to this day? -
The third class only have arrived! But the third class passenger
must possess no ordinary acuteness, in order to know at what point he
may get into the train; and when he does catch it, having waylaid it
after a night's watching, he must be prepared to go to Stockport,
or Nowhere; he must, moreover, be prepared to give up the entire day
to this sport of “Train-stalking,” as 1:45 may be A.M. or P.M. i., BRAD-

that only one station, Leeds, has to be passed. But it may be that you pass
the whole day and night as well at Leeds, Walking would perhaps be
preferable, if fine. This is one of the trains for allowing time to pas-
sengers to see the country.
“C.”—This train“ runs” to the North, and belongs to the sixth class
of the second division “Invisibles.”—a sort of pauper, or orphan train.
Where it goes, or what are its fares,
Nobody knows and nobody cares.
The hand that should indicate North, is clearly pointing South, anº
the hand that points North, only attracts attention to the key, p. 21,

JAMEs BRown was charged with having scuttled the Gravesend

sank, but the majority of the passengers were saved.
The prisoner said that some friends had treated him, and he hardly

WILLIAM Buggins was charged with having laid a large log across

some accident a look-out was kept, and the train was stopped. -
The prisoner said that he might have done it, he º: say. It
was his grandmother's birthday, and he had taken a drop too much.
The worthy Magistrate remonstrated with him, in the kindestmanner,
against letting his meritorious family feelings induce him to exceed the
limits of moderation, and as no one had been hurt, of course could not
think of detaining a man who had erred unconsciously.
Jonathan. JARwis was charged with rushing into the street on
Sunday last, just as people were coming out of church, and knocking
down a congregation with a large stick.
The F. hoped he should be forgiven. He had only just returned
from abroad, and the wine of this country soon intoxicated him. He
hoped to get used to it in time.
he worthy Magistrate asked whether any complainants remained in
attendance. Being informed that there were several, he said that it
was not very creditable to their charity, after the explanation that had
been given. However, he must enforce the law, and should fine the
prisoner five shillings.

house of a gentleman in Baker Street, pulling the bell, kicking, and

a lady who had recently become a mother had been made dangerously ill
by the nuisance.
The prisoner said that his own wife had caused him to be turned out
of doors because he was drunk, and this naturally infuriated him.
The worthy Magistrate said that it would infuriate anybody, and she
ought to be ashamed of herself. As for the house in Baker Street, was
the knocker properly tied º: -
The gentleman said that the white glove had been removed.

discharged the prisoner with an earnest caution.
BARNABAs, BRiggs was charged with rushing among the bathing
machines at Sandpiper, ºf the ladies, dragging away the horse,
beating some gentlemen who endeavoured to interfere, and drowning
an aged bathing-woman.
The prisoner, a very athletic man, said that he had been a sailor, and
having met some old messmates they had drunk together until he hardly
knew what he did.

ANOTHER BRILLIANT IDEA, ONLY BRILLIANTER 1
(Wide “Punch,” August 5th.)
CURIOUS QUESTION IN RAILWAY LAW.
DEAR SIR, -
WE, all know the law of the Railway Carriage. Window, and that it is under the undis-
puted control of the person who sits in the corner with his face to the wind.
But, Sir, the Great Western Carriages, as you may know, are divided in the middle by a door,
which separates the two compartments.
. MRs. GRUNDY and I were on this line the other day, and I had reason to believe that the lady
in question had some remarks to make to me of a somewhat incisive character. I may or may
not have deserved them. I admit that it was three o'clock in the morning when I got home
at least I think so; but on the other hand I don't often do it, I had met friends, my watch had
stopped, the cold punch was good, and the night was very hot. However, I was clearly
going to catch it, for MRs. GRUNDY desired me to close the door in the middle of the carriage,
and then she herself pulled up its window in rather—I must say—a menacing manner. I do
not usually read on railways, all doctors say that nothing, is more ruinous to the eyesight,
but on this occasion I plunged, head over ears, into the Cherbourg fêtes.
Before MRs. GRUNDy's warning cough was
over (she caught it, of course, not waiting
in the wind for the cab after ALFRED MELLON's
Concert, but sitting up in a comfortable room
for me) agentleman in the other compartment
put the window down again.
I was obliged, at MRs. GRUNDY's instance,
to commence a row, in the course of which
I called him names, but I hereby privately
signify to him that I was very much obliged
to him, as the wrangle prevented the lecture,
and took all the steam out of MRs. GRUNDy.
But, Sir, as one .. have pleasant things
to say to a lady, as well as unpleasant ones to
hear from one's wife, in a carriage, please
inform me what is the law of the Middle Win-
dow on the Great Western, and oblige
Yours very faithfully,

'Twas we, in Cherbourg gay,
That with the Frenchmen lay,

And hollaing was a duty.

Our DACREs led the way:

No man got drunk that day;
We drank no more than what we ought.
Our brave allies' good-will we sought,
And not their lives and booty.
From mouth to mouth the saying ran,
“This is the way for every man
To have to do his duty.”
No death, nor any wound,
From guns that did but sound,
A single breast received ;
No harm on either side.
“Hip, hip, hooray!” we cried,
“To see what fun we’ve lived

And French and English friends at last;
Free trade for war and booty.”

And England will confess that man
Has rather done his duty.

with a small boat. The Crew said that he had taken necessary
OUR YACHT. provisions aboard. It struck me that he had taken some.
EALLY, I own I was
ſl disappointed . on
earing that in our
Yacht we could not
go to America.
The other evening
A we held a Council as
º to what sea course
should be taken.
My two compa-
nions I will desig-
nate as Dick and
Tow, these being in
fact their real names,
and the third in the
arty being HARRY.
t is not a conun-
drum, but after the
information already
given, Ileave you to
guess who HARRY
18.
Dick said at the
meeting that there
must be a Com-
mander. We as-
sented. I proposed
Dick, and this was
- seconded by ToM,
Dick said he had the casting vote. We agreed that such a privilege was right and
proper in a triumvirate. -
Dick consequently voted for himself and was elected Commander nem, con.
The Commander then took the chair, and in due discharge of his authority made
Tom his first Lieutenant. I proposed myself for Mate. After some deliberation
between the Commander and the Lieutenant, as to whether I should be subjected to
an examination in nautical matters, [against which they decided, owing to their
inability to frame a sufficient number of questions,] I was elected a Mate.
The Commander asked for what point should we make first.
Somebody said (I forget whether it was ToM or HARRY) that we ought to have
a compass. I remember I added “and a chart” as an amendment. Being asked,
“a chart of what?” I said I didn't know. On second tº: I suggested, “Of the
sea.”. The Lieutenant inquired, “Which sea?” I was a little annoyed at this, and
said “The sea,” emphatically. The Commander ºted the discussion. “The
question before the house, he meant the Admiralty Board—”
The Lieutenant observed it wasn’t exactly the Admiralty Board. With this, in
my character as Mate, I coincided. - -
The Commander wished to know, rather sarcastically, “What it was, then?”
'The Lieutenant said he didn't know; but it wasn't the Admiralty.
I voted with the Lieutenant. The question then arose, as to whether a mate had
a vote, that is suppose we were on board a man-of-war. The Lieutenant said
“Suppose we weren't.” This remark threatened to lead to a rupture, as the
Commander rose and said, that “if we couldn't agree, we had better give the
whole thing up.” The Lieutenant said he was only joking. I told him that if he’d
sit down again it would be all right. My tone was conciliatory, though my meaning
was, perhaps, not sufficiently clear.
The Commander impressed upon us the importance of settling the point of our first
voyage. The Lieutenant thought that Puffin Island would not be bad fun. ...;
no very distinct notion as to the fº. position of Puffin Island, I expresse
myself to the effect that it would not be bad fun. I had some idea that it was in
Bantry Bay; I was going to say as much, but a doubt crossing, my mind as to the
existence of Bantry Bay, and as to whether, aſter all, I didn't mean the Bay of
Biscay, induced me to hold my tongue on the subject altogether.
: Puffin Island would do to begin with,” the Commander said.
So it was settled that we should start for the island the next morning. I have
ood reason for remembering the next morning, because, my sailor's dress came
own from town. Such a sailor's dress! Short blue jacket, with silver buttons
marked with an anchor, and * of white silk; striped white and blue shirt, with
open collar, and light blue tie. hite trousers, very loose, over the shoe; striped
stockings, patent leather shoes and buckles, and a belt with ornamental clasp." A
straw hat with a ribbon, having the name Saucy Polly inscribed on it completed
the costume.
I came down to breakfast in it, and reported myself to the Commander. He
objected to the Saucy #. that not being the name of the Yacht. It was to be
christened that morning, and called the Nautilus. He said that this wasn't the dress
for a mate. I said I thought it was, and appealed to authority. The Commander
asked what authority?, I replied, MENKEN as William. The Commander said, if I
was going to have any tomfoolery, we’d better give the whole thing up. (He was
always giving the whole thing up on the slightest provocation.) The Lieutenant
was sure that, I was only joking. I said, yes, that was it, though it wasn't. It
ended by the Commander lending me a Pºjacket, which quite obliterated MENKEN
as º, (I have since discovered that the Commander was right, at least
practically.
The two sailors, our Captain and the Crew, were both waiting for us on shore
thing more than necessary, as his voice was husky and his
gait unsteady.
ToM the Lieutenant explained to me that all sailors
rolled more or less in their gait. I asked if all sailors were
more or less intoxicated, to which he replied, pooh! that
intoxication was not allowed on board a man-of-war, and
that a gentleman's Yacht was as strict as a man-of-war. I
had to select one of two conclusions, either ours was not a
gentleman's Yacht, or the Crew was sober.
It is due to the Crew to say, that adopting the latter
alternative, his civility and politeness were perfectly oppres:
sive. He would see every one into the boat before himself,
although he had to pull the bow-oar, and ought to have
been first, finally tumbling in head foremost at the stern,
and having to be picked out by myself and the Lieutenant.
I believe, he wanted us to understand that that was his
usual method of getting into a boat.
With the exception of a slight delay caused by the Crew's
9ar missing the water, whereupon he fell back with his heels
in the air, we reached the Yacht without any mishap.
Qnce on board, the Crew disappeared into the “hold.”
I think it was the hold, and we saw nothing of him for the
next half-hour.
The Boots, in another boat, brought our luggage and a
bottle of wine.
The Commander here called us on one side, and said that
he thought, it would be advisable in the presence of the
Captain and the Crew to call him Commodore. What did
we think? The Lieutenant said he’d call him a Barn-door
if he liked, to which the Commander replied that, “If he
was going, to play the fool, why there was an end of it all,
and we’d better give the whole thing up at once.”
The Lieutenant explained that it was his fun, and ob-
served he “Never knew a fellow” (meaning the Com:
...] “take things so seriously.” The Commander said
pointedly, that it was iust as well to be serious sometimes;
to which we agreed. I was the first to call him Commodore,
and he then said, “It was all right.”
Our provisions, which we forthwith inspected, consisted
of a leg of mutton, potatoes, a chicken, eggs, several loaves,
butter, a corkscrew, four bottles of brandy, two of rum,
two of gin, knives and forks and plates. e would .
on shore and take in fresh things as we wanted them, the
Commodore said. , I asked if we should be able to get any-
thing at Puffin Island? He replied that there was only
one house on Puffin Island. "I thought of RQBINson
CRUSOE, and was going, to question him concerning, the
religion of the natives, when the Lieutenant said that we
shouldn't land at Puffin, and proposed that we had better
get on our way, or “under way” as he expressed it (which
is a nautical term, meaning starting,) at once.
The Commodore here said, that an idea had struck him;
we must keep a log. A log is a nautical term meaning a
log-book, or a book in which you keep the log. The book
is about the size of a moderate-sized account book, and in
it you note down what happens during the voyage. I
shall introduce these explanations from time to time, as
though BRITANNIA, rules the waves, Britons in general are
quite at sea, pººl. as regards nautical manners and
customs.-N.B. “Quite at Sea,” and all about BRITANNIA
was entered on the first page of the log when I got it, but
scratched out by the Commodore, who said, “if foolery was
to be introduced, we’d better drop the whole thing.” I
promised not to introduce foolery, and the log was confided
to my care... I have, clandestinely, restored the text.
Boots, being still on, board, was sent on shore to buy a
log-book. He returned in an hour's time with it, and we
then thought of getting “under way.” (See previous note.)
Lieutenant asked if we were going to christen the ship.
Commodore said he’d quite forgotten it. The name
decided upon was the Nautilus; I still stood out for the
Saucy Polly. We subsequently fixed upon the Saucy
Nautilus as a compromise. -
The Commodore was then referred to for instruction as
to the method of christening a vessel. He said you broke
a bottle over her bows, (this is a nauticalP. meaning
the front part of the vessel, I think, called bows, because
she bends to the waves,) and named her whatever it was.
The Lieutenant thought that the Commodore meant a
launch. The Commodore said it was all the same thing.
The word was º: aft, (this is a nautical phrase, used
when you send for somebody who's in the after part of the
vessel,) for the Captain and the Crew to come forward.
No. 1259.”

The Crew came up, looking as if he’d just pulled his head out of a bucket of cold
water, as indeed was the case. When we were all assembled, the Commodore addressed
us in a neat speech, and saying that the vessel was to be called the Saucy Nautilus,
he broke the bottle of sherry (brought, by the Boots) on the capstand (this is a
nautical phrase; its meaning is evident, though practically it’s not much used for this
urpose). - - -
p He * asked us to give three cheers for the Saucy Nautilus. This we all did with
the exception of the Crew, who became melancholy at seeing this waste of good liquor.
After the ceremony, which was not quite so impressive, as I could have wished, the
Captain, who had been cheering lustily, came forward and informed the Commodore
that his master (the § would be very much annoyed if we changed her name,

MR. PUNCH,
. You have been present at a variety of entertainments during the past season,
balls, dinners, drums, fºes, garden-parties, private views, soirées, and conversaziones:
º will, therefore, anticipate the train of thought into which I am about to fall, and
prepared to hear and sympathise with a complaint touching the º: to which
ladies go in their dress, and to issue a grand remonstrance, on behalf of yourself
and your long-suffering fellow countrymen, addressed to the whole female population
of these happy isles.
I am, by nature, a meek, modest, bashful, retiring, nervous man, but when I do
overcome, my constitutional timidity, and go out to struggle with Šociety, I would
rather not be obliged to keep my eyes fixed on the carpet four-fifths of the time I am
in the saloons of fashion, lest I should put my foot in it by tearing some beautiful
brunette's dress “out of the gathers.” I do like now
and then to look at a picture on the walls, or a Wedg-
wood vase, on the table, or the tall blonde with blue
velvet in her amber hair, who has just been singing
SCHUBERT's “Adieu.”
I hasten to make the most comprehensive apologies
when I know I am really in the wrong; but to ask for
a free pardon twenty times in an evening, when you
feel that the plea for mercy, should come from those
who persist in a clumsy fashion; and to be looked at
as though you deserved the treadmill; and to see sweet

Not, Mr. Punch, if you, pass a sweeping censure on
this gift fashion; not, though it may pain your gallant
heart, if you give its followers a good trimming—I
might say a good dressing—and delicately hint (for this

The plaintiff is a widow only forty-eight years of age, the
defendant a widower of full thirty-six, and a boiler-maker
earning as much as £2 a week. They had been betrothed
for two years, and their wedding was put off from time
to time on account of an inflammation of the eyes,

defendant had, indeed more than once proved himself
ready to lead the plaintiff to the altar, but she thought
proper to pºstpone the marriage ceremony from time to

and married somebody else. In this clear case of
faithless desertion and trifling with the feelings of a con-
fiding, woman, a British Jury, for once in the way,
actually found a verdict for the iefendant

THE BLACK ELECTOR.
A PLEASANT PROSPECT FOR OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS.
The newly-constituted Elector, SAMBO, is sitting on a stump, and playing
a small banjo. Enter an American gentleman, MR. RUFUs X. SMART.
Mr. Smart. Well, MR. SAMBo, how do you do?
Black Elector (with dignity). Massa Saúño am berry well, tank you,

Mr. Smart. Glad to hear it, MR. SAMBO, rejoiced to hear it. Hope
your crop's coming on well. - -
Black Elector. Pretty well, Sar. Dis white trash ain't no good much
at work, but we’ll soon kick 'em into a better knowledge ob things,
and obdeir privileges in serving a kind coloured genelam.
Mr. Smart. They ought to be glad to take your money, and do your
work, M.R. SAMBo. By the way, you must mind and exercise your
rights as a citizen. -
Black Elector. Hate exercise like the debbil, Massa, What's your

music lesson? - -
Mr. Smart. No intrusion, Sir, I trust. My name is RUFUs X.

hopes to have your distinguished support at the coming election.
Black Elector. Sar, if you cheek dis nig– dis coloured genelam,
you’ll make 'quaintance wid him boot on your dam skin. What you
mean, Sar? - - -
Mr. Smart. No anger, MR. SAMBo. The Government of this almighty
and everlasting country has thought proper, in its extraordinary en-
lightenment, to invest you with the franchise. You understand, I am
sure. It has given you a vote. - -
Black Elector. Dat a lie, Sar. It hab given me nuffin of de kind.
Where is it? Dere’s my house. I give you leave to go into a coloured
** house and look. If you find de vote, bring it here directly
Lillnlū.
Mr. Smart. I have not made myself quite clear.
Black Elector. You seems a stupid hoss, dat’s clar—yup, yup, yup,
yup, yup.
Mr. Smart (aside). I’d give five dollars for five, minutes leave to
canvass him with this strip of hippopotamus. I'd obtain a genuine
expression of his sentiments. My dear MR. SAMBO, you are a gentle-
man of America. - ---
Black Elector. Ah! Now you talk sensitive, Sar, quite sensitive, and
me proud to know you. Sit down, Sar, and don't be bashful, we are
all alike and equal—all cakes out of the same oven, only de coloured
genelam a cake which am better done. Like cake and molasses, Sar?
Mr. Smart. Delight in it, I assure you, Sir.

Mr. Smart. Admirably clever, MR. SAMBQ. I have heard nothing so
good at the theaytre. You would realise fifty dollars a night on the
stage.
Black Elector. Dam low dem actors, Sar. And they am tied to de
clock, obligated to go and sing whether in the humour or not, and
whether 'em drunk or sober. Data slavery which no coloured genelam
could smit to, Sar.
Mr. Smart. You are right, MR. SAMBO, and I am truly glad to hear
you proclaim such unhesitating enmity to tyranny of every kind. I am
sure, therefore, that you will give your vote to my friend, the
Honourable HoMINY BustER, whose maxim is that freedom should
roll over the Universe like the boisterous air, and be bounded only by
the firmament and by the ecliptic.
Black Elector...You talk jolly well, Massa. You make dam good pious
preacher, Sar. 'Tand "; on dat stump and preach, and dis coloured
genelam give you half a dollar.
Mr. Smart. I’ll come to-morrow, and do it for nothing; to-day I have
an engagement, and I must go; for I am not like you, Šir, a free and
unfettered gentleman who can do as he pleases and who has no master
but himself. -

Mr. Smart. Thank you, MR. SAMBo; I'll call to-morrow and drive
you to the place of voting, and show you all about it. I rely on the
promise of an independent American gentleman.
Black Elector (loftily). You may do so, Sar (Erit MR. SMART). Civil
beast, datam, for a white, but not know polite manners. But am now
time for some rum, and some sleep. Coloured genelam too precious
to danger him health over working.
POEM BY EARL RUSSELL.
WHEN a universe is busy in paying tributes to his merit, Mr. Punch
need care little for individual praises. Still laudari laudato is pleasant,
and the quiet “hear, hear,” of one judicious friend in the boxes is more
gratifying than the shouts of a theatre full of groundlings. Mr. Punch
recently lighted upon the following verses, contributed by EARL
RusskiL (LoRD John, when they were written), to a, Lady's album,
and the poetry is so charming that Mr. Punch, albeit blushing at the
praise of his own loveliness, cannot help inserting them in his pages.
The FOREIGN SECRETARY will be as pleased to see them again as Mr.
Punch was,
“ON PUNCH.
“To distant worlds a guide amid the night,
To nearer orbs the source of life and light,
Each star, resplendent on its radiant throne,
Gilds other systems and supports its own.
Thus we see Punch, upon his fame reclined,
Enlighten all the universe of mind;
To some for wonder, some for joy appear,
Admired when distant, and beloved when near,
'Twas he gave rules to Fancy, grace to Thought,
Taught Virtue's laws, and practised what he taught.”

A DROP FOR THE DRAMA.
THE P. of sinking the stage into a vehicle for puffery is one that
all good judges must assuredly condemn; and we are, therefore, not
surprised to find that MR. BARON BRAMWELL has lately thus de-
nounced it:—
“This was an action for not exhibiting an advertisement of the plaintiff's for
fifteen minutes each night in the drop scene in the pantomine of Mother Goose. The
verdict was for the defendants, his Lordship saying that most people would avoid
dealing with a tradesman whose advertisement appeared for fifteen minutes each
night on a pantomime drop.”
Not merely “most people,” but all people who are endowed with
common sense assuredly are not to be attracted by shop puffery, and
doubtless would be found to act as MR. BARON BRAMwell hints.
Unluckily, however, “more geese than swans do live, more fools than
wise,” and tradesmen, knowing this, try to catch the silly birds by all
the traps that can be set for them.
Where their pockets are concerned, it is of little use appealing to the
good taste of the advertisers, and attempting to persuade them to
abstain from this defacement of the stage. Men, who do not even
scruple to spoil a lovely landscape by sticking up shop placards there,
will never hesitate to plaster mere stage scenery with puffs. Still, it
may be worth the while of managers to speculate a little as to how
many of their audience, these stage puffs may disgust. Sensible folks,
certainly, are not yery likely to be tempted to a theatre by the know.

EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTUON.
The Western Daily Press announces the following intelligence respect-
- >
ing “The Benedictines in Bristol”:-
“Monday being known in the Calendar as the Feast of the Assumptiºn, the
Bristol Branch of the O. S. B., iij resolved to usher it in with all that theatric
display which is so prominent a feature in their proceedings.”
The Feast of the Assumption is a festival of the Roman Church. It
was not included by the Reformers in the English Calendar. The
Assumption of the Church of Rome is one thing; the Assumption of
the “English Benedictines” is another. The latter Assumption is the
Assumption of the character of monks, an Assumption which is wholly
unwarrantable, and would be equally gratuitous only that it earns some-
thing, namely the derision of the multitude. The Feast of this
Assumption is one very fit to be celebrated by mummers who assume
the name and habiliments of friars. Only they should hold it, not on the
Fourteenth of August, but on the First of April, identifying the Feast
of their Assumption with that of All Fools. Indeed, it may be said,
that in this Assumption of theirs there is no less of the ass than of the
sumption. ... In addition to the foregoing remarks, we may mention, on
the authority above quoted, that the “Benedictines” of Bristol, under
the leadership of a buffoon whom they call “Prior CYPRIAN,” pro-
ceeded to march through the streets in their masquerade attire, and got
up a demonstration which occasioned a row, put an end to by a
policeman, who obliged the mock-monastic mountebanks to move on.

given to an illustrious layman, who at the same sitting shall be created priest,

The correspondent of the Post at the Italian capital (pro tem.), with
reference to the foregoing statement, observes that the readers of the

was **. by
some idle genius,
who, being pos:
sessed of a piece of chalk or charcoal, was led to inscribe his opinions of
men and things, pictorially or in writing, on the walls of our public
buildings or aristocratic mansions. This juvenile genius was doubtless
a descendant of the Ninevite, Egyptian, and Assyrian little boys, whose
works have caused so much trouble to modern antiquarians.
No. 1 may be seen in the British Museum and the Crystal Palace,
Sydenham. No. 2 may yet be found on some of the London walls.
The juvenile genius above mentioned grew up, and found himself, by
a stroke of bad fortune, penniless—an outcast from society. His only
property, with the exception of the rags on his back, was a small piece
of chalk. With this it struck him he would write on a flagstone his

“You shall be talked about !” cried the Genius. ...
“Who are you?” asked the Shopkeeper, superciliously.
“Never mind who I am, MR. Muggins,” returned the Young Man,
as if inspired: “I’m going to make your fortune, and my own too.”
“Better begin with the latter,” sneered MUGGINs, turning on his heel.
“I cannot, or I would,” replied the Genius, proudly, yet sorrowfully.
Muggins paused. He liked honesty, and this had the ring of the
true metal. -
“We are necessary for one another,” continued the Genius.
MR. Muggins eyed him with pity.
“I am no lunatic,” said the Young Man.
...}* !” said Muggins, doubtfully, “I’ve only your word for
that.
“This,” cried the Genius, “is the Talisman.”
He held up a piece of chalk.
Muggins looked at the chalk, then at the Young Man, then at the
chalk again. He could evidently make nothing of it. - -
“Well?” said Muggins, beginning to think he was wasting his
valuable time. “What next?” -
“Look!” was the reply of the Genius, as he began to draw upon
the wall a hieroglyphic. -
“What’s that?” asked the Genius.
“That?” said Muggins, adjusting his spectacles. “Why-eh-
bless my soul! then’s trousers/? --- -
“And what’s that ** continued the Genius, writing something
underneath the strange picture.
“My name and address l’exclaimed the astonished Muggins, “and
the price of the article!”
. “There are so many walls in London,” whispered the Young Man
in his ear—“so many walls in the country, and—”
: Hush!” said Muggins, “walls have ears.”
... And mouths,” quoth the Genius, closing one eye.
“Come you within,” said Muggins, cautiously, and they entered the
Op.

And MUGGINs's “twelve shillingers” became necessary to the existence
of all the fashionable young City Clerks, Government Clerks, and go-
a-head Shopboys in the Metropolis.
This was the history of the rise of Mural Advertisement Decoration
all over England.
Need we say that the hand that carried MUGGINs through the length
and breadth of the land, was that of the Genius upon whom we first
stumbled, chalking his farewell address to an unsympathetic world.
Now, on the walls of nearly all Stations are works of art, not to be

MUSICAL BENEVOLENCE.
HE Season being over, there is
nobody in town now, as every-
body knows, at least nobody ex:
cepting some three millions of
poor wretches who cannot get
away from it. How we who are
thus prisoned here contrive to
pass our time, and manage to
amuse ourselves, must doubtless
be a puzzle to more fashionable
people. Both the Operas are
closed, and few theatres are open,
and nobody can give a party
when there is nobody to come
to it. It is true there are the
Music-halls; but it is not ever
erson who is gifted with a relis
}. vulgar comic songs plus bad
beer and tobacco. How there-
fore can les misérables, who are
kept in town at Autumntide, con-
trive to kill their time without
committing suicide?

this sad necessity, MR, MELLON
has the charity to give his pleasant
Concerts, where, for the small sum of a shilling, the connoisseur may
hear MożART and MENDELssoHN performed well nigh as well as they
are played at the guinea Philharmonic. He may hear, too, sweet-
tongued LIEBHARDt, and clear-throated, CARLOTIA PATTI, and he may
hear such lively dance-tunes as will set his toes a-tingling. Moreover,
just at this | season, when people kept in town so sadly need amuse:
ment, MR. GERMAN Reed invites them to his Operas di Camera, and
any one who wants to pass a pleasant evening cannot well do better
than accept his invitation. Light lively little works are they, and
tastefully produced: the wonder being, how a stage so small can show
us so much scenery. If the singers have small voices to match the
ºf: they sing upon, they at least have no big band oyer which to bawl
and bellow; and their notes can reach the audience without the latter,
so to speak, having to put their ears on tiptoe.
THE YOUNG LADY'S HOPE.
SoME Gentlemen and Ladies of the Archaeological Institute that met
in Dorset the other day visited the Norman Chapel of St. Catherine, at
Milton Abbey. . The Rev. C. W. BINGHAM told them, of a legend,
according to which the young women of Abbotsbury used, on a certain
day, to go there and pray to St. Catherine for husbands. Whereupon,
says the Building News:–
“MR. BERESFORD HoPE, who at these gatherings is always equal to any emer-
ency, modestly proposed that all gentlemen and married ladies should retire from
he Church, so as to afford the young ladies present the opportunity of using so
desirable a prayer."
If this very hopeful ". of MR. BeRESFORD Hope's was
adopted by those to whom he proposed it, the #. himself, how-
ever, did º not retire along with them. He perhaps considered
that HoPE should remain behind, in Pandora's box, as it were, with the
young ladies. . It is to be hoped that hope, on this occasion, told
. § those fair archaeologists a flattering tale, which will be shortly
reallSed,
Temperance in Liquor.
THERE is perhaps more than one remark which may have occurred to
: of those who read, one day last week, the following announce-
ment, :-
“The Teetotallers are to have a grand fête at the Crystal Palace on Tuesday next.
Excursion trains will run from upwards of 500 stations.”
Many doubtless remarked, that of course the fountains would be all
set playing for the accommodation of the multitude of water drinkers.
Some, possibly, expressed a hope that plenty of stretchers would be
provided to take them home. -

body to read it to you. It is an extract from the warrative of the
Great Fire of London, your own overgrown and demoralised miserable
metropolis. It is, in the works of your famous De Fox, but was not
really written by the Unabashed One. But it is authentic, Sir. Wide
Bohn's edition, Sir, page 221.
The Great Fire reduced your howling citizens to want and dismay,
and what was the course of poor old trampled Oireland?
“At the news of the fire, all the good subjects (O, we are good
enough when you want to come over us) in Ireland were seized with
the utmost consternation (that’s a lie, anyhow) upon that deplorable
accident. The Lord-Lieutenant, the fºurº or Öºonſ, (he was an
Irish Juke, mind ye) set on foot a subscription for the relief of the
sufferers. It rose to a higher value than could have been expected in
so distressed a country (Ah () where there was not money to circulate
for the common necessities of the country (i. to that now, and then
abuse our posterity because they did not always.pay their dirty debts),
or to pay the public taxes. (Do ye see that ? Wise English statesmen,
lay on taxes, and make us no money to pay 'em—yah!). Therefore the
i. i* was made in Beeves, thirty thousand of which were sent to
Ondon.
Beeves, Sir, means Oxen, and is the plural of beef, and quadrupeds
of the bovine species. That’s the way poor old Oireland, in all her
distress, treated your hungry Cockneys. And now your Cockney
newspapers abuse us because we won't have your unsalutiferous old
cows, Blush, Sir, if you can, and anyhow believe me
Your indignant well-wisher,
THE O'BLUNDERBUss.
A SONG FOR THE SMALL GERMANS.
GERMAN Students and professors, smoke-beclouded, steeped in beer,
Sing, as we request our WHALLEY.; sing a song good fun to hear.
Poor deceived, bamboozled, petty kings and dukes of Germany,
Sing your song of Schleswig-Holstein, sing it in a minor key.
Qn you,...diddled done and dished ones, for your favourite song we call.
Schleswig-Holstein sing, new version, sing it, ye small Germans, small.
Schleswig-Holstein, sea-embraced, a Oneness ever vowed by you,
Prussia's King and Austria's Kaiser in your teeth have split in two.
Ye tobacco-cloud-compelling drainers of the beery pot
Sing by “Federal Execution” all the good that you have got;
All the dirt that can confederates with a pair of robbers soil,
All the infamy of plunder, with no portion of the spoil!
Sing AUGUSTENBURG thrown over, OLDENBURG kicked far aside;
Sing the future Prussian navy that shall in Kiel harbour ride.
Sing your aspirations, so accomplished, for a German fleet;
Sing “Hurrah for Hohenzomºns ; here we are at BISMARCK's feet !”
A PRELATE IN PLAY.
THE possibility of being at the same time serious and lively was
illustrated the other day, at Salisbury, on the occasion of the meeting
in the Guildhall, of two great missionary societies, by a distinguished
}; }* brother of Sarum occupied the Chair. According to
onz dzºtº --
“THE Bishop or Oxford, who, it is needless to say, was loudly applauded,
said that the Christian grace of obedience had been eminently practised that
evening. He did not hear the commencement of ARchdeacon HARRIs's speech,
but he had no doubt, he said, he would not have risen had it not been in obedience
to his diocesan. MR. WALPole preluded that noble oration of Christian statesman-
ship (Cheers) with a protestation against speaking at all. MR. Huxtable made
a spasmodic effort of obedience; while the startled guest, MR. Hubbard, fresh
from palatial hospitality, was also loth to speak.”
Hey? What? “Fresh from palatial hospitality” and “loth to
speak.” Well; so a man naturally might be in the state ascribed to
MR, HUBBARD by the Bishop of Oxford. Was DeAN Close present
in the assembly to which Bishop WILBERForce addressed the foregoing
observations, and if so, what did he say? Of course we know that the
Right Reverend SAMUEL was only joking, and we cite his words merely
to show how the grave can be combined with the gay in episcopal
eloquence, as oil and alkali are in soap.

A PLEA FOR CHILDREN'S DINNER PARTIES.
THE Hospital, for Sick Children is a most excellent institution, and
kindly care is taken of small invalids admitted there., Very many are
the ills, which, especially in London, infant flesh is heir to, and the
hospital has always all the patients it can hold, while, there are even
children waiting to obtain an entrance. Scores of little ones now-die
for want of such assistance as this charity provides, but its funds are
insufficient to permit of its enlargement, Need another word be said to
stir, the organs of benevolence, and extract a tenpound note from the
pocket of the charitable? .
Meanwhile, until the hospital be doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, as
speedily it ought to be, surely something may be done towards diminish-
ing the numbers of those waiting to be inmates. Prevention of an
illness is still better than a cure, and many ailments of poor children
come from causes which, by proper care, are easily preventible. For
instance, want of nutriment, of course, occasions weakness, and becomes
a sadly fruitful source of ...; Many a young life might be saved
by a timely change from cottage fare to more substantial diet. A good
meal twice a week, even, may keep a child in health, who would other-
wise be *g. and surely this is no great gift to grant, Oh, ye philan.
thropists' Surely, most of us can spare a few shillings a-week to help
some such a scheme as this, announced in the Spectator:-
“There is a MR. G. M. Hicks somewhere in Bloomsbury, who, we take it, is
about as sensible, kindly, and practical a philanthropist as exists in England. This
gentleman and his wife have organised in Woburn Buildings, Clare Market, a daily
dinner for sick children, who are }." in a pleasant room with a full and
healthy meal. About twenty-five children, all rickety, or cripples, or more or less
ill, are here fed at twelve o'clock on good food, under the careful supervision of a
matron, and amid pleasant sights and sounds. The eſfect on the children, half of
whom are perishing for want of nourishment, is said to be extraordinary, and
the entire cost of the place is under £237 a year. One poor lad had at first to be
carried in a cripple, then hobbled in on irons, and now walks in, sickly but inde-
pendent, the cure being mainly due to the food."
Bravo, HICKs l we must exclaim, however vulgar it be thought in us
to make that exclamation. Bravo, HICRs of Bloomsbury ! May your
good example be followed out wherever it is anyhow found possible, and
surely there are few places, indeed, where it is not. Let children's
dinner parties be given in all poor neighbourhoods, and let all little
weakly ones have standing invitations to come and sit together twice or
thrice a week. A doctors' bill may be prevented by a timely bit, of
beef; and pills and powders may be saved, through a slice of batter
pudding. The rich, who are more troubled to get appetites than
dinners, can º put a proper value on the hunger of the poor, or
rightly estimate the consequence of insufficient nutriment. Were an
alderman to give up turtle, venison, and º: and for a month or
so live on mutton broth and toast-and-water, he might form some faint
conception of what hunger really is, and might entertain some sympathy
for those who are half starving. Men who eat too much commit a
wicked waste of food, and, indeed, a worse than waste, for over-eating
brings on illness. Let them only spare the food they would be healthier
without, and how many a poor child would be the healthier for having
it If old Dives would but make a rule to lunch on bread-and-
butter, he would relieve his digestion from a needless mutton chop,
*. might better serve to strengthen and to keep in health young

A Generous Offer.
MR. John BRIGHT says he would not in the least mind accepting
MR. DISRAELI's proposition of lateral reform” upon one condition-
which is, that he would make it “equilateral” instead; and that simply
means, as propounded for us by the Member for Birmingham, “equality
on all sides.” However, he is going to America where he will
it to his heart's content! . Example teaches a great deal more than
theory, and we should not be at a ºiled if JöHN BRIGHT returned
to England completely dis-Americanised.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEIGHBOURLY NUISANCE,
If we were Emperor of England, and could do just what wepleased to
do with property and people, we would issue a decree that the horrid
street .P Holywell be instantly pulled down, and that prompt measures
be taken to purify the Haymarket. Next, we would give orders that
bill-sticking be prohibited, and heavy penalties imposed on people who
deface the public streets with their big posters. Then, after issuing our
commands to have the Van Demons exorcised and all street music sup-
pressed, and the pavement cleared of betting brutes and small bratssellig
pipe-lights, we would increase still further the comfort of our subjects by
prohibiting, on pain of death, all playing on pianos in all houses where
a door or window is left open, or where, through scanty bricks and
mortar, the sound is found to penetrate into the next house.
If one lives within thin walls, such as most houses have now-a-days,
one is certain to be tortured by the noises made next door, and the
music, there is often more tormenting than a barrel-organ, for you
cannot order it away or tell policemen to get rid of it. What is one
man's treat becomes another's torture; and when Jones at Number One
gives what his friends are pleased to call a º soirée musicale,”
poor Brown, at Number Two, is driven half distracted by it. Or say that
SMITH, at Number Twenty º the fiddle like an angel, and that his
wife, when she accompanies him, plays most angelically too. But these
two angels in the house of SMITH are esteemed two perfect demons by
poor Robinson next door, who has haply a bad headache, or is writing a
prize essay on the Uses of Retirement or the Benefits of Peace. ...
Then, besides the playing, there is what is worse, the practising.
Where the family is alº one, and the girls are taught at home, the
practising is pretty certain to commence at seven o’clock, P.M., and to
continue with but little intermission until night. Oh, the torture of
residing next door to such a family, and of hearing those eternal scales
and everlasting exercises, and that never-ending air, with variations
which is the elder girls' stock piece, indeed their ſº piecei
Every day you hear the same notes played out of tune, the same
flounders and full stops; and every day you wish you never had been
born, or else that, at any rate, you had been born stone deaf. The
peine forfe et dure was a bad torture enough, but worse still is the pain
of the pianofore et dure, when strummed upon next door, and, thanks
to your thin walls, you cannot avoid hearing it.
FOOLS PARADISE.
It may not be generally known that the greatest fools in the Metro-
politan Police Force are made to do penance in Covent Garden Market,
and contribute greatly to the confusion, and impassability of that
thoroughfare. We have been favoured with Portraits of three of the
incapables on active duty.
A Question of Popular Science.
º h headed “Iron in Blood,” the Mechanic's Magazine
states that M. Pelouze, who has been º inmaking investigations
respecting the quantity of iron contained in the blood of animals, finds
that, whereas, the blood of man, and that of mammiferous animals
º contains from five to six parts per 10,000 of iron, that of
irds contains from three to four. Has M. Pelouze analysed the blood
of the ostrich? It ºf: interest some minds, especially amongst our
rural population, to know whether or not an exception, as regards the
comparative º of iron, in the blood of i. and mammals, is
presented by that alleged ferrivorous individual of the feathered race,
VeRY LIKELY.-A skeleton, the remains of a man who had been
buried many years, was discovered the other day at that once celebrated
resort, of Turpin and other highwaymen, Shooter's Hill. It was per-
haps that of somebody who was shot there.
MRS, ST. STEPHENS” IDEAS OF HOW
MANAGE A HOUSE.
(From her Correspondence.)
WHEN parties get into a new House on their return from the country,
they often declare they have so many things to do, they don't know
which to do first. It is so natural for novices to make this excuse, in
order that no one may be surprised at finding them in a muddle.
On first º: House, be particular to notice that the seats are
free from dust...I have myself seen many seats (Ishan’t mention names,
that wouldn't be polite) where you could write B-r-i-b-e-r-y with
your finger. They were literally covered with what looked like gold
dust. Everything that harbours corruption should be at onceremoved
om the House,
You will find MR. GLApstone, whom Irecommended to you, a very
excellent Butler. He had a situation at Oxford, but left in consequence
of his employers, who are very close and fidgety, wanting him to wear a
cast-off livery; you may safely...trust him with the keys of the cellar.
He is an excellent judge of Wines, and will economise in every way
consistent with the respectability of the family he has the honour to
serve.
By the bye MR. G. has a son whom he wants to apprentice—perhaps
you could do something for him—he might, I think, be of assistance to
his father in drawing the corks.
MR, WHALLEY, or some other inquisitive gentleman, will be sure to
want to peep into the Laundry where the young ladies with Italian-
irons are getting up their veils. It’s no use trying to laugh them out
of it. Irons have great attractions for some minds, especially the flats.
Schoolmasters, looking at your large family, will not be backward in
sending in their prospectuses. Before Julius Cæsar came here we
were spared this infliction, Parents then used to sit down quietly and
teach their offspring-chiefly I suppose by kissing—under the Mistletoe
º: Goodness knows what a worry we have now with our little
ritons.
Qne word as to your beer... I always have mine in, in nine gallon
casks. Some parties wouldn't allow a drop of beer to come into the
House on any consideration, for fear of the Servants making too free.
If you don't chimein with their views they will make very unneighbourly
remarks, but these are parties who have only one idea, and are never
happy but when they are throwing cold Water at the Brewery. ..
As to the House you had better have the gutters looked to in time;
and act liberally towards the workmen when they bring in their Bill. I
don't wish you to settle any Bill without proper examination, but it’s
a great thing to have a House wind and water tight. Yours is well
insured in the “Monarch,”—the foundation is good and so are the
fastenings. Have you any idea what is the value of the fixtures?
The tax-gatherers knock will now and then disturb your peaceful
dreams, but you have this consolation, they might be more frequently
intº if your House was on the other side of the water.
In all matters of difficulty you cannot do better, than consult MR.
PALMERston the family Solicitor, and be guided by his advice. At
present he has got all your Deeds, and knows better than anybody the
title to the House, having held a Lease of it for many years, and on
one occasion I believe § my memory don’t fail me) he entered an
action of Ejectment against a party that came from Derby.
TO
CALL A SPADE, A SPADE.
Tories often, now-a-days attempt to win support by going to the
poll as “liberal. Conservatives,” and protesting that their principles
are almost identical with those of the old Whigs. Say they, “There
really is no difference between us and the Liberals. We are quite as
eager as they are for Reform, and we of course go. in for Progress and
all that sort of thing. In point of liberality, there is not a pinto choose
between the Government of LoRD DERby and the Government of Loºp
PALMERston. In fact, to use the phrase of Shopkeepers, it is “the
same concern.’” - -
Now, Mr. Punch is not so green as to be gulled by talk like this. It
is true that, by time-serving coalescence with the Radicals, the Con-
servatives have passed a liberal Act or two, of insignificant account.
But whenever a test question has been brought before the House, the
Tories all have voted on the side of their traditions, and have done their
very utmost to oppose Reform. However “liberal” at the hustings
Conservatives have called themselves, they have proved Tory to the
backbone when called upon to vote. To talk of liberal Conservatives is
much the same absurdity as the mention of “hot ice and wondrously
strange snow,” and people who make use of so ridiculous a term,
thereby, to Mr. Punch's thinking, simply make themselves ridiculous.
The Love of A WEED.—Ladies, when being courted, ought not to
object to the moderate use of tobacco. They should recollect, that
where there is a flame, there must be smoke.

turn º: nose at it.

whitebait.

lobster cutlet. Your health, my deaſ.
Mrs. N. Pray do not take wine without eating. You are not in your

Mr. W. No fear, the wine here is very good—your health, again, in

What do you mean by sticking me in

Mr. N. Well, we came out, for amusement, didn't us? However,
here is something that suits this child,—the salmon, cutlet and pickles.
What a noble thing is pickles' Even as a retort, the word has great
classic power. - -
Mrs. N. How strange it is that if there is one vulgar thing in a whole
dinner, you are sure to pounce upon it. I, think I, have heard MR.
SNotchiey liken that kind of mind to a leech, which instinctively
fastens on the unhealthy part. . .
Mr. N. If old S.NotchLey had introduced such a delightful illustra-
tion at dinner time, I should have º his walking into the
garden; but as the speech is yours, I will only drink your health once
more, and advise you to take some eel—the sauce is curious. I’ll have
i. § this Spey boy, with the Tartar—an article to which I am accus-
onnect.
Mrs. N. That is vulgarity, it you like. A piece of rudeness may
sometimes be redeemed by its novelty, but there is nothing so intole-
rable as worn-out impertinence, particularly when one cannot escape.
Mr. W. You don’t want to escape, I hope, my dear. An Admiral's
great grandchild talk of §§ a Ship !

ever heard you say, HENRY. You see that I can be just.

Mr. N. Is it my fault, that we remain in town? Are you going to
throw your aunt at my head? I have told you that there’s nothing
serious the matter with that respectable Miss FLAGGERTY, but you
insist on remaining. -

Mr. N. I have no objection, but do }. duty without grumbling.
And, as for the season, I am sure that there are several women in the

Mrs. N. That is a happy thought to console a woman with.
Mr. N. Ha! haſ . More Champagne? Yes, it would have been a
clumsy speech, certainly, only, you can say with the vain Irish girl in
the story, that this is not the dress you’ve got at home.
Mrs. N. (in a low voice). These persons are mostly provincials.
Mr. N. You talk of them as if they were criminals—as Cornelius
O'Dowd describes the Cook excursionists, who, he tells foreigners,
are taken to be gradually dropped all over the Continent.
Mrs. N. They are quite unlike the class one would have met here a
month ago. -
Mr. N. Yes, they look healthy and happy, and are thoroughly enjoy-
ing themselves, poor unhappy creatures. Let us hope that some day
they may know better things, sit down without appetite, eat without
F. drink without laughing, and go away worse bored than when
they came.
Mrs. N. Those are your radical prejudices against the manners of the
upper classes.
r. N. Let me give you some devilled bait. The fish are not what
they were, but as the hymn says, Satan finds some whitebait still for
º to do. Hush it is not wrong to joke about it. DR.
Atts was a Dissenter.
Mrs. N. You may sneer at my attachment to the Church of England.
Mr. M. I never did anything of the kind.
Mrs. N. But you cannot shake it.
Mr. N. Shake the church, my dear? I should be very sorry. But
I wish the cook had given another shake of the pepper-pot: ..
Mrs. N. Your palate is vitiated, and requires unnatural stimulants.
These fish are very hot.
Mr. W. Louis! Pweever! (Louis instantly brings pepper.)
Mrs. N. It was lucky that you gesticulated as well as spoke, as he
would never have known what you meant. Why not have spoken English?
Mr. N. I preferred French.
Mrs. N. Then why not have spoken French P
Mr. N. So I did.
Mrs. N. Your º is something awful.
Mr. W. I am glad that there is something awful about me, a ray of
the Qlympian Jove, as it were. How jolly good this Champagne is. I
could drink it in oceans.
Mrs. N. How foolish you are I can see, now, how it is that you
are led away by WYNDHAM WARING and the Club lot, until you take
much more than }. ought, and come home as you did last night.
Mr. N. I was home before you, any how.
Mrs. N. What a subterfuge f was with the BALTIMOREs at
ALFRED MELLON's Concert. "You have no taste for good music. I
suppose that you would go if you were allowed to smoke in the
private boxes.
Mr. N. A Spanish gentleman showed me some cigars the other day,
called entreactos, so even the horror you invent is not unpresident—
unprecedented, I mean.
Mrs. N. I told you that you were taking too much wine.
Mr. N. You told me wrong then, for I was taking too little, and a sip
went the wrong . and gave me the hiccup, or hiccough, as the purists
spell it. Will you have some more duckling?
Mrs. N. I want nothing more.
Mr. N. No more do I, of course; but we don't come to Greenwich
to eat what we want, but what we don't want. I have given you a
quiet dinner, as you said, you’d dine in the coffee-room, or we’d have
had a private room and all the glories of Art.
Mrs. N. As when your sister and her husband were in town; but
anything is good enough for a wife.
Mr. N. As if you did not insist on my rather going a-head that day.
Mrs. N. Your sister's tongue is venomous, and I did not wish her to
go back and proclaim all over Derbyshire that we had taken her to dine
in a public room.
r. N. Her betters do so—as at this present speaking.
Mrs. N. That is an artful way of turning it off; but I am not a fool.
Mr. W. On the contrary, my dear. . The woman who, having no par-
ticularly large show of what the world-mind, I. only say the world—
calls attractions or advantages, secured HENRY NAGGLETON, and keeps

THE Italians delight in calling their Sovereign Il Régalantuomo.
Why shouldn’t we style the KING OF PRussia King Honestman, and
confer the same addition on the EMPEROR of Austria? They have
toual claims to it, those two models of morality, those examples of
rectitude to all Europe; and although they were the other day like to
become foes, they are now brothers. They were reconciled on Saturday
last week at Salzburg, whither WILLIAM went to meet FRANcis-Joseph ;
and, in the following extract from a report of the scene that occurred
between the KING OF DENMARK’s despoilers, see how prettily they
behaved:—
“The EMPERoR was at the door when the carriages drove up, and received the
KING in his arms. The two monarchs kissed and embraced each other twice in the
healtiest manner, and went up-stairs arm-in-arm.”
Fancy, the two male Eagles billing and cooing like a pair of doves.
Sweet birds! When HERod and PILATE were made friends, perhaps
they kissed one another too; and let us hope that the KING of PRussia
and the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA kissing each other were not JUDAs
kissing JUDAs.

ADMIRAL ROUS'S BUSINESS.
This—from a letter written to the Times by ADMIRAL Rous on the
law of horse-racing with regard to bets—is good:—
“If the owners of the horses engaged at York, Newmarket, Huntingdom, are too
idle to read the Racing Calendar, and to attend to their business, they have nobody
to blame but themselves for not receiving the bets."
If people, are too idle to read the Racing Calendar, one would think
they must be idle indeed., “Too idle, to read the Racing Calendar.”
would do pretty well for a definition of the height of idleness. ...Off the
turf, and out of the stable, and the sporting newspaper-office, the
general opinion will probably be, that the employment of time in reading
the Racing Calendar is, in itself, idle enough. Yet ADMIRAL Rous
describes this sort of idleness as some persons' business. Industrious
and useful members of Society'
For having ventured to make the foregoing observations, Mr. Punch
hopes that he may not be warned off the Course at Newmarket.
TO A CORRESPONDENT
PUNCH, when writing an article, which appeared last week, upon the
subject of Clerical Importunity, had, and could have, before him no
information which should have induced him to exclude mention of the
Clergyman who suggested the endowment of a church at Zermatt. He
as now no reason to change his opinion that there is a better way of
honouring the memory of the brave men who perished on the Matter-
horn. But circumstances have come to his knowledge (and he sin-
cerely thanks a Correspondent both for the matter and the manner of
his communication) which do induce him to regret that he used, in
reference to the . at Zermatt, language which certainly would
not have been employed, had the writer of the article been at all
ºl. with that Clergyman's admirable character, and honourable
antecedents.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SEASONABLE REMONSTRANCE.
IR,-You know me
well enough to be
sure that I am
not a misanthrope;
yet I confess that
- there are times
when I hate the very sight of people. For instance, after some ten months or so
of London whirl and bustle, I feel an utter detestation of the “human face divine,”
as some poet has expressed it. After, working, all that while “in populous city
nt,” as some other poet phrases it, I have a wish to spend my holiday upon some
esert island, where F. live in utter solitude, as Mr. Crusoe had the luck to do,
before he met his black friend Friday. Fagged, flurried, and fatigued as one feels
after the season, one wants to rest, and would be thankful to get away from every-
body. My hospitable friend SMITH is a good fellow enough, but to my mind, in
September, a cock grouse is a better. To quote SHAKSPEARE, slightly altered—
“Oh, happy month that gives me to the Moor."
How I revel in the ease of my flannel shirt, my shooting coat and pair of loose
old knickerbockers! How I exult in my º: from my tyrannous tight hat, and
glory in the freedom of my weather-beaten wide-awake! For me, until November
no more the wretched martyrdom of walking in a chimney-pot; no more the social
misery of making morning calls, or º evening parties. Until then, I can
breakfast in my shirt-sleeves, if I please; and can sit down to my dinner without
having to put on a dress coat and white choker. Qnly they who live in town can
tell the joy one feels in leaving it, and living for a while a life of utter loneliness.
You will pity, then, the sorrows, of a poor young man, when I tell you I have
weakly yielded to my wife, and have agreed to waste this autumn in payin
country visits. Women are, by nature, more gregarious than men, and a mont
or so of solitude is not much to their liking. omehow, wives don’t value as they
ought to do the luxury of sitting in the cottage of a gamekeeper, or the hovel of a
gillie, and waiting for their husbands while the grouse are being slaughtered. Soli-
tude plus fleas is little to their taste; and, after a day's shooting, the best of men
assuredly are not the best of company. So, as married life is a series of com:
promises, I º in expiation of my absence on the Derby Day—I agreed, I
say, most nobly to give §. grouse this autumn, and do penance for a month
or more by visiting a number of my wife's rural relations.
Now, living in a country house is Fº life enough, even when one has a
wife and one's flirting days are over, if one is only suffered to do just what one
likes, and serenely to enjoy the quiet of the country. But, unluckily, when town
fºlk, star about, the provinces, a most unfair advantage is taken of their advent.
Dull and dismal dinners are given in their honour, and dreary evening parties
are attempted for the purpose, it is said, of entertaining them. If you venture a
remonstrance, “Oh '' exclaims your charming hostess, “I must ask a few friends,
or you’d be bored to death with us. You gay Londoners could never live
our humdrum country life. ... Besides, I really wanted an excuse, to give *:::
It is such an age since the HAwkshawes came to see us.” #. AWK-
SHAwºs, as you discover, are the chieftains of a neighbour-
ing tribe, and no chance is ever lost of luring them to visit
your friend's hospitable wigwam. Indeed, you cannot help
suspecting that your presence is the bait throwa out on
this occasion, º that you will be expected to make your-
self fº and to trot out your best talk to entertain
the HAwksHAwes. Avida novitatis est gens rustica, you
find; and although they have no interest in it, the country
folk are greedy for the latest London gossip. So out
must come all your old stories which you know so well
by heart, and have so often told at table during the past
season: and forth must come those brilliant epigrams and
i. sparks of wit, which so repeatedly have served
to light up a dull dinner party. In fact, instead of finding
ou can wear your oldest clothes and let your intellect lie
allow, you have to brush up your dress-coat and to brush
your wits up also.
Now really this is taking a most mean advantage of a
man, and clearly something should be done to put a stop to
such iniquity. "If I can't go to the grouse, I don't mind
going to see SMITH, if his wife will only suffer me to live in
peace and quiet. #at wearied as I am with London work
and worry, I don't want to be trotted out to entertain
SMITH's neighbours, and be expected to amuse them, and
to twist my wits about as though I were a mental acrobat.
One does such work in London, in the season, it is true;
but there one is accustomed to it, moreover there are
other acrobats to bear one company. But in the country
this is not so, and, besides, one's wits want rest, and forcing
them to work then is sheer cruelty to intellect. Moreover,
in the country one is gifted with an appetite, and it is abso-
lute, barbarity to make men talk when they are hungry;
In the country, moreover, one is out shooting all day, and
one comes home more disposed to take a map after one's
dinner than to make oneself agreeable.
So let us keep one's wits for London, and one's withers
for the country; and don’t letus outrage Nature by work:
ing both together. My jokes will be the better, when, I
return to town, for the rest my brains have had ; while
my lungs will have had quite sufficient work to do, in
ºil; to my dogs and tº: “breathers” through the
bean-fields.
In the hope that you will help to save. me from my
friends by publishing this letter, I sign myself,
Yours gratefully, Joseph MILLER JONEs. *

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GUIDE TO BRADSHAW.
CHAPTER IV.-(Continued.)
We will begin with THE CHARING CRoss GALLERY, Admission,
gratis. Admission to Waiting Rooms and Refreshment Rooms, gratis.
No charge is made for persons entering the New Hotel and not
ordering anything. Of the amusements in this Station we will speak
in due course, at present we will deal with pictures only, a ve
profitable business, by the way, in these days of enormous prices an
energetic speculations.
The South Western Side.
No. 1. The Travellers' Bag.—We cannot congratulate MR. Bussy this
year upon his treatment of an admirably
chosen subject. The Tourist has evidently
only just laid aside his bag, and the straps
are falling into a quaint yet gracefulshape.
This is the best º of the picture. The
curves formed by the straps are most
natural and life-like. There is, however,
a want of depth in the colouring that is
eminently unsatisfactory. The artist evi-
º ſºlº dently intends us to understand that the
[º warm light of a beautiful sunset, is rest-
iſiſ ing upon the Tourist's Bag. The idea
so far is excellent, and highly suggestive,
but the colouring is dryſand harsh; and instead of a sunset effect, it
has all the appearance of having been rubbed against a red brick wall.
The lower portion of the picture reminds us of the worst faults of
TURNER, whilst in no part of it can we detect any approach to the
master-touches of that great artist. Let MR. Bussy spend, more time
over his productions; it is a sad thing to see * man of his promise
wasting the paint-box oil in this frittering work.
No. 2. The Corsican Brothers.-This is, perhaps, a reminiscence of
the well-known figures in
the younger KEAN’s pic-
ture, exhibited at the Prin-
cess's. The story is familiar
to all, and great mastery in
drawing or power in paint-
ing could alone reconcileus
to its supernatural horror.
The º quality of
his work cannot be too
highly praised, and the
unity of effect at which MR.
SAMPson has aimed, is not
the least merit of this ex-
traordinary picture. The
moment selected by the
painter is when Fabian feels
the presence of the myste-
rious twin Louis in the look-
ing-glass at his back. The bluish-white toning of the twin linen is
so marvellously rendered, as to faithfully represent, the spectral cha-
racter of the subject, without affrighting the spectator by any unnecessary
prominence of its more repellent features. A choking faint atmosphere
seems to pervade the picture, which belongs neither to night nor
morning. In the lower portion of Fabian's dress, the painter's
dominant yellow is perhaps not altogether irreproachable...We sincerely
hope that the artist will not be satisfied with the Fº excellent
º, it is, but aim at something higher and better in his next
attempt.
No. 6. Families Removing.—A Touching picture of modern patriarchal
--
life. Here MR. Taylor has presented us with one of his
of colouring in the exterior of the van, wherein are stowe
families. In the distance are the cliffs of Sussex and the palm-tree
o’ershadowing the family mansion, whence Paternal and Maternal care
takes the children during the autumnal months. They are evidently
going somewhere else. On a single line of rails on the still sea-shore,
within hearing of the murmuring old ocean of the ancient poets, modern
invention takes its way. The allegory is complete. The unchanging sea
side by side with the variable steam-spirit of the age. The crescent
moon is smiling in the sky, while the last rays of the summer's sun
illumine the horizon. The shadows cast by every one of the wheels
separately, is most life-like, and are evidences of the great care and
attention paid by this rising painter, to the smallest and apparently
most trifling details. We can almost feel the breeze coming across the
bright blue sea, that calls to mind STANFIELD's happiest performances.
There is no want of refinement here, although the intensity of truth
displayed in this picture, proves that the artist is determined to repre-
sent nature, as she represents herself to him. Another instance of his
great faithfulness, is the dress of the cheerful stoker, and his honest
companion the driver. Who would not, without catalogue or other
information, at once recognise in the whitefrocked, neatly capped, light
trousered, cleanly figures, the forms so familiar to all travellers by rail?
There is throughout this work a vital character which speaks volumes,
for painters * to master the difficulties of their art.
No. 10. The Blind Maid.—In treating this domestic subject, which is
merely a girl pulling down the iron blinds in a three windowed room,
if the painter's object is only to give
sensuous pleasure, perfection of work-
* is absolutely essential. But
MR. Wood prides himself upon moral
teaching by means of his art; and the
merit of blind obedience to superiors,
is here beautifully, shown in the con-
duct of the maid, who is evidently
executing her mistress's, or master's
commands. The good confiding giri º
does not reason with herself that it is tº
broad daylight, and therefore to totally
exclude the light and air is unreason-
able and unhealthy; no, her vocation
is to be a servant, and to yield her
services to the requirements of her
employers, “Blind obedience to an ---
Iron Will” is the moral, and should be the title, of MR. Wood's
picture. In regarding the pattern of the carpet, the stick in the hands
of the maid, and the colour of the wall, we cannot but notice too great
an insistance upon, accessories and detail. Aſ the other part is in
subordination, and thereis, we fancy, no danger of MR. Wood becoming
hard and wooden. The girl's head is in admirable º and reminds
us somewhat of MR. SAM. Lawrence's style, that is, if, without any
disparagement to qur present painter, MR. Lawrence's heads were
not simply inimitable.
A Year and a Day.
A NewsPAPER Correspondent, writing from Woolwich, says: —
“The sentence of A. M'Cluskey, private Royal Marines, has been carried out to-
day. He received fifty lashes and one year's imprisonment, with hard labour, for
striking DR Connolly at Melville Hospital."
A sentence of fifty lashes might be carried out in considerably less
than a day; but surely more time than that must be required to carry
out a sentence of one year's imprisonment.

CHARMING PROPOSAL
FOR REDUCING THE PRICE OF BUTCHER'S MEAT.
YESTERDAY morning a Deputation, consisting of MADEMOISELLEs
GwenDoLINE, GERTRUDE, MINNIE, and MAUD, waited on Paterfamilias
in his library, as Head of the Home Department. The Deputation
emanated from a number of very young ladies assembled at LADY
FELICLA Gay's thé dansante, where the present extravagant charges for
weal-cutlets formed the topic of animated and earnest discussion.
The Deputation was received by the Head of the Home Department
with some surprise but much cordiality, and MADEMQISELLE GwBNRO-
LINE having been prompted to speak, commenced reading a beautifully-
written address, on gilt-edged paper, in these words:—“Dear Papa-
I dare say you are rather astonished at this intrusion on your privacy,
but for myself and sisters I can sincerely say that we would not have
invaded this seat of learning, save under peculiar and pressing circum-
stances. (Hear !) For some time º: we have seen with sympathetic
sorrow the distressing effect which the butcher's bill has had upon our
dear Papa, when submitted for his examination and approval. Often
have we been tempted to give expression to our emotions, as our dear
Papa with knitted brow bent over that vexatious and intricate account.
But we hesitated, and were lost, having no knowledge of figures beyond
that which we had acquired in learning a quadrille. (Hear, hear!). So
things went on—went on—[manuscript *} Qh!, I see. To
resume. Woman in all ages, and yall ages, has delighted in self-
sacrifice—witness, suttees in India, crinoline in England, et cetera, et
cetera. . We said to one another, “It is in our power to reduce the
price of sweet-breads by a little—a very little-reduction in one import-
ant particular. Need I say, Papa, that what artillery is to you, milli-
nery is to us? No conquest can be secured without it. e have,
nevertheless, resolved to sacrifice many, many yards of talle, with a
view of shaming into moderation those who are responsible for such
extravagant prices; and if they have one spark of chivalry in them, that
halcyon time will soon arrive, for who could see our forlorn condition,
and not revise his stern tariff, unless, indeed, he should have in addition
to a knife a heart of steel?’” -
The Head of the Home #. acknowledged that he was highly
gratified by this mark of filial devotion, and hoped that a similar spirit
would spread and deepen in every direction. The Deputation were
deserving of much praise. Their readiness to put the lamb before the
lawn, and to forego the flounce to save the fillet, did them infinite
credit. Without ...; to say one word in disparagement, he thought
however, in a matter of this domestic nature they had better stud
ADAM SMITH than Don Quixote, for he humbly confessed that he coul
not yery clearly see any close connection between chivalry and cutlets.
MADEMOISELLE Gwen Doline, having consulted with her companions,
observed that if Papa dear was of that opinion, they would at once
withdraw their pro osition. They were bent, however, on self-denial
in some shape," and so long as yeal continues at its present price,” she
added, “we will touch nothing but chicken and venison.” • Cº-
The Home Department suggested that it would be better for the
Petitioners to revert to their original scheme of retrenchment, although
he smilingly observed, by confining their diet to chicken, they would
alº: have something pleasant, amerry thought, to brighten their repast.
fter some further remarks, of no public interest, the Deputation
having volunteered to serve at any time on a Committee of
ays and
Means, returned cheerfully to their croquet.
TRULY RURAL.
IN A COTTAGE NEAR A WASPS' NEST.
NOTES BY A DISGUSTED WISITOR FROM LONDON.
Morning.—The early bee on my dressing table. Suicide of earwig in
my bath. Have to shake all my clothes to see that nothing has crawled
in during the night. Feel in the toes of my ºf: fith the tongs.
Once knew a man who found a wasp in the toe of his slipper. Repeat
process with boots. -
Breakfast time—First appearance of wasps. Desultory feeding in
consequence. Everything on the table, including napkins, becomes
A. defensive weapon, against the wasps. Some are knocked down.
Uncertainty as to their ...; killed. They crawl and sting. Once
knew a man who was stung through his stockings by a crawling wasp.
Everyone sits like a tailor or Turk on his chair. Ladies nervous.
Pocket, handkerchiefs used for hitting at wasps. Knew a man once
who got a wasp in his pocket handkerchief, and it crept up his nose.
Forget what became of him.
Between Breakfast and Lunch.-Wasps, on the grass. Under the
trees. In the sun, in the shade. Any place on the grass free from
wasps is occupied by ants, or bumblebees. They say bumblebees don't
sting. I tried one. Didn't it. Sit by side of murmuring brook.
Dragonflies, fearful looking creatures that come at you with a whirring
noise. They say they don’t sting. Never tried. Don't intend to.
Junck.-More wasps. Desultory feeding as before. Helping each
other by fits and starts. Hornets join the merry throng. After a time
a queen wasp and a king hornet, to judge by their size. The king
hornet suddenly disappears, it is supposed that he is insidiously on the
carpet. Luncheon finished.
Afternoon.-In the shade flies, small but imitating wasps. In the
sun, wasps and hornets. Horse flies from three till four. ogs try to
catch wasps, and shake their heads for some time afterwards.
Dinner.—A few wasps. King hornet still unaccounted for.
Evening-Cockchafers on the lawn; also Gnats who bite viciously.
Daddy longlegs. Moths of all sizes, in-doors. Bats outside. Toads
on gravel walk. All, except toads, in bed-room. See with tongs if
king hornet is in my slippers. Spider on bed curtains. Daddies whirrin
at once return to my rooms and my Clu
about. Hate country. Shall
in St. James's Street.
LAY OF THE BELL.
WHEN gay, people think me a flirt;
When solemn, they call me a fright:
Some say that brass makes a bell pert,
And when touched my noise deafens them quite.
I care not for merry-go-rounds,
But dearly delight in a swing;
And my ºl. goes j bounds
When a handsome hand gives me a ring.
To me charming fellows have bowed,
Their silver tone sweet as a coo;
Big Ben of his notes was so proud!
And a stir made in Parliament too.
But when Ben had got up in the world,
There was one thing—sound sense, which he lacked
And I found while his lofty lip curled,
Poor Ben was a little bit cracked.
Tom of Oxford once showed me a chain,
And assumed such a serious air,
Though he knew he must single remain,
As must all other odd fellows there.
So spell-bound I foolishly flung
My love to a learned divine;
Who's too fond of each horrid dead tongue,
To like one that’s so lively as mine.
A Valuable Member of American Society.
RECENT advice from America informs us that “the importers,
bankers, and traders of New York, have offered $5,000 reward for the
apprehension of Edward KETCHUM.” A defaulter, whose capture is
considered to be worth, so much as that, must be a precious rogue.
Not a few, perhaps, of MR. KETCHUM's countrymen have been heard to
express the hope that KetchUM will be ketched.

dends of five shillings per cent.

by a desire on the part of more than one influential member of their

THE BISHOP AND THE ELEPHANT.
IMAGINARY CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE RIGHT REV. THE BISHOP OF

The Zoological Gardens. Sunday Afternoon.

you, my Lord. (He

but with admirable
self possession). Iam
sure you are very

are proverbial, and
thoughldon’tcome

Bishop. Don't say

fellow creature, be-
cause Bishops never
flatter. I remember
now, you are the
new elephant from

Plantes, in Paris, come to ornament our beautiful gardens, and to offer
another illustration of the wisdom of creation.
Elephant. Rem acutetigisti, my Lord.
Bishop. Which, bearing in mind the fate of a certain, tailor in the
natural º books, I will certainly not do to your trunk.
Elephant. You are celebrated as one of the best conversationists in
England, my dear Lord, and I am sure that you deserve your reputa-
tion. But confess, now—
Bishop. Confession—though I don’t exactly condemn—you under-
stand—is not exactly what I should—eh?
Elephant. Nobody better understands what the Poet Laureate so
admirably, calls the Falsehood of Extremes, than your Lordship.
Whether there is never a falsehood in the middle, too, is not now the
question. I was only going to say, confess that you were astonished at
hearing me speak.
Bishop. Respectable elephant, I am astonished at nothing. I have
never been astonished once, since the late LoRD CHANCELLOR (whose
talents, however, I am the first to applaud) became the head of the
Christian Young Men's Society.
Elephant. Why, you know what Bethel means in Hebrew:
Bishop. Please don't talk Hebrew. DR, CoLENso (a most ingenious,
and I am sure well-meaning man, however) has given me a distaste for
that tongue. -
hant. He has left in the Werulam for Natal, and I am sure that
your Lordship's best wishes fan his sails—or heat his boiler if the vessel
is a steamer.
Bishop. It must be a steamer, my dear fellow-creature; he would be
unhappy, without hot water. But to revert; I really should have been
surprised at your flow of language, had I not read in the Charivari that
É. have been holding a levée on your departure from Paris, and have
een very witty upon the poor Parisians.
Elephant, “Poor victory, to conquer them,” if I might cite an oratorio.
Bishop. To me, oh, yes. I am not the Bishop of GloucestER, who
thinks it wicked to sing HANDEL in a cathedral.
Elephant, What, would WARBURTON, Bishop of Gloucester, have
said to such twaddle?
. Bishop. Well, he wrote about Moses, but did not precisely imitate
his meekness; and I fear might have used even stronger language than
yours. And you have come to reside permanently with us?
Elephant. I am in residence, my dear Lord; and I assure you that I
am very happy to return to my allegiance to the QUEEN.
Bishop. To return? I imagined that you were French.
Elephant. As times go, I ought to reply that you do me honour.
But 7. a native of Her Majesty's Asiatic dominions, where several
exemplary wives mourn my European captivity.
Bishop. Let us hope that they are comforted.
Elephant. It is not impossible. But the subject is unpleasant. As you
see the Charivari you will have observed that I am depicted as arriving
in England, and indignantly pitching Albion and the British Lion—
types of a proffered naturalisation—to the winds. Another instance of
Gallic contempt for facts, as I need no such ceremony.
Bishop. Our French friends have much esprit, but they are, it must
be owned, horribly ignorant. º that the Lords, in England,
speak from a tribune, and that M.R. GLADSTONE, whose name they
#. “GLALDSTANEs,” is the Lord Chancellor. However, we are close
allies now, and we must avoid facere er elephanto muscam, if you will
forgive the allusion. . . . - -
Elephant. Nºi; said in Latin can be rude, my Lord. I believe
that is a dogma in the freemasonry of the educated.
Bishop. Charmingly put; I am delighted to have conversed with you.
May I ask whether you are any descendant from the elephant men-
tioned in GAY's Fables, to whom an enterprising publisher of the day
offered a handsome sum to write something against orthodoxy P
Elephant. I regret to say that I am.
Bishop. Why regret that you boast so accomplished an ancestor?
Elephant. The fact is, that the golden age of authorship had not
come, nor was a publisher, as now, Astrata incarnate. My relative was
tempted by the bookseller, was cheated, and was—I blush to say it,
reduced in old age to º a monkey about at fairs.
Bishop. Be comforted, for I will quote PALEY to you.
Elephant. An odd quarter to go for comfort.
Bishop. Nay, for even the frigid Archdeacon holds nothing to be
contemptible that ministers to the harmless gratification of many.
Elephant. An elephant, my Lord, is a gentleman, and not a mounte-
bank. Had my ancestor resisted temptation and returned to India, he
might have become executioner at the court of one of the native
princes, and have trampled criminals to death on state holidays.
Bishop. In two senses a truncator.
Elephant. Admirable, my Lord. ... -
Bishop. I do not approve the ambition you manifest, but I sincerely
º; with you in .# humiliation you feel.
Elephant. It is delightful, but not surprising, that a WILBERFoRce
should sympathise with his black fellow-creatures. Talking of that,
my Lord, can it be that the Yankees talk of giving votes to the niggers?
Surely that must be what we call in Paris a canard. -
Bishop. I fear that the news does not come from America by the
Canard line.
Elephant. But is America mad? -
Bishop. Everybody is mad who does anything wrong, and has money
to hire medical witnesses.
Elephant. But this is inconceivable.
Bishop. Well—I don’t know. The negroes are to have their freedom,
and as you know better than I do, the French for freedom is franchise.
Elephant. My dear Lord, give me a better argument than a jest.
Bishop. I would if I could, but in this case I don't know one.
Elephant. A black elector neutralising a white one!
Bishop. You have white balls and black ones at elections—let us be
symmetrical whatever we are.
Elephant. I tell you what, my Lord–you must get me—me—put on
the register for this borough. - -
Bishop, Nothing would give me greater joy and delight, but Peers
are forbidden to meddle with elections. And then really—you are the
descendant of a long line of forest kings—and to elect MR. ToM
CHAMBERs and MR. HARVEY Lewis is a glorious thing, no doubt, and
they are excellent representatives—but I thi
Elephant. But I go upon principle.

Elephant., What SAMBO may become, in three generations, with
training, I don’t say, but at present my education is in advance of his.
A woolly-haired—— -
Bishop. Pardon me, the allusion is beneath you. To fasten on his
hair reminds me that DR. Johnson, in Rejected Addresses, calls you the
half-reasoning parent of combs. -
Elephant. Your reproof is gentle and just, as a Bishop's should be,
and you have learned mildness in practising your rebukes of WESTBURY.
I retract the wool, my own hair is not strictly hyacinthine, but I insist
upon it that at present the nigger is not better qualified for legislation

OUT OF SEASON.
Fact is, FitzRobbins is supposed to BE on The MooRs, And BRAGGLEs has
GIVEN out HE was off on A CRUISE IN STUnsell's YACHF, UNDER THESE CIR-
Cumstances, IT was awkward To MEET suddenly, AT THE CoRNER of A STREET
NEAR Tottenham Court Road, About the Twenty-Eights of August.
OUR YACHT.
WE are on board, but not started, as yet. I have not regularly commenced
Log-keeping, which is, I believe, much the same as Book-keeping, involving a
knowledge of double entry; that is, as regards latitude and longitude. The Com-
modore was very much annoyed at discovering the name that the Owner had given
to the vessel. A Board was held on deck, aft (a nautical phrase explained in
my previous letter), and the opinion of the First Lieutenant and Mate (myself)
taken by the Commodore. . .
The Lieutenant said, it was just like his (the Grocer's) something'd impudence.
The Commodore agreed, and so did I; though not being acquainted with the
usual impudent ways of the Owner, I was, of course, obliged to take the
Lieutenant's word for the resemblance in this particular instance. The Commo-
dore suggested that the name should be painted out....The vessel was, he de-
monstrated, in point of law, ours for the time being. We had hired her by the
week, had we not ? We answered, yes, certainly. The Grocer said, he didn't care
what we called it, on condition that we painted the new name at our own expense.
This was at once done, and yesterday evening the Saucy
Nautilus beamed from the starn, or stern.
We shall get underway (nautical phrase already explained)
to-morrow, certainly. To-day we have been obliged to
discharge the Crew as totally incapacitated for duty, by
his inordinate affection for liquor. He, nearly fell over
the ship's bullocks (“sides of the vessel,” nautical phrase)
in attempting to vindicate his reputation for, sobriety;
(N.B. “Bullocks” is spelt by the Commodore “Bulwarks,”
but the meaning is the same.) The Captain informed us
that he had heard of a most respectable man on shore
who would suit. From all accounts he was a perfect
treasure, lºgº. honest, steady, sober, and a most
excellent cook. Several peo ſeconnected with the shipping
interest corroborated this. He had served on board many
º but all his employers were away at the time (havin
een, in fact, like ourselves, merely temporary yacht-owners
so that a written character was next to impossible. It
could, doubtless, be obtained, if we’d wait. We had better
see the man and judge for ourselves.
The Commodore sent for him this afternoon. The Trea.
sure appeared before us; a red-haired, red-whiskered, middle.
jº man, with a thin prominent nose, a crab-apple sort
of cheek, and light grey eyes. He was dressed in a blue
Jersey, a P-jacket, dark, nautical trousers, and looked (we
all said) every inch a sailor. . He was not given to garrulity,
answering our questions briefly, but with civility. In the
luxury of tobacco he was a ruminating animal. He wore
his tarpaulin hat on the back of his head, touched his fore-
lock when addressing any of us in command, had a blue
anchor tattoo'd on his º hand, never used a pocket-
handkerchief, and, as we all observed for the second time,
was every inch a sailor. His name was WILLIAM,
We engaged him at eighteen shillings a week, giving
the Captain a guinea to keep up the dignity of his station,
WILLIAM said that would do, if the Crew was allowed
rations. The Captain took upon himself the responsibility
of answering in the affirmative, and the Commodore, to
whom I believe the question was quite a novelty, said
that the Crew should have rations, quite as a matter of
course.
The Captain then took the Crew below (“below”
means “down-stairs”) to stow him away in the hold, and
show him the stove and cooking apparatus. In the evening
a lot of coals were brought on board. (N.B. I think this
is what they call “scuttling” a ship. If you do it often,
º can be had up at the Old Bailey for it.) We only
ad one small bag.
With the early dawn we had a cigar and made for
Puffin Island. After dinner, we returned. A lovely night.
Commodore said that I had bettercommence my Log. The
Treasure, WILLIAM, brought a lantern into our cabin.
Before I commenced, the Commodore Fº that we
should arrange our berths. I asked, where were the has-
socks P Soromantic to sleep in swinging hassocks, like
midshipmen., (N.B. It’s “hammocks,” not “hassocks.”
They’re beds slung up in the air by ropes.) They said
that there was no room for hammocks, and showed me
the two dark recesses, like boot-holes, that the Captain had
shown me before, only I thought he was joking. These
sailors are such dogs for fun.
I own that I was a little disappointed, and observed
that even of these recesses there were only two; what was
the third person to do? Keep watch, was the Commo-
dore's answer, as readily as if he'd been in command all
his life. The Lieutenant and Mate always take it in
turn to º: he explained to us. The Lieutenant
positively objected: turn, and turn about, he said, was

fair Fº I expressed myself to the same effect, but did not foresee
much turning about in the berths. -
The Lieutenant immediately, took possession of the starboard-side
berth (nautical phrase for the left or right hand side, according as you
may happen to be standing) and commenced spreading railway rugs
. coats, by way of bed-clothes. The Commodore said that he would
take the first watch, and that I could jump into my berth...At Two
Bells the Lieutenant and Mate should toss who was to relieve him.
(Two bells means, in nautical phraseology, some hour or another,
1 o'clock, I think, which is sounded by bells. We hadn't any on board.
I asked the Commodore, when “two bells” was. He only said, with
an air of surprise, what didn’t I know that ? and went up-stairs.) I was
to keep my Log of the first watch. -
don't know how he managed it so quickly, but by the time the
Commodore had º aloft º e. on deck) the Lieutenant, who
had only taken off his boots and P-jacket, and wrapped himself up in a
couple of railway rugs, was fast asleep, with his head on a carpet-bag
by way of pillow, and snoring deliberately.
So in the gloomy cabin, by the light of a dirty tallow candle, with a
long wick, stuck in an old watchman's lantern, I sat down on a sort of
a bench, jutting out between my berth and the floor, to commence
my Log.
The first thing was to find pens and ink. They were in my small
portmanteau. By º about, I discovered my portmanteau in the
recess called “my berth,” which went much farther back than I had
imagined, and suggested, more than ever, boot-holes, where rats and
black-beetles walk about. If there is a thing I abhor it is a black-beetle;
if a vermin I detest, it is a rat, so I boldly poked my lantern into every
corner of the berth. My scrutiny only showed me cracks where the
obnoxious creatures might crawl up, and I found myself humming that
line in “The Admiral,” where the Tar sings, as if he was proud of it—
“Strange things come up to look at us,
The monsters of the deep.”
Here the Lieutenant snored loudly and moved. I would have given
anything for a little conversation, even if he had only talked in his
sleep; but he only murmured, or rather grunted, and slept as soundly
aS eVer.
I now noticed our deficiency in the way of tables. I would step up
and mention this to the Commodore. On second thoughts as such con-
duct, might show an ignorance of nautical usages, I would place my
Log-book, ink, and lantern on my berth and commence. Here is my
first entry.
“Log of the Saucy Nautilus. Time, ſº on for two bells, say one
bell and a half, i.e. about 11:30. All calm. Very depressing. Cabin
stuffy. Commodore on deck. Hear them talking and moving on deck.
Lieutenant snoring. Feel hot over the eyes, not sleepy, envy Lieu-
tenant. Don't know what to put down. Fancy I heard a rat. Shall

This was my first entry.
FLOWERS FROM “LE FOLLET.”
to merit its name. There
is intelligence, however, in
the following observation
on certain cloaks described
among Fashions for Sep-
tember:-
“A few of these cloaks are
worn with a band and buckle, or
sash outside, but this is a fashion
only adopted by ladies who have
not a just appreciation of the
difference between eccentric and
distingue.”
The readers of Le Follet
might have been told, for
the information of some of
them, what the difference
between eccentric and dis-
tingué is. To be eccentric
is necessarily to be distin-
guished; but we suppose
that distingué, in the dialect
of fashion, means distin-
guished by superiorelegance,
and eccentric distinguished
by singularity alone. We
are not sure, however, that
distingué, in milliners'
French, is not synonymous
with aristocraticin milliners’
- - nglish.
The subjoined paragraph raises a question of interest:—
“A particular description of some toilettes we have seen, worn by or prepared
for some of the reigning duºgantes, will give a better idea of the styles in vogue than
any general ideas on the subject.”
Who are the reigning Alégantes? Is Louis NAPOLEon a Mormonite?
What other reigning &légantes are there than his EMPREss? Is the
QUEEN OF SPAIN a reigning élégante, for º Or do the
reigning élégantes reign only over the fashions? In that case, perhaps,
the less said about them the better.
... We now come tº a passage, relative to a sort of bonnet called the
chapeau empire,” which will please Paterfamilias:–
... Some few milliners have attempted an imitation by means of a straight ribbon
fulled on the bonnet; but this has a very ugly and home-made appearance, and is
never likely to be adopted by any one with pretensions to taste.”
Paterfamilias, with an eye to the notions which Le Follet might
put into the heads of his daughters, will particularly admire the con-
temptuous view of home-made things which it inculcates in conjoinin
home-made, as a term of disparagement, with ugly. Paterfamilias f

OWERLOOKERS OF LINCOLN.
The Pall. Mall Gazette states that “an energetic appeal is about to
be made to the Crown” to allow the erection of “a new episcopal see,
to be formed mainly out of the present extensive diocese of Lincoln.”
Our well posted-up contemporary adds, that “Convocation has more than
once recommended the establishment of the new diocese, and it is
known that the whole of the episcopal bench are in favour of it; ”
moreover, that the Bishop of i. has declared himself willing
“to give up part of his diocese, with the patronage belonging to it, to
the new Bishop of Southwell”—as the see and prelate in contem:
lation are to be named—“if the arrangement can be speedily effected.”
he diocese of Lincoln is certainly a very extensive one. So extensive
is it that a *::: Bishop, fº or overlooker, cannot very well
look over the whole of it. There is indeed a certain personage, who,
according to a popular saying, “looks over Lincoln,” and, at present,
appears to be the only overlooker capable of looking overall fincoln alone.
ut that personage looks over Lincoln from an opposite standpoint to
that of an ecclesiastical overlooker. As it is, he has perhaps the ad-
vantage of a ; Bishop; but no doubt two Bishops would be more
than a match for him.

W.—“From the great success of the º: work on dental surgery, by the same
author, we anticipate the above will be read with avidity by all classes who are
interested in discriminating between pure and meretricious dentistry.”—Soldby, &c."
This announcement was published in the advertising columns of one
of the principal morning papers. That portion of it printed between
inve commas has the appearance of being an extract from a
review, except the name of the review, which does not appear. Now,
in the first p we wonder whether the apparent quotation from some
review of "New work on the Pure Dentistry,” &c., was derived
simply from the preface to that treatise. We wonder, in the next,
whether the foregoing advertisement will appear elsewhere with the
name of a respectable morning paper appended to the quotation which it
contains. For then that quotation will, to the eye wherein there is
green, seem to have been made from a review of the book in that
*Fº paper. ... . -
he anonymous critic, in the advertisement, above copied, speaks of
"classes who are interested in discriminating between pure and mere-
tricious dentistry.” We belong to one of those classes; we belong to
that class which likes to know the meaning of words. What is meant
by pure dentistry we understand. Pure dentistry we conceive to mean
the art of drawing, scaling, filing, and stopping teeth, and supplying the
place of lost natural teeth with artificial teeth on reasonable terms, and
at charges that are not extortionate. But we cannot make out what
meretricious dentistry means. There are ladies, who have taken
º degrees and are practising medicine; but who has ever
eard that any persons of the demi-monde are engaged in the practice of
dental º Meretricious, in its secondary sense, is º: by
false show;” but although the show of factitious palates, gums, and so
forth, outside of certain dentists' doors, may be false, there is a great
mistake in the supposition that many people are allured by it, though
some may be; a few, who must be very great fools.

THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE AT SYDENHAM.
THE following petition to Parliament, representing the Sabbatarian
principles and convictions of that most serious section of the serious
#. the serious publicans, is designed to lie for signature at pot-
ouses and ginshops in and about the Metropolis:—
To the Honourable House of Commons, &c.
The Humble Petition of the Professing Christian Publicans, Hotel
and Tavern Keepers and proprietors of Wine Vaults in fondon
and the neighbourhood, Humbly Sheweth:—
That on Sunday last week about 15,000 persons, shareholders of
the Crystal Palace, with their friends, and the members of the Crystal
Palace share clubs, with their friends also, were admitted to the
palace and grounds by free tickets, thus desecrating the Sabbath, just
as it is desecrated in another quarter of the Metropolis by the fellows
of the Zoological Society, and those select but sinful persons whom they
admit by order to the Zoological Gardens on Sundays.
That the majority of those present at the Crystal Palace on the
said Sunday belonged to the great middle class, the special depositary,
hitherto, of the genuine enlightened British religion.
That notwithstanding the gross sinfulness in the commission whereof
they were engaged, the weather was magnificent. And that all present
seemed to enjoy what they called their privilege, with a truly painful
want of a due sense of the meaning of that word.
That during the afternoon a selection of sacred music was performed
by MR. CowARD on the Grand Organ, to disguise amusement with
the pretence of a devotional celebration.
That after, the performance of the sacred music, a secular address
was delivered by BAXTER LANGLEY in explanation of the principles
ºf the National Sunday League. That the principles of the National
Sunday League were practised by the Directors of the Crystal Palace
Qompany, in admitting, at the suggestion of the said League, into the
Crystal Palace, last j week, a multitude of the wicked, to wit the
Sabbath-breakers aforesaid.
That, on the part of the Crystal Palace Company, or the National
Sunday League, or both, it was announced that a free Sunday admission
to the said Palace would shortly be given to the Letter-carriers of the
Metropolis.
That your petitioners, as faithful men, duly licensed to deal in
spirituous liquors, are therefore, much grieved in spirit at the desecra-
tion of the Sabbath which has been perpetrated, and at the intention
; to perpetrate a similar desecration of that day at the Crystal
alace.
That in the opinion of your petitioners this desecration of the Crystal
Palace is the thin end of the wedge. -
That if crowds of people are allowed to be admitted to the Crystal
Palace by free ticket on Sunday, your Honourable House will next be
called upon, and, will be unable, with any regard to consistency, to
refuse to, allow the National Gallery, the British Museum, and all
#. such institutions to be open on the Sunday likewise to the British
ublic.
That if those places of amusement and instruction were open on
Sundays, great numbers of persons would pass some time in them,
which they now, perhaps, spend in spiritual exercises. And that they
would also keep a considerable amount of money in their pockets which
§. are at present certainly accustomed to spend in spirits, wine, and
eer.
That your petitioners are Y. regardless of the consideration that
popular abstinence on the people's holiday from alcoholic beverages
would in any measure injure the business of your petitioners; but they
are truly afraid it might seriously affect the revenue.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly entreat your Honourable House
by legislative enactment to prohibit for the future those evasive ar-
rangements through which admission to the Crystal Palace may be
obtained on Sundays by free ticket, and, in the interest of the State,
not at all in that of your petitioners, to enact that, whilst public-houses
remain, open on º: public institutions devoted to art, science
and natural history, shall remain closed.
And your petitioners, as in duty bound, and daily accustomea
will ever pray, &c.

CHAPTER W.
Art Notes continued—The Galleries—Rules—Hangers—The Lion—A
Cup of Coffee—Portrait of a Lady—Portraits of two Gentlemen.
EFORE introducing
the Railway Art-stu-
dent to the treasures
of another West-End
A gallery, it will be as
well to mention one
or two circumstances
in connection with
these exhibitions of
ancient Art modern-
ised.
The West Galle-
ries, exclusive of the
Metropolitan under-
ground stations, are
those of . Charing
Cross, Paddington,
Wictoria and Water-
00.
The East are at
Bishopsgate, Lon-
don Bridge, 'Farring.
don Street, and
Fenchurch Street.
The Northern
Galleries at Euston
Square and King's
Cross will also repay
the trouble of a
visit. Admission to all is gratis.
BRApshaw publishes, bound up with his Guide, a catalogue of these
mural decorations, but it is by no means comprehensive or exhaustive;
and by the utter absence in its pages of anything like order or per-
spicuous arrangement, it is almost worse than useless to the inquiring
traveller who is at all pressed for time.
The Pictures are for the most part un-numbered, a defect to which
we call the attention of the exhibitors. Only R.A.'s are privileged to
hang their productions on the station walls. The distinction conferred
upon an artist by the degree of R.A. is that of Railway Advertiser. An
A.R.A. is an Associate of Railway Advertisers. The R.A.’s possess the
right of exhibiting on the Line, and all along the Line: there are no
hangers below the Line.
The reader will now have the goodness to accompany us to the
gallery at the Victoria Station. The first picture that strikes us is
No. 20., Leo the Great.—A majestic head of a grand old lion looks
down disdainfully upon us from out of a thicket of patent taps,
corkscrews, razors, and seven-bladed pocket knives. We have
to blame MR. Mºseley, inasmuch as he has presented so small a
space for fault-finding, the lion's head being all that the artist has per-
mitted us to see. We are sorry that he has not gone the entire animal,
but in what he has given us there is such a depth of colouring, so
admirably, managed, a relation 'twixt light and shade, so careful a
imanipulation specially evident in his handling of the seven-bladed
knife in the right-hand corner, as to evoke from the most severe
critic an involuntary expression of the heartiest admiration. Had
the gradation of the tawny tint between the right eye and the left
nostril been less gradual, the effect of the eye's ferocity would have
been even more striking than it is. We cannot extend our praise to
the instruments of torture, and the weapons of attack with which man
has provided himself, that occupy the foreground of the picture. A.
from any objection that we might be inclined to make to their introduc-
tion, on the score of aesthetical propriety, we shall content ourselves
with remarking, that all impress of local atmosphere about them is
entirely wanting. We will not, however, be unnecessarily severe upon
such an undoubtedly meritorious work as that before us, and shall watch
with increasing interest the progress of a pupil who so worthily follows
in the footsteps of his great master SIR. Edwin LANDSEER.
No. 30. A Qup of Coffee in one Minute.—A Turkish slave magnificently
dressed carrying coffee to the Pasha's visitors. A picturesquely and
originally designed work; but the
details are elaborated to such a
painful extent as to destroy the
freedom requisite in a picture of
this nature. There is Ultra-Pre-
Raphaelitism and uncompromis-
ing bigotry in every fibre of the
ºf: patterned carpet, which the
red Turkish shoes" of the cup-
bearer are indenting. Such in-
sistance on minutiae as this is
false to the true principles of Art,
and is but a representation of
nature as seen through a micro-
scope of extraordinary power.
Some students of this school
affirm that beneath even their ap-
º most trivial productions
ſes a moral; , Minute manipula-
tion is fatal to freedom. MR.
DUNN will not only probably
allow, but actually adopt the
axiom, as a defence of his method
of representing a slave.
Owing to the absence of any
authoritative catalogue, we have - -
assumed the title to be A Cup of Coffee in one Minute, but re-consideration
induces us to prefer The Virtuous Slave as being the person to whom the
description “warranted to keep good in any climate” is meant to Pº:
|T. silver coffee-pot and cup are in keeping with the character of the
|tray which is well imagined, though coloured in too low a key. The
|slave himself is less forcibly conceived, being of the low. Arab type.
|The dress is brilliant, and admirably harmonised;, but, in his treatment
of drapery the painter shows a tendency to elaboration without due
| regard to strict and yaluable accuracy. The picture on the whole is far
|above the average of this year's show. Let not the artist be satisfied
with praise, but persevere and do good service in the cause of Art.
The Portrait of a Lady (MADAME Booth) and two portraits of gen-
tlemen by SANgsTER, R.A., call for no very special notice from us. In

CLIMATE.”
the former the head is well studied, but there is a hard handling, evident
in the violet-strings of the bonnet, that neutralises the otherwise pleasing
effect of the face above them.
MR. SANGSTER’s portraits are too wooden. . The modern dresses,
however, are managed with singular mastery and fidelity.
Pedantry of the Press.
LEADER-whiteRs delight in calling the murrain “the Rinderpest.”
What affectation is this?, Why resort to a German word, when there
is a capital English term already at their fingers' ends? Like sensible
fellows, if they wish to be understood, why don’t they call it simply
“the Cattlelepsy P”

RHYME AND REASON.
MR. Punch - -
iTººled to address you to-day on a subject which
puzzles me much, I must say; for what are we to do, in
this difficult age, when our cooks are superior to onions
and sage; and our housemaids to scrubbing, and dusting
and ºff and won't soil their fingers with soda an
washing? They wait at our tables with retroussé noses, as
though we were something opposed to sweet poses. In
their dress and behaviour they set us at naught, and prove
that civility’s not to be bought. Their upward, strong
march is too much to be borne; shall we open our ranks,
then, and let them pass on? They will find their own level,
where'er that may be, and we a good remedy surely may
see, if o'er the Atlantic's broad billows we look, for the type
of a housemaid, a scullion, or cook. We shall there, too,
see servants, to work on our farms, with coachmen, and
footmen, with calves and º arms; who may dress as
they please, for they’ll ne'er be confounded, with their
masters and mistresses, howe'er surrounded. Towers of
strength are the Darkies to fill up this gap; and we’ll pay
them in wages, instead of the strap.
Use your influence, then, with our dear wise old PAM;
and persuade him to send for some children of HAM,
who’ve been “servants of servants,” as we must all know,
since the time that the Heavens first saw the rainbow.
But if once they set foot on our free English land, they
will rise, with their freedom, and take their own stand;
supported by laws, on which they'd have a claim, dealing
justice to without station or name. America, too,
would owe us a guerdon, for relieving her shoulders of
such a sad burden. The ways and the means of this
movement I’ll leave to your wisdom, dear Punch, but I
really believe, if we live long enough, we shall all of us
See £º. covered with servants as black as can be.
For great rivers begin from a very small spring—and this
feeble idea, though it looks at first queer—may, through
you, as through Fate, take a shape grand and great. For
if you should find that PAM is not inclined to offer a lift
to the º adrift, to the Quakers then turn, I’m sure
they would burn with zeal for a people whom they’ve
always thought equal; if they’d freight a few ships, with
these men with thick lips, and provide them a home,
when to England they come, they’d be welcome, I say, as
the sweet flowers of May, to those who like me, perplexed
Housekeepers be!! JINGLE.

WE’ve dogs and cats for mice and rats,
We’ve gins, and traps, and bane.

That plague with teeth or stings.
At little price, from rats and mice,
The house and barn we free,
Ridfield and wood of rapine's brood,
And beds of bug and flea.
But oh, what cost must needs be lost,
How many brave men too,
Would we keep down the Austrian lown,
Or Prussian thief subdue !
There's no cheap mean, that can be seen,
hich we, while risk we scape,
so employ as to destroy
beasts in human shape.
It is too true all we can do

Is, stick to drill, and arms that kill

R. PUNCH,
According to the newspapers, this country is threatened with
an awful epidemic.
Tobacco-smoke is what the doctors call a disinfectant.
As you meet all sorts of people in railway carriages, amongst them
you may chance to meet with infected people. Come now, old fellow,
isn't that logic f
Very well then. I say let Railway Companies forthwith repeal their
stupid bye-laws against smoking, and alſow fellows to smoke in al
the carriages, only in the first-class carriages to smoke none but first-
class cigars, out of consideration for refined old buffers and sensitive
females; passengers in the second and third-class carriages to smoke
Pickwicks if they like, or common shag. By the way, first-class cigars
are fearfully expensive. They are as dear, by Joye, as butcher's meat,
and their expense is a much greater bore for a fellow than the price of
that is to Paterfamilias. But I am aware that this is an irrelevant
observation, and from the subject of butcher's meat return to my
mutton, that is to say, tobacco, the medicinal use of which, by way of
precaution against contagion, is what no reasonable Board of Directors
can possibly object to. I assure you it is solely on account of anxiety
about the public health and of sincere interest in sanitary science, that
I contend, and want you to support my argument, that with very few
exceptions, such as Church, the healthy practice of smoking ought not
only to be permitted, but encouraged in all places wherever people most
do congregate, especially in Railway Carriages. My years do not
greatly exceed those of discretion, but I have really seen so much life
already, that I feel quite justified in signing myself,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FLINCHING AT ST. MICHAEL’S, SHOREDITCH.
The newly-built Church of St. Michael and All Angels, Shoreditch,
is situated in what is called a low neighbourhood. It does not there-
fore follow that the § who officiate therein are low men, and in
int of fact, they are High Churchmen. Nevertheless, it is possible for
igh Churchmen to be very low fellows, and, for example, to issue an
advertisement of a character so low as the following:-
Cº. WANTED IMMEDIATELY for S. MICHAEL AND ALL
ANGELS, SHOREDITCH. Daily Celebration, and Choral Services, and there-
fore knowledge of Music required. A Priest who will be AFRAID to flinch.
Stipend at present £120.-Address, &c., &c.
Here you have ultra High Churchmanship stooping to puff itself in
exactly the phraseology of the illiterate advertising tradesman and vile
quack. You see the highest Churchmanship in combination with the
lowest style. - -
The foregoing announcement appeared in the Church Times of
August 12. On the 24th of the same month the Bishop QF LONDON
consecrated the Church named in it... The manager, or whatever he
calls himself, of St. Michael's, Shoreditch, advertised for a Priest who
was afraid to flinch, . He got very much more than he bargained
for-an unflinching Bishop. According to the Daily News of August 25
on arriving at the yestry, accompanied by DR. TRAVERs Twiss, an
MR. SHEPPERD, registrar of the diocese of London, and being met by
the Clergy of the district,
“Almost the first words spoken by the Right Rev. Prelate were addressed to the
Rev. C. Lyroad, the incumbent, and had reference to four handsome bouquets on
the altar. The Right Rev. Prelate stated that before the consecration took place
they must be removed."
There was the unflinching Bishop. Where was the Priest that was
to be “afraid to flinch P” The Rev. MR. LYFoRD flinched :-
“MR. LyroRD accordingly sent for the churchwarden, and desired him to take
the flowers away.”
The Bishop of London proceeded to do his episcopal duty without
flinching:-
“The Bishop then surveyed the assembled Clergy, most of whom were habited in
surplices, with richly embroidered stoles. His Lordship said quietly, but sternly,
“The Clergy here of my diocese must appear in the ceremonial of to-day in the
simple dress of Clergymen of the Church of England.'"
Hereupon, indeed, the reverend gentlemen.in, the smart petticoats,
showed some symptoms of being afraid to flinch. With a hesitation
that was quite ladylike—
“At this the Clergy looked at each other very innocently, as though they were at
a loss to comprehend his Lordship's meaning. A somewhat awkward pause ensued,
during which no one stirred."
But the Bishop insisted, and the Clergy presently flinched:–
“Again turning to the Clergy, his Lordship said somewhat peremptorily, ‘I must
ask you to take off those ribbons, gentlemen.' MR. Lyroºp bowed, and at once
removed his stole (a white silk one with rich crimson and gold embroidery), and his
example was followed by the other Clergymen present."
These gentlemen, dressed so remarkably like ladies, were not so much
afraid to flinch from taking their ribbons, off, and perhaps divesting
themselves of Crinoline, as afraid to disobey their Bishop. Having
“peeled” their pretty vestments—
“The Cler
were met by
All’s well that ends well, to borrow the language of a distinguished
dramatist; and all now seemed likely to end well in the quiet consecra-
tion of St. Michael's, Shoreditch. The Clergy, however, evinced just
one more indication of being a little afraid to flinch :-
“So far the large congregation, which numbered pretty nearly one thousand
i. were in the dark as to any hitch having occurred, the scene above detailed
aving taken *. in the vestry; but now an open breach took place. On the stone
reredos behind the communion table there was a rough sketch in charcoal of the
Crucifixion, with the figures of St. Mary and St. John. This seemed to give great
offence to the Bishop, and he asked for an explanation from the incumbent. That
offered did not appear to be satisfactory to his Lordship, and he expressed a wish
that the Cartoon should be at once effaced. It would seem that none of the officials
relished the task, but the Bishop resolutely refused to proceed with the service
until some understanding was come to.”
But the unflinching firmness of the Bishop of LoNDoN ultimately
prevailed over the fear of flinching on the part of the Rev. MR. LyroRD
and his coadjutors, or company:—
“At length his Lordship said, “If you will give an undertaking to efface that
Cartoon I will proceed." MR. LYFord consented to do this, and the Bishop there-
upon instructed DR. T. Twiss to draw up a paper to that effect, saying that the
registrar could read the petition whilst it was being done. DR.T. Twiss accordingly
went to the vestry, and drew up the following memorandum: “We hereby undertake
to remove to-morrow the unfinished Cartoon on the east end of the chancel wall of
the Church of St. Michael and All Angels. August 24, 1865.” DR. Twiss then re-
turned to the chancel, and the document was signed in presence of the congregation
by MR. LyroRD, by MR.THANTER, Churchwarden, and by MR. Brooke, Architect.”
Our unflinching Bishop

ained his point, and the clerical masque-
vertises for a Curate afraid to flinch from
making, a fool of himself, proved to be not only courageous enough to
be capable of flinching, but unconditionally “caved in.” Having made
himself obeyed—
“The º
then said, "I have no objection to consecrate this Church in
accordance wit
the prayer of that petition,' and proceeded with the service.”
In reference to the unflinching determination of the Bishop of
LoNPQN not to countenance a ridiculous display of simious ritualism,
the following piece of impertinence appeared, on August 26, in the
same paper as that in which an asinine incumbent, wanting a Curate,
advertised for “a Priest who will be afraid to flinch: ”—
“St. Michael AND ALL ANGELs, ShoredITch.—This Church was consecrated by
the Bishop of LONDON on Thursday last. We reserve our report until next week,
merely mentioning that the Right Rev. Prelate displayed his iconoclastic propen-
sities in reference to ornaments both of the Church and the Cl , and altogether
behaved both before and during the service with an amount of intolerance and
irreverence which we were shocked to witness."
In saying that when the Bishop of LoNDON ordered a set of clerical
mimes to doff their motley, he “displayed his iconoclastic propensities,”
the Church Times displays considerable proficiency, in penny-a-lining.
Yet the act of destroying the Golden Calf was doubtless iconoclastic,
and the BISHOP OF LONDON must certainly be admitted to have done
much the same thing in dealing, as he did on the consecration of St.
Michael's, Shoreditch, with the ecclesiastical calves attached to that
sacred edifice.
ROMANTIC INCIDENT.
Scene in a Secluded Glen,
Henry. Goodbye, dearest EMILY, we may never meet again. Give
me some love-token, which shall, recall ſº loved image to my
memory, some treasured trifle, which shall remind me always of the
happy past. EMILY, my heart's idol, pray give me a lock of your
beautiful hair?
Emily (deeply affected, and beginning to sob). My darling HENRY, I
cannot—dare not give you a lock of my hair. §ſ, as 1 cannot refuse
you anything, here take-take, my best-beloved, this Chignon instead.
[Ridiculous confusion of Hºnky at having the article in question put

AN ATTRACTION IN THESE DAYS |
At a fashionable watering-place in the North, not twenty miles from
Filey, outside the doors of the miserable Town Hall, where offenders
are tried by istrates in the morning, and audiences are still more
severely tried by performers in the evening, we noticed the three
following placards :—“MAD Dogs.”—“CRUELTY to ANIMALs.”—
“GAVAzzi.” What between the first and third announcements, we
did not in the least wonder at the fact mentioned in the second. Con-
sidering the heat of the weather, and that the “CAUTION" about
muzzling was confined only to the dogs, it was not surprising that the
few visitors, who ventured near the place, hurried on as quickly as
possible. It was quite a panic in the town.
“Faithful Alone among the Faithless found.”
See Times, September 4.
HoNour to ST. ALBAN Hall,
Though the recognition's tardy:
If its number is but small,
There’s no fool among them all;
Not one member polled for HARDY.
AN OBLIGATION BOTH WAYS.
r
THE French are fond of saying “Noblesse oblige,” and so it does
occasionally; as, for instance, when an appreciative Nobleman sends us
up a haunch of venison, or a basket of salmon, or a nice little hamper
#. with every variety of game. In such a case, we, must confess,
Nobility does oblige in a way that is most truly acceptable.
Culinary Security.
Young Lady. Dear me! How stupid! The cook, has been and put
two skewers in this hare. I wonder what that can be for P
A Brute of a Brother. Probably, my dear, to make skewer doubly
skewered P Erit, running.
CURE FOR THE CATTLE PLAGUE.
It is possible that the disease which is now carrying of the cattle, (as
a Scotchman says like Rob Roy) might have been arrested if the bull
had in the first instance been taken by the horns.

Mrs. N. That means that the conditions are Accepted. -
Mr. N. They are frightfully hard, of course, but then consider the

MEMS FROM MANXLAND.
RE #. anxious, dear Punch, to find a retreat
where there are no nigger bands, and not one
barrel-organ * Yes, of course, I know you are,
for everybody must be so whose fate it is to
live in London, and have any brains to work,
and any need to work them. Well, then,
come to Douglas in the Isle of Man, and see the tailless cats and the
monstrous three-legged Manxmen. I have actually been staying a
whole week at this sea-town, and I have not once heard a banjo or a
barrel-organ. - -
Do not dream, however, that if you come to Manxland you will find
no other aural nuisances to plague you. If this were happily the case,
do you think I should be fool enough to advertise the Paradise?
rom the organ-grinding plague, Douglas happily, is free; at least
it was so when I visited it. Nor, although the fish there is capital
and cheap, were there any bellowing Stentors bawling, “Fine fresh
So-holes!” or “Mackreel, four a shillun!” as they do at Brighton,
Hastings, Ramsgate, Lowestoft, Deal, and Yarmouth. One evening,
however, just as I sat down to dinner, a street-band did its utmost
to take away my appetite; and every morning, just at breakfast-
time, my relish for my herring was sadly spoilt § a duet between a
small boy with a horn, upon a shaky, open, wheeled º; that was
called the “Cresent Buss” [sic], and a dog that lived next door to me,
and tried to howl in unison. Then the little natives have just learned the
song of “Slap Bang / Here we are again.'” and you hear them squallin
it at every cottage door and every street corner. How is it that ...;
songs become so popular, I wonder? Once let a tune be whistled
through the streets of London, and every country town in England
within six months will ring with it.
I believe that this annoying song was first imported into Manxland
by the people who swarm thither from the cotton-spinning country.
The natives call them “cotton balls,” and seem to hold them in con-
tempt, although many a Manx pocket is the richer for their coming.
Where they fº the money which they fling about so freely is more
than I can tell; nor have I any notion why they fix on coming to the
Isle of Man to spend it... If the scenery attracts them, they have rather
an odd way of showing their attachment to it. All they seem to do all
day is to ride about in cars, smoking bad tobacco, and playing at All
Fours, and you see them at their ride's end, with the prettiest views
accessible, sitting in inn-yards and playing All Fours stili and this is, I
presume, how they enjoy seeing the scenery. Nearly every man Jack
of them is attended by his JILL, and the girls all play at cards as ever-
lastingly as the men, and join them in singing “Slap Bang!” with great
relish and rejoicing.
I may add that these Slap-Bangers return from their trips often in the
middle of the night; and with their holloaings and howlings they make
the night as hideous as the Foresters did lately, when returning
nocte medid from their Crystal Palace trip, bellowing songs and blowing
horns, and blazing off magnesium wire, to frighten passing horses. A
jisafforesting Commission sat the while I was in Manxland. What a
blessing it would be, thought I, remembering that night, if a Commis-
sion were to sit for disafforesting the Foresters!
Besides flirting, playing All Fours, swigging beer and smoking
“spankers” (a sort of big cigar I saw thusiabelled in the shops), these
rollicking Slap-Bangers have the still further excitement every evening
of a ball, which is given well-nigh gratis to all who choose to go to it.
The ball is an al fresco one, and is held at the pier's end; and although
the floor is stone, and the band a stray accordion, the dancing is kept
up with T. energy and spirit. I think it a great pity such hard-
working honest dancers, have not a better ball-room than this rough
stone pier. Casinos and Cremornes such as London is polluted with
I view with loathing and disgust; but the dancing in Manxland was
mere honest crural exercise, and had not a whit of the foul Casino
flavour in it. WAGABUNDUs.

WAN DER MEERsch.
These birds, if they were taught to play at cards as well as peck at
them, would soon be brought before a Beak, and charged with being card-
sharpers. There is a certain Jaya sparrow that, because of his red poll,
we presume, has neen named “Cardinal;” and this Cardinal is really so
clever with the cards, that we should hardly be surprised to see him, play-
ing double dummy, and clawing his three tricks for a revoke made by his
adversary. , Just ask him for the ace of spades, or any club or diamond
which you have set your heart upon, and º: is off like a bird, and never

thing for the poor creatures to revive their animal spirits. We fancy
there are hundreds of poor agriculturists, who, whether ill or not,
would not mind being subjected to the same “medical treatment;”
only, if they were allowed a choice, they might probably prefer “the
brandy, and the strong ale,” without the gºi

little account to you which shall supply the deficiencies. First, I #.

Physics, Thoughts on Negro Conscription and the Black Draughts;
with remarks on Shaking before Taking. (Dressing-case fitted with
burnt corks for blacking my face; and medicine.)
Econºmic Science. How many Donkeys go to a Village Pound? Also
the process of making a Shilling go as far as Half-a-Crown.
Illustrated by experimental conjuring. § bor of tricks packed
up in a large clothes-basket for doing the STODARE trick. Swords
separate.)
I arrived in Birmingham safely with all my scientific paraphernalia.
Some idiotic friend who doesn't understand these things asked me if I
was going to the Donkey Show? His joke meant, he explained, the
British As-sociation; a low, coarse fellow, whom I only quote to show
you the persecution that Science is exposed to even in these days. , I

that he had got something to say on coals. He proceeded to make a
statement.
PROFEssoRTYNDALL offered to haul MR. JuKEs over the coals for
that remark. (I didn't catch it, though JUREs did.)
The discussion was at its height when it suddenly occurred to me
that I could sing “Old King Cole.” I rose. Shortly afterwards I fired
my pistols, i.i.d with grapes, in the air, and pretended to vanish.
inding another door open, I looked in and said “Bo!” They couldn't
find out who did it, so I then went to the school of
Geology.
SIR. Roperick MURCHISON was saying something about bones.
A Gentleman expressed his opinion that grilled and devilled they
were excellent for supper. I voted for him.

to join them. We idn’t do much. The three gentlemen in the
Scientific Room read papers, but they were º: Times and
other daily papers. I began my composition on Mathematics out
loud, but at the request of the members present deferred my lecture.
I looked in at Geology, who had his coat off and was fast asleep with a

Next day there was a large gathering to hear something about
CANNIBALISM.
PROFEssoR RAwlinson gave us to understand that he shouldn’t like
to be a cannibal. He didn't know any cannibals personally...(I had a
joke about being acquainted with an “Eton Boy,” but couldn’t get it
ready in time.) -
MR. CRAwfuPD said that there had been Scotch cannibals and Irish
cannibals. He insisted that cannibalism was merely a matter of taste.

MR. BLANKs asked why the subject hadn’t been stuck to ?
The President observed that it had been stuck to. - - -
MR. DASH, F.R.S., said he hadn’t heard anyone define cannibalism.

DR. CAMPs replied, that if MR. DASH had only listened, instead of
trying to make Professor KENNETH M KENZIE laugh, by playing Punch
and Judy dolls with his pocket handkerchief, he would have heard
something very much to his advantage.
I rose and commenced my Mathematical Paper.
The President said it hadn't much to do with cannibalism.
I explained that that was the fun of it.
The President said I couldn't read it. -
I said I could. In deference, however, to his wishes, I would begin
my “Physics.” Here I produced a bottle, labelled.

would be “taken.”
I protested ºut their being taken, and proposed that we should

“I, SUPPOSE, my dear, you have come here upon a voyage of conver-
sion | * said an elderly lady to a young one, on the Spa. The only
reply was a triumphant smile of assent.
At the earliest opportunity, we inquired of the elderly lady what was
the meaning of the above mysterious term, “Conversion.” “Why, to
convert a young gentleman.” “Yes, precisely; but to what?”" we
inquired in our simplicity. “ Wº to matrimony, to be sure,” was
the half contemptuous reply. “Do you mean to say, my dear Sir,”
she continued, in a ...; semi-pitying tone, “that you have
lived all this time, and never yet heard that when a young lady visits
Scarborough, it is popularly said that she has gone on “A voyage of
Conversion ?’ and it is pretty generally her own fault, I can assure
you, if before the season is over, she does not manage to convert some
one. And so, young gentleman, I should advise you to look out.”
We acted upon the advice, and left the place instantly.—Mr. Punch's
Unmarried Contributor.
Roo-ey-too-ey!
THE interview between QUEEN VICTORIA and the KING OF PRUssIA
at Darmstadt is stated to have lasted only half-an-hour. Nine-and-
twenty minutes too long; for we cannot imagine what our QUEEN
could have to say except, “You old Fool, why don't you mind what
you are about?” However, that may take some time to translate
into Court German. We are glad that our Sovereign, with her usual
: taste, got out of bad company as quickly as was consistent with
courtesy.

|EAREwell to Port, farewell to Sherry;
Those drinks shall never more be mine.
Henceforth, when I would fain make merry,

A little book by DR. DRUITT,
O all good people, read it through!

How they concoct your Sherry too.

That, chiefly, with their strength inspires;
Those pseudo-winous preparations

The stuff of yore that thou didst guzzle,
too propose to quaff, DE MAPes;
The wine that to thy dying muzzle
Thou wouldst have put, was made of grapes.
Cheap French, Italian, Grecian vintage,
Thank GLADSTONE, I can now obtain.

Exhort JoHN BULL to drink light wine.
LIGHT AND HAIR.
HERE is another brilliant bit of complex calculation, which we take
from the Mechanics' Magazine. It is a pity, that the calculator, in dis-
coursing upon such a subject as Light, should have succeeded in making
it so extremely dark:—
* A writer in Cosmos has calculated the mechanical equivalent of the total
light of the sun. He finds it to amount to something like that of 1,230 septillions of
* bougies,” or to thirty-five billions of tons lifted a billion of kilomètres per second,-
the lifting of thirty-five billions of tons (French), a billion kilometres being about
equal to lifting the weight of the earth twenty feet.”
There, is it not extremely lucid P. We wonder how many billions, or
“septillions” of “bougies” it would require to make clear the meaning
of the above confused compilation of figures? The great safety of these
arithmetical athletes, when they distort themselves by piling up these
absurd heaps of millions and billions, is that no one cares about giving
himself the trouble, either to verify, or disprove them. Qne is bound
to take them for granted, or rather one does not care precisely whether
it requires a billion, more or less, of tallow candles, or bougies, to give
us anything like an equivalent of the light of the Sun, and so the calcu-
lation passes unchallenged. We think BABBAGE himself would sooner
be ground to death by an Italian organ than undertake such an idiotic
Herculean task. It was only the other day that we read about a
German professor having discovered the difference of the number of
hairs on the heads of four young ladies, viz., a blonde, a brunette, a
young lady with red, and another with chesnut hair. We forget who
was the winner of this hair-coursing match, but we should extremely
like to know where were these young ladies’. Mammas all this time,
to allow this inquisitive Professor to be quietly manipulating their
daughters' heads, and not to stop him, and, also, how long he may have
been engaged upon the delicate investigation? Where is the English
Paterfamilias, we ask, who, upon finding a dirty, German. (Professors
are not the cleanest race in the world) playing with his darling EMILY's
ringlets, would take it as a satisfactory excuse to be told that, “he was
merely counting the hairs of her head, in order to solve a problem.” It
is our opinion that the solution of the problem would be the very rapid
cutting off of mein Herr.

The question arises, if punctuality is not guaranteed will the train

Supposing the 8'50 arrives at 8:50, shall I be in time if I go one hour
before or an hour after? -- -
If I go at once shall I be certain? No, Punctuality is not guaranteed!
If I start now and wait for both trains, will one train wait for the
other subsequently?
Will it not be better to stop at home and think?
This is what the O'BRADSHAw would call “Botheration intirely l’”
North countrymen have some right to a property in BRADSHAw.
Their claim is founded upon the following ground. Note the North
British line. Observe that it runs from Aberdeen to London. Mark
closely that the traveller is not requested to º any time at
Dundee, nor Edinburgh, nor Abbotsford, nor Kelso, historically in-
teresting, though they be; no, BRADSHAw has one note, secreted in
the fourth column, charmingly hidden as is the place to which it so
touchingly refers; “Stop,” says the note, “Stop at Nook Pasture on
Saturdays.” Yes, far away from the turmoil of camps, from the busy
mart, BRADSHAw will invite his friends, lovers of solitude and contem.
plation, to join him ...; in Nook Pasture on Saturdays. He
wº.* us here, would hold us bound, would playfully catch us with
a NOOK.
Tenderest reminiscences, probably, draw him to Nook PASTURE.
She has gone, maybe the place has been sadly changed since first our
then gay gallant with his blushing bride, halted on his return from
Gretna, at the humble pasturage!, Happy memories! Let the traveller
by the evening train, to or from the North, stop on Saturday, and shed
a tear of joy to Auld lang Syne and the happy past of Nook Pasture.
This year's August, Edition of BRADsäAw is replete with genuine
humour, and in the little pamphlet accompanying it, entitled “Alterations
in the Main Line,” our author far out-does all his previous efforts. The
notion of publishing a BRADSHAw at all was an idea emanating from a
master-spirit of the º: but the notion of issuing with it a short un-
stitched pamphlet o º one sheet, not easily intelligible and very
easily misunderstood, or lost, was a crowning burst of wit that could
have only º: from one person, and that Prince-Jester, King-
Humourist, and Emperor of Satirists, is, it is needless to say, BRADSHAw.
The opening of the High Level Station at the Crystal Palace, on the
London, Qhatham, and Dover line, was an opportunity not to be
missed, and our author (farceur, that he is!) has made the most of it.
Page 78 commences with a practical joke, suggestive of boisterous
animal spirits, rude health, and BRApshaw out for a holiday. He
takes you to Ludgate Hill with a view to the Crystal Palace, and
Beckenham, if you will, and says he—
“Ludgate Hill to Beckenham at 5% and 7:55 Aft. 1, 2, 3, cl. Stopping.
That is, he induces you to take your ticket and your seat in the train
'* With what en-li
at Ludgate Hill, sees you locked in your carriage, and then cries 1, 2, 3
cl. (this indicates a chuckle) and#. where you are: then off he iſi
run like a merry elfish Puck of Railways as he is. -
The intending visitor to the Crystal Palace will settle by what train
he will go, according to the text of p. 78, &c. But the pamphlet above
alluded to contains errata, which must also be consulted, or all the
arrangements are null and void. Therein will be found that—
“The Train stated to leave Ludgate Hill per Becklew at 18, should be 5-15A .
Should it?, Aye, but is it? And suppose it isn't, why BRADSHAw
catches you there, and if it does, and you have relied upon, his first
statement, why he has you again, and is more jocular over it than ever.
And what does the Gay Deceiver do? He calls, these errata. “The
Companies’ further Alterations after going to Press,” as much as to say,
“Well, my traveller, if you’re taken in don't blame me. But if you
follow my advice, I still say that trains do go at such and such times as
I announced them at first.” - - -
The Company won’t be bound by BRADSHAw, nor will he give up his
liberty to the Company; and if, in another month, BRADSHAw chooses
to publish a third Edition, with his private opinion as to when trains are
likely, or ought to start, what's to prevent him?..
in Page 78 you will findſome or two trains in which the comfort of the
traveller meets with every possible attention as concerns, eating and
drinking. Our kind-hearted, thoughtful author intends a hint to rail-
way authorities when he writes—
“1 & 2 Ordinary to Chatham.”
Qne and two, or from one to two, is a very good time for an ordinary,
which might be elegantly set out in a saloon carriage. This meaning is
delicately conveyed to the Company by BRADSHAw, when he thus
urnishes his own railway table. . - - -
Some commentators would have it that our author joins in the cry
for “More Bishops,” and wishes to suggest to the railway, directors
the institution of so many trains in a day devoted to º use, and
carrying their Lordships' reverences hither and thither in discharge of
their onerous functions. - - -
And now let us stop: for even as we write these lines the glorious
light of an autumnal sun has fallen upon last month's BRApsHAw, lying
helplessly on our arm-chair, in his sere and yellow leaf. He is not ex-
hausted, but we are. He will be bound by no Company, nor will any
Company go to the expense of binding him, and we too will be free.
A bumper a parting, my Guide, my familiar friend; let us quaff the
interior cask, tap for tap, and so part fair. If we have been able to
cheer the confused inquirer, to point the way to wanderers in the
Bradshawian mazes, if we have been in time to prevent the ...;
bachelor, or pale student, from despairingly jumping to a sudden an
unwarrantable conclusion; if we have shown the impatient public that
the difficulties are for the most part only apparent, and that throughout
his work BRADshAw has striven to combine amusement with instruc-
tion, romance with practicality,+then, these few short Chapters have
achieved their object. If they haven’t done this, they haven’t, and
nothing that we can now say will alter the facts. And so, travelling
public, commending you to the ever-laughing philosopher, BRADSHAw,
we bid you heartily farewell. -
Ring the bell. Any more going on? No thank you. That’s the

A GROOM AND A GENTLEMAN.
S (To Mr. Punch.)
IR,
In England every man's house, however, humble, is, as MR.
Cox has said, his castle. The damsel who escaped from her father's
castle, in company with his Master of the Horse, has, you see, Sir,
married that retainer. It is a truism to say that she could not have
done better. Besides, the man of her choice is by no means unlikely to
turn out a very good husband... Let her not be twitted with havin
married a groom; a Groom-in-Waiting is no bad match for a Maid-of-
Honour. There is no material difference, Mr. Punch, between one
groom and another but what it is quite possible, if not very easy, to
remove. Provided that a º is a gentleman by nature, it is only
necessary to educate him, if he wants education, to make him a fit com-
panion for a lady. Now, Sir, this particular groom is very much of a
ntleman. He honourably tried to persuade his lady-love to stay at
ome, and he behaved disinterestedly as to her money. His concern-
ment with that noble animal, the horse, seems to have inspired him
with chivalry. . His father-in-law should now provide him with a private
tutor to teach him the languages and other things which the husband of
a clergyman's daughter ought to know,and the manners and utterance re-
quisite to enable him to converse with bishops, deans, yourself, and other
persons of dignity and fashion. Who, however, knows that he cannot

The Duke of Venice, in Othello, tries to reconcile Brabantio to Des-
demona's marriage with the Moor by the observation that:-
* If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.”
Much the same consolation, Sir, may be suggested to MR. SMITH's
father-in-law. MR. SMITH is evidently a very fair and straightforward
young fellow. There were like to be mulattoes among Brabantio's
grandchildren. No fear of that sort exists in this instance. MR. SMITH
needs now no longer be a groom, except in as far as he is a bridegroom.
Due culture, will render him altogether worthy of the good fortunes
which he had a right to accept; and he would only require polish to
shine in Society, if, instead of Groom, he had been Boots. This remark
may be laughed at, but ought to be attended to, like many observations
made by your humble servant, DULCAMARA.
A SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.
It is curious what bad English is written by good schoolmasters.
Here, for instance, is a specimen:—
DUCATIONAL HOME (half terms), 30 guineas, inclusively, to fill
two vacancies, combining maternal care with a good English and French
education. Eminent masters and laundress.
Now, what are we to understand by this grammarless advertisement?
Pray, is it the “home” which is “to fill two vacancies?” and in what
way can these vacancies combine maternal care with a good education?
Then, we wonder, is the laundress as “eminent” as the masters? and
in what way is her eminence especially displayed? We are as particular
as most people to choose good masters for our children; but we own
we never thought of requiring that their stockings should be eminently
scrubbed, or their flannel waistcoats eminently ironed.
A Cardinal’s Notion of Industry.
CARDINAL ANTONELLI gave a passport to some brigands with the

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON
OUR YACHT.
UT whether it was the lantern,
or the Lieutenant's snoring
that sent me off to sleep, I do
not know, yet somehow or
anotherffelſ into a doze with
my head on the log-book. I
was awoke by the Commodore
calling from the deck to me to
get my companion up, so I
shook him. He was very angry,
and not *ś as it turned
out that I had been requested
to get up the Companion, not,
as I had understood, to get
my companion up. (N.B. The
Companion is a ladder almost
º: leading from the
deck to the cabin.)
The Commodore said he
would turn in now, and that I was to watch... I asked what I was to
watch for? He replied, “Oh, just to get into the way of it.” The Cap-
tain said he would also turn in until they got under way, which they
would do at the very first dawn. -
I was left all alone on deck to keep, the watch. . It was pitch dark,
with the exception of a few lights in the town, and one or two in the
Straits. I fancied myself the Red Rover, and sang a song about “The
Rover is free!” which was stopped by a request from the Commodore, up
the Companion, that I would greatly oblige them below if I would hold my
confounded row, or go for’ard and sing. Qn, going for’ard the Captain
in the “forecassel” objected, solkept the Red Roter to myself. Becom-
ing tired of this, I hummed, “Oh, gaily goes the ship when the rum tum
tum,” which was a version of my own, in consequence of forgetting the
original words. It was getting very cold, so I walked up and down.
A voice from below begged me not to go on, stamping about like that:
It was the Lieutenant’s. “No one,” he said, “could get to sleep if I
kicked up that row overhead; I might have some consideration.”
I thought this a little hard of the Lieutenant, but I sat down with my
back against the entrance to the Companion. I began to wonder if
yachting was such good fun after all, and if this was the sort of way I
was going to spend my nights. About this time. hunger set in
I couldn't get anything without alarming the whole ship's company. f
wished to goodness that I’d slept on shore until we had regularly
started. As a clock at Bangor struck two, I became aware o
the pins and needles in my left leg and foot. As I was compelled to
stretch myself and walk about, I chose the side away from the Lieu-
tenant. Somebody said, “Hollo!”. I pretended not to hear. The
“Hollo” being repeated, I said, “What?” The Commodore said that
it would be better for one (meaning himself) to give up trying to
go to sleep if I was going on like that? - -
“Like what?” I asked, down the Companion, for I was getting
angry.
e explained to me that from the position in which he was placed
in his berth, I was dancing about (as he chose to describe it) on
his nose. How, he put it, would I like to have my nose danced on?
I replied it was pins and needles. He said pins and needles be
hanged. After this I walked about amidships. (N.B. “amidships,”
nautical phrase meaning that portion of the vessel between the forecassel
and the starn) until I was tired, when I sat down in the same position
as before. I determined not to be domineered over any more, and
while I was making up my mind to speak to the Commodore and
Lieutenant seriously to-morrow, I fell fast asleep.
It was daylight when I was awoke by the Lieutenant, the Captain,
and the Crew. I felt very uncomfortable and sticky. Sticky's the
only word I’ve got for it. The Lieutenant said, “I was a nice
fellow, I was, not to call him for his watch.” Call him? Wouldn't
I have called him, if I’d only known it. He said it was no use my
turning in now. f thought I’d just take a snooze for half an hour, and
be quite fresh. He replied very well, so I went down the Companion.
The change from . dress to night dress on board our yacht appeared
to be of the most simple description. It consisted with the Commodore
and Lieutenant, at least, of *i. your boots, coat, collar, and
braces, and there you were. The Lieutenant had put his carpet-b
away, so I couldn't have that for a pillow. The Commodore had place
my portmanteau and a folded, rug under his own head, so I was left to
invent another novelty in bed furniture.
A small barrel lying in a corner was the very thing. It did not
add much to my comfort to find that the barrel was labelled in
white letters—GUNPowDER. On second thoughts I put it outside the
doorway, where the Commodore subsequently fell over it, and swore
dreadfully on account of his shins. My ingenuity being exhausted, I
rolled up my Pjacket, put it under my head, but it was no good; it
never would accommodate itself to being a pillow, and kept its buttons
in the most prominent position, whether inside or out. It seemed to be
all inequalities, on account of the obstinacy displayed by the sleeves;
Rolled up tight, it was too small; folded loosely, it was too large: and
in either case equally uncomfortable.
“What a fidget you are,” growled the Commodore on my portman:
teau. “Why don't you sleep?” Sleep?. My Pjacket said what
the voice did to Macbeth. I was commencing this apt quotation, to
the Commodore, when he said, “Oh, bother Macbeth,” and wished that
I could be quiet just for one moment. I’d been making a row, all night,
he complained, and trying to disturb people. I said nothing, but deter-
mined, for the second time, that I’d remonstrate with him and the Lieu-
tenant quietly in the morning. -
. To sit upright, or to lift your head six inches above the pillow, was
impossible without coming bump against the ceiling, I mean the boards
of the deck, from which my nose was not more than three inches
distant, so that I could now perfectly understand the Commodore's
complaint, in fact, I was very soon obliged to make it myself, as there
was somebody stamping just on the tip of my nose. -
“You mustn't mindalittle walking about, now,” said the Lieutenant
from the deck; “because, we’re going to get under way. You ought
to have slept 'before.” That i ought to have slept before was evident
for there was no chance of it now. They were all walking up and
down (for the Commodore had fallen up-stairs and gone on deck;
while the Lieutenant was speaking), and then came a rolling sort of
noise, accompanied by a thudding just above my face, then a drop, or
two of water trickled through the cracks above. I went up-stairs,
I mean up the Companion. The Treasure was mopping the ship.
The Captain was in the bows washing his face in a pail.
By the way, our arrangements for baths and washing, on or below
deck, were not luxurious. As I really could not exist without my hip
bath in the morning, I had brought it on board, and as it was too big
for the cabin, I was obliged to take it on deck, and be as quick as
ossible about it, on account of our proximity to Bangor, and other
oats. Bangor, however, collectively, does not rise early, and there
was no one aboard the other boats. The knowledge that I was, as it
were, bathing at my peril might have added a zest to some men's enjoy-
ment; in my case it merely took away the greater part of my pleasure.
The Commodore said we must be prepared to rough it a little. I
.# to myself “as little as possible;” but merely observed, yes,
roughing it wasn't bad fun., Aſter this, Iscarcely liked to complain of
being hungry; I was, though, very. The Commodore offered me a nip
of some brandy which he was drinking out of a flask. . . -
He said that it would do me good; all sailors took it as rations.
It appeared that this information was given by the Treasure of
a Crew, and further that he and the Captain had had their rations
served out by the Commodore already. Seeing some smoke ..";
from the chimney which was attached to the stove in the forecassel,
was told that the Treasure was cooking breakfast. I felt curious to
know how cooking was managed on board a vessel, and went for’ard to
learn. I had to look down the forecassel companion; there was a mixed
smell of grease, coffee, and fried fish. All that I could see was the
Crew's legs. -
It appeared that the forecassel being too small to admit of the Cook
and the utensils, such as pan, coffee-pots, &c. at the same time, the
Treasure had to leave his legs outside, so to speak, while the rest of his
. did the cooking in this cupboard sort of a cabin. . Although the
smoke had a chimney all to itself, it preferred coming out from
different parts of the stove, and hanging about the cabin, so, that the
upper part of our Treasure was entirely lost to view, and all I could
see was a pair of dirty-white trousers waiting outside for the return of
the body with the breakfast.
I returned from this sight hungrier than before... The Commodore
was examining my Log. here, he asked, was our latitude and longi-
tude? when did the Lieutenant take his turn on deck? how was the
wind? and how about Greenwich time and probable weather?
I was obliged to confess that latitude and longitude had always
puzzled me, and that Greenwich time was another difficulty. How
people managed to be always right wherever, they were by Greenwich
time bothered me, and I owned it. As to the wind I could; I confl-
dently said, always tell that by holding up my º;
but #. were some winds that were uncertain. That the Lieutenant's
watch was not down was owing º - -
Here the Captain announced breakfast as ready in the cabin, and we
went down the Companion.

an original writer get from these sources. And I ought to add, that
the heartlessness that can call on a contributor taking his brief holiday,
for any kind of work is, I would fain . rare. But as I do not
bathe, because I am afraid to leave my valuable jewellery at home or
in a machine. (American burglars are conscientiously, visiting all, the
houses, and, disguised in bathing-gowns, pop into your bathing-machine
the moment you take your header), and remain at home while my family
is in the sea, I may as well send you a few lines of the sort of writing
which you may call Pre-Raphaelite, graphic, photographic, or what you
please. Use the letter or not, as you # * 's one to me, while I can
get a cigar and iced Seltzer.
I perceive that some, other young man wrote last week a frivolous
column, evidently intended to record the chatter of some young lady
here. It has given great offence, and I am very glad that I was not the
author. The folkson, the Spa, Spaw, Spar, or Spay (Yorkshire pro-
nunciation is charmingly unfettered) consider themselves the cream of
fashion; and the manufacturing swells, with their honest big hands
agonising in yellow gloves, will make short work with that other cor.
respondent, should he be detected. But I dare say that he has sneaked
away... I hope that he has paid his bill, extortionate though it probably
is. For the Scarborough folk devote themselyes with Apollo-like
energy to the duty of skinning the metropolitan Marsyas. The washer-
women here are the worst in all the world, the dearest, and the most
impudent. I advise ladies to bring, no matter at what cost, all the
garments for which language has no name, in sufficient quantity to
enable them, aided by the lady's-maid, to defy the coarse-handed old
harpies. Rents are awful, but the manufacturers are rich and the me-
tropolitans are foolish. You can get a very comfortable back bed-
room, however, without a view of the sea, for four guineas and a half,
though, if a handle comes off the rickety chest of drawers, you are
charged fourteen-and-sixpence for glue to fasten it on, and abused into
the bargain.
Still, Scarborough is a delightful place, or my own sweet temper
makes all places delightful to me. The bay is pretty, and dear SIR
Joseph PAxton laid out the cliff and Spa to perfection. I never con-
descended to come here before, but I am not sorry to have seen the
§: Having, as you are aware, resided in Paris, Vienna, Berlin,
onstantinople, Grand Cairo, and Gravesend, I am not likely to be
enthusiastic about a third-rate watering-place, crammed with bumpkins.
But it is a pleasing locality. SHAKSPEARE alludes to it in that exqui-
sitely plaintive and touching song sung by Desdemona in her grief:-
“My mother had a maid called BARBARA,
Who afterwards was cook at Scarborough.”
Her history is a legend of the place, and she is buried in Cornelian
Bay, near here, and so called after CoRNELIUs the Centurion, who
landed there with the Eleventh Light Praetorians Blue, in the reign of
TITUs, the Delight of Mankind, and Slayer of Jews. But there is
nothing except the Bay and the Spay. There are no walks, and the
roads are so. º: that no person of ordinary humanity drives.
I may mention Oliver's Mount, a promontory, on the top of which
rather good ginger-beer is sold. There is a harbour, but he who has
smelt it once smells it, all day, and never again. There are boats, but
the owners hate a gentleman for trying to hire one, and prefer to crowd
their dirty vessels with F. called “Cheap Trippers,” who go to sea
in complete black and beaver hats, lark uproariously until just out of

the bay, and then are feloniously sick... I have said that I do not bathe,
| but some º: do, and complain bitterly of the ramshackle machines.
I cannot think how folks can be so discontented and uncharitable.
Your other and frivolous correspondent has described the Spa, and, I
must admit, .# though sarcastically, and I shall not, attempt to
gild his refined gold. He scarcely mentioned the Music Hall. It is a
good one. When there is good music given there, or an intellectual
entertainment, a few people Comº, and the windows are left open, so
that the ventilation is good. When mountebanks appear, or people
with black faces, who jabber negro-jargon, and solemnly emit the
oldest conundrums, the hall is crammed to suffocation by an audience
that shrieks with delight, and the windows are hermetically sealed and
curtained, lest an outsider should get a glimpse of the delicious show,
and then you have a headache which lasts two days... I am an ultra-
reformer, but my eagerness to extend the suffrage, is rather rudel
checked when I hear two thousand fools yelling with ecstasy at suc
things as amuse us here. I believe, however, that a majority of these
fools have the suffrage, and, on second thoughts, I ask myself, how. I
could do wrong in giving it to anybody else? The answer I receive is,
that one does not come to Scarborough to solve political problems.
I am a great lover of the Equestrian Drama, my dear Mr. Punch,
except when it is vulgarised by indecent she-Jews, and I am happy to
say that, there is a very good Circus here, to which I greatly resort.
I think that the excellent Clown, a gentleman named FRANKs, knows
me by this time, and specially addresses his best epigrams to me. He
looked at me yesterday when he said that he had never seen a man with
a more expressive counting-house. ...I regret that he takes an unfavour-
able view of matrimony, which, with all its faults and tyrannies, is the
keystone of civilised society, and I do not think that he should narrate,
in public, his domestic grievances. But he and I have many feelings in
common, as he may have seen by my eye. This Circus is meat and
drink to me, panem et Circenses. You will correct the Latin, if wrong,
as I have not my dictionary of quotations.
There is also a theatre here. I am not fond of the theatre, because
MRs. EPICURUs will always take her children, or her sisters, or her
lady friend (until quarrel) and I am excluded from a front seat. But I
am informed that the Manager, Miss Hickson, is full of talent, and the
critic of the Scarborough Gazette further informs me that the perform-
ances are excellent... As this gentleman is evidently a writer of a high
order, and as his notices sparkle with gems which ought, to have long
since attracted the notice of the London editors, I shall insert a few
lines from his criticism on the Hidden Hand, a piece of much merit:-
“We will refrain from giving the plot as it frequently mars the pleasure of an
intended observer—suffice it to say the realistic characteristics are in every way
perfect. Miss Hickson's Lady Penarvon, though to our mind an ungracious character,
was rendered with that propriety.and artistic finish, that she carried the sympathies
of the public entirely with her. Mr. Smith's impersonation of the Lord had all that
decision of manner that so happily marks his style of performance and is at all times
so agreeable. The next character we should advert to is Mr. Mark Moss Mellor's
Thadock—here is a creation in which the actor revels, for not restrained by conven-
tional rules he is at liberty to give his own interpretation of the part. Mr. Mellor
seemed perfectly to enter into the spirit of the scene, and his execution was equal
to the conception, both of which partook of the true spirit, and the result left
nothing further to be desired. Miss C. Burchell's Enid was one of those realizations
that commands the respect and admiration of all. Miss Mandlebert as Muriel was
certainly in one sense out of her way, but not as regards the public, for they were
with her in every sense. The getting up of the piece is a coup d'oeil; and whether
the greatest praise is due to Mr. Small, artist; Mr. Sullivan, who so artistically
manipulates the lime light by which such great results arise; Mr. Smith, the
stage manager: or to Miss Hickson, whose presiding taste has given a vitality to
what might have been barren, waste, and unproductive, we pause to determine. To
conclude, were we not restrained by space from making further remark, we should
record a most meritorious debut made on Monday last by Miss Linda, as Gertrude,
in Loan of a Lover. We hope to see her on some future occasion, when we will do
full justice to her efforts, for she has a grace that many possessing the line of
lousiness she is now entering (namely, the Soubrettes) suffers from—vulgarity—
which this lady, we are happy to say, is quite clear of.”
I do not agree with him that the plot of a}. mars the pleasure of
an intended observer, nor, as the Hidden Hand was written by a friend
of my own, can I allow (in public) that it could under any circumstances
be barren, waste, or unproductive. But I will not cavil at specks
when transcribing such a beautiful passage. It is not wonderfuſ that
dramatic art and artists are so eminent when so much discriminating
and intellectual criticism comes to their assistance.
. It is difficult to do justice, by means of photography, to my expres-
sive features, and I had resolved never again to stare into a camera. I
was told that there was a first-rate photographer here, and that I ought
to sit to him. I refused. If he fail, I said, a worthy man will be
mortified, and why should I mortify him? if he succeed, I said, I
shall make his fortune, and why should Imake the fortune of a stranger?
My wife, innocent babes, and emphatic mother-in-law implored me in
vain. I was CoRIOLANUs. But when I heard that the artist in question
had in the first place made his fortune, and erected a palatial studio,
and in the second that he was a truly brave gentleman, who, on an
awful day of storm, not to be forgotten here (when LöRD CHARLEs
BEAUCLERC and other noble fellows, who sought to save some wrecked
sailors were themselves swept away to death) had dashed into the sea
to give aid, and had been brought out insensible after his gallant effort,
| I said that I would go and see a brave man. And I went to shake
| hands with MR. SARONY. I beheld his well-earned medals, and I
scarcely escaped with life from the crowd of Yorkshire beauties who
besieged the saloon, but I divided my large heart among them, and ran
up into the sun-chamber. The likeness is proclaimed by all who know
me to be a triumph., I, seem, myself, to miss something of the noble
expression, J. thoughtfulness, pensive yet playful smile, and
phrenological perfection which I possess; but if those who love me are
satisfied, I am debtor to the brave SARöNY. Which fact reminds me
that there are life-boats here, and much are they needed, and if the
thousands who come here to amuse themselves by watching the Ocean
had ſº enough to pay for the sight by sending a trifle to the Boat
Fund, they would sleep the better on a stormy night.
My family has returned, and clamour to me to come and lunch. I will
grant their request, for the sun has come round to my window, and the
glass is at 90'. I have thought of leaving this Scarborough, but what
does it matter where one is baked P Still, do not rely on me for regular
contributions, for we are not far from York, and York is on the road to
the Caledonian Canal, which seems to suggest something of coolness.
So, you will say, with questionable wit, does this intimation. I care
not. Stocks have fallen, not so the respect and esteem with which I
have the honour to subscribe myself,

in the Church Times. It contains the Contents of the Englishman's
Magazine for September, 1865. Article, No. 4, is entitled “Mediaeval

Mediaeval research is, no doubt, fascinating, and to some degree
rofitable; but we feel sure that the abovenamed article will present
ut few attractions to the readers of the Church Times, who in Book-
making, as in other respects, are harmless as doves. We therefore beg
to recommend the production to those who possess more of the wisdom
of the serpent, the readers of Bell’s Life. “Mediaeval Bookmaking”
will doubtless furnish useful hints in sharp practice and general

§E.
HOW THE SNOBS WERE SERVED AT THE SEASIDE.
THE HEIGHT OF INGENUITY.
THE subjoined paragraph, extracted from a contemporary, is at least
as good a substitute for news as the description of the monstrous
pippin or immense cabbage just now in season:-
“’NGENIous DEvice.—A gentleman near Wareham, in Dorset, who has a small
field in which there are crops of carrots and mangold wurzel, with which hares and
rabbits have been making free, has put a dog's house in the field for the accommoda-
tion of a small puppy. The puppy is loose by day, and he barks all night long. This
effectually scares away the hares and rabbits.”
Wonderful! A device hardly less ingenious than that above detailed
is rather generally adopted by farmers for the purpose of driving away
the sparrows that come to devour their crops. They provide a small
clown, or an aged rustic, with an old gun and a little gunpowder,
instructing him to charge the firearm with a small quantity of that
explosive substance, and keep letting it off from time to time. Another
expedient, almost equally clever, is one which some gardeners are used
to practise during the summer to frighten the small birds off from
eating the fruit. It is their wont to station in the cherry-trees, or
among the raspberry canes, or the gooseberry and currant bushes, a
figure resembling GUY FAwkes with a short pipe in his mouth; the
arms of the effigy being sometimes jointed, so as, when the wind blows,
to be moved about by it. The device of setting a puppy to run about
a field by day, and chaining it up in a kennel there to bark at night,
however, is certainly somewhat more ingenious than the establishment
of a scarecrow; which is of no use whatever at night, and does not
terrify hares and rabbits.
But, in truth, the interest of the intelligence, comprised in the fore-
going statement, lies in another direction than the quarter in which it
seems to point., The fact that a little dog, chained up in a field and
barking all night, effectually scares away hares and rabbits, has no
doubt an importance of its own, which is not to be underrated. But
that fact is one capable of being regarded in quite a different light than
that wherein it presents itself to the . mind. The puppy
which, chained up in a field, barks all night, and effectually scares hares
and rabbits, does, when chained up all night in a yard, bark in like
manner, and effectually deprive everybody in its neighbourhood of
sleep. . The proper place for such a little beast to be chained up in is
the middle of a field, where, if it does no good by scaring away hares
and rabbits, it does no harm by destroying anybody's night's rest. It
is much to be wished that all persons who keep noisy curs had the
ingenuity, as well as the goodness, to prevent them from murdering
their neighbour's sleep by the admirable device of chaining them up in
the middle of a field.
YORKSHIRE CAUTION.
“Why, my dear fellow, how is it{." are not at the St. Leger? I
thought you lived at Doncaster?” said a friend, unexpectedly meeting
another on the promenade at Filey Bay.
“Yes, and so I do,” was the reply, “but the fact is, I am at present
a forlorn, melancholy exile. It’s true I rent a drawing-room floor b
the year in Doncaster; but there is a clause in the agreement that
am always to turn out during the racing week. During that week the
people of the house make nearly as much as I pay them during the
remainder of the year. That is, why you see me, here. This is the
fourth day of my banishment, and if you have any charity in your soul,
you will invite me home to dinner, and comfort me in the best way you
can.”
* HAVE YOU READ HIS SPEECH "
THE BISHOP of Oxford may, if he likes, allege the Cattle disease
to be a punishment on the English because they have not subscribed
sufficiently to the memorial to the late PRINCE Consort; but foreign
cattle are also diseased, and even the unctuous SAMUEL will hardly say
that Continental Europe was bound to aid in erecting that monument.
We fear that he must discover another crime, if he is resolved to go
beyond natural causes. Meantime it is clear that if oil-cake will do our
beasts any good, we know where to go for any amount of oiliness.

AT Boulogne-sur-Mer a Statue to DR, JENNER has recently been

answered, “Jenner sais pas.”

MEMS FROM MANXLAND.
EAR PUNCH,-You,
who know every-
thing, of course
are well aware
that the Arms of
Man are legs, and
that these are
three in number.
“Quocumque je-
certs stalit” is
- - the motto of the
Manxman. Whether the natives of the island have a more than con:lion aptitude
for falling on their feet, wherever fate may throw them, is more than I can say.
The possession of a third leg seems to favour the idea, and many of the Manx §
as far as I could learn, are persons of good standing. I pictured to myself a Manx
boy with three legs turning “Catherine-Wheels” by dozens, with the help of his
ten fingers and his fifteen toes; and I thought how handy he would find his extra
limb to be at football, though at cricket it would somewhat increase his chance of
being put out “ leg before wicket.” By the way, is this third leg of theirs a left
one or a right one? How a biped London bootmaker would stare at being asked
to sell a pair and half of shoes! And what would STULTz, I wonder, charge to
make a leash of trousers?
But these are idle ſancies. However numerous they may have been in good King
ORRY's reign, the triped Manxmen nowadays are just as scarce as dodos. So far as
I could learn, too, the tailless cats are dying out. only saw a couple of them
while I was in Manxland, and these º had suffered artificial decaudation.
The cats I mostly saw there were like the Ghost in Hamlet, and “could a tail
unfold” as well as cats in general. So I fear the tailless tribe will soon become
extinct, and naturalists will class them with “griffins and King's Arms,” and
the other “fabulous animals” that Mr. Weller ºff. of.
The mention of rare animals reminds me that I did not see a tipsy man in Manx-
land, though the facilities are great there for getting cheap strong drink. There is
less duty upon alcohol than is imposed in England, and what would buy here half
a quartern would there purchase half a quart. You get a pint of Dublin stout in
bottle for five halfpence, and they charge you only threepence for a bottled pint of
Bass. Wine is low-priced also, and every grocer sells it, and you see “fine fruity
ort” announced at one-and-six per bottle, and “rare old crusted ditto” as
ow as two-and-nine. About the age of this “old ditto” I confess I have my
doubts, for I chanced one day to get a peep behind the scenes. At a certain Manx
hotel, whose name wild zebras should not draw from me, I one day, while I was
paying for refreshment at the bar, beheld a, bottle of old port brought from the
cellar in a jug, and thence poured into a bottle, and so served up with dessert. I
have often drunk draught porter, but I never drank, draught port: and how my
head and health would stand it is more than I can tell. I once heard of a farmer
who, being unused to port wine drinking, complained of a slight headache after his
first bout of it, and owned to some surprise at this unusual result; for, being a
careful man, he was sure he “didn't take much more nor half-a-gallon of it.”
Perhaps the wine which so upset him had likewise been brought up from the cellar
in a jug, and this may have been the reason why his brains had been affected by it.
When next I visit Manxland, I certainly shall hesitate in ordering old port,
lest I get some which has been as long as ten minutes in bottle, and which,
for aught that I can tell, may then be viewed as rare
old wine.
You are aware, no doubt, that Manxmen enjoy the splen-
did privilege of making their own laws, and that an Act of
Parliament with them has no authority until it has been
“promulgated ” at Tynwald Hill, a place not far from
Castletown, the Westminster of Man. Thither at set
times, in solemn slow procession, come the constables and
coroners, and councillors and clergy, and House of Keys,
and parish captains (are they beadles, do you think?) with
his Grace the Lord Bishop and his Excellency the
LIEUTENANT-Governor, and there they promulgate the
acts of Tynwald by reading out their titles and their mar-
ginal notes. Formerly, the Acts were all read through in
ertenso, and being composed with the usual verbosity of
lawyers, they occupied a day or more in being thus read
forth. The fast Act thus * promulgated ” was this summer
spouted out by His Honour DeemstER DRINkwater,
who, by the time he ended it, must have found his mouth,
I fancy, water for some drink. The Act which he then
read was entitled in Manx º “Slatty's son caghlaa
yn aght jey Fockley magh slattysyn Tynwald,” which you
will see, at half a glance, simply means, “An Act to, alter
the mode of promulgating Acts of Tynwald,” by rendering
needless the extended reading aforesaid. I wonder how
many more years will pass before we find there has been
º “An Act to Render Needless the Tynwald
Court and Acts of Tynwald,” to be followed by “An Act
to Do Without the Governor, Exterminate the Council,
and Shut Up the IIouse of Keys.” What horrible. Manx
names I may be called for this suggestion I tremble to con-
ceive; but I own I can’t help fancying that, were the
Manxlanders to condescend to rank as common English-
men, their interests would be better served by, sending
Members to St. Stephen's, than by their excellent Go.
wer Nok Loch, and, “not to speak profanely,” all the
whole bunch of the Keys. Could Manxland pardon the in-
dignity of being, spoken of as Manxshire, and put up with
the affront of being treated and regarded as a simple
English county, the Manxshiremen would soon find English
capital flow in for them more freely than it now does, and
supposing that they felt their hearts made heavy by, the
change, they would be consoled by feeling their pockets
heavy too. - - -
It may seem a trifle bold in me to venture this opinion,
and prematurely .#: the benefits of change; 'Let
well alone,” is a good old-fashioned maxim, and with all the
disadvantage of not being wholly English, the Manxlanders
don’t do so badly after all. Indeed, in many points they
are a people to be envied even by ourselves. . They have

to bring all his game with him.
FURIOUS DRIVING.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, - -
WILL you obligē me by fulminating a red-hot invective or two
against the present practice of nurses furiously driving P I allude to
the reckless way in which they push their perambulators along. I can
assure you it is not safe to walk in the streets. I was nearly run over
esterday. A big, brawny, blundering Irish girl came galloping along,
ooking all the while of course behind her, and the consequence was
that the heavy machine, with two fat babies inside, went with all its
weight over first one boot, and then over the other, and nearly crushed
all the toes I had inside them. It was a mercy I was not upset, and
killed on the spot. The pace was so terrific, that I was forcibly re-
minded of one of those Pickford's vans, by which, we hear, so many
accidents are caused every day.
Now, Sir, I am subject to the gout, and shouldn't in the least wonder
if this accident brought on an incipient attack of that most terrible of
all diseases. I suppose that when LoRD DeRBY, or LoRD PALMERston,
has his toes crushed in a similar manner, the Legislature will begin to
lend an ear to our cries, and to devise some remedy for our sufferings.
In the meantime, I propose that every perambulator should be com-
pelled to carry a badge and a number, precisely like a regular cab, so
that when an accident occurs from furious driving, the owner may be
summoned, and compensation recovered for the injury committed.
Railways, omnibuses, carts are subject to such penalties, and I ask
why should perambulators be allowed to escape with impunity? In my
instance, my claim would not be short, of £500 for the pain and im-
prisonment I shall infallibly have to undergo.
I am, Sir, yours, laid up in ordinary and flannel,
OLD HobbLER.
P.S. Recollect, Sir, the danger is all the greater, because it is so little
apprehended on the pavement, where one is accustomed to walk leisurely
ong, little expecting to be run over, or knocked down, or trampled
upon. But some of these nurses are regular Wan Demonesses, in their
way ! Pray put a stop to their wild career.
NURSING EXTRAORDINARY.
We witnessed a curious scene in a London Court. There were ten
fi. each .."; a baby; The united ages of the ten babies might
ave been about fifteen. And what might have been the united ages of
those who were carrying them?, Certainly, not more than forty-five or
fifty. In many poor, families, it would seem that a girl is no sooner
fit to carry herself, than she is sent out to carry some one younger
than, she is. In a household where the door can scarcely be shut
(as the saying is) from the number of children that are inside, a girl
is, from the above reason, much more serviceable than a boy.
boy cannot nurse his jº. brothers and sisters, whereas a girl takes
to it instinctively, and apparently takes a great pleasure in doing it.
It is her plaything—about the º one that necessity allows her. In
this way, girls in a court of St. Giles's have the advantage over girls of
the Court of St. James's, inasmuch as they play at Mothers with real
children. If we wished to be sentimental, we might say, that “Babies
are the lice dolls of the daughters of Poverty.”

“WE FLY BY NIGHT” AND DAY.
WISITORs at the Seaside have suffered from flies more than any one
else... Not only were these myriads of insects a source of perpetual
stinging annoyance, but they have constituted in themselves a new kind
of “devouring element.” We know in many ** it has
been quite impossible to keep meat for longer than a few hours.
Instances have been known of where a large joint has been ha
for dinner, and not a morsel of it has been left for supper; and this
fact has been forcibly illustrated by the lodging-house-keeper pro-
ducing the bones, as a proof of how extremely clean these entomo-
logical police have done their work. Not only has it been in the
article of animal, food that these devastations have been committed,
but tea, sugar, butter, candles have all suffered to a corresponding
degree.” Where these Flies have once gained admission into a house,
the distress they levy is of a most devastating nature; for, like active
sheriff's-officers, they clear º before them in a very short space
of time. The moment, you, have ocular proof of their visitation,
which is not very difficult, as they have an unpleasant trick of getting
into your eyes, the only remedy is to give notice to quit immediately;

PHOENIXISM IN IRELAND.
From our facetious friend who is studying Natural History
on the Shores of the Shannon.
HEARING that a rara avis was about to make its
appearance in this green—very green—isle, and that St.
Patrick having exterminated the serpents, had promised
to perform something still more startling, by revivifying
the Phoenix, I came here, two or three days ago, like a
model student, to look, listen, and learn. On my arrival
I proceeded to the Laboratory of the “Patent Patriotic
Incubator Company "...}. for having revivified the
Phoenix, the Company contemp extending their re-crea:
tions, among which the dodo and the megatherium will
figure largely. The ashes of the Phoenix, Ithought, looked
exceedingly like small coal, but an earnest Editor, who had
been blowing with all his strength until he appeared in
danger of apoplexy, assured us that we should soon see
the º burst into a flame, for which purpose having lit
a lucifer match and applied it to the embers, he began to
fan them with a newspaper made of straw. It was highly
instructive to watch the scientific operator and his com-
peers by aid of bellows, mouth, and paper, and with hands
not over clean, labouring to kindle the contumacious cinders.
Some prosaic people did not scruple to pronounce it a
sham; some who were subscribers demanded their money
to be returned, and a sudden cry of “Police!”. alarming
the incubators, transformed a questionably national into
a really nervous agitation. At length, when public dis-
satisfaction had reached its climax, a slight flutter was
heard, and lo! a rara avis indeed rose from the dust-heap
where it had so long, ingloriously slumbered. Will you
believeme without a solemn statutory declaration? Instead
of the classical bird which I had anticipated, I beheld one
that is sacrificed to Epigurus on, Michaelmas Day, and
which on spreading its wings, proclaimed its superiority to
the Sassenach by something between a crow and a cackle.
Briefly, Phoenixism in this green—very green—isle, though
a pretty ornament for a cabbage garden, has the rich, but
decidedly vulgar flavour of an Irish goose.
Ecclesiastical Billiards.
The Celebrated Convocation Players flatter themselves
that their little game is won because they’ve just made

OUR YACHT.
OUR breakfast, my first breakfast on board, was simple and unosten-
tatious. There is a table in the cabin. Its º are up in the air; that
is, it is supported from above instead of below by thin ropes, which
with some little ingenuity we have now reduced to equal lengths. It
must be a very good arrangement this when the ship is in motion,
as, through its swinging about, the centre of gravity (I believe I speak
scientifically) is invariably preserved. Our Treasure of a Cook sent us
in some excellent tea, some ; excellently boiled, and some thin
slices of bacon beautifully grilled. We all agreed that he was a
Treasure. The Captainand Crew breakfasted together in the “forecassel,”
or hold; they’ve got no table, nothing but the top of the stove, and
from what I saw I suppose they must lie in their berths while taking
their meals, as on any other supposition the disposal of their legs is a
mathematical impossibility.
The Captain came to our cabin for a second supply of “rations,”
which sailors, it appears, prefer to tea. The Commodore served out a
tumbler of brandy between them, and told them that after breakfast we
would get under way and sail down the straits. It was arranged that
this was the time to make my daily entry in the Log. I now reſer to it.
“Tuesday. Wind blowing down the straits;” that is, when I held out
my pocket-handkerchief just now, it was blown out towards Beaumaris,
and my hat went, in that direction, while my hands were engaged with
the log and handkerchief. , The Captain said it was blowing freshish;
the Commodore wouldn't let him go aſter my hat in the small boat,
which was unkind. . . -
Log again. “Freshish wind; hat overboard; no attempts at a rescue.
Getting under way. The Captain says he must take the tiller (N.B.,
not a ploughman, but something to do with steering) and the Com-
modore, tells me I must bear a hand (N.B., a nautical phrase, we are
all talking nautically, now, and I have Nº. up wearing braces) and
assist at the cab-stand, or cap-stand. (N.B., I think it was the cap-
stand; I don't like to ask the Commodore what is the meaning of these
phrases, because it makes him so angry, and his explanations are not as
clear as I should have expected from a person who knows so much
about these sort of things; but I gather that cap-stand, which is a
sort of post to which the anchor is fastened, is so called from the ex-
pression a ‘capſul of wind,” of which you can't take advantage unless
the anchor is unfastened.)”
I regret to say that there was a little disturbance on board to-day. I
further º: to say that it was, to a certain extent, my fault. I have
apologised, and peace reigns again. It was, in reality, the Lieutenant's
fault, not mine. He came down-stairs to talk to me soon after the
order about bearing a hand at the cap-stand had been given, and we
agreed that the Commodore was rather over-bearing, Why should he
call himself a Commodore? Why should ToM only be a lieutenant?
Why, I added, should I only be a Mate? ToM said he wouldn't stand
it if he was in my place. We agreed that something ought to be done
about it at once. We ought to speak to the Commodore. ToM observed
that as I was going on deck I might at once speak to him, and he would
back me up. On consideration I thought it would be better if he spoke
to the Commodore, and I would back him up, . I liked the idea
of backing him up, because, as I have said before, the Commo-
dore does get so angry. We settled that we’d both go and
speak together. . We went up on deck, I first. The Commodore
was at the head of the Companion. (N.B. The cabin ladder.) I
told him I wanted to speak to him. The Lieutenant, instead of backing
me up, went down the Companion to fetch his hat. I hate a fellow who
sneaks away... I told the Commodore that I thought as our voyage was
only for fun, that is putting it as pleasantly as possible, I ought to be
something more than a Mate. The Commodore wanted to know what
I meant by “fun?” I said that my meaning was it was all a lark. He
replied that he understood me, and I’d better bear a hand for’ard. I
refused unless I was something more than a Mate.
What would I be? he wanted to know.
Not having given this point sufficient consideration, I suggested that
I should like to be a Cornet. He said if I was going to play the fool
we’d better give the whole thing up. Did I know, he asked, that rank
on board a gentleman's yacht was recognised in the Navy? I didn't

get a Commission in the Mounted Marine Force. I asked if these were

compromise. It was agreed that I should apply for a Commission to
the Wii, by letter; they grant these to yachtsmen like commissions
to Volunteers, and that I should write up to Town for a uniform.

A PARAGRAPH TO
PLEASE THE PIGS.
TUPID old Dogberry wished that
somebody would write him down an
ass; but here is somebody who,
writing to the Daily Erpress, takes
the liberty of writing himself down
in it a pig :-
“DISEASE IN PIGS.
“SIR,-Having read in your paper of
Saturday a paragraph under the above
head, I write at once to inform your Cor-
respondent, through you, that assafoetida
is an effectual cure fºr the distemper
amongst pigs, having experienced , it
myself about a month ago. The dose for
a §§ pig is half an ounce (the cost of
which is one penny), mixed up, and then
well dissolved in a naggin of boiling
water, to which a naggin of new milk
should be added. To a full-grown pig,
fully three-quarters of an ounce of assa-
foetida should be given.”
For aught we know, this remedy
may really be a good one; and if so,
pig-keepers in general will be
thankful to the writer for having
made it known. But they will
hardly, one would think, feel so
grateful for his mentioning a few of them as follows:–
“The remedy is a ‘...}} safe, and simple medicine, and cannot be too generally
known amongst the small farmers and cottiers, who have chiefly suffered from
this virulent and fatal disorder.
“I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“Aghsmear, Roscrea, Sept. 4, 1865.” ** Joseph GRIFFITH."
The letter being headed “Disease in Pigs,” the “small farmers and
cottiers” are at liberty, of course, to regard themselves as being spoken
of as such, when they are named as having suffered from the common
porcine malady. Let us only hope that assafoetida will suit them, if
they venture on a dose of it. Half an ounce of assafoetida in some
boiling milk and water is, scarcely such a drink as an epicure would
#: but if there be any “Epicuri de greye porcus” that unfortunately
appens to be struck with the disease, it may be well for him to try the
dose above prescribed, and also try to hold his nose while he is taking it.

.# that in penning these lines to one whose portrait only I have
Seen, i. feel as if I were addressing a stranger. * * * Your manners
and fashions differ sensibly, he says, from ours º: where dresses, like
doctors, differ, who shall decide?”6ür modes are like our laws, un-
changeable. Yours are repealed, if I mistake not, every session; there
being no permanency either in your statutes or skirts at large." " "
Your people all take great interest in Bills. Even noble Lords are
known to carry them as if they were infants and ill, and are greatly
agitated when they are dropped. * * When a Minister brings, in a
Bill, however, it never exceeds the weight of a Sovereign... When a
Bill is brought into the house by a Milliner, it startles one to think how
mº sovereigns may be required to honour it.
I have no wish to flatter, but your ideas of personal loveliness are
certainly more expansive than ours, owing to your—do not blush–
superior intelligence. In a crowd we take as little space as possible,
but that which in us would be selfish, is in you sublime, for you know,
dear, we are so narrow-minded. * * * Your Brother amused me with a
tale of a man-of-war, which, when completed, was so large that it could
not be taken out of dock. Is there not a similar tale of an Admiral's
Lady, when dressed for a drawing-room? Her tiring-woman, I believe,
fainted away, as it was found impossible to get her off, and ultimately
the weaker vessel, like the stronger, became a perfect wreck. * * *
I understand you have Asylums and Refuges—you are such a bene-
yolent people—for all sorts and conditions of men. These charitable
institutions, quaintly called Clubs, are open day and º and no
urgent case is ever denied admission. Here the weary bachelor finds that
repose which fashionable coteries conspire to destroy, and from his
monastic window serenely views those charms which once inspired him
with such pleasing terror. * * *
We have been much quizzed by your beau monde for our small feet
but remember, we do not walk like a child of earth with golden hair. f
have often been lost in astonishment when thinking what opportunities
you lose of conquest. Why not abandon that painful exertion, and
open new channels of employment, for your young guardsmen? Let
every lady have a palanquin of her own, with four fine cavaliers
attached, whose delightful duty it should be to carry her when and
where her inclination may dictate. You shudder, because it seems so
much like slavery, but while reclining in your aerial couch you can
always raise a deserving object from his abject state by a simple action
—I mean, of course, by giving him your hand.
Speaking of action, reminds me of that connected with breach of
H. Your dear Brother tells me it is a popular pastime, combining
ike many other innocent diversions, both chance and skill. i have heard
of clever girls winning at it as much as a thousand pounds! Here we
º: very different game. If a lover, revokes, his adversary tattoos
im with Indian ink, and he is set at liberty, bearing on his forehead
the letter D (Deserter), but this rarely *. Our military men are
little prone to playing with promises; they generally leave, things
requiring much finesse to their Mammas. I asked your dear Brother
why this system was not introduced into your charming circle, and he
said in time no doubt you would borrow light from a Chinese lantern,
and our tenderness be as highly commended as our tea.
The Patience of the Reader is Requested.
Mons. Thiers, in consequence of a small consideration of £20,000,
is going to devote himself to the composition of a new literary work
and, as a natural result, will bid farewell, “a long farewell,” to olitical
life. A profane breaker of words in Paris (we could give his address if
necessary) says this is not the first time by many that he has heard of
the “ Wale of THIERs.”

“CoME here, my dear CHARLIE. It is the land of luxury and lazi-

DISTRESSING INFANT NIGHTMARE,
FOUNDED ON THE LEGEND OF “BAN BURY CROSS.”
GREAT EVENTS IN OUR DAILY LIFE AT
SHRIMPSIDE.
Seeing the Children bathe.—One little shrimp so fond of the water
that we named him the “sea-urchin.”
Seeing the Children dig.—As much pleased with their spades as we
are with our clubs; and filling their barrows with a satisfaction only
equalled by that of grave archaeologists opening tumuli.
Tapping the weatherglass.-As, great a nuisance in the house as the
* in the ºff. which steadily refused to go to sleep under
an hour and every known lullaby. The landlady had the calmest of
tempers—set fair. It was never stormy in the kitchen.
Going to the Flagstaff to see in what quarter the wind was.-Not vain
enough to think we could detect delicate shades of difference, such as
N º and N.N.W., only revealed to pilots and coast guardsmen.
High Water.—The finest tides at two in the morning. Remarkable
fact that the tides are always pitifully low when we are at the sea. A
week before we come they are unusually high, and a fortnight after we C
are gone the waves wash over the pier, and throw their spray in at the
Terrace windows. A similar fatality befals us as to amusements. The
Mammoth Circus bills are still on the walls; the great conjuror gave
his last performance three nights before we arrived, the sisters Sopho-
NisbA and Esm ERALDA will appear in their unrivalled entertainment
the Friday after we leave. To ebb back to the tide, avoid all
persons who ask troublesome questions about the influence of the moon
on the tides, and the exact meaning of the terms “spring” and “neap.”
Woe betide us, if we are ever pressed for this information by the Civil
Service Commissioners.
Taking an Observation of the Cambrian Hills.-Almost as great a
nuisance as the weather-glass and baby, for when we had a fine bright
day we were not suffered to enjoy it, being invariably told that the
Cambrian mountains were so distinctly seen, that the next day was sure
to |. wet; and so it was from the milk in the morning till the milk at
night.

THE CLERK.
I CoME from haunts of Coutts and HoARE,
rom counting-house and alley,
I hear the City monster roar,
I traverse Holborn Walley,
By Ludgate Hill I hurry down,
Or slip along the byeways,
By twenty pumps that jº. the Town,
And fountains on the highways;
Till home I go, at half-past five,
The Surrey side the river,
For men may ride and men may drive,
But I walk on for ever.
I º over mir ways,
heed the shoeblacks’ trebles,
I enter doors of noiseless baize,
I wear a pair of pebbles.
With many a cheque to banks I go,
To clerks both fresh and sallow;
And many a forenoon I bestow
On linseed, hemp, and tallow.
I whistle, whistle, when I hail
The Surrey side the river,
For men may drive, and ride by rail,
But I walk on for ever.
I pass by boys with pewter pots,
And luncheons under covers,
I see the eggs with splotchy spots
That might be happy plovers.
I º away at noon to dine
here chops so many swallow,
I order one from off the loin,
And one all hot to follow.
And out again, till home I go,
The Surrey side the river,
For men may ride and men may row,
But I walk on for ever.
there was then a brisk competition for its possession, we, who are
averse to a paper-war, felt thankful to get a glimpse of the supple-
ment the first day, and were placidly content with the local paper,
which one of the subscribers to the room persisted in calling The Daily
Currier. We heard afterwards that he was in the leather trade.
To the Circulating Library.—We left without obtaining the third
volume of any one of the four novels we read consecutively.
To the Station to see the Train come in-With much compassion for
those arriving, and curious study of the meeting between husbands and
wives who had been parted eyer since 9:30 A.M. Certain little hampers
brought by the gentlemen, objects of great interest to the ladies—almost
as much looked after as the dear husbands themselves.
To the Crescent.—To see the moon rise (when not cloudy).
To the Terrace.—To see the sun set (when not rainy).
To the Green.—To hear the band ſº The era in our marine chro-
nology; but only occurring periodically, once a week. It was the
Olympiad from which every event, dated. ...We had roast ducks the
day before the band played last week, and the § but one after the
HIPswings came over to tea from Gardenbright; and don’t, you
remember those particularly fine shrimps we had the evening the band
played, the first week we came, when PERCY WERE was conspicuously
attentive to PENELope P
The Day of our Arrival, and oh! ruddiest of all Red. Letter Days, the
Day of our Departure.—For though Shrimpside is strongly to be recom-
mended as a retreat not infested with excursionists, nor donkey-ridden,
but capital for children, reasonable in its tariff, and free from blind men
playing the accordeon : it was a little too quiet.
Milk-Paley's Evidences.
SEVERAL Correspondents in the penny papers are complaining in the
most sour spirit about the high price of milk. They do not like paying
fivepence a quart for it. However, they have already their own remedy;
they are not compelled to take it in. It is purely a question of milk
can, or milk shan’t.
To FRIENDS.-Is GENERAL PRIM a Quaker?

[Fact is, George thinks his rich relative had much better spend his Money in
Original Pictures, and in those of one talented young Painter in particular.
CHIVALRY AND THE CUDGEL.
WE have to chronicle another instance of the new reading of Blackstone, so
efficiently illustrated of late by both paid and unpaid Magistrates. That eminent
Judge—sometimes HoMER nods—was so illogical as to write that the Law regarded
personal safety before that of property. This mistake, excusable in a century
when joint-stock banks, railway scrip, and electro-plate were not, is daily receiving
correction at the hands of London and country Justices. The latest instance is
the following. One WILLIAM FLEtchER, Somerset, farmer, lately made a furious
attack on some girls, who, under the guard of their governess, strayed from a foot-
path to this British farmer's hedge and , picked blackberries. Whereon this
creditable specimen of Zummerset flew at them, and beat two with his stick till
he drove them, shrieking, over a stile, and so off his land. Their necks and
shoulders were covered with bruises and weals. In due time the gallant Fletch ER
appeared before the county Magistrates at Bath. The Chairman told him, “No
man, with the feelings of an Englishman, would have behaved in the unmanly
and brutal way he had,” and fined him—forty shillings and costs, such costs to
include a guinea to the young ladies' solicitor and a guinea to their doctor.
Considering that the 100th chapter of the 24 and 25 Vict, section 43, provides
a maximum of sir months imprisonment or twenty pounds fine for an aggravated
assault on women, sentimental sticklers for personal comfort might consider the
Magistrates ridiculously lenient; but if girls run at one's blackberry hedge where
is the ºne: who wouldn’t run at them with a cudgel, and raise “weals and con-
tusions
Purses and turnips are to be guarded by county Magistrates with great se-
yerity, but shins and bones must take risks. Whether we can make the other
Zummerset farmers coincide with us in our sympathy for MR, FLETCHER we don't
know—but floreat Baculum. / -
IN WINO WERITAS.
“I’ll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night.”
Troilus and Cressida.
THE wines of Greece the wines of Greece
('Twas thus a Shambro’ merchant sung)
It fº tortured mind no peace,
To think that Britons, old and young,
Their port and sherry can forget,
For Santorin, or Mount Hymett.
The Scian, and the Teian Grape,
An English palate seem to suit;
In vain the wine of Spain we ape,
With distillation from the root
Produced in regions of the West:
Folks will maintain the vine is best.
sº where hath gone the jolly nose,
ompact of colours red and blue,
Which showed by spots like fruit of sloes
The source to which its tints were due?
Acute and keen, not squat and broad,
Its sharpened nostrils sniff out fraud.
Fill high the vat with Shambro' wine!
We will not think on themes like these;
Let's call the mixture Sherry fine,
Or any other name º please. .
Rebuke not, friends, the buyer's voice:
Who pays his cash should take his choice.
One writer, sure from northern climes,
Maintains that toddy drinks as well;
Another “Taster,” in the Times,
Declares it hath a tallowy smell.
Rise, Porson 1 from thy grave, and halloo,
'Tis obô& réðe obö. TöAAo,
Fill high the bowl with Shambro' wine!
On Brighton's beach, on Scarbro's shore;
Exists the gallant landlord line,
Who pile their charges as of yore.
Of their six shillings grant but one,
And Shambro's fount shall still flow on.
Trust not to vintage of the Franks,
Tho' pure from BAcchus' grape it wells;
In northern roots, in northern tanks,
The only hope of profit dwells.
Not thus shall John BULL be beguiled !
Cries DENMAN fierce and DRUITT mild.
Oh, place me on Elbe's muddy bank,
Where, free from each intruding eye,
Safe I may try each chemic prank,
And keen analysis defy.
Potatoes, wash, and drugs combine,
And smash th' accursed Grecian wine.
Just the Difference.
MR. PUNCH was walking the other day in the neigh-
bourhood of Chatham, in company with a distinguished
foreigner, when the latter inquired the meaning of a broad
arrow, which was engraved upon a post. “The Broad
Arrow,” said Mr. Punch, ever ready to give information;
“is the distinguishing mark of the Government.” “ And
what, then,” rejoined his friend, “is that of the Opposi-
tion?” “The Long Bow,” instantly replied Mr. Punch,
handing him a newspaper containing the Conservative
speeches on the results of the recent elections.
CIIESTERFIELD IN Tlie CITY.
The gentlemen in the City are proverbial for their polite-
ness. For instance, we have been informed, on most credible
authority, that a Bank Director never meets the Qld lady
of Threadneedle Street in the Bank Parlour without in-
stantly rushing up to her, and saying, in the most anxious
manner, “I hope, my dear Madam, that ſº rest during

UNANIMOUS TO A CRINOLINE.
LADY CLIFTON has been presented with a testimonial subscribed for
by eight thousand of the women of Nottingham. We do not allude to ,
the mere fact of the testimonial as anything very extraordinary, because
in these days testimonials are to be had almost for the asking; but
what we consider the most wonderful part of the business is, the rare
circumstance of its having come exclusively from ladies, and the still
rarer circumstance of so .. eight thousand ladies having all agreed
together for the same laudable purpose. Rarely, has such unanimity
been known before, and especially towards one of their own sex!. Now,
if the object of admiration had been a fº. we can readily point
to a distinguished individual, who would undoubtedly achieve an equal,
if not a far greater success even than LADY CLIFTon herself. That
happy individual, we need not say, is Mr. Punch. He has conquered
so many hearts, that he could almost cry that there is not another one
left to conquer.
“Register | Register l Register l’”
We have at last found out the hitch, the F. flaw, that so
snappishly interrupted the flowing career of the Atlantic Cable. The rea-
son of its circulation being suddenly stopped was, that it had never been
properly “registered for transmission abroad.”. We hope the Directors
will repair this defect previous to the next issue of their interestin
periodical, which, like other serial stories, always manages to breako
when we are most interested, leaving us to be buoyed, up, as best wº
may, with the oſt-repeated promise of “To be Continued in our Next.

OUR YACHT.
Y Jingo! We’ve had
another row. It was
not my fault this time.
I am disappointed.
Puffin Island I knew
wasn't anywhere near
America, but I was
not prepared to find
it within a mile or so
of Bangor—just, in
fact, at the entrance
of the Straits. I joined
in the cruise under
the impression we
should go somewhere
3 a long way off–Nia-
gara, for instance, or
at all events, the coast
of France. My com-
panions (I don’t mean
the ladders, but the
Commodore and Jieu-
tenant) say that they
came to shoot Puffins.
I am not naturall
irascible, but when
heard this I said,
“Blow Puffins !”
They have, however,
promised to go on
a voyage, and we’re
to victual and take in
stores at Liverpool.

learn how to belay.) Belayed from 8 till 9 A.M. (This means that we
lay on deck and read, or talked and smoked. The Captain, was not
belaying—he was steering. The Treasure was in the forecassel, that is,
his head and shoulders were in the forecassel, washing up.)
"9 A.M.–Passing Beaumaris. Guns brought out to shoot Puffins
with. They’ve given me a gun. I am lying on deck, noting down, in
my Log. They’ve given me powder, shot, wads, and caps, and I’ve
got to shoot Puffins. This is delightful. The boat has scarcely, an
motion, and, contrary to my wildest expectation, I feel quite well.

loaded.
I told the Commodore I wasn't much of a shot (no more I am, as I
have subsequently discovered) when on board a yacht. What I may
be on shore, I don't know, as I have never had the opportunity of
trying. I knew something about it, though, having luckily practised,
º ago, at a . a shot, or so much a dozen, on a wooden black-
ird tied to a pendulum in a gallery of Savile House. Then there was
a dirty man, in shirt-sleeves, to load for me, so that I never, as it hap-
pened, observed that process. What puzzled me was the wads. I
thought I’d copy the other fellows in loading, but couldn't, as they’d
both #. rifles that didn't require ramrods j wads, &c.
To load a gun by the light of nature, is not so easy as I had imagined
from seeing the man at Leicester Square. All I ever noticed him to do
was to put a cap on. So I º: it off (I don’t mean I laughed the
gun off, but the awkwardness of the situation), by saying to the Lieu-
tenant, “Ha! haſ hal, Kou don't know, whether Fº er, or shot, or
wads go in first, eh?” He was evidently annoyed at this charge of
mine, though playfully made, and replied, “Wads, of course.” (I
recommend this method of gaining information in preſerence to any
unnecessary display of ignorance.) He said “wads.” . So I used two
to begin with. "I must here remark what an ill-constructed affair is
a powder-flask; I never seemed to be getting any out at all, and yet
after eight or nine attempts 1 found the barrel full almost to the brim-
I mean muzzle. This delayed me, and I had to begin again. We now

elow to load, where I could be quiet. I found the Treasure in the
cabin, aft. I don't know what associated him in my mind immediately
with brandy and rations. He was very civil, and offered to load my

said, “Oh, you don't use them, eh?” So f gather there are more
.. than one of loading a gun. The cabin was very stuffy and hot,
and getting | the companion with a gun in º hand was very difficult.
Standing on deck with it was more difficult... I now refer to an entry,
evidently made in short hand, on account of the motion of the vessel –

I recollect when my turn came I made a shot.. Not a bad one as a
shot. It must have hit something. In loading, rather hastily and jaun.
tily, for I was pleased with my execution, which had quite taken away
my qualmishness (N.B., nothing, like firing off a gun as a remed
against sea-sickness), I jerked the ramrod sharply down the barrel,

let the table go and dined as we could. We sat against our berths. At
the third ºf; of i. the Commodore's º: made a rush at his
mouth, and Ifound myself sprawling over the Lieutenant. The Commo-
dore said I might have helped it if I’d liked. I said I mightn't,
angrily. He replied, that if I couldn't help playing the fool ºvery;
where, we'd better give the whole thing up. After he'd said this, he and
the Lieutenant, accompanied by two plates and the soup tureen and the
table came right over me all in a lump. I caught hold of the Commo-
dore's hair. The rest of the dinner may be described as the Treasure
staggering in with hot tins holding hodge-podge and sea-pies, and we
alternately sprawling over one another with soup plates until one of the
ropes broke, and we were all on the floor together—tins, mugs, tureens,
plates, hodge-podge, sea-pies, my gun, log book, and powder-flask.

THOSE CONFOUNDED GLEANERS 1
PLEASING ASPECT ON ARRIVAL AT “THAT STUBBLE, WHERE WE RE SURE TO FIND THE BIRDS; LEASTWAYS THERE's THREE LOTS
AS BELONGS THERE.”
FROM A VALUED CONTRIBUTOR.
DEAR SIR, Inverness.
I ADDREss you with this formality because you took a .
with me last week, and I neither attempt nor tolerate liberties, my ol
cock-a-lorum, you know that. You called me “a dear old Correspon-
dent,” whereby you remind me of CUVIER, and the dictionary people,
and the crab. I am neither dear, old, nor a Correspondent... I am
cheap (though I admit that my salary is noble), I am in the prime of
life, and I am not a Correspondent, for you do not write to me. I re-
quest that, you will preserve the becoming heading which I have
affixed to this despatch. -
Your Valued Contributor left Scarborough, having been boiled,
stewed, fried, and baked by the merciless sun, and having become that
brown (as MR. SKETCHLEY would say), that a middle-aged young lady
in the train took him for an Oriental heathen, and proceeded to labour
for his conversion, but was undeceived by his interpolating an inquiry
whether she did not think that Miss Louis A PYNE would be delightful
in L'Africaine, whereat the fair missionary “shut up,” as SHAKSPEARE,
ſº LóRD BAcon) says in Macbeth, but not “in measureless content.”
am told that my mild remarks on Scarborough washing and other
matters have ruined the place. I am sorry, but it were better that all
the Scarburghers should run violently down their steep place into the
sea than that, a London Swell should present such a shirt-bosom as I
Was º to wear on Friday in presence of the aristocracy of the
Highlands.
It is needless to say that I had to wait at York. Everybody always
has to wait at York. It was, therefore, thoughtful in the inhabitants to
build the Minster, and lay out the Gardens, for the comfort of delayed
persons. I visited both places, but chiefly took up my rest in a quiet
shady corner of the second, close to the tomb of the great painter of the
Undraped. Here, like a Buddhist, I meditated on my own superiority
to the rest of mankind, until it was time to embark in the Glasgow
train. You will have been prepared for this revelation by a passage in
the close of my last letter. \{ dear old Punch, it was too hot to stay
in England. Even you who, like an author's wife, regard him as a mere
machine for the manufacture of profitable manuscript, would have
melted to see me melt. I felt that the cool air of Scotland was necessary
now, if your Valued were expected to enrich your columns during the
coming winter. Anyhow, I have come to the capital of the Highlands,
and from that capital I defy your columns. I think there may be a
joke here, but I cannot work it up, for—
It is hotter here than it was in England.
Sir, Mr. Punch, the dim mist is upon Tomnahurich, and intense heat
is signified. The Ness makes mournful music with half its yolume.
My dog, my GARRY (I call him mine, for I intend to steal, him) lies
elongated, and will only stir the remotest, feather of his Skye tail in
response to my languid call. I actually say “thank you” to the maiden
who brings me soda-water; I am ashamed to increase her trouble.
I cannot take off my coat, much less my waistcoat, because there are
ladies in the library. ... I cannot decide whether smoking makes me
hotter or not, but I will again try.
Hotter, I believe, my dear friend. And a lady has taken my chair,
and looks piteously at me, as begging that I will not disturb her. Can
I be cruel to º I cannot. You would not wish it. So I proceed
at a little chess table, and the inlaid work is cool to my pulse." What
the writing may be worth, I dare not think. It is not weather to write
." are an unnatural old monster to demand MS. at my fevered
and S.
I came from York to Glasgow. The train seemed to me to traverse
the greater part of England and Scotland, but it did not much matter,
and we arrived at last. , I am habitually temperate, and after four or
five bottles of Scotch ale, I retired to my couch. I suppose that I
undressed. . I suppose that I dressed again at six in the morning, for I
was properly clothed, when I fairly awoke about half-past seven, on
board the Iona. But I know not about it, and merely state my
lindressions.
. What awoke me was the most awful smell I ever tasted. I have
lived in the Temple, when the Thames was at its worst, but that odour
was all Arabia compared to the stench that woke me on the Clyde.
Never again, Mr. Punch, never again. ever I come northward more
by the waters, and I hope I often shall, I go by rail to Greenock, and

there embark. Greenock is a worse Woolwich, but I shall escape that
infernal stream, DANTE must have smelt it, and remembered the smell
when he described a certain portion of L'Inferno. I trust that I shall
not, in middle age, feel the effects of this voyage. Yet, I need not tell
you, nothing is ever wrong in Scotland. I think that the Scots, are
descended from the modern Americans. I did but hint that the Clyde
was foul when one gentleman assured me that the odour was due only
to some chemical works, and another rushed to the library of the Iona,
and brought me statistics to show that the mortality, by the river
was not in excess of the proper decimal points, or something. I don't
Care.
All hours of suffering pass. What saith the glorious Prometheus
of SHELLEY, when threatened with years of future anguish P-
“Perhaps no thought may count them—still, they Pass.”
And, after a time, we escaped into the delights of the coast, the
series of the loveliest watering-places in Christendom. Keep away, you
Cockneys, and you, ye manufacturing swells, and your congeners.
These sea-nooks are not for you. You cannot show your smart clothes
here, there are no concert-rooms and raffle-bazaars, there are no screws
to gallop on, no donkeys to screech on, no hotel balls, no flirtation
ardens, no abominable bands of music. You would be bored to
eath in three days, for there is nothing here but the loveliest
views of mountain and islet, and intense quiet, broken only by the
everlasting wash of waves of green crystal. Keep off, for I hate you.
I have in other days spoken of my beautiful Iona, with her noiseless
motion, luxurious deck saloon, and other magnificences. I am told
that she is to be transferred to the upper waters, and that a sister of
equal splendour is to take her place. My eyes, what good breakfasts
she gives you! Specially, I would speak of comely trouts, of pleasing
baps, of goldenly translucent marmalade. Here also you may write
your letters, the company supplying the material gratis, and there are
two post-offices on board. I might have written an article for you,
Mr. }. only I didn't. Evening brought us to Oban's pretty bay.
I wish I could conceal from the Cockneys that there is a new and first-
rate hotel here now, but MR. CAMPBell, the owner, has printed the
fact in Bradshaw, and it is no secret. If, when refreshed and adorned,
I made a sensation among the elegant lady-tourists in the drawing-room,
I cannot help being handsome, as our friend MR. BENNETT, of the
clocks, observed to our friend the LoRD MAYor. As I wandered, star-
light on the waters, and a cigar on my lip, I could not refrain from
thinking, my dear friend, how sweet it were to fly from the ollow
world and take up one’s abode in some º place like this,
somebody else paying one's bills, and oneself being left free to elevate
one's mind, and “refine it, gradual, for its final flight.” If you feel
inclined to promote such views, in my case, write to say what you will
stand per annum, and how you would like to remit.
Once more upon the waters, and once more at seven o’clock. I was
away to Glencoe. I am bound to remark that I think the Scotch have
made the most of the little measure of police that was carried out here.
The row they have made over it would induce a foreigner to believe
that Highlanders had never been massacred before, and by one another.
I have felt it my duty to controvert the popular view of the aflair,
wherever I went, and have several times nearly been put to death in
consequence. To-day, however, I had no opportunity of giving battle,
for the six or seven-and-twenty persons who were in the coach with me
were mostly English, and as they kept on asking the guide for primar
instruction, iº in whose reign the Glencoe business occurred,
and whether MARY QUEEN of Scots was concerned in it, and so on,
I should have been fighting with children. But I had an opportunity
of º row about a much worse cruelty than the Glencoe affair,
namely, the abominable cruelty to the poor horses who drag us tourists
along the hideous roads, and are flogged the whole way there and back,
about eighteen miles. The conductors assist the terrible lash of the
coachman, by getting down and prodding the animals with sharp sticks,
or scourging them with ropes’-ends. # a party of mechanics behaved
half as brutally to horses, on a journey to Hampton Court, we should
all cry out about the ruffianism of the lower orders, and demand ven-
#. but ladies and gentlemen are different—and indifferent—people.
he boat-company has nothing to do with this system. But there it is,
and a disgrace to English and Scotch humanity. I was glad to see a
writer in the Times publish his indignation at it.
But it is too hot to dwell upon the recollection. I returned to my
gallant vessel, then the Pioneer, and at last, and for the only time since
}. parted from me with tears in your fine eyes, did I behold rain. The
ills vanished in mist, and the storm came down. What a relief it was
to hear the fierce plash! M. soul exulted and rejoiced, and my skin
became soft and cool. And the rain came in no niggardly fashion, but
handsomely, and as if glad to see you. Down, down, for three or four
hours, and even when it .#. as well have stopped, for with all the
gallantry of my nature, I refused to crowd the ladies by entering the
omnibus which takes us from the boat to Banavie, and my Sunday hat
is finally and fatally spoiled. But when I took off my hat to Benjamin
Nevis, that royal personage took off his cap to me, and the Valued
exchanged courtesies with the Mountain.
. Ben Nevis is everlasting, and so, with the necessary deduction of
disagreeable contingencies from possible conduct on your part, is, my

Your faithful Servant,
EPICURUs ROTUNDUS,
CARELESS COURT CIRCULAR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I wish to call your attention to the careless manner in which
some of the Newspaper Court Correspondents dismiss the proceedings
of Royalty. I do (as who does not?) like knowing all that my Prince
does and, my Princess. I should like to be informed as to his move:
ments in shaving; his cuts, that I might sympathise with him; and
how many times he is, helped to pudding at dinner. Also, I should
like to hear whether the Princess say tehicky, tchicky, or itty, itty,
poossy sing, or what Her Royal Highness does say to the babies, and
what the babies do say to her. Do they chuckle and crow Royally or
not, or what? Is it not hard, then, to be cut short with—
“The PRINCE of WALEs with PRINCE Louis, &c., went out shooting.”
“&c.” What’s etcetera, who’s etcetera? Is it the PRINCE OF THE
Asturi As (that's not unlike etceteras, Prince of the Etceteras might
be a grand º or the Prince Holohoulu, I mean Holynoly, or Prince
Nolensvolens (I never can get that name right), or, in short, as I said
before, what does the writer mean by etcetera”
Sir, if this sort of thing is permitted, or passed over without notice,
the Royal J.ENKINs' employment will be gone, and our Court Circular
will be reduced to this sort of thing:—
Balmoral, September.
The QUEEN, accompanied by &c., &c., &c., drove to the &c., &c., &c.,

took for his, &c. The Equerries were, &c., &c., &c.
Now, wouldn't this be unsatisfactory? Of course.
Yours truly, THINGUMMYJIG.
BEGINNING AT THE WRONG END.
WE, wish the English authorities would copy the following good
example:–
“The authorities of the town of Kremsmunster, in Austria, have rigorously
interdicted servant-girls, ladies'-maids, &c., from wearing crinoline.”
So far this is good, but it would have been much better if the
Austrian authorities had begun at the other end. Servants imitate
their mistresses; mistresses are not in the habit of copying their
servants. Now, if the above interdict had been put on the Herzogins,
the Gräfins, and the Fraus and Fräuleins, moving in the higher circles,
the “servant-girls and ladies'-maids” of Kremsmunster would not
have been long before they followed the fashion as set them by their
superiors. Thus, Crinoline would in time have become virtually inter-
dicted in the lower as much as in the upper classes, and before long
would have been as little known in Austria as freedom of the press,
liberty of conscience, or any other subject which is not allowed to be
expanded without due authority from the Police.
The Fenians.
Dic, si Fenius es, quae foenea foedera fiant.

If you care for first-rate acting, visit the , Adelphi while MR.
JEFFERSON is personating the drunken, incorrigible 1.'ip. He plays

I am going again, because I like the piece, and because I went with a
learned friend, the other night. I call him “my learned friend” because
he is a gentleman who always knows everything about anything.
During the first act of “Rip,” he asked me to tell fi. the story, and
ding that I was uncertain in my details (for I wanted to listen to
the dialogue), he told me the story; explained what a difficult subject
it was to treat dramatically, mentioned the number of times it had
been “done” before, how often MR. JeffeRson had played it in
| America, with other interesting anecdotes concerning MR. JEFFERson,
and other members of the theatrical profession in private life. At the
end of the act º friend went out, returning three minutes before the
commencement of Act II. My Synopsis of the second and third acts is
as follows:–
ACT II.
Rip, in Sleepy Hollow, fires his gun—my friend asks to see the bill,
and informs me that the legend exists in Irish, in Spanish, in French as
well as in German...MR. C. J. SMITH enters as a dwarf. My friend
informs me that MR. SMITH is a very clever actor, that he saw him

shows Hendrick Hudson, and his gliostly crew playing bowls. My

FROM A VALUED contRIBUTOR. -
". . Drumnadrochit.
EAR the foot of Ben Nevis, my dear Mr. Punch, my last de-
spatch left me, or rather you. For my own part, I could
have remained there—when I say “there’” I mean, however,
at a comfortable inn called after the Arms of him who was
respectfully advised to beware of the day When the Low:
lands should meet him in battle array—but, aliter visum—and once more I had
to rise at six in the morning. I like to sit in a chair when I eat my breakfast,
and, to-day Lindulged this whim before embarking. , While dispatching my
modest meal (haddock, chop, ham and eggs, eggs plain, bramble jam, toast, mar-
malade, strong tea, and a dram), § eye fell—bother, both my eyes went up to
an engraving of MR. FRITH's celebrated picture—which depicts the ceremon
of gratulating a young heir, of other days, on his coming of age. You tel
me that large numbers of your readers desire to know “what your Valued
Contributor is like to look at.” Let them procure that engraving, and in the
face and figure of the graceful young Heir they will find a remarkable resem-
blance to myself. If I regret º -f it is that I was not also born to a
mansion and estate, though, your liberal appreciation of my genius makes this
regret almost ungracious. I wish that Mr. FRITH would paint the touching
scene that occurred when you, manly tears half choking your utterance, pre-
sented me with the delightful Willa and grounds, coach house and stables, and hot
and cold water on the premises, to which I shall have returned in a few days.
But a steam-boat, commanded by CAPTAIN PeTER TURNER, the most agree-
able of all captains, and yet a strict disciplinarian, would scarcely wait even for
me, certainly for no one else, were he a Duke. I strode on board the Edin-
burgh as the clock began to strike seven, and with the last stroke the order
was given to unmoor. We glided along the smooth Canal of Caledonia, and all
the mountains were bright in the morning sun. The mists rose from each hill
as the clouds of obscurity disappear and unveil genius (ºf of the Walue
kind) and the lady's maids and flunkeys were ordered to the fore-part of the
vessel. , Aristocracy of the most preternatural order came on board, and I
counted one. Prince, three Dukes, and half-a-dozen Marquises, besides many
splendid Chiefs and Chieftains in full Highland costume... I counted nothing
lower than Earls. We were a goodly company, and I felt irradiated by so
much magnificent, Pedigree. When I tell you that one nobleman offered me
a fusee, another told me that we were fortunate in the weather, and a third
lent me the Saturday Review, you may judge of the terms of easy affability upon
which I placed myself with that illustrious assemblage. The great Highland
Gathering at Inverness had—in addition to the report that I was to be on board
—crowded the boat with that galaxy of the well-born. Our voyage was not
marked by aught calculated to disturb our aristocratic composure, and we
reached Inverness early in a roasting afternoon. Here, however, all composure
vanished. The landing place is some distance from the hotels, and carriages are
necessary.., There was about a tenth part of the number that was required.
The pile of luggage was not so large as the great Pyramid at Gizeh (which you
are aware I have ascended") but larger than any of the neighbouring pyramids,
and this pile had to be subdivided, and heaped on the few vehicles. The
owners of these carriages were true philosophers. They stood stolidly by
while we fought for Wºº. and kindly permitted us to hoist our own
luggage to the roofs. When we were closely packed, they forced in a few more
passengers, and demanded our fares. Some paid. I would not pay. But I
saved nothing. I had one º: and two trunks. A London cabman, of the
most savage character, would have deemed himself overpaid with two shillings,
for the journey that was performed with me. I nobly tendered half-a-crown,
expecting thanks. , A second half-crown was demanded. You know my sweet.
ness of nature, and may in some sort, guess at the reception of this demand.
But my gentle pleading did not avail, and being apprised by a friend that I
could not drag the driver to a dungeon, I flung him down his second coin,
with a gratis description of my views of the business, and in regard to his
Future. He picked up the i.ºf I hope he will spend it in drink, and insultan

Inverness is a favourite abode of your Valued Correspond-
ent. It is one of the cheerfullest of cities. Even the Cemete
is .." laid out on the top of a great hill, or j
mountain, called Tomnahurich, and I have never seen else-
where so admirably, chosen a resting-place. The Ness is
always sparkling and singing among its islands. It must be
a comfort and satisfaction to a criminal to be tried and sen-
tenced in such a handsome place as the Castle. The Wolun-
teers are very gallant, and send crack shots to Wimbledon. A
new street has been built since I was last in the place, and
it is a very handsome street indeed. It has been called Union
Street, in honour of the union between Scotland and England,
and to show that the capital of the Highlands is loyal to the
House of GUELPH. M.R. S.Nowie, who had better, when he
gets to the Happy Hunting Grounds, keep out of the way of

but embalms their heads for the haughty slayers, has a grand
flººr, of horns, and discourses learnedly upon them.
act, you may make out your time very agreeably in this
capital, especially if one is living at the costs and charges
of one's friends, a practice of which, I am rather fond, not
for the sake of saving money, for which I care nothing (except
as a , means, of doing good), but, because it enables those
friends to display the beauty and kindness of their nature.
It is our duty to assist others in .# their best charac-
teristics, and what is better than hospitality and generosity?
Of the º Games, which I attended, and for which a
fine new field is provided, with a handsome gallery for the
ladies, I shall say little. I did not, this year, engage in them
myself, but a man from Carlisle, which is an #. h place,
beat the Highlanders almost as completely as I should have
done had I competed. There was much beauty in the gallery,
but I think that a yery fair share of that beauty was con-
tributed by pretty visitors to the north. But if you insist
on the truth, I did not remain long in the privileged enclo-
sure, after I had made my º. and gracefully recog-
mised the plaudits that were showered upon your Representa:
tive...I retired to the outer circle, and endeavoured to cool
myself a little with smoke, in company of a literary and
artistic kind. Who my friends were matters not to the
world, proud as I am of such friendship, but I believe that
from the stores of my universal knowledge, I afforded to
one of them some new information as to the works of Pope,
and to the other threw some new light upon the character
of MyRILLO. When such minds meet, it is a good thing for
mankind.
If you ask, me what made me revisit Culloden, I am utterly
unable to tell you, and therefore I think your wisdom would
show itself more richer, as SHAKSPEARE (or LoRD BAcos)
says, in abstaining from the question. The day was broiling,
the road was dusty, and I knew the ground perfectly we
Yet I went, and sat upon the DUKE of CUMBERLAND's big
stone, or boulder, added my own stone to the cairn over the
grave, and came back again to Inverness. I have not, as I
remarked in another letter, my, dictionary of quotations with
me, but is there not some wonderful Latin saying about memo
repente fuit turpissimus—no, DICK TURPIN's non-repentance
is nothing to the present purpose—the quotation I mean is
nemo omnibus horis sapit. But the Pretender himself was
not particularly wise in coming to Culloden. Suppose he
had won that trick, and the others, and the Stuarts had
reigned until now, what should I, your Valued Contributor
have been P. An awful consideration My talents would
have fitted me for anything, of course, and perhaps I should
have been a Cardinal. But I should certainly not have been
a gay and playful Valued Contributor, remitting alternate dia-
monds of wisdom and spangles of wit to a Satirist of king-
craft, priestcraft, and mobcraft. I think that you, Mr.
Punch, would have been hanged. It is not for me to specu:
late whether the result which that incident would have had
upon the welfare of mankind would have been beneficial or the
reverse.
But I had conversed with men and women too long, and I
began to feel it was necessary for me, to commence a conver-
sation with Nature. I therefore, filled my cigar-case, gave
directions that the Times should be regularly sent on to me,
put EDMOND ABOUT's last volume into § ocket, and once
more threw myself on board the vessel which CAPTAINTURNER
on this, occasion commanded from the quay only. I caused
myself to be set ashore at a small pier projecting into Loch
Ness. Near that point I knew, of old, that there was a calm
and sequestered scene, easily reached, yet far removed from
the noise, turmoil, and strife of a city....There are hills as old
as creation, and women who look a little older. There I
determined to rest and be thankful. But I resolved to defer

the commencement of a natural life until I should arrive at my place
of sojourn, so I got into a carriage, and was driven into the glen
in which I write. I am at Drumnadrochit, which means, I am told, the
place behind the bridge, so it must have been christened from over the
way, as the village is before we come to the bridge. The scenery is
lovely, but I have not yet been able to throw myself upon the bosom of
Nature. The Highland breakfast is sadly in the way of a man who
would live simply and abstemiously, and open his soul to the influences
of the Spirit of the Earth. Instead of feeling humble, and pure, and
trustful, and intellectual, you feel just fly and you stick yourself in
an arm-chair, light your weed, and laugh. That is not, I suppose, the
attitude of mind or body in which the Pantheist worships the Wast
| Snake. But what can I do? Nobody can resist those breakfasts, and
what would the handsome Highland lass who spreads them for me say
if I bade her remove everything but toast and cold water, because f
wished, to be sublimated? ... Ought I to wound that black-haired
maiden's feelings? Ought I to infuse doubts into her mind, and in-
struct her that there are other faiths than her own exceedingly, hot
Calvinism f : How beset with difficulties, O my friend, is our path in
this life!, but surely we can never be wrong in doing what is pleasant
to ourselves, for we thereby preserve ourselves from being tempted
into the ill-humour usually attendant, upon doing what is called our
duty. Therefore, at present I will abide in this pleasant place. I will
gaze upon the mountains, and listen to the sound of the stream, even
the Ennerick, and I will wander to the blue lake, and climb to the
cataract called Divach, or sit among the rocks at its foot. Likewise, I
will visit a huge wild cat, which is detained behind iron bars, and tease
it, and I will give a F. to any barefoot little Highland girl who
is pretty and clean—the conditions prevent extrayagance. But for the
present, also, I will abstain from qualifying myself for other communings

TRIPLEx would approve of my tampering with my constitution. It

EPICURUs ROTUNDUs.
A BRIGHT, (BUT NOT) PARTICULAR, STAR.
THE most conspicuous of the gentlemen, whose names appeared in
| the mendacious list of Confederate Loan holders, concocted in America,
i and republished and commented upon here by the Star, in its own
peculiarly generous and candid style, having given the lie direct to the
concoctors of the forgery, the Star turns from virtuous indignation, to
humble pie. But even its humble pie is served up with the peculiar
Stellar sauce.
“Nobody,” exclaims the voice of the Star, “can pretend to say that
the comments of the Star. upon, MR. DELANE's appearance in the list
would have been in the slightest degree unfair if the document had been
authentic.”
“If/?” “Great virtue in an if,”—even for the unerring Wor Stellarum.
People out of the starry region will run away with the notion that
the unfairness consisted in making such comments before verifying the
authenticity of the document.
Oh, that an enemy had done this! How the Judges of the Star:
chamber would have been down upon him, pinched him in the Spanish |
boot of dilemma, flogged him with sarcasms, pressed him to death with
; leaders! But sublimer still in its coolness, is the comfort which
e
poraries have made an elaborate boast of their determination not to
publish the now famous list, until the document had gone through some
private process of verification here.”
The ridiculous Fº silly scruple-mongers! -
What! find a handful of mud, reeking and ready-made, to fling at
an adversary, and talk of analysing it!
The Star knows better.” Nothing,” it observes, “could be more
foolish and baleful than such a notion of propriety. . . . . Whispered
about, this charge might have endured for ever: openly exhibited, it
has been refuted within two days 1”
And so the Star shuts up—radiant! In spite of the castigation
they have brought, on themselves, people “with baleful notions of pro-
priety” will be apt to insist, that the Star is condemned, not for pub-
lishing the list, but for taking its truth for granted, and making it
the text for a gross and personal attack on some—we were going to
write brother, but we will say—contemporary journalists. The question
of comment, apart, they may probably maintain the opinion that even
if disseminating lies be one way of inviting their refutation, the task
is not a very dignified one. That, no doubt, is another baleful notion
of propriety,
It is an old complaint—as old as the decay of Astrology—that the
yoice of the stars is a lying voice. But now we see that one star, at
least, feels the utterance of lies to be one of its most useful functions, and
fondly takes credit to itself for uttering them.

THE THAMES AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.
HERE is an announcement, from a trustworthy contemporary, that
must needs interest all those who are accustomed to drink any of the
water which London is supplied with :—
“THE THAMEs CoMMIssionERs AND THE SEwAge of WINDson.—MR. MENzies,
acting under MAJor-GENERAL SEYMoUR, Deputy Ranger of Windsor Great Park,
attended at the Windsor Board of Health yesterday, and stated that he appeared on
behalf of the Board of Works for the purpose of obtaining the consent of the Windsor
Board to the surveyor in giving the necessary statistics and other information with
a view to the disposing and utilising the sewage of Windsor, instead of permitting
it, as at present, to be discharged into the River Thames.”
When our fellow, citizens consider that the town of Windsor lies
considerably above that part of the Thames whence the water which
constitutes their beverage, or at least a part thereof, is derived, they
will rejoice to see that some movement has been made towards obtaining
the knowledge requisite to effect the intention of stopping, at some
future time, the discharge of the sewage of Windsor into that river.
The following continuation of the foregoing statement will give addi-
tional zest to the relish wherewith they will imagine themselves drinkin
hereafter a glass of water that shall have been taken from the purifie
Thames at Thames Ditton :-
“From Mr. MENzies' statement it appears that the Commissioners of the
Thames Navigation have becn making a general survey of the river from Oxford,
with a view of ascertaining the general effect of the discharge of sewage into the
Thames from the various towns and villages between Oxford and London.”
So long as the sewers of those towns and villages are tributaries to
#. * they will continue to pay tribute also to the cisterns of
10ndon. I'Or:-
“You may cleanse, you may filter, the Thames as you will,
But the soluble filth will abide in it still.”
Not only at Windsor, but at all the other towns on the banks of the
Thames, ºf. MENzies, has found the discharge of sewage into the
Thames a “great nuisance.” When that nuisance shall have been
abated, those who do not drink the fluid for which, nevertheless, they
rºle. will at least be enabled to wash their hands in it without
shuddering.

In fact, it was a dead calm....For one whole day not a wave, not a
ripple, to be seen anywhere. The sails wouldn’t act, the rudder couldn't
act, we couldn't act. We had nothing to read, and had, as the notices
of weddings run, “no cards.” When I say we had nothing to read, I
do not mean that there was a scarcity of books; no, on the contrary,
the Commodore had three shilling volumes—The Gambler's something,
The ..". something else, and lations of a somebody. These we
had read, and hard work it was. The Lieutenant possessed an Alma.
nack, an Index to an Atlas (Atlas wanting), and part of a Catalogue of
the South Kensington Museum. I had two old letters unanswered, a
collection of small bills unpaid, a metallic pocket-boot without a pencil,
and a book of Black-Eyed Susan, with the cover off, and defective in
pages towards the climax. This last, and the Almanack, afforded us
some amusement in the earlier part of the day, from, I should say,
7 A.M. till 10; after that hour commenced an uncertainty about time in
eneral. The Lieutenant hadn't got a watch, the Commodore had lost

the course of an hour, I said I didn't think it was so very jolly, which
provoked the Commodore into remarking that I knew nothing about
yachting, and that if I was getting tired of it, I'd better give the
whole thing up. -
If ever I have a yacht of my own, I'll have a billiard table on,board.
That's what we wanted, a billiard table. The Commodore and Lieu-
tenant smoked incessantly fried to, but never can manage more than
two pipes and a half; and the half’s a little uncertain. I endeavoured
to get up a conversation, on a sailor's resources when there’s a calm,
Billiards for instance. They observed, Billiards! contemptuously. I
referred to Black-Eyed Susan as an authority. William, I recollected
used to swear pretty considerably, people on shore swabs,
land-lubbers, his wife's relations grampusses,...and a ploughman,
from whom he wished, to, gain, some, information, . "a dying dol-
phin; "...while on board he'd reef in yards, pipe broadsides to quarters,
stride like a lion with surf in his face, whispering “Susan,” to i.
the bullets in an action, bring other Fº on their beam ends, heave
a head, charge an elderly gentleman of bad character with." cutting the
painter of a pretty pinnace, and sending it (the pinnace) drifting without a
compass,” and so forth; but what he did when there was a calm doesn't
appear; unless at the end, which was torn out in my book, and then, if
iſ recollect right, the only time there was a calm, the Admiral took
advantage of it to try William by court-martial, and have him hanged
before it got rough again. I suggested to the Commodore that sailors
generally had a fiddle on board, and used to, dance. The Commodore
said grumpily, that there wasn’t a fiddle, and if there was he wouldn't
dance. The Lieutenant called upon me (he was lying stretched out
like, a star-fish) for a song, Being unable to oblige, I offered to read
Willian. Offer declined without thanks. I said I was sure I’d heard
something about dancing round the caboose, or spinning yarns over the
galley fire. I knew I’d seen a picture somewhere of “Saturday night at
sea.”. The answer to this, on the part of the Commodore, was, that,it
wasn't Saturday night. As to sitting round the galley fire in the
caboose, which was where the Treasure cooked, it was evident
that, as there was only room for the Treasure's head and shoulders,
three people attempting to dance there, or spin yarns, would find them-
selves inconveniently crowded. The subject, dropped. The Captain
here appeared and requested rations. Considering that it was calm,
and that the Captain was an Old Salt, he seemed to keep his legs very
badly. Qn his request not being immediately acceded to, he repeated
the word several times with variations, as if he had not, in the first
instance, succeeded in making himself sufficiently intelligible.
. The course he chose to adopt (these sailors are the queerest people!)
didn't improve matters, as he slipped from “Rations * down
“Rachel,” and from that to Rayshe,” when he caught hold of a rope
and then began to laugh as if he’d done something clever. As he ha
evidently come up to amuse us, I laughed too, just to humour him,

re gly.
It struck me at the same time that it evidently did the Commodore,
that this was the effect of a calm upon the Captain. e Lieutenant
thought that rations had something to do with it... I should perhaps

THE ALLOCUTION ON FREEMASONRY.
QWENERABLE Brothers of our sacrosanct Consistory,
There is a confraternity wrapt up in darkest mystery
Themselves the men of Masonry and Freedom they denominate:
All freedom, save our own, we do most utterly abominate.
This §§. pestilent Society,
United in the fellowship of error, and .#
Extends itself, O shame!, the whole world habitable wide over,
Beside that universal realm which we as King preside over.
Of all law, human and divine, the enemies these wretches are.
Tartarean brood, among the corn they, burn them, vilest vetches are.
They glory in the practice of all manner of atrocity, :
And specially addicted are to guzzling and gulosity.
There is in that proud Capital with River Thames irriguous,
A temple nearly to the Fields of Lincoln's Inn contiguous.
There are they wont to celebrate their.orgies with audacity
Unheard of, gormandising with incredible voracity.
What shall I say of gridirons when they neophytes initiate P
And what of red-hot pokers in commencing a noviciate
And what of those most horrid oaths, with ceremonies sinister, -
Which they are to each candidate reported to administer?
But what we most detest in them excites our ire professional;
It is that Secret which they keep in spite of the Confessional.
0 reticence most obstinate of stubborn indocility
That dares hold anything concealed from Our infallibility !
It is an error to believe in what they call their charity,
As though they with the Faithful were at all upon a parity,
Condemned be the suggestion of such scandalous º !
Their ends are eating, drinking, conviviality, and jollity.
The ruin of the Church and Civil Government they're aiming at.
No visionary phantom 'tis that we are now declaiming at ;
The Freemasons and Fenians are only two varieties
Of secret sacrilegious and heretical societies.
Their aprons be anathema, their gems and decorations all;
Their symbols, signs, and passwords we declare abominations all;
And, if they do not penance and submit to Qur authority,
Adjudge them to the regions of profound inferiority.
TWO MISTY ADWERTISEMENTS.
WE copy the following desirable investments from the Leeds Mercury.
The first is described as :—
Nº. a 60-inch SCRIBBLER, quite new. For particulars apply
, &c. &c.
What a rush there will be on the part of the worn-out periodicals,
to secure this, “Schi BBLER,” who is further recommended as bein
“quite newl" We hardly understand the distinction of “a 3.
scribbler”...Are the inches to be measured in length, or breadth, or
depth? If it is the latter, we are afraid that the “60-inch, scribbler.”
would be a bit of a bore. We like a writer to go to the heart of his
subject, but one who displayed his powers of penetration to the extent
of five feet, might carry his readers further than they would care about,
as it would require the most breathless attention on their part to be
able to follow him.
The second investment is one, considering its vast extent, that is not
often seen in the market:-
To bé SOLD, Eleven Acres of good FOG, &c. &c.
We did not know that “Fog” was an article of commerce, excepting
occasionally in articles of literary composition. In the latter case, the
“60-inch Scribbler,” above advertised, might, beneficially employ his
*...*. in clearing a way right through those." Eleven
Acres.” We are glad to notiee that the fog in question is particulari
as “good #. though what a good fog is, we doubt if any one,
unless he had lived in London all his life, would be able to tell. For
what we know, the advertisement may be a roundabout way of an-
nouncing the sale of a series of old parliamentary debates, for any
one who has attempted to travel through these foggy districts, could
well testify what tremendous “acres” they are l Curious town that
Leeds, where Scribblers and Fogs are kept on sale It may be that
the former may be partially the cause of creating the latter.

GRINDING AND CRAMMING.
“A TEACHER" writes to the Sheffield Telegraph to contradict the popular
notion that the youth of that town are such semi-savages as they are represented
to be in the Commissioners' late report. According to his version, they are bright,
knowing, intelligent lads, and up to all kinds of fun. With regard to the ignorant
answers attributed to them, he says:—
“The fact is, the Commissioners have been utterly sold by the small boys of Sheffield.”
With their uproarious sense of humour, these small boys could not,help, with
the quantity of dust, flying about them, just throwing a little into the eyes of
the “stately prigs” (so denominated by this most benevolent “Teacher”) who
came to examine them... These young blades, who evidently, do not belong to
the section of “Charitable Grinders,” are so delightfully cool, that it is no wonder
they oppose the introduction of the “Fan”, that is charitably proposed to ventilate
their rooms. Though they do object to being blown upon themselves, they do not
in the least mind blowing upon others. Their average of life may be extremely
short, but what does that matter, so long as it is a merry one? At the late
Cutlers' Feast, EARL Fitzwilliam stated that, in consequence of the dense smoke
round. Sheffield, all the big trees were fast disappearing from its neighbourhood.
We should rather be inclined to idoubt that fact in the presence of the above
gigantic hoax. . If there is any display of pictures, in the town, these poor Commis:
sioners might be exhibited, and appropriately labelled in the corner, “Sold.”
Having found out to their cost how excessively sharp these young filers are, they
will be very cautious, for the future, how they handle them. With sparks of
humour irradiating thus profusely from their wheels, instead of growing pre-
maturely old, they should with every turn, they give the wheel be ground young

MR. HOMEGREEN ON THE DROUGHT.
Sitch weather as we’ve had this two months past
I never know’d in all my life afoor.
I wonders how much longer ut ool last,
And when we be to haa some rain once moor.
As Scotchy sez in that are murderun play,
I gins to be aweary o' the zun,
As keeps a shinun on vrom day to day,
And wishes this here tajus drought was done.
The trees be powdered over all wi' dust
As bad amost as livery-footmen's heads.
O' moonlight nights you’d fancy, like, at fust,
The white was frost upon the barns and sheds.
As for the turmuts, they be done for, some,
As 'tis; I s'pose there wun't be mare a crop.
The mangold, too, bids foul to turn out rum,
'Tis sitch a while since they’ve had are a drop.
The darth o' roots must tell upon the stock;
And then the hay was no great shakes this year.
'Twool be a tryun time for drove and flock,
And mate, no doubt, 'ool goo on gettun dear.
Well, there, if prices rises, to be sure,
'Tis broad as ut is long, or thereabout,'
So fur, the cattle-plag is uts own cure;
And that's our consolation for the drought.
Then there's the pigs a payun well in parts,
The young uns, hereabouts, they fetches, now,
At laste a pound each—bless their little hearts!
Happy the man as owns a good old sow.
But, howsomedever, if the sky’ood change
No doubt but what 'twould be the best for all;
This brightness out o' sazon do sim strange:
The clouds 'ool be relief when comes rainfall.
There han’t a bin, this last September, what

Instead o' which we’ve had it dry and hot -
Just then when mostly storms and showers prevails.
Well, soon or late, and very soon, may be,

The heavens all blue, from clouds that’s now so free,
May turn all black as this here ink instead.
And when the wet do come, ’tis ten to one
That cats and dogs will tumble down in showers;
Because a truer sayun there is none

THE HEALTH OF THE METROPOLIS.
OUR own Private Officer (no less an officer because
Private) deputed by our own Board of Health (need, we
say our carefully-provided dinner-table?), has furnished us
with the following Report:-
“People residing in the neighbourhood of the Monument
should in this hot weather be cautious. The Monument is
very high. Let the authorities look to it. (We saw a
policeman looking at it, but that's not the same §§ -
“The residents in the Temple complain that the City is
very close. Now, if it is close to them, what must it be to
the inhabitants of Cheapside and Cornhill? More air.
“Near Commercial Road East, in a populous locality,
the inattention of the authorities is most reprehensible.
There is a dead wall in this neighbourhood, in the º:
street, close by the pavement, and no steps have been taken
for its removal. (We saw some one taking steps in this
direction, but it was the Lamplighter.)”
** Similia Similibus !”
WE read that “a new process of º On

adapted for all blockheads, and the members of different
Boards. Persons who are plain, however, object to this
new style of portraiture, for fear that they might, should
the wood be in the least ill-grained, come out a deal plainer.

PITY THE POOR PARTRIDGE SHOOTERS I
MY DEAR SMITH,
WHEN Hamlet wished his “too, too solid flesh would melt,” he
should have tried a few days' shooting in such sunshine as we lucky
dogs have recently been roasted in. The oldest sportsmen never knew
such a sweltering September. The thermometer has been standing at
90° in the shade of the biggest mangelwurzel. And such whoppers
there are this year! at least in Mangelwuzzelshire. , I constantly was
buried to my armpits in their leaves, and, my stature being short, I was
really half afraid of a complete interment. Once, forgetting where I
was, I screamed for the police to come to my assistance; and I wildly
fired my gun as a signal of distress. But all I got by the explosion was
another one—of wrath—on the part of my companions; who told me I
had spoiled a lovely point the dog was making, and had caused a
splendid covey to rise clean out of shot. I solemnly assured them that,
standing where I did, I could not see the pointer, and so it was no
wonder that I did not see the point. But they did not seem to see the
point of my remark, and the keeper muttered something about “might
as, º: go home,” which, as there was beer there, I thought we really
might.
This was the only covey that we saw this day; and indeed, in the
respect of our not seeing many birds, any one º; of the week was just
like any other. They seemed to have swallowed fern seed, and so made
themselves invisible; or else they got into the rabbit holes to get out
of the heat, or sat up in the oak trees, where no pointer could get scent
of them. Partridges º object to being roasted, baked, or
rilled, before they are shot; and whenever in hot weather they play at
ide-and-seek, with you, it is most difficult to find them. With the
exception of the signal of distress that I have mentioned,. I only fired
my gun off six times in six days; and, although my aim is usually
unerring, it happened that the #. quite neutralised its accuracy.
Wonderful as it. may seem, I did not bag one bird of all the six I shot
at! So extraordinary a fact deserves to be recorded, and in the cause
of science I do not hesitate to mention it. Several theories were
adduced to account for the phenomenon, and some, although ingenious
Were .# complimentary. For instance, one young friend º:
that possib # I missed because “the sun was in my eyes,” by which he
meant that I had taken too much beer at luncheon. Another playfully
alleged that the partridges escaped, because I shut, my eyes while
shooting, which was the fact on one occasion I .# admit, for
exactly at the moment when I raised my gun to shoot, a little fly flew
up my nose and made me want to sneeze, and somehow I am always
forced to shut my eyes while sneezing. My own idea is, that the heat
Wol. XLIX.—1865.
was so intense that the shot was melted instantly on leaving the muzzle
of the gun, and being fused thus, fell to earth directly in a semi-liquid
state, or if it reached the birds, it singed their feathers merely, and was
far too soft to penetrate.
So, my dear fellow {. see, the sad truth must be owned, that birds
of my own shooting f really none to send you; and indeed if I had
bagged any, the weather was so hot, I should have scarcely dared to
send them... My friends, whose shot Ifancy was harder than my own,
and not so liable to melt, contrived after vast labour to get a few brace
every day; but I thought you would best relish the birds I shot myself,
and so I waited in the hope of seeing some that I could shoot. For
fear of its not keeping, we ate up every day for dinner nearly all the
game we bagged, and then consumed at breakfast the small remnant
that was left. So you see, it . was not possible to send off any
birds; for with the cattle disease about us, we dared not eat much beef
or mutton, and if we had sent our game away, we might have very
nearly starved ourselves. -
I trust this candid explanation will fully satisfy your mind that I
have not forgotten you, or the promise that I made, which I hope,
weather permitting, to keep next season without fail.
Meanwhile, pray believe me, yours, most sincerely, glad to have
returned to London, dull and dismal as it is, when every one is out of it,

SCENES IN THE WEDDING RING.
HERE are some entertainments that we little suspected were taking
place daily in the wedding ring:—
OUR FUTURE HUSBAND, OR WIFE'S, TRUE CARTE DE
VISITE.-Monsieur BLAGUE, the celebrated French Astrologer, will send the
true Carte de Visite of your Intended, with Name, Age, and Date of Marriage for
Sixteen Stamps. State age and sex. Send stamped directed envelope.—Address
“M.” &c., &c., &c.
How the Clown to the above Ring, must laugh in his sleeve at the
fools who patronise his entertainment! We wonder whose photograph
he conjures up for their delusion? It may be MULLER, or DR.
PRITCHARD, or some female, impostor, or malefactor, whose portraits he
has picked º as a cheap lot. The simpleton, who sent his sixteen
stamps, would never be any the wiser. The cry was, a short time ago,
that no one could marry under £300 a year. The completest contra-
diction to that high-priced estimate is the above advertisement, wherein
it appears that anyone can procure a husband, or a wife, for the low
figure of one-and-fourpence! What amuses us in MonsLEUR BLAGUE's
announcement is, that nothing is hinted about the chances of rejection:
Once armed with the carte de visite of your intended, the most timid
Irishman, the most nervous widow, can propose with every certainty of
success. It would be a long-lived disappointment, however, to the poor
DULCINEA who, believing thoroughly in the matrimonial validi } of the
photographed MULLER, wandered patiently through the world, in the
hopes of meeting with her future husband In only one respect do we
find fault with Monsieur BLAGUE. Having given the name, and the
age, and the date, &c., why not have gone a little further, and have
promised to furnish the fire of the eyes, the luxuriance of the whiskers,
the architecture of the nose, the longitude of the purse, the texture of
the hair, and many other particulars most interesting “to persons about
to marry?” We are strongl tempted to enter into competition with
this “celebrated French astrologer,” and to beat him out of the field by
outbidding him. - - - -
As a proof that we mean mischief, we beg to inform Mons/EUR BLAGUE,
that we have forwarded his real name and address, (at least, those as
given by him, in his advertisements) to the *::::::: Society. He
may thank his lucky stars, if he is not taken up, before the week is over,
for obtaining money under false pretences. It is a question also,
whether the proprietors of provincial newspapers, who insert the men-
dacious advertisements of this “celebrated French astrologer,” might
not similarly be taken into custody for aiding and *. m in his
nefarious practices. The next Carte de Visite they should deal with
ought to be the Police Wan.
A ST. PATRICK IN PETTICOATS.
A FRENCH woman has been earning many hundreds of francs by
destroying vipers. It appears that she possesses a wondrous skill in
finding out the hiding place of all poisonous reptiles, and of then attracting
them to the surface, when she can do what she pleases with, them,
Why does not the English Government engage her services, and send
her to Ireland? She might be profitably employed there in tracing out
the various dark haunts of the Fenians, and, hunting them from spot to
spot, succeed in either destroying them, or else driving them effectually
out of the country—thereby saving an infinity of trouble to the con-
stabulary, the magistracy, the judges and juries, and all legal function-
aries, including, it may be, the assistance of a gentleman, who generally
“hangs out” at the Old Bailey.

“OUR JENKINs, Punch's JENKINs, is not dead.” He has neither
been translated into the seventh heavens by chronicling LoRD GRAN-|ball
VILLE's wedding for the Times, nor sunk below the nether deep by
the heavy sarcasms of the Saturday Review, JENKINs is immortal; and
like Brahma hath many avatars. Following the fashion of those nobles
of the land whom he loves, Jenkins, is on the moors / Yes, he is at
this present writing incarnate in a Scottish body—called there “buddy”
—and wears the grey, kilt and blue honnet of the Gillie. But even
there and thus attired, instead of rifle or spy-glass, he wields the
immortal pen, wherewith he stalks a statelier, game, than even the
great red-deer—the princes of the Land! Hark to the crack of the
well-known weapon!
“On Friday last, a grand deer drive took place in the forest of Abergeldie. To
the wooded profile of Craig Yoniso the antlered monarchs were driven from the
sheltered dales and corries around. Capital T. was had by the PRINCE or WALE’s
and party, amongst whom was the Chief of Invercauld, the gallant Colonel FAR-
Suhanson, who shot down two fine stags as the swaying herd swept past. Bang
bang, went the PRINCE of WALEss rifle, and other two noble stags bit the dust, ani
rolled dead in the blooming purple heather. Other two stags fell, one of which was
killed by the youthful MR. Phipps. On the home route two pretty roebucks were
shot by the party, which concluded the day's sport.”
This is something like word-painting. How the scene rises before us.
The “antlered monarchs” driven to “the wooded profile of Craig
Yoniso.”-OssiaN, by heavens !—the grim suspense and murderous
aim of the Chief of Invercauld, the gallant FARQUHARson, “as the
swaying herd sweeps past”—the “bang! bang!” of the Prince's
rifle—the noble stags performing that kotow to a Prince which Jenkins
loves, and winding up their rapid act of submission by the well-known
feats of “biting the dust,” and “rolling over in the purple heather!!”
Then how instinct with the delicately discriminated Jenkinsian
colour, is the rallentando movement. “Other two stags .# one of
which was killed by the youthful, MR. PHIPPs.” . It would take a
column of comment to bring out all the subtlety of compliment, the
latent grace of suggestion, in this short sentence. Observe, the stags
that fall to the rifle of the Prince are “noble;” not so the creatures
that succumb to the more plebeian bullets of the suite—they are “stags.”
simple, and unadorned. Nor are their deaths of the ornately respectful
kind practised by the happy quadrupeds who are honoured by the Prince's
in their briskets. . They..." bite the dust,” and “roll over in the
purple heather;” the stags killed by the commonalty content themselves
with, “falling.” Then note the sense of that, dignified courtesy which
should enshrine all belonging to a Court in “the youthful MR. PHIPPs"
—not “PHIPPs Junior,” nor. “Young Phipps,” nor even “Young
MR. PhIPPs,” but “the Youthful MR. PhIPPs"
This is how history should be written I Touched thus by a master-
hand, what delicacies of respect may be conveyed by language—how
tropes and figures, epithets and idioms, may plain adjectives and sub-
stantives, may be compelled to pay homage to rank and station, and to
bow them down at the shrine of Snobocracy, of which JENKINs is the
high-priest,!
Complementary Colours.
The Irish Republic which the Fenian traitors conspired to establish
may, if regarded with reference to its objects, be considered a Re
Republic. Contemplated, however, with a view to the means and
measures whereby the conspirators proposed to effect their design, the
projected Republic of the Emerald Isle assumes a tint in character with
that of the gem which is associated with the name of Erin. Although
it, found no favour with the Irish nation, it wore the national colour.
The Fenian Irish Republic was a Green Republic.

FROM A VALUED CONTRIBUTOR.
-> Grosvenor Square.
2–EAR MR. PUNCH,-Though
S– now very different from what
they were when I last wrote
to 3.", I have no desire to
make you feel the distance
which exists between us,
and I address you politely
and even playfully as hereto-
fore. It is not probable that
you will have many opportu.
nities of being tempted to
take advantage of º affabi-
lity, as, though Ishall always
be glad to hear that you are
conducting yourself well, and
.# the rules of
society will prevent our being
intimate for the future. It
is due to you that I should
state what has occurred, so
that your !. good sense
may prompt you to assume
Yº- a befitting social attitude in
“º to myself.
y last letter, dated from
, , , Drumnadrochit, apprised you
that I was in retirement at that delightful locality, and was seeking
communion with the Spirit of Nature. It is probable that some very
remarkable literary compositions would have resulted, had I remained in
yonder Glen. It is a place for the Poet-Philosopher. A short walk from
the Drumnadrochit, Inn (the admirable hostess does well to retain the
good old word of “kindest welcome”) takes you into sequestered glades
of deepest shade, where you hear no sound but the voice of rivers, the
song of birds, and the fizzing of your own fusees. Or, if you will, you
may ascend a lofty and cragged hill in the rear of your inn, and, on
onder rock reclining your fierce and swarthy form behold, and you
ve a glorious prospect of mountain and valley, the blue ioch Ness on
your left, Mealſourvonie, giant of the Seafield star, before you, and to
our right a noble group of mountains studding the scene to the west.
#. midges will not bite you much, at least not very much, if you smoke
; If hungry, which it is difficult to be aſter Highland meals
there are heaps of what we call blackberries, but which the Scots call
brambles, and whereof they make a jelly, which is tolerable. I mention
all details, for nothing escapes the true artist—it is your smatterer who
dwells in slovenly generalities. HomeR tells you of the nail on which
the hero hangs his sword.
Believe me if all those endearing old charms which I gazed on while
squat in yon brae had been permitted to exert their influence on my
naturally romantic and impressionable nature, I should have produced
a poem which would have been Some, as my American friends say. I
found myself unconsciously turning my mind to lyrical construction
and constantly inventing rhymes to the names of the mountains an
other prominent objects around me. This showed that §. inspira-
tion was coming—that the tripod was steaming for the Sibyl. Drum-
madrochit itself had been a good deal rhymed to by ingenious persons
who had inscribed poems in the visitors’ book at the inn. (MR. John
BRIGHT, by the way, has written verses therein, and they do credit to
his humanity and also to his ear.) Pocket occurs rather promptly in
aid of the bard, and so does Lucy Lockit. But Mealfourvonie was
rather a .. and I was reminded of another distinguished author
who designed a poem on the Mediterranean Sea, but gave it up because
the name would not come into heroic verse. The name of the mountain
means a heavy lump on a dull Moor, and might therefore apply to the
severe criticism you might inflict on a bad performance of Othello. I
was one aſternoon reposing in the shades and coverts hid from day, and
meditating an ode on the eclipse of the moon (which occurred on the
previous might, and was caused by the shadow of the earth being pro-
jected upon the lesser planet) when a beautiful Highland maiden stood
before me. My story does not connect itself with the history of this
damsel, therefore spare the sneer which I already behold forming itself
upon the editorial lip. You speak falsely. I am not forty-four, and my
hair is not grey-not very grey—and if both assertions were true, they
are nothing to the purpose. A man's age is what he feels. Is Lord
PALMERSTON old? Are you young P But I repeat that I have not a
love story to relate upon the present occasion, though, were my adven-
tures truthfully told, which they never shall be, it might be found that
ad not been less fortunate in securing the virtuous admiration of the
other sex than many who talk constantly of such things, and ostenta-
tiously wear hair watch-guards and photographic lockets.
“A gentleman was wanting you,” said the bright-eyed and dark-
haired maiden.
our respective positions are ||P.
Pºe. he want me still, MARGARET ** I replied, with a pleasant
Smile.
“In your room,” returned MARGARET.
“And I, with poetic negligence, have left all my P. lying on the
table,” said I, “and he will see that confidential letter from Lorn
N, who writes such a great big hand that the most delicately-
minded visitor could not help seeing what he says about GL–E.”
“Toddy,” said. MARGARET, who hates to wear out her words by
using too many of them.
“'Tis well, MARGARET,” I said, “Thoair doumbh pooag.”
Gracefully, modestly, she received my paternal salute #. her brow
and retired. She will tell her great-grandchildren, in their Highland
home, that at the age of nine she had been honoured by a kiss from the
great EpicuRUs Rotundus, the Saxon Poet-Philosopher.
To spring from my rocky seat, snatch my long Highland hooked staff,
and bound away, like a deer of the region, down the perilous glen, to
cross the bridge, and to dash up the road until I gained my inn, might
have been the work of ten minutes, if I hurried myself, but as I
never do, I was home in about half an hour. Ascending to my drawing-
room, I found a gentleman awaiting me, and, as little MARGARET had
hinted, beguiling the interval with the Wine of the Country.
“Your health in a Dram, Sir,” he said, as I entered.
This phrase, Sir, is now used far and wide over the Highlands. It
was invented, it seems, about five years ago by some frivolous contri-
butor of yours who visited, or says he visited, this inu at Drumna-
drochit, and who wrote to you in its praise. ANDERson's Guide to the
Highlands says, “At the mouth of Glen Urquhart there is a large and
excellent inn, Drumnadrochit, long a favourite, but now still better
known to fame by a letter from ******* ****** to Punch.” And
that dispatch is still written of, in Scottish newspapers, as the “famous
letter.” Your contributor, whoever he was, need not, if he still exists,
be particularly proud of this, for the Durham Letter and many other
State º are as well known in history as the Drumnadrochit Letter.
And this phrase about the dram, was, it seems, introduced in a ridicu-
lous manner into the document in question. -
“You are very good,” I said, loftily, and with that icy intonation
which effectually chills the presumptuous.
“I hope to show myself moderately so,” he replied, humbly. -
|...} softening, I expressed my regret that I had detained him,
and begged to know in what way I could be of use to him.
“I must preface my answer with a little narrative, Sir,” he said.
“I do not want any steel pens, any water-colour drawings, or any
Commentary on the Scriptures to be Fº in 75, numbers, and
paid for in advance, mind that,” I said, myself mindful of sells which
are constantly attempted at what was my London residence.
“But I have nothing to sell you,” he replied.
This made me more distrustful. -
“I am not going to save a virtuous tradesman from ruin by advancing
ten pounds on a pianoforte that can be shown to have cost a hundred
and eighty guineas, money to be returned with fifty per cent. interest
the day after to-morrow.”
... But I do not need to borrow,” he said.
“I subscribe to nothing except the Thirty-Nine Articles and the
Opera,” I said, very sternly.
“You owe me no subscription, as King Lear observes,” was his
reply.
Will, I thought that I had taken sufficient care of myself by this
time, so I said that I should be º to hear what he had to say.
*You will be happier still, Sir, I hope, when you shall have heard
me,” says he.
: Why, yes, Sir, one is always glad when a story is over,” says.I.
“That is not my meaning, Sir,” he replied, smiling. “Will you
allow me to ask you a question?”
“Certainly. In fact, I don't see how I can hinder you, except by
running out of the room. I shall answer it or not, of course, as may
seem good unto me.”
“Then I would ask, Sir, whether you remember travelling on the
Great Northern Railway on the 6th of August, last year?'
“I have a reason for remembering that date, ...]I know that I was
travelling on the line and day you mention.”
“Do you, Sir, also recollect that at a certain place you saw a number
of men digging in a field near the line, and that you kindly flung down
a newspaper to them **
“It may be so. I am always doing kind things, and seldom get
thanked for them, except by my own approving conscience.”
“There will be an exception in this case, Sir. I was one of those
workmen. The paper fell nearest to me. For that reason, and because
I could lick any of the others, and because I was the only one who
could read, it was decided that Ishould have the paper. It is here.”
He produced from a velvet cover, richly jewelled, an excessively dirty
and crumpled copy of one of your contemporaries.
“This is it.”
“You were very welcome to the paper,” I said. “I am sure that I
should not have thrown it out unless I had quite done with it.”
“Sir,” he said, “there was Fate in the act, and you were the agent

often referred to. " If it is

amazingly, had it not been
for the learned friend who
accompanied me to the
Adelphi last week, and
another friend who came
with my learned friend. One
of them “knew all about it,
and had seen it before—
twice,” and the other had
not only never seen it, but,
having been a long time in
the country, had never even
visited the Gallery during
the present régime. This
latter gentleman was firmly impressed with the conviction that every
one was either a MR. or MRs. German Reed, or MR. John PARRY.
My enjoyment was marred somewhat in this fashion:—

First Friend (who has seen it before, leaning against me). Capitally
painted, isn't it? ... (As if I couldn't see this for myself. However, I say
‘Yes,” and hope that there’s an end of it.) -

programme). Have you got a bill P (I hand it to him in silence.)
Enter Three Chinamen, dancing and singing. I laugh, and am
pleased.

there I knew). All right. H-s-s-s-h! (This is said sotto voce, and depre-
catingly.)

THE MACADAM OF PARIS.
“GENTLY over the stones” is an admonition which the state of the
roads in and about London, at intervals not too long, constantly im-
presses on everybody who rides a horse or drives a vehicle. Gently
over the stones, Jehu, unless you can manage to drive by them at your
own pace, between them and the footway, which F. are commonly
prevented from doing by logs of wood, or masses of rock, obstructing
the side of the road that has not been mended. As you go gently over
the stones, rough angular pieces of granite, you contribute in some
small degree towards crushing them into a passable state, under the
wheels of your carriage and the feet of your horses, on which, in the
meanwhile, they inflict a large measure of damage. You and your cattle
alike suffer from a barbarous arrangement, which combines churlishness
to man with cruelty to animals. How long, ye Commissioners of
Works, and ye Local Powers, will you persist in this hoggish º:
Cannot you do, as well as Frenchmen, what is thus described by the
correspondent of the Post at Paris?—
“Steam scavengers and “macadamiers," having been found to answer their pur-
pose extremely well in the streets of Paris, we have now in daily operation a steam-
roller for crushing the stones and levelling and consolidating the roads."
Do you doubt, gentlemen, so to call you, that a steam-roller, is a
thing more suitable to crush stones with than carriage-wheels and the
feet of horses are? Then read on :-
“This powerful machine weighs about 14,000 kilogrammes, and is now being
worked with the utmost facility on the Pont Royal, making the ascents and descents
without the least difficulty.”
Considering the weight necessary to overcome the resistance offered
by stones to the agent of crushing them, you must see that a steam-
roller would constitute an appliance for performing that process con-
siderably better adapted for it, and more effectual besides, than at least
your own carriages, or your own horses.
Know also that two men, an engine-driver and a stoker, suffice to
work the Parisian steam-roller, so that the employment of that con-
trivance would be in no wise objectionable, even to penny-wisdom or
parochial economy. And when you are told that it is found not to
frighten the horses whose feet it saves, you are deprived of all excuse
that negligence, indifference, and pigheadedness, could allege for not
managing this matter of macadamising, as well as it, among other
matters, is managed in France. If the French were our natural enemies,
instead of being our natural allies, the maxim fas est et ab hoste doceri
might admonish you to learn of them how to mend your ways.

OCH, bad luck to the dhrink that bedivilled our rason,
An' degraded us down to the level uv bastes,
Or we wouldn't have played the low game uv high trason,
An' conspired to desthroy all the gintry and praists.
It was fun for a º to rehearse insurrection
Overnight, but the evenin's amusement, he feels,
Won't at all at all bear the next mornin's reflection,
When he wakes up an’ finds himself laid by the heels.
Thin he º to himself. Without cause to turn thraitor,
What a big fool, an' jackass, bedad, I have been 1
Just through takin' too much of a dhrop o' the cratur;
An' the fº. I’ve got, divil fetch the potheen!
There was thraitors’mongst thraitors when dhrunk and deluded,
We were larned in the goose-step to practise our legs,
Or on plots uv rebellion an' massacre brooded,
Like the geese that sits tryin' to hatch addled eggs.
Ah, the base dhirty blackgyards! 'twas false that they played us,
For they pached on their own pot-companions in guilt.
To the Governmint Judases went an’bethrayed us;
There was no blood but only the buttermilk spilt.
Allus boys in our brogues might have doomed been to dyin',
With our heels in the air or our heads upon blocks;

A FEARFUL WARNING.
WE copy the following from an amusing American paper, called the
New York Saturday Erpress:–
“The Fenians are obtaining a foothold in Dublin, and there is some prospect,
therefore, that the beautiful city will soon be ‘governed by the Irish.” Our Dublin
friends wh9 have visited New York, and seen how splendidly the Irish govern here,
must be delighted.”
Our Transatlantic well-wisher will have found out by this time tha
the only “foothold” the Fenians have obtained in Dublin has been in
the law courts. The Irish rowdies are always complaining that they
are ill-governed. We will not be so malicious as to wish that the day
may ever arrive when they shall have an opportunity of being governed
by themselves. As to how . govern others, we would point to the
excesses, the abuses, the endless acts of corruption in the New York
State, and which shameless acts are mainly attributable to the influence
the Irish rowdies exercise over the city and other elections. Frightened
by the example of their brethren in America, we think it will be a long
time before Dublin thinks of crying out, “New York, you’re wanted.”
Even John BRIGHT himself, we imagine, would object to any of our
institutions being Hibernico-Americanised.

PUNCH, OR THE IMONDON CHARIVARI.
DISRAELI”s LAST.
IND MR. BENJAMIN
DISRAELI has said a
great many good
things in his time;
but, of all of them,
BEN's last is his best.
It was spoken the
other day at Amer-
sham, where DIzzy
was the guest of the
Amersham and Che-
sham Agricultural
Association, and, after
making some observa-
tions about leases,
delivered his opinion
“as to the expedi-
ency of rewarding
long service, by a pe:
cuniar donation.”
The Ex-CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequER
and leader of the Con-
servative party in the
House of Commons
declared that he ap-
proved of that prac-
tice, and in answer to
the objection that the
sum usually awarded
to meritorious labour.
ers is small, advanced
the exquisite argu-
ment reported as fol-
lows:—
“It is a very great mis-
take to suppose that be-
cause to the editor of a
newspaper, who perhaps receives £1,000 a year, the reward may seem trifling, therefore it is small in the
estimation of the person who receives it. Recollect, you must estimate the value of a reward of £3 to a
labourer in proportion to his income. 4:3 to a labourer with 12s., a week represents a sum equivalent to
£500 or £600 to a gentleman worth £5,000 a year. . Now I have observed that gentlemen in the receipt of
£5,000 a year are not absolutely indifferent to the chances of receiving £400 or £500 extra. (Laughter.)”
* Naturally the squirearchical and agricultural auditors of this comic reasoning laughed to
hear it. To be sure it constituted, and of course it was meant for, a joke at their expense;
which they did not see. But they took a keen satire on their parsimony for, a jocular illus-
tration of their munificence; and so they laughed. They particularly relished the idea, ironi.
cally suggested to them, that, at the sacrifice of only three sovereigns, they were really
bestowing, on the receiver of that absolutely not large amount, the relative equivalent of five
hundred pounds.
It is almost cruel to open their eyes; but yet pity guides the hand of the surgeon that
couches for cataract. Let, them, understand, then, that there is a converse to the state-
ment which so highly delighted them. True, £3 stumpy down, is a great deal of money in
proportion to 12s. a-week. But, on the other hand, 12s, a week is a very small income in
proportion to £5,000 a year. Not only that, but it is a very wretched income, a yery insuffi-
cient income, for any man whose wants are above the wants of a beast; and it is hardly
sufficient for those. - - - -
Never did there issue from the enclosure of our BENJAMIN's teeth a jest more incisive
than the mock eulogy with which he affected to flatter the members of the Amersham
and Chesham Agricultural Society. What an advantage, however, it is to be pachy-
dermatous, and to feel the sensation of being smartly whipped, as an agreeable tickling !
OLD SAWS NEW SET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
. I AM just home, from a foreign tour which, I have relished incontinently...well.
Musing one day on the subject of proverbs—by a singular coincidence I was on the A at
the time—it struck me that many, saws of English manufacture were rusty, antiquated, and
not sufficiently polished, and might be reset to the gain of a genteel generation which has
ceased, to calf a spade a spade, and only knows it as a gardening implement. Possessed
with this idea I set to work, and gave my nights and days to adapting a few familiar pro-
verbs to modern ways and customs. . I now submit my brainwork to your judgment, in
the hope that you will not object to give a world-wide currency to the new mintage.

NOTHING
CERTAIN.
Mother-in-Law. “AH, MR. S., when I HAVE LEFT You For EveR, You'll, Miss ME THEN 1"
MR, CARLYLE ON PROGRESS,
To Hobson Dobson, Esq., Chairman of the Omnium Junction
Railway Company.
WoRTHY SIR,
In the concluding volume of MR. Thomas CARLYLE's Life of
Friederich the Second, you will find these words:—
“These are the results for England, and in the rear of these, had those and the
other elements once ripened for her, the r country is to get into such merchan-
disings, colonisings, foreign settlings, gold nuggetings, as lay beyond the drunkenest
dreams of JENKINs (supposing JENKINs addicted to liquor); and in fact, to enter
into an universal uproar of Machineries, El Dorados, Unexampled Prosperities,
which make a great noise for themselves in the very days now come, Prosperities
evidently not of a sublime type, which, in the meanwhile, seem to be ...; the
at one time creditably clean and comely face of England with mud-blotches, soot-
blotches, miscellaneous squalors and horrors; to be preaching into her amazed
heart, which once knew better, the omnipotence of shoddy; filling her ears and soul
with shriekery and metallic clangour, mad noises, mad noises mostly nowhither;
and are awakening, I suppose, in such of her sons as still go into reflection at all, a
;. and more anxious set of questions than have ever risen in England's history
efore."
May I be allowed to offer you a brief exposition of part of the fore-
going, text? It is not nonsense, Sir, as you perhaps hastily call it,
prefixing a strong epithet to a contemptuous appellation. No, Sir,
neither is it ridiculous nonsense. It is strange lan , I grant you
very different from that of a prospectus, but there is a sense in it, an
that sense is no laughing matter. The meaning of it, Sir, is awful,
perfectly awful.
What do you suppose, Sir, that MR. CARLYLE means by the “mer-
chandisings, colonisings, ºf settlings, gold nuggetings, machineries,
El Dorados, and Unexampled Prosperities” of which he speaks so dis.
respectfully? You will shudder, Sir, when I tell you that he means the
development of the commerci and industrial resources, mechanical
and material progress, of the British Empire, on which the sun never
sets! These are the things which he speaks of as transcending the
“drunkenest.dreams” of a base and servile individual. Is not this
:::::: mention of the most important if not sacred things unspeakably
Shocking
By the “Prosperities evidently not of a sublime type,” which MR.
CARLYLE represents as “ tºº, the at one time creditably clean and
comely face of England with mud-blotches, soot-blotches, miscellaneous
.." and horrors,” he means those extensive works which now
abound in almost every neighbourhood, and constitute sources of such
ample emolument to their proprietors, whilst they only deposit an
amount of carbonaceous matter on the adjacent objects, or darken and
blanch the vegetation, or impregnate the streams in the vicinity to a
certain extent with mineral or other matter. “Shoddy,”, Sir, is in
MR. CARLYLE's vocabulary, a synonymous expression for—what do you
think? The manufactures, Sir, of Great Britain! - .
Under the denomination of “shriekery and metallic clangour,” this
extremely vituperative writer rails, excuse the jocosity, Sir, at railways.
Fancy that! As if railways, or any other means of procuring wealth
were not matters to which all considerations of a merely sentimental
nature ought to be sacrificed. -
What are we to think, Sir, of a man who sneers at the omnipotence
of Shoddy?...What, but that he is a most impious blasphemer of Mam-
mon. . No, Sir, let us first seek profitable investments, and the return
of dividend at a high ſº and rest satisfied that everything else
that is worth a thought will accrue to us of course.
I have the honour to be, &c.,
Fogy JIM.
An Injury that is not to be admitted at any Price.
The authorities of Hamburgh have prohibited the importation into
their port of “all skins and hides coming from England.” This may
sound like ingratitude on their part after the free way in which we have
recently imported their Hamburgh Sherry; but no one would question
the wisdom of the step, as those i.; poisoners know well enough
that any skin, or hide, that once had undergone a soaking in the above
deleterious mixture, would be so thoroughly worthless as to fall in value
below the consideration even of a Tanner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR YACHT.
OUR yachting is over for this year. I send you the account of our
last few days. After the calm came a storm. The Captain and the
Treasure became so hopelessly intoxicated that we had to manage the
vessel ourselves. We first found it out in consequence of a delay on
the part of the Treasure in bringing in dinner. , We found him in the
caboose boiling our compass in a stewpan, while the Captain was
doubled up in a corner nodding and smiling like a Mandarin. On
remonstrating with the Treasure he became obstinately polite, and
clung to the repetition of one word, “tessermonels,” by which we
gradually understood him to mean that he could refute the present
charge of intoxication by reference to his testimonials. The Captain
only shook his head and muttered “rations.” ...I called to mind, the
Mutiny of the Bounty, and thought what a horrible thing it would be if
our Crew suddenly broke out into open defiance of authority. How-
ever, they didn’t mutiny, but went fast asleep. - -
The Commodore was now obliged to take the steering in hand. We,
that is the Lieutenant and myself, managed the sails; and it is really
as easy as possible to haul in the mainsail-gaff, and the top jib-boom
and so forth, although it sounds difficult. The question arose as to
where the land was f I thought that it was on the right. The Com-
modore asked how far off?. I referred to the index of my map, but as
º ** no map with it, this proceeding did not help us to any great
extent.
When night set in should we still go on sailing P the Lieutenant
asked. The Commodore said, why not? I agreed with him, why
not? Because, the Lieutenant reminded us, the compass was broken
and how could we steer without a compass? I agreed with him, and
put this question to the Commodore as a poser. He was ready for the
emergency. “How,” he asked, “did people steer when they hadn't
compasses, eh?” I gave it up; sº did the Lieutenant at first, though
as an after-thought he said, “By the stars.” Very well, returned the
Commodore, then we’ll steer by the stars, and thought he’d settled the
matter. I asked, “By what stars?” and the Commodore said, that “if
I was going to play the fool and upset all his arrangements, we’d better
ive the whole thing up.” I wanted to make a few further inquiries,
ut the Commodore said he must steer, and I oughtn't to speak to the
man at the wheel. , Taking advantage of his inability to quit his post,
the Lieutenant and myself went for’ard, and after a short conversation
settled that * by the stars was humbug. The Captain and
Treasure were still heavily asleep. Towards evening it began to rain.
I didn't know that it did rain at sea; I thought it was only on land to
make yegetables grow. It rained until it was dusk, and then a bit of
a wind sprung up. Most extraordinary thing, as I told the Lieutenant,
that I always thought the wind went down at night. The Lieutenant,
who, had been getting more and more disagreeable ever since the
insubordination of the Crew, said, “Down where P” If the Com-
modore hadn't asked him to take a turn at the wheel we should have
quarrelled. He didn't manage the steering well, and took, the Commodore
informed me, all the wind out of our sails. 'ſ know they began to flap
about in a vacillating manner, and the Commodore remonstrated. The
Lieutenant, who was very grumpy, said, “He’d better do it himself, if
he was so clever.” I tried to pacif them by saying what did it matter?
Qn which they both replied, “Oh, didn't it matter?” sarcastically.
Luckily the Captain was suddenly restored to consciousness, and came
aſ with, a rather dazed expression. He said, he couldn't make out
what had been the matter with him. He hoped we didn't think it was
anything like intoxication. We confessed that we thought the
symptoms somewhat similar, but he explained to us that in his case it was
a sort of a something that he'd once had when he was a child, and the
doctors said it wouldn't come again. He believed he’d never quite
#9t over the measles. He strongly reprehended the conduct of the
Treasure; and proposed that he should be discharged at Liverpool.
He took the elm, and we were all silent and sulky. I made up my
mind that I’d desert when I got on shore, and I think we all, when we
#d speak, came to the conclusion that we wanted a larger yacht. The
Treasure woke up, and became obstreperous and quarrelsome at mid-
night. He engaged in a single-handed combat with the Captain, and
his foot slipping, he was luckily knocked down the companion and shut
up in, our cabin, where he abused us through the skylight until he
went to sleep again. His imprisonment prevented us from taking our
natural rest below. So we sat on deck and tried to pretend we were
§oying ourselves. The Commodore looked glum, and smoked.
The Lieutenant squatted with his chin on his knees and grumbled:
while I spent my hours in drowsily meditating on Hilliam, Susan, the
nautical drama, my costume waiting for me at L'pool, and the probable
expenses of our trip. Morning broke: grey, dull, and drizzling.

A BABY TAX WANTED.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, -
I wish that you would use your influence for the passing of an
Act of Parliament to make it penal for a baby to be nursed in any house
where its squalling may, through thin walls, be audible next door.
Builders are so chary of their bricks and mortar now-a-days, that a
squeal at Number Six is pretty sure to penetrate to numbers five and
seven; and the inmates of all three houses are worried and disturbed
when a child happens to live in the middle one.
Now, I am an old bachelor, and I like a quiet life, free from all
domestic troubles and annoyances. I have a special horror of
the sound of a child crying, yet somehow I seem never able to
escape from it. Having a small income, I am forced to live in
lodgings; and lodging-houses are all built with the thinnest of
thin walls, so that you are never free in them from the noises of
your neighbours. The piano plague is bad enough for quiet people
to be pestered by; but to me the baby º: is a far worse form
of torture. Pianos may be made to produce some pleasant sounds,
though I own the times are rare, at least in lodgings, that they do so.
But śi. emit always the most aggravating noises, and anything like
music from their lips seems quite impossible. Besides, pianos as a rule
are not played all night long; indeed, .# are heard seldom after three
o'clock A.M., even on quadrille nights, and quadrilles are rare in lodgings
—far rarer than are cradles. But when once they take to squalling,
babies never seem to stop, and having squealed all through the day, they
make night hideous with their howlings. Indeed, I have observed that
they often squall their loudest between two and four A.M., just when all
creation, except babies, is the stillest. - - - --
Now, I dare say there are hundreds of poor victims like myself who
are plagued with this annoyance, and I really think that something
should be done for our relief. I don’t suppose that any protest of the
Government, however urgently conveyed, would avail much ill.
ing babes from being born. . But at least they might be taxed, like other
luxuries of life, and a special fine, imposed when they are kept within
thin walls and so become a special nuisance. This is a free country, I
am willing to admit, and as every British subject, short of speaking
treason may use his voice much as he pleases, a baby, I allow, has a
right to squall and squeal here. But the parents of a baby surely have
no right to worry me with its propinquity, and suffer, it to squall so
that my peace of mind is troubled by it. . If Jones keeps a big dog,
that howls all through the night, his neighbours if they choose can
indict it as a nuisance. So if a baby in BRowN's nursery keeps howling
all night long, surely I who live next door, and am kept awake and
grumbling, should likewise have the right of indicting such a nuisance.
In the hope that you will help to amend the law in this respect, I
shall subscribe myself,
Yours gratefully,
CoELEBs CRUSTY.
P.S. Somebody calls a baby “an angel in the house.” But I am
not like MR. DISRAELI “on the side of the angels.”

THE NEW STOLBERG LOZENGE.
“A few days ago, says the Berlin Correspondent of the Times, Count Stol BERG,
a Major in the Prussian Life Guards, and Brother to the President of the Prussian
House of Lords, at the Palazzo Farmese, in solemn audience, presented to the King,
FRANCIs THE SEcond, a costly silver shield, the result of a subscription among his
political friends, an exquisite piece of embossed workmanship, representing the
ex-King in the act of slaying numerous revolutionary demons. The Count delivered
the following address on the occasion :-
“Sire, Four years ago your Majesty, and her Majesty the Queen, graciously
condescended to accept from the hands of PRINCE SAYN WittgenstEIN an address
bearing the signatures of some hundreds of German noblemen. In it we begged to
present to your Majesties the tribute of our profound respect, availing ourselves of
that opportunity to declare in the face of the world that, unless restrained by the |
allegiance we owe to our own Sovereigns, we should have all hastened hither, sword
in hand, to take in the defence of Gaëta, and to die on its walls for the principle
of Legitimacy. In the same address we rmission of your º: to
nt you a shield commemorating the defence of Gaëta. I have now been charged
y PRINCE SAYN WITTGENstriN, PRINCE FURSTENBERG, Count ERBAch, Count
LEININGEN, and Count Stolberg, who drew up that address, to place this shield at
the feet of your Majesty.”.
Of famed StolBERG's lozenge we’ve all of us heard,
And some may have swallowed the same ;
But let THE Stolberg lozenge henceforth be preferred
To a region of loftier fame.
'Twas Count STOLBERG, a Major of Prussia's Life Guard,
Who the shield to BoMBINo conveyed,
For which Prussia's bold junkers had clubbed, to reward
The pluck at Gaëta displayed.
The ground-work was silver, whereon was embossed
BoMBINo in act to destro
Revolution's fell demons, all abjectly tossed
At the feet of the bright Bourbon boy.
Why heed ribald scoffs by the Lib'rals outpoured,
hen they call this a pleasantry grim ;
Since, in fact, 'twas not FRANCIs the demons who floored,
But the demons who, somehow, floored him.
Since instead of a King's and a soldier's defence
BoMBALINo, Gaéta's siege through,
Lay perdu in a bomb-proof, in terror intense—
A case of the funk that’s called blue?
Pruss Junkerdom's right is to strain out the dregs
That make Truth's bitter waters so strong;
To lift fallen tyranny º on its legs,
And torture facts right when they’re wrong.
Brave Junkers! They seize on this chance to declare,
In the face of an awe-stricken world,
That but for an if—which had somehow got there—
At Gaëta their flag they’d unfurled.
But somehow they didn't—so words stand for blows,
And donors with donée are in cue:
For just such devotion as Junkerdom shows
To such heroes as FRANCIS is due.
Since Vor efſº. nihil's the yield
Of Junkerdom's loud loyal call,
When measured by deeds, e'en the great Stolberg shield

He is down, and for ever! The good fight is ended. As true to our welfare, he did his own mission -
In deep-dinted harness our Champion has died, When Progress *. him with Wisdom for guide;
But tears should be few in a sunset so splendid He cleared her a path, and with equal derision
And Grief hush her wail at the bidding of Pride. Bade quack and fanatic alike stand aside.
He falls, but unvanquished. He falls in his glory, The choice of his country, low faction despising,
A noble old King on the last of his fields:
And with death-song we come, like the Northmen of story,
And haughtily bear him away on our shields.
Nor yet are we mourners. Let proud words be spoken
By those who stand, pale, on the marge of his grave,
As we lay in the rest never more to be broken
The noble, the gentle, the wise, and the brave.
His courage undaunted, his purpose unaltered,
His long F. labour, his exquisite skill,
The tones of command from a tongue that ne'er faltered
When bidding the Nations to list to our will:
Let these be remembered; but higher and better
The tribute that tells how he dealt with his trust,
In curbing the tyrant, in breaking the fetter,
Lay the pleasure of him we commit to the dust.
But his heart was his England's, his idol her honour,
Her friend was his friend, and his foe was her foe,
Were her mandate despised, or a scowl cast upon her,
How stern his rebuke, or how vengeful his blow !
Her armies were sad, and her banners were tattered,
And lethargy wrought on her strength like a spell,
He came to the front, the enchantment was scattered—
The rest let a reconciled enemy tell.

He marched as a leader all true men could claim:
They came to their fellows, and held it sufficing
To give, as a creed, the great Minister's name.
So, Heir to traditions of Him, long departed,

We lay thee in earth, gallant-natured, true-hearted
Break, herald, thy wand, for his honours are told.
No, let Pride say her story and cease, for Affection
s near with a wealth of wild tears in her eyes,
And claims to be heard with more soft recollection
Of one who was ever as kindly as wise.
We trusted his wisdom, but love drew us nearer
Than homage we owed to his statesmanly art,
For never was statesman to Englishmen dearer
Than he who had faith in the great English heart.

With mirth, and the jests that so º; fell,.

I MAKE my last extract from the Log.
“Entered the Mersey this morning. Low water. Stuck on the bar.
Wind E. Latitude and longitude, vide map of England; place, Liver-
ool. The Treasure penitent but apologetic. Intend to send yacht
ack to Bangor, by Captain and Treasure. Commodore and Lieutenant
think that it hasn’t been such bad fun, after all: they say I can’t rough
it. ... I say I can. They ask me then will I go to Norway? I reply no,
decidedly. High Tide. We are off the bar, and are going into
L'pool. Just in. Log ends. Wind changed.”
. I had always thought that the arrival of a yacht was a picturesque
sight... I imagined, from, what I had gathered, that you pulled up
alongside of the Quay, where there were Officers and Yachtsmen to
meet you: that they cheered you all the way wherever you went,
crying Wave la République, or ...; else that came into their heads.
also had an idea, that, before landing, you sailed majestically into
Quarantine, and were saluted | a Flag-ship. But nothing of this sort
is done; at least at Liverpool. We . ’t get up to the kerb, I
mean the Quay; but had to go ashore in our small boat. , We paid off
the Captain and Crew, who neither cheered us, nor offered to carry our
luggage to the cab. It seems so absurd to talk of a cab, now, after
being a son of the Ocean for nearly three weeks. , Sailors always roll
about when they come on shore: so we all rolled about; at least I did.
The Commodore pretended that it made no difference to him. It did
to me; walking properly was reall difficult, and by the aid of a little
art, I made lots of people think I was a sailor. The Lieutenant sug.
gested enviously that they thought I was a fool. But this was only
said because he couldn't roll from one side to the other. When a salt
is on land he spends all his money: I did this with great facility,
º: with a warm bath, a basin of turtle at the Adelphi Hotel,
and a box of cigars at the first Tobacconist’s.
Tºnight I sleep in a comfortable bed; I write this from my room in
the Adelphi. O the luxury of sheets. The Commodore has just come
into my room to smoke a cigar with me before turning in. He still
talks about keeping watch, and one bell. He says he wishes that we
had had the Saucy Nautilus during the American war, we might have
been a blockade runner, and made our fortunes.
c-——
To this observation, which he made when I was in bed and had shut
up my diary, I replied that I shouldn't have run blockades, and I made
some joke about blockade, and blockhead, which this morning I can't
call to mind...I recollect his answering, that he was going to have
proposed another voyage, soon, for smuggling or whaling (or something
which he thought amusing) but that if Iturned everything into ridicule,
why of course he'd better give up the whole thing at once.,.
Ás I don’t remember anything of the Commodore after this, I fancy
I must have fallen off to sleep. -
º have both gone: and have left me to settle the hotel bill.
They’ll “make it all ºrght” (this in a letter), “when we meet in
town.” I am now off to town, to make it all right. Adieu.

An IRISH FINNY.UN CROSSING THE BROAD ATLANTIC,
BEEF AND BACON IN THE CITY.
DR.'LETHEBY, the Medical Officer to the City of London,
in the able report on the sanitary state of the Lord MAYok's
dominions for the last quarter, which he has just issued,
states some particulars respecting the cattle disease that
= | are rather reassuring. Having mentioned the appearance
of the disease in a certain, cow-house, where it killed two
cows, out of forty, of which the remainder were judi-
ciously killed to save their lives, as were also some other
cattle in five other cow-houses, and “forthwith disposed of
to the butcher before any serious symptoms had set in.”
DR. LETHEBy observes:-
"The loss, therefore, in the City dairies has not been great, for
only four cows have died, and three have recovered. I am notable
to explain why the disease has not manifested itself in the rest of the
City cow-houses, for the conditions appear tome to be the same in all.”
Those conditions were conditions of as much cleanliness
as it was possible to enforce; so that, as the cattle plague
s| made its appearance in only five cow-houses out of seventeen,
: health of cattle in the City of London appears to have been
s the rule and disease the exception. In all but four cases
s|the cowkeepers seem at least to have saved their beef;
which, under the circumstances was, so to speak, saving
their bacon.
As to those of whom the cows remained sound, their
Bacon, that is to say the Bacon, which they were supplied
with by DR. LETHEBY, the Baconian philosophy prac-
tically applied in experimental sanitary precaution,
appears to have saved them. There can be no reason why
cattle-owners in the country should not likewise be save
by their Bacon, and save their beef, except beef-headedness
and want of brains.
THE CHILD OF THE SUN.
The Star of Astley's is again in the ascendant. MR. John BROUGHAM
has given us one of his admirable dramas, remarkable for its stirring in-
cidents, meat construction, and the marvellous exhibition of vitality on
the part of MR. BASII, Pötter. This gentleman is shot by everybody
in every Act, and º: succumbs at last, out of politeness, to Miss
MENKEN. I’ll try and give you some idea of the piece as it appeared
on the first night of its production: it has since been altered. j
the Overture, which has been characteristically arranged for drums an
brass, Military gentlemen entered the stalls and winked at one another,
being evidently under the impression that they were going to see
something racy. The Curtain rises on—
A Prologue in Merico, and a Hacienda in Terra Calienta.
Peasants dance for some considerable time, and the Sun sets. More Pea-
sants dance. After which, enter a Mild Irishman and a Yankee.

the other before going off. Great applause. Music descriptive of
nothing in particular. Enter a # hobbling. Music finishes
toith a good bang on the drum

mumble. [Drum bangs, probably by mistake.
Enter an Old Merican Planter in a figured dressing-gown; he is accom-
modated with a chair in the centre of the stage. ENKEN, as LEON,
strikes an attitude to amuse him. The Monk continues mumbling.
Old Merican Planter (evincing a strong desire for “The Latest Intelli.

absence, LEoN strikes three or four more attitudes, while the Old Merican

habit, and the audience recognise MR. BASIL Potter, as a Brigand.)
Mr. Basil Potter (struck with a sudden idea). There is no one here:

Potter, who staggers off.
Leon (rushes on). The Papers! the Papers!

Leon (cutting out the Irishnan, who has got a speech ready, beginning
with “Bedadſ”). No! (Gives a new view of the case.) I am accursed"

End ºf Prologue.
ACT I.
Scene 1.-A Room in Merico. MR. Basil, Potter as a Brigand,
smoking with another Brigand.
Mr. Basil Potter. Can't make out who shot them all through the
head. Here’s the dumb slave, ZAMBA.
Enter MENKEN, as the Dumb Slave ZAMBA. Military gentlemen ºn Stalls
cheer up on seeing that the costume has been slightly modified, and
begin to think it’s going to be as good as Mazeppa.
Mr. Basil. How did you become dumbº

foot again, points with one finger to the right-hand corner, closes
Åer eyes, opens her eyes, points suddenly to the left-hand corner,
stamps twice, and bows to MR. Potter.
Mr. Basil Potter (erhibiting great sagacity). I understand you. You
must have loved deeply.

rently to some one in the Gallery, presses her heart, extends

QUESTIONABLE COMPANIONS.
Y ELL does the subjoined pas-
/ sage in a Times leader, on
the visit of Bismarck to
Biarritz, deserve the con-
( sideration of Napoleon The
Third, and, of every
- Sovereign and Statesman in
Sºs Europe who is also agentle-
man :-
“Count Bismanckhasset both
Legitimacy and Democracy
against him. He has plundered
a King and subjugated a people.
He went to war on the pretext
that the King of Denmark had
no title to the Duchies, and when
he had taken possession, he re-
fused to leave, on the ground that
the King of Denmark had been
the real Sovereign, and that his
cession had transferred them
without more ado to the con-
querors.”
Is it necessary to point
~\\ out to the EMPERoR of The
& French that he who plun-
ders a King is, equally
with the plunderer of a
>+ . subject or a citizen, a thief,
- and that the man who first
N ſ _A^ says one thing and then the
reverse, not only is, but pro-
- º --
º \ \ claims himself to be, a deli-
S. Stº Yºs berate liar?
- - If the Timesis mistaken as
to the acts and assertion imputed in the words above quoted to
Bismarck, then, there is no known reason why a gentleman, on a
throne or any inferior seat, or any other footing than that of
sovereignty, should object to take him by the hand. If the Times is
right, the tongs are an instrument with which it would be more than
the utmost that any gentleman could becomingly do to touch him.
What is true of the man is as true of the master. If the tongue of
BISMARCK is not foul with falsehood, if his hands are not dirty with theft
and red with murder, so are not those of the KING or PRussia. If the
converse is true as regards the Minister, so likewise it is as regards
the Monarch; and in that case whosoever shakes hands with either
might as well shake hands with the greatest villain unhanged of all the
villains who deserve the gallows. If–only if; mark that, your Imperial
Majesty, and, any other Majesty whom it may concern—if the
mendacity and theft and murder committed in the invasion of Denmark
on a confessedly false pretence are really chargeable on Count Bismarck
and KING WILLIAM, defilement is incurred by eventheslightest contact
with either of those two masses of moral pitch; and the fact that
Europe has not demanded of all their connections and acquaintance to
cut them dead, indicates a sadly low state of European morality.
A Sensible Complaint.
Accounts from Paris, among last week's news, inform us that “the
Cholera is sensibly on the decline.” We rejoice to hear that the
and has never been seen before at any stage ºf the Drama.
Cholera is taking a course that shows so very much sense.

Diplomatists do not use diplomatic language to their friends. At

The Scotch use the word “whenever” in an odd way. A Scottish
young lady will tell you that whenever she came into the room she had
a glass of wine. You have seen her enter a dozen times, and you
secretly rejoice that {. are not engaged to a person of such propen-

the word in the same un-English way in his noble diary.

No, there are advantages and disadvantages in being a member of a
large family. If you are poor it is, of course, decidedly advantageous,
as you have so many relatives to sponge upon. If rich, it is pleasant,
as you can do so many kind things. But if only moderately well off, it
is a heavy affliction, sent to punish you for being sinfully good-natured.

I wish I had known DR. BULL. When the Bill for securing the
Church of England was read, in 1706, there was a clause in it for
abolishing the Test. Eleven Bishops agreed, six dissented. DR. Bull
sat in the lobby of the House of Lords all through the debate, smoking
his pipe.
29.
ERNst was a kind man—one of the best men who ever sawed the
inside of a cat with the tail of a horse. I know that when a concert
was arranged for the benefit of the family of a literary friend of mine,
ERNst instantly offered to play, but he did a great deal more. He
composed something, of a very touching character, for the occasion,
and he thought so little of the act that he volunteered to perform the
piece at the very beginning of the concert, when half the people had not
come in, and there was the usual disturbance by the fools who can't be
punctual. He was a good man. I am very sorry he is gone.
30.
Lady Macbeth's name was Gruoch. Malcolm was called Caen-more,
from his very Large Head. Managers should remember this when
reviving the play, as we should always pay attention to historical
ºn. MR. DYKwyNKYN is charged with the execution of this
ecree.
31.
I hope that at public dinners they will always distribute books of the
songs. Usually there is one true poem among them. To withdraw
oneself, for three minutes, from the heat, the jabber, the bad wine, and
the worse speeches, into the pure air of poetry, is a comfort, and for those
minutes you forget what a thundering º you were to come that
day, and what a thundering headache you will have the next.
32.
Beware of the man who thinks it witty to talk of “putting in an
appearance.” That is, trust the honest fellow with your money, your
child's happiness, or even your favourite meerschaum, but don't sit next
him at dinner. 33
The increase of drunkenness in Glasgow is easily accounted for. It
is due to the exquisite water from Loch, Katrine, which is laid on to
the top of every house in the city. It is perfectly impossible to help
making grog with it. We have nothing like it in London, more shame
to us vauntful Cockneys. 34
I read that a Clergyman won a good deal of money on the Cesare.

ganda Fide—says the Post's Roman correspondent–
“The Prince showed his gratitude to the Jesuit Confessor, who had for some time been his
spiritual director, by bequeathing him a rare and curious collection of snuffs, which he had
amassed during his long career of snuff-taking.”
What a very odd remuneration for spiritual services, at first thought, appears the
bequest of a variety of snuffs | Bolongaro, Brown Rappee, Etrenne, one woul
think, must appear to the Father Confessor of the late PRINCE of Roviano to
constitute a strange legacy, considered as intended to be a return for absolution.
Among the different sorts of snuff which the Prince left to the Jesuit, in acknow-
ledgment of attentions to the health of his soul, we may suppose that there was
some Prince's Mixture of his own composing, and, of course, some Pope's
Mixture also, if his Holiness is accustomed to take snuff. But doubtless, as the
Holy Father has, by implication at least, condemned the Fenians, the snuffs, in
question did not include any “Lundy Foot,” otherwise called “Irish Blackguard.”
When, however, we come to reflect seriously on this sternutatory bequest, we
perceive that there are two lights wherein it may be regarded as appropriate.
The Dublin Review, on the one hand, will perhaps suggest that a material legacy
of snuff was a natural and graceful expression of gratitude for having been “put
up to snuff” in spiritual matters. The Record, on the other, will as probabl
asseyerate that a pºsthumous present of snuff was a suitable and significant inti-
mation of a sense of thankfulness for having been during life led by the nose.

A DUPPELL-TONGUED WERDICT.
(See the Prussian Crown Lawyers' opinions on the rights in
the case of Schleswig and Holstein, Plaintiffs, v. KING
WILLIAM and KAISER FRANcis-Joseph, Defendants.)
TheRE once was a King and a Kaiser
Who, as they grew older, grew wiser;
or, instead of disputing,
Ånd sab’ring, and shooting
To decide which was “my” and which “ thy,” Sir,
Like waxed sole and waxed upper leather,
They determined to stick close together,
And, strong in alliance,
To bid Law defiance,
And put Right and Truth in a tether.
Says the King, I have plenty of glory:”
Says the Kaiser, "Our name shines in story;
But, though Fame’s our debtor,
We’d both be much better
For a nice slice of new territory.”
Says the KING, “There is Schleswig for me, Sir,
And there’s Holstein will just do for thee, Sir;
And we’ll preach them a sermon,
And prove, in High German,
How much better off they will be, Sir.
“'Tis true there are old rights and treaties;
But for Duke or for King who well beat is,
To appeal to a note,
Or a protocol quote,
Is, to main force, much what chaff to wheat is.
“The Rights that the Duke sets his seals to,
And the Treaties KING CHRISTIAN appeals to,
Can't both be correct—
In fact, I *:::
Each the other a knock-down blow deals to.
“So, first for the Duke's rights we’ll clamour,
And vote ChrisTIAN's as dead as a hammer;
And when both are put down,
Law will bend to the Crown
As to Kaisers of old time bent Grammar.”
So they came, saw, and conquered at Duppell,
This law-loving, God-fearing couple,
Killed ChristiAN's men
Took his Duchies, and then,
Sat down in them, smooth-faced and supple.
The Duchies called out for their Duke back,
But the King with a shrug and a crook-back,
To the law said he'd bow,
Though he didn’t know how
It was quite, but the lawyers should look back.
Then the Crown Lawyers lighted their tapers,
Put their spectacles on, and read papers.
But they raised such a dust,
To decide what was just, .
That poor Justice was choked with the vapours.
And thus in the end they awarded :
The Duke's rights, must as null be regarded,
Since those rights one and all
To KING CHRISTIAN did fall,
Ere at Duppell his lines were bombarded.
“And thus,” quoth the King to the Kaiser,
“”Tis well al Law than reason is wiser,
But Justice beside -
You see Law can o'erride, -
And make the Truth more false than lies are l"
GoGses. The following statement concerning him is made by a contemporary:-
“The new giant is reported to exceed eight feet in height, and to be capable of looking down
upon the head of CHANo. He is also said to have the singularity of possessing one rib more
than the rest of the human race.”
* See the old story of the old Kaiser who, when remonstrated with
about the grammar of some writ or order, replicd, “Ego sum Impera-
tor Romanus, et sum super Grammaticam."

An amusing result of earnest and undivided attention to business is
thus related by the Scotsman :-
"Drºstauction or Fish–The banks near Musselburgh were on Friday strewn
with dead trouts, eels, flounders, &c.; in short, life seems to have been extin-
º in everything of the fish kind. This wholesale destruction is supposed to
ave arisen from the accumulation of deleterious matter at the manufactories after
the long drought.”
What of that?. What signifies the destruction of fish º the refuse
of manufactories? So much money gained for every fish killed, to an
amount, much exceeding the value of the fish. Perish all the fish, then,
in all the rivers of the United Kingdom, if necessary for the progress
of manufactures! Let us have no sentimental whining about the
destruction of the angler's gentle craft. Perish the angler, too, and
likewise his gentles. Let not that profit for whose sake manufacturers
turn a little filth into our rivers be called filthy lucre; and above all let
no law be made that would impose any expense upon them by compelling
them to dispose of their filth elsewhere.
The Pew and the Dormitory.
THE Rev. DR, WAUGHAN, Vicar of Doncaster, in a pamphlet just
ublished on Free and Open Worship in Parish Churches, remarks that
a national Church is apt to grow drowsy.” and that “a deep sleep
did once fall upon the pastors of England.” That state of things has
happily passed away. It is now only parish and other local churches
that are sometimes apt to get drowsy, and the pastors of England are
i. pretty wide awake, though here and there, during the sermon,
eep sleep does occasionally fall upon too many members of the
congregation.

A COMMERCIAL CONWERSATION.
As Brown the other day, was reading an “investment circular,”
which the post had brought him, among other curiosities of commercial
nomenclature, his eye fell on the following:—
“The Patent Atmospheric Marine Salvage Company Limited."
“Patent Atmospheric Salvagel Why, what on earth is meant by
that?” said he, in sheer bewilderment. “Oh, don't you see?” re-
sponded Jones, “It’s some patent dodge for bottling the sea breezes
down at Brighton, and so saving them for fellows to take home to their
families, who are thereby spared the bother of having to leave home.”
“Or, more likely,” remarked Robinson, “it’s a Company for catch-
ing the wind wasted in a storm, and saying up the º us atmosphere
for the use of ships becalmed, and that 's why it is called the Atmo-
spheric Salvage Company.” -
“O, thank you,” replied BRowN., “So I suppose then this new
Company is meant to raise the wind when wanted. Well, with money
at eight per cent., that will certainly be found a serviceable patent.”

of being what Mercutio said that he should be

Lancashire is a Grave Man. It appears to be thought that he is not lively enough to conduct
the business of Parliament. He is called Saturnine. - --
Certainly a cheerful disposition is to be encouraged. But whether a person is likely, to be:

a boy for not looking happy, but Mr. Squeers was not a teacher whose success greatly
recommends, his system. We really think that no great good will be done by incessantly
writing at M.R. GLAnstone, calling him Solersides, Dismal William, and Peter Grievous. That
is not the way to make him smile as he is wanted to smile.
Fully aware of the importance of having a Merry Minister, and duly, persuaded of the
wisdom of ºf the Opposition instead of convincing the public, Mr. Punch is inclined to
propose to take MR. Gladstone in hand, and qualify him for the Leadership of the House.
And he hereby invites the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer to place himself with Mr. Punch
as a pupil. He shall be treated as one of the family, he ºl be allowed the reasonable
use of Latin and Greek, and on half-holidays he shall, if he likes, do sums. But if he comes,
he must devote himself º to the Art of Seeing Fun in Everything. -
Why MR. GLADstone should be Saturnine, and how he misses seeing fun in most thigs
which occur in the House of Commons, Mr. Punch is unable to comprehend. Is it not fun
to hear Mr. DisRAELI take the Church under his angel wing f Is it not fun to hear SIR
FitzRoy KELLY in an agony over the wrongs of some Qriental heathen whose name he never
heard until he got his brief? Is it not fun to hear SIR CHARLEs Wood, alternately tumbling
out and tumbling over the figures of Indian taxation? Is it not fun to hear MR HENLEY

MR. GLADstone can keep his countenance for
ten minutes, together, knowing, as he does,
how much high comedy there is in all the Par-
liamentary “situations.”
But, since he insists on finding sermons in
stones when he should be merely shying the
stones at other people, let him come to us,
and we will cure him of the only disqualifica-
tion which his enemies seem able to assign.
We will teach him Levity. In six months
his best enemies 'shall not know him. Instead

º: he shall ask the inquirer whether he
will have the reply now or wait, till he gets it.
When he “introduces” a Bill he shall say,
“Mr. Bill, MR, SPEAKER; MR. SPEAKER, Mr.
Bill.” When he presents a petition he shall
wink at the House. When he alludes to
CoLonel North he shall call him the gallant
and disagreeable officer, and MR. HoRsMAN he
shall call the learned and antibilious Member.
When he seconds a motion he shall say, “Ditto
here.” When he fixes a debate on the cattle
disease he shall appoint it for Wednesday next,
please the pigs. When he is asked his in-
tention about Reform, he shall state that it is
certainly his intention to reform his tailor's bill.
When he moves the House into Committee, he
shall tell the SPEAKER that a glass of claret and
a weed seem the thing for his complaint just
then. When he moves a vote of condolence,
he shall talk of the tear that is wiped with a little
Address. When he speaks on a police-bill he
shall begin, From information which I received,
and when he takes the Commons to a confer-

all are—pray keep your hatson.”
MR. GLAidstone will then be qualified to
lead the House of Commons, and it is delight-
ful to think that nothing, more is required to
complete this distinguished statesman's reputa-
tion than the faculty of being able to laugh
over what most people think serious business.

EDITING EDITORS.
The Naples editors are so awfully full of
Honour that they have been quarrelling and
running one another through three times a week.
So, by way of self-preservation, they have insti-

squabbles are now adjusted before this tribunal.
If one “We’” have intimated our belief that
our contemporary is an idiot and a traitor, and
the other “We’” have rejoined that our assail-
ant is an ass and a scoundrel, the Jury of
Honour balances the epithets, and decides that
neither “We” has a right to call out his an-
tagonist. The American press have gone, a
straighter way to work, and everybody calls
everybody everything, and nobody fights, be-

SOCIAL SCIENCE.
N its active encouragement
of Social Science Congresses
the busy Provincial Town
of Wiggleswade yields to
no other in England. The
Westry, with a liberality un-
known even to the august
metropolitan synods of St.
Mary-le-bone and St. Pan-
cras, have, this year, invited
professors from all parts of
the globe, eminent for their
social †: to a free and
frank discussion of certain
questions, that *. per-
W. mankind, whether at
Wiggleswade or elsewhere,
in the Fº of civilisa-
tion, and in the rapid growth
of all branches of learning.
That the Wiggleswade
Universal Social Science
Congress was only attended
by the members of the
parish vestry and one or
two neighbouring parochial
authorities is no fault of the
º who had pre-
pared letters for Russia,
Mongolia, the Tyrolean
Islands (there was some
- --- - - dispute as to the geogra-
phical position of this 'group), the Archimandrites of the Peloponnesus (supposed to be
rather good fellows), the Pacha of Persia (there was a divided opinion on the orthography
of this title, some voting for Shaw, or Porshaw, others for Parshar, while a few simply
said P'shaw!) and other lands, parishes, or magnates. Somebody said that a notice ought
to be sent to The Pariah of Society, but no one was quite certain as to, the residence of
this dignitary. No communication was made to the Grand Llama of Thibet, as some said
“there was no such person,” others, thought “he was hyperbolical,” while the Chairman,
who was º to have a knowledge of Continental matters, said that he was almost
certain the Llama was a goat; but, at all events, winter cloaks were made out of his
wool, so that he wasn't very likely to be an Asiatic Parochial Authority. This decision
* º and the letter to the Grand Llama, beginning “Honoured Sir,” was put into
e ure.
. At this meeting M.R., Roger GREENE (of the well-known firm of GREENE, FIELD, & Co.,
Pickle Merchants, of Wiggleswade, and inventors of the Wiggleswade Walnut Sauce) pro-
posed that a vote of thanks should be presented to the EMPEROR Louis NApoleon. He
said, “he didn't mean a vote of thanks, he meant more of a Round Robin sort of thing,
acknowledging his kindness, and hoping that he’d give a helping, hand to the Congress
assembled at Wiggleswade. The EMPERoR,” MR. GREENE added, “was an eminently
º party. He worn’t above receiving addresses, nor speaking to any one as spoke to
lin.
t MR. fºund, the clerk, asked who was to draw it up? and if it was to be in the French
ongue
To which a Member of the Westry said, “Wee, of course, tree, certainmong,” and was
immediately fixed upon as a ſit and proper person to represent the Wiggleswade sentiments
to the French Emperor.
This led to an animated discussion that promised to end in a combat of two of more, but for
the timely arrival of MR. GREENE, JUN, with a French dictionary. Order having been
restored, the form of address was then calmly considered.
MR, ANThony NAYLoR (the Westryman who had said wee) proposed the following
commencement :-" May it please your Imperial \º ”—
MR. GREENE interposed. “That ought to be in French.” -
The Clerk, who was taking notes, asked what “may it please” was in French F
A Westryman said, “Sivoo play,” of course.
MR. GREENE observed that that was “If you please.” -
A Westryman was heard to mutter something about “conceited ass.”
MR. GREENE wished the last words to be taken down. -
After some discussion and a reference to the º dictionary, “Sivoo play” was
allowed in default of finding anything better or more familiar to everybody. - -
MR. NAYLOR continued. “May it please, or rather, S'il vous plaſt vötre Impérial Majesty,
vöre-your humble servants—votre umble serviteurs—”
MR. GREENE said “humble servant” might finish but couldn't begin a letter. (Hear,
hear, from several members.)
The Clerk said yes, he agreed with the last speaker. (Hear, hear, from a Mestryman.)
After a warm contest, it was carried by a majority of everybody against MR. NAYLOR, that
the address should be in English, with “S'il vous plait” at the top, just to show they could
have written it in French iſ they had liked. MR. NAYLoR left the room, vowing that he'd
write himself to the Emperor and denounce them all as humbugs.
Agreed: that they didn’t care for NAYLOR; that they’d send an address in English to
Louis NApoleon. The Congress to be fixed for that day two months.
The day, came at last, and a great time Wiggleswade had of it. Two Bands of Local
Volunteer Regiments paraded the streets alternately, playing all their liveliest airs. As both
---- --- -
parties had, however, hit upon the same tunes, a
want of variety was noticeable in this feature of
the day's entertainment. Several excited little
boys who, in consequence of the unusual stir, had
mistaken the season, brought out Guy Fawkeses
and paraded the streets with every demonstration
of loyal but mistaken enthusiasm.
The magistrates sat º: the day at the
Town Hall, but no rioting took place until they
were gone; however, several ruffians of various
ages irom four to twelve were brought up before
their worships, and on being searched, crackers
were found concealed about their persons.
The Congress opened with a speech from the
Chairman, #. GREENE.. He deplored the ab-
sence of Continental friends, and contemned the
envy of Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham.
MR. Fuddell from Snaggs Cray would read a
*:: - -
, FUDDELL, interrupting, said he wouldn't
do anything of the sort.
The Chairman said it was too bad of MR.
FUDDELL, as he’d promised him that he would
make a speech.
MR. #. replied that that was quite an-
other thing. He would draw their attention to a
social subject of much importance. He had a
few words to say
On being asked to sing after Dinner.
Singing was, considered social, or sociable."
The question before them was, Does singing
especially comic singing, promote hiſariº
He knew several comic songs, each ending with
his (the comic singer's) Tooral-looral, or his
Rummy-tum-tum, and when he sang them, being
pressed thereto, and unable to refuse, he felt
that he was degrading himself. He would give
them a specimen. (“No, no,”) Yes he would.
º No, no, no.”) Very well, then, he wouldn't.
Hear, hear, and cheering.). He knew a melan-
choly instance of a respectable man, who having
unfortunately established a reputation for comic
singing on the strength of one son; with imita-
tions of a countryman “spoken” between the
verses, had been obliged to “favour the com-
pany,” week after week during the cricketin
season, and year after year, with this same ballad.
People who had heard it over and over again,
always affected to see new points in it, and in-
variably knocked, their glasses, or rapped their
fingers on the table by way of applauding it.
At one period of his life, this unhappy creature
would appeal to the company round the table,
and reminded them that “they must know it
by heart by this time,” or that “he’d almost
forgotten it,” or that “he wasn't...in cue for
singing,” or any other means of getting excused
from the task. But there was ſº present
“some one who hadn't heard it before,” or
else the united opinion was, that “it was such
a capital song, they could never be tired of
hearing it,” when, in truth, the social humbugs
only meant that they were glad to be saved
the trouble of conversation for a few minutes
while they smoked their pipes, in peace, and
winked sli | at one another, grimly smiling at the
singing of their deluded victim. Lobsters sing, it is
said, when being boiled; but your Social Lobster
sings while being roasted by his companions.
(Hear, hear, and sobs from the audience, who were
much affected by this touching picture.) He would
call upon them all for a-he meant he would call
upon them all to discountenance the 9dious prac-
tice of galvanising dull conviviality. (Hear, hear,
hear, and glasses round ordered for everyone at the
expense of the speaker.) -
A paper was then read by Major SUBBs, retired
Mounted (Bombay) Marines,
On Questions ºf Health.
The first question the learned Major contended
was, “How are you?” or “How do you do?”
No completely satisfactory answer had ever been
given to these interrogatories. The formu

for granted, left much to be desired. The superficial had attempted to
throw ridicule on all sanatory, questions by saying, “How are you
yesterday? How was you to-day? and How ain't you to-morrow?”
(Hear, hear, and a sob.) He would now come to the subject of healths
in general. There were several kinds of health. Your good health, my
good health, his good health, or simply º my, his health. Another
sort was that plentiful health, on which doctors had hitherto been
silent, he alluded to “Here's your good health and plenty ºf 'em.”
(Cheers.) He would not detain them any longer, but would sing,
“Here's a health to all good lasses.” (Nameſ name!) . The gallant
and learned gentleman resumed his seat, amidst much cheering, and
a fresh supply of whiskey punch was brought in.
After a few speeches, some more whiskey punch, and a profound
silence, an energetic Member of the Town Council rose. He said that
“he must 'polgish for rishin' after ev'one spokesh. (Here he boºed
gracefully over the table, and recovered himself with some difficulty.) He

across the table, and every one eyed him contentedly, and gave no
signs of moving: he was allowed to remain there.
A proposal was then made by the Chairman that this meeting do
adjourn, and every one who was able to leave his chair, seized the
opportunity.

ord Russel.L. is pit-
eously entreated by
MR, BRIGHT's organ
to invent a new Re-
form Bill. His Lordship
is reminded that on a
certain 11th of April
he cried because he had
to abandon a Bill of his
own. He is told there
were doubts as to the
character of this hy-
draulic demonstration,
but that most persons
believed it to be sin-
cere. The Star implies
that we shall now know
whether it was sincere
or not. If LoRD RUS-
sell makes a new Bill,
he was in earnest when
he wept. If he does
not, he was merely act-
ing. With a passing
compliment to the
gentlemanly grace of
such a reference, Mr.
Punch would observe
that he fails to see the
logic of the Fº
inference. dozen
years makes much dif-
erence in Our Sensa-
tions. At four, we cry,
very sincerely, for the
moon. At sixteen,
we scorn the moon, but, cry sincerely (but privately) because
cousin Loo prefers cousin EDMIND. At twenty-eight, we cry (very
º or only after much Champagne) because Rigdumſunnidos
as lost the Derby, and all our bets. Thenceforth we don't cry
at all until our favourite daughter bolts with poor BRown instead
of rich Jones, and these are very sincere tears. Poor BRown has
brains, and becomes a well-to-do Vicar, and we again begin crying
sincerely when he turns Dissenter. Finally, we cry over nothing less
important than the new actress's sobs in Mrs. Haller. We have been
in thorough earnest at each outbreak, but each has its proper date, and
we are not to be told that we are actors, because having cried over
Cousin Loo at sixteen, we don't care, twopence for Cousin Loo at
twenty-eight. The Star's logic is of a piece with DR. Johnson's :—
“If the man who turnips cries,
Cries not when his father dies,
"Tis a proof that he had rather
Have a turnip than his father.”
LoRD RUssell was very sorry to abandon that Bill. He is now
twelve years older, and may have other objects at heart. At all events
we protest against the Water-test.
A Rule for Railway Travelling.
“WILL you allow me, Sir, to offer you a cigar?”. “Thank you, but
I never smoke.” “Have you any objection to my lighting one, Sir h"
"Oh! no, none in the, least.” This plan is infallible with the most
Puritanical-looking, fellow traveller. Never think of putting the
second question first. The production of the cigar, and the generous
offer, are sure to disarm all crusty objections. Try it.
THE LAUREATE TO HIS PRINCESS,
(of BONNY.)
O Royal Maiden, to declare
Thy graces in one word 'tis hard;
To call thee, sable Princess, fair,
Were worthy of an Irish bard.
Yet Bonny's darkness is more bright
Than many a bonny English rose:
Thou wouldst not, wert thou e'er so white,
Appear more fair to Poet Close.
Why hast thou sought old England's shore?
To fill the coffers of thy mind
With wealth of scientific lore,
And literary gold, combined,
With poesy, among the rest;
What wilt thou find, of all that flows
From any British pen, the best?
The verse on sale by Poet Close.
True, TENNyson’s a decent hand,
And Robert BRowNING too, no doubt,
As far as those can understand
Who cannot always make him out.
One Laureate England may admire;
Another all the wide world knows:
The Poet Laureate to thy Sire
The KING OF BONNY, Poet CLOSE.
And could he know that thou hadst come,
And not a tuneful welcome sing f
Ah no, unless entirely dumb, , ...
Child of his patron, BONNY’s King;
This votive offering at thy feet,
With hat in hand, he humbly throws;
O may it approbation meet,
And win reward for Poet CLOSE!
A Bishop's money is a sight
Which many sigh in vain to see.
I’ve had that vision of delight,
Too rarely though, vouchsafed to me.
To Bishop PERcy, of Carlisle,
A Bard this recognition owes;
He once laid down, in handsome style,
A sovereign for the Poet Close.
The second Person in the Realm,
His Grace, of Canterbury's See,
Who guides the Church of England's helm,
Has purchased many books of me.
He pays me for them like a man,
Down on the nail he pays me—those
Will find that still the wisest plan,
Who order books of Poet Close.
Yes, the Archbishop, like a man,
A gentleman, good man and true,
Pays me, and so a lady can
Accept my books, and pay me too.
I’ll trumpet Beauty’s noble Queen,
Largess on genius who bestows.
I call her ugly, base, and mean
Who buys no songs of Poet bloss.

OCTOBER 27, 1865.
THE fitful sunlight of October flames
Through stained and storied glass, athwart the gloom,
Fretting the walls—one bead-roll of great names,
Dyeing the pavement—one illustrious tomb.
From the South º I and those beside,
Look down, across the monuments of Kings,
To the North transept, where a grave yawns wide—
Garner of this ripe sheaf, which England brings,
Sadly yet proudly, here to lay it down,
Where a great man should rest, among his peers;
That so the honours of the grave may crown
A life, as full of honours as of years.
In this assemblage, grouped in reverence round,
How many faces to all England known-
Lawgivers, judges, orators renowned,
The trusty pillars of the State and Throne!
Hearing or holding talk, one topic still
Is on all tongues—the man that we have lost;
How swift in work, how strong, not stern, of will,
How his green heart seemed proof 'gainst age's frost,
And that more deadly blight, which the world's use
And office's experience oftenest bring,
Killing love, e'en in hearts of love profuse,
And freezing hope and faith, down at their spring.
So they speak—those who guide our land to-day,
The shapers of our English life and law:
Men who the counsels of the nation sway,
And make the tides that its opinion draw.
And he, whose coffin up the Abbey nave
Is borne with choral swell and organ roar,
To rest between the altar and the grave,
And then to be slung down, and seen no more,
But now was busiest of this busy throng,
*Mong all these notables the first of note;
The wakefullest, though the debate were long,
The cheeriest, though adverse were the vote.
'Tis hard, e'en now, to feel that he is dead,
Who seemed but yesterday as full of life
As any here of those he fought or led,
By friend and foe alike cheered through the striſe.
I look across to where he will be laid,
And there a silent company I see,_
White faces, marble forms, of those that made
The history that never more can be.
CHATHAM and MANSFIELD, Fox, PITT, CASTLEREAgh,
HoRNER and GRATTAN, WILBERFORCE and PEEL:
And, last precursor on the common way,
Lewis, whose loss scarce less than this we feel.
They seem to look out of the deep'ning gloom,
And bid him voiceless welcome to their throng—
“Come to us. . . us, the conclave of the tomb,
And take the place reserved for thee so long.”
Verbal Twisting and Spinning.
WHAT is the difference between a “cotton-gin” and a glass of “gin;
twist?” And if the landlord of a gin-palace is called a “gin-spinner.”
is the landlady a “spinning-Jenny ?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
punth's Cable-Calli.
36.
It is made matter of reproach to MR. GLADSTONE that he is habi-
tually grave—that he actually sees no fun, in the affairs, of a nation.
He is certainly the most plaintive person I know. He is always Taxing
us with unkindness.
37.
The life of a woman named SURATT, recently executed in America, is
announced, . It is being written by her counsel on the trial. This is
certainly doing, one’s best for one’s client—supposing the learned
counsel can write decently. But imagine a London publisher adver-
tising that he had made arrangements with SERJEANT BALLANTINE,
MR. ORRIDGE, or MR. SLEIGH, for a life of a person who died on
Monday morning at the Old Bailey.
38.
T PRESIDENT Johnson is pardoning all the Southrons...This is wise, but
it is also artful. A singular º has presented itself to him. Choo
and LIN, the Siamese Twins, took different sides in the war., LIN was
loyal, but Choo was frantic for the “chivalry.” It would have been
extremely awkward to hang the guilty Choo, while attached to the
innocent LIN, so, as the PRESIDENT could not cut the band, he has
cut the knot. Pardon's the word for all.
39.
Gounod's new oratorio, Tobias, is founded on the history of my Toby,
I hope that the composer can rise to such a subject. He shirked
Mephistopheles as the hound.
40.
DR, MANNING fulfils his promise of action for the Church of Rome.
The PoPE is going to create another Archbishopric in England—in
Liverpool, probably, Really we ought to make reprisals. Why not
consecrate one of the curates of St. Pancras the Protestant bishop of
San Pancrazio”
41.
One does not expect to hear slang from princes. Yet MILTON makes
the courtly Belial reply, “Sud Cure!’
42.
CANNING's sayings are coming up again now-do 39. know what he
said about the phrase, “Measures, not men P” “Cant! Is it the
harness that draws the coach, or the horses?” Clever; and yet the
thought savoured of the Official.
43.
I have met, in my life, two cases of real humility. One was a
Scotch coachman, on a very dangerous road. We escaped safely; but
he turned round to a clergyman next to me, and said that if we had not
turned that last corner, “we would all have been wi' the Deil in five
minutes.” 44
The other was a §." woman who, in reply to my inquiries after her
boy, said, “O Sir, fortune's made l—he has passed for the Idiot
Asylum.” 45
U.
I suppose that the nonsense about French women dressing better
than English women is nearly exploded. Our women who give what
they are pleased to call their minds to dress, beat the French ladies
hollow in taste and in expense, and ours having also real, faces and real
º, the contest is as unfair as was Gladiateur's for the Cambridge-
SIllre,
46.
By the way, I suppose the French will say that the aforesaid horse
was deliberately crushed—a victim to English hate—that he was a sort
of four-legged NAPOLEON. It may be mentioned that the British people
adore him, and that he started favourite.
47.
T 1 see an advertisement in which, a fiend, states that, º, been
experimenting, for years, he can produce a fair Port and Sherry, by fer-
mentation, without a drop of grape-juice, and wishes a party with money
to join him in #.; I rather take this to be a squib inserted by
some, London wine-merchant to damage the fame of the Hamburg wines.
I will try to believe this, for the honour of human nature.
48.
. Something has been said about there being no statue of Lord ByRon
in the Abbey. If Westminster Abbey is declared to be our Valhalla,
he ought to have a splendid monument there. But while we keep the
place as a Church, with Ten. Commandments stuck up in it, I do not
see the exact fitness of doing, glorification therein to a man whose
whole life and writings evinced his belief that we ought to have neither
churches nor commandments. I presume that you know better than to
answer me with a few sentimental quotations from his poems. He was
too true an artist not to produce an effect, when he wanted one. Let
us have no cant.
49.
Why do we say a medical man, and not a clerical man, or a legal
man? Or why not adopt the last two phrases for parson and lawyer?
50.
The fishermen in Banffshire have a curious etiquette in reference to a
couple of words. You must never speak of one of their number as
having been drowned. They say, “Dogs are drowned—men are lost.”
51.
. Without being quite of the opinion of Mrs. Parson Adams, who con-
sidered that “Scriptures out of church are blasphemies,” I don't care
to hear texts quoted as arguments. An old divine—Donne, I think—
says that, together they are beautiful, like hairs in a horse's tail, but,
separated, the hairs are only springes and snares.
52.
Was SIR BULWER Lytton thinking of the rickety timbers of the
smart edifices built to catch young couples, when he wrote
“No beam spoke trouble in the House of Love?”
5.
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. And more than sufficient
for the night after—unless you like lying awake.
54.
Musical composers generally, regard words as a necessary nuisance,
but naturally prefer rubbish, because it does not intrude a poet's
thoughts upon a musician's audience. I knew one composer, however
who was fastidious, and could never be satisfied with the words supplied
to him. At last, he declared that he would write a poem for himself,
and did. He considered it nearly perfect. This was the first verse :-
“'Tis sad to see the Autumn leaves
Come falling off a tree,
But sadder far to see my friends
All falling off of me.”
5.
The Zoological Gardens, on a fine Sunday in the season, with all my
distinguished and lovely acquaintances j around, is a noble sight.
But give me back the sensation I experienced, when going to be taken
into Exeter Change, at the sight of the picture of the animals, at the
beefeater with the bills, and at the tip of the elephant's trunk poked
out at the little window into the Strand. To be sure, I was younger
then, and had not seen so many Beasts.
56.
MR. DisrAELI, speaking of SIR Robert PEEL, said, in the House,
“He traces steam-engines to tea-kettles. His precedents are tea-kettle
precedents.” PEEL boiled over, but his retort was not happy.
57
Why should MoRRIson, PARR, and Holloway have the game all
their own way? If you will ſº me some money—a good deal—I will
give you a name for a Pill, which properly puffed, shall make a
millionnaire of you. . It will meet a want, of every one, and no one will
be able to detect its failure. It need not be injurious, but the materials
of such things are of no consequence, if they sell. This will. Take
your time, and make me an offer. I am serious. Write, if you prefer it.
58.
Bother about there having been two Greek tragic poets called
PHRYNichUs. Stuff, I tell you. Every schoolboy knows that PHRY-
Nich Us is mentioned by HERodotus, CALLISTHENES, STRABO, PLU:
TARch, AELIAN, and LIBANIUS, besides half-a-dozen other writers, and
they speak of his play, which was called the Taking of Miletus, as by
PHRYNichus the Tragedian. They say nothing about “the younger.”
He was a pupil of THESPIs. I am ashamed of such juvenile erudition,
but you talk nonsense. Pass the bottle.
59.
I am for great moderation in regard to capital punishment, but a so-
called friend who posts to you a newspaper, and does not mark some
paragraph for you to look at, ought simply to be hanged.
60.
Isn't Nu the shortest name a racehorse has had I do not know
whether it means the Greek n, or the French naked. What's more, I
don't care. Oy would be a good name for a horse, only there would be
a hint of his roaring like a bull of that king's dominions. The Hebrew
alphabet has not been exhausted. I should like to try the betting men
with Lamed, Schin, and Tzaddi. 61
I don't pretend to have studied that article in the last Quarterly,
about the Mariner's Compass, but so far as I can see from a cursory
perusal of the same, that boasted invention should now be called The
Wrecker's Best Friend, and Sea-Captain's Complete Guide to the
Breakers. 62
The Premier speaks ...}. times, but one is always afraid lest
he should go into a fit of strong historics.

FAT CHURCH AND LEAN CHURCH,
The primary Visitation Charge lately delivered by the Bishop of
Ely, containing much that is admirable, concludes with a panegyric,
not, altogether unmerited perhaps, but rather strong, and somewhat
º to the toast, sometimes, on festive occasions, proposed by the
president of a small and select circle of convivial acquaintance; “Our
Noble Selves.” The Bishop said:–
“But in very deed the Church is full, not empty, gathering from the right hand
and from the left-full of all deep catholic doctrine, all holy evangelical truth—
primitive, apostolic, catholic, scriptural, reformed, evangelical. It has eliminated
nothing but error.”
Considered in the abstract, the Established Church may doubtless be
truly said to be at least as faiſas any other Church of the good things
enumerated by the Bishop QF ELY. Concretely regarded, it may, with
º truth, be said to be full and not empty; but the good things of
which it is not empty but full appear to partake rather of the nature of
fat than of a spiritual quality. Bishops, Deans and Chapters, and a
goodly company of Rectors and Vicars, are full and not empty of the like
good things with those that line the interiors of Mayors and Aldermen.
On the other hand, however, there are very many hard-working Curates
who are empty and not full of plain victuals and drink, and for whom
a Charitable Society has found it necessary to beg old clothes. Would
this be the case if fulness and not emptiness of all deep catholic doctrine,
and all holy evangelical truth were the universal or even the ordinary
condition, of the beneficed Clergy, and if the superior parsons were as
richly endowed with benevolence, as they are with glebe, and tithes, or
*}. revenue?, The Church, as represented by them, must be
acknowledged to gather from the right hand and from the left, grabbing
as much as ever it can, and keeping a particularly tight hold thereof.
In short, as the Bishop of ELY continues to say:-
“Having proved all things, it holds fast that which is good.”
In general, when a Bishop's will comes to be proved, the property of
the deceased prelate, if the statements that are wont to appear in the
Illustrated News can be relied on, is sworn under a figure so considerable
as to indicate that which, as the result of having proved all things, he
held fast for good, to have been money, to the amount of some twenty
or thirty thousand pounds sterling. - - - -
§: more the good Bishop makes a little jumble of the ideal with
reality:-
“It is not a compromise between truth and falsehood, but a comprehension of all
that is Christian, and holy, and true. The lines have fallen to us in pleasant places;
we have a goodly heritage.”
The heritage of the present Bishop of ELY is perhaps considerably
goodlier than that of his predecessor to whom a Royal Duke, afterwards
an amiable and beneficent monarch, the Father of his people, celebrated
for his virtues, and for a perfection of personal appearance which is the
boast of Punch, addressed the following observation:—
“My Lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there.”
The garden now forming part of My Lord of Ely's heritage, answer:
able to the one which formerly adjoined the site of Ely Place, would
probably be found to contain not only good strawberries, but also
excellent peaches and nectarines, and very likely pine-Apples also, and
other such kindly fruits of the earth in due season. The lines which
circumscribe and constitute the domains of Bishops have certainly fallen
to them in pleasant places; but those which form the slums, and back
settlements, and rustic wilds, wherein is cast the lot of the inferior
º fallen to their occupants in unpleasant places, and are very
arol III.108.
Cruelty to the Clergy.
IT seems that in Prussia, people who are desirous to be divorced are
not allowed to petition until the parson of the district has given them
both a good talking to. If he fail to persuade them to make it up, the
may apply to the Courts. Is not this rather hard upon the parson? It
is making a workman, say a Joiner, come into a house and argue that
his work sticks together, when it notoriously does not.

INTELLECTUAL TREAT.
A Lecturº was delivered yesterday at the Meeting Hall of the Con-
º Temperance Literary and Scientific Union, Humborough,
y the Rºy. EBENEzen, Jowles, on the subject of "The Strong fan.
guage of SHAKspeaRE.”., M.R. Jowles lamented to say that the pages
of the world-renowned Bard of Avon were painfully disfigured by ºx.
pressions now chiefly in use amongst the humbler classes, ſº too
often, employed, as expletives, in conversation by unconverted indi.
viduals moving in higher circles of society. As examples of the strong
language to which he referred, he particularly instanced the impreca.
tions, uţ by SHAKSPEARE into the mouth of Macbeth on "those that
tºust," the Weird Sisters, on the “cream-faced loon,” and on himselfor
Macduff, whichever of the two, in the combat about to ensue between
them, shall cry “Hold!” and express himself satisfied. The Reverend
Lecturer delivered these maledictory utterances with powerful emphasis
and effect, and an º gusto that was very amusing. His recita-
tion of the words and phrases, thus necessarily quoted for the urpose
of illustration, was received with great applause. After the fºre
the assembly, partook of tea and plum-cake, and then separated, de-
claring that they had tasted much sweetness,

Prussia's Representative Man.
According to a telegram from Paris:–
Prussia has signified her willingness to send a representative to the Sanitary
Conference which is to be held at Constantinople.”
If Prussia is correctly represented by her representative, who will
consent to sit in the same room with him? To represent Prussia, as
she is, a man must be the self-convicted speaker of the thing which is
not, and a criminal who has merited a legal, not a diplomatic ultimatum.

PRESIDENT PAT.
(From the forthcoming History of Parliament.)
ONE blow and Ireland sprang from the head of her Saxon Enslaver
a new Minerva! Proudly and solemnly she then sat down to frame a
Republic worthy of PLATO and PAT. Her first President had been a
workhouse porter and a night watchman. He was, *::::: eminently
fitted both for civil and military administration. The speech of PREsi.
DENT PAT on opening Congress developes his policy and his well-digested
plans of legislative reform. Here are a few choice quotations:–
The Key-stone of Government is the blarney stone.
Political progress may always be accelerated by a bludgeon.
Our Institutions must be consolidated by soft soap and whacks.
The People's Will is made known by manifesto, and by many fists too.
Every man, shall be qualified to sit, in Congress that is a 10 lb. pig-
holder, provided that the pig and the Member sleep under the same roof.
Members of Congress will be remunerated for their public services.
Gentlemen wearing gloves only to have the privilege of shaking the
President's hand. The unwashed to be paid at the door.
Pipes will not be allowed on the Opposition benches, nor may any
Member take whiskey until challenged by the President. . . . . .
Under no circumstances will a Member be suffered to sit with his
blunderbuss at full-cock, nor pointed at the President's ear.
Our Ambassadors will be chosen from our most meritorious postmen,
so that they may have no difficulty in reading their letters. -
The Foreign Office will be presided over by a patriotic Editor who
has travelled in New South Wales and is thoroughly conversant with
its language. - - -
Instead of Bulwarks, the island will be fortified by Irish bulls; our
military engineers being of opinion that no other horn-works are so
efficient or necessary.
To prevent ºf: between Landlord and Tenant, a Govern-
ment collector of rents will be appointed, and tenant-right shall include
a power to shoot over the land, and at any one on it.
A Marked Man.
The Poet Close has been pelted with peas at Penrith for insulting
the good people there during a lecture. We hope the offence and
punishment will not be repeated, or else we shall be inclined to say
that the only part of our Close likely to become known to Posterity
will be the Pea-jacket.

PRINCE PUNCH AT THE PRINCESS’S.
His Roy AL HIGHNess PRINCE PUNCH, attended by the PRINCE OF
WALEs, visited the Princess's Theatre on Wednesday evening last, to
see the new play.
“The Princess may come with us?” inquired the latter Prince. “Or
are the prison scenes too strong for her?”
“Oh, I have good nerve,” replied the Rose of Denmark, “and the
thing will be a novelty, for I have never been in prison yet. Besides,”
she added, archly, “ this is Wednesday, you know, and I cannot on a
Wednesday let you take away my Punch.”
The Princess went with them, looking charmingly, of course, and
wearing, as usual, a lovely wreath of smiles. On the rest of her costume
comment were superfluous.
The fact that the Royal party, H.R.H. PRINCE PUNCH included, saw
the whole play out, from the first scene to the last, may be taken as
sufficient º of its attractiveness. For three hours and three-
quarters the bright eyes of the Princess were fixed upon the stage,
excepting when, during, the entr’actes, they beamed upon PRINCE
PUNCH. This fact, which is a fact (and the Court Circular can't deny
it), is a proof, if proof be needed, that the prison scenes showed
nothing offensive to her eyes, and they are sweetly tender ones.
Had there been anything ºl." or revolting on the stage, the
delicate Princess would have been first to shrink and shudder at it.
Either, then, the scenes have been softened and toned down since the
hiss on the first night, or the gentlemen who hissed were unusually
squeamish. -
“But tell me,” asked the Princess, “is the picture true? Are there
prisons such as this?”
“Well, really,” said PRINCE PUNch, “extensive as my knowledge
is, I cannot undertake to speak from personal experience. If it wasn’t
for the nuisance of losing one's moustache, I'd pick ALBERT EDWARD's
pocket, and get sent to Cold Bath Fields. I certainly have noticed that

“Well, as a woman,” said the Princess, “I’d rather, go to Botany
Bay than try the Silent System. But see—“Advance Australia’—Oh,
what a pretty scene!”
Thus pleasantly conversing, the Royal party passed a most agreeable
evening; and after a light supper of eleven dozen oysters, which the
Princess would have opened for him, had the fishmonger not done so,
PRINCE PUNCH tore himself away. Lighting a large cigar, to assist
him in reflection, he then..". on the problem how men, who
called such scenes as he had seen to-night “offensive,” could tolerate
a MENKEN without similar remark. He furthermore reflected that the
play which he had seen perhaps might do good service by showing that
a F." is not a pleasant place, and that there may be gaols in England
where the prisoners are not pets. Critics may object that the sympathy
of the audience is awakened for the prisoners; and, further, may con-
tend that few playgoers can find pleasure in seeing painful scenes. That
there is sense in this, PRINCE PUNCH is willing to admit; but poison
scenes have been presented quite as painful as these prison ones, and
have not #;" been hissed. Hiss away, by all means, gentlemen, when
you ſind fit provocation; but let your sibilation be consistent, if you
please, and do not strain at the prison while swallowing the poison,
else, possibly, your hissing may be held of little worth, and it be said of a
new play at which these tongues of yours may sibilate, that in reality
the drama laudaturah “hiss.”

WHAT is the Diet of those small Germans who, having been used as

THE SHEFFIELD TONIO FOR CHILDREN.
A New tonic has been discovered by a gentleman of Sheffield, named
IRossIDE. A curious coincidence is suggested by the fact that Iron
itself is a very powerful tonic. The tonic, however, discovered by MR.
IRONSIDE, is nothing of his own name, but may be described as free
caloric in combination with carbonic and sulphurous acid gas, and other
gases the result of combustion.
The Town Council of Sheffield met ºl. the other day, for the
purpose of taking into consideration the Report of the Children's Em:
ployment Commission relative to the overworking of children practised
in the trades of that town. According to that Report, a boy, only nine
ears old, living at Wadsley, four or five miles from Sheffield, was obliged
# his father to work as cellar-boy in one of the furnaces, on most days
of the week from six in the morning to six or seven in the evening, and
On .#. from three in the morning till three in the afternoon. This
enforced labour at a high temperature would, if only occasional, appear
to be equivalent to a somewhat long compulsory innings in the Turkish
bath. Imposed nearly every day, it may be considered by some who
do not consider too deeply, to constitute a combination of the Turkish
bath with Turkish tyranny, and tyranny about as barbarous as ever was
H. in º MR, IRONSIDE, however, defended its imposition.
e regards it as having the beneficial operation of the Turkish bath
alone—that of invigorating the system. The Report, with reference to
the boy above mentioned, stated that on Friday nights, when it was
too late for him to go home, he had to º on the floor of the furnace,
“with an . under him, and a bit of jacket over him.” . Of the
dormitory which he thus occupied on the night of every Friday, MR.
IRONSIDE declared that “the place would certainly be warm and com-
fortable;” rather, to be sure, one would think, less comfortable than
warm, like another place which politeness forbids anybody but a clergy-
man to mention to such employers as those of whom MR. IRONSIDE is
the apologist.
Warmth and comfort are of course conducive to health; but the
comfort and the warmth of the atmosphere of a furnace-house are repre-
sented by MR, IRONSIDE has having quite a peculiar effect in sustainin
the youthful stamina. For these are words which that physiologica
philanthropistis further reported to have spoken on the above-mentioned
occasion :-
“A girl in INGLEson's tobacco manufactory, ten years old, could not answer a
single question in arithmetic. . He (MR, IRonside) was not †† it, because his
idea was that at that age children should be exercising their ies and getting
their bodies strengthened.”
That is to say, they ought to be exercising their bodies by working
in a furnace-room some twelve hours a day, and flºº, their bodies
strengthened by inhaling the gaseous*.*.*. given off from the coke
or coal burning in the ſurnace. ot air impregnated with these
salubrious additions, inhaled during hard labour for half a day, is the
tonic for children of tender age which has been discovered by
Mr. Ironside. By the way is MR. IRONSIDE the representative of
any of those Ironsides who fought under GROMWELL, and whom the
great PROTEcton described as “men who have a conscience of what
they do?”
W. likely the Sheffield or Ironside Tonic will supersede Cod Liver
Oil, and children threatened with consumption will be recommended
º, removal to Sheffield furnace-houses, and others, for change
Of alr.
For the discovery of his new Tonic for children, MR. IRONSIDE
cannot of course take out a patent; but he ought not to go unrewarded.
The Medical Council may think it right to present him with an
honorary diploma, and perhaps, also, he will be elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society.
Hoax about Indian Hemp.
A RECENT impression, of Allen's Indian Mail contradicts a report
that high rank in the civil service of India is held by the two sons of
MR. CALCRAFT, the Finisher of the Law. We are justified in further
stating that no official in that service has even any such hangers-on.

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
A RETROSPECT.
Holidays all overnow, and everybody, who is anybody, back again to
work. I don't want to be unkind, nor to rake up the past, unless, for
the benefit of the future; but let me ask, what is the general feeling
about Last Summer? I own that I did not go out oft Town at all.
Am I jealous? am I envious?, By no means; only, as I stayed at
home (I think º might have asked me down to his place—but
that's all one now), Is ould be glad to ascertain with what beneficial
. to themselves, my friends travelled to, or sojourned in, divers
places.
Meeting young Covey, who at first tried hard to avoid giving direct
answers, he replied, vaguely, “Oh, I’ve been away for some time,” or
“I’ve % just come back;” and then immediately inquired of me
where I’d been ; wishing me to understand that he’d crossed the Alps,
or climbed Mount Blanc or Ararat, or, in fact, had visited any Conti.
mental region instead of Brighton, where it turned out, after all, that he
had been obliged to reside with his family. “The Governor,” Young
Covey explained, “wouldn't stump up, and so, you see, I had to stop
with the whole lot of 'em at that hole, Brighton. "Fernal bore but
ºbliged to humour the old boy.”
“So,” said I to him, “You didn't enjoy yourself, did you?” “Not
a bit,” was his reply; whereupon I wished him a very good morning,
for I had enjoyed myself in town.
Old Coyºy, whom I subsequently encountered, began by observing,
cheerily, “Very fresh at Brighton. Capital place to stop at: express
trains up to Town for business hours: mouthful of air in the morning
when you get up, 'nother mouthful of ditto when you get down in the
evening.” And thus he was running on glibly enough, when I asked him,
point b Anki if he'd enjoyed his summer's holiday. “Holiday !” he
returned, "I haven’t had a holiday for years. Can't get away, you
know. What with governesses at home, the boys' schooling, and that
ſellow John's expenses at College, 'pon my word, you know, one must
keep on hard at it. I couldn't leave my business, so I said to my wife
if we must go, why, better say Brighton; but I can't have you going
one way, the family another—John on what he calls a “reading party.”
$º. I won't stand again, and can't afford, besides the money I pay
or him at College), and the servants on board-wages. So we went
down to Brighton... But I don't call that a holiday, you know.”
“Then,” said I, “You didn't enjoy your summer very much, eh?”
“Well, no,” he replied, as if he would rather not have made the con-
ſession, “I didn't enjoy it very much; no, I didn't—er—”
I left him considering the point I had raised. At dinner that
day, I have no doubt he was ill-tempered, and went on grumbling at
Mrs. Covey about “Brighton,” “expenses,” “better have º: at
home,” “no one benefited by going,” “John extravagant at College,”
and so forth, until one of his daughters plays the piano, and he goes to
sleep in an easy-chair.
In the Club I found BoDLEY. And where had Bodley been, eh?
Why Bopley had been to Boulogne, Yes, and why Boulogne
Because BoDLEY always went to Boulogne. And how did Bodley
like Boulogne this summer ? eh?, “Spoilt, sir,” says, Bopley,
“Drunken excursionists supposed to be º". of Englishmen
infested Boulogne. It was so hot you couldn't move out until the
evening, and then you didn’t care about stirring.” Why didn't you
go somewhere else? BoDLEY replied he knew everywhere else round
about; and Paris, out of the season, was worse than London. For my
part I suspect BóDLEy, of impecuniosity. “Besides,” said Booley,
as an afterthought, “I had several visits towº in England: shooting,
and so forth. Always plenty of that.” ith this, he laughed, and
nodded, and made as if he was going away, fearing (Iknow Booley)
that ishould question him concerning these invitations. Pretending that
I was bound in the same direction as himself, I took his arm, and
inquired pleasantly: “So you’ve been shooting, eh? Where?”
-- Well, I always have a general invitation to Enlin’s place every
year.” (Ed.LIN’s place is in the north, a shooting box; I know it) “and
so it’s very pleasant; I go when I like.” He had no more been
shooting than I had, and was now only beating about the bush. “How
is EDLIN?” I asked. “Oh,” replied BoDLEY, “I haven't been down
there this time. I’ve been—I mean—I’ve—Hi! cab!” It was
worth a shilling to get away from me, “I’m sorry I must be off.”
continued that humbug Bodley, “but the fact is, I’ve got a ver
important engagement, and er—er—” “Good bye, Bodley,” said I,
in a melancholy tone, for I was grieved, and could not stop to hear him
give a feigned address to the driver. I believe he pretended that he'd
made a mistake, gave that cabman sixpence and got out when I'd turned
the corner. He hadn't enjoyed himself at all events; and besides, was
a disappointed man in regard to invitations.
I came across a fellow who’d been out, in the Saucy. Nautilus, and
had sent you his log. He hadn't enjoyed himself, and said so manhuily.
He thought he might perhaps next year, but that wasn't to my purpose.
Before MARsh, a friend of mine in the Temple, went away, he showed
me, I recollect, his |''. on paper. They, that is he and his bosom
friend STYNTER, had mapped out a new route, wouldn't I like to join
them, . Wasn't it fun? Capital. They gave me a farewell dinner,
I remember it as if it was only º: ecause we dined at a public
place, and they had both of 'em forgotten to bring their purses. Unfor-
tunately I hadn’t, and I (as their guest, mind you) had to pay the score.
Being in high spirits at the prospect of leaving England next morning
they laughed at this proceeding of mine amazingly. I didn't. It turned
out too, for I would walk to their lodgings and see the last of them,
that in reality they'd only got enough English money to take them
beyond the coast, and besides this nothing but circular notes. So
they º: me on the back, jocularly proposed writing me an order
on the Bank of the Serpentine, and finally ºf: to be reminded of
their debt when they should return. Of course I said, “Oh, it doesn't
matter, never mind,” and laughed, but it did matter, and when MARsh
told me the other day that he'd quarrelled with STYNTER at Interlachen,
that STYNTER had spoiled everything, that STYNTER wouldn't stick to
the programme, that STYNTER would'insist º rushing quickly from
place to place, and wouldn't travel comfortably on account of expense,
that STYNTER wouldn't drink wine, wouldn't share the bills, and so
forth, I say, when I heard this account of their tour, I could not help
smilingly supposing that he hadn't enjoyed himself? eh?”
“Enjoy myself!” cried MARsh, “I should think not. You can't
get on with a fellow like StyNTER, 'Pon my word, I’d rather have
stopped at home.” And I had stopped at home! Hai hai
STYNTER gave me a dinner the other day. How he did abuse MARsh!
Ifancy MARsh was in the right, if either was, because STYNTER only
gave me a pint of sherry at dinner, and only proposed wine after dinner
on condition that I would “manage the bottle all by myself, as he
didn't drink anything; ” which offer I could not conscientiously accept.
SPYER and Spoonley visited the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk.
Both say they’ll never go there again; and SpoonLEY adds, “Catch
him going anywhere with SPYER!” They tell me it was a very expen-
sive trip, and they could have seen more abroad for half the money.
Ha! haſ haſ ...I stopped at home! Hooray! I enjoyed myself!...I
did ; and if I didn't as much as I ought to have done, my lot was better
than that of these poor fellows. They’ll pat me on the back, forsooth,
another time, and tell me where they’re going, will they No, they
won't. I can refer them to their past summer of Eighteen Sixty-five.
However, I must not wander on any longer. But I come to this con-
clusion: Summer is a delusion; º: is confusion: The rule of Two
(travelling companions) it puzzles gou (for the sake of rhyme: and me,
too, in reason), and practice (poeticó for arithmetic and money matters
generally) drives me mad. Home, Home ! sweet, sweet Home!
Wherever I wander, I find a lot of places very like Home.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HIGH
IDEAS OF HIGH ART.
Ehold an example of
the language of en-
thusiasm:—
“Then, as true Bri-
tons, let us be honest.
Honour to whom ho-
nour is due. Let us
acknowledge what we
have taken from our
competitors, whilst we
strive to su them
by every legitimate
means, and let us in-
vite them to join us
in the contemplated
meeting - house and
club, which should be
international in
its character."
This impassioned
exhortation is the
conclusion of a let-
ter written to the
Editor of the Post,
by whom do you
suppose, reader, and
about what? At
least, you will pro-
bably conclude, by
some eminent ar-
tist, painter, sculp-
tor, architect, acs-
thetic potter, gold-
smith, silversmith,
worker in brass or
iron, or, peradven-
ture, composer ºf
music. The subject whereon this devotee writes so earnestly you will
naturally imagine to be the art of which he is a professor. In painting,
sculpture, masonry, ornamental crockery-work, or smithcraft in its
highest branches, you will expect to find him some such fanatic, so to
speak, as a fanatico per la musica; or perhaps actually a fanatic of the
last-named species, nobly, gloriously, music-mad. - -
No, Sir. His glowing appeal terminates with the following mild
subscription:-
“I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“oxford Street, Oct. 28.”, “An English Hamadarssen.”
The art, whose professor writes in the serious and earnest language
above copied, is that of clipping, trimming, arranging and frizzling the
hair of the human, and especially the female i. ºr. subject of his
ſervent epistle, dictated by “a sense of international courtesy and
English fair-play,” is a hairdressers' soirée which had taken place on
the previous Trursday evening at the Hanover Square Rooms. That
assembly consisted of twelve hairdressers and as many, young ladies,
each hairdresser appearing with a young lady under his arm. The
hairdressers having bowed, and the young ladies curtsied, the latter sat
down, and the former proceeded to dress the hair each of each, trying
which of them could do it best, to the admiration of the beholders.
The “English Hairdresser” writes to deprecate “an evidently anti-
French spirit, pervading the account given of the formation of the
British Hairdressers’ Society” which appeared in the Post. He de-
clares, with generous warmth of expression:-
“Most distinctly do I assert the French artists nave been the fathers of the
improved taste and skill of the British hairdresser of the present day. Twenty
years ago twelve Englishmen could not have been found who could have acquitted
themselves as did the heroes of Thursday evening.”
“Peace to the souls of the heroes!”—in goodtime, some years hence
let us hope; and in the meanwhile may they enjoy the unlimited
º: of the Court and aristocracy, and selſ great quantities of oil,
ear's grease, marrow, pomatum, Circassian cream, and vegetable
extract. The like prosperit befall the “ º Hairdresser” who is
so solicitous for the due credit, honour, and glory of his French brother
artists. And when, at last, Fate's scissors are about to snip the hair
that binds him to this block of earth, may he feel himself in a position
to utter, mutatis mutandis, the exclamation of the expiring painter, and
ºfy, “We are all going to Heaven, and TRUEFITT is of the party.”
The respect which the brothers of the brush entertain for their art is
paralleled by a corresponding sentiment on the part of the brothers of
the hair-brush. Literary men are commonly apt to express a high idea
ºf the dignity of their calling, even if that is only to afford amusement,
Perhaps they have taught hairdressers to form a similar estimate of the
importance of their profession.
The Advertiser's PARADise.—Puffin Island.
ORDERS FOR MEDICAL OFFICERS
MR. Punch,
HERE is pretty news for you by º from Paris, where
cholera has lately, as you are aware, prevailed. It º that the
house surgeons and students at the cholera hospitals have been very
assiduous in their attention to the patients in those institutions affected
with that malady. Naturally they would be, as young men, desirous of
learning their business... Well, Sir, on Monday last week, MARQUIs De
LAVALETTE, Minister of the Interior, accompanied by M. HaussMANN,
Prefect of the Seine, and M. Borrelle, Prefect of Police, visited the
Hôtel Dieu and the Hospital Beaujon. M. de Lavalette announced
that the EMPEROR, “sensibly touched by the indefatigable zeal” with
which those industrious cultivators of their profession had devoted
their energies in ministration to the cholera patients, “and desiring to
recompense the entire body in the persons of two who had particularly
distinguished themselves,” had named those two, one of them surgeon
to the Hôtel Dieu, and the other belonging to the other hospital above-
mentioned, Chevaliers of the Legion of Honour. And so, Sir:-
"The Minister of the Interior presented the Cross of the Legion of Honour to
M. Leonos and M. Lºuan in the cholera wards.”
Wemay be pretty sure that HERMAJesty will not be advised to follow
the example thus set by the EMPERoR of THE FRENCH; but only
suppose she were! No doubt the house surgeons and medical students
of the London hospitals would prove ". as º: and as regardless
of infection as the body represented by MM. LEGR0s and LELIon
under similar circumstances. Now, Mr. Punch, just fancy the Home
SECRETARY, the Lord MAYor, and SIR. Richard MAYNE going, by
command of the QUEEN, to Guy's and St. Bartholomew's Hospitals
and there presenting the Victoria Cross to MR. Robert Sawyer an
MR. Benjamin ALLEN' To be sure I have no fear that surgical
hardihood will ever receive in this country the recognition which, con-
stituted by the Cross of the Order of Valour, is at present limited to
the reward of physical *::: I mean by that, the courage which is
shown in picking up live shells, and behaving, under the fire of an Arm:
strong battery, with the unconcern attributed by the showman to the
Duke of Wellington, “a walkin’ about among the red hot cannon
balls.” If the infection of cholera should come here from Paris, I
trust that of NApoleon's example in rewarding surgeons for its treat-
ment won't. How disgusting it would be to have a doctor, who only
combats contagion and that sort of thing, although habitually, put on a
par with a fellow who has now and then to risk his life in action, as

I was talking to Lord DERBy about his admirable Homer, and we
happened to mention the passage where Diomed and Glaucus ...;
armour, and the latter is thought to have the worst of it, giving gold
for brass., “I am not sure that we should think so now, Mr. Punch,”
said the Earl. “Right you are, my Lord,” said I, and we cited several
instances in which brass has done more than gold could do, but it
would be manifestly improper for me to mention names. My own
modesty has been my worst enemy.
68.
Well, I do not know that the slang of French rascaldom is richer
than that of our own scoundrels. But the Parisians have some odd
words. An impostor who pretends to have epileptic fits is called un
batteur de dig-dig. 69
A dramatist has one great advantage. He can pillory his enemies in
play-bills and on the stage. A creditor may be insolent and his attorney
may be extortionate, but the Fºl. can make things pleasant for
both by giving their names to the rascals in his play. If it runs, all
London talks for a year of that brute Sandsugar, or that thief Mr.
Cheatineosts. Their families, shopmen, customers, clerks, and cousins,
all take care that they hear of it often enough. Ware libel, of course.
70.
It is difficult to have a straightforward answer from a Highland
witness. One of the Scottish judges, weary of the evasions and circum-
locutions of such a witness, said to the interpreter, “MR. MAcwheedle
do desire, the man to say Yes or No, if the Gaelic language admits of
that subtle distinction.”
71.
I’ll tell you another Scotch story, because it will be useful to any of
you young fellows who may be tempted to put his name to a bill “to
serve a friend.” Don't... But the story is better than advice, and may
stick in your minds. A Laird, of prudent character, was earnestly
besought by a neighbour to do this for him. He refused, civilly. The
neighbour pressed it, saying that it was a small thing to do, and would
be of much service to him. Again the Laird declined. The neighbour
became urgent. Then said the Laird, “John NIE, my man, look here. If
I put my name to this bill, you will not pay it; I shall be made to do so,
and then we shall quarrel. If you please, we'll quarrel now, while the
money is in my pocket.”
72.
... There is an old book called The Toilet of Flora. Hand it me down,
it is on the fourth shelf there, third yolume from the window. Thanks.
It says in the preface, “The chief Intention of this Performance is to
point out to the Fair Sex (that means women) the Methods by which
they can preserve and add to their Charms.” There are many curious
hints in it, but just hear what the author prescribes as “A Secret to
Take Away Wrinkles.” . No, you are not going to be sold with a senti-
mental old, moral about cultivating benevolent sentiments, and then
your wrinkles will not be noticed—the ladies of that day, would have
pitched away the book and called the writer a Confirm'd Prig. Listen
to the words of power:—
73.
“Heat an Iron Shovel, red hot. Throw thereon some Powder of
Myrrh, receive the Smoak on your Face, covering your head with a
Napkin to collect the Smoak. Do this three times. Then heat the
Shovel again, and, when Fiery, Hot, spit on it a Mouthful of White
Wine, Receive this Vapour also in your face three times. Continue
this Proceeding every Night and Morning as long as you find Occa-
sion.” Now, go home and try that, some of you who don’t look quite
as young as when I first knew you.
74.
MACHIAVEL used to dress himself in his very finest clothes, and then
shut himself up with his books. A proper respect for authors, but
indiscriminate. I put on my full dress only when I am going to read
my own back volumes. Elegant frock and morning trousers for most
other authors, and RABELAIs and GARLYLE in a shooting jacket. The
iºnine books of Miron should be perused in the costume of the
aúil.

CHAUCER, when Clerk of the Works at Windsor, directing therepairs
would make a good subject for a painter. So would ARIosto, escorted
back to his castle by the brigands of the Apennines. Mention these
subjects to your artist-friends.

Very well done, gentlemen of the railway station where Hungerford
Market, stood., That cross is a credit to London, and a worthy memo-
rial of the good Queen of whom THOMAs Hood says,
“Wherever she put down her Orts,
The king put down a Cross.”

LoRD MELBoURNE served out the bishops at the time of the HAMPDEN
controversy. He suspected that many of them abused the doctor's
Lectures without having read them. So he pretended to be ill for a
couple of days and mastered the book—he was fond of reading *::::
Then he had a dinner party, asked ever so many bishops, and artfully
questioned them, as for information. I am told that the blundering
and floundering of the orthodox hierarchs was a treat to the light-
minded. I have a notion that if the same thing were done about ColeNso
—but pass the wine.
78.
I wish the Times would prefix the names to the B., M., and D. lists.
When only Personages advertised, one could read the announcements,
and even when Persons set forth their domesticities, the labour was not
so heavy. But now that Potkins, of the Blue Dragon, proclaims to the
world that he has wedded his barmaid, MR. Gu M BENJAMIN, the Jew
dentist, prints that he has allied himself to the child of MR.JEH9-
shAPHAT FANGs, and we are informed of the demise of every Life Sub-
scriber to the Witlers’ Asylum, people whose time is precious crave the
aid of the article mentioned by Ovid—qui nunc quoque dicitur Inder.
79.
I knew a young lady who said she didn't like turtle soup. Affection-
ately rebuking her, I was answered, piteously, that she didn't much
object to the taste, but that she thought it so cruel and wicked to kill
turtle-doves.
80.
The devotees of the Hindoo god, Dwarka, will on no account lie.
I have never met any of them.
I will never be photographed again except under chloroform.

Great nonsense is talked about novel-reading. Thousands of persons
cannot do better than read good novels. Such study is the only
educational process possible with the minds of a certain class. They
are actually and hopelessly incapable of mental work. And it is a good
thing to give them an ideal of something above the standard of vulgar
existence. The bad thing is that low folks love low books, and therefore
do not get elevated at all. The slight compensation, again, is, that by
reading such folks get some insight into spelling. But the author of
th ; novel is a man whom the State should honour. I shall write
Several.
83.
I remember being in the House in March, 1818, when, on the Army
Estimates, there was complaint that officers who drew half-pay were
restrained from taking civil occupation. LoRD PALMERSTON said, “The
fact is, Sir, that º: is a kind of Retaining. Fee, for the Army. If
officers were allowed to enter the civil service they might become
averse to the military.” .
84.
Later, he defended the augmentation of our military force on the
ground of “the increase of our population and the consequent increase
of turbulence.” Hear, hear, exclaimed BROUGHAM and others.
85
A fellow has vaunted in America that it was a Fenian who destroyed
the Atlantic Cable. Primă facie, of course, the story is a lie, but if
true, it is amusing, as illustrating a renegade Irishman's instinctive
aversion to a rope.
86.
It is easy to say “Know yourself,” but who is to introduce you.
Most people go through life without making the advantageous acquain-
tance in question.
87.
And if a friend should take the liberty of introducing you to yourself,
you hate him for ever.
88.
Revenge is sweet. But it ought not to go the length of inviting an
enemy to a family party. -

HARDLY FAIR.
Thoughtless Youth. “STAMP For MARKING LINEN, SIR 1"
A TRUE ACCOUNT OF LORD MAYOR'S DAY.
Adapted for the French.
WELL posted up as usual in Parisian intelligence, our fashionable friend the
Court Circular informs us that—
“The French papers state that “la perruque du lor Maire' has been conferred on “L’ALDERMANs
Phillips.”
Some account of the ceremony of conferring “la perruque” may possibly be
interesting to some of our French readers, and we furnish with great pleasure the
following particulars. -
On the morning of the thirty-second of October, that being the day annually
appointed for the ceremony, L’ALDERMANs PhILLIPs was aroused a full hour
before sunrise, i.e., a little after ten o'clock, A.M.; for at autumn-time in England
the sun rarely ever rises much before the hour of noon. Being, like most Aldermans,
a rather heavy sleeper, a ninety-pounder cannon was found needful to awake him;
but this, being planted underneath his bedroom window, restored him to full con-
sciousness by its very first discharge. With the assistance of his butler (who in
England ſº the duties of the French valet de chambre) the Aldermans then
proceeded to put on his Court suit, consisting of a sky-blue coat, white vest, and
scarlet pants; this being, we need scarcely say, the famous combination of “the
red, white, and blue,” whereof Great Britain proudly boasts.
Having partaken of a frugal breakfast, served a l'Anglaise in the kitchen, and
comprising venison, whitebait, turtle soup, and Bristol beer, the gallant Aldermans
was conducted to the courtyard of the Mansionshous. There he mounted his
state charger, a noble-looking animal of the true-born drayhorse breed, and attended
by the PRINce of WALEs, who acted as his equerry, he trotted off to Highgate
in order to be sworn. The oath, which was administered by the ARchbishop of
Oxford, runs to the effect that, while he is in office, the Lor,MAIRE will abstain
from all intoxicating º: and coffee, Adam's ale, and ginger beer.
This solemn adjuration having duly been pronounced, the Aldermans returned at
a hand-gallop to the Mansionshous; where, having assumed his coronation robe,
he partook of a slight, lunch of eleven dozen oysters, to enable him to undergo the
terrible ordeal to which he next would be exposed.
This consisted in a visit to the Westminster Police Office, and a severe ex-
amination in the first rules of arithmetic by the Chancellor of THE Exchequer
and the Court of Common Fleas. Among the problems
there propounded, the learned Aldermans was called upon
to calculate the product of 2 added to 2; and he likewise
had to estimate the number of red herrings he would pur-
chase for eleven Fº supposing for three halfpence he
could buy one and a half. A problem so abstruse might
º ave puzzled the Senior Angler of Cambridge;
ut, the Aldermans with ready wit replied that he was not a
Fishmonger, and had never heard º where they sold
herrings by halves, and so there was no basis upon which
the calculation could be fairly entertained. In accordance
with an ancient and most venerable custom, the Aldermans
was then conducted to the torture chamber, where he was
required to cut eleven toe-nails, as a proof of his belonging
to the Company of Scissarmakers, of which he was Church
Warden in the year when he left school,
This mystical formality having duly been performed, the
worthy Aldermans proceeded to Saint Giles's Palace, and
there received his wig and sceptre, together with his splendid
title of Lor Maire, or “Monarch of the Metrolopis,” a
rander name by far than is our “Soverign of the m.”
recisely at the moment, when his Lordship's coronation
wig was clapped upon his head, a salute of sixty guns
was fired from Temple Bar, and the bells of Piccadilly
rang forth a merry peal. A procession was then formed
to conduct his Royal Highness to the banquet in Guilt
Hall, where he daily, sits as chief judge of the Central
Criminal Court. ...All citizens on pain of death are re-
quired to stay within doors, and to keep their shutters
closed, while the cortège is in view, and anybody peeping
out, like Peeping Tom of Lincoln, is instantly beheaded b
the State executioner, who attends on those occasions wit
his tomahawk in hand. It is, therefore, with some trouble
and considerable risk that we, from personal observation,
are privileged to state that the following was this year the
ORDER OF PROCEssion.
A strong Brigade of Street-sweepers, with brooms to clear the way.
A Force of Two Policemen, marching arm-in-arm.
Four-and-twenty small boys, turning head overheels.
A Mourning Coach, containing the lamented late Lok Maine.
A Force of Two Policemen, each attended by his Staff.
A Choir of Nigger Minstrels, warbling “See de Hero come.”
The Prime Church Warden of §ºupºu Company of Beadle-
era.
A Force of Two Policemen, marching both abreast.
A Jolly Old Waterman, wearing a huge head plume, that being his
way of feathering his skull.
The Church Warden of the Worshipful Company of Scissarmakers,
to which His Royal Highness the Lon. Matre once belonged.
A Liveryman of the Company, dressed in his livery suit.
A Force of Two Policemen, each munching a polony.
Seven Beadles dressed in black, and mounted on white donkeys.
The Lok Maire's Private Band, consisting of a hurdygurdy, a
bagpipe, and a Jew sharp.
Six Footmen in a four-wheeler, and one hanging on behind.
A Force of One Policeman, marching by himself.
Eleven Maids of Honour from St. Giles's Palace, attired in white, and
strewing cauliflowers in the path.
His Royal HighNess THE LOR MAIRE, seated in his Coronation
Coach, constructed of gilt gingerbread, and drawn by
kangaroos.
His Lordship's Private Trumpeter, blowing his own trumpet.
A Force of One Policeman to keep away the crowd.
At the banquet in Guilt Hall, MR, HARKER, the State
toast-master, as usual took the chair, and after carving the
rosbif, proposed the usual number of twenty rounds of toast,
which, in accordance with an ancient civic custom, were
washed down with toast and water, fresh drawn from the
Thames. The loving cup of coffee having then been handed
round, the LoR MAIRE gave the health of Messieurs Gog
and MAgog, the founders of the feast. This was drunk
by the assembled guests with “four times four” of cheerin
in the good old English style; and, it being then past mid-
night, the Lon MAIRE's grand State ball was opened by SIR
Roger De Coverlet, who, in the usual civic fashion,
danced upon the table, surrounded by the Aldermens until
the daylight did appear.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 191
AUTUMN FLOWERS FROM “LE FOLLET.”
RA LA LA, 1 sing with delight,
dear Punch, when, one month
closing and another coming in,
the Fashions for the incom.
ing month are published by
Le Follet, and Fº in my
newspaper! always read
them out aloud to my wife
and daughters, and tell them
to imagine themselves attired
in the various fine dresses
which they hear detailed,
because that will do just as
well as actually wearing them,
without costing any money,
for the imagination of ap-
pearances is as good as the
appearances themselves; not
so the imagination of solid
realities, as mutton, and fluid
realities, as claret; since the
taste of things cannot be
perfectly imagined like the
looks, as I say in refutation
of the , woman's, argument,
that if it is enough to imagine
the latter, it is equally so to
imagine the former.
In the “Fashions for No-
vember,” as announced by
Le Foilet, I find a startlin
intimation of the revival o
Bloomgrism:—
should they be heavy for early morning wear,
unless in the saddle? They are worn by the young
and light-hearted. The adage says, with, an
unessential variation, “A light heart and a thin
pair of knickerbockars.” -
“Simplicity,” according to the copy-book, “is
charming.” Le Fallet's description of the “chapeau
Empire,” which, “has triumphed ...over the
chapeau fanchon,” is an undeniable illustration
of that aphorism:-
“The principal trimmings are feathers and lace, but
gold is still worn; that a very pretty and simple bonnet
was made of tulle bouillonne, trimmed with a scarf of
the same, spotted with gold, fastened at the side in two
small bows, in the centre of which was placed a small
bird, the long ends of the scarf left floating. The inside
of this bonnet was trimmed with black velvet and gold."
Truly, a very pretty and simple bonnet. I
fancy. I see my eldest daughter in it; simpler
munditiis, as I tell her; and she makes a face.
Her sisters and their mother, too, I picture
to myself all wearing bonnets equally simple;
and then, Sir, then, I say to myself, what a
simpleton would your humble servant be; old
PATERFAMILIAs.
P.S. Now that the price of meat is so high,
how fortunate it is that dress costs little. An
advertisement now before me offers the fair sex—
“Rich Welvet and Cloth Mantles. Sable and Fur-
trimmed Cloaks of all kinds, from 84s to 100 guineas."
Cheap !
HOSPITAL notice.
ANY accidents that may happen on the fifth
-
“Linsey and knickerbocker are worn as early morning dress, and these heavy materials are made with of November are attended to at Guy S.
a vest and waistcoat, or chemise russe of embroidered cachemire."
There might be some doubt about the meaning of knickerbocker if it were not precluded
To People Down IN The WoRLD.—Try the
by the statement that the knickerbocker things are worn with a vest and waistcoat. But why new Hotels: they will give you a Lift.
FENIAN FIGURES AND FENIAN FACTS.
“You will see by the papers that a meeting of a different stamp is still going on
at Philadelphia. The #. (of whom you will probably have heard enough
before this) are trying to put a good face on their recent discouragements, but it
becomes more evident every day that the snake is scotched, though not yet killed.
The Head Centre, whom they called “Colonel’ MAnony, has advised the Brother-
hood not to brag so loudly for the future, but to keep secret as to all they intend to
do. He promises to issue the “Bonds of the Irish Republic,” which undoubtedly
have been engraved and printed in this city, although I have not been able to get
one, before the present Convention disperses. Among the officers of the United
States' army who openly take a part in these proceedings are GENERAL SweeNEY
and Colonels MURPHY, Mulchy, MulleN, and CURLEY."—Times Correspondent from

(Shebeen-orator loquitur.)
OCH, hubbaboo, and philaloo! Here’s Fenians galore!
'Tis at laste two hundred thousand of the boys that’s to the foreſ
Wid muskets by the million, and dollars on the nail
They’ll make the British Lion, dirty crather, han his tail,
Now the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wave!
There's first the mighty MAHONy—by Japers and the Powers!
It’s he's a sthriking off the bonds, that’s soon to sthrike off ours.
Then there’s SweenEy, and there’s MURPHY, there’s Mulchy,
MULLEN, CURLEY, -, .
Sure the ginia's that bates thim boys’ll have to get up early,
Now the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wavel
Who is 't dares say that Fenian bark is worse than Fenian bite;
That it's º aisy talking, when there’s no call to fight;
That while there's dollars to be dthrawn, and flats to stand the screw,
There’ll be centhres of attraction for their dollars to flow to ?
Now the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wave
There’s our Fenian Senate sits in Philadelphia, all serene,
Till the time it houlds its Session on Dublin College Green;
Wid Directhory, and Ministhers, and officers a lot,
And ache man takes his salary—and, sure, why would he not?
Now the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wavel
That’s the chat to make thim lº, of Saxons quail and quake,
Whin they hear, across the wather, how big and bould they ...
That's the chat to set the blood asthir in each Milesian heart,
Whin they hear what throops is comin', and what ships is goin' to start,
Now the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wavel
And av we don't know all we’d like ov what they’re goin' to do,
It’s becase they find it wiser to keep their mouths shut to:
And av they don’t thransmit the cash that’s raised to sthrike the blow,
'Tis becase the movement 'cross the sea needs cash to make it go,
Till the sun of Irish glory shines o'er the Atlantic wave
II. FENIAN FACTS.
(Kilmainham-prisoner loquitur.)
Sure, it’s well the flag they gave us, and the uniform was green,
For that’s the colour, I'll go bail, in which we should be seen :
l’ve knocked my head agin' the wall, and now I’m comin' to,
It's meself 'll own #. head's a dale the softher of the two;
Now the sun of Irish glory sets in Kilmainham gaol.
The badge upon our flag it was a harp widout a crown,
And I see the manin'ay it, now that the flag’s tul: down:
'Tis meself’s the Irish harp that’s been played upon too well:
And if I’d a head #. me, sure I’d have smelt the sell,
Ere the sun of Irish glory set in Kilmainham gaol.
They bid us think ov ninety-eight; they talked of pike and blade:
They ordthered us to dthrill like men, they axed us “who's afraid "
They tould us there was cash galore, that the throops'ud never stand,
And whin the fight was over, it’s we should share the land,
But the sun of Irish glory's set in Kilmainham gaol.
They tould us how the dollars from the States would tumble in,
Sorra the rap I’ve fingered ov Thrans-Atlantic tin:
They tould us of great Gin'rals that was comin o'er the main,
But av any's come, I'll take the book that they're safe back again,
Ere the sun of Irish glory set in Kilmainliam gaol.
They talked about Fºl. but by all I’ve heard and seen,
I doubt if MISTHER MAHONY’s much betther than the Queen:
And as for A's and B's and C's, when I saw them in the Coort,
If forlorn hopes must have captains, I doubt if that's the soort–
So the sun of Irish glory sets in Kilmainham gaol.
Av we’ve to help ourselves to cash and houses lands and all,
I dunnow, somehow, if the wake might not go to the wall:
And ay it’s to be Ireland for the Irish, Pats is Pats,
And they might be settlin' diff'rences like the Kilkenny cats—
So p'raps it's well the Fenian sun's set in Kilmainham gaol.

REMARKABLE EFFECT-
THE MAID HAVING BY MISTAKE POLISHED ONE OF THE DINING-ROOM CHAIRS WITH COD-LIVER OiL |
LETTER TO A NOBLEMAN’S BROTHER.
MY DEAR MR. BATHURST, 85, Fleet Street.
You are, as you may be aware, the brother of LoRD BATHURSt,
and your great grandfather was ALLEN LORD BATHURST, to whom one
ALEXANDER Pope addressed an Essay, of which I make no doubt you
as an Oxford scholar, are more proud than of any of your ancestral
honours. It is something to have the MAN OF Ross and SIR BALAAM
introduced into one's family history.
h may assume, then, that you consider yourself largely indebted to
poetry.
Now, my dear MR. WILLIAM, when you go to the Elysian Fields, and
meet your ancestor ALLEN walking about the Asphodel meads with
ALEXANDER Pope, a difficulty will, I think, arise.
A certain bard named Thomas GRAY wrote about a certain other
#. d" Welshman, and these lines are part of what MR. GRAY
lmolluect :-
“Fond, impious man, think'st thou, yon sanguine cloud,
Raised by thy breath, has quenched the orb of day?
To-morrow he repairs the golden flood,
And warms the nations with redoubled ray.”
You will say, with all warmed nations, that the English language has
never been more magnificently handled. Very right, my dear MR.
BATHURST. Then how will you excuse yourself to your great-grand-
father and his friend MR. Pope for treating a poet ill? I find from the
Bristol Daily Times. that you quoted the lines in the following fashion,
at a Conservative dinner at Cirencester:—
“He (Lond DERby) reminded him (MR. BATHURST) of the words of the poet—
Think not that yon passing cloud
Hath quenched the orb of day:
To morrow it repairs its golden flood,
And warms the nation with redoubled rays.”
Hoping that it will be a long time before you are placed in the
dilemma in question, but still recommending the subject to your atten-
tion, believe me, my dear MR, BATHURST,
The Hon. Mr. Bathurst.
Yours truly,
*INº.

THE WORST OF DIPLOMACY.
A TELEGRAM from Paris, dated 2nd November, says:-
“Count Bismarck arrived here yesterday, and was received by M. Drouyn de
| LHUYS."
I)iplomacy is analogous to misery. As misery makes men acquainted
with strange bedfellows, so diplomacy obliges illem to receive strange
guests. Had Count Bism ARCR done #º, than he has to acquire a
certain character; had he distinguished himself in relation to private
property as he has in regard to Denmark and the Duchies, he never
would have been suffered to enter the house of M. DROUYN de Luuys
at all with that gentleman's knowledge, and had M, DRQUYN De Lhuys
discovered that he had entered it surreptitiously, M. DRQUYN DE
Lhuys would assuredly have had him turned out of it with all possible
expedition: that is to say, he would have caused the Count to be con-
ducted to the door as soon as he had counted his spoons.

A MYSTERY.
zºsº R. PUNCH,-What does it
- º mean? Not the high price
of oysters since their open-
ing day, but this notice in
respectable shops in well-
conducted streets?—
-- Pinking, crimping, and goffer-
ing.
I know that in days gone
by, when men fought duels
with rapiers, and short
swords, and Toledo blades,
and other glittering weapons,
if one ruffian stabbed another
ruflian in the ribs, he was
said to have pinked him, and
pinking is still practised on
the stage when two of the
characters engage in deadly
combat; but I cannot sup-
pose that such bloody scenes
are enacted in shops with
• plate glass windows in busy
thoroughfares, with police-
men, most respectable men
in their station, passing every
uarter of an hour. I, there-
ore, fall back on another
supposition, that "pinking.”
done here is a cautiously
worded notice to ladies who
desire to have artificial stimu-
lants applied to their i.
complexions in back-parlours,
and the strictest secresy,
I am right in this notion, it may give us the clue to the meaning of “crimping,"
a word which, according to Johnson (see Latham's edition), denotes an abnormal
condition of the capillary tegument of the female cranium, prºduced, say, by one
of those “twelve British artists” who lately performed in “a grand soirée, of
hairdressing at the Hanover Square Rooms.”. But the shops where I see this
puzzling announcement are not hairdressers’ (I believe I ought to say coiffeurs ºr
perruquiers) shops, nor are they fishmongers' shops, or I might lament cruelty to
cod; and it is ridiculous to imagine #. in these times when we supply the
British sailor with Punch, and wash and comb him every Saturday night, and
maintain a Naval Reserve (at the Admiralty, I am told, they maintain a good deal
of it when you want information), any “crimping” of sailors—a sort of coup de lar
—can be carried on unknown to “ $1, Lords” and the parish authorities. The
bewilderment, therefore, into which I am thrown by “pinking” is only increased
by my difficulties with “crimping;” and the last dread item, “goffering, completes
my confusion... I cannot even hazard a guess at the business or mercantile operation
indicated by this weird-like word, Perhaps the haunted chamber sort, of feeling
I experience when I read it inscribed in gilt letters on a marqºn, ground is due to
the circumstance that when I was a little boy at a place called Oldwark (a long
time ago, Mr. Punch), on six Sunday evenings in the fall of the year the church

was too light to have candles and too dark to do anything but read by the fire
which we were never allowed to do because of our eyes, was, a . emighted
wanderer that once lost his way on a foggy night near the town, and being guided
to Oldwark by the sound of its bells, left ſands and fields to the parish-ringers for
ever. So “goffering” (I suspect a corruption in spelling) may be something as
harmless as croquet or cowslip-wine, but the association of ideas (by no means a
limited tºº.) constrains me to imagine everything that is vague and mysterious
in a term compared with which “King's Treasuries” and “Queen's Gardens”
(º: ) are words of clear and transparent meaning. -

who knows everything, may be able to explain the processes of “crimping, pinking,

Relly's Directory.
SiR FitzRoy Kelly, who wishes to turn articled clerks into angels, advises
them “to remain up an additional two hours of the night, and to throw themselves
into the society of French persons.” In the next column we read of three or four
young fellows being punished for insisting on remaining in the Haymarket at
11 P.M. SiR FitzRoy's advice does not seem altogether a safe guide.

THE GRINDERS; *
OR, “THE SADDLE ON THE RIGHT HORSE.”
THE Sheffield Grinder’s a terrible blade—
Tally-i-ho the Grinderl
He sets his little ones down to the trade—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder'
He turns his baby to grind in the hull
Till his body is stunted, his eyes are dull,
And the brains are dizzy and dazed in his skull—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
Social science sits on his case—
ally-i-ho the Grinder!
And over him pulls a very long face—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
It takes him up, and it writes him down,
And pronounces Sheffield a terrible town,
And the Grinder of all its ills the crown—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
He shortens his life, and he hastens his death—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
Will drink steel-dust in every breath—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
Won't use a fan as he turns his wheel,
Won't wash his hands ere he eats his meal,
But dies as he lives, as hard as steel-
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
These Sheffield Grinders of whom we speak-
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
Are men who earn a pound a week—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
But of Sheffield Grinders another sort
Methinks ought to be called in Court,
Ere Social Science can make its report
And tally-i-ho the Grinder!
And that is the Grinding Government Board
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
Who contracts at a price life can't afford—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder'
But Competition's tide runs strong,
And work is slack, and workers throng,
So father and child workiate and long—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder
When we call Sheffield Grinders over the coals-
º; the Grinder
For their blighted bodies and blinded souls—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder -
When we charge them with wilfully breathing death,
And short'ning their own and their children's breath,
What is't the recording angel saith
To our tally-i-ho the Grinder P
At whose door lies the blacker blame?—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
Where rests the heavier weight of shame?—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
On the famine-price contractor's head
Qr, the workman's, under-taught and fed,
Who grinds his own bones and his child's for bread?—
Tally-i-ho the Grinder!
* DR. HALL asserts, on the authority of some of the largest Sheffield
manufacturers, that the Government accepts tenders for Sheffield
goods for army use at prices so low that it is impossible to fulfil them

“If all those holding distinguished offices were to discountenance in such a prac-

GOTHIC FURNITURE.
Master George (on the arrival of the new cabinet). “Oh, PA I Do LET ME HAVE IT for A RABBIT-Hutch 1”
EXPOSITION OF MODERN PAINTINGS.
WHENEveR fraudulent and pernicious puffs are transferred from the
columns of any of our contemporaries, or from hoardings, dead walls,
holes and corners, to these pages, the names and addresses of their
authors are always either omitted or altered, because Mr. Punch knows
better than to give humbugs the benefit of any publicity which he might
possibly afford them in exposing humbug. W. the exception of the
misstatements requisite for the observance of this rule, the subjoined
copies of advertisements which appeared the other day in a fashionable
newspaper are correct. In the first of these notifications silly and
depraved women are offered the abominations undermentioned, com-
monly called cosmetics, to wit:—
“MADAMr. Esther's Circassian Beauty Wash, Alabaster Powder, and Circassian
Golden Hair Wash. These costly delicacies of the toilet impart a youthful, bloom-
ing, and brilliant appearance to persons however far advanced in years, and can only
be obtained at her residence, 74 b, Old Hag Street.”
. In the next puff simpletons of the softer sex have their morbid and
ridiculous vanity directed to the object of
“Golden TREsses, and How to Get Them. By the use of Aqua MirA Red Hair
is changed to a charming Gold Colour. Dark Hair, under the same influence,
quickly assumes the fashionable tint. Price 21s, the bottle. Sold only by 8.
SUMMER, 502, Gorgon Street, London.
The “Alabaster Powder” and the “Circassian Golden Hair Wash,”
advertised by MADAME Esther, appear to be some part of the means
whereby she professes to convert a beldam into a belle by rendering
her “Beautiful for Ever!” But the wondrous alabaster powder is a
simple white. It can only serve to plaster the poor face of an old
Fright. So it forms a stucco barely, whereon Art has work to found;
roses in a fresco, fairly blooming on a lily ground. The “costly deli.
cacies of the toilet” require the addition of others equally, costly to
impart to the coriaceous and wrinkled chaps of a decrepit old crone a
youthful, blooming, and brilliant appearance, in that plenitude necessary
to constitute the perfection of everlasting beauty.
The mere desire of becoming beautiful for ever is nevertheless sensible
enough. “Do you want to be a hangel?” the lower orders are some-
times heard asking, to rebuke the too lofty aspirations of one another.
“Yes, I do,” might be no unfit answer for an old woman. It is as
natural for Mother Goose to declare for the side of the angel as it was
for MR. Dish AELI. The wish to be beautiful for ever would be per-
fectly reasonable for any woman, young or old, if she wished to . a
beauty without paint. But what a fool, a girl must be to spoil the
beauty of her hair by staining it of “the fashionable tint ' " According
to a popular nursery rhyme:–
“Said AARoS to Moses,
Let's cut off our noses.
Says Moses to AARoN,
'Tis the fashion to wear 'em.”
One might almost think that the only reason that women who daub
their faces with enamel, and dye their hair yellow, and cage, themselves
in crinoline, have for wearing their noses, is that assigned, as above,
by the namesake of the Jewish lawgiver. There is good reason to
suppose that if it became the fashion not to wear noses, they would cut
their noses off. It is, indeed, likely enough that there will soon be a
fashionable style of nose, and that advertisements addressed to the
i. and daughters of England will propose to transform aquilines to
Sinulos.
In the meantime could the old ladies and others who have been
made beautiful for ever be got to unite in, exhibiting themselves as, a
collection of Modern Paintings?. It would be good ſun. But let the
show of these most unchristian “fools with varnished faces” comprise
adults only. According to the Athenaeum some creatures of the female
sex actually paint their children. Ineffable females'
Now, Ladies l
Lord Lyttleton, Ladies, a most intelligent and accomplished noble-

PROSPECTS OF PEACE,
From the “May Fair Chronicle.”
As a fugitive leaf may serve to show in which direction volant
zephyrs blow, so there are not wanting signs, slight indeed but sure,
j. indicate that BLANche, wearied with a long series of conquests,
is about to reduce her millinery force, and place her ornaments on a
peace footing. Some months ago we drew attention to a remarkable
fact. At Ems last summer BLANCHE had two great guns to support
her—an Irish Major and a Baron of the Exchequer, while at Llandudno
we have lately seen a more pacific policy prompting her to accept the
humble protection of a Minor Canon. - -
BLANCHE, in right of her position, with a splendid capital surrounded
by flats, must always remain a great Power. Nor is it desirable that it
should be otherwise. Lizzie and Lorry have long since abandoned
their short-lived dreams of conquest. BLANCHE has therefore nothing
to fear from them. Then let us look at her foreign relations. It has
been whispered that BLANCHE has an eye to the quis's smiles, and
aspires to extend that influence which she acquired in the Mediterra-
nean, when recently on board of his yacht. But can she do this without
wounding the just susceptibilities of her Italian cousins who are deeply
interested in the Marquis's smiles, and would regard as a casus belli any
attempt at annexation by a neighbouring power? We opine, not.
Under these circumstances we sincerely trust that BLANCHE will listen
to the counsel—the eminent counsel—SIR Lucius O’LAUGHAGIN, Q.C.,
and that their arms will be conjugally united. BLANghe cannot be
blind to the claims of one who so nobly sustained her in her hour of
trial, and brought her out of action with *: colours (vide LovEBOND
v. SNAPIT. Case on promises. Damages, £5,000.) By this course
BLANCHE will be amply compensated for her surrender of the Marquis's
smiles, and at peace with all mankind, will no longer agitate by her
charms those who have a sensible aversion to the horrors of law.

O, MANTIED with celestial blue,
Arrayed as children of the sky;
sº there are none who can but you,
What makes the price of meat so high
Thou, Butcher, with a nimble grace,
Whetting bright blade on trusty steel;
Now tell me, how you can, with face,
Ask fifteen pence a pound for Weal?
The Steak that shares a homely name
With Parliament renowned of yore,
Canst thou, without a sense of shame,
Put coolly down at one and four?
That humbler steak, named simply beef,
Less soft of substance and more dense,
Wilt thou impose on our belief
As fairly worth a dozen pence?
The price of joints from woolly flock,
That grazed upon the Southern hills,
Convulses us with fearful shock
Whene'er we scan our weekly bills.
For Mutton's cost canst thou pretend
To state a reasonable º ;
O thou that legs and loins dost vend
High as one shilling both per pound?
No scarcity of sheep and kine,
No murrain hath so heavy made
Those hieroglyphic bills of thine,
Thank importation through Free Trade :
Besides, beneath thy poll-axe fall ~~
Heads which thou smitest but to save. --
Behold abundance large in all

Doth but five shillings cost, the stone,

To thrive full well on that alone.

But, though you get the offal in,
The meat ye sell is awful—dear.
Ah! shout not, “What d'ye buy, buy, buy ; ”
Until your charges you abate.
Soon will our answer to your cry,
Be “Nothing at the present rate.”

Much custom will insure great gain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
junch's Cable-Caſh,
89.
WHEN the Gods were cleared out to make room for the Capitol,
TERMINUs alone was obstinate, and resisted the improvements. He
has repented, and is the great improver in London.
90.
A very smart letter, of course manufactured, from a freed slave to his
master, who asked him to return and be a servant. He calculates how much
is due to him and his wife, less ...i and medicine, for the years his
Massa had their labour for nothing, and makes it about 11,600 dollars.
If his employer will remit, this, as a token that he means honestly,
SAMBO and the Missis will consider about returning. Meantime, he
forgives Massa for trying to shoot him. I should not oppose the black
franchise if a quarter of the negroes were half as clever as this sham one.
91.
92.
. Women are far more honest than men, but not so self denying. That
is, a woman can never deny herself the pleasure of paying a debt when
she has the money. More of us men have attained that height of stern
morality. 93
When the Captain of a steamer says grace before dinner, it is edifying
to see the astonishment the process causes in snob tourists, who keep
their hats on. 94
Tread on your dog's tail, and he is profuse with his affectionate
apologies for having vexed you by a moment’s howling. Tread on your
cat's, and she claws your leg, spits, and sulks for an hour. I don’t
defend MRs. Puss, but you are much more careful to avoid treading on
her than on the doggie. It is just the same in families.
95.
If a man means to spend much time with his wife, a girl's sweet
temper and her ready smile ought to be reckoned as £20,000, and be so
estimated in the settlements. If she has not the sweet temper and
smile, he had better see the money in Consols, and there is one still
better thing for him to do. 96
I only state a fact. You often hear a wife say, with a sort of smiling
P. º My husband, you know, is not the very best temper in the
World.
97
ARISTOTLE says, “Potter hates potter.” May be so. The Strike-
monger of the name does not hate to talk hideous nonsense.
GODIVA is amends for Eve.
98.
I lighted on an interesting criticism, by LEIGH HUNT, in the Eraminer
for April 19, 1818. He is noticing the Spring Gardens Exhibition.
“The works of merit will be spoken of in future numbers,” he says.
“There is one picture in it, however, of Fighting Dogs, by a youth,
EDWIN LANDSEER, which we must now notice, as one of the best
fº of animals that has been produced since the time of SNYDERs.
t is purchased, we learn, by SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.”
99.
Do you know a finer line than the one I am going to quote? It was
uttered by MR. KEELEY, in the Lyceum burlesque, Robin Hood:-
“I hate most people—and dislike the rest.”
100.
People seem never tired of sending me what they call the last begging
dodge, . Somebody has got a group of children, some of them rather
nice-looking, has photographed them together, and sends the picture to
you, with each child . He states himself to be the father,
appends the usual mendicant prayer, but begs that you will indicate for
which child you wish to provide. I dare say that he has made it answer.
He is not more impudent than many begging parsons, who watch the
birth lists and attack you through your own children.
101.
Some of the old songs—the words I mean—were as delightful rubbish
as most of the new. Who did this? I remember it as a favourite lay
in my youth:—
“Haste away to the battle-field,
Where honour calls thee, honour calls thee,
Stoutly fight and never yield,
Though the fear of death appals thee."
º 1 02,”
Or the Veteran and his Progeny. I never saw this piece, I do not
want to see it.

103.
DoD's Peerage is a capital book, and you should all buy it, if only for
the sake of the widow of the author, who was a gallant officer, and
came to an early end by an accident. Dop is also a most convenient book,
and besides all the usual information, it tells you how to address your
betters. Moreover, in case any of you want to be made peers, it gives
you the “unappropriated titles.” There are six counties languishing
for the cool shade of aristocracy, Dorset, Kent, Monmouth, Sussex,
York, and Middlesex.
104.
Let us appropriate four of them. Dorset I assign to my butter-
man, who can support the dignity, as he is charging me one and ten-
pence per pound, Kent to the ingenious inventor of machines for
promoting Domestic Economy, Monmouth to the most aged Hebrew
in Dudley-street, and Middlesex to le or la MENKEN.
105.
Absinthe I hate it—look, taste, smell. Did OvID drink it? He
SayS, “Cana prius gelido desint Absinthia Ponto.”
106.
HoRACE WALPole had no children. But he says that if he had
F.; any (I agree with, Lond PALMERston in hating," had had")
e should have aspired to bring them all up as musicians. Just what
you would expect from such a Hijjī: as the Hon. HoRACE
FITz-HERVEY.) 107
A Scotch “idiot,” who was wiser than most about him, floored a
whole Assembly of Divines by defying them to tell him where to find
mention of the nine-and-twenty knives that came out of Babylon. Try
the first parson on it—bar CRUDEN.
108.
I won’t stand that in the MARQUIs of HASTINGs. Determined to
have the Blue Ribbon of the Turf, he has entered a horse by that
name for the next Derby. I call that a do.

man introduces, is superfluous.” 10
110.
“The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe
turned with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the winter tempest,
from lakes concealed in a §. mist, and from cold and lonely heaths
over which the deer of the forest were chased by naked barbarians.”
The sentiments of Englishmen, when asked to go to Scotland.
111.
No, Sir. The language is GIBBON's, and describes the feelings of the
Romans towards Scotland... We know better, and have brought gas,
croquet, and the sponge-bath into the Highland glens.
112.
CANNING used to talk of the Glutinous adhesion of LORD WEST-
MoRELAND to office. 113 -
I see several objections to the theory that LORD BACON wrote the
valuable portion of the plays attributed to SHAKSPEARE, the latter
putting in the claptrap and objectionabilities, seeing to rehearsals, and
taking the reputation, in order to screen, the philosopher from the
charge of being an accomplice of player-folk. But, I like to maintain
that theory, because it drives a certain class well nigh frantic,
114.
What old-fashioned rubbish the Almanacs are. Who wants to be
told when CAPTAIN Cook was killed, when the Royal Exchange was
burned, and when ThurTELL was hanged?...And the makers servilely
copy each other, not even verifying their ridiculous dates. Evidently
the fellows are not brothers of him whose-
“Father had a jolly knack
Of cooking up an almanac."
115.
A hundred years ago, real ladies, at whist, blew one another up, more
than insinuated cheating, and remarked that “they had thought the
devil had ceased to give lessons, but that they were mistaken.” You
will see alively and lovely dialogue of the kind in The horld, evidently
a study from Nature.
116.
There is a disposition on the part of the mechanical genius of this age
to get very bumptious. It may be necessary to remind,it that true
philosophers, notably SENECA, held that to invent anything that, is
merely useful is the work of the basest slave. Abstract thinking is the
occupation of the true gentleman-steam engines is low.
117.
Let us all go into decent half-mourning for brave Tox Sayºns. Say
one black eye.

AN IMPOSSIBLE TRIAL.
“In the Court of Queen's Bench the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE is (professedly) a
member of the Church of England. MR. Justice BLACKBURN is a Presbyterian, MR.
Justice MELLoR a Unitarian, MR. Justice SHEE a Roman Catholic, and MR. Justice
Lush a Baptist.”—Morning Paper.
SNOOzER v. BUMBLE.
This case was tried at the last Assizes. It was an action brought by
the º Snoozer, a barber, against the defendant, BUMBLE, beadle
of the Church of St. Fortywinks, at Snorterton, for various assaults
alleged to have been committed during divine service one afternoon.
The plaintiff had been continually fº to sleep, and, as it was alleged,
disturbing his neighbours in church, by nasal noises, and the defendant,
after vainly poking him many times, ejected him from the edifice, telling
him to be off and sleep at home. The jury found a verdict for the
plaintiff, damages one farthing, and he resolved on asking for a new
trial. Much interest was excited in the profession by the hearing of an
ecclesiastical case before the mixed tribunal now presented { the
‘. º Queen's Bench. Counsel of ecclesiastical tendencies had been
retained.
MR. Bovil.I. moyed for a new trial, on account of the smallness of
the damages. A farthing was no compensation to a man for being
publicly paraded all down the aisle in the stern clutch of a tyrannical
church officer.
The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE wished to know at what period of the
service the ejectment was served.
Bovill. During the sermon, my Lord.
The LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE. Unless the sermon was a very good one,
primá facie an improbability, I think, MR. Bovill, that so far from
#. client being injured, the beadle should be considered as a bene-
actor to him.
. MR. Bowl]..I.. I am informed that the sermon was a very good one
indeed, my Lord.
MR. Justice BLACKBURN. We ought to have strong evidence of that.
It is a very unusual thing in Fº
MR. JUSTICE SHEE. And in the State-Church in Ireland.
MR. JUSTICE MELLOR. In any church, in fact.
The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE. Or chapel.
MR. JUSTICE LUsh. I dissent from the Chief's last remark.
MR. PRIDEAUx said that nothing could be more valuable than the
dicta with which the Court had flººd them, but that inasmuch
as the Fº had been pertinaciously and schismatically, going to
sleep : the time, the quality of the discourse was not of immediate
In OmēIlú.
The LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE. But suppose the sermon sent him to
sleep?
ºf: MEREweTHER said that a man had no right to go to sleep in
church, and cited the authority of GeoRGE HERBERT, to show that the
worse the sermon, the more the hearers were bound to use patience.
MR. Bovill, said that the service had been long, owing to christenings.
MR. JUSTICE LUSH could recognise nothing of the kind.
MR. Justice BLACKBURN said that the superiority of the Scotch
Presbyterian religion was a shown when cases like this arose. Had
there been a deacon, he would have quietly remonstrated with the
offender, and just have given him a wee pinch of snuff.
Mr. jusrids ſush"could not consider a snuffbox as a proper
. to be produced in any religious edifice, however agreeable else-
Where.
The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE. That’s because you are a very Particular
Baptist, brother LUSH.
MR. Justice MELLOR. I don't at present see that we should disturb
this verdict...If people will, go to churches they must behave
decorously. They must take the consequence of exposing themselves
to the non-intellectual influences of such preaching as they get there.
MR. JUSTICE SHEE might not think that persons should go to
church, as to a lecture, to have their intellects entertained, but#.
this, the case showed the disadvantages of the pew system. d the
plaintiff occupied a hard chair, he would not have slept.
MR. Justice Lush said that sleeping was improper, but that a free
Englishman should be poked, collared, and hauled about by a huge

MR. HENRY JAMEs (as amicus curiæ) suggested that the plaintiff had
taken too much, or would not have gone to sleep in church.
MR. Bovill, said that if so, it was wicked, but if all wicked people
were to be turned out, and debarred from hearing that they ought to
be better, what was the use of a church 2
MR. Justice MELLQR had not said that it was of any use.
MR. Justice Lush had not said so, either.

sympathies are very partially aroused for this purblind barber...
MR. Justice Shee. I am of the same opinion. Wigilantibus non

MR. Justice BLACKBURN. I am just agreeable. . It would be a good
thing for sleepy barbers and such cattle if you had a Kirk Session in

The LoRD CHIEF Justics. The Court is unanimous, by whatever
diversity of roads that unanimity, has been attained...We cannot say
that any of the parties, concerned deserve much credit. It is always
open to a good-natured neighbour to kick, the shins, of a sleeper, and
had one of the congregation of St. Fortywinks had the kind feeling to
keep on kicking the plaintiff's shins, the Court does not believe that he
would have gone to sleep. It is alleged by defendant’s counsel that the
sermon was very good, but we have no evidence of this, and the
ordinary common sense and knowledge of mankind point to a different
conviction. Bum BLE, the beadle, technically did his duty, and his
conduct is unimpeachable, therefore, but he seems a bumptious kind of
beast. And the plaintiff deserves no sympathy, as he must have known
his own habits, and had better have attended service before dinner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MODEL VILLAGE.
FACTs are proverbially stub-
born things. But of all
“stubborn facts” commend
us to a Briton's prejudices
in favour of “vested rights”
and a man's house being his
castle, wherein he is “free
to do what he likes with his
own.” These stubborn facts
are, no doubt, at the bottom
of much that is worthy of
respect in JoHN BULL's
character. They have not
a little to do with his
Magna Charta and his
Habeas Corpus. But they
occasionally stop the way
all the same; obstruct the
efforts of the Local Board
or Nuisance Removal Com-
mittee, crouch like lions in
the path of the Officer of
Health, trip up the heels of
the Inspector of Nuisances,
and crop out in back slums,
by-lanes, and blind alleys
for district visitors and
zealous clergymen to break
- their shins over.
As an example of this class of stubborn facts, Mr. Punch begs to lay
before the world an extract from the verbatim report of what came to
the nose, eyes, and ears, of a Visiting Committee lately appointed to
inspect a little seaside village, where Cholera had been observed hanging
about, with an evident intention of dropping in if it found lodgings
ready, and a supply of its favourite necessaries of death—foul air and
filthy water. -
That Cholera had, as usual, made a judicious choice of seaside
quarters, will be apparent to all who read the Committee's Report.
Now, this Report is “no joke” in any sense of the words. Mr. Punch
can answer for the absolute veracity of the reporter, who is not one of
his own contributors, but a gentleman as incapable of making fun as of
discovering the longitude. He is not at liberty to give the name of the
village, but he will call it Mudfog. The name and locality matter
nothing. Our readers may fix it anywhere they please, between Hull
and Harlech (on the east and west), and Berwick and Brighton (on
the north and south). They will not be far out of their latitude what-
ever nook of the coast between these four points they may pitch upon.
Mudfog is, in fact, a “model village; ” and what the Visiting Committee
found in Mudfog, whether in the way of stinks, putrid wells, foul accu-
mulations, and purblind or pig-headed people, is to be found, Mr. Punch
fears, in nineteen out of every twenty English villages, seaside or inland,
rural or suburban:-
“Report of the Mud-Fog Visiting Committee (a sample street).”
House No. 1.-Old Gardener, “’ard of ’earing; has lived there four
and twenty year; drain and coal-hole in one. Never smelt nothing
'cept in wery dry weather agin rain: rather strong then in sitting-room:
would not have mentioned it, if the genelmen 'adn't axed: please not
to put it down, fear it might offend landlord, as they was wery curious
kind o people, as thought mostly about their rents.” Gave the old
man an instruction paper upon the subject of disinfectants, &c.; trust
he may not poison himself with them. Left him under a strong con-
viction that he regarded his stinks far too much in the light of reliable
weather-guides ever to allow them to be meddled with.
House No. 2.-Small pork-butcher. Premises well got up for the
occasion; shop, dwelling-house, and slaughter-house all in one. Small
back garden containing pig-stye, and dung-heap, and draw-well. “Did
not think the water was wery good; family all wery bad in the hot
weather with Dioree.” Inspected well-observed something floating
therein—had it fished out. Butcher said “It was lights,” and so it
really was, though much decomposed | "Would the gentlemen like to
taste the water? Should he get a glass for them?” Committee respect:
fully declined the ordeal, by taste. Left paper of instructions, and
advised the butcher to, alter his dung-heap and pig-stye, so that they
should not drain directly into his well.
The next three houses were occupied by Pilots.
First Pilot.—“Been a lishenced Trinity-'ouse Pilot thirt * last
fust o' January, and never was out o' the smell of the mud for more
than twenty-four consikitive hours since he can remember. Will be
sixty-four to-morrow, Built is 'ouse’isself, and drained it on his own
plan. Nobody as he knows of 'as got any right to interfere on his pre-
mises. 'As not got no well; 'as got six water-butts: ketches enough
that way from the 'evins for his Missus to do her washing and make
her tea with. Never drinks no water 'isself: thinks when anybody is
ashore that porter is more wholesome. Now, supposing as }. 'ad a
well, don't see what the gents 'as got to do with it. Considers he has
a right to drink his own sewage, if he likes it.”
Second Pilot.—“Wishes the gents “good morning.” Welcome to
look round, as much as they please. Wery proud to see them, and
wery proud of his own “sanitaries:’ got four on 'em altogether-one
in each corner of his garden; Has a weathercock a-top of 'em all, and
regulates.'em according to the wind. Has a well in his back-kitchen:
works, it hisself, with a bucket and luff-takle-purchase connected with a
small and-winch in the front sitting-room. Don't believe in pumps,
cept aboard a wessel. Uses a little water sometimes, for mixing along
with his rum. Hopes the gents will write out a good report agin' him.
Is not often at home. Caught the cholera once à. boarding of a
Rooshian. Don't want to 'ave it again.”
..Third Pilot.—Not at home: wife is, and very civil. Strong smell of
fried onions, made your. Committee's mouths water. Would not dis-
turb her cºoking, but, if she pleased, would like just to look round the
arden. Found there two pig-styes, afowl-house, a duck-pond, a dog-
ºnnel, and a few rabbit-flutches. Size of garden, 40 feet by 30,
Wacant ground in it heavily cropped with cabbage and onions. General
effect of premises on Committee's olfactories rich, but Committee found
it impossible to distinguish any individual smell. Wife said—“Yes;
her husband was very fond of all kind of animals, pertickler pigs. Con.
sidered them very cheerful things to have about. Did not consider as
they thrived if kep' too clean. (House drained into duck-pond. Was
:::::::::: very bad in her inside last week: feared she was a going to be
attacked with the cholera morbus. Considers it was the smell of the
brick-kiln the other side the water as made her ill. Knew stinks would
bring cholera. Was much better now. Had to fetch all her drinking-
water from over the way, as their well was far from sweet.”
The next, house was that of a First Officer in one of the Blue Ball
African Mail Steam Company’s boats. “Glad he was at home. Knew
nothing, he was sorry to say, about his drains: wishes he did. Thought
the well and drain were somehow mired. Would the doctor taste some
of the water?” (Here the First Officer gave the word of command in
a loud yoice forced ºf; the clenched teeth, to the small maid-of-all-
work) “”Liza! a glass of pump-water | * Water produced, and found
to be strongly iº with iron-rust. Doctor considered it was
too much of a tonic to do First Officer any good, as he was of a florid
complexion, and rather stout. First Officer “expected it was wrong
somehow, but never felt any ill effects from it.”
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4–semi-detached, shrub-shaded, single-windowed little
houses, all inhabited by the same class of wan, pale-faced ladies, whose
husbands, typically speaking, “had to Aleppo gone, Master of the
Tiger.” These ladies gave us very little information. “Had they any
complaints to make?” “Oh, no!”—“Could they tell us anything
about the drainage ** “Oh, no!”—“Was the water quite good?”
“Oh, yes; certainly l’”
Upon reference to the M.D. of this district, Committee learnt that
all the inhabitants of these houses were drinking water strongly impreg-
mated by lead; and, he added, “appear to like it, so I can’t help it,
particularly as the Landlord refuses to alter the pumps.”
The Committee's next visit was to two Coastguardsmen's cottages.
First Coastguardsman—“Had the cholera in ’44: ain't afeared of it.
Considers as it’s a natural went for the overplush of mankind. When his
time comes, knows as he 'as got to go. Considers as his time wasn’t
come in ’44. Always keeps his house very clean: does all the scrub:
; hisself, and paints his bedsteads and chests of drawers with red
lead and turps twice a year.”
Second Coastguardsman.—“Wery glad to see the gents. Will they
be seated? Will speak to his Missus about what they’ve to say when
she comes in. Can't abear chloride o' lime hisself. Has a box of pills:
bought them of a packman six year ago: believes he called them
“Information Pills: ’ has never took nothink else ever since. Wears a
galvanised ring on his third finger. Ain't afeared of cholera, nor nothink

OH ! rest thee, my Baby, thy Father's a Mayor;
Thy Mother’s a Lady so blooming and fair.
Whilst Mayoress, birth to an infant gave she,
And so gained a cradle of silver by thee.
Oh! rest thee, my baby, the time will soon come
To leave off thy food-bottle, and sucking thy thumb;
Oh! feed it, a duck, on soojie while you may: .
Green fat comes with manhood as light comes with day.

Against a Drinking Fountain;
And pausing at its marble bed,
And visage scarce teetotal
“Your health, Old Flick,” f mutely said,
And quaff'd the antidotal.
When turning round with quickened tread,
Refresh'd beyond all mention;
A voice came from the fountain head,
And startled my attention.
“Stay, stay thy footsteps, Stranger, who
Canst lend thine ear to sorrow;
My time is short, my words are few,
I must shut up to-morrow.
“The current of my life must sink
To other scenes and channels;
For mortals take to warmer drink,
With warmer hose and flannels,
“I cannot say my race is run,
'Twould but provoke a quibble;
For all that I have ever done
Has only been to dribble.

Against the poor man's porter,

Lord Russell. Well, gentlemen, as it is decided that we are to have a
series of private performances between this and February, suppose we
settle what we are to produce, and cast the characters. -
Gladstone. First we ought to determine the style of piece. I vote for
the classical drama.
Jilliers. Oh, hang that. . . . I go in for sensation.
Gladstone. Ah! I thought you had had enough of that on your
Union-rating Bill last Session.

I don’t think desirable, I must confess—

Milner Gibson. What d'ye think of The School of Reform * GLAD.
STONE could play Tyke wonderfully, and CARDwell is just the man for
Zekiel Homespun.
Lord Stanley of A. No-no–ARGYLL has a hereditary right to the
untry-boys. Only read his addresses to his tenantry.
Williers (sotto voce.) I’d rather not.
Milner Gibson. What do you say to Still Waters Run Deep º' It's
a very easy piece to cast. It inculcates an excellent moral—for all
heads of departments. I’ll play Mildmay myself. He’s a Lancashire
lad, and they'd take it as a compliment at Oldham.
Earl Granville. Either CLARENDON or the CHANCELLOR would be the
very thing for Potter; GLADSTONE would do Hawksley—he's in the
financial line, you know. -
Lord Russell. No-no., I'm afraid, the play's too new. Depend
upon it there's nothing like falling back on the old stock-pieces. We
want something as nearly as possible contemporary with the British
Constitution, as it was finally settled by the efforts of the Opposition
under Fox. Suppose we say The Rinals. -

not of so much consequence, perhaps—it is witty, and includes plenty of

FIRST's FALKLAND, but SHERIDAN’s.
Granville. Oh, but Sir Anthony Absolute don't belong to what’s
called “the lead.” He's only a first old man. That’s Russell’s, of
course. The leading part is Falkland, the heavy man, who looks
bilious, and makes long speeches with beautifully rounded periods, and
has always a sentiment, cut and dry, or a principle pat to the occasion—
that’s evidently your part, my dear GLADSTONE.
Lord Russell (sententiously). Falkland was at heart a patriot, though
he did not formally enrol himself in that chosen band, for whose consti-
i. principles HAMPDEN bled on the field and RUSSELL on the
808 IIOld.
Cardwell (correcting). I beg your pardon—“SIDNEY”—I believe.
Lord Russell. I am aware the antithesis is usually so quoted, but it
ought to be Russell. SIDNEY is a much overrated man. If it hadn't
been for my venerable ancestor—
Sir C. Wood. Hang your ancestor—
Williers. That’s superfluous, as he was beheaded—
Duke of Somerset (aside to Gladstone). And this is called doing
business!
Gladstone. OxENSTTERN wasn’t far wº

unseemly a manner, the unfortunate FALKLAND–

Sir C. Wood. Sir Anthony Absolute, Russell. That’s the only thing
settled yet. Shove on. I like to get over things.
Killiers (aside to Milner Gibson). Except stone walls—-
Milner Gibson. And them he prefers to run his head against. I
never do.
Sir C. Wood. What's the next part in the cast?
Lord Russell. Captain Absolute.
Earl De Grey. That’s mine of course. (Movement of doubt.) I’m
engaged for the military business. (A whispering in knots.)
Lord Russell. Why to tell you the truth, my dear DE GREY, there
seems to be an impression that you are a leetle weak for the part. We
thought of taking SoMERSET out of the sailors, if he has no objection,
and putting him into the Captain.
Duke of Somerset. Put me into what you like, only give me plenty to
do, and as little as you like to say. Only mind, any part I get, I

though, Acres is a low Comedy part. Ah, if we hadn't quarrelled with
BERNAL Osborne. As it is, I doubt if there's a laugh in the lot of
us—except STANLEY and myself. Upon my word, fbegin to think I
must play Acres, unless we put ARGYLL into it, in consideration of his
owning a shire.
Duke of Argyll. Oh, but I’ve read the play. Acres has to put his
hair into curl-papers, and I shouldn't like that.
Lord Stanley of A. Why not ? You would look very well & la Belle
Hélène. Your hair's quite the fashionable colour, without dyeing.
Sir C. Wood. Come, do let’s go on. Put down ARGYLL for Acres.
It won't be funny, but he’ll spout the words right, and think he does it
beautifully, and ten to one the public will agree with him. Nothing
like bounce.
Lord Russell (studying the rest of dramafis personae.) Sir Lucius
O'Trigger / Ah! we haven't an Irishman in the company. I suppose
PEEL will º: it—
Williers. He’d never do. Sir Lucius has to fight a duel. Best put
off casting Sir Lucius till you catch your Irishman.
Lord Granville. CHICHESTER, FoRTEscue would do it very well, or
MonsELL. He was in the Ordnance, so he ought to know something
about fire-arms.
Lord Russell. Fag /
Milner Gibson. Oh! I should like to play Fig-I never did play Fºg
in all my life—at least since I was at Eton, and I should rather like the

Lord Russell. David—he's nobody. CARDwell will do for that—
Cardwell. Thank you—

not be as particular. [Smiling streetly, and looking round.

Iord Stanley ºf 4. If you want your Incies (a non Lucendo), I don't
feel as if I should shine in petticoats. But I won’t spoil sport.
Lord Russell. There ! I think the cast's complete. That’s quite
enough for to-day. I’ll have your parts written out, gentlemen, with
the cues, and, if you please, we’ll meet here the day after to-morrow for
our first rehearsal. [Shut in,
THE FASHIONS.
Now Hyems, the grim undertaker,
Is coming to bury the year,
You’re asking modiste and dressmaker
What dress and what bonnet to wear:
So let us examine together
Le Follet, that all of us take,
And settle before the cold weather
The texture, and trimming, and make.
Poult-de-sole is in vogue for the hour,
Embroidered in black and in white,
With a band over star, wreath, and flower,
Just like lace to the masculine sight:
Such a robe needs no trimming at
And for colour a black or a blue,
Tho' with some a light brown has the call,
And with some a sweet violet hue.
When the skirts are made plain, we are told,
The bottoms are all º round,
And edged with a cord in which gold
Or silver thread twisted is found;
But the passementerie trimming asserts
Its claim breadth and hem to adorn,
Still in bands it encircles the skirts,
Still in silver and gold is it worn.
For the morning a linsey is best,
Tho' some knickerbocker affect,
You must wear it with waistcoat and vest,
Tight bodies are hardly correct;
You may have them with basques, I allow,
But open the waistcoat to show,
Which of muslin is mostly made now,
Tho' embroidered percale's comme il faut.
As to sleeves, they are fitly a coude,
As this winter you’ll commonly see,
May I hint—you will not think it rude *
Out at elbows you never should be;
And to crown all, your sweet winsome face
Should line a blue “Empire” bonnet,
Any trimming, gold, feathers, or lace,
Will suit you, my darling, upon it.
The Ruling Passion.
We know a Clerk in a Government Department (he objects to the
common phrase, Public Office) who is so precise, so married to routine,
that he dockets all his love letters, and minutes his answers on the back,
ties them up neatly with red tape, and puts them away in pigeon-holes.
He always writes to the lady on “half margin,” and never visits her
without first making an appointment. All the correspondence goes by
the messenger.
From Tonics to Irritants.
SPAIN, not satisfied with her course of Peruvian, bark, has now
plunged herself into a Chili pickle. This splenetic small power evidently
does not know what to be at, and the great powers ought, in kindness,
to put her into a strait-waistcoat. It will not prove easy to secure
her, to judge by the dexterity with which she has slipped out of her
bonds on former occasions.

THE STAGE AND
ITS REALITIES.
ITH that care in report-
ing all the news of the
French capital, which
distinguishes our fashion-
able friend the Court Cir-
cular it informs us that—
* Malheur awa: Paincus is
the title of a big play by
Moss. Theodore Bahnikhe
It is so very big that he can-
not º a house large enough
to play it in, as he will have
some most expensive set
scenes, one of which will be
the Bourse of 1815, showing
the animation which pre-
vailed in those days when
terrifically exciting news was
brought hourly to Paris.
There will be a grand park
with a real waterfall, and—
be envious, ye London mana-
gers!—there will be a real
river flow through the stage.”
º -

-- - ſ
| º VIII Real water has repeat-
º/j. edly been seen upon the
T | stage, but it is quite a
|M|| novel notion tº put areal
river on it. We wonder
%|W
/ | | where the , mania for
M!/ ſºlº realities will carry, us.
W/ Zººs Real lamp-posts have
//º: been really shown in a
tº street scene, and real
zºsº º hters, have pro-
* bably been hired to light
--~~ the gas in them. We own
that, for ourselves, we
- are not tempted to a
theatre by the promise of a sight of things we daily can see out of it; and as for
real lamp-posts º us to pay our money for a box, we should about as soon
be drawn to the house by real donkeys. Tastes, however, differ, and doubtless
there are playgoers who like to see some real earth dug by the Grave-digger in
Hamlet, and would enjoy to see Ophelia drowned in real water. Perhaps when
next we go to see the garden scene in Faust, we may be told that real roses are
growing near the footlights, while at the back are real gooseberries on really real
bushes. Were that enterprising manager, Mr. Crummles, living now, he might
announce his real washing tubs as quite a new attraction, and get up a grand sen-
sation scene to introduce his real pump. We remember in a pantomime to have
seen some real cows and calves upon the stage; and possibly next Christmas, if a
farmyard scene be shown, we may see some real turkey-cocks, and real sheep, and
pigs. We have no doubt that in such case a good many real asses might be
- - - E = -
found,among the audience; and if any sibilation pro-
ceeded from the stalls, perhaps the manager might say
that they were real geese that hissed.
THE RETAIL BUTCHER'S REMONSTRANCE
TO THE TIMES.
HERE's a pretty state of things, Sir,
When the Times, from every column,
At us retail dealers flings, Sir,
Letters, volum' upon volum’.
'Gainst the butcher and the baker,
Cruel calumnies you utter;
Fire Young Oxford, till you make her,
Quarrel with her bread and butter.
You forget that retail traders
By their cloth must ºut their coats;
How competitive invaders,
Strive to slit their fellows throats.
Count up credit, tips to servants,
Bad debts, interest, and you’ll say,
Cent, per cent.’s the least advantage,
We should have from those who pay.
Am I not a man and brother,
Though a butcher's steel I wear?
From abuse of one another,
Sure’t were Christian to forbear.
Of my customers who grumbled,
Till the grumbling you began;
Ask’d why up my prices tumbled,
Down my scale of charges ran?
Took comparisons to making
Of price-lists at Leadenhall,
With the charges I was taking—
As if that proved aught at all.
As if offal, clods, and stickings,
In account should not be ta'en—
Not to speak of little pickings,
Poor Retailers' hard-earned gain.
Then forbear your hand!—remember
Though it may be fun to you,
In this dead time of November,
Death may to our gains ensue.
Leave the London butcher's profit,
Leave the Oxford butler's theft,
Take our word, if aught’s lopped off it,
Far too little will be left.
ALLEGED BODY-SNATOHING AT ROME.
Now this is too good:—
“WITH HIs Holiness's CoMPLIMENTs.-The Pope has just sent a souvenir to the
widow of the late GENERAL LAMoRicièRE. A Captain of the Pontifical staff has just
orought the body of a holy martyr from the Catacombs as a consolatory present
gence:–
TRIUMPH OF THE GREAT WISTERN RAILWAY.
REJOICE,
enlightened friends of progress in the subjoined intelli.
“THE GREAT WesTERN RAILway Works.-The compact between the Great
Western Railway Company and the Corporation of Oxford for the purchase of
to his bereaved widow. The remains are those of an unknown martyr, and the
Pope has given him the name of CHR1stopher, which was that of M. DE LAMo-
RICiêRE."
O fashionable contemporary, for the foregoing statement is extracted
from the Post—as our young female friends and relations say—how can
bu?, How, that is to say, can you give currency to such a Story?
he idea of the Holy Father implicating himself in the heresy of the
Resurrectionists! And then how absurd to represent his Holiness as
sending a body to a General's widow, as if she could be supposed to be
in any want of a “subject!” If that lady were the relict of a surgeon,
there might, indeed, be some sense in the idea of the possibility that a
very queer kind of Pope might take it into his head to offer her such
a present. But the Sovereign Pontiff has never shown the slightest
signs of that eccentricity which alone would induce any man to offer
such a gift to any woman except a female doctor. If Pius THE NINTH
were asked to allow the remains, of a holy martyr to be abstracted
from the Catacombs, who can doubt that his indignant answer would
be non possumus * -
The supposition that the Pope could be capable of calling a mummy
CHRISTOPHER, after the name of a gentleman deceased, and sending it
to that gentleman's widow to console her for the loss of her husband
imputes to the successor of St. Peter, a state of mind which would
place him amongst the clients of St. Luke.
SLANG.-The idiotcy of one and the vulgarity of many.
Cripley Meadow has been sealed, so that the question of the removal of the Great
Western Railway Works is now definitely settled.”
The establishment of a Factory at Oxford will be the greatest
triumph that the Present has achieved over the Past. It is the con-
quest of mediaeval sentiment by modern principles, of spiritual idealism
by material utility, of bookworms by men of tº. The Directors
of the Great Western Railway, and their worthy allies, the Corporation
of Oxford, º well glory in having initiated the end of Oxford's
grandeur, and beauty. The spires of the old University will soon be
eclipsed by factory chimneys, pointing higher towards heaven, and at
the same time shutting out the sight of it by their contributions to the
clouds. Those ecclesiastical structures, now grey with worthless moss
and lichen, will in good time be encrusted with the soot of profitable
works. The gloomy silence and melancholy repose of the exclusive
colleges and aristocratic, halls, with their proud Professors and domi-
neering Dons, will shortly be broken and destroyed by gangs of jolly
British workmen, and by the surrounding noise of production and
traffic. The studious quiet of Undergraduates will be exchanged for
the busy hum of men, and the seat of learning will be smothered in the
hive of industry. Hooray for the authors of the inchoate desecration
of Oxford | ay we live to see a terminus reared on the site of
Westminster Abbey !!! Honour to the Gºſporation of Oxford and the
Directors of the Great Western Railway !!!

THE WALL-FLOWER;
OR, THE SONG OF THE UNASKED ONE.
(BY J-HN BR-GHT, M.P.)
AROUND my place the dancers throng,
My lonely seat the Swells flow by;
I hear the murmur, low and .#
Of prompt request and pleased reply.
For GöschEN . TANSFELD there,
impassioned wooers throng the rooms,
Młº, 's as bright, my form’s as fair,
ut all unsought the Wall-Flower blooms'
They say that I am hot of mood
And quick to º and take offence;
O'er fancied slights inclined to brood,
And prompt to scorn on slight pretence:
And therefore 'tis I sit apart,
Defy neglect, and nurse my fumes;
But not a sigh shall 'scape my heart,
Though all unsought the Wall-Flower blooms'
LORD Russell moves about the ball,
In quest, they say, of youthful blood;
On me I saw his glances fall,
But he ne'er stirred from where he stood.
I see him steal to GöschEN's side,
And in his eye a promise looms:
I see his hand to Stansfeld's glide—
But all unsought the Wall-Flower blooms'
Wooer, ask on! and, wooed, reply
I care not—I am fancy free.
A #. dream employs mine eye–
I love MY STAR, MY STAR loves me!
And when my Star shall statesmen sway
To seek its smiles and fear its glooms,
Between us they shall rue this day,
When all unsought the Wall-Flower blooms!
GRADUATES IN IMPOSITION.
It is not true that the undergraduates of Christchurch, Oxford, have
been quarrelling with their bread and butter. They have been quarel-
ling with the fellows who overcharge them for their bread and butter.
The quarrel is not a very pretty quarrel as it stands... It is a very ugly
quarrel, and reflects great disgrace on the College authorities who have
connived at the shameful cause of it. The undergraduates of Trinity
and Downing, Cambridge, complain of extortion similar to that prac-
tised on their Oxford brethren. The freshmen of both Universities are
treated as pigeons, and plucked before their time. The College butlers, and
others who overcharge the students, should have a degree in dishonesty
conferred upon them by a quorum competent to award that distinction,
with a period on the treadmill, at one University, and then they ought
all to be admitted ad eundem at the other.
An Ambassador to Prussia Wanted.
According to Reuter's Express, LoRD NAPIER's recall from the
English Embassy at Berlin is officially confirmed, but his successor
at that capital has not yet been decided on. It is a wonder that so
respectable a man as LoRD NAPIER was not recalled from Berlin long
ago, and our Government must have some difficulty in finding any one-
worthy to succeed him at the Prussian Court. We have hanged almost
everybody fit to be sent there.

A STREET block fifty yards a-head of your Hansom, is aggravating
enough, But I appeal to the consciences of all of you who ride in such
a vehicle whether there is not more aggravation in the obstinate fact
that the block must be over before you can get to the point at which it
is occurring, and so you will not be able to abuse anybody.
119.
There is a new sect in Germany. The members call themselves the
Cogitants, They say that they have a religion without a creed. I sup-
pose that these Cogitants are a branch of our Cogers.

I am very fond of looking at bookstalls. Much of my valuable and
beautiful library has been collected thence. I never, however, found
any º: the leaves of my purchases. I have heard of
a man who was ruined by finding a £5 note in a book. He was foolish
enough to exhibit it, in triumph to the vendor, who claimed it. The
buyer was defiant, the º went to work—and the usual result
followed. Should I ever find such a thing, an Old Lady in Thread-
needle Street will be my only confidante,
121.
But by what inscrutable fatality is it that a book-stall is always either
over or next door to a reeking cookshop? The fact is so, and it
abbreviates one's explorations. The stalls on the quays in Paris are
more inviting, only they seldom offer anything worth buying.
122.
The French are º looking out for a trial for High Treason in
London. They have read of the threatening, letter to the late LoRD
MAYOR, and expect it to be avenged on a scafold on Towerill.
123.
An Italian proverb says, “The smiles of a pretty girl are the tears of
the purse.” The maxim scarcely holds here, as we don’t make presents
to young ladies. ... But the frowns of an ugly woman, if she happens to
be the wife of the purse's owner, are sometimes efficacious, in the
direction hinted at. That is said, of course, conventionally. There are
no ugly wives, and we are honoured by any demand made by a spouse.
Mind that, young men. 124
Why did wild Half can stab Pots & None of the Shakspearian
commentating people hang out lights here. The question has troubled

friends, one asked me, Fat deed he Of The other, seeing me puzzled,
said, “He means Fat deed de dee Of”

The post nati get a good deal of teaching for our money. A well
meaning old gentleman, lunching at my house, said to my grandson,
who is ten, “Well, my boy, can you tell me, how beer is made ** My
boy could tell, and with a calm smile rejoined, “By brewing, the
saccharine or sweet, principle of vegetables is separated from other
matter, and after boiling with water is by fermentation converted into
a vinous liquor.” . Inheriting my turn for liberality, the child added,
“Distillation continues the series of changes, adds hydrogen to oxygen
and carbonic acid, and makes alcohol, evaporating the water.” I hope
it was all right—the lecturer retired from the room tumbling head over
heels four times, to the scandal of his previously proud Mamma.
127.
When a wise man uses the weak argument because the strong one
would be unacceptable to the many, and he is abused for shallowness
by the few, they do not thereby prove themselves to resemble him.

I was for a short time at school in the country, and among us was a
lad we all nobly persecuted because we thought that he was a donkey.
The master shared our views, to the discomfort of the youth. But the
discovery of four lines of verse, in the writing of the victim. ought to
have made us all change our opinions. They were:—
“MR. B.Ack, of Steam School,
Knocks me about and calls me a fool;
But towards the end of the half-year,
He always calls me 'Tubbs, my dear.’”
I should not wonder if TUBBs, mutato nomine, has become Somebody in
Church, State, or on Punch.

The Africaness will not take operatic rank with the º: old Jew's

His genius is vindicated by the º: he has managed to get
out of such a wretched story, but the Opera will be heard as a duty

Hindústání difficult? No., At least I did not find it so, but then
you are going to say that nothing is difficult to me. As my friend Rip

they live long and prosper. But to proceed.
182.
Hindústaní is not difficult. And there are advantages in knowing a
tongue which you are pretty certain that nobody else knows; you can
relieve your mind by muttering your sentiments freely. For instance,
you can growl at breakfast, Cha ka tº: Kaulta na tha, is men maza
mutlaq nahin-your wife will not understand it, and her feelings will
be spared, while quite as much practical effect will result as if you had
said that the water couldn’t have boiled, for the tea was beestly.
133.
Nonsense about ordering §. gloves to be made for you. You
never find such gloves fit any better than those you buy ready made,
and for the best reason—the glover never has any made for you. He
merely selects them from his box, and charges you a little extra.
134.
There is nothing in music itself that necessarily renders its votaries
such fools as you describe the majority to be. Some of the best minds
have been fond of music. MILTON was. I am. But a very common-
place person may be a very f. musician, and if such a person becomes
absorbed in one pursuit, and never reads, talks, or thinks on any other
subject—the fool is the product.
135.
Let us drink the health of {. pious aunt. You say that personally
she accepted her grey hairs cheerfully, but that as a duty to society she
coloured them black. Just so.
“The Saint sustained it, but the Woman dyed.”

I see in the Lalo Times an advertisement, wherein, a young solicitor
announces that he desires a seat in an office of standing,

Only thirteen months and a half, now, to the Millennium, says DR.

A good deal of trouble would be saved if the rule of Jedburgh Justice
obtained. It is familiarly set out in the nursery rhyme:—
“That's JACK,
Lay a stick on his back.
What has he done?
I cannot say,
We'll find out to morrow,
And beat him to-day.”
139.
The new judge is an excellent lawyer. But he is also an amiable
man, and I am sure would never have taken office, could he have known
that I should immediately be literally flooded with a torrent of corre-
spondence, suggesting bad jokes on his name. Friends at a distance,
and near, will please accept this intimation that I decline all impertinent
pleasantries on the word LUsh. 140
There has been discussion about the authorship of Michael's
Dinner. I do not believe it was Lord PALMERston's. It is not very
good, even as a squib of its day, but its personality made it a hit.
“Rather yellow, rather yellow,” applied to MR. LAMbton, afterwards
LoRD DURHAM, was esteemed a very hard hit. The idea was followed
up. I remember a vulgar song of about the same time in which his
Lordship, who had mines, was called the Small Coal Man. One almost
apologises for repeating such stuff, but it ran this way—it was a parody
on a popular ballad
“O my darling Small Coal Man,
My nice little nasty Small Coal Man,
The yellow flag that decks our van,
Is the warmint mug of my Small Coal Man."

And if my memory serves me right, the publishers of the insolence got
something at the hands of OLD FATHER ANT1c for it, and serve them
very right. I believe that I had a good deal to do with knocking that

A PLEA FOR THE RECORD.
To the Charities' Committee of the City ºf London.
GENTLEMEN,
HAVING ascertained from the speech of the Rev. MR. Rogers,
at the City meeting recently held for the promotion of middle-class
education, that among other funds for benevolent and charitable objects,
invested in trustees belonging to the City of London, there is one now
amounting to £1200, for the burning of heretics, which has accumu-
lated for some centuries, owing to the disuse of this, like . other
laudable customs of the good old time, I take the liberty of applying to
have this fund paid over forthwith to the Proprietary of the Record
newspaper.
It is true that a jealous, and, it is to be feared, un-Christian Legis-
lature, a Church, too often neologian in high places, though the epis-
copal appointments of the late lamented Premier have done something
to check the lamentable tendency to rationalism and irreverent applica.
tion of thought to matters of faith, and a public, as yet very in-
sufficiently influenced by organs of sound evangelical views, have
refused to the Church—that is, to the true believers whose opinions are
formed and expressed through the columns of the Record—the right of
burning, the bodies of heretics, but the duty of roasting them, meta-
phorically, has only become the more urgent. Where the stern correc-
tive of the Pile is refused us, the milder, but no less efficacious chastise-
ment of the Press is doubly º The Record has from its
ſoundation been, earnestly º: in this pious and profitable work.
It has never slackened in the duty of blowing up the fires of theological
zeal to a white, heat, and in setting them, to the writings, characters,
and persons of heretics, especially in the Church of England. Its con.
ductors may not have been able to command brimstone, and faggots,
but the will to use them has never slumbered, and their place has been
not ill supplied by the and bitterness of controversial imputation,
or the slower but not less blighting corrosive of calumny. I am privi.
º: to append a list of reputations of heretics scathed, and fair fames
of heterodox theologians blackened by the fires weekly kindled in our

prietors on whose behalf I have the honour to sign myself

AN IRISH EXPLANATION.
MISTHER Ponch,
Av ye plaze, Sorr, Qi'll throble ye, for the honour of Quld
Oireland, to see how some dhirty spalpeen in the Toimes has been blay-
gardin' of it:-
“IRish FAILINos.-More than 78,000 persons were charged before magistrates in
Ireland in the year 1864 with being drunk or drunk and disorderly; in an equal
population in England there were not 27,000 persons so charged. To every two per-
sons charged before magistrates for common assaults in England there were three
persons so charged in Ireland.”
Qirish failings! Bedad, Sorr, Qi'm not fond of “common assaults,'
which Oi take it manes assaultin'an' ſoightin' common people. But
Qi'd like to see the man who says that it’s an Qirish failin' to get
dhrunk, an’, being dhrunk, to get disorderly. Qirish failin’s-the
omadhaun . Begorra, Qiºd, excite his failings wid a crack o' my
shelayley !, Sorr, is't a failin' in an Oirishman, when meetin'an ould
frind, to shtand a dhrop o' dhrink?, Shure, an’ if they foight, it’s
because they love ache other. For what says the pote?–
“If iver you go to Donnybrook Fair,
An Oirishman all in his gloory is there,
Tho' maybe to his hat there is niver a crown;
Thin he meets wid a frind, an' for love knocks him down,
Wid his Sprig of Shelayley, and Shamrock so green I "
Bedad, Sorr, it's a sad heart that, niver rejoices, an' we poor divils
would be miserable if it wasn't for the pleasure of a dhrop o' dhrink
together, and a little frindly foightin’. Besides, Sorr, so many of us
poor Oirish have been Emma gratin' lately, that there’s sorra a one left,
an' Qi'll go bail that of the “78,000 persons” who got dhrunk last year

“IT ALL Dhrends upon PuTTING THE LEggin's on NEAtly, to Look
Like REG'LAR-BUILT Nickennockens!”
“KING John ” IN PRIVATE.
Sir
I wrote to you, some time, since, drawing the attention of
º amateurs fº to the opportunities afforded by the
great WILLIAM for developing what the professionals would correctly
term “small parts.” I gave you a practical illustration in my per-
formance of Friar John in Romeo and Juliet... I wish to tell your
readers, †. grafić, (which I hope they’ll follow,) what I did with
another small part that all the members of our Amateur Dramatic Club
had refused. -
We selected King John for our representation.
After forming my idea, I went to Drury Lane to see what was done
with the drama in that place. I saw MR. PHELPs as King John,
and MASTER PERcy Roselle as Prince Arthur. The child is
apparently too young for the character; but, be that as it may, he
is the best Prince that ever I saw, and so Fº did he appeal
to the sympathies of his audience, that I know more than one
member of the male sex present who was obliged to use his opera-
glasses every other minute and blow his nose violently, MR, ANDER-
son was, capital, and so was MR. BARsby, but all the French
people, the Dauphin and so forth, ought to imitate the pronun-
ciation of MR. FechTER or MADAME CELESTE. I had a great mind to
write to the management, and inform them that I thought some one
was tickling the legs of the old citizen of Angers, who appears on the
walls of that obstinate town: he seemed uncomfortable. Is there any
historical evidence to show that it wasn't the season at Angers when
King John called on them, and so there were only two elderly gentle-
men stopping in the town That, however, was not my point. Our
performance preceded my visit to Drury Lane, and we had all sorts of
people on our walls-old men, young men, the Mayor, and little ".
townboys come to see what was going on. (Atleast this is what I advise
them to have, but we could º get one man, and he was so frightened
that he, couldn't parley at all, but yielded to the º: who
appeared ºn the walls of Angers with his marked edition of the play.)
What character, you will ask, did I play? Sir, I chose Peter. Peter,
Sir, is the fanatic who prophesied that King John should on Ascension
Day yield up his Crown; and Peter was right,
... I accepted the part on condition that I might “do what I liked with
it,” and have a procession, if I wished, at my own expense. I saw what
the depths of this part were. First, as to the dress. He was a sort of
hermit; something, between that and a ballad-singer. His fame as a
Prophet (vide play) had reached, probably, across the wide Atlantic,
and certainly far beyond the shores of England. He wouldn't prophesy
for nothing: therefore he would have received presents: therefore he
would be rich; therefore he would be dressed gorgeously. But how
does a Prophet, dress when he dresses gorgeously?' I was at my wits'
end, until somebody said MARIo, and my mind reverted to Le Prophète.
The very thing: so after a short consultation with my costumier, I
--
adopted a style of dress closely resembling that of the Operatic Jean.
A dress of Jean I wasn’t that an idea! Admirable!
He appears in Act IV.Sc. 2, and on the stage are noblemen, gentle:
men, º the King himself. Falconbridge introduces Peter frefused
to come in until the line, “Not knowing what they fear and full of
fear,” had been given. Then, by pre-arrangement and paying extra
men in the orchestra, there was a flourish of trumpets and a beating of
drums. Whereupon Falconbridge exclaims, “And here’s a Prophet,”
and before he concludes his line, Peter is to enter, preceded and accom.
panied as follows:–
Five Heralds.
Knights Templars who have come from the Holy Land in order to see PETER.
[Here the Band strike up the celebrated March from “Le Prophète.”
Deputation of Foreigners who had heard of PETER, with drums.
Deputation of Deaf Gentlemen who hadn't heard of PETER, with ear-trumpets
Arabs laden with Camels, and other presents for the Holy Man.
Citizens of Pomfret. The Mayor, Ladies of Pomfret.
(Supposed to be a supporter of PETER.)
A Rich Relation who hates Peter.
The Family of the Prophet. His Grandfather, a Centenarian
- Somebody who knew PETER at home.
Effigy of PETER, the Hermit.
(His ancestor.)
Servants bearing presents made to the Prophet.
Servants bearing instruments from the Prophet's Laboratory.
Black Bºy carrying a Girl carrying a Stuffed Black Boy carrying a
Crucible. Crocodile. Brazier.
PETER's Private Secretary.
Music Publishers of the Period who want the Copyright of
PETER's Songs.
The Prophet's Clerk.
Four Halberdiers carrying on their bucklers
PETER of Pomrºt.
Behind him “treading on his heels" come “many hundreds.”
They cheer him. Boys shout. Flourish of Trumpets.
Acolytes. Acolytes.
Then Falconbridge continues his speech, and Peter dissents or
assents, as, the case may be:... Now Peter has but one line to say, and
any one who knows what “business” or “pantomime” means, will
be able to make this speech immensely telling. He is accused of pro-
phesying the King's death, and then -
King John. “Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?”
[PETER beckons to his Clerk, who whispers in his ear. They whisper
in each other's ears. The Clerk departs to fetch PETER’s books.
In the meantime the deputations and his admirers ſº him.
presents, the rich relation stands apart and scowls on him, and
the family, who have never seen the King, make the most of the
present opportunity. The Prophet rejects the presents, and in
pantomime intimates that he despises his rich relation. The
Clerk returns with folios and note books. PETER consults them.
to see if the charge brought against him is correct, and whether,
according to custom, he had booked that particular prophecy,
Finding that he has given the tip, he closes the colume, wipes his
spectacles, while the rich relation smiles sarcastically, and walks
own to the centre ºf the Stage, Mysterious music. Black boys
bring crucible and brazier. Thunder, lightning. PETER goes
through an incantation. People shudder. After this,
Peter (calmly). “Foreknowing” (slowly) “that the Truth” (politely
takes FAlconbridge's helmet as if for the cannon-ball trick) “will—fall
out—so l’” [Cannon-ball falls out ºf helmet. Great applause. Thunder.
King John. “HUBERT, away with him l’’ &c., &c. (Fight between
partisans: quieted by PETER). “Let him he hanged!” -
[PETER falls on his grandfather's shoulders, is torn from his weeping
family, shakes hands with his rich relation, who promises in pan-
tomime that he will be good to his children: then PETER falls
into HUBERT's arms, and is carried out.
You may by this possibly understand to what perfection I brought
this small part. Let this be a lesson to all Managers, Actors, and
honest students of ShakspeaRE.
The Organ of the Kirk.
CHURCH music is beginning to find favour in the Scottish Kirk. In
Glasgow organs have been lately introduced into four of the Established
Churches. Terhaps there are still a few of the disciples of John Knox
in whose eyes organs are obnoxious. There are, however, other instru:
ments that even they might be induced to tolerate. They will still
perhaps object to the organ that it is “akist fu'o' whistles,” but they
cannot possibly make that objection to the bagpipe.

ICANNOT eat but little meat,
'Tis such expensive food:
When butchers cry, “Come, buy, buy, buy . .”
I think them vastly rude.
They’ve raised the price of all that’s nice,
Beef, mutton, pork and veal:
Their meat’s so dear, I sadly fear
I soon shall want a meal.
Chorus.
So scant my fare, my bones are bare,
I shiver with the cold:
Small strength's within my shrunken skin,
Now meat so dear is sold.
My wife, poor soul! must needs control
Her appetite so good,
In lieu of chops she lives on slops,
Most unsubstantial food.
We pinch and screw for SAM, and SUE,
...And FRANK, and MAUD, and MAY;
Five little chicks who eat like six,
Nor care how much I pay.
Chorus. So scant my fare, &c.
North, South, East, West, the rinderpest
Is rife, the butchers tell,
And that is why so dear we buy ;
Ifancy’tis a sell.
It’s my belief that mutton and beef
Much cheaper should be sold,
For there’s scarce a rise in the wholesale price,
As the press hath plainly told.
Chorus. Yet scant’s my fare, &c.
I’d like to see a Compan.
To bring good meat to town,
No more at shops we’d buy our chops,
Then prices might go down.
Thus some fine day the butchers may
Look, like their aprons, blue:
And there may be for you and me
Cheap meat as e'er we knew.
Chorus.
North, South, East, West, the rinderpest
Is raging, so we’re told:
And there’s no meat that’s fit to eat,
But is worth its weight in gold.
“LESS THAN KIND.”
WE perceive the following advertisement:—
0G.-Required a Kind Master for an excellent Black Retriever Dog.
Owner parts with him on account of savage tendencies.—Address, &c.
A savage dog wants a kind master. The advertiser is evidently
advanced in the Victor Hugo school, which proposes to cure burglars
by presenting them with your silver plate. But why does he not carry
out his own theory? Perhaps, if he let this savage dog bite a few pieces
out of his owner's legs or so, the animal would be converted to gentle-
ness, the retriever be retrieved. £º again, the advertiser is
relieving his conscience by asking, for a kind master, and means to
deliver the savage over to the dogwhip much as the priests, handed the
heretic to the civil power, begging that he might be kindly used.
“There is much matter in these advertisers.”

Not for his broad acres, not for all his fine houses, not for all his

his new Countess was glorified in the eyes of JENKINs, would we stand
to be steamed with the incense and pelted with the oblations of British
Snobbery, as he has been for the last week or two, only because he has
gone and got married
We have spoken of JENKINs, but his hymeneal raptures are matters
of course. What is better worth Punch's notice is the industrious
Katowing of the Bumbledom of the Black Country to their biggest
Black Diamond. When one thinks of what that Black Country is, its
miles of sooty, cindery, slaggy desolation { day; its lurid horror b
night; its foul and tottering cottages, with their untaught, ill-clad,
un-kempt and uncared-for swarms; its drunkenness, its misery, and its
vice; its brutal men, its unsexed women, its children stunted in mind
and body 'ſ premature toil, it is a comfort to fall, back on the one
set-off to all this—the splendours of Whitley and Himley, the glory of
EARL DUDLEY's wedding, the costliness of the parures and trousseaux,
the magnificence of the presents, the ineffable exquisiteness of
the ...
Here is the oasis in that Black Country desert, wherein the snobbery
of the region can disport itself, and do homage, and grovel, and lick the
shoes of its big man, to its snobbish heart's content.
Worcester lies within the orbit of the DºDLEY sun, and its Council
has been sucked in by the all-absorbing influence which draws on to
its knees the Snobbery of that portion of the Midlands. The MAYOR of
WoRCESTER, in calling the attention of the Council to the awful, yet
intoxicating, subject, observed that—
"The Council were noted, he was happy to say, for not paying court to the nobles
of the county simply because they were noblemen, and he should be sorry if the
year of his Mayoralty were to be marked by any departure from the rule, if there
was any rule in existence with regard to the matter; but EARL DUDLEY had taken
such an active part in forwarding the interests of the various institutions in the
city that the Council might well afford to make a new rule, or at least depart from
the old one, to express the gratification they felt that one for whom they entertained
such a high respect should be about to take a step which they hoped would be pro-
ductive of the highest happiness to himself. He thought it desirable to propose
that an address of congratulation on his marriage be presented to EARL DUDLEY by
the Worcester Town Council, the address to be drawn up by the Mayor, the Sheriff,
Aldermen Hill and LEA, and MR. WALTER Holla ND. He (the Mayor) did not
contemplate that there should be any formal presentation of the address, but tha
as the Earl would be passing through Worcester in company with his bride about
the 7th December, and that #. could be induced to drive round near the Guildhall,
that would be, he thought, a suitable opportunity for presenting the address.”
Let us pray ſervently that the Earl may be induced to drive round
near the Guildhall. If he can't, one trembles to think of the conse-
quences-Worcester weeping, and refusing to be comforted—the
Mayor, in hysteries, and PADMoRE prostrated For PADMoRE, who
writes M.P. after his name, as well, as Alderman before it, trumps the
Mayor. He has been spoken to by the Earl—may caught poaching
by him—
“ALDERMAN PADMoRE, M.P., said he rose to second the resolution with great
pleasure, and more especially for one reason, which was that some time ago he (the
speaker) hº to be poaching on EARL DUDLEY's estate—(laughter)—when the
Earl caught him in the very act. His Lordship was not only kind and lenient to
him, but notwithstanding he knew that he (ALDERMAN PADMoRE) had no certificate
—(laughter)—invited him to kill anything on his estate. He thought such conduct
required recognition, and he therefore begged most cordially to second the motion.
(Laughter and applause.)
“The motion was carried unanimously.”
To be caught, poaching by a Lord! and without a certificate, too!
And to be invited by a real Earl to kill .# on his estate Oh,
ecstasy untold! Oh, bliss ineffable!, We cordially agree with ALDER.
MAN PADMoRE, M.P.. Such conduct does require recognition!
Be it hereby recognised accordingly. Let us, bow down and do our

S
LAST CASE OF COLOUR-BLINDNESS.
THERE has been fearful business in Jamaica. Blacks rioted, were fired upon,
and the riot became madness. The blacks slew many whites, and the massacre
was attended by incidents too revolting to be described in pages usually devoted to
pleasantness. It must, however, be stated that a young clergyman was hewn in
pieces, and that the blacks enacted hideous orgies, devouring the brains of their
victims. A terrible vengeance descended upon the savages, and shot, steel, and
cord came into stern use. A great slaughter was made.
All this is painful to tell, but it must be told, because it is right to show the
spirit in which the story is treated by those who claim to be exponents of the
feelings of the people of England, but who by a perverse instinct set themselves,
on all occasions, in opposition to those feelings. Those who found excuses for the
Indian mutineers, those who advocate peace at any price, and hold honour not
worth counting, are now loud in .." of the Jamaica blacks. Nothing is said
for a small white population, eight times outnumbered by the negroes, and suddenly
confronted by the foulest horrors of savage warfare. Nothing is said of its natural
terror for its wives and little children. All we hear is a howl about the severity
exercised upon the poor dear blacks.
The Reverend DR. Burns is a shining light among the advocates of the blacks.
We dare say that he is a good man, at all events he uses many words out of the
good Book. He addresses along letter to MR. BRIGHT's organ, and thus he begins:-
“I have read with feelings of indescribable horror the details of the late sanguinary doings in
Jamaica. I am sure, as those deeds are unfolded, and the whole truth shall be published in
this country, that an unparalleled feeling of intensified indignation will be produced. ... I enter
upon no justification of riots or of rebellion on the part of the misguided coloured people, but I
do protest in the name of our common humanity against the precipitate destruction to which
so many of our fellow creatures have been devoted.
This Christian minister reserves, it will be seen, his justification of riots or re-
bellion, that he may at once relieve his mind by abusing those who defended them-
selves against raging savages. He has not a word of regret for his brother Christian
minister who was chopped to pieces by the blacks. All he desires is to intimate
that he sends up to Heaven an “outcry, night and day,” in company with the
other “elect,” he says (apparently meaning Dissenters of a certain sect), and
though he does not state what he cries, we must gather, that he means a protest
against the whites who fought for their lives, wives, and babies. MR. BRIGHT's
organ, of course, echoes this minister, and at a safe distance from anything blacker
than its own misused ink, ridicules the terrors of white men who found them-
selves, surrounded by a furious crowd, notoriously inflamed by belief-evidently
º discouraged by certain religious teachers—that the negroes were the victims
of tyranny.
It is strange that fanaticism blinds men, not otherwise foolish, to the truth, and
makes them unaware of the ºf: of the great mass of their countrymen. It
is less, strange, such blindness and obtusity granted, that fanatics should believe
themselves exponents of the popular mind, and should write, as was written
in Tooley Street of old, “We, the people.” Yet they have had some lessons at
hustings and elsewhere, and have now a lesson before
them in the fact that an English Premier will not shock the
heart of England by admitting one of their party to office,
loudly as they clamour for it.
The whole history of the Jamaica trouble will of course
be the subject of a Parliamentary inquiry, and if injustice
been done, it will appear, and no Englishman will
defend it. We may appeal to work done before the anti-
English party arose, in proof that we have ever advocated
justice to men of all colours, and have done so at times
when universal philanthropy, was not the fashion, and
was not exactly rewarded with ovations. But we cannot
allow, men to describe themselves as “we, the º:
and then to outrage the feelings, of all decent Englishmen,
without pointing out that “we, the people,” means a foolish
handful of noisy quacks.
ODE TO MIDAS.
O MIDAs, who, in self-conceit
As wise as all the Grecian Seven,
The scales of justice dost, unmeet
Hold, and erect thine ears to Heaven,
On salaried or civic chair,
Or Bench whose Greatness takes no pay!
Would your sweet worship take some care
How word and word, opposed, you weight
What weight hath an accuser's tale,
That’s unsupported, and denied,
More than the story in the scale
That dangles on the other side?
Hold but the balance even; so
In equipoise both sides will seem.
That, Midas, thou dost not, and lo!
Scale of defendant kicks the beam.
Condemn not, save when proof outweighs
Denial; give those ears, O dense
Of Nature, to the law which says
Presume not guilt, but innocence.
Nor relegate, with solemn face,
And cant of being “deeply pained,”
Perchance a false accuser's case. . .
Dismiss the charge that’s unsustained.
Imagine, if your Dulness can,
The torture of another's mind,
To infamy, a guiltless man,
Or fear of infamy consigned.
Thus, oft, because a Midas, void
Of brains, reverses judgment's rule,
Behold the righteous is destroyed
Between a liar and a fool!
But thou thyself mayst victim fall,
Some day, of malice or mistake,
A blockhead on the Bench withal,
False witness for the truth to take;
Then, Midas, by experience taught
The common folly of thy class,
Thou’lt know what cruelty is wrought
By Law whose Minister's an Ass.
Important
MR. JAMEs GRANT, of the Advertiser, has felt it his duty
to contradict DR. CUMMING upon the subject of the Millen-
nium. The former theological authority has published a
new Book, called The End ºf All. Things (he owes us a
pint for this advertisement) in which he states, from his
own knowledge, that the Doctor, knows nothing about
the matter, and that we may go on taking leases, andmarry-
ing and giving in marriage. As this announcement is
official, we accept it with confidence, and on the whole
are rather glad that things are to remain as they are.
ULTRA. IRISH FENIANISM.
We understand that in the Fenian “circles” addresses
of condolence and sympathy are in course of being got
up for presentation to the insurgent negroes in Jamaica
who have been hanged.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 217
MUTUAL RECOGNITION COMPANY (LIMITED.)
IMITED Companies are now
the order of the day. In
order to insure the best
possible. Criticisms in the
public i." a society
of gentlemen devoted to
Music, the Drama, and
Literature generally, has
been formed, whereof the
basis is the Principles of
Mutual Recognition. MR.
OLIVER WENDELL Holmes
has clearly shown that
MEssRs. SHAKSPEARE, BEN
Jonson, BEAUMONT, and
FLETCHER belonged to a
Mutual Admiration Society.
(). W. H. considers such a
society to be “the crown
of a Literary Metropolis.”
To M. A. Society but few
members can belong: it
is most exclusive. The
Mutual, Recognition Com-
pany, though limited, can
enlist the names of many
more than the above-men-
tioned body. Members of
the M.R. are not bound to
praise one another; they may, if they like, and if they don't like they
needn’t, only in the latter case they must expect retaliation. . Several
members have already sent us notices of each other's books, plays, and
musical compositions. A copy of every printed criticism is kept on
the books in the Company’s office, and proofs before publication, are open
to any member for inspection; but no objection will be listened to.
Every writer may say what he thinks, but he is bound to think it.
First, we have a notice of the St. James's Theatre, by the author of
A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing. “Lady Audley's Secret has been revived at
this theatre. Those who have not yet seen Miss HERBERT as Lady
Audley have a rare treat in store for them. The Ladies' Club, another
most successful revival at this theatre. Here, indeed, is the Poet's
‘Vision of Fair Women’ realised. Elegant Miss HERBERT, gentle
Miss WENTwoRTH, sprightly Miss Collinson, dark-eyed Bessie
ALLEYNE, handsome ELEANOR BUFTON, our Three Graces, and two
over ! We must be forgiven if the eye triumphed over the ear, and if,
dazed by the fairy forms before us, we lost much of the author's neat
dialogue, that from time to time fell to the lot of MR. FRANK MATTHEws,
MR. Robson, and MR. BELTON. We reserve a fuller account for
another edition.”
[Private Note. This is all genuine, but Ishan’t finish it until Isee—I’ve
left myself another opportunity—what either the author of Lady A.’s
Secret, or the other piece says of A Wolf, &c., in his forthcoming notice.]
The next is a notice of A. Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, at the Olympic, by
the author of The Ladies' Club. “A most judicious revival. MR. Mon:
TAGUE is a rising actor, and MR. H. NEVILLE has already established
his reputation. Miss HARLAND shows that she can do something
more than a burlesque dance, and little, little Sister of Miss KATE
TERRY's is a clever child, who must be taken care of, and not be pro-
duced at hothouse pressure. A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing is decidedly
one of the author's best pieces—full of repartee and telling situations.”
[Private Note prefired to the nert Notice in the Company's Qjice.—
There is a comedy being played at a certain distant theatre; but a
journey thither involves a heavy cab-fare—that is, from any part of
the West End; and I shan’t say a word, about it until I see what the
author of that piece says of my latest production.]
The next notice is of the Strand Theatre, by the author of a new
Comedy above-mentioned. “L’Africaine, or The Queen of the Cannibal
Islands, is the new Opera-burlesque produced at this theatre. It is beau-
tifully placed on the stage; the scenery and dresses excel anything pre-
viously attempted. The acting is º the perfection of burlesque acting,
whereof the requirements are totally different to those of comedy. The
two niggers (MR. JAMEs as Nelusko, and MR. THORNE as Selika) are in-
imitable, and the piece goes with shouts of laughter from the first to last.
In this burlesque we see what musical success may be gained without the
aid of the hackneyed airs of the music-halls, and by giving the public fresh
and sparkling compositions., Miss Swanborough, as Inez, the yacht-
ing young lady, and Miss RAYNHAM, dressed as MENKEN in William,
are suited, both, by author and composer, down to the ground. There
is not such another burlesque º in London; but, warned by old
experience, they must not forget that “union is strength.’”
[Private Note.—The above is my genuine opinion, as far as it goes, but
I reserve my notice of the writing until I see what he says of my
Comedy.]
The Mutual Recognition Company begins to work capitally. We
have already got several notices of books, and in course of time we
hope to see the result of the principle in fairly, candidly, and carefully-
written criticisms on all subjects connected with Art, Music, the Drama,
and Literature generally.
ARTFUL ADVERTISEMENTS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
In these days when the newest style of advertisement soon
becomes stale, and a fresh supply differently dressed is necessary to
excite that pleasurable sensation which readers of this class of writings
alone know how to value, it is particularly refreshing to find, even
among the contributions for the relief of the poor sufferers from the
recent Gas Explosion, that this element of excitement is not altogether
wanting.
At the bottom of the list I was delighted to find the following neat
reminder:—
One who has derived considerable benefit from the constant use of
MoRIson's Vegetable Pills -- -- - - -- ... 2s. 6d.
If this system is more generally adopted, dear Mr. Punch, and I have
no doubt that you will give it your distinguished patronage, it is per-
fectly º; to think what, a rich accession I shall have to my
favourite food for the mind. I have thought over the subject so much
that I have been able to make out a subscription list in the style
I mean:—
Collected by a Curate, who with ALLEN's Hair Restorer and Zylo:
balsamum has removed all traces of the tonsure, which he had
imprudently adopted -- -- -- - -- -- ... 68. 6d.
One who has furnished his house at MAPLE's - - -- ... 4 0
A Lady, who by procuring one of ZEGRETTI AND NAMBRA's registering
* has been able to tell her friends “How cold it has 1
een" . . -- -- -- -- - - -- -- -- --
Collected by two little boys who have become thorough masters of 8
** HUNT on the skin.” - - -- -- -- -- - 6}
A Lady who sees that she “Gets the Glenfield Starch”. . -- ... 21 0
A Manager who is never without BEcko N-BEck's Polariscope and
Stage-fo
roops . . -- -- -- -- -- - - -- - -
A Coloured #. who finds great comfort in the Ebonite Crinoline .. 7 0
One who means to go and see Dosta RE .. - - - - -- ... 2 0
A Gentleman who has travelled across the Desert of Arabia on a
Rantoone -- -- -- 2 0
I am sure there are many ladies who share the same feelings with
me, and would be as much pleased at seeing a list made out like the
above as
Your admirer, TABITHA Jones.
A NEW ECHO SONG.
From the Wale of Isis.
THE servants sprawl about the Hall,
And benches where the students huddle :
Propitious fates, protect the plates,
In such a wild and glorious muddle !
Qh students oh, the cause is past divining, ... . - -
But lately we have come to grief in dining, dining, dining !
O lor, O dear, how hard and queer,
And harder, queerer, farther going,
The beef so raw, that tries the jaw,
The mutton tough beyond all showing.
Qh students oh, it is no use repining,... . - -
Oh students, do not mention dining, dining, dining !
Oh friends, we dine like simple swine!
It tells on stomach or on liver.
To mend the fare our course is clear,
Let’s chuck the cook into the river!
Qh butler, oh, still with the kitchen vying, -
Soon may you find your profits dying, dying, dying !
Nothing Extraordinary.
A TELEGRAM, coming all the way from Bombay, announces that:-
“An English girl has been sold by her parents to the Chief of Chatna for 3,000
rupees. The affair has caused much excitement.”
Why? She is not the first English girl whom her parents have sold.
English girls sell themselves every day to old fools; who generally
repent of their bargain. Let us hope the Chief of Chatna won’t.
EPICUREAN Logic.—This menaced war is perfectly unnatural. No
one will approve it who knows how good Spanish onions are with
Chili vinegar.

This won’t do—won't never dol

For so many’oary years!

Rising up agin the Butler and the Dean
Of their commons they complains,
They denies our lawful gains

MANTEUFFEL AND AUGUSTENBURG.
THE following is the text, in plain English, of the letter lately sent by
GENERAL won MANTEUFFEL to the PRINCE OF AUGUSTENBURG :—
PRINCE, Castle Gottorf, Tuesday.
When you were at Eckenförde the other day, as many as half-
a-dozen people had the audacity to touch their hats to you, and you
presumed to raise your hat in return. I know what these demonstra-
tions mean as well as you do. Let me have no more of this sort of thing.
The only person here in Schleswig that anybody has a right to touch
his hat to, except women, is, in the absence of the KING OF PRUssia,
myself. , Mind what you are about, and signify to your friends that you
are not to receive these royal salutes. You will disobey this order at
your peril. If I hear that you have had any more hats taken off to you,
either here or where you are, Itell you plainly I shall have you arrested.
I hope you understand that; and request you to accept the assurance
of my distinguished consideration.
The reply of the Prince, also in the language of conciseness and sim-
plicity, is as follows:–
GENERAL, . Nieustádten, Wednesday.
Allow me to inform you that it is impossible for me to prevent
people from touching their hats to me, and that I would not if I could
check any demonstration of loyal feeling. Instead of offering me insolent
dictation º had better recommend your master, the KING OF PRussia,
to leave the people of Schleswig to choose their own form of Govern:
ment and Ruler for themselves. If he does not do this, the fact will
be that he has seized upon that Duchy on a false pretence, and there
will remain to be said of his Prussian Majesty no more than anybody
who speaks the truth, can say of the greatest robber in Europe.
Desiring you to put that in your pipe, and smoke it under your master's
nose, I have the honour to be AUGUSTENBURG.
P.S. Arrest me, if you dare. The conscience of Europe requires to
be outraged a little more. Do it!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
punth's Cable-Čalh.
142.
JUST a hundred years ago, DR. Epward YoUNG—come, you must
have heard of the Night Thoughts—published a book called The Centaur
not Fabulous. It consists of letters on “the life in vogue,” and the
author proposed to make the foolish folk of the time sensible of their
errors. The book is not worth reading, and the author was a Hamburg.
But the frontispiece is curious. A Centaur, his human body in Harle-
quin's motley, and his hat surmounted by a weather-cock, waves a
bauble, and, trampling on the Commandments, leads, a group of fools
to a precipice, at the foot of which lies a woman with a hope's anchor,
broken, and a man sits tearing his hair, in remorse. A band of music
#. merrily as the victims come dancing to their doom. The principal
gures are two ladies, with dresses very low cut. One of them laugh.
ingly brandishes a fool's cap. Behind are a building, probably, the
Rotunda, in Ranelagh Gardens, and a pagoda, in which stands Gambling
represented by the ace of clubs. From the Centaur's mouth proceed
the words Gnothi seauton, in Greek. Our abstinent and vigorous friend
GEORGE CRUIKSHANK, should re-produce the cut, introducing a fien
with a glass of champagne, and a demon with a box of Havannahs.
Pass me the cigars, please. 4
143.
Touching which Rotunda, HoRAce WALPole went to breakfast
there on the 22nd April, 1742, and says that the immense amphitheatre
has balconies full of little alehouses. It was in rivalry to Vauxhall, and
cost £12,000. Entrance, eighteen-pence. “You see how poor we are,
when with a tax of four shillings in the pound, we are laying out such
sums for cakes and ale.” The last entertainment there was the instal-
lation ball of the Knights of the Bath in 1802. Now we have the
Alhambra, but “caparisons are odious.”
144,
I write with a goose-quill, and, I suppose that, 1 shall finish the
chapter with one. I have never had a metallic pen that came into tune
with the varying temperament of genius. It is not in the nature of
things. , You dash, through a fiery dialogue in another mood than that
in which you polish an epigram into a diamond. . A bit of metal recog:
nises no nonsense of that kind... Sometimes I applaud myself, at the end
of an ode, with a wild labyrinthine twiddle. ' [. steel pen, aghast at
such levity, splashes the ink and tears the paper. Keep your metal to
state that you have a large account to make up next Tuesday, or to
rebuke your relation for dunning, for money—the goose-quill of nature
is for the bard, the satirist, and the lover.
145.
Anchovy on curried toast is very much to the purpose.
146.
Give your children distinctive names. It is absurd to keep on calling
boys John, GEORGE, and THOMAS, merely because their fathers were so
named—and when they come to the age of receiving letters, father and
son often find out the inconvenience, and find out other things not
intended for their eyes. Of course, if a rich godfather is to be compli.
mented, that is another matter, but even then you should stick in an
EPAMINONDAs or a MonTMORENCY, to be adopted when the legacy shall
have been paid. ..It is very hard upon a fellow called Jones or the like,
never to be mentioned without the inquiry, “What Jones?”
147.
Nobody—I mean no Swell—has been married before the Registrar
only. What a flutter, there would be among the bridesmaids, if they
were all conveyed to the Office, and if the official I have named were to
rise at the breakfast and imitate, the clerical platitudes. There would
be a Sensation Wedding, especially if the advertisement finished with—
No Parsons. 148
The Representation is capable of much amendment. But I think
that a very full inquiry Fº the most commonplace reform—a plan
for Drainage, or a new, Police Act—it would be not only an English but
a sensible course to obtain the fullest information before we make a
change in the Constitution. At present we have not even trustworthy
returns to show where the existing franchise is deposited.
That is an irritating dodge of our common and unclean enemy, the
Cabman—that asking you the way, to find out whether you know town.
My answer is always sharp, short, and decisive, and usually starts him,
at a hand gallop, on the directest route.
150.
Tradesmen who let their young men practise the habit of saying
“Sir”, after being once told what you want, wonder at the diminution
of their business. I always speak distinctly, and if the answer is “Sir?”
I, immediately walk out of the shop—unless I particularly want any-
thing it contains.
151.
I seldom eat lunch. But if you like something nice in the middle of
the day, take a fine oyster and wrap him in the thinnest jacket of the
finest bacon—fasten with the tiniest silver skewer. Place him on a small
destal of not very thin toast, and put him into a Dutch oven. Show
im the fire—not too long-and eat him, multiplied, of course, by the
power of your appetite. There be worse things.
152.
A good-natured act was rewarded in Baker Street the other day, as I
was going to MADAME TUSSAUD's to be modelled. A tradesman was
driving a cart, rather fast, and a small basket fell off behind. A young
fellow picked it up, chased the cart, and after a smart run, the driver
not attending to his cries, reached it, and was inserting the basket,
when a faithful dog sprang up in the cart and bit him. Such a roar
from several Cabmen, by way of consolation.
153.
I honour engineering talent almost beyond any other. But I think
that it should ; combined with some little knowledge of spelling. I say
this, having recently seen this signature, “HENRY BRown, S.I.” The
gentleman is a Civil Engineer.
I am the Artist’s best friend. I am always suggesting subjects to
him. Here is one, and I hope it will be seized. John Brown, whose
soul is still marching on, was saving some ** women and children,
when he was assailed by a gang of Legrees. He had four white men
and three black, against forty-eight ruflians. But he made so bold a
show of fight that the Legrees turned and fled, all but four, whom he
took prisoners. He ordered them to dismount, on which they burst
into furious execrations. He commanded silence, saying he would per-
mit no blasphemy in his presence. . At this, they only swore the louder
and the harder. “Kneel !” exclaimed the stern Puritan, suddenly
presenting his pistol. There was no alternative but a deadly one, and
they all knelt. “Now, pray!” It was probably, their first attempt
in that line for many years, and their success, could hardly have been
brilliant; but he kept them at it, until they had at least manifested
an obedient and docile spirit. There are materials for an effective
picture. What do you say, MR. ANSDELLP
155.
When a literary swell has the gout, the friends who have given it
to him by asking him to dinners ou fit to do his work, or at least
make up the amount of income he loses while alternating between
morphia dreams and abuse of Fate.
156.
I wish somebody would make a Concordance to the Koran. MoHAM-
MED is accused of a vast quantity of nonsense which he never heard of,
but the book is a difficult one to hunt in. MRs. C. C. CLARKE's admi-
rable Concordance to Shakspeare should be the model.
157.
Which reminds me that DAVIp MASSON, noble Miltonian critic, hath
assumed his chair, in Edinburgh. The right man in the right place
though I i. that we lose him from the superior city. He wi
enlighten the young barbarians.
“Brave DAvid MAsson,
He will turn the gas on.
He's the man to bring his Edinboro' class on.”
158.
A gentleman, with whom I have not the slightest acquaintance,
nevertheless favours me with a circular containing much valuable advice
on the subject of investments of money. I can take care of my own
in that line. But he inserts a triple counsel, on the subject of Mines,
and this I think you all ought to hear. He says, “In Mines, no man
should speculate in shares which, at the account day, he is not, if the
market is against him, prepared to pay for and take up., No one should
speculate in progressive mines who cannot afford to hold the same for
at least a year after he has bought. No one should speculate in new
mines who cannot afford to lose his stake altogether.” Now, I can't
do the latter—send me that slice which you had cut for yourself, as I
know it is a good bit.
159.
A cut in the Charipari made me laugh. A painter, who has sent a
pºrait to the Exhibition, is sternly addressing the gentleman who sat:
“If the jury reject my work, I swear to destroy both picture and
original. You do not know how elevated are the feelings of a true
artist.”
160.
I prefer the Scottish law phrases to our own.. I understand them
perfectly. I learned them from LoftD, DEAs, and, I flatter me that I
endeared myself to a Procurator-Fiscal by remarking that if a panel
was forisfamiliated for resetting a self-contained roup at the upset
price of the feu, averments would not be awanting to show that
on jºin was libelled, and the outcome would be presently

Lord Russell, Well, my excellent confrères, it is really time the bill
of fare was settled. all we say Potage à la Reine to begin with ?
There’s the kettle of fish I left at the Foreign Office. CLARENDON can

Lord Stanley of A. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. . .
Duke of Somerset. But the difficulty of the pudding is in the making.
Lord Granville. A , who is to make it?
Lord Russell., I've all the old recipes which were so, popular in
1830-32. I made the old pudding, I believe that is generally admitted.
I’m ready to undertake the new one—single-handed.
Gladstone (blandly); I think we can't quite go even by the new
edition of your old cookery-book, my Lord, I must, with the utmost
humility, insist on having a finger in the pudding.
Lord Russell. Oh, by all means. Then let it be me and GLADSTONE.
t #. Granmille. No, really that would be giving you too much
roudle—
Lord Stanley of A. Too many cooks may spoil the broth, but too few
would be certain to spoil the pudding.
Clarendon. Unless, indeed, our pudding is to be like LoRD
CHESTERFIELD's cucumber, very elaborately prepared, with a view to
being flung out of the window.
Milner Gibson. Suppose we tossed up?
Lord Russell. Qh, anybody can make the pudding, if once the recipe’s
agreed on. Here’s mine:—"Take a million six-pound householders.
No occasion for picking them over, or washing and cleaning. Stir
them, briskly, in, with half the quantity of fine upper-crust flour, and
middlings, till all distinction, disappears in the dough. Leaven with
Constitutional doctrine: add as many sound raisins" and currents (of
opinion) as your dough will carry: season with (hustings') sugar-and-
spice and candied fruits (of experience), if you can get them. Have
a brisk fire, and plenty of hot water. Let your pudding boil one
day from eight till four, and serve up hot.”
[General chorus of adverse criticism from the assembled cooks.
Gladstone. Allow me to press my recipe in preference to his Lord-
ship's :—“Take thirty smal constituencies—the rottenest are the best
for the purpose. Cut off their members. Have ready thirty boroughs,
the largest you can find. Stick in the thirty members you have cut off
from the small boroughs—”
Lord Stanley f A. But how about the representatives of the thirty
small boroughs -
Lord Russell. I don't attach any value to re-distribution. Everything
turns on lowering the franchise.

Lord Stanley of A. Yes—but spiced with what?

MR. PUNCH-PLEASE SIR,
My Master, MR. CUTLETs, sends me to bed every night before
nine, so that I may be up early to go to market with him. But as I lay
awake I often hear him and his friends, CHUMP and CLEAVER (both jolly
Butchers) talking, as they smoke their long pipes, and drink their rum-
and-water hot with lemon. One night last week they were carousing
like gipsies so merry and free, when my Master proposes a toast,
“Success to trade l’” “Plaguey good toast that,” says CHUMP.
“Right you are,” says my Master, “it is plaguey good,” and then
they all laugh and cough till they are in danger of apoplexy. “Ah!”
says my Master, with tears in his eyes, “we have much to be thankful
for.” “We have indeed,” says CLEAVER, “rightly looked at, all
things is for the best, what is a plague spot to some is a toolip to
others.”. “Sweetly put,” observes my Master, “beef at sixteenpence
a pound is a beautiful pervision for us that have gals at boarding school
—edication nowadays can’t be had for nothing.” “If it hadn’t been
for that blessed cargo from Ravel,” says CHUMP, “neither me nor my
Missis would have seen Paris this summer.”, “Same here,”, says
CLEAyER, “I should never have bought that there row of Willas, at
Kentish Town, if there hadn’t been unity in our business. What a
united body we are, I often think. We never cut under one another
like tailors and hatters, and painters, and such like. Oh, it’s beautiful
to see such harmony among butchers. ... In another year or two, please
the pigs, I hope we shall be able to build ourselves a club-house equal
to any in Pall Mall.” -
Now, Mr Punch, though I’m only a 'prentice, I do say it’s shocking
to hear such sentiments, and l’ve made up my mind as soon as I’m
out of my time, which will be in less than a year, that I’ll open a shop
and sell good º of mutton at eightpence and sirloins at ninepence
a pound, I will. I often wonder to think how innocent people are–
they’ve no more idea what is the market price of a i. than the sheep
hisself. They have coal, why not start cattle clubs? Supposing a
number was to join together and form a Joint-Stock Company for
supplying themselves with joints. I’d be their Managing Director, if
they’d let me, and would buy a beast for 'em as cheap as my master,
and dress it too. Depend on it, Sir, there's only one way to make beef
cheap, and that is, the public must take the bull by the horns. It isn't to
my interest to say so, but I like to see justice meted out to every one,
rich and poor. I’m not ashamed of º, business, never having done
nothing to disgrace it, and am proud of being (with all proper respect,
Sir, to you), A BUTCHER Boy.
EDUCATION IN BERMONDSEY.
OUR Benevolent readers will be glad to hear that Bermondsey Work:
house, generally supposed an abominable place, is, by persons connected
with it, and apparently the best possible judges of its arrangements,
declared a tolerably decent one. According to the written statement
of one of those persons, the condition of that establishment is “verey
good,” whilst another certifies that it is “verry good,” a third that
“all appeors quiet,” and a fourth, in reply to the #. question,
“Are the lunatics quiet?”, writes, “Yes, they har.” These testimonies
appear satisfactory. Their orthography seems to show that they must
have been originally recorded in manuscript by inmates of the institution
to which they relate. Such, however, is not exactly the case. The
honour of their authorship is ascribed by the Lancet's Commissioner,
deputed to report on the state of Bermondsey, Workhouse, to certain
gentlemen, members of its Committee of Guardians.

THE LOVER'S REPROOF.
Captain Patcherly. “Stop, stop, CLARA I
Clara. “Not For THE WoRLD, DEAR 1
LET ME KNook THE LOOK orp. 1"
WAIT TILL I AM OVER 1"
A WEATHER EXCHANGE WANTED.
Of all topics for talk the weather is perhaps the most §enerally popu-
lar. After shaking hands, and saying “How d'ye do?” nine persons
out of ten say somewhat of the weather. Of course, they only tell you
what you knew quite well before, as that the day is very warm, or yery
wet, or rather chilly; but this fact never hinders them from .#
their remarks, which they usually put forth with all the air of thoroug
.# and as if they were announcing that which no one else by any
mental ingenuity could have possibly conceived.
If this be so in ordinary seasons, it is ten times more the case when
the weather is exceptional, and fairly may be made the subject of
remark. For instance, this year, there has been an uncommonly fine
summer, and, while it lasted, folks were never tired of talking of it.
There arose weather, prophets in nearly every street, and the news-
papers were filled with weatherwise predictions as to the expected dura-
Then when the rain came, people talked of it as
though it had been quite a new phenomenon, and worthy of especial
comment on their part. In fact, whenever we have gone into society of
theme for conversation, and have more than commonly been thrust into
our thoughts. And this has set us thinking that the weather might
quite properly be made a thing to bet upon; or, to use a phrase .
1Oll.
Men constantly are speculating as to whether rain or sunshine, heat or
cold, is coming; and they are continually writing to the newspapers to
say, what they predict. Now, why not let them have facilities for
backing their opinions, and for betting on the rise, and fall of the ba-
rometer, just as speculators do upon the rise and fall of consols, cotton,
railway shares, or tallow, or any other of the “things which are always
going up and down in the City,” as some young lady is reported to have
spoken of the Funds. Just as time bargains are common among specu-
lative men, why should not weather bargains be equally made popular?
Trusting in his weather wisdom, a man might, bet that the barometer
would rise within a week or month to any point that he might indicate:
and as opinions always differ, he would be pretty certain to find people
who would bet with him. Anybody now-a-days will speculate in any:
thing, if he only gets the chance; and atmospheric speculation ºù
be fill as substantial as many other kinds of speculation that exist.
In the interests of business, then, we hope to see a Weather Exchange
soon started in the City, and proper weather.brokers Fº to go
and buy or sell in it. The fact that there would actually be nothing to
be tangibly delivered in the way of goods or shares, need surely be no
hindrance, to the making of a weather bargain. When a time {...i.
is made, the stock is not delivered; and thousands of pounds monthly
are lost and won in betting upon cotton, corn, or tallow, without an
ounce of any of these articles really .# hands. "Thus a man
might, so to say, sell half an inch or more of mercury, and promise, to
deliver, it in the tube of a barometer, upon a certain day for settling
which the Weather Exchange should fix.
There would be, too, an advantage in thus wagering on the weather,
that men could not rig the market, as they can with corn or cotton, and
so cause an artificial elevation or depression in the tube. Moreover, as
the weather, at its best, is always variable, it constantly affords abund-
ant scope for speculation; and if an Exchange were established for the
business, a tribe of weather-jobbers would speedily arise, and specula-
. in the weather would soon become as general as speculation in the
unols,
Interesting Imports.
An Advertisement, issued by the proprietors of an establishment in
Berners Street, offers the British Public “Convertible Ottomans.”. It
must make the British Public sigh. Convertible Ottomans! Are they
not very dear? They are supposed to be very scarce. A t deal of
money is yearly subscribed to Missionary Societies, and how many
converted Turks have they to show for it?

BRITISH AND FOREIGN MAWWORMS.
THE Monde is a phoenix that has arisen out of the ashes of our old
friend the Univers. . What sort of a bird is this phoenix? We are
enabled by the Débats to answer this question. As a set-off against a
complaint, made by the Monde that cheap, publications, circulating
amongst the lower classes, tended to corrupt the minds of the people,
the leading French journal quotes the subjoined specimen of the litera-
ture of the party represented by the Ultramontane organ. It is taken
from a periodical called Les Petites Lectures, wherein it occurs amongst
the entries of a “Bulletin de la Semaine,” supposed to be the diary of
a young workman, in which he records what a British Methodist in the
parallel case would call his “experiences”:—
“Wednesday. An' hour of meditation, a rosary, an hour of silence, two blows
received from a workman, five Paters, five Aves, two Souvenez-vous. Thursday. At
my breakfast. I ate some dry bread as a mortification and a spiritual banquet; in
returning to my work I was caught in a shower, and I made an offering of the
wetting to the Holy Virgin. Friday. In the morning two hours of silence; in the
evening four hours, ad majorem Dei Gloriam. Saturday. I offered to God my work,
my burdens, my fatigues, my annoyances, my sufferings at the workshop, and a
kick given me by a workman.”
“Ay, do despise me; I likes to be despised,” says the Protestant
Mawicorm. Ultramontanism appears to have its Mawworm too. The
.."; workman who above describes himself as having got a kick which
e turned to pious account perhaps acknowledged that favour received
at the toe of his comrade by saying, “Ay, do kick me; I likes, to be
kicked.” . One who had never before happened to read the following
passage from a renowned narrative would think that it must have
related to this young workman:–
memorated as above in the Tale of a Tub, is represented by Swift, as
bearing in many respects a strong family resemblance to his brother
Peter. The resemblance still exists, and it is also shared by Stiggins,
and Chadband, and the rest. Have we no Saints P Plenty; such as
our sanctified friend the young French workman who drivels in his
“Bulletin de la Semaine.” Our saints are, as they profess to be, very
serious, but they must not fancy that those other saints are less serious
than themselves. What can be more serious, than the idea of making
an offering of a wetting or a kick, especially a kick; which, if it
were offered to you, you would return?
These considerations should teach us mutual charity and toleration.
But the question about the phoenix, Le Monde, remains to be answered.
What sort of a bird is it? The same as the pièce de résistance at the
Feast of ST, MICHAEL. The phoenix is a goose.
R. D. T.’s CONCERTS.
SEVERAL new performers are about to be added to the orchestra.

A WORD TO THE ORCHESTRAS.
UNLIKE the Christian Lorenzo, Mr. Punch is ever “merry when
he hears sweet music.” . But then, to make him merry, the music
must be sweet. Else it only makes him miserable, and irritates
his temper, and tempts him to repine that he was not born deat.
Now, the music at our theatres is usually execrable, and it is time
that public notice be taken of the fact....When Mr. Punch goes to the
play, he goes intending to be pleased with everything he hears; but the
pleasure the play gives him is neutralised well-nigh by the music that
attends it. To enjoy a play completely, one's hearing must be fresh,
and not wearied and worn out by the banging of a drum and the blaring
of a cornet. A few fiddles and a flute, with a clarinet or two, a good
French horn, and double bass, are quite enough to give sufficient music
for an entr’acte. What one wants, then, is some music gentle, delicate,
and light, to form an under-current, as it were, for conversation. At
the falling of the curtain, people mostly like to talk, and unless they be
born Stentors, they cannot easily converse amid the banging and the
bellowing of kettledrums and cornets. . It may be hinted that the
“gods” are partial to a row, and that noisy tunes are only played to
please the gallery. But the stalls and boxes surely have a right to be
consulted; and Mr. Punch feels pretty sure that they will side with
. in thinking that a side drum is a nuisance, and brass bellowers are
ores.
There may be playgoers whose ears are tough as those of a rhinoceros,
and capable of hearing any quantity of clamour; but there must be
others, also, whose hearing is more sensitive, and who, to listen through
a play, must not be worried in the entr'actes. Ears sometimes are so
wearied by the blaring of the band, that they have barely strength to
listen to the drama. If plays are to be published bound in brass and
calfskin—in cornopeans ; kettledrums—they really might almost as
well be plays without words; for after all the clanging and clamour of
|...", not one playgoer in ten can have his hearing left to listen
O Linem.
REFORM-PARLIAMENTARY AND PATAGONIAN.
THE present enormous demand, for giants is suggestive of some
serious reflections. It seems probable that our standard of human
excellence will soon be raised to an eight feet standard. We may then
expect to have manhood suffrage with a vengeance. The poor ten pound
householder will be swept away to make room for one of thirty stone;
Faggot votes of course will be abolished, and every elector be in himself
a plumper.
Further—with a gigantic constituency. what qualifications will be
required for a legislator! Who but a “second Daniel” can fairly
embody the principles of a Lambert? Then what will be the estimated
size of a House of Representatives? St. Stephen will shrink in dismay
when he sees a legislative body approaching for whom he has no ade-
uate accommodation. But when a Member who sits for (say) Great
armouth occupies a sensible space, will debates be confined within
their present almost unreportable limits? The elastic properties of
popular oratory are proverbial. With an enlarged rotunda, may we not
anticipate an aggravated ore rotundo? Would not an Irish Member
swell over six short hours with Erin's grief, and would a country gen-
tleman be content with an entire evening in spreading forth his burthens
on land P. We should like to see the franchise placed on a firm footing,
but we cannot consistently support one which fascinates many muscular
politicians because it is calculated to please the fancy.
In conclusion, we would ask, is EARL Russell, prepared to bring in
a Reform Bill on this bold basis—giving sympathetically a preponderance
of power to those who have the greatest weight, not in the social, but
ºlic scale, and is he strong enough to carry it * We pause for a
reply.

THE wonDERS OF THE TELEGRAPH.
HE Electric Telegraph is a
wonderful invention 1 See
here is a sample of the myriad
useful messages it flashes
from the farthest regions to
our very doors. We copy
it verbatim from the Times
of Wednesday, November
29, where any sceptical
reader may peruse it if he
pleases, under the heading—
“CHINA. By TELEGRAPH
FROM GALLE
“Question United States treaty
tim latms Pashiaky worse.”
ſº |

We wonder how many
pounds sterling the Times
was charged for the trans-
mission of this interesting
intelligence. We wonder,
too, how many of the
readers of the Times were
- - made the wiser by their read:
ing of the message thus transmitted. We wonder, also, if the “Pashiaky,”
whoever he may be, is any better now than when the message was sent
off. We wonder, moreover, that the workers of a telegraph should
take the trouble to transmit such gibberish by their wires, for of course
it could be easily concocted at the place where it is said to be received.
We wonder, likewise, if a jury would give a plaintiff any damages, sup-
posing he could prove that he in some way had been injured by the
garbling of a message in transmission by the telegraph. We wonder
in the next place, if the sender of a message could recover the sum paid
for it, in case of its being made completely unintelligible, either by im-
perfect transit through the wires, or by being pencilled in a hieroglyphic
scribble which nobody can decipher, as is commonly the case. We
wonder, too, that people should submit to pay for messages beforehand,
when so many are miscarried º or made illegible, and thereby
rendered useless by the time whent ey arrive. And, finally, we wonder
that any one should place the least reliance on a telegram, seeing that
for “East” is often substituted “West,” and that when MR. BRowN
at Beyrout, or MR. Jones at Jericho, telegraphs to Fleet Street, “Send
me three-and-twenty volumes of #. admirable Punch,” the message is
transmogrified into some such balderdash as, “Lend me tea in plenty
columns if you Admiral paunch!”
MORAL AMUSEMENT AT MANCHESTER.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
SIR,
THE highest enjoyment of the brute creation consists in the
fullest possible gratification of those instincts with which it has been
beneficently endowed by Nature. To promote the happiness of any of
the lower animals, the benevolent mind can pursue no course more
effectual than that of cultivating and developing their peculiar propen-
sities. Allow me, therefore, as an animal's sincere friend, to protest
against the mistaken kindness which impelled an officer of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Manchester the other day,
to put a stop to a most interesting canine contest which was going on
there at an establishment for the sale of beer in Tib Street. Assisted
by a party of policemen, this injudicious agent of an excellent association
not only terminated that exhibition of courage and endurance, but also
made a capture of all the spectators of the combat, and nine of the
combatants. The outrage thus perpetrated at the impulse of humane
but unenlightened sentiment is narrated in a newspaper paragraph,
under the heading of “A Raid on Manchester Dog Fighters,” in such
terms as to º it in the light of a triumphant exploit. With
reference to the author of this achievement, we are informed, in an
evident spirit of exultation, that:— I
“He got the assistance of about twenty or thirty policemen belonging to the
A division, who surrounded the house. The officer got admission to the room where
the fighting was going on, and at a preconcerted signal, the police poured into the
building, and secured every dog-fighter present. Twenty-five men were locked up
at the Swan Street police station, and nine dogs were taken to the old cells at the
Town Hall in King Street.”
The reporter adds:—“The dog-fighters were admitted to bail.” I
suppose the dogs remained locked up. Poor captives! How much
more pleasant a night they would have spent in the arena, enjoying the
mutual exercise of their natural combativeness! Like a loving voice
from a far-off happy land, a recollection of infancy, the preceptive muse
of the amiable DR, WATTs bids us—
“Let dogs delight to bark and bite.”
How erroneous then is the idea of forbidding dogs to delight in
barking and biting. Yet in direct violation of the rule prescribed by
the little nightingale of Southampton, the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals (with the best intentions) does all it can to deprive
poor dogs ºf the delight which they feel in fighting. That the members
of that well-meaning association are actuated by the most praiseworthy
motives I fully admit, but would affectionately suggest to them that
their zeal is not according to knowledge of the canine species. Do
cannot be forced to fight; they do so of their own accord; simply
because:-
“It is their nature to,”
as the divine bard above-quoted further sings. The prevention of a
dog-fight not only debars dogs of the pleasure attendant on indulgence of
pugnacity, but also robs sympathising spectators of the gratification
derived from the spectacle of animals innocently enjoying themselves.
I have ventured, Sir, to submit the foregoing observations to you,
because the interests of the canine fancy, like those of the pugilistic
ring, and I might almost say the swell mob, regarded from a philo-
sophical standpoint and with a moral purpose, are identical with those of
general civilisation, refinement, an Fº onward and upward,
whose watchword is the unceasing cry of their ever consistent advocate
ExCELSIOR.

THE TOLERATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
ALLIANCE.
A MonstER puff, put forth by the United Kingdom Alliance for the
enactment of a Maine Law, one day last week, occupied a whole page
in the Times. The above-named compulsory Total Abstinence Associa.
tion had shortly before held a meeting at Manchester. The impunity
with which the agitation of this body of busybodies, with SIR W. TRE-
VELYAN at their i. is carried on, is a gratifying evidence of modern
toleration. There was a time when the British Public would have
broken the windows of their place of assembly, pelted their members
with stones, and put some of those meddlesome gentlemen under that
pump to which they want to chain everybody else along with them-
selves. These outrages would have made such gentlemen as SIR W.
TREVELYAN and MR. SAMUEL Pope martyrs and confessors, and thus
would have conduced to the triumph of their conspiracy against the
liberty of the subject. Irritating, offensive, and disgusting as is the
attempt of a would-be democracy of imbecile prigs to get us to have
our hands tied and ourselves put into leading-strings, it is ridiculous,
and ridiculous chiefly. . The price of a Permissive Prohibitory Law, to
destroy the Liquor Trade and the revenue thence derived, would be an
increase of the Income-Tax. ... Still, it would be unwise, as well as
cruel, to persecute the fanatics engaged in a crusade against the
freedom of the public and the public-house.

FRIGHTFUL DISCOVERY.
We thought that the Tories, like the wolves, were extinct—not that
any great price would be set, by an economist, on the heads of the
former. But it seems that we were in error. The eminent naturalist,
MR. BRIGHT, has discovered that the species is still in existence, and
raging. He declares that there are thousands of Tories rampaging
about England (and at their leisure electing nearly half the House of
j who are hungering and thirsting to undo all the good that
has been done for the last seventy years. They are sworn and vowed
§ achieve certain horrible things, which he enumerates. They are
these-
To re-enact the Test and Corporation Acts, so that every Dissenter
may be turned out of every place of profit. ..
o repeal the Roman Catholic Emancipation Act. - - -
A To repeal the Reform Act, the Corporations Act, and the Navigation
cts. -
To re-impose the Corn Laws, the Sugar Duties, the Newspaper Tax,
and the Paper Duty. -
To abolish the system of National Education.
To do away with the New Tariff.
To repudiate the French Treaty, and
To make Church Rates and the Irish Church Eternal Institutions.
This is truly awful....We did not know it. As we said, we thought
that the old original Tory was extinct, and we did not believe that
there existed in England so great a Fool as the man must be who
entertains any one single object above stated. If we knew the man,
we would burst upon him in thunder and lightning. But we do not.
Can it be that. MR. BRIGHT has been once more calumniating a large
body of his fellow-countrymen, merely because they do not agree with
him " This is again an awful supposition—but is it quite without
warrant in precedent?

THERE is a good thing in the Follet of this month. Does dearest
ANNIE read the Fallet? I think not., Perhaps she would not consider
it a publication calculated to improve her mind.
However, the present number of Le Follet contains the description
of a contrivance by which a lady who is ...”.” disposed may
re-adapt for wear a dress that the increasing length of trains has
compelled her to lay by. Wery good advice, certainly; but ANNIE,
love, what lady who is, economically disposed, would ever think, of
laying a dress by merely because it was a little short of the fashionable
length behind?
After we are married, when ANNIE’s old uncle has left us all his
money, then ANNIE will be able to follow the fashions without regard
to expense. But, till then, we must save as much as ever we can in
dress, so as not to be obliged to deny ourselves better things. In the
mean time, dearest ANNIE, I am sure, will be much too economical to
leave off any dress that perhaps would last her several years longer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
punth's Cable-Calh,
161.
Dinidium fact, qui capit habet. Untrue at dinner time, my dear boys,
at all events. I have partaken of two dishes, but I see seven more on
the carte, all of which I mean to taste. Two is not the half of nine, I
respectfully submit.
162.
A man who talks of things being permitted to a layman, which would
be sins in a clerical man, talks—well, let me quote “the fiery.TER-
TULLIAN” unto him. Wani erimus si putaperimus id quod, clericis non
licet laicis licere. You should read the Fathers occasionally—notably,
when you cannot get to sleep in any other way.
163.
I own that an elegantly garbed audience makes a theatre pleasant.
But, O my brethren, the bore of dressing ! That infliction keeps me
from many a performance. Our rules, however, have relaxed much.
“Regulations as to costume are not enforced,” even at the Opera,
during the off-season. In the days when the upper classes were regular
playgoers, the rules were severe. I remember a song, once very famous,
“...A clerk I was in London gay,
O Jemmy linkum feedle I
And went in boots to see the play.”
This, the dashing young man considered a greatjpiece of free-and-
easyism. By the way, he proceeds–
“I marched the lobby, twirled mystick,
The ladies cried, “He’s quite The Kick."
Not a bad slang name that. If the thief class would revive it, the term
would soon be a household word in gay and festive scenes and halls of
dazzling light. 164
. CAPTAIN RICHARD BURTON.—good luck to him and his, wherever he
is-gives capital illustrations of Oriental nature. In the Mecca book
he speaks of the way in which an Arab of a particular district, when he
is in a mad rage with one of another locality, shrieks out his insultin
vaunts. It is as if a Londoner, savage with a Yorkshireman, shoul
scream forth, with oaths, “I have smacked, the face of every man,
woman, and child in York, Scarborough, Sheffield, Leeds, and Bradford,
I have.” Only a little stronger.
165.
Nobody who dislikes children can ever humbug them into liking him.
How much wiser they are than grown people. Poppins—you know
whom I mean-adores me, yet I think I may say that I hate him. In proof,
I cut up his book in the Spectator, got SIR EPICURE MAMMON to omit
him from his turtle feast, and persuaded his wife not to go home to her
º But you should see the sweet smile and earnest hand-shake
give nim.
6.
Avoid hypocrisy, my dear boys, in all its moods and tenses. If you
think a man is a fool, tell him so, unless he is bigger than yourself.
Then, I think you are justified in telling him that everybody else thinks
him a fool, but that you don’t. He can hardly hit vou for that.
167.
The American phrase, “the almighty dollar,” is vulgar and not
strictly reverent. There is a better in our friend ARistophanes,
“What a mighty power have everywhere The Two Obols.” Bring the
words into fashion. 168
RossINI calls the brass instruments in the orchestra the kitchen
utensils. They have cooked the goose of a good many good voices.
169.
CoRNELIUS KILIANUs should be held in honour by my invaluable
friend known, in the printing-office as the Reader. He corrected the
press admirably for fifty years, but he also, in an epigram of eighteen
verses, vindicated the Correctors against the Authors, “who,” he says,
“making mistakes for want of learning and judgment, and giving
incorrect, copies, do nevertheless blame the innocent. Reader of the
printing.” He died on Easter Day, 1607.
170.
*The above CoRNELIUs uses the word “copies.” Thence our word
copy—known unpleasantly, to some of you idle or procrastinating
bloaters. Do you see what the word implies That a printer had—
and ought to have-a fair copy or transcript of your original MS., and
not to have his soul vexed by your scribble, interlineations, balloons, and
carets. Mrs. Quickly says that caret is a geod root, but the printers
kind of rubbish we find in The Authorities. Was What-d'ye-call-him
so wrong in burning the What's-it's-name library?
172.
You may not perceive the exquisitely subtle current of thought that
connects the last remark with that which is coming, but I would rather
have written the hºater Babies than any book of the last fifty years.
173.
I know of no earthly responsibility so great as that of the writer of a
child’s book—I mean, of course, of a book not meant to be mere non-
Sense.
174.
I was telling an American of somebody we both knew and disliked,
and who had bumptiously said that he was so prosperous in all things
that like the Ancient, he sometimes needed to be reminded that he
was mortal. “Guess killing him wouldn't be a bad hint to that effect,”
said my friend, quietly.
175.
The great May * for trout is the Alder Fly. Some call it the Orl
fly, and in Wales I know they name it the Hump-back. It comes
about the end of May, and stays till the end of June. I have done
awful execution with it in the rivers in Hampshire. Mind, it’s not the
Marlow Buzz, though very like it. - 1 have won bets on the point.
176.
Bar two—there are not many of our theatrical critics who would not
be the better for studying The Critic. MR. PUFF's wit seems lost
upon most of them. MRs. JoBDAN and MRs. NISBETT never had half
the adulation which is regularly bestowed upon pert creatures who
succeed by sauciness, legs, and music-hall melodies. But, as LoRD
ByRon writ,
“‘Wilkes,' said the Devil, “I understand all this.”
and if the public understood it, there would be no unfairness to real
artists. No claque in London! Ha! hal The London claque writes.
177.
You remember, of course—that is, I’ll take six to two you don't-
MooRE's epigram on a certain family, formerly famous for getting all
sorts of good things:–
“‘I want the Court Guide,’ says my lady, “to look
If the house, Seymour Place, is at 30 or 20.”
‘We’ve lost the Court Guide, M'm, but here's the Red Book,
Where you'll find, I've no doubt, Seymour places in plenty.’”
Very good, but I didn't quote it so much for its own sake, as to tell
you what occurred when the epigram was cited, in my hearing, in the
presenge of a dear good sweet awfully stupid woman. “Yes,” she said,
‘that is very good. ..It’s just like servants—first they lose your books
carelessly, and then they give you impudence.”
178.
Materiem superabat opus. I often think of this when I take up a
country newspaper, and see that highly trained and skilful gentlemen,
of the reporting staff, are set to take down verbatim the cackle of
grocers, cheesemongers, and tailors in Municipal Council assembled.
What would we not give for just one day of such a report of the pro-
ceedings on the Grand Remonstrance? And but for those and certain
cognate proceedings, little chance the grocers and so forth would have
had of saying their say in after times.
179.
Don't you think I am a Poet. Lor!
“Good is dinner a la Russe, ,
So is dinner a la Goose.”
180.
The only thing for which I am eager, just now, is Lord Rector
Thomas CARLYLE's inauguration speech. Able Editors will look out,
as it were, for no diminarticulate noises, but puncture of windbag.
181.
LoRD PALMERSTON, it seems, held the theory to which I was alluding
the other night, about LoRD BACON having been the author of the
plays attributed to one W. SHAkspeaRE. hen BEN Jonson's verses,
in laudation of W. S., were mentioned to the late Premier, he said,
“Oh, these fellows always stand up for one another. Besides, he may
have been deceived like the rest.”
182.
Argument is not exactly valueless if it ends by giving you some little
light upon a subject of which you knew ºlini when you began to
dogmatise. But it is none the less a nuisance. If a man differs from
me, I make up my private mind that he is an ass, and Lask him whether
he has heard L'Africaine. Moreover, errat qui putat, as the Catholics
do not agree with her. Do you apprehend me, gentlemen all and some P| hold
Especially some
171.
The Trent is so called, say the antiquarians, from thirty kinds of
fishes found therein, or for thirty streams that flow into it. That’s the
Old.
183.
LoRD Russel.L has told a deputation that he is favourable to Reform,
but that we ought not to legislate in the absence of exact information.
Some of you have been telling him what I said. & You did right.

ARGUMENT.-They have not met for three days, and there is some little coolness
between them. YoUNG GENTLEMAN has asked YoUNG LADY's hand for the
“Lancers,” in order that he may be able to explain why he has or hasn't, did or
didn't, &c., &c., and she has accepted that she may hear why he did or didn't, or
had or hadn't, &c., &c.

Young Gentleman (nervously, and feeling hot about the throat) to his
partner. It’s very kind of you to dance this quadrille with me. (Pause.
Young Lady gently inclines her head, and looks about to see where she can
deposit her fan. Young Gentleman takes advantage of this.) You want
to put your fan down. Let me!
Young Lady (finding that they are close to the mantel-piece). Oh, no!
this will do, thank you! (Band commences music to the Lancers.)
Young Gentleman (unpleasantly surprised). It’s the Lancers. I
thought it was a ºil;
Foung Lady (coldly). Perhaps you’d rather not dance the Lancers?
Foung Gentleman. Oh, no! (seeing that she misunderstands him). I
mean that I should like to dance the Lancers. (Thinks that he’ll add,
with tender emphasis, “with you.” Waits two seconds, considers, and
thinks that it wouldn't come in well now if he tried it: determines to leave
it alone; regrets that he has lost an opportunity: becomes hotter and more
nervous.)
Young Lady (giving him an opportunity). You seem rather dull this
evening.
Young Gentleman. No! (puzzled as to how he shall get at his explana-
tion about the matter nearest his heart)—I am (wants to say “never dull
when with you,” but thinks it would sound absurd)- I am--a (makes a
plunge)—I wanted to explain-
Young LADY suddenly turns to “set” to the next person:
Young Gentleman (inwardly anathematises the figure)... Oh, yes!

her hand, begs pardon for not being ready, turns her round, aud returns

and smiles at a female friend. - - -

to catch a glimpse of his nose in the glass; thinks he might look better.

[YouNG GENTLEMAN smiles as sweetly as he can, and anathematises
comic friend and the Lancers; thinks he'll do a comic step, tº
show that he can't; feels spooney; that he's making a fool of
himself; dances, crosses, balance: to his partner. She then has
her turn, and the figure ends.
FIGURE II.
Young Gentleman (buttoning his glove and becoming suddenly common-
place). I never can recollect the Lancers. (This is by way ºf an ercuse,
because he wants to watch the first couples and see what they do.)

You had better watch them.
[YouNG GENTLEMAN thinks he’ll say “AGNEs” in a plaintive tone,
but alters his mind and watches the figure. Double visiting done.
Gentlemen have to dance round by themselves. Funny vis-à-vis

friend, and pretends to enter into the joke, sees his partner
looking at him, thinks she’ll set him down as a humbug: hates

and becomes suddenly pleasant and sensible). Don't go out that way, or

arm. They descend. A retired corner is found, and no further
explanation required.]
WANTED.
Chorus of Mr. Punch's lady
correspondents has been
singing, “It is difficult to
et good, servants, now-a-
ays.” The hardship arises
from the impossibility, in
most cases, of the Lady of
the House adapting herself
to the peculiar disposition
of each one of her domes-
tics.
The following bond ſide ad-
vertisement s serve us
for a text:—
OMESTIC SERVANT.-
A Person about Twenty,
with excellent character, wishes
a SITUATION where not re-
stricted in becoming dress nor
services rendered unnecessarily
menial. She would prefer a small
Country Family Situation, away
from the noise and hurry of Bir-
mingham. Should her mistress
prove quiet and amiable, a suit-
- able, respectable, permanent ser-
want wouldinevitably be secured. Lowest wages accepted, tenguineas.
The Young Lady's grammar, in “wishing a situation,” is somewhat
arbitrary, but it is enough for her purpose that the reader should know
what she means. The restriction in becoming dress probably alludes
to the tyranny of a mistress who objected to her China ornaments
being knocked down by BETTY and housemaid’s extensive crinoline.
“Services rendered unnecessarily menial,” conveys the idea of the
wearer of a crinoline being obliged to clean the doorsteps; the attitude
necessitated º the nature of this operation being one of supplication
so humble, and prostration so abject, as would never be jº by any
Yearer of the steel hoops who “could see herself as others see her.”
The Young Lady would perhaps like to take her quiet tea and beauty
sleep in drawing-room, about four o'clock of an afternoon, talk over
family matters with her quiet and amiable mistress, or skim her a few
º of the Court Circular. We sincerely trust that the advertiser
obtained the situation she deserves.
TAKEN IN AND DONE FOR.
THERE is a converse to the proposition that many a true thing is
said in joke. For instance a contemporary, in an article on University
Extension at Oxford, observes:–
“The question then is, rather for each
College, how it can take in more men
than for the University, en,
how it can set up a new College.”
sº this remark to be true in the sense which its writer in-
tended, you will note that it is capable of bearing another construction.
With reference to the system of overcharging undergraduates for
bread-and-butter at Oxford, you will perhaps #. the question for
Christchurch and other Colleges just now...is not how they can take
in more men, but how they can get on without taking men in any
more.
THE WESTRIES CALL TO ARMS.
Minutes at a Special Meeting.
MR. CLERK, put it right! We appeals to the nation,
To guard us against that fiend, Centralisationſ
We’re Englishmen all, and Self-Government’s chief
Of the means what has brought furrin tyrants to grief.
But we hears of a rumour that's 'orridſ They say
The Board of Works plots our destruction with GREY.
We're Westrymen all, and we laughs at the Press
And the Public a-seekin’ what they calls redress.
Confound 'em a-pokin' and writin' and pryin'!—
Our rules and our customs and men a-decryin'!
We shall manage the paupers and streets as we chooses,
And laugh as we wins—let him holler as loses!

For wagabonds we ain't a goin' for to wittle—

NATIONAL COPYEIOLD.
Good news is rare. But here is an example, extracted from the
South London Chronicle, of that rarity:-
“A Bill upon Open Spaces has been draughted, and it will be introduced into
Parliament early in the Session of 1866, at the instance of the Commons Preservation
Society.”
Let us hope that the Bill upon Open Spaces will become an Act that
shall keep all open spaces which are beautiful, and cannot now be
legally enclosed without the sanction of Parliament, open for ever.
May that Act constitute all those spaces national freeholds. If, how-
ever, it only constitute them national copyholds, it will do well enough,
provided it secure the perpetual observance of the precept that may be
proposed for a copy-book text:—“Preserve Open Spaces.”

MIDDLE-CLASS EDUCATION.
MR. SWINDLE'S ONLY METHOD OF PREPARATION FOR THE CHRISTMAS ExAMINATION.
STRANGE CONDUCT OF SIR. A. COCKBURN.
... A RECENT trial has disclosed the fact, that when you buy silver plate,
if you wish that it should be all silver, you must see that it has the
London Hall Mark upon it, with the Leopard's Head, and not the
Sheffield Hall Mark, in which is also a Crown. For London will stamp
nothing that is not solid, whereas Sheffield allows the manufacturer to
fill * inside of his articles with sand, solder, MR. HADFIELD's
lead, MR. ROEBUCK's brass, or anything he pleases.
That, however, is a mere case of careat emptor, to which Mr. Punch,
as President of the Customers' Protection Society, incidentally calls
attention, himself expecting many F. this Christmas. But what
he chiefly desires to note was the extraordinary and unlawyerlike
conduct of the Lord Chief Justice in the trial alluded to. After much
wrangling and mystification, SIR ALEXANDER actually proposed—
“That one of the articles, a candlestick, about which question was raised, should
be broken, in order to see what the substance really was.”
A shudder went through the Court. , What?...Take the obvious
and direct way of ascertaining the truth, by the evidence of the senses |
Get at a fact in a straightforward fashion . The very rafters of the
Court must have groaned, like the enchantedl tree in the story. So
monstrous a, proposal we never heard of. If such innovations are
#.º. next? We shall actually have a cold-blooded suggestion
or abolishing the rules that at present happily prevent a question from
being put to the only person who can know anything about the matter
of which he is accused. Fortunately the Judge was checked in his
unrighteous attempt to get at the truth, “objections” being raised.
But we really think that the matter must not stophere. LoRD CHIEF
JUSTICE CockBURN is clearly not inspired with the spirit of law, and
we must insist on his taking his coronet and retiring from the headship
ºf a system not intended for such impatient investigators.
TO A CORRESPONDENT WHO WIRITES FROM HALLAMSHIRE.
You are right about the “ Statute of Anne,” but wrong in supposing
that the “Pilgrimage of Grace” was undertaken by a young lady of
the middle ages, with the Christian name you say you prefer.
OUR RAILWAY TYRANTS,
In the case of an assault by the Director of a Railway upon one of
its clerks, the Secretary of the Company the other day put forth his
“solemn opinion” that—
“A railway servant was bound to obey an individual Director in regard to any act
he might direct, evento the extent of compelling him to stop a train.”
If this be so, poor Jones, who lives a score of miles from London,
and daily travels by quick trains, is at the mercy of Directors who
happen by ill-chance to have their houses on the line between himself
and town. How jolly it must be for Jones, when coming hungry home
to dinner, to have his fast train stopped to set down a Director at some
paltry by-way station, where no one else gets out! No doubt, also, a
contrary command will be obeyed, and a Director may direct an engine-
driver not to stop, although a º: be distinctly announced in the
time-bills. Supposing a Director live a dozen miles from town, and be
rather late for dinner, perhaps he will desire the driver not to stop
until that distance be accomplished. We think that if this privilege be
generally acted on, the time-bills should announce that they may be
depended on, “provided no, Director give a contrary command.” In-
deed, people would do well, before paying for their ticket, to ask if a
Director be travelling by the train; and if so, they would do wisely to
defer their journey until the next day.
A Caution in Black and White.
To be on our guard let’s agree,
Against all that may help turn the cry

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WONDERFUL SHILLINGSWORTH !
IMonio, a young friend of mine, fresh from
the country, implored me, the other evenlng,
to take him to the Polytechnic. , Moved
by his entreaties, and influenced by the
fact that the cost of the entire entertain-
ment was only one shilling a head, I
ielded. We arrived punctually at seven,
jº my young friend wished to see the
“Machinery in Motion.” It was in motion,
too, with a vengeance : not a wheel in the
place but was whirring round and round;
gyroscopes were turning about like me-
chanical JIM CRows in one corner; pistons
were in full swing in another; valves were
opening and shutting ; electrical eels
wriggling; electrical wires entangling one
another; straps going round wheels and
wheels going round straps;... something
running up and down an inclined plane;
water plashing in the distance: spinning-
aroxysm of scientific joy over a hot gas-
É. a stick of sealing-wax, and a knife-
grinding machine; refreshmentstall-keepers
arranging and re-arranging scientific sponge
cakes and boxes of scientific acidulated
drops; shop-keepers talking like lecturers
to anybody who would listen, and selling
their wares with persuasive scientific
º eloquence; visitors, moving about on the
ground-floor, and in the gallery above; civil officials in livery, with a
strong family likeness to one another, running up and down stairs for no
apparent reason, except that the machinery is in motion and they can't
stand still; such a whizzing, whirring, grinding, spinning, fizzing, and
burring that one is glad to hide among the tranquil, joys of the Cosmo-
ramic views, which bear a close affinity to the peepshow of earlier years,
only without the showman to pull a string on the payment, of one
penny. * sorry to observe, that, in these times of peace, the Poly-
W -

leading to Diving Bell Bay at the end of the Hall, had º The
Diver, too, was gone; his helmet is reverentially preserved in a corner
of the building. I told my young friend what a man he was, and with
what a thrill of pleasure I had often witnessed the blowing up of the
Royal George in those dark green waters. Suddenly the machinery
stopped. There was an attraction somewhere; we heard the voice of
a syren, and saw a crowd gathering below. From our front seats in
the gallery we beheld a stout, amiable, lecturer standing at a counter.
For him even the glass-blower rested, on his wheel, reluctantly quiet,
but not one bit attentive, as we saw him dispose of six pieces of silky
glass, twopence a skein, while his scientific rival, the stout lecturer, was
trying to get up some excitement about a thermal battery. We heard
him indistinctly, from our gallery.
The Lecturer (standing behind a counter, whereon is placed an—appa-

glancing negligently about him with an engaging air ºf superiority, intended
to impress the audience with the notion that he's not obliged to do this sort
of thing, and could show them something better if he liked.) Theoph Ras-

A gong now summoned us to the Theatre, a large room, connected in
my mind with early recollections of glass jars, sparks, lectures on
chemistry, and a model steam engine. Here we were to be treated to a
concert. Four dining-room chairs were placed on a stage in front of a
large dissolving view cloth. . Four nice young, gentlemen, generally
supposed to be lecturers of the establishment, in evening dress,
with papers in their hands, entered, stood in a row, and bowed to the
audience. After putting their heads together, to settle upon their
starting note, they began a quartette. It was very well executed. The
vocalists were unaccompanied, except by an undiscoverable boy who
played a popgun when any opportunity occurred, and made the
officials highly wrathful and indignant.

The Concert was perhaps slightly monotonous, as, with the excep-
tion of a lady who really played with great faste, and feeling on A
violin, it consisted of the four young º: on and
going off, or for the sake of variety, not going off, but, sitting on the
four chairs as if they were going to give Nigger entertainments, but
ºf their minds and rising to sing another quartette. After
they had disappeared behind the dissolving view curtain for the fifth
time. (I think it was the fifth) one of the party returned, and said
kindly to the audience, “Ladies and gentlemen, it has struck us that
the programme wants a little variety, %. from some one, probably
undiscoverable boy with pop-gun,) and that—in fact (depreciates the
quartettes)—you would like something humorous. MR. MUDDIck will
sing you a, a, a-(considers, and finally pipes his own opinion of MR.
Muddick's song) a rather humorous song.” (Faint applause: he bows
and retires.)
Enter MR. MUDDICK, who turns out to be the basso in the recent quartette.
He looks as humorous as he can, and commences his song.
The audience evidently agreed with the gentleman who had described
the song as rather humorous. The singer laughed once, either at
his own, fun, or (for I’m sure he had a sly, sense of humour), at the
notion of there being any fun in it at all; and somebody, who had paid
an extra sixpence for a reserved seat, was as much amused as was my
young friend, to whom the venerable jokes were entirely new. . The
rather humorous song, which had one short verse, all the rest being
imaginary dialogue (it was one of the elder MAthews's, and, in its
day, excellent), was over in something under ten minutes, and the
audience would have left if they had not been fiercely ordered by the
official to keep their seats. Everybody expected dissolving views, and
two French gentlemen, who, up to this point, had visited the Polytechnic
under the impression that it was The Literary and Scientific Institution
of England, and had taken the comic dialogue as the lecture of
some learned professor, began to think they’d made a mistake. How-
ever, the four gentlemen reappeared, and, after another quartette, of
a mildly suggestive tone, about “Kiss me to-morrow and Love me
to-day,” the audience were allowed to quit their seats. On returning
to the Hall, we found the machinery in motion, the Glass-blower at it
again as energetically as ever, and two officials unbending their
dignity and weighing one another on a machine in a corner.
After a short interval a gong summoned us once more to the theatre.
Three musicians were there, and played a waltz. Then from a side door
emerged our friend the Lecturer, looking just as stout and amiable as
ever, only without his thermal battery. He was much applauded,
under the idea, suggested by the music, that he was going to dance.
He wasn't, however; but came to show an ingenious optical illusion
called Proteus, which consisted in putting a feeble old person called The
Curator (a dignity under the Roman Republic, some one said) into a
closet, where he got behind a looking-glass, and pretended to disappear.
The Curator was a weak yielding creature, evidently standing in much

awe of his tormentor, and the performance pleased him, even more
than it delighted the audience, who, having seen him once, didn't
care whether he ever came out of the cupboard again or not. After this
the Lecturer, who seemed to have a partiality for Pharaoh's serpents,
turned the gas down, and exhibited one by way of a dissolving view.
Then, the gas, being turned lower down, our versatile friend gave
us a sort of ghost-story about a poor author, who saw a spirit,
made a compact, had a dream, was shot by Cupid, visited º Venus,
and finally discovered that his good genius was his old landlady,
represented by (I ſancy) the Curator in a big cap and an old-
fashioned gown. The lights were then turned on, and we were turned
Out.
That the Polytechnic has not lost any of its attractions I judge from
the unanimous applause at the end of the performances, and the desire
expressed by my fresh young friend to linger yet a little while among
those scientific walls, even though the lights were out, the machinery
motionless, the Glass-blower at supper, and the amiable unwearied
Lecturer dreaming of future optical illusions that shall, astonish even
Professor PEPPER. My young friend subsequently discovered that
there was a daily change in the programme, and announced his inten-
tion while at supper, which was the crowning point of my treat, of
saving up his Christmas boxes in order to visit the Institution regularly,
discover Proteus, buy a Thermal Battery, learn how to do the Glºst
Illusion, and be introduced to the amiable Stout Lecturer in private life.
REAb ME ARIGHT. .
As a consequence of the increasing demand for amusements, a pro-
portionate supply of entertainments, more or less dramatic in charac-
ter, has been given to the public during the last few years. Of such
entertainments as do not mainly depend for their popularity upon the
harmonies of costume, scenic effect, and dramatic action, that class
known as “Readings” has gained most favour.
Novelists read their works aloud to ladies and gentlemen who pay
to see the Live Lion playing with his' own tale. In the course of
time, when other excitements fail, we shall hear of some eminent physi-
cian reading his own prescriptions aloud to a crowded audience, who
will afterwards witness with delight the comfortable spectacle of the
doctor swallowing his own draughts. It will be time enough to deal
with such a case when it arises: at present our object is to assist, as
far as in our power lies, those gentlemen who go hither, and thither
giving “Readings.” In the first place, we must observe, that we never
et have heard a reading that was perfectly satisfactory to ourselves.
here was either a lack, or a superfluity, of action; the gestures were ill-
timed; there was an inability on the part of the agent to mesmerise his
audience into a sympathetic state, or else, it appeared that one of us, we
or he, had º, misconceived the author's meaning; and this feeling
was strongest in us when we once chanced to hear an author represent-
ing his own characters himself. Let us, ear. gr., suppose that some
well-known personage is going to read, say at PERKINs's Paddington
Green Assembly Rooms, MACAULAY's Battle of the Lake Regillus ; we
will give him a few friendly hints, which may serve the turn of some
other notable entertainer in this peculiar line.
Preliminary Remarks.--Turn over a few pages of your book uncon-
cernedly, as if }. reading was quite an unpremeditated affair, and
only arose out of your happening to find yourself, accidentally, on a plat-
form, with a lot of people seated in front of it. Let it appear as though
you haven't in fact yet made up your mind as to what you are going to
treat them. This unconsciousness of the presence of an audience is
the art of arts. Do not omit a slight cough, nor the elegant applica-
tion to the lips of a clean white pockethandkerchief. Easily, howbeit
not defiantly, take the opened book in your left hand, keeping your
lace marked with your thumb and little finger within, and supported
y the three fingers without. Smile at your audience gently, in order
to show that no ill-feeling prompts you to this display. ANow begin:—
“Ho, trumpets, sound a war-note "
Put the corner of your book up to your mouth, like a horn. Imitate
the movement of performing on it with the other hand. Do not forget
to distend your cheeks as if with powerful blowing. Remember, what-
ever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
“Ho, Lictors, clear the way!"
Hit out with your book left and right, as if at a crowd. Place your
arms as if holding the fasces: this weapon was used much in the same
way that Mr. Punch, in the peripatetic tragedy, uses his stick. Kick,
struggle, and finally strike an attitude as though having triumphed,
$º still ºaking for the civil power, told the Civis Romanus to
owe on .
“The Knights will ride, in all their pride,
Along the streets to-day."
Divide this line judiciously and dramatically: 1st, “The knights; ”
2nd, “will” (i.e., insist upon); 3rd, “ride.” .
1st, Stand upright, as if shouldering arms; look warlike. This is
the idea of “ Knights.”
2nd. Scowl, to convey the notion of their unalterable determination,
3rd. “Ride:” amble round the platform, pretend to whip your steed;
frown as if on small boys telling you to get inside, and so forth.
Perhaps the piano might be introduced here, with the overture to the
Bronze Horse.
“In all their pride.” Sneer, and cast side-glances contemptuously at
the audience.
“Along the streets.” Frown at little boys, as before; look up at
windows where ladies may be supposed to be seated; give money to
beggars; ask some one (in pantomime) to hold your horse while you
lengthen yºur stirrup; pretend to brush mud off your coat; look up-
wards, as if you were in doubt as to the weather; shade your eyes, to
give the idea that it's a fine day after all; and do anything else that
may suggest itself to you as being appropriate.
44. From these hints the reader, may gather what our notion of , a
jºins ” is; and let him develop them, and make it what it ought
e.*. -- - -
“ Unto the Great Twin Brethren,
We keep this solemn feast "
Here is an opportunity for advertising Chang and ANAK, for which
the Giants ought to give you a gigantic sum. Keep your eyes open.
- “They came o'er wild Parthenius."
Throw" §: about: it oughtn't to have been cut for at least
two months before this."
- “From where with flutes and dances,”
Imitate flute; and dance.
Stanza iii, line 17-" How wolves came with fierce gallop,
And crows on eager wings.”
Get under the table, gnash your teeth, growl, and pretend to be a
wolf coming out of his lair. Then, for the second line, flap your arms
against your sides, and hop about. The audience will, say, “That's a
crow, he’s doing now!” and even deaf people may be interested in
your entertainment."
Stanza xxxvi. 3.-Here is one point that must not be lost :-
“The kites knew well the long stern swell.”
The “long stern swell” is Aulus, of course, when mounted on black
Auster. You will be in your most fashionable evening dress: if not
tall, get on a stool, or two stools concealed behind the table. Assume
a stern bearing, and the picture is complete.
Whenever a Public Reader announces that he has adopted our
suggestions, we shall be delighted to patronise him.
ALLIANCE JOINT STOCK.
MR. PUNCH,
Money is a great moral power in these days. The United
Kingdom Alliance advertises a capitul of £50,000. The theory of this
pecuniary demonstration apparently supposes that an overwhelmin
sense of awe must silence all opposition to a League whose politic
and social ſorce is represented by all that money. We are to suppose,
Sir, that the Alliance is resolved on spending £50,000 to have its way,
and get a Permissive Prohibitory Bill to shut up the public-houses,
destroy the liquor trade, and annihilate a branch of the revenue which
must be made up for by an increased Income-Tax.
The Alliance shakes £50,000 in our faces. But we don't hear the
money jingle. We don’t see the colour of it. ... We see it only in a
"..."; subscription list. How much of the £50,000 capital of the
nited Kingdom Alliance is paid up !
The name of SiR WALTER TREvely AN, President of the Alliance, is
down for £3,000; that of MR. BeNJAMIN Whitworth, M.P., for ditto;
SIR WILFRID LAwson's for £2500 Other gentlemen stand pledged in
sums of £2 000 and downwards. Well, Mr. Punch, surely there is
something respectable in the earnestness that is prepared to sacrifice
so much as £3,000 or even as £300, in order to withhold the means of
tippling from the working classes. But how many of the subscribers
on paper would give five shillings towards it in hard cash P To what
amount will the United Kingdom Alliance make any call upon their
subscribers ? Whatever the sum may be, don't they wish they may
get it as sincerely as your old friend, John BARLEYCORN ?

DISTRESSING DILEMMA FOR OUR YOUNG BACHELOR SURGEON 1
WAIT-AND HEAR.
AGAIN, Mr. Punch, in the interest of the respectable portion of the
community, protests against the way in which MR. BRIGHT's organ and
MR. BRIGHT's parasites are treating the Jamaica business. That in such
quarters the question should be prejudged in the vulgarest manner, and
that a torrent of mingled sanctimonious and slangy abuse should be let
loose upon the white population of Jamaica was so much in accordance
with the antecedents of the accusers that it could excite little surprise.
That Miss EYBE's spirited and sisterly appeal on behalf of an absent
and distinguished brother should be put into small type, while the
letters of excited and rampant fanatics, and their ridiculous verses,
should be accorded all the honours of prominence, was merely so much
more provincialism and bad taste, and that the sister should be dis-
missed with a sneer proved, very needlessly, that the Morning Star is
not the representative of English gentlemen. But we must seriously
state that the new tone which the Star has taken up is too offensive to
be tolerated. . It is being “funny” on the executions of the rebels in
Jamaica. It inserts a mass of #. clumsiest irony, in which the autho-
rities, are charged, in a comic strain, with wanting to thin off the
º and the changes are rung on the over-stocking of the island,
and the advantage of “popping down” the surplus negroes. This is
meant for satire, but English instincts revolt at merriment over such
subjects, and a protest against such fanatical buffoonery is due to
Christians and gentlemen.
We are not disposed to blame the tactics of the º which is using
the Jamaica incidents for its own purposes. The fullest inquiry into the
whole subject is required by the country, and promised by the Prime
Minister. It is impossible to predict the result. It may be that a
Governor of first-rate character, all his advisers, the members of both
Houses of Parliament (who have thanked him, and increased his
powers), and the Jamaica press, may all have gone mad, and have per-
petrated wholesale massacre in a dastardly panic. It may also be that
the seeds of sedition have been sown by the emissaries of religionists at
home, and that instead of confining themselves to their tolerated work
of propagating Calvinism, these emissaries have been imbuing the
minds of demi-savages with belief hostile to white supremacy. It may
be that the home organisation which has supplied these persons with
money and encouragement has been involved in the culpability, and
that instead of Governor EYRE and his Staff being “tried,” as is so
loudly menaced, that investigation may be applied in the case of a
sectarian association in England. Again, it is possible that GoRDON
may have been a “martyr,” or he may (as stated by a missionary in the
Scotsman) have been endeavouring to revolutionise the island and
aggrandise himself. , But we have no real knowledge on the subject
and for real knowledge England will wait. The not disinterested
efforts of a section, ...; the foolish clamour of excited fanaticism, will
not induce the people to prejudge the case; and it is not to the credit of
a portion of the press that it departs from its legitimate province, and
hounds on the unthinking. But the British public is not to be hum-
bugged, by cant, or led astray by prejudice. . Punch, claims the right,
sparingly as he uses it, to be serious on occasions, and he exercises that
right for the purpose of assuring all F. that society retains its
judicial attitude, despite the bellowing of the bulls of Bashan.
A HOT SUPPER.
THE following couplet in the English version of Le Domino Noir, now
running at Covent Garden, is surely under some strange mistake,
ascribed by a dramatic critic in a daily paper to the pen of MR. HENRY
F. CHORLEY!
“Come enjoy with me, my charmer,
Good warm fire, and supper warmer."
A supper, to be warmer than a good warm fire, must be a very warm
supper indeed. Such a supper could consist only of something devilled,
and devilled in a high degree; but what esculent substance would
stand the devilling which would render it a hotter supper than a red-
hot poker?
AVE YOU SEEN THE MERMAIDS –Doubtless there are many
º: in the world who have never seen a mermaid, and some of them may
possibly entertain a doubt if mermaidens exist. If so, by all means let them pur-
chase Punch's Almanack; wherein, among a million of other artistic marvels, they
will discover some life-portraits of these beautiful sea-creatures, and will observe
some very startling revelations of their habits, in a drawing that displays a myriad
of the most wondrous of the wonders of the deep.

In the first Court-scene in the Prince of Denmark, the mother of
Hamlet makes some remonstrance touching his dress. There is a beau-
tiful touch, overlooked by the commentators, of course, in the expres-
sion of his willingness to be obedient:—
“I shall, in all my best, obey you, Madam."
Mºf you perceive, in all his best clothes. A Hamlet who un-
derstood his author would appear, on the next occasion, in the most
splendid Danish costume, in fact as “the glass of fashion.”
185.
A bore, who had been looking at the beautiful things at South Ken-
sington (all of you go and see them) was cleverly stopped in his
subsequent meanderings on the subject. , A. lady on whom he was

“With him the fair, enamoured of a rattle,

187.
Oysters are first spawn, then spat, then brood, then ware, and then,
in the fourth year, oysters. They breed in salt water, on a clean
bottom, they fatten in brackish water, on a muddy bottom, they leave
the breeding-beds at two years old, and remain in the fattening-beds
from one to two years. Breeding-oysters do not fatten—fattening-
oysters do not breed. And our natural beds are nearly exhausted. I
am informed of these facts by the Prospectus of a new Oyster Company,
to which I wish all success. The Member for LYNN should be their
Chairman, and they should have a dinner on PYM's birthday, and their
bye-laws should be called RULEs. How blest are we that are not
simple men!
188.
PROFEssoR RoweR has announced the discovery of a fossil spider,
which resembles the recent genus Lycosa, in the coal mountains of
Upper Silesia. The interest of this discovery lies in the fact that
hitherto spiders have not been known from any rocks older than the
Jurassic, and that now the existence of them in the Palaeozoic period is
roved. . Here is a scrap for LoRD SHAFTESBURY's new Anti-Geological
ociety for promoting Judaism among the Christians.

Bullingham House, and is a ladies' school, and is not going to be pulled

there.

The Sovereign of Spain had—perhaps has-the right of conferring
upon black subjects all the distinctions belonging to white lieges. The
decree was Que se tenga por blanco—that he be deemed white. Cannot
PRESIDENT Johnson assume this power, and so cut several knots?
191.
DR. Johnson was a great man. But I am a greater. I should like
to know what SAMUEL would have said to an unhappy poet who had
made the following bull:—
“Turn from the glittering bribe thy scornful eye,
Nor sell for gold what gold could never buy."
It is in his London.
192.
Hand me down that Chronology... I marked something. Yes, here
it is. 1760, about a century ago—listen, “At Jamaica, a rebellion of
negroes broke out with great fury. They murdered MR. SMITH, the
overseer, who was at supper with his family. The insurrection was to
be general, and the plan appeared to have been a complete massacre
of all the whites. Some of the negroes, however, being intoxicated,
the design was happily revealed.” And so the world goes round.
193.
You never have headaches after my wine. But should you be
troubled with such things, hear the counsel of my friend DR. CAMERON
...; of India. Wet the head with cold water, and then pour
about a table-spoonful (this is a table-spoon, not that, you owl) of nitric
ether on the head, rubbing the hair round and round with the other
hand. Mind your eyes, of course. Evaporation makes the heat latent,
or in other words, produces cold... The cure is sometimes effected in a
very few minutes. Any ether will do. But I do not tell you this to
encourage you in taking too much liquor. Three glasses of sherry, two
of hock, six of champagne, Cognac, and a bottle or so of claret is enough
for any man, unless he is much depressed...

In Russia I remember, with pleasure, a very pretty custom of hospi-

Hobbes said that if he had bestowed as much time on reading as

neither he nor I would altogether discourage the practice of reading

I once came upon a media val schoolmaster's epitaph on himself. I
think it was HARTUNgus. The lines were in Greek, which I omit, for
reasons, but the meaning was this—and pathetic:—
“In teaching youth I learned and suffered much:
But now I rest in quiet, with my Maker.” "

A Sister of Charity in Paris has been educating children by taking
hold of their noses with hot tongs. The Society of S. Vincent de
Paul has been trying to keep the affair quiet, but the police are
dealing with MADEMOISELLE St. DUNstan.
198.
. Some months ago a man who had some humour in him put an adver-
tisement in the Times, saying to cabmen that an umbrella, left in a cab
taken, to Lower Eaton Street from the Strand, was anxiously ex-
pected at an address, given, where a reward and the blessings of the
owner awaited the honest restorer. The advertiser appealed to the
cabman, with whom a friend sat upon the box, to reflect and to re-
present to his friend how great a comfort is an easy conscience. I
should like to know whether the umbrella came back. Circulate the
anecdote at your Clubs. -
199.
I love and honour DR. NoFMAN MacLeod too much to say anythin
that would give fools and knaves an excuse for reviling him as a frien
of mine. Therefore I denounce him as an innovator, a profane per-
son, and a Sawbath-breaker, and I declare my full belief in the
revolting story told against him, namely, that several years ago,
walking in a garden, on a Sunday, he whistled to a bird.
200.
Anybody want a couplet for a burlesque? Here he is.
“Flatterers we are not, everybody grants,
Although at Christmas we grow sick-of-aunts.”
Sycophants—don't you see? Ha! haſ and a growl from a private box.

The Gentleman's Magazine has changed hands, and will in future be
published by MEssBs. BRADBURY, EVANs, & Co., Whitefriars, London,

MR. SYLVANUs URBAN.

I do not hold, with the Stoics, that the Cardinal Wirtues are Animals.
Yet it has been said that Patience is a good nag, but will bolt.

Holidays are coming-here’s a story for the children. A couple of
boys, sons of an acquaintance of mine, were proudly telling their father
(and horrifying their mother) about the fights of last half. A younger,
small brother had made divers efforts to get a hearing, but had been
shoved back and told to shut up by his seniors. At last he broke in.
“I can make one boy cry.”

GEORGE THE THIRD said that young bishops ought to write.

It was Fouché, not TALLEYRAND, who said, C'est pire qu'un crime,

In 1846 MR. DISRAELI said, in the House, “I belong to a party that
can triumph no more.” And he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in
1852 and 1858. “Define, define, well educated infants,” as Armado
says.

COMMON SENSE FROM A JUDGE.
WE request that you will allow us to protest against the fol-
lowing remarks, as most unprofessional, and altogether unfit to proceed
from the mouth of a Judge. In the Court of Exchequer, the other day,
summing up on an action for breach of promise of marriage, MR. BARON
BRAMwell, according to a law report, said:–
SIR,
• I cannot help thinking that these are actions that ought not to be encouraged.
If people change their minds, it is better they should do so before marriage than
when it is too late.”
It is obvious, Sir, that, the discouragement of actions for breach of
romise of marriage would most injuriously affect the interests of the
ſº profession. #. extent of the injury which it would inflict thereon,
however, is even greater than people in general may at first sight per-
ceive. Not only would a lucrative º of business be at once cut
off by it, but a greater amount of further litigation prevented, to our
grievous loss. -
The heavy damages with which the manly feelings of British ju
as husbands and fathers, º visit the wretch who has trifled with
the affections of somebody's daughter, and disappointed her parents in
the expectation of getting her of their hands, doubtless induce many
men to keep the promise of marriage which they are disposed to break.
So far, to be sure, that does us no F. but, Sir, observe that the fear
of incurring an action for breach of promise of marriage in such a case
which makes a man marry, makes him do that which is likely to end at
last in the natural consequence of a forced º suit for its dis-
solution. So the employment which we miss in Nisi Prius is made up
for by the work secured for us in the Probate and Divorce Court.
The British jury, with the natural sympathies of respectable men,
look merely at the wrong done by the plaintiff to the defendant and her
parents in a breach of promise case as a matter of damages in pounds,
shillings, and pence. Happily, they do not consider whether he would
not have done her a greater wrong by keeping his promise than he
en,
did by breaking it. Such considerations as this are very likely to be
suggested by such remarks from the Bench as those delivered by BARON
BRAMwFLL; and they are calculated to be highly prejudicial to your
humble Servants, Six AND EighTPENCE.

HOMOEOPATHIC TREATMENT OF A POACHER.
We insert, the following extract from the West Susser Gazette, with
the most child-like faith in the wisdom of that influential journal, and
without venturing to hazard a speculation as to the meaning, which
indeed defies the world. We only notice that the punishment is a very
leasant one, and the occupation is just now employing the PRINCE OF
ALEs and half the gentlemen of England—the Petersfield magistrates
are humane in the extreme:–
“Evil Effects of RULING PAssion.—The man Jesse Stevens, on whom the
skilful operation (in the removing of an immense tumour from his face) was per-
formed, and for whom great sympathy was manifested at Rake and its vicinity, has
been sentenced by the Bench of Magistrates, Petersfield, to three weeks' hard
labour in search of game. We regret to hear that the silly fellow has already made
his name notorious, having put in his appearance several times before the Magis-
trates for similar offences, so that while we admit the justice of the sentence, we
can hardly hope that it will have a salutary effect on one whose poaching propen:
sities led him immediately on his discharge from the King's College Hospital, and
after such a wonderful cure, to commence his old “Delight on a shiny night in the
season of the year.’”
Why curing a tumour should cure a man of poaching habits, why-
th we shut up. There is a tremendous mystery over the whole
usiness.

CHARIVARI. 243
THE FARMERS AND THEIR FRIEND.
N the Morning Star, a writer who
writes the only articles
therein that Mr. Punch pays
much attention to, calls no-
tice to the fact that at the
Cattle Show this week the
claims of MR. MechI, to
whom the farmers owe so
much, will be urged upon
the farmers:–
“The secretary to the Mechi
Testimonial will attend for the
*: of receiving subscrip-
ons to the fund now being
raised in honour of a real philan-
thropist, the much-talked-ofman
who has “made two blades of
tº. to grow where one grew
ore." -- All farmers with
brains must have largely been
benefited by MR. Mecai's experi-
ments, and ought therefore to
contribute largely to the testi-
monial. It is said that those
who have not brains oppose the
fund, on the ground that Mr.
Mºchi, by showing what good
crops can be got out of bad land,
has led landlords to increase
their rent. This is of course
mere drivel. But it is not only
the farmers who are interested.
All who want to eat cheap food
should give a friendly turn to the
man who by experiments has
done so much to get it for
them."
* Bravo, Mr. FLANEUR
Punch subscribes with all
his heart to your Mechites-
timonial. wnch believes
with you most thoroughly
that farmers , who have
brains must have greatly profited by MR. MECHI’s farming. Deep draining, and
sparse sowing, and liberal manuring are the means whereby at Tiptree corn has
sprung out of a bog; and the result of MR. Mecht's experiments, in farming
has been elsewhere widely followed with infinite success. It is, indeed, “mere
drivel” to contend that rents are raised where bad land is made good, and that
therefore MR. MechI is an enemy to farmers, who, but for his experiments, would
have been allowed to dawdle and drudge on in their old way, too ignorant or indo-
lent to grow more than the facile food which scarce-helped Nature gave. -
MECHI, it is true, is no friend to bad farmers; but farmers who have brains, and
industry to use them, must largely have been aided by the trials he has made. They
| will therefore, of course, largely contribute to the fund; as likewise should the
landlords whose rental has so risen through MR. Mºchi's influence; and the
ublic, too, who profit by fecundity of crops. If all the farms in England were
armed as well as Tiptree, we should hear no more complaints of agricultural
distress, and not a quarter of the quarters of foreign wheat imported now would
need to be brought in.
LEGAL EDUCATION.
THE sons of lawyers, who are intended for their fathers'
profession, cannot too early become familiar with legal
phrases and their meanings. Old nursery rhymes might
easily be adapted for this purpose. For instance-

MR. PUNCH
You have never, perhaps, suffered by Railway unpunctuality.

Adapted for starting a Conversation at Dinner,
But you have heard a few people complain of it. You may be aware
that it is rather a fact, and that various excuses may be made for it.
The best of these, Šir, perhaps, is the great º
In proportion as these are multiplied, so are the chances of stoppage
and accident. The train on the main line has to wait for that due in front
of it from the branch. Thus, the whole arrangements of the Railway
time-table are disturbed; and no wonder that the times are out of joint.
Yet, Mr. Punch, some 450 applications to Parliament for leave to
make new Railways were the other day catalogued in the Times. Do
ou not think, Sir, that one way to prevent the unpunctuality of
ilways from getting a great deal worse than it is would be the
refusal of the House of Commons to accede to any one of those appli-
cations over and above what are made for lines º necessary?
There may be too much of any good thing—even such a good thin
as Railway extension. Perish ancient monuments, perish Oxford,
rish St. Bride's Church; and may you, Sir, beturned out of your own
ffice by a new Railway, if absolute need be, but not otherwise. Hear
Ludgate Hill. A Voice FROM A WIADUCT.
BEAUTIFTL FOR EVER.—She who would become so should
purchase Punch's Almanack, which imparts a bloom to the sallowest-com
plexion, and restores in the most faded cheek the roseate hue of health. It makes
the eye to sparkle by the brilliance of its wit, and imparts alively vigour to the lip.

THE INWASION OF SCOTLAND.
. It may not be known that Scotland—or certain Scots—are just now
in awful alarm. An Invasion is apprehended-in fact, it has begun.
And England is the invader...We do not allude to the Tourists, who
are wickedly said to supply, Scotland with the means, of holding on
during the nine months when she is **** by civilised persons—
this new Panic is no jesting matter. That it may be comprehended in
all its terrors, we submit the following extract from the ably-written
Glasgow paper, the Morning Journal. - -
A patriotic Scot, who signs himself “SHOMER” (Gaelic for the Latin
word anter), says—we deduct Scriptural phrases, as the English do not
like profanity— " * * - - -
“I think the enemy has lately been coming in to Sabbath-loving Scotland like a
flood. I believe [sundry theological] effects will be produced by this Sabbath inva-
sion from England and this Sabbath controversy in Scotland. When our country
used to be invaded by Englishmen in freebooting and warlike times, Scotchmen
united their forces and marched to the Border to drive back the foe. Glad are we
that now that a worse invasion is being made, the rallying cry is being raised, and
the faithful, and valiant sons of Caledonia are going forth to the battle. Let us
unite our forces, and war for truth, righteousness, and peace, and victory shall
surely be ours.- ShoMER."
Bravo, SHOMER! Well cackled, Anser | You know what preserved
the Capitol in old days. In England we save our goose for Sunday; in
Scotland, Sunday is saved by the goose. But—entre nous—that is, Mr.
Punch, and the Editor of the M.J.-we did not expect to find that
journal turned, even temporarily, into a goose-pen.
Hint to Examiners.
We know several high-spirited girls who would like to present them-
selves at the Local University Examination for Ladies, did they not
object to be dictated to. Two of them (sisters) have been so eager
over their logic that Mamma, always suspicious of the military, grew
alarmed at the constant mention of “The Major, the Major,” and
insisted on the premis(s)es being examined.
* GROCER. " HUMBUG.
Yes, Correspondent, thanks. We certainly will gibbet this, bit of
cant, but we will as certainly refrain from giving its author the benefit
of the unequalled advertisement for which so many traps are set. The
following—but with different locality and name—appears in a London
newspaper:—
ANTWELL TEA MART.—R. CHADBAND, Tea Dealer and Grocer,
30, Cantwell Place, N.W., has entered the above business, that he may gra-
tuitously serve the cause of ****** in which he has been engaged five years in the
surrounding neighbourhood. -
The stars supply the place of a sacred name about to be specially
honoured at the coming festival. The pious tea-dealer uses it as a bait.
We abstain from even reprinting it. The rest we leave to our readers.
MR. CHADBAND proposes to “take orders” in a double sense, and
“serve” at once the Cause and the Customer. Werily, CHADBAND,
we would nail thine ear to thy counter, but that we should thereby |
assist thy trade, even thy traffic, beloved, but consider thine ear per-
forated, yea, with a large nail and rusty.
Homoeopathy on its Trial.
A SocIETY, with the DUKE of MARLBoRough at the head of it, has
been formed for trying the effect of homoeopathy in the treatment of
murrain. If an infinitesimal dose of arsenic is found capable of curing
a large ox, we shall be agreeably surprised... In that case, perhaps
further investigation will discover that the millionth of a grain of salt
will cure a round of beef.
OW TO ESCAPE INCOME-TAX.—Sell off everything you have,
and invest the entire proceeds in buying a lot of Punch's Almanacks, which you
may distribute among the world at large. Then go and live abroad, and don't

Conductor (joyously to Driver). “Look out, BILL! 'old 'ARD !
GOT THE PRIZE LOT THIS TIME, AND No MISTAKE '"
LEOPOLD, KING OF THE BELGIANS,
BORN : DECEMBER 16, 1790.
DIED : DECEMBER 9, 1865.
WHEREFORE such stir of tongues and pens, to-day,
Whisper of Courts, and Statesmen’s anxious frown 2
'Tis but another King, turned common clay,
º Another King, glorious in robe and crown.
But this, they tell us, was no common King, .
One schooled in life, serene and just and wise.
Is a wise Monarch, then, so rare a thing,
That we thus mourn his passing from our eyes?
Stand Thrones so high, the waters of Truth's well
Though irrepressible, leap not so far?
Broods there an air about them, that can quell
Even Truth's beamy hand and frontal star?
Then he was happy, that his infant lot
Was not into the purple to be born;
That Heaven's free air played round his baby-cot,
And narrow fortune braced his manhood's morn.
To stern adversity he went to school:
Saw his house stoop under an iron hand:
Must brook submission, in the name of rule,
Or, braving power, a beggared Prince must stand.
He chose the harder, but the prouder part:
'Gainst the Imperial giant drew the sword:
For evil stars bated nor hope nor heart,
Not realm-less, for he of himself was Lord.
Till fortune came, such as the wretched dream,
By nature's boon, in ill-hap's darkest hour;
Fortune arrayed in young love's rosiest gleam,
And in its hand the orb of kingly power.
*ERE WE'VE
He wedded the fair daughter of the Isles;
And o'er the pair a year of sunshine swept,
Then sudden mourning quenched our England's smiles,
And the young mother by her baby slept.
His life, for years, was in the sacred shrine
That memory builds above the loved and lost:
With sorrow's euphrasy he purged his eyne, .
And learned grief’s lessons, precious as their cost.
Scanning the world, from the exalted stage
Where pure and noble sorrow takes its stand;
And meting men and things by the true gauge
Put by such sorrow in the wise man's hand—
The gauge that shows how little are the things
Which shallow judgments count of highest worth :
The pomp of Courts, the dignity of Kings,
The glories that begin and end with earth.
A crown was offered him: he put it by,
Rating a crown but as a means of good:
Not eager for the mock of majesty,
That glittering bait which few have e'er withstood.
Another crown was offered: that he took,
For in its roundel scope and space he saw
To teach a º wise control to brook,
And mould a nation in the bounds of law.
Work for the regal brain, the kingly heart—
His firm and even hand the balance held
Between vexed parties, creeds that scowled apart
In hate, e'en by his wisdom checked, not quelled.
He stood aloof from factions and from feuds,
Till feuds and factions craved his tempering hand,
Bigots and partisans controlled their moods,
And a true nation's life lived through the land.
Where every man could speak the thing he thought,
Where none could all-controlling law control;
Where the strong bonds of steam and iron wrought
Strange bloods and tongues into a living whole.
So his throne stood unshaken in the hour
When thrones about him, as they reeled and fell,
Knowing no prop but the strong arm of power,
In Revolution's tocsin read their knell.
He saw his children's children round his knee,
His race's blood in royal channels rife:
Nestor of Europe's kings he lived to be,
Their fount of counsel, arbiter of strife.
No voice so like the Court that hopeful men
Dream of when good seems weak and ill grows strong:
To lash brute force to bounds of law again,
And uphold helpless right 'gainst armed wrong.
He used his sway for justice and for truth,
Till nations sought his voice as well as Kings;
The verdict that he spake all knew was sooth,
Nor fear nor favour poisoning its springs.
A noble destiny, borne nobly through
And now that he is gone we look to see
What mischief shall on his surcease ensue,
What rise of tyrants, failure of the free.
As those who learn, while floods roar through the night,
The bank is broke that held the tide at bay;
And ask aghast, in the wan morning light,
How goes it? Are the waters making way?
A Gifted Youth.
We read in Le Grand Journal (a sheet large enough to cover
the Bed of Ware) that Gustave DoRé, the REMBRANDT of
wood-engraving, makes, young as he is, not less than a hundred
and fifty thousand francs a lº. Six thousand pounds is not
a bad income to begin with... Every time this gifted young
artist puts his pencil on the block, must be equivalent to his
drawing a large cheque—a cheque that is always honoured
by the public to its fullest value. The inexhaustible facility
that the juvenile Gustave has at his fingers' ends for coining
money, is the prettiest illustration that we know of what the
French are fond of calling “une jeunesse Dorée.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DARWIN AN IDEA.
SUGGESTED BY THE CATTLE SHOW.
WHAT IT MUST COME
TO.
A PHENOMENON IN THE PULPIT.
THE performances of juvenile prodigies have hitherto been confined
to theatres, halls, and concert-rooms. But now precocity has begun to
appear in the pulpit. The natives of Yorkshire have, according to a
contemporary, been astonished by—
“A Bºy. PREACHER.—On Sunday last Two Sermons were preached in the
Methodist Free Church, North Whittington, near Sheffield, by a youthaged thirteen
years. Crowded congregations were attracted, and the collections amounted to
£3 6s, which will be devoted to the purchase of a harmonium."
For the boy? Surely an accordion would have done as well for a
oung gentleman ... years old; perhaps indeed the Infant
reacher would have been very well satisfied with a penny trumpet.
Now Ready.—The Red Hot Poker at all the Pantomimes.
“ HENRY DUNBAR " AT THE OLYMPIC.
WHAT a º destiny is that of the dramatic author |
Not for his freedom of the theatres, both before and behind the
curtain; not for his opportunities of direct appeal to the dear British
public, and his certainty of getting his º: (or his condemnation,
as the case may be), not cold-drawn, and “in notes by distance made
less sweet,” but hot and hot, and at the hands of his hearers; not for
his privilege of fitting pretty actresses with pretty parts, and taking
the measure, in the most familiar style, of the popular favourites of the
other sex;-all these are pleasant chances, but there is one chance in
which the dramatic author now-a-days is still more blessèd beyond his
pen-fellows, and that is, in his critics. He is judged by his brethren,
and not seldom by his unsuccessful brethren. It is difficult to enu-
merate all the advantages which thus accrue to him. In the first place,
he is sat upon by what the French call experts, workmen of his own
craft-gentlemen who, to use a vulgarism, have been “in the oven
themselves.” Now we all know how two of a trade are apt to agree.
Of course such judges are keenly appreciative of beauties or demerits.
especially, the former, and generous, as brethren should be, in their
tribute of admiration. But, besides this, the practice secures to the
author criticised the inestimable advantage of a series of in his
art. Each critic takes his turn to point out to him how his piece might
have been better conceived and better executed; how the scenes might
have been re-arranged, the dialogue re-written, and the characters
re-combined, to the immense advantage of the general effect.
*There is only one drawback to the value of this kind of instruction,
that the instructors are never sº among themselves—one gentleman
invariably praising what the other blames, and Oracle A. º as
highly desirable, what Oracle B. protests against as inevitably to
success.
*We have been led into these remarks by reading the criticisms on
the recent adaptation of Henry Dunbar at the Olympic, as to which,
however, we find the critics, who differ on every other point, agreeing
in two things, which probably the author and the manager of the
Olympic may consider a very sufficient set-off against their conflicting
testimony or contradictory counsel on all other points. The first point
of agreement is, that the piece was eminently successful—a fact which
some of these gentlemen may find it difficult to reconcile with their
judgments of it, and which no doubt the Morning Advertiser is right
in thinking discreditable to the British public; not the “public,” by
the way, with which he, as the Tap-Tub oracle, is naturally most
familiar.
The second point of agreement is that the acting, especially that of
Miss KATE TERRY, MR. H. NEVILLE and MR. Wixcent was able,
—of the very best quality. -
On both these pointsilſr. Punch is happy to agree with the critics.
He can testify to the success of the piece, though he is unhappily under
the necessity of differing with the oracular gentleman of the 'Tizer as to
its merits. And respecting the quality of the acting, he is also happy to
bear his testimony, in common with his friends the critics of the daily
papers, to the exquisite refinement, sensibility, and unaffected truth of
Miss KATE TERRY, one of the most consummate actresses of her own
range of parts we have ever seen on the English stage, in Margaret
Wentworth—a debt he pays all the more readily, because he feels himself
very heavily in arrears to that young lady for the tears she made him
shed in Anne Carew, for some of which, by the way, her little sister is
partly answerable—and to MR. Neville's earnestness, well-conceived
reserve, and self-restraint in Henry Dunbar. The Major, in MR.
VINCENT's hands, is a scamp worthy to take his º by Montague
Tigg and Robert Macaire, and few better-conceived bits of ºf have
een seen on our stage of late years. Oh, if The Major will only stay
where he is, and not let himself be carried away by the º: of the
dear B. P., which does like its bit ºf fat, and never quite knows when
it has had enough!
Thanks to these artists, to MR. SouTAR, and MR. MonTAGUE, and
to the acting of the smaller parts of a waiter by MR. F. Cooper, and
of the old banker, Balderby, Punch found in Henry Dunbar what he
rarely finds–Ensemble ; and he can only say to other managers and
authors charged with drilling a company, “Go ye and do likewise.”.
Accidentally Correct.
The power of aspirating words, which Londoners are supposed to
possess, but which provincials practise to an incalculably greater extent,
sometimes hits the truth, though it is only by what is called a happy
accident. For instance, we heard SLIPPER the other day, saying, “The
great fault he had to find with young ladies of the present day was, that
they were always giving themselves such tremendously false hairs.”
By Jove, he wasn’t far wrong.
TAN Exclusive SET.-A New series of dances has been arranged for
County Balls. It is named the County-Court Quadrilles.

HOW TO WIN AN ELECTION.
CERTAINLY they manage some things far better in France. We
learn, for instance, by a statement in the Pall Mall Gazette, that re-
cently at Yonne the votes of the electors were requested for a gentleman
who in his great modesty put forth no other claim to them than such as
might be gathered from the following placard:—
CANDIDATAU CORPS LEGISLATIF.
| M. FREMY,
INVITE DE COMPIEGN.E.
This is a delightfully short and simple form for an Election address; and
to our mind it is just as good as one parading all the usual catalogue of
virtues which candidates possess. It is a pity some such form is not
adopted here in England. What a quantity of needless twaddle it
would save! Imagine if a candidate had Our august permission to
announce that he had been invited to 85, Fleet Street, and had been
received under the roof of Mr. Punch, what more would need be said
about his clearly obvious fitness for admission into parliament? and
who would dare to oppose, or to vote against, a candidate whom
Mr. Punch in his great wisdom thought proper to invite P
Warmth for Wilful Nakedness.
Now the inclement season of the . is approaching, our sympathies
are naturally excited on behalf of those poor creatures whose clothing
is insufficient to protect them from the wintry blast. . Just at this time
no conduct can be more unseasonable than that of able-bodied paupers
in workhouses, who, on purpose to give trouble and annoyance, tear up
their clothes. Still, they should not be left to perish of cºld; and
magistrates ought to be empowered by statute to order the backs of all
such perverse offenders to be warmed with a good whipping.

No modest man now rides in an omnibus. I had nearly said no

Said I unto a friend of mine last week, “How long are you going to
write those furious satires against soldiers and priests?” He replied,
“Until I have made money enough to buy CHARLEs a commission

Follow a lawyer’s advice, however, occasionally. Not because it is
wise, for it seldom is, but because it usually frees you from legal

Fancy a Clergyman, on intimate terms with the Primate of All
England, writing a poem to his friend, and inscribing it, To the

Conversing with a nobleman's son who had sent for me to the neigh-
bourhood of Chancery Lane, by reason that the proverbial hospitality
of the chosen people would not hear of his leaving the house in
which he was a guest, I gently hinted that it was hardly the thing,
in these days, to order so many dressing-cases, and studs, and fur-
coats with no possible means of paying for them. “You’ve just hit
it, my boy,” said the HonourABLE RoDERICK Doo, with a pleasing
smile. “In these days. But is it my fault that I came so late
into the world P Had I been one of my feudal ancestors, I should
never have done these mean things. I should have swooped down,
like a gentleman, with my retainers, and simply taken the necessaries
of life, or what were then such. Don’t abuseſme for being an anachro-

AEolian harps were very common when I was a boy, The rising
generation may need to be told that these were long boxes, with wires
above them, protected by a cover, and were placed in windows, the
sash being shut down upon them. The wind did the rest. Sentimental
folks adored the instrument. I should think it must have been highly
effective for the raising of Blue Devils.

But there was another toy of my youth which I am sorry to miss in
my age. Where is the kaleidoscope * We used to have huge ones,
which gave visions of elaborate glory. I know that there are some

“Where no oxen are, the crib is clean.” I that many an

MR. DICKENs, in his beautiful preface to Miss Proorºº's poems,
mentions some of the curious reasons which people adduce for demand-
ing that you accept their literary efforts, or introduce them to the
reading world. 1 am a good deal pestered in this way. . A lady, of
whom I had never heard, sending me a novel in MS., which I was to
read, amend if necessary, get accepted by a publisher, see through the
E. and then puff, informed me that, her mother had, centuries ago
!een acquainted with my father, and had liked him, and that if he ha
liked her, and had wedded her, we–the fair scribe and myself—should
have been sister and brother. . But I sent back the MS. unopened, for
all that, and all that, and would have done so for twice as much as all
that. Women are dreadfully impudent, that’s a fact.

BRADY and TATE's birds are certainly the politest of all creatures.
In one of their abominable parodies of the Psalms, B. and T. set forth
that as for the wicked man,
“The ravens shall pick out his eyes,
And eagles eat the same.”
The courtesy of the ravens, in extracting the food, and leaving it for the
superior birds, is above praise. . Why does not the ATTORNEY-GENERAL
see about pºlins a new version. Thanks, meantime, for your hymn-
book, Sir R. P. 229
What do you say? You wanted a good title to your Christmas book
of wild dream-stories. Why didn't you come to me? I am a royal

In the case of the fireworks to which Pharaoh's name has been
blunderingly appended, the fizzdom of the serpent is by no means com.

but a pack of idiots make a needless fuss about it. You need not
exactly inhale the smoke, and short of that, the hideous exhibition is safe
enough. Snap-dragon is much prettier.

That second column of the Times offers some riddles, usually not
worth solving. There has been one lately, in which the words, “Your

I have seen young fellows, before they have lost all their becoming
modesty, avoid encountering the concentrated fire of all the eyes of a

same moment, he might have been more bold.

POPULATION AND GAME.
MR. BRIGHT, in his speech at Birmingham, the
other day, said, with reference to gentlemen who share
the opinions of your humble servant:-
SIR,
“If I told them that in this civilised and Christian country a man
would be sent to prison for the sake of preserving, and to a greatex-
cess, a sport that is absurd in this thickly populated country, they
would not be more disposed to give you a vote if they thought that
you would provide a remedy for this state of things.”
That depends, Mr. Punch, as far as I am concerned, on
the remedy they would propose to provide. Is it really
true that the sport of shooting has become, as MR. BRIGHT
says, “absurd in this thickly populated country?”. If that
is so, what a country it, has grown!. A country, the
thickness of whose population is such as to render
shooting in its fields and covers absurd, must be one much
too crowded to be pleasant. Who would swelter in such a
country? I don't think England has got quite so bad as
that yet. If it had, the proper “remedy” for a “state of
things,” wherein shooting, would be absurd, would, per-
haps, in the opinion of the hon. Member for Birmingham,
be the abolition of the Game Laws. Certainly I should not
be disposed to give anybody a vote who would vote for that.
But I would willingly give honest ...; men a vote if I
thought them likely to provide a remedy for circumstances
incompatible with shooting, not by any measure tending to
the destruction!of game, but by measures calculated to check
population.
The reversal of the liberal legislation of the last six-and-
thirty }. especially the repeal of Free Trade, would no
doubt have that effect. Tam not without hope that a Tory
multitude might be induced to dictate indefinite reaction.
But in the meantime population promises to be checked
by circumstances. The Registrar-General's Returns of
Marriages may as yet have shown no falling off. But they
soon must. Look at the price of butcher's meat. Look
at the enormous cost of women's dress. An immense
fortune is required to maintain a wife and family, or even a
wife alone. Marriage will soon be possible only for the
wealthy few. That is, if the masses are taught to form a
sufficiently highestimate of necessary comfort; as Isincerely
wish they may be, for I am, in so far, a friend to education,
albeit sometimes called Old Boots.
Carlton Club.
PROGRAMME FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.
MR. PUNCH, -
ALLow me, Sir, if you please, a little room for the purpose of
offering a suggestion to the Conservative º: I am generally re-
garded as a member of that party, but I do not call myself a Conservative.
I call myself a Tory. My political opinions are simply the same as those
which were held by the late LORD ELDoN. - ---
The Conservatives, Mr. Punch, have hardly anything left, politically,
to conserve. Socially, however, there still remains something to be con-
served. For one thing, Sir, there is the English character of English
women, which has not gone yet; let Conservatives direct their energies
to conserving that. - - -
We consider ourselves, as you know, Sir, the special .
of old English tastes and feelings, particularly as contradistinguished
from what is revolting as well as new-fangled and foreign. We stan
up for roast beef against roast horse, as our fathers did against fricasseed
frogs. Let us take the same ground against those abominable French
extravagances_and absurdities in attire with, which our women have
stooped to suffer themselves to be disfigured. I mean chignons, and
false hair, and rouge, and whitening; and all that preposterous roomful
of muslin and gauze, lace, ribbons, artificial flowers, fº weeds, and
vegetables, out of which you see a head and face, with bare shoulders,
emerging in a ball-room. All this is copied by English ladies from
French; and the French ladies copy it—from whom? The late M.
Durin has told us, Mr. Punch. I will not venture to ask you to allow
me to repeat his statement.
If the dress were pretty, and set, the wearer off to advantage, that
would be something to weigh against the taint of its origin., But it is
grotesque as well as disreputable. It was doubtless invented to give an
artificial presence to the sort of person that women call an “upstart,”
meaning thereby not one who has risen from a low origin, but merely a
little pert, impudent creature. The original purpose of this bramblebush
of clothes, in which the wearer is lost, was evidently to disguise a bad
iſ economy, a steady advocate of domestic
figure, and hide thick ankles and large feet. Its very general adoption
I ascribe to the prevalent passion for equality, putting as it does all
women, on a level. , Sir, the English women do not gain by placing
themselves on a level with the French; to say nothing of those with
whom the ladies of France have levelled themselves.
The whole abomination comprehended under the name of Crinoline is
an excrescence of democracy as well as of vice. Its abatement there-
fore ought to be the aim of every Conservative. I saw, the other day,
in the Publicité of Marseilles, that the example has been set our own
young men, by no less than 6,000 bachelors of that city, between the
ages of twenty and thirty, of pledging one another not to ask any
in marriage until a complete change shall have taken place in her habits,
particularly in dress. Sir, I beg to propose the Establishment of a
Conservative Society for the Revival of Moderation in Millinery. The
Conservatives might as well set to work at that for want of somethin
better to do. I am, Sir, though a determined opponent of politi
RETRENCHMENT.
P.S. I am credibly informed that a French lady in full dress often
stands in the midst of some thousand guineas.
Scientific.
At the last meeting of the Anthropological Society there was a
delightful discussion on Cannibalism. MR. CARTER BLAKE fired up
over this subject to such an extent, that several members, noticing the
presence of the “devouring element” in his speech, felt slightly uncom-
ſortable. The learned Secretary, we need hardly inform our readers,
has not suggested Cannibalism as an alternative if the cattle disease
çºntinues. We have heard of a gentleman, not a hundred yards from
Charing Cross being “eaten up with pride,” but, with the unchristian
old woman, let us hope, it isn't true.

SIGNS AND SEASONS.
EveRY month has its zodiacal sign; the seasons are typified by
various devices. We recognise the approach and then the presence of
winter by several unmistakable i. For instance, it is a sign of cold
weather when, having been called at a quarter to eight A.M., you ask
what sort of a morning it is, and receive the answer that “It is a fine
clear sharp morning” with qualified pleasure.
It is a sign of the season when you are not sorry to hear it is a dull
morning “out,” and feel, that, by remaining in bed you have the best of
the situation. It is also a sign of the cold season when (being still
in bed) you are inclined to disbelieve any one who rubs his hands and
declares. “It’s a beautiful morning, and he feels as warm as a toast.”
It is certainly a sign of its being very cold weather, when you think
that you'll just turn round and warm yourself thoroughly before getting
up. The following are signs of winter:-
When you think that you don’t know whether the first bell has been
rung or not. . .
When it strikes you that your watch is at least ten minutes fast;
and so if you get up when the minute hand is ‘at a quarter to” you’ll
be in capital time.
. That if you could only be taken out of bed to be washed and dressed
in a second by machinery, you wouldn't mind getting up.
That another five minutes' sleep will make you all right for the day.
That it’s three minutes to the half-hour, and you’ll get up exactly at
the half-hour.
That it's just one minute past the half-hour, so you’ll get up exactly
at the thirty-five minutes. -
That as five minutes won't make much difference, say, get up at the
quarter punctually.
The following considerations will also lead you to the conclusion that
the winter has come at last:—
That you can't get up without hot water.
That you don't think that water is quite hot.
... That he, had better bring a little more water, please; and take care
it’s quite hot.
2.That you can't get up until your clothes are all ready for you.
That a little snooze while JAMEs is bringing the clothes (and while he
fetches some more hot water), will do you all the good in the world.
That when you do get up, you won't be a second, dressing.
That you’ll get up in exactly two minutes from now.
That (the two minutes having passed) you’ll just settle what you’re
going to do to-day, and then get up.
That, if that’s the first bell, you’ve plenty of time; and if it’s the
second, it’s no good hurrying up now, as you’re late anyhow.
The consideration.that is generally required before making a move
out of bed, is in itself a pretty sure sign of the presence of Winter.
A STRANGE LIBERTY FOR SPAIN.
ATELEGRAM, dated on the 10th instant from Madrid, affords infor-
mation which is news indeed. Read it; and stare:- a
“The Government contemplates taking under the protection of Spain the negro
kingdoms on the African coast opposite Fernando Po, and to proclaim religious
liberty in the latter island and the kingdoms in question.”
It is difficult to imagine a novelty so startling as the proclamation of
religious liberty by a Spanish Government. To be sure the present
Goyernment of Spain is liberal enough to have recognised the Kingdom
of Italy. It may therefore be hoped that the religious liberty which
the Ministers of QUEEN ISABELLA intend to proclaim in Fernando Po
and the adjacent kingdoms, has begun at home, and that the proclama-
tion of Spanish religious liberty in the above-named territories will not
simply mean the announcement, on behalf of the authorities there, of the
liberty to imprison Protestants for practising their religion.
The Philosophy of History. -
SoME of the Clergy have been remonstrating against the existing
arrangements in connection with QUEEN ANNE's Bounty. How history
repeats itself! In the nineteenth century we have over again The

HOW TO MAKE MONEY.
SIR,
“ plans.” º plans fall to the ground simply because I can’t find any
one sufficiently enterprising to take them up, and work them for me
with the necessary capital. You have kindly allowed me a space in
your pages, which I may use to put before the public at large
some of my plans, and individuals can look into them and write to me
upon the various subjects. . -
My plans all point to one end, i.e. the making a fortune. I see how
fortunes are to be made: such is my taste for this work that had I
a large fortune I would lay it out in making another. The difficulty
that I labour under is want of capital; let anyone step forward and say
to me, “BUNTLE, my dear fellow, here’s twenty thousand pounds for
you, now then go-a-head with it,”—the world would soon hear of my
gigantic undertakings. No one, however, has as yet shown anything
like a full confidence in the BUNTLE capabilities. Now, therefore, I
throw myself before the public, I stop the crowd with my out-stretched
hand; I say to it, stop and listen to BUNTLE. Some few may have the
brains to seize upon the notions thrown out to you, if so, come to me
and I, BUNTLE, will give you my further ideas upon the subject.
Henceforth, no one shall be able to work an idea of mine without
acknowledging its source, because I shall have proclaimed it publicly.
I say nothing about recent inventions by which some persons have
benefited considerably. I am silent, though, believe me, I was the man
who gave the original idea, that contained the germ of the future plant,
to those who were in a position to use it, work it, develope it, and

Philip Van Artevelde, Act i., Scene 5,
SHAKSPEARE IN SILENCE.
Songs without words are familiar in our ears; but it is a novelty to
hear of plays without words audible. Yet the Athenæum tells us where
this curious stage phenomenon has recently been witnessed:—
“The drama is in active use at several of our asylums. Wery recently, Shak-
sPEARE's Henry IV., (arranged by MR. PATTERson) was performed by deaf and
dumb pupils, in presence of their deaf and dumb school fellows and an interested
body of spectators, rather than audience, at Manchester. The text was conveyed
through the ' sign-language' familiar to the pupils, and it was easily followed by
the other spectators."
A capital notion this of playing SHAKSPEARE in dumb show. We
hope some London Manager will take the hint and act upon it. “Not
to speak profanely” of any stage celebrities, it would be a great relief
if one could see a play of SHAKSPEARE's, without hearing SHAK-
speARE's language mumbled, mouthed, or murdered otherwise. A
troupe of clever pantomimists might readily be trained to strike the
proper attitudes, and make the gestures fitted to the speeches in a play;
while the audience could mentally supply the missing words. The eye
would thus be satisfied by the sight of a stage-show, while the ear
would not be tortured by emphasis used wrongly and English mispro-
nounced. Many persons, when they are asked to go and hear a play of
SHAkspeaRE's, reply, “No, thank you, I prefer to read it to myself.”
Yet, while reading, they might like to see the scenery and dresses; nor
might they object even to the presence of the actors, if their mouths
i. only shut, and their tongues thus kept aloof from mutilation of
e text.

CRIMINAL HAIR-CUTTING.
He attention of fair ladies is re-
quested to the following:—
“The chignons, which form so im-
portant a part of the toilet of a
modern lady of fashion, are pro-
cured, it would seem, at the ex-
pense of a great deal of annoyance to
the softer sex of Germany. Accord-
ing to the Europe, the whole country
is in an uproar on account of the
eople who about, scissors in
º with the express object of
cutting the hair of every woman
who walks with it dressed after the
fashion of the country—i.e., hanging
in ..º. over the back. Even the
churches are not free from these
pestilent thieves, the last case re-
º being that of a lady whose
air was cut off whilst engaged in
her devotions in the Evangelical
church of Buda."
See, ladies, to what evil deeds
your folly may give rise. You
ought to be ashamed of wear-
ing any hair which, excepting
by the right of purchase, is
- not yours; but the shame is
mºre than doubled when the hair you buy is stolen, and cut by sneaking
pilferers from living women's heads. Certainly in this case you ought
to be indicted for receiving stolen goods; and, indeed, by fights you
ought, to be held liable to punishment for having tempted thieving
scoundrels to commit a brutal series of dastardly assaults. The rufians
who clip off women's hair that you may wear it are guilty of com.
mitting a most horrid mutilation; and it is your purchase of false hair
that provokes them to the act. If you ºf persist in this abominable
practice, it would serve you right to have the street boys

PRUSSIA’S OWN FAITH.
WB are informed by the foreign correspondent of a contemporary
that “a new sect has lately sprung up at Berlin.” This last addition to
the world's lunatics at large is called by its members “The Cogitants.”
The founder of this fraternity, a DR. Edward LöwenTHAL, has pub-
lished a book about his bosh, which he calls “a religion without a con-
fession.” NEDDY LöwenTHAL's disciples have also a magazine, bearing
for its motto the following nonsense:-
“Our knowledge is our faith; our dignity is our morality; our worship is life,
and our religion is our secret.”
No secret appears, however, to be made of the doctrines and practices
of this “religion without a confession.” Some of its tenets are remark-
able. The “Cogitants” hold that—
“Neither theft nor fraud can be punished with imprisonment. Women are to
have a part in the Church government. Only the lower part of a coffin should be
buried in the earth."
Cogitantism, so far, seems to be the conceit of a crazy knave; the
chimera of a rogue affected with softening of the brain. Here, how-
ever, is a regulation of the Cogitant system which indicates its author
to be, in as far as he is not wholly a rogue, not altogether a fool:-
“All good Cogitants are to have a good dinner for nothing, and dine in public, on
Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and Whit-Sunday.”
It may be understood how the Cogitants “are to have a good dinner
for nothing" without a miracle. If “neither theft nor fraud can be
punished with imprisonment,” there appears to be no reason why
geese, and legs of mutton, and other materials requisite for a good
dinner, should not be stolen. A difficulty, nevertheless, will stand in
the way of this arrangement pending the conversion to Cogitantism of
butchers, poulterers, and other dealers in food, with Society in general.
There is something very striking, though, in the fact that a religion,
one of whose principal points, is that “neither theft nor fraud can be
punished with imprisonment,” should have “sprung up in Berlin.” Is
not that city the capital of a country wherein theft and fraud are honoured
by illustrious patronage? Was not Denmark invaded, and despoiled of
the Duchies, on a pretext now avowed to have been, false? In the
crime thus perpetrated were not theft and fraud heautifully combined?
Then, who forgets the solemn thanksgiving pronounced by pious
Royalty itself for the success of that fraud and that theft, and not only
that theft, but the murders by which it was attended ?
THE VERY LAST ExPRESSION OF PRIZE PIG FATNESS.
IN OUR LAST WEEK's NUMBER.
FORGOTTEn
THE MAGISTRATES” PRIZES.
MR. Punch has great pleasure in unhesitatingly awarding the last
Prize of the Year to
MR. TRAFFORD,
Magistrate at Salford, for the very sensible Speech which he is reported
to have addressed to a Clergyman:-
“The Rev. O. Dr. LEvilAND BALDwnn, Curate of St. Stephen's, Salford, was
charged at the Salford Town Hall, on Tuesday, with assaulting a chorister boy,
named William WHARton. MR. TharrorD said he should fine the defendant 10s.
He regretted the necessity for that decision, but he really thought that those per-
sons, the High Church people, who talked so much about the sanctity of the
Church, ought to take care and not thrash a lad within its sacred precincts.”
Very Curious Coincidence.
ATTENTION has lately been attracted to the extraordinary height of
the barometer. Had this phenomenon any connection with the high
price of butchers’ meat f

ADMIRAL FitzRoy, late Curator of the Weather, has left his family
without much provision. He expended large sums in perfecting the
system which has saved thousands of lives. A Fund is in course of
collection, for presentation to those whom his sudden death deprived of
his support. The mercantile world alone ought to have made any
general appeal needless. If the sea-ports do not subscribe handsomely,
it will be my duty to erect such sea-marks on them as will be remem-
bered. I shall probably begin with Aberdeen.
285.
A witness in a !.. case the other day being asked what his religion
was, replied that he was neither Jew nor Gentile, but a sort of half and
half, and his religion was to do the best he could for himself, and his
wife and family. I have heard worse creeds. At all events he denounced
no terrible doom against any other religionists.
236.
I perceive an advertisement for the place of groom. The advertiser
is a young married man, “who has lived with a deceased incumbent
seven years in Warwickshire.” A Ghoul-Groom.
237.
A leading New York paper, is good enough to say of me, “The
London Punch is unquestionably a power in Europe and throughout
the civilised world. But then Punch is sui generis. Moreover, he is
not afraid of what People, or Parties, or Powers may think of his
satires.” I should say not. “What is fear, Grandmamma P” as LoRD
Nelson asked—or did not ask. 238
And, by the way, I suppose, that because LoRD, NELson said,
“Victory or Westminster Abbey” that glorious sea-captain was buried
in St. Paul's, 239
If any lady—specially any mother—wants a thorough good cry, I
recommend her MRs. OLIPHANT's charmingly written new novel, Agnes.
240.
A gallant captain of a whaler took for his motto, “Blubber for ever.”
“Shan’t,” said his widow, re-marrying.
241.
I hereby signify my extreme obligation to MR.T.W. ERLE, Associate,
Court of Common Pleas, for a capital little pamphlet, on the present
abominable system of summoning special juries in London and Middle-
sex. The summonses come to some folks very seldom, and to others in
such numbers as, to make, one suspect, as MR. EYRE says, that
“favouritism and bribery” have something to do with the matter. I
suppose that it is necessary that a gentleman should be hurried out of
his house at nine in the morning, to the neglect of his business, and
should stick in a dirty crowded court, where no accommodation is pro-
vided for him, and after waiting three or four days, should be put into
a box to listen to a two-penny case. that ought to be decided by an
inferior judge. That's the Constitution. But the process ought not to
be made utterly intolerable. MR.ERLE has some excellent suggestions
for reforming the system, and if he succeeds he ought to be made a
real Earl. 242
You know, I º that Cambridge now examines Girls.Thirteen
were examined at Bristol the other day, and did great credit to their
instructors. The excellent bishop seemed puzzled to know whether he
should call the candidates “girls,'...or “young ladies.” None of your
jokes about gownswomen, and Mistresses of Hearts. I see no objec-
tion to Spinster, any more than to Bachelor, but I suppose the darlings
will be of Lydia Languish's mind, “O that I should live to hear myself
called spinster.” 243
As a good many educated men, have been returned to the new
Parliament, I suggest to the Speaker to drop the vulgar tongue, and
instead of saying, “As many as are of that opinion say Aye, those of a
contrary opinion say No-I think the Ayes have it,” let MR. DENIson
give the last lines of this year's Westminster Epilogue:–
“Diceant “Immo’ quibus placet hac sententia. Dicant
Queis contraria “Nou." Prevalet “Immo,' reor.”

Bother Consols. If the Turkish Gladstone continues his good work
of reforming the finances of the empire, I shall invest in the Tahvilati

Gorgeous THE Fourth did not often say"anything worth remem:
bering, but he one day remarked to a foreign minister, “We have had
war for thirty years—let us all conspire to keep the peace.”
246.
Somebody told me a goodish story about a crack pigeon-shooter. He
ways shot with a glass in his eye. . One day, when he was just going
to fire, he dropped his glass, and, looking about for it, trampled it to
ieces. , Swore and all that, but said he would shoot, nevertheless.
eavy betting against him. When his friends were all right, he pro-
duced another eye-glass, and killed every bird. There were brains in
this noble sportsman.
247.
Don't you really know the difference between a Sublapsarian and a
Superlapsarian? What are the Sunday Schools for? F. first holds
that ADAM was merely permitted—not pre-determined—to fall, whereas
the second maintains that his fall had been pre-determined, and that he
could not avoid it. Both are sub-divisions of Calvinism."
248.
Why are there so few Marquises?
249.
What do you mean, Sir, by saying that you “faithfully promised?”
Solemnly, earnestly, you ought to say. One performs a promise faith-
fully—sometimes.
250.
I saw the other day that when a landlord made the usual disgusting
quarterl y application to certain tenants, they got on some stone-heaps by
the side of the road, and pelted him handsomely, Serve him right. I
suppose that they had been reading Rokeby. “Hearts are not flint, and
flints are rent.”
251.
The new bill about London Traffic is good, as far as it goes, but the
regulations will have to be much more stringent. What’s the use of
excluding vehicles drawn by six horses? It is the Wan, drawn by two,
and the Wan-demon driver, that must be expelled. Then, if all carts
are driven off during the afternoon, and it is ordained that everything
shall make way for a swell in a Hansom, I may occasionally go to my
office, vid the Strand and Fleet Street, instead of by my underground
tunnel from Grosvenor Square. As for the proposed bridges, do you
think that the women will use them? How can they, while MANTALINI
reigns f

FARLey brought out Aladdin at Covent Garden about forty years
ago, I think, and a very fine show it was. In the Lyceum burlesque on
the same story, when the palace began to ascend, an actor had to
remark
p “Say the house rose a little after two.”
253.
Where’s that MS. play of ShakspeaRE's that we were told had
been found, and sent to the Crystal Palace It dropped through, I
fancy. There was really something in existence, however. It was called
Albumazar, and SHAKSPEARE and BAcon had as much to do with it as
I had with Macbeth. 2

EMANUEL SwedenBorg has one doctrine, exquisitely beautiful, among
many. He, holds that infants, in the better world, do not remain mere
infants, without intelligence and wisdom, but are cultivated, as it were,
into angels, which have both. But not so as to grow up beyond early
youth. This belief, I take it, would at once commend itself to myriads,
whose feelings SouthEY has expressed in the passage beginning, “They
sin who tell us.” 255
As this is the season of good wishes, here is something which you
can add to your letters of congratulation:—
“Precor ut hic annus tibi laetis auspiciis
Ineat, laetioribus procedat, laetissimis exeat,
Et sapius recurrat semper felicior.”
256.
I see that MRs. SHERwooD's books are advertised as gifts to chil-
ren. She meant well, of course, but the frightful doctrines and
frightful stories (specially in the Fairchild Family) are just the things
to make a sensitive child melancholy in the light, and miserable in the
dark. There was a tale about a Dreadful Eye that haunted a poor
little girl who had taken some damsons, and another about the corrupt-
ing face of a hanged murderer, to whose gibbet an affectionate father
took his little children, because they had a nursery quarrel, which were
#. ºlia. I am the Children's Friend, and will not have them
rightened.
257.
But I like to be frightened myself. I am very fond of Der Vampyr,
and if Drury Lane would get up the Castle Spectre, well, I would often
send to the manager for boxes, by way of encouraging him.

Ten thousand pounds, and all my back volumes (that is to say
£20,000, therefore), to the man or woman who shall invent a device for

“ALLOW ME TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.”
(Clown in the Pantomime.)
NURSE Russell, Nurse Russell, beware of the day
When BRITANNLA shall meet thee in hostile array,
To put thee to question, as sulky as may be,
And with black looks inquire, “What you’ve done with the Baby?”
Qh think how the answer, rash Nurse, would go down,
“Please, Marm, I gave Baby to nurse to the Clown | *
Who but knows to what fate the poor Baby is doomed,
Whose care by that rough nurse, the Clown, is assumed.
How 'tis first coaxed and petted, then scolded and slapped:
How its poor little head on the hard boards is rapped:
With what horrors its poor little stomach is crammed,
Down its throat with the coarsest of feeding-spoons rammed.
How with rough scrubbing-brushes and blacking 'tis polished;
How its features are squeezed and its frocks are demolished;
How from dandling Clown soon comes to dancing upon it,
Till, last scene of all, like its nurse's crushed bonnet,
Squeezed flat as a pancake 'twixt Clown and his chair,
Head foremost 'tis recklessly chucked in the air.
Then let’s pray for a speedy deliverance from ill
For Nurse Russell, and eke for her poor little Bill.
The babe may be threatened by rad and * rough,
If it's weak, and don't go what they call far enough;
But if once handed over to Clown by its nurse,
It perhaps may go farther, but sure’twill fare worse.
“SPLENDIDk MENDAx.”—Lying-in-state.
LOWE-LAW AMENDMENT SOCIETY.
At a recent meeting of the Love-Law Amendment Society, Miss
I.W. GREEN read a Paper on the Abolition of Capital Punishment for
Hºlºuring Promissory Notes and Stealing Heart's-ease in a Dwelling-
Ouse.
By º punishment, Miss I, W. GREEN understood capital in its
mercantile sense. A man of capital was a capital partner in a matri-
monial firm, and without capital business would be suspended in
Hymen's workshops, where a large number of hands were employed in
fixing and riveting. The dishonouring of promissory notes, and steal-
ing heart's-ease in a dwelling-house, were offences that had always
hitherto been visited with capital punishment; though taking £2000
from a delinquent who, had let himself down to fall on knee, was not
unlike compounding felony. (Hear.) By moving violently twelve men
in a box, one naturally looks for heavy damages. Miss I. W. GREEN
thought that such a system was injurious in every sense—moral and
monetary. She would have reformatories established, where incorri.
gible heart-breakers should be confined for five or six months, without
wine, or walnuts, and visited regularly by sisters full of charity, who
should read to them their own perfidious letters in soft but thrilling
tones. (Sensation.)
Miss MERRY VEIL thought that culprits could not be better em-
§§ than in rolling pie-crust, under the humiliating conviction that,
ike their past promises, it was made to be broken.
Several other punitive schemes were suggested and discussed, but
none seemed to afford so much satisfaction as that epistolary purgatory
proposed by Miss I. W. GREEN.
