,
with a hilarious beating of the
heart, presents his FIFTH VOLUME,
and his Third Christmas Gift, to an applauding world.
Punch was never guilty of that self-denying modesty,
which, pauper-like, stands uncapped in thousands of
Prefaces, assuring the reader that the book before him
is, indeed, a poor thing -- a crude, unripe pippin,
unworthy the tooth of any gentleman; while at the
very time the hypocritical sneak-up, in the sweet
bigotry of conceit, believes it to be an apple from
the Hesperides :-no; Punch is above the meanness
of such felonious bashfulness, and throws down a new
Volume on the counter of the world, as he would
lay down a fifty pound note, rustling in all its virgin
silveriness from the bank. With every new tome,
Punch feels that he presents a new pleasure to mankind; and therefore, with a pardonable gesture of triumph,
twitches his waistband, and looks smilingly about him with the sparkling eye of a benefactor !
The present Volume is Punch's CHRISTMAS Gift. There are certain authors whose books require a key
for the necessary understanding thereof. Punch will, for once, condescend to imitation ; and, in few words,
produce a key by means of which his present Book for Christmas may be the better digested and enjoyed.
Laughter is a divine faculty. It is one of the few, nay, the only one redeeming grace in that thunder-
cased, profligate old scoundrel Jupiter, that he sometimes laughs: he is saved from the disgust of all respectable
people by the amenity of a broad grin. It is a prerogative, conceded to Punch, to awaken laughter; and when
he thinks of the national blood he has quickened—when, every night, falling off into the Elysium of sweet
dreams, he reflects upon the increased circulation of John Bull, and himself, he cannot but no; he will not
boast : he will cultivate humility, though like asparagus, at this festive season, he is obliged to force it.
That the present Volume may be perused in a proper spirit—that laughter, free and silvery from the
heart, may escape the reader, doing rightful honour to Punch, and bestowing cheerfulness and health upon the
laugher, it is—Punch repeats-necessary to read his book after certain self-preparation. Otherwise, Punch
refuses the homage of merriment ; would sooner listen to pebbles rattling in a tin-pot than the broad grin of

the selfish ; would as lieve peep into the fauces Averni, as behold the open jaws of the mere man of pocket, who,
when he buttons his coat about him, believes he incloses therein all that is really valuable in the whole
universe !
Therefore, Punch produces his key to the proper enjoyment of this volume. It is simple; to be compre-
hended and acted upon by every reader. The book is a Christmas pleasure ; but, Reader, before you open it-
ere you set your teeth in a single paragraph, answer Punch truly: What have you done, this “merry Christmas,"
for the happiness of those about, below you?
Nothing? Do you dare, with those sirloin cheeks and that port-wine nose, to answer—Nothing? Close
the book : for to you, Punch is and shall be a dead letter. You may, indeed, scan the type, and think you
understand it; you may laugh, and think the mirthfulness a pleasant reality. Alas! you have read dead words ;
you could not know the true spirit enshrined in them; and for your laughter, there is more human vitality in
the echoes of a sepulchre.
Ha! Come hither, thou full-hearted Hospitality! With the fine instinct of a gallant nature,
thou hast already apprehended the key to Punch's Christmas Volume ; dost know its inmost spirit, and wilt
laugh peals of laughter musical as marriage-bells.
Thy Christmas board shall smoke with plenty. Household cherubim shall nestle midst thy misletoe.
And wherefore? THOU HAST GIVEN—GIVEN. Thou mayest carve thy sirloin and turkey with a smiling face, for
thou hast made beef a visitor at the tables of the poor ; thou mayest eat a pound of pudding, and no crumb of
it shall lie heavily upon thy conscience or thy stomach. Thou mayest quaff thy glass to a happy New Year, nor
in thy forgetfulness of others blush to hope it; thou mayest, for thou art yet young enough, play merrily at
blindman's-buff, for thou art a true almoner to the hoodwinked goddess. Thy poorer neighbours, fed and
solaced by thee, thou mayest eat snap-dragon with thy little ones ; and whilst the lurid flames shall rise
about thee, thou needst not think of Dives in the fire; for thou—and may Peace and Plenty garland still thy
door-posts -thou hast comforted many a Lazarus !
And, moreover, thou mayest read Punch, who will-per printer-kiss thy hand; and, in the fullness of
a sincere soul, wish thee and thine-
A Happy, Happy Christmas--and a Merry, Merry New Year!

ACCORDING to the Eastern fable
A dancing Dervise most devout
Perceived how many were unable
Like him to “turn and wheel about ;"
(For by such whisky-frisky motion
He symbolised his deep devotion,
As many holding place and station
Evince their interest for our nation
By some such singular gyration);
And fearing from this want of capers
All Mussulmen would have the vapours,
Entreated Allah's aid to wake 'em,
And, like himself, all dancers make em.
Forth to the fields the spirit led
The worthy Dervise on the morrow,
Where six white cows were pasturèd,
That groan'd
And moan'd
As tho' from calves they'd browsed on sorrow;
Till one, a matriarchal cow
Perceived a berry-laden bough,
Anil having sniff'd and conn'd it over,
Munch'd the rich fruit, and lo! she trod
Like some young roe the verdant sod,
And leap'd about 'midst grass and clover.
The Dervise took the hint and fill'd
His wallet from the mirth-fraught bough,
And for the mournful soon distillid
The enlivening draught called COFFEE now.
Thus Momus, just two years ago
When visiting this world of woe,"
Saw with regret in ev'ry face
That mirth had fled the human race.
The statesman's brow was lined and leaden
By reading corn-law leaders daily;
The student's eyes were blear'd and deaden
By poring over Locke and Paley ;
Poor Beauty look'd just like a ghost
From Jenkins' twaddle in the Post,
Whilst in full many a face was seen
The work of 's Magazine.
Perceiving things were grown so bad,
Momus was for a moment sad ;
But soon his wit a plan devised
To scatter endless mirth around,
And on one morn the world surprised
By Punch, the witty, wise, profound !
Who still to keep mankind alive
Will (tho' the Queen WANTS AN ADVISER)
Indite (great boon!) this Volume Five,
And make you all grow fatter-wiser.

honeymoon. The bride's wardrobe had been conveyed there already, and
young Strelitz had arranged to have his carpet bag left at Kew Bridge,
where it was met by his Royal Highness's Lord of the Luggage, who
carried it to the palace. The village of Kew was of course a scene of
great festivity. Triumphal arches of evergreens had been erected at the
cost of the inhabitants. One tasteful design to do honour to the happy pair,
particularly struck us. It consisted of an arch of twine carried across the
road of the main street of Kew, by means of nails fixed into the walls of
the houses on either side of it. In the centre of the string there was tied
a moss rose and a lily, intended to be emblematical of union ; but the twine
had cut off the top of the lily, and there was only a stalk remaining.
The Duke of Cambridge behaved very liberally to the poor in the
neighbourhood ; and Strelitz senior gave away on the occasion—his eldest
son-a piece of munificence in every way worthy of Mecklenberg.

LINDA DI CHAMOUNI MADE EASY.
PROLOGUE.
SPIRIT of Jenkins, don't, oh ! don't refuse
To aid the efforts of mine humble Muse.
I sing the Opera ! I cannot boast
The feeling, force, or fancy of the Post.
But oh, if Jenkins will but smile or grin,
I will at once take courage and begin.
ACT THE FIRST.
The tuning is over, and Costa with grace
In the orchestra's centre ascends to his place;
And having mancuvred, by motions expert,
To settle the collar and cuffs of his shirt,
He strikes with his baton a small piece of tin,
The signal he gives to the band to begin.
The overture finished and when it is done
We know just as much as before 'twas begun-
The curtain ascends, and displays to the sight
Some mountains of rather contemptible height,
And across them a somewhat circuitous track
Of carpenters' platforms arranged at the back :
It seems like a valley of freedom and bliss,
For everything looks so exceedingly Swiss;
And enough has been done by the artist to gammon ye
Into thinking the scene is the Valley of Chamouni.
At first there is no one at all on the stage ;
But the public attention at once to engage,
There is suddenly heard in the distance a bell-
An incident (sure in an opera) to tell,
The audience think 'tis a clock-and devour
Its sounds with attention to find out the hour;
And, counting to twenty, at last are aware
It is n't a clock but a summons to prayer.
And if on the point there at first was a doubt,
'Tis quickly dissolved when a musical shout
But the hint is not taken, in spite of his art,
And the basso secondo proceeds with his part.
It seems he's a marquis, and in a few lines
Of asides he informs us of certain designs
That he has upon Linda—although he befriends
Her father and mother—at least he pretends.
In an aria buffa, he bustles about,
Then soon-and the sooner the better-goes out;
The chorus retire too-somehow or other,
So, likewise, do Linda's old father and mother :
Thus leaving the stage, as it ever should be,
For the heroine's entrance-most perfectly free.
Persiani has enter'd-if anything thaws
The cold aristocracy into applause
It is Persiani-whose affable smile
Can even Young* England's white waistcoats beguile.)
An air she commences-she's been to some spot
To meet with her lover—but somehow she's not ;
She calls him her Carlo—the name of a dog,
It's rather a puppyish sort of incog.
It seems he's a painter, with nothing to do-
Being never employ'd for a portrait or view;
Excessively poor-but yet, on the whole,
He's her anima's luce—the light of her soul.
The chorus re-enter, and raise a demand
For Pierolto, who happens to be close at hand :
It is the contralto Brambilla—dress'd out
As a Savoyard boy—but she's rather too stout.
They ask him to sing—and the very large lad
Proceeds with a strain that is pretty, though sad ;
And then with a feeling most natural, very,
Pierolto and chorus go off to be merry.
Now Linda 's alone-and of Carlo she talks,
When in, as a matter of course, Carlo walks ;
'Tis Mario, the tenor, who sings so prettily,
And whose father they say was a Marquis in Italy.
When together soprano and tenor once get,
There comes, as a matter of course, a duet.
Carlo says in his heart true affection 's a sediment,
But avows to their marriage there is an impediment.
What is it? asks Linda ; alas ! he can't say,
But nevertheless they keep singing away.
Affection unchanging they vow to each other,
Though Linda remarks she 's deceiving her mother.
Says Carlo, “ The mystery soon I 'll destroy,"
And the duo winds up with a movement of joy
So sparkling and gay that 'tis certain to charm ye,
And next day you'll be humming the A consolarmi.
They part, though no reason on earth one can see,
Why one exits P. S. and the other 0. P.
The stage once again being perfectly clear,
The Prefetto and Linda's old father appear;
A kind of duet on the instant ensues,
When the basses their voices in rivalry use ;
And in their contention they almost forget
They ought to be singing a friendly duet,
Intended to make Fornasari aware
That Lablache seeks to rescue his child from a snare;
He gets Fornasari to say she shall go
With a party of Savoyards, all through the snow.
She enters, embraces her father and mother,
Now hangs upon one-and now clings to the other ;
Of chorus invisible joins with the chime,
While a voice at the wing murmurs “ Pray keep your time."
At length from the cottage a lady emerges :
The audience on approbation just verges, I
But seeing 'tis only the second-rate donna,
Wet blankets of " hush,” Are at once thrown upon her ;
She sings a few bars, and by some mode or other,
We find she is Linda di Chamouni's mother
And when we consult the libretto, we learn
She's waiting her husband Antonio's return.
The violoncello and basses begin,
When the very identical husband walks in,
Who being in person commanding and stout,
Some think it's Lablache,-but they 're dreadfully out ;
And when contradicted, insist and declare,
It must be the fils if it is not the père.
But the truth they at last very shrewdly discover,'
That 'tis Fornasari, who's lately come over.
The singer repeats every sentence that's said
By the man with the coal-scuttle over his head.
So from one or the other we learn that the bass,
Like every stage father, is in a hard case ;
But all will be well, the wife ventures to say,
Expressing a hope in their home they shall stay.
So Fornasari her wishes professes to share,
Then winks at the band as a cue for his air.
In a movement andante he says that he'd rather
Remain in the house of his excellent father ;
His daughter was born there, his parents had died there,
Which makes him more anxious, of course, to reside there.
And the air he concludes with a clench of his hand,
Which the people applaud, if they don't understand.
Enter chorus, preceding a man, who looks “ Now
Good people, applaud me, I'm ready to bow."

Then runs to the foot-lights-a moment she kneels,
And unto the large chandelier she appeals.
The Savoyards— looking exceedingly nice
With sham hurdy-gurdies and real white mice,
Are seen on the mountain beginning to go,
And the curtain descends on a pretty tableau.
END OF ACT I.

JENKINS next speaks of his literary style,-perhaps the most

We deny the incoherency: the reports are perfect: we know

contemplate his readers fast asleep (not a very difficult stretch of the
imagination), and without a twinge of heart know that they will

THE PUSEY
6 POST.”
The parisli-clerk of Stoke Pogis is at the present time writing a
series of high-flown papers in the Post, called “Puseyism in London.”
The Post declares the writer to be a dignitary of the Church. We
know better. His name is Ebenezer Rogers, and, we say it, his
dwelling-place is Stoke Pogis. He has already given in his adhesion
to Puseyism, and cries “Amen!” in an embroidered corazza. Mark
how Rogers insists upon finery as an “instrumental part of religion.”
He is speaking of a London church “especially built for the wealthy."
He says :
“ No doubt the splendid long donations already made will be stigmatised as Puscyism.
Never mind; let Dissenters and Evangelicals run up their cheap preaching houses, but
let Churchmen still offer to God the best they can ; let them show, like the pious Mary,
the earnestness of their love by the costliness of their offerings.”
In the like strain Ebenezer goes on, pretending have found
amongst "the volumes of the Fathers” a pious exhortation to all
Christians to present to every parish-clerk, to show “the earnestness
of their love," a pair of silver buckles. Whether the Puseyites of
Stoke-Pogis will take the hint, we know not : the hint is, however,
well intended by Ebenezer.
A REMEDY FOR IRELAND.
“ Give an equality to the Irish Catholic Church with the Church
of England,” cry some, “ and that will be justice to Ireland.”
“ How can you give such equality," replies Lord Stanley, “without
admitting Catholic Bishops into the House of Lords ?” The difficulty
thus started by his lordship is at once put aside by the Bishop of
Exeter, who has favoured Punch with the subjoined :-
The Bishop of Exeter to Punch.
SIR,_Lord Stanley says it is impossible that the English and the Irish
Catholic Bishops can be equal, because Catholic Bishops couldn't sit in the House
I of Lords. Allow me, sir, on the part of many episcopal brethren and myself, to
state that the remedy of this evil may be immediate; that we can all be made
equal in this fashion :-as Catholic Bishops cannot be admitted into the House
of Lords, let the English Bishops immediately quit that honourable assembly.
My brethren and myself have very frequently felt that it would be more in
unison with our Christian character, were we to refrain from rumpling, and now
and then soiling, the episcopal lawn with, at times, the dirty work of law-
making, and that it would give us especial delight if we were permitted to con-
secrate all our time to the spiritual welfare of our flocks, rather than, as at the
present, rufling the otherwise peaceful tenor of our apostolic lives by dabbling in
matters that should be entirely left to the consideration of the “ignorant laity."
Your constant reader,
HENRY EXETER.
A Legend of the Thames.
The first of June was very fine,
The packet was to start at nino
For Margato and Herne Bay ;
A board my carpet-bag I throw,
The captain has exclaimed “ Let go!"
The craft is on her way.
A British tar is at the wheel :
I thought I saw a tear drop steal
Down from his houest eye ;
And as along his cheek it goes,
Pretending that lie blows his nose,
He wipes that tear-drop dry.
Perchance, thought I, that seaman bold,
If all his story could be told,
Has been a man of pain :
Perchance he's parted from a maid,
Whom he is very much afraid
He ne'er shall see again.
I spoke to him, he turned away ;
A sudden shout of “ Port, I say !"
Had cut his answer short.
I spoke again-the good old man
Into a brig our packet ran,
'Mid cries of ** Hard a-port !"
Amid the shaking and the shocks,
The captain on the paddle-box
His hold can hardly keep ;
The seaman with-the-tearful-eye,
Gets from the people standing by
Curses both loud and deep.
That seaman old I thus address-
“Speak, gallant tar, at once confess
The reason of that tear;
Art thou the victim, seaman bold,
Of love too tender to be told,
Or even whisper'd here ?"
I stood, and waited a reply-
The gallant seaman cock'd his eye,
And slowly turn'd about ;
I moved away—I did not dare
To press him—but resolved to bene
The agony of doubt.
On, on we go—we swiftly glide,
Aided alike by wind and tide,
By current and by breeze ;
The stoker 's on the active stoke,
The funnel issues clouds of smoke,
The boiler seems to wheeze.
Away-where Deptford's famous Creek
Of many a legend perhaps might speak,
If it possess'd a tongue ;
On-on beyond the Woolwich heights
Where the Artillery in sham fights
Go with their guns—bang-bung !
And now we pass the well-known Fort,
Where famed Elizabeth stopp'd short
When she went forth to meet
Without a single woman's fear-
(She of her troops was in the rear)
The dreadful Spanish fleet.
Where is the gallant seaman now,
Who lately at the vessel's prow
Guided the pliant wheel ?
Has he, unhappy child of earth!
Gone down below into his berth
To think-to weep-to feel ?
I'll go, and cheer that weeping man-
Soothe his affliction if I can-
Such was my sudden thought ;
In the fore cabin he was found,
Intoxicated 'pon the ground,
Aud muttering-" Port there, Port."
Royalty, and Native Talent.
It is gratifying to find at all the concerts lately given at the Palace, her
Majesty has been pleased to command that English singers and English
music alone should form the programme-a regulation which has given
the most heartfelt satisfaction to all, and must confer the greatest benefit
upon our native vocalists and composers. At the last Royal réunions,
Mesdames Alfred Shaw, Birch, Dolby, Rainforth, &c., and Messrs. Hobbs,
Phillips, Parry, Harrison, &c., had the honour of singing ; the selection
being made from the works of our leading British musicians. Not one
foreigner was engaged ; and the result is that our English opera appears in
a brighter position than it has been for many years. Let her Gracious
Majesty proceed as she has done hitherto, and she will have the gratifica-
tion of seeing to what a state she will ultimately bring it.
The papers state that the Queen was present at M. Bouffé's benefit.
This, we believe, to have been a mistake, as her Majesty has only been
once to any theatre employing a foreign company during three or four
years ; whilst her constant attendance at Covent Garden and Drury Lane,
as accurately reported in Punch, have shown that she was determined to
patronise the artists and productions of her country.
OUR INDIAN MAIL.
OUR Overland despatch, in anticipation of the Bombay Broad-wheeled
Waggon, and forwarded by the Tahiti Parcels Delivery Company, has
just arrived by the Turnham-green carrier. Seedy Mohammed had
resigned his pretensions in favour of Meer Row, and, after a long con-
versation with Sheer Jaw, had left the frontier. The Great Khan had
been throwing cold water on the projects of his party, and all the
Mohammeds, but particularly Dust, had been humbled to the earth by
what the Khan had let drop on the occasion. The Rajah Poore had been
trying to borrow money everywhere, without success; and having at
length retired for the night, laid down his arms and legs-with full depen-
dence on the Ottoman.

SUGGESTIONS FOR CARTOONS.
() 2 ไร.
The great fault of the Cartoons is that their subjects are not of
the present day; and, therefore, it is impossible that the artists can
have trusted to anything but “ imagination for their facts," which
need not have been the case had they chosen to illustrate some
events of every-day occurrence.
We beg leave to suggest a few “ topics” which would have
possessed interest not only for posterity but for ourselves, as well as
—to use an Irishism-for those who have preceded us.
Cartoon One.


THE DISCONTENTED BARONS.
invoking vengeance from the skies, which open, displaying a figure
of Baron Nathan in the form of Harmony playing on his violin, and
pointing over the remains of a Roman Temple to the ruins of Tivoli.
Cartoon Six
BURKE IN THE ARMS OF VICTORY.
DEAF BURK
This celebrated shaksperian pugilist reclining in a state of insen-
sibility in the arms of his bottle-holder, who is applying the contents
of the vessel which he holds in his hand to the lips of the battered
hero.
Cartoon Two.


THE CONQUEST OF TIME.
Time having swallowed everything else, opens his jaws to receive
Widdecomb, who stands in an attitude of defiance, pointing to the
still unfinished Suspension Bridge at Hungerford.
FAME JAPANNING THE SHIELD OF BRITANNIA.
Fame polishing the shield of Britannia with a bottle of Japan
blacking. Time, just before day. Style, after Martin.
Cartoon Three.
KING ARTHUR'S COURT!
CARTOON, No. IV.
This Cartoon is in the very highest style of historical art. It may
be called—emphatically called—of the grand school ; and magnifi-
cently embodies the principal persons of King Arthur's Court, treated
of at great length by Merlin, to whom we owe that exquisite stanza,
“ When Arthur first in Court began
To wear long-hanging sleeves,
He entertained three serving-men,
And all of them were thieves !"
Punch-who, though under another name, was contemporary with
the hero, pronounces the portrait of Arthur to be perfect; as for the
likenesses of the “ thieves, his serving-men,” why, Punch leaves that
point to be settled by millions of beholders.

LINDA DI CHAMOUNI MADE EASY.
He curtain ascends for beginning Act Two,
When some beautiful scenery bursts on the view.
The flat, representing a splendid saloon,
Has a window in centre, through which peeps the moon;
For the splendid saloon, with its sofas and chairs,
Is a private apartment up four pair of stairs.
So much for the scenery,—now for the plot:
Enter Linda, deck'd out in a beautiful shot,
A robe of rich satin, with toilelle en suite,',
Which it seems she has gain'd by her songs in the street;
From which it appears that in Paris the trade,
By which the most rapidly fortunes are made,
Is that of itinerant vocalisation,
Which in London oft ends in a walk to “the station."
And, rather than grief in his bosom should fester,
He calls out for death in a voce di testa :
Of life his farewell he seems willing to take,
And gives on addio a delicate shake.
The passage is managed with exquisite skill ;
And Linda-acquainted with Mario's trill-
Let's him hold it as long as he's able to do,
Awaiting its finish to take for her cue ;
And then she comes on--and declares that her heart
Had told her to come-but, in fact, it's her part.
She says, 'tis affection that prompts her-but, pooh !
'Tis the man in the bonnet-box gives her the cue.
Some recitative ineffective succeeds,
Which soon to a charming adagio leads ;
And speedily into a movement they get
of another exceedingly pretty duett.
He asks for a kiss—in a very shrill note,
Sustain’d by a desperate strain of the throat;
While she, with a shake of a minute or so,
Says something or other intended for “ Nó!"
When Mario, with an affectionate shout,
Belabours his breast with his fist-and goes out.
She turns to look round, and there bursts on her eye
The forın of a shabby old Savoyard guy,
Who at Linda don't look, but begins to accost her
In the phrase of a regular begging impostor;
And who, if in London caught out in the fact,
Would clearly be liable under the Act,
That would make but short work of the airs and duelli
Which Maestro Il Cavaliere Donizetti
(The Act to the deuce determined to fling.)
Has given the “sturdy old beggar" to sing.
It seems that the vagrant's respectable rather,
And is in reality Linda's own father ;
Who, having come down to his very last legs,
Walks smack into people's apartments, and begs.
His daughter knows him, but know her he does not,
Because she's disguised in the beautiful shot."
(A stage father his daughter forgets in a minute,
If a new gown she wears, and he's ne'er seen her in it.)
She says 't is herself, but the obstinate fellow
That it is n't, perversely continues to bellow ;
When Pierotto, with grief on his visage, walks in,
To put for a moment an end to the din.
He comes to announce, that where he has been
A splendid “to-do ” for a marriage he's seen.
But the bridegroom was Linda's young man, to another
Compelled to get wed by his absolute mother.
Poor Linda is struck with surprise ; but the worst
Is her newly-found father's damnatory burst;
For 'tis with theatrical parents a trick
To give to a daughter that's down a last kick.
She wildly resorts to the usual pleas,
of bolding hard on by the calves and the knees ;
He clenches his fist, then commences to tear
The voice of Pierotto is heard at the wing,
As if in the streets just beginning to sing.
Says Linda, “ Admit him !" --she spoke to the air;
But, lo ! on the instant, Pierotto is there.
And as the apartment is four stories high,
"Twould seem that Pierotto's been learning to fly.
He gazes at Linda, examines her gown,
Looks up to her face, to her stockings looks down,
The quality feels of the beautiful shot,
“ Is it Linda ? ah ! no, it is not.
It can't-yes, it is no, it never can be !
Yet, ah !_no, impossible !-yes, it is she !"
Pierotto declares he's been hungry and cold,
When Linda immediately offers him gold,
Pierotto's surprised, and requests to be told
How Linda has gained such profusion of gold.
“The painter,” says she, “who has after me run,
Of a Marchioness noble and great is the son ;
Whatever around the apartment you see
Belongs to my husband—that soon is to be.”
Pierotto inquires, exactly in tune,
If the wedding's about to be solemnised soon?
When Linda-just after a change in the key-
Replies, that 'tis very soon likely to be.
Pierotto and Linda then swear to each other
They 'll always continue like sister and brother ;
Forgetting the son of the Marchioness, p'rhaps,
May n't take such a fancy to Savoyard chaps,
As to recognise one, for the rest of his life,
As his brother-in-law by the side of his wife.
A moment Pierotto has scarcely been gone,
When the Marquis—the basso secondo-comes on.
A short agitato is play'd by the band,
To show that there's not a domestic at hand,
And also implying that Linda to undo,
Is the motive no doubt of the basso secondo.
She says that she spurns him, and threatens to call
And says,

Her servants from out of the kitchen or hall ;
But ne'er were two persons in opera yet
So unfriendly as not to get through a duett.
He offers her splendour-she taunts him with age,
And works herself into a virtuous rage.
Having said all he can first to melt, then to goad her,
The Marquis withdraws to a blustering coda.
Linda also retires--and Carlo comes in
At a signal from Costa, who taps on the tin.
Then Mario warbles a beautiful bar
About the revenge of his cruel mamma,
Who, finding to Linda his faith has been plighted,
Resolves to another to get him united :
He curses his fate in a charming falsetto,
Gives
way to despair in a voce di pello;
The property wig, representing his hair ;
But finding he drags it completely askew,
Perceives such emotion as that will not do ;
And, pretending to wipe the big tears from his face,
He slily arranges his wig to its place,
And, kicking a handkerchief out of his path,
He darts from the stage in a whirlwind of wrath.
Pierotto and Linda are now left alone ;
The former is anxious at once to be gone :
The latter stares wildly, and utters a burst
of the pretty duett that was heard in Act First ;
Then proof of the falsehood of Carlo requires,
Denouncing mankind as a parcel of liars !
Pierotto looks mournfully off at the side,
And says that the bridegroom is leading the bride ;

knot is insupportable. Unless you do me justice, I shall be compelled to
throw up a very excellent situation, change my name, and quit the country:
We have received a letter, which, with the characteristic justice Will you then, sir, oblige me by informing the world, that whoever the
of Punch, is herewith presented to the reader. It is a letter from JENKINS may be who writes in the Post, it is not
" Your obedient Servant,
“ NATHANIEL JENKINS.
“ P.S.-Allow me to add, Mr. Punch, that I am ratber surprised a
man of your liberality should sneer at the condition of a footman. Is my
namesake in the Post the worse for a livery!- I think not."
NATHANIEL JENKINS is a very decent, sensible fellow, and
had his unfortunate namesake written as good English as our
correspondent, why, the critic Jerkins-poor cockchafer !-
would never have been impaled upon the iron pen of Punch.
But Nathaniel must not misunderstand us. We do not sneer
at the livery that encases the corporal part of JENKINS. Not
that his body, but that his soul is in livery, are we compelled
to flog him with nettle-tops. Yes : his soul ! Look, reader :
peep in at the brain of JENKINS (you must use a glass, by the
way, of great magnifying power). There, perched on pia mater,
is what certain anatomists call the soul. With different men
it takes different shapes. In the brain of Jenkins it is shaped
like a Lilliput monkey, and there it sits, like the larger monkeys
on the barrel-organs of those pedestrian virtuosi (as JENKINS
himself would say) who grind you off hap'orths of Mozart or
DONIZETTI. There is the monkey-soul of JENKINS! And see
you not his nether monkey, glowing in red plush? That is
JENKINS' soul in full livery ; and for that soul, so habited, we
must (it is a public duty) continue to flog JENKINS.
Within these few days, JENKINS has had the audacity to give
his opinion on the proper position and requisite beverage of a
gentleman. He says :
“We believe that a man of genius may be seen arm-in-arm with a gentleman,
without any derogation from his intellectual elevation, and that it is somewhat
more respectable for him to take his glass of sherry at his club in respectuble
society, than to frequent taverns in very questionable company."
This is all very well, JENKINS, about the glass of sherry.
It is pretty upon paper ; but it is not the belief of Jenkins.
No, no : he tastes not sherry: he writes not “ too well,” as he
always does, upon sherry; but owes his nerve to plebeian half-
and-half. All his beautiful flowers of speech are raised in good,
honest pewter. Do they not smack of Barclay-have they not
the aroma of Perkins ?
JENKINS now comes to female society; and, considering the
hours he has, in his time, waited at Howell & James's, he must
be allowed to know something of the matter. He says :-
“Nor do we believe that refined female society will injure his intellect, any more
han we imagine that a first-rate coat will crook his spine.”
Jenkins has a painful recollection of a certain coat. He
remembers, in his early footman life, when he was compelled

The curtain is up for beginning Act Third;
And, first, there's a chorus of villagers heard.

But now, on the platform arranged at the back,
Intended to picture a mountainous track,

Some words are to Linda addressed by Pierotto.

Who, they say, o'er the mountain begiu to appear.
The party expected are soon on the stage,
And all in a chorus together engage.
The Savoyards all have come back, and, 'tis strange,
The children have not undergone any change ;
And by their acquaintances quickly are known,
Because in their absence they've not at all grown.
They hint that they mean to adjourn for a dance,
When the worthy Prefetto is seen to advance.
He says, what a pity misfortunes should hinder
Her parents distracted from welcoming Linda,
Who it seems-although really she merits it not
Has a character shocking in Chamouni got.
Then Carlo appears, and declares with a start,
He's dreadfully eager to open his heart ;
And then, that the task may an easy one be
The leader obligingly gives him the key-
When he opens his heart—though it must be confess'd
In a manner more likely to open his chest ;
For he throws back his arms, now this side now t'other,
And swears that at last he's come over his mother,
Who with Linda has yielded consent to his wedding.
(What capital news to the “furniture, bedding,
Appears to remind the poor thing of her mother;
From which we infer that the voice of mamma
Was like the bass string of a damaged guitar.
The magistrate enters, and seeing her sad,
He makes up his mind that of course she is mad.
“Her paleness would show it,” says he. (What inanity !
Is chalk on the cheeks inconsistent with sanity ?)
She talks incoherently now of the wedding,
(Ah, still there is hope for the Warehouse for Bedding !
For Linda and Carlo, though long they may tarry,
Are “persons about,” as the cart says, “to marry.")
Now Carlo comes in with a deed in his hand,
By which he in form has conveyed all his land,
In a generous fit more good-hearted than clever,
To Linda, “ her heirs, exors. admors. for ever.'
The father and mother have also come in,
Who to reason their daughter endeavour to win;
But they dismally fail in whatever they do,
With the laudable object of bringing her to ;]
Till Linda herself gives a hint, the duett
Of A Consolarmi may cure her e'en yet."
The moment to Carlo's remembrance she brings it,
Of course in the handsomest manner he sings it.
She's cured in an instant—the chorus prepare
The joy of the lovers and parents to share.
The heroine rushes to one, then the other ;
She clings to her father, she kisses her mother ;
Embraces Pierotto, and wonder comes o'er us.
To see her shake hands with the men in the chorus,
Who seem overcome by the very great honour
Of a grasp from the hand of the great prima donna ;
And some, not aware if they really may take it,
When she proffers her hand, are unwilling to shake it ;
While others, delighted the fingers to clasp,
Overdo it, and keep them too long in their grasp.
Then Linda, who's anxious to know if she dreams,
Gives one of the regular opera screams,
Which all prima donnas are used to employ,
When they wish to denote the excess of their joy.
The lovers declare that most plainly they see,
For them will the earth an Elysium be ;
A similar view is expressed by their friends
In a chorus, and Linda di Chamouni ends.

Having given of rapture a musical scream,
Across Carlo's senses it happens to gleam
That ere he can marry he needs must look round
And see if his wife after all can be found.
He asks the Prefetto-who like a true bass,
Who delights to make always the worst of the case,
Declares, with an ominous shake of the head,
That Linda-poor Linda-alas ! she is dead.
“What! dead ?” bellows Carlo. The bass makes reply,
(For he seems half ashamed of the double base lie)
" She's dead to the family-ruin'd in fame,
And that (as I take it) and death are the same."
But Carlo don't fancy such reason as that,
And asks where she is—when the tin goes rat tat ;
And the tenor and bass without further delay
Are in a duetto heard singing away.
Poor Carlo his anguish and science displays,
He talks in roulades about ending his days ;
And then by an effort of holding his breath,
He makes a long shake upon “ Linda or Death."

take it away from the lower classes—the
tailors, shoemakers, and their “frowzy
dames," as that naughty man of the people,
Jenkins, calls them,--and make it, like
turtle and pine-apples, the exclusive enjoy-
ment of the rich. The “Church Digni-
tary,” as the Post calls Ebenezer Rogers,
the Stoke Pogis clerk, has been at it again.
This is a bit of his last visit to a certain
chapel (not named) -
“I was struck with one thing which I observed at the
chapel this morning: the plate, which was handed
round for the collection of alms, contained a number of
little packets. These I found, on inquiry, were offer-
ings for particular purposes. Some of them contained
several sovereiyns, which the donors desired might be
devoted to particular charities—as, for instance, a contribution to the bishopric of Tas-
mania or New Zealand, or for one of the Church Societies, or for some sick person, to
whom the donor wished in this manner to communicate his aid."
If packets of sovereigns (what fever of liberality has seized the
aristocracy ?) were really given for a sick person, we trust that some
of the money will be handed over to Jenkins, for, poor wretch! he
is very bad indeed.
Packets of sovereigns ! But Rogers has the jaundice, and thus to
his eyes even copper seems gold.
JENKINS!
Sad is the spirit of Jenkins ! Fading-fading is the bouquet in
his button-hole ! His face wears the livery of woe : sallow his cheeks,
turned up with nose of blue ! And wherefore,
dear JENKINS? Alas! the world is about to

THE NINTH LABOUR.-HOW HERCULES OBTAINED A GIRDLE WHICH
APPERTAINED TO ROYALTY.

HIRTEEN
A DAY
HIPPOLYTA, Queen of the Amazons, and afterwards (according to
Shakspere) Duchess of Athens, had a girdle, which was called the girdle
of Mars. Hippolyta and her subjects were military and masculine ladies :
this girdle, therefore, was probably like a soldier's belt ; and her Majesty
when she wore it must have looked very much like Mr. Liston as “Moll
Flagon.' The ninth labour imposed upon Hercules by Eurystheus, was
to get possession of this accoutrement for his daughter Admeta : a service
of danger ; for every individual of the Amazons was a regular Joan of
Arc, or Maid of Saragossa ; and they were regarded as the Invincibles of
their day. However, Hercules got the girdle.
There was also a certain girdle with which the Sovereign of England,
whether king or queen, was invested as the Head of the Executive. For
a royal cincture it was a very unpretending looking thing. It was no
silk or satin sash, embroidered, studded with gems, and fastened with a
hot
gold buckle. No. It was just such a girdle as a friar might have worn;
in fact it was made of hemp. And it is proper to state, that the monarch
only wore it in theory; for whatever difference of opinion may have
existed as to its utility, no one would have regarded it as ornamental.
Strange to say, however, it was actually worn occasionally by the subject,
ed
though never more than once by the same individual ; and it then served
not for a girdle, but for a necklace.
This girdle, also, may be said to have been the girdle of Mars, for Mars
was the god of hangmen. In a word, it was—the HALTER.
Hercules, who looked at the world and events with the eye of the mind,
went one day to the Court of Buckingham Palace. Around him were
rank, splendour, and beauty. Uniforms, orders, stars, crosses, feathers,
were glowing, glittering, waving about on every side. Eyes, brighter
than the diamonds which encircled the brows above them, were radiating
in all directions. Perfumes loaded the air. On her throne, pre-eminent
over this scene of magnificence, sat the young and lovely Queen of
England. She wore, to ordinary eyes, what seemed to be merely the
Order of the Garter ; but to those of Hercules, it was accompanied by
that of the Halter, which he thought exceedingly ugly. He knew that it
had not been put on by her own royal hands, nor by the delicate fingers
of the ladies of the bed-chamber; that Her Gracious Majesty was not
aware that she was wearing it, and that if she were so, she would be
exceedingly glad to get rid of it. He therefore resolved to divest her
fair form of this unbecoming decoration.
The Halter was a trapping with which Royalty had been embellished
by Law. It was a contrivance for the protection of life and property;
but not having been found practically to accomplish the latter object, it
had been, after a long series of unsuccessful experiments, abandoned as
far as that was concerned, and was now no longer employed to deter a
famishing wretch from purloining a few shillings, or feloniously walking
off with a lamb. It was still resorted to, however, as a preventive against
murder, on that truly homeopathic principle, “Similia similibus curan-
tur;" whereon “ one fire burns out another's burning." But Legislation
and Quackery were closely akin in those days.
All that Hercules had to do, was to procure the repeal of the enact-
ments which maintained the Halter. But this was no easy matter. The
Halter had many friends and supporters who considered it essential to
the existence of society. Some of them venerated it as an ancient and
time-honoured appendage to the glorious constitution ; and not a few
regarded it with interest as a property appertaining to the tragic drama
of life, the decline of which, they, in their hearts, would have been sorry
to behold. So the hero, in the accomplishment of this labour, encoun-
tered much opposition.
Among the articles of the popular creed, was one which inculcated the
duty of returning good for evil, and which distinctly repudiated the
maxim of “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Hercules de-
manded what difference there was between morality for the mass, and two of ragamuffins at his heels, all ready to enlist.“ Death ør Victory

The Queen's State Visit to the Opera.
The Opera-house, on the occasion of her Majesty's
state visit, was not nearly so full as Drury Lane had
been, a little while before, on a similar occasion. This
is very easily accounted for. The Queen at Drury Lane
was a novelty indeed, but the Queen at the Opera is
almost an every day occurrence. An English theatre
was such an uncommon place for the sovereign to be
found in, that the public flocked to see her there ; but
it was quite a common-place business when her Majesty
visited the Opera.
A New Creation.
The Watermen's wooden structure at Greenwich has
at length been regularly admitted to the recognised Peer-
age of Great Britain, the Lord Mayor having allowed
its claim to the title of Barren of Nuisance. The objec-
tion urged against the recognition of the new Pier was
the fact of its being made of wood; but this surely shows
a relationship' to some, at least, of the heads of the
aristocracy. The Court at which the claim was con-
ceded was appropriately held at the Crown and Sceptre
- to which the Lord Mayor generally rushes, in default
of a real crown and sceptre, when he has to act in the
capacity of civic sovereign. The Pier could not boast of
the Pearls to be found in an Earl's coronet ; but some
early Purl was procured on the following morning in

The following is too amusing to be lost :-
A gentleman who was seated in the centre of the room interrupted Lord Stuart, and
asked in a very loud tone of voice whether Mr. Buckingham had not, in his book on
Palestine, used Lord Valentia's plates ?
Lord Brougham, who sat next the chairman, and Mr. Buckingham, simultaneously
replied “No.' The gentleman having still looked rather sceptically, Lord Brougham,
in a very angry and loud tone, reiterated, “No, I say no; do you understand that ?-
(Laughter.) You have got your answer. Mr. Buckingham says No too-(Laughter.)
What more do you want :-(Laughter.) No, no, no; do you understand that ?"-
(Laughter).
The gentleman who had originally put the question said he understood sufficiently
what "no" meant, and asked his lordship whether he did ?-(Laughter and confusion.)
Lord Brougham (passionately): “Why, the man is mad—(Laughter). Do you hear,
sir? You put a question, and we say 'no;' that is your answer, -no; can you under.
stand that? No! I say, no."
The former speaker: “ I am very glad to hear it.”.
Lord Brougham (angrily): ."We don't care whether you are or not."-(Laughter).
From the foregoing, one would' fancy that Lord Brougham was
full of the milk of human kindness, but that the warmth of the room
had turned it excessively sour.

The court is crowded-on the bench is seen
England's Vice-Chancellor, with brow serene ;
Within the bar silk-gownsmen strongly muster,
While in back rows the juniors thickly cluster-
Hoping some miracle may perhaps have sent
A stray half-guinea motion to consent ;
But few, alas ! are destined yet to see
Even the colour of the casual fee.
Now, from the foremost bench, behold arise
A learned man-in counsel
Sensation through the throng'd assembly ran

The fame of Punch to sully and abuse,
By pirating his form and brow serene,
Giving his countenance to things unclean.”
No more the learned man had cause to speak-
For indignation blanched his honour's cheek.
“ Shall Punch,” said he,“ be thus dishonour'd !-Oh,
Thus from the judgment-seat, I answer—No.

After this date, we find him a sojourner in the then-existing Fleet
Prison; and his residence therein appears to have thrown him into the
society of several distinguished people. A letter, dated “ Coffee Gallery,
No. 19," runs as follows. It is evidently in his own handwriting, and the
signature exactly corresponds to one appended to an inquest jury list, upon
which he served as foreman :-
“ Dear Snell,
“Here I am at last crib'd as right as ninepence. Come down and see us, and bring
Tom and Wiggy, also some gin and cigars. Get a flat bottle and put it in your great-
coat pocket, and drop a penny, which makes more noise than a shilling, into the turn-
key's box. I shall have some fine chicks in my room on Sunday.
“ Yours ever
"JOHN Jones."
The latter part of this epistle is somewhat ambiguous, as not clearly
pointing out whether Mr. Jones meant visitors or poultry that he had
assembled for the gratification of his friends. A little light is, however,
thrown on the mystery, by an entry made in his pocket-book of that day,
in which we see this memorandum :-
“ June 10.- Tom and Wiggy came-asked Peck and Chaffy to meet them. Didn't
hear the quarter to nine bell, and got locked in. Wiggy slept in the wardrobe, and Tom
under the table."
It was subsequent to this period that Jones began his theatrical career.
In a prompter's book, attached to one of the minor theatres, in the De-
cember of the same year, there is an entry to the effect that he was too
late to deliver a message ; and a corresponding fine is discovered in the
treasury account of the same week, on the Saturday morning. He seems
to have borne his reverses with great good humour however, for we find
him on that same evening singing a comic song for a benefit concert at the
Bower Saloon, where his name appears in big letters on the bill—a star
in the hemisphere of Stangate.

as there were only two inside places, the Prince mounted the box with
great good humour and alacrity, preceded to the omnibus by the Lascar

the other side of the way. His royal highness wore the collar and cuffs
of renovation, and upon taking his seat was invested by the driver with
the apron of his order, after the cushions of state had been turned upside
down for his convenience.
The royal party stopped at the White Horse Cellar for ten minutes, to
inspect the plaster model in the window, and the various specimens of
tea in the Chinese collection of Mr. Decastro, which are liberally exhibited
gratuitously to the public by the proprietor. They then started off again,
being driven at a very slow pace along the Strand, for the purpose of
allowing his Royal Highness an opportunity of being seen by the passers-
by, as they successively overtook the vehicle.
On entering Guildhall they were received by the various Boards of
Repairs collected on the occasion. The Duke, who is particularly fond
of architecture, was struck forcibly by several of the arrangements ; as
well as the readiness of the English to come down with the dust upon all
occasions where foreigners are concerned. On arriving opposite Gog
and Magog, as it wanted only five minutes to one, the Duchess requested
the illustrious others to remain and see them come down to dine when they
heard the clock sound the hour.

expressed a wish to look at the autograph of Shakspere, but on being told
it was enclosed in an iron-safe, being seldom asked for on account of the
disrepute into which Shakspere's writings altogether had lately fallen,
more especially with royalty. The illustrious party then wrote their
names upon one of the monuments, with the usual anxiety of foreigners to
imitate English customs, that the aldermen might know they had been

Mrs. Traply looked at the Dutch clock—"at this very moment, they're
taking their last sup at the Pound. Ha ! there's the trial, my love."
Patty trembled from head to foot, and I could see her small hands
work convulsively-could see the fighting of her heart to keep the
terror down, as Mrs. Traply, for the kindest purpose, as she thought,
painted the horrors of the death-journey from Newgate to Tyburn.
“ You don't know what it is, child, or you wouldn't talk in that
way. Ha ! my dear, it's very different to going with a party, and
sitting at a window to see the poor things in the cart, and being one
of 'em, you know. Innocence, my dear, is all very well ; but I don't
know any innocence that could bear to be stared at by thousands of

went like a knife into his heart-and how as the cart rumbled along,
he prayed for the stones to open and bury him—and how when he
got to Tyburn, ha ! my dear, he was proved as innocent as you are,
and yet he felt all this—and how, as I was saying, when he got to
Tyburn-but you don't listen to me?”
The woman spoke the truth ; for Patty had sunk beneath the
struggle of her feelings, and lay insensible in the chair.

POLITICAL LEADER.
The attempt to convert the out-pensioners of Chelsea Hospital into
warriors is one of the wildest designs ever undertaken by a inisguided
ministry. It is true that, in the agricultural districts the Chelsea pen-
sioners—or at least, their effigies—are used as a standing army of light
scarecrows, to preserve the crops ; but to think of trusting these worn-
out veterans with real guns, shows the insanity to which folly may drive a
desperate Government.
It is a well-known maxim in ethics that “ right 's right, anyhow;" and
this beautiful doctrine has always been our guide, when contending fac-
tions have been snatching at the banner of the Constitution—a banner
which we have often saved from their grasp by lifting up the pole-we
allude, of course, to the public press—that is attached to it. But if we
have been irritated on other occasions, where shall we find bounds to our
anger now? If we have written in gall before, we ought now to dip our
pen in the essential oil of vitriol.
Pat arms into the hands of the Chelsea pensioners, forsooth! Why, it
would be much better to put legs-wooden ones we mean-into those
stumps which they are now called upon to stir at the bidding of a per-
plexed Government. When we look at Chelsea Hospital, our heart
always beats quicker, our pulse throbs more frequently, and the blood of
patriotism dances more vividly in our very veins ; but now that the
out-veterans of that fine asylum are to be called once more into active
service, we shall blush for ourselves, to think that our posterity will find

The tea—the tea--the grateful tea,
The black—the green— the strong Bohea ;
Where by a mark—its price is found
It runneth from three-and-six a pound.
When mixed with the sloe, it cheats our eyes,
And like a wicked creature lies.
I like the tea : I like the tea,
And drinking it I would ever be ;
With the green above and the black below,
And hot water wheresoe'er I go.
If at night I should wish awake to keep,
What matter?_with tea I cannot sleep.
What matter, &c.
I love-Oh how I love to drain
The foaming teacup again and again,
When its heat makes warm the silver spoon,
And the kettle whistles its grateful tune.
I ne'er heard a man for brandy roar,
But my tea I fancied more and more ;
And off to my favourite chest I ran
Like a bailiff that fiercely seeketh his man :
And a bailiff it was, and is to me,
For I'm always very much taken-by tea.
The milk was callid at early morn
In the sober hour when I was born;
The grocers whistled-so much they sold,
And the Twinings took ten pounds in gold ;
And never was heard such laughter wild
As welcomed to life the young Hyson child.
I have lived since then in calm and strife
A regular milk-and-watery life.
With cash to spend on gin or grog,
I never took aught but tea with my prog:
And Death, whene'er he comes to me,
Shall find me-over a cup of tea.

The championship of the Strand was last week contended for by two
Blackwall and Mile End omnibuses. Betting had been 2 to 1 on Mile
End, but at starting Blackwall was the favourite. They had often run
against each other before, and Blackwall had been backed against Mile
End, on more than one occasion. Blackwall went off with the lead, when
Mile End suddenly shot a-head, but they were axletree and axletree as
they passed the Punch-office. Soames, the conductor of Blackwall,
kept slamming the door, which is the usual signal for the horses to go on;
but the driver of Mile End, trusting to the breeding of the team, kept
inciting them to “go along," while he backed his own suggestion by
sawing at their mouths, and applying the whip with vehemence. While
the race was at its highest point of interest, Blackwall moved to the right
ard Mile End turned to the left, so that the championship of the Strand is
still undisposed of.

STATISTICAL SOCIETY.
That most indefatigable member of society in general, and of the
Twaddle-and-Squat Society in particular-Professor Porsoff, has for the
last six months been unremitting in his exertions to procure the following
statistics, which he begs to communicate to the world at large, and more
especially, to that intellectual and enlightened portion of the community-
the readers of Punch.
Statistics of Sticks.
(ABRIDGED from Professor Porsoff's own Report.)
I (says the Professor) have stationed myself, day by day, for the last
six months, on London Bridge, during the hours 9, 10, 11, A. M., and 3, 4,
and 5, P m., and have carefully noted the following interesting phenomena
connected with the walking-sticks and their possessors, that daily pass
over that great thoroughfare.
In the first place, by a rough calculation, we find that the total number
of sticks that passed over during that period was 1,490,720, thus giving a
weekly average of 62,113,4 ; of these 62,113} sticks, 22,94277 are oak
saplings ; 14,871 are veritable bamboo ; 9752 are undoubtable blackthorn;
8864-80 are acknowledged Malaccas ; 411412 were a heterogenous col.
lection of sticks of all denominations, known and unknown ; the material
of the remaining 15681120 was unable to be distinguished at such a
cursory view,
We have ascertained in the next place that, of the 62,113, , possessors
of these sticks, 18,91711 have some defect of locomotion ; 641213 are af-
flicted with disease of the organs of vision ; 11,431-41 are boys under
17 years of age, and 11,75468 are men under 5 feet 6 inches, and
10,461:217 being principally the holders of the oak saplings ; thus leaving
a remainder of 3136 ; of which, on inquiry, 972 were found to be tag ;
999 rag; and 1165 bobtail.
Several other walking-sticks of a peculiar species were also observed ;
generally speaking, they were carried between two young ladies, or
revelled in the luxuries of wash, woodstock, and patent leather.

other liquor !
Such, indeed, may be the thought of the foolish and unreflecting !
But, indeed, it was otherwise, as we have been minutely informed
by our own reporter ;" an intelligence, which, regardless of ex-
pense, we engaged under the express contract that he would be in
every needful place at one and the same moment. Hence we learn
that when Father Mathew stept from the railway carriage, the
engine, as with a mighty and rejoicing expansion of heart, puffed
and snorted like a dragon at gambols, and the steam rose and rose
above the Father's head, and, catching the sun's rays, shone as a
magnificent rainbow over him! And this was a proper homage of
water to water's own apostle.
And then, says our reporter, all the members of the English
episcopacy presented themselves to the Father, and pledged him
one and all-in a bumper from the flowing spring; and the Arch-
bishop of CANTERBURY begged that Father MATHEW would send
his luggage to Lambeth, whilst the Bishop of LONDON hoped he
should be honoured with it at Fulham; and at length there was a
complete struggle and scramble among the bishops for the carpet-
bag of Father Mathew, who, with the sweetest smile, declined
every invitation, observing that he had already taken apartments at
the sign of the Dewdrop, a Temperance tavern.
And whilst all this was going on at the station, many and curious
were the evidences, far and away throughout London, of the influ.
ence of Father MATHEW's advent! In a thousand shops ginger-
beer corks went off with loud report-fit ordnance to salute the
coming of the Priest of Temperance—and the white milk-like fluid,
from tens of thousands of bottles, played and played, as upon holi-
days play the fountains at Versailles ! And again, in the cellar of
many a Gin-palace, there was a deep, a thunder-groan, as of the
burst heart of Bacchus! And the Gin-palace King trembled in his
bar throne—and his fainting Queen screeched for peppermint-and
many of the little Juniper Princes and Princesses sucked their
thumbs in growing wonder and dismay! In these places, smitten by
quick despair-the list of bankrupts burning their wild eyes—three
publicans swallowed coculus indicus, grains of paradise, and other con-
diments intended for their customers.

Rom the interest which the proceedings of this
extraordinary personage have created, all over
the country, a very attractive subject has been
thrown open for the majority of our dramatists,
who, for some time past, have been in a sadly un-
employed condition. Shoals of pieces founded on
the riots of South Wales, in which the ringleader
forms, of course, the principal character, have
been sent in to the various managers, and
through their kindness, by reason of the honour-
able estimation in which Mr. Punch is held by
them, we are enabled to gratify our readers with
the leading features of each.
There are only two amongst the leading houses which will not bring
forward the subject, viz. :-Her Majesty's Theatre and Covent Garden.
At the former, the approaching close of the season prevented a libretto
being sent to Donizetti, that he might compose an opera to it by that day
week; and at the latter, the previous uncertainty with respect to its ulti.
mate fate—whether it would become a concert-room, flower-market,
riding-school, tepid-bath, tea-garden, or eating-house for the million, pre-
vented any author from sending in his piece.
DRURY LANE THEATRE.—The grand opera of Rebecca and the Templar
will here be revived, with such alterations as may adapt it to existing cir-
cumstances, Front-de-Bæuf's castle being changed, for the attack, to the
Cardigan Tollbar; and the Lists at Ashby to the Swansea Copper Works.
The whole of the Jewess armour will be routed out and furbished up for
the Carmarthen Cavalry; an “extra pit door” will be opened to accom-
modate the rush ; and there will be, of course, an incidental ballet.
HAYMARKET. -A two-act drama, to be called the Maid of Brittany.
Rebecca is the daughter of an emigrant from St. Malo. She heaas the
revolution and releases her lover, who is in prison. There is a good part
of a countryman for Mr. Webster; and a nervous constable, to be sup-
ported by Mr. Buckstone.
ASTLEY's. —Probably this will be the grandest spectacle of all, embracing
as it does “the whole unequalled resources of the establishment.” We
have been favoured with a proof of the bill, by the politeness of Mr. Wid-
dicomb, under whose superintendence the piece is to be got up. This
gentleman well remembers the great Welsh riots of 1272, which ended in
the defeat of Llewellyn by Edward the First, and has arranged several
effective tableaux from his experience. The programme of the scenery,
incidents, &c. is exceedingly elaborate, and displayed in all sorts of type.
We quote a small portion :

From what I was of old.
Thus I would play a double part,

RISING WITH THE SON.
POETRY OF THE PENSIVE.
The following touching little ballad was written in a fit of despondency
by an individual in humble life. It is addressed to Jenkins, and is the
production of one to whom he owes-more alas ! than he will ever re-
pay. Need we say that it is written by his washerwoman :-
Air-Mary, I believed thee true,
JENKINS ! I believed thee true,
And I was done in so believing ;
But now I mourn, that e'er I knew,
A chap so given to deceiving...
Few have ever scrubb'd like me.
Oh ! I have washed to tatters nearly,
The few, few shirts possessed by thee;
Alas ! you wore them too severely.
I have read the news of shipping
In Lloyd's most lively list.
Fare thee well! Yet think, ah do !
I have seen the sunbeam darting
On one whose bosom bleeds to hurt thee;
On its wild uncertain way;
Who now would rather trust than sue,
I have watch'd the packet starting
And lose her cash than not clean-shirt thee.
For Margate and Herne Bay.
Fare thee well ! I'll think on thee,
But heifer, zephyr, pleasure,
Thou leav'st me many a bitter token :
Cash, lamblings, sunshine, ships,

THE WEATHER AND THE CROPS.
OUR own correspondent writes to tell us that he has been caught in a
shower, and his letters speak cheerfully of some French beans ; so that
our information is, on the whole, satisfactory as to the weather.
KENT.—The harvest has commenced at Gravesend amongst the lodging-
keepers. The late heavy rains have in some instances damaged the
crops, from the inefficiency of the gossamers which covered them and the
lack of umbrellas, but they are now ready for cutting.

DAMAGED CROPS.
In the neighbourhood of Fulham, a row of peas has been stuck, and the
growers are in the highest spirits. The market gardeners say that the
potatoes now in the ground may be dug up at the proper time, if nothing
happens to prevent it. The parsley crops are very abundant, and sweet
herbs are so plentiful that thyme is being thrown away in every direction.

The cry of “ Lambeth a port” is being now raised in imitation of the

is true that Lambeth has the advantage of an isthmus of coal-barges,
bringing it within a short distance of the Milbank continent; but the
cominunication with the peninsula of Vauxhall would perhaps render any
closer approximation almost superfluous. One of Lloyd's agents has

AN
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULES.
LABOUR THE TWELFTH.-HOW HERCULES TRIUMPHED OVER THE
ENGLISH PLUTO AND CERBERUS.--HIS LAST GREAT WORK.
BETWEEN the son of Jupiter and Alemena, and the hero who presides
over these pages, there is in certain particulars a very strong resemblance.
Punch, like Hercules, settles everything with his club; and if he does
not destroy reptiles and beasts of prey, he knocks bailiffs, constables,
churchwardens, and other monsters of that class, daily on the head.
Punch, moreover, triumphs over Jack Ketch, as also did Hercules ; and
his concluding achievement is a victory over the enemy of man. How
far in this respect he and Hercules are analogous, the reader will learn
ere he is ten minutes older.

You must know, sir, that I have taken a solemn pledge to abstain from

Alcohol is the product of vinous fermentation. It is generated when a

to ferment. Now, since my repudiation of spirituous liquors, I have

A pint-bottle of ginger-beer, submitted to the same process, yielded
three parts in a hundred of the same pernicious fluid ; and when I came
to discover the per centage of it combined with a mass of calves’-foot
jelly from the pastrycook's, I was thunderstruck. I must restrict myself
to ripe fruit, I suppose ; but even that, if over-ripe, may not be safe.
But this is not all. Í find that in the preparation of ordinary bread,
spirit is found to a considerable amount. This, it is consoling to reflect,
is mostly driven off in the baking ; but new bread, which is moist, may be
contaminated with a minute admixture of it ; I shall, therefore, be
obliged to eat mine stale—which I hate.
Moreover, potatoes and other farinaceous vegetables contain starch, and
are apt to ferment in the stomach ; and, knowing this, I fear, if I eat
them, I shall be answerable for their doing so in mine.
Alcohol is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, in certain propor-
tions, of which the axiom “Union is Strength " is physically true. It is
not, therefore, to carbon, to oxygen, or to hydrogen, individually, that the
teetotaller objects ; it is to the nefarious alliance of the three.
They exist, uncombined in such proportions, in all animal and vegetable
substances ; fearing, therefore, that they might, if I followed my accus-
tomed diet, enter, within my system, into that peculiar confederacy which
I have forsworn, I did think, at one time, of taking them separately for
food. But oxygen and hydrogen not being procurable in a solid form, and
carbon only in that of charcoal or of diamond, I was obliged to relinquish
this intention.
I will now conclude by giving you the opinion of a phrenological friend.

must be worth something; but 3001. is a joke of the most rampant order. Mackau at his side, it was not likely that the king of the French would be
taken advantage of.”
N.B.-In order to understand this joke, it may be necessary that the
reader should be aware that Admiral Mackau-a very long-headed states-
man—was one of the guests on the occasion alluded to.
It has been already stated that Louis Philippe made 'Her Majesty a
present of a handsome china vase. The Queen, on accepting it, observed
with much piquancy, that “she must be careful not to break it, for China
had been a good deal damaged already by English hands.” Louis Philippe
laughed, and Admiral Mackau gave a most parrot-like repetition of the
royal hilarity.
Her Majesty, it is stated in the papers, made herself a great favourite
with the little Count of Paris. She asked him if he would like to see the
Prince of Wales. “Oh no," said the little heir to the French throne,
“ I don't want to see Wales. J'ai peur des baleines."
When the royal visitors were taking leave of each other on the deck of
the Victoria and Albert, Her Majesty looked for the first time rather sad.
This being observed by the King of the French, Her Majesty, with true
affability, expressed å hope that she might not cast a gloom on others.
“Besides,” said she, turning to the Princess Clementine, “ Je vais
m'éclaircir-I'm going to Brighten.”.

good ; she had been two or three times indicted; would not swear
that he had not sent messages by her to the prisoner at the bar ;
they were not dishonourable messages—that is, they were only mes-
sages that gentlemen sometimes sent to young women.
Here Curlwell's examination terminated : that is, he was taken off
the rack. He had a quick-witted counsel and his own conscience
against him. Hence the valet turned pale and red, and shufiled and
stammered, and grinned vacantly, and whined, and so laid bare before
the court the miserable nature of Julius Curlwell. There never was
a more pitiable picture of a weak dissolute creature. When released
from the torture of self-delineation, the valet, with the sweat running
from his brow, ran from the court. His evidence had done much
for the cause of Patty. Lintley—I saw it—thought so ; for he smiled
and grasped Inglewood's hand, and Mrs. Lintley herself nodded
cheeringly to “the female prisoner at the bar.”
And now was Abram called upon for his defence. Leaning
forward, he made a sort of sweeping bow to the whole court; and
then, with a condescending air, began. « My lord and gentlemen
of the jury,” said the highwayman," whilst I regret that the incon-

to buy Cesar at our price, and to sell hinı at

“The pirates," says Plutarch, “considered
murder as a trifle." In this sentiment Cæsar,
no doubt, agreed with them. He used, in chatting
with them, to assure them that, when he got out
of their clutches, he would come back and crucify
their whole gang. They took this threat for a
joke ; but it proved to be no joke, at least to
them, for he was as good, or as bad, as his word.
The ancient Romans had not much notion of
joking.
Sylla, to cornpare a Roman candle with a
tallow dip, having at length, metaphorically speak-
ing, been snuffed out, Cæsar returned to Rome,
intending (by anticipation) to play Cromwell or
Richard the Third, if necessary; that is, to
make himself master of everybody, and not to
stick at trifles in so doing.
He commenced operations by a system of
wholesale bribery and corruption, which might
astonish even a Reformed Parliament. He gave
a series of magnificent dinners to the elite” of
the patrician circles, and treated the mob to all
sorts of plays, games, sights, and spectacles. On
one occasion he exhibited a “ Terrific Combat"
between three hundred and twenty pair of gla-
diators. This “ Unprecedented Attraction" in-
volved a copious effusion of “ Real Blood,” as,
perhaps, was announced in the bills.
No wonder, then, that “ Cæsar for Ever!"
was soon the popular cry ; no wonder, also, that
the said Cæsar, acting on the principle of “Ex-
pense no Object,” got head over ears into debt.

every night the whistling continued, increasing in volume. Then
Mr. Pearkes thought there might be thieves, pockets having sometimes
been picked very near the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. On the
morning of Tuesday week, about three o'clock, there was a pecu-
liar significance, a shrillness, in the whistling, and Mr. Pearkes, leaping
out of bed, and arming himself with a rushlight and pistol, descended
his bed-room stairs, determined to discover the mystery, or perish in
the attempt.
Arriving in the shop, Mr. Pearkes found all silent. He looked warily
around him-not a sound—not a soul. He retired into the sanctuary
of his back-parlour, when, after a few seconds, the whistling recom-
menced. He stepped into his shop, when, to the astonishment of
himself and his handmaid, Jane—for the poor little girl had come
down in her night-cap and papers—he saw and heard an oyster,
with open shells, whistling-"My native land!”
Mr. Pearkes and Jane were both so astounded that neither could

-dazzling as she was before-something almost too bright to contemplate.
We understand that the Queen has learnt, from the price of provisions
in France and Belgium, a few lessons that will have their effect upon the
mode in which the next speech from the Throne will deal with the question
of the Corn Laws. It is said, that, one day at dinner with her uncle, King
Leopold, Victoria, giving an arch look towards the children, and then at
their parents, remarked that Brussels sprouts were the only article the
people of Belgium were obliged to pay very dearly for.
We can fancy her Majesty marketing at home, with the recollection
fresh upon her of prices abroad-for economy is the order of the day in
the royal household. We should not wonder if an inspection of the
Windsor Castle butcher's bill may not induce her Majesty to put up with
tariff beef, of which she has had a taste during her recent trip to the
Continent.
Perhaps the homely habits of her fellow-sovereigns, who frequently go

This sentence of yours, sir, will work great good. For these last four

sugary hypocrisy. The consequence is, Mr. Clive, a woman cannot even
be knocked down, or have her face beaten black and blue, without thinking
herself grievously assaulted. Your judgment, sir, will disabuse foolish
females of this error. You have very properly shown them that any

matrimonial prospects of the young and interesting couple may be
yet realised.
The nuptials between a certain highly successful adapter of French
Vaudevilles and a popular Coryphée were celebrated last week at
St. Clements. The bell of the vestry rang a merry peal, and the
church clock was put right during the performance of the ceremony
at the expense of the bridegroom. The Coryphée was given away
by the amiable and athletic chief of the Caoutchouc Incredibles.
The wedding party left in one cab, and under five cotton umbrellas,
for the lodging of the bridegroom, where a cold collation had been
laid out under the superintendence of Mr. Cann, of the Bloomsbury
Soup Establishment. Covers were laid for one, and plates for seven.
In the evening, the happy pair repaired to Drury Lane Theatre ; the
bride to sustain her part in the Peri, and the bridegroom to applaud
her from the shilling gallery. The bride wore in the morning a four-
and-ninepenny print ; but, in the evening, appeared in a magnificent

Antiquarians tell us that Alfred the Great com-
piled all the laws into one volume, which he called
a dome or doom-book; and, considering what people
are doomed to by the law, Alfred could not have

In the beginning of the eleventh century, there
were three different sorts of laws, the Mercian, the
West Saxon, and the Danish ; out of which we are
told, by Ranulpolas Cestrensis, (who was, we sup-
pose, “a gentleman, one et cetera,'') that Edward
the Confessor formed a digest of laws, which shows
that the Confessor's digestion must have been first-
rate ; and, perhaps, living as he did near the sea
shore, he was enabled to profit by the anti-bilious
properties of cockles. Some say that Edward the
Confessor's book was a mere crib from Alfred's,
and Alfred has been called the conditor or builder
of our law, while Edward the Confessor has been
nick-named the restitulor or restorer. Being a
confessor, we wonder he did not confess this fraud,
if he had really been guilty of it; but perhaps, on
the lucus a non lucendo principle, Edward was
called a confessor from his never confessing any-
thing. Whoever may be entitled to the authorship,
these laws constitute the jus commune, or folk right,
as Edward the Elder rather facetiously phrases it.

because, albeit these things are the mission of
some women, they are not by any means that of Woman, considered as
that charming, smiling, bewitching, fascinating abstraction, which the
term will suggest to the reader.
The mission of Woman, as we understand Woman, though some people
may doubt whether anybody understands Woman, is two-fold. Some
great philosopher—we forget whom-observes that it resembles that of
a candlestick; Woman, like that piece of furniture, being destined for
utility and ornament. But perhaps Woman is rather like the candle than
the candlestick, she being universally admitted to be the light of life.
On which point the profoundest sages, inclusive, we believe, of “the
wisest man the world e'er saw," are agreed ; as likewise are all the
poets, with the exception of Euripedes and Juvenal.
The physical conformation of Woman is admirably adapted for certain
purposes of utility, for which the clumsier sex is disqualified. When we
consider the female hand, we observe that it is furnished with peculiarly
delicate and taper fingers ; thus exhibiting an admirable provision of
Nature for darning the stocking-pleasing task !—and for hemming the
pocket-handkerchief. The female middle finger will be seen, on exami-

PRINCE ALBERT'S STUDIO.
PITY the sorrows of a poor lessee,
Whose tragic stars have made him close his door ;
Who lately cleared his company of three,
And wants relief from half a dozen more.

With tempting aspect drew me from my road ;
For Harris there a splendid fortune found,
And Kemble a magnificent abode.

JQUITI
VER since the accession of Prince Albert to
the Royal Husbandship of these realms, he
has devoted the energies of his mind and
the ingenuity of his hands to the manufac-
ture of Infantry caps, Cavalry trousers, and
Regulation sabertashes. One of his first
measures was to transmogrify the pantaloons
of the Eleventh Hussars ; and as the regi-
ment alluded to is Prince Albert's own, His
Royal Highness may do as he likes with his
own, and no one could complain of his be-
dizening the legs of the unfortunate Eleventh
with scarlet cloth and gold door-leather.
When, however, the Prince, throwing the
whole of his energies into a hat, proposed to
encase the heads of the British Soldiery in a machine which seemed
a decided cross between a muff, a coal-scuttle, and a slop-pail, then
Punch was compelled to interfere, for the honour of the English army.
The result has been that the head-gear has been summarily with-
drawn by an order from the War Office, and the manufacture of
more of the Albert hat has been absolutely prohibited.
Greatness of mind is shown in various ways by different indivi-
duals. Hannibal was a great cutter-out, for he cut a passage through
the Alps ; but Prince Albert cuts out Hannibal, inasmuch as bis
Royal Highness devotes his talent to the cutting-out of coats, waist-
coats, and “things inexpressible.” The Prince's studio could not
fail to be an object of interest to the readers of Punch. We have,
therefore, at an enormous sacrifice of time and specie, obtained a
view of it.
Desirous that Prince Albert should not be outdone by the Doud-
neys, the Moseses, and others, who sing of Tweeds and Taglioni
wrappers, we have drawn up for his Royal Highness the following
poetical advertisement :
UCK I N G H AM Ρ Α Ι Α C Ε.
Come, away to the palace ! and look at the show
Of elegant garments by Albert and Co.
He's infantry jackets, emblazoned behind
With lacing, and everything else of the kind ;
That the soldiers who run from the enemy's whacks,
Will cut a good figure in turning their backs.
Aud look at the beautiful Infantry hat-
Did aught ever bear a resemblance to that?
With its side ventilation, intended, 't is said,
To keep all the soldiers quite cool in the head.
Exactly the thing 't will on trial be found, -
We offer the hat for a couple of pound.
If soldiers are meant for alarming a foe,
They 're soon rendered frightful by Albert and Co.
The Prince only asks, and he fears not denial,
For all his ingenious inventions a trial.
At his royal establishment there you may view
A waterproof cavalry Tweedish surtout;
With facings of Macintosh crossways extended,
For storming a garrison much recommended ;
And thus its pretensions to merit he clenches,-,
He warrants 'twill keep out the wet in the trenches.
A boot he's devising with moveable linings,
To give satisfaction in sappings and minings ;
'Tis greatly adapted the foot to adorn,
And warranted easy for bunion and corn.
His prices, he trusts, none will fancy are dear,
By contract he takes thirty thousand a-year !
Please to copy the address—ALBERT & Company, late of Gotha
House. Families punctually supplied.

And so I roll'd him into three instead.
I hop'd to make of this the actor's home ;
But if the fearful truth must needs be told
To my new plays the public would not come,
Nor cared to see the murder of the old.
My company—the best I could engage,
Lured by their vanity from duty's law,
Are now abandoned to a minor stage,
For on the patent boards they do not draw.
The public press, kind soother of my care,
Hail'd with applause my resolute decree.
Go-actors go—I will not yet despair,

SECTION THE FOURTH, OF THE COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS
OF ENGLAND.
EVERAL of our law writers, say, with their usual acute-
ness, “ England is not Wales, neither is it Scotland nor
Ireland ;"' and, in fact, Spelman adds that “ England
is nothing but itself :” though, in our own day, we have
seen that England has been anything but itself, so that
the old learning on this head is quite out of date at
present.
Wales continued a long time independent of Eng-
land ; and Cæsar, who seized on almost everything, did
not so soon seize upon that. The people lived, says
Tacitus, in a pastoral state ; having probably no other
food but Welch rabbits, until Edward the First intro-
duced his heir to them as their prince ; and the people having shown the
white feather, it is supposed that it was immediately taken from them and
placed in the prince's hat“ where,” says Fortescue, “it has continued

The finishing stroke to Welch independence was given by the statute 27th

with their liberties. But while it gave Wales a frightful blow with one
hand, it offered civil liberty with the other; and Mr. Selden is of opinion
that the expression a “topper for luck” originated with the circumstance
alluded to. The only remnant of independence left to Wales has been The Isle of Man is a distinct territory, not subject to our laws; and,

The royal dinner party was limited to the suite and four or five
others; but the gates of Trinity were besieged all night by people
trying to get a glance at the Quadrangle, the impression on the public
mind appearing to be, that the Queen and Prince Albert were sitting
in the open air, surrounded by the fellows and under-graduates—the
fact being, that the former were snugly shut in at the apartments of

to their rooms, and saw as little of the Queen as if, like the Mayor, they
had had the gate of Trinity slammed directly in their faces.

A CABMAN was yesterday summoned before the magistrate, at Bow-
street, for being found upon his box without his badge. The complainant
stated that, on being called off his stand, he appeared to be wearing his
badge under his coat. Complainant called upon him to produce it, when
it turned out to be a Temperance Medal.
The cabman alleged, in his defence, that he had left home that morn-
ing a little the worse for liquor, and in that state had put on the Temper-
ance Medal (which he had received the other day from Father Mathew)
by mistake.
The worthy magistrate said he would not, in this instance, inflict the
penalty for not wearing the badge ; but should fine the defendant five
shillings for being drunk, and would advise him to be more cautious
another time.

« Away, away to Paddington,
As fast as ye can drive ;
'Twixt eight and nine the Queen doth dine :

Duke Arthur takes his place ;
Behold him now, on way to Sloughi,
Borne at a whirlwind's pace.
"SA
“SAY, whose can yonder chariot be,
That thunders on so fast ?
And who was he that sat within ?
I marked him as he past."
“At Slough who stops ?" His Grace out pops,
His ticket is resign'd.
" To Windsor haste, like felon chased,
Or I shall be behind.”

“ 'Twas Arthur, Duke of Wellington,
Who in that chariot sat,
All in his martial cloak, and in
His proudly-plumed cocked hat."
Fast have they fled, right fleetly sped,
And Paddington is won.
“ How, office-swain, about the train ?"
66 'Tis just this instant gone."
“ Your Grace, we just have missed the train,
It grieveth me to say."
“ To Apsley House !" then cried the Duke,
“ As quickly as you may."
The loud halloo of “ Go it, you !"
Beneath the gas-light's glare,
O'er wood and stone they rattle on,
As fast as they can tear.
Off bounds the hack, while, far aback,
The night-hawk plies his wing ;
The race is run, the Castle 's won,
“ Come, this is just the thing."
“ Not Arthur, Duke of Wellington,
That poster fierce could be,
Nor yet a living nobleman;
Some Demon Duke is he."
At half past eight, for Queens don't wait,
The noble guests appear
In banquet-hall; and of them all
The Duke brings up the rear.
“ 'Twas he-to Folkestone he is bound,
To town by rail to wend;
Wherefrom to Windsor he must hie,
A Council to attend."
On, on they went, with hue and cry,
Until the Duke got home,
The axle-trees on Řre well nigh,
The horses in a foam.
MORAL.
“ 'Tis money,” as the proverb says,
" That makes the mare to go.'
The Duke has cash to cut a dash;
Would we could all do so !
With whizz and whistle, snort and puff,
The Duke is borne to town,
Nor stops until near London Bridge
The train hath set him down.
Out stepp'd the Duke, serene and cool,
And calmly went up stairs,
And donn’d the dress, the which, at Court
He generally wears.

To make my toilet there;

Thy tidings briefly tell.”

Attention will be next attracted to the cupola in the centre, which, it
will be seen, bears some resemblance to a nightcap. This feature of the
building relates to the Egyptian mummies which are sleeping within its
walls. It also warns the studious visitant that there are soporiferous ma-
terials in the library; but the clock beneath it reminds him that Time (of
which it is the emblem), is necessarily lost by slumber.
The body and wings of the erection are slightly suggestive of Newgate ;
to the exterior of which edifice their proportions and arrangements are
similar. It is to be considered that the British Museum, being a place
where admission is gratuitous, must necessarily be much frequented by the
lower classes ; at least, on high-days and holydays. Their first impression,

THE BANDIT'S FATE.
He wore a brace of pistols the night that first we met,
His deep-lined brow was frowning beneath his wig of jet ;
His footsteps had the moodiness, his voice the hollow tone,
Of a bandit-chief, who feels remorse, and tears his hair alone.
I saw him but at half-price, yet methinks I see him now,
In the tableau of the last act, with the blood upon his brow.
A private bandit's belt and boots, when next we met he wore,
His salary, he told me, was lower than before ;
And standing at the 0. P. wing he strove, and not in vain,
To borrow half a sovereign, which he never paid again.
I saw it but a moment-and I wish I saw it now-
As he buttoned up his pocket with a condescending bow.
And once again we met ; but no bandit chief was there ;
His rouge was off, and gone that head of once luxuriant hair :
He lodges in a two-pair back, and at the public near,
He cannot liquidate his “ chalk," or wipe away his beer.
I saw him sad and seedy, yet methinks I see him now,
In the tableau of the last act, with the blood upon his brow.

minster Hall. He was preceded by two bands—those
worn round his own neck,—and the clerk of the horse-
hair wig went forward carrying the robe of indolence,
and the white cravat of purity. On arriving at the
robing-room he was received by the row of hat pegs,
one of which he immediately invested with the order of
the gossamer. On entering the Court of Queen's Bench
he took his seat on the customary back bench, and on
being asked if he had anything to move in the usual
form, he went through the ceremony of the bow of
brieflessness. In the evening he meditated over a case
of cigars, and considered several points involving the
difficult question of the protection of purchasers.

LOVE.
ove is a state of being and not-being; for
somebody, though if he does not choose to love
at all, he need not love anybody, must, if he
loves, love somebody; and nobody necessarily
loves nobody
Since somebody loves somebody, and no-
body loves nobody, love is a relation between
somebody and somebody, and nobody and
nobody, respectively.
Now, the relation between nobody and nobody must be the same as the
relation between somebody and somebody. For a relation cannot be a
thing and not a thing ; and if the relation between somebody and some-
body be a thing, that between nobody and nobody must be a thing, too ;
which is absurd.
Therefore, since a relation which is nothing is beyond our ideas, love is
not, as has been alleged, the theme of the minstrel, but of the transcen-
dental idealist. So that a poet, to sing about love, must necessarily be a
madman ; his eye moving in a splendidly insane orbicularity, and his pen
bestowing a nomenclature and a residence upon gaseous non-entity, as
our friend Lord WILLIAM would say.

Thus we see that love is a non-entity,—which accounts for the vain
attempts of philosophers to define it.

We are compelled in self-defence, against the representations of all the
Newspapers, that theirs was the journal purchased, to assert that it was
two copies of PuncH her Majesty bought at the Railway Terminus. Our
readers may remember that our gracious Queen, with her accustomed
kind-heartedness, forwarded us a joke, the week before last, which we
inserted, although we expressed our opinion that her Majesty could do
better if she chose. We had no opportunity of forwarding a proof to
Windsor, and so her Majesty was anxious to see if it was inserted. The
« Visit to Cambridge" was productive of the highest merriment to her
Majesty and Prince Albert.
Our page, Dick, who disposed of the copies, has in consequence received
permission to add a crown to his hat, which it did not have before. He
has also received the appointment of Ranger of Hyde Park, whenever he
gets a holiday ; which is of rare occurrence : and Idler in Waiting upon
her Majesty on the occasion of any processions, when he will have to run
by the side of the carriage, as near as the guards will permit him.
Prince Albert has expressed his intention of visiting the Punch Office
at an early opportunity.
Of a certain nephew he utters a word,
And the nephew's name is no sooner heard,
Than, as on the stage is always the way,
The nephew happens in to stray.
'Tis Allen, of tenors one of the best-oh!
Who acts the character of Ernesto.
Like nephews in comedies, farces, burlettas,
In vaudevilles, melodrames, comediettas,
And every description of piece that's theatrical,
This nephew, on one point, is truly fanatical,
Refusing the hand of a beautiful creature
Of exquisite form, and angelic in feature,
And also possess'd of a fortune immense,
Which he spurns with the usual absence of sense
That always appears to distinguish the bevies
Of disinterested theatrical nevies.
He says he'll be true to a certain Norina-
His uncle, as usual, never has seen her,
And therefore objects to the match, by the rulo
That's followed in every theatrical school,
That guardians, fathers, and uncles, shalln't take
The trouble some simple inquiries to make,
But always are found to object out and out
To those whom they really know nothing about.
Pasquale declares, in the ev'ning of life,
He's serious projects of taking a wife.
The nephew, his great disappointment declares
In one of the softest of opera airs ;
Lamenting the plan that to poverty dooms him,
And hinting as well at the flame that consumes him :
Then Bedford and Allen their powers display,
By both coming forward and shouting away.
Though one is all grief, and the other all pleasure,
They both of them sing to the very same measure.
To one tune having utter'd quite different sentences,
From the stage they both hurry at opposite entrances.
lay
DON PASQUALE MADE EASY.
The curtain ascends—and the stage is meant
A room in the house to represent
Of Don Pasquale, with doors to enter
On the right, on the left, and in the centre.
On one of the tables, a clock very fine
Is marking the early hour of nine.
But like the clock of St. Clement's, Strand,
It never afterwards moves a hand.
A pleasing
melody greets our ears,
And Don Pasquale at once appears
In a robe-de-chambre, like those that are seen
Marked “ Newest Fashion, One Fifteen.”
The Don, who is both robust and tall,
The gallery welcomes with cries of “ Bravo, Paul."
The pit applauds, and the boxes tap
The velvet cushion with gentle rap.
And Bedford, placing his hand on his breast,
Seems to say, “ I intend to do my best."
The Don is expecting a promised visit,
And we've hardly time to ask who is it,
When Burdini, the baritone, quickly comes in,
Whose entrance applause is sure to win.
For a capital voice, with style to flavour it,
Has made him already a general favourite.
Of Malatesta, the part he plays,
A waggish doctor, who tries to raise
The hopes of Pasquale, the amorous Don,
That a charming widow may be won.
Pasquale asks a description—when, lo !
Immediately after a bar or so,
Malatesta sings a delicious air,
Commencing ** Lovely as angel fair."
Than the method of singing it nought could be properer,
Indeed it is one of the gems of the opera.
But Don Pasquale is not more wise
When told the colour of hair and eyes
Than he was before he knew them; and so,
The fair one's name he begs to know.
“ 'Tis my sister," the Doctor exclaims with a trill.
“ Introduce me," says Paul ; says Burdini, “I will.”
And thus from recitative they get
To a sort of dialogue duet ;
And the Doctor abruptly takes his leave,
But says he'll return with the lady at eve.
When a primo buffo is left alone,
He ne'er in an opera yet was known
To miss the occasion-fit and fair-
For singing a regular buffo air.
As Don Pasquale, Bedford sings it ;
He tries for applause, and down he brings it.
Scene Two is a room in the house of Norina,
When Garcia enters with graceful demeanour.
A letter is brought from Ernest, her lover,
To the Doctor, who enters, she passes it over.
He reads it aloud, as resigning the hand
Of Norina, but wherefore we can't understand.
For why hìs despair to such lengths need he carry ?
Because Don Pasquale determines to marry.
The doctor, who seems a most joke-loving man,
Proceeds to develop his whimsical plan :
"Tis to make Don Pasquale believe himself tied
To one, who, though gentle and meek as a bride,
As soon as he gives her the title of wife,
From that moment shall lead him a deuce of a life.
Scene Third is a room in the house of Pasquale,
When Bedford, with comedy worthy of Harley,
In a dress that is made in the height of the fashion,
Commends unto Cupid his amorous passion.
The Doctor then enters, conducting Norina :
Pasquale is struck, though he has not yet seen her.
Norina assuming the timidest mien,
Such as might in a bashful young school-girl be seen,
While Bedford is making most violent love,
In the style that stage precedents always approve,
For elderly gentlemen, paying their court,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
To the funniest kind of endearmentz resort:
As if they could win a retiring young bride
By giving her various pokes in the side,
And probing her waist with the fore-finger's knuckle,
They indulge in a sort of half guttural chuckle.
'Tis the way on the stage, if not so in life,
Of elderly gentlemen winning a wife.
Norina accepts him, with graceful dissembling,
Alternately curtseying, blushing, and trembling.
Ernesto comes in, and to see his adored
Thus coolly accepting a master and lord,
Completely upsets him : he's just going to chide
When Norina explains, in some speeches aside,
'Tis only a trick ; and perceiving its fitness,
He makes no objection the contract to witness.
No sooner the document's properly signed,
Than Norina commences by speaking her mind :
She orders new furniture, servants and carriages,
Determined to show of what consequence marriage is.
Her husband with termagant tongue she abuses,
To bend to his orders or prayers she refuses.
And every one laughing at poor Don Pasquale,
The First Act winds up with a brilliant finale.

What magnified Monsters circle therein !
Ragged, and stained with filth and mud,
Some plague-spotted, and some with blood !
Shapes of Misery, Shame, and Sin !
Figures that make us loathe and tremble,
Creatures scarce human, that more resemble
Broods of diabolical kin,
Ghoule and Vampyre, Demon and Jin !

The dram of Satan! the liquor of Sin !
Distill'd from the fell
Alembics of Hell,

The meanest creatures with scale and fin.
But hold-we are neither Barebones nor Prynno,
Who lash'd with such rage
The sins of the age ;

No gloves-no vest,

And what is worse than all the rest,
No light heart, tho' his breeches are thin,-
While Time elopes
With all golden hopes,
And even with those of pewter and tin,-
The brightest dreams,
And the best of schemes,
All knock'd down, like a wicket by Mynn.-
Each castle in air
Seized by Giant Despair,
No prospect in life worth a minikin pin,-
No credit-no cash,
No cold mutton to hash,
No bread—not even potatoes to mash;
No coal in the cellar, no wine in the binn,-
Smash'd, broken to bits,
With judgments and writs,
Bonds, bills, and cognovits, distracting the wits,
In the webs that the spiders of Chancery spin,-

Of poison-a rope," louping over a linn.”–

THE PUMP AT KENSINGTON.
ENSINGTON has been quite divided on the sub-
ject of the parish pump, which has for
some time absolutely resisted any attempts
to be used as a handle by the parishioners.
The spout is supposed also to have turned
rusty. As every criminal, even a pump,
is by the British Constitution entitled to
be tried by its equals, the parish pump
has been handed over to the parish vestry-
men. The Movement party are for taking
the pump away from its present position,
and setting it up in a more convenient
spot : the only objection to which would
be, that there is no water in the place
where it is proposed to take it to. Brunel's
opinion has been asked, but he has ob-
served his usual silence. The turncock has been consulted, and received
a shilling for an attempt to ease the piston, by which his finger was sadly
jammed ; and the authorities are not likely, after this sacrifice of blood
and treasure, to go to any furtlier outlay.

curious. We know the House of Hanover resided in England, but never
heard of a distillery paying a visit to France. Doubtless, Goding's Brewery
will next year take a trip to Germany; and Pickford's Warehouses start
off for an excursion to Switzerland, in company with Maltby's Shot Factory.

appear that Red Lion Square was built very soon after
the Invasion, alludes vaguely to a sort of meeting, which,
it is said, was very likely to have been the Parliament;
and as the body in question appears to have done no good,
but rendered something quite obscure, the suggestion that
it was the Parliament seems to be extremely feasible.
Antiquaries, who are “nothing if not at loggerheads”
with one another, have disputed-first, as to who summoned
the Parliaments—secondly, whether anybody summoned
them at all-thirdly, if summoned, whether they came-
fourthly, whether they came without summoning—fifthly,
whether they came exactly when they were summoned-
and, sixthly, if the same who were summoned, or sum-un
else, actually came-none of which controversies do we
think it expedient (just now) to go into. It is sufficient for
our present purpose, that John, in the celebrated “ bit of
stiff," known as Magna Charta— that glorious bill drawn
by the Barons, and accepted by himself — promised to
summon the nobles personally, and the Commons by the
sheriff and bailiffs; from which it would seem that the
Commons were hunted up by the ancestors of the Slowmans,
the Levys, the Thompsons, the Selbys, and the Davises.
Parliament can only be convened by the authority of the
Sovereign, except on the death of either a king or a queen ;
when if there be no Parliament in being, the last Parliament
revives—which has caused Fleta to make the very indifferent
joke, that “ Whereas ye cattes have pine lives, ye rattes-
meaninge ye Commones—have only two, and thatte sel-
dome." If kings won't summon Parliament for three years,
it seems that formerly peers might issue out writs, but if
king wouldn't summon ye, and peers wouldn't issue ye, the
only way for the country to get over the stile, was for con-
stituents to meet and elect members. A privilege that was
taken away by the 16th of Charles II. ; so that in these days
if sovereigns won't summon Parliament, there is really no
help for it.
Wherever it is laid down in the law books that a thing
can't be done, it may be assumed with tolerable certainty
that the thing has been done ; and hence we find that though
Parliament may not summon itself, it has summoned itself

A Night with Father Mathew.
On the 6th of November, Father Mathew gave a sumptuous entertain-
ment to a select party of friends. The waters were of the most
récherche description—the old bottled Niagara was in fine condition, as
were also the Danube and Volga ; but in respect to aroma and flavour,
the eau de Tamise was pronounced incomparable, although a bottle of
Seine was on the table. The merry party kept it up until a late hour.
Some with its symmetry were fired,
Some praised its growth till they were tired,
And much the Queen the beast admired-
Said she, “ 'Tis very fat ;'
The Prince into its breed inquired,
And fodder, and all that.
At last, one gave the sage advice,
That Brahmin bulls were prone to vice, -
But that ox-beef was very nice,
To which the Queen assented.
He's voted dangerous in a trice,
And-harm must be prevented.
The cue was plain; they could not err;
Wemyss and Murray straight confer,
And with them Alderman Banister,
Purveyor to the table ;
And for the slaughter they concur
With zeal most commendable.
One thing, however, yet remain'd ;
The Queen's consent must first be gain'd,
And the Sign Manual obtain'd,
The deed of death to dash on :
So writs were made, and ail ordain'd
In most approved fashion.
What desperate strength, what deadly ire,
What foam, and blood, and breathèd fire,
What bellowings in that conflict dire
Bechanced, the Muse hath hidden :
To watch so brave a brute expire
Were sight to Muse forbidden.
The Labours of 1843.
The year 1843 has been most prolific in wonderful events, as the
following sample will testify :-
The completion of the Maps of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge.
The fourth year of the French Ministry.
The three seasons of Covent Garden Theatre.
We have been favoured, at an enormous expense, with the following
Labours of 1856.
(BY OUR OWN PROPHET).
The closing of Alderman Gibbs' accounts.
A Dividend on the Waterloo Bridge Shares.
The riveting of the first chain of the Hungerford Suspension Bridge.
Literary Intelligence.
The new novel of the “ Perils of Beauty," has suggested to Lord W.
Lennox a tale in three volumes, to be called the “ Security of Ugliness.”
* Our authority simply calls it " a peculiar description of hair of a black and white
colour," adding parenthetically," piebald,” which latter epithet, it is submitted with great
deference, is inapplicable to the species. Perhaps it were difficult to assign a precisely
adequate epithet to this peculiar mixture of black and white. The Honourable Member
for Drontrose will, we are sure, acknowledge the high compliment of comparing him
with so noble au animal, even should he fail of being convinced that the mixture in ques-
tion is the true Joe-Hume black and white.

THAM
T".
THE Premier's promised Bull has not yet made its appearance ;
but the landowners, caring more for the Golden Calf, are not
particularly anxious about the animal alluded to. Some are of
opinion that the offer made by Sir Robert Peel was allegorical, and
that he intends taking the Bull by the horns in the next session,
while others maintain that the tale about the Bull is indicative of
its being a perfect toss-up how the prime minister will act for the
future. To us, it appears like the schoolboy trick of making rabbits
on the wall; and those who are weak enough to expect the Bull,
had better go and look for it on the wall-to which the weak are
proverbial for going.
When Peel, to his tenants, declared his intent

And avowed for that purpose he'd spare no expense,
He spoke, to be sure, like a man of good sense.

But they 're not of the sort that bring grist to the mill.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NOMINATION OF SHERIFFS.
It seems that her Majesty has been lately performing the annual cere.
mony of pricking for the sheriffs. This is a very ancient custom, and
originated thus :-The office of sheriff being one requiring considerable
courage, Queen Elizabeth sportively asked Essex, then the favourite,
which was the best test of personal valour. Essex being in a sportive
mood, playfully took the Queen's hand, and happened to receive a punc-
ture in the finger from her Majesty's ruffle. Essex exclaimed “Oh!”
when the Queen said, " Ah, that shall be the test of a sheriff's courage.”
And the sheriffs were pricked for ever afterwards.
Up in the morning, ere the calls
Of duns begin to bore him,
The huntsman hies to “The Three Magpies," *
But the Gent is there before him.
He sings as he thinks he cuts a dash,
In a three pound coat attired ;
But the scarlet is free from stain or splash,
And the horse for the day is hired.
He rides o'er the dogs, and he tries a leap,
And drops in the ditch behind him;
Oh, the Gent's lament is loud and deep,
But the sportsmen never mind him.
GENTS.
(Suggested by the Frontispiece of Punch's Pocket Book; and the Poem of “Birds,”
in the New Monthly Magazine.)

ENTS ! Gents ! ye are horrible things
With your slang-looking coats, and gaudy
rings :
Where shall a gentleman wander or dwell,
Horrible Gents, but ye come there as well?
Ye swarm at the theatres' half-price to the
slips,
And think that your style doth all others
eclipse;
With glaring handkerchiefs tied round your
neck,
And coarse common trowsers of violent
check ;
Ye fall the best prey to the cheap tailor's
lures,
Whose pitiful doggrel your custom procures.
Horrible Gents, ye come thickly around
Wherever flash manners and habits are found ;
Ye flourish in force when the shutters are up,
And think singing taverns good places to sup.
Horrible Gents ! they have coupled thy names
With cheap gaudy things in the bright window frames.
We have a Gent's newest Berlin,” and “Gent's Opera Ties,"
With “Gent's Patent Alberts”–unnumber'd supplies.
The slop-selling clothesman has blouses quite rife,
For “ Gents” who are leading “ a business life;"
And similar objects are everywhere vended,
For Gents—not for Gentlemen-always intended.
Dismal attempters ! upbraid ye I must,
Oh! where is the eye but is dulled with disgust
As it watches your trimmings-your cut-away coats,
The pins in your bosoms, and stocks at your throats.
Oh! I would not wish, as the old ballads sing,
To be fairy or butterfly-rich man, or king :
I only would pray that the Fates might consent
To save me from ever becoming A GENT !

Punch begs to submit the annexed form of Petition to the serious
consideration of all Members of Parliament.
To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom, in
Parliament assembled.
THE HUMBLE PETITION OF
M.P.
SHEWETH,
That your Petitioner has frequently, to his great personal incon-
venience, slept many successive nights on the benches of your Honourable
House, lulled by debates, and waiting a division.
That your Petitioner has ever observed, that the moment any question
is proposed to the House, every honourable member has already made up
his mind which way he will vote, and every other member knows which
way that will be.
That there never has been known an instance of any honourable mem.
ber, after hearing or sleeping through a debate, or waiting the end without
doing either, voting otherwise than as he had determined to vote before
the debate began.
That your Petitioner has, therefore, often thought that it would be a
great relief to honourable members if they were allowed to give their
vote on every question before the debate upon it began, and that such as
pleased be then allowed to go quietly home.
That your Petitioner purposed to have proposed this as a standing
order, but that the erection of new Houses of Parliament gives opportu.
nity for a still better arrangement.
YOUR PETITIONER THEREFORE HUMBLY PRAYS,
That instead of one house only, in which to assemble the Commons,
there be, in the new building, two houses,
That of these houses, one be appropriated to speaking and the other
to voting,
That the business in both houses proceed simultaneously,
That whenever the house of voting shall have got through the busi-
ness of the session, it shall be competent to her Majesty to pro-
rogue them without necessarily proroguing the house of speaking,
who shall be at liberty to sit as long as they please,
That any member wishing to make a speech, and not finding op-
portunity, may, after ten days' vain endeavour to be heard, de-
posit his intended speech, in writing, with the door-keeper, and
the same shall thereupon be deemed to have been spoken, and
shall be printed, at the member's expense, and a copy sent to
every newspaper in the United Kingdom, to be by them inserted,
as soon as may be, either in the report of the debate to which
it belongs, or of some other.—And your Petitioner, &c.
* The Three Magpies, an inn on the western road, of hunting celebrity.

The passengers cough—but what care they ?-
They are free as the cloud, and out for the day,
They have money enough for a dozen to pay,
And leaves of the cabbage they can consume.

When a professional toast is given, it will be advisable to hang on some
individual present as a sort of pretext for proposing it. Thus, if a young
barrister may happen to form one of the guests, " the bar" should not
be given without his name being mentioned in conjunction with it. The

“ Gentlemen, I believe we have amongst us to-night an individual

am sure you will concur with me in the eulogy I have just passed upon

BALLET OF LADY MACBETH.”
Tuesday, Nov. 21.
Y VERY DEAR PUNCH,—I was much struck to-day
by a suggestion put forth by The Times in its
notice of Le Diable Amoureux. That journal
states, that the only chance of getting a five-act
tragedy performed, is to omit the whole of the
dialogue, and give the heroine to a première
danseuse. From the general tenor of the para-
graph, I do not suppose that such a course is
really recommended; but that the intention is
merely to convey a notion of the fallen state
of the literary drama. Nevertheless I have
chosen, of my own free will, to interpret the suggestion sincerely; and,
acting upon it, have, in a very few hours, constructed a ballet on the
tragedy of Macbeth, the plan of which I inclose you ; though I warn all
managers, from Mr. Lumley to the proprietor of the “ Royal Albert,"
that the acting copyright is still my own, and that if they wish to play
my ballet, as doubtless they will, they must come down ” handsomely.
I have conceived the ballet to be sustained by the artists of her Majesty's
Theatre ; but the manager who brings it out will, of course, adapt it to his
own company. Macbeth I originally intended to make a mere pantomime
so
part, and to have given him to Coulon. However, I afterwards thought
better of it,-considering pantomime business but “slow” work--and have
given him to the first male dancer, St. Leon. Cerito is Lady Macbeth ;
and, as the lady is the important personage in a ballet, she, and not her
husband, gives the name to the piece. In the same spirit, I have given dagger, and the “quiet movement” is to be of the most brilliant and

President.-Sir GUY RAFFE.
Vice-Presidents.-MR. CROKER DILLIE and PROFESSOR STAMEN.
RESIDENT Sir Guy Raffe read some extracts from a letter
from Professor De Lenz, a communication from whom
was read at the last meeting, stating that he had dis-
covered the skeleton of a male flea in the folds of a
mummy-cloth. The present communication was of higher
interest. He had, while examining mummies, in con-
junction with his friend the Shah Pyez (Professor of
Twigology to the University of Cairo), been so fortunate
as to discover what he at first considered to be the body
of an embalmed flea ; but, to his great astonishment, he
perceived that, after a few minutes' exposure to the air,
it exhibited signs of vitality, and by a judicious applica-
tion of animal heat, soon became able to crawl. The
Professor, enlarging on the extreme delight he expe-
rienced in feeling the first feeble bite of this animal,
perhaps three thousand years old, exclaims that none
but those who, after having laboured long and arduously
in the cause of scientific and antiquarian research, have at length prose-
cuted a discovery exceeding even their most sanguine expectations-
“ None but such,” he exclaims, “ can form the faintest conception of my
feelings at the moment when my blood first mingled with (possibly) the
blood of one of the Ptolemies.” Subsiding into more platosophic calmness,
he states that the flea has so far recovered as to be able to leap full six
inches. The Professor feeds it from his own hand, and reports it to be in
a very thriving condition.
The President remarked, that this threw the mummy wheat completely
into the shade.
Mr. Slick, of Slickville, communicated to the section some curious facts
with regard to the extreme vitality of the American oak (quercus vivens),
commonly known by the name of the " live oak.” He stated that his
friend Captain Enoch Brown, of New York, having had his bulwarks
carried away, got new ones fixed of this oak, and was astonished, about
a week after he sailed, to discover young shoots sprouting all round the
decks. He took great care of them, and such was the rapidity of their

We beg leave to wind up our review with a little poem of our own, in
humble imitation of a song of Moore :-

“I'll build up in London-the thought is divine."
The temple was built, and he now only wanted
Some victims to place on cupidity's shrine.
He flew to a “sweater," who set down before him
Some prices—the lowest his art could invent;
But mean as they were, Schneider tried to come o'er him,
By saying they were not the prices he meant.
“Oh never," he cried, “ could I think of engaging
A workman whose services some would prefer ;
But yon wretched woman, whose hunger is raging,
We'll make, if you please, sir, a sempstress of her.”
So the bargain was struck, and they hastened to get her;
She joyfully flew to her needle and tlıread.

CHAPTER V.
OF THE MANNER IN WHICH WALTER ARRIVED AT CAMBERWELL.
It was a gay and bustling scene at the Elephant and Castle, when the
coach, which was conveying our hero to his destination, stopped there.
Retailers of goods were plying their various trades, offering knives and
annuals to the passengers ; industrious artisans were forming clean tho-
roughfares from one side to the other of the muddy roads ; whilst on the
.stalls at the edge of the pavement, fruit was disposed in small pyramids,
the base being composed of four apples with one at the top, making in all
five, to tempt the passers-by into purchasing them. The coach stopped for
ten minutes, and then went on.
The roads now became less thronged with passengers. Then gardens
appeared before some of the houses, as if in mockery of the broken hearts
that inhabited them : gardens, in which the spring's young buds broke,
from their winter cerecloth, to struggle amidst the poisonous exhalations
of the teeming air. At length the coach stopped. As Walter got down
from the roof, he felt that the last tie which bound him to Gracechurch-
street was broken. But this was nothing to his bitter anguish when, as

DON PASQUALE MADE EASY.
A ROOM at Pasquale's begins Act Two.
The Don is inspecting the bills that are due,
For dresses and jewels, and furs and lace,
Which are lying about in every place,
Supposed to be bought by Norina; although
The Don (that's Bedford,) must very well know
They ’re dresses and properties, tastefully set,
For which he's incurr'd not a halfpenny debt.
The stage is with servants in livery fill’d,
Whom Phillips—the master of chorus—has drillid
To neatly come in, at appropriate places,
Sopranos, and altos, and tenors and basses.
To one, who has something of musical skill in her,
Is apportioned a solo announcing the milliner ;
To another, whose singing in tune is assured,
Is intrusted the separate part of the steward :
While the rest, who are apt to be now and then out,
Are only permitted together to shout ;
And thus, if a note may by one be neglected,
It can't, when they sing all at once, be detected
The servants go out; and Pasquale, alone,
Begins in a very lugubrious tone
The property pieces of paper to con,
Which he saw,
'twixt the acts, by the call-boy brought on;
But, calling them bills—he their total peruses,
And how he shall pay them-most dolefully muses.
But his wife, he declares, in the first place he'll settle-
Though that— like the bills of the tradesmen, wants metal.
Whilst up he is trying his courage to call,
Norina comes in-ready dress’d for a ball.
He asks where she's going : says she “ To the Opera ;"
Than her conduct he thinks nothing could be improperer.
But vain his remonstrance-she will not be led,
And her only reply is—“ To bed, sir, to bed !”
The gentleman's threats and the ladies' coquetting,
Give scope to three minutes' or so of duetting ;
Concluding with Bedford's becoming quite hoarse
By shouting—with rage, “ A Divorce-a Divorce !"
Then exit Norina—who drops as she goes
A letter, right under the Don's very nose.
He reads it, and finds an appointment is made
With his wife—in the garden, that some serenade
Is the signal that will by the lover be given,
And Pasquale, of course, to distraction is driven.
But rather than let in his own bosom fester
His wrongs, he determines to call Malatesta."
On madness Pasquale apparently borders,
And hurries away—to be giving his orders.
The servants then enter, and standing before us,
Sing a pretty, but most inappropriate chorus.
In which we are told they've contrived to discover
Their mistress has got a young man for a lover.
(We know that our servants will speak of our faults,
But not to the air of a regular waltz.
However, the motive is taking and pretty,
For anything further what care3 Donizetti ?)
To resume now. Immediately following that,
Ernesto walks in through a door in the flat,
And with him the doctor ; they both of them say,
They've parts of some little importance to play.
Says Ernesto, I'm off for concealment ; and straight
He hurries away in the green-room to wait.
Where 'tis n't unlikely he says to the Don,
(Come Bedford, make haste, for Burdini is on).
Pasquale complains to his medical friend,
And wishes the marriage was brought to an end :
He tells of the letter he lately has picked up,
Of the horrible row that Norina has kick'd up.
And together they talk of an excellent plan,
To get a divorce if they possibly can.
It is to go forth, and at once to discover
The termagant wife tête-a-tête with her lover.
A plan which at once to mature they proceed,
In the course of some very good singing indeed.
A serenade is heard without,
'Tis sung by Allen, who gives it out
With the taste, expression, and judgment too,
Which are to this gem of the Opera due.
Marina enters, and hurries straight
To ope for Ernesto the garden gate ;
And both, in spite of the chilly weather,
Begin-out-of-doors-a duet together.
In a minute more the Doctor and Don,
From the grove with lanterns, walk softly on.
Norina, when she sees them, believes.
Or else pretends to imagine, they're thieves :
A little parley then ensues,
Malatesta explains Ernesto's views.
And though his wife, Pasquale, thought her,
The Don takes Norina as his daughter.
Letting his nephew quietly take her,
In the hope that obedient he'll make her.
So the trick that has been play'd confessing;
The young folks get the old one's blessing

THE CHRISTMAS SONG
OF
THE DISHONEST TENANT.
Now, let us heap the fire up,
And ring a joyous tune ;
Pass round the brimming Wassail Cup
Before we shoot the moon.
Bring from the wood-yard log and spray,
And let the Wallsend blaze away-
For which we never mean to pay:
And let us all be merry.
II.
Now run the spit the sirloin through,
And put it down to roast ;
For Butcher, Baker, we will do,
But Brandy-merchant most.
The fattened turkey let us kill,
We shall not stop to pay the bill ;
But lightly hop the twig we will,
Like winter robins—very.
PENCILLINGS OF PUBLIC PEOPLE.
THE WATERLOO BRIDGE TOLL-TAKER.
The shareholders of Waterloo Bridge intend, we under-
stand, to give a dinner to the toll-keeper on the Surrey side
in celebration of the successful blockade of Westminster, and
the increased traffic over their own edifice; which has proved
the only instance in which continued run upon their pro-
perty has been of benefit to them. A year's dividend has been
given up for this purpose, amounting in the aggregate to some-
thing under half-a-crown; and the collecting clerk, after much
repose, has intentions of making another call upon the share-
holders at their own residences.
As such a short notice of this well-known individual may
not be out of place. The toll-keeper is a very remarkable
personage—a great deal more so than people would believe by
looking at him. It is generally understood that he has never
been to bed since he was a boy; and that in 1840, previous to
the reduction of tolls, accomplished his great undertaking of
picking up one thousand pence in one thousand hours on the
toll-table. The writer of this notice had an opportunity of con-
versing with him in the course of last winter, although he is
usually taciturn and reserved; seldom speaking unless when a
passenger runs against the wrong turnstile.
Previously to the reduction of the tolls, the subject of the
present sketch complained bitterly of his solitary and isolated
condition, seldom communing with his fellow-men except per-
formers, who at that period colonized the Transpontine Marshes
in great numbers. His duties ceased at that time about six
o'clock, P.M.; because on returning, they usually paid on the
other side. He perfectly remembers the time when the English
Opera House had a company, and he laid in half-pence to give
change to them on the days they received their salaries. His
present habitation is a neat, compact, one-roomed residence,
which does not appear to possess a bed; but, as he never wants
one, this is of no consequence. Indeed, we never saw him inside
his house at all, his usual position being outside the door,
behind a gas-lantern, and within reach of the half-pence, which
he gravely and silently removes to some unknown depository
as they are laid down.
We have not been favoured with a view of the plate to be
presented to him when the dinner is given, but hear that it is
of the willow-pattern, and will be in all probability accom-
panied by a knife and fork.
III.
And when the jovial feast is o’er,
Cut up and swallowed all ;
We'll cut ourselves, and lock the door,
Before the tradesmen call.
And carol blithely as we run,
To think the shopkeepers are done :
How frugal is our Christmas fun!
Sing Mistletoe and Derry.

THE SONG OF THE SHIRT.
WW
CITH fingers weary and worn,
With eyelids heavy and red,
A Woman sat, in unwomanly rags,
Plying her needle and thread-
Stitch ! stitch ! stitch !
In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
And still with a voice of dolorous pitch
She sang the “ Song of the Shirt ! ”
6 Work! work! work !
While the cock is crowing aloof!
And work-work-work,
Till the stars shine through the roof!
It's O! to be a slave
Along with the barbarous Turk,
Where woman has never a soul to save,
If this is Christian work !
That shatter'd roof-and this naked floor-
A table—a broken chair-
And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank
For sometimes falling there !
Work-work-work !
From weary chime to chime, :
Work-work-work-
As prisoners work for crime !
Band, and gusset, and seam,
Seam, and gusset, and band,
Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumb'd,
As well as the weary hand.
“ Work-work-work,
In the dull December light,
And work-work-work,
When the weather is warm and bright-
While underneath the eaves
The brooding swallows cling
As if to show me their sunny backs
And twit me with the spring.
6 Work-work-work
Till the brain begins to swim ;
Work-work-work
Till the eyes are heavy and dim !
Seam, and gusset, and band,
Band, and gusset, and seam,
Till over the buttons I fall asleep,
And sew them on in a dream !
“O! Men, with Sisters dear!
O! Men ! with Mothers and Wives !
It is not linen you're wearing out,
But human creatures' lives!
Stitch-stitch-stitch,
In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
Sewing at once, with a double thread,
A Shroud as well as a Shirt.
“ Oh! but to breathe the breath
Of the cowslip and primrose sweet-
With the sky above my head,
And the grass beneath my feet,
For only one short hour
To feel as I used to feel,
Before I knew the woes of want
And the walk that costs a meal !
« Oh but for one short hour !
A respite however brief !
No blessed leisure for Love or Hope,
But only time for Grief !
A little weeping would ease my heart,
But in their briny bed
My tears must stop, for every drop
Hinders needle and thread !
“ But why do I talk of Death !
That Phantom of grisly bone,
I hardly fear his terrible shape,
It seems so like my own-
It seems so like my own,
Because of the fasts I keep,
Oh ! God ! that bread should be so dear,
And flesh and blood so cheap !
With fingers weary and worn,
With eyelids heavy and red,
A Woman sate in unwomanly rags,
Plying her needle and thread-
Stitch ! stitch ! stitch !
In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
And still with a voice of dolorous pitch,
Would that its tone could reach the Rich !
She sang this “Song of the Shirt !""
“ Work-work-work !
My labour never flags;
And what are its wages ? A bed of straw,
A crust of bread-and rags.

severity. Paupers have been imprisoned ; and no pains have been
spared to render them wretched and ridiculous, for their own reform-
ation, and by way of example to others. The success, however, with
which this truly Christian practice has been pursued, has hitherto
been but partial. The sufferings of the culprit, indeed, have effected
little more good than the gratification of the well-constituted mind,
which rejoices at the punishment of guilt.
Now, the reason of this comparative failure of the Poor Law is
obvious. The horrors of the workhouse are invisible. The tears,
and sighs, and groans of the prisoner, are thrown away. Their
bitterness is wasted on the dungeon air. The pauper-vicious
wretch !is a scarecrow in a sack. His fate is unknown to those
who might profit by its spectacle. To remedy this defect, it has been
proposed, so Punch is informned, to build workhouses of glass. This
device is ingenious; but glass is expensive. The Poor's Rates would
be awfully augmented : and besides, there are things done in work-
houses which would hardly bear the light.

OUR readers will have read with due horror and appropriate alarm a
paragraph in the papers giving an account of an awful explosion in
Golden Square. The facts not having been all given in the papers, we
add from our own reporter a few further particulars.
Directly the explosion was heard, the whole of the inhabitants, consist-
ing of twenty-three lawyers and sixteen doctors, rushed to the spot-the
lawyers with a view to an indictment, and the doctors with an eye to an
accident, followed haply—or happily-by an inquest. The man with the
fire-escape instantly got out all his ladders, and raised them to their
utmost height, with the view of saving something; while the square-
keeper, hearing that a luminous body had fallen on the earth, looked up
instinctively to see that the Moon was in its proper position. Having
ascertained that no lives had been lost, fears began to be entertained for
the safety of the statue, supposed to be that of George the First, but
really being that of King John, holding in his hand a copy of Magna

THE PAUPER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL.

66
FULL of drink and full of meat,
On our Saviour's natal day,
CHARITY's perennial treat ;
Thus I heard a Pauper say :
Ought not I to dance and sing
Thus supplied with famous cheer?
Heigho!
I hardly know-
Christmas comes but once a year !
“ After labour's long turmoil,
Sorry fare and frequent fast,
Two-and-fifty weeks of toil,
Pudding-time is come at last !
But are raisins high or low,
Flour and suet cheap or dear ?
Heigho !
I hardly know-
Christmas comes but once a year.
“Fed upon the coarsest fare
Three hundred days and sixty-four
But for one on viands rare,
Just as if I wasn't poor !
Ought not I to bless my stars,
Warden, clerk, and overseer?
Heigho!
I hardly know-
Christmas comes but once a year.
“ Treated like a welcome guest,
One of Nature's social chain,
Seated, tended on, and press'd-
But when shall I be press'd again,
Twice to pudding, thrice to beef,
A dozen times to ale and beer?
Heigho!
I hardly know,
Christmas comes but once a year!
“ Come to-morrow how it will ;
Diet scant and usage rough,
Hunger once has had its fill,
Thirst for once has had enough,
But shall I ever dine again?
Or see another feast appear ?
Heigho!
I only know
Christmas comes but once a year.
“ Frozen cares begin to melt,
Hopes revive and spirits flow-
Feeling as I have not felt
Since a dozen months ago-
Glad enough to sing a song-
To-morrow shall I volunteer ?
Heigho!
I hardly know-
Christmas comes but once a year.
“ Bright and blessed is the time,
Sorrows end and joys begin,
While the bells with merry chime
Ring the Day of Plenty in!
But the happy tide to hai!
With a sigh or with a tear,
Heigho!
I hardly know-
Christmas comes but once a year !”

nets (if I may so express myself) all the others. Being by nature a great
walker, I had one winter's day strolled eighty or ninety miles away from
the camp of my amiable friends the “ Jolliscalpaway” tribe of Indians,
on the “ Yell-o-war-cri-end-o-mee” prairie ; and, on approaching a
beaver-dam (I do not mean a maternal female of this race), my interest
was aroused by the spectacle of a furious combat between two fine male
beavers, who both fought with the greatest fury and valour ; and after a
very prolonged contest, I was rejoiced (for the cold was so intense that.
on touching the hair of my head or beard, it would break off short, it
was so thoroughly frozen !) to see the larger of the two succeed in master-
ing and killing his antagonist. But ere I could move forwards to claim
the booty, in right of being the stronger party, I was thunderstruck by
observing the conqueror deliberately commence flaying his prize in the
most scientific and professional way possible, which he executed in a
wonderfully short time ! I, of course, waited breathlessly for his fur-
ther proceedings; and after he had beautifully disengaged the skin, I
was petrified at beholding him bite, with his front teeth, four orifices of
equal size at the shoulders and thighs, just large enough to admit the in-
sertion of his own, and coolly put it on, as I would a great coat-in fact,
it looked very much like a sort of fur Chesterfield wrapper, and fitted him
admirably! After this he began to shake himself into it in a most Chris-
tian-like manner, stretching out his legs one after the other, so as to draw
it thoroughly on; and he then trotted off in evident glee and comfort,
conscious of his good fortune in being thus provided with a warm pelisse
to protect him from the extreme cold, and leaving me in a state allied to
paralysis from wonder !
When, on my return, I related to my kind-hearted hosts, the “Jolli-
scalpaways,” what I had witnessed, they informed me that nothing was
more common than such an occurrence during very severe winters like
the present one ; and it seems that the beavers perpetually carry on this
sort of chivalric encounter, in which (as with the knights of old) it is
well understood that the object and reward of the victor is the armour of
the vanquished. It is nevertheless a very curious and human trait in the
character of these provident little creatures, and, though it may seem to
warrant unbelief to the sceptical mind, is as true as any other part of
my adventures !
