PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PRE FACE
“ ' TWENTY-FIVE YEARS,” said the faithful Puncu to his loving BRITANNIA.
“ Is it so long ?” replied the blue-eyed BRITANNIA, smiling. “ You have made me so happy that I have
scarcely felt the flight of time. But it is twenty-five years since you became my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend.”
High banquet was held, and the Representative Men and Women of the nation came to honour the Festival
of the Fifty Volumes.
“When I think,” said the Here APPARENT,“ how nobly you have supported the Throne.”
“How," said the Primate, “ you have helped Religion by correcting the follies of Priests."
“ How," said the CHANCELLOR, “you have demolished Legal abuses until our system of Law is not now
so very far from rationality."
“ How,” said LORD DERBY, “ you have taught an aristocracy that its truest strength is in cohesion with
the people."
" How," said LORD RUSSELL, "you have thawed Whiggery until it has condescended to flow with the
stream of time."
And how,” said Mr. BBIGHT, "you have instructed Reformers that victory is theirs if they will argue,
not bellow."
“How," said the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE," while denouncing the wickedness of offensive war, you have done
all honour to the champions of right.”
“How,” said the DUKE OF SOMERSET, “ you have shown a true Briton's love for our gallant Navy.'
“ And," added CAPTAIN COLES, “ bave enabled me to carry my Turrets against officialism.”
“How you made the Volunteer Force," said LORD RANELAGI.
“How genially, and as it were in a Loving Cup, you have pledged us citizens to Corporation Reform,”
said the LORD MAYOR.
“How you emancipated the Hebrews," said BARON ROTHSCHILD.
“And completed Catholic Emancipation," said MR. JUSTICE SHEE.
“How your Highness hath split the Wind-bags but guarded the Wine-skins," said Mr. Thomas CARLYLE.

“ How you have honoured Art, while yourself exhibiting her in her sternest and her most graceful forms,”!
said SIR FRANCIS GRANT, P.R.A.
“ How you have upheld the glorious Art of the Healer, and crushed and trampled on Quackeries,” said SIR
THOMAS WATSON, President of the College of Physicians.
“How you have helped the Poor, preaching that poverty is neither a crime nor a merit, but a misfortune,"
said MR. VILLIERS.
“How you have upheld rational Education, against the fanatics," said Mr. LOWE.
How awfully kind you have been to us Boys," said the CAPTAIN OF Eron.
“How you have been the chivalrous Champion of Woman,” said Miss MARTINEAU.
Especially Pretty Woman," said a chorus of soft and saucy voices.
" Upheld the intellectual Drama," said Mrs. THEODORE MARTIN.
“And the romantic and picturesque," said Mr. BENJAMIN WEBSTER.
" And the refined and graceful,” said Miss KATE TERRY.
* And jolly good fun wherever it was to be found,” said MR. JOHN BALDWIN BUCKSTONE.
Here the distinguished assemblage, impatient of details, and unable to restrain itself, broke into the Kentish
fire, led by Mr. Sims REEVES (a Kentish man), who then struck up Musical Honours, in testimony of Mr. PUNCH's
services to the divine art of melody.
MR. Punch arose, visibly affected.
“ Bless you,” he faltered. “It's all true-all-every word of it: and more. Alone I did it. Happiest day
of
my life. Never so prosperous. Never had so splendid Circ'lation. An Institush'n-Country. Heart too full for
-for-eloquensh. Bless you all. Invite you all to Golden Wedding, this day twenty-five years at half-past six
for quarter to seven—write it down in Pocket Book. Bless you !”
A storm of plaudit, and BRITANNIA arose.
" I should have been ashamed of him," she said in a sweet voice of Power, " had he not shown emotion
on such a day. It is not his custom to be thus overcome, but it is a poor heart that never rejoices. I am
proud of him. For Five and Twenty years He has devoted all his splendid intellect and energy to my service,
and to-day, in the full vigour of his glorious genius, he vows another quarter of a century's labour in the cause
of Truth, Kindness, and Fun. And in token of his pledge and in memory of this great day, he lays on the Silver
Wedding Table his

"THE PRINCE'S DAY."
How would our young and

Improve each shining hour,
By doing what these pictures

With such artistic power.

Spring up upon an engine

Of some new railway line.
Slap-bang, the Prince is here
again,
His dress is changed, re-
mark,
And with a Colonel's pride
reviews
His soldiers in the Park.
A Ragged School he then
inspects,
And hears the urchins sing,
And is not this hard work to
set
Before a future king?
But, bless you, it's not nearly
done,
He's off unto the Strand,
Where FECHTER and PAUL
BEDFORD strive,
Which shall secure his hand,
And drag him off to see the
play,
Snug in his private box;
Till time to hear SIR RODE-

beholds
The Volunteers at drill;
Then through the Drainage

Nor fears the being ill.

And turns a railway sod;

For carrots, crabs, and cod.

People's Park,
Laid out so gay and fine.
Where salmon are brought

He next appears so free,
Then visits various picture-

And the Academy.
A ship he then attends to
launch,
And does the game in style,
A workman's exhibition

“Old KNOLLYS should bid

In dreams his Highness

FITZ-DANDO'S LAMENT.
YE good bivalves, ye savoury molluscs,
Ye living titbits, born of Ocean's mud,
Still toothsome when Time's hand hath drawn our tusks,
Regenerators bland of aged blood :
I gaze on ye in fish-shops with such eye
As might poor swain view lofty maiden's brow.
O lovely, but alas for me too high !
Three halfpence each-so much are natives now!
Ye oysters, how is it you've grown so dear,
In price ascending ever more and more,
Up up aloft as year rolls after year?
Scarce are ye now, so plentiful of yore?
An oyster famine! What's the cause of that ?
Of ocean foes some sages talk to me
That prey upon you and devour your spat,
Of stormy waves that wash it out to sea.
They tell me how you perish, left to freeze
In rigorous winter by an ebbing tide,
But you had always chances such as these,
When ye were cheap and common, to abide.
It is but in relation that you've grown
Less numerous, not absolutely few;
There are more mouths that gape-alas ! my own
But waters-now than once there were for you.
For you, but not for you alone ; for meat,
And all besides that smokes upon the board ;
Fish, fowl, eggs, butter too: things good to eat
Exceed what moderate incomes can afford.
Increase of population must be fed ;
Our numbers with prosperity extend:
Where, if we keep on going thus ahead,
Will this prosperity, ye oysters, end é
Will ye become as costly as the pearls
Torn by the diver from your kind, a prey
To decorate the brows of splendid girls?
And girls, oh how expensive, too, are they !
Ab, no more natives for the frugal swain,
No possibility of married life!
Oysters are for the rich—and he's insane
Who, rolling not in riches, takes a wife.

THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION.
Answered, with great wisdom, by a Black-haired Beauty.
My Mother bids me dye my hair
The fashionable hue,
Which women now so often wear,
And Nature never grew.
She bids me at their chignons peep,
And see how fair are they :
But will dyed hair its colour keep?
And won't it soon turn grey ?
I see girls in the gay saloon,
Or on the grand parade,
And wonder in my heart how soon
Their hair's light hue will fade.
Each night before they go to sleep
They dye it, I dare say:
But will dyed hair its colour keep?
And won't it soon turn grey ?
My hair is like the raven's wing,
So jet black are its curls :
What if away my fears I fling,
And dye, like other girls ?
In potash if my head I steep,
I may be fair as they :
But will dyed hair its colour keep?
And won't it soon turn grey ?
And then, who knows P "Revenge !” may be
Soon outraged Nature's call :
And, haply, on ſair heads you 'll see
The blight of baldness fall!
While such dread thoughts upon me crecp,

ALAS! where is the good old ale,
The brave strong beer of yore?
That famous liquor is on sale,
At any tap no more.
A few old farmers, here and there,
May brew right stingo still ;
But you scarce meet it anywhere,
Go wheresoe'er you will.
That ale, the "jolly good and old,” |
The good old Bishop sung;
'Twould warm the heart, as down it rolled,
And tingle on the tongue.
That mighty, ale cheered copper nose,
And, nearly as might be,
Rejoiced the soul like some grand close

COMPETITION IN THE TEMPLE.
ACCORDING to a contemporary, 'a sort of conpetitive examination
for the Readership of the Temple,” now vacant, is going on at the
Temple Church. There were 136 candidates for this office, but the
Benchers of the Inner Temple, with whom the appointment for this
time rests,' have reduced their numbers by 130, leaving half-a-dozen to
compete for it by celebrating divine service each in his turn. So two
of these reverend gentlemen did duty last Sunday week, two last
Sunday, and the last two will have their innings in the reading desk
and the pulpit on Sunday, Feb. 4. This certainly seems all fair enough,
but is not the sense of justice, rather than that of reverence, gratified
by the exhibition of six parsons reading, praying, and preaching against
each
other for a situation ? Does not this competition in surplices look

THE ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Thursday, February 1, 1866. The new Parliament met. MR. Deni-
SON was for the third time elected Speaker. MR. DISRAELI complained
that a Conservative had not been allowed to second the nomination of
a gentleman unanimously approved. MR. GLADSTONE intimated that
he had assumed the leadership of the House, and hoped for support.
He gracefully alluded to the difficulty any one must feel who succeeded
LORD PALMERSTON, “What shall the man do that cometh after the
king ?” MR. BRIGHT complained that Members who dined with the
SPBAKER were obliged to wear Court dress, or uniform. Swearing then
commenced, and was heard, at intervals, until the following Tuesday,
when the Session was inaugurated in the usual manner. Mr. Punch
has no particular remark to make upon the preliminary proceedings,
except to note that about a fourth of the new House consists of new
men, and that the old ones seem awfully afraid lest the nodi homines
should not behave themselves properly. We trust that such anticipa-
tions are unfounded, and that the various hints given by the SPEAKER,
and others, on the day of meeting, will produee the desired effect of
enforcing tolerable conduct in such persons as STUART MILL, FAWCETT,
THOMAS HUGHES, and other thoughtless youths. Mr. Punch's co-
operation, for the purpose of preserving order, may be relied upon
throughout a Session which promises to afford him much matter for
pensive contemplation.

But let it evermore remain

brush, would as effectually rout HER MAJESTY's Inspector of Schools ?
Would not a ducking in a pond have been more than enough for the
purpose of making him keep away? And, in the opinion of ARCH-
DEACON DENISON, would not that summary immersion combine too
much of the practice of the Baptists with the theory of the Anglo-
Catholic School?

BEER O. BOSH.
In a recently tried case, which every one is talking of, the Rev. Dr.
NORTHCOTE, giving evidence as the Principal of Oscott College, said
he thought it was a sin”
” for lads to go into a public-house to get a
glass of beer. If DR. NORTHCOTE be justified by the creed which he
professes in holding this opinion, DR. PUNCH, for bis soul's sake, and
for his body's also, is heartily rejoiced that he is not a Roman Catholic.
When a schoolboy, DR. Punch bad an amazing thirst for beer, and
does not mind confessing that he sometimes condescended to drink it
at a "public." Verily, if it be sin for boys to take a glass of beer, we
ought to place the beverage beyond their means if possible: and for
their soul's sake should quadruple, and not reduce, the Malt-Tax.
Dr. Punct sincerely trusts that the lads at Oscott College will not
be rude enough to serenade their Principal some evening, with some
such song as this :-
Solo.
Says DOCTOR N. “For you, young men,
Å terrible end is near :
'Tis a mortal sin, at a roadside inn,
To drink e'en a glassful of beer.

THE SATURDAY POPS.
SATURDAY pops with riflemen are generally pop-ular; for, being a
half-holiday, the day is pretty often used by them
for target practice.
But other “ Pops" are audible than those made by an Enfield. There
are the “ Monday Pops” for instance; and who, possessing ears and
brains, bath not heard their pleasant music? So popular are these
“Pops” that the room where they are listened to will often hardly
hold the audience; and their director therefore wisely has determined
upon letting off some extra Monday Pops on Saturdays. There may
seem to be some smack of Irish Bullism in this ; but MR. BULL, when
he is pleased, cares little if an Irish Bull be found in that which pleases
him. If he were asked by any chance-
“Which is the properest day for Pops ? Saturday? eh ? or Monday?"
MR. BULL, if he be musical, would probably reply-
“Each is the properest day for Pops. So better have two than one day."

schütz, the Saturday Pops this year are Seven. Six, will achieve

Captain O'Leary and Miss Roberts—REPORT IT “ AWFULLY JOLLY.” Miss Roberts' Parents-REPORT IT “SOMETHING DREADFUL."
LINES BY A CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT MARINER.
ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.
Wish ye, sons of Alma Mater,
Long lost laurels to replace?
Listen to a stout old Pater,
Once renowned in many a race.
Now, alas ! I'm fat and forty,
And my form grows round to view;
And my nose is rather “porty,"
But my heart is still light-blue.
'Tis as bad as an emetic,
E'en my 'baccy I refuse,
When I hear that sports alhletic,
Interfere with Cambridge crews.
Once a Grecian runner famous,
Scorned to fight his country's foes;
And to Greece, as some to Camus,
Caused innumerable woes.
When I hear the voice parental
Cry, “my youngster shall not row!”
Then my wrath is transcendental,
Then my words with vigour flow.
Sires, with hearts of alabaster,
Your stern "vetos” yet you'll rue;
When ye see a sixth disaster,
Overwhelm your loved light-blue.
But whate'er to Cambridge happen,
Sons of Cam behave like men!
Rally round your royal Cap’n,
King of Lake, and King of Fen!
Fortune helps the brave who court her,
Only to yourselves be true;
And perhaps, on Putney's water,
Victory will crown light-blue.
When your Cox'en cries “all ready,”
Be alert, dismiss all napping;
Get well forward, all sit steady,
Grasp the oar, avoid all “capping."
Shoulders square, backs straight, eyes ever
Fixed upon the back before ;
Then all eight, with one endeavour,
Dip at once the bladed oar.
Catch your stroke at the beginning,
Then let legs with vigour work:
Little hope bas he of winning,
Who his "stretcher” loves to sbirk.
Let your rigid arms, extended,
Be as straight as pokers two;
And until the stroke is ended,
Pull it, without jerking, through!
Thus all disputations spurning,
Ye, ere many a year has past,
While old Fortune's wheel is turning,
Victory shall taste at last.
Ere some Ministerial Cox'en,
Finds a cure for Plague of Cattle ;
Ye shall triumph over Oxon,
On your watery field of battle.

THE RAILWAY DESPOTS,
We are monarcbs of all we survey,
Our progress there's none to dispute:
From the centre our lines, to the sea,
Branches new, all around, ever shoot.
O Solitude! where are thy charms,
If we choose, that we cannot deface,
And destroy, with discordant alarms,
The peace of a beautiful place ?
We are out of legality's reach,
We may take land or leave it alone;
Need but fee certain lawyers for speech,
By forced sale to make it our own.
The public may not want our train,
Our railway desire not to see ;
But you 're governed by mercantile men,
The strongest among them are we.

Bestowed, in a cottage, on man;
As happy as dove is with dove,
Let people enjoy while they can.
For any fond pair from their cage,
If we want it, we drive without ruth;
Pull down the Retreat of old age,
And raze the Asylum of youth.
Extension! what treasure untold,
Resides in that oft-spoken word !
What visions of silver and gold,
Which traffic may some day afford.
Where the sound of the train-starting bell
Lone valleys and rocks never heard ;
Never scented the smoke and the smell,
Or swarmed when a sabbath appeared.
Ye victims, whose rights are our sport,
Go howl on the desolate shore,
We win the Committee's report,
And your homesteads shall know you no more.

There many and mighty are we.

On his logs whom we don't want to see !
How fool we the national mind
To give up all else for quick flight!
What a trophy we reared in yon blind
Excluding St. Paul's from the sight!
When we think of a neighbouring land,
We imagine ourselves to be there.
Would its people and Government stand
Such doings as ours, if we were ?
But we've upset the humble-bees' nest;
Of a swarm round our ears we're aware ;

WILD SPORT AT WILLINGHAM,
We have yet a good deal to learn from our French neighbours, but
not so much as we had. There was a time when our ideas of feathered
game were limited to the birds named in the game list. Now, though
it cannot, indeed, be said that nous avons changé tout cela, the truth,
nevertheless, is that we have changed some of it. At any rate, some
of us have changed the old English ideas which once prevailed on that
subject for those which are generally entertained in France. Witness
the subjoined account, from the Retford and Gainsborough News, of
some shooting which certainly comes under the head of le sport :-
WILLINGHAM.-This village was enlivenod on Wednesday, the 17th inst., by a little
blackbird shooting. Large numbers turned out with guns, and about 30 birds were
killed, two shooting six each. One sportsman had made a bet that he would kill
Slx, and he succeeded in winning his wager, but not without great difficulty. A
capital spread was provided in the evening at Mr. RoBT. TORN's, the Hulf Moon, to
which about 17 sat down. The "crack-shots" fired three volleys just before going in
to supper. A band of music was in the vicinity, and altogether the event caused
considerable stir and enjoyment.
In the estimation of JACQUES BONHOMME, a black-cock is identical
with a cock blackbird, and the blackbird-shooters of Willingham appear
to have quite adopted M. BONHOMME's view of black game. A whole
village capable of being “enlivened by a little blackbird shooting
must very nearly resemble one whose inhabitants would all be thrown
into a state of excitement by the news that JULES or ALPHONSE had
caught a minuow, or shot a tom-tit. The firing, on the part of the
"crack shots," of volleys in the air before going in to supper, was a piece
of fun evidently, like most of our contemporary dramas, borrowed from
the French. So, clearly, was the employment of the band of music,
whose triumphant strains resounded to celebrate the blackbird battue.
Perhaps the fou de joie that preceded the supper of our Gallicised
merlecides was the death of a barn-owl.
The blackbird is a destructive mischievous bird, he kills and eats the
snails, which might, and perhaps soon will, .be food for the "crack
shots" of Willingham, who are doubtless aware that those crustacea
are included in our lively neighbours' dietary. The blackbird also
destroys slugs, and robs the gardener of them as well as snails. He is
likewise, for one, the vile early bird that picks up the innocent worm,
and the noise which he makes, called his song, is merely an utterance
of exultation in the prospect of prey, and forebodes rain.
Courage, men of Willingham; shoot cock-robins as well as black
birds. This little warbler—the cock-robin-is eaten with bread crumbs.
Shoot him now, when the pairing season has commenced; shoot him,
cook him, and eat him too, à la Française. Shoot and eat the gold-
finches as well, and the linnets, and the wrens, and all the other little
birds that devour so many caterpillars. Shoot ducks, and geese, and
barn-door fowls, and to signalise in the highest style your enthusiasm
for la chasse, go and shoot foxes. After that, get played in to supper
to the tune of The Huntsman's Chorus, and then sit ye down, my
masters, and fall to, not on a venison pasty, marry, no, but on

One thing I will do,
Slip in a clause or two,
Giving the franchise to lodgers.

Benches with friends will be full;
LOWE scan it kindly,
ROEBUCK don't blindly

To shun Reform riot,

Chasing and casting,
Deft men with chisel and hammer.

Her shadow lengthened toward the east.

With seven towers twelve inches high.

A baby castle, all a-flame
With many a flower that hath no name.
O miserie !
It had a little moat all round:
A little drawbridge too she found,

Like her in radiant locks arrayed .

expected to reach about the 10th of January. The Earl thought this
to be very satisfactory intelligence, but LORD ELLENBOROUGH shook
his noble head.
Very graceful speeches from EARL GRANVILLE, who, in moving the
Second Reading of the Royal Annuity Bills, gave the most pleasant
description of the amiable characters of the illustrious young personages
for whom the country so gladly makes provision.
MR. SPEAKER had injured himself, while riding, and was obliged to
inform the House that he was in acute pain, and could not preside.
MR. DODSON, therefore, became First Commoner, and had to call SIR
MORTON PETO to order for describing SERJEANT GASELEE (perhaps
not inaccurately) as his honourable and excitable friend.
MR. THOMAS HUGHES's proposals for compelling Railway Companies
to provide houses for the working men whom they ejected, were dis-
cussed and rejected. LORD STANLEY urged that the plan would create a
new and strange tenant-right, and that Parliament could not reasonably
give an occupier more right against a company than he had against bis
landlord, who could turn him out at a week's notice. This is a good
business argument, of course, only the landlord usually permits a man
to stay while he pays bis rent, and the Railway's avowed object is in.
stantly to get rid of him. And in getting rid of him and hundreds more,
en masse, it inflicts injary by making new lodgings scarce and expensive.
MR. HUGHES stated that the Companies themselves admit this, and
that some of them are prepared to make concessions. Are there not
thousands of Arches that could be made into tenements ?
The first Reform gun fired. Arm, arm! it is, it is, the cannon's
opening roar. MR. GLADSTONE laid the statistics on the table,
SIR ROBERT PEEL made an able and elaborate speech against Coal
Smoke, and people had better notice what Y says on the subject. That
Final knows all about it, and declares that we are rapidly and wantonly
exhausting our coal, and when that shall be gone, woe to the manufac-
tures of England.
MR. GLADSTONE made an amusing speech about Dogs, for, like
Mr. Punch, he can smile on the eve of battle. He seemed to intimate
that he should abolish the present Dog-tax, which it is hard to collect,
and make everybody who keeps a dog pay a small sum-say five
shillings for a licence. This plan, sternly carried out, will abate a great
nuisance.
Navy Estimates were taken, and after the House had refused to
abolish logging in the Army (it is more satisfactory to read that the
practice is dying out), the Commons dispersed. Their next meeting
was to confront The Reform Bill.
William Whewell.
BORN: 1795.
DIED: MARCH 6, 1866.
GONE from the rule that was questioned so rarely,
Gone from the seat where he laid down the law;
Gaunt, stern and stalwart, with broad brow set squarely
O'er the fierce eye, and the granite-hewn jaw.
No more the great Court shall see him dividing
Surpliced crowds thick round the low chapel door :
No more shall idlers shrink cow'd from his chiding,
Senate-house cheers sound his honour no more.
Son of a hammer-man : right kin of Thor, he
Clove his way thorough, right onward, amain;
Ruled when he'd conquered, was proud of his glory,
Sledge-bammer smiter, in body and brain.
Sizar and master,-unhasting, unresting;
Each step a triumph, in fair combat won-
Rivals he faced like a strong swimmer breasting
Waves that, once grappled with, terrors have none.
Trinity marked him o'ertopping the crowd of
Heads and Professors, self-centred, alone :
Rude as his strength was, that strength she was proud of,
Body and mind, she knew all was her own.
“Science his strength, and Omniscience his weakness,"
So they said of him, who envied his power :
Those whom he silenced with more might than meekness,
Carped at his back, in his face fain to cower.
Milder men's graces might in bim be lacking,
Still he was honest, kind hearted and brave:
Never good cause looked in vain for bis backing,
Fool he ne'er spared, but he never screened knave.
England should cherish all lives, from beginning
Lowly as bis to such honour that rise:
Lives, of fair running and straightforward winning,
Lives, that so winning, may boast of the prize.
They that in years past have chafed at his chiding,
: They that in boyish mood strove 'gainst his sway,
Boys' hot blood cooled, boys' impatience subsiding,
Rev'rently think of “the Master” to-day.
Counting his courage, bis manhood, his knowledge,
Counting the glory he won for us all,
Cambridge-not only his dearly loved College-
Mourns his seat empty in chapel and hall.
Lay him down, here-in the dim ante-chapel,
Where NEWTON's statue looms ghostly and white,
Broad brow set rigid in thought-mast’ring grapple,
Eyes that look upwards for light--and more light.
So he should rest-not where daisies are growing:
Newton beside him, and over his head
Trinity's fall tide of life, ebbing, flowing,
Morning and evening, as he lies dead.
Sailors sleep best within boom of the billow,
Soldiers in sound of the shrill trumpet call:
So his own Chapel his death sleep should pillow,
Loved in his life-time with love beyond all.

TAE POPE'S OWN BRIGADE.
ACCORDING to a correspondent of the Débats the Pope's
old soldiers are greatly disgusted with his Holiness's new
army, consisting of recruits from France, Belgium, Holland,
and Switzerland, of the class, loafer, whose appearance,
language, and manners " indicate that they belong to the
very lowest classes of society":
“They are disliked not only by the people but by the military
themselves; and there has already arisen in the Papal barracks more
than one quarrel between the old soldiers and their new comrades,
The Zouaves especially are humiliated by the strange companions
imposed upon them; for this aristocratic corps, composed originally
of the flower of the Franco-Belgian gentry, is animated by really
chivalrous sentiments."
The army of the Popz is otherwise called the Pontifical
legion. His new army, perhaps, will be well so called. It
seems to consist of soldiers of whom you may say that their
name is legion. The Pope's Own may be regarded as a
denomination convertible with a synonym for the Inns of
Court Volunteers. They may also be considered to bear a
strong resemblance to Falstaff's ragged regiment. Pro
Nono surely would be ashamed to march through Coventry
with them, if Coventry lay in bis way. No wonder that
any decent soldiers are disgusted with such comrades.
Quartered with a rabblement of tag.rag-and-bobtail, the
chivalrous and enthusiastic Papal Zouaves, as many of
them as have read, and are versed in SHAKSPEARE, are now
prepared to answer the conundrum, that might be pro-
posed to them, “Why is Popery like misery?” Their
reply, of course, would be, Because it acquaints men
with strange bedfellows."

ENTOMOLOGICAL JOURNALISM.
Success to the new publication named in the
ensuing paragraph extracted from a contem-
porary :-
“ SUBURBAN LITERATURE.—Last week there appeared
an addition to our weekly literature, the suburban village
of Hornsey having put forth a periodical which is to
remedy all local abuses and supply all local wants. The
name chosen is the Hornsey Hornet, and the profits are
to be devoted to the relief of the village newsman,
named KNIGHT, who lost his sight while working as a
compositor."
The appearance of the Hornsey Hornet will
doubtless be the signal for the outcoming of other
kindred and alliterative insects in the neighbour-
hood of London. We may expect soon to see a
Hampstead Humble Bee, and a Wimbledon Wasp.
All these, of course, will be satirical papers, and
regular stingers, to which, perhaps, the Woolwich
Working Bee will be added, to be followed, pos-
sibly, by the Dulwich Drone. From the Bees

MR. BRIGHT, who, he said, ruled over EARL RUSSELL, and
was the presiding spirit of this movement. Read this
speech, Materfamilias, if you want to enjoy artistic
sarcasm. Perhaps the hit most laughed at was the com-
paring MR. GLADSTONE to the Amateur Casual. The CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER had plunged into a dark muddy
pool, and had been soiled and shivering in questionable
company ever since. He finished with scoff at the small
but noisy party which had got up the Reform question.
The debate was adjourned, but not until MR. CHILDERS
had carried the Second Reading of a Bill wbich may be
much bumbler, but wbich may not seem so in some thought-
ful men's eyes, a Bill enabling Government to lend money
for improving the dwellings of the Labouring Classes.
We don't care much about election petitions. Some-
times they are the result of rage, sometimes engines of ex-
tortion, sometimes undesirable proofs that pot is as black
as kettle. But a name came up as that of somebody who
would not proceed with some petition, and the petitioner's
name is WELLINGTON SHEGOG. We must embalm such a
name, as the greatest curiosity of nomenclatural literature.
Tuesday. MR. ROBERT Lowe opened the debate, and
dwelt with exceeding savageness upon the horrible character
of the Lower Orders, the perfection of our present system,
and the danger of disturbing it. He was utterly unjust to
the class to which alone an argument on this Bill could apply.
But be trumped MR. GLADSTONE's Latin very happily
MR. VILLIERS could not agree with him, and thought that
the people, properly so called, had given signal proof of
their fitness for political power.
Among the speakers was MR. ARTHUR Peel, youngest
son of the SIR ROBERT. His maiden speech was for the
Bill, and the House took special and kindly notice of him,
as English gentlemen might have been expected to do by
a son of the great Commoner. He called MR. Lowe a
Goliath of Logic, and favoured him with a well-flung stone.
MR. MILLER opposed, but his speech was chiefly remark-
able for its preternatural courage. He actually revived
poor dear old SIBTHORPE's Timeo Danaos.
MR. WHITESIDE was dasbing, as usual. He regretted the
days when LORD PALMERSTON reigned, and everything was
quiet and no nonsense.

Mr. Pippins. "Haw, WEALLY, THA-ANKS, NO! I–I WEALLY SHOULDN'T KNOW A SOUL THERE ! ”
WHAT THE SHEEP THOUGHT OF IT.
An ancient shepherd, hight JOHN RUSSELL,
But we shall have to be reformed.
Once stout, though now
sore shrunk in muscle,
Permit me to observe, politely,
Summoned, one day, his flock together,
Active and passive differ slightly.
Under the lead of their bell-wether-
I can remember Thirty-Two,
“Dear sheep,” quoth he, “Reform is needed;
And what it brought, as well as you.
I tried it once, and it succeeded.
One main result of our then votes
Your wool's improved, and more 's got off it,
Was to cut certain sheepish throats.”
Till each year's clip brings larger profit ;
Quoth RUSSELL, "Yes : some rotten brothers'-
You've figer points, your joints cut neater,
2o the great blessing of the others.”
Your mutton's juicier and sweeter:
" True," quoth the ram-"true-with a but ;
Nay, you 're not only better eating,
Their throats, who said so, were not cut;
But there's more music in your bleating :
But when you chose that lot for killing,
Till all who shear, taste, hear, or view,
You never asked if they were willing,
Say, 'Bless the Bill of Thirty-Two!'
Japanese style, the knife to snatch,
And even those who feared that movement,
And cheerfully themselves dispatch.
Are driv'n to own your vast improvement.
The country, keen to have their lives,
Now, if Reform Bill number one
Supplied the butchers and the knives.
For fleece and flesh so much has done,
Touching Reform Bill number two-
Think what ideal wool and mutton
Death to us, p'raps, if sport to you-
Bill number two your backs will put on!
There is one question I must put-
So to Reform what say you l-Ha?”.
How many throats are to be cut ?”
The sheep responsive bleated "Baa!”
“The question 's idle," quoth the swain,
“Baa me no baas !” the shepherd cried,
“Yourselves shall deal the wholesome pain :
“My hobby I again bestride;
With your own hands let out the blood
Some five false starts I on that hobby
That's wanted for the general good !!”.
Have made, and never reached the lobby,
" Thank you!” the ancient ram replied,
But now, once more in the pig-skin,
“The privilege should rouse our pride ;
I mean to run, and hope to win.
But, sheep or men, Sir, life is life,
“Hear!” bleated here and there a lamb,
And if you mean to use the knife,
When slow stepped forth an aged ram,
Don't leave to us its application,
With curling horns that, wide outspread
But go for butchers to the nation.
Like wisdom's wig, adorned his head,
Proclaim our doom : let England view it ...
“Up to Reform," quoth he, “You're warmed :
If she likes, she 'll send bands to do it.”

AUGUSTUS SMITH, of Scilly,
By Piper's Hole he swore
That the proud Lord of Brownlow
Should keep the waste no more.
By Piper's Hole he swore it,
And named a trysting night,
And bade bis myrmidons ride forth,
By special train from London's north,
To venge the Common Right.
Where on the street of Drummond
Four Doric columns frown,
Where the gigantic STEPHENSON
On his own line looks down,
The stalwart navvies gathered,
From lodgings far and near;
Strong were the crowbars in their hands,
Stronger their hope for beer.
Loured the foul London gaslights,
And made the gloom more deep,
The million-peopled city's sons
Were in their early sleep,
When from the Euston Station
Glided the special train
That bore the force that went to win
Berkhampstead's waste again.
And sternly rode each navvy,
The crowbar in his gripe,
And scornful of the snob-made law,
A fire in every pipe;
They rode in solemn silence,
And not a navvy knew,
The leader whom he went to serve,
The work he went to do.
Thine old Red Cap, O Mother!
That train went rushing by,
Where Willesden bears JACK SHEPPARD'S
name
In holiest memory.
Where points to Heaven the spire
On Harrow's haunted Hill,
Where Pinner's perky stockbrokers
In cockney nests were still.
Through Bushey and through Watford,
And on to wild Boxmoor
That special train its weighty freight
Of rugged champions bore.
LAY OF MODERN ENGLAND.
On, the steam-demon bore them,
Nor flagged upon the wing,
Until he lighted with his load
At Baptist-chapelled Tring.
Then spoke a voice accustomed
To bid strong men obey :
I know full well whose voice it was :
His name I may not say.
This way," was all He uttered,
As brief was their reply,
The navvy wastes few idle words-
The navvies grunted “Ay.”
They marched three miles in silence,
The road was dark and drear,
But thought upheld the navvy's heart:
The pleasant thought of beer.
They reached Berkhampstead Common,
Or that which had been one,
Until by Ashridge's proud Lord
The feudal deed was done.
There, miles of iron railing
Scowled grimly in the dark,
Making what once was common,
The Lord of Brownlow's Park:
His rights that Lord asserted,
Rights which they hold a myth,
The bold Berkhampstead Commoners,
Led by AUGUSTUS SMITH.
Spoke out the nameless Leader,
“ That Railing must go down."
Then firmer grasped the crowbar
Those hands so strong and brown,
They march against the railing,
They lay the crowbars low,
And down and down for many a yard
The costly railings go.
Strong are the navvies' muscles,
The navvies work like men :
Where was the Lord of Brownlow,
Where was brave Paxton then ?
Where was the valiant GROVER,
The gallant STOCKEN where,
And where was he who smokes the hams,
And makes the Earl his care!
Yes, where was grocer Hazell,
Who raised the duteous song:
“As how a Lord like Brownlow's Lord
Could never do what's wrong?
The Earl and all his champions
Were sleeping far away,
And ere the morn, upon the gorse
Three miles of railing lay.
“Hurrah !" the navvies shouted :
In siglit a horseman glides :
See on his cob, with bob, bob, bob,
The duteous HAZELL rides:
To do his Lordsbip service
Comes riding through the mirk,
And bids the navvies let him know
Who brought them to their work.
Answer the stalwart navvies,
Who smoke the bam-smoker's gama,
“ Behold'st thou, HAZELL, yon canal ;
Would'st like to swim the same?
If not, with beer this instant
Thyself and cob redeem,"
And round trim as they spoke, they drew,
And edged bim near the stream.
So down went BROWNLOW's railings,
And down went HAZELL's beer,
And from the gathering crowd upgoes
One loud and lusty cheer.
For carriage, gig, and dog-cart
Come rushing on the scene,
And all Berkhampstead hastes to see
Where BROWNLOW's rails had been.
And husbands, wives, and children,
Went strolling through the gorse,
And cried, “We've got our own again,
Thanks to your friendly force."
They cut green little morsels
As memories of the Band,
Whose lusty arms and iron bars
Had freed the Common land.
Bold was the deed and English
The Commoners have done,
Let's hope the law of England, too,
Will smile upon their fun.
For our few remaining Commons
Must not be seized or sold,
Nor Lords forget they do not live
In the bad days of old.

Fenianism, and he said he would give something to catch

he wouldn't believe it. I am having a very pleasant time
of it, as there is still plenty of money left: when it is
finished I shall, I think, take to Spiritualism, or go on the
stage as a star.
The report that MR. STEPHANOS Xenos is myself in
disguise is calculated to produce a wrong impression.
I admire the Greeks.

my card and address. You may forward the number to me

with me for the hire of your room at the Egyptian Hall
during the Season ? I propose giving an entertainment to
be called, "STEPHENS at Home, and the Police Abroad."
It will be very amusing, as I have a large and varied ward-

The castle weeds have grown so tall

The little drawbridge hangs awry,
The little flowery moat is dry!
o miserie !
And the wind, it soughs and sighs alway
Through the grey willows, night and day!

And evermore two willows there
Do weep, whose boughs are always bare:
miserie !
At all times weep they, in and out
Of season, turn and turn about !
miserie !
But later, when the year doth fall,
And other willows, one and all,
O míserie !
In yellowing and dishevelled leaf
Sway haggard with their autumn grief,
* miserie !
Then do these leafless willows now
Put forth a rosebud from each bough!
miserie !
What time Gauwaine, with spurless heels,
Barefoot (but not bare-headed) kneels
miserie !
Between! ... as fits a bigamous knight
Twice widowed in a single night:

And then, for that promiscuous way
And every time they find a bud,
Of axing Hebrews in broad day,
They pluck it, and it bleeds red blood.

And when they pluck a full blown rose,
Of Eastern origin remote. ...
And breathe the same, its colour goes!

But with Gauwaine alone at night,
Of one who, wandering, buys and sells ! The willows dance in their delight!

What time the knights and damsels fair, The rosebuds wriggle in their bliss,
Of Arthur's court come trooping there, And lift them for his lips to kiss !
miserie !

They come in dresses of dark green,
And if he kiss a rose instead,
Two damsels take a knight between :
It blushes of a deeper red !

O many-headed multitude,
And wan white eyelids droop and rise Who read these rhymes that run so rude,

Reform debate, startling one Minister, pinking another, and flooring a
third with rollicking ferocity. If the savage is pardoned on account
of the climate, the senator may perhaps justly complain if we make no
allowance for the fervid atmosphere of the Commons. In any case
much mischief is done by male furies of either class, between whom
there is a very simple distinction-one being complexionally dark and

PUNCH'S PROGRAMME.
Now that our Great Men we invite,
To hoist their flag, and name their platform;
To put their creed in black and white,
And state their faith in this or that form-
Now BRIGHT and GLADSTONE on the stump,”
Try“ high falutin'," à la Pogram,
Why should not Punch with fashion jump,
And of Reform put forth his programme?
Pace JOHN BRIGHT—no recreant he,
Neither conspirator nor dirty;
He maintains sound Reform to be
In sixty-six what 'twas in thirty.
Thankful for rest, but not opprest
By nightmare fears of Revolution,
By needful change he's game to test
His faith in England's Constitution.
He holds—for ayo, as for the hour-
All class dominion an evil:
Men-angels e'en, with unchecked power,
Would soon be apt to play the devil.
One class-rule may be somewhat worse,
Another elass-rule a shade better;
But the best class-rule is a curse,
And of all curses the begetter.
The ruling class in times gone by-
Those good old times." old Tories prate of
Was that which snobs revere as "high,"
And still are proud to swell the state of.
Créme de la créme they were, no doubt,
With John BULL's milch.cow's udder brimming ;
Low people from the pale shut out,
And theirs the exclusive right of skimming.
All classes thus by one were bilked,
Till the flood rose and over-swept it,
The State Cow tired of being milked,
Kicked down the pale and those who kept it.
And the Great Act of Thirty-two,
Ushered the mighty middle class in,
Where Rank and Title hitherto
Alone had been allowed to pass in.
Since then the middle class has ruled,'
And well it has fulfilled the function;
We're better fed and taught, more schooled
To tolerance, charity, compunction.
But though of class-rules this be best-
So huge its range from high to humble-
Class-rule it still must be confest,
And, as such, smacks too much of Bumble :
Shows too much reverence for the shop,
Not enough reverence for the nation;
Is prone a weak good cause to drop,
Too quick to shout “Centralisation.”
Apt of its own faults to lose sight,
In passing judgment on its neighbour's;
Prompt to own Capital's full right,
But not so quick in owning Labour's.
And therefore Punch would have let in
To help choose our collective sages
The best of those who toil to win
By honest day's work fair day's wages.
So leavening what now needs must sour,
And quickening what now is slowest,
And drawing 'neath the base of power
Our largest stratum, if our lowest.
That so class-rule may be no more,
All orders joining to choose members,
To heal the hates and feuds of yore,
And stamp out faction's long-lived embers.
Into the Nation's Treasury
Each class its mite of wisdom bringing,
Till all round truths we come to see,
Many small lamps one great light flinging.
But all the more class-rule he hates-
Middle-class rule the more he'd leaven-
Letting hand-workers through the gates
That close the entrance of St. Stephen,
A FEMININE OLD JURY.
MY VERY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THOUGH a lady, I am not at all nervous about my age. I am eighty-two,
and as a lady I ask your advice, knowing you to be a perfect gentleman and
a man of sense, and I feel assured you will politely give it, for I believe there
is scarcely a clever girl in the kingdom that is not proud to be your Correspondent.
My grandson, who is an Equity.draftsman, tells me that it is in contemplation to
make an alteration in our juridical system, under which juries will be composed
exclusively of old women.
Now I do think this very hard, but my relative says, that if I can go to parties
and stay till two, and stand up in a country dance, and read my Punch without
spectacles, I am qualified for any thing. Still at my time of life to be set to study

Of course I know the worth of woman's wit, and that age carries with it an air of
authority, and I know further, that we of the "old guard” can stand our ground
when simpering Misses (in military parlance-raw levies) would be put to flight. If
therefore the Judges and the Legislature feel strongly that a great juridical reform
is called for, I for one shall cheerfully go to Court in obedience to the mandate of
my Sovereign. We live in trying times. I mean in times very trying to the
temper, and I should like to know if you can devise any better means than those
above suggested for raising our judicial institutions in public esteem. The majesty
of the law must undoubtedly be upheld,
and in order that it may be respected by
the masses, it is necessary that its decisions should be consistent both with
justice and with common sense.

reasons for introducing the Bill, MR. JOHN MURRAY had
kindly allowed him to see the new number of the Quarterly,
just before its publication, and there is in it a slashing article
against the Bill. This article received the honour of quotation
by MR. GLADSTONE, and some of its statements he described
(with a Shakspearian quotation) as lies. Some persons think
that the writer is in the House. He then proceeded to dilate
upon the improved condition of the working class, owing to
religion, education, and the penny press, which latter he praised
sky-high. He urged that the working class had five-twelfths
of the income of the country, and only one-seventh of its elec-
toral power. That they would not, as apprehended, vote en
masse. That they will not be able to rise, in any fair propor-
tion, to the franchise, for that it at present excludes any man
who cannot earn 358. a week. That calculatious as to the
expected transfer of power showed that, should the Bill pass,
the working classes would be in a minority in 538 seats, against
120 seats in which they might be in a majority. He then
adverted to re-distribution, and again refused to proceed with
any other part of the subject until after the Second Reading.

ST. PATRICK THE PROTESTANT.
An excellent new Ballad, inscribed to the Irish Church.
“Learned persons bave ably proved that St. Patrick did not receive
consecrntion from Rome, and had nu communion with her."
."-Record.
SAINT PATRICK was a Protestant,
An ancient Irish Curate,
Did be live pow, be'd make a row
For tithes, and dues, and pew-rate.
He'd come to London every May,
Polemic and perspiring,
And in the famous Hall of “ Bray”
His red-hot shot be firing.
No doubt he'd give the Pope bis due,
Much as we give the Devil's,
Call each an Ass who goes to mass,
And sneer at “ Convent revels.”
About confessionals he'd bint
What decent folk don't mention,
And tell all tales he'd seen in print,
And some his own invention.
He'd give for doom to modern Rome
A hotter gulf than Tophet's,
Term every Priest the Evil Beast
Predicted by the prophets.
O how the Saint would make complaint
Against the legislation
That keeps Maynooth for Popish youth,
At charges of the nation !
He'd prove a People's Church was one
Tbat shuts them out with fences,
That “nation” meant eleven per cent.
Of persons in the Census.
Tbat while we care for Church repair
The State fulfils its mission,
And if there's ne'er a soul goes there,
Thank Popisb superstition.
And when he'd proved that well beloved
Establisbinent a wonder,
With awful roar he'd burl galore
Loud Calvinistic thunder.
Deny bis Church had got one smirch,
While Rome's had not a bright side-
Then take bis seat in Clarges Street,
And dine with MR., WHITESIDE.

you like, but master the speech, brethren, for it is fit that you should
comprehend this thing.
MR. DOULTON opposed the Bill, wbich MR. MILNER GIBSON defended
with bis customary fluency and good-humour. But when the Minister
cautioned the House that the working class would not know what an
amendment meant, and, were it carried, would believe that the Parlia-
ment bad declared against Reform, MR. HUGHES must have laughed.
Wbat member of a Union does not perfectly understand the rules of

promises, and the Opposition laughed. MR. GATHORNE HARDY, who
defeated MR. GLADSTONE and the intelligent part of Oxford University,
finished the evening with a speech in condemnation of the Bill.
Friday. Frightful rumours flying about. Men offered their fellow-
creatures ghastly bets touebing the fate of the F. B. It was said that
the estimated majority was dwindling, peaking, and pining. The
evictions by Election Committees were counted. Liberals said
reproacbful ibings about the stubbornness and temper of Saul, King
of Israel. Tories performed private war-dances of joy. Altogether,
we said we sniffed a Crisis..
The fifth night's debate was felt to be dull. MR. LEVESON GOWER
defended the Bill neatly. MR. GREGORY did “remember bis swasbing
blows." The Scotch Solicitor General, Mx. Young, argued closely,
for the measure. SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE Was eminently respectable,
against, and ended by opposing to Mr. GLADSTONE's Sapere aude, the
adage sat cito si sat bene. The best speech of the night, and almost
the best that bas been made for the Bill, was the eloquent and elegant
speech of MR. COLERIDGE, wbom Mr. Punch is now justified in desig-
nating as a Parliamentary ornament. MR. HORSMAN came out of the
Cave of Adullam, and spoke, but did not do much for Israel. Mr.
Bright then moved the adjournment.
MR. GLADSTONE suggested that on the Monday or Tuesday following
the debate might as well end.
MR. DISRAELI reminded the House that MR. GLADSTONE had not
been content to debate the Bill tbere, but bad made speeches for it
at Liverpool. In all, be bad spoken on it six times. He, MR.
DISRAELI, sbould like to be heard. He boped that the debate would
be finished before the end of the coming week.
An Election Committee most properly ejected SIR ROBERT CLIFTON
from Nottingbam. Before the report could be made to the House
it was said that Law bad claimed him for her own. Law is in a hurry,
said Privilege, with a stern glance at Sheriffdom.
BISMARCK-WOLF.
(4 lillle Supplement to Reineke-Fuchs.)
THERE once was a wolf, with a touch of the fox,
Not too proud a sheep-skin to put on,
Although his regard for the neighbouring flocks
Was misconstrued as relish for mutton.
When he begged they'd be friendly, and take him on trust,
And with him conclude an alliance,
The shepherds flang stones, and the sheep raised a dust,
And the dogs showed their teeth in defiance.
Some wolves, so distrusted, bad sulked, or shown light,
As one moment our wolf thought of doing,
When a very big dog with a bark that meant bite,
Trotted out for the tug that seemed brewing.
The wolf paused, as be measured the dog with his eye,
Then consulted the fox-cross within him-
“Why fight with a brute that objects to fight sby,
Aud's but dog's-meat, at best, when you skin him ?”
So, with innocent eyes and mellifluous voice,
Why these growls?” quoth the wolf, "and these tushes ?
Is't my claws and my teeth! I wear these not for choice,
But who knows what may lurk in the bushes ?
"Pray, lie quietly down, drop this show of sharp teeth,
Have no fears for yourself or your muttons :
They sleep safely who sleep my protection beneath
Wolves are watchful, and men are such gluttons !"
But the sheep-dog still growled, so the wolf tried the sheep
Dear sheep, you will listen to reason :
All this
coil about sheep-dogs and shepherds why keep?
Such distrust to my friendship is treason.
« 'Tis right, without doubt, you should be on your guard
Against rascally robbers and reivers,
But to class me amongst them, I must say is hard,
Me, the sworn foe of thieves-and receivers !
" Against sheep combining themselves to protect
I haven't the slightest objection :
'Tis but to the mode of the thing I object;
And I'll tell you my plan of protection.
“Get rid of your sheep-dogs, your shepherds and all :
Count their cost, and think how it increases :
And the will they enforce, after all, is their own,
And not yours, my dear friends, who wear fleeces.
“ Sweep this dead-weight away; in a grand vote combine,
Call an ovine assembly together;.
Speak the will of the sheep-what is sheep's will is mine :
We are brothers--the wolf and the wether!”
So suggested the wolf; the she pondered bis word,
Hummed, bawed, bleated, ba-aed-undecided :
But it didn't seem likely-the last time we beard
That the sheep by the wolf would be guided.
THE FENIAN'S REFUGE IN FRANCE.
A TELEGRAM the other day arrived from Paris, stating that :-
“ The Gazette des Elrangers of to-day announces tbat STEPHENS, the Fenian Head-
Centre, will be entertained at dinner this evening at the residence of the MARQUIS
DE BOISSY."
Of all remarkable Frenchmen the MARQUIS DE Boissy is the one
whose mental peculiarity constitutes bim the fittest bost to entertain
STEPBENS, the Fenian Head-Centre. If he only entertained STEPHENS
as well as be is accustomed to entertain both the British public and
the Frencb, STEPHENS must bave been very highly entertained, indeed.

A FUNNY TALE OF A BEAK.
This is a very funny little Cab-Case. We write on the faith of a
report in the Standard, which is babitually accurate.
MR. PALMER, of Highbury, takes a cab, and is driven to his resi.
dence, the distance being under a mile. He offers the driver, RICHARD
GRIFFITH (No. 12,835), one shilling, which is double bis fare. GRIFFITH
refuses to take "a trumpery shilling after being five hours on the
stand.” MR. PALMER conceives that he has nothing to do with the
stand, and, the fare being again refused, orders GRIFFITH to drive to
the next police-station. This MR. GRIFFITH also refuses to do, declines
to give a ticket, and tries to get away. ButiMR. PALMER seizes the
rein. Then MR. GRIFFITI raises his arm to strike him, but MR.
Palmer being firm, and a neighbour adding his remonstrances,
MR. GRIFFITH gives a ticket, and then jumps on the box, lashes his
horse, and tries to drive over MR. PALMER, who saves limb and perhaps
life by rushing into the middle of the road.
The report does not state that any defence (was offered, but that
MR. WAKELING, who appeared for the cabman, stopped MR. PALMER,
who was about to say a word in kindness for the fellow GRIFFITH.
That is a little funny. But we promised our readers something very
funny. We keep our word.
MR. BARKER, the Magistrate, fined GRIFFITH twenty shillings, which
sum, with the costs, was paid.
We thought that a Magistrate sat "for the punishment of evil-doers."
But MR. BARKER, having a fellow before him who was guilty of
attempted extortion, of insolence, of two refusals to obey the law, of
menacing an assault, and of attempt to maim if not to kill a respectable
citizen, fines him twenty shillings, -three shillings and fourpence a-piece
for each of the six offences.
Is not this a funny story? We hope MR. PALMER sees the fun.
BARKER is no biter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
HOMER RE-TRANSLATED.
A WORD WITH MR. TYRWHITT.
We hate tyranny and unkindness. We are speaking to you, MR.
TYRWHITT, Beak, to whom we have often had to speak approvingly,
but whose conduct we now feel it our duty to condemn. Why, Sir,
did you not act more tenderly towards a couple of poor policemen than
you seem to have done in a case last week?
A gentleman was accused of obstructing the police. The details are
unimportant. Two officers swore, and if their evidence did not exactly
agree, surely it was for you to reconcile it. One swore that on his way
to the station the gentleman kept in front of him, and tried to trip him
up. The other swore that the gentleman got to the station before the
police.
You, Sir, said, "If he got to the station before the police, that does
away with what the other constable said about tripping up.” And you
dismissed the gentleman.
Well, MR. I'YRWHITT, I may admit, for the purposes of argument,
that the poor officers did contradict one another. But wby did you not
make allowances! They might not have bad time to talk the matter
over sufficiently, and convince each other that there was but one story
that should be told. Sarely, when a person is charged by the police,
the course is for a Magistrate to be clear that the accused is wrong.
MR. TYRWHITT, Sir, what will become of tbe more stupid part of the
police-that is, the large majority -if Magistrates are to insist on co-
herent evidence! We have several times observed in you a disposition
to insist on accuracy of statement, and strict confirmation of allegation,
and we give you a kindly warning, from information we have received,
that this kind of thing is not admired by the police.

THREE VISIONS OF ONE HEAD.
SHE wore a wreath of roses
The night that first we met;
Her lovely face was smiling,
Beneath her curls of Jet.
Her curls of jetty brightness,
Were charmingly in tone,
With the colour on her features,
For the hue was nature's own.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now;
With the bair that Nature gave her,
Above her snowy brow.
A head of Paris fashion
When next we met, she wore;
The expression of her features,
Was sharper than before.
And standing by her side was one,
Who seemed to give her pain,
As he rubbed the reddening fluid on
What should have held a brain.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now,
With the barber's nasty liquid,
Smeared on her snowy brow.
And once again I met her,
No radiant locks were there;
An unmistaken wig she wore
Instead of lovely bair.
She weeps in silent solitude,
Because she looks so queer!
The barber's poison has destroyed
Her hair from ear to ear.
I saw her but a moment,
Nor want to see her now,
With those ugly proofs of folly
Above her snowy brow.

Of each floral and fashı'nable grace ;
The belles and the blossoms are gathered,
Each to look on the other's fair face.
Never Delhi's world-famous Dilkoosha,
With its gardens bung high in the air,
For azalea, and orchid, and fuchsia,
Could with our new Dilk-oosha compare.
And as we floor India for blossoms-
(So far our Cole their sun excels)-
Take their harems and in to boot toss 'em
Their houris, we'd beat her for belles.
Such cbeeks of true lilies and roses,
Such chignons, as true-more or less ;
Such fine figures, such dear little noses,
Such "sweet things” in bonnet and dress!
Under EDGINGTON's acres of awning,
Along ORMSON's miles of hot pipe,
From the first peep of day's West End dawning
Till the time for Eve's toilette is ripe,
Flows the tide of our fair f'wers of fashion,
Showing colour and shedding perfume,
Till they put the prize flowers in a passion,
Their rivals in beauty and bloom,
Where the rich rhododendrons are clustered,
While rose on cheek mocks rose on tree,
With an o'er-dose of loveliness flustered,
Mr. Punch in a dream seems to be.
Betwixt blossoms and belles, he supposes,
So fierce runs the fire in his veins
He is dying of too many roses
In the most aromatic of pains !
But while thus enraptured he gazes
From delicate fair ones to flowers,
Till be loses himself in the mazes
Labyrintbine of beauties and bowers,
Hark! with ring like the silv’riest of metals,
A voice the piled blossoms upheaves :
'Tis a speech from the sylph of the petals,
And this lesson he reads from the leaves :-
“Peace from flower to fair one! We greet her
In her spring growth of muslin and lace:
Such sweet, faces cannot look sweeter
For tulle's cloud or aërophant's grace.
Let pot jealousy rouse us to passion,
Common cause 'tis our duty to make,
As we 're boʻb of us victims to fashion,
Against ber our siand let us take.
“We flowers are as ill used as you are,
Dear fair, by La Mode's servile bande :
Your soft hair they twist, screw, and skewer,
And our leaves must obey tbeir commands :
When in graceful abandon we'd straggle,
They peg us down fast, trim and round,
When in gentle despondence we'd draggle,'
They tie us up tight off the ground.

And so must a plaut io iis pol :

Must be frizzled, look ugly or not!
A la chinoise, dragged back from each forehead,
All the hair in the country must be,
Or à la Grecque, all in curls o'er bead,
Be screwed at stern Fashion's decree.
"So for us, it don't matter a farden
How kind Nature meant us to grow,
If the fashion that rules in the garden
To the old-fashioned practice says 'No.'
She doubles wbat Nature made single,
Stains pet als in Nature's despite,
Till in sulky companionship mingle

THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION.
The atmosphere is an elastic fluid composed of Monthly Progress
Returns, the size of a shilling on a white ground, who are to make
themselves acquainted with tbis important part of their duty by attach-
ing the swivel to the claws of the trajectory, which scarcely deviates
from a bull's-eye three feet by two, the fixed points being thrown out
over the top of the foresight in the direction of the Officer Instructor,
who is useless and an iucumbrance to the Battalion. The ranges are to
be surveyed by a committee composed of a Stadiometer and two District
Inspectors, who are to be carefully wiped with an oiled rag until the
tendency to wink is overcome, when the danger flug will be raised at
the marker's butt, the sights being kept upright, and the practice will
be continued till he becomes a casual, when his mean deviation is to be
removed from the lock-plate by means of a diagram, kneeling, the left
eye being placed round the trigger-guard.

THE EAGLES IN CONGRESS.
" Nor will I undertake not to get back my own,
Of which that black carrion has robbed me
Screamed Italia's hot eagle, aye, robbed is the word!
Out of which he has not fought, but jobbed me.”
“Fair and softly ! ” replied the calm Eagle of France,
“Of your answers I quite read the moral;
Yon’re all willing to meet, if it's quite understood
Nothing's said about each eagle's quarrel.
"Were the Congress for peace, that might make it absurd,
But as 'tis to find plausible reason
For not making peace, your exceptions I own
Appear to me strictly in season.
“So we'll meet, and we'll talk, and if then you should fight,
Your conscience no doubt will feel easy:
As for me, I've some qualms still 'bout justice and right-
The Congress may leave me less queasy."
Thz Eagles of late had to loggerheads got
After long living happy together,
In a holy alliance of absolute sway
O'er the small fry of fur and of feather.
'Twas but last year the two German heads of the breed
Had joined in a grand federation
To dismember a poor Danish cock o' the wood,
Who objected to Germanisation.
In vain he prayed aid from the Eagle of France,
In vain from the bull-dog of Britain;
Both promised, but neither would make first advance,
So the poor bird was swooped on and smitten.
His limbs were apportioned-a drumstick to one,
A nice liver-pinion to t'other :
And psalms were intoned, and Te Deums were sung,
The cries of the victim to smother.
But in act of apportionment, fairly to fix
Six for one to the other's half dozen,
The Eagle of High Hohenzollern essayed
The Eagle of Hapsburg to cozen.
'Tis a way Eagles have, and 'tis lucky that though
In couples they hunt keen as beagles,
They are apt to fall out in dividing their prey,
On what's called “want of honour ’mong Eagles.”
Hapsburg's eagle drew up, Hohenzollern's looked big,
Each showed talons and beck-feathers ruffled,
Each appealed to the buzzards and bites that around
Uneasily sidled and shuffled.
Hapsburg swore Hohenzollern was breaking the peace ;
Hohenzollern 'gainst Hapsburg swore ditto.
Each vowed that the other, in spite of bis teeth,
Arms in self-defence forced him to get to.
Each called on the vultures and bawks of bis blood,
Of bis creed or dynastic connection,
In Vaterland's name to strike in on his side,
On pain of paternal correction.
Hohenzollern, when Vaterland's aquiline race
Hung back or adhered to his foeman,
To Italia's eagle appealed in his strait,
The eagle that once was called Roman,
And fain would be Roman again,-newly fleshed
From Magenta, Messina, Volturno;,
A bird that would gladly set lapsburg's aroast
In a hotter than Dante's Inferno.
So the quarrel spread wide and more wide, till the world
Looked agbast for the clashing of pinions,
The tearing of talons, the rending of beaks,
Through the far-spreading
Eagle dominions,
When suddenly in sailed the Eagle of France,
Calm, taciturn, lean, and long-beaded,
Called as Aquiline Arbiter down from the skies,
To avert the catastrophe dreaded.
“What! brothers use talons and claws, save for prey
On the bird-tribe, for eating that cries out ?
Forhear from such fratricide: bawks, as they say,,
'Should be too wise for picking hawks' eyes out.'
"In Congress assemble—there fix, without blows,
What birds, to what sauce, shall be eaten ;
If not, and you will fight, oæ victis, you know,-
I'll be down on you both when dead beaten."
Quoth the Eagle of Hapsburg, "I ask nothing more-
'Tis quite 'gainst my will we've been arming.'
Ditto," quoth Hohenzollern, "if I'm up in arms,
'Tis that Hapsburg's claws looked 80 alarming."
"Then a Congress," quoth Hapsburg, "but, par parenthèse,
On one point I'll no meddling submit to--
My Venetian preserves No, nor I," interposed
Hohenzollern,

THE (OR WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE) PRIZE POEM
ON VIRGIL READING HIS *NRID TO AUGUSTUS AND OOTAVIA,
When VIRGIL read his Rneid to AUGUSTUS and OCTAVIA,
Whose ladies wore waved hair, but she wore hers a great deal waveyer,
He did not rant or rave like a dissenter of Moravia,
Nor thumped be on the rostrum like a fierce converted paviour,
But he thought it wise to be upon his very best behaviour,
So spoke in tones as soft as those of parsons in Belgravia;
The Empress held a copy of the poetry which gave ho her,
And when the poet made a slip he cried out "O peccavi:” her
AUGUSTUS (who had got a crib ') observed to his OCTAVIA,
“This gentleman, my dear, I think is very very clayvier,
But as I must be off at once on business to Pavia,?
You'll take him in to lunch and give bim bits of toast and caviare." 3
They gave him meat at lunch, each slice was gravier and gravier,
Which was a sign, that for the time, he'd found imperial faviour,
And goblets of Falernian of which he loved the flaviour.
Then when he wanted to go home, they called out "Hi, a slavey here !"
Who brought a hired char'ot, swift as love-bird in an avia.

the agreeable evening by carrying through, despite Protestant
clamour, the Bill making it needless for the Queen's representatives in
Ireland to ridicule a curious dogma which most of the Irish suppose
themselves to understand, or, at least, believe.
Oh, if they'd only taken time,
Nor trusted GLADSTONE's rash impression
He'd but to cross the Rubicon,
And burn bis boats and take possession !
Had they not tried the Flouse to blind,
Till they strained party-joints to splitting ;
Treated M.P.'s like naughty boys,
To be “kept in ” an autumn sitting!
There's only one thing to be done,
For Ministers to save their bacon ;
Tbat's to re-cross the Rubicon,
To ground they ne'er should have forsaken.
Own that to swim that famous stream,
They have been too much in a hurry;
As t'other side was unknown ground,
And folks won't take Bright for their “Murray."
On the wrong side the Rubicon,
Hang me, if longer I remain;
GLADSTONE must just re-build bis boats,
And take us back again !
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RUBICON.”
(4 Groan from a mild M.P., half in and half out of the Cave.)
I am a tractable M.P.
As ever trotted to division;
A steady wheeler, safe to drive,
Ne'er with bis leaders in collision.
My aim the greatest happiness
Of (Number One) the greatest number :
My bighest hope, as Junior Lord,
Some day on Treasury-bench to slumber.
Views of my own I ne'er set up,
Indeed, in general, “views” offend me;
I ope my mouth, and shut my eyes,
And, ihankſul, take what BRAND may send me.
The sacred skirts of Government
Still holding reverently on to,
As feeling but for their safe guide
None knows where he might not have gone to.
But now we've crossed the Rubicon,
One seeks the old landmarks all in vain :
If GLADSTONE badn't burnt his boats,
We might get back again!
“Back Government, you 'scape all mess”.
This faith your wise M.P. professes :
But now supporting Government
Seems to mean getting into messes.
Left to oneself, with bed-fellows
More strange one couldn't have been huddled :
Knocked one's head against more stone walls,
Been worse misled, or more bemuddled !
By Jove, bere we bave Ministers
Tackling Reform as if they meant it!
Here's GLADSTONE hand-in-glove with BRIGHT-
'Taint natural, and he'll repent it!
No wonder that a Bill so bred
Could find no Cabinet
How could it e'er be hoped to float
When ere 'twas launched its builders split it ?
And so we crossed the Rubicon,
But nearly swamp'd by leak and strain,
With GLADSTONE swearing at the helm
He'd ne'er go back again.
But when we'd crossed, with help of BRIGHT,
The House the half-bill wished to smother;
At least, before they'd own that half,
Tuey vowed they must be shown the other.
Though GLADSTONE kicked, and winced, and frowned,
And Bright foretold terrific weather,
They both bad to eat humble pie,
And see the two halves tacked together!
Now, though the halves are made a whole,
The ill-will of the House increases :
It cheers on Lowe, at GLADSTONE girds,
And pulls his pretty groups to pieces.
And now we're getting on in June,
With four months of the Session wasted;
The Tories roar, the House is sore,
And won't be buttered, much less basted-
Although we've crossed the Rubicon,
What we're to do next who'll explain ?
If GLADSTONE badn't burnt his boats,
We might get back again!

that he will be made a Knight of the Hempen Circle. Friends at a

· UNION
HERE was truth in certain words of WORDSWORTH'S
relative to “The Old Cumberland Beggar.” A
wish expressed by the Poet on behalf of the old
beggar was :-
“May never House, misnamed of Industry,
Make him a captive !"
The old Poor-house never was a house of indus-
try, nor has the Union Workhouse hitherto deserved
any better to be so called. Oakum-picking,
cracking stones, and bone-crushing, are not in.
dustrial employments but penal tasks, designed
to plague paupers, not to occupy them, to make
them uncomfortable rather than useful, to answer,
in short, the same purpose as that of the general system of discipline which prescribes for the inmates of workhouses a coarser and
scantier diet than that awarded to convicted felons in gaol.
The exertions, however, of MR. ERNEST Hart, and other benevolent persons, have brought about the commencement of a general Work-
house Reform. Among the members of some Boards of Guardians a few have been inspired in a measure with common humanity, and the
exhortations of the Clergy, especially those of the ARCHBISHOP Of YORK, are said to have even had the effect of converting more than one
Guardian to something like a partial belief in the Christian religion. There is reason to suppose that the Guardians of St. George's,
Hanover Square, St. Pancras, the Strand Union, and other metropolitan Boards, comprise in their whole number as many as two or
three gentlemen who are beginning to think that Drves may possibly have certain duties to discharge towards LAZARUS, under penalties.
The time is therefore believed to be at hand when the work house diet-scale will be raised to a sufficiency of plain, wholesome food; when
overcrowding will cease in the sick-wards, and the patients in them will enjoy their due number of cubic feet of air ; when competent
nurses, and not drunken creatures unable to read, and accustomed to steal their beer and other stimulants, will be employed to tend them;
proper washerwomen to cleanse their linen without extorting gratuities of gin for not returning it to them steeped in filth and verminous;
when further they will receive due medical assistance duly remunerated, and not be suffered to die of neglected bedsores.
The Work house of the Future will moreover be so constituted as to merit the name which, as WORDSWORTI said, was misapplied to the
Workhouse of the Past. It will be a House of Work such as its occupants are equal to; a House of regulated Industry. A gifted
Artist bas enabled Mr. Punch to present his parochial readers, and the world at large, with the design of a Model Workhouse, of which the
idea, like all grand ideas, is taken from Nature. Its form is that of a Hive, the very emblem of Industry; the bees, old and young, all work
in their way, the former at whatever they are able to do, the latter chiefly at the three R’s and the other rudiments of learning, by whose
acquisition, when hereafter they shall have left the work house, they may be enabled to keep themselves out of it, and that so as never to
have to come back to it again. The drones, who can work and won't work alone of them all will be restricted to short commons, consisting
chiefly of skilligolee.
The Model Workhouse is appropriately flanked by the figures of two Guardian Angels, one of them represented by a Poor Law Guardian,
the other by the Workhouse Matron; whilst the Beadle's cocked-hat crowns the edifice.

my Life, is a work of fiction, he might have chosen a much more suitable
character to appear in than that of Joseph Surface : at least, if the St.
James's management would have produced The Tempest ; for then
MR. HOME might have undertaken to perform Ariel. A gentleman
whom spirits are accustomed to lift to the ceiling, and carry about over
the heads of the spectators, might in like manner be transported through
the atmospheric regions of the stage, independently of any but super-
natural machinery. At the same time the spirits might accompany
Mr. Home's songs, or those sung for him as Ariel, on the accordion,
provided the accordion could ever be got to play any other tune than
Home, Sweet Home.”
The curiosity of everybody who believes the incidents of Mr. Home's
life, whicb MR. HOme has related, will be excited to see whether, when
he plays Joseph Surface, the spirits, over whom he says he has no
control, will any of them suddenly take a fancy to snatch him up and
float him aloft, as he declares them to have done at several séances. To
be sure there is no scene in the School for Scandal where the gas has to
be turned down; and light enough to render objects distinctly visible
is too much light to allow of " levitation ; " so perhaps there is little
fear that MR. HOME, as Joseph Surface, will be suddenly and unseason-
ably " levitated” at the most critical point of a scene with Sir Peter
or Lady Teazle.
Mr. Home has certainly sustained the character of a Medium with
some ability. We shall be glad if his performance of genteel comedy
enables us to say that his talents as an actor are above mediocrity. In
playing Joseph Surface at any rate he will be playing the humbug in a
respectable way, and not playing on public credulity.
